        "text": ".\n\nRead in Chinese\n\nSpeakers:\n\nMs. Cao Shumin, deputy director of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and minister of the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA)\n\nMr. Zhu Yonglei, vice minister of the NRTA\n\nMr. Yang Guorui, vice minister of the NRTA\n\nChairperson:\n\nMr. Chen Wenjun, director general of the Press Bureau of the State Council Information Office (SCIO) and spokesperson of the SCIO\n\nDate:\n\nSept. 28, 2023\n\nChen Wenjun:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, good morning. Welcome to this press conference held by the State Council Information Office (SCIO). This is the 26th briefing in the series \"Embarking on the New Journey â€” A Government Perspective.\" Today, we will brief you on the topic of supporting high-quality development of radio, television, and online audio and video, striving to secure new successes in developing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics. Present today are Ms. Cao Shumin, deputy director of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and minister of the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA), as well as Mr. Zhu Yonglei and Mr. Yang Guorui, both vice ministers of the NRTA.\n\nNow, I'll give the floor to Ms. Cao for her introduction.\n\nCao Shumin:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, good morning. I'm delighted to meet with you all here. On behalf of the NRTA, I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude to members of the media and all sectors of society for their long-standing interest in and support for the development of radio, television, and online audio and video.\n\nNext, I'd like to briefly introduce how the NRTA has thoroughly implemented Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress in its efforts to promote high-quality development of radio, television, and online audio and video. I will address this from six aspects:\n\nFirst, we have focused on themed promotion and the timely release of authoritative information. Radio and television media, as well as online audio and video platforms, have centered their efforts on promoting Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress. They have rolled out a series of influential news reports and theory-based programs, including \"Xi Jinping's Cultural Story,\" \"Chinese Practice with Chinese Wisdom\" and \"New Thought: Along China-Laos Railway.\" During major conferences and events like the \"Two Sessions\" (the annual sessions of the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), the Chengdu Universiade and the Hangzhou Asian Games, radio and television media have undertaken promotion and reporting work, and staff members have shouldered responsibility for broadcast and transmission. This has ensured the safe, high-quality delivery of broadcast signals to countless households.\n\nSecond, we have fostered the creation of high-quality content to enrich the intellectual and cultural lives of our people. China has become a major producer of radio, television, online audio and video, and cultural programs. We boast 56,000 program production and operation institutions. Our annual TV drama production output ranks first worldwide, and our documentaries, animations and cultural programs also rank among the top globally. In the first half of this year, a diverse range of works were produced and released, including 70 television dramas, 112 online series and 272 online micro or short video series. Many excellent works have emerged, including TV and online series like \"The Knockout,\" \"Three-Body\" and \"The Long Season,\" animations such as \"Yao-Chinese Folktales,\" cultural programs like \"China Through Its Intangible Heritage,\" and online audiovisual works like \"Infinity and Beyond 2023\" and \"Here Comes! Beijing Central Axis.\" Some have been enthusiastically received.\n\nThird, we have enhanced our broadcasting system to ensure that the public can readily access and enjoy our content. China has built the world's most extensive radio and television transmission network with cable, wireless, satellite and other technical means. There are 200 million cable TV users and 150 million direct-broadcast satellite households. At the same time, we have over 300 million internet protocol television (IPTV) users, an average of over 270 million monthly active users of over-the-top (OTT) TV platforms, and 1.04 billion users on online video platforms. Last year, the national revenue of the radio, television, and online audio and video industry surpassed 1 trillion yuan ($137.28 billion). To ensure that people in old revolutionary base areas, areas with large ethnic minority populations, border regions and economically disadvantaged areas can access premium broadcasts, we have implemented several key public-benefit projects during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). These include the integrated enhancement of municipal-level broadcasting in the \"Most Impoverished Three Regions and Three Prefectures,\" the building of emergency broadcasting systems at the county level in old revolutionary base areas, areas with large ethnic minority populations, border regions and economically disadvantaged areas, and the promotion and popularization of high-definition interactive digital cable TV set-top boxes in areas with large ethnic minority populations.\n\nFourth, we have advanced scientific and technological innovations to provide better audiovisual experiences. Television is rapidly progressing from Standard Definition (SD) to High Definition (HD) and Ultra High Definition (UHD). There are 1,099 HD channels nationwide, including 10 UHD channels. By the end of 2025, HDTV will become the basic broadcasting standard. We have expedited the development of new broadcasting networks. The \"cable + 5G\" integrated transmission pattern has primarily taken shape, with number of mobile subscribers surpassing 18 million, through the integration of cable television networks nationwide and the simultaneous development of 5G infrastructure for broadcasting. We have also independently developed a smart TV operating system (TVOS), with the number of deployed terminals totaling more than 38 million. Currently, new technologies such as 5G, big data, virtual reality/augmented reality, and artificial intelligence have been widely applied across all sectors of radio, television, and online audio and video content, including gathering and editing, production, broadcasting, transmission, and reception. This has advanced the digital upgrade of the industry at a faster pace, enabling high-quality and diverse audiovisual content and services.\n\nFifth, we have engaged in international exchanges to enhance global reach and influence. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). We have coordinated activities among BRI partner countries to broadcast each other's programs. We've carefully selected a hundred excellent audiovisual works and presented and promoted these works in countries and regions along the Belt and Road routes. We have also selected over 60 excellent works from 30 Belt and Road countries and showcased them in China. Not too long ago, we launched the \"TV China Theater\" on BRICS TV in South Africa, around the time when General Secretary Xi Jinping was in the country to attend the BRICS Summit. We also organized the \"Seeing China\" Africa Broadcasting event. Recently, we hosted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) TV Festival in Nanjing, where over 150 delegates from 10 SCO member states participated. The TV festival featured a series of exchange events, including focused dialogues and exhibitions of TV programs and TV technologies. In recent years, a large number of domestic works, including a feature program presenting China's historic achievements and transformation achieved under the leadership of the Party as well as TV dramas \"Three Body\" and \"Minning Town,\" have been broadcast overseas, vividly demonstrating China's visions, image, and culture.\n\nSixth, we have strengthened industry regulations to maintain a sound business environment. Responding to the public's concerns, we have implemented comprehensive measures to address problems in the culture and entertainment sector. These measures include tackling excessive payments to entertainers, abnormal aesthetic standards, vulgarity, kitsch, and other negative trends. We have also taken resolute action against various violations of regulations, such as the illegal display of ads. Currently, in response to pressing public concerns regarding difficulties and troubles in watching television, we are undertaking targeted actions to address problems related to multiple charges and complicated operations. As the result, over 20 million users in Beijing and other pilot areas are now able to directly access live TV channels as soon as they turn on their TVs. We are committed to continually improving radio, television, and online audio and video services by creating a clean and ethical business environment.\n\nThat concludes my introduction. Next, my colleagues and I are happy to answer your questions. Thank you!\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nChen Wenjun:\n\nThank you. The floor is now open to questions. Please identify the media outlet you represent before raising your questions.\n\nChina Media Group:\n\nJust now, Ms. Cao provided a detailed introduction about the development of China's radio, television, and online audio and video services since the 20th CPC National Congress. What are the plans of the NRTA for their future development? Thank you.\n\nCao Shuming:\n\nThank you for your question. As part of a thematic education campaign launched this year, we have carried out in-depth investigations and research while systematically planning approaches and measures to achieve high-quality development in radio, television, and online audio and video content. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the NRTA is committed to fully implementing the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress. We are diligently studying and implementing the new ideas, viewpoints, and theories of General Secretary Xi Jinping on cultural progress, as well as his significant remarks and directives regarding radio, television and online audio and video content. We will better shoulder our new cultural mission and make great efforts to open new ground for the development of broadcasting in the new era. Next, I will introduce this work in the following three aspects.\n\nFirst, we will adhere to the defined functions of broadcasting. Since its inception, broadcasting has carried the mission of making the Party's voice heard and serving the people's best interest. The defined functions of broadcasting can be summarized with three numbers \"two, three, and four\". \"Two\" refers to the two main businesses of broadcasting: radio and television, and online audio and video services. The two constitute a comprehensive system of audiovisual media, from traditional radio and television to online content. \"Three\" refers to the three roles of broadcasting: it is a means of disseminating culture and thoughts, a sector of public service, and an industry evolving with technological innovation. As a means of disseminating culture and thoughts, broadcasting should let the Party's voice better heard whiling building on cultural strength. As a sector of public service, broadcasting should better serve people's interest, better meet customers' demands, and provide good content, products, and services for the public. As a technology-driven industry, broadcasting should follow the laws guiding tech industry development and drive growth through advanced technology. \"Four\" refers to the four business modes of broadcasting or four carriers of broadcasting services. These include radio and television networks; IPTV networks, or internet protocol television, transmitted by telecom operators; internet TV, known as OTT; and the internet. The first three services all require the access to a television set, while the internet business mode operates on various devices with smaller screens like mobile phones. The four layers of business mode are developed through the technological iteration of the internet and the mobile internet, as we promote the integration of telecommunications networks, cable television networks and the internet. In this new stage of development, we will make solid effort to fulfil our mission, adhere to the defined functions of broadcasting, and systematically promote the high-quality development of radio and television as well as online audio and video services.\n\nSecond, we will identify the future direction of our work. We will prioritize our efforts in the following aspects: First, consolidating and improving traditional radio and TV media, which means ensuring the public enjoys satisfying and enriching TV services. We will take a series of measures, including enhancing services, improving the viewing experience, offering better TV programs, increasing the popularity of high-definition TV, and accelerating the development of ultra-high-definition TV. Additionally, we will work on reducing the number of redundant channels and focus on enhancing their quality. We will utilize radio and television media as a platform to provide more services to the audience, including government services, social services, and family services. Second, we will explore and promote media integration. We will build new types of mainstream radio and TV media while fostering new media formats, such as online audio and video platforms. Third, integrating resources for collaborative development. We will address the issue of fragmented and dispersed resources within the industry and integrate resources such as content, communication, technology, and data. By doing so, entities within the industry can collaborate to develop, share, and utilize these resources with a view to achieving shared benefits and applications through joint efforts, having a greater magnet effect, achieving scale benefits, and creating synergy.\n\nThird, we will highlight key areas of our work, which are in the following aspects: First, we will expand the influence and reach of mainstream public opinion. Our dedicated efforts will center on promoting Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and constructing a comprehensive media communication system to shape a new landscape of mainstream public opinion. Second, we will elevate the quality of our work. By adhering to the principles of \"accurate topic selection, effective storytelling, and high-quality production\" in major thematic creations, our aim is to promote outstanding traditional Chinese culture and showcase modern Chinese civilization. Third, we will harness technology to drive innovation within the broadcasting and TV industry. Our goal is to leverage cutting-edge technology to facilitate development across various aspects of the industry. Fourth, we will enhance management within the radio and TV industry. We will make efforts to improve the legal and policy framework while enhancing overall governance in the cultural and entertainment sectors. The objective is to foster a clean and upright industry ecology. Fifth, we will improve safety and security measures. We will systematically advance safety and security efforts to ensure safe and high-quality radio and TV services for the public. Sixth, we will strengthen international communication. We will further deepen international exchanges and cooperation in the field of radio and TV to effectively tell China's stories and promote China's voice.\n\nThank you.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nChina Youth Daily:\n\nThe theme song of the theory-based TV program \"Chinese Practice with Chinese Wisdom\" has recently gained popularity on Weibo. This theme song is a unique blend of traditional Chinese music and rap, featuring ancient Chinese sayings that reflect Chinese wisdom, including phrases like \"regarding people as the foundation of a nation\" and \"pursuing the common good for all\" in its lyrics. It's quite surprising how a theme song from a theory-based program can be so inspiring and innovative. I would like to hear your thoughts on this phenomenon. Thank you.\n\nCao Shumin:\n\nThank you; I will address your question. Our program, \"Chinese Practice with Chinese Wisdom,\" has garnered widespread attention from television and internet users since its release in June. Since the 20th CPC National Congress, the national radio and TV system has launched a series of excellent radio and TV programs to promote and explain the Party's innovative theories. The \"Chinese Practice with Chinese Wisdom\" program you just mentioned is based on 10 keywords from the report to the 20th CPC National Congress, such as \"pursuing the common good for all\" and \"regarding the people as the foundation of the state.\" It conveys the \"cultural code\" of \"why China\" through storytelling, scenario interpretation, outdoor visits, and song and dance performances. It reveals the significance of integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's specific realities and fine traditional culture, especially integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's fine traditional culture. This is also a theory-based TV program that implements the guidelines from the important speech made by General Secretary Xi Jinping at a meeting on cultural inheritance and development on June 2. It was indeed a very impressive TV program. The program was broadcast on all satellite TV channels and seven major online audio and video platforms. The theme song you mentioned is also highly captivating, especially among young people. Here, I highly recommend it to everyone once again.\n\nRadio and TV, as prominent players in mainstream media, play a crucial role in deepening the understanding and dissemination of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress. Their objective is to make the Party's innovative theories accessible to the general public by using engaging narratives and easy-to-comprehend language. Serving as bridges, radio and TV connect the Party's innovative theories with the public. Through the implementation of the \"Innovative Theory Promotion Project,\" we have facilitated the production of theory-based programs that are both content-rich and well-received by the public. For example, programs like \"Philosophy Shining China\" and \"Philosophy Shining the Journey\" delve into grassroots communities across the country. They use ordinary people's stories to unveil the profound truths behind them. Programs such as \"This is China\" and \"Voice of China\" address current hot topics head-on and provide clear explanations of the strengths of the China's system, theories, Chinese path, and culture. These programs help to boost the confidence of young people. The documentary \"Thousand Villages Demonstration and Ten Thousand Villages Renovation,\" currently in production, will showcase the significance of Xi Jinping Thought on Eco-Civilization through the transformation of numerous villages in Zhejiang province.\n\nRadio and television should be the recorders of the great era. Radio and television has always been on the frontline to record the footnotes of the progress of the times, from the critical moments represented by the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, the 20th CPC National Congress, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, to the processes of major national causes such as poverty alleviation, rural revitalization, invigorating the country through science and technology, and innovation-driven development. During this summer, many places in China were hit by extreme natural disasters such as typhoons and heavy rainfall, and a large number of radio and television journalists went to the frontlines to carry out reports and recorded the spiritual strength of unity in various communities. Over the past few days, in the lead-up to the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou, we adopted a series of measures to ensure the Games could reach most of the public. Notably, over 100,000 staff involved in radio and television across the country have worked on the frontlines to edit, produce, and broadcast programs, making their contributions to create a splendid event.\n\nThank you.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nSansha Satellite TV:\n\nThe last few years have seen many excellent new Chinese TV dramas. TV series such as \"The Age of Awakening\" and \"Minning Town,\" which we mentioned before, and \"The Knockout,\" \"Three-Body,\" and \"Meet Yourself,\" all broadcast this year, have gained great popularity among the people and generated a huge response across the society. I would like to ask: What experience has been accumulated by NRTA in promoting the creation of premium TV projects? What exceptional TV dramas are set to release next?\n\nZhu Yonglei:\n\nI will answer these questions. Over recent years, the original ability of domestic-made TV series has been significantly enhanced. High-quality masterpieces have emerged constantly; realistic and revolutionary-themed TV drama projects have especially reached a new level. Chinese TV drama projects have also gone to the global stage. For example, the export of Chinese TV series numbered 803, spanning 140,000 episodes in 2022.\n\nWe have explored many practices to promote the creation of premium TV drama projects. Most importantly, we should adhere to the main line of \"identifying topics, telling good stories, and producing premium projects\"; focus on the major strategies, major deployments, and critical moments of the CPC and the country, and gather the strength across the whole industry to create top-quality TV drama products. We have established a relevant system to encourage creators to go to the masses, organized scriptwriters, directors, and actors from TV series such as \"Minning Town\" and \"Bright Future\" to go to the grassroots level to conduct in-depth research and experience local life for extended periods. We have promoted premium TV projects to the home page of key online audio and video platforms and broadcast those projects during prime time on satellite TV. Starting this year, TV series such as \"The Knockout,\" \"Three-Body,\" \"Meet Yourself,\" and \"The Long Season\" have been broadcast during prime times on important platforms and further promoted the enjoyment of TV series across the country. We have also established cooperation mechanisms with the Chinese Writers Association and the Chinese Academy of History to vigorously promote excellent literary works and the history of Chinese civilization to become a treasure house of resources for the creation of premium projects. We have also established a mechanism for unveiling and listing topics and encouraged the participation of all film and television institutions across the country, which has greatly stimulated the vitality of innovation and creation in the industry. We have formulated and released the Production Standards for Master Tape of TV Series, the Production and Operation Standards for TV Series and Online Series Crews (trial), and the Model Text of the Actor Employment Contract (trial). We have also set up national laboratories for innovation in TV series production technology to promote innovative breakthroughs in production technology, production standards, and production norms. All of these efforts mentioned above have created a sound environment and provided important support and guarantees for the creation of premium TV projects.\n\nRecently, centering on the 70th anniversary of the victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we have launched a new TV drama, \"Winter and Lion.\" Many other TV series, such as \"Battle of Shangganling\" and \"Scout Hero,\" will be aired soon. We will also roll out an array of TV series, such as \" Kun Peng Ji Lang\" (The Roc Breaking the Waves), \"Wen Cang Mang\" (Questioning the Boundless), and \"Yu Xue Rong Guang\" (The Blood-soaked Glory) to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the birth of Mao Zedong. Centering on the topics that include the 75th anniversary of the founding of the PRC, the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, and the 90th anniversary of the victory of the Red Army's Long March, we have accelerated the production progress of key TV projects, such as \"Wei Da De Chang Zheng\" (The Great Long March), \"Zui Wan Qiang De Di Kang\" (The Toughest Resistance), and \"Feng Yu Baoqingli.\" We have also focused on the planning and guidance of Belt and Road-themed TV series, such as \"Welcome to Milele Village,\" \"Born to Be Alive,\" \" Bloom Life,\" and \"Ri Guang Zhi Cheng\" (City of Sunshine) as well as the themed TV series \"Snow World,\" to display the comprehensive revitalization of Northeast China and constantly meet the diverse and high-quality spiritual and cultural needs of the people.\n\nThank you.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nBeijing Youth Daily:\n\nThe issue of repeated television charges has always been of great concern to all. The NRTA has started a rectification campaign regarding this issue. Could you please detail the plans for the campaign and how the work is progressing? Thank you.\n\nCao Shumin:\n\nThank you for your questions. It's indeed an issue of great concern to all. Mr. Yang will answer these questions.\n\nYang Guorui:\n\nI will answer your questions. Both the central government and the people are highly concerned about the rectification campaign against the issue of repeated television charges. The NRTA thoroughly implements a people-centered governance philosophy, makes a resolute decision, and harnesses the strength of the entire industry to address the issue as a mandatory initiative, a heartfelt project, and a systematic endeavor. At present, we have formed three major systems: cable TV transmitted through cable TV networks, IPTV transmitted through the private network of telecom operators, and the OTT TV transmitted through the internet. On the one hand, this has greatly satisfied the diverse needs of the people. On the other hand, it has caused the issue of repeated charges due to the involvement of various kinds of market players and brought trouble to the people.\n\nWe have recently established a working group to address outstanding issues of strong public concern, such as the excessive number of subscription options, the diversity of fee-charging entities, and the lack of transparency in charges. The working group has inspected all seven OTT TV integration platforms, 22 TV manufacturers, and IPTV and cable TV services in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Nearly 10,000 subscribers have completed a questionnaire. We have been in communication with relevant departments, including the Cyber Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the China Consumers Association, while also listening to the opinions of all parties involved in the industry chain and considering their advice. Based on the information collected, we aim to address these issues through overall planning, starting with easy tasks and then moving to difficult ones, with each step forward led by pilot programs. And this work will be completed through three stages:\n\nIn the first stage, we will gradually reduce the number of subscription options by 40% and enhance transparency for consumers within the year. In the second stage, we will set norms for TV services and charges in the first half of next year. In the third stage, we will enhance the long-term management mechanism for three major business systems, including cable TV, IPTV, and OTT by the end of next year, to effectively prevent repeated and irregular charges and their resurgence.\n\nCurrently, we have launched our first-stage work and selected seven pilot units, including Beijing Gehua CATV Network, Shandong Network, Shanghai Branch of China Mobile, Guangdong Branch of China Telecom, Jilin Branch of China Unicom, Xiaomi TV, and Hisense TV, all of which are involved in the three major business systems. We have provided guidance and facilitated the implementation of concrete measures in these enterprises to reduce or combine subscription options, enhance subscription management pages, and improve the free-of-charge section. Among these, Gehua CATV has reduced 14 options to five, while Guangdong Telecom IPTV has reduced the original 10 film and TV subscription options to just one. New Xiaomi TV sets and Hisense TV sets no longer come preloaded with pre-installed APKs.\n\nWe anticipate that by the end of October, the pilot units will have reduced subscription options by more than 40%. In November and December, we will launch a nationwide campaign to achieve an overall 40% reduction, effectively preventing repeated and irregular charges. Moving forward, we welcome everyone to actively participate, tune in to their TVs, and monitor our efforts.\n\nThanks.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nChangjiang Daily:\n\nIn recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to operate the TV. Many people believe that there are too many remote controls and buttons, often causing them to be unable to find the live channels and programs they prefer. This is particularly unfriendly for the elderly. My question is whether the NRTA has any measures to improve these matters.\n\nCao Shumin:\n\nThank you for your question, which reflects the thoughts of our audience. We are actively addressing this issue, and Mr. Zhu is responsible for this matter. He will provide an answer to your question.\n\nZhu Yonglei:\n\nI will address the question. At times, people have reported that it is difficult to locate live channels due to several different remote controls and confusing buttons. Moreover, there are too many cables connecting the TV and set-top box. The NRTA places significant importance on addressing these issues of public concern, seeing it as part of people's wellbeing and making every effort to improve the situation. Based on our investigations and research, we have introduced a specialized improvement plan and collaborated with the MIIT to issue relevant circulars and implement a series of measures.\n\nFor example, we have launched a pilot project to upgrade the software of cable TV and IPTV set-top boxes, ensuring that people can directly watch a live channel when they turn on the box. Additionally, we are working on positioning the window for live channels prominently on the interactive page. Across the country, over 20 million cable TV and IPTV set-top box subscribers can now directly watch a live channel when they turn on the TV and box. Among them, more than 5 million cable TV subscribers are in the pilot city Beijing. By the end of this year, 80% of cable TV subscribers and 85% of IPTV subscribers will be able to directly watch a live channel when they switch on the TV. We also encourage cable TV and IPTV operators to simplify the replay operation. Certain advanced smart set-top boxes can also quickly awaken from standby mode, reducing boot-up time.\n\nWe have collaborated with the MIIT and encouraged TV manufacturers to research and develop smart TV sets that can automatically prioritize live channels when powered on. Additionally, we have convened R&D institutions and manufacturers to streamline and reduce remote controls, exploring various methods to integrate the functions of TV sets and set-top boxes into a single remote control, and ultimately creating all-in-one receiving devices.\n\nAt the same time, we also actively organized and guided cable TV and IPTV platforms to increase the supply of free high-quality content. For example, Beijing Gehua Cable recently launched a free \"classics\" section. Viewers in Beijing can watch top classic TV series such as \"The Water Margin,\" \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms,\" \"A Dream of Red Mansions\" and \"Journey to the West,\" which have been restored in high-definition on the Gehua Cable platform.\n\nNext, we will continue to promote the specialized improvement plan, take concrete actions to address the problem of complicated TV viewing operations and continuously improve the viewing experience for the users.\n\nThank you.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nScience and Technology Daily:\n\nWhat progress and achievements have been made in domestic high-definition (HD) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) television? What are the next considerations in promoting the development of UHDTV? Thank you.\n\nZhu Yonglei:\n\nHDTV and UHDTV is a hot topic nowadays. In recent years, we have taken the promotion of HDTV and UHDTV development as an important measure for the high-quality and innovative development of the radio, television, and online audio and video industry, and has achieved certain results.\n\nIn terms of policy support and guidance, last year the NRTA issued Guidelines on Further Accelerating the Development of HDTV and UHDTV, which stipulated that by the end of 2025, TV stations at and above the prefecture level and qualified county-level TV stations should fully complete the transition from standard-definition to high-definition, basically shut down standard-definition channels, HDTV should become the basic TV broadcast format, and UHDTV channels and program supply should take shape. This sends a clear message to the industry with an explicit timetable, which effectively promotes the supply of HD and UHD content, network construction and availability of terminals. The development of domestic HDTV and UHDTV has effectively promoted relevant industrial development. According to statistics, the scale of China's HDTV and UHDTV industry exceeded 3 trillion yuan last year.\n\nIn terms of UHDTV content production, eight 4K resolution channels and two 8K resolution channels have been launched across the country. The UHD production and broadcasting system has been basically established. Some radio and television production and transmission institutions have produced and reserved tens of thousands of hours of UHD programs. Major online audio and video platforms have opened both 4K and 8K sections, providing UHDTV series, variety shows and other programs.\n\nIn terms of HD and UHD program transmission, we have carried out the construction of a national network of cable TV and fiber-optic and IP-based upgrades, accelerated the replacement and intelligent updates of UHD set-top boxes, and increased the coverage of IPTV UHD set-top boxes. China's direct-to-home (DTH) platform has developed rapidly in HD, and has provided 31channels of HD programs to DTH users across the country.\n\nIn terms of key technology research and development, we are actively promoting independent research and development of UHD key technology, standards, and independent production of equipment. China has made important breakthroughs in key technical fields such as high dynamic range, three-dimensional sound, UHD smart TV operating systems, and high-efficiency video coding, and has put them into industrial operation.\n\nGoing forward, the NRTA will encourage TV stations at all levels, and film and TV production institutions to actively use the UHDTV format to produce programs, support TV stations in launching UHD channels, improve the transmission coverage of UHD programs, and better meet the people's new needs and expectations for a better life.\n\nThank you.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nPhoenix TV:\n\nIn June 2022, China Broadnet held the launch ceremony for 5G network services. Over the past year, how has the development of 5G broadcasting progressed? Also, what are the key areas of focus for the next steps in the integration of national cable TV networks and the integrated development of 5G broadcasting? Thank you.\n\nCao Shumin:\n\nThank you for the questions. It has been more than a year since China Broadnet launched 5G services, and there has been considerable interest from various parties. I would like to invite Mr. Yang to answer the questions.\n\nYang Guorui:\n\nThank you to the reporter for your interest. Promoting the integration of national cable TV networks and the integrated development of 5G broadcasting is one of the key tasks outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan. By the end of 2020, China Broadnet successfully completed the integration of 23 non-listed and one listed provincial network companies, achieving new results in unifying networks nationwide. On June 27, 2022, China Broadnet officially launched 5G services, establishing a new development pattern of China's broadcasting networks that integrates cable services and 5G technology.\n\nThis past year, the development of 5G broadcasting has started well. There has been ongoing deepening of the \"co-construction and sharing\" strategic cooperation with China Mobile. Through this collaboration, a total of 578,000 700MHz 5G base stations have been built, and the total number of usable base stations (including 700MHz base stations and 5G/4G base stations shared with China Mobile) now exceeds 3.8 million. This achievement has enabled continuous coverage in administrative regions at and above the township level and effective coverage in rural areas. The number of China Broadnet's 5G users has surpassed 18 million. By the end of June 2023, China Broadnet had opened and launched three nationwide basic business network platforms: the fixed voice service network, the internet backbone network and the content integration platform. This has further enhanced the communications model integrating cable services and 5G technology.\n\nNext, the NRTA will guide China Broadnet to pursue a path of characteristic and differentiated development, focusing on the following five areas:\n\nFirst, strengthening our foundation and upgrading networks. We will guide China Broadnet to continue deepening cooperation with China Mobile in co-construction and sharing, continuously optimizing the urban and rural 5G broadcasting network coverage, accelerating the transformation and upgrading of the cable TV network, enhancing the deep integration with cloud computing, data centers and edge computing, improving the end-to-end performance of the cable TV network, and creating a new type of broadcasting network.\n\nSecond, achieving fixed-mobile convergence and building a comprehensive business operation system. We will guide China Broadnet to coordinate the utilization of the four major business network platforms â€” namely the 5G service network, fixed voice service network, internet backbone network, and content integration and broadcast control platform â€” and to develop a comprehensive business model integrating cable TV, 5G technology, broadband network, and voice service with everything possible, to better cater to people's diverse and multi-level spiritual and cultural needs.\n\nThird, upholding tradition while innovating and cultivating distinctive advantages in content. We will guide China Broadnet to strengthen construction of the dedicated national cultural network, focus on gathering various content resources, reconstruct the process of content dissemination and distribution, and innovate product forms. By using unique content to drive business upgrades, the aim is to build a new communications pattern that spans screens, domains, networks and terminals.\n\nFourth, optimizing services and improving customer service efficiency. We will guide China Broadnet to continuously improve the combination of online and offline channels and customer service systems, further enhance the quality of broadcasting network products, improve capabilities to provide better services, enhance the precision and intelligence of services, and strive to elevate the user service experience.\n\nFifth, deepening integration and optimizing the operation pattern of a unified network. We will guide China Broadnet to further unify networks at both national and provincial level, and improve the operational management system based on \"unified construction, unified management, unified standards and unified branding\" to achieve scale and efficiency and thus realize high-quality development.\n\nThank you.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nChina Dailyï¼š\n\nA few days ago, the SCO TV Festival was held in Nanjing. The NRTA has organized a lot of activities related to international exchanges. Can you provide details regarding the NRTA's upcoming plans and initiatives for furthering international exchanges in the field of radio and television? Thank you.\n\nYang Guorui:\n\nThank you for your attention. This year's popular TV series, \"Three-Body\" and \"The Knockout,\" which many of you may have watched, have ignited a television series craze and received positive reviews as they were broadcast overseas. This serves as a testament to the globalization of domestic audiovisual productions. In recent years, the NRTA has continued to promote friendly exchanges and pragmatic cooperation between China and other countries in the field of audiovisual services.\n\nFirst, we have established mechanisms and platforms. We have organized a series of multilateral meetings, such as the \"China-Arab States Forum on Radio and Television Cooperation\" and the \"China-Africa Media Cooperation Forum,\" initiated such brand activities as \"Audio-Video China, Global Screening,\" \"Sino-foreign Audiovisual Week,\" and \"Sino-foreign Short Video Competition,\" and signed 179 cooperation agreements or memorandums with more than 90 countries, thus setting up platforms for policy communication and pragmatic cooperation.\n\nSecond, we have been better at telling China's stories. In recent years, numerous domestically produced audiovisual productions have been broadcast abroad, with the influence of realistic-themed dramas steadily growing. For example, the TV series \"Minning Town\" has resonated widely with international audiences, showing the tenacity and confidence of the Chinese people in eradicating poverty and striving for a better life. Through these audiovisual works, we have presented a China that is credible, appealing, and respectable.\n\nThird, we have promoted industrial cooperation. Through facilitating dialogues between Chinese and foreign industries, improving incentive policies, supporting the development of export hubs, and participating in famed international film and television festivals and exhibitions, we have consistently enhanced the scale and quality of China's international audiovisual cooperation. As a result, China has become an important force in the global audiovisual industry.\n\nFourth, we have made more international friends. Our circle of international media friends is constantly expanding. In recent years, over 6,000 media professionals from more than 150 countries and regions have come to China for exchanges and discussions. Additionally, more than 700 groups of media organizations from countries along the Belt and Road have shot programs in China. These exchanges have allowed participants to immerse themselves in the vibrant atmosphere of China in the new era, helped strengthen people-to-people connectivity, and solidified the public support and social foundation for people-to-people exchanges and audiovisual cooperation between China and other countries.\n\nFifth, we have deepened mutual learning among civilizations. We have adhered to the dual principle of \"bringing in\" and \"going global,\" actively introducing outstanding TV programs from around the world. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI, and the NRTA is organizing activities on overseas audiovisual programs under the theme \"Colorful Audiovisual Shows, Shared Silk Road,\" selecting more than 60 excellent audiovisual programs from over 30 countries, including TV series, animations and documentaries, for exhibition to celebrate the diversity and mutual appreciation of civilizations.\n\nNext, we will continue to actively expand our circle of friends within the global media, continuously enhance China's influence in the audiovisual field worldwide, and contribute more towards building a global community of shared future and promoting a new form of human advancement.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nGuangming Daily:\n\nTomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival. As we know, Henan Radio and TV Station consistently presents the \"Chinese Festival\" series of programs each year to celebrate the festival. Among them, \"Night Banquet in Tang Dynasty Palace\" and \"Flying Apsaras in Longmen Grottoes\" are beloved by viewers and have become internet sensations. With the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday, could you please highlight the programs on offer? What measures will the NRTA implement to promote the development of radio, television, and online audio and video programs? Thank you.\n\nCao Shumin:\n\nAs the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday approaches, people eagerly anticipate the programs that will be broadcast. I would like to invite Mr. Zhu Yonglei to provide insights into this matter.\n\nZhu Yonglei:\n\nThank you. Henan Broadcasting System is scheduled to broadcast the highly anticipated show \"Magical Trip on Mid-Autumn Festival\" during this year's Mid-Autumn Festival. The station has presented the \"Chinese Festivals\" series during important festivals for several years. With the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday, radio, television, and online audio and video programs have become a cultural feast anticipated by the public. China's radio and television stations, as well as online audio and video platforms, have arranged various programs for viewers during the holiday. In addition to the previously mentioned program by Henan Broadcasting System, China Media Group, along with major satellite TV channels, will also deliver exciting shows such as the \"Mid-Autumn Traditional Opera Gala,\" \"Mid-Autumn Traditional Music Concert,\" and \"A Thousand Years in Chang'an.\" During the National Day holiday, major satellite TV channels and online audio and video platforms will present a variety of entertainment programs, documentaries, and animated films, including \"The City of Museums,\" \"Time Concert,\" \"The Chinese Restaurant,\" \"Melodies Across Time and Space,\" and \"Journey through China: The Yellow River.\" National radio, television, and new media organizations will collaborate on \"Splendid China,\" a large-scale integrated livestreaming event, allowing the audience to experience the landscapes and prosperity of the country without leaving their homes during the holiday.\n\nSince the 18th CPC National Congress, radio, television, and online audio and video service providers have thoroughly implemented General Secretary Xi Jinping's important discourse on the development of literature and art. They have increased the supply of programs with high-quality content, providing people with richer cultural nourishment. They have already launched various variety shows such as \"Chinese Poetry Conference,\" \"China in Classics,\" \"Everlasting Classics,\" and \"Chinese Festivals,\" as well as documentaries like \"Ling Hang,\" \"Faith Makes Great,\" \"The Place of Birth,\" \"Me and My New Era,\" and \"Rooting.\" Additionally, there are animated films like \"Yao-Chinese Folktales\" and \"Da Yu.\" These cultural products have been warmly received by audiences.\n\nIndeed, the current supply of high-quality content on radio and television remains insufficient, and this issue is prominent. We must further strengthen the supply. Next, we will deepen the structural reform on the supply side of content and strive to present more outstanding works. First, we will emphasize cultural inheritance. We will adhere to creative transformation and innovative development and introduce works such as \"Exploring China through Ancient Documents,\" \"Poetry and Painting of China: Eternal Masterpieces,\" \"Great Jiangnan,\" and \"Festivals with National Colors.\" These programs will promote fine traditional Chinese culture and showcase the modern Chinese civilization. Second, we will carry forward our revolutionary traditions and heritage. Programs like \"Chairman Mao Zedong\" and \"The Revelation of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea\" will be launched, allowing people to reminisce about the revolutionary years through audiovisual presentations. Third, we will focus on depicting the vibrant aspects of life. We will introduce programs centered around people's lives, such as \"Say Hello to Life,\" \"Countryside on the Tip of the Tongue,\" \"Here We Are in the Sunshine,\" and \"The Happiness of Hardworking Individuals.\" Fourth, we will showcase the beauty of China. Programs like \"Grand Canal,\" \"Mount Tai,\" and \"Our National Parks\" will be presented to display the amazing landscapes of our country and showcase the achievements of ecological conservation, depicting a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.\n\nThank you.\n\n_ueditor_page_break_tag_\n\nChen Wenjun:\n\nOne last question, please.\n\nXinhua News Agency:\n\nPromoting media convergence and enhancing the development of new media have been prominent topics in recent years. I would like to inquire about the efforts made by the NRTA in these domains.\n\nCao Shumin:\n\nAs you know, with the advancement of 5G technology in China, mobile phones have emerged as the primary means to access information and enjoy cultural lives. Therefore, it is paramount to develop new media and promote media convergence. The NRTA has adopted a dual approach, improving traditional radio and television services while advancing the innovative development of new media. These efforts encompass new media of traditional radio and television service providers, as well as numerous online audio and video platforms. Deepening the convergence of traditional and new media and improving the all-media communication system are a strategic deployment made by the CPC Central Committee. In recent years, under the leadership of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, the NRTA has pushed the radio and television broadcasting's main force to launch relevant initiatives.\n\nFirst, we have focused on playing a demonstrative and leading role in promoting the in-depth integration of radio and television media. Over the past five years, we have conducted activities to promote the selection of new brands in national radio and television media integration, forming a number of influential and distinctive new media platforms such as yangshipin.cn (CCTV), Mango TV, BesTV, and ZJSTV. We have guided eight radio and television organizations in regions such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Suzhou to set up radio and television media integrated development and innovation centers to conduct theoretical research, model exploration, technology application, and project incubation. In addition, we have paved new paths and broken new ground for the integrated development of radio and television media. We have held China radio and television media integrated development conferences on a regular basis in order to promote successful practices and experiences regarding integrated development. To foster collaboration and synergy in the industry, we have established the national radio and television new media alliance in June of this year. This alliance aims to unite the strengths of various media outlets to create a 'united fleet of radio and television' for online publicity. A total of 42,000 new media accounts were opened by national radio and television media, forming a new media matrix group. With such a large number of accounts, if they were operated separately, the broadcasting power would be limited. So, how can we aggregate these accounts? In order to better leverage the potential and collective strength of these resources, we have selected 100 radio and television new media brands, such as CCTV, Beijing Time, and Shanghai Kankan News, and formed the national radio and television new media alliance, which currently has a total of nearly 2 billion followers. By combining the content advantages of radio and television content with the advantages of internet communication and strive to build the alliance into a platform for thought leadership, public opinion guidance, collaboration and sharing, and development empowerment, using input from high-end think tanks. Since its establishment on June 28 of this year, the alliance has published a total of 550 articles, accumulating over 3.5 billion readings.\n\nHere are two examples. Recently, in order to celebrate the sixth China Farmers' Harvest Festival, the radio and television new media alliance launched a large-scale integrated media live broadcast titled \"Harvest.\" The broadcasting stations of five major grain-producing provinces, including Heilongjiang, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Anhui, took turns to broadcast live, showing their harvests and the modernization of agriculture. The correspondents walked into the fields and took the audience on an immersive journey to experience the magnificence of China's immense grain reserves and the joy of harvesting, capturing rice fields stretching for miles and abundant fruits and vegetables. In addition, the 100-member organization of the national radio and television new media alliance simultaneously livestreamed the event across various platforms, including their apps and official accounts on Douyin, Kuaishou, Weibo, Bilibili, WeChat, etc. The hashtag #Harvest quickly climbed up the trending topics list, with each livestream attracting millions of viewers. The total viewership exceeded 200 million. The second example will be carried out soon. During the National Day holiday, the NRTA will introduce a large-scale integrated media live broadcast program called \"Prosperous China, Beautiful Homeland.\" In addition to providing a wonderful daily live broadcast, a \"slow live broadcast\" will also be available on new media platforms, showcasing Chinese festival scenes in real-time, presenting the audience with magnificent mountains and rivers, and capturing the atmosphere of a prosperous China. We are looking forward to this and hope that everyone will tune in during the National Day holiday.\n\nAt the same time, we have been actively promoting the construction of an all-media communication system. This involves pioneering innovative coordination mechanisms to establish a development pattern that integrates large and small screens, encourages interaction between long and short videos, and promotes collaboration between traditional radio and television media and online audio and video platforms. Our aim is to jointly enrich a deeply integrated and mutually beneficial audio and video ecosystem. This specifically relates to the cooperation between traditional radio and television and their new media counterparts, the coordination between long videos such as TV dramas and documentaries and short videos on the internet, and the collaboration between traditional radio and television media and commercial platforms such as iQIYI, Youku, and Tencent, etc., so that they can work in unison.\n\nNext, we will continue to focus on \"establishing an all-media communication system that prioritizes content development, is supported by advanced technology, and is secured by innovative management.' We will systematically plan and promote the construction of all-media communication systems in the fields of radio, television, and online audio and video, thereby shaping a new mainstream media pattern.\n\nTomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the National Day holiday is also approaching. I would like to take this opportunity to wish all media friends and the audience in front of their televisions a happy holiday. I also hope that everyone will continue to pay attention to and support the work of radio, television, and online audio and video in the future. Thank you.\n\nChen Wenjun:\n\nThank you, Ms. Cao. Thank you to Mr. Zhu and Mr. Yang and friends from the press. I would like to join Ms. Cao by wishing you a good festival and holiday! Goodbye.\n\nTranslated and edited by Zhang Rui, Wang Wei, Xu Kailin, Liu Sitong, Cui Can, Yang Xi, Qin Qi, Wang Yanfang, Yan Bin, Huang Shan, Liu Caiyi, Zhang Tingting, Yuan Fang, Wang Ziteng, Zhang Junmian, Yan Xiaoqing, Li Huiru, David Ball, Tom Arnsten, and Jay Birbeck.
