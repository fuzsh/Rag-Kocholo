Xi had also made it his priority. Establishing a “moderately wealthy society” is linked to Xi’s grandiose political agenda of achieving “the rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation.”2 In the service of this agenda, Chinese official media had created a facade of harmony and prosperity. Wuhan is the crossroads of China. A metropolis with a population of about 11 million, it lies at the center of China’s most important railway and highway lines. China’s longest and busiest river, the mighty Yangzi, meanders through Wuhan, where it is joined by the Han River. In the busiest travel season of the year, the week before the Lunar New Year’s Day, about 15 million travelers pass through Wuhan, mostly by train. Imagine the shock of cutting off all transportation in and out of Wuhan with a notice of only half a day. This was what happened when the Wuhan municipal government announced on the night of January 22 that beginning at 10:00 a.m. the following day, the city would be strictly locked down.\n\nx • PREFACE\n\nIt was only two days before the most important festival of the year, and the city was already full of festivities. The lockdown changed everything. What transpired in the first few days of the lockdown was like scenes taken straight from Hollywood apocalypse movies. Streets with no signs of people or traffic. Homeless cats scavenging in abandoned construction sites. Crowds panic-shopping in grocery stores. Self-quarantined residents peeping out from behind their apartment windows. Gated communities with their gates sealed to block people from leaving or entering. Death, sorrow, and anger filling the air and social media. Wuhan’s lockdown would eventually last for seventy-six days and turn out to be an event of world-historical proportions. For better or worse, it lives up to Wuhan’s prominent place in modern Chinese history. The 1911 Revolution, which overthrew China’s last imperial dynasty and established the Republic of China, started in Wuchang, which is part of Wuhan.3 In the Asian Pacific theater in World War II, after Nanjing fell to Japanese invaders in 1937, the republican government relocated temporarily to Wuhan. Although Wuhan eventually fell to the Japanese, the Battle of Wuhan from June 11 to October 27, 1938, became a critical turning point in China’s War of Resistance against Japan by inflicting the heaviest casualties on Japanese troops in the first period of the war.4 Wuhan was also a center of political action in Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, on July 16, 1966, the seventy-two-year-old Mao made a public performance of his revolutionary (and physical) vigor by joining Wuhan’s eleventh annual swimming competition across the Yangzi River. Photographs of his swim, printed in national newspapers, became icons of the Cultural Revolution. A year later, in the famous Wuhan Incident in July 1967, two leading members of Mao’s Cultural Revolution group who were visiting Wuhan from Beijing were beaten up and abducted by Wuhan’s conservative Red Guards. Mao, who was making a secret visit to Wuhan, was forced to fly to Shanghai at 2:00 a.m. on July 21, escorted by air force fighters. As the China historians Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals write, Mao’s lieutenants back in Beijing, who urged him to leave Wuhan, “may well have had in mind not only the Wuhan incident of October 11, 1911, which led to the unravelling\n\nPREFACE\n\n• xi\n\nand finally the collapse of the Qing dynasty, but also the arrest of Chiang Kai-shek in Xi’an in 1936 by one of his generals.”5 What happened in Wuhan in 2020? Why? How did the state and citizens manage the crisis? How did they interact? How did residents cope with daily life and work?\n\n*** I followed the lockdown in Wuhan and the COVID-19 pandemic in China from my home in Philadelphia. I have relatives and friends in China. Although they were mostly not in Wuhan, they voluntarily confined themselves to their homes and experienced many of the same fears and hardships as residents in Wuhan. While American media reports spotlighted China’s draconian approach to containing the coronavirus,6 often noting that such measures could happen only in an authoritarian regime, what moved me most was the resilience and grit of hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese amid all the hardships. COVID-19 was an unprecedented catastrophe. It upset the lives of a nation overnight. The certainty of everyday life dissolved into quicksand. Little was known about this virus in January 2020. No one knew how long the lockdown would last. Yet as the lockdown passed from days to weeks, the city endured. Medical workers made great sacrifices, working to exhaustion even though they initially did not have adequate protective gear. Volunteers across the nation mobilized to provide assistance to Wuhan. Ordinary residents, including my eighty-year-old-plus parents, “fought” the virus by strictly following stay-at-home orders. They lived through COVID-19 and the lockdown with a silent courage that filled me with awe. They suffered more than many others physically and psychologically because they were among the first to be exposed to this novel virus. They had no other people to learn from and no time to prepare for it. Yet they accepted the new routine of home quarantine with resignation and grace. Deep down in their hearts, they harbored a sense of humility toward life. For them, life is the most precious thing one can have in this world, and one must do everything possible to preserve it. It is precious not only, not even primarily, to the self. If one’s life is\n\nxii • PREFACE\n\njust one’s own, that would be simple, but, no, it is also part of one’s family. As one diarist wrote, In the days of the lockdown, I have particularly strong feelings about the following: My body does not belong to me alone, but to the whole family. No one in the family has a body that belongs only to the individual person. It all belongs to the whole family. May the whole family be safe and happy!7\n\nIn later months, when I witnessed the indifference of some of my American compatriots toward mask wearing and stay-at-home orders and, indeed, the arrogance of those who denied the existence of the virus when tens of thousands were dying from it, I could not help pondering why. Don’t Americans conventionally and proudly talk about placing a higher value on human life than other countries, especially China? If that’s the case, why did so many people put up with the astronomical number of COVID fatalities? Was it because Americans value small individual freedoms (such as the freedom not to wear a face mask) more than human life? Or was it just that terrible political leadership caused so many Americans to doubt publichealth guidelines?8 In the face of the sacrifices made by so many ordinary people, mere attempts to theorize look rather pale. Their extraordinary experiences cannot be distilled into a few propositions without losing their sheer wealth and human touch. Their concreteness defies abstraction. My primary goal in this book is to tell the human stories in Wuhan against the background of their complex historical and social contexts.\n\n*** Recent Chinese history has seen several national disasters. The Sichuan earthquakes in 2008 caused more than 87,000 deaths and tens of thousands of injuries. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003 caused 349 deaths on the mainland and 299 deaths in Hong Kong. These disasters devastated cities and towns, wreaking havoc in the lives of\n\nPREFACE\n\n• xiii\n\nmillions. None of them, however, left the wealth of personal and social records that we have seen emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. It was nothing less than a miracle that so many people in Wuhan and other parts of China (and later the world) took it upon themselves to write about their daily lives and the lives of others. Some chronicled their experiences with audio recordings, videos, photographs, and other artistic forms. Many wrote diaries. Often shared on China’s popular social media platforms, these personal writings reached publics at home and abroad. Sociologists call these social records “personal documents,” “life records,” and “documents of life.”9 They are unparalleled primary sources for capturing the visceral and emotional dimensions of ordinary people and their daily lives. The voices in these records have a special power of their own, and I try here to tell these people’s stories in their own voices as much as I can. Only in this way is it possible to convey the grace and resilience of humanity under duress. I started my research in late January 2020, as soon as Wuhan was shut down. For hours every day, I would be glued to the web, browsing social media sites and reading the numerous accounts online. As I read them, I archived what I believe were the most valuable records of the human experiences of the Wuhan lockdown—the personal documents and life records produced by ordinary people and published and shared on social media. They came in the following varieties: • Lockdown diaries • Published interviews, oral histories, and other stories of individuals who joined volunteer networks to provide support to residents in Wuhan • Text, image, video, and audio files about everyday life and volunteerism • Postings and reader comments on WeChat, Sina Weibo, and several video-streaming sites • Poems, cartoons, and paintings about the pandemic • Media reports from both state-affiliated and commercial media • Policy documents and speeches by party leaders at local and central levels\n\nxiv • PREFACE\n\n• Transcripts of daily press conferences held locally and nationally • COVID-related communication and public announcements produced by communities and government agencies and posted on their WeChat public accounts\n\nThese records make up the primary sources for the stories I tell. The most important of these sources are the “lockdown diaries” (fengcheng riji 封城 日记) posted on WeChat, Sina Weibo, and other social media platforms. I followed a dozen diarists on these platforms, regularly searched for others using the Chinese search engine Sogou, and saved them as I read them. The term lockdown diaries was initially a specific reference to diaries about the Wuhan lockdown. As more cities were shut down in China and residents elsewhere started posting their own online diaries, lockdown diaries also came to be called pandemic diaries (yiqing riji 疫情日记). I use these two terms interchangeably. From late January to November 2020, I collected more than 6,000 diary entries, including about 500 entries written by seventeen authors from different world cities, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Vancouver, Paris, Milan, London, Philadelphia, and New York.10 Also posted on WeChat and Weibo, such overseas pandemic diaries enjoyed the same circulation as diaries produced inside China. Although the vast majority of these writings were called “diaries” by their authors, my collection also includes a sample of diary-like social media posts. These posts were put up as regularly as if the authors were keeping a conventional diary; a few authors explicitly called their social media posts “diaries.” In this sense, daily social media posts are the diaries of the social media age. For practical and methodological reasons, I conducted only a small number of remote interviews with diarists cited in this book, usually to clarify questions I had about their diaries. In practical terms, it was impossible to travel to Wuhan or China during the period I was writing this book. In methodological terms, for the stories I try to tell, diaries are a superior form of data to interviews. Although the public nature of lockdown diaries and the prevalence of internet censorship meant that their authors necessarily wrote with more caution than usual, the diaries were nevertheless products of the moment. They are the ideal documents\n\nPREFACE\n\n• xv\n\nfor understanding the visceral feelings, thoughts, and activities of the diarists caught in their own daily struggles. What they wrote about reflected the contingencies of the day. They wrote today with no idea of what was to come the next day. It is difficult for retrospective interviews to retain that sense of immediacy and urgency. Even more importantly, since COVID-19 became a pandemic and some Western politicians and media began to blame it on China, the Wuhan lockdown became and continues to be a politically touchy topic in China. Chinese official discourse attempts to produce grand narratives of triumph and bravery. Patriotic sentiments are soaring. Under these circumstances, it is hard for human subjects not to be influenced by the dominant official narratives. Their retrospective accounts may be colored by postpandemic politics. The diaries were also likely to be colored by the politics of their moment, but that is precisely the kind of politics that a historicalsociological account of the event ought to capture. Reading the diaries of Wuhan lockdown was more than a research experience; it was deeply personal. The diaries do more than shed light on the lives of the individuals who produced them. They offer insights into the social environment in which my own and my in-laws’ families in China lived. My parents never once complained to me about their stay-at-home daily routines even when the pandemic was at its worst in China. They always made light of it because they did not want me to worry about them—as is true of so many immigrants, our loved ones back in the “homeland” silently bear the emotional burdens of our diasporic living—but from the diaries and the news I read, I know how many hardships they must have been going through. The diaries helped me understand what was happening on the ground. My own stay-at-home experiences in Philadelphia would have been different without these diaries, for the stories of distant others brought me closer to my family and friends in both China and Philadelphia. Of the fifteen diarists I contacted, eight responded to my queries. Four agreed to let me use their real names in this book. The other four preferred pseudonyms. For other diarists cited in this book, I use real names if they are already well-known public figures, such as Fang Fang. Otherwise, I use pseudonyms to protect their anonymity. Both to protect diarists’ anonymity\n\nxvi • PREFACE\n\nand because many diaries have since disappeared from the web, I do not provide the original web addresses for diaries cited in this book. Instead, I have used the following citation format: So-and-So’s Diary, followed by the date of the entry—for instance, “Guo Jing’s Diary, February 7, 2020.” All translations of the diaries and social media posts quoted in this book are mine. Chinese names mentioned follow the Chinese convention of family name first, given name second. All the original social media texts, diaries, and user comments are saved in my personal archive.\n\n*** Chapter 1 documents the events in the twenty days before the lockdown, showing that a bureaucratic preoccupation with the facade of prosperity may have delayed policy responses to the coronavirus outbreak. Chapter 2 traces the structural transformation of Chinese internet culture and civil society and analyzes the longer-term conditions underlying the policy lapses in handling the pandemic. Zooming into the minutiae of a people’s war on COVID-19, chapter 3 shows how the state mobilized resources to implement policies, while citizens resorted to moral acts of cooperation and protest. Chapters 4 to 9 examine the impact of the lockdown on ordinary life and how citizens individually and collectively engaged in action or civic inaction to fight the pandemic and its secondary disasters, such as racism and discrimination. Chapter 4 takes diary writing as a parable of ordinary people’s endurance during the lockdown, showing that individuals managed daily life and personal emotions by writing and sharing online diaries. Chapter 5 offers snapshots of the lives of patients and health-care workers in hospitals, where the fire and thunder of everyday struggle came more from mundane humans than from the divine gods after which the hospitals are auspiciously named. Chapter 6 tells stories of voluntary citizen organizing, highlighting the role of women and the ubiquitous use of social media. Through a case study of an anticensorship protest, chapter 7 shows how citizens subverted censorship through the creative remixing of digital forms. If censorship aims to maintain the positive facade of the Chinese web by controlling what can or cannot appear on it, the anticensorship\n\nPREFACE\n\n• xvii\n\nprotest discussed in this chapter thwarted the censorship of a story by keeping it “alive” through an online relay. Taking on the difficult topic of nationalism, chapter 8 finds that the global spread of COVID-19 gave nationalism new wrinkles. In the face of racism abroad, old-fashioned patriotism was rekindled at home, and wolf-warrior diplomats learned the style of global populism. Chapter 9 recounts the story of Li Wenliang, a young physician who lost his life to COVID but was turned into a national martyr through virtual memorialization. It examines the narrative contestation over collective memories of the Wuhan lockdown and explores questions of digital ephemerality and permanence. As I reflect on the many stories recounted in this book, it dawns on me that they amount to a long series of dramatic scenes and characters. In the conclusion, I highlight broader themes underlying these many scenes and discuss why a “scenic” view, so to speak, promises an open, multilayered, and dialogic understanding of the Wuhan lockdown and of politics and society more broadly.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nM\n\ny first thanks go to all the lockdown diarists cited and not cited in this book. Among the cited diarists, Chu Ma 楚马, Guo Jing 郭晶, Li Xiaoyan 李晓燕, Second Uncle 二叔, Tao Tao 桃桃, Wu Shangzhe 吴尚哲 (known online as Ah-Nian 阿念), Xuan Yue 炫悦, and Ye Qing 叶青 responded to my queries about their diaries. Many other diarists could not be reached and are referred to by pseudonyms. Their lockdown diaries were not only the most valuable life documents for this study but also sources of strength for my own year-long stay-at-home life in Philadelphia. Several friends who are residents in Wuhan provided valuable help as I did my research and wrote: Dr. Wu Shiwen 吴世文 and Dr. Wang Qiong 王琼 of Wuhan University and Dr. Gu Yu 谷羽 of Hubei University. Professor Gail Hershatter and Professor Elizabeth J. Perry read the entire manuscript and offered insightful and encouraging comments for revision. I am extremely grateful to them for their longtime mentorship and support and for being such radiant models of scholarteachers. I am indebted to two anonymous reviewers for their detailed and thoughtful comments, which helped me improve the manuscript. I also thank Ruoyun Bai, Thomas Chen, Bingchun Meng, Elaine Yuan, and Mengyang Zhao for sharing their thoughts and feedback on parts of the manuscript.\n\nxx • ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nPreliminary ideas in parts of this book were presented at a virtual talk at Zhejiang University at the invitation of Professor Wu Fei 吴飞, at a virtual roundtable discussion organized by Professor Jack Qiu of the National University of Singapore, and at a symposium organized by Professor Zhongdang Pan of the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Professor Wei Lu 韦路 of Zhejiang University.

Scholars at the Social Science Research Council, especially Michael Miller, Alondra Nelson, and Jason Rhody, invited me to contribute an essay to its Mediated Crisis series and gave me an opportunity to write about lockdown diaries in Wuhan. At the University of Pennsylvania, colleagues in the Annenberg School, the Department of Sociology, the Center for the Study of Contemporary China, Penn Global, and Perry World House have been supportive of my work in more ways than I can mention here. I especially thank Dean John Jackson at the Annenberg School, Dean Steven Fluharty of the School of Arts and Sciences, and Associate Dean Emily Hannum of the School of Arts and Sciences for their unwavering support. For intellectual, professional, and moral support, I am grateful to Rosemary Clark-Parsons, Jacques deLisle, Irmo Elo, Jasmine Erdener, Elisabetta Ferrari, Amy Gadsden, Avery Goldstein, Yue Hou, Klaus Krippendorf, Annette Lareau, Neysun Mahboubi, Scott Moore, Emilio Parrado, Monroe Price, Joseph Turow, Barbie Zelizer, and Tukufu Zuberi. In tracking down references, Sharon Black and Min Zhong at the Library of the Annenberg School provided help in the most timely fashion. I am indebted to all the superb staff at the Annenberg School for their help and support but especially to Richard Cardona, Margie Chavez, Elizabeth Cooper, Alison Feather, Altagracia Felix, Kelly Fernandez, Emma Fleming, Marley Goldschmidt, Rose Halligan, Patricia Lindner, Joanne Murray, Deborah Porter, Julie Sloane, Andres Spillari, and Ashton Yount.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n• xxi\n\nMy research and writing benefited from conversations with many PhD students at the University of Pennsylvania, especially students in my two doctoral seminars in the 2020–2021 academic year, The Performance Society and Qualitative Ways of Knowing. Special thanks are owed to Pris Stephanie Nasrat for introducing me to the literature on critical aunty studies and to Haolin (Angela) Deng, Victoria Zhang, and Kyle (K. C.) Legacion for their valuable research assistance. I thank Clare Foster and Ruichen Zhang for inviting me to contribute an article, “Online Lockdown Diaries as Endurance Art,” to their guest-edited special issue of AI & Society (https://doi.org /10.1007/s00146-020-01141-5), which gave me the opportunity to explore the meaning of endurance in lockdown diaries. Parts of the article are incorporated into chapter 4 in this book. I am most grateful to Gan Junchao 甘俊超 for permission to use his photograph on the book cover. I am honored to publish a third book with Columbia University Press. Colleagues there, especially Jennifer Crewe, associate provost and director of the press, have long supported my work. I am deeply indebted to Eric Schwartz and Lowell Frye, who showed enthusiasm for this project early on and shepherded it through the review and publication processes with great skill and good humor. I am most grateful to my copyeditor Annie Barva for her superb editing of the manuscript and to my supervising editor Michael Haskell for helping to keep the production on schedule. Lisa Hamm was most helpful on matters of design and art used in this book. I alone am responsible for any flaws this book may have. I owe my deepest gratitude to my families in China and Philadelphia. My parents, siblings, and in-laws in China are exemplars in managing the hardships of the COVID pandemic. They are my heroes. My brother, Xinbin, always a sharp observer of China’s media scene, queried me often as I worked on this manuscript. My wife, Lan, has always been the strongest supporter of all my writing projects, but I owe her even more than ever for her love, care, and sacrifice as I worked on this book. She felt more acutely than I the extreme stress of the pandemic—when we were unable to go out as we used to, I could at least devote my time to writing. We were lucky that our son, Jeff, was around much of the time, on the phone when not in person. His good humor brightened our days.\n\n1 FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nAPOCALYPSE Guo Jing 郭晶 is a social worker and feminist activist. In 2017, Guo started a legal-aid hotline for female professionals who were victims of workplace discrimination. She wrote seventy-six diary entries spanning the seventy-six days of the Wuhan lockdown.1 In one of them, she wrote that she had just moved to Wuhan in November 2019 and did not have many friends there. I first read her diary postings on a WeChat public account run by a friend of hers. The first four days of her diary, January 23–26, 2020, appeared as one long essay under the title “The Diary of a Woman Who Lives Alone in the Locked-Down City of Wuhan.” The essay has more than 100,000 views, the sign of a viral posting on WeChat. Her entries from January 27 to 29 were posted under the title “Rediscovering My Place in an Isolated City,” and those from January 30 to February 1 were under “Living with a Sense of Helplessness.” Guo Jing’s diary postings in the first days of the lockdown convey her reactions to the lockdown and the sense of apocalypse she felt. January 23, 2020: “When I got up this morning and saw news of the lockdown, I was at a loss what to do. I couldn’t anticipate what this would all mean, how long the lockdown would last, and what preparations I should make.”2 January 24, 2020:\n\n2 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nThe world is so quiet it’s scary. I live alone. It’s only from the occasional sound in the corridor of the building that I can make sure there are still people around. I have a lot of time to think about how to survive. I have no resources or social networks within the establishment. If I’m ill, I will be as unlikely as many other ordinary people to receive medical treatment. Therefore, one of my goals is not to let myself get sick. I must persevere in doing physical exercise. To survive, I will need the necessary food, and therefore I must find out about the supply situation of daily necessities. . . . Therefore, today, I went out.3\n\nJanuary 27, 2020: “Today the weather was a bit clearer, but still cloudy. After walking for only a few steps outside, I saw two cats on a pile of debris. We stared at each other. This scene has such a strong sense of apocalypse. When we stared at each other, it seemed as if there were only me and the two cats left in this world.”4 As Guo Jing’s diary attests, the initial period of the lockdown in Wuhan was full of apocalyptic scenes that were recorded in diaries, videos, photographs, drawings, and social media postings. Guo’s friend Xiao Meili 肖美丽, also a feminist activist, documented some of the bestknown and most tragic scenes in a series of ink-and-water paintings that she posted on Sina Weibo. On February 12, 2020, she posted a painting of a ninety-year-old woman named Xu Meiwu 徐美武 sitting next to the bed of her sixty-four-year-old son, who was seriously ill with the coronavirus and was on a ventilator in an ICU. Xiao Meili’s annotation on this painting used Xu Meiwu’s own words: “After I got to the hospital, I found there was no bed vacancy at all. We could only see the doctor. The crowds were like mountains and oceans. People rubbed against one another. I stood in a line for my son’s CT test, and our number [in the queue] was 297. I remember this number clearly because it gave me a feeling of despair.”5 Xiao wrote in her Weibo posting that it must have been extremely painful for the elderly woman to stand in a long line for her son, yet the mainstream media were praising her for her motherly love. Xiao commented: “I feel such praise is very cruel. . . . Instead of praising her struggling\n\nFESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\n• 3\n\nin hardships out of great motherly love, what is more important is that we should ask whose responsibility it is to put disadvantaged individuals like her in such difficult situations?”6 Descriptions of painful scenes like this one are sometimes mixed with stories of absurdities that could be imaginable only in a time of apocalypse. Long lists of such absurdities circulated online: “An elderly man wearing a mask was playing [the Russian song] ‘Katyusha’ on his accordion while taking a night walk in the street.” “ ‘Help! Help!’ A woman on a balcony was knocking on a wash basin while crying out for help.” “Unable to say good-bye, a daughter ran after a vehicle that was taking away her dead mother.” “A vehicle drove right up to a warehouse and picked up a box of face masks for some [privileged] leaders. A long line of medical workers had waited there for hours to receive their face masks.” “A truck driver [with a Hubei license plate], finding himself blocked wherever he tried to go, had to live on the highway for twenty days.” “My relative died in the afternoon and so opened up a hospital bed. Please contact that hospital to give it a try.”\n\nEach of these lines contains a dramatic story—tragic, inspiring, painful. Such scenes of the pandemic in Wuhan kept people such as Xiao Meili wondering: What happened? How did the apocalypse come about?\n\nTHE ANONYMOUS EIGHT The year 2020 opened with a piece of news about eight individuals being punished for spreading “untruthful information.” Only in retrospect did this news seem to take on ominous overtones. The Public Security Department in Wuhan posted the news on Sina Weibo at 5:38 p.m. on January 1, 2020. The short message stated that some medical institutions in Wuhan had recently treated multiple cases of pneumonia, about which the Wuhan\n\n4 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nMunicipal Health Commission had issued a public notice. Yet some wangmin 网民, or netizens,7 published or retweeted information on social media without verifying its truthfulness, for which they had been “dealt with according to the law.”8 One of the eight was Dr. Li Wenliang 李文亮 at Wuhan Central Hospital. The news was reprinted in local and national newspapers and broadcast on national television. Xinhua News Agency reprinted the story just three hours later, at 8:39 p.m. The Xinhua story also reported that all of the cases of pneumonia had a history of contact with the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, no human-to-human transmission had been found, and no health-care workers had been infected.9 This news sounded a note of warning and reassurance: it warned people about the consequences of transmitting “untruthful information” on the internet; it reassured the public that the novel cases of pneumonia in Wuhan were not contagious. Thus, between January 1 and January 20, life in Wuhan went on as usual. The city of 11 million remained in a festive mood, first celebrating the Gregorian New Year’s Day and then preparing for the Lunar New Year’s Day—the biggest festival of the year. On January 3, Mr. Mei, a retired high-school teacher in Wuhan, walked to a restaurant near his home and paid a deposit of RMB 500 (approximately U.S.$80) for his Lunar New Year family dinner. His family had an annual tradition of gathering for dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve, and he had booked two tables more than two months earlier. On January 10, Mr. Mei attended a lunch gathering hosted by the first class of junior-high students he taught. These students had a tradition of holding a social gathering on January 10 every year. On January 17, Mr. Mei visited the city library to return and borrow books. “I recently heard a coronavirus pneumonia is occurring, but people say it is controllable and does not transmit from people to people,” he wrote in his diary on January 17.10 On January 20, Mr. Mei went to a hospital to see a good friend whose wife was hospitalized. He saw her illness written on her name card—pneumonia. Seeing doctors in white protective gear worried Mr. Mei. That afternoon he sensed a sudden change of atmosphere. Panic and fear were everywhere. In the evening, his relatives called and urged him to cancel the family’s dinner plan, which he did reluctantly. It was only later that Mr. Mei learned that\n\nFESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\n• 5\n\nthe abrupt change in atmosphere on January 20 was caused by Dr. Zhong Nanshan’s 钟南山 public acknowledgment that the novel pneumonia could be transmitted from human to human.11 Dr. Zhong is China’s Dr. Fauci and four years older. Already a revered national hero known for his role in fighting the SARS crisis in 2003, he headed the Senior Experts Team of the National Health Commission, which had been dispatched to investigate the virus situation in Wuhan. It was after the investigation that he warned that the novel coronavirus was infectious. Dr. Zhong’s public warning sounded the alarm of a public-health crisis and was a critical factor in the decision to shut down Wuhan. Later in 2020, he would be awarded the highest civilian honor in China for his role in fighting COVID: the Order of the Republic. Ms. Spring started keeping a diary by accident. January 12 was her husband’s birthday, but she forgot it. After her husband reminded her of it, she wrote about the episode in a diary. She continued writing after the lockdown started and did not stop until May 17. By that time, she had posted 123 entries on WeChat. According to the short bio at the end of each of her diary entries, Ms. Spring is a Wuhan native, a member of the Hubei Poetry Society, and a writer. On January 13, a friend of hers who worked in a hospital told her that multiple cases of an unknown pneumonia had occurred in the South China Seafood Market. Her friend reminded her to wear a face mask when going outside. On television, she saw Xinhua News Agency reporting that China had shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus with the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, but WHO did not at that time recommend imposing travel and trade restrictions on China. On January 14, Ms. Spring was relieved to see that according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission’s public notice, there were no new cases of coronavirus and no new deaths. “It does look like there is no humanto-human transmission,” she wrote. After breakfast, her husband’s brother called from Huanggang to tell them that her mother-in-law had passed away. She and her husband packed quickly, and her daughter drove them to her husband’s home village in Huanggang. Upon returning to Wuhan on January 20, she sensed a different atmosphere. People were wearing face masks. Her daughter told her to be careful, but Ms. Spring wrote: “I don’t think much of it because I heard that only two days ago Baibuting just held\n\n6 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nits ten-thousand-family meal. Some places are still holding their Spring Festival gala shows. I still do grocery shopping and go out for walks as usual.”12\n\nTOFU REPRESENTS POVERTY The ten-thousand-family meal, wanjia yan 万家宴, in Baibuting Community has a twenty-year history. It takes place annually, a week before the Lunar New Year. In 2020, it fell on January 18. About 40,000 people reportedly attended the event at nine designated venues of the Baibuting Community. In an anonymous interview with the press, a staff member of a residential community in Baibuting revealed that they had recommended canceling the scheduled event out of concern about the new pneumonia, but community leaders rejected the recommendation.13 The event was held as scheduled with great fanfare. The extensive coverage it received in local and national news suggests that so much organization and preparation had gone into the planning of the event that canceling it would cost the community a carefully orchestrated media spectacle. A story in the national newspaper Guangming Daily (光明日报) conveys a sense of the spectacle and its political symbolism. The story reports that the event was officially called “Strive in a New Age to Realize the Dream of Moderate Wealth” (奋斗新时代梦圆小康年). This theme was apparently chosen to echo the main national political slogan of this year, which was to achieve the “full establishment of a moderately wealthy society.” The article notes that residents of the community contributed 13,986 dishes in its nine venues. One dish was called “The Motherland Is a Garden Full of Spring, People’s Life Is Getting Better and Better.” It featured tomatoes carved into flowers to symbolize springtime garden flowers and cucumbers carved into bamboolike shapes to symbolize higher and higher living standards.14 Another dish was called “Targeted Poverty Alleviation.” The tofu in it represented poverty because it is as “white as a sheet of blank paper,” a proverbial phrase for utter poverty. Yet the fish and shrimp in the dish symbolized moderate wealth. This dish symbolized the achievement of\n\nFESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\n• 7\n\n“moderate wealth” and the overcoming of poverty. As the media scholar Qian Gang points out, “Chinese leaders do not pass the New Year and the Chinese Spring Festival in the way that ordinary people do. For them, these events are a political stage for the coming year.” One of President Xi Jinping’s priorities for 2020 was to “loudly proclaim China’s success in reaching the ‘full establishment of a moderately wealthy society.’ ”15 Qian’s analysis of the editorial pages in the People’s Daily (人民日报) and in several local Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspapers shows that the priority of official media coverage in the initial twenty days of January was precisely that. The ten-thousand-family meal was clearly a spectacle with symbolic meaning. Baibuting, its name literally meaning “One-Hundred-Step Pavilion” (百步亭), is no ordinary community. A national banner of grassroots community governance, it is divided into twenty-seven gated residential communities with a population of about 140,000. Over the years, it has won numerous accolades as a national model of community governance. In the two months leading up to the gigantic community meal on January 18, for example, numerous events took place in Baibuting that attested to its national fame. In mid-November 2019, the Baibuting Community conducted a training program for fifty-seven community workers from Beijing to teach them the “advanced experiences in community governance.”16 On November 23, 2019, a vice minister of the Central United Front and party secretary of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce visited Baibuting Community.17 On December 2, 2019, a thousand people attended a ceremony to celebrate the community police station, which had recently been selected as one of the nation’s top-one-hundred police stations.18 On December 4, 2019, Baibuting Community proudly posted a story about its director, Wang Bo, who had just been featured on prime-time national television as one of the “most beautiful urban and rural community workers” selected nationally. The posting had a link to China Central Television’s (CCTV) ten-minute video about Ms. Wang. It seems as if every week Baibuting Community attracted some important visitors or made national news. A ten-thousand-family meal organized by such a famous community would surely make national news again, as indeed it did. The anticipated publicity would be too dear a loss if the event were canceled.\n\n8 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nWhen the spectacle made national news this time, however, it raised alarm. In her diary entry on January 20, Fang Fang commented on the Baibuting Community meal: “I feel that while the ‘Wuhan pneumonia’ is still spreading, for a community to hold such a large gathering is tantamount to criminal behavior. No matter how they like formalism and enjoy showing off the peace of a prosperous age, the municipal government should forbid such gatherings and parties.”19 Because of the continued festivities, when news of community contagion came, it caused more anger than surprise. On February 5, 2020, national news reported a high infection rate in Baibuting Community, suggesting that the festive event may have contributed to the spread of the disease. When Fang Fang blamed this behavior on a culture of formalism, she was attacking one of the most insidious problems in Chinese politics. “Formalism” may not be the best English translation of the Chinese term xingshi zhuyi 形式主义, which literally means “obsession with form or with the appearance of things.” This obsession with appearance often comes at the expense of substance or reality, sometimes with disastrous consequences. The community transmission of COVID-19 was partly the result of this obsession with appearance. The various manifestations of this formalism at different stages of the war on COVID-19 will become clear in later chapters.\n\nTHE WUHAN MUNICIPAL HEALTH COMMISSION’S FIRST PUBLIC NOTICE The Baibuting celebration was only one of many large festive gatherings that took place in January. On January 17, Wuhan’s municipal tourism bureau proudly announced a giveaway of 200,000 tickets to major tourist attractions in the city. On January 21, two days before the lockdown, party and government leaders in Hubei province, headed by provincial party boss Jiang Chaoliang, attended a Lunar New Year gala performance. The Lunar New Year is the most important national holiday; universities, government agencies, and business companies celebrate by holding gala performances.\n\nFESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\n• 9\n\nWhat was surprising about the gala performance for the Hubei provincial leaders was that it was held the day following Dr. Zhong’s public warning that the coronavirus was transmissible among humans. As party leaders were busy celebrating, residents were shopping and preparing for family celebrations. Wuhan is a national transportation hub because of its unique geographical location. Large numbers of travelers were leaving or returning to Wuhan for the long holiday. Millions passed through Wuhan on their way back home for the festival. Wuhan’s mayor acknowledged at a press conference later that 5 million people had left Wuhan in the short period before the lockdown. All this hustle and bustle created a festive mood, an appearance of joy and prosperity. Renao 热闹, “hot and noisy,” are the Chinese words used to describe such atmospheres. No Chinese holiday is worth its name without an atmosphere of renao. Wuhan was appropriately renao and seemed well prepared to greet the Lunar New Year. When it was announced on the night of January 22 that the city would be locked down starting the following morning, the news shook Wuhan and the world. It was Wuhan’s Pearl Harbor moment, only this attack was coming from an invisible virus. The coronavirus disease had already been known to medical professionals in several hospitals and to public-health authorities in Wuhan in December 2019. But the public was not informed. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission initially prohibited public dissemination of the information. When it did start issuing public notices on its website, the notices were misleading. According to an article by Chinese scientists in The Lancet on January 24, 2020, the first patient with symptoms of what would later be known as COVID-19 was traced to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan. The person did not have a history of visiting the South China Seafood Market, the alleged source of the spread of the disease. On December 8, 2019, a man was diagnosed with an unidentified form of pneumonia in Wuhan Central Hospital. He was the owner of a fruit stall inside the South China Seafood Market. On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Wuhan Xinhua Hospital received four patients with an unknown pneumonia. The next day she reported these cases to hospital administrators, who in turn made a report to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of Jianghan District in Wuhan.20\n\n10 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nOn December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, the top-level government agency in charge of public-health affairs in Wuhan, issued its first public notice about the coronavirus disease on its website. It stated that twenty-seven cases of an unknown pneumonia had been found, all related to the South China Seafood Market. Seven of these twenty-seven patients were in severe condition. The notice also stated that the main symptoms of this pneumonia were fever, breathing difficulties, and invasive lung lesions. It concluded, “It is believed that these are cases of viral pneumonia. The investigations thus far did not find evidence of human-tohuman transmission or the infection of medical personnel.”21 Just the day before, on December 30, however, the Health Commission had issued an urgent internal notice that prohibited anyone in the health system from disclosing any information related to the coronavirus disease without authorization.\n\nTHE CENSURING OF PHYSICIANS IN WUHAN HOSPITALS Insider stories that surfaced after the lockdown suggest that several doctors had treated patients with a novel pneumonia. A diagnosis report leaked online indicated it was a “SARS-like coronavirus.” Dr. Ai Fen 艾芬, head of the Emergency Department of Wuhan Central Hospital, saw this diagnosis on December 30 when a colleague in the Department of Respiratory Diseases in her hospital showed it to her. The diagnosis noted that the patient had contracted a “SARS-like coronavirus.” Dr. Ai reported this situation to the Public Health Department in her hospital as well as to the head of the Department of Respiratory Diseases. Later that day, she shared the report with a former classmate, having marked the phrase “SARS-like coronavirus” in red. According to an interview with the popular magazine People (人物), this was the diagnosis report that Dr. Li Wenliang shared in his WeChat circles. Li Wenliang would later be known as the “whistleblower of COVID-19” and would die of COVID on February 7, 2020.\n\nFESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\n• 11\n\nLi had started his job as an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital in 2014. In an interview with the popular business newspaper Caixin (财 新) on January 31, 2020, Li recalled that at 5:48 p.m. on December 30, 2019, he had posted a message to a WeChat group of about 150 people, all of whom were former medical school classmates. Screenshots of his WeChat message show that his posting contained the following remarks: “The most recent news is that the coronavirus has been confirmed. . . . Please do not communicate this information beyond this group. Let your families and kinsfolk take precautions.” He also posted a doctor’s diagnosis based on a CT scan (with the patient’s name redacted).22 Dr. Xie Linka 谢琳卡 worked in Wuhan Union Hospital, another main hospital later designated to treat COVID patients in Wuhan. In her interview with Caixin, Xie revealed that at 8:48 p.m. on December 30, 2019, she posted a message in one of her WeChat groups, warning its 443 members about an unidentified pneumonia: “Don’t go to the South China Seafood Market nowadays. Multiple people there have come down with an unidentified pneumonia (similar to SARS). Today our hospital treated multiple patients of pneumonia from the South China Seafood Market. Please be careful and wear masks and have adequate ventilation.”23 Screenshots of both Li’s and Xie’s WeChat messages were circulated on social media. What happened to the three doctors afterward are stunning instances of the suppression of personal expression. In her interview with People published on March 10, 2020, Ai Fen revealed that at 10:20 p.m. on December 30, 2019, she received a message from her hospital about the Wuhan Health Commission’s urgent notice prohibiting people from disclosing information about the coronavirus (see more of Ai Fen’s story in chapter 7).24 Then at around midnight on January 1, Ai received a message from the head of the hospital’s Department of Supervision requesting a meeting with her the following morning. At the meeting, in Ai’s own words, I was reprimanded in such a way as never happened before and never as seriously. . . . I was asked to tell the 200-plus staff in my department one by one verbally—not by WeChat or messaging, but only face to face or by phone—not to say anything related to this pneumonia, not even to one’s own husband. I completely blanked out. He didn’t chastise me\n\n12 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nbecause I didn’t work hard enough, but he sounded as if I had singlehandedly ruined the wonderful situation of Wuhan’s development. I had a feeling of utter despair.25\n\nAi was so crushed that she never mentioned the coronavirus disease to anyone again. She was silenced. She did not even tell her husband about this incident until January 20, 2020, when it became public information that the unidentified form of pneumonia was indeed an infectious coronavirus. Ai’s colleague Li Wenliang was also questioned by the hospital’s Department of Supervision about his WeChat posts. On January 3, Li was summoned to the Wuchang District Police Station to sign a “letter of warning.” The signed letter has since been leaked online. It warned Li about the following “illegal activity”: “On December 30, 2019, on WeChat group [redacted] published untruthful information about seven diagnosed cases of SARS related to the South China Seafood Market.” Below this were the following words of warning: According to law, with respect to your illegal act of publishing untruthful information on the internet, this letter serves as a warning and a reprimand. Your behavior has seriously violated social order. Your behavior has gone beyond the limit permitted by law. It is a violation of articles as set out in the Public Security Administration Punishments Law of the People’s Republic of China. It is an illegal act! The Public Security Bureau hopes that you will cooperate with our work, heed the warnings of the police and stop any illegal activity. Can you do that? Answer: Yes. We hope you will calm down and carefully think it over. We solemnly warn you: If you stubbornly adhere to your own views and continue to engage in illegal activities without repenting and reforming yourself, you will be punished by the law. Do you understand? Answer: Understood.26\n\nXie Linka was questioned by the Propaganda Department of her own hospital and received a phone call from the police. The police officer did not\n\nFESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\n• 13\n\nask her to sign anything but verbally warned her “not to spread unverified information.”27 The Wuhan Public Security Department’s announcement on Weibo on January 1, 2020, about the disciplining of eight individuals for spreading “unverified information” stated: “The internet is not beyond law. Information and speech published online must abide by laws and regulations. The police department will investigate and punish illegal acts of making up, spreading, and disseminating rumors and disrupting social order. It exercises zero tolerance. We hope that all netizens will follow laws and regulations and refuse to make up, believe, or spread rumors and [will] work together to build a harmonious, clear, and bright cyberspace.”28 When Ai’s superior reprimanded her, she was made to feel that she had “singlehandedly ruined the wonderful situation of Wuhan’s development.” Now the police were calling on all netizens to “work together to build a harmonious, clear, and bright cyberspace.” As will become clear in the next chapter, “clear and bright cyberspace” was the key phrase in a comprehensive strategy of internet censorship under the Xi Jinping leadership. With this rhetoric, we can begin to zero in on the deeper causes of the delayed responses to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nTHE WUHAN HEALTH COMMISSION’S ERRATIC BEHAVIOR At first glance, the behavior of the Wuhan Health Commission was erratic. After its first statement on December 31, 2019, it did not issue any new notice until January 3. This new notice stated that a total of forty-four cases of an unidentified pneumonia had been “found,” but “preliminary investigations show that there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, nor has any medical personnel been found to be infected.”29 Its next notice, issued on January 5, announced that a total of fifty-nine cases of an unidentified pneumonia had been “reported.” Of these, seven were in serious condition. The earliest case of the disease had occurred on December 12. The notice repeated its earlier statement that “preliminary investigations\n\n14 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nshow that there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, nor has any medical personnel been found to be infected.”30 The Health Commission issued no public announcements from January 6 to January 10. Its next notice was posted on January 11, 2020. For the first time, it acknowledged that the unidentified pneumonia was confirmed to be a novel coronavirus and reported that preliminary diagnoses had confirmed forty-one cases of novel coronavirus (the previous fifty-nine cases had been called an “unidentified pneumonia”), which included one death, seven serious cases, and two patients who had checked out of the hospital. It also stated that there were 739 close contacts, 41 of whom were medical personnel, yet “no medical personnel have been infected, and there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.”31 After the rather disconcerting report of forty-one confirmed cases of a novel coronavirus and 739 close contacts, the Health Commission’s daily press releases from January 12 to 16 reported that no more new cases had been found. Later it would turn out that new cases of coronavirus had in fact appeared in that period. The twenty-nine-year-old doctor Xia Sisi 夏思思, who died of coronavirus on February 23, was infected by a patient who had been diagnosed with coronavirus on January 14.32 Why was that case not reported? What happened? It was not until January 18 that the Health Commission reported four new cases and 763 close contacts. The January 18 notice also mentioned that Thailand and Japan each had identified a case of coronavirus and that both cases had originated in Wuhan, but the news release no longer mentioned whether there was human-to-human transmission.33 Then on January 20, Zhong Nanshan acknowledged at a press conference that the novel coronavirus was indeed contagious and that fifteen medical personnel had already been infected.34 This was the first public acknowledgment that the novel coronavirus could be transmitted between humans. Yet in the twenty days between December 31, 2019, and January 20, 2020, precious opportunities had been lost to curtail the spread of the disease.35 Chinese media interviews with physicians such as Li, Ai, and Xie point to a possible cover-up. It is less clear who was responsible for the cover-up and why. There were two information lacunae in January: a lack of public statements from the Health Commission from January 6 to January 10 and,\n\nFESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\n• 15\n\nafter a report of forty-one cases of a novel coronavirus on January 11, the reporting of no new cases in the commission’s public notices from January 12 to January 16. At a press conference on January 27, 2020, Wuhan’s mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted, “We haven’t disclosed information in a timely manner and also did not use effective information to improve our work.”36 He did not explain what caused the delay.\n\nTHE “TWO CONGRESSES” IN WUHAN AND HUBEI One possible proximate cause of the delay had to do with timing. It was the season of the Lunar New Year festival, a time for family reunions and celebrations and a time for exchanging New Year greetings. A public announcement about an epidemic outbreak would halt all these festive activities, as it did when the lockdown was finally announced, and could potentially trigger chaos and public panic. The unfortunate timing of the outbreak had another wrinkle to it in Wuhan. The two weeks before the Lunar New Year were also the time of the so-called two congresses (lianghui 两会)—that is, the annual congresses of China’s legislative body, the National People’s Congress, and of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. The two institutions consist of multiple levels of assemblies, from the national assembly down to the provincial, municipal, and district assemblies. Each municipal assembly elects delegates to the provincial assembly, which then elects delegates to the National Congress. The two congresses at the municipal level in Wuhan took place January 6–10, followed by the two provincial-level congresses January 11–18. Thus, four major meetings took place in Wuhan January 6–18, coinciding with the gaps in public announcements about the coronavirus from the Wuhan Health Commission. Major local media channels, such as Changjiang Daily (长江日报) and Hubei Daily (湖北日报), covered these congresses but made no mention of the epidemic. The media scholar Qian Gang finds that fourteen of the twenty front pages of the Hubei Daily from January 1\n\n16 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nto January 20 were identical reprints of the front pages of the People’s Daily. Qian’s analysis of the People’s Daily in the first twenty days of January 2020 shows that the priorities of party media dovetailed with Xi Jinping’s three priorities for 2020: to proclaim the successful achievement of “a moderately wealthy society”; to highlight Xi Jinping’s core foreign-policy program, the Belt and Road Initiative; and to boost’s Xi’s image as a “people’s leader” on a par with Mao by displaying photographs of him among the people.37 Fang Fang wrote about the “two congresses” in her diary posting on March 18, 2020. Continuing her call for investigations into the delayed responses to the COVID outbreak, she argued that many different factors must have worked together to cause the delay and that therefore investigations should start when people’s memories of the events were still fresh. A friend had reminded her that the transitional period from winter to early spring was always a season for infectious diseases, yet the two congresses were always held in this season. This prompted Fang Fang to share her own experience as a former delegate, noting that it had long been the case for media to shun negative news during the two congresses: “Frankly speaking, in Hubei, I began attending the two congresses in 1993. I attended the provincial People’s Congress and then the Political Consultative Conference for twenty-five years. I know too well the state of affairs immediately before and after the two congresses. To ensure that the two congresses can proceed smoothly, the media are prohibited to cover any negative news. And during that period, in all the government departments almost no one was doing any work because their bosses were attending the two congresses.”38 Fang Fang then remarked that things were the same this time: The Municipal Health Commission stopped reporting the number of infected cases. The timing was almost exactly aligned with the two congresses. This was not a coincidence. It was not intended as such either. It was just habitual behavior. This habit was not formed in the past few years. It has been there for many years. For many years, the various departments just postpone their business until after the two congresses. For many years, to guarantee that the two congresses proceed smoothly, the media cover only good news, never bad news. Cadres, journalists, leaders, and even citizens have all become used to this.39\n\nFESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\n• 17\n\nThe implication was that local authorities in Wuhan and Hubei could be directly responsible for covering up the spread of COVID. An internal report prepared by U.S. intelligence agencies supports this view. According to a New York Times story in mid-August 2020, “The report adds to a body of evidence that shows how the malfeasance of local Chinese officials appeared to be a decisive factor in the spread of the virus within Wuhan and beyond.”40 The Times story implies that local officials withheld information from Beijing for fear of reprisal but offers no further explanation. Based on her experience with the two congresses, Fang Fang reasoned that the Municipal Health Commission stopped reporting the number of infected cases during the two congresses in Wuhan not necessarily because there was a deliberate cover-up but because the omission of negative news was habitual bureaucratic behavior during the two congresses. The political scientist Yongshun Cai might view this conduct as a form of “irresponsible state behavior,” which occurs when state agents make policy decisions “for the self-serving purpose of image enhancement, with little concern for the economic costs or other negative outcomes of their decisions.” Although such behavior is not unique to Chinese bureaucracies, Cai argues that the Chinese political system creates incentive and opportunity for it: “Due to a political arrangement that does not establish a clear link between irresponsible decisions and punishment, cadres often do not incur great risk when engaging in irresponsible activities.”41 Despite the unknown and uncertain elements of a new epidemic, the early signs of it were serious enough to warrant warning the public. The twenty-day delay in informing the public was irresponsible state behavior, to say the least. In this case, however, the reason was less image enhancement than image management. It was more about bureaucrats controlling potential damage to their image at a time when that image was at its apex. One diarist conjectured, for example, that 2019 had been such a good year for Wuhan that the party leaders there were expecting promotions and a boost in their careers.42 It was a good year because Wuhan had just had a series of celebrations in 2019 to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Its successful hosting of the Military World Games from October 18 to October 27, 2019, had given Wuhan global publicity. Immediately following the Military Games,\n\n18 • FESTIVITIES, INTERRUPTED\n\nthe fourth plenary of the CCP Nineteenth National Congress convened in Beijing, which issued a communiqué exalting the advantages of China’s political and governance system.43 With all these major events from 2019 in the background, the two congresses in Wuhan in mid-January 2020 were occasions for celebrating a year’s accomplishments. It was the worst possible time to report an epidemic outbreak. After the SARS epidemic in 2003, China established national earlywarning systems for reporting infectious diseases. In 2008, the China Infectious Disease Automated-Alert and Response System was established to harness the power of the internet and mobile phones for rapid reporting of and warning about infectious diseases. Billed as the largest such system in the world, it technically allows grassroots medical facilities such as hospitals to enter information into the system for China’s national CDC to receive that information in real time.44 Although it seemed to have worked well for the 2012–2014 period,45 it failed miserably this time around. According to an investigative report by China Youth Daily (中国青年报), cases of the coronavirus were indeed reported to the national CDC in early January. After mid-January, however, the reporting stopped “for unknown reasons.” Although the national early-warning system requires direct online reporting of an infectious-disease event, beginning in mid-January hospitals in Wuhan were told not to report cases without prior approval from the provincial Health Commission.46 Exactly why the system was not used remains a mystery. Scholars have argued that the outbreak of the SARS epidemic in 2003 was caused by administrative failures. Besides the lack of transparency, there were incentives for local bureaucrats to underreport SARS cases.47 Therefore, establishing national early-warning systems but not fixing flaws in the administration of that system means that it probably will not work. Wuhan was ultimately locked down on January 23. WHO declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” on January 30, 2020, named it “COVID-19” on February 11, and declared it a global pandemic on March 11.48\n\n2 ROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\nCHINESE SOCIETY IN 2011 A tightened political environment hostile to free expression was responsible for the silencing of early whistle-blowers of COVID-19 in Wuhan. How did this political environment come about? Although it had no definite and unambiguous origin, notable changes began to be introduced after Xi Jinping became the CCP’s general secretary in November 2012. These changes were so wide ranging that they cumulatively impaired the conditions for open speech. This is not to say that there was no dissent or critical thinking, but the drum of dominant ideological discourses was loud enough to suppress or drown out alternative voices. Nor did Xi’s politics represent a complete break with the past. There were many continuities, and some of the new developments were policy responses to a preexisting crisis of governance. But Xi went further than his predecessors in the changes he introduced to politics, society, and media cultures. Political uncertainties and even dangers loomed for the Chinese regime in 2011, the year before Xi Jinping became the top CCP leader. It was the year of the Arab Spring revolutions. In January 2011, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia fled his country. On February 19, barely ten days after President Hosni Mubarak of\n\n20 • ROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\nEgypt was forced from office by revolutionary insurgents, anonymous calls for a jasmine revolution in China appeared on overseas Chinese websites. In response, party authorities acted preemptively by rounding up prominent dissidents and installing heavy police presence.1 The strong reactions revealed the anxieties of CCP leaders. Their anxieties had multiple sources. After the scandal of the melaminetainted milk powder in 2008,2 the urban middle class had lived in worry about food safety. Many people saw the root cause of food-safety problems as a failure in party governance. Other social concerns included rising food prices, unstoppable housing prices, unemployment, and growing costs for medical care and education. A crisis of trust plagued public institutions. Barely a year after the melamine milk scandal in 2008, China passed its first food-safety law, and yet just as the new law came into effect, melaminetainted milk powder resurfaced on the market in early 2010.3 Clearly, the problem was systemic, and patching up potholes here and there was no longer an option. China’s political system was riddled with deep ruts. Party leaders wanted to tackle these problems. To gauge public sentiments, Premier Wen Jiabao went online three times to interact with netizens, an unprecedented action.4 New laws and policies were also introduced to tackle the issues. On May 30, 2011, Xi’s immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao, chaired a Politburo meeting to discuss how to strengthen social management. Soon afterward, on July 5, the CCP issued a policy document about innovating social management. The message was clear: the party was having trouble handling all of the social problems China was experiencing and must innovate its methods of governance. There were other uncertainties. With Hu Jintao’s term coming to an end, a successor was due to be selected in 2012. Fierce elite negotiations and a power shuffle took place in 2011. On February 6, 2012, the elite power struggle spilled into public view when Wang Lijun, deputy mayor and police chief in the city of Chongqing, shocked the world by entering the U.S. consulate in Chengdu to seek protection (although he was turned back to Chinese authorities the following day). Wang Lijun was the right-hand man of Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing and Xi Jinping’s rival for the top CCP position. Soon afterward, on March 15, 2012, Bo Xilai was removed from office and tried and sentenced to life in prison in 2013 for bribery, graft, and abuse of power.\n\nROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\n• 21\n\nIn this roiling political season, Chinese cyberspace was full of riotous and contentious activities. That was the internet that Xi would set out to tame after 2012. On July 23, 2011, a high-speed train crashed near the city of Wenzhou, causing forty deaths. The Ministry of Railways came under public attack because of the way it handled or, rather, mishandled the disaster. On September 21, 2011, villagers of Wukan in Guangdong province began several months of organized protest against village cadres who had been accused of selling village land for personal gain. In the middle of the protest, a villager died while in police custody, leading to intervention by the provincial government. The protest ended with villagers electing their own head. This event turned out to be one of the biggest social protests in recent decades.5 On October 13, 2011, in a small town in Guangdong province, a two-year-old girl called Yueyue was run over by two trucks, one after the other, near her home. Eighteen pedestrians walked right past Yueyue and did not stop to help the poor baby. It was the nineteenth person who walked by, a middle-aged woman, who picked her up and took her to the roadside when Yueyue’s mother finally appeared. Yueyue died in the hospital the following day, and the incident triggered a national debate online about the awful moral conditions of Chinese society.6 The Guo Meimei incident illustrates well the cyber political culture on the eve of Xi Jinping’s ascendance. Guo Meimei was barely twenty years old on June 21, 2011. Like others of her age, she was a netizen who spent lots of time online. On Sina Weibo, China’s leading social media platform in 2011, she had posted photographs of herself and her Maserati and Lamborghini, dozens of Hermes handbags, and expensive jewelry. There was nothing wrong about what Guo was doing on social media. In an age of selfies and in a country with 500 million internet users as of 2011, displays of personal wealth and success on social media could not be more common. Internet culture fed endless online reality shows by enticing users to update their online status and share their personal lives. In 2011, Guo Meimei was just one of millions who displayed their glamorous lives on Sina Weibo. But the hapless Guo made the mistake of identifying herself as the general manager of a Red Cross Commercial Society on her Weibo account. On June 21, 2011, this job title became a headline on Tianya, one of the most popular online communities then: “New Discovery on\n\n22 • ROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\nWeibo! A 20-Year-Old General Manager of ‘Red Cross Commercial Society,’ All Sorts of Wealth Show- Off! Hurry Up and Go See!” 7 The posting linked Guo’s wealth to the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) and ended provocatively: “Whoever continues to donate money to the Red Cross must be a moron!” To the infinitely curious minds of Chinese netizens, Guo’s job title was an invitation for investigation. Many suspected that the Red Cross Commercial Society must be related with the RCSC. To them, Guo’s story provided an opportunity to expose the RCSC. At a time of declining trust in official institutions, there was nothing more gratifying to them than to discredit a public agency. The RCSC made a good target. A member of the International Federation of Red Cross, it is a ministerial-level, quasi-governmental agency qua charity organization. It is led by individuals boasting of high-ranking party leadership credentials. In 2011, the RCSC executive vice president and party secretary was Zhao Baige, a former deputy director and vice party secretary of the National Population and Family Planning Commission. As of February 2020, the RCSC executive vice president and party secretary was Liang Huiling, former head of the Commission for Discipline Inspection in Hebei province. For netizens, challenging the RCSC was an indirect challenge against the legitimacy of the CCP. As students of Chinese politics well know, indirection is a safer strategy of protest than direct confrontation. An unorganized but concerted online hunt for Guo’s connections with the Red Cross thus started. Overnight, Guo and the RCSC became the center of a national internet storm.\n\nINTERNET CULTURE IN 2011 By 2011, an online protest culture had long taken shape, characterized by a playful style, crowdsourced search engines, inventive methods to dodge censorship, and the mass participation of emotional publics.8 One item in this digital culture of protest has the ghastly name renrou sousuo 人肉搜索,\n\nROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\n• 23\n\n“human-flesh search.” In a human-flesh search, netizens use their internet search skills to hunt for information aimed to expose the alleged misdemeanors of individuals ranging from animal abusers to party officials suspected of corruption. Smacking of internet vigilantism, human-flesh search resembles a collective quest for truth or social justice. There is usually a mystery, and the goal is to solve the mystery by uncovering information with whatever means available. For example, in a case in 2007 a peasant named Zhou Zhenglong in Shaanxi province posted photographs of a South China tiger that he claimed he had discovered in the mountains near his village. The mystery to be solved was whether the photographs were authentic or forged. A sustained period of online search, which included the widespread sharing of technical analyses of the photographs, proved that the photographs had been forged and that Zhou had made up his story at the behest of local forestry officials in their attempt to obtain more government funding. The exposure of these forged photographs led to the downfall of several local party officials.9 Another item in the repertoire of online protest is weiguan 围观, or “spectating.” Weiguan was once associated with the passivity and numbness of a citizenry unable to take action when seeing fellow citizens in trouble. It was an image of the Chinese nation that the famous writer Lu Xun created in his work in the early twentieth century.10 The playful crowd wisdom of internet culture gave the term a new lease on life. It now refers to online participation by paying attention. To “like” or to retweet a post is to pay attention. It is a form of collective power, and the target of weiguan is turned into an object of the public gaze. Imagine the spectators in a packed football stadium loudly cheering the players, then multiply the numbers by a hundred or a thousand, and one will understand the sense of drama that is created through online spectating. Thus, for some time “weiguan is power” was a frequently used internet meme. Weiguan is a form of networked collective action.11 It connects online personal talk by individuals into a large-scale dramatic event. Weiguan can be serious or playful. To attract attention, discussions about even serious social issues often adopt a humorous style. Jokes, cartoons, parodies, and funny emojis are created and shared and become viral memes. The proliferation of these online symbols suggests that online weiguan is not all about\n\n24 • ROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\nspectating. It is also a process of the digital coproduction, appropriation, and remixing of online culture. In other words, weiguan is a Chinese form of contemporary remix culture. Much studied by media and communication scholars, remix culture is “a global activity consisting of the creative and efficient exchange of information made possible by digital technologies.” Essentially a cut, copy, and paste practice, remix is “the activity of taking samples from pre-existing materials to combine them into new forms according to personal taste.”12 The activity of turning preexisting material into something new is as old as human civilization, but digital technologies and the internet have made remix a distinct feature of digital culture in China as much as in other parts of the world.13 The Guo Meimei incident was the result of the same style of online spectatorship and participation. Prior to Sina Weibo and WeChat, Tianya was a popular online community and a hotbed of online protest. Not surprisingly, the Guo Meimei incident started there. But the news quickly spread to Sina Weibo, where remixed screenshots of photographs of Guo’s luxury possessions were circulated. Many users left comments on Guo Meimei’s Weibo account, such as “What a complicated plot in this play!” “How intriguing! I’m going to stay awake and continue to follow [the event].” There was a palpable excitement, as if people were watching a mystery drama. Particularly important in this drama was the role of the so-called BigV’s, or verified Weibo users with large numbers of followers. Big-V’s were China’s de facto internet influencers. Often using dramatic language, their postings were designed to provoke. The well-known sports commentator Huang Jianxiang posted the following message on June 27, 2011: “The state of things has come to such that I personally think that Guo Meimei is a really great person! She is more fucking awesome than Yu Zecheng!” In a popular spy television drama series, Yu Zecheng was a Communist mole in the nationalists’ powerful spy agency in the 1940s and always managed to outmaneuver his opponents. Comparing Guo Meimei to Yu Zecheng was a playful way of saying that Guo Meimei was a mole planted within the RCSC to bring it down. This remix of two vastly different characters from two historical eras created a surprising analogy that enticed netizens’ interest and participation.\n\nROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\n• 25\n\nInternet platforms thrive on user participation, just as participation can boost users’ social media status. Personal status and business success are interdependent. No users, no business. One consequence of this social media logic is the tendency toward sensationalism: participation may become a form of spectatorship. There is a public relish sometimes bordering on the vicious in the scandalizing of private lives and the debunking of a public institution, as is clear from the Guo Meimei case. At the same time, however, it is undeniable that netizens also join online protest out of genuine feelings of anger at injustice and sympathy for the poor and weak. Chinese online publics are emotional publics. This is as much true now as it was in the past. As many of the stories in this book show, it is also true of online public responses during the Wuhan lockdown. The primary goal of internet censorship, in fact, is not the foreclosure of dissent or criticisms of the party but the management of increasingly emotional online publics. These unruly publics, to use official media language, can quickly stir up “internet mass incidents” (wangluo qunti xing shijian 网络群体性事件), thereby causing social chaos. It is also for this reason that since 2013 the management of online speech has emphasized wenming 文明, “civility,” and zheng nengliang 正能量, “positive energy.” As discussed later in this chapter, the discourses of civility and positive energy are propagated to counter online protest by attacking its emotional and allegedly irrational character. Negative emotions that are especially powerful in social protests, such as anger and indignation, are attacked in the name of civility and reason.\n\nXI JINPING CENTRALIZES POWER Xi Jinping started consolidating his power after he became the CCP general secretary in November 2012. By 2019, two years into his second term, he had accumulated more power than any other party leader after Mao. Until Xi came along, no other person since Mao had been addressed in official media as the “great leader” (lingxiu 领袖) beloved of the people.14 Xi is not only head of the party and the military but also head of the state\n\n26 • ROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\nand the police force, positions that even Mao did not hold. In addition, Xi set up and chairs many other offices that have increasingly taken on the power of the state. As the political scientist Susan Shirk describes the situation, “Within the Party, Xi acts as if he is personally in charge of everything. He chairs eight of the leading small groups including the National Security Commission. Xi also handles internal security directly, thereby reducing the chances of a coup.” One of the groups chaired by Xi, called the Leading Small Group on Comprehensively Deepening Reform, “has become a more powerful shadow State Council, usually meeting monthly and issuing specific policies on a wide range of issues, including economic ones.”15 In 2014, Xi made himself the head of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, thus showing the importance he attaches to policies concerning cyberspace. In centralizing political power, Xi ended the institutional convention of collective leadership established by Deng Xiaoping.16 Deng abhorred the catastrophe inflicted on the country by Mao’s dictatorship. He himself was a victim of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. He was publicly denounced and later demoted to a remote rural region. His son was disabled under detention by Red Guards.17 When Deng reemerged to lead the economic reform in the late 1970s, he set down term limits for party leaders and introduced collective leadership as well as an institutionalized mechanism for power transition: when the incumbent leader started his second term, a successor-in-training would be selected. Xi violated the convention by not selecting a successor-in-training and thus sent a signal that he might stay on after his second term. Even more shockingly, in 2018 the National People’s Congress abolished the two-term limit for the president of the state that had been added to the Constitution in 1982 under Deng Xiaoping to prevent the appearance of another Mao. How could Xi have centralized power to such a degree? Reflecting the current global trend of strongman politics riding waves of populism, Xi has mobilized popular support for his agendas. The anticorruption campaign that he launched is a case in point. Corruption has long troubled China’s economic reform. At least six major anticorruption campaigns were conducted after 1982.18 Yet no previous campaign lasted as long as Xi’s or brought down as many party officials. According to one study, the number\n\nROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\n• 27\n\nof disciplined cadres at the vice ministerial level and higher had been kept well under one hundred for each general party congress before 2012 (the CCP congress convenes every five years). The number spiked more than fourfold during Xi Jinping’s first term in 2012–2017, reaching 440.19 For the first time in CCP history, Xi’s anticorruption campaign put a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, Zhou Yongkang, on trial. Once one of the nine most powerful men in China, Zhou was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption. Xi’s campaign also targeted high-ranking military officers. From 2012 to 2017, sixty-three generals were expelled from the party due to corruption and sent to military courts, including two former deputy chairmen of the Central Military Commission (only one rank below Xi Jinping in military ranking order) and two serving members of that commission.20 Xi scored victories on two fronts with his anticorruption campaign: he removed his rivals from leadership positions and thus consolidated personal power, and he won popular support for attacking a deep-seated problem. Corruption breeds public anger and resentment. Bringing down party officials on corruption crimes can diffuse anger and resentment. Interestingly, one study based on an analysis of online comments finds that Xi’s anticorruption campaign won popular support for himself more than for the agencies implementing the campaign. The campaign reinforced public support for Xi “at the cost of distracting or even undermining support for institution building.”21\n\nTHE RETREAT OF CIVIL SOCIETY From the mid-1990s on, the language and practices of civil society became gradually acceptable in China. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) appeared and even flourished. They were active in environmental protection, poverty alleviation, charity work, rural education, and many other social issues. Party authorities were wary of NGOs, of course, yet by being creative and by cooperating with the state, NGOs carved out a space of their own.\n\n28 • ROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\nAfter the “Arab Spring” uprisings in 2010 and 2011, however, the political environment in China became hostile to NGOs. Detractors viewed them as the foot soldiers of “color revolutions” supported by Western democracy assistance programs.22 A crackdown on civil society and Western values started with the issuance in April 2013 of “A Communiqué on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere” popularly known as Document 9.23 The directive urged the party leadership to guard against seven political perils, including constitutional democracy, “nihilistic” and critical views of modern Chinese history, “universal values,” neoliberalism, and the promotion of Western notions of media and civil society.24 Civil society became almost a taboo word thereafter. Around the same time, several leftist intellectuals in China advanced the notion of a “people’s society” (renmin shehui 人民 社会) as a superior Chinese alternative to Western civil society.25 Although their views drew immediate criticisms from their more liberal-leaning peers, in official discourse the concept of civil society faded away. New legislation was introduced to limit the influence of domestic and international NGOs.26 In 2016, China issued a charity law concerning domestic nonprofit organizations and a law for managing foreign NGOs. Some Chinese commentators see the charity law as a helpful step because it at least clarifies which organizations can or cannot do fund-raising for charity purposes in China.27 Before the foreign-NGO law existed, international NGOs in China operated in a gray zone and were supervised by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. The new law requires foreign NGOs to register with the Ministry of Public Security or its provincial-level bureaus, a change that shows a higher concern with security issues associated with foreign NGOs. The foreign-NGO law has implications for Chinese local NGOs as well, though: because of the increased surveillance of foreign NGOs, local groups are less reluctant to partner with them or to seek funding from them.28 The crackdown on civil society happened in tandem with a campaign to revive the mass-line tradition in CCP history. As a leadership principle of the Chinese Communist Party, the mass line was institutionalized in the Yan’an period during the anti-Japanese war era. It was Mao’s theoretical abstraction of the communist movement’s guerilla experience.\n\nROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\n• 29\n\nMao wrote of the mass line in 1943: “In all practical work of our Party, correct leadership can only be developed on the principle of ‘from the masses, to the masses.’ The basic method of leadership is to sum up the views of the masses, take the results back to the masses so that the masses can give them their firm support and so work out sound ideas for leading the work on hand.”29 In theory, the mass line was the CCP’s method of gauging public opinion and tackling elitism by encouraging mass participation. The mass line was much touted in the Mao era but receded from CCP rhetoric when the economic reform began to promote individual success and the entrepreneurial spirit. Now revived under Xi Jinping, the tradition is out of sync with reality. Instead of a method for party leaders to learn from citizens, it is used to mobilize mass surveillance through grassroots institutions. One example of an institution for mass surveillance is popularly called Chaoyang qunzhun 朝阳群众, “Chaoyang masses.” Chaoyang is a district in Beijing where the Beijing Capital International Airport is located. In 2013, based on clues provided by mass informants in Chaoyang, Beijing police detained Charles Xue, an internet celebrity and social commentator, on charges of soliciting prostitution. Although Charles Xue may seem to be the first victim of Chaoyang masses, according to a story in the Evening News of the Rule of Law (法制晚报), a subsidiary legal affairs newspaper under Beijing Youth Daily (北京青年报), Chaoyang masses had worked with the police to catch spies as early as in 1974.30 Today’s Chaoyang masses, however, are equipped with mobile phones and other new technologies. Some use surveillance cameras for neighborhood watch. In 2017, a Chaoyang masses app was launched to assist informants in reporting cases. An informant can take a photo of a suspicious stranger in a neighborhood and upload it to the app to alert the local police.31 Who are the Chaoyang masses? They are mostly volunteers but may receive a monthly allowance and training from neighborhood police stations to encourage them to serve as informants. According to the same Evening News story, as of July 2017 Beijing’s Chaoyang district boasted 190,000 such informants, 130,000 of whom were registered with the local administrative offices. That total translated into 277 people for every square kilometer. Of\n\n30 • ROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\nthese people, 60,000 were active operatives. They provided 20,000 clues to the police every month. Typically, informants were retirees with time to kill, but they could also be cleaners, elevator operators, shop owners in the neighborhood, bike repairers, fee collectors for the property-management office. They could be anyone, and yet their identity as informants was not known publicly. They would report any unusual activity or behavior to the local police station. In one case, an informant reported a neighbor to the local antidrug team. Seeing that his neighbor always slept in the daytime and went out at night made him suspicious. Based on this clue, the antidrug team kept watch over this neighbor and broke a drug-dealing ring at his home.32 Chinese universities are ideological battlegrounds and prime targets of control. A variation of the Chaoyang masses in universities is the system of student information officers (xuesheng xinxiyuan 学生信息员). These students are selected by their institutions to collect and report feedback to administrators about various aspects of their educational experiences, especially teacher conduct and teaching content. The system has existed for a while now—administrative regulations about student information officers issued in 2005 and 2006 can still be found on the websites of some institutions—but it did not seem to be widely implemented until after 2013.33 At a university in Chongqing, for the 2016–2017 academic year awards were given to selected student information officers to commend their work.34 At a university in the city of Nanjing in the 2015–2016 academic year, student leaders could receive extra credits for leadership by serving as student information officers.35 A polytechnic college in Hubei published a news release on November 7, 2019, about a college-wide meeting to honor student information officers.36 Student information officers may have wide-ranging responsibilities. They collect student feedback about their education and report the information to school administrators. It may be feedback about administrators, peers, and teachers or about facilities and lab and classroom conditions, but the reported information especially concerns teachers’ behavior and teaching activities. This is shown in the standard full name of the position: “student information officers about teaching” (xuesheng jiaoxue xinxiyuan 学生教 学信息员). In the regulations about student information officers posted on\n\nROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\n• 31\n\nFebruary 22, 2017, by a university in Guangxi province, the first type of information requested concerns teachers and teaching: “Information officers should collect the following types of information about teachers and teaching: pedagogical reforms, teaching attitudes, teaching contents, teaching methods, teaching practice, moral education of students, teacher conduct as student models, and exemplary cases of abiding by socialist core values in the field of education.”37 A university in Hainan province emphasized the monitoring and surveillance functions of student information officers. A news release posted on its website on April 30, 2019, stated: “A main responsibility [of student information officers] is to supervise classroom teaching. This includes: teachers’ moral behavior, sense of responsibility, teaching preparation before class, the structure of teaching contents, calligraphy on the blackboard, expressiveness, manners, teaching methods and skills, office hours and quality of grading student homework.”38 The system of student information officers has had a chilling effect on open expression and critical thinking on university campuses. In recent years, faculty members in several universities have been suspended from teaching or fired because students reported them to administrators. A New York Times story on November 1, 2019, mentions two cases. In one, a professor of Chinese literature at Chongqing Normal University said that the popular phrase “roll up your sleeves and work hard” was vulgar and coarse. A student reported him for making this remark in class because this phrase allegedly originated from Xi Jinping. The teacher was stripped of his teaching position and reassigned to work in the school library. In the other case, a professor of economics at Xiamen University, You Shengdong, was fired in 2018 after being reported by students for his “radical speech.”39 In a subsequent interview with the New York Times, when asked why he lost his job, Mr. You replied that he had made the following comments about positive energy: “energy” is a concept in physics; it can be stronger or weaker but not positive or negative, so he prohibited students from using the phrase in their course assignments or exams.40 By calling out the problematic language of positive energy, You Shengdong touched a sensitive nerve. He undermined one of two key concepts in the ideological lexicon of the Xi\n\n32 • ROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\nJinping era, the other being wenming, “civility” or “civilization.” Each consists of a set of vocabularies, practices, and institutions, and the two concepts work together to guide public speech, shape individual thinking, and suppress criticism and dissent.\n\nTHE IDEOLOGICAL DISCOURSES OF CIVILITY AND POSITIVE ENERGY A key word in modern Chinese history,41 wenming means “being modern,” “having culture,” and “having good manners and polite behavior.”42 Talk about wenming disappeared during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, when revolutionary rudeness was the order of the day.43 Its return coincided with the beginning of the economic reform, when ideologies of economic development displaced those of revolution and class struggle. In a speech in 1980, Deng Xiaoping introduced the concept of “socialist spiritual civilization” alongside the idea of “material civilization.” Whereas material civilization emphasizes economic development, socialist spiritual civilization concerns “not only education, science, culture . . . but also communist ideas, ideals, beliefs, morality, discipline, revolutionary standpoints and principles and the comradelike relations among people.”44 These two civilizations served important political purposes at a time of transition. While Deng’s notion of spiritual civilization “remained largely grounded in the language of Chinese socialist ideology,”45 the discourses of civilization under Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao put more emphasis on China’s earlier cultural traditions, especially Confucianism.46 Xi Jinping inherited this discourse of wenming but added his own content to it. Some of Xi’s key pronouncements, such as “the China dream” and “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” are positioned in the lineage of China’s Confucian civilization. Confucian teachings of family harmony, filial piety, and moral cultivation have become slogans in street-side bulletin boards. In November 2013, Xi Jinping paid a personal visit to Confucius’s birthplace, Qufu, where he spoke about the importance of studying Confucian classics. It is in this context that the discourse of civilizing the web takes on new\n\nROAD TO APOCALYPSE\n\n• 33\n\ncultural meanings. Linking online civility to Confucian virtues of harmony, propriety, culture, and self-cultivation elevates online civility to the significance of a great civilizational tradition. Compared with wenming, positive energy is a more recent addition to the glossary of CCP propaganda. A concept from popular writings on selfhelp and positive psychology, it may have been first introduced into PRC public discourse via entertainment celebrities from Hong Kong.47 In 2012, the concept topped a Chinese-language magazine’s list of the top-ten “catchphrases” (liuxing yu 流行语) of the year. Apparently deeming this achievement worthy national news, a Xinhua Agency story on December 30, 2012, exclaimed, “ ‘Positive energy’ is absolutely one of the most beloved phrases of the 1.3 billion people. It is used by head of the state all the way down to ordinary people.”48 Xi Jinping elevated the concept of positive energy to the level of national ideological discourse by using it personally. On December 13, 2012, when he met with former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, Xi said, “Both China and the United States should fear no hardships, dare to innovate, and accumulate positive energy.”49 In the newspaper database China National Knowledge Infrastructure, operated by Tsinghua University, the term positive energy appeared 2,133 times in 2012 and then catapulted to 21,358 times in 2013 and 26,147 times in 2014.50 This new language of positive energy has attracted much academic attention. Some scholars see it as a form of internet control under the broader agenda of civility, public morality, and suzhi 素质 (quality) education.51 Others view it as part of the CCP’s increasingly proactive approach to propaganda.52 Still others propose that it is a signature neoliberal concept in its emphasis on the individual’s responsibility for achieving happiness by taking positive attitudes to life and work.53 The truth is that the discourse of positive energy is made to do all this work, but not all at the same time. Rather, it works situationally. It can be used together with the language of civil"
