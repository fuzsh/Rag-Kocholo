MDPI is leading the transition to open science by making more research free and accessible to everyone. Over 3.3 million researchers have entrusted MDPI with publishing their scientific discoveries. MDPI’s editorial process is bolstered by a network of dedicated reviewers, a team of 6000 diligent, well-trained staff members, and an in-house article submission platform that was designed to ensure efficient processes within its 430 fully OA titles.\n\nMDPI has been a strong proponent of the open access publishing model right from the beginning. As one of the pioneering fully open access publishers, we firmly believe that unrestricted access to research findings forms the foundation for better transparency, efficiency, and quality control across all scientific disciplines.\n\nIn December 2022, we reached a significant milestone by surpassing one million articles published. That is one million articles freely available to all, to circulate and build upon!\n\nOffering free and immediate access to scientific papers empowers scientists to examine, validate, replicate, and expand upon existing results. This not only helps prevent redundancy and optimizes how resources are used but also paves the way for innovative new approaches.\n\nThe International Open Access Week takes place from 23 to 29 October 2023, providing a unique opportunity to connect the global movement towards open sharing and open science with the progress of policy transformations at the local level.\n\nOur goal, during Open Access Week as well as throughout the year, is to offer resources for educating people about the benefits of open access publishing. The MDPI Blog offers a wealth of information around open access and open science.\n\nPromoting the values of accessibility, transparency, and collaboration\n\nOpen access publishing embodies the fundamental values of democratizing knowledge and fostering global accessibility. It aims to break down barriers that have traditionally limited access to scholarly work, ensuring that knowledge is available to all, regardless of their financial or institutional affiliations.\n\nDiscounts are part of our commitment to ensuring there are diverse pathways to Open Access publishing for researchers worldwide. MDPI supports scientific communities in several different ways.\n\nOne of the key strengths of open access publishing lies in its ability to facilitate interdisciplinary research. By removing paywalls and promoting the sharing of knowledge across disciplines, OA encourages collaboration and innovation. Researchers from diverse fields can access and build upon each other's work, fostering a holistic approach to addressing complex global challenges.\n\nFunders' policies are getting aligned with open science\n\nGovernments, institutions, and funding agencies have recognized the transformative potential of open access and have implemented policies to promote it. These policies often mandate that publicly funded research should be made openly accessible. Such initiatives have accelerated the growth of open access repositories and journals, reinforcing the commitment to open access principles. Check our spotlights on OA policies in the US, EU and China.\n\nOpen access publishing is continually evolving, with innovative and community-driven models and technologies shaping its future. Initiatives like \"Plan S\" and \"cOAlition S\" promote the adoption of OA publishing from the national funders’ perspective by requiring grantees to publish their research openly. A new policy announced by the US administration last year requires that, as of January 2026, all US federally funded research be made freely and immediately available after publication.\n\nAdditionally, preprint servers such as MDPI's Preprints.org, which allow researchers to share their findings before formal peer review, have gained popularity, enhancing the speed at which new knowledge is disseminated. The rise of blockchain technology is also being explored to ensure transparency and authenticity in scholarly publishing.\n\nFor more than twenty years, open access scholarly publishing has been revolutionizing academia by promoting the values of accessibility, transparency, and collaboration. Its support for interdisciplinary research, evolving policies, and innovative practices all contribute to its growing influence in the global research community. As open access continues to expand, it holds the potential to democratize knowledge, advance science, and drive positive societal change.\n\nMDPI is proud to be a leader in the transition to open access.\n\nAtmosphere (IF 3.110, ISSN: 2073-4433) is an online open access journal that was first published in 2010.

These changes include corrections to cross-calibration of satellite data inputs and updates to the gauge analysis. Over-ocean changes starting in 2003 resulted in an overall precipitation increase of 1.8% after 2009. Updating the gauge analysis to its final, high-quality version increases the global land total by 1.8% for the post-2002 period. These changes correct a small, incorrect dip in the estimated global precipitation over the last decade given by the earlier Version 2.2. The GPCP analysis is also used to describe global precipitation in 2017. The general La Niña pattern for 2017 is noted, and the evolution from the early 2016 El Niño pattern is described. The 2017 global value is one of the highest for the 1979–2017 period, exceeded only by 2016 and 1998 (both El Niño years), and reinforces the small positive trend. Results for 2017 also reinforce significant trends in precipitation intensity (on a monthly scale) in the tropics. These results for 2017 indicate the value of the GPCP analysis, in addition to research, for climate monitoring.\n\n“Evaluating the Hydrological Cycle over Land Using the Newly- Corrected Precipitation Climatology from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)”\n\nAtmosphere 2017, 8(3), 52; https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos8030052\n\nAvailable online: https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/8/3/52\n\nThe 2015 release of the precipitation climatology from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) for 1951–2000, based on climatological normals of about 75,100 rain gauges, allows for quantification of mean land surface precipitation as part of the global water cycle. In GPCC’s 2011- release, a bulk climatological correction was applied to compensate for gauge undercatch. In this paper, we derive an improved correction approach based on the synoptic weather reports for the period 1982–2015. The compared results show that the climatological approach tends to overestimate the correction for Central and Eastern Europe, especially in the northern winter, and in other regions throughout the year. Applying the mean weather-dependent correction to the GPCC’s uncorrected precipitation climatology for 1951–2000 gives a value of 854.7 mm of precipitation per year (excluding Antarctica) or 790 mm for the global land surface. The warming of nearly 1 K relative to pre-industrial temperatures is expected to be accompanied by a 2%–3% increase in global (land and ocean) precipitation. However, a comparison of climatology for 30-year reference periods from 1931–1960 up to 1981–2010 reveals no significant trend for land surface precipitation. This may be caused by the large variability of precipitation, the varying data coverage over time, and other issues related to the sampling of rain-gauge networks. The GPCC continues to enlarge and further improve the quality of its database and will generate precipitation analyses with homogeneous data coverage over time. Another way to reduce the sampling issues is through the combination of rain gauge-based analyses with remote sensing (i.e., satellite or radar) datasets.\n\nSpecial Issue Recommendations:\n\n“Artificial Intelligence for Meteorology Applications”\n\nEdited by Dr. Wei Fang, Prof. Dr. Victor S.

He is trained as a chemist and an environmental health scientist. His research integrates natural and health sciences to understand atmospheric dynamics, from the release of contaminants, their fate in the atmosphere and the role of physical and chemical processes to exposure pathways and their relationship with biological mechanisms of toxicity and clinical outcomes. He is particularly interested in the interplay of climate change with atmospheric physical and chemical processes and the resultant environmental and health impacts.\n\nProf. Dr. Kavouras has been affiliated with research and academic institutes in the US and abroad, working on the aforementioned big-picture topics to address local and regional priorities while considering their diverse and unique characteristics. His experimental study designs include benchtop laboratory analysis and in vitro toxicology, methods development, field studies, community-based exposure and health studies, and integrated geospatial, inverse, and epidemiological modeling.\n\nThe following is a short Q&A with Prof. Dr. Ilias Kavouras, who shared his vision for the journal as well as his views on this research area:\n\nWhat appealed to you about the journal and made you want to take the role as its Editor-in-Chief?\n\nI am honored to serve the journal, Editorial Board, authors, and readers as the Editor-in-Chief of Atmosphere. Earth’s atmosphere is the single most important factor for the development and evolution of life on the planet. There is reciprocal and evolving interaction with both the natural and human ecosystems. An increasing number of scientists across many disciplines, from natural sciences to engineering, health, and social sciences are tackling the multifaceted mechanisms and impacts of atmospheric processes using state-of-the-art tools, technologies and methodological frameworks. Under the leadership of Dr. Aiken and the Editorial Board, the journal provides a forum for discipline-specific as well as interdisciplinary research, and facilitates the exchange of ideas and cross-pollination required to meet the scientific and societal challenges of a changing climate. It holds great potential to advance science and innovation on many different levels.\n\nWhat is your vision for the journal?\n\nIt is my primary goal to continue and strengthen the journal’s prominence in atmospheric sciences as a forum of high-quality–high-impact, accessible research on fundamental atmospheric disciplines. Building on existing broader themes, it is also in the interests of the journal, the scientific community, and society to expand to atmosphere-driven transdisciplinary basic and applied research. The journal already has scientifically and geographically diverse editors, Advisory Panel Members and Editorial Board Members, but we are lacking in gender and racial diversity. It will be a priority for the editorial team, in consultation with the Advisory and Editorial Board, to further expand expertise, diversity, equity, and inclusion. This is also true for authors and readers. Creating pathways to increase diversity, accessibility, and inclusion of authors, reviewers, and readers from underrepresented and underserved groups is key to the mission and vision of the journal. Social media and interactive platforms of engagement will be integrated to engage a broader network of scientists, professionals, and policymakers across disciplines.\n\nWhat does the future of this field of research look like?\n\nIt is a great time to be working in atmospheric sciences today. There have been many breakthroughs in atmospheric sciences over the past few decades, but many more have yet to be discovered. As a result, there are many opportunities moving forward for fundamental processes, direct and indirect impacts on natural and human environments, and research-to-practice studies, covering subjects from climate change to atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, from droughts and wildfires to man-made emissions, from measurements to modeling, from mechanisms to policy and strategies. Due to recent advancements, we can obtain measurements, run simulations, and analyze big data more precisely and efficiently than in the not-so-distant past, allowing us to provide more detail, refine existing knowledge, and test new hypotheses and concepts.\n\nWhat do you think of the development of Open Access in the publishing field?\n\nAccessibility is key to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in science and research. The Open Access model resolves the shortcomings of traditional publishing models by enabling access to published research and studies. Many funding agencies now support the open access of publications through sponsored research. However, funding priorities and disparities pose a challenge in the implementation of the Open Access model, particularly from low- and middle-income regions. I will work with the editorial team to develop initiatives that improve inclusion. The type, character, impact, and size of basic and applied atmospheric research published in the journal are growing. Embedding open and fair data practices is beneficial to the scientific community as well as the publication process. It adds value and content, which is consistent with the Open Access publication model, and further utilizes the strengths of technology to communicate scientific outputs and outcomes.\n\nWe cordially invite you to participate in the 4th International Electronic Conference on Environmental Research and Public Health (ECERPH2022), which will be held from 15 to 30 October 2022. Prof. Dr. Jon Øyvind Odland serves as the chair of this e-conference. He is a Professor of Global Health at NTNU, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and a specialist in GYN/OB, environmental medicine, and epidemiology. This online event will bring together researchers from all over the world with no concerns regarding travel or other related expenditures.\n\nHealth effects could be very different if the world’s temperature increases from 5 to 10 °C compared to an increase from 35 to 40 °C. If we look at the mortality associated with climate change, it is obvious that the burden is higher in tropical areas. However, if we add morbidity and complications for, e.g., reproductive health and pregnancy care, the situation might be very different. The spread of infectious diseases related to vector migration is also a very important topic, as is the situation of environmental exposure to contaminants and occupational health.\n\nThis conference will provide leading scientists, working in the environmental research and public health field, with an online platform to share their latest research and engage in exciting discussions.\n\nThe main topics and sessions of the conference are:\n\nPregnancy, Reproductive Health, and Climate Change;\n\nVector Migration from a Climate Perspective;\n\nCOVID-19 from a Climate Perspective;\n\nThe Forgotten Tropical Diseases from a Climate Perspective;\n\nCardiovascular Diseases and Climate Change;\n\nOccupational Health and Temperature Change.\n\nThe conference will be completely free of charge to attend, as well as for scholars to upload and present their latest work on the conference platform.\n\nThe accepted proceedings papers from the conference will most likely be published in a dedicated issue of the MDPI journal Environmental Sciences Proceedings (ISSN: 2673-4931). Please note that, before publication, Proceedings Series Journals will review accepted papers using the powerful text comparison tool iThenticate. This procedure aims to prevent scholarly and professional plagiarism. Articles with a high repetition rate and lack of novelty will not be published in the conference proceedings. In addition, all participants will be encouraged to submit an extended full manuscript to one dedicated Special Issue in IJERPH (ISSN 1660-4601) with a 15% discount on the article processing charge (APC, the original APC is CHF 2500).\n\nImportant Dates:\n\nAbstract Submission Deadline: 10 July 2022;\n\nNotification of Acceptance: 31 July 2022;\n\nFull Paper Submission Deadline: 28 August 2022;\n\nConference Date: 15–30 October 2022.\n\nIJERPH is indexed in Scopus, SCIE (IF = 3.390), SSCI (Web of Science), PubMed, MEDLINE, PMC, and many other databases.

Over 25 years MDPI has grown to become the largest Open Access publisher globally, publishing over 160,000 articles across more than 350 journals in 2020. At the core, MDPI was founded in response to a pressing need of fast publication and inclusion. The scholar was set at the centre of the publication process for the first time. Acting as a service provider, rather than a product provider, MDPI exists to help scientists achive their objective to disseminate research results. At MDPI, we believe scientists deserve a better service from the publishing world.\n\nThe International Open Access Week (Open Access Week), founded by the SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) Alliance and student partners in 2008, has been successfully running for 13 years. As an advocate and pioneer of open access publishing, MDPI actively responds to the call of International Open Access Week. This year’s theme of “It Matters How We Open Knowledge: Building Structural Equity” highlights the Recommendation’s call for equitable participation from all authors and readers.\n\nFor the last 25 years, MDPI has been committed to disseminating open research. Here is a video showing MDPI’s Commitment to Equity, Inclusion and Diversity for More than 25 Years.\n\nInternational Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress in the building of more equitable foundations for opening knowledge—discussions and actions that need to be continued, year in and year out. MDPI has always aimed to provide professional and efficient publishing services to scholars around the world.\n\nOur mission is to make scientific research accessible to everyone; this year, we interview and hold discussions with open science ambassadors on how to build an equal and inclusive environment for open science. Academic editors help us collaborate with more institutions to advocate for open access ideas.\n\nRead our anniversary blog post: \"Sharing 'Collective Human Knowledge': The Benefits of Open Access Publication\"\n\nBesides this, our scientific community is a key driver of our success and MDPI’s remarkable growth. Despite the pandemic, we have prepared online conferences and workshops to gather scholars from different communities.\n\nThe Basel Sustainable Publishing online forum provides an equal opportunity for stakeholders and researchers from multi-cultural environments to exchange ideas and eliminate barriers to participation.\n\nConference date: 25 October 2021, online\n\nConference website: https://bspf2021.sciforum.net/\n\nMain topics: MDPI discusses the current dilemma of open access science from various perspectives such as governments, libraries, and publishers, and related measures on how to change the status quo of discrimination from a global perspective.\n\nWe aim to support equality, inclusion, diversity, and accessibility in scholarly communications.

Through this national agreement, the Austrian institutions listed below as well as FWF will cover the Article Processing Charges (APC) of manuscripts published by eligible corresponding or funded authors in MDPI journals as long as central funds are available.\n\nAll participating institutions have gained access to the MDPI online submission system where they can find full article metadata and pricing information as well as Funder and Grant ID details for easy identification and additional transparency. At the same time eligible authors are benefited from an APC discount which comes at no cost for the institutions.\n\nEligible corresponding authors affiliated with the participating institutions are prompted to choose the corresponding Institutional Open Access Program (IOAP) when they submit an article via our online submission system. The program will be selected automatically if authors submit their papers using their institutional email address. To claim their discount, FWF funded authors should choose the particular funder and add their Grant ID upon online submission of their manuscript. The institutions will then crosscheck the information and confirm the APC funding.\n\nEligible authors that have their APC covered by their institution or funder are advised to include the following sentence in their acknowledgments: \"Open Access Funding by the [name of the institution/funder]\".\n\nThe full text of the agreement is openly available online at: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2536007\n\nFor any questions about the agreement, please contact the KEMÖ Consortium at [email protected], FWF at [email protected], or the MDPI IOAP team at [email protected].\n\nThe Austrian institutions participating in this agreement are:\n\nAustrian Science Fund (FWF)\n\nUniversity for Continuing Education Krems\n\nUniversity of Applied Sciences BFI Vienna\n\nUniversity of Applied Sciences Upper Austria\n\nUniversity of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien\n\nVorarlberg University of Applied Sciences\n\nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)\n\nInstitute of Science and Technology Austria\n\nMCI Management Center Innsbruck\n\nUniversity of Graz\n\nUniversity of Linz\n\nUniversity of Salzburg\n\nGraz University of Technology\n\nTU Wien\n\nUniversity of Veterinary Medicine Vienna\n\nUniversity of Vienna\n\nThis is our first collective agreement with a national library consortium, while the individual institutions around the world participating in our IOAP are now more than 500 - see details here: https://www.mdpi.com/about/ioap. We would be mostly interested in discussing about possible collaborations with other consortia, funders, and institutions in our mutual efforts to accelerate Open Access.\n\nCape Town will host the 6th World Sustainability Forum at the Cape Sun Hotel on 27 and 28 January 2017. This prominent event, held for the first time in Africa, will include many illustrious South African and international experts, such as Her Excellency Graça Machel (Sustainable Development Advocate for the United Nations, Mozambique), Joyene Isaacs (HoD Agriculture Western Cape Government), Jeffrey Sachs (Columbia University, USA), Max Bergman (SRaM, University of Basel), Mark New (Pro Vice-Chancellor, University of Cape Town), Frans Swanepoel (FutureAfrica, University of Pretoria) and Francis Petersen (Vice-Chancellor-designate, University of the Free State). The Forum will provide a stage for national and international debates on sustainability in South Africa, the African continent, and about international perspectives on sustainability. It brings together researchers and representatives from government and the business sector to discuss a wide-ranging set of issues associated with sustainability, including food security, water and energy scarcity, mining, poverty reduction, climate change, and urbanisation.\n\nThe next few decades will be marked by profound changes in the relationships between global economics, national societies, and the environment. We have entered what some call the Anthropocene, an age in which human activity dominates the climate and the environment. These changes will have numerous consequences on societies around the globe. South Africa and Africa will play a central role, for better or worse, in creating opportunities and risks during these changing times as Africa is profoundly influencing and being influenced by global developments.\n\nThe adoption of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015 was accompanied by what insiders considered an optimism they have not experienced in relation to UN resolutions before. The relative efficiency in the drafting, the lack of trenches between East and West, or between North and South, and the unanimity of support of the 193 countries speak volumes. In stark contrast, sustainability seems to go against a changing economic and political tide, where waves of nationalism and protectionism from some of the most powerful countries risk the wellbeing of the rest of the world. The 6th World Sustainability Forum will enable fruitful exchanges, which sensitise South African and international communities to the global urgency and specifics of sustainability.\n\nThe Forum will showcase the work of internationally renowned researchers and include more than 150 presentations. During the conference dinner, the World Sustainability Award, associated with a US$ 100 000 prize, will be announced, as well as the Emerging Sustainability Leader Award, associated with a US$ 10 000 prize. The prizes are sponsored by the MDPI Sustainability Foundation and Sustainability, an academic open access journal by MDPI. The World Sustainability Forum is preceded by the Postgraduate Forum on Sustainability, which will introduce more than 100 young scholars from South Africa and the African continent to sustainability research. Both events are organized and sponsored by the University of Cape Town, the University of the Western Cape, the University of Basel, MDPI, and by the National Research Foundation of South Africa.\n\nContacts:\n\nScientific Matters: Prof Manfred Max Bergman, Social Research and Methodology Group (SRaM), University of Basel, Switzerland; Email: [email protected]\n\nPress Accreditation and General Enquiries: Mr Matthias Burkhalter, MDPI AG, Basel, Switzerland; Email: [email protected]; Tel. +41 61 683 77 34\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\n#WSF2017SA"
