Appendix 1: Bibliography 863 Appendix 2: Web Sites 887 Appendix 3: Associations 901 Index 907 xu To my Yiayia, Evdokia, with love and admiration Introduction ike a river winding its way to the sea fed by countless tributaries, the festival we call Christmas has rolled down to us over the course of two millennia. It has taken many twists and turns on its journey across the rugged landscape of the ages, thereby gaining and losing a range of meanings, legends, customs, and symbols. It has been fed along the way by such sources as the Bible, pre-Christian calendar customs. Christian lore and tradition, and a wide range of folk practices, be- liefs, and symbols. The interventions and innovations of many indi- viduals — be they saints, kings, queens, musicians, writers, business men and women, manufacturers, scholars, clergy, or politicians — have also swelled the flow. Today, standing at the mouth of the river, the yearly phenomena we call Christmas roars past us each Decem- ber, a joyous tumult composed of all these influences. In western cultures the celebrations surrounding Christmas and New Year's have unified into a single holiday season. Hence, the second edition of the Encyclopedia of Christmas has expanded its coverage of New Year's Eve and Day. For this reason, the second edition has been retitled Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations. The Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations addresses this sprawling holiday, tracing its history back to ancient times and describing its observance in countries spanning six continents. The encyclopedia format allows the user to locate sought-for informa- tion quickly, or to browse. The diverse range of material presented offers the reader the opportunity to gain a new appreciation of the breadth and depth of this ancient, international festival. XV Audience The Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations is intended for general audiences, including students and teachers, as well as interested adults. Those researching various aspects of the history and celebration of Christmas will find pertinent information, and general readers will find engaging historical narratives, descriptions, tales, and facts. Scope and Organization The Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations contains 247 entries on all facets of Christmas arranged in alphabetical order. Topics covered include folk customs and beliefs, religious practices, symbols, legends, mythological and historical figures, foods, beverages, and major artistic and popular works associated with the celebration of Christmas and New Year's Eve and Day. Entries also provide infor- mation on related days and celebrations, such as the Annunciation, Candlemas, and Epiphany. Because many of the entries include ma- terial on a range of subjects, the reader is strongly urged to consult the index in order to locate all available information on any given topic. The Encyclopedia traces the history of Christmas and New Year's Day from antiquity to the twentieth century. It contains a number of essays on ancient celebrations which bequeathed some of their cus- toms to this holiday season, such as the Roman festivals Kalends and Saturnalia. It also traces the origins and development of Christ- mas as a Christian holiday. To this end it includes essays exploring the controversy over the date of Jesus' birth, explaining the selection of December 25 as the date of the new festival, and describing the development of the many Christian holidays and celebrations relat- ed to the Nativity. Many essays touch on the blossoming of Christmas customs, leg- ends, symbols, and foods in medieval and Renaissance Europe, as well as the expansion of the Christmas season that took place during that era. Further essays outline the decline of Christmas following the Protestant Reformation, as well as examine its resurgence in the Victorian era. The Encyclopedia also covers the continuing evolution XVI of the holiday in the twentieth century, noting the development of new symbols and customs, such as those represented by the Christ- mas seal and the Christmas club, as well as the growing popularity of Santa Claus, the Christmas tree, the Christmas gift, and other modern Christmas customs. The book is international in scope, offering 39 entries dealing wholly or mostly with the Christmas season in other countries. These essays cover Christmas celebrations in European, Asian, Middle Eastern, African, and Latin American countries. Additional information about foreign Christmas customs appears throughout the volume. For ex- ample, there is no entry on Jamaica or the Bahamas, but the \"Jonkon- nu\" entry describes an important Jamaican and Bahamian Christmas custom. Therefore, readers are encouraged to use the index to locate all pertinent information on a geographic location, ethnic group, or any other subject. New to the Second Edition The second edition adds 60 new entries to the Encyclopedia. These entries greatly expand coverage of New Year's Eve and Day, Christmas in the United States, and Christmas celebrations in foreign countries. The Encyclopedia now offers 21 entries treating New Year's customs, observances, and symbols. Additional information can be found in Christmas-centered entries throughout the Encyclopedia and is easily located with the aid of the index. The expanded coverage of New Year's Eve and Day celebrations focuses on the western New Year's Day, falling seven days after Christmas on January 1. Other New Year's holidays — such as Chinese New Year — that are unrelated culturally, religiously, or calendrically to Christmas have not been covered. Readers interested in American Christmas and New Year's celebra- tions may now consult 49 entries dealing wholly or in good part with the customs, history, and symbols of these holidays as they are celebrated in the United States. For a complete listing, see United States of America, Christmas and New Year's Celebrations in the. These entries expand the historical coverage of the holiday and detail, for example, how American slaves celebrated Christmas as well as discuss the history of Christmas in the White House. They also survey pop culture contributions to the American holiday sea- xvii son, such as football bowl games, Christmas villages, and a number of the nation's favorite Christmas movies and television specials. New entries also discuss Christmas observances in several distinc- tive American towns and cities such as Williamsburg, Virginia, Beth- lehem, Pennsylvania, and New York City. Seventeen new entries increase the book's coverage of Christmas in foreign countries. Four describe Christmas in Middle Eastern coun- tries, and five cover Christmas in African countries. New entries on Christmas in India, Australia, and the Marshall Islands shed further light on Asian, Pacific, and Pacific Islands Christmas celebrations. Several other new entries enhance the book's coverage of eastern European Christmas celebrations. Entries and References Entries range in length from about 100 words to well over 2,500 words. Suggestions for further reading follow each essay. The En- cydopedia of Christmas and Neiu Year's Celebrations is thoroughly cross- referenced. Within each article words in boldfaced type and see-also references guide the reader to further entries containing information on the same or related subjects. Each entry is followed by one or more sources for further reading. In some instances, sources consulted in writing the entry were not list- ed after the text of the entry, especially if the work contained little pertinent information, was especially scholarly, difficult to obtain, or out of print. A full bibliography of all sources consulted appears at the end of the book. Though not included in the further reading lists. Colliers Encyclopedia, Encyclopedia Britannica, Webster's New Uni- versal Unabridged Dictionary, Microsoft Encarta 2001 Standard En- cyclopedia, and the Oxford English Dictionary were freely consulted in the writing of a number of entries. Appendices Three appendices supplement the Encyclopedia: Appendix 1: Bibliography — Contains a complete listing of books and articles consulted. xvui Appendix 2: Web Sites — Furnishes addresses for more than seventy web sites offering information on a wide variety of Christmas-relat- ed topics. Countless Christmas sites populate the World Wide Web. Those appearing in the Encyclopedia, either in further reading lists or this appendix, were chosen for inclusion because they were deemed to offer substantial information presented by reliable sources. Appendix 3: Associations — Lists groups whose missions relate to Christmas in some way. A brief summary of the group's purpose, available publications, and full contact information accompanies each listing. Index The index provides the reader with an important tool for getting the most out of this book.

This couple, known as Adam and Eve, lived there in bliss until they took the advice of a serpent and disobeyed God's command not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. As punishment for their disobedience, God expelled them from the Garden, thus compelling them to work for their living, suffer pain, and eventually die. Medieval Christians honored Adam and Eve as the father and mother of all people and commemorated their story on December 24, the day before Christmas. Eastern Christians, that is, those Christians whose traditions of belief and worship developed in the Middle East, eastern Europe, and north Africa, were the first to honor Adam and Eve as saints. Their cult spread from eastern lands to western Europe during the Middle Ages, becoming quite popular in Europe by the year 1000. Although the Roman Catholic Church never formally adopted the pair as saints, it did not oppose their veneration. Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition Commemorating the lives of Adam and Eve on December 24 pro- moted comparison of Adam and Eve with Jesus and the Virgin Mary. Medieval theologians were fond of making such compar- isons, the point of which was to reveal how Jesus and Mary, through their obedience to God's will, rescued humanity from the conse- quences of Adam and Eve's disobedience. Indeed, the Bible itself refers to Jesus as the \"second Adam\" (Romans 5:14). Whereas hu- manity inherited biological life from the first Adam, it would imbibe spiritual life from Jesus, the second Adam (1 Corinthians 15: 22, 45, 49). Some theologians took this to mean that Jesus' coming could restore humankind to a state of grace lost when Adam and Eve were exiled from Eden. In like manner, Mary would undo the effects of Eve's disobedience. When the angel Gabriel visited Mary and deliv- ered the message that she would bear a divine son, Mary replied, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word\" (Luke 1:38; see also Annunciation). Medieval commen- tators relished the fact that in Latin, Eve's name, Eva, read back- wards spelled Ave, meaning \"hail.\" Ave Maria, or \"Hail Mary\" were the first words that the angel Gabriel spoke to the Virgin Mary. The spelling of these two short words seemed to them to symbolize God's plan to reverse the consequences of Eve's deed by bring a sav- ior into the world through the Virgin Mary. Medieval Christians celebrated Adam and Eve's feast day with a kind of mystery play referred to as the paradise play (for more on the paradise play, see Paradise Tree). This little folk drama retold the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. It ended with the promise of the com- ing of a savior who would reconcile humanity with God. The paradise play was often staged around a single prop called a paradise tree. Actors adorned an evergreen tree with apples and sometimes also with communion wafers. Decked out in this way it served to represent the two mystical trees in the Garden of Eden: the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life. Although the church officially banned the performance of mystery plays in the fifteenth century, the people of France and Germany's Rhine river region kept on decorat- ing paradise trees for Christmas. Some writers believe that the par- adise tree evolved into what we now know as the Christmas tree. Indeed, as late as the nineteenth century people in some parts of Germany customarily placed figurines representing Adam, Eve, and Advent the serpent under their Christmas trees. In some sections of Bavaria, people still hang apples upon their evergreens at Christmas time and refer to the decorated trees as paradise trees. As the Middle Ages receded into history, so too did the western European feast of Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve have retained a bit more of their ancient importance among certain Eastern Christians. The Greek Orthodox Church still honors Adam and Eve on the Sunday before Christmas. Further Reading Cross, F. L., and E. A.

Advent Christmas Lent, Little Lent, St. Philip's Fast, Winter Lent The word 'Advent\" comes from the Latin word adventus, which means \"coming\" or \"arrival.\" The Advent season serves as a period of spiritual preparation for the coming of Christmas. Advent calls Christians to reflect on both the birth of Jesus and on the Second Coming of Christ {see also Jesus, Year of Birth). In Western Christi- anity Advent begins on the Sunday closest to November 30, St. An- drew's Day, and lasts till December 24, thereby extending over a period of 22 to 28 days. In the Orthodox Church Advent begins on November 15. The Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, and Lu- theran traditions view Advent as the beginning of the Church year. Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition The liturgical color for Advent is purple, reflecting the repentant mood characteristic of early Church Advent observances. By con- trast, many popular customs associated with this period joyfully anticipate the coming of Christmas. History In 490 A.D. Bishop Perpetuus of Tours, France, established a period of penance and preparation for Christmas in his diocese. He advocated fasting on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for a forty-day period preceding Christmas. This fast period began on the day after Mar- tinmas, November 11, thereby acquiring the name \"St. Martin's Lent\" or \"The Forty Days' Fast of St. Martin.\" The observation of a period of penance in preparation for Christmas gradually spread throughout France, and on to Spain and Germany, though it may have been largely restricted to monastic communities. In Spain groups of Christians were already fasting in preparation for Epipha- ny. In the early years there was little agreement regarding the dates and length of this pre-Christmas fast period. In some areas the fast began on November 11. In others, September 24, November 1, or December 1 might be the starting date. In 581 a.d. the Council of Macon ordered the laity throughout France to observe the forty-day period of fasting. Two hundred years later the Advent fast was adopted in England as well. Advent was not observed in Rome until the sixth century. Pope Gregory I (590-604 a.d.) developed much of the Roman Advent liturgy and shortened the period of observance from six to four weeks. The joyous, festive spirit with which the Romans celebrated Advent clashed with the somber, penitential mood established in Gallic observances. For a number of centuries Advent celebrations throughout western Europe varied in tone, length, and manner of observance. Sometime after 1000 a.d. Rome accepted the practice of fasting during Advent, which in those times meant abstaining from amusements, travel for purposes of recreation, and marital relations, as well as certain foods. In addition, no weddings were permitted during fast periods. By the thirteenth century the observance of Advent in western Eu- rope had stabilized. It combined the Roman tradition of a four-week Advent observance, the Gallic custom of fasting, and a liturgy that mingled the themes of penance and joy. In recent centuries the Roman Cath- olic Church reduced, and eventually eliminated. Advent fasting. The Orthodox Church The Orthodox churches of eastern Europe developed different tradi- tions. Since the eighth century Orthodox believers have fasted in preparation for Christmas. Orthodox believers fast by eliminating meat, fish, dairy products, wine, and olive oil from their diets for a set period of time. A common Orthodox term for Advent is \"Little Lent.\" In the Greek tradition. Advent is often called \"Christmas Lent,\" a period that lasts from November 15 until the eve of Decem- ber 24 and is observed with fasting, prayer, and almsgiving {see also Greece, Christmas in). The Orthodox period of preparation before Christmas may also be called \"St. Philip's Fast\" because it begins the day after St. Philip's Day. Armenian Orthodox believers fast for three weeks out of a seven-week Advent period, which runs from Novem- ber 15 till January 6. Orthodoxy does not maintain a special liturgy for this period {see also Armenia, Christmas in). Folk Customs The folk customs of Advent reflect the anticipation and joy that characterize the weeks preceding Christmas in many countries. In many lands Nativity scenes are constructed and displayed. Advent may also be a favorite time of year to attend special Christmas con- certs and performances. Many customs connected with the season feature the lighting of Advent candles. Indeed, the candle has become a symbol of the season. Some Christians fashion and dis- play Jesse trees and Chrismon trees in observance of Advent. Others attend special church services, such as the Anglican Cere- mony of Lessons and Carols. The Advent wreath keeps adults focused on the spiritual message of Advent. The Advent calendar offers children a toy to help them count the days until Christmas. Other children's customs include writing letters to the child Jesus or Santa Claus {see also Children's Letters) and participating in the Hispanic folk play called Las Posadas, in which children and adults recreate the Holy Family's search for a place to spend the night in Bethlehem. Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition Frauentragen, or \"woman carrying,\" is a German Advent custom which closely resembles Las Posadas. Children carry a picture or fig- urine representing the Virgin Mary to a neighborhood home. Once there, they sing or enact a brief scene from the Nativity story, say a prayer, and place the picture or figurine near the family crucifix. The children return for the image the following evening and carry it to a new home. In this way they act out Mary and Joseph's search for lodging in Bethlehem. On Christmas Eve the children carry Mary back to the church, where she takes her place in the Nativity scene. Musical folk plays were once a popular Advent custom in Germany. Known as Herbergsuchen, or \"search for the inn,\" this folk drama also reenacted Mary and Joseph's search for shelter in Bethlehem. The play ended happily with the birth of the baby Jesus in a stable. In Latin America and central Europe the nine days before Christmas take on a special character. In Latin America many people partici- pate in a popular novena in honor of the Christ child. A novena is a series of special religious services or private devotions held on nine consecutive days. In Europe the nine days before Christmas were sometimes called the \"Golden Nights,\" as many of the religious observances and popular celebrations that characterized the period occurred after dark.

Advent Calendar Web Site The German Embassy in Washington, D.C., offers a page describing Advent customs in Germany: http://www.germany-info.org/xmas/ch_16.html ^%!M Advent Calendar Advent calendars help children count the days between the begin- ning of Advent and Christmas. By furnishing a treat for each day of Advent, these one-page calendars help curb the impatience of coun- tless children in many countries who long for the arrival of Christ- mas Day. The history of the Advent calendar is uncertain, although some writers believe that it was invented in Germany around the turn of the twentieth century. Advent calendars may take many forms, but each offers a playful method for checking off the days between December first and twen- ty-fifth. In the United States one often finds the calendars printed onto double layers of paperboard (for a list of entries treating American history and customs, see United States of America, Christmas in). A Christmas scene with the numbers one through twenty-five incor- porated into the design decorates the surface of the calendar. Per- forations around the numbers allow children to fold back or remove a number each day, revealing the tiny images printed on the bottom layer below. These images generally depict a Christmas or Advent theme. Some calendars attach chocolates or other sweets behind the fold- back dates on the calendar. In Germany cardboard houses may serve as the basis for homemade Advent calendars. Behind doors and windows children find edible goodies. Creative German crafters may even use matchboxes or walnut shells as devices for marking off the days of Advent and delivering tiny treats to children. The less inven- tive may press regular wall calendars into service by gluing candy, pictures, or verses to each of the December days before Christmas. Finally, in recent years one can find a variety of interactive Advent calendars posted on the World Wide Web (see Appendix 2).

Advent Candle A number of different Advent customs require the lighting of can- dles. Some writers believe that the use of candles during Advent may have been adopted from the fires and lights that illuminated pre- Christian midwinter festivals. Before the widespread use of electric lighting, the twinkling candles not only served to dispel the gloom of the long winter nights, but also represented the hope of light and life to come. In Christian terms, the flame of the Advent candle repre- sents the coming of Jesus, \"the light of the world\" Qohn 8:12). Placing a lighted candle in the windowsill is perhaps the simplest Advent candle custom. In Europe during centuries past, a flickering candle in the window symbolized the offer of hospitality to night- time wayfarers. Some believed the glowing light might even attract the Christ child. The Irish brought with them the tradition of placing a lighted candle in the windowsill at Christmas time when they emi- grated to the United States {see also Ireland, Christmas in). In the late nineteenth century groups of carolers popularized the custom in Boston. From there the practice spread to other American cities. The citizens of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, keep candles in their win- dows at Christmas time, though they trace their tradition back to the town's Moravian founders (for more on Moravian Christmas customs, see Christingle; Lovefeast; Watch Night). Christmas time candles also twinkle in the windows of historic Williamsburg, Virginia. The custom there developed as a means of decorating historic district Advent Candle homes in a manner consistent with the town's colonial architecture and decor. In the American Southwest people decorate the exteriors of their homes with luminarias, candles placed in brown paper bags filled with sand. This custom originated in Mexico. Many churches hold special candle-lighting services sometime during Advent. Often, each person attending is given a candle {see also Christingle) . The lighting of these candles then becomes part of the service. Advent wreaths may be found in both home and church Advent observances. These wreaths contain four candles, one for each of the four Sundays of Advent. One is lit on the first Sunday of Advent. One more candle is lit on each of the following Sundays until on the fourth Sunday of Advent all four candles burn in unison. These four Advent candles may also be used without a wreath. {See also Christmas Candles.) Further Reading Augustine, Peg, comp. Cotne to Christmas. Nastiville, Tenn.: Abingdon Press, 1993.

Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition AdventWreatf} Many Christians enhance their observance of Advent with an Ad- vent wreath. Although Germany's Lutheran community is credited with popularizing this custom sometime in the nineteenth century, its ultimate origins may lie in the pre-Christian practice of fashion- ing winter festival decorations from evergreen boughs. Whatever its origins, the symbols and customs connected with today's Advent wreath represent the spiritual significance of the Christian Advent season. Advent wreaths are used in both home and church obser- vances. Advent wreaths are usually fashioned out of greenery and are meant to lie on a flat surface or to hang horizontally from the ceiling. Four candles are incorporated into the wreath. They symbolize eter- nal life, as does the circular design of the wreath {see also Christmas Candles). Purple candles are often found in wreaths designed for church use, since purple is the liturgical color of the Advent season. Finally, a larger white candle, known as the Christ or Christmas can- dle, is placed in the center of the wreath or off to one side. The white color of this candle coincides with the liturgical colors for Christmas Day, white or gold. Some churches do not follow the liturgical color scheme, however. Wreaths made for home observances employ candles of various shades. For example, red and white candles are often found in European Advent wreaths. 10 Advent Wreath On the first Sunday of Advent, the first of the four candles in the wreath is Ht. On the second Sunday, the second candle joins the first. By the fourth Sunday in Advent all four candles glow in unison. Finally, on Christmas or Christmas Eve, the Christ candle flickers alongside the others. The ever increasing amount of light given off by the candles represents the spiritual illumination hoped for in the Advent season. The Christ candle, bigger and brighter than the rest, symbolizes the arrival of Jesus, \"the light of the world\" Qohn 8:12), and Christmas, the culmination of the Advent season. This lighting of candles at the darkest time of year may also stand for commit- ment to one's faith in times of darkness. In some home observances, family and friends pray, sing, or read spiritual texts by the light of the Advent wreath. An old German custom suggests adding one paper star to the wreath for each day in Advent. The star carries an Old Testament verse on one side and a New Testament verse on the other. Children might then be expected to memorize these verses. Many assign special significance to each of the four wreath candles. Some say they represent the four gifts of the Holy Spirit: hope, joy, peace, and love. Others use them to represent the themes of the Advent season. Thus they may signify hope, preparation, joy, love, or light. Still others tell the story of Jesus' birth with the candles, allow- ing each to stand for some of the important figures associated with the Nativity, such as the prophets, angels, shepherds, and the Magi.

The European immi- grants who settled in the thirteen American colonies brought these controversies with them. Among colonial Americans, attitudes to- wards Christmas depended largely on religious affiliation. In general, Puritans, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Quakers refused to celebrate the holiday. In areas of the country settled pri- marily by people of these religious affiliations, Christmas withered. By contrast, those who belonged to the Anglican (or Episcopalian), Dutch Reformed, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic traditions general- ly approved of the holiday. Communities composed primarily of people from these denominations planted the seeds of Christmas in this country. The First American Christmas The first Christmas celebration in what was later to become the con- tinental United States took place in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565 (for a list of entries treating American history and customs, see United States of America, Christmas in). Old documents inform us that Father Francisco Lopez de Mendoza Grajales presided over a Christ- mas service held at the Nombre de Dios Mission in that year. The Shrine of Nuestra Sefiora de la Leche now marks this location. The town of St. Augustine boasts of being the oldest settlement founded by Europeans in what is now the United States. Still, residents of Tallahassee, Florida, suspect that an even earlier Christmas celebra- tion may have been held near the site of their town. In 1539 a party of Spanish colonists, led by explorer Hernando de Soto (c. 1500- 1542), camped near the place where Tallahassee now stands. Since the Spaniards stayed from October 1539 to March of the following year, some Floridians speculate that they must have celebrated Christmas there. 13 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition The First Christmas in the English Colonies In Jamestown, Virginia, a ragged band of Englishmen huddled to- gether on Christmas morning in the year 1607. Although one hun- dred hopeful settlers had left England in order to found this, the first American colony, less than forty were still alive to celebrate their first Christmas in the New World. Their leader. Captain John Smith, was gone. He had left them to barter for food with the local Indians, and, according to legend, returned alive thanks only to the intervention of a young Indian woman named Pocahontas. Although the settlers had little food with which to rejoice, they still observed Christmas Day with an Anglican worship service. Virginia and the South In Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas the majority of early settlers were Anglicans of English descent. In the second half of the seven- teenth century, as their way of life grew more secure, they began to reproduce the festive Christmas they had known in their homeland {see also Williamsburg, Virginia, Christmas in Colonial). They cel- ebrated with feasting, drinking, dancing, card playing, horse racing, cock fighting, and other games. Although Anglican churches offered Christmas worship services, these apparently did not play a large role in colonial Christmas celebrations. Wealthy plantation owners who lived in large houses aspired to fill the Christmas season with lavish entertainments of all sorts. For many, this festive period lasted until Twelfth Night. By the eighteenth century these wealthy south- erners studded their holiday season with balls, fox hunts, bountiful feasts, and openhanded hospitality. One year guests at a Christmas banquet hosted by a wealthy Virginia planter named George Wash- ington, who later became the first president, dined sumptuously on the following dishes: turtle soup, oysters, crab, codfish, roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, venison, boiled mutton, suckling pig, smoked ham, roast turkey, several dishes of vegetables, biscuits, cornbread, various relishes, cakes, puddings, fruits, and pies. Wines, cordials, and a special holiday drink known as eggnog usually rounded out the plantation Christmas feast. Although wealthy parents might give a few presents to their children on Christmas or New Year's Day, this practice was not widespread. More common was the practice of making small gifts to the poor, to one's servants, or to one's slaves. 14 America, Christmas in Colonial The less well-off could not reproduce the splendor of a plantation Christmas, but they could still celebrate with good food and good cheer. In addition, southerners of all classes saluted Christmas morn- ing by shooting off their guns and making all sorts of noise. Those who did not own muskets banged on pots and pans or lit fireworks. Slaves were usually given a small tip or gift and some leisure time at Christmas. Since they had to prepare the parties and feasts for every- one else, however, their workload increased in certain ways at this time of year. Southern colonists transported a number of old English Christmas customs to the New World including Christmas carols. Yule logs, kissing under the mistletoe, and decking homes with greenery. Southern schoolboys of this era sometimes resorted to the Old World custom of barring out the schoolmaster in order to gain a few days off at this festive time of year. New England The first bands of settlers to colonize New England were mostly made up of Puritans, members of a minority religious sect in Eng- land. They advocated a simplified style of worship and the elimina- tion of many religious holidays, including Christmas. Although they came to America in search of religious freedom, once here, the Puri- tan settlers established rules and laws favoring their religion above all others, as was the custom in Europe at the time. In Plymouth colony, the first European settlement in New England, Puritan lead- ers frowned upon Christmas from the very beginning. In 1621, one year after their arrival from England, Governor William Bradford dis- covered young men playing ball games in the streets on Christmas Day. He sent them back to their work, remarking in his diary that while he may have permitted devout home observances, he had no intention of allowing open revelry in the streets. In 1659 Massa- chusetts Bay Colony made Christmas illegal. Any person found observing Christmas by feasting, refraining from work, or any other activity was to be fined five shillings. In 1681, however, pressure from English political authorities forced colonists to repeal this law. The anti- Christmas sentiment continued, though, and most people went on treating Christmas like any other workday. Many Puritan 15 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition colonists resented the presence of the few Anglicans in their midst, especially if they were British officials. On Christmas Day in 1706 a Puritan gang menaced worshipers at the King's Chapel in Boston, breaking windows in protest against the Anglican worship service taking place inside. The very fact that Puritan leaders passed a law against the holiday suggests that some New Englanders were tempted to make merry on that day. Historic documents record a few instances of seven- teenth-century Christmas revelers and mummers being cold-shoul- dered by their more severe neighbors. The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries witnessed a slight thawing in Puritan attitudes towards Christmas, as the New England colonies began to fill with people from a wider variety of religious backgrounds. Many still crit- icized drinking, gaming, flirting, feasting, and mumming as unholy acts of abandon that dishonored the Nativity of Christ, but some now accepted the idea of marking the day of Jesus' birth with religious devotions. Nevertheless, noted Puritan minister Cotton Mather (1663- 1728) clearly warned his congregation against secular celebrations of the holiday in his Christmas Day sermon of 1712: Can you in your conscience think that our Holy Saviour is honored by Mad Mirth, by long eating, by hard Drinking, by lewd Gaming, by rude Revelling? ... If you will yet go on and do Such Things, I forewarn you That the Burning Wrath of God will break forth among you [Christmas in Colonial and Early America, 1996, 12]. In eighteenth-century New England, Christmas services could be found in Anglican, Dutch Reformed, Universalist, and other church- es representing pro-Christmas denominations. New York and Pennsylvania New York and Pennsylvania hosted significant numbers of Dutch and German immigrants. Denominational differences divided many of these immigrants on the subject of Christmas. In general, the Mennonites, Brethren, and Amish rejected Christmas. The Luthe- rans, Reformed, and Moravians cherished the holiday and honored it with church services as well as folk celebrations {see also Lovefeast 16 America, Christmas in Colonial and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Christmas in). Like their English counterparts in the South, the pro-Christmas communities in New York and Pennsylvania ate and drank their way through the Christ- mas holiday. In addition, both the Dutch and the Germans brought a rich tradition of Christmas baking to this country, including the making of special Christmas cookies, such as gingerbread. In fact, the American English word \"cookie\" comes from the Dutch word koek, meaning \"cake.\" This in turn gave rise to the term koekje, mean- ing \"cookie\" or \"little cake.\" German immigrants brought other Christmas customs with them as well. As early as the mid-eighteenth century Moravian communities in Pennsylvania were celebrating the day with Christmas pyramids. Other early German communities imported the beliefs and customs surrounding the German folk figures Christkindel and Knecht Ru- precht, whose gift-giving activities delighted children at Christmas time. Although the Germans probably also introduced the Christ- mas tree, no records of this custom can be found until the nine- teenth century. In addition to its large German population, Pennsylvania became home to many Scotch Irish and Quakers. Both the Scotch Irish, most of whom were Presbyterians, and the Quakers disapproved of Christ- mas celebrations in general. The Quakers adamantly opposed all raucous street revels, including those of German belsnickelers, mum- mers, and masqueraders of all kinds. In the nineteenth century, when Quakers dominated Philadelphia and Pennsylvania state govern- ment, they passed laws to prevent noisy merrymaking in the streets at Christmas time (see also America, Christmas in Nineteenth- Century). The German Christmas blended lively folk customs with devout reli- gious observances. This combination eventually became typical of American Christmas celebrations. At least one researcher has con- cluded that increased immigration from the German-speaking coun- tries in the second half of the eighteenth century profoundly influ- enced the American Christmas. The increasing number of Germans permitted their balanced approach to Christmas to spread among the wider population and so encouraged the festival to flourish in the United States. 17 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition Conclusion The colonial American Christmas differed significantly from con- temporary American Christmas celebrations. Many religious people completely ignored the day. Even after the founding of the United States no state recognized Christmas as a legal holiday. Those peo- ple who celebrated it anyway did so without Santa Claus, Christ- mas cards, Christmas trees, and elaborate Christmas morning gift exchanges. Instead, the most common ways to observe the holiday featured feasting, drinking, dancing, playing games, and engaging in various forms of public revelry. Although the colonies attracted peo- ple from many different countries, English, German, and Dutch set- tlers exercised the strongest influence on early American Christmas celebrations.

These variations reflected religious and ethnic differences in the population. In Puri- tan New England, for example, many people ignored the holiday {see America, Christmas in Colonial). In Pennsylvania German- American communities reproduced a number of German Christmas traditions. Prosperous Southerners, especially those of Anglican English or French descent, hosted lavish Christmas meals and par- ties. All across the country many of those who celebrated Christmas in nineteenth-century America did so with noisy, public, and some- times drunken, reveling. By contrast, non-observers tried to ignore the noise and the festivities. They treated the day as any other work- day, since it was not a legal holiday in most of the century. During the second half of the nineteenth century, however, more and more people began celebrating Christmas. Regional and religious dif- ferences faded as new American Christmas customs emerged. These customs helped to transform the American Christmas into the tran- quil, domestic festival we know today. As the century rolled on, larg- er numbers of people incorporated customs and myths surrounding the Christmas tree, Santa Claus, and family gift exchanges into their Christmas celebrations. The Civil War (1861-65) served as a watershed in American Christmas observances, after which time the commercial trappings of the holiday — especially Christmas cards, store-bought gifts, store window displays, and wrapping paper — took on greater importance. New York and Pennsylvania In the early nineteenth century some New Yorkers and Pennsyl- vanians celebrated Christmas with mumming and other forms of noisy, public merrymaking. Young men of German extraction carried out their own variation of mumming known as \"belsnickeling\" (see 19 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition Knecht Ruprecht). In Pennsylvania Dutch country, students some- times celebrated Christmas by barring out the schoolmaster. In New York brazen parties of drunk men sang, played instruments, and shouted in the streets on Christmas Eve, disturbing the sleep of more serious-minded citizens. On New Year's Day custom dictated that ladies stay at home to exchange New Year's greetings with a string of gentlemen callers, all of whom were entertained with food and drink. For gentlemen with a wide range of female acquain- tances, this custom presented yet another opportunity to consume large quantities of alcohol. Christmas mumming occurred in both New York and Pennsylvania, to the dismay of those who favored a more solemn observance of the season. In addition to those customs it shared with New York, Pennsylvania boasted its own highly developed noisemaking traditions during this era. In Philadelphia young men wandered the streets during the Christmas season, drinking, shooting off firecrackers, shouting, and sometimes fighting with one another. Some even strutted about in costume and were referred to as \"fantasticals.\" Many of these cele- brants wandered about the downtown blowing horns on Christmas Eve. Those who could not lay their hands on horns added to the pandemonium with tin whistles, sailors' hornpipes, tin pans, hand- held bells, sleigh bells, or homemade instruments. In the year 1861 these mock minstrels raised such a racket that they reduced the cen- ter of the city to chaos. The city government, dominated by those who did not celebrate Christmas, made two attempts to outlaw parading, masquerading, and horn playing on Christmas Eve, once in 1868 and again in 1881. The practice proved too deeply rooted to stamp out, however Even- tually, the city instituted the New Year's Day Mummers Parade, which modified these activities and channeled them into a con- trolled format. This popular parade continues today. {For other nine- teenth-century Pennsylvania customs, see Amish Christmas.) The South Southerners also celebrated Christmas by making noise. Men shot off guns both on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Firecrackers and gunpowder explosions added to the din. Children without access to 20 America, Christmas in Nineteenth -Century either of these items sometimes celebrated by popping inflated hog bladders, the nineteenth-century farm equivalent of a balloon. South- ern Christmas celebrations featured so many bangs and explosions that some witnesses said they rivaled Independence Day celebra- tions. In 1902 an article printed in a New York newspaper claimed that New York manufacturers had sold $1 million worth of fireworks to Southern buyers during the Christmas season. In addition to noisemaking, residents of many Southern cities also enjoyed dressing in costume on Christmas Eve. In some places they were referred to as \"fantasticals,\" like their fellow celebrants in Penn- sylvania. Baltimore, Savannah, Mobile, and St. Augustine hosted ver- sions of this Christmas Eve masquerade. Arrayed in costumes rang- ing from funny to frightening, residents sallied forth to promenade up and down the main streets of the town. Something similar sur- vives today in New Orleans' Mardi Gras celebrations. Lastly, many residents of the former French territories, which became the states of Louisiana and Missouri, celebrated Christmas with French customs. These customs included assembling Nativity scenes, attending Mid- night Mass, cooking up sumptuous reveillon suppers, and hosting parties in honor of New Year's Eve and Twelfth Night. The Slaves The slaves developed Christmas customs of their own. In North Carolina some celebrated Jonkonnu. Some slaves observed an all- night vigil on Christmas Eve during which they sang, danced, and prayed. Throughout the South slaves greeted white folk on Christ- mas morning with the cry of \"Christmas gif!\" According to custom, the white person responded by giving them a present, either a coin or a gift. In addition, slaveowners often distributed presents of cloth- ing, shoes, blankets and other necessities to their slaves at Christmas time. Some slaveowners provided their slaves with extra rations of food at Christmas, including meat, which was something the slaves rarely ate during the rest of the year. Slaveowners frequently provid- ed ample portions of liquor as well. At many plantations slaves cele- brated Christmas by dressing in their best clothes, feasting, and dancing. At other plantations slaves worked through the Christmas holidays. Sometimes slaveowners withheld the privilege of celebrat- 21 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition ing Christmas from those slaves who had displeased them during the year. Others gave presents only to women who had borne babies or to the most productive workers. Abolitionist Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) later looked back on the customs of the plantation Christmas as mechanisms for controlling the slaves. He argued that days of drunken carousing subtly convinced some slaves that they were incapable of productive behavior if left to their own devices. After Slavery In the late nineteenth century African-American Christmas celebra- tions varied quite a bit. Some African Americans celebrated a mod- est Christmas, exchanging gifts of homemade food and clothing and attending church. Visitors to the Indiana State Museum's Freetown Village, a permanent, living-history exhibit, can watch a play that reenacts an 1870s African-American Christmas of this type. Others reproduced some of the old customs of the plantation Christmas. The children greeted any adult they could find with the cry of \"Christmas gift!\" and the adults danced, drank to excess, and refrained from work. African-American educator Booker T. Washington (1856-1915) ob- served these conditions in Tuskegee, Alabama, in the 1880s. As head of the town's newly founded school for African Americans (now Tuskegee University), he made it a point to teach his students to cel- ebrate a sober Christmas, dedicated at least in part to religious ob- servance and to aiding the less fortunate. The West Out on the Western frontier men celebrated Christmas by shooting off their guns and banging on tin pans in noisy and often drunken processions. In Minnesota settlers of Swedish descent attended Julotta services on Christmas morning {see also Christmas Carol). Texans celebrated with Christmas Eve balls. Throughout the South- west many of Hispanic descent staged Las Posadas and Los Pas- tores, traditional Christmas folk plays. Christmas Becomes a Legal Holiday After the Revolution the newly established American government revoked all British holidays. This act left the United States without 22 America, Christmas in Nineteenth -Century any national festivals. In 1838 Louisiana was the first state to recog- nize Christmas as a legal holiday. One by one, the other states fol- lowed suit. Finally, on June 26, 1870, in recognition of the large num- ber of people who already observed the day. Congress declared Christmas to be a national holiday. Protestants Embrace Christmas Just as the states of the nation began to declare Christmas a legal holiday, many Protestant denominations that had previously reject- ed Christmas began to accept the festival. Between the years 1830 and 1870 Christmas slowly crept into Sunday school curriculums. The middle of the century also witnessed the publication of new American Christmas hymns. A number of these, such as \"O Little Town of Bethlehem,\" \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,\" and \"We Three Kings\" — all composed by clergymen — have become Christ- mas standards. By the end of the century Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, and Congregationalist churches were offering Christmas services on the Sunday nearest Christmas. Perhaps this change sig- nified that the passage of time had finally severed the connections made by many Protestants between Christmas, Roman Catholicism, and the religious oppression of past eras. AFestival of Home and Family The Christmas celebrations that the Protestant denominations were now embracing were not quite the same ones their ancestors had rejected. Several researchers of nineteenth-century American Christ- mas customs point out that as the century progressed many of the more boisterous elements of the festival diminished. These elements included mumming, belsnickeling, public drinking, and noisemak- ing. Americans increasingly viewed these activities as unworthy of the season. Instead, they began to create a tranquil celebration that focused on home and family ties. These changes probably encour- aged former non- celebrants, including many previously hostile Protestant denominations, to adopt the new version of the holiday. Several new Christmas customs helped to facilitate this transition to a more peaceful, domestic festival, including the Christmas tree, Christmas cards, the family gift exchange, and the new American gift bringer, Santa Claus. 23 America, Christmas in Nineteenth -Century Christmas Trees and Gift Giving Most colonial Americans who observed the day did not give Christ- mas gifts to their children. Eighteenth- century Americans were more likely to give gifts to servants or to those who performed ser- vices for them during the year {see Boxing Day). Likewise, many nineteenth-century Americans resisted the idea of exchanging Christ- mas gifts with friends and family because they viewed Christmas gifts as something one gave to social inferiors. At the turn of the nineteenth century those who did give presents to family members and neighbors frequently gave simple, homemade gifts, such as handsewn or knitted articles of clothing, wooden toys, or home- made preserves. Family gift giving appears to have been somewhat more frequent in German-American and Dutch-American commu- nities. In these areas children might receive fruits, nuts, and sweets from Christkindel or the local belsnickelers. Some adults in these communities also exchanged small gifts, such as handkerchiefs, scarves, or hats. Of those adult Americans who exchanged gifts dur- ing the winter holiday season, many did so on New Year's Day rather than on Christmas. Christmas gifts started to become more common about mid- centu- ry. Several factors contributed to this rise in popularity. First, people began to adopt the German custom of installing a Christmas tree in their parlors as a holiday decoration. The Germans covered their trees with good things to eat and small gifts. Hence, the tree focused everyone's attention on giving and receiving. In addition, because it stood at the center of the household, the tree showcased the family gift exchange. Whereas, in the past, some parents may have stuffed a few sweets into their children's stockings, they now could hang lit- tle gifts from a tree branch. Liberated from the tight quarters of the Christmas stocking, the gifts parents gave to children grew in size and substance. Before 1880 people usually hung their unwrapped gifts from the tree with thread or string. After that time, wrapping paper and fancy decorated boxes slowly became fashionable. As Christmas presents grew too large or heavy to hang on the tree, people began to place them beneath the tree. Although charity had been an element of Christmas celebrations for centuries {see also Europe, Christmas in Medieval), it became a 25 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition more prominent theme of the festival during the nineteenth century. Some writers credit the Christmas stories of English author Charles Dickens (1812-1870), especially A Christmas Carol, with significantly increasing public interest in Christmas charity. In addition, many ministers preached to their congregations about giving to those less fortunate. The Salvation Army took this message to heart in the 1890s, mounting a successful campaign to raise funds to provide the poor with bountiful Christmas dinners in large public halls. Santa Claus and Children's Gifts Santa Claus played an important role in the popularization of Christmas gift giving. This American folk figure became widely known in the second half of the nineteenth century, consolidating and replacing the lesser-known, ethnic gift bringers Christkindel (also known as Kriss Kringle), Belsnickel, and St. Nicholas. This bit of American folklore did not spring up from the masses of the Ameri- can folk, however. Literary and artistic figures, such as Clement C. Moore (1779-1863), the author of 'A Visit from St. Nicholas,\" and illustrator Thomas Nast (1840-1902), developed the myth and image of Santa Claus that became popular through their works. Never- theless, the American people quickly adopted him as their own. Santa delivered gifts to youngsters by visiting their homes on Christmas Eve. The increasing popularity of Santa Claus boosted the importance of gifts, especially gifts for children, in American Christ- mas celebrations. Commerce and Cards The decade following the Civil War witnessed a sudden rise in store- bought gift giving. Researchers have traced this upsurge to two com- plementary factors: consumer demand and commercial promotion. Although some people objected to the impersonality of store-bought gifts, others desired the new, manufactured goods. Moreover, retail- ers set about enticing the public into spending money on Christmas with such innovations as lavish store window displays, wrapping paper, and special advertising campaigns {see Commercialism). Stores began to schedule special holiday season hours to accommodate the seasonal increase in customers. In New York City shop doors re- 26 America, Christmas in Nineteenth -Century mained open until midnight during the Christmas season, generat- ing concern in some quarters for the pHght of overworked shop assistants. Christmas cards achieved widespread popularity by the 1880s, about the time when Americans began celebrating Christmas by exchang- ing store-bought gifts. According to one researcher, nineteenth-cen- tury cards replaced more personal yet more time-consuming ways of sending seasonal greetings, such as writing letters and visiting {see also Children's Letters). The cards anchored themselves more firm- ly among America's Christmas customs after the turn of the twenti- eth century, when people began to use cards to replace cheap gifts for more distant friends and relatives. Conclusion During the nineteenth century American Christmas celebrations be- gan to coalesce around customs that promoted symbolic exchanges of love and good will both between family members and in the wider community. These customs — the night visit of Santa Claus, Christmas trees, family gift exchanges, Christmas cards, and Christ- mas charity — still stand at the center of today's festivities. Through- out the nineteenth century regional differences in the celebration of Christmas diminished, although they never quite disappeared. The twentieth century would witness the further erosion of these region- al customs. Further Reading Barnett, James. The American Christmas. New York: Macmillan, 1954. Bigham, Shauna, and Robert E.

For example, they don't set up Christ- mas trees in their homes, tell their children about Santa Claus, and buy lots of expensive presents {see also Commercialism). Few deco- rate their homes in any way for the holiday, and those that send Christmas cards generally send them to their non-Amish friends. Instead, the Amish Christmas revolves around a few simple, home- spun pleasures. The Amish The Amish are Protestant Christians who maintain a lifestyle many Americans associate with centuries past. They reject most modern industrial and technological developments. Amish families continue to work their own farms without the aid of tractors or other motor- ized farm equipment, ride in horse-drawn buggies, and wear clothes popular two hundred or more years ago. The Amish came to this country in the eighteenth century to escape religious persecution in Europe. Here they found the freedom to worship as they wished and live in the manner they chose. Today's Amish speak English but also 28 Amish Christmas preserve the German dialect of their ancestors. Many Amish live in the state of Pennsylvania, but they can also be found in Ohio and other Midwestern states, as well as Canada. The Amish faith emerged from the Protestant Reformation, a six- teenth-century religious reform movement that gave birth to Prot- estant Christianity. Like the English and American Puritans, the Amish initially rejected the celebration of Christmas as a non-bibli- cal, frivolous, and sometimes even decadent holiday. A touch of this attitude remains today in their restrained observance of Christmas. Amish Christmas Customs Most Amish schools prepare Christmas pageants. Since Amish chil- dren attend school right up till Christmas Day, the pageant is gener- ally set for the afternoon of December 24. Parents and other relatives attend and watch with pride as their young people recite poems and take part in skits — many of which contain moral teachings about Christmas charity, faith, and love — and sing Christmas carols. Earlier that day the children may have taken part in a gift exchange in which each child, having drawn a slip of paper with another child's name on it, brings a present for that boy or girl. For most Amish, Christmas morning begins with farm chores. After- wards the family gathers for breakfast and Christmas gifts in the kitchen. In nineteenth-century Amish families, parents set out plates on the kitchen table and piled their children's presents on top. They usually gave their children things like nuts, raisins, cookies, candy, and rag dolls and other homemade toys. Other Pennsylvania Dutch families also set out Christmas plates in past times. The custom of setting out Christmas presents on the kitchen table seems to have died out among other groups, however. Today Amish families ex- change a few useful gifts on Christmas morning. Typical gifts include simple toys such as skates and sleds, books, homemade candies and cookies, kitchenware, and household items. A large Christmas din- ner completes the day's activities. On December 26 the Amish celebrate \"second Christmas.\" This cus- tom, once common in Pennsylvania Dutch country, came into being so that those who devoted much of December 25 to religious ob- 29 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition servance did not miss out on all the Christmas iim. It's a popular day for family outings, visits, games, and other leisure activities. {For more on Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas customs, see America, Christ- mas in Nineteenth-Century; Barring Out the Schoolmaster; Beth- lehem, Pennsylvania, Christmas in; Knecht Ruprecht.)

These popular Christmas symbols boast an ancient pedigree. They play a promi- nent role in the New Testament accounts of Jesus' birth {see also Gospel Accounts of Christmas; Gospel According to Luke; and Gospel According to Matthew). Angels also appear in many Old Testament stories. Biblical Angels The Hebrew scriptures (the Christian Old Testament) often use the term malakh, meaning \"messenger,\" to refer to the beings we call angels. Writing in Greek, the authors of Christian scripture called these beings angelos, a Greek term meaning \"messenger\" or \"her- ald.\" This word eventually passed into the English language as \"angel.\" Although the word \"angelos\" denoted an ordinary, human 30 Angels cS>q^>^q|S)q^>^q|S)Qe,iT^q!?,Qe,iT^>^Qeji^>^t3Sj*'*qf^qP>q^qf^'^q^'^'^q^'^qP'q^^^ messenger, biblical authors selected it over another available Greek term, daimon, which referred to a guardian spirit. Perhaps they dis- carded this term because Greek lore taught that the daimon exer- cised both good and evil influences over people. Eventually, the Greek word \"daimon\" passed into the English language as \"demon.\" The angels of biblical tradition frequently acted as messengers. In fact, angels served this function in both scriptural accounts of Jesus' birth. In Matthew's account of the Nativity an angel appeared to Joseph on three separate occasions. The first time the angel came to explain the nature of Mary's pregnancy. Later, an angel warned Joseph of Herod's evil intentions concerning Jesus and advised him to flee into Egypt {see also Flight into Egypt; Holy Innocents' Day). An angel returned one final time to inform Joseph of Herod's death and to command his return to Israel. In Luke's account of the Nativity, the angel Gabriel visited Mary to inform her that she would bear a child by the Holy Spirit. On the night of Jesus'birth an angel appeared to shepherds in a nearby field to announce the glo- rious event. Then a \"multitude\" of angels suddenly materialized be- hind the first angel, singing praises to God. What Angels Look Like With so many angels involved in orchestrating the events surround- ing Jesus' birth, it is no wonder that they became a symbol of the Christmas holiday. Today's Christmas angels frequently appear as winged human beings in flowing white robes with somewhat femi- 31 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition nine faces and haloes. This image evolved over the course of two millennia. The very first Christian depictions of angels date back to the time of the Roman Empire. Early Christian paintings of angels rendered them as ordinary men rather than as winged, spiritual beings. Some artists, however, garbed their angels in white robes, resembling a Roman senator's toga, in order to symbolize their power and dignity. The first winged angels appeared in the fourth century. Some schol- ars believe that early Christian artists patterned the image of winged angels after the Greek goddess Nike, the winged, female spirit of victory. Others trace this image back even further to winged spirits associated with the religion of ancient Babylon. By the fifth century Christian artists from the Byzantine Empire began to depict angels with a disk of light, called a nimbus, behind their heads. This nim- bus, or halo, signifies holiness, purity, and spiritual power. In medieval times most western European artists portrayed angels as masculine in face and form. This trend reversed itself from the four- teenth to the sixteenth centuries. After that time, western European angels acquired softer, more feminine, or androgynous, looks. Some- times they appeared as chubby children or toddlers. Artists often depicted angels with harps or other musical instruments. These emblems signify what some consider to be the primary occupation of angels — praising God. Further Reading Cross, R L., and E. A. Livingstone, eds. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church.

Annuncmtwn Annunciation means \"announcement.\" When spelled with a capital \"A,\" the word refers to the announcement made by Gabriel, God's messenger angel, to the Virgin Mary, telling her that she would bear a son by the Holy Spirit whom she should call Jesus (Luke 1:26-28). By the early Middle Ages the Church had established a feast day to commemorate this angelic announcement. In the middle of the fourth century. Church officials in Rome created a new festival to honor the birth of Jesus. They scheduled this festi- val, which we now call Christmas, on December 25. Eventually December 25 gained widespread acceptance as the actual date on which Jesus had been born, implying that Mary must have become pregnant nine months earlier, on March 25. According to the astro- nomical calculations used by the ancient Romans, the spring equi- nox also fell on that day {see also Winter Solstice). By the eighth century the Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, celebrated on March 25, was firmly established in western Europe. As Mary's pregnancy marked the beginning of a new era for Christians, many medieval kingdoms also chose March 25 as the day on which they began their new year {see also Kalends; New Year's Day). In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII called for calendar reforms which included switching New Year's Day to January 1 {see also Old Christ- mas Day). Nevertheless, several centuries passed before most Euro- pean countries had adopted the reformed, Gregorian calendar. Many Christians still recognize March 25 as a religious holiday, al- though they have slightly different names for the observance. Ro- man Catholics currently refer to the feast as the \"Annunciation of the Lord,\" the Orthodox know it as the \"Annunciation of the Mother of God,\" and many Anglicans call it the \"Annunciation of Our Lord to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\" The English also call the festival \"Lady Day.\" The Feast of the Annunciation often occurs during Lent. Those Christians who fast during Lent, for example, Roman Catholics and Orthodox, are allowed to modify the fast on this day. 33 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition Over the centuries the Annunciation became a favorite scene for western European painters interested in depicting the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The scene also appears frequently in stained glass windows and other church decorations. Many famous artists have bequeathed us their versions of the Annunciation, including Robert Campin (c. 1378-1444), Fra Angelico (c. 1400-1455), Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510), El Greco (1451-1614), Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519), and Adolphe -William Bouguereau (1825-1905). In these paintings Mary often appears to be reading or spinning when the angel arrives, activities which represent her piety. A container of water may sit beside her, or the angel may offer her lilies, both of which symbolize her purity. The Holy Spirit commonly takes shape as a descending dove or as a ray of light streaming through the window. Further Reading Auld, William Muir. Christmas Tidings. 1933. Reprint.

The reasons for this unusual date emerge quite literally from the pages of ancient history. In the fourth century Roman Catholic Church officials established the date of Christmas as December 25. Before that time the Armenians and some other Christians celebrat- ed the Nativity of Jesus and his baptism on the same day, January 6 {see also Epiphany). Eventually other Christian communities accept- ed the Roman date for the Nativity. The Armenians, however, never accepted the new date for Christmas and continued to celebrate it on January 6. When Pope Gregory XIII instituted the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Armenians rejected the reforms and stuck instead to the old, Julian calendar {see Old Christmas Day). Today Armenians living in the Holy Land still use the Julian calendar to determine their feast days. The Julian calendar is now a full thirteen days ahead of the Gregorian calendar. So, when these Armenians celebrate Christmas on January 6 according to the Julian calendar, the Gregorian calen- dar counts the day as January 19. In Bethlehem special services for Armenian Christians take place at the Church of the Nativity on January 19. New Year's Day and Christmas in Armenia In Armenia children receive gifts on New Year's Day. This custom began during the Soviet era (1917-91), when government officials discouraged the celebration of religious holidays such as Christmas. They promoted instead the celebration of New Year's, a secular holi- day, and tried to transfer some Christmas customs to this date. For example, they disapproved of Christmas gift bringers such as Ba- boushka, whose story includes biblical themes. Communist officials attempted to replace her with another popular folk figure. Grand- father Frost, the spirit of winter, who brings gifts to children on New Year's Day. Armenians still give children sweets and toys on 35 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition New Year's, but since the fall of the Communist government some people have begun to recognize the gift bringer as Father Christ- mas rather than Grandfather Frost. Adults also exchange gifts on this day. Popular presents include flowers, alcoholic beverages, and items made from silver. Armenian families prepare for Christmas by giving their homes a thorough cleaning. Housewives find ways to display their fancy needlework and spend hours in the kitchen cooking and baking. \"Princely trout,\" or ishkhanatsoog, is a popular Christmas Eve dish. Christmas church services begin at midnight on Christmas Eve. Ac- cording to tradition, heralds announce the services, striding through the streets with stout staves, chanting, \"Today is a great day of the feast of the birth of Jesus, Good News! O ye good Christians, come to the holy church.\" Church services are also held on Christmas Day, January 6. These services feature a ceremony known as the Blessing of the Waters, which commemorates Jesus' baptism. The priest uses a wand made from basil leaves to sprinkle water on the congregation. After church Armenians pay visits to friends and neighbors. A large family meal follows, at which close relatives, distant relatives, friends, and even strangers are welcome. Gifts of money and clothing are distributed after dinner. Then children grab handkerchiefs and band together in small groups that scurry up to the rooftops to sing: Rejoice and be glad Open your bag And fill our handkerchiefs Hallelujah, hallelujah. People who hear their cries offer them coins, nuts, and fruit. Further Reading Kasbarian, Lucine. Armenia. New York: Dillon Press, 1998. Terjimanian, Hagop.

The phrase \"auld lang syne\" is Scottish dialect for \"old long ago.\" The song itself is attributed to Robert Burns (1759-1796), Scotland's most famous poet. Robert Bums's Restoration Burns scholars recognize that the poet did not write the entire song. They point to a letter that Burns wrote to a friend in which Burns admits as much. Rather, he found a fragment of an old folk ditty, restored it, and added new verses. In the letter. Burns paid high trib- ute to the anonymous writer of the brief text that he elaborated on: Light be the turf on the breast of the heaven-inspired poet who composed this glorious fragment! There is more of the fire of native genius in it that in half a dozen of modern English Bacchanalians [Robert Bums Encyclopedia web page]. No one knows exactly how much of the song was written by Burns, but scholars believe that the poet definitely wrote what are now the song's third and fourth verses. Though Burns paired his lyrics with an already existing Scottish folk tune, his editor decided to publish them with a different old Scottish folk melody, the one we still use today. In Scotland the popularity of \"Auld Lang Syne\" grew over the years, until it displaced \"Good Night and Joy Be Wi'You A'\" as the song traditionally sung at the break up of a festive gathering. Words to the Song Subsequent generations of singers have made slight changes to Burns's original poetry. The verses to the entire song, as penned by Burns, follow: 37 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition Should auld acquaintance be forgot And never brought to mind?

The answer lies in the power of television to publicize and pro- mote, hi 1943, the New Year's Eve festivities taking place in New York City's Times Square were televised for the first time. As view- ers waited for midnight to arrive, they were treated to coverage of Guy Lombardo's dance band, playing live at the Grill Room of the Roosevelt Hotel (in later years the venue changed to the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel). Guy Lombardo decided to close out his New Year's Eve performances with the tune \"Auld Lang Syne.\" Having grown up in western Ontario, a region of Canada with a significant popula- tion of Scottish descent, he was familiar with the tune. In fact, when playing locally he frequently ended his performances with the song. Although he doubted that many Americans were familiar with \"Auld Lang Syne,\" he played it anyway as a way of musically tipping his hat to the broadcast's corporate sponsor, Robert Burns's Fanatella cigars. Guy Lombardo and his dance band became a fixture on these New Year's Eve broadcasts, and so did the song \"Auld Lang Syne.\" This yearly television exposure encouraged Americans to adopt as their own the custom of singing \"Auld Lang Syne\" to bid farewell to the old year.

Therefore, Australians celebrate the festival with barbecues, beach parties, parades and other outdoor events. In fact, many Australians take their summer vacations during the Christmas holiday season. The English brought Christmas to Australia in the late eighteenth century when they established the country as a colony of Great Britain. Australians have preserved much of their country's British Christmas heritage, especially carol singing, gift exchanges, Christ- mas trees, and the hearty, oven-roasted English Christmas dinner, though this last custom loses some of its appeal in the sweltering summer heat. Australia has adopted Santa Claus as its Christmas gift bringer, and many heavily sweating Santas, garbed in some vari- ation of the traditional red velvet suit, cap, boots and beard, can be found at Christmas-related events throughout the holiday season. Christmas Decorations The traditional pine Christmas tree, decorated with tinsel, orna- ments, and lights, is an important seasonal decoration in Australia. In addition to the tree, Australians have incorporated two local plants, the Christmas bell and the Christmas bush, into their holiday decorations. The Christmas bell produces green, glossy leaves and yellow or red bell-shaped flowers. Several different varieties of the Christmas bush put forth various kinds of flowers in the spring and summer, including one that sports white star-shaped flowers in the spring which drop to reveal brilliant red calyces at Christmas time. Some families decorate these plants with tinsel in honor of the holi- day. Finally, homes, schools, shops and other places of business cele- brate the season with displays of colored lights. Christmas Eve and Day On Christmas Eve many Australians attend carol-singing events known as \"Carols by Candlelight.\" Norman Banks, a radio announc- 40 Australia, Christmas in er from the city of Melbourne, started this tradition in 1938. It is said that while walking the streets on Christmas Eve of the previous year, he caught a glimpse of an old woman through a lighted window. She was sitting all alone next to her radio, holding a lighted candle and singing along with the Christmas carols that were being broadcast on the radio. The sight warmed his heart and also stirred him to create an event for those who found themselves alone on Christmas Eve. The following year he organized and broadcast \"Carols by Candlelight,\" a sing-along caroling session in which par- ticipants held lit candles. The observance became more and more popular and eventually spread from Melbourne to other cities. Each year thousands of Australians attend these events, usually held in outdoor amphitheaters so that people can enjoy the balmy summer evening air as they listen to musical performances and sing the songs of the season amidst a sea of glowing candles. In addition to the traditional European tunes, a number of original Australian Christmas carols may be sung, such as \"The Melbourne Carol,\" \"Six White Boomers,\" and \"The Three Drovers.\" Australian children have their own version of the Christmas stock- ing, which often makes its first appearance on Christmas Eve. Before going to bed Australian children hang pillowcases from the ends of their beds. Santa leaves small gifts in the pillowcase; he deposits larger gifts under the Christmas tree. Many Australian families open their presents over breakfast on Christmas morning. Religious people will also attend church. Later that afternoon many people enjoy listening to the Queen of England give her annual Christmas speech on the radio {see also England, Christmas in). Christmas Dinner Over the years Australians have come up with a number of Christ- mas dishes all their own. Some of these reflect the country's rugged colonial history. For example, a dish called \"colonial goose\" substi- tutes a stuffed leg of lamb for the more traditional English roast goose. \"Billy can pudding\" offers a simplified version of plum pud- ding made in a kind of tin tub used to carry water. Other colonial recipes include \"Christmas damper,\" a quick Christmas bread, and 41 Encyclopedia of Christmas and New Year's Celebrations, 2nd Edition \"drover's plum pudding,\" a kind of rice pudding made with raisins and nuts. \"Father Christmas salad,\" a red, white, and green mixture of cherries, pistachio nuts, and lychees, represents another original Australian Christmas recipe. Many Australians eat their Christmas dinner out of doors, in order to enjoy the summer sunshine. Some barbecue or take picnics to the beach or other outdoor beauty spots. Others eat a cold meal at home, often combining salads with cold meat dishes. Still others, in spite of the heat, prefer an English Christmas dinner, complete with roasted meat, potatoes and gravy. Many families, no matter what they have for dinner, choose to end the meal with a hot Christmas pudding {see also Plum Pudding). Boxing Day December 26, Boxing Day, is a holiday in Australia. People enjoy sporting matches on this day (for more on the day's traditional sports, see St. Stephen's Day). It serves as the occasion for a number of im- portant events, including the Sydney-to-Hobart Yacht Race and open- ing day test match held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Other December Holidays Australia is a diverse society that hosts many different ethnic and religious groups. Its Jewish citizens often begin their Hanukkah cel- ebrations in December, and in some years the Muslim holiday of Ramadan falls in December. Many former citizens of Hong Kong have immigrated to Australia. They and their descendants often cel- ebrate a Taoist festival called Ta Chiu on December 27, in which they thank their ancestors and the deities for their protection and ask these spirits to bless and renew their lives. Australia's original inhab- itants, the Aborigines, do not observe a festival of their own at this time of year. In the north of the country, however, many indigenous Australians mark the end of their six-season year in late December. Christmas in July Some Australians tire of reinventing Christmas as a hot weather holiday. In recent years many have attended Christmas in July cele- 42 Australia, Christmas in brations, where a traditional English Christmas celebration takes place in July. These celebrations fulfill the desires of those who long to celebrate Christmas by snuggling next to an open fire and partak- ing of a hearty English Christmas dinner on a wintry evening.
