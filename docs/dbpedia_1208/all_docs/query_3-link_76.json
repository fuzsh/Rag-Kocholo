Hereâs a peek at what people are saying.\n\nUniversal Recognition\n\nChicago has myriad private clubs, some exclusive and\n\nsome not so much. But if youâre into dining out, some say\n\nthe clubs do not deliver the same dining experience as a\n\ntraditional restaurant.\n\nRafat Alzein, executive chef at the University Club of Chicago\n\nat 76 E. Monroe St., is not one of those naysayers â at least\n\nnot anymore. He joined the staff about 20 years ago after a\n\nstint in the kitchen at the Four Seasons. Back then, he said,\n\nthe criticism may have been more fair.\n\nâThat used to be career suicide, to go work for a club,â Alzein\n\nsaid on this weekâs episode of the podcast. âIt wasnât a place\n\nto go for food. That was the stigma about club dining.\n\nBut Alzein said that has changed in recent years. Club\n\nmembers now not only want great service, they also expect\n\nexceptional food. âFrom what it was 20 years ago to what it\n\nis right now, itâs completely different,â he explained. âIâm very\n\nproud to say that our food here at the club is no different\n\nthan the Four Seasons, no different than any restaurant in\n\nthe city of Chicago.â\n\nCrainâs Chicago Business, January 2024\n\nListen to podcast\n\nP:12\n\n12 Universal Recognition 1 âYou can only be successful in the club industry if you\n\nhave supportive governance and a committed, smart\n\nteam on whom you can rely for open communication with\n\nmembership and staff. My team and I continually and\n\nforthrightly address assumptions and understandings and\n\nidentify opportunities to revisit and revise as necessary. We\n\nlook at things and ask why, speculate what situations could\n\nbe next, consider the implications for the club, and establish\n\nand execute appropriate actions. And, of course, effective\n\ncommunication with the club governance is critical.â\n\nJohn Spidalette, Club Management Magazine,\n\nMay/June 2023\n\nIn a speech at the University Club of Chicago on Monday,\n\nPence touched on the insurrection, but only to say: âI am not\n\ngoing to allow that tragic day to distract attention from [the\n\nDemocratsâ] failed agenda...â\n\nNewsday, June 24, 2022\n\nP:13\n\n13 1Universal Recognition\n\nSheâs 16 years old and sheâs a wild card player in the second\n\nlargest professional squash tournament in the world, going on\n\nright now here in Chicago.

Squash has finally earned the nod from the\n\nInternational Olympic Committee, and the sport will make\n\nitâs Olympic debut in the 2028 games in Los Angeles.\n\nABC 7, February 2024\n\nP:15\n\n15 1Universal Recognition\n\nHeld at the University Club of Chicago, the eight-day\n\ntournament is one of the Professional Squash Associationâs\n\n(PSA) largest events of the season â second only to the\n\nPSAâs World Squash Championships.\n\nMaking the event unlike any other is the tournamentâs âmain\n\nstage. âThe fact that we have this glass court in Cathedral Hall\n\nmakes it so special, and Chicago is great -- probably one of\n\nmy favorite cities in the U.S.,â said Lucas Serme, professional\n\nsquash player. In the University Clubâs Cathedral Hall, a glass\n\ncourt was constructed over two days in preparation for the\n\ntournament.

But we also must invest\n\nin improvements that allow us to provide modern amenities for\n\nmembers, and adapt to changing times.\n\nThe $15 million renovation and integration of 30 S. Michigan Ave.,\n\nthe building adjacent to the original Clubhouse, transformed the\n\nmember experience upon completion in 2017. This project marked\n\nthe debut of two contemporary spaces, The Parliament and The\n\nLiving Room, that quickly became member favorites.\n\nRESERVE STUDY\n\nMaintaining our gothic skyscraper takes careful fiscal planning. To\n\nensure we are prepared for years to come, the Club conducted a\n\nCapital Reserve Study in 2024 that outlines major capital projects\n\nand budget recommendations for the next 10 years.\n\nP:45\n\n45 6Adapting to Changing Times\n\n2024 - Elevator Modernization\n\nIn 2024, the Club embarked on an eagerly anticipated initiative:\n\nmodernization of the main elevators in our clubhouse. The elevators\n\nare dramatically enhanced with all new interiors, mechanicals and\n\nsmart technology that provide more efficient access to the building\n\nfor years to come. Vibrant digital screens provide timely information\n\nabout Club happenings during the ride.\n\nP:46\n\n46 6Adapting to Changing Times\n\n2022 - Member Workspace\n\nThe pandemic changed the way we live, work and play. Knowing\n\nmembers were now working remotely, or needing a place to\n\nconduct work downtown, we quickly worked to create a space that\n\nmet them where they needed us to be â the Member Workspace.\n\nThe complimentary workspace features 30 private desk offices,\n\n4 conference rooms, pink noise, an online reservation system, a\n\nconcierge and complimentary coffee and water.\n\nP:47\n\n47 6Adapting to Changing Times\n\n2022 - Game Room\n\nThereâs truth in the old adage, âWork hard. Play hard.â The Game\n\nRoom, located across the hallway from our Member Workspace,\n\noffers a chance to unwind and enjoy classic games with friends or\n\nfamily.\n\nThe Game Room features darts, billiards, pinball, shuffleboard and\n\nmuch more. Members can order drinks and food delivered from the\n\nLiving Room, and enjoy group activities, including poker nights and\n\nmahjong club outings.\n\nP:48\n\n48 6Adapting to Changing Times\n\n2017 - The Parliament\n\nOur contemporary rooftop restaurant offers year-round casual\n\ndining under a dramatic sculptural ceiling, or on the seasonal\n\nrooftop terrace with sweeping views of Millennium Park and the Art\n\nInstitute of Chicago.\n\nChef Rafat Alzein, formerly of The Four Seasons, brings a five-star\n\ntouch to every dish, whether itâs a burger and house-made fries or\n\nsea scallops with asparagus risotto, crab and squash blossom.\n\nThe space is an ideal setting for member events, from Tasty\n\nTuesday-themed dinners to premium wine tastings and dinners\n\nfeaturing sought-after bottles not sold anywhere beyond the\n\nwinery that produced them.\n\nP:49\n\n49 6Adapting to Changing Times\n\n2017 - Living Room\n\nContemporary yet casual, the Living Room represents a home away\n\nfrom home for members. And thatâs exactly how they use it.\n\nFrom coffee after a workout to a remote workspace or a gathering\n\nplace to watch the big game, the Living Room is where itâs at.\n\nP:50\n\n50 7\n\nOverall\n\nExperience\n\nP:51\n\n51 7Overall Experience\n\nThe true meaning of membership\n\nThe University Club of Chicago began simply as a place to foster an\n\nappreciation for the literature and the arts and to sustain the values\n\nof a common educational experience. While that still remains true,\n\nthe Club has grown to encompass much more. But the things that\n\ntruly make the Club special are often intangible. No one can explain\n\nthose qualities better than our members themselves.\n\nWhen I say this place has it all, it really does: educational\n\nevents, athletics, workspaces, special interest societies,\n\ndining facilities, itâs hard to capture it all in a short\n\nsentence and I may sound like I work here but I donât. Itâs\n\na place to have thoughtful discussions with members\n\nof all backgrounds and beliefs, drink good drinks, eat\n\ngood food, all while taking in the absolute best views in\n\nthe city. Itâs hard to imagine my life in Chicago without\n\nthinking of all the time Iâve spent at 76 E. Monroe and I\n\nwouldnât have it any other way.\n\nâ Michael OâBrien\n\nExclusive programs featuring celebrated artists,\n\nauthors, politicians, celebrities and more.\n\nP:52\n\n52 7Overall Experience Iâve been a member of the University Club of Chicago\n\nfor a little over a year, and I have to say itâs one of the\n\nbest decisions Iâve made in a long time. From the first\n\nmoment I walked in, I felt welcomed and engaged. The\n\none word I use to describe my experience when I speak\n\nwith prospective members is, âeasy.â Itâs easy to be here,\n\neasy to meet people, easy to find interesting things\n\nto do (from lectures, to events, to fitness classes, and\n\nmore), easy to enjoy yourself, and easy to drink it all in.\n\nThe membership and the staff, to a person, are people I\n\nam grateful to meet.\n\nâ Pamela N.\n\nEach time I attend a University Club event validates Iâm\n\nin the right place.\n\nâ Alicia Dale\n\nSommelier-led wine tastings\n\nP:53\n\n53 7Overall Experience\n\nIâve met some of my best friendsâ¦expanded my personal\n\nand professional network (intergenerationally!) beyond\n\nwhat I could have imaginedâ¦found a place in the City\n\nwhere I can come on any given day, be greeted by the\n\nfriendliest staff, and have my own sense of retreat for\n\nwhatever my day brings. The Club also has a vivacious\n\nmembership, with opportunities for members to get\n\ninvolved with its member-driven governance.\n\nâ Julia Foster\n\nExclusive wine dinners and opportunities to buy rare bottles.\n\nPop-up events. Shown here is our Pop-up Solar Eclipse Viewing Party.\n\nP:54\n\n54 Tasty Tuesdays: Chef Alzeinâs tour of flavors around the world.\n\nState-of-the-art\n\nathletic equipment and\n\ncertified trainers.\n\n7Overall Experience\n\nThe University Club of\n\nChicago has quickly become\n\nan integral part of my\n\nfamily. We come to the club,\n\ntogether and apart, to learn,\n\nlaugh, grow, and connect\n\nwith smart people from\n\nacross Chicago and the\n\ncountry. I use the business\n\ncenter and host lunches. My\n\nwife and I are challenged to\n\nthink differently from the\n\nspeakers and authors who\n\ncome to our club. We use the\n\nathletic facilities, personal\n\ntrainers, and classes to stay\n\nfit. Best of all, the University\n\nClub fosters a comfortable\n\nenvironment for happy hour\n\nand family meals alike.\n\nâ Marc Gould\n\nP:55\n\n55 7Overall Experience\n\nBest-in-class junior and adult squash programs.\n\nAnnual black-tie âFight Nightâ event\n\nJoining the University Club of Chicago has been an\n\nimmensely rewarding experience. The fantastic range\n\nof activities and access to exclusive speaker events\n\nare unparalleled. One of the best aspects of the club is\n\nthe deep sense of community shared among a group\n\nof diverse, interesting and like-minded individuals. The\n\nfriendships I have made are truly special.\n\nâ Lana Plecas"
