        "text": "Chinese actor\n\nZhao Benshan (simplified Chinese: 赵本山; traditional Chinese: 趙本山; pinyin: Zhào Běnshān; born 2 October 1957) is a Chinese skit and sitcom actor, comedian, television director, and businessman. Originally from Liaoning province, Zhao has appeared on the CCTV New Year's Gala, a widely watched performing arts program, every year from 1990 to 2011. Zhao's performances at the gala had made him a household name in China.[2]\n\nZhao is also known for his lead roles in the 2000 Zhang Yimou film Happy Times and the 2007 film Getting Home, as well as having directed and produced three television series based around rural life in his home province, Liu Laogen, Ma Dashuai, and Xiangcun Aiqing (\"Country Love\").[3]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nZhao was born in Lianhua Village, Kaiyuan, Liaoning province, to a peasant family.[4] He was orphaned at the age of 6.[5] Apprenticed to his uncle, he learned many local traditional performance arts, including erhu, a traditional Chinese musical instrument, and Errenzhuan, a traditional style of stand-up comedy that involves two people talking to each other on the stage which is popular in northeastern China.[6][7]\n\nJiang Kun, a nationally renowned xiangsheng artist, recommend Zhao to appear at the 1990 CCTV New Year's Gala, a TV program broadcast all over China to celebrate Chinese New Year. After his first appearance, he had appeared in each Gala show every year from 1995 to 2011.[8] Zhao's skits focus on social issues, including wealth disparity, the urban-rural divide, family and relationships, trust in society, and social changes in the era of economic reform. His works often drew inspiration from his own life in rural northeastern China.[9]\n\nZhao's most memorable performances have included \"Yesterday, today and tomorrow\" and \"Fixing up the house\" with Song Dandan, \"Bainian\" with Fan Wei and Gao Xiumin, a reprisal of \"Yesterday, today, and tomorrow\" with Song Dandan and Cui Yongyuan in 2006, and \"Don't need money\" in 2009 with Bi Fujian and Xiaoshenyang. Zhao became a household name in China since he began appearing at the Gala. His performances have generally received critical acclaim, earning the 'top-grade' prize (一等奖) for the \"skits\" category for thirteen years in a row between 1999 and 2011. Zhao's skit was almost always one of the most anticipated and talked-about events of the Gala.[10]\n\nZhao has appeared as an actor in many films, including Zhang Yimou's Happy Times (2000) where he played an aging bachelor who really wanted to get married.\n\nZhao was also active in producing and directing several successful television series. He acted as the title character in the series Liu Laogen and Ma Dashuai, as well as a secondary character in Xiangcun Aiqing (\"Country Love\") and their sequels.\n\nZhao was nominated for the Best Actor Award for his performance in Getting Home at the 2007 Golden Horse Awards, held in Taipei on 8 December 2007. He lost to Tony Leung for his work in Lust, Caution.[11][12]\n\nZhao took part in the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay by being a torchbearer in the Liaoning leg of the relay in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province.[13]In 2008, the theme of this year's Spring Festival Gala was \"Hand in Hand for the Olympics\", and Zhao Benshan's skit \"Torchbearer\" expressed every Chinese person's expectation for the Olympics in CCTV CMG New Year's Gala.[14]\n\nIn 2009, Zhao was studying in the 4th intake CEO class at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business.[15][16] In September 2009, Zhao was in the news again following a cerebral aneurysm rupture.[17] He was said to be in a stable condition after an operation, although close associates have mentioned that he often felt unwell in recent years when he is exhausted on the set.[18]\n\nZhao's apprentice, Xiaoshenyang, performed in the 2009 and 2010 CCTV New Year's Galas. Zhao has not performed at the CCTV New Year's Gala since 2012, which has led to public speculation about his health and his conflict with 2012 gala director Ha Wen. 2012 was the first time since 1994 that he did not perform at the annual event.[19]\n\nIn the afternoon of January 25, 2016, the 8th general meeting of the Liaoning Provincial Association of Songwriters was held in Liaoning Hall in Shenyang; Zhao Benshan was elected to become the Vice-chairman.[20]\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\n[edit]\n\nZhao is an entrepreneur and has led many business ventures. Zhao Benshan performs at the residency show at the \"Liulaogen Guild Hall\" (刘老根大舞台).[21] The Hall is located in the Qianmen area of Beijing, just south of Tiananmen Square and is immersed in part in building compounds with a history of some 280 years.[22] Zhao's show also tours in Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin and Jilin. Reportedly, these shows grossed over 100 million yuan (about US$14.64 million) in 2008.[23]\n\nIn 2004, Zhao Benshan co-founded the Benshan Art Academy at Liaoning University, to nurture new Errenzhuan players.[24] In 2005, he established Benshan Media Group, the parent company of Liaoning Folk Art Troupe, Benshan Production, Ruidong Culture Development Co. Ltd and Benshan Arts Academy.\n\nIn 2007, Zhao led his performing troupe to tour North America. They performed Errenzhuan in six cities including New York, Los Angeles and Vancouver.[25]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nZhao married Ge Shuzhen (葛淑珍) in 1979. Ge, a farmer from a village near Kaiyuan, was 19 at the time of their wedding. The two had a daughter, Yufang, and son, Tiedan, who had osteomalacia and emphysema as well as heart problems. Zhao and Ge divorced in 1992;[26] Ge took custody of the children. Ge Shuzhen worked a series of menial labour jobs after their divorce before becoming an entrepreneur. His son Tiedan died in 1994 at the age of 12. His daughter Yufang and her husband are reportedly local restaurateurs.[27]\n\nIn 1992, Zhao married his second wife, Ma Lijuan (马丽娟), a Hui Chinese woman from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia. In 1997 the couple had fraternal twins named Zhao Yinan and Zhao Jiaxuan.[28]\n\nOn September 30, 2009, it was reported Zhao had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and was sent to hospital in Shanghai.[29][30] In December 2009, Zhao purchased a Bombardier Challenger 850 at a cost of 200 million yuan (US$30 million). He later stated that he was thinking of replacing the Challenger 850 with a newer Boeing or Gulfstream jet.[31][32]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nDon't Kidding Me (1987)\n\nXian Shi Huo Bao (1990)\n\nWhoever Comes Is a Guest (1990)\n\nKeep Cool (1997) - Poet reader\n\nThe Emperor and the Assassin (1999) - Gao Jianli\n\nHappy Times (2000) - Zhao\n\nGetting Home (2007)\n\nA Simple Noodle Story (2009)\n\nJust Call Me Nobody (2010)\n\nThe Founding of a Party (2011) - Duan Qirui\n\nThe Lion Roars 2 (2012)\n\nAccidental Hero (2012)\n\nThe Grandmaster (film) (2013)\n\nThe New Year's Eve of Old Lee (2016)\n\n[33] [34]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu Laogen - (2002), title character\n\nMa Dashuai - (2004), title character\n\nXiangcun Aiqing (2006−2019), recurring character[35]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
