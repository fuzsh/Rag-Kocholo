        "text": "The big Spring Festival eve extravaganza prepared by the China Central Television will be more than just a Chinese affair. At the second rehearsal on the evening of Jan.11, the audience were eager to see what new delights they would get to enjoy on the long awaited Chinese Lunar New Years eve. And among other imports they were treated to the fantastic display that taps into the soul of Ireland, the \"Spirit of the Dance\".\n\nEnergetic dance acts are the staples of the spectacular. Body language is a universal mode of expression, and the creators of this year's gala have focused lots of energy on making the dance sequences as vigorous, passionate, up to the minute and as international as possible. They want to produce a whole new experience on the stage of CCTV Spring Festival gala. And for those who still reeling from the joys of \"River Dance\" which came to China late last year, they've included some of the best tap numbers from the other equally famous Irish dance show, the \"Spirit of the Dance\".\n\nIn addition to tap acts, the Chinese TV audience will also be treated to some other Western dance routines. Jazz and salsa dances will also add their exotic beat to the traditional Chinese festival.\n\nSpring Festival is the most important and cherished festival for Chinese people. So they bring fond memories of their experiences from the previous year when they think about what they want for this one. So the classic pieces, the old favorites that draw the big emotional responses, are still on the menu to satisfy the nostalgia in all of us."
