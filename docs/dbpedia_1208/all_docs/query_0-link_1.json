        "text": "Renowned Chinese director Feng Xiaogang [File photo]\n\nRenowned Chinese director Feng Xiaogang, best known for his comedies, has been selected to co-direct the China Central Television (CCTV) Spring Festival Gala which will celebrate the upcoming year of the horse.\n\nFeng is reportedly selected to act as general director of the annual gala, China's biggest and most profitable TV event. He will be assisted by another director, who has participated in previous New Year Gala. The candidates include Lang Kun, Sun Bin and Lyv Yitao, according to Tencent.com.\n\nThe CCTV New Year Gala has previously employed more than one director for the same show, but this will be the first time since 1983, the year of the gala's premiere, that an outsider not employed formally by CCTV will join as director. A press conference to announce the Gala's directors will reportedly be held around July 12."
