        "text": "Even the most casual Vogue reader should recognize Blake Lively as a regular presence in our pages, dating all the way back to February 2009, when she first graced the cover during the early days of a little show called Gossip Girl. “I love how classic and old time-y the look was,” she said in her Life In Looks video. “It was smart, Anna putting a 21-year-old girl on a CW teen soap on the cover of Vogue, to make this shoot more timeless.”\n\nNow, over 14 years and three Vogue covers later, Lively’s life looks tremendously different than it did at 21. By December 2010, Lively traded in the post-recession Upper East Side for her beachy SoCal roots. That second cover—written by Hamish Bowles in anticipation of her role in The Green Lantern—sat on the precipice of one of her biggest moments yet: meeting her costar-turned-husband, Ryan Reynolds.\n\nBy the time she landed her third cover in 2014—a Western tableau shot in Jackson Hole, Wyoming—Lively was expanding beyond acting into the entrepreneurial space with a Goop-esque lifestyle website called Preserve, which she helmed for a year. These days, she splits her efforts between her new haircare line, Blake Brown, her nonalcoholic mixers, Betty Buzz, and canned cocktails, Betty Booze.\n\nOf course, no Blake Lively retrospective would be complete without a mention of her Met Gala style. In 2016, the actor debuted her second pregnancy—her daughter, Inez—on the Met steps wearing a pale pink strapless Burberry dress embellished with red flowers. The resulting photo landed in the pages of Vogue’s June 2016 issue.\n\nToday, more than ten years since her last Vogue cover, Lively has returned in a To Catch a Thief-inspired romp through Monte Carlo. Directed by Baz Luhrmann, this glamorous shoot sees her taking on the role of a cat burglar, with Hugh Jackman as the detective hot on her tail.\n\nWith four covers under her belt—from the frothy La Jolla coast to the moneyed Monte Carlo; from Gossip Girl to A Simple Favor 2—Blake Lively proves she’s got the range."
