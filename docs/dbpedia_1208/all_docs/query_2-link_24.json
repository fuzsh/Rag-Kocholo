        "text": "An iconic Chinese rocker whose music is closely associated with the 1989 pro-democracy movement is unlikely to appear on this year’s Spring Festival gala on Chinese state television because of censorship concerns, his agent said.\n\nThe invitation extended to Cui Jian to perform on the China Central Television variety show, a staple of the Chinese holiday and one of the most watched programs in the world, had been seen as a breakthrough for the man known as the “Godfather of Rock” in China. Despite his fame, Mr. Cui has long been kept off state radio and television, mainly because of the political connotations of his work.\n\n“In the end Mr. Cui Jian can’t participate in this performance,” his agent, You You, told The New York Times in an e-mail. Asked why, she replied, “Because we cannot change the song lyrics.”\n\nMs. You declined to elaborate on the censorship process but held out the possibility that Mr. Cui could perform if no cuts to his songs were required. “We are still waiting for the results of the censorship,” she said.\n\nMr. Cui is currently directing a film and declined an interview request.\n\nNews of the invitation to Mr. Cui earlier this month prompted questions about whether he might play “Nothing to My Name,” the 1986 ballad that became an anthem of student protesters in Tiananmen Square.\n\nThe CCTV New Year’s Gala is an hours-long annual special watched by hundreds of millions of Chinese on the eve of the country’s most important holiday. It is light entertainment, with comedy, music and dance performances. The content is tightly scripted, sometimes with overt political messages. In 2010, a singer from the Uighur ethnic minority performed a song titled, “The Party’s Policies are Good,” and was ridiculed online for the crude propaganda.\n\nIn recent years, public enthusiasm for the the show has declined, particularly among younger viewers who favor the Internet rather than state television for entertainment. A few regional broadcasters have also created rival shows, and some ordinary Chinese have even staged alternative holiday performances online.\n\nThe invitation to Mr. Cui was seen as a possible attempt to add some punch to the CCTV special and attract viewers whose interest may have waned.\n\nMr. Cui, who faced close official scrutiny and unwritten restrictions on large-scale performances in the 1990s, did not appear on a big stage before a mass audience in mainland China for 15 years. But over the last decade, cultural and security authorities have eased up on rock as popular tastes have diversified and the market for music festivals has grown. Mr. Cui, too, has become far less taboo for the censors, who have allowed him to perform in stadium concerts and state media to interview him.\n\nCCTV has flirted with adding Mr. Cui to its holiday lineup before. In 2012, he recorded for a performance for an online version of the gala, but it was never shown.\n\nThe 1989 student movement and the bloody crackdown that ended it are among the most sensitive subjects for China’s ruling Communist Party. The themes of loneliness and alienation conveyed by Mr. Cui’s songs, including the 1987 hit “A Piece of Red Cloth,” which he performed in Tiananmen during the demonstrations, resonated with the protesters, though he has said in interviews that they were originally meant as love songs.\n\nLittle is known about the vetting and censorship of acts in the Spring Festival gala. But in 2012, Zhao Benshan, an actor who had appeared in 21 previous consecutive New Year’s shows, declined to perform and later described the censors as “unhappy” and “nervous.” In 2010, the Taiwanese magician Liu Qian complained the censorship process was “truly frightening.”"
