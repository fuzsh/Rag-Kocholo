        "text": "The biggest night in fashion has come and gone -- and the stars aligned in Manhattan.\n\nHailed as \"the party of the year,\" the Met Gala unites A-listers across industries, from, of course, fashion, to sports, film, tech, politics and more, under one roof for a black-tie spectacle unlike any other. Attendees have to be invited, and tickets are $75,000 a person. It's a cash cow for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, raising $22 million last year.\n\nThis year's theme was \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and the dress code...well, there were a lot of florals. Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth were your chairs.\n\nWe've got you covered with all the excitement from Monday night. Follow along below:\n\nSwift skips\n\nYou'll have to wait longer than a fortnight for Taylor Swift's Met Gala return.\n\nThe \"Cruel Summer\" singer skipped this year's event in New York City to prepare for the European leg of her sold-out Eras Tour, E! News confirms.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nRihanna no-show?\n\nDays after Rihanna confirmed her RSVP for the 2024 Met Gala, the Grammy winner had to cancel her appearance at the star-studded event.\n\nSo why was the Fenty Beauty founder unable to take a bow on the arrivals carpet that she has reigned over for years? Her rep confirmed to E! News that she came down with the flu.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nAll the stars have arrived. Now what?\n\nBy Jennifer Vazquez and The Associated Press\n\nThanks to the notorious no-phone rule, which means none of the celebs have access to social media, the public doesn't really get to know what happens once everyone has arrived.\n\nIt’s a party, for sure, with cocktails and dinner for about invited 400 guests, but it’s also a huge fundraiser for the Met’s Costume Institute, the only department at the museum required to pay for itself. Last year, the gala raised about $22 million.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nZendaya...take 2\n\nAfter rocking a green and blue floral look when she first arrived, Zendaya returned hours later...with a dark side.\n\nThe star came back wearing a full black dress with an accompanying corset, and one of the longer trains seen at the gala this year.\n\nCompleting her stunning transformation was a bouquet of bright and colorful roses adorned on her head, held together with a black head piece.\n\nProtesters try to disrupt Met Gala arrivals\n\nVideo showed a couple of pro-Palestinian protesters try to interrupt the celebrities' arrivals at the Met Gala, but through much of the evening, there was little in terms of interference.\n\nTwo protesters were seen jumping out in front of cameras across the street from the Met Museum, each one holding signs. One of them called for an end of U.S. aid to Israel. The two individuals, a man and a woman, were quickly escorted away by police.\n\nA larger group of protesters who started at Columbia University and went to Hunter College then made it up to East 83rd Street and Madison Avenue, about a block away from the Met Gala events. Multiple arrests were reported from that protest, but it was not clear how many. That group did not have any impact on the ala's proceedings.\n\nDoja Cat heads out in a towel\n\nWas Doja Cat running late?\n\nFollowing up her feline-driven outfit from Met Gala 2023, the singer-songwriter was seen leaving The Mark Hotel in Manhattan sporting a towel around her body and another wrapped around her head. She even sported makeup running down her face.\n\nBut to those thinking she was rushed out the door, don't worry — she still had time to get on a pair of see-through stilettos.\n\nAnd if you thought that look left little to the imagination, her barely there outfit on the arrivals carpet was even more revealing.\n\nInternet's choice for winner of the night?\n\nWith all the big names coming to this year's Met Gala, there may be an early surprise for fan favorite of the night.\n\nDemi Moore wore a very floral-inspired dress with \"pink peonies procured from dead stock wallpaper,\" according to Vogue. The look took the internet by storm after she arrived.\n\nLana goes \"Into the Woods\"\n\nFollowing the nature theme closely, Lana del Rey was dressed in a beige veil held up by branches that came together to form a woodsy crown. The branches extended down the length of her dress, giving her a forest queen look.\n\nThe singer was also holding a red rose, even more in line with the garden theme.\n\n\"Dune\" star gives stunning dress reveal\n\nRebecca Ferguson had a Met Gala outfit for the birds.\n\nThe \"Dune\" star had a great reveal for her black and silver dress she wore. She arrived cloaked in a black overcoat, but quickly shed it to reveal the monochromatic ensemble.\n\nOn the inside of the coat were dark birds on a light blue background.\n\nFlorals dominate\n\nFlorals in Spring? Groundbreaking.\n\nWith a theme like \"The Garden of Time,\" a lot of flower-y looks had to be expected. And stars did not disappoint.\n\nSome went for a very, very literal interpretation — like Jessica Serfaty Michel. The actress went heavy on the flowers paired with a bright pink dress.\n\nIn her first Met Gala, Ayo Edibiri also sprung for a floral look.\n\nJessica Biel returned for her first Met Gala in more than a decade, with a flowing pink dress covered in petals.\n\nFor a full breakdown of all the looks at the 2024 Met Gala, click here.\n\nThe sands of Tyla\n\nIn a look that quickly become one of the most talked about of the evening early on, South African singer and songwriter Tyla incorporated actual nature in her Met Gala look, donning a dress that she confirmed was made of actual sand.\n\nShe paired the look with a handbag that looks like an hourglass.\n\nReviewing the looks for the Met Gala chairs\n\nThe \"New York Live\" team offers their takes on the Met Gala arrivals of the co-chairs Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nLea Michele shows off baby bump\n\nWe have our first baby bump spotting of the night.\n\nActress Lea Michelle, who announced she was pregnant in late March, donned a baby blue dress with floral notes along a shoulder strap. Could the blue color be a nod to her possibly having a baby boy?\n\nZendaya rocks floral look\n\nWhen it comes to staying on theme, Zendaya certainly nailed it.\n\nThe final co-chair of the 2024 Met Gala to arrive, Zendaya was seen in a flowing blue and green dress with plenty of leafy features that made her one with nature.\n\n\"As one of this evening’s official Met Gala co-hosts, #Zendaya was bound to deliver a memorable fashion moment on the red carpet,\" Vogue shared on X.\n\nThis year marks Zendaya's first Met Gala appearance since 2019, when she donned a fairytale princess-inspired look for that year's theme, Camp: Notes on Fashion.\n\nCouples at the Met Gala\n\nBy NBC Staff\n\nOver the years, the Met Gala has been a place where many major Hollywood couples have made their debut or made a big splash. From Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra, to Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, take a look at some of the biggest names to step out together — and how they looked while doing so.\n\nSee the looks Chris Hemsworth and Bad Bunny are sporting as first two co-chairs arrive\n\nThe first of the 2024 Met Gala co-chairs have arrived.\n\nChris Hemsworth sported a champagne-colored suit, very similar in shade to the color of the carpet the celebs will be walking throughout the evening. Under the three-piece suit was a silk shirt of the same color.\n\nBad Bunny opted for darker tones, dressed almost entirely in navy blue with red strip accents on his pants. He also had dark sun glasses and a dark, velvety oversized beret. To keep with the \"The Garden of Time\" theme, he came with a bouquet of dark flowers as well.\n\nAnna Wintour arrives\n\nAnna Wintour, the Global Editorial Director of Vogue, was among the early arrivals, as per usual. She sported a white dress under a full-length black overcoat adorned with florals along the length of the piece.\n\n\"The look #Loewe’s Jonathan Anderson created for Anna Wintour was inspired by the Tulip-strewn cape in “Sleeping Beauties,” which was designed by Charles Frederick Worth, who is considered to be the first couturier,\" Vogue said on X.\n\nArrivals carpet revealed\n\nHere is a first look at the transformed stairs at The Met ahead of the stars' arrivals. It follows closely along with the theme \"The Garden of Time\" — find out more about the theme here.\n\nTake a look inside a 5-star suite given to an A-lister\n\nBy NBC Staff\n\nAccess Hollywood was given an exclusive look at a five-bedroom suite at The Mark Hotel in New York's Upper East Side that will be given to one of the A-list celebs who will strut down the Met Gala's red carpet on Monday night.\n\nIn a video tour led by digital creator Eric Sedeño, also known as @Ricotaquito on TikTok, the 5,000-square-foot suite is shown to come with a large living room, dining room, office, as well as five bedrooms, including a primary suite with an outside terrace.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nMost controversial looks on the Met Gala carpet\n\nBy Linda Gaudino\n\nFashion's biggest night is full of stunning fits, but some designs have stirred controversy.

Will she or won't she is the big question so many observers are watching.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nWhat happens inside the Met Gala? It's a secret\n\nBy Jennifer Vazquez\n\nThe Met Gala captivates the eyes of the fashion world every single year -- but part of the awe of the night's festivities are not the big names walking the red carpet in outstanding outfits, but rather that that is all we see.\n\nThat's right -- the night is very hush-hush. Not much else aside from the fashionable entrances is made public, and apparently it is designed that way.\n\nOne of the main rules, that helps to keep the allure and mystery of the Met Gala alive is the fact that what happens inside is so secretive thanks to the no-phone rule -- and by extension no social media -- that all invitees must abide by, according to Vogue.com.\n\nHowever, like all rules, there are exceptions. Apparently, celebrities have gotten around the no-photos rule by ... sneaking them in while socializing in the bathrooms!\n\nRead the full story here\n\nZendaya, Bad Bunny, JLo and Chris Hemsworth chair this year's Met Gala. Here are their past looks\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nJennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth and Zendaya will join Vogue’s Anna Wintour as co-chairs of this year’s Met Gala, the magazine and the Metropolitan Museum of Art revealed in February.\n\nLopez has been on the guest list 13 times and Zendaya five. This is Bad Bunny’s third year at the gala and the first for Hemsworth. Check out their past outfits.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nThe 2024 Met Gala ‘Garden of Time' theme and dress code, explained\n\nBy Sandra Escallón\n\nPrepare for the 2024 Met Gala red carpet to look like a beautiful bouquet.\n\nOn May 6, the biggest and brightest stars will step out in their most fantastical designs at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This year, the annual event — hosted by Anna Wintour and cochairs Bad Bunny, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth — will celebrate the Costume Institute's new exhibition: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" in which the theme is \"The Garden of Time.\"\n\nThat means fans can expect to see an explosion of florals and nature-inspired designs on the red carpet.\n\nRead the full story here\n\n10 most fabulous entrances in Met Gala history\n\nBy Jennifer Vazquez\n\nThe Met Gala is known as \"fashion's biggest night\" -- and rightfully so!\n\nWhile many of us watch from the comfort of our own couches the countless celebrities walking the carpet for mere minutes of fashion splendor... those few minutes walking up the Metropolitan Museum of Art's steps is all that it takes for the stylish entrances and looks of the night to reach millions across the globe and become entrenched in fashion lore.\n\nThis year's theme is “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.” The reference is not to the fairy tale, though, but to treasured garments from the vast collection at the Costume Institute — some too fragile to hang upright. Museum curators will place them in glass cases, like Sleeping Beauty herself.\n\nAnd with Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth as co-chairs of this year's star-studded event, draw-dropping fashion moments will surely take place.\n\nIn honor of the big event, we look back at the top 10 most iconic entrances and looks of Met Galas past.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nThe history of the Met Gala, considered 'party of the year'\n\nBy Yessi Hernández, Sandra Escallón\n\nIt's an iconic night, where the Metropolitan Museum of Art becomes the spot to welcome worldwide stars and celebrities to the \"party of the year.\" The Met Gala has done that for more than 70 years.\n\nBut how did this tradition start and become the event for fashion and art lovers?\n\nThe Costume Institute Benefit, also known as The Met Gala, began in 1948 as a midnight supper that invited guests could attend for $50 a ticket, said the museum. Created by publicity doyenne Eleanor Lambert, who called the event the \"Party of the Year,\" it raised funds to support The Costume Institute and celebrated the opening of its major annual exhibition.\n\nRead the full story here"
