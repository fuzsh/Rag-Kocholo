JD.com gave away red packets and gifts worth 1.5 billion yuan (US$211.4 million) and handled 69 billion interactions during the 2022 show, the company said.\n\nXiaohongshu, the Chinese Instagram-like social e-commerce platform, announced last week that it would be a partner of the Spring Festival Gala this year, broadcasting a live-stream of the show and behind the scenes activity. Users can also shop on Xiaohongshu to purchase items they see during the show, according to the company.\n\nThe Spring Festival Gala, which is the world’s most watched TV show, has been a sought-after platform for Chinese internet companies to reach users and flex their financial muscle.\n\nIn 2015, Tencent Holdings became the first Big Tech enterprise to sign a partnership with CCTV, a year after its social media app WeChat introduced virtual red packets to promote the use of WeChat Pay.\n\nThe show has since become a battleground for the country’s tech firms, with Alibaba Group Holding, Baidu, ByteDance and Kuaishou participating in previous years, cumulatively spending billions of yuan in virtual red packets. Alibaba owns the Post.\n\nThis year’s Spring Festival Gala partnership comes as JD.com is engaged in fierce competition with its e-commerce rivals. Platforms including JD.com, Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall, Pinduoduo as well as short video players Douyin and Kuaishou have launched promotional campaigns of their own, touting various discounts for the holidays.\n\nThe country’s top e-commerce players have been feeling the heat from rapidly growing challengers such as Pinduoduo, whose operator PDD Holdings nearly doubled its revenue in the third quarter on the back of a low-price strategy. By comparison, JD.com and Alibaba posted revenue growth of 1.7 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.\n\nLast month, JD.com founder and chairman Richard Liu Qiangdong urged employees to take more proactive action to fend off competition and fix management problems, or else there would be “no way out” for the company."
