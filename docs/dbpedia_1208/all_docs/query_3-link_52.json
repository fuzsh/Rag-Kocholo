Thoughts are not esoteric vapors of nothing; they are physical, tangible phenomena in the body that can affect an individual’s emotions, actions and behaviors. Creating real change happens when people work to shift their frequency on a cellular level. Workshop participants will learn to connect to their personal power through emotions and create changes in their health and day-to-day living.\n\nA practicing transformation coach for more than 20 years, workshop facilitator Alexis Brown initially pursued a career in medical science as a histologist. Often called microscopic anatomy and histochemistry, histology allows for the visualization of tissue structure and characteristic changes the tissue may have undergone. Fascinated with scientific research on the mind-body connection, Brown developed a lifelong passion for examining how the subconscious profoundly affects overall quality of life.\n\nTo sign up and learn more, go to healtree.co or call 302-827-4683.\n\nOverfalls happy hour set Aug. 14 in Lewes\n\nThe Overfalls Foundation’s monthly happy hour will be held from 5 to 7 p.m., Thursday, Aug. 15, at Lewes Canalfront Park.\n\nAttendees can savor a beer or a glass of wine, enjoy the opportunity to see the ship, and meet some adoptable four-legged guests from Humane Animal Partners.\n\nBoth the ship and the store will be open to the public during happy hour.
