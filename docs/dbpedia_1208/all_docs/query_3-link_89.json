        "text": "Font size:A+A-\n\nThe 2021 Spring Festival Gala kicked off in Beijing at 8 p.m. local time Thursday, on Chinese New Year's Eve, to bring a technology-featured and star-studded festive show.\n\nThe China Media Group production is the most-watched show in the world and for the first time, the stage choreography of this year's Spring Festival Gala is being presented in 8K Ultra HD video, while also using AI+VR naked-eye 3D technology. Through special shooting methods and production means, it brought a breakthrough-experience for those watching it on TV or on their mobile devices.\n\n2021 Spring Festival Gala\n\nLike many other events during a pandemic, this year's show also featured virtual performances, combining art and high tech. Chinese pop star Andy Lau performed virtually, joining Guan Xiaotong and Wang Yibo in a creative show titled \"Ox Strut\" to wish audiences a happy and healthy Chinese New Year.\n\nLed by renowned wushu artists Donnie Yen and Wu Jing, \"Wushu Performance: Heroes of Heaven And Earth\" wowed the audience by placing a natural landscape as the background of the performance through augmented reality (AR) technology.\n\nWushu is a revered part of Chinese culture with many styles of wushu listed as national intangible cultural heritage. Last year, Taijiquan, a form of wushu, was listed as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.\n\n2020 was a tough year for everyone, especially for many frontline medical workers. To ring in the new year and embrace a better tomorrow, stars Jackie Chan, CoCo Lee, Zhou Dongyu, Li Yifeng and many others sang \"A Better Tomorrow\" to pay tribute to all frontline workers.\n\nDepicting the streets, communities, villages and ports of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the song \"China in the Light\" was sung by veteran Zhang Ye and gala newcomer Zhou Shen.\n\nThe new song was created at the time of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in south China's Guangdong Province, which reflects the rapid growth and bright future of the Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe fashion show \"Splendid Costume,\" with a performance by singer Li Yuchun (Chris Lee), featured models He Sui, Zhang Zilin and Xi Mengyao, who used a new format that combined new technologies and lured audiences with beautiful Chinese costumes."
