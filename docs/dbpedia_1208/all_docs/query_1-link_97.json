        "text": "It's the start of the world's biggest human migration - the travel rush that leads up to Chinese New Year. Organizers of the annual CCTV Gala have released a new song by Andy Lau, called 'The Road Home', as a warm up to the show. Lau will perform the song at this year's Gala - his first appearance in ten years.\n\nAndy Lau brings new song to CCTV Gala\n\nVeteran Hong Kong superstar, Andy Lau, is back on the CCTV Gala stage, with a self-penned song called \"The Road Home\".\n\nIt's an apt title, summing up his return to China's biggest TV event... and the millions of journeys expected over the coming weeks, as families re-unite across the nation.\n\nThe song has been chosen as a warm-up to the gala.\n\n\"'The Road Home' is a touching, warm song. A line in the lyrics goes like this: Going home, you find happiness. Happiness is hugging your mom and dad. Andy Lau wrote the lyric himself. He put a lot of his emotions, his understanding of families into the song,\" said Yang Lailai, the Executive Director of CCTV Spring Festival Gala.\n\nThe singer hopes \"The Road Home\" will be a good accompaniment for people beginning some extremely long journeys back to see their loved ones.\n\n\"I wish everyone a safe journey during Spring Festival. I hope everyone is happy and successful. See you at the Spring Festival Gala on lunar new year's eve,\" Lau said.\n\nLau has performed at the gala four times. Each time, his songs have gone on to become karaoke favorites.\n\nHe hopes \"The Road Home\" will match that success... and that the audience will be singing along with him, on new year's eve."
