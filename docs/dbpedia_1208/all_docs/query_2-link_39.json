        "text": "Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, is China’s most important festival. It is also the most important celebration for families and includes a week of official public holiday.\n\nThe history of the Chinese New Year festival can be traced back to about 3,500 years ago. Chinese New Year has evolved over a long period of time and its customs have undergone a long developmental process.\n\nWhen is Chinese New Year?\n\nThe date of the Chinese New Year is determined by the lunar calendar. The holiday falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice on December 21. Each year the New Year in China falls on a different date than on the Gregorian calendar. The dates usually range sometime between January 21 and February 20.\n\nWhy is it called the Spring Festival?\n\nEven though it is winter, the Chinese New Year is popularly known as the Spring Festival in China. Because it starts from the Beginning of Spring (the first of the twenty-four terms in coordination with the changes of Nature), it marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring.\n\nThe Spring Festival marks a new year on the lunar calendar and represents the desire for a new life.\n\nLegend of the Origin of Chinese New Year\n\nChinese New Year is steeped with stories and myths. One of the most popular legends is about the mythical beast Nian (Year). He ate livestock, crops, and even people on the eve of a new year.\n\nTo prevent Nian from attacking people and causing destruction, people put food at their doors for Nian.\n\nIt’s said that a wise old man figured out that Nian was scared of loud noises (firecrackers) and the color red. So, people put red lanterns and red scrolls on their windows and doors to stop Nian from coming inside. Crackling bamboo (later replaced by firecrackers) was lit to scare Nian away.\n\nChinese New Year’s Origin in the Shang Dynasty\n\nChinese New Year has a history of about 3,500 years. Its exact beginning date is not recorded. Some people believe that Chinese New Year originated in the Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BC), when people held sacrificial ceremonies in honor of gods and ancestors at the beginning or the end of each year.\n\nChinese Calendar “Year” Established in the Zhou Dynasty\n\nThe term Nian first appeared in the Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BC). It had become a custom to offer sacrifices to ancestors or gods, and to worship nature in order to bless harvests at the turn of the year.\n\nChinese New Year Date Was Fixed in the Han Dynasty\n\nThe date of the festival, the first day of the first month in the Chinese lunar calendar, was fixed in the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD). Certain celebration activities became popular, such as burning bamboo to make a loud cracking sound.\n\nIn the Wei and Jin Dynasties\n\nIn the Wei and Jin dynasties (220–420 AD), apart from worshiping gods and ancestors, people began to entertain themselves. The customs of a family getting together to clean their house, having a dinner, and staying up late on New Year’s Eve originated among common people.\n\nMore Chinese New Year Activities from the Tang to Qing Dynasties\n\nThe prosperity of economies and cultures during the Tang, Song, and Qing dynasties accelerated the development of the Spring Festival. The customs during the festival became similar to those of modern times.\n\nSetting off firecrackers, visiting relatives and friends, and eating dumplings became important parts of the celebration.\n\nMore entertaining activities arose, such as watching dragon and lion dances during the Temple Fair and enjoying lantern shows.\n\nThe function of the Spring Festival changed from a religious one to an entertaining and social ones, more like that of today.\n\nIn Modern Times\n\nIn 1912, the government decided to abolish Chinese New Year and the lunar calendar. It adopted the Gregorian calendar instead and made January 1 the official start of the New Year.\n\nAfter 1949, Chinese New Year was renamed the Spring Festival. It was listed as a nationwide public holiday.\n\nNowadays, many traditional activities are disappearing but new trends have been generated. CCTV (China Central Television) Spring Festival Gala, shopping online, WeChat red envelopes, and overseas travel make Chinese New Year more interesting and colorful."
