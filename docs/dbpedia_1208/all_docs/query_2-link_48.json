        "text": "#Chinese New Year# also known as the Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, is celebrated with several traditional customs and habits in Chinese culture. Here are some common practices and traditions associated with Chinese New Year: 1. Cleaning and decluttering: Before the arrival of the New Year, it is customary to thoroughly clean the house to sweep away any bad luck and make way for good fortune in the coming year. 2. Reunion dinner: Chinese families gather for a lavish feast on New Year's Eve, known as the reunion dinner. It is a time for family members to come together, share a meal, and exchange good wishes for the upcoming year. 3. Red decorations: Red is considered an auspicious color in Chinese culture. During Chinese New Year, homes and streets are adorned with red lanterns, couplets, and other decorations to bring good luck and drive away evil spirits. 4. Giving red envelopes: Red envelopes, known as \"hongbao\" in Mandarin or \"lai see\" in Cantonese, are monetary gifts placed in red envelopes. They are traditionally given by married couples or elders to younger family members and friends as a symbol of good luck and blessings. 5. Fireworks and firecrackers: Lighting fireworks and setting off firecrackers are traditional practices during Chinese New Year. The loud noises and bright lights are believed to scare away evil spirits and bring good fortune. 6. Lion and dragon dances: Colorful lion and dragon dances are performed during Chinese New Year parades and celebrations. These lively and vibrant dances are believed to bring good luck and prosperity to the community. 7. Visiting relatives and friends: During the New Year period, it is common for people to visit their relatives and friends to offer greetings and well wishes. This tradition strengthens family ties and social connections. 8. Giving gifts: Exchanging gifts is a common practice during Chinese New Year. Gifts are often exchanged between family members, friends, and colleagues as a gesture of goodwill and to express wishes for a prosperous year ahead. 9. Temple visits: Many people visit temples during Chinese New Year to pray for blessings, make offerings, and seek divine guidance for the coming year. These are just a few examples of the habits and traditions associated with Chinese New Year. The specific customs and practices may vary among different regions and communities within China and across the Chinese diaspora.\n\nKung Hei Fat Choy: Navigating Chinese New Year Firecrackers boom, families reunite, and factories fall silent... yes, Chinese New Year is upon us again! This year, CNY kicks off on February 10th, and while joyous for our friends in the East, it throws a wrench in our usual production schedules. Imagine factories emptying out on Feb 7th, not returning until Feb 25th - that's almost a month of closed doors and idle machines. Here's the reality: If you haven't planned for this already your favorite \"Made in China\" orders will experience some delays. But Onyx has prepared - stocking up on raw materials, expediting pre-holiday production, and even working with alternative suppliers in India (where there is not a holiday at this time of year). We have also identified many Made In The USA suppliers with unique and exciting products that can accommodate large and small requests during this time. This vibrant holiday is a vital part of Chinese culture, and the wait will definitely be worth it for the burst of energy and creativity that erupts when factories reopen. In the meantime, consider it an opportunity to explore other local alternatives, to try new products, or to engage your audiences differently. Wishing you a happy (albeit slightly delayed) New Year! :)\n\nThere's always something to learn from Curious Patterns! My top pick - because it is on the sector I now work in - is the Arup-BFI report on how film production must change to become sustainable (https://lnkd.in/eR8cUpgi). I loved its hands-on practical approach explaining what studios can do concretely. But also the stark reminder that the whole industry needs to change. Otherwise productions could be moved to countries with less stringent sustainability requirements. For reflection for policy-makers and for those funding culture and the audiovisual sector :) To go a step further, I feel the paper must be read together with the chapter on cinemas in the \"Decarbonons la culture\" by The Shift Project (https://lnkd.in/e6Aqz9PS) to get a sense of the CO2 impact of another part of the film value chain - distribution. And I'd be grateful to receive any readings/links on the environmental impact of movie and TV series' streaming - an area I still need to learn about.\n\nGerman Traditions: From Lost Things to Schultüte. It is no secret that knowledge of cultural traditions helps establish a deeper connection with a country and its history. In this context, let's take a look at some German traditions that belong to the great cultural heritage of the country. 🔹Lost items: When someone comes across a lost item, such as a hat, they hang it on the nearest tree to make it easier for the owner to find. 🔹Sunday silence: Germans make a clear distinction between their work and personal life. Almost all shops and cafes are closed on Sunday, giving German workers the opportunity to spend the day with their family and friends. 🔹Advent calendars: Have you ever used an advent calendar with a new window with candy opening every day? This tradition comes from Germany. 🔹Polterabend: There is a unique German wedding tradition known as Polterabend. The night before the wedding guests break porcelain under the newlyweds' feet to attract good luck. 🔹Schultüte: Children can feel anxious at the start of school year, so in Germany they often receive a Schultüte, a decorated paper cone full of gifts, on the first day of school to bring joy to the moment. Which interesting German traditions do you know? 🤔 Let us know in the comments.👇\n\nDuring the Spring Festival, in addition to eating, family reunions, and visiting relatives and friends, red envelopes are also distributed to convey New Year blessings. Most of them are given to people who are not yet married. But there is no forcing. Most importantly, the process of sending and receiving red envelopes is very enjoyable. Compared with other provinces, cities and regions, in Guangdong Province, China's largest economic region, the amount of red envelopes is not high, with 5 yuan, 10 yuan and 20 yuan being the mainstream amounts. In the eyes of Cantonese people, red envelopes are considered auspicious things. Therefore, sending red envelopes is not limited to close friends. As long as everyone gets together, they will send red envelopes to each other to express New Year blessings. Outside Guangdong, due to the large amount of red envelopes given out, relatives who are not very close need each red envelope (50-100 yuan), and others take the initiative to send equal amounts of red envelopes in return. Some young people said that it was very stressful to go home for the New Year and they wanted to come back to work as soon as possible.

In contrast, those who took a similar-length inland walk reported only 12 minutes of extra snooze time. 🔹 Neuroscientist Scott Huettel discovered that our brains calculate the value of experiences like beach vacations similarly to how they value material goods. 🔹 Natural water sounds activate the parasympathetic nervous system, helping us relax and unwind. Our planet comprises 70% water, and our bodies are 60% water. We spend the first nine months of our lives floating in water in the womb. It’s no wonder that water makes us happy. Any other thoughts on this topic? (including A1 highway traffic jams during long weekends! 😅)"
