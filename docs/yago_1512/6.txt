Her marriage to actor Sir Kenneth Branagh ended in 1995 and for the first time, 18 years later, Emma Thompson has revealed the reason behind their split – his affair with Helena Bonham Carter.

But the Sense and Sensibility actress says she is willing to forgive and forget.

Speaking to UK newspaper Sunday Times, Emma (54) says she does not resent Helena (47) for her affair with her then-husband on the set of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein in 1994.

“[It’s] all blood under the bridge. You can’t hold on to anything like that. I just think… pfft.”

She adds, “It’s pointless. I haven’t got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago.”

Helena, who is now in a long-term relationship with director Tim Burton (55), was in a relationship with Kenneth (52) until 1999, and Emma acknowledges that she and the Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street actress have their similarities.

“Oh we are [alike],” says Emma. “Being slightly mad and a bit fashion-challenged. Perhaps that’s why Ken loved us both. She’s a wonderful woman, Helena.”

These days, Emma is happily married to actor-producer Greg Wise. The couple has a daughter Gaia (13) and adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba (26).
