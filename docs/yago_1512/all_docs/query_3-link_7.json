        "text": "Emma Thompson has said she was “utterly, utterly blind” to the fact Kenneth Branagh was having an affair with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nThompson, 63, and Branagh, 61, met in 1987 when filming the series Fortunes of War. They were married two years later in 1989.\n\nThe couple divorced in 1995. It emerged that Branagh had been having an affair with Harry Potter star Helena Bonham Carter, 56, who he had starred opposite in his 1994 film Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.\n\nIn an interview with The New Yorker, Thompson reflected on the filming of Sense and Sensibility, for which she won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nWhile shooting the film in 1995, the actor’s marriage to Branagh had ended. They had not yet made news of their split public.\n\nThe New Yorker writer states that Thompson was “humiliated, in part by her own stupidity” by the affair Branagh had with Carter.\n\n“I was utterly, utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set,” she said.\n\n“What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.”\n\nThompson went on to recall her mental wellbeing at the time, comparing herself to shattered dishes.\n\nThe Love, Actually star said: “I was half alive. Any sense of being a lovable or worthy person had gone completely.”\n\nThompson said that it had been her Sense and Sensibility co-star Greg Wise who “picked up the pieces and put them back together”.\n\nThompson and Wise have been together for 27 years. They married in 2003 and have two children together, Gaia and Tindyebwa Wise.\n\nBranagh married art director Lindsay Brunnock in 2003.\n\nThompson said: “I’ve learned more from my second marriage just by being married. As my mother says, ‘The first twenty years are the hardest.’”"
