        "text": "Emma Thompson is sharing some rare comments about her ex-husband Kenneth Branagh.\n\nIn a new interview, the 63-year-old Love, Actually actress looked back at finding out the 61-year-old Murder on the Orient Express actor was having affairs with other actresses on set, including with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nClick inside to read more…\n\nIf you didn’t know, Emma and Kenneth married in 1989 after meeting on set of the 1987 series Fortunes of War.\n\nThey ended their marriage in 1995 after it was revealed that Kenneth had an affair with Helena, 56, who played his love interest in the 1994 movie Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, which he also directed.\n\n“I was utterly, utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set,” Emma recalled in an interview with The New Yorker. “What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.”\n\nAs for how the end of her marriage affected her mental health, Emma said, “I was half alive. Any sense of being a lovable or worthy person had gone completely.”\n\nHelena and Kenneth went on to date for five years and broke up in 1999.\n\nEmma went on to say that the person “who picked up the pieces and put them back together” was actor Greg Wise, who she starred alongside in the 1995 movie Sense and Sensibility.\n\nEmma and Greg married in 2003 and have been together for 27 years.\n\n“I’ve learned more from my second marriage just by being married,” Emma added. “As my mother says, ‘the first twenty years are the hardest.’”"
