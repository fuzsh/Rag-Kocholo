        "text": "KENNETH Branagh and Emma Thompson's marriage has hit the headlines once more after the actress opened up about being cheated on by her ex.\n\nThe film star, 58, revealed that she drew on real life experiences for her famous Love Actually role as a wife who discovered her husband had been unfaithful.\n\nDid Kenneth Branagh cheat on Emma Thompson?\n\nWhile rumours have swirled since the couple separated in the 1990s, Emma appeared to confirm her ex-husband Kenneth Branagh, now 57, had been unfaithful during their marriage with Helena Bonham Carter, now 51, in a 2013 interview.\n\nShe told the Sunday Times at the time that the split was \"all blood under the bridge\" and that \"you can’t hold on to anything like that. It’s pointless.\"\n\nThe star added: \"I haven’t got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago.”\n\nIn February 2018, Emma opened up about the affair again to an audience during a fundraising event for #MeToo by making a comparison to her character in the film Love Actually who is cheated on by her on-screen husband played by the late Alan Rickman.\n\nShe said: \"That scene where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it’s something everyone’s been through.\n\n\"I had my heart very badly broken by Ken. So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn’t meant for me.\n\n\"Well it wasn’t exactly that, but we’ve all been through it.\"\n\nWhen was their wedding?\n\nKenneth and Emma tied the knot in 1989 and were married for six years.\n\nThey were considered the golden couple of British cinema in the 1990s.\n\nThe pair met in 1987 while starring in the mini-series Fortunes Of war together, before marrying two years later in a lavish ceremony.\n\nHowever, in 1995 they divorced, and at the time said the reason for their split was because of conflicting work schedules.\n\nWhy did they really split?\n\nThe breakdown of Kenneth and Emma's marriage has since been blamed on an affair he had with Helena.\n\nThey are believed to have begun their relationship on the set of the film Frankenstein in 1994.\n\nAfter Kenneth's divorce from Emma, the couple had a public romance until 1999."
