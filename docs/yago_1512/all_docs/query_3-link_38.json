        "text": "Many thanks, Avi.\n\nThat reminds me of another of their series...\n\n\"Shakespeare Uncovered\", a documentary series created by the BBC that ran in the 2018 season.\n\nThe set consisted of several Shakespeare plays, my favorite is \"Richard III\" narrated by the actor Antony Sher, who had played the part onstage at The Globe Theatre in London in his younger days.\n\nThis show consists of film clips of various productions of the play as it has been done by different actors at different venues.\n\nAntony Sher takes us by the Tower of London at night to add an aura of spookiness to the story of Richard III and the murder of the two young princes.\n\nHe shows us film clips of himself performing the role, and comments as to how it felt to play the part, and what type of person he speculates that Richard III may have been.\n\nHe takes us into the wardrobe room at the theatre in Stratford-Upon-Avon to show us the costume he wore when he performed there.\n\nAll of the shows follow the same pattern of film clips of past performances and talking with the actors about their characters.\n\nOther plays in this series:\n\n\"Measure for Measure\"\n\n\"Much Ado About Nothing\", hosted by Helen Hunt.\n\n\"The Winters' Tale\"\n\n\"Julius Caesar\"\n\n\"Hamlet\"\n\n\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\"\n\nand a few others.\n\nThis series may be replayed some day on PBS in your area, but the best bet would be to stream it or buy the DVD set from PBS."
