        "text": "Dame Emma Thompson's daughter Gaia Wise hit out at her mother's ex-husband Kenneth Branagh decades after his affair with Helena Bonham-Carter.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who Emma shares with her husband and Sense and Sensibility co-star Greg Wise, took to her Instagram to share a Barbie-themed meme of young Emma and Kenneth from their 1993 movie Much Ado About Nothing. The quote read: \"She's everything, he's just Ken.\"\n\nIt refers to the Barbie tagline, which refers to incredible women coupled up with dull men. Emma, 65, was married to Kenneth, 63, between 1989 and 1995. The former couple met in 1987 while were filming Fortunes of War. He cheated on the Love Actually star with Harry Potter actress Helena, 58.\n\nKenneth met Helen while filming Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and began an affair with her. Emma previously opened up about the betrayal and said to The New Yorker in 2022: \"I was utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set. What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.\"\n\nWhen they first split, they claimed it was due to their busy work schedules and news of the affair didn't emerge until much later. He dated Helena until 1999. In 2018, she discussed the difficulty of filming one specific scene in Love Actually as it reminded her of Kenneth's betrayal.\n\n\"That scene in Love Actually where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it's something everyone's been through,\" she said. \"I had my heart very badly broken by Ken. So, I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn't meant for me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Emma met her future husband Greg while filming Sense and Sensibility. She said of their relationship: \"Work saved me and Greg saved me. He picked up the pieces and put them together again.\" The duo went on to welcome Gaia, who was conceived via in vitro fertilisation.\n\nEmma and Greg tied the knot in 2003 and informally adopted a Rwandan orphan named Tindyebwa Agaba. Emma and Greg's daughter Gaia followed in their footsteps and appeared in A Walk In The Woods, Silent Witness and The Chelsea Detective. She is also the voice of Hera in The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.\n\nEmma hasn't been particularly fond of Gaia following in her footsteps and becoming an actress. Speaking previously, Emma explained to the publication that she had encouraged her daughter to venture into a new career, joking that \"running a restaurant can be as exciting\"."
