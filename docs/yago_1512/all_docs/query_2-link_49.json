        "text": "It will soon be the season for holiday movie lovers to reignite the annual debate over whether “Love Actually,” the Christmas-themed romantic comedy with the ensemble cast of mostly British stars, is actually any good.\n\nEveryone on both sides of the debate agrees that Emma Thompson’s performance as Karen, the betrayed wife of Alan Rickman’s Harry, is a global treasure, one of the most devastating portrayals of hurt and grief in recent cinematic history.\n\nIt turns out that Thompson drew on a catastrophic experience in her own life to make Karen’s pain so recognizable to audiences, as she explains in a new interview with the New Yorker. She reveals for the first time that the experience relates to the collapse of her marriage to Kenneth Branagh.\n\nBack in 1995, when Thompson was filming “Sense and Sensibility,” with her Oscar-winning screenplay adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel, she learned that her Branagh was cheating on her with Helena Bonham Carter, the star of his film adaptation of “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.”\n\nThompson tried to put up a “steely” front on the “Sense and Sensibility” set as her six-year marriage collapsed, but privately, she felt humiliated, in part by her own stupidity, as she told the New Yorker.\n\n“I was utterly, utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set,” Thompson said about Branagh. “What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.”\n\nThompson compared her distress to shattered dishes, the New Yorker reported. “I was half alive. Any sense of being a lovable or worthy person had gone completely,” she said.\n\nThompson said she channeled that sense of betrayal into some of her most acclaimed performances, particularly her scene in “Love Actually” (2003) when Karen withdraws to her bedroom and sobs her heart out.\n\n“Her portrayal of grief in ‘Love Actually’ for instance, has become iconic in British popular culture,” the New Yorker said. Over the years, fans have shared that assessment.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/tonyshoey/status/1285710382426984449\n\nEarlier in “Love Actually,” Thompson’s Karen, a dutiful mother of two, finds a necklace in her husband’s pocket that she assumes is a Christmas present for her, but when she sits with her family around the Christmas tree to open his gift to her, she doesn’t find the necklace. Instead, it’s a box containing a Joni Mitchell CD. She immediately realizes he’s cheating on her and the necklace was meant for someone else.\n\nKaren tries to hide her anguish as Mitchell’s bittersweet song “Both Sides Now” wells up in the background. She retreats to her bedroom to cry, then tries to paste a smile on her face to face her family.\n\nIn several earlier interviews, Thompson reflected on why that scene resonates, although she never directly related her performance to what happened with Branagh.\n\n“That scene where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it’s something everyone’s been through,” Thompson told the Evening Standard in 2018, according to Marie Claire. “So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn’t meant for me. Well it wasn’t exactly that, but we’ve all been through it.’’\n\nIn 2013, she told the Sunday Times: “I’ve had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom, then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer.”\n\nBack in 1995, Thompson and Branagh’s breakup was a major pop culture news story on both sides of the Atlantic. They were British movie royalty, who had fallen in love and starred together in popular TV and film projects.\n\nWhen they met in 1989, Thompson was Britain’s new “golden girl,” while Branagh already was on the precipice of international stardom. He had drawn accolades as the next Laurence Olivier after making a splash on the London stage, playing Shakespeare’s Henry V, then scoring Academy Award nominations for both actor and director for his screen adaptation of “Henry V.”\n\nThompson remembered falling for Branagh’s dynamic presence.\n\n“He was incandescent with ambition and performance energy,” she told the New Yorker. While they were dating, Thompson also became aware of his infidelities. “The Ken stuff put her through the ringer,” Thompson’s friend and colleague, Humphrey Barclay, told the New Yorker. She still married him anyway.\n\n“I was embarrassed largely by the press version of our marriage,” Thompson told the New Yorker. “We didn’t present as glamorous in any way. I don’t think we wanted to be some power couple, and we certainly didn’t feel like it.”\n\nThompson worked with Bonham Carter first; they played sisters in “Howard’s End,” the 1991 adaptation of E.M. Forrester’s novel. Thompson won an Oscar for her performance. For 1994’s “Frankenstein,” Branagh directed and played Victor Frankenstein, casting Bonham Carter as his fiancée, while Robert DeNiro played “The Creation.” Branagh and Bonham Carter started a relationship during the production.\n\nThompson ultimately recovered from Branagh’s betrayal with the help of actor Greg Wise, whom she met on the set of “Sense and Sensibility.” Thompson and Wise have since been together for 27 years, married for 19. Branagh and Bonham Carter were together until 1999. She later began a relationship with director Tim Burton and Branagh married film art director Lindsay Brunnock in 2003.\n\nIn Thompson’s 2013 interview with the Sunday Times, she explained that, in spite of everything, she still believed that Bonham Carter was “a wonderful woman.” She said, “That is — as (director) Mike Nichols once said, and I’ve picked it up because I think it’s such a wonderful phrase — all blood under the bridge. You can’t hold on to anything like that. … It’s pointless. I haven’t got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years go.”\n\nThompson said that she and Bonham Carter were similar, saying, “Perhaps that’s why Ken loved us both. She’s a wonderful woman, Helena.”"
