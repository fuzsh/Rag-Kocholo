        "text": "British actor and filmmaker Sir Kenneth Branagh has been married to his wife Lindsay Brunnock since 2003.\n\nThe couple are known to keep their relationship private, so much so that they secretly eloped and didn’t announce their marriage to the public until months later.\n\nBranagh and Bunnock first crossed paths in the late '90s, but didn't start dating until they worked together on the British miniseries Shackleton in 2001. He played the starring role of explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton as he set off on his expedition to the South Pole, while Brunnock worked on set as an art director.\n\nAfter about two years, Branagh and Bunnock eloped in a secret ceremony at a friend's New York City apartment. Neither Branagh nor Brunnock have social media accounts and often keep their private life to themselves, a notable change from the actor's much more public first marriage.\n\nBranagh was previously married to actress Emma Thompson from 1989 until 1995. Once coined as \"the golden couple\" by the British press, they divorced due to Branagh’s affair with Helena Bonham Carter, which began in 1994. Although at the time, Branagh and Thompson said in a joint statement that they had \"drifted apart\" because of their work schedules, per The New York Times.\n\nDespite her heartbreak, Thompson voiced that there is no bad blood between her and Bonham Carter, who continued in a relationship with Branagh until 1998. “That is … all blood under the bridge. You can’t hold on to anything like that,” she told The Sunday Times.\n\nBranagh and Bonham Carter also remained amicable following their split — in fact, the Alice in Wonderland actress was the one who introduced him to his future wife, Brunnock. The couple have now been married for over a decade, and they live a quiet life in Berkshire, England, with their dogs.\n\nShe has seen her husband through some major career achievements, from winning an Oscar to being knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2012, but who is Lindsay Brunnock? Here’s everything to know about Kenneth Branagh’s wife.\n\nShe’s a film art director\n\nBrunnock is a film art director who has worked on a wide range of movies, including the 2006 British comedy-drama Starters for 10, featuring James McAvoy and Benedict Cumberbatch, and the 2003 title Bright Young Things, which Stephen Fry wrote, directed and acted in.\n\nShe and Branagh were introduced by Helena Bonham Carter\n\nA somewhat unlikely meeting, Brunnock first met her future husband through his ex-girlfriend, Bonham Carter. According to the Evening Standard, Brunnock and Bonham Carter became acquainted when they worked together on the 1997 British movie adaptation of George Orwell's novel Keep The Aspidistra Flying, in which Brunnock was an assistant art director while Bonham Carter was part of the main cast.\n\nDuring the filming of the project, the Sweeney Todd actress was dating Branagh and she introduced him to Brunnock, per the Daily Mail.\n\nShe and Branagh eloped in New York City\n\nThe couple married in late May 2003 and kept things low-key with a private wedding that only a few people knew about beforehand. The two wed at an N.Y.C. apartment of an actor whom Branagh knew from his theater production, The Play What I Wrote.\n\nHe later told the Daily Mail that only seven guests were present, including Branagh’s personal assistant at the time, Tamar Thomas, and his driver, Terry Pritchard.\n\nThe ceremony was so private that Branagh only told his parents about the special occasion when he was already on his way to the airport to fly out from England.\n\nThey made their red carpet debut in 2001\n\nBranagh and Brunnock first stepped out as an item in November 2001 at the Gosford Park premiere at the Regus London Film Festival. Since their debut as a couple, the pair have gone on to grace many red carpets.\n\nMore recently, the two were photographed at the 2022 Oscars, when Branagh won an Academy Award for best original screenplay for his semi-autobiographical film, Belfast.\n\nBranagh honored Brunnock when winning his first Oscar\n\nWhen Branagh was presented with his Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Belfast in March 2022, Brunnock was the first to congratulate the eight-time nominee. The couple embraced and shared a sweet kiss before Branagh headed to the stage to collect his award.\n\n“This is an enormous honor for my family,” he said in his heartfelt acceptance speech.\n\nSpeaking with the Daily Mail in May 2016, Branagh spoke about his wife's support while taking on work.\n\n\"She's like most women in that she's smarter than most men,\" he said. \"She's certainly smarter than me and knows me better than I know myself. She understands that it's great when people love what they do, but also knows they need the right kind of balance in their life.\"\n\nShe has visited Branagh on set\n\nBrunnock would frequent the set in Sweden while Branagh was filming the final season of Wallander, a series that deals with many heavy topics surrounding health. He played a character named Kurt Wallander whose Alzheimer’s disease begins to take hold.\n\n“I was more conscious of the need to deal with Wallander’s sadness this time around,” he told the Daily Mail of his role. “I had friends who came out on a regular basis, whereas for previous series I’d tended to bury myself a bit. My missus was there most of the time too and it made for a more normal experience.”"
