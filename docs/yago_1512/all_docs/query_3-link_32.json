        "text": "Emma Thompson has revealed she was ‘utterly blind’ to the fact that her ex-husband, Kenneth Branagh, had an affair with another woman.\n\nThe 63-year-old actress revealed Branagh originally won her over on the set of the 1987 series Fortunes of War, by singing during their spare time.\n\n“I burst into tears because he sounded exactly like my father singing on The Magic Roundabout,” Thompson recalled to The New Yorker, as reported by PageSix.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\n“He was incandescent with ambition and performance energy.”\n\nThe actors, who were once named the “Golden Couple” by the British press, married two years after meeting.\n\nWhen Thompson discovered Branagh was having an affair with Helena Bonham Carter, who played Bellatrix Lestrange in the Harry Potter series, she said she was rocked by the news.\n\nBranagh and Bonham Carter met almost three decades ago, while playing love interests in the 1994 film adaptation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.\n\nThe two went on to date for five years following their on-set affair.\n\n“I was utterly, utterly blind to the fact that he had relationships with other women on set,” Thompson said.\n\n“What I learned was how easy it is to be blinded by your own desire to deceive yourself.”\n\nThe Love Actually actor added that she was only “half alive” when she and Branagh, 61, decided to divorce in 1995.\n\n“Any sense of being a loveable or worthy person had gone completely,” she said.\n\nAlthough her split from Branagh was difficult, Thompson is now married to Sense and Sensibility co-star Greg Wise, who “picked up the pieces and put them back together.”\n\n“I’ve learned more from my second marriage just by being married,” she said of her 19-year relationship with Wise.\n\n“As my mother says, ‘The first 20 years are the hardest.’”\n\nThe couple share two children, adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba Wise, 34, and daughter Gaia Romilly Wise, 22.\n\nIn 2018, Thompson told The Sunday Times any hard feelings toward her ex-husband and Bonham Carter are “all blood under the bridge.”\n\n“You can’t hold on to anything like that. It’s pointless. I haven’t got the energy for it,” she said.\n\n“Helena and I made our peace years and years ago; she’s a wonderful woman.”\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
