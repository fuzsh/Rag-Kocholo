        "text": "Waste heat from Refratechnik Cement heats almost 1000 households in Göttingen, Germany. After a successful start phase at the beginning of January 2024, the district heating project of the cooperation partners Refratechnik Cement GmbH and Public utility company Göttingen was concluded at a ceremony with representatives of the city on Tuesday, 23 January 2024. This date had already been set a year in advance and emphasizes that both partners were not only convinced of the success of the project, but also that the schedule would be met. Refratechnik supplies 12 GWh per year to the district heating network. This is roughly equivalent to supplying heat to 940 single-family homes. For the environment, this means an annual saving of around 3,700 tons of CO2. The waste heat increases the proportion of renewable heat supply by 10%. The construction time for the route extension to Refratechnik took around 10 months. The project duration was approximately three years. And a big THANK YOU to all colleagues involved in the project. Great job, Team Göttingen! #sustainableenergy #renewableheat #districtheating #co2reduction #cementindustry #environmentalimpact #wasteheat\n\nI am pleased to announce that our paper on \"Performance evaluation of hot-mix asphalt with municipal solid waste incineration fly ash using the stress sweep rutting test” has been published in Innovative Infrastructure Solutions. You can check it using the following link: https://lnkd.in/e8Uwy_2H DOI: 10.1007/s41062-023-01230-6 In this research, the work provided aimed to study aspects associated to various fields notably enhancing the sustainability of AC mixtures through the exploration of the potential of using MSWI-FA to substitute virgin aggregate and the assessment of the rutting performance of these mixtures using advanced material characterization. The Stress Sweep Rutting Test is utilized to characterize permanent deformation evolution in the different asphalt mixtures. Furthermore, the Rutting Strain Index (RSI) is quantified to provide a comparative assessment of permanent deformation susceptibility between the asphalt mixtures with various MSWI-FA incorporation percentages. Below is the full-text access link to a view-only version of the paper: https://rdcu.be/dl51U\n\nPLEUGER has been awarded a contract by STRABAG AG in Nordhorn to supply two thrusters for the extension of the Large Wave Flume (GWK) at the Coastal Research Centre (FZK), a joint facility of Leibniz Universität Hannover and Technische Universität Braunschweig. The project's focus on testing and developing maritime technologies for reliable energy supply aligns well with the global emphasis on sustainable and efficient energy solutions. It's great to see collaborative efforts between academic institutions like Leibniz Universität Hannover and Technische Universität Braunschweig, alongside industry leaders like PLEUGER, supported by government funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. This holistic approach ensures that cutting-edge research translates into tangible advancements in maritime technology, benefiting both industry and society as a whole! #PleugerExcellence #waterindustry #oilandgas #watersupply #water #submersiblepumps #pump #Renewableenergy\n\nDiscover how #MiltonRoyPumps excel in handling critical #TEALApplications.

Artificial aeration is known to increase oxygen availability in the system promoting aerobic processes, improve wastewater mixing within the wetland reactor, and enhance the treatment capabilities under higher hydraulic loading rates. The #ConstructedWetlan operates as one unit; the three tanks are connected in series. This setup also includes biochar as part of the substrate in order to monitor the impact on the performance. Moreover, the design follows a maiandric path along the flow: the first and second tanks are connected at the bottom and the second and third tanks at the top. This design promotes different processes within the system that we wish to monitor. As before, the design in tank-in-series will help us to attempt better modelling the wetland system. This project is funded by the ΕΛΙΔΕΚ - Ελληνικό Ίδρυμα Έρευνας και Καινοτομίας - Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation."
