        "text": "Former Birmingham City and West Bromwich Albion defender Graham Potter will test his managerial skills against one of football's most famous bosses in February, after the Europa League draw pitted his FK Ostersunds side against Arsene Wenger's Arsenal.\n\nSolihull-born Potter has enjoyed a succession of promotions since taking over as manager of the Swedish minnows more than six years ago.\n\nOstersunds have now, against all the odds, made it through to the Europa League knockout stages after finishing second in Group J behind Athletic Bilbao.\n\nThey have been rewarded with a last 32 tie against Arsenal as they look to continue their fairytale adventure.\n\nPotter, now 42, was a journeyman professional who started his career as a trainee at Birmingham City where he went on to make 32 senior appearances.\n\nAfter spells with Wycombe Wanders (on loan), Stoke City and Southampton and Stoke, Potter joined West Brom in 1996.\n\nHe made 47 appearances in all competitions during a three-and-a-half year spell at the Hawthorns before moving to York City in 2000.\n\nPotter retired in May 2005 and later that year graduated from the Open University with a degree in Social Sciences.\n\nHe has completely transformed Ostersunds since joining in December 2010, guiding them from the fourth tier to the Allsvenskan, Swedish football's top flight, as well as the Europa League.\n\nThey reached the competition by winning the Swedish Cup in April and have knocked out Turkish giants Galatasaray and negotiated a group containing Bilbao, Hertha Berlin, PAOK and Zorya.\n\nSome of Potter's more unusual methods include his players working together to write books, stage art exhibitions and act in plays.\n\n“I’m not sure how some of our ideas would go down in England,” he told the Guardian in April.\n\n“But we try to develop individuals as open-minded humans rather than just footballers. Educating players and being part of the community are very important. I want to take people out of their comfort zones and teach them to rely on their team-mates.”\n\nHe was named Swedish football coach of the season earlier this year."
