        "text": "Arsenal are preparing for their Europa League Round of 32 first-leg clash with Ostersunds FK tonight, hoping that the competition will provide them with a welcome route back into the Champions League next season.\n\nThe Gunners look set to miss out on the top four for the second season running following last weekend’s disappointing defeat in the North London Derby but the bookies make Arsenal big favourites for their first-leg against their Swedish opposition despite their very poor away form, having lost each of the last four games on their travels.Nevertheless, the Gunners cruised through the group stages of the competition to set up the favourable draw against the Swedish minnows and have performed generally well in Europe so far so they will have their sights firmly set on killing the tie as soon as possible.\n\nBut the Swedish side who were only founded 21 years ago will be hoping to spring a major shock, led by the sole British manager in the Europa League, Graham Potter, who took over at the helm in 2010. He has since guided Ostersunds FK from the Swedish 4th tier to the heady heights of Europa League football and will be hoping that the miracle continues in this historic clash.\n\nFollow all of the live action below!\n\nWhat time does it start?\n\nOstersunds FK vs Arsenal kicks off at 6pm.\n\nWhere can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be shown live on BT Sport 3 from 5.30pm. Highlights will be shown at 10.15pm on BT Sport 2.\n\nIt’s a big game for…\n\nDanny Welbeck: The Arsenal forward has been plagued by injury during his Arsenal career but is ironically the only fit and available first team striker for the Gunners tonight.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette has a knee injury, Olivier Giroud has been sold and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang is cup-tied in the Europa League, much to Arsene Wenger’s frustration.\n\nArsene Wenger has criticised Uefa’s rule which leaves Arsenal‘s £56m January signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ineligible to play in their Europa League round-of-32 first leg against Ostersunds FK on Thursday evening, and the rest of the competition, despite the striker having not played in it this season.\n\nSo the pressure falls upon the shoulders of the former Manchester United forward who has five goals to his name so far this season.\n\nBest stat\n\n18: It is 18 years since Arsenal last took part in this competition having qualified from the group stages of the Champions League for 17 seasons running prior.\n\nIn the 1999-00 season though, the Gunners progressed to the Uefa Cup final where they were beaten by Galatasaray in a penalty-shoot out.\n\nThey will be hoping to go one better, this time around.\n\nPlayer to watch…\n\nAlhaji Gero: The Nigerian forward has scored two goals in Ostersunds memorable Europa League campaign thus far, helping them qualify for this stage for the first time in their history.\n\nHe will be looking to take on his fellow countryman in the shape of Alex Iwobi in pursuit of springing one of the biggest shocks in the competition.\n\nGero to be the hero?\n\nForm guide…\n\nOstersunds FK: WDWLDW\n\nArsenal: LWLWWL\n\nOdds…\n\nOstersunds FK to win: 7/1\n\nArsenal to win: 21/50\n\nDraw: 18/5"
