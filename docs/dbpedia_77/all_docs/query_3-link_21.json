        "text": "Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nArsenal will kick off the knockout phase of their UEFA Europa League campaign on Thursday when they travel to Swedish side Ostersunds.\n\nThe Gunners will also be hoping to bounce back after they lost 1-0 to bitter rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby on Saturday.\n\nHere are the viewing details for the clash:\n\nDate: Thursday, February 15\n\nTime: 6 p.m. GMT/1 p.m. ET\n\nTV: BT Sport 3 (UK), Fox Sports 2 USA, ESPN3 USA\n\nLive Stream: BT Sport Player (UK), Fox Sports Go (USA), WatchESPN (USA)\n\nPreview\n\nAfter their latest defeat, Arsenal are sixth in the Premier League and seven points behind fourth-placed Spurs, so the Europa League perhaps represents their best chance of qualifying for next year's Champions League.\n\nGiven winning it also brings a major trophy, the Gunners should go all out in the competition in which they are one of the strongest remaining teams.\n\nManager Arsene Wenger has not reached that stage yet, though, per Goal:\n\nHe's nevertheless set to name a strong side for Thursday's match, per James Olley of the Evening Standard.\n\nWithout Olivier Giroud to call upon after his departure to Chelsea in January, Alexandre Lacazette would likely have been used as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is ineligible to play, but the Gunners confirmed on their official website on Tuesday he could be out for six weeks after having surgery on his knee.\n\nAs such, Arsenal are left only with Danny Welbeck as a recognised senior option up front.\n\nInjuries have restricted the England international to just 23 appearances this season, but he has only managed five goals, which is indicative of his careerâ€”he's not a prolific scorer, with his best season at Arsenal ending with a tally of eight.\n\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\n\nIt will be an opportunity for the striker to improve his record and stake a claim for further opportunities during Lacazette's absence.\n\nArsenal should have enough about them to progress far in the Europa League, but Ostersunds will be a tricky proposition.\n\nThe Swedes have enjoyed a fairytale run of three promotions under manager Graham Potter since he took charge in 2010, taking them from the fourth tier to the top flight, and they won the Swedish Cup last year.\n\nOstersunds beat Galatasaray in the qualifying phase of this year's Europa League and beat Hertha Berlin in the group stage, in which they shipped just four goals and their only defeat was at Athletic Bilbao.\n\nThe club hinted at the cold weather conditions Arsenal can expect to face:\n\nOstersunds have demonstrated they are no pushovers, so a good result at the Jamtkraft Arena won't be easy to attain for the Gunners."
