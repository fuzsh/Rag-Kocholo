        "text": "Hotels in Ostersund\n\nAs Ãstersund doesnât boast the same reputation with tourists as other Swedish towns and cities, youâre unlikely to find the range of accommodation that other destinations offer. However, thereâs plenty of mid-range hotels for a reasonable price in and around the town which, when combine with the snowy surroundings, make for a memorable stay. Most of the hotels in the city are competitively priced so be sure to shop around before making a reservation.\n\nShopping in Ostersund\n\nÃstersund offers a shopping experience to rival most British towns and cities with plenty of shopping centres and a bustling high-street. With a little rummaging around the smaller streets, youâre sure to find plenty of keepsakes and souvenirs to remember your visit by. If you want a uniquely Swedish purchase, consider a trip to Woolpower where you can buy 100% Swedish wool clothing that is said to be as warming and durable as it is sustainably produced, the perfect purchase to combat the chilly climate.\n\nFood & Drink in Ostersund\n\nThe people of Ãstersund pride themselves on their locally sourced food and drink as theyâre often able to tell you exactly where each cut of meat or bottle of wine has come from. While youâll be able to easily find all the Swedish classics like meatballs, fish and lingonberries, thereâs plenty of international dishes to try as wellâ itâs well worth booking at one of the many Asian restaurants to experience a local take on Chinese or Indian staples.\n\nEvents in Ostersund\n\nÃstersundâs central location within Sweden makes it a natural choice for several events and festivals. If you fancy making one of the cityâs celebrations the centrepiece of your visit, hereâs a few of our top picks:\n\nBiathlon World Championships\n\nA combination of quick skiing and eagle-eyed marksmanship makes Biathlon one of the most challenging winter sports and with the world championships held in Ãstersund, you can enjoy a rare chance to see the most talented Biathletes in action.\n\nStorsjÃ¶yran\n\nOne of the biggest Scandinavian music festivals, StorsjÃ¶yran takes place at the start of August and features both top acts from around the world as well as local talent. If you fancy a festival experience but want to avoid the prices of Glastonbury or V-Fest, this is a great option."
