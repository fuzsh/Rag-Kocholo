        "text": "Name: Anke Peters\n\nProgramme: Master in Tourism\n\nPeriod of study: 2020-2022\n\nWhy did you choose to study the master’s programme in Tourism?\n\nI’m from Germany and did my bachelor there in biodiversity and ecology. I knew that I wanted to continue studying and researching within tourism, but I couldn't find a programme that I thought was attractive enough in Germany. So, I started searching more broadly for programmes and found that Östersund had both a tourism programme and a tourism research centre. I already knew about Östersund because my family used to holiday here when I was little, and I knew that I loved the city. So I guess it was natural that I chose to study here.\n\nAlso, with the tourism programme here you can choose between a one- or two-year programme. That was very comforting, I thought if I don't like it it's only for one year. But it turned out that I really liked it and enjoyed it so much that I stayed for the two years master programme, and still counting.\n\nYes, and you still live in Östersund. What happened after your two years in the master’s programme?\n\nAfter the programme ended, the tourism research centre ETOUR was looking for a project assistant. I applied for the porition and luckily also got it. I started as an assistant in a project where we explored how wind turbines impact tourists perception of the natural landscape. I also started teaching parallel to being an assistant. I have also been involved in planning the 31st Nordic Symposium on Tourism and Hospitality Research, an international tourism research conference that ETOUR hosted here in Östersund last autumn. And now I just started my PhD, which I’m so excited about!\n\nWhat did you like most about the master’s programme?\n\nOne strength about the programme is that we are in the middle of the environment we are researching and studying. The course contents are always related to the surroundings, which makes them very tangible. If you are interested in learning about sustainable and nature tourism, then this is an oasis for you. Also, while the courses you take follow a set schedule, within the courses there is lots of room for flexibility. Because the Swedish university system relies heavily on self-studying, you have a great opportunity to focus on the issues that you find most interesting. Another thing I really appreciated was the small size of courses and close and informal relationship with teacher and professors.\n\nI also think it is very good that the programme offers an internship. During the first year, you accumulate so much knowledge and have such competent teachers and researchers. Then you write your master's thesis, and in the last semester you get the opportunity to go out into the real world and see how it all works in practice. I think it was such a good chance to link back to everything I had learned during the programme and get an understanding and opportunity to use the knowledge in practice. The fact that the internship is placed in the last semester is also very good because it gives you a chance to continue working at your internship site if they offer you a job.\n\nFinally, I want to highlight the Östersund campus with its fantastic location! You are surrounded by mountains and beautiful nature and Östersund is also a very cosy city – a small town with little local events and happenings that makes me feel very much at home.\n\nWhat do you like to do when you are not working or studying?\n\nThere are so many different activities depending on what season it is here. In the winter I like to skate, experiencing nature or have a coffee at one of the cafes in town. In the summer I enjoy all the different cafes that pops up. If you feel like it, you can go over to Norway and Trondheim. There's so much to discover!\n\nWhat would you like to say to those who are thinking of applying?\n\nDo it! I would definitely recommend to study the master's programme in tourism here - both from an educational perspective and because of Östersund as a city and destination. If you want to study in a small town that has the tourism industry as a base with fantastic nature all around, you've come to the right place!\n\nAnother strong argument for this master’s is that it is an international programme. I studied together with people from Sweden, Finland, England, Italy, India, Bangladesh, Uganda and Cameroon. It's like the world meets in Östersund. It’s just a really cool and rewarding experience to be part of such a diverse group. I don't know where else I would get the chance to learn about so many different cultures and perspectives! And because tourism is such a broad subject, we also had people from different educational backgrounds - everything from theatre, geography, events and hospitality. It is such a unique work and study environment. I came from a small village in Germany and got to meet all these people who broadened my perspective even though I've moved to another relatively small town in northern Sweden. That’s so cool!"
