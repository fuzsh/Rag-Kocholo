        "text": "Ostersunds, only formed in October 1996, welcome the Gunners in the round of 32 - so what links them to several of our clubs?\n\nTheir English manager Graham Potter was born in the West Midlands town of Solihull and will be a familiar name to supporters of York City, Boston United and Macclesfield Town.\n\nThe full-back played over 100 times for York at the turn of the Millennium before making a dozen appearances for Boston.\n\nPotter finished his playing career with the Silkmen in 2005 at the age of 30 before eventually moving into coaching with Swedish outfit Ostersunds in 2011.\n\nWith Potter finding it difficult to attract players to a fourth tier side in Scandinavia, he returned to England to recruit.\n\nPotter told BBC Sport: “Jamie Hopcutt was someone we brought in in the second year. I knew him from York City, he was a talented player who wasn't ready to play first-team football in England physically.\n\n“They were the types we looked for and then, as we've gone through the levels it's become a bit easier.”\n\nOstersunds have been promoted three times under Potter and are now winning plenty of fans across Europe.\n\nPotter isn’t the only link National League clubs have with the Swedish club. They have two Englishmen currently on their books - Hopcutt and Curtis Edwards.\n\nMidfielder Hopcutt, 25, was released by York City at the age of 19 but has bounced back to become a star for Potter’s men.\n\nEdwards, who also plays in midfield, is only 23 and spent time with Darlington and Spennymoor Town following his release from Middlesbrough in 2013.\n\nSwedish defender Doug Bergqvist is also a familiar name having previously turned out for Aldershot Town and Welling United.\n\nThe trio will be flying the National League flag tonight before travelling to the Emirates for the return fixture next Thursday."
