        "text": "It has finally been confirmed that Graham Potter is coming on board as Swansea City’s new manager having held talks with the club’s hierarchy in recent weeks and a compensation package agreed.\n\nThe 43-year-old had been the frontrunner for the job since Carlos Carvalhal left the club following Swansea’s relegation from the Premier League.\n\nAnd the former England Under-21 international will soon officially take charge at the Liberty Stadium ahead of the Swans’ first season in the Championship since 2011.\n\nHe has impressed in his seven years at Swedish club Ostersunds, leading them from the fourth tier to the top-flight, to cup glory and an impressive Europa League campaign.\n\nBut what exactly will Potter bring to South Wales now the job is his, and what style of play will he look to implement?\n\nWe spoke to Niclas Åkerström — a journalist at the Östersunds-Posten — to find out...\n\nWhat do you make of Graham Potter and the job he's done with Östersund?\n\nWhat Graham Potter has accomplished in Östersund is something very, very special.\n\nKnowing that the club was in the fourth division, in a city that is most famous for its skiing performances, it is simply remarkable what he has done.\n\nNot only to the club and the fans, but also the city and region at large.\n\nThe only way to describe his journey is to compare it with a fairy tale.\n\nWhat style of football does he demand from his team?\n\nIn his view of the game, football should be played on the grass. It doesn’t matter what team he has faced, short-passing and possession has always been his trademark.\n\nThough I would say that he has had to adapt his game a little bit more this season. The opponents have learned their lesson from the two previous seasons, playing more cynically and are more often seen as “parking the bus”.\n\nThis has been a challenge for Östersund who after a tough introduction now might have found their way back to getting the points that are expected.\n\nWhat is he like with players, fans and the media?\n\nThis has probably been one of his best strengths during his time here. Because the club hasn’t had the money and are placed in such a remote place in the country, Potter has had to work with players who weren't wanted by other teams.\n\nThere are a couple of cases where he signed a player that hasn’t had the best reputation but managed to get him grow, as a player and person.\n\nHe is always very good with the media and takes time to answer all of our questions. Even after a press conference you can still have your own little chat with him.\n\nAnd as for the fans, they love him.\n\nWhat are his strengths?\n\nGetting the most out of every single player, turning what can be seen as lost talent into an extraordinary player. He's also well known for his tactical skills.\n\nHe is not afraid of mixing with players, positions and formations. Even when he switched nine players from a Europa League-game to the next in Allsvenskan he managed to get a great result and performance.\n\nWhat are his weaknesses?\n\nIt's quite hard to say so far. This is the first season where Östersund has been seen as one of the favorites to win the league.\n\nAfter nine games they have only managed to take eleven points giving them an eleventh place in the league.\n\nGiven that a few players (Saman Ghoddos, Ken Sema and Sotiris Papagiannopoulos) might be gone after the coming transfer window, we don’t really know how Potter will tackle that (if he's still here).\n\nTo make a longer story short: it is uncertain how Potter will do in a team where the expectations is to win every single game.\n\nDo you think he'd be suited to life as a manager in the Championship?\n\nIf nothing else it will be very interesting to see him take the challenge. The pressure on him, from the club, fans and media, would skyrocket compared to what he has to put with here.\n\nHow will he handle that? Will he be able to bring his ideas that made him respected and successful in Östersund? Will he have the same freedom that he has now?\n\nThere are a lot of questions to be asked if he gets the job. But I get a feeling that the reward for Swansea City can be worth it."
