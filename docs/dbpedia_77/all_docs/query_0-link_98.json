        "text": "Mitchell to Investigate U.S.O.C. Bribery Issue (Dec. 22, 1998)\n\nBy JERE LONGMAN\n\nALT LAKE CITY -- Cash payments were made by local Olympic officials to members of the International Olympic Committee during this city's bid to be awarded the 2002 Winter Games, according to investigators.\n\nOne investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the individual payments ranged from $5,000 to $70,000 and were made to I.O.C. members from Africa and Latin America. The investigator said the payments appeared to have come from the Salt Lake City bid committee's $14 million, privately financed operating budget, although investigators were still trying to determine the exact number of payments, the dollar amounts and the full roster of recipients.\n\nThe Associated Press Salt Lake City earned the 2002 Winter Olympics after failing in four other bids over 25 years to land the Games. There are investigations into whether improper inducements were used.\n\nThe investigators cautioned that the reasons for the payments were not yet known and that it was possible that some might be explained as legitimate reimbursement for travel expenses or as money earmarked for humanitarian aid such as athletic equipment or training programs. The normal channels for making humanitarian contributions are through an I.O.C. program called Solidarity or through national Olympic committees, not through individuals, although some I.O.C. members serve as presidents of their national Olympic committees.\n\nInvestigators said they were trying to determine whether any of the payments -- possible inducements apart from anything already uncovered in the unfolding scandal -- occurred during the I.O.C. session in June 1995 in Budapest at which Salt Lake City won the 2002 Winter Games in a landslide vote over Ostersund, Sweden; Sion, Switzerland, and Quebec.\n\nIf investigators determine that the payments were made in an effort to buy votes, the scandal here, already a profound embarrassment to the city as well as to international Olympic officials, will be raised a significant level.\n\nSalt Lake City Olympic officials have previously acknowledged spending nearly $400,000 on a tuition payment and athletic training program that benefited 13 persons, 6 of whom were relatives of I.O.C. members, most from Africa. Salt Lake City officials described these programs as humanitarian aid, not bribery. But investigators said they were trying to determine if some of those tuition payments went to relatives of I.O.C. members who then never attended school.\n\nInvestigators have also discovered that $28,000 worth of medical services were provided through the bid committee for three people with apparent Olympic connections.\n\nTom Welch, who was president of the Salt Lake City Olympic bid committee, has acknowledged giving items such as shotguns and skis to I.O.C. members, favors that exceeded the United States Olympic Committee's $150 limit on gifts.\n\nBut he has called such gift-giving commonplace, and has said that Salt Lake City did not do anything that other cities bidding for the Olympics have not done.\n\nRepeated calls to Welch have not been returned in recent days, and there was no answer at the door of his condominium in Park City, Utah.\n\nInvestigators said it may prove impossible to determine whether any of Salt Lake City's efforts produced the desired votes, for the 114 I.O.C. members who decide on the Games' sites cast secret ballots. Moreover, the vote in 1995 was not close, as Salt Lake City won easily on the first ballot. (Salt Lake City had 54 votes; Sion and Ostersund 14 each, and Quebec 7.) At the moment, it is also unclear to investigators whether such a scheme would constitute a violation of any state or Federal law.\n\n\"The staff at the organizing committee is not getting updates from any investigator on what they might or might not be finding,\" said Shelley Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Salt Lake City organizing committee. \"These are more reasons why we are hoping for quick conclusions and solid answers as to what happened during the bidding process.\"\n\nThere are four investigations under way into Salt Lake City's efforts to secure the Olympics: inquiries by the I.O.C., the U.S.O.C., the United States Justice Department and an internal Salt Lake City ethics panel. All four investigations were prompted by bribery charges made last month by Marc Hodler, a senior I.O.C. official from Switzerland who alleged that similar vote-buying efforts had been made in many prior selection processes.\n\nThe I.O.C. has announced that it will not strip Salt Lake City of the 2002 Games. But executives of the U.S.O.C, concerned about shaken corporate and public confidence in the Olympic movement and faced with having to raise more than $200 million in a joint operating agreement to reach Salt Lake City's budget of $1.45 billion for the 2002 Games, have been meeting this week with Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah in an effort to try to rebuild public support.\n\nThe Governor has called on the private organizing committee to place top Salt Lake City Olympic officials on administrative leave during the four investigations.\n\nOlympic officials have described in recent weeks a process by which Salt Lake City Olympic officials targeted the votes of 17 African I.O.C. members after losing by four votes to Nagano, Japan, for the right to be host to the 1998 Winter Olympics.\n\n\"Their thinking was that they had lost the Olympic Games to a bloc of African votes that had been purchased by others,\" said one Olympic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"They were bound and determined not to allow that to happen again. That's what started them down the slippery slope.\"\n\nSeeking the Votes to Win the Games\n\nodler, the Swiss I.O.C. official, has said that up to 25 of the 114 I.O.C. members may have sold their votes in recent elections to name Olympic cities, and he has said that agents, or middlemen, demand up to $1 million to secure blocs of votes and then charge the winning city $3 million to $5 million for their services.\n\nEvidence of such extravagant demands has not surfaced, but since Hodler made his charges, a number of Olympic officials have supported the notion that cities bidding on the Games sometimes go too far in providing gifts and services and that some I.O.C. members have their hands out in expectation of receiving lavish favors.\n\nThe Associated Press Tom Welch, ex-president of the Salt Lake City organizing committee, has said it did not do anything other Olympic bid cities have not done.\n\n\"In Washington, there are checks and balances in government; but the I.O.C. is not responsible to any constituency,\" said Robert Helmick, a former member of the I.O.C. and president of the United States Olympic Committee who resigned in 1991 in a conflict-of-interest scandal. \"Their excesses are allowed to go virtually unchecked. That type of situation leads to corruption.\"\n\nHelmick has accused Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the I.O.C., of not being forceful enough in policing the excesses of committee members. In an interview, Helmick spoke of I.O.C. members being taken on shopping sprees for fur coats and jewelry, worth a total of $3,000 to $8,000, while visiting bid cities. At the 1991 I.O.C. session in Birmingham, England, where the 1998 Winter Games were awarded to Nagano over Salt Lake City, the I.O.C. set up its own parcel post station so that its members could mail their loads of gifts home, Helmick said.\n\nSandy Knapp, a member of the U.S.O.C.'s executive committee, said that some of the criticism of Salt Lake City seemed hypocritical and added that she believed the city was being made a scapegoat by the I.O.C.\n\n\"How can people who made this into an art form turn around and say, 'Oh, those bums,'?\" she said. \"They knew it was Christmas every day. It's amazing how they can ignore what has been common knowledge and expect to have any credibility.\"\n\nBefore their successful bid for the 2002 Games, Salt Lake City had bid on the Winter Olympics four times over 25 years and lost every time. Local officials approached the 2002 Games with tempered confidence that their fifth bid would be a winner.\n\nMany Olympic officials, in the United States and elsewhere, believe that Salt Lake City would have won the 1998 Winter Games if another American city, Atlanta, had not been awarded the 1996 Summer Olympics. Salt Lake City had a superior bid in terms of sports facilities and infrastructure. In losing by only four votes to Nagano for the 1998 Games, according to American Olympic officials, Salt Lake City felt it was given a clear message by the I.O.C.: \"Stay in another four years and you will win.\"\n\nSalt Lake City officials also received another message, according to John Ruger, a member of the board of directors of the Salt Lake City and United States Olympic committees.\n\n\"I think our people saw the largess coming from Japan,\" Ruger said. \"Japanese corporations had contributed to building the I.O.C. museum. There were rumors of diamond rings. I think our people saw one bid committee doing something and thought they had to do a little more. They didn't want to lose again. They got caught up in that. I think it's a climate we've got to stop. The Salt Lake City bid committee definitely made mistakes and was wrong.\"\n\nThe Target: The African Bloc\n\needing more than 50 votes among I.O.C. members to become the host in 2002, Salt Lake City would have to maintain a wide base of international support. But the Salt Lake City bid committee, according to investigators as well as officials familiar with its effort, paid close attention to one area that could prove to be critical: Africa.\n\nAfrica had never been host to any Olympic Games, and its I.O.C. members had no vested interest in where winter competitions would be. The bid committee calculated that the North American vote would be divided between Salt Lake City and Quebec, while the European vote seemed likely to be split over the two other competitors, Sion and Ostersund. There were 17 potentially decisive African votes at stake.\n\nThere has long been a perception among some Olympic officials that African I.O.C. members vote as a bloc, although this is impossible to know because the balloting is secret.\n\n\"I think the record will show that there was a concerted effort by some members from Africa who sought support for themselves from this bid committee,\" said an Olympic official.\n\nPoint Men for the Bid\n\nn shaping Salt Lake City's Africa strategy, local officials relied in part on the advice and vast connections of Andrew Young, the former ambassador to the United Nations who was chairman of the Atlanta Olympic bid committee and was vital in securing the 1996 Summer Games. Young said he told Salt Lake City officials that they should visit every I.O.C. member personally and that they should provide athletic training aid when possible in developing nations.\n\nThe local point man for Africa was Bennie Smith, a former football player at Brigham Young University who is president of a Salt Lake City construction company. He is also black, which the overwhelmingly white Salt Lake City bid committee, according to American Olympic officials, felt would be advantageous in dealing with I.O.C. members from Africa. Smith has declined to speak to reporters about the vote-buying charges.\n\nThe Associated Press Marc Hodler, an I.O.C. member, has alleged vote-buying efforts.\n\nSmith and Young, however, were not the only people enlisted to boost Salt Lake City's cause. Salt Lake City officials have acknowledged that Mahmoud El Farnawani, a former national volleyball coach in Egypt, was paid $58,000 by the Salt Lake City bid committee in 1994 for his assistance in providing access to I.O.C. members from North Africa.\n\nAnd there was direct financial assistance provided to African I.O.C. members and their families. In 1991, after losing to Nagano, Salt Lake City began a program of tuition and athletic training assistance that continued until last fall.\n\nIn a mid-December interview, Welch, the former president of the Salt Lake City Olympic bid committee, described the scholarship program as a legitimate effort in the Olympic tradition of a rich nation helping poorer, less developed nations.\n\n\"We felt this was one of the roles we could play to improve an understanding of who we were, and we could be of help,\" said Welch, who resigned in 1997 as president of the Salt Lake City Olympic organizing committee after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge of spousal battery. \"Most cities didn't bid as long as Salt Lake. These people were our friends. I think we became part of the Olympic family.\"\n\nThough it has been defended as humanitarian aid, there was potential strategic value to the aid.\n\nOne scholarship went to the daughter of Rene Essomba, an I.O.C. member from Cameroon who, until he died last year, was executive director of the national Olympic committees of Africa. The Salt Lake City scandal broke last November when a local television station was leaked a 1996 letter from Dave Johnson, a top Salt Lake City Olympic official, to Sonia Essomba, saying that a $10,000 tuition payment would be her last.\n\nAs well, Jean-Claude Ganga, an I.O.C. member from Congo Republic and a former ambassador to China, received free treatment for hepatitis in Salt Lake City, one investigator said. Ganga holds influence as the president of the national Olympic committees of Africa. Investigators said they were examining a land deal, which was first reported by The Associated Press, that was arranged by Smith three months after the Games were awarded and on which Ganga made a $60,000 profit.\n\nThe son of a third I.O.C. member from Africa, David Sibandze of the tiny kingdom of Swaziland, worked as an intern in City Hall in Salt Lake City during its bid for the 2002 Games. The son also received tuition assistance from local Olympic officials, an investigator said, while he attended the University of Utah, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees.\n\nSibandze, who owns a fast-food business in Swaziland and has eight children, has been linked to scholarship offers and medical services in three other recent Olympic bids. He said he did not know if Salt Lake City officials gave his son tuition aid, but said: \"Education is education. If you want your child to be educated, you try everything you can.\"\n\nSam Ramsamy, the president of the South African Olympic Committee, has cautioned against assuming that I.O.C. members from Africa are susceptible to corruption. Other Olympic officials said it was important to realize that the Olympic movement involves many cultures and that things that seem inappropriate in one culture are considered appropriate in others.\n\nIn an interview, Young said that while he did not know about the scholarships and free medical care, he considered these programs to be a show of Olympic generosity and solidarity, not bribery.\n\n\"I don't have any problem with people educating anybody, any time, for any reason,\" Young said, adding that \"this is one of the things that levels the playing field, not corrupts it.\"\n\nMembers of the I.O.C. have declined to chastise other members publicly. Privately, though, several have said they found it disturbing that any member would benefit personally from a city's bidding on the Winter or Summer Games.\n\nAcknowledging Aid, but Not Vote-Buying\n\nerhard Heiberg, an I.O.C. member from Norway, said in an interview that one or more members of the committee should be expelled \"to show that we are serious and to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\nHodler has identified El Farnawani, who lives in a Toronto suburb, as an agent who offered to sell blocs of votes for money. El Farnawani was quoted in a Toronto newspaper in 1995 as saying that he had assured the North African vote to Salt Lake City officials.\n\nIn an interview, however, El Farnawani said he offered only access to I.O.C. members from North Africa, not guarantees. He could not guarantee a bloc of votes because the voting is done by secret ballot, he said. A bid city would be foolish to pay him an exorbitant amount of money to deliver a bloc of votes, he said, because he could never prove that he delivered the votes.\n\nThe son of Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, the I.O.C. member from Libya, has acknowledged receiving tuition aid to two Utah universities from Salt Lake City Olympic officials from 1995 until last October. El Farnawani, who described Bashir Attarabulsi as a good friend and a very religious man, said that Attarabulsi was concerned about the propriety of tuition aid but saw the scholarship as a way to keep his younger son from having to join an older brother in the Libyan army.\n\nAttempts to reach the Attarabulsis for comment were unsuccessful. In his only comment, Suhel Attarabulsi denied to The Deseret News of Salt Lake City that his father had sold his vote for the tuition aid.\n\nFred Ball, a member of the bid committee, said his worst concern now was that \"people assume wrongly that we bought this.\"\n\n\"We won on the first ballot, on merit,\" Ball said. \"But that's not the perception.\""
