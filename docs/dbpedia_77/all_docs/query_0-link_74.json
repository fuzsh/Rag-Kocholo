        "text": "THE Ostersund striker to see his penalty saved may not have been so gutted - as he's an Arsenal fan!\n\nTom Pettersson had his moment in the spotlight when Hector Bellerin gifted the Swedish minnows the chance to pull a goal back in injury time.\n\nBut with the Gunners 3-0 down, skipper David Ospina dropped to his left to foil the midfielder.\n\nIt was the first time a Gunners keeper has saved a spot-kick in almost four years.\n\nPettersson will have been in disbelief that Ospina succeeded where Petr Cech has failed so many times.\n\nBut as Arsenal fans were lauding Ospina on social media, someone flicking through pictures on Pettersson's Twitter account noticed something else.\n\nOSTERSUND 0 ARSENAL 3 Mesut Ozil and Nacho Monreal help Gunners ease to Europa League win\n\nBack on August 14 in 2016, Pettersson posted a picture of him with a baby wearing Arsenal shirts with the hashtags #COYG and #cardiac punishment.\n\nHe would certainly have been put through the wringer that day .\n\nTwo goals from Philippe Coutinho meant the Gunners lost 4-3 at home to Liverpool in their first Premier League game of the season."
