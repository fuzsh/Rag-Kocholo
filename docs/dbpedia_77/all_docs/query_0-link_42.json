        "text": "Air Europa and Corendon are back in town!\n\nJonas and Simon were back in Östersund for a few days so they took the opportunity to shoot the arrivals of Air Europa and Corendon.\n\n-Thursday\n\nAir Europa is back again this year flying from Grand Canarias to Östersund. They are flying during eight weeks this winter with a Boeing 737-800.\n\nWe had planed to head out to the airport in the morning for the arrival of Freebird but we woke up to low clouds, rain and TC-FBV on it’s way in. TC-FBV is the most common Freebird at Östersund so we decided to stay home and wait out the weather.\n\nAir Europa was due to arrive at 15:00 and the rain and clouds started to clear up by lunch. We headed out to the airport and talked to the ATC-controller who was kind enough let us come up in the tower to get the shots.\n\nA classic spotter meal, coffee and chocolate cake! Also known as \"fika\" in Sweden.\n\nWe got there a bit early so we stayed in the car with a cup of coffee and some chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was made on demand from Jonas as a reason to come home over the weekend!\n\nAir Europa 751, EC-III on runway 12 after a long flight from Grand Canaria.\n\nAfter some time we could hear Air Europa 751 over the radio and it was time to head up to the tower! Not long after that EC-III touched down on runway 12 after a 05:19h long flight directly from Grand Canarias. Murphy’s law was present as always and we hade a few clouds that covered the sun just as they arrived. It cleared up shortly after!\n\nAbout 30 minutes later SAS arrived on one of it’s scheduled flights from Arlanda as SK2064 with LN-RRR, a Boeing 737-600. The sky was now clear and the autumn light was just great.\n\nScandinavian 2064, LN-RRR on short final runway 12.\n\nSimon seen here taking some shots of the arrival of SAS.\n\nDirektflyg with a JS31 after departure from runway 30 on it's way to Umeå.\n\nBoth SAS and Air Europa got ready around the same time but Air Europa was quick and got the taxi clearance first! They slowly taxied out for runway 30 and departed a few minutes late after an hour turnaround. It was a heavy departure for sure, took almost the whole runway to get airborne for it’s 06:10h long flight back home.\n\nNot long after SAS was ready and departed from runway 30 about 10 min later, also in beautiful light!\n\nIt was now time to head home but not for long. Corendon was to arrive the next day!\n\nSeen here as Air Europa 752 infront of the terminal.\n\nScandinavian 2065 heading back to Stockholm.\n\n-Friday\n\nCorendon was to arrive at 18:30 so it was dark when we headed out to the airport. We got over to the other side of the airport to film the landing on runway 30. It was so dark by now that we hade a hard time to find our way back to the car after the landing.\n\nJonas is waiting for the arrival of Corendon!\n\nIt was a very busy evening at the aiport!\n\nWe headed down to the terminal after they landed to see if we could go airside to get some shoots. The terminal was stuffed with passengers once we got there, so we didn’t bother to ask when we noticed that Corendon had parked very close to the car parking. So we could get some shots from there.\n\nWe got some shots and video from the parking lot of the departure. The temperature was now below zero and with a cold breeze, so we headed home for some other Friday activities as soon as they departed.\n\nCorendon 737-800 just before it's departure back to Antalya. Note the \"We love Alanya\" sign on it's nose.\n\nThat was it from this week but make sure that you don’t miss the episode of our Vlog from these two days! It’s in Swedish but with English subtitles! And also, sorry for the late publishing of the video! We had some technical issues during the editing causing the delay.\n\nJonas Herjeby\n\nVideo/Edit\n\njonasherjeby@osdphoto.com\n\nSimon Brygg\n\nPhoto/Text\n\nsimonbrygg@osdphoto.com\n\nMore charter traffic and a visit from Malmö Aviation.\n\nToday Simon headed out to Östersund airport for the arrival of two SAS charter flights, along with another charter from Malmö Aviation and the \"normal\" arrival of Freebird from Antalya.\n\nThe first arrival of the day was Frida Viking, LN-RRJ, one of the newer from SAS 737-800's with winglets. It was a charter flight from an unknown location, the last stop on its way was Arlanda and we don't know so much more than that.\n\nLN-RRJ in action on runway 12 after landning as SAS7010 from Arlanda. LN-RRJ was delivered directly from Boeing in 2009 and was one of the first 737s to fly in SAS colors with winglets.\n\nThey arrived on time, 08:15 local time on runway 12 in cold and windy conditions and just 15 min later her sister LN-RRS arrived as the second charter from SAS this day! They where both fast to unload as they where to fly empty back to Arlanda. During the time they were getting ready we had a nowadays rare visitor from a MD-80, LN-ROT Ingjaid Viking, flying one of the daily scheduled flight for SAS as SK066. A lovely sight as always! We now had three SAS airplanes at the apron at the same time, even that is a rare sight at Östersund Aiport in 2012!\n\nLN-RRS, Ymer Viking was delivered to SAS in 2001 as SE-DYM and has now been equipped with a WI-FI, Internet receiver on the roof.\n\nNot every day that we see the lovely MD80 at Östersund anymore! Seen here on taxiway Foxtrot on it's way to the apron as SAS066. LN-ROT, Ingjaid Viking, was delivered to SAS in 1986 as SE-DFV, then later SE-DFR.\n\n15 years ago you could see a line of MD80 and DC9 like this but to have three flights from SAS at the apron at the same time is not a common sight nowadays!\n\nA nose view of LN-RRJ right before the engine start.\n\nIt was very stressful for me as a single photographer this day to capture everything on video and photos as one plane arrived and another departed. This was the case when I was shooting LN-RRJ starting up and I could see Freebird TC-FBV on short final runway 12. I had to move quickly and reset the camera with another lens to get some video of the landing! You can actually see on the vLog when LN-RRJ is taking of just as I shoot Freebird on her way in to the apron! I can say that we aren't used to have more than one movement at the time at this airport!\n\nThe captain \"hands\" back the final papers to the load master right before departure. Note the paper in \"mid air\"\n\nThe second 737-800 for the day is heading back empty to Arlanda after leaving off the charter passengers. Note the Wi-Fi module on the roof. (The landning can be seen in the vLog)\n\nLN-RRS was soon to follow her sister down to Arlanda, so I got the departure on video and then I had to relocate fast to get the landing of the RJ 100, SE-DSR from Malmö Aviation! And just as they landed, the MD80 requested startup as SK073. Once again I had to act fast and move again to get the angle that I wanted of that departure! I got there in time and what a lovely sound as the MD80 powered down the runway!\n\nJust look at that! The power off the Maddog taking of is something special! Seen here as SAS073 to Stockholm, Arlanda.\n\nMalmö Aviation also had a charter flight to Östersund today, seen here before departure back to Malmö. SE-DSR was built in in 1994 and flew as N506MM for Sociedad Aeronautica Medellin before it was delivered to Malmö Aviation back in 2001. (The landning can be seen in the vLog)\n\nTC-FBV, same plane as last week! Seen here after departure from runway 12, heading for Antalya. (The landning can be seen in the vLog)\n\nDon't think that I could take a small pause now, no no! Once again I had to act fast and get back down next to the apron as the RJ-100 was getting ready for departure as well! I got there in time and got some photos of her at the apron and some video from the takeoff!\n\nFreebird was parked on the other side of the terminal so I knew that I couldn't get any good shots from there so once again I headed up to the other side of the airfield to get a nice view from the takeoff! Again I was lucky and got up there just as Freebird started to move on the apron. I took a nice shoot from the angle that I liked and I could finally calm down after two hectic hours!\n\nAs always, everything is happening at the same time and then the airport gets quiet and has not another movement for a few hours, so it was time to head for lunch and then head home!\n\nThat was it for now and make sure you don't miss the episode of our Vlog from this day below.\n\nA new feature in the Vlog now is that it is all in English now!\n\nSimon Brygg\n\nsimonbrygg@osdphoto.com\n\nKungsair Flight Training in Norrköping Part Two\n\nSimon has now completed his practical flight training in Norrköping and here are some photos and information about what has happened since the last report.\n\nThe last few weeks have been very hectic for me at the flight school so I haven't had the time to keep you guys up to date, sorry for that but i'm going to tell you all about it now!\n\nThis report will cover the flight training in the Travel Air, so it's the part in the multi engine airplane! I have completed 50 hours of instrument-training in the single engined Slingsby and spent my last 30 hours in the Travel Air with more instrument-training, cross country flying and emergency training flying with only one engine operative.\n\nView from the porch at the flight school\n\nWe started of with some basic training, learning how to handle the airplane and it's systems with some basic things like stall, steep turns, short field landings and so on. We also had to do one full day on the ground for the technical course and a written test to make sure that we could handle it's systems before we could start the cross country flights.\n\nOn the first day of cross country flights we flew Norrköping-Göteborg-Bornholm(Denmark)-Kalmar and back to Norrköping. Martin flew the flight to Göteborg and then it was my turn in the \"hot\" seat for the flight to Bornholm. We got vectors for an ILS (Instrument landing system) approach in Bornholm and the weather was bad. It was low clouds and rain so I could only see the runway just 100 feet before the minimum altitude before we had to make a go around! Great fun and great training, it's very different to fly a approach like that in real weather and not under a hod, as we normally do for training!\n\nEnroute towards Östersund FL100.\n\nJonas shoot from the landning in Östersund, seen here on short final runway 30.\n\nAfter a lunch in Bornholm we had a very uneventful flight back to Norrköping via Kalmar. We made an instrument approach in Kalmar and ended the day with a visual approach in Norrköping.\n\nWe had no flying the next day, it was all spent planing the next eight cross country flights and also to complete another written test on general questions about flight dynamics, laws of the air and so on with questions about minimas, flight dynamics etc so our instructor could see that we hadn't forgotten everything from the ATPL theory!\n\nIt was now time for a day that I had been looking forward to, flying home, to Östersund to be specific! I took the controls for the first flight, Norrköping to Östersund via Sveg where we made a GPS-approach before heeding further north! I had called Jonas the day before so he was waiting for as as we arrived and got some shoots of the landing! Then we heeded in to town together for some lunch before we continued our trip to Vasa, Finland, via Sundsvall. I flew the leg to Vasa, it was just an hour long flight but a nice one! After a short stop in Vasa it was Martins turn to fly the last leg back to Norrköping, a two hour long flight with some bad wether on the route! I took the time to rest after a long day of flying.\n\nClimbing out of Östersund on our way towards Sundsvall with the city in the background.\n\nEnroute from Östersund to Sundsvall.\n\nMartin at the controls on short final runway 27 at Norrköping after another long day.\n\nThen we spend the next few days training on flying with one engine, this was done in the area around Norrköping. We also had to make a VFR (Visual flight rules) flight around the area and land on different airports like Linköping and Skavsta as this is a part of the the skill test. It's one part of VFR flying and one part flying on Instruments.\n\nThen it was time for our last cross country flight before the skill test, we flew Norrköping-Bergen-Aalborg-Malmö and back to Norrköping. It was another long 12 hour day but it was fun! The first flight to Bergen was just beautiful! I flew the last flight from Malmö Sturup to Norrköping and this flight was very relaxed, the instructor know that we where ready and he could just sit back and relax!\n\nEnroute Norrköping-Bergen, beautiful scenery along the route.\n\nShort final runway 35 at Bergen.\n\nNow we only had three more days before the skill test, we started to get nervous and our instructor was drilling us like never before! We did everything that we ever had done during the training, and now we should know it all, no mistakes! My last flight the day before the skill test was horrible but I think the nerves did theirs! Then we stayed up late that last night going through everything and prepared our selfs as much as we could for the oral exam and the skill test!\n\nThe big day was here, the examiner arrived early and had a look on all my papers and everything was in order, time to fly! I was nervous that morning but once i sat in the airplane i cold of! I felt like home, I had been here every day for the last seven weeks! He asked me a few questions about the airplane and some emergency procedures and then it was time to go! I can't tell you everything about the skill test but we started of with the VFR-part, I got tested on my navigation skills, short landing, landing on one engine and so one! I made a few mistakes but i noticed them and corrected them. All was fine and I passed!\n\nCity of Allborg\n\nMe at the controls, climbing out on the instrument departure from Sturup. Got a direct routing so I hade to ad that in the GPS.\n\nThen after a two hour lunch it was time for the skill test for my instrument rating. Same here, I can't tell you to much but I had to prove that I could handle the plane in low speed, stall, steep turns, limited instrument (Incase something breaks during flight) etc flying only on the instruments. Then we turned back for some holdings, ILS-approaches, NDB and circling. ILS is a instrument landing system where you can basically fly the airplane down to the runway without seeing anything! NDB Is also a instrument landing system but with a lower precision so you have to be able to see the runway before you land. During this time i \"lost\" an engine to prove that I could handle the instrument flying on one engine as well.\n\nMe on short final 27 at Norrköping after a visual approach.\n\n\"I got my shit together\" so to speak, the flights weren't perfect but it was way better that the last flight the day before! The examiner did't have to much to say, only a few small things, as always! I don't think that anyone is flying perfect during a skill test! But It was no problems, no written remarks and I had passed this flight as well! I am now a commercial pilot with a multi-engine and instrument rating, I have been waiting years for this moment and now it is here! After years of hard work with the theory and getting everything together I am finally here! He signed the papers, shook my hand and handed my license over to me! What a feeling, probably the greatest feeling that I have ever felt!\n\nIt's been a long and hard road to ride but now I'm done! It still feels weird, I have been working for so long for this and now I'm done, I don't really know what to do now! The next big break is of course to find a job as a pilot and that is probably the hardest part but I'm not going to give up now!\n\nI just want to give a big thank you to everyone that has been with me through this, all my family and friend that has been there for me even during the tough times and all the time that I have spent away from home! And thanks to you readers of Osdphoto out there that has been so supportive as well and giving me good wishes along the way!\n\nOne happy guy at the airplane after passing my Skill test with my instructor to the right and the examiner to the left.\n\nI also would like to give a special thanks to my mother who passed away in cancer in 2006, she was my biggest supporter of all! I know that she isn't here today but she has helped me allot, she knew that I could do this and I know that she would be very proud over me right now! She struggled like no one other, she knew that she wasn't going to make it but she fought for it every day. I knew that if she could do that, then I could do this!\n\nSimon Brygg\n\nsimonbrygg@osdphoto.com"
