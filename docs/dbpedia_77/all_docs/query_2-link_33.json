        "text": "On the win\n\nI think we adapted quite well to the pitch. They were maybe a bit cautious at the start and we took advantage of it and took control of the game once we opened the scoring.\n\nAt 2-0 at half-time I think that it was important for us not to concede a goal and win the second half.\n\nIn the second half there was maybe room to score one or two more but we were in control and once we went 3-0 up we did not push on, and we won in a comfortable way.\n\nWill you rest players now in the second half ahead of the League Cup final?\n\nI don’t know. I will try to win the game again. Maybe I will rotate and play the players who didn’t play tonight and rest one or two players.\n\nOn Ostersund?\n\nI believe they played well. They didn’t give up and they continued to fight until the last minute.\n\nThe captain was impressive, he is a very good player, the little midfielder who came on as well. It’s a good side with a positive attitude in the game. I can understand now having seen them why they made so many good results in the Europa League.\n\nHow important was the penalty save?\n\nFor me it was important not to tarnish our performance tonight. We were a bit too easy in that situation and it would have left a bitter taste.\n\nBig names adapted well to the conditions\n\nThe risk at the start was that I didn’t know how tough the pitch would be for our players.\n\nWe have no game on the weekend so that was an easier decision. The only risk was injury, overall I am happy there was no problem. The pitch was quite good.\n\nOn Ainsley Maitland-Niles playing in central midfield\n\nIt’s his natural position. I think 80 per cent of his game was good. I feel he can win the ball back well.\n\nDefensively he is quite strong, he has good acceleration and can win ball back, it was a positive game for his first one.\n\nWould you like to see astroturf in the English league?\n\nNo. In England we have good groundsman with a big history. Personally I prefer grass. But I can understand in conditions like that it is better to have this kind of surface.\n\nOn Mkhitaryan\n\nHe has worked very hard, I think it was a positive performance. He adapts slowly to the team. He had a positive game tonight."
