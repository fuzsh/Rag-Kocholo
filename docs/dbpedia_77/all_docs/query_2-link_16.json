        "text": "This pleasant town by Storsjön lake, in whose chilly waters are said to lurk a rarely sighted monster, is a relaxed and scenic gateway town for further explorations of Norrland. It’s remote enough that if you are approaching by car, you can expect to see almost as many reindeer as cars.\n\nThe town dated from 1786 and was a lucrative trading center. Today, its appeal lies in its air of relaxation: in summer, people flock to the terrace bars and cafes of this Unesco-designated city of gastronomy or wander its pedestrianized shopping streets. One of the best ways to appreciate Östersund is to take the footbridge across to the adjacent island of Frösön and gaze back at the city in profile, ideally around sunset."
