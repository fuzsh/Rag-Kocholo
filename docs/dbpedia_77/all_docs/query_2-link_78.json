        "text": "Arsene Wenger had confirmed Petr Cech will miss Arsenal’s next to matches with David Ospina set to keep goal against Ostersunds and Manchester City.\n\nCech has started all 27 Premier League games Arsenal have played this season but his Colombian understudy has been used in the Cup competitions.\n\nOspina captained Arsenal for the first time during last week’s first leg win in Sweden and became the first Arsenal goalkeeper since Lukasz Fabianski in 2014 to save a penalty in normal time to help preserve a healthy 3-0 lead.\n\nThe 29-year-old will keep his place in the side for tomorrow’s second leg and at Wembley on Sunday as Arsene Wenger aims to win the League Cup for the first time.\n\n‘It’s always a difficult decision, but I’ve been clear about that from the start of the season,’ said Wenger.\n\n‘I have two world-class keepers.’\n\nSpeaking about Wenger’s decision, Cech said earlier this week: ‘I will be there with the team supporting but I don’t expect to play. It is always hard to watch any game from the bench or even from the stand if you are not selected.\n\n‘As a player you always want to be involved but obviously you are in a professional club where there are 25 top players and the manager always makes his choices for the game and you need to accept that.’"
