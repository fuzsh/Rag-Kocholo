        "text": "Ostersund manager Graham Potter may attract interest from his home nation of England when his side play Arsenal in the Europa League.\n\nSupporters of Ostersund cheer their team prior to the UEFA Europa League group J football match against Hertha BSC Berlin.\n\nMonday’s (December 11) Europa League last-32 draw sees Swedish minnows Ostersund face Premier League giants Arsenal.\n\nHowever, there is also a subplot to this tie as the Allsvenskan outfit are managed by the only English coach left in either this European competition or the Champions League – Graham Potter.\n\nOstersunds’ coach Graham Potter attends the UEFA Europa League group F football match against Athletic Bilbao.\n\nPotter has been receiving attention recently due to the remarkable job he has done in his first role in management, taking Ostersund from the fourth tier of Swedish football to the top flight since becoming boss in 2011.\n\nNot only that but the 42-year-old also won the club’s first major trophy in the Svenska Cupen earlier this year, which sealed their qualification for the Europa League, subsequently beating Galatasaray and PAOK in the playoffs on their way to the group stage.\n\nPotter’s side then topped their group to book their two-legged knockout clash with the Gunners and facing English opposition may make clubs from his home country take a serious look at the former Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion defender’s credentials.\n\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger.\n\nAs the Guardian pointed out in November when there were managerial vacancies at Everton, Sunderland and West Ham United, despite his success the ex-England Under-21 international was not even considered for any of them.\n\nMaybe a good showing against Arsene Wenger’s men will change all that next time a position becomes available."
