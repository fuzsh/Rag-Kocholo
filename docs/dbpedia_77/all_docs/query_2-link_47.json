        "text": "Arsenal travel to unfamiliar surroundings as they head to Sweden to face Ostersunds in the Europa League round of 32 first-leg this week.\n\nThe Europa League represents the Gunners’ best chance of qualifying for the Champions League next season after they succumbed to a disappointing defeat to Tottenham in the north London derby at the weekend.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette missed two late chances to rescue an unlikely draw for Arsene Wenger’s side however, the beleaguered striker, who was set to start in Europa League because Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is cup-tied, will now miss the next four to six weeks after undergoing a minor knee procedure.\n\nOstersunds were founded in 1996 – which is younger than Arsene Wenger’s rein at Arsenal – and are led by British manager, Graham Potter.\n\nWhat time is Ostersunds vs Arsenal kick-off?\n\nThe action gets underway at 6pm GMT on Thursday 15 February.\n\nWhat TV channel can I watch Ostersunds vs Arsenal?\n\nThe match will be televised live on BT Sport 3, with coverage starting from 5:30pm.\n\nBT Sport subscribers can stream the match online via the video player and the BT Sport app.\n\nTeam news\n\nArsene Wenger has said he will play a ‘normal team’ in the Europa League due to the fact that the club don’t have the FA Cup to contend with.\n\nWenger has played a weakened team in Europe’s second tier competition this term, giving his fringe and youth players game-time, however he has hinted that he will play a strong side as they do not have an FA Cup game at the weekend.\n\nHe said: ‘I will play the normal team because it’s one of the opportunities we have, especially because we don’t play in the [FA Cup] this season.\n\n‘There’s no reason why I should rest players.’\n\nBecause of Lacazette’s injury and Aubameyang’s ineligibility this could give the chance for Danny Welbeck to shine upfront.\n\nAaron Ramsey missed the north London derby with a groin injury and is unlikely to be risked for the tie.\n\nElsewhere, the likes of Rob Holding, Calum Chambers and Reiss Nelson could be pushing for a starting place too.\n\nWhat are the odds? (Courtesy of Betfair?)\n\nOstersunds – 11/2\n\nDraw – 18/5\n\nArsenal – 40/85\n\nMORE : Ian Wright ‘felt sorry’ for Arsenal new boy Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang during humbling Tottenham defeat"
