        "text": "Sqrtn Company AB®\n\nSqrtn stands for Swedish Quality Represent The North.\n\nSqrtn Company was founded in 2013 in the Northern part of Sweden in a small inland city called Östersund that is located in Jämtland. Today we are still a small company based in Östersund, Jämtland although we are growing each year. Our mission is to create high quality products for people that love the way of life in the North.\n\nWe are proud of our heritage and where we come from. We want to show the world that.\n\nAs a company we are working with four fundamental values that we strive to always deliver in all aspects.\n\n1 - Service\n\nWe strive to always have the best customer service possible.\n\n2 - Quality\n\nWe strive to deliver high quality products to all of our customers.\n\n3 - Sustainability\n\nWe strive, as a company, to stay as sustainable as one can be in the fashion industry. As of right now our goal is to have all of our production made in 100% environmentally friendly materials by 2026. We want our customers to buy for life. By purchasing high-quality goods that last longer, one can significantly reduce the carbon footprint.\n\n4 - Authenticity\n\nAs a brand we strive to stay authentic to our brand-dna and our customers. We only collaborate with ambassadors or retailers that fit in, in our fundamental values and our business concept.\n\nMore Detailed Information Below\n\nEconomic Responsibility\n\nWe put financial stability before growth and we assure our customers that we’re working hard to stay on the market for a very long time.\n\nOur employees are paid better salaries than the common collective agreement on the market in Sweden. All our freelance consultants are paid in terms of the market standard or better.\n\nWe have the company registered in Sweden and are proud to pay all our taxes and VAT in Sweden and contribute to our welfare society. We work with suppliers mainly in Europe and are proud to pay a higher production cost to get a high quality product. It’s important to us that the factory workers have good working conditions and that is why their work and their jobs go under one of the hardest regulations in the world made by the European Union.\n\nSustainability Responsibility\n\nAs a company working in the fashion industry we have a big responsibility to our future generations and our planet.\n\nWe have been working for several years to find a sustainable material for our clothing production and are proud that we in early 2019 made the change to produce 95% of all our clothing in 100% GOTS Certified cotton and recycled polyester. (See certificates below.) We’re still working on getting the 5% that are remaining sustainable. We produce all of our clothes in Europe (Portugal) and we visit the factories every year just make sure the standard of the environmental conditions and workers are maintained.\n\nOur accessories are produced in China, in a factory that we have been working with for more than 5 years. We visit the factories that we’re working with regularly, just to make sure their employees are taken care of and that the environmental conditions are met.\n\nWe work with packing materials that are environmentally friendly, recycled or recyclable. In support to save our planet we are working to ship as many deliveries as possible by SEA freight from the far East. We’re also working with Swedish freight companies, that are leading the development of sustainable transports. We aim to reduce our carbon footprint in all the things we do. From producing clothes to shipping them off to our customers.\n\nCivic Responsibility\n\nAs a company we are working to act and support the local communities, and as a way to support the civic society we only collaborate with people that are a part of of fundamental values. This includes local and national sport teams, schools and events.\n\nWe want to be company that the civic society and our customers can be proud of."
