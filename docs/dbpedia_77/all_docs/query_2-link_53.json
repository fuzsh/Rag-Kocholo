        "text": "Arsenal don't do things the easy way.\n\nThe Gunners had led 3-0 after the first leg through Nacho Monreal, a Sotiris Papagiannopoulos own goal and Mesut Ozil but that didn't happen second time around.\n\nPalestinian ace Hosam Aiesh broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute as he ran in behind before seeing his shot deflect off Calum Chambers and into the bottom corner past David Ospina.\n\nThe hosts needed to regroup, what happened instead was Ken Sema producing a wonder turn to embarrass Calum Chambers before thumping home 70 seconds later.\n\nThe most unlikely miracle seemed on- two minutes after half time it was off as Saed Kolasinac thrashed in a near post strike.\n\n1. Dead rubber no more\n\nOstersunds FK were ranked at 200/1 to qualified from the clash and the bookies would have been biting their finger nails when Aiesh and Sema found the Emirates net.\n\nThe men against minnows of the first leg was well and truly put to bed.\n\nThe 323 international appearances of Arsenal let slip what should have been a simple night. The nine caps of Ostersund showed that every dog has its day and there is no such thing as a dead rubber in the Europa league knockouts.\n\nWas it complacency or just naivety? Either way Kolasinac to the rescue despite the red faces.\n\n2. Who's in, who's out for Wembley?\n\nWenger went strong despite his 3-0 victory in the first leg, giving plenty of chances for his stars to earn their places in Sunday's Carabao Cup final.\n\nThe majority will now be hoping their boss overlooks their performances from the first half.\n\nWith Henrikh Mikhitaryan illegible for the final against Manchester City as well there is some tricky decisions for the Frenchman and sleepless nights in north London.\n\nNot playing tonight was probably better than playing.\n\nDanny Welbeck and Chambers are the two most in danger of missing out at Wembley.\n\n3. Europa League hasn't won over the Arsenal faithful...yet\n\nWith an upset the furthest thing from Gunners fans' mind there wasn't a bumper crowd in at the Emirates.\n\nThe attendance given was 58,405, and unless seat fancy dress was made compulsory only about half of those tickets sold were taken up.\n\nA long spell in the competition might still just about be on the cards and if they can reach the latter stages, and Champions League football is on the line, will that get the masses to stick their bums on the seats.\n\nPerhaps if the Emirates can be packed out there will become a legitimacy about the competition in north London.\n\n4. Sema-sational\n\nKen Sema is not a regular goalscorer in the Swedish league.\n\nIn fact he has only scored four times this season and just eight times in two seasons.\n\nBut his unbelievable twist to leave Chambers worrying about a P45 before his unstoppable thud under Ospina where he was something to lock away in the memory bank for the grandchildren.\n\nThe audacity to completely wrong foot the ex-Southampton man was off the scales.\n\n5. Chambers of secrets\n\nCalum Chambers proved once and for all he one for playing as part of two centre backs.\n\nEasily turned by Sema for the second and woefully out of position at other times he was a worry whenever the ball went near him.\n\nHis name on the team sheet sends shivers through Arsenal fans nowadays.\n\nA summer move away from the Emirates might be best for every party, allowing Chambers to reestablish his self-esteem and get some first team football, and give Wenger chance to have some real depth."
