        "text": "Graham Potter:\n\nPros :\n\nBefore I speak about his managerial career, I must mention the academics that Potter completed before leaping into his career in Football. He completed a master's in leadership and emotional intelligence at Leeds University, and put theory into practice with the school’s team.\n\nHe spent 5 years completing this degree. Potter cites this as a great time in his life where: “I could make my mistakes, develop with the students and players there. I also worked with the people at the university to put some concept and theory on my own experiences”.\n\nThis is a period where Potter grew in confidence, not only in football knowledge, but in speaking to others, how to relay a message, how to deal with personalities, and so on and so forth. This invaluable experience has become a cornerstone of his managerial career.\n\nReady for the next stage in his career, in December 2010, Potter signed a three-year contract as coach of Östersund, who were then playing in the fourth tier of Swedish football. Due to his pleasing style of play, Östersund won successive promotions in Potter’s first two years.\n\nAs a result, in 2013, the Jämtkraft Arena hosted football in the Superettan, Sweden’s second division, for the first time in the clubs history. In their first season, they finished tenth, before improving to fifth the next year. But then came even more unprecedented success.\n\nIn October 2015, Potter led them to the Allsvenskan, the Swedish top-flight, for the first time. For a club who had spent almost its entire life languishing in the lower reaches of the county’s football pyramid, this was incredibly uncharted territory.\n\nPromotion to Sweden’s top table was astonishing enough, but they more than held their own in the top division, finishing 8th in their first season in 2016. A finish in 5th and the club’s first major trophy followed in 2017, when they won the Swedish equivalent of the FA Cup.\n\nAlong with impressive European results, such as a 2-1 win against Arsenal at the Emirates, and a 2-0 win over Galatasaray, Potters stock rose. His tactical masterclass over the Turkish giants has been been broken down in one the youtube videos.\n\nHis time at the Swedish club had come to an end, and in June of 2018, Potter joined the Championship side Swansea City. Nothing too interesting came from this tenure, as he only completed one full season with the club, finishing 10th.\n\nAt Swansea, Potter used ten different formations and his team completed the most passes per 90 minutes in the Championship. But, he mostly deployed a 3-5-2. Here is an interesting quote from footballing mastermind, Marcelo Bielsa, who has become an admirer of Graham Potter.\n\nAfter Brighton dismissed Chris Hughton at the end of the 19/20 season, Potter joined on May 20, 2019, in order to have the summer to prepare with his new club. He was chosen for his “progressive and unconventional” coaching methods, which will be described in detail now.\n\nBefore I jump into it, I want to have a clear cut definition of xG, as it will be fundamental to my opinion on Potter. xG measures the quality of a chance based on:\n\n• the distance from the goal • the line of sight (if there’s defenders blocking) • the angle from the goal\n\nOn the xP (expected points) model, which is based off of xG results, Brighton would find themselves fourth in the PL. Now, i’m not suggesting that Brighton should be 4th, as there other factors to consider, but Brighton have been seriously underperforming with his system.\n\nI would describe Potter’s football as “totalitarian” as his three at the back formation is understood by every single player. There is a system in place to handle nearly every situation, and each player knows their role given a certain situation.\n\nOne common myth is that Potter’s side is poor defensively. This is simply not true, as they have only conceded 39 times in 34 games, which is only 1 less than Tottenham this season. Moreover, they concede the second least non-penalty xGA this season, only behind Man City\n\nPotter’s brand of expansive, proactive, and aggressive football may just be perfect for Tottenham. He is defensively sound, and has a system in place that maximizes chance creation. The final piece to his philosophy may just be world class finishers.\n\nCons :\n\nThe main reason what I think is a con is that Potter the man is stubborn. My favourite trait in a manager is the ability to adapt, use the players’ strengths to the team’s advantage and prepare for the opposition’s tactics. Now Potter doesn’t adapt, he believes too much in his philosophy.\n\nIf the opposition counters his tactics, he’ll not change, he’ll just keep the current approach and continue getting outplayed. Plus, he doesn’t adapt to his players’ strengths. If your STs can’t finish your chances, change the way your STs work so that they don’t weaken the team.\n\nI know I know, “if he had a better striker he’d be top 6”. Well, he doesn’t have that striker, that’s the point of being the manager of Brighton & Hove Albion. He needs to adapt, not just completely ignore this and continue fighting below mid table.\n\nManagers like Sean Dyche, David Moyes, Dean Smith and Roy Hodgson have all done better than Brighton with a squad with far less quality than Brighton’s. Hell, Dyche got Burnley to European football with a front two of Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes, Potter could never\n\nwhen/if he goes to a big club, Potter will do well at the start but when other teams start figuring him out they’ll destroy him. His lack of adaptability will always be a downfall of his IMO."
