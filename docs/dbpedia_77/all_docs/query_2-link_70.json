        "text": "Arsenal hold a commanding advantage heading into the second leg of their Europa League last-32 encounter with Ostersunds.\n\nArsene Wenger's side swept to a 3-0 victory over the Swedish minnows on the road, with a handy haul of away goals leaving them in the strongest of positions.\n\nNacho Monreal and Mesut Ozil were on target in that contest, while the unfortunate Sotirios Papagiannopoulos also put through his own net.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe Gunners have not been in action since that initial encounter, as a result of having suffered an early setback in the defence of their FA Cup crown, so should be fresh for a return to home soil at Emirates Stadium.\n\nTV Channel & Live Stream\n\nIn the United Kingdom (UK), the game can be watched live on TV on BT Sport 2 and it can be streamed live online using the BT Sport app.\n\nIn the United States (US), Fox Sports 2 is showing the game on television and it can be watched live online using WatchESPN or Fox Soccer Match Pass.\n\nSquads & Team News\n\nWenger is likely to suffle his pack with Arsenal in a healthy position and with a Carabao Cup final clash with Manchester City to come on Sunday.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang is cup-tied, Alexandre Lacazette nursing a knee injury and Aaron Ramsey facing a race against time to be fit for Wembley at the weekend.\n\nPotential Arsenal starting XI: Ospina; Chambers, Mertesacker, Holding, Kolasinac; Iwobi, Xhaka, Elneny, Nelson; Mkhitaryan; Welbeck.\n\nGraham Potter is likely to keep faith with those who battled bravely against the Gunners in the first leg.\n\nThe Swedish outfit are still without recent arrival Smajl Suljevic and midfielder Johan Bertilsson.\n\nPotential Osterdunds starting XI: Keita; Mukiipi, Papagiannopoulos, Pettersson, Widgren; Mensah, Edwards, Nouri, Sema; Gero, Ghoddos.\n\nBetting & Match Odds\n\nArsenal are considered to be strong favourites with dabblebet, with the Gunners priced at 2/7 to emerge victorious.\n\nOstersunds, meanwhile, are 8/1 outsiders and the draw is priced at 17/4.\n\nClick here to see all of dabblebet's offers for the game, including goalscoring markets, correct score predictions and more.\n\nMatch Preview\n\nGetty\n\nThe Europa League could soon take on added importance for Arsenal, given that they are once again struggling to force their way into the Premier League's top four.\n\nWenger is not about to throw in the towel just yet, but it could be that he is soon forced into adopting a similar mindset to Jose Mourinho and Manchester United from 2016-17.\n\nThe Red Devils switched their focus after slipping backwards domestically, with continental glory offering them a return ticket to the Champions League party.\n\nLike Arsenal, United also made their way to the League Cup final last season, with the securing of major silverware prioritised over league standings.\n\nThe Gunners could get their hands on that trophy this weekend, while progression in Europe would help to keep momentum building heading into a crucial period of the campaign.\n\nThere are still plenty of threats to be found in the Europa League, but a spot in the last-16 would edge the north London outfit one step closer to Lyon and leave them hoping for another favourable draw at the next stage."
