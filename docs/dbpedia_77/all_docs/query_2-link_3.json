It has a population of approximately 58,000 and is Sweden’s 21st largest city by population. The city has an almost Mediterranean atmosphere, with its location by the sea and its architecture. After a devastating fire in 1888 – the worst in Swedish history – the city was completely rebuilt in stone, after which Sundsvall was nicknamed Stenstaden (the Stone Town). Lining the broad avenues and beautiful squares of Sundsvall, some 600 buildings were completed in as little as six years, mirroring the continental stone-based architecture found in cities such as Vienna and Berlin. There is a lot to see and do in Sundsvall.
