        "text": "Educating Rita is 35 in 2015, and the Willy Russell play has remained in production somewhere in the world every year since it received its premiere at the RSC in London.\n\nLeanne Best and Con O’Neill are the latest in a long line of Rita and Franks, in Liverpool – where the story of the Scouse hairdresser keen to better herself, in Britain and across the globe.\n\nMeanwhile Rita has even been immortalised in the title of a poem by Roger McGough.\n\nHere are some of the other stars who have played the roles, on stage, radio and of course on film.\n\nRita\n\nJulie Walters (1980/1983)\n\nThe original ‘Rita’, Everyman alumnus Julie Walters premiered the role in the RSC production of 1980 at London’s Warehouse theatre and in the West End, before going on to play the character in the 1983 film, opposite Michael Caine as Frank.\n\nJulia Moody (1982)\n\nJulia Moody appeared in the Australian premiere of the show at The Hole in the Wall Theatre, Perth, in August 1982, opposite Andy King as Frank.\n\nAlexandra Pigg (1987)\n\nFresh from her success in city-filmed movie Letter to Brezhnev, actress Alexandra Pigg took on Rita duties at Liverpool’s Neptune Theatre.\n\nLaurie Metcalf (1987)\n\nIn 1987, Chicago’s famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company staged Educating Rita, with American actress Laurie Metcalf playing Rita. The production later moved to New York where it played at the off-Broadway Westside Arts Theatre.\n\nSarah Lancashire (1991)\n\nTV star Sarah Lancashire took the Rita role in this 1991 stage production at Hornchurch, directed by Bob Tomson and designed by Ruari Murchison. Hugo Myatt played Frank.\n\nAngela Clarke (2002)\n\nKirkby-born Angela Clarke took the title role in this 21st anniversary production at the Liverpool Playhouse in 2002, directed by former Everyman artistic director Glen Walford.\n\nWilly Russell revisited the text especially for the production, in order to bring some of the references up to date.\n\nRuth Jones (2006)\n\nWatching and Gavin and Stacey star Ruth Jones gave Rita a Welsh heart in this production at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff in 2006, when she appeared opposite fellow Welsh actor Steve Speirs.\n\nLaura dos Santos (2009/2010)\n\nEducating Rita had its first West End revival as part of the Willy Russell season at the Menier Chocolate Factory in spring 2010. Laura Dos Santos, who had previously played the working class crimper on radio, reprised the role on stage to acclaim.\n\nThe production later transferred to the Trafalgar Studios in London’s West End.\n\nClaire Sweeney (2012)\n\nLiverpool actress Claire Sweeney appeared in a revival of the play which toured the UK in 2012. Her Frank was played by former Everyman actor Matthew Kelly.\n\nGong Hyo Jin (2014)\n\nGong Hyo Jin was so emotional about playing Willy Russell’s heroine she cried during the thunderous applause that greeted her performance the opening night in the Korean capital Seoul.\n\nThe production runs until next month.\n\nFrank\n\nMark Kingston (1980)\n\nThe late Mark Kingston played opposite Julie Walters in the original production, directed by Mike Ockrent, which opened at the Warehouse theatre in London before transferring to the West End.\n\nTom Baker (1982)\n\nThe Liverpool-born former Doctor Who was the world-weary college tutor on this early UK tour for Rita, playing opposite Liverpool actress Kate Fitzgerald who had starred in the Playhouse premiere the year before.\n\nMichael Caine (1983)\n\nThe most famous ‘Frank’ by dint of playing him on the big screen, British film icon Michael Caine appeared opposite Julie Walters in the 1983 hit movie.\n\nAndrew Sachs (1987)\n\nFawlty Towers’ star Andrew Sachs appeared opposite Alexandra Pigg in a North Bank Productions version of the play which was staged at Liverpool’s Neptune Theatre.\n\nRichard O’Callaghan (2002)\n\nRichard O’Callaghan, whose credits include everything from Carry On to Red Dwarf, played Frank in the 21st anniversary Liverpool Playhouse production opposite Angela Clarke.\n\nTim Bentinck (2009)\n\nBentinck appeared as Frank and Claire Lams as Rita in a production at the Watermill Theatre in Berkshire, and wrote a blog of the highs and lows of getting to grips with Willy Russell’s iconic story.\n\nBill Nighy (2009)\n\nAnother Everyman alumnus, Bill Nighy took on the role of lecturer Frank for a Radio 4 drama, playing opposite Laura Dos Santos as part of the Christmas 2009 schedules.\n\nLarry Lamb (2010)\n\nLarry Lamb bowed out of EastEnders and straight into Educating Rita to take his role in the 2010 Menier Chocolate Factory revival of the play.\n\nMatthew Kelly (2012)\n\nWilly Russell updated his script once again for this 2012 version of Educating Rita, where Matthew Kelly appeared opposite Claire Sweeney. A year later, Kelly was back on stage playing another inspirational teacher – Hector in The History Boys.\n\nPhilip Bretherton (2013)\n\nPhilip Bretherton, who played Frank opposite Liverpool’s Gillian Kearney in this production at Home in Manchester, was an English student at Manchester University in the 70s, but wasn’t drawn on whether he based his character on any of his old lecturers."
