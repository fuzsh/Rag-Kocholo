        "text": "Choice Radio Worcester\n\nOne of Willy Russell's plays seems to come around with great regularly - Blood Brothers - whilst another sits quietly remembered as a film. So it's with great pleasure to see that Educating Rita is currently on tour and visiting Malvern this week. But who could possibly take the roles played in the film version by Michael Caine and Julie Walters?\n\nStep forward Stephen Tompkinson and Jessica Johnson as professor and student in a two-hander played out on a single set representing Frank's office-cum-lecture room, chock full of the books of his profession but which also conceal his hidden secret.\n\nWhen Rita - a hairdresser - visits the professor for an Open University interview, Frank is somewhat non-plussed. What can he possibly do for her in terms of her desire to \"learn everything\"? Especially as he is in a job which he is doing only for the extra money and not for the love it. Rita's desire to learn about and be confident in talking about poetry and literature spurs him on to take this student seriously until the time when she effectively no longer needs him. But the path to getting there is littered with difficulties - a dislike of fellow students, problems at home, the hidden bottles of whisky, the extent of which only comes to light at the very end...\n\nRussell's skill as a scriptwriter is clear in the show, as it is dependent purely on the interaction between the two characters and how this relationship changes over the two hours. And very funny it is too as it is made up of smaller set pieces as time moves on rather than a continuous story with only an interval.\n\nJessica Johnson is excellent as the Scouser wanting to better herself and Stephen Tompkinson is perfect as the professor, slipping very comfortably into the role with his characteristic hangdog facial expressions, looking the part of a college professor and thoroughly believable in his corduroy jacket with his unkempt hair. In fact, he is that convincing that you could easily believe that the part was written for him.\n\nThis is his second visit to Malvern this year as he was previously here in the production of Art. And judging by the response of the audience, he will be made very welcome in his next show.\n\nAnd we can all learn something from the play too - never forget that \"Assonance is getting the rhyme wrong\"!\n\nColin\n\nBrilliant! This was outstanding at so many levels. Of course, there's the excellent humorous moments but the superb performances by Stephen Tomkinson and Jessica Johnson bring out so much more: Willy Russell's insights into the position of women and how women talk about it; the development of characters and the relationship between the two people; the effect that her education has on Rita's outlook on life. For me, the way in which it shows how she is educated and how literary criticism changes her abilities to think for herself is so well presented that every English student should see this production. The costumes were great; the set just right; the subtlety of the moves from scene to scene contributed so well to the pace - I was absorbed from start to finish!"
