        "text": "Daybill Poster.Educating Rita is a British 1983 drama/comedy film directed by Lewis Gilbert with a screenplay by Willy Russell based on his 1980 stage play. The film stars Michael Caine, Julie Walters, Michael Williams and Maureen Lipman. It won multiple major awards for best actor and best actress and was nominated for three Academy Awards. Caine and Walters both won BAFTA and Golden Globe awards for best actor and actress. Lewis Gilbert says it was difficult to raise finance for the film. \"Columbia wanted me to cast Dolly Parton as Rita\". The film was shot in Dublin. Trinity College, Dublin, is used as the setting for the university, and University College Dublin, in Belfield, Dublin, is used for Rita's summer school. The British Film Institute ranked Educating Rita the 84th greatest British film of the 20th century"
