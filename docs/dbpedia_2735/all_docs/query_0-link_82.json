        "text": "At 65 Julie Walters is a national treasure – a double Oscar-nominated actress popular with public and critics alike. But inside she often still feels a frightened little girl who can never be good enough.\n\nThe star of Educating Rita and Calendar Girls believes her career has been fuelled by a lifelong desire for the praise she was denied by her pushy mum.\n\n“There’s definitely that need for love and approval,” says Julie. “There are moments when I think, ‘I’m not good enough’.\n\n“It’s always there. The three- or 10-year-old in you can come to the surface. I was a frightened little person in many ways.”\n\nJulie’s Irish mother Mary, who had moved to the Midlands and married builder Thomas Walters, had big ambitions for her family.\n\nHer two sons became teachers and at 18, Julie started train­­ing to be a nurse after private schooling. But within 18 months she’d quit and furious Mary said she’d be in the gutter by 20.\n\n“I did challenge her,” says Julie. “I said, ‘Why were we never good enough?’ And she said, ‘I wanted you to be competitive.’\n\nAnd I said: ‘Well, we just felt inadequate’. She just felt that SHE wasn’t good enough – she was an immigrant.”\n\nAfter studying English and drama in Manchester, where she met her pal Victoria Wood, Julie worked at Liverpool’s Everyman Theatre alongside Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite and Jonathan Pryce.\n\nHer mother refused to watch her early roles and it was only after she died in 1989 that Julie discovered her mum had kept newspaper clippings charting her career.\n\nShe first became known for TV comedy sketches with Victoria – they later created soap-opera spoof Acorn Antiques – but her breakthrough was the 1983 film Educating Rita, with Michael Caine.\n\nAs a working-class lass from Smethwick, Birmingham, Julie identified with her role as a bright girl from a similar background.\n\nTalking during a one-on-one chat with Richard E Grant to be shown on BBC Four this Sunday, Julie says: “I can still remember Michael saying: ‘There’s a lot of anger in you’.\n\n“And he was right, there was a bit of a chip on my shoulder.”\n\nThe role won Julie an Oscar nomination and the first of five BAFTAS – then she was offered a part by Burt Reynolds. She politely declined, but did visit his home in Florida, only to get drunk and embarrass herself.\n\nShe explains. “There’d been a TV interview with Burt and Dolly Parton. She said, ‘We have two things in common – we both have 40 inch chests and we both wear wigs’ and Burt hadn’t liked this.\n\n“Your eyes do want to keep going up to the thatch. Anyway, we sat down for dinner and it just came out: “WIG!” I had to turn that into “WE’RE Going to Los Angeles!”\n\nThen she played brothel keeper Cynthia Payne in the 1987 film Personal Services.\n\n“The first time I met her was in a very posh restaurant,” says Julie. “In comes Cynthia and she never even said hello, she just said, ‘Do you like sex, Julie?’ And I said, “Well, it depends who it’s with.’\n\n“Then out come these photographs... people in all sorts of eyewatering poses. She said, ‘That’s my bank manager’ And I said, ‘What’s that all over him?’ And she says: “Hoover dust. That’s what he likes.’ ”\n\nIn 2000 she played the dance teacher in Billy Elliott and won a second Oscar nomination.\n\nJulie, who has one daughter, Maisie, was going through the menopause while filming.\n\n“I was hot flushing constantly,” she says. “The steps were so fast and the choreographer didn’t smile once. I only did one sequence all the way through.”\n\nIn 2003’s Calendar Girls, she was one of a WI gang posing naked for charity.\n\n“Everybody was scared stiff,” she says. “So Helen Mirren brought champagne in and we all got plastered the night before.”\n\nIn 2008 Julie was awarded the CBE and starred in the Abba musical Mamma Mia! alongside Meryl Streep.\n\n“It was so intimidating because I’d grown up with her and revered her,” says Julie. “Then suddenly you’re working next to her, talking about colds and the menopause.”\n\nIn 2011 she made her last appearance after 10 years playing Molly Weasley, mother of Ron, in the Harry Potter film series.\n\n“It wasn’t a very big part, but it was going in every year to the same group of people. I just loved it and it’s rare you have that kind of structure in your life as an actor.”\n\nLast year Julie, who lives with her husband Grant Roffey on a farm in West Sussex, was awarded a BAFTA Fellowship.\n\n“I did imagine stopping when I reached 60,” she says. “My hair was white and there was something about that and turning 60.\n\n“Then suddenly a script came from the National Theatre and I thought, ‘Oh this is marvellous... obviously I haven’t finished.”\n\nJulie has been back on TV this year in Channel 4’s Indian Summers. She plays a hostess in the age of the British Raj.\n\n“I’m going to do the second series,” she says. “There are so many things I don’t want to do and I feel it’s all right not to do them. But Indian Summers made me say, ‘Oh I’d like to do that.’”"
