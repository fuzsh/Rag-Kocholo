        "text": "Stephen Tompkinson stars in the 2021 Summer tour of Willy Russell's Educating Rita. The tour opens in Southampton on 20 July.\n\nVIEW TOUR DATES\n\nDavid Pugh has announced the Shirley Valentine Summer tour 2021 starring Stephen Tompkinson as Frank, and introducing Jessica Johnson as Rita, directed by Max Roberts.\n\nEducating Rita tells the story of married hairdresser Rita, who enrols on an Open University course to expand her horizons and her encounters with university tutor Frank. Frank is a frustrated poet, brilliant academic and dedicated drinker, who is less than enthusiastic about teaching Rita. However, Frank soon finds that his passion for literature is reignited by Rita, whose technical ability for the subject is limited by her lack of education, but whose enthusiasm Frank finds refreshing. The two soon realise how much they have to learn from each other.\n\nStephen Tompkinson and Jessica Johnson in Educating Rita UK Tour.
