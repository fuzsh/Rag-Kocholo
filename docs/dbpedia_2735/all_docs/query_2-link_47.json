        "text": "This doughty drama about class and education, made famous on screen by Julie Walters and Michael Caine, was one of the first shows to return to the live stage after national lockdown. Now it reopens the Rose, where the audience welcomes Scouse hairdresser Rita and her booze-soaked Open University tutor Frank like old friends.\n\nThere’s much in Willy Russell’s ‘Pygmalion’-ish 1980 two-hander that still resonates, notably an exasperation with the ways in which formal education encourages intellectual conformity, and an implicit condemnation of the social and economic inequalities that in turn lead to inequality of opportunity. If anything, that situation has worsened: at least when Russell wrote it, students were entitled to a grant. But the play is inescapably showing its age. Its depiction of the teacher-pupil dynamic, with a wide-eyed young woman at the feet of a raddled middle-aged bloke, feels uncomfortable, even in a period piece. While the learning process is ultimately two-way, Rita’s gaffes and naivety mean that the jokes are mostly on her, and the tone is faintly patronising.\n\nYet this is a likeable 40th anniversary production by Max Roberts, with Stephen Tompkinson bringing nuance to the bilious Frank, and Jessica Johnson delivering a flawed but fresh turn in a role so indelibly associated with Walters. Holed up in a cosy, book-lined study designed by Patrick Connellan, where half-empty whisky bottles are stashed among the literary tomes, Tompkinson is worn and wiry, with wild grey hair. Soured by drink, defeat and disappointment, he has an acrid, etiolated quality; he’s slightly pathetic, and given to bouts of vicious nastiness. Teaching Rita is a sideline purely to fund his drinking habit – and he initially dismisses her as “some silly woman”. Even as he warms to her, making her his pet project, he’s often cruelly dismissive. Tompkinson doesn’t flinch from Frank’s wounded vanity, jealousy or spite – or from his fear at his own encroaching irrelevance.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, arrives giving off sparks of nervous energy, concealing her sense of inadequacy with breathless gabble and teasing humour: when Frank asks Rita if she’s familiar with Yeats, and she innocently replies, “yeah, yeah, the Wine Lodge”, you wonder whether she’s pulling his leg. There is a problem, and that’s the Sunderland-born actor’s attempt at a Liverpool accent, which is dangerously distracting. But Johnson also touchingly captures Rita’s hunger, her thrill at the new vistas of possibility she glimpses before her. And this is overall a solid staging, intelligently directed and performed; plenty will be happy to learn its lessons once again."
