        "text": "Lost count of the amount of times I've seen this since I first clapped eyes on it as a teenager in my bedroom when BBC1 broadcast one Friday night in 1995 (thanks BBC Genome).\n\nIt is arguably the film that gave me two things, my appreciation of Michael Caine (still my favourite movie star) and my appreciation of theatre. The latter developed because I went to my local library and found a book of Willy Russell's play off the back of seeing the film, and I was surprised to see that the play only features two characters, Rita and Frank, and one room! I was amazed I think that theatre could be so contained and yet still deliver the core message. I've since been fortunate to see a revival at the Liverpool Playhouse, effectively where it all started, with Leanne Best as Rita and Con O'Neill as Frank and on both stage and screen Russell's play is an inspiration.\n\nLike I say, I'm a big fan of Caine but I'd be the first to accept that, as all movie stars do, he plays a familiar persona across most of his roles with subtle variations to occasionally separate them. Breaking through in the 1960s, he established his persona in landmark films like The Ipcress File, Alfie and The Italian Job. He flexed his acting muscles with Get Carter and the much lesser known The Last Valley as the sixties stopped swinging but, for much of the 70s, he was content to play those variations. Reuniting with Alfie director Lewis Gilbert gave him the opportunity to act against type once more, and he's a revelation as the tragicomic drunken academic Frank Bryant, a man whose stultifying existence is given a shot in the arm by the all too real Rita, only to find it ebbing away as she takes his knowledge to secure the life and opportunities that have previously alluded her. He didn't just deserve the Oscar nomination that year, he deserved the Oscar itself.\n\nAnd then there's Julie Walters. Then best known for her double act with Victoria Wood, if she's nervous about starring opposite an A lister like Caine in a big movie, she doesn't show it. Like Caine was in the 60s, she's a breakout star and has gone on to become one of our most respected stars and a national treasure.\n\nThank God Hollywood didn't get their way and set it in America with Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton!"
