        "text": "“Of course I’m drunk. You don’t expect me to teach this when I’m sober?” Dr. Frank Bryant\n\nFrank Bryant is an alcoholic Professor of English Literature whose partner is having an affair with the University Dean and who is entirely disillusioned with his profession. Rita is a young hairdresser attempting to get an education before giving in to the demands of her husband to have a baby. When she enrols in an Open University course and Frank is assigned as her tutor they build an unlikely friendship.\n\nCaine has often been quoted referring to Educating Rita as his best film and best role. It isn’t too difficult to see why as it really is a beautiful piece of work. It’s an incredibly warm and heartfelt film that manages to avoid slipping into over sentimentality or schmaltz. It’s at times heartbreaking at others uplifting and often laugh out loud funny. It is the second Caine film in succession to be adapted from a stage play, but while Deathtrap relied heavily on a series of extravagant twists and turns Educating Rita is a much more grounded and subtle effort. Willy Russell’s original play was a two hander featuring just Frank and Rita and while the screenplay expands to add a wider range of character there is nonetheless never any doubting who the key figures are. The relationship between Frank and Rita is the heart and soul of the film and so beautifully written and performed is their friendship that no added gimmicks are required.\n\nCaine and Julie Walters both received Oscar nominations for their performances as Frank and Rita and it is impossible to imagine two actors more perfectly inhabiting their roles. Walters gives an absolute powerhouse of a performance and while we are accustomed to her brilliance these days it is all the more impressive given this was her first film role having previously played the part in the stage production. She is a force of nature from her very first entrance into Frank’s office and Walter’s pitches her performance to perfection. Caine has always raised his game when handed a genuine talent to play off and Educating Rita is no different.\n\nBoth characters are eminently believable and though enormously different people their friendship also feels real as they each offer the other an escape from the cul-de-sac of their lives. Frank has been trapped by a profession he no longer has any love for and a relationship that is failing. He has become fatigued by the homogeneity of academic students and has never recovered from his wife leaving him. As a result he drinks far too much and frustrates both his students and employers alike. When Rita comes along he is initially reluctant to start tutoring her, but he quickly begins to see her as a breath of fresh air. Her take on literature is uncluttered by years of academic structuring and is much more raw and emotional, which Frank finds utterly charming. Caine showcases this brilliantly and the joy in his eyes and the constant smile that seems to spread across his face in her company is warming. It is perhaps best showcased in the way he repeats Rita’s spontaneous simple and yet accurate definition of assonance to first the University Dean and then his students having been utterly charmed by it. His relationship with Rita doesn’t stop him from drinking completely, but it does offer him a different kind of escape and one that he welcomes with open arms.\n\nRita is equally desperate for an opportunity to escape. She sees getting an education as a way to better herself having become increasingly dissatisfied with the direction her life is taking. Her husband Denny is determined for her to have a baby and is distrustful of anything that takes her away from that end. Similarly her father is pressurising her to fall into a role as wife and mother with no other prospects. When she arrives at Frank’s office door she is fully aware of just how out of place she seems, but is determined to go ahead anyway. Crucially though Rita isn’t academic she is never portrayed as stupid. She does refer to herself in those terms on occasions, but Frank quickly rebuffs her and the audience are certainly always on his side of that argument. Instead she is shown to have an insightful and almost innocent intelligence that feels very raw and to Frank incredibly exciting. As she becomes more and more engaged in her studies she drifts further away from Denny and her previous life and she finds herself increasingly isolated from everybody except Frank. When he invites her and Denny to attend a dinner party at his home she reluctantly agrees. Denny however refuses and insists they go down the pub to see her family as usual. Rita decides to go to the dinner party alone, but when she sees the other attendees dressed in their finery standing around chatting she gets cold feet and heads to the pub instead. There she sits in silence while everyone around her joins in with songs from the jukebox and has a merry old time. It’s a brilliantly played scene by Walters and beautifully realised by the always wonderful Lewis Gilbert in the directors chair emphasising that Rita no longer feels a part of her life at home and yet also isn’t comfortable in the more formal side of academia.\n\nThat scene is crucial in driving Rita further with her studies. She doesn’t see a way back to her old life and ultimately when Denny asks her to choose between him and her studies she has little doubt about her decision. Seeing that world cut off to her she throws herself into not just her studies, but the concept of academia. She writes an essay on MacBeth that Frank enjoys, but he is forced to describe as “academically worthless” and despite his protestations that it has value in its own right and that it is the system that is wrong not her understanding she rips it up and demands he teach her how to write like all the other students. It is once again an absolutely beautifully written and performed scene. Russell’s script is so well developed that the characters motivations are never anything other than genuine even if they may seem misguided. Not for the last time in the film Caine gives a subtly heartbreaking performance as he comes to terms with the realisation that he is being asked to lessen some of the more idiosyncratic aspects of her personality so that she can pass her exams when they were the very things that drew him to her in the first place.\n\nThat heartbreak continues as Rita heads off to summer school and a full-time academic life. The film uses a series of letters she sends to Frank to tell that part of her life and it is once again beautifully shot. Walters is incredible as she gains the strength to stand up in a packed lecture hall and ask the tutor a question and we see the flowering of her confidence in her own intellect. Frank on the other hand is filled with joy by the letters, but finds a very different Rita when she returns. She is now in full academic mode and as a consequence he feels like he has been left behind. Most heartbreaking for him is the realisation that she has studied the poetry of Blake while away when he had been specifically saving him for when she returned. He has a real desire to hear her uncomplicated dissection of Blake’s work, but instead finds that her raw take on things has been replaced by a still intelligent, but more academically standard take on his poetry. His response when asked what he thinks of Rita’s essay is a beautifully subtle indication of how their motivations have drifted apart from each other. “It wouldn’t look out of place with these” as he gestures to his other students work is a response that fills Rita with joy as she sees it as an acceptance into a world she desires to join while he sees it as a loss of a unique mind and a move towards homogenous academia. It drives Frank further away from Rita and more heavily to drink as his partner also finally leaves him for the Dean.\n\nIn a poorer film Rita and Frank would ultimately walk hand in hand into the sunset and spend the rest of their lives together. Instead although there is a definite happy ending it once again has a much more genuine believability about it. Both Rita and Frank are flawed in different ways. As Frank’s alcoholism spirals out of control he falls into a spiral of self-pity and has moments of real nastiness towards Rita. While she on the other hand finds herself besotted by the idea of her new life and needs a jolting experience to remember that a knowledge and understanding of culture doesn’t immune anybody to the problems life can throw at you. They are flaws that both can admit and in the end are able to acknowledge the immense impact they have both had on each other’s lives and thank each other. The final scene as Frank leaves for a two-year spell in Australia thanks to a particularly severe drunken episode is subtly played, but a very satisfying denouement nonetheless. It’s another example of the class of Russell’s writing, which I really can’t praise highly enough.\n\nWhich brings me back to the performances of Caine and Walters. They really are magnificent and along with Russell’s script create two of the most rounded characters you are ever likely to see on screen. There is a scene when Rita sprints all the way to the university and interrupts one of Frank’s lectures simply to tell him that she had been to see MacBeth in the theatre and how much she had loved it. It’s a scene that with a marginally less well-written script and a couple of flashier performances I can easily imagine rolling my eyes at. Instead it is utterly charming and very moving. Walters is wonderful and Caine’s quiet, but heartfelt response equally so. It’s a lovely scene that in different hands could have been something much less appealing.\n\nI’ve focused mostly on the character and plot development and the more dramatic elements so far, but it is worth stating that Educating Rita is an extremely funny film. Caine plays an absolutely brilliant drunk and while the scenes of Frank out of control have a real sadness to them they are also undeniably very funny. His attempt to give a lecture that ends with him unable to stand is a brilliant performance and ends with what is perhaps Caine’s only delivery of his famous “not a lot of people know that” line on screen. That it is followed so quickly by a scene of him drunkenly dancing in a nightclub is a pure joy. Possibly my favourite running joke though comes from the Dean’s reaction any time Frank comes into a room. With the Dean engaged in an affair with Frank’s partner his way of avoiding any questions as to why they are together and to deflect the attention is to grab the telephone and pretend to be talking to his publisher. This happens on numerous occasions until it is finally scuppered when Frank reveals he hasn’t paid the phone bill and he has been cut off. It’s a lovely moment that is only made better when the affair is revealed and Frank approaches his partner shakes her hand and wishes her “better luck next time.”\n\nWith Caine and Walters so dominant on screen there is limited opportunity for many other actors to make an enormous impact. Michael Williams gives a nice little performance as the Dean, but it is really Maureen Lipman who is the star of the supporting cast. She plays Trish an enormous character whose flat Rita moves into after returning from summer school. At first glance Trish seems a little out of place in the more grounded down to earth world of Educating Rita. She is an extreme character who almost threatens to drift into a caricature of a certain type of posh culture obsessed individual. That changes when it becomes clear she has been putting on a performance for the world and her real life is much darker than it could have been imagined. Lipman has relatively limited screen time, but nonetheless does brilliantly to bring the two elements together and gives a genuinely powerful performance. The other star of the show is Director Lewis Gilbert. I am a huge fan of his work and he was an absolutely perfect choice to bring Russell’s work to life. He has a subtlety about his direction that is ideally suited to Educating Rita. Of course this isn’t the first time he has featured in this blog and there are similarities to his previous work on Alfie. Both feature urban landscapes into which Gilbert injects a real understated beauty. While he may not be as flashy as some more high profile directors Gilbert’s work was consistently of a very high quality and he deserves to be considered among the finest Director’s of his generation.\n\nI found this entry on Educating Rita particularly challenging to write. That is mostly because there is so much packed into it that I absolutely love, but could also be analysed to the nth degree. I’m happy to leave that to others though and suffice to say that I believe it to be a genuinely brilliant piece of work. Despite it’s very 80’s fashion and synth soundtrack (one of the few missteps the film makes for me) it manages to still feel incredibly modern given its strong, independent and empowered female lead, something still distressingly rare in modern cinema. There really is so much to enjoy about Educating Rita and it is a film that bares repeated viewings. Funny, warm and full of charm I can fully understand why Caine himself rates it so highly."
