Its important results have induced a recent English author to class it, preeminently, among the Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World'.\n\n__________________\n\n1 Nor can any military event be said to have exercised more important influence on the future fortunes of mankind than the complete defeat of Burgoyne's Expedition in 1777; a defeat which rescued the revolted colonifts from certain subjection, and which, by inducing the courts of France and Spain to attack England in their behalf, insured the independence of the United States, and the formation of that transatlantic power which not only America, but both Europe and Asia now see and feel. â Creasy, p. 312, Am. ed.\n\n______________\n\nIn our own country, its name still stirs the blood, warmly and proudly, in the popular heart. The interest that thus attaches to the subject has led to the publication of numerous official, and other Documents, relating to the Expedition of Burgoyne, and its unsuccessful termination. The Publisher feels that he cannot err, in the opinion that that interest will yet justify an addition to our authentic printed memorials of these events; and, in that belief, he takes much pleasure in laying before the Publick the Orderly Book of General Burgoyne' s Expedition.\n\nThe Leader of this memorable Expedition has published to the World his Narrative of the Invasion, and his Apology or its failure. The present official programme of his daily movements, daguerreotyping, as it were, the occurrences and events of the march, almost makes us spectators of the changing scene. We look not through media, colored by the incense of partiaity, or darkened by the smoke of prejudice, but, viewing these events of the past in their own truthful light, we are enabled to exercise our individual judgment, and form conclusions altogether our own. The very nature of an Orderly Book, its slrictly practical, almost commonplace character, gives a peculiar trustworthiness to the opinions formed from its perusal : and in cases like the present one, whether the verdct be of approval or of censure, we cannot doubt that it is both unbiassed and just.\n\nIn addressing. Sir, to you, the following pages, the Publisher would desire to make a public acknowledgment of his thanks for the interesl: you have shown in bringing this subject to his notice; and likewise for the many kind offices which a library rich in varied treasures of genius and art, a discriminating taste and profound historical research, have enabled you to render, in the course of his publication of books kindred to this in their antique style and historical subject.\n\nJ. M.\n\nAlbany, Oct. i860.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nIn presenting to the Public a volume containing mainly Orders issued from day to day, to an Army on its march, some apology may be deemed proper, were it not that the interests involved in the march of that Army were of such vast magnitude as not only to justify, but to exact the preservation of every record, however trivial and minute, of every well established incident and circumstance connected with its progress and operations.\n\nThe people of the Colonies had already been two years arrayed in hostility against England; the Declaration of Independence had been nearly twelve months before the world, yet so far from decided was the result of the contest, that no Court in Europe dared as yet to acknowledge that Independence, or to risk a Treaty with America.\n\nIt was at this season of gloom, uncertainty and doubt, when many good men already hesitated, and some had even despaired, that Great Britain gathered up her strength afresh, evoked her power at home and exerted her influence abroad, for one combined and overwhelming movement that would, she promised herself, forever crush the giant nation struggling to be born.\n\nAs Commander of the Northern Division of this movement, the ministry had selected an officer who had already distinguished himself in the field; whose merit, they admitted, it had been their care to cherish; discovering it in its growth and rewarding it in its progress by raising him above his seniors in the service.1\n\n________________\n\n1 Speech of Lord North. Hansard's Par. Hist., xix, 1222.\n\n________________\n\nJohn Burgoyne, the Officer in question, was a man not only of obscure birth, but even of doubtful parentage. He is said, upon what authority does not appear, to have been the illegitimate son of Lord Bingley. Be this as it may, his education was of the most liberal kind, and it is not improbable that he was either destined for, or had resolved upon, the profession of arms, at a very early period. While yet a subaltern, without any fortune but his sword, he had the rare good luck to engage the affections of, and run away with, Lady Charlotte Stanley, youngest daughter of Edward, l0th Earl of Derby, whom he married. This connexion secured doubtless for Burgoyne in after life, much of that favour to which his advancement in his profession was owing. He was commissioned Captain in the 11th Dragoons,14th June, 1756; and on the 10th of May, 1758, was raised to the brevet rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In the August of 1759, appointed Lieutenant Colonel commandant of the 16th Light Dragoons. With this regiment he served in 1761, at Belleisle, where, during the siege of Palais, he was entrusted with a negotiation for an exchange of prisoners.\n\nA more busy service awaited him upon his return home. Spain had now acceded to the family compact, and after vain endeavours to draw over Portugal from its alliance with England, had refolved to attack that country in the hope of an easy conquest : a hope which arofe from her convidtion of the weak and undisciplined state of the Portuguese army. In this exigency Great Britain hastened to the succour of an ally, who had preferred the chance of utter ruin to the shame of having violated her faith.\n\nThe troops destined for this service arrived in the Tagus on the 6th of May. They were immediately marched to join the Portuguefe army, under the command of the Count de la Lippe Buckeburg, and took the field in the course of July. The campaign had been commenced by the Spaniards on the side of Tras os Montes, in which province Miranda, Braganza, and some other towns, had fallen into their hands. They next resolved to proceed against Oporto, but this design was frustrated by the bravery of the peasants, who took possession of the defiles, and compelled the Spanish army to a disorderly retreat. Disappointed in this quarter the enemy turned their steps towards the province of Beira, and laid siege to the frontier town of Almeida, which, after a short defence, fell into their hands through the imbecility and cowardice of its governor. Their army now approached the Tagus, the only direction in which an invader can penetrate to the capital, all other access being rendered nearly, if not quite impracticable, by immense chains of mountains, and other natural obstructions.\n\nTo second the operations of this army, by an incursion into Alemtejo, or by advancing on the opposite side of the Tagus, and thus to distract the attention of the Portuguese, already but too feeble in point of numbers, a body of troops was beginning to assemble in Spanish Estramadura, at the town of Valencia de Alcantara. It consisted at present of about 1200 men. Well knowing that if this force were suffered to increase, it would embarrass him very confiderably, the Count de la Lippe, who was encamped at Abrantes, formed the bold design of attacking and dispersing it before it assumed a more formidable aspect.\n\nThe execution of this plan was confided to Burgoyne, who then held the rank of Brigadier. No inconsiderable difficulties stood in the way of this enterprise; but the spirit of the commander was not of a nature to be depressed by such considerations. He crossed the Tagus, at midnight on the 23d, and with 400 of his own regiment, was joined as he advanced by one or two small detachments, and after a laborious march of more than fifteen leagues, performed through bad roads, and without halting, he arrived on the morning of the 26th at some distance from the town of Alcantara. His intention had been to surprise the place before break of day, but he now found that from the delay, occasioned by the ignorance of the guides, the dawn was at hand, and his scheme would be frustrated if he waited till his whole division could cooperate in the attack. He, therefore, boldly pushed forward with his dragoons alone. This audacity was favoured by fortune. At the head of his handful of soldiers he entered the town with such determined resolution, that the guards in the square were all killed or made prisoners before they could take arms, and the ends of the streets were secured after a trifling resistance. Some parties, having rallied, attempted to return to the charge; but their lives paid the forfeit of their temerity. A firing was for a Ihort time kept up from the windows. It was, however, put a flop to, by the menace of fetting the town in flames, at the four corners, if the doors and windows were not instantly thrown open. Parties were immediately sent out to pursue such of the enemy as had escaped into the country, and in this service their success was very considerable.\n\nIn this gallant action the lofs of the English was scarcely worthy of notice; while on the other hand, that of the Spaniards was remarkably severe. Many prisoners were taken, among whom was the Spanish general, and the regiment of Seville was totally destroyed. Three standards, with a large quantity of arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the victors. In consequence of the strift discipline observed by the British, very little was suffered by the town or inhabitants. The generosity and gallantry of Burgoyne were indeed subjects of praise among the Spanish officers themselves. From the Count de la Lippe they received, in the public orders of the day, the highest encomiums.\n\nAll danger was thus at an end on the side of Alemtejo; but it was not so on the other bank of the Tagus, where their immense superiority of numbers enabled the Spaniards to obtain a footing, though but a trifling one, in Portuguese Estramadura, and make a somewhat nearer approach to the capital. Early in October they attacked the old Moorish castle of Villa Velha, and the defiles of St. Simon. The castle was, for a considerable time, supported across the river by Brigadier Burgoyne, who was ported near Nisla and the Tagus. It was, however, at last compelled to surrender, the enemy having contrived to turn the position. A body of two thousand Spaniards now encamped in the neighbourhood of Villa Velha. It was soon perceived by Burgoyne, that this corps, proud of its late successes, was a little more careless than was proper in the neighbourhood of a vigilant and enterprising adversary. For this unsoldier-like negligence he soon inflicted upon them an exemplary chastifement. Under his orders, Lieutenant Colonel Lee, afterwards a Major General in the Army of the American Revolution, crossed the Tagus on the night of the 5th of October, with a detachment of 350 Britifh soldiers, and succeeded in completely surprising the Spanish camp. A considerable slaughter took place, with a very trifling loss to the assailants. Some magazines were burned, six cannons spiked, and sixty artillery mules, and a large quantity of baggage taken. After this decisive blow, the detachment recrossed the Tagus, and resumed its original quarters, without interruption.\n\nHere closed the campaign. Harrassed, dispirited, and reduced to almost one half of their original numbers, the Spanish troops retired within their own frontier. Peace was shortly after concluded between the belligerent powers, and the subject of this memoir returned to his own country, with the reputation of an enlightened, intrepid, and active officer. On the 8th of October, previously to his embarking for England, he had been raised to the rank of Colonel.\n\nAt the general election in 1761, he had been chocen member for Midhurst, and he accordingly, on his arrival from Portugal, took his seat in the Houfe of Commons. He does not, however, appear to have been, at this period, a very active member. On the 18th of March, 1762, he was appointed Colonel of the 16th Light Dragoons. At the election in 1768, he he was returned for the borough of Preston. Some circumstances arising from this event, and from his prefumed connection with the Duke of Grafton, drew upon him the hostiiity of Junius, who, in several of his letters, adverts to him in language of great severity. The same year he was appointed Governor of Fort William; and Major General in 1772.\n\nIn the debates of Parliament he now took a more frequent part than he had before done. The administration having accepted, in 1771, from the Spanish government, a very inadequate satisfaction for the insult which had been offered to Great Britain, by the seizure of the Falkland Islands, he arraigned their conduct in a speech of much eloquence and vigour. But his efforts, and those of his friends, were unavailing; an address approving the convention between tlie two powers was carried by a large majority.\n\nThe next year he was not less strenuous in endeavouring to detect and bring to punishment the corruption and delinquency which disgraced the characters ot those to whom authority had been delegated in the Eastern empire. It was on his motion that a committee was appointed \"to inquire into the nature, state, and condition of the East India Company, and of the Britifh \"aflfairs in the East Indies.\" His speech on this occasion is highly honourable to him, both as a man, and as an orator. As chairman of the committee, he found himfslf repeatedly called upon to defend the measures and intentions of himself and. his colleagues, and he was not backward in the performance of this duty.\n\nBut, amidst the pressure of senatorial and professional avocations, he found time for pursuits of a more light and amusing nature. A marriage took, place in June, 1774, between Edward, son of Lord Stanley, and Lady Elizabeth Hamilton, daughter of the Duke of Hamilton. On this occasion a fete champetre was given at the Oaks, which in taste and splendour far exceeded every thing of the kind that had been feen before. The superintendence of the whole was committed to Burgoyne. It was for this festival that he wrote his first dramatic piece, entitled 'The Maid of the Oaks. This elegant comic entertainment was afterwards, with some additions, it is faid, from the pen of Garrick, successfully brought forward on the boards of Drury Lane Theatre. Nor has it yet lost its attractions with the public, though Mrs. Baddely and Mrs. Abingdon, the original repre- sentatives of Maria and Lady Bab Lardoon, have never been equalled by later performers of those characters.\n\nHis attention, however, was soon called off from letters to arms. He embarked in 1775, with Generals Howe and Clinton, for America, and arrived at Boston early in June.1 Some of the official papers issued there, at that period, are attributed to his pen. His stay this time in America was short, as he returned to England during the winter. But in the spring of 1776, he sailed for Canada, where he had fome fhare in affifting Sir Guy Carleton to expel the Americans, who had for many months held a footing in that province, and even reduced its capital, Quebec, to the greateft ex- tremity. The campaign being at an end, he again, at the close of the year, landed in his native country. During his absence in America he suffered the loss of his wife, Lady Charlotte Burgoyne, who died at Kensington Palace, on the 5th of June, 1776.\n\n___________\n\n1 The subjoined Impromptu, was published at London, on the departure of these Brisih Generals for America:\n\n\"Behold the Cerberus the Atlantic plough !\n\n\"Her precious Cargo, Burgoyne, Clinton, Howe\n\n\"Bow ! wow ! wow !\"\n\n_______________________\n\nGovernment resolved to make, in the Summer of 1777, a decisive effort against the revolted Colonies. A large force was to penetrate toward Albany from Canada, by the way of the Lakes, while another confiderable body advanced up the Hudson's river, for the purpose of joining the Canadian army. By this means it was hoped that all communication would be cut off between the Northern and Southern Colonies, and that each of them, being left to its own means of defence, and attacked by superior numbers, would inevitably be reduced with little trouble. To distract; the attention of the enemy, a detachment was at the same time to attack Fort Stanwix on the Mohawk river.\n\nOn the first of September, 1776, Burgoyne was appointed Lieutenant General, preparatory to assuming command of this expedition. His opinion of, and dispofition towards the Americans, may be inferred from his speech already pronounced in Parliament on the motion for the Repeal of the Act imposing a Duty on Tea. He considered that America had been spoiled by too much indulgence; the independence of that country of the British legislature was in question, and he was ready to resist that proposition and to contend at any future time against such independence. The future here appealed to was at hand, and we shall now see what it had in store for the champion of Parliamentary Taxation.\n\nHis Army, numbering between seven and eight thousand men, set out from St. John's on the 14th of June, 1777, and encamped at the river Bouquet, on the west side of Lake Champlain, near Crown Point. At this place he met the Indians in congress, and, according to the usual custom, gave them a war feast. To repress their native barbarity, he addressed them in a speech, recommending humanity to the enemy, and promising rewards for prisoners, but assuring them that all claims they might make for scalps would be looked into with a very suspicious eye. His next step was to issue a Manifesto to the Americans, in which their hopes and fears were alternately worked upon, in order to induce their return to obedience.\n\nTurgid, pompous and bombastic, this Proclamation instead of producing the effect desired, became the subject of ridicule, derision and satire, and instead of frightening the Americans, only gained for its author the soubriquet of Chrononbotonthologos. It was turned into Hudibrastic rhymes by, it is said, the witty [Francis] Hopkinson, who thus travestied the threats of the British General :\n\nI will let loose the dogs of hell,\n\nTen thousand Indians, who shall yell,\n\nAnd foam and tear, and grin and roar,\n\nAnd drench their moccasins in gore :\n\nTo these I'll give full scope and play\n\nFrom Ticonderog to Florida;\n\nThey'll scalp your heads and kick your shins,\n\nAnd rip your -- , and flay your skins,\n\nAnd of your ears be nimble croppers,\n\nAnd make your thumbs tobacco-stoppers.\n\nIf after all these loving warnings,\n\nMy wishes and my bowels' yearnings,\n\nYou shall remain as deaf as adder,\n\nOr grow with hostile rage the madder,\n\nI swear by St. George and by St. Paul,\n\nI will exterminate you all.\n\nSubscribed with my manual sign\n\nTo tell these presents â John Burgoyne.\"\n\nHaving made some stay at Crown Point, for the purpose of establishing a hospital and magazines, and for other necessary services, the army advanced towards Ticonderoga, which the Americans abandoned. Their retreat was discovered at the dawn of the 6th of July. A rapid pursuit was instantly begun, and continued with such vigour that their vessels were totally destroyed. Hopeless of making any stand at Skenesborough, the American troops retired, after destroying, as well as they could, the various works which had been raised for its defence.\n\nAt Skenesborough, General Burgoyne was compelled to wait several days for the arrival of tents, baggage, and provisions. While his Army remained here, it was incessantly employed in opening roads. Towards the end of July, it arrived near Fort Edward, which was abandoned by the Americans, who retired to Saratoga.\n\nHere, nostwithstanding the most strenuous endeavours were used to forward the service, a halt of fifteen days was found indispenfable for the purpofe of bringing forward bateaux, provisions, and ammunition, from Fort Anne. Neither oxen nor horses were to be procured, and the country was besides inundated with continued rain. Intelligence was here received that Colonel St. Leger had begun the siege of Fort Stanwix. General Burgoyne, therefore, determined to cross the Hudson river. But, though every nerve had been strained, the provision in store was very trifling. A supply, however, must absolutely be obtained. The Americans had established a magazine at Bennington, and it was hoped that by surprising it, a large proportion of what was wanted might be secured. On this service Lieutenant Colonel Baum was dispatched, with about five hundred men. The British, at the same time, moved along the Hudson. and threw a bridge over it opposite Saratoga. Baum had not reached Bennington, when he received advice that the enemy were in great force at that place. He accordingly halted, and sent off to the English camp for assistance. It was dispatched, but before its arrival Baum had been attacked, and his whole party killed or made prisoners. Ignorant of his defeat, the detachment which had been sent to his fuccour continued to advance, until it was surrounded by the victorious Americans, and suffered very severely in making its retreat. Six hundred men were lost to the army by these two engagements. Shortly after, Colonel St. Leger was compelled to retire from before Fort Stanwix.\n\nNearly thirty days' provision having been collected, Burgoyne crossed the Hudson, about the middle of September, and encamped at Saratoga. The Americans were at Stillwater. The British advanced to attack them in that position, and an obstinate battle ensued, in which much honour, but no solid advantage, was gained by the assailants. The field of battle, it is true, remained in the possestion of the British, but nothing more, and it was dearly paid for by the fall of a number of brave men. Nothing could be done against the American camp, all approach to which was rendered impracticable by natural obstacles, as well as by numerous fortifications. Every day also swelled the force of the Americans, and lessened that of the British.\n\nStill hoping that, by the approach of an army up the Hudson from New York, he should be enabled to accomplish the purpose of the campaign, General Burgoyne decided upon holding his position as long as possible. Great exertions were accordingly made to secure it by strong lines and redoubts.\n\nBut while the General was fufficiently occupied in front, by the American Army, a daring attempt was made to shut him up in the rear. From the head of the Connecticut river a body of fifteen hundred men marched, with the utmost secresy, and without being discovered, against Ticonderoga, and succeeded in surprising some of the outposts of that place. They made reiterated assaults upon the fortress itself, for four days; but, being every time repulsed, they at last retired.\n\nThe month of October opened, and no assistance was at hand to extricate Burgoyne from his perilous situation. He now found it expedient to put the troops upon a shorter allowance, and on the 7th of October, to make a movement to the right, to discover whether it was possible to open a passage forward, or, if that could not be done, at least to facilitate a retreat. This motion was also designed to cover a forage of the army.\n\nFifteen hundred men, with eight cannon and two howitzers, were destined for this purpofe. The General himself commanded them, and was seconded by some of his best officers. But Arnold, who had perceived how critical his situation would be if he were turned, did not wait to receive an attack; he quitted his position, and gave battle to the division which was advancing against him. Constantly reinforced by fresh battalions he succeeded, after a desperate conflict, in driving the British to their camp, which was immediately assaulted in various parts, and the Americans broke into the lines in that quarter which was defended by Colonel Breymann. An opening was thus made on the right and the rear.\n\nThe position being no longer tenable it was resolved to abandon it, and take post on the heights above the hospital, by which the front would be changed, and the Americans compelled to form a new dispofition. This delicate and dangerous movement was effected in the night without loss or disorder. Battle was next day offered to the Americans, whose movements obliged the British to leave their favourable ground, and retire towards Saratoga. By the morning of the tenth the whole of their Army had crossed the fords of the Fishkill near that place, and posted itself in a strong situation. It was followed there by the Americans, who took every step which could preclude the possibility of escape.\n\nFar from all succour, surrounded in the most difficult of countries by an Army more than four times his own in numbers, provisions growing short, the regiments mouldering away, every part of the camp exposed to grape and rifle shot, and without power to compel the enemy to an action, Burgoyne assembled a council of war to deliberate upon the measures to be taken in so painful an exigency. Such were the circumstances of the case, that to advance, retreat, or engage, was equally impossible. The unanimous voice of the council, therefore, was for entering upon a negotiation. It was finally settled between the generals, that the British Army should march out of its camp with all the honours of war, and should be sent to Europe, on condition of not serving in America during the present war.\n\nThus terminated this attempt to crush the Independence of this country, and thus it was, amid the throes and thunders of battle, that the American nation was ushered victoriously into life, and baptized in blood on the field of Saratoga. The nations of Europe no longer hesitated to recognize its legitimacy, which France had the honour the first to acknowledge, on the 6th February, 1778.\n\nThe ideas hitherto entertained of the Americans by Gen. Burgoyne, now experienced a total revolution, and he declared that it would be impoffible for Britain to fucceed in her views, and that he fhould, on his return to England, recommend the recognition of their Independence.\n\nHe arrived early in 1778 in that country, whither the news of the Saratoga convention had preceded him, and had been received by Ministers with the most bitter vexation. Pressed already beyond endurance by the opposition, they were well aware that this additional heavy misfortune would be urged against them in Parliament with all the powers of argument and eloquence. To throw the blame on the General was the best means of escaping reproach that suggested itself to their minds. No open attack was indeed immediately made in either house, but insinuations and hints were not spared.\n\nAn audience with his Sovereign was requested, and refused. A court of inquiry, appointed to examine his case, declared him, as a prisoner on parole, to be out of its cognizance; and a court martial, which he next insisted upon, was denied him on the same ground. Parliament alone remained upon which he could throw himself for a hearing. He accordingly, on the 26th of May, attended his duty in the House of Commons, and vindicated his conduct in a long, animated, and satisfactory speech. Two days after he made another in which he arraigned with pointed severity the weakness and incapacity of those who held the reins of government. Some management had been observed towards him by Ministers during the first debate, but they were now goaded into the most determined hostility. To get rid entirely of all further trouble from him, a weak attempt was made by some of them to exclude him from the house, under pretence that, as a prisoner of war, he could have no right to speak or vote. The Speaker being appealed to for his opinion on the subject, his decision was given in favour of the General.\n\nAs this mode of getting rid of him had failed, it was resolved to try another. A lucky opportunity of effecting this had, it was thought, occurred, in the circumftance of Congress having declined to ratify the Convention, until advices of its having been approved of by the English ministry had arrived in America. An order from the Secretary of War was accordingly sent him in the beginning of June to repair to New England, his presence there being necessary to the troops. Obedience to this order he very properly declined. A long correspondence took place on this subject, which ended by his voluntary resignation of all his appointments, amounting, it has been said, to about $17,000 a year. His rank in the Army he, however, retained, in order to render him amenable to a court martial hereafter, and to enable him to fulfil his personal faith with the enemy.\n\nThe long-desired time for defending his calumniated character at length arrived. A committee had, on the repeated demands of Sir William Howe, been appointed in 1781, to inquire into his own conduct during the American war. Before the sittings of this committee were closed, Burgoyne succeeded in procuring evidence to be examined before it with respect to the proceedings of the army under his command. The result was such as could not but be highly flattering to his feelings. Every officer that was examined gave the strongest testimony to his bravery and superior talents. It did not appear that a single fault had been found with any of his plans or movements by the most enlightened judges who were on service with him; but it did clearly appear that he enjoyed the entire confidence of the army, and that, in situations of the most trying nature, in the face of disaster, of danger, and of death, he was looked up to by his troops with the warmest affection, and the most undoubted reliance; that they were at all times ready to suffer, to fight, and to perish with him. The committee was shortly after suddenly dissolved, without having passed a single resolution upon the subject which had been referred to its confideration.\n\nIn 1780 he appeared before the public with two productions of very dissimilar natures. The first of thefe was, A State of the Expedition from Canada as laid before the House of Commons and verified by Evidence. It was inscribed, in an elegant and affectionate address, to the officers of the army which he had commanded against the Americans. He narrates, in a concise and perspicuous manner, yet with great spirit, the whole of the transactions which took place.\n\nHis other literary effort was a comic opera, in three acts, called The Lord of the Manor, which was received with much applause. It is a light but lively and well- conducted little piece, far superior in merit to many later favorites of the same kind. In the course of it, many severe and witty sarcasms are aimed at the administration which was then in power.\n\nThe party which had so long and so eloquently opposed the ruinous war with America having at last been called to share in the toils and the honours of government, Gen. Burgoyne was not forgotten. He was on the 16th of April, 1782, appointed Commander in Chief of his Majesty's forces in Ireland; a few days after, a member of the privy council of that country, and on the 7th June, 1782, Colonel of the 4th Foot. The rank of commander in chief, however, he retained not quite two years, when a new administration was again formed.\n\nThe new Ministry soon found itself vigorously attacked by the party in opposition. No pains were spared to render it an object of hatred and contempt. To accomplish these ends the powers both of wit and argument were incessantly employed. Of the weapons used in the lighter of these two modes of hostility, the Criticisms on the Rolliad, and the Probationary Odes, were, perhaps, the most offensive to the minister and his friends. No less than twenty-one editions of them have been published. The Westminster Guide, and one of the Probationary Odes, were contributed by General Burgoyne. Both these pieces are reprinted in the Collection of his Works.\n\nIn 1786 appeared his comedy of The Heiress. It was welcomed, by crowded audiences, with that applause which it so well merited. Nor was it less attractive in the closet. The sale of ten editions in one year bore ample testimony to its merits. He not long after gave to the stage an adaptation of Sedaine's historical romance of Richard Coeur de Lion, and was again successful in his claim to public approbation. The piece had a very flattering run, and has been since revived.\n\nAt an early period of his parliamentary career, Gen. Burgoyne was active in the pursuit and exposure of Indian delinquency. After a lapse of thirteen years he was called upon to assist others in the performance of a similar task. He was chofen in 1787, one of the committee of managers for conducing the impeachment of Mr. Hastings. Under this charadler he, during the course of the trial, moved the censure of the house upon Major Scott, for a libel on the conduct of the committee. The motion was carried. His sleady performance of his duty as a manager, exposed him to an anonymous attack, published in a collection of epistles, the poetical style of which was in imitation of the New Bath Guide. The conclusion of Mr. Hastings's trial the General did not live to witness. His death took place on the 4th of August, 1792, from a sudden attack of the gout, at his house in Hertford Street, May Fair, and was an unexpected stroke to his friends, as he had been out in apparently good health the preceding day. He was buried, in a very private manner, on the 13th, in the cloislers of Westminster Abbey. Only one coach, containing four gentlemen, attended his funeral. No memorial, not even a simple stone, marks the spot where his remains are interred.1\n\nHaving thus dispofed of the principal actor in the momentous movement against the infant liberties of the Republic, nothing remains but to allude to some other portion of our labours. By the courtesy of Mr. Thornton of Boston, we are enabled to add a copy of the Parole signed by the officers of the army at Cambridge, in December, 1777; also the names of those officers now, as far as we are aware, for the first time correctly printed. The reader will find also, in this volume, carefully prepared biographical sketches of Gen. James Wilkinson, Gen. Riedefel, and other officers who made this campaign, and likewise a list of the several Brunswick officers who served under Gen. Riedefel's command. We are indebted to the politeness of the Hon. James Partridge, Secretary of State of Maryland, for a copy of the joint Resolution of the General Assembly of that State, conferring a pension on Gen. Wilkinson, and to Mr. Dawson of White Plains, for the German work from which we have obtained the materials for the life of Gen. Riedefel, and the roll of his officers, with such particulars as are appended to each of their names. Other assistance will be found acknowledged in the Appendix.\n\n1 Most of the particulars repecting Gen. Burgoyne, embraced in this Introduction are borrowed from a Sketch of the Life of that officer prefixed to an edition of his Dramatic and Poetical Works, London 1808, 2 volumes.\n\n__________________\n\nORDERLY BOOK.\n\nThe Chaffeurs, Light Infantry and Grenadiers under Col. Bremen, form the Advanced Guard opposite the Point, which is a little above cleared Ground, on the Right of the Incampment. The Dragoons of Reidesel follow immediately the Advanced Guard. The First Brigade British leads the Line at the Distance of about 200 Yards in the Rear of the Dragoons. The German Brigades follow in their order. Each Corps will make a Column of four Boats in Front, and on the Flanks of the Column, taking care to leave Room for the Oars of the Center Boats.\n\nAs soon as the whole are disposed in the above order, two Guns will be fired from the Maria, and a Jack hoisted at Foretopmast Head, at which the whole will move, and whether sailing or rowing, will endeavor to keep the same Order.\n\nSandy Bluff, June 20, 1777.\n\nParole, St. Peters. Countersign, Florence.\n\nLieut. General Burgoyne takes the Occasion of the Army assembling to express publickly the high Opinion he entertains of the Troops which his Majesty has been graciously pleased to entrust to his Command; they could not have been selected more to his Satosfaction. And the Lieut. General trusts it will be received as one mark of his Atte tion to their Glory and Welfare, that with the promise of every encouragement the service will allow, he declares a determination, and he calls upon every officer to assist him, to maintain a steady System of Subordination and Obedience.\n\nThe following Standing Regulations laid down to prevent the necessity of lengthening the daily Orders, and are to be invariably observed.\n\nOfficers of all Ranks commanding our Ports and Detachments, are constantly to fortify in the best manner the circumstances of the place and the implements at hand will permit. Felling Trees with their Points outward, barricading Churches and Houses, Breastworks of Earth and Timber, are generally to be effected in a short Time, and the Science of Engineering is not necessary to find and apply such resources. The Pracflice of fortifying which is useful in all Services, is particularly so in this, where the Enemy, infinitely inferior to the King's Troops in open space and hardy Combat, is well fitted by dispofition and practice for the Stratagems and Enterprises of little War. And neither the distance of Camps nor the Interference of Forests and Rivers are to be looked upon as security against his Attempts. Upon the same principle it must be a constant rule in or near Woods to place advanced Centries where they may have a Tree or some other defence to prevent their being taken off by single marksmen.\n\nTogether with these precautions Officers will ever bear in mind how much the publick honour and their own are concerned in maintaining a Post; and that to justify a Retreat in the present War, the number of the Enemy must be much superior to that which would make their Jsftification when acting against brave and disciplined Forces.\n\nThe Officers will take all proper Opportunities, and especially at the beginning of the Campaign, to inculcate in the men's minds a Reliance upon the Bayonet. Men of half their bodily strength, and even Cowards may be their match in firing; but the onset of Bayonets in the hands of the Valiant is irresistable. The Enemy, convinced of this truth, place their whole dependance in Entrenchments and Rifle pieces. It will be our Glory and preservation to form where possible.\n\nThe Attention of every Officer in Action is to be employed upon his men. To make use of a Fufil, except in very extraordinary cases of immediate personal defence, would betray an ignorance of his importance, and his Duty.\n\nNo occasion can make it necessary to keep the Arms loaded in the Bell Tents : nor are the Battalions of the Line ever to be loaded upon the march till very near the time when they may be expected to engage.\n\nNo Parties are to go from Camp with or without Arms, without a proportionate number of Officers. Not only the Discipline and Honour, but also the safety of the Troops require the strictest prohibition from Straggling and Plundering, and the Savages as well as the Provost will have Orders to punish Offenders in these respects, instantly, and with the utmost rigour.\n\nThe Camp will always be extended as widely as the Ground will admit, for the sake of Cleanliness and of Health; but as it must often happen that the extent will be insufficient for the Line to form in the Front of the Encampment, according to the present establishment of open Files and two deep, the Quarter-Master-General will therefore mark at every new Camp the Portion of Ground each Battalion is to clear over and above its own Front, in order to make the work equal. To clear this Ground must be the immediate business after arriving in Camp, and in this Country, it may often be necessary to have an Alarm Post cleared in the Rear as well as in the Front. By clearing is meant the removal of such obstructions as might prevent the ready forming of the Troops to receive or advance upon the Enemy. It is not necessary to cut the large Trees for that purpose, except where they may afford Shelter for the Enemy.\n\nQuarter Guards are always to face outwards, and at the distance of a hundred yards from the Bells of Arms, and to have a Fluke of earth or timber thrown up before them.\n\nWhen the Encampment of the Line is with the Front to the water, and too near to admit of this regulation, the Quarter Guards are to be ported in the Rear, and those of the Flank Regiments occasionally upon the Flanks.\n\nThough the ground will seldom admit a strict regularity in pitching the Officers' Tents, they are never to be placed so as to interfere with the Line of Defence.\n\nAll Deserters from the Enemy, suspected Spies, or other persons presenting themselves at the Outposts, or otherwiie stopped, are to be sent forthwith to Head Quarters, without questioning them.\n\nIn all Duties by Detachment, the Corps will furnish according to their Effeftive Strength.\n\nWhen the Lieut. General visits an Outpost, the men are not to stand to their Arms, or pay him any Compliment.\n\nThe Articles of War which regard the men, to be read at the head of every Regiment to-morrow evening parade, and afterwards these Regulations.\n\nThe Daily Duties will be as follows. One Brigadier General for the Day, who will visit the Outpofts, and have a General inspection over the Camp. All reports are to be made through him, except when any Alarm or other Exigency requires instant notice to the Commander-in-Chief\n\nA Major of Brigade for the Day, who is to parade all Guards, and Detachments, &c.\n\nWhen the last Brigade arrives the Picquet will consist of one Field Officer for each Wing; one Captain for each Brigade, one Subaltern, one Serjeant, one Corporal, and twenty-five Private men, from each Regiment. A Drum to be furnished by the Regiment which gives the Captain.\n\nThe whole Picquet to assemble half an hour before Gun firing at the Centre of the Line, and to be exercised in marching and charging with Bayonets, under the inpection of the Brigadier of the day, in order that the British and German Troops may acquire a uniformity of pace and motion when acting together in Line.\n\nHalf the Picquet is always to be polled during the night at some distance from the Camp, and at such places as may be exposed to the secret approach of the Enemy. It will be the care of the Brigadier of the Day to poll them.\n\nCamp at River Bouqjjet,\n\nJune 21st, 1777.\n\nParole, St. Mark.

He recommends it strongly to the Commanding Officers to bring their Corps into this useful Practice, as it may frequently happen that the movements of the Army will be too quick to admit a possibility of construcfling ovens.\n\nNo Guns to be fired in Camp, and the standing Orders against any Soldier going beyond the advanced Gentries is to be put strictly in Execution from this day.

We find this officer appointed in 1756, to the command of a company in the 64th Foot, which regiment served in the expeidtion against the French West India Islands in 1759, and in America in 1768. On the 2nd June 1770, he became Maor of the 38th, and on 25th July, 1771, Lieutenant Colonel of the 53rd, which formed a part of this expedition, wherein Leieut. Colonel Powell held the rank of Brigadier General. When the Americans evacuated Ticonderoga on the 6th July, 1777, Big. Powell was left in command of that post with a suitable garrison. After the defeat of Baum at Bennington, the Americans devised a plan to cut off Burgoyne's supplies. With that view an expedition was got up to recover Ticonderoga. The manner of conducting the movement was left to G. Lincoln with a force of 1500 of the New Hampshire and Connecticut militia. Such secrecy and activity had been used on the occasion that early on the 18th of September they succeeded in securing the old French lines near the fort and sumoned the garrison to surrender. Brig. Gen. Powell however declined the invitation, and for four days maintained a most gallant defence, and at als obliged the enemy to retreat. On the evacuation of Ticonderoga in November, Brig. Powell returned to Canada. He obtained the brevet rank of Colonel in 1779; was advanced to the grade of Major General on 20th November, 1782, and to the chief command of the 69th regiment in april 1792. On the 20th April, 1794, he became Colonel of the 15th foot; Lieutenant General in 1796; a General oin the Army on 1st January, 1801, and died at Lyme, at an advanced age, on 14th July, 1814.\n\nCamp Crown Point, 28th June, 1777.

He did duty as an Engineer in the Garrifon at Gibraltar until 1771, when he was promoted to a lieutenancy; from 1772 to the end of 1775, he was employed on the new fortifications for the defence of the dockyard at Portsmouth; early in 1776 he embarked with General Burgoyne and his army for Canada, and landed at Quebec in June, when he was nominated Aid-de-Camp to Major General Phillips. He was with the Army in pursuing the Americans up the river St. Lawrence, and was in the affair at Three Rivers, 8th June, and proceeded with the Army until the Americans were driven out of Canada, and embarked in their fleet and boats on Lake Champlain in July. He was then appointed by Sir Guy Carleton, the Commander-in-Chief, to be Comptroller of Works, and to superintend the construction of a fleet for Lake Champlain, with gun boats and batteaux for carrying the army over the Lake; and with the able assistance ot the naval department, over which Admiral Schank was made Commissioner, they began, in the middle of July, every necessary preparation for so arduous an undertaking, and at a time that government had neither vessel nor boat on Lake Champlain, nor the smallest building for barracks, store-houses, or workshops. Notwithstanding all which, a numerous fleet was constructed which fought and defeated the Americans at Valcour Island, on the 11th and 12th Oftober, and obtained the naval superiority during the whole war. He then proceeded with the army to Crown Point, and with it returned and wintered in Canada. In the Spring of 1777, he was appointed Commanding Engineer under General Burgoyne; and in July was with the army at the investment of Ticonderoga, where the Americans had employed many thousand men, during eight months, in fortifying Mount Independence; but from the position which the army took, these works were immediately abandoned. He served with the army the whole of the campaign, and was present at all the general actions, and was included in the Convention of Saratoga, but was, with other officers, exchanged a tew days afterwards and returned to Ticonderoga, when he assisted in the evacuation ot that post in November, 1777. At the close of 1778 he obtained a commission as Captain, and in that year was sent by General Sir F. Haldimand to Lake Ontario, to form a naval establishment on the east side of that lake; and was afterwards employed in different parts ot Canada as Commanding Engineer, until the peace of 1783, when he obtained leave to return to England. In 1785 he was employed as Secretary to the Board of Land and Sea Officers, appointed under the King's Sign Manual, to report upon the defences of the dockyards at Portsmouth and Plymouth. From 1785 to 1792, he was employed as an Engineer at Portsmouth, where many new works were constructing, particularly Cumberland Fort, at the entrance of Langston Harbour. In June, 1794, he was made Lieutenant Colonel, and in the same year was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the Royal Academy at Woolwich. Between 1792 and 1799, he was employed in augmenting the defences on the coasts of Kent and Sussex, particularly at Dover Castle. In 1799, upon Colonel Hay of the Engineers being killed in Holland, he was sent as Commanding Royal Engineer, under the Duke of York, and remained there until the evacuation of that country was completed; and on the 1st January, 1800, he obtained the rank of Colonel, in which year he was sent to visit the Islands of Guernsey and Jersey. In 1802 he was ordered to make the tour of Ireland, and report respecting its defences. In 1803 he was again sent to the coasts of Kent and Susex, and was appointed Brigadier General in February, 1804; Major General on the 30th October, 1805, in which year he was directed to carry into execution the system of detached redoubts and towers which government had adopted for the defence of that seacoast, and was finished about the year 1809; on the 24th of June in that year he was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Royal Engineers, when he ceased to be Lieutenant Governor of the Academy at Woolwich. In 1810, after an active service of fifty years, he obtained leave to be unemployed, and retired into the country. On the 1st January, 1812, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant General, and became General in the Army 27th May, 1825. General Twiss died March 14th, 1827, at his seat at Harden Grange, Yorkshire, aged 82 years.

On the breaking out of the war in 1793, he being then nearly at the head of the list of Majors in the army, was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of one ot the battalions formed from the in dependent companies; whence, in February, 1794., he exchanged to the command of the 30th regiment, with which he proceeded to Corsica in May tollowing, and remained there until 1796, having for the greater part of that time acted as Inspector General of Corsican troops raised for the Britslh service. In 1796 Lieut. Col. Green was appointed Civil Governor of Grenada, in which office he continued until 1801, when, his sight being much injured by the climate, he received pcrmission to return. He had in the meantime been promoted to the rank of Colonel, in January, 1797, and Brigadier General, Oct. 1798. Early in 1803, he was appointed Brigadier General on the staff in Ireland, and commanded in the counties of Tipperary and Kilkenny; and was afterwards removed to the staff in England, and to command at Dover and Deal. He received the honour of knighthood May 3, that year. In January, 1804, he was appointed Colonel of the York Light Infantry Volunteers.

He remained at Surinam about a year in administration of the civil government; and, having obtained leave to return home on account of ill health, was honoured on his arrival with a patent of Baronetcy, dated December 5, 1805.

In 1758 the regiment was employed in the expedition to St. Male on the coast of France, and in 1760 served in the expedition against Belleiske. On the increase of the Army in 1761, Captain Hamihon was appointed Major commanding the newly raised 113th regiment, and on its reduction in 1763 went on half pay. In 1772 he obtained the brevet rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and on the 11th March, 1774, was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the 21st or Royal North British Fuzileers, and proceeded to Canada in 1776 with the rank of Brigadier General, having the command of the 2d brigade. Having accompanied the Britilh portion of the \"Convention \" troops to Massachusetts, his name is found signed to the parole given by the officers at Cambridge in December. These troops having been afterwards ordered to the South, Brig. Hamilton was stationed at Frcdericktown in\n\nMaryland. When orders were received for their removal to Lancaster on the approach of Lord\n\nCornwallis in 1 781, and for the separation of the officers from the soldiers, he did all in his power to alleviate the sufferings of the men and ordered that they should be paid the balance of their accounts. Brig. Hamilton was advanced to the rank of Major General in 1787, and on the 22nd August, 1792, was appointed Colonel of the 15th Foot, and on the 20th June, 1794, of his old regimcnt, the 21st Fuzileers. He was advanced to the grade ot Lieutenant General in 1797; became General in the Army in 1802, and died at his house at Murdostown, 27th July, 1803.\n\n______________________\n\nUpon the Order for establishing Point an Fer a Military Post, Lieut. Twiss of the Corps of Engineers, with Lieut. Beacrost of the 24th Regiment, Assistant Engineer, were sent there to form the Establishment accordingly.\n\nA Detachment of Infantry was also sent to cover the Workmen and defend the Post, when it became a matter of doubt whether the Officer Commanding that Detachment was to cosfider himself under the Orders of the Engineer at that Post, although of Senior Rank by Commission.\n\nTo prevent Doubts or Inconveniences in the Service for the future, it is to be understood by the Army, that whoever has the honour to have a Commission from the King must take Command according to the date of such Commission, and therefore Engineers and Assistant Engineers, being stationed or employed by Order ot the Commander in Chief at any Post with any Detachment of the Army, must be obeyed as commanding that Post, should the date of his Commission be senior to that of other Officers in such a Situation.\n\nThe Conduct however of the Officers who went on these Detachments is to be commended by having declined any dispute which might have proved of any inconvenience to the Service.\n\nThe Parties that were applied for by the Paymaster General and the Hospital, being for a temporary purpose, they were of course to return to their Regiments as soon as that duty was done.\n\nCamp near Ticonderoga, 3rd July, 1777.\n\nParole, St. Honora, Countersign, Dover.\n\nBrigadier Generals and Brigade Majors as yesterday.\n\nField Officer Picquet British, Lieut.

All Officers are also to communicate to their men this prohibition of fspplying the Savages with Spirituous Liquors. And it is expected that Officers, instead of screening Offenders, will be the first to bring them to condign punishment; and to give further force to this prohibition, ten Dollars will be paid by the Adjutant General to the first perfon who shall discover an Offender, upon Conviction of such Offender before a Court Martial.\n\nA large Road of Communication to be made forthwith from the Camp of the Left Wing to the ground where Colonel Brumens Corps is now posted.\n\nThe Brigade of Gall are to take up the ground where Brigadier General Fraser was encamped at Threemile Point.

Some have been compelled into the Service, others engaged only with a view of joining the King's Troops. The Savages are therefore cautioned against firing upon any single man or small parties that may be endeavouring to come over, and the Army in general will consider these men in a very different light from common Deferters, and treat them with all possible encouragement; and should it unfortunately happen that any Soldier of this Army should fall into the hands of the Enemy, it will be his Duty to let this Order be known in the Enemy's Army.\n\nThe Hospital will remain at Threemile Point till further orders.

After returning to Ireland this regiment received orders for Canada in 1775, at the close of which year Mr. Harnage was appointed Major. He was wounded at the battle of Stillwater and accompanied the Convention troops to Cambridge. He became Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army in 1780; on the 18th March, 1782, was appointed Lieut. Colonel of the 104th Foot, but left that regiment in the beginning of 1783, and was afterwards appointed Inspecting Field Officer of Yeomanry and Volunteers on 24th September, 1803. Mrs. Harnage accompanied her husband throughout this Campaign, and died May 27, 1790. In 1791 his daughter Mary was married to George Blackman, Esq., afterwards Sir George Harnage, Bart.; and in 1798 his daughter Ottavia was married to Edward Gwatkin, Esq.

Major General Reidesel with his Advanced Guard consisting of the Chasseur Company and Grenadiers and Light Infantry arrived in time to sustain General Fraser, and by his judicious Orders and a spirited execution of them, obtained a Share for himself and for his Troops in the Glory of the Action.\n\nOn the 8th Lieut.

On the iith September, 1775, he became Lieutenant Colonel in the Army, and on the 10th November of the same year was promoted to be Lieutenant Colonel of the 9th Foot, then under orders for Canada. This regiment formed, on arriving in that country, part of the 2nd brigade under Brig. Hamilton and was cantoned in the settlements back of Montreal until the opening of this disastrous campaign. On the 7th of July, 1777, he took post with his regiment at Fort Anne, where he was attacked by the Americans in considerable force. Col. Hill gained great honor by his conduct in this action, for the enemy finding, after repeated attacks, that they could not force him in front endeavored to surround his men. This movement he however prevented by changing his ground with great calmness and bravery in the very heat of action, and after a fight of three hours obliged the Americans to retreat, leaving some thirty prisoners and the colors of the New Hampshire regiment in the hands of the 9th regiment.1 Lt. Col. Hill participated in the other engagements in this campaign and signed the parol at Cambridge (Mass.), in December, 1777. He became a Colonel in the Army in 1782, and continued with the 9th until the Summer of 1783, when he retired from the Army. His name is among the subscribers to Capt. Anbury's book in 1789.\n\n__________________\n\n1 Gen. Wilkinson in his Memoirs, p. 190, gives a somewhat different version of this affair, as follows : \" The 9th regiment, under Lieut. Col. Hill, was sent in purfuit of Col. Long and his detachment, consisting of the invalids and convalescents, with his regiment, about 150 strong, making in the whole four or five hundred men. Col. Long, finding himself pressed, advanced and met Lieut. Colonel Hill, and an action ensued, in which the British officer claimed the victory; but it is a fact, that the 9th regiment had been beaten, and was retreating, and but for the entire failure of Col. Long's Ammunition, the Lieutenant-Colonel must have been made priloner, as well as Captain Montgomery of that regiment, who was wounded and left on the field, when, as Gen. Burgoyne tells us, \"Col. Hill found it necessary to change his position in the heat of action,\" but in truth, when his corps was obliged to retreat, and Colonel Long, for want of ammunition, could not pursue him.\"\n\n___________________\n\nThese rapid succcesses, after exciting a proper sense of what we owe to God, entitle the Troops in General to the warmest praise; and in particular distinction is due to Brigadier General Fraser, who by his Conduit and Bravery, supported by the fame qualities in the Officers and Soldiers under his Command, effected an exploit of material Service to the King, and of signal honour to the Profession of Arms.\n\nThis Corps have the further Merit of having supported fatigue and bad weather, without bread and without murmur.\n\nDivine Service will be performed on Sunday morning next at the head of the Line, and at the head of the Advanced Corps, and at sunset on the same day, a feu de joye will be fired with Cannon and fmal Arms at Ticonderoga, Crown Point, the Camp at Skeinesborough, and the Camp at Castleton, and the Post of Breemen's Corps.

This Officer servcd in Germany with the 8th Foot, in which he was commissioned a Lieutenant 26th September, 1757. He afterwards served in America, and obtained his Company 25th December, 1770. In the early stage of the Revolution the head quarters of his regiment was at Niagara with detachments at other posts. Capt. Forster was slationed at Oswegatchie (now Ogdenlburgh) in the fore part of 1776. To dislodge a party of Americans, of three hundred and ninety men, who had taken post at the Cedars, above Montreal, he with two subalterns and one hundred and twenty-six men, and one hundred and twenty Indians, were detached on the 11th of May to the attack of that post. Proceeding on his march, he learnt on the 17th, that the Americans were ignorant of his approach, and that if speedily attacked, the whole party might be surprised. The next day he landed at Point au Diable, six miles from the Church of the Cedars, and proceeded under the cover of a thick wood; when within a mile of the Fort, he halted the detachment to make the necessary dispositions for attack. One division was ordered to take possession of the wood, and to penetrate as near as possible to the enemy, when another party of Indians were placed at the Falls, at the entrance of the Cascade, to cut off the communication with the Island of Montreal. This party fell in with a detachment of the garrison returning from the Cascades with provisions, who fled to the Fort, and carried the first intelligence of Capt. Forster's approach. Capt.

Forster, conceiving that the object was to gain time, and having learnt that an Officer of the Americans had been sent to Montreal for a reinforcement sent a second flag, stating that the Indians were at present under his command, but that if the Fort did not surrender, and any of them were killed by further resistance, he could not answer for the consequenccs. The Commandant, in answer to this demand, agreed to surrendcr the Fort, on condition, however, that the garrison should retire to Montreal, which Capt. Forster not consenting to, a redoubt was thrown up on the edge of the wood, at five hundred yards distance from it. On the morning of the 19th of July, he advanced within one hundred and twenty yards of the Fort, and commenced a heavy fire of musketry, until twelve o'clock, when the American Commandant surrendered, on condition of sparing their lives, and preserving their baggage from plunder. As Captain Forster was informed the next day, that Major Sherborne, with one hundred men, was advancing from Montreal, he ordered one hundred Indians to take posession of the woods on both sides of the road, and to attack the detachment as it advanced. An action ensued, which only continued about ten minutes, when the Americans surrendered, and were brought to the Fort by the Indians, who had ressolved on putting every one of them to death. Captain Forster remonstrated with them on this inhuman conduct, and at length, by his persuasions, and by presents, effected their release. Capt. Forfter then left the Cedars, on his way down the river, and on his arrival at Vaudreuil, was informed that Colonel A"
