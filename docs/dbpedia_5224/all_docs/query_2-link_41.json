        "text": "===\n\nART IN AMERIC A MAGAZINE\n\nPreviews Oct. 17, 2013\n\nFrieze London: Welcome to Art History, Level One\n\nby Iphgenia Baal\n\nOne of the last preparations before doors open to the Frieze art fair tonight is the installation of Richard Long’s mud painting at London’s Lisson Gallery. The mud is applied directly to the wall, and the floor needs to be covered with a protective sheet. When the work is finished, there is a clean black line along the bottom of the wall that draws the eye. In an environment where everything is slick, the work stands out as a refreshing example of healthy earthiness.\n\nNow in its 11th year, Frieze London 2013 (Oct. 17-20) hosts some 170 exhibitors (up from last year’s 120), attesting to the fair’s status in the global art market. Exhibitors represent 34 countries, making this year, according to the organizers, the fair’s most international outing yet.\n\nCountless satellite fairs like Moving Image and (new this year) Strarta have sprung up, and London galleries schedule exhibitions of their biggest hitters to coincide with the fair’s opening; see Tim Noble and Sue Webster at Blain Southern. At the preview, all the familiar faces from the art establishment were present: museum directors like Nicholas Penny (National Gallery), Ralph Rugoff (Hayward) and Nicholas Serota (Tate), as are artists like Grayson Perry, Anish Kapoor and Martin Creed.\n\nIf Frieze truly is nothing more than a temple of consumerism at its most devout, then the altarpiece is Jeff Koons’s bronze megaliths of lobsters, kittens and candies, showing at Gagosian Gallery. The rumored $10 million price tag (which the gallery declined to confirm) reinforces the notion that cash is king. Yet only a booth away, at Berlin’s Esther Schipper, Pierre Huyghe’s aquarium works house horseshoe and arrow crabs—this living ecosystem is utterly unconcerned with cash flow. Even if his aquarium pieces do come with a price tag of $165,000 each and a life span of 15 years, here “prehistoric life forms that pre-date all this,” as a gallery representative describes it, are top of the food chain.\n\nStill, the chief traffic is buyers. Dealers in the Frame section, reserved for 18 galleries founded post-2003 (16 of whom are Frieze first-timers) all told A.i.A. that sales were good. There are some lively examples here, like Berlin-based artist Ryan Siegan-Smith’s works concerning memory and mnemonic techniques in a mixture of video, installation and drawing at Malmö’s Johan Berggren. Seemingly everyone’s favorite were Marlie Mul’s sand and resin puddles at Milan’s Fluxia, for about $5,500.\n\nIn the main exhibitors section, Laura Bartlett is returning for her fifth year with a sampler of artists including Cyprien Galliard, Nina Beir, Ian Law and Allison Katz. “Art fairs are where the relationship between gallerist and artist is both least and most romantic,” the London dealer told A.i.A., “but underlying everything is the same yearning, seeking out treasure.”\n\nNo one is forthcoming about what they are selling, for how much and to whom, but A.i.A. did overhear one dealer comparing shopping styles. “The Europeans walk round for days writing notes, then do all their buying on the Sunday. If the Americans want it, they buy on the spot.” One pair of arty spectacles with a New York City rasp dropped $80,000 on two Warhol drawings at New York’s Cheim & Read with the comment, “I just came off my medication this morning!”\n\nOn the whole, the air is less frenzied than past years. Air kisses have given way to a more serious crowd. Combined tickets to Frieze and Frieze Masters are $80 this year, so it is less about networking and more about cold, hard currency. “The market has matured,” an English collector told A.i.A., “and people are here to do business.”\n\nThat includes the crowd at Frieze Masters. Now in its second year, Frieze Masters provides a greatest hits of everything up until 2000. If modern art has been knocked off its perch by the growing strength of the contemporary market in recent years, then Frieze Masters addresses that balance. Dealers bring out prestige works of Japanese Gutai and Russian Constructivism, with 12 galleries focusing on Brazilian modernism.\n\nMost galleries at Frieze Masters are returning exhibitors, but some pulled out, deciding to concentrate on the main fair and its reputation for guaranteed sales. “We did both fairs last year, and did well at Frieze but we didn’t make any money here” at Frieze Masters, Elliott MacDonald, representing Pace, told A.i.A. “But when you don’t do a fair, you always have the sneaking suspicion you are missing out.”\n\nMacDonald’s suspicions may be right. Walking into Cheim & Read, one of the dealers says loudly on speakerphone, “I can’t tell you exactly what but a very nice thing happened today.” One museum director (who wished to be unnamed) put a reserve on the entire exhibition documenting artist Rose English’s feminist dressage performances at London’s Karsten Schubert.\n\nThere are no bargains at Frieze Masters. Sam Fogg, a London specialist in medieval art, has maybe the most beautiful object in the entire fair: an illuminated manuscript from the Book of Kings, selling for $8 million. New York-based Hans P. Kraus Jr. has a Julia Margaret Cameron album for about $7 million; portrait subjects include Darwin and Tennyson. Then there is The Census at Bethlehem by Brueghel the Elder, which hasn’t been on the market since it was bought directly from the studio 400 years ago by an English family who has kept it in Kenya in recent years.\n\nFrieze Masters contextualizes Frieze London in a way the organizers probably never intended. It backs up contemporary works as often as it tears them down. Korean artist Kyungah Ham is showing an embroidered canvas at Kukje Gallery (Seoul), a clear homage to Alighiero Boetti (showing at London’s Dickinson as part of Frieze Masters). But when quizzed, the exhibitor told A.i.A., “No. Not like Boetti. Original.” On the flip side, the three Michelangelo Pistoletto works on sale by different galleries at Frieze Masters are called out by Gavin Turk’s Pistoletto’s Waste (2013) at Vienna’s Galerie Krinzinger at Frieze London. Turk’s work mimics the originals’ mirrored stainless steel, but replaces the boy and dog pictured in Pistoletto’s series with an image of black trash can liners.\n\nWhere inclusion in Frieze once meant you had made it, Frieze Masters makes the main fair look increasingly like level one in a long-drawn-out strategy game, with the question now being: How many of the works showing at Frieze London will make it into Frieze Masters in 10 years’ time?\n\n========\n\nFINANCIAL TIMES LONDON\n\nFrieze London: report\n\nBy Jackie Wullschlager\n\nAn unlikely star emerges from among\n\nvariable new work at Frieze London\n\n©Lisson Gallery’Groovy Spiral’ by Dan Graham at Frieze London\n\nThe first conversation I overheard at Frieze London was an American collector suggesting to her husband that they buy Dan Graham’s glamorously minimalist seven-metre curving glass and mirror sculpture “Groovy Spiral” as an alternative hallway for their latest home.\n\nIn fact, “Groovy Spiral” at Lisson Gallery is the fair’s most democratic, inclusive work – despite its $600,000 price tag. Framed in steel, it resembles from the outside a three-dimensional question-mark, or perhaps semi-colon, momentarily punctuating the rush and crush of too many people, pictures, prices. Walk inside, and its mirrored surfaces dizzyingly blur, mute and distance you from the crowds, who are reflected on a long white wall opposite as a frieze of pale shadows.\n\nThis is Frieze in microcosm: a glassy, self-referential world all its own. Jeff Koons became a record-breaking market presence by sculpting banal, kitsch objects glorifying another alternative reality, Disney-like and infantilised; Gagosian has literally raised the roof of Frieze’s tent to showcase his giant hanging sculptures “Sacred Heart” – a stainless steel blue balloon tied with a pink ribbon – “Lobster” and the aluminium/rubber “Titi Tyre” modelled on children’s inflatable ducks. I loathe Koons, but as a statement of his role in conceptual sculpture’s history, Gagosian’s display is unassailable.\n\nIf all its booths were like Lisson’s and Gagosian’s – clear, decisive, committed – Frieze would be pure provocative pleasure. Certainly structural changes made to echo the sober elegance of last year’s Frieze Masters have benefited this fair: wider aisles, softer lighting, fewer exhibitors. But among the galleries themselves, too many have responded to Masters’ cut-off date of 2000 by assuming in contrast an unconsidered contemporaneity: haphazard, provisional hangs; slick, unoriginal work, much of it dated 2013.\n\nEven at big-name spaces, some market-stall juxtapositions are so discordant that pieces argue each other out of existence. Alex Katz’s 34 small studies, landscapes and flower paintings, marvellously abbreviated dramas of light, shade and time (more than half of them sold by yesterday), struggle amid the surrounding installation of Rob Pruitt’s “Safety Cones” jokily adorned with sunglasses, smiley faces and hats at Gavin Brown’s enterprise. Affectingly wan and melancholy, Ron Mueck’s diminutive hyper-realist “Woman with Shopping”, looking as if she is about to stride out of Hauser & Wirth’s stand, is not helped by the backcloth of a massive, violent Paul McCarthy painting (already sold to a European collection for £750,000).\n\nThe best displays, aping Frieze Masters, are intensely curated and concentrated. Pace’s exploration of global portraiture is outstanding. It includes Romanian wunderkind Adrian Ghenie’s painterly depictions of epoch-changing figures – “Charles Darwin”; a scrawled-over face of Hitler in which paint seeks revenge on history – in dialogue with both Hiroshi Sugimoto’s uncanny photographs such as “Lenin”, modelled on a waxwork, and Li Songsong’s “Marshal”, a historical painting built up in impasto brushwork on panels roughly stuck together, disjointedly overlapping, so that the image never coheres. These in turn relate to the grid-patterned self-portraits with which Chuck Close questions realism and abstraction.\n\nSaleable, accessible painting of wildly varying quality dominates the fair: highlights among new works are a free cascading landscape by Hurvin Anderson (sold by Thomas Dane in the fair’s first half hour for £130,000), a Jules de Balincourt cityscape (Victoria Miro), Chris Ofili’s monumental black figures playing out classical myth (David Zwirner, sold on the first day for $500,000).\n\nSculptural presentations tend to be more radical. Stuart Shave’s Modern Art intriguingly groups artists who test the limits of informality and non-traditional materials within a rigorously abstracting, post-minimal aesthetic: Karla Black’s foil and nail varnish “Living Conditions”, Eva Rothschild’s steel and lacquer “Hansel and Gretel”, Bojan Sarcevic’s burning candle on onyx “Tridiminished”, the mix of charcoal drawings with plaster and fibreglass in Matthew Monahan’s gently Gothic column “A Certain Time of You”.\n\nArgentinian sculptor Adrián Villar Rojas was all but unheard of in London until his theatrical exhibition, focused on a charging elephant, opened last month at the new Serpentine Sackler Gallery. At Marion Goodman and Kurimanzutto he balances this figurative work by more abstract clay and concrete pieces, at once strong and fragile-looking, surfaces gnarled and cracked, which seem to belong to a fossilised jungle (the large looping, circular piece at Marion Goodman is called “Innocence of Animals”). Rare, delicately inky works on paper evoke ruined cityscapes. A sort of visual descendant of Borges and García Marquez, Villar Rojas drowns out the hype and sales pitches here with a vibrant magical realism making him the un-\n\nexpected, very popular star of Frieze 2013.\n\n==========\n\nFINANCIAL TIMES LONDON\n\nPAD London – report\n\nBy Caroline Roux\n\nThis user-friendly fair joyfully mixes decorative arts and design with fine art\n\nThomas Lemut armchair from Fumi\n\nIf visitors to the Pavilion of Art and Design (PAD), which takes place in a Mayfair marquee during Frieze week, are in any doubt as to what to do with their high design purchases when they get them home, Timothy Jeffries has the answer. Jeffries, the director of photography specialists Hamiltons Gallery, has kitted out his booth at the fair as a Belgravia sitting room – all velvety brown walls and classy Irving Penn photographs. But then, with a nod to more decadent tastes, he has furnished a dimly lit back room with black brick walls and Araki imagery of complicated bondage techniques, where trussed-up women gazed balefully down onto a black leather Mies van der Rohe daybed. A large-scale Richard Avedon is hung at the perfect height to allow contemplation of 1990s supermodel Stephanie Seymour’s carefully topiaried pubic hair.\n\nThe booth’s design is more sad than erotic, suggesting a world in which sex is more likely a transaction than a pleasure. And it isn’t representative of a fair whose annual mission is joyfully to mix 20th-century and contemporary decorative arts and design with fine art in a “do try this at home” kind of way (assuming your home is an airy apartment in the 7th arrondissement, or a duplex on the Upper East Side).\n\nDealers love the London edition of PAD, a Parisian product that’s now onto its seventh year in the UK. With just 60 galleries, largely of European and US origin (though this year SMOGallery from Beirut joined in), it attracts the high rollers who are in town for Frieze Week.\n\nIf Frieze Masters is about connoisseurship and Frieze London about the highly competitive collecting of the contemporary art world, PAD is about comfort and shopping, and the booths are organised accordingly. At Stockholm gallery, Modernity, a pair of Alvar Aalto gleaming black Paimio chairs sit on a stunning rug by Marta Maas Fjetterstrom (an underrated designer of the 1920s and 1930s, though this carpet was posthumously made in the 1950s).\n\nAt the Downtown, from Paris, a serious sofa and chairs by Jean Royère, created for a Paris apartment in the 1960s, are shown off against a cream rug, while a stunning Royère lighting arrangement (“Liane”), of seven white shades on meandering black stalks, creeps up an adjoining wall.\n\nLondon art dealer Robin Katz, a tub-thumper for 1960s and 1970s British artists including Bridget Riley and neglected talents such as Bob Law (“I feel quite patriotic about bringing this work back to people’s attention,” Katz said), has furnished his stall with a Nakashima coffee table and a “school of Rietveld” chair. “The furniture’s not for sale,” he said. “I just like being an interior decorator for a week.”\n\nThe New York gallery Van de Weghe adjusted its set economically too, showing a suite of recent Ross Bleckner paintings at around $100,000. The same gallery is showing Picasso’s “Nue Allongée” (1968) on its Frieze Masters stand at $8m.\n\nThe PAD formula certainly works. On the opening night alone, sales were ridiculously brisk. Fumi was relieved of a Rowan Mersh shell sculpture and a jesmonite table by Studio Portable within minutes. A brilliant green table by Marc Newson (at €300,000) was snapped up from Galerie Kreo, Paris’s most sophisticated design gallery, along with vintage Gio Ponti mirrors and work by the Campana Brothers. A sleek, masculine carbon fibre shelving piece by Pierre Charpin was under consideration by several buyers. “This really is a commercial fair,” said Clemence Krentowski, the elegant Alaia-clad co-director of Kreo. “The user is at the centre of all this work. Sure, it’s nice if there’s a story behind the piece, but this,” she pointed to the Charpin, “is still a shelf. Otherwise, we’d be at Frieze.”\n\nNot that useability is always the goal. An unlikely new arrival at the fair is the Paris-based Jean-Christophe Charbonnier, specialist in 17th- to 19th-century Japanese armour. Glossy helmets in iron and lacquer sell for £24,000-£60,000 and are proving to have crossover appeal with design-oriented buyers seduced by their sculptural form and exquisite execution.\n\nNext spring, PAD will make its first foray to Los Angeles, and Gregory Gatseralia of SMOGallery has already signed up. “I’m excited about it,” he said. “I’m waiting for Brad Pitt to come along and buy something.” If LA is anything like London, the chances are reasonably high.\n\n========\n\nJeff Koon’s Tweekie Pie\n\n======\n\nFINANCIAL TIMES LONDON\n\nFrieze Masters, Regent’s Park, London – report\n\nBy Jackie Wullschlager\n\nThe fair’s second edition encapsulates 21st-century shifts in taste and taste-making\n\nMonet’s ‘L’église de Varengeville; soleil couchant’ (detail) (1882), unseen for more than a century, is at Dickinson\n\nWho needs museums with walls when a pop-up version in a Regent’s Park tent makes art look fresher, brighter and more surprising than it does in any public institution?\n\nUnrivalled among fairs worldwide for its quality, range, seductive displays and scholarly interest, Frieze Masters is an emblem of 21st-century shifts in power, as private galleries rather than museums increasingly determine currents of taste, how we experience art, and historical interpretations of it.\n\nThe fair has grown up since last year’s launch. The jumble of top-class works from ancient times to 2000 still delights: a small pink-hued Tang dynasty “Pottery Figure of a Court Lady” at Ben Jannssens, a gorgeous off-kilter Cézanne cupid at Acquavella, and Lisson’s theatrically recreated Richard Long walking piece are formally and emotionally arresting highlights. But the overall feel is more serious, less showy, with many galleries attempting to dig deeper, stake significant positions and juxtapose old and new in revealing not gimmicky ways – Jackson Pollock’s early drawings alongside the tribal masks that inspired them at Washburn Gallery and Donald Ellis; Leon Kossoff’s tensely wrought charcoal/oil versions of Old Master suffering (Titian’s “Flaying of Marsyas”, Rembrandt’s “Blinding of Samson”) at Mitchell Innes Nash.\n\nLast year’s high standards have provoked competition to boast trophy pieces, including Monet’s scintillating “L’église de Varengeville, soleil couchant”, from a French private collection, unseen for more than a century, at Dickinson, and Modigliani’s elongated, melancholy “Bride and Groom”, one of only two double portraits the artists ever made, deaccessioned from New York’s Museum of Modern Art and on offer at Landau. Both galleries are new to Frieze, and Robert Landau’s often important works do not reach public eyes as he neither sells nor lends to museums (“they take too long to make up their mind and send 17 committee members to have a look”). Along with an unusual Fauvish Chagall “Still Life” (1911-14) and a rare 1905 Derain “Collioure”, Landau has the monumental, transitional “The Sleepers” (1965), favourite of Picasso’s dealer Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler – it hung above his desk until his death.\n\nThe subject, a naked woman and a black-suited gentleman reclining on the grass, reprises the “Déjeuner sur l’herbe” series but bold facture and slangy language inaugurate Picasso’s late style. The flattened forms and disruptive contrast of curves and angles merging the two bodies were inspired by Japanese erotic prints – such as the elegantly explicit 17th-century woodblock “Scenes of Lovemaking” by Sugimura Jihei, at Sebastian Izzard. Such chancy, do-it-yourself contextualising is a chief pleasure here.\n\nBest stand? Mnuchin Gallery’s mini-retrospective of Willem de Kooning, centred on a sunburst pink/lemon abstraction “Flowers, Mary’s Table”, was the magnet throughout yesterday’s opening. The savage “Woman” series, highly textured sculptures (“Cross-Legged Figure”, “Hostess”) and emptied-out late paintings all excite in London, which seldom sees de Kooning, and missed the reassessments at MoMA’s 2011-12 retrospective.\n\nRunning close for erudite reappraisal and tour-de-force display is Mnuchin’s neighbour, Gmurzynska, which precisely reconstructs a seminal 1947 Wilfredo Lam show, with surrealist compositions hung at crazy angles off the ceiling, and mask-like portraits and “Jungle” paintings playing figuration against abstraction, Picasso against Pollock. Lam, the continent-hopping Cuban communist son of a Chinese railroad worker and African mother, embodied globalisation before the word was invented. He embodies too the nerve centre Frieze Masters aims to hit – blue chip but not fully discovered modernism. A Tate show is under discu\n\nssion.\n\nWho makes history? Increasingly the market – which is why modernism, its nuances still to be negotiated, triumphs in impact and scope here over Old Masters as marvellous as Velázquez’s “Portrait of a Gentleman” (Otto Naumann) and Antonello’s “Madonna” (Moretti), and energises our response to them. Seventeenth-century polychrome wood/silk religious figures at Coll & Cortés look like modern mixed-media installations; austere ancient sculpture at Rupert Wace takes on modern echoes in Hans Josephsohn’s enigmatic stele form (1953) at Hauser & Wirth.\n\nI lost count of the numerous Calders on every aisle – following last year’s sensational six-metre “Rouge triomphante” at Helly Nahmad, Calder is this year’s must-have – but how bizarre to find his abstract metal shapes in primary colours flapping even among the jewel-like Brueghels, Avercamp and 15th-century Master of Schongau at De Jonckheere. Free-floating, upwardly mobile and in august but unexpected company – Calder is the poster-boy for Frieze Masters.\n\n===\n\nTHE GUARDIAN LONDON\n\nFrieze Art Fair: Buyer choice expands from porn and puddles to a Brueghel\n\nWith work of 2,000 artists from galleries worldwide the fair at Regent’s Park, London, attracts collectors with deep pockets\n\nMark Brown, arts correspondent\n\nThe Guardian, Wednesday 16 October 2013 13.47 EDT\n\nJeff Koons’ Cat on a clothes line (yellow), on show at the Frieze Art Fair this week. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian\n\nIt is chucking it down in Regent’s Park, cars are splashing pedestrians, expensive frocks and suits are getting drenched. And, once you are inside the UK’s biggest commercial art fair, you can add to the experience by buying your own dirty black puddle.\n\nEach one of Marlie Mul’s resin and sand hyperreal puddles would cost you €4,000 (£3,400)from the Frieze stand belonging to Fluxia, a young gallery based in Milan.\n\nIf you are not interested in splashing out on a puddle, then there are a further 151 contemporary art galleries displaying works in the vast tent that has appeared in the London park for the past 10 years.\n\nAs thousands descend on the fair – some buying, an awful lot more wishing they had the money to buy – hundreds of other galleries and museums open shows and have parties all over the capital. It is an art equivalent of the Japanese cherry blossom.\n\nThis year’s Frieze is as dizzying and as diverse as ever. You can see astonishingly expensive works by Jeff Koons (“We don’t release prices to the press,” a Gagosian gallerist sniffed); and you can see far, far more affordable works by the possible next generation – for example post-graduate Goldsmiths students Sam Keogh and Joseph Noonan-Ganley, on display at Kerlin Gallery‘s stand.\n\nAnd you can see porn. There are content warning notices but it is very easy to stumble into a screening of Omer Fast’s Everything That Rises Must Converge, a four-channel film exploring the everyday and often ordinary lives of four hardcore porn film performers. It is being seen for the first time and does not spare viewers the graphic detail “although one of the things we found very compelling is the banality of the day at work”, said Euridice Arratia of Berlin gallery Arratia Beer. “They are very regular people, there is an unexpected normality.”\n\nArratia conceded it is a difficult work to sell – you would need €65,000 – but she hopes people will come and sit down and watch it.\n\nA rather less in your face film is on display at Kate MacGarry’s gallery stall. Marcus Coates – one of the artists shortlisted to be next up on London’s Fourth Plinth – has made a film about hospice patient Alex.\n\nAlthough the view is only from his window, the story is an epic one in that Alex told Coates he had always wanted to go the Amazon but obviously could not now – so could the artist go, which he did.\n\n“It is a very moving film,” said MacGarry. “It is a very strong work which says a lot about Marcus’s wider practice.”\n\nAlso on display are National Geographic-style photographs Coates has made of birds and animals and then screwed up and let unravel. Each are in an edition of three and would cost you £4,500.\n\nShould visitors need a break from the crowds and intensity of Frieze, a good place could be a curvy glass pavilion installed as the only exhibit for the Lisson Gallery. Called Groovy Spiral, visitors are encouraged to walk into it.\n\nLisson’s Ossian Ward said the work was a “people-watching experience. You feel like you’re in the calm in the middle of the storm and you’re on show as well. It is a nice place to be.”\n\nIt is a meditative work, on Wednesday still for sale for $600,000 (£375,000). Ward said: “You don’t get many moments for reflection at an art fair generally, a lot of what you see gets immediately forgotten, so it’s nice to have that one moment. Frieze has matured so galleries should mature with the fair and feel confident to do big and bold statements and not feel they just have to chase after the money.”\n\nFrieze gets criticised because it is a place for conspicuous wealth and there may well will be oligarchs and hedge funders walking the aisles idly wondering what best to spend their millions on.\n\nMatthew Slotover, fair co-founder, believes some of the criticisms are unfair.”Some of the prices can get very high and if you don’t like that then this is probably not the place for you,” he said. “For me it is a wonderful thing that private collectors and museums buy art and support living artists so they can carry on making their work.\n\n“Also commercial galleries all over the world offer hundreds of free shows every month.”\n\nWith 2,000 artists at the fair it is also “an amazing opportunity to see a lot of what is going on”.\n\nHe said a lot more big collectors were present this year, helped by the successful debut last year of a parallel fair for historical art called Frieze Masters, 15 minutes walk away in the park’s north-west corner.\n\nHere 130 galleries are selling their wares. For €22,000 you might be tempted by a Polynesian toggle, or for $1.5m an insanely kitsch example of Victorian narrative art, John Anster Fitzgerald’s painting of Shakespeare’s Bottom surrounded by fairies.\n\nOr even a beautiful Brueghel winter scene, called The Census at Bethlehem, which, remarkably, was unknown and unrecorded until it was unveiled this week. The painting has been in the same family since it was bought direct from the artist’s studio in 1611 and for the past 60 years has been in east Africa. “When we took it off the\n\nwall a mummified gecko fell off the stretcher,” said Johnny Van Haeften, the Old Master dealer selling it.\n\nIt is Van Haeften’s first Frieze – “I saw all my clients here last year and thought I’d better come” – and he is encouraged. “People who collect modern art are now beginning to look back at Old Masters which are so much cheaper by comparison. This is a great masterpiece by Brueghel and it is £6m – what does that buy you in contemporary art?”\n\n• Fairs open to the public 17-20 October.\n\n========\n\nDB ARTMAG 77\n\nJubilee in Regent’s Park: 10th Year of Deutsche Bank’s Partnership with Frieze London\n\nMathilde ter Heijne, Woman to Go, 2003–.

Frieze has had Deutsche Bank as its partner since its second edition. As every year, Deutsche Bank will be present at the fair, with a lounge in which it will show works from its collection. This year, the focus is on the feminist postcard installation Woman to Go by Mathilde ter Heijne. For this project the Dutch artist, to whom an entire floor of the Deutsche Bank Towers is devoted, researched the biographies of around 300 forgotten women. They are artists, pirates or suffragettes who fell victim to male-dominated historiography. On the postcards, per Heijne combines their extraordinary biographies with historical portraits of unknown women. Visitors to the lounge are invited to take postcards with them, as a piece of history and as inspiration for the present. Special versions of the installation were also created for the ArtMag stands at the Frieze Art Fair and the Frieze Masters. Here too visitors can take postcards. At these stands, new subscribers to the magazine also receive a bag printed with a Woman to Go motif.The fair’s recipe for success includes setting standards not merely as a marketplace, but also as a cultural platform. Frieze has always been a fair for important collectors, but it’s also a public event that over 60,000 visitors now flock to each year. This year, the fair presents itself in Regent’s Park with even more space than before, in a new architectural setting designed by the London agency Carmody Groarke, which has been responsible for the design of the tents since 2011. Once again, over 150 international galleries are taking part. Among the new participants are big names like Blum & Poe (Los Angeles) and Max Hetzler (Berlin), as well as newcomers such as Rodeo of Istanbul, which has previously taken part in the young section Frame and is now conquering the main fair.Frieze Projects has always been one of the fair’s highlights. This year, curated by Nicola Lees, these commissioned works will be even more interdisciplinary in nature than before. Already as curator at the Serpentine Gallery alongside Hans-Ulrich Obrist, she encouraged artists to experiment with a wide variety of media. Now, Lees has invented a new format for Frieze: for the first time, invited artists present their works on a modular stage designed by Andreas Angelidakis that will change on a daily basis. Rivane Neuenschwander, whose works occupy an entire floor in the Deutsche Bank Towers in Frankfurt, includes the audience in her performance, playing off one of her most recent installations, The Conversation (2010), which was inspired by Coppola’s surveillance thriller of the same name. Gerry Bibby’s performance series is also based on the idea of participation. Here, however, the main roles are played by fair staff and a pile of oysters that are consumed. And in the work of Ken Okiishi, it’s robots that intermingle with the public.Only a few minutes away on foot from Frieze London, Frieze Masters shows art from antiquity to the 20th century—from a contemporary perspective. Deutsche Bank is also partner to this fair. Its extraordinary quality and unique mix of various epochs already met with overwhelmingly positive resonance last year. Once again, around 120 of the leading galleries and art traders worldwide will come to London. Here, too, the fascination derives from the relationship to contemporary art. This can be seen in the Frieze Masters Talks, in which artists like John Currin, Beatriz Milhazes, and Catherine Opie talk to directors and curators over the influence historical works have exerted on their art.Frieze London & Frieze Masters\n\nOctober 17–20, 2013\n\nRegent’s Park, London\n\n====\n\nDAZED DIGITAL\n\nFrieze London: the must-sees\n\nThe best of the best contemporary art from in and around Frieze London this weekend\n\nYesterday\n\nText Susanna Davies-Crook\n\nSITUATION Absolute Beach Man Rubble\n\nIn the most eagerly anticipated institutional show for quite some time, Sarah Lucas‘ YBA upbringing matures to form an important and ever-relevant legacy. All the usual features apply – the stuffed nylon tights, the breezeblock plinths – alongside the old guard that made her name – the two fried eggs, the bucket and cucumber. Lucas, as the self-styled bad girl of British art proves she’s still got it and in this case shows the next generation of DM wearing wanna-be-bad-girl-artists how to play with the big boys. Whitechapel disclaimer: ‘the exhibition contains sexually explicit materials and is not recommended for children’.\n\nClick here to read Susanna Davies-Crook’s interview for Dazed Digital with Sarah Lucas and Has Ulrich Obrist.\n\nWhitechapel Gallery, 2 October – 15 December 2013\n\nFRIEZE ART FAIR\n\nThe indominable art fair of our time once again sprawls it’s stud-walled tendrils across Regent’s Park. The highlights this year are happening in parallel to the galleries’ booth presentations in the various curated Frieze programmes that seem to exponentially grow year on year. Within ‘Frieze Focus’ Omer Fast presents ‘Spam Atlas’, a new work which starts with an email describing a financial opportunity resulting from the death of a lonely but very wealthy person, next to Trevor Paglen’s ‘Non-functional Satellite’ that could be viewed from Earth as a flickering star or up close as a sail-like minimalist sculpture, created for the purpose of entering orbit then burning up without trace. In ‘Frieze Film’ Petra Cortright presents her internet-inspired, experimental software videos whilst over in ‘Frieze Masters’ Victoria Miro gallery lodges Alice Neel in the macho narrative of ‘master’ artists. In the section reserved for developing galleries, Pilvi Takala at Carlos Ishikawa London presents a project inspired by infiltrating ‘college moms’; the wives of faculty staff on US college campuses.\n\nGCC Achievements in Swiss Summit, 2013\n\nProject Native Informant\n\nGCC are a collective founded in 2013 of artists that including the multi-talented musician and artist and Fatima Al Qadiri alongside Abdullah Al-Mutairi, Amal Khalaf, Aziz Al Qatami, Barrak Alzaid, Khalid al Gharaballi, Monira Al Qadiri, Nanu Al-Hamad and Sophia Al Maria. This exhibition acts as a fortification of their collaborative practice which first and foremost aims to ‘effect collaboration, transformation and inter-connection between Artists in all fields in order to achieve unity between them’. Drawing on diplomatic protocols, ceremonial pomp and accomplishments made during the GCC collective’s first meeting in Morschach, Switzerland. ‘this show represents the official Communiqué of the cooperative: a High Level Strategic Dialogue’.\n\nDuring Frieze week, the exhibition will additionally be open Sunday and Monday, 20 – 21 October 2013 12:00 – 18:00 and by appointment.\n\nFlorence Peake, Michael Dean, Juliette Blightman and Rodney Graham\n\nDavid Roberts Art Foundation\n\nThe gallery transforms from it’s daytime persona as the host of current Orpheus Twice exhibition into the setting for a performance of new work by 4 artists. Florence Peake presents a double duet new movement work followed by ‘an act’ by Michael Dean that poetically introduces itself, ‘How inanimate that alphabet. With the policy of its use in its face. A demonstration of the letter n for you. You user with your policies.’ Juliette Blightman presents a characteristically subtle new work ‘Between Acts’ and finally Rodney Graham plays his psychedelic ‘Softcore – More Solo Guitar Music for the Sex Scene, Zabriskie Point’.\n\nFree admission. 7pm\n\nPost-Net Aesthetics\n\nICA\n\nIn a week when the art world comes to town, it’s important to get some perspective. This talk investigates the roots, developments and outcomes of the term ‘post-internet’, drawing together Arcadia Missa’s Rozsa Farkas, artis tHarm van den Dorpel (who recreated the Game of Thrones throne in his berlin space amongst other things), Ben Vickers and editor of Mute Magazine Josephine Berry-Slater. A good line-up if you’re interested in unravelling the intricacies of the much-bandied, slippery and potentially soon to be canonised term ‘post-internet’ and further conceptualising the ‘post-net aesthetic’.\n\nShowing 17 October 2013, 4pm\n\nCory Arcangel\n\nDances for Electric Piano\n\nBringing his blend of tech-pop, computer-game-fetishist music-heavy art to the ICA, Cory Arcangel presents a new ‘suite’ of piano compositions . Arcangel aficionados be not afeared, the music in question will be performed solo by John Reid on a Korg M1 electric piano, an instrument made famous by it’s late 80s influence on classic rave and trance. This event comprises part of the 25 frames season by Film & Video Umbrella.\n\nShowing at London’s ICA on 18 October 2013, 8pm\n\nSunday Art Fair\n\nIn the tradition of the namesake day of the week, Sunday is a more chilled out affair, and an increasingly welcome and inspiring accompaniment to Frieze booth mania. Adding new blood and backbone to the Frieze train in it’s fourth incarnation, Sunday invites younger galleries which in turn means that for the most part the artists shown are ones to watch / next big things / bright young things. New this year are LA’s FreedmanFitzpatrick at only their second ever fair exhibiting Mathis Altmann & Lucie Stahl, and Berlin’s charge-leading Kraupa-Tuskany-Zeidler showing Dazed faves Katja Novitskova and Avery Singer.\n\nShowing at London’s Ambika P3 17 – 20 October 2013\n\nAndy Holden @ Zabludowicz Collection\n\nMaximum Irony! Maximum Sincerity, 1999-2003: Towards a Unified Theory of MI!MS\n\nThe Music of MI!MS – a short lived art movement established by Holden during his teenage years in Bedford – will be performed, this time inviting The Grubby Mitts and Johnny Parry Orchestra to add their own spin on things. An experimental live set combine with video and spoken word in a half-remembered nostalgic investigation of irony, sincerity and teenage intellectual dilemmas oddly in tune with the zeitgeist of the time and America’s David Foster Wallace inspired ‘New Sincerity’. The event takes place alongside Andy Holden‘s room-filling three storey installation containing environments and assemblages of ephemera that influenced the artist as a teenager.\n\nFriday 18 October 2013 8-11pm\n\nJuneau Projects\n\nHappy Redoubt Robot Racing\n\nA bit of light entertainment infused with art intellectualism, this robot contest comprises one of the events leading up to Juneau Projects forthcoming exhibition ‘Welcome to Happy Redoubt’. Betting on a robot will result in (hopefully) winning tokens, which can then be later spent throughout November in the artist duos’ ‘interactive post-apocalyptic encampment’, inspired by sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson’s concept of the ‘infocalypse’. The installation will boast its own marketplace which will expose systems, create new mechanisms and challenge obsolescence.\n\nWednesday 16th October 8-9pm\n\nThis event is free and open to all but booking is required\n\nWelcome to Happy Redoubt (6 November – 15 December 2013)\n\nMorris Louis, Cyprien Gaillard\n\nSprüth Magers\n\nFor his Frieze week solo exhibition, the French-born but Berlin-based enfant terrible of legendary beer-tower-sculpture fame pairs himself with another risk-taker of the avante-garde, colour field pioneer Morris Louis. Gaillard’s interventions in images from an archive of National Geographic catalogs refashioned into glueless wave collages, weave through a history of colour, representation and evolution. His bronze ‘Fence (after Owen Luder)’ security barrier exchanges knowing glances with Morris’ 1958 work ‘Beth Samach’. In dialogue with Morris, Gaillard investigates ruins and trace, disintegration and desolation.\n\nOct 15th – November 16th 2013\n\n========\n\nTHE AGE – NATIONAL\n\nA woman poses for a photograph in front of artwork by Jeff Koons at the Frieze London art fair on October 16, 2013 in London, England.

Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian\n\nI have had a tango alone in a darkened room with nothing but a portrait of Marilyn Monroe for company (this sort of thing I can do almost as well at home). I have tracked a pool of ink across nice grey floors, and almost been splatted by paintballs. I have eyed up a dangling noose, but it looks like someone else has already tried Elmgreen & Dragset‘s gibbet (the frayed rope lies useless on the floor). That was when I climbed back into the womb to try to escape, only to be pounced on by a gang of paparazzi. All this, and I’ve only been at Frieze for two hours. I do so love an art fair.\n\nFrieze\n\nRegent’s Park,\n\nLondon\n\nUntil 20 October\n\nMore details\n\nOnce more into the killing fields! The artists represented by London’s Limoncello gallery hang around its stand, waiting for someone to chat them up, or possibly buy them. People are so much more fun than art – and by and large self-cleaning. Nearby, at Fluxia (over from Milan), puddles of black goo sit on the floor, with decorative bits of binbag and weeds mired in the stickiness. What would one do with these cowpat-sized objects? Or with the giant black foil rock that hangs from the ceiling of a Berlin stand? I guess you could position yourself under it, so it looks like a “thinks” bubble, to signal your bad mood.\n\nDunno, by Urs Fischer, 2012. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the GuardianAt Sadie Coles, Urs Fischer‘s giant fried egg lies on the carpet, perfectly cooked, but out of scale to any but the most gargantuan appetite (and everybody knows collectors only peck at things, their appetites reserved only for beefed-up art).\n\nArt fairs may be all the same, filled with schlock, shiny things, grim things, and things that make you wonder why galleries across the globe bothered to drag them all the way here, but there’s always something to brighten your day as you wander the aisles. The 11th incarnation of Frieze is more manageable than most, with better lighting, wider aisles and a bigger spread of behemoth mega-galleries and startup spaces, young galleries and old lags. Not that the art is necessarily better, though the galleries seem to be trying harder this year.\n\nNow for a nice lie down. In the Project Space, a fountain in the middle of a bed spouts black ink on to the white sheets, and on to the book being read aloud by Lili Reynaud-Dewar, nestling on the plumped-up pillows. It’s\n\na dirty book anyway, In My Room by Guillaume Dustan, and as she reads the line, “I was lying on the bed jerking off, smoking a joint” in a delicate voice, the artist starts getting spattered, too. More ink leaks from the pump beneath the bed and oozes over my shoes. I like to get up close and personal at fairs. It’s the only way to focus.\n\nRather than the usual collection of cash-cow artists, Lisson shows a single work, a huge spiral Plexiglas corridor by veteran American artist Dan Graham. You wander in to the middle, view the passing crowds through the curving walls, then walk out again, refreshed. It is an oasis. Nearby, at Gavin Brown, two lovely nocturnal cityscapes by Alex Katz, with lit windows on a dark New York night, look over Rob Pruitt’s mad, humanoid fluorescent orange traffic cones. This is fun. Round the corner is another big Katz, of buildings in a blizzard. It is magical.\n\nCat on a Clothes Line (Yellow), by Jeff Koons, 1994-2001. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the GuardianFinding things that stop you in your tracks here is easy, but mostly for the wrong reasons. You tend to gawp, incredulous. There are a great many overblown stupidities here, the sort that only seem to come out at art fairs. You could count Jeff Koons‘s huge wrapped bouquet and his cute pussy-in-a-sock sculpture among these, though there are many who see his work as a Duchampian critique of excess.\n\nJennifer Rubell’s giant, reclining, all-white Portrait of the Artist has a large sculpted hollow for a womb. You can climb in and curl up, in full view of the passing trade. As a serious art critic, I felt it my duty to get on board. What would you do with a thing like this? Where would anyone keep it? Why? Do not ask.\n\nAt Michael Werner, four people huddle together, all enveloped in one big black dress, a 1967 work by the late James Lee Byars. How these people keep themselves amused all day every day at Frieze is a mystery. Are they naked under there?\n\nOn Juana de Aizpuru’s stand, Tania Bruguera has reproduced the infamous Nazi “Arbeit macht frei” sign from Auschwitz concentration camp. The original was stolen in 2009 (it has since been recovered). Bruguera’s copy leans in a corner, surrounded by metal-cutting tools. The artist wishes, apparently, to reference historical memory.\n\nNever a great context for looking at anything, fairs are more and more the places where collectors congregate and buy. In an unfortunate juxtaposition, a drawing of a lemon by Mike Kelley hangs over the sign referencing the song by Led Zeppelin about squeezing my lemon till the juice runs down my leg. For some reason, all this upset me, but only for a moment. After a bit, you just stop caring.\n\nLe Monde en Miniature et la Mode en Miniature, by Meschac Gaba, 2008. Photograph: S/arah Lee for the Guardian\n\nWhat is the right context for Bruguera’s sign? Everything becomes a hostage to fortune here. You have to be open to the absurd. At Stevenson, from South Africa, Meschac Gaba shows an array of children’s clothes, all embroidered with volatile French words: Kalachnikov. Inceste. Pédophilie. Prison. Slavery. Sida (Aids). Terroriste. In part, this is a play on shop displays, and the kinds of signage kids all over the world wear on their clothing. But this is more about the signs people don’t wear. These words are labels that float about and sometimes stick.\n\nYou have to keep moving, stay a moving target. Swivel-eyed dealers wait to pounce. Here’s a Gerhard Richter, there’s a room of shouty Julian Schnabel paintings, now a sculpture of a squatting woman delivering a very small poo, by David Shrigley. And over there, a thing that looks like art but probably isn’t. This time next year, it will be forgotten, probably in a collector’s warehouse somewhere. At Laura Bartlett Gallery, gigantic currency notes lie framed on the floor. Mmmm, smell that money – but watch out for the cowpats.\n\n=====\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nKoons Leads $2 Billion Art-Market Test for Frieze Week\n\nLondon’s Frieze Week starts today with a record 10 fairs, about as many auctions and numerous dealer shows boosting the value of the art on sale to as much as $2 billion.\n\nFrieze Art Fair in Regent’s Park opens to VIP visitors tomorrow and attracts billionaires looking for new art stars and established names.

The search for the next superstar is gathering momentum. Secondary market prices are astronomical.”\n\nFrieze and its offshoots have grown into the biggest seven-day concentration of art-market events in any European capital. Also opening today are the Pavilion of Art + Design in Berkeley Square and the inaugural 1:54 fair of contemporary African art at Somerset House.\n\nStarting tomorrow, Phillips, Sotheby’s (BID) and Christie’s International will be offering more than 900 works of postwar and contemporary art valued at as much as 152.9 million pounds ($245 million).\n\nBalloon Dog\n\nThe Koons works at Gagosian’s Frieze booth include the stainless steel “Sacred Heart (Blue/Magenta), (1994-2007), part of the U.S.-based artist’s “Celebration” series. Gagosian never discloses prices to the media. A version of “Balloon Dog” from the series is estimated to sell for between $35 million and $55 million at Christie’s New York next month.\n\nA recent painting by Colombian-born Oscar Murillo, priced at as much as $150,000, will be shown at Frieze by the New York-and London-based dealer David Zwirner.\n\nTwo years ago, paintings by Murillo, who has a London studio, could be bought for less than $3,000. He is now hailed by some as the new Jean-Michel Basquiat. One of his abstracts sold for a record $401,000 at Phillips New York on Sept. 19.\n\nHauser & Wirth will show U.S.-based Sterling Ruby’s 2013 spray paint-on-canvas “SP246,” priced at $550,000, typifying the upper price levels at a fair that specializes in works by younger, living artists. More valuable works by dead artists, stretching back to Old Masters and beyond, will be shown today at the second edition of Frieze Masters.\n\nOld Master\n\nThe event has been bolstered by the arrival of heavyweight exhibitors such as the London-based Old Master specialist Johnny van Haeften, and New York’s Mnuchin and Dominique Levy galleries, who will bring big-ticket 20th-century classics.\n\n“The fair has reinvigorated interest in people coming to London for this week,” says the dealer Thomas Dane, who is exhibiting at both Frieze events. “Masters is more of an adventure, and hopefully the connoisseurship we see at that event will spill over into Frieze.” He has a 1950s Lucian Freud drawing ofFrancis Bacon, priced at 1.3 million pounds.\n\nThe Pavilion of Art + Design London, a fair of 60 dealers held in a temporary structure near Claridge’s and the Connaught hotels, includes a white single-cut Lucio Fontana “Concetto Spaziale, Attesa,” priced at 6 million euros ($8.15 million) on the booth of the London dealer Ben Brown Fine Arts. Paris-based Galerie Applicat-Prazan will be showing a 1953 Pierre Soulages abstract at 3.5 million euros.\n\nThe main innovation of this year’s Frieze Week is the first 1:54 fair devoted to contemporary African art with 15 dealers.\n\nThe fair will include photographs by Angola’s Edson Chagas, who won the Golden Lion for his nation’s pavilion at the Venice Biennale in June. The London-based Jack Bell Gallery will be showing art made of weapons from the Mozambique civil war by Goncalo Mabunda. Prices for the artist range from 5,000 pounds to 14,000 pounds.\n\n===\n\nFrieze art fair 2013: 10 things to see\n\nFrom a retrospective by art’s king of pop, Jeff Koons, to a video laying bare the porn industry, via a collection of Matisse masterpieces, here’s what to seek out at Frieze\n\ntheguardian.com, Wednesday 16 October 2013 06.32 EDT\n\nPop star … Jeff Koons’s Sacred Heart (Blue/Magenta). Click to enlarge\n\n1) Shiny happy people\n\nNo one sums up big-money art-fair glamour like Jeff Koons. The pop-art superstar and master of shiny surfaces shows key works from the last two decades here. Expect hisSacred Heart, wrapped in blue foil like a chocolate, and his Lobster, which masquerades as a party balloon.\n\nFrieze: Jeff Koons, Gagosian Gallery\n\n2) 24 hours as a porn star\n\nOmer Fast’s X-rated video Everything That Rises Must Converge is a must-see. It’s a bare-all look at the LA porn industry, showing 24 hours in the life of real porn stars. But Fast, who’s never one to keep things simple, has interwoven the sex with stories of illegal immigration and dinosaur egg theft.\n\nFrieze Focus: Omer Fast, Arratia Beer Gallery\n\n3) The art of paintballing\n\nKen Okiishi’s paintballing should be the ultimate splatterfest: a carnival-style shooting gallery, with paint guns aimed at canvases. But instead of visitors having to put down their champagne and get their hands dirty, little remote controlled robots – pet-sized takes on drones, perhaps – will bomb their targets while filming, then mop up their own mess.\n\nFrieze Special Project: Ken Okiishi\n\n4) Block party\n\nThe theme of this year’s Frieze special projects is “play” – and nothing says play likeJudy Chicago’s Rearrangeable Rainbow Blocks. An early work by the feminist art titan, these supersized building blocks are a prod at macho sculpture. It’s as if some toddler giant has left them in the sculpture park for other overgrown kids to experiment with.\n\nFrieze Sculpture Park: Judy Chicago\n\nDetail from Pivi Takala’s Drive With Care\n\n5) School of thought\n\nPilvi Takala’s video Drive With Care sees the Finnish artist go undercover in an elite US boarding school. What comes across is a Truman Show kind of existence: a self-contained world that the staff rarely leave, and where the “college moms” (faculty wives) spend their days power-walking the grounds.\n\nFrieze Frame and Emdash Award Winner: Pilvi Takala, Carlos Ishikawa Gallery\n\n6) Cover to cover\n\nWhether dancing through galleries naked and doused in paint or working in a glass room in a public park, Lili Reynaud-Dewar is ever the exhibitionist. Her Frieze installation turns an intimate bedroom setting into a public stage. Sitting in a bed gradually soaking herself in ink, she’ll be reading from her favourite autobiographies, including that of French author Marguerite Duras.\n\nFrieze Special Project: Lili Reynaud-Dewar\n\n7) Game theory\n\nThe Brazilian artist Rivane Neuenschwander once got a security firm to bug a gallery then tore up the walls and floors until she’d discovered the secret surveillance devices. For Frieze Projects, her version of Battleships continues the mind games, turning the traditional pastime into an interactive wall installation that visitors can rip through to uncover lurking vessels.\n\nFrieze Project: Rivane Neuenschwander\n\nHenri Matisse’s Tête de jeune fille (1951)\n\n8) Matisse’s many faces\n\nIf you wanted to make a noise at Frieze’s new Masters offshoot, you could scarcely do better than with Matisse. Portraits are the focus of this solo presentation of drawings, paintings and sculptures, which show off his virtuoso technical skills. There’s also the rare chance to see his early bronze nude Olga, with her ingeniously twisting form designed to be appreciated from any angle.\n\nFrieze Masters: Matisse, Thomas Gibson Fine Art Ltd\n\n9) Requiem for a dream\n\nIn the glittery confines of an art fair it’s good to be reminded that culture is about more than cold hard cash. “How can art help people?” is a question that runs deep for Marcus Coates, the eccentric Brit known for his performances dressed as a shaman. A solo show features his standout film and audio work The Trip, created at St John’s Hospice, where he offered to realise a dying patient’s lifelong dream – and ended up travelling to the Amazon.\n\nFrieze: Marcus Coates, Kate MacGarry Gallery\n\n10) Name’s not down, not coming in\n\nRight outside the Frieze tent is a fitting location for Elmgreen & Dragset‘s sendup of hierarchy But I’m on the Guestlist Too!. It’s an oversized VIP glass door that stands alone like a magic portal to an enchanted land – and has its own real-life bouncer.\n\nFrieze Sculpture Park: Elmgreen & Dragset\n\n======\n\nYAREAH\n\nDavid Zwirner at Frieze & Frieze Masters 2013\n\nChris Ofili. Poolside (Crystal), 2012-2013. Oil on linen. 122 1/8 x 78 3/4 inches (310 x 200 cm).\n\nDavid Zwirner will present a range of gallery artists at this year’s Frieze Art Fair (Booth C12). Highlights include the debut of two new paintings by Chris Ofili; works by Adel Abdessemed, whose solo exhibition at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art in Doha, Qatar is on view through January; a painting and works on paper by Tomma Abts; a recent large-scale photograph by Stan Douglas; a concrete and steel sculpture by Isa Genzken, who is the subject of a major retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art in New York opening in November; a painting by Neo Rauch; a selection of works on paper by Raymond Pettibon, whose show To Wit is currently on view at David Zwirner, New York; large-scale photograms by Thomas Ruff; a new painting by Lisa Yuskavage; photographs by Christopher Williams, whose first American museum solo exhibition will open in 2014 at The Art Institute of Chicago and will travel to The Museum of Modern Art, New York; and a new work by Michael Riedel, made especially for the fair and installed on-site by the artist.\n\nAlso featured are new works by the Colombian-born, London-based artist, Oscar Murillo, who recently joined the gallery. He is also part of the fair’s Sculpture Park presentation which takes place in Regent’s Park. There he will debut social anomalies from a factory (2013), a sculpture comprised of a series of stainless steel fruit crates. The artist currently has a solo show at the South London Gallery, where he has also created a unique “lottery ticket” project, and winners will be\n\nchosen on Friday, October 18.\n\nAt Frieze Masters (Booth F11), David Zwirner will present key works by a selection of gallery artists and estates, including Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Gordon Matta-Clark, John McCracken, Fred Sandback, and Al Taylor, as well as Ad Reinhardt, whose work will be on view at the gallery’s new building on West 20th Street in New York in a show curated by Robert Storr featuring black paintings and cartoons; and early works by Yayoi Kusama, who will have her first show with David Zwirner (on West 19th Street in New York) in November, which will feature over 30 large-scale paintings and two infinity rooms. Also on view will be a seminal work by Gerhard Richter; an important painting by Martin Kippenberger along with a suite of “Hotel Drawings” by the artist from the 1980s through 1990s; a large-scale sculpture by John Chamberlain; an early Paßstück by Franz West; and a selection of early works by Bernd and Hilla Becher, Daniel Buren, Joseph Cornell, Konrad Klapheck, and Brice Marden.\n\n===========\n\nLUXURY\n\nWork in progress: American artist Jennifer Rubell poses naked for a digital scanner when eight months pregnant to create a 25ft sculpture to be revealed at Frieze\n\nPicture: Jennifer Rubell c/o Stephen Friedman Gallery\n\nJennifer Rubell ‘Portrait of the Artist’ 2013, steel-reinforced fibreglass, 257 x 719 x 285cm\n\nPicture: Stephen White c/o Stephen Friedman Gallery\n\nLeft; ‘Portrait d’homme’ self portrait by Corneille de Lyon circa 1550.

Ben Brown Fine Arts\n\nPierre Soulages, painting 195 x 130 cm, 1953. Applicat-Prazan\n\nThe tents are up, the stands are hung, and 350 international art dealers have been attending to last-minute niggles at London’s mega fairs – Frieze and Frieze Masters in Regent’s Park, and the Pavilion of Art & Design (PAD) in Berkeley Square – before they open this week. In addition to the £150 million of contemporary art on the auction block, they boast nearer £1 billion of art from all periods for sale.\n\nIn their wake, numerous other events for less expensive art are hoping to catch the attention. Last week, I highlighted the new 1:54 fair for African art. For serious talent-spotters, the small, select and free-entry Sunday Art Fairopposite Madame Tussaud, much favoured by cutting-edge collectors such as Anita Zabludowicz or David Roberts, is recommended.\n\nFor the streetwise, urban look, go to theMoniker Art Fair in Brick Lane, east London, which shares the cavernous Old Truman Brewery space this year with The Other Fair. For lower-priced prints and multiples by emerging and established artists, Multiplied, at Christie’s in South Kensington, is worth a trawl.\n\nAn avalanche of gallery openings includes three of the most sought-after young talent: British artist Hurvin Anderson, who fills both of Thomas Dane’s St James’s galleries with new work, and Americans Jeff Elrod at the Simon Lee gallery in Mayfair and Mark Bradford at the White Cube gallery in Bermondsey. The openings are not for buyers, though, as everything had been sold already.\n\nThe first fair to open its doors, for a select private view on Monday, PAD is perhaps more weighted towards design than art this year. But this allows the viewer space to focus on the art that is there. The modern, post-war era is best represented with an all-white Lucio Fontana painting with Ben Brown (€6 million), an architectural-looking abstract by Pierre Soulages with Galerie Applicat-Prazan (€3.5 million), and Christmas Eve, 1951, the largest early painting, 10 feet in length, by Patrick Heron ever on the market, for which London dealer Offer Waterman will ask a seven-figure sum.\n\nFrieze Masters, which embraces the ancient and the modern, holds it private view this afternoon. Having been adjudged a success in its first year, it has attracted more exhibitors, notably Richard Green, whose range of stock has allowed him to meaningfully juxtapose pairs of still lifes, portraits and landscapes painted 400 years apart but resonating in a way that captures the spirit of the fair completely. The pairing of a 16th-century courtier by Corneille de Lyon with a late self-portrait as a courtly musketeer by Picasso, for instance, is inspired. The differential in prices (£950,000 for the de Lyon to £5.6 million for the Picasso) is not so much to do with size but the general disparity in value today between old and modern masters, says Jonathan Green.\n\nOne of Frieze Masters’ strengths is its single-artist displays. The Mnuchin Gallery from New York, for instance, is bringing an array of de Kooning paintings and sculptures priced from $1 million (£624,000) to $10 million.\n\nMarlborough Contemporary artist Laurence Kavanagh is a fan of the late Victor Pasmore, so he has curated a display of Pasmore’s work (£10,000 to £100,000).\n\nThe original Frieze fair for new art, though, remains the big attraction, striving to enhance the visitor experience this year with less galleries, more public space, and smaller crowds through ticket restrictions. A new, child-friendly element seems to have crept in, with paintball machines making splattered paintings, a show curated by children who were given thousands of pounds to spend, and a multimedia playground for children and adults among the sponsored projects.\n\nBound to attract attention will be a self-portrait sculpture by US artist Jennifer Rubell, who posed naked for a digital scanner when eight months pregnant, reclining like the Velázquez Rockeby Venus. The scans have now been translated into a massive 25ft figure from which the womb has been removed leaving a cavity large enough for an adult to nestle in. The $200,000 interactive fibreglass sculpture, made in an edition of three, will occupy all of the Stephen Friedman gallery stand.\n\nThere might be a rush to the Spruth Magers stand for a new striped-wool work by Rosemarie Trockel, priced at €200,000. Trockel’s recent London show, with prices from €80,000 to €180,000, was a sell-out. But then again, with American debt suddenly threatening to destabilise the global economy, there might be no rush at all.\n\n==========\n\nULTRALIVE\n\nFrieze London 2013 | What’s New This Year\n\nBRIEFING\n\n14th October 2013\n\nTara Pahari\n\nFrieze Art Fair 2012 ©Frieze London\n\nAlbert Oehlen, ‘I 24’ (2011),Courtesy: Albert Oehlen & Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin\n\nFrieze Art Fair is kicking off on Wednesday (VIP Day) including a new curator, sponsor, fair design, and of course some new participating galleries.\n\nKendell Geers, ‘Country of my skull’ (2010), Goodman Gallery\n\nProbably the most noticeable change this year is the layout of the art fair. Working with architects Carmody Groarke, Fri\n\neze London has been made over to give more space for visitors. This will make it much easier to view the featured artworks in comfort and enjoy the fair as much as possible.\n\nCurating the fair this year will be Nicola Lees, who was also on the judging panel at this year’s Emdash Award. Lees has worked for the past five years as Senior Curator of Public Programmes at the Serpentine Gallery in London. She is taking over the role from Sarah McCrory who curated the fair from 2009-2012.\n\nA new and exciting associate sponsor is joining Frieze – Alexander McQueen, who have always been committed to promoting contemporary art. Jonathan Akeroyd, CEO of Alexander McQueen remarked on the sponsorship: ‘Frieze brings together the most exciting galleries from around the globe and Alexander McQueen supports and shares their vision in making contemporary art more accessible and engaging for the public.’\n\nFrieze is notoriously hard for new galleries to get involved with, so it’s a great honour for those who’ve managed it this year: Marian Goodman (New York); Galerie Max Hetzler (Berlin); Goodman Gallery (Johannesburg); Maccarone (New York); Overduin and Kite (Los Angeles); and Rodeo (Istanbul).\n\nRichard Phillips, ‘Sasha II’ (2012), Courtesy: Richard Phillips & Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin © Richard Phillips\n\n=========\n\nBRITISH VOGUE\n\nDay 2: Pilvi Takala\n\nIt’s the stuff of satire. An artist awarded a prestigious art prize by vowing to give her winnings to a group of strangers so that they can produce the work. Even better, the strangers should be aged between eight and 12. Better still, no one has any control as to what they might do with the £7,000 given them.\n\nYet that’s exactly what the creators of the Frieze Foundation’s Emdash Award decided to do when they gave the annual prize to artist Pilvi Takala earlier this summer, thus placing one of the art fair’s biggest site-specific commissions into the hands of a youth centre from Bow. The announcement may have raised a few eyebrows, but the fruit of Takala’s project, The Committee, is officially unveiled this week.\n\nTakala, a slight 32-year-old with an asymmetric blonde fringe and the softest of voices, has a certain childishness about her that perhaps lessens the surprise of her commitment to the project. Originally from Finland, Takala splits her time between Amsterdam and Istanbul, and is known for an almost guerrilla approach to art that has found her gently shaking up “normal” codes of behaviour, using secretly filmed footage, hired actors and a lot of role play. In one of her earliest works, The Trainee, she got a job at Deloitte in Helsinki, only to film herself sitting motionless at her desk for a month. In Bag Lady, she wandered around a shopping precinct in Berlin with a transparent bag laden with cash to gauge how people would treat her: with caution, it transpired.\n\nFor her, the Emdash award has been a chance to steer a group of children towards a joint enterprise that could be both empowering and outside their normal artistic experience. “Of course, if they just wanted to buy several thousand pounds’ worth of balloons and fill a room with them, that would be fine,” she insisted when it was suggested that eight year olds might not be the most responsible curators on earth. “Or they might decide to put all the money towards buying a piece of work and hanging it up. And that would be fine, if that’s what they wanted to do. But you would hope, with a bit of encouragement in a workshop environment, and within a group, that they would realise they had more freedom.”\n\nSo far, so terribly liberal arts. But there’s something rather brilliant in hearing Takala’s earliest interviews with the young team tasked with the project. “We couldn’t buy a house or a building,” explains young Kacey, “because we’d have to share it… and besides, we wouldn’t have enough money.” Another little boy tells her that he’ll “spend the money on a holiday to Jamaica”. A third suggests buying a giant skip and making a swimming pool.\n\nSo, what they did spend it on? The children will reveal all this Saturday. In the meantime, you can follow the countdown at The-committee.org.\n\nWritten by Jo Ellison\n\nDay One: Cyprien Gaillard\n\nThe nomadic French artist Cyprien Gaillard makes a well-timed debut tomorrow as his first London solo show, From Wings to Fins, opens its doors a day before the VIP launch of Frieze Art Fair. With Miuccia Prada, Phoebe Philo and François Pinault on the guestlist of friends and supporters attending this evening’s private view, the unveiling is set to be much more than a warm-up act where critics and collectors are concerned. At just 33, Gaillard arrives fresh from his large-scale exhibition at MoMA’s PS1 gallery in his current hometown, New York – a show that saw him fast-tracked from talented émigré to bankable favourite of the NY art establishment.\n\nGetting up to meet me, he is anything but straight-faced – the famous birthmark that drifts over his right cheek is set within a suntanned complexion. But if the tagline “retrospective” or the attention that hangs over his conspicuously good looks had begun to get on his nerves, this latest smaller show shifts the focus back on to all-new works.\n\n“Come and have a look at this” – he leads me, still smiling, into the semi-private attic room and taps the eyepiece of an antique telescope. I find myself on tiptoe, spying on an empty bottle of rum planted atop the neighbouring office building, almost the unwitting participant in a magician’s trick.\n\nDownstairs, Gaillard’s not-so-everyday observations (spreads of retroNational Geographic magazines assembled into 3D tension collages) are displayed alongside paintings by the deceased painter Morris Louis, whose stained canvasses dominate the elegant shop front of the Dover Street space. His admiration for Louis’ home city of Baltimore and paint-pouring technique lay the common ground for this posthumous co-habitation: the American worked on bended knee to penetrate untreated canvases with streams of colour, while the Frenchman’s fieldwork saw him crouched at road level on Baltimore’s deserted streets, taking rubbings of drain covers.\n\nThis is nevertheless a Cyprien Gaillard show. “From the street you will be able to see this” – he peels the dustsheets off a life-size replica of spiked fencing used to ward off trespassers he “acquired – no, saved” from the wreckage of the Trinity Square car park in Gateshead. I’m elbowed with a reminder that the original piece played a starring role in the 1971 film Get Carter, which is typical of Gaillard’s talent for monkeying around the overlooked c\n\norners of the civilized world in the process of producing serious work. On another wall is a further clue to his current favourite place – a photograph of a dilapidated bench, dedicated to “BALTIMORE. The Greatest City in America”. Pulling the doors closed on the old-fashioned lift, he tells me through the metal gate that he is, however, “happiest on the road”, which will only add to the excitement surroundingFrom Wings to Fins. Catch Cyprien Gaillard while he is in town.\n\nCyprien Gaillard, “From Wings to Fins”, October 15 to November 16, 2013 at Sprüeth Magers London, Spruethmagers.com\n\nWritten by Julia Hobbs\n\n==\n\nWith Stephen Shore talking, Meredith Monk performing, and Ken Okiishi paintballing, this year’s Frieze London is not to be missed. In its 11th edition, Frieze London gathers 150 galleries and works by over 1,000 contemporary artists in Regent’s Park. This year promises a new, more spacious layout and an exciting programme of site-specific installations, talks, films and the nearby Sculpture Park.\n\n1. What? When? Where? How?\n\nFrieze London is an art fair dedicated to contemporary art with a special emphasis on living artists. With a prime location in London’s Regent’s Park, the fair takes place October 17 through Sunday, October 20, 2013. Tickets are limited and must be purchased in advance online or by phone. Buy your tickets here. If you plan to visit both Frieze London and Frieze Masters, save by purchasing a combined ticket.\n\n2. Main, Focus, and Frame\n\nWhile the fair is limited to contemporary art, it’s split further into three sections: a main section with traditional gallery booths and two additional sections that are more limited in scope. Focus includes galleries that have opened since 2001 and have proposed a project specifically for this year’s fair.Frame includes galleries that have been open for under eight years, who will dedicate their booths to solo artist presentations.\n\n3. Alexander McQueen joins Frieze team!\n\nWhile 2013 marks the tenth year of sponsorship by Deutsche Bank, Frieze’s official sponsor, this year Frieze London engaged a new associate sponsor, Alexander McQueen. As part of the sponsorship London’s Alexander McQueen stores will house exhibitions of contemporary art curated by gallery owner and director, Sadie Coles. (Hear from Coles herself about the project here.)\n\n4. Frieze food\n\nFrieze London offers a variety of fine and informal dining options at the fair site. Formal sit-down options include:Arnold & Henderson’s Rochelle Canteen, where guests can enjoy breakfast lunch and dinner as well as a full bar and wine list; Mark Hix, which offers classic British fare and signature dishes as well as oysters and Mark’s own smoked salmon;Caravan, new to the fair, offers fresh, seasonal options and a brunch menu.\n\nInformal and to-go options include: Gail Bakery for coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and salads; La Grotta Ices for ice cream made from fresh, local ingredients in artist-inspired flavors;Moshi Moshi for sushi; Coming Soon Coffee for you art fair caffeine fix. Additionally, Pizza Pilgrims, Pitt Cue, and Yum Bun will be on hand for all comfort food cravings.\n\n5. Frieze Projects\n\nSeven Frieze Projects, specially commissioned works to be included in the fair, have been assigned to seven artists, and will be presented together within Frieze London. The projects are curated by 2013 Frieze London curator Nicola Lees. The projects include:\n\nAndreas AngelidakisAngelidakis was commissioned to create a custom pavilion to house the 2013 Frieze Project activities. Angelidakis’s construction, an island-like platform within the fair space, provides partitions and display surfaces for fellow projects. The work is an assemblage of white block-like modules, at once paying homage to and deconstructing the white cube.\n\nGerry BibbyAfter discovering fragments of oyster shells in the earth at Regent’s Park the Australian artist chose to investigate London’s historical relationship with oysters through a series of performances. A pre-fair performance includes art fair workers eating oysters and leaving piles of oyster shells scattered around the exhibition space. A second performance will last the duration of the fair’s second day and involves collaboration with If I Can’t Dance, I Don’t Want to Be Part of Your Revolution, an Amsterdam-based performance platform.\n\nRivane NeuenschwanderNeuenschwander contributes motivated by her previous work The Conversation(2010). Inspired by Francis Ford Coppola’s 1974 psychological thriller of the same name, the 2010 iteration included a gallery space filled with spying devices. Learn morehere.\n\nKen OkiishiOkiishi’s project is contained within a space with acrylic glass, transparent walls within which he will employ paintballing to create a series of abstract paintings. Additionally, his project will include a participatory performance during the fair, involving humans and robots.\n\nLili Reynaud-DewarReynaud-Dewar’s project coincides with her commitment to only create bedroom pieces in 2013; thus she presents a bedroom installation. She will examine the works of writers who use their own lives as the subject of their work, including Guillaume Dustan’s Dans Ma Chambre (In My Room, 1996).\n\nJosef StrauJosef Strau presents a new series of “Letter Tunnels,” the artist’s interactive letter-shaped structures. Fair-goers are invited to sit on and crawl into the tunnels, where they will encounter audio-, text-, and object-based installations.\n\nFamily Space: Angelo PlessasFor his Frieze Project, Greek artist Angelo Plessas has designed the fair’s Family Space, a first for the fair. The space, titled “The Temple of Play”, is a free, creative playground which will include a schedule of programming including games, performances, and screenings.\n\n6. The Emdash Award: Pilvi TakalaThe Emdash Award funds an emerging artist from outside the UK to create a custom project for Frieze London each year. Finnish artist Pilvi Takala, the winner of this year’s Emdash Award, chose to involve a group of children in the planning\n\nand execution of her project. After selecting several children around the age of 12, Takala will put together workshops during the three months before the fair where they will devise a plan for the project. The artists hopes to demonstrate the potential for children to work collaboratively and as equals. (Learn more inthis interview with Takala.)\n\n7.

In its 11th edition, Frieze London gathers 150 galleries and works by over 1,000 contemporary artists in Regent’s Park. This year promises a new, more spacious layout and an exciting programme of site-specific installations, talks, films and the nearby Sculpture Park.\n\n1. What? When? Where? How?\n\nFrieze London is an art fair dedicated to contemporary art with a special emphasis on living artists. With a prime location in London’s Regent’s Park, the fair takes place October 17 through Sunday, October 20, 2013. Tickets are limited and must be purchased in advance online or by phone. Buy your tickets here. If you plan to visit both Frieze London and Frieze Masters, save by purchasing a combined ticket.\n\n2. Main, Focus, and Frame\n\nWhile the fair is limited to contemporary art, it’s split further into three sections: a main section with traditional gallery booths and two additional sections that are more limited in scope. Focus includes galleries that have opened since 2001 and have proposed a project specifically for this year’s fair.Frame includes galleries that have been open for under eight years, who will dedicate their booths to solo artist presentations.\n\n3. Alexander McQueen joins Frieze team!\n\nWhile 2013 marks the tenth year of sponsorship by Deutsche Bank, Frieze’s official sponsor, this year Frieze London engaged a new associate sponsor, Alexander McQueen. As part of the sponsorship London’s Alexander McQueen stores will house exhibitions of contemporary art curated by gallery owner and director, Sadie Coles. (Hear from Coles herself about the project here.)\n\n4. Frieze food\n\nFrieze London offers a variety of fine and informal dining options at the fair site. Formal sit-down options include:Arnold & Henderson’s Rochelle Canteen, where guests can enjoy breakfast lunch and dinner as well as a full bar and wine list; Mark Hix, which offers classic British fare and signature dishes as well as oysters and Mark’s own smoked salmon;Caravan, new to the fair, offers fresh, seasonal options and a brunch menu.\n\nInformal and to-go options include: Gail Bakery for coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and salads; La Grotta Ices for ice cream made from fresh, local ingredients in artist-inspired flavors;Moshi Moshi for sushi; Coming Soon Coffee for you art fair caffeine fix.

Frieze Projects\n\nSeven Frieze Projects, specially commissioned works to be included in the fair, have been assigned to seven artists, and will be presented together within Frieze London. The projects are curated by 2013 Frieze London curator Nicola Lees. The projects include:\n\nAndreas AngelidakisAngelidakis was commissioned to create a custom pavilion to house the 2013 Frieze Project activities. Angelidakis’s construction, an island-like platform within the fair space, provides partitions and display surfaces for fellow projects. The work is an assemblage of white block-like modules, at once paying homage to and deconstructing the white cube.\n\nGerry BibbyAfter discovering fragments of oyster shells in the earth at Regent’s Park the Australian artist chose to investigate London’s historical relationship with oysters through a series of performances. A pre-fair performance includes art fair workers eating oysters and leaving piles of oyster shells scattered around the exhibition space. A second performance will last the duration of the fair’s second day and involves collaboration with If I Can’t Dance, I Don’t Want to Be Part of Your Revolution, an Amsterdam-based performance platform.\n\nRivane NeuenschwanderNeuenschwander contributes motivated by her previous work The Conversation(2010). Inspired by Francis Ford Coppola’s 1974 psychological thriller of the same name, the 2010 iteration included a gallery space filled with spying devices. Learn morehere.\n\nKen OkiishiOkiishi’s project is contained within a space with acrylic glass, transparent walls within which he will employ paintballing to create a series of abstract paintings. Additionally, his project will include a participatory performance during the fair, involving humans and robots.\n\nLili Reynaud-DewarReynaud-Dewar’s project coincides with her commitment to only create bedroom pieces in 2013; thus she presents a bedroom installation. She will examine the works of writers who use their own lives as the subject of their work, including Guillaume Dustan’s Dans Ma Chambre (In My Room, 1996).\n\nJosef StrauJosef Strau presents a new series of “Letter Tunnels,” the artist’s interactive letter-shaped structures. Fair-goers are invited to sit on and crawl into the tunnels, where they will encounter audio-, text-, and object-based installations.\n\nFamily Space: Angelo PlessasFor his Frieze Project, Greek artist Angelo Plessas has designed the fair’s Family Space, a first for the fair. The space, titled “The Temple of Play”, is a free, creative playground which will include a schedule of programming including games, performances, and screenings.\n\n6. The Emdash Award: Pilvi TakalaThe Emdash Award funds an emerging artist from outside the UK to create a custom project for Frieze London each year. Finnish artist Pilvi Takala, the winner of this year’s Emdash Award, chose to involve a group of children in the planning and execution of her project. After selecting several children around the age of 12, Takala will put together workshops during the three months before the fair where they will devise a plan for the project. The artists hopes to demonstrate the potential for children to work collaboratively and as equals. (Learn more inthis interview with Takala.)\n\n7.

Instead of a large white minimalist tent, housing dozens of international galleries, he arrived at the fair to find a big-top circus tent. Instead of clean, smooth flooring, there was grass.\n\nThe nightmare is telling because art fairs are so often referred to as circuses, garish horror shows of conspicuous consumption. This year, 152 galleries will rent a booth at Frieze and display their wares: artworks created since the year 2000, ranging from traditional paintings to crazy installations that challenge the bounds of what art can be. Rather than the cool Zen of the White Cube, the aisles of the fair are harshly lit and crowded. And the impetus is on selling.\n\nGallerists will hope to woo the mink-wearing, spike-heeled, yacht-owning international elite into buying a Richter or a Hockney. These oligarchs and technocrats and popstars might simply want a painting that matches their kitchen décor. In this way, the fair is a bit like a giant Ikea where nothing is remotely practical or affordable. Alternately, they might want a sculpture that speaks of the bitter existential nothingness of contemporary life. At Frieze, they can have both.\n\nWhy do people buy art? For the rush of acquisition? The pleasure of exercising good taste? Maybe. But they also want a piece of that ephemeral, fiery thing – the force that goes into the creation of a work of art, the power that separates artists from us mere mortals. Inspiration? Genius? The heavenly muse, bottled? It is the quasi-mystical quality of the work of art that persuades collectors to splash the cash. The idea of purchasing meaning rather more than another boring old Bentleys to block up the drive. Plus art can be a really good investment – not that I know from firsthand experience; I’ve never been able to afford it.\n\nLast year, Frieze Masters opened for the first time alongside Frieze London. Frieze Masters sells work from the classical age to the year 2000, featuring 130 galleries. Unlike other fustily traditional fairs around Europe, it seeks to explore the old through the lens of the new. “No one had done this before,” Victoria Siddall, director of Frieze Masters, tells me. “It was incredibly well-received.” Indeed, it was – a huge success with an emphasis on elegant, contemporary curation. The number of galleries wishing to participate in Frieze Masters has doubled this year.\n\nSiddall is particularly excited about a series of Matisse ink drawings from Thomas Gibson Fine Art and erotic Japanese prints from Sebastian Izzard. While the term “Masters” may evoke all that is elitist and exclusionary about art history, pointing to the dominance of dead, white, male artists, 50 per cent of the artists represented in the Spotlight section will be either female or non-Western.\n\nVictoria Miro will be showing an enigmatic range of paintings by the American artist Alice Neel (1907-1984). Overlooked for much of her career, Neel was a committed Leftist and painted street scenes of depression-blighted New York as part of the WPA government-relief programme in the 1930s. She was an important figurative painter, lost amidst a generation of masculine Abstract Expressionists, and rediscovered by the women’s movement in the 1970s. Particularly intriguing is Mimi (1955), an oil on canvas of a woman with smudged, hollow eyes wearing a sunny yellow pencil skirt. The painting is characteristic of Neel’s ghoulish eloquence as a portraitist.\n\n‘The Adorationof the Cage-Fighters’ (2011) by Grayson Perry\n\nLA gallery Blum and Poe will be showing a sculpture called Centred Infinity (1992) by Japanese artist Kishio Suga. Comprised of a metal cross on a wooden board splattered with blue paint, the work "
