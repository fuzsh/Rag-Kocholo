        "text": "<strong>Berrien</strong> <strong>County</strong> <strong>Probate</strong> <strong>Court</strong> <strong>Deceased</strong> <strong><strong>File</strong>s</strong> <strong>File</strong> <strong>Nos</strong>. 1-<strong>11280</strong> 1831- ca. 1930 <strong>Berrien</strong> <strong>County</strong> began creating and keeping <strong>Probate</strong> <strong>Court</strong> files in 1831, the year the county was organized. The files indexed here are stored for the <strong>County</strong> of <strong>Berrien</strong> at the <strong>Berrien</strong> <strong>County</strong> Historical Association in <strong>Berrien</strong> Springs; more recent files are still kept by the <strong>Berrien</strong> <strong>County</strong> <strong>Probate</strong> <strong>Court</strong> office. At minimum, the probate file will give the deceased’s date of death, place of death, names of heirs to the estate, and an inventory of property owned by the deceased. Wills are included if the deceased died testate. Unless the deceased had a parent who was an heir to the estate, the probate file will not usually give the parents’ names, nor will it give the deceased’s place of birth. Essentially, probate court “deceased files” are arranged roughly in order of the date of the subject’s death. In the early years, however, the court clerk attempted to organize the files alphabetically by the first two letters of the deceaseds’ surnames, and later began numbering the files. Because of this, the lowest numbers are not necessarily the first in order of death. For example, Theodore Abbey is listed as file number 1, but he may actually have been predeceased by David Fifield, file number 124, because “A” came before “F” in the original organization. Nevertheless, the file number hints at the date of death. An individual whose file number is 6000, for example, died around 1920, not 1850.
