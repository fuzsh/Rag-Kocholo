        "text": "The Lewis and Clark expedition produced a series of journals of more than one million words, and in the two centuries since the expedition in 1803 to 1806 a flood of books and articles has detailed their travels and travails. In this paper we explore a neglected portion of the expedition: the labels and notes associated with the Lewis and Clark Herbarium, a collection of 222 dried, pressed plants housed in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia herbarium (PH). We also comment on an additional 10 specimens of Lewis that reside at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. This residue of written records includes notes by Meriwether Lewis (primary plant collector on the expedition), Frederick Pursh (German botanist who fi.rst studied the plants), Thomas Meehan (Academy of Natural Sciences botanist who re-discovered the plants in Philadelphia after nearly a century of oblivion in storage), and several other nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first century botanists and other researchers who have found occasion to annotate the specimens. The notes reveal insights into the collection, curation, taxonomy, and research uses of the Lewis and Clark Herbarium during the 200 years since Lewis made his gatherings. Much remains to be learned from a closer study of this little-examined part of the paper trail of Lewis and Clark.\n\nThis paper focuses on the relationship between Alexan-der von Humboldt, the famous German explorer-naturalist and Filippo Parlatore, botanist from Palermo (Sicily, Italy) in the field of botanical geography. Our considerations are based on three letters written by Humboldt to Parlatore in May 1851 and two letters with attachments written by Parlatore in answer to Humboldt in May 1851 and June 1852. The former are preserved in the Biblioteca comunale di Palermo (Palermo City Library) and the latter in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (Berlin State Library). On reading the correspondence it can be inferred how, on the one hand, Humboldt asked Parlatore for verification on some important questions of botanical geography that he intended to cover in the second part (never published) of volume five of his Kosmos, and how, on the other hand, Parlatore diverged in his answers from Humboldt's intent to search for universal laws to explain the distribution of plants on the planet. In fact, Parlatore was engaging in new lines of research, which, though stemming from Humboldt, were moving towards a modern two-dimensional interpretation of natural plant communities according to which vegetation and flora, though interacting, are distinct realities and require different methods of study. The paper includes a portrait of Parlatore and one of Humboldt, a taxonomic table of the plants mentioned by the two scientists in their correspondence and illustrations of a selection of the same plants. Riassunto-Corrispondenza geobotanica tra Alexander von Hum-boldt e Filippo Parlatore (1851-1852). L'articolo sviluppa riflessioni sui rapporti tra il famoso esploratore-naturalista tedesco Alexander von Humboldt e il botanico palermitano Filippo Parlatore nel campo della geografia botanica. Esso si basa su tre lettere (conservate nella Biblioteca comunale di Palermo) scritte da Humboldt a Parlatore nel maggio del 1851 e su due lettere (conservate nella Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin) corredate di altrettanti allegati, inviate da quest'ultimo nel maggio 1851 e nel giugno 1852 in risposta alle precedenti. Dalla lettura del carteggio si evince, da un lato come Humboldt richiedesse a Parlatore il riscontro ad alcune importanti questioni di geografia botanica che intendeva trattare nella seconda parte (rimasta inedita) del quinto volume del suo Kosmos, e dall'altro come Parlatore nelle sue risposte divergesse dall'intento di Humboldt di ricercare per la distribuzione delle piante sul pianeta leggi di carattere universale, e partecipasse invece alle nuove linee di ricerca che, pur prendendo le mosse da Humboldt, si stavano indirizzando verso l'odierna interpre-tazione a due dimensioni delle comunità naturali di piante, in base alla quale vegetazione e flora sono realtà interagenti ma distinte e richie-dono metodi di studio differenti. Corredano il lavoro un ritratto di Parlatore e uno di Humboldt, un prospetto tassonomico delle piante citate dagli autori e alcune illustra-zioni di piante scelte tra quelle citate nel carteggio.\n\nThree particular features of Rousseau’s botanical thought are, I argue, central to Humboldt’s geographical perspective on plants: (1) the observation that climate and other features of habitat play a crucial role in whether plants flourish or languish; (2) that transplantation therefore leads to changes, even degeneration (a phenomenon already well-established in the botanical literature of Rousseau’s day); and (3) the conclusion that the best way to study nature is to observe it in situ. Rousseau’s criticism of Linnaeus in his Confessions sums up this position: “he [Linnaeus] studied botany too much in herbaria and gardens and not enough in nature itself” (Rousseau 1959, 643). Humboldt, perhaps more than any naturalist of his era, demonstrated the validity of Rousseau’s criticism of Linnaeus. Inspired from a young age by tropical vegetation – the dragon tree of the Berlin botanical garden and his father’s collection of exotic trees at Schloss Tegel – as well as by the paintings of the Ganges by William Hodges (who accompanied Cook’s second world voyage and traveled in India and Russia) and Bernardin de Saint Pierre’s Paul et Virginie, he set out to explore nature as no European before him had ever done (Humboldt 2000, 346).\n\nThis contribution defines the approaches taken by the Prussian explorer and scientist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) and the Virginia statesman and naturalist Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) to nature and examines their respective understanding of and interaction with the Natural World. Though conditioned by their personal interests as well as their respective historical backgrounds, they showed a different concept of nature, both took a global perspective and shared a marked interest in the advance of science and the scientific exploration of the New Continent: Humboldt through his own American expedition (1799-1804) and Jefferson through the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806) he organized and supervised during his presidency. Furthermore, both formulated a clear response to the ideas of Buffon and de Pauw with respect to the assumed inferiority of America—one from a European, the other from an American, point of view. Finally, particular attention will be paid to those aspects concerning the impact of culture on nature and their early approach to questions regarding the relationship between man and nature, which today are understood as environmental concerns and theories.\n\nThe Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia holds the Lewis and Clark Herbarium, containing 222 sheets of pressed plants collected during the explorations led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. This constitutes 96 percent of the plant specimens known to survive from the first exploration of the Louisiana Territory and the uncharted realm of the American Northwest in 1804-1806. The herbarium is an \"American Treasure,\" a recipient of federal and private sector funding in the Save America's Treasures program, to preserve it for future uses and to make the information it contains available to all. It is a working scientific collection, which has attained the status of a national icon for its association with the famous explorers. Conservational efforts in the herbarium are the culmination of nearly two centuries of varied use and storage of these plant specimens, providing for their continued viability as a unique historical and scientific resource. The history presented here focuses upon the plants after their arrival from the field, from 1805 to 2002. New information is gleaned from archival records and other primary sources. This is one of three complementary articles on the history, conservation, and use of the Lewis and Clark Herbarium."
