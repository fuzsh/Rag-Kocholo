        "text": "joe- Hello.\n\nmark- G'day. Is that Sabrina's place please?\n\nj- Who's this?\n\nm- This is Mark from Australia.\n\nj-Mark from Australia? Yeah, she's right here.\n\nm-Thank you.\n\nsabrina-Hello, Mark?\n\nm-Hello Sabrina.\n\ns-Hi.\n\nm-How are you?\n\ns-All right.\n\nm-I hope this isn't-\n\ns-This is a surprise.\n\nm-Is this too late to call?\n\ns-No. No. No. I'm up 'til about 5 in the morning.\n\nm-I thought you might be.\n\ns-Yeah.\n\nm-I just wanted to thank you for your card and your letter-\n\ns-Yeah, I got your letter, and I had drafted a letter and I had some points I had to clarify, and I made a kind of little note of them and so, as I said I just drafted a letter to you.\n\nm-I hope you're well.\n\ns-Yeah – uh huh. I need another operation, you know, but it's finding a doctor. I was telling you in the letter that the doctor who screwed me up was Australian. I put in the letter, I was wondering if you'd ever heard of him. His name was Doctor [deleted] but actually I call him Doctor Quack.\n\nm-No I haven't heard of him.\n\ns-No he was from Melbourne or from Sydney. I never got around to asking him.\n\nm-Can you tell me what the operation's for?\n\ns-I don't know. I've been asked that question by the biggest professors at the University of California and Washington State and they all said \"Why did he do that operation on you?\" It was on my spine, you know, but he really butchered me and I told him that. Usually I put doctors on pedestals; probably that's why I married one, but this time you know I just told him, I said, \"You just butchered me\" and I just had no qualms about saying it. But he just caused me a lot of problems. And so there we are.\n\nm- I was thinking about your scrapbooks. And I've done a search on the internet and both FedEx and UPS can deliver to Australia and I can pay it at this end.\n\ns- O it would cost you a fortune.\n\nm- Well, it won't be too much. I suppose it just depends on what they weigh.\n\ns- O my God they're like a ton of bricks. Well you know after all, paper is from wood. And these are, I mean, I've got scrapbooks from every country that I've worked in… South America and I've got two big ones from Australia and they're like – oh… Joe, how big are those scrapbooks? About 18 inches by what? No, not ten! They're not narrow! Yes! They're bigger than 12. Yeah – about 14. They're big. Four inches thick.\n\nm-Yeah, they've got rates up to ten kilograms or 20 kilograms.\n\ns- I don't know what kilograms are.\n\nm- Multiply by two for pounds. They can use a forklift to-\n\ns- Forklift! No you don't need a forklift!\n\nm- Well, they have rates for forklifts too. So if you wanted to send them, either FedEx or UPS would be OK.\n\ns- I was gonna send you- I have an album but you know, you would have to send them to me back.\n\nm-Yes.\n\ns- Joe is telling me they're too precious.\n\nm- I'd certainly send them back.\n\ns- He said they could get lost in the mail. The thing is there's no price that you can put on such memories. You know I have my real personal albums and those I think are about what – 12 by 14? And there are a lot of snaps my husband took and things like that, which are kind of nice.\n\nm- That sounds good.\n\ns- Yeah, and if I took them out of the binders they wouldn't be that heavy. I just would hate for them to get lost. O you know that night I was writing the letter?\n\nm- Yes.\n\ns- It was funny, because I had on the shopping channel as background, you know, and I was writing that I didn't know how to look at the negatives. You can't- it's hard to make out where they were and what – you know. And they're not all black and white. They're all colour, my negatives.\n\nm- That's good!\n\ns- Yeah, and at that moment as I was writing that they brought on this thing where you can view your negatives and it prints them or something like that. Anyway about an hour or so later another one came on, so anyway it finished up I ordered them and I got both of them, but you've got to have a computer. You've got to hook it up to a computer so I'm back to square one. So now I've got two negative viewers but nothing to… [laughter]\n\ns- There were 21 things in that [Mail on Sunday] article that were untrue. Because I mean the house next door to me has just sold for a million dollars and the one across the street sold for $700,000. And so here they're saying I'm living in this run-down neighbourhood and the houses in the street are going for these big prices.\n\nAnd the one across the street… my house … that only has oh – I don't know, what [inaudible] – and just had a little back garden. 'Cos a friend of mine used to live there and I was in the house and the garden was only about 20 feet in back and here I've got this huge lot, enough to put a swimming pool in, so my property is much more valuable than the one across the street.\n\nSo there are so many untruths… That Mary from next door – I only ever said hello to her. I never even spoke to her. She was taken away. Right after that she was taken away because she was getting lost. She was walking up and down. All the time she was walking around the neighbourhood. She had Alzheimers. So, whatever she said, none of it was true, and they used her as a source and she had to be taken away to be looked after because she has Alzheimers. And her mother said, \"O she was getting lost and people were finding her and having to bring her home.\" And so, that's their source – she had Alzheimers.\n\nSo as I say, I had 21 things. In fact I'll make a photocopy because it will give you a little idea of how untrue that article was.\n\nm- There was an article in Sir! in 1959 which compares you with Marilyn Monroe, and draws the comparisons between you, like that you were both models, you both-\n\ns- I didn't do much modelling really.\n\nm- Didn't you?\n\ns- No… No.\n\nm- I thought you were quite big in the pinup world.\n\ns- NO! Not at all! No. That really gets me upset, that I'm referred to as a model. And another thing that really P.O.'s me off is –\n\nm- You can be honest if you like!\n\ns- Yes I will be! – is that June Wilkinson who I think I only met – tops – I think, twice… and once she turned up at my 21st birthday party. And we had the same dress maker, and she came out with this story that, you know which is true: Carmen was making me this dress and I didn't like it half way through so June Wilkinson bought it and said, \"O, but I had to let it out.\" But who adds two inches of fabric in the bust? You make a seam, you know, and I used to sew, and you have like a quarter of an inch seam. You don't have two inches of superfluous fabric lying there so June Wilkinson could let it out to accommodate her bust.\n\nJune Wilkinson\n\nAnd the other thing was this thing with the tape measure . And she was saying that she was my friend and everything and um-\n\nm- You had a two-sided tape measure.\n\ns- Yeah! Where does she come out… I never even thought of this!\n\nm- It sounded good, though.\n\ns- Yeah, but maybe this is something she did. But my mind didn't run to that.\n\ns – A funny thing that happened, because somebody in England, some wealthy person challenged me about my waist being 17 inches and he had a belt made and he said that if I could put this belt on he would give a certain amount of money to a charity of my choosing.\n\nThe infamous metal belt!\n\nBut the crafty devil, he had the belt made – you can put on a belt and pull it in – but this one he had made of steel and to get it on you had to clip it over to – like, you had to go down to sixteen to get it on because he had, like, studs on it and you had to wrap it over – and I remember that the photographers coming around to my apartment and the reporter – and they did this – you know it was on the front page with this whole front page of my waist.\n\nBut it was funny because I tried to get it on – and you had to have a six – and it was made of steel and it went all the way round and – well, you'd have to have like a fifteen or a six- I know I was lying on the floor, and the reporter and the photographer, they were trying to get it on but, anyway, you know, we did. So the guy had to give the money to this charity.\n\nYou could tell how tickled pink Sabby was to get into that thing!\n\nm- When you did modelling at sixteen-\n\ns- I wasn't doing modelling at sixteen!\n\nm- They said when you left Blackpool to go to London when you were sixteen-\n\ns- Who were \"they?\"\n\nm- Several articles.\n\ns- Yeah… yeah…\n\nm- They said you left Blackpool to go to London when you were sixteen and at that stage you weren't having a lot of luck. You were doing waitressing in Soho bars and-\n\ns- No!\n\nm- restaurants. And you got picked up by a photographer-\n\ns- O my God!\n\nm- and Arthur Askey, or Arthur Askey's producer saw one of your pictures and thought you'd be good.\n\ns- No, no, not true. I went to an audition at the BBC.\n\nm- Straight from Blackpool?\n\nS- No, no. I went to London, originally. I was dating the brother of Dickie Valentine, but that had little to do with why I went to London. I went to London to… I was making costume jewellery because while I was quite sick as a … you know I had polio and rheumatic fever and osteomyelitis all at once. Of course I always did everything in a big way.\n\nM- Several articles said you had polio. One said you had rheumatic fever-\n\nS- Yeah, well I did. I had them both. And osteomyelitis in my leg. What I was doing was occupational therapy. I went to work for a jeweller, that was it, and that's how I learned how to make costume jewellery.\n\nAnd then, what happened was, I was having to - trying to say - so long ago! I haven't thought of this for a long time. Trying to get… so- I used to have to go and buy like necklaces and things and then I would break them up and make my jewellery from things that I would buy from the stores. Retail. This is after I left the jewellery manufacturer.\n\nSo I went to London to get my supplies. I went to Hatton Garden. And it was rather funny. I was about sixteen and I'd be behind this row of big businessmen who were buying grosses and boxes for several thousand pounds' worth of jewellery and stuff. And of course Hatton Gardens is a diamond place in England and my turn would come and I'd say, \"Well, I want twelve of these, and half a dozen of those\" and I would drive the man absolutely mad because they'd have to be picking out twelve of this and other people would be buying grosses of things. And I'd have my little orders and I'd trot back to England, I'd catch the train back to England and I was making my jewellery.\n\nAnd then – ahhh – I then went to London after that to- my mother… yeah. I had… my mother let me go back to London to be with this boyfriend but then I stayed in London and that's when I got a job as a waitress.\n\nBut then, what happened was, I was living in the attic of this place, and it was a transport café and I had to get up at four in the morning and I didn't finish work until like four or five in the afternoon and my leg began to play up because I'd had about eight surgeries on my leg, and at one time they were going to amputate it, and it started to play up on me because I was on it too long.\n\nSo this couple I was staying with kind of adopted me in a way. They had no children and they were very nice people. And of course my mother was having a fit that I was in London and she came down to London to take me back. And then she saw that these were nice people and she let me stay because by this time I was making my jewellery and the lady had a friend who had a friend who had a beauty shop, a hair salon, and she was selling my jewellery to her clients.\n\nAnd then I had a lot of initiative so I made up samples of my jewellery and I went to several shops and big department stores and I got commissions to put my supplies in their shop. And this was when I was like sixteen.\n\nAnd that's how I went to London.\n\nm- 'Norma was well-liked by her peers. When she was in the alcove with the other local girls at the Wintergardens Dance she sparkled. '\n\ns- Yeah, I used to go dancing. Yeah. At the Wintergarden, ya.\n\nm- Now it says your mother had a private hotel off Central Drive, Blackpool.\n\ns- Yeah, little ho- no, it wasn't a big hotel, it was just, you know-\n\nm- A B&B?\n\ns- Yeah.\n\nm- You went to Blackpool Claremont School from 10 to 15 years.\n\ns- No. What?\n\nm - From when you were 10 to 15.\n\ns- No, I hardly went to school because I was in and out of hospital and I hated school. And in fact, as I was saying, the one school, Tilby Road I remember I used to always say 'Oh, I'm sick' and used to get notes from my mother. And my school was close to the beach, and I'd be lying on the beach sunbathing and suddenly my class would suddenly- the teacher would decide to have a lesson on the beach and I'd be lying there [laughs] and I'd have to make a quick getaway.\n\nDuring the cookery lesson I used to pretend I was tired and I used to always be sleepy, the ovens made me sleep [?], and everyone would say \"Ahhh, poor thing, she had a lot of sickness and everything. Don't bother her.\" 'Cause I said, \"Well I'm not going to learn to cook because I don't intend to cook for any man...\"\n\nm- And you never have.\n\ns- And stand over a stove- What?\n\nm- And you never have.\n\ns- Yes I did ! I became a gourmet cook!\n\nm- Did you?\n\ns- Yes !\n\ns- Going back to how I got the Askey show... I had two or three covers on a magazine, and just call me a model but I wasn't modelling at all. And this boyfriend of mine took me to a cocktail party and it was at this party that I met Frederick Mullally and he worked for Picture Post . And it was at the time that the Italian girls were making a big impact - you know Sophia Loren and Gina - and they were sort of saying \"England has our own- we don't have to import them. We have our own sex symbols, whatever.\" So they put me on the Picture Post, on the cover...\n\nClick the mag to read the article\n\nAnd I think they referred to me as being a model but I wasn't, really.\n\nm- A lot of people think you were.\n\ns- No, I wasn't. And then what happened was an agent saw the Picture Post and he called me and said- and I went to his office- and he said, \"I'd like you to put your name down on my books.\" And he represented Joan Collins and her sister Jackie and a lot of other top models and starlets and he said to me, \"Can I put you down in my books?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but,\" I said, \" I'm not an actress.\" I was honest. And so he said, \"Well, I'll put you down anyway and if anything comes up I'll give...\"\n\nWell about a week later I got a call from him and he said, \"Look, they're having an audition at the BBC and they want a girl for the one night, and will you go along for the audition?\" And I said, \"Well... OK...\" And then after I hung up a friend of mine was there and I said, \"O my God, they want me to go for this audition\" and I said \"Oh, I'm not going\". I said, \"What have I got myself into? What kind of an audition will it be?\"\n\nApparently it was only an audition on camera with Arthur Askey so this friend of mine- lucky he was there because I doubt if I would have gone... I was very shy. And he was there and he said, \"Look, you're going to go.\" And he came back a week later, or whenever it was, and he made sure- and on the way I said, \"No, stop the car. I want to go back.\" And he said, \"No\" and he stopped at a pub and he gave me a double Scotch to give me some Dutch courage and so I went on.\n\nWhen I got there, there were all these glamour girls that I'd seen photographs of... Shirley Enfield and all the other girls, Eaton *...\n\n*Sabby meant Shirley Eaton, not Enfield.\n\ns- So the agent said, \"By the way, they want you to go on Friday evening to this cocktail party because they're launching this show, and they're going to call you Sabrina\". And that's when I said \"Arghh, I don't like that name\" and he said, \"Well, what do you care? It's only for one night.\"\n\nAnd then I said, \"Well, what am I going to be doing?\" He said, \"You'll be getting a script in a few days so don't worry. You'll get a script soon.\" So the script hadn't arrived when I got to the cocktail party.\n\nAnd they introduced me as Sabrina, and when the press started asking me what I was going to be doing, of course I didn't know. And seeing that I am honest, they said \"Are you going to be singing?\" And I said \"No- I'm not a singer.\"\n\nAnd they said, \"Oh, well. Are you going to be dancing?\" and I said, \"No, I don't dance.\"\n\nAnd then they said, \"Well, you must be an actress. Are you going to be doing sketches?\" and I said, \"No! I've never had an acting lesson in my life!\"\n\nSo they said, \"Well, what are you going to be doing?\" and I said, \"I don't know ,\" which was the truth. By the next day every newspaper in England had me on the front page and it said, \"Meet Sabrina. Turn your TV on at a certain date and at the moment she's keeping it a secret as to what she's going to do. But if you turn your TV on you're going to see what the big surprise is- what she can do.\"\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that I couldn't do anything and that's how it came out that I had no talent, because I was the one who said it.\n\nRead one account of Sabrina's earliest days in the media - in 1955.\n\ns- If I hadn't been honest and if I had said I was going to be singing or acting, that would have been it because they would have just written it down. But because of my telling the truth, that's how Sabrina was born.\n\nAnd then what happened after that, I began to get so much publicity every day that by the end of the rehearsal [ series/season ?] the press were knocking down the door to take pictures of me. There was no way the few lines that I did have in the show could live up to all the publicity I got.\n\nSo they didn't know what to do with me. And then the writers came up with this idea that I wouldn't say anything. I know they had the song O Let Me Go Lover , which was a big hit at the time, and I know they had this big entrance where I came down this big flight of stairs and when I got to the mike - and they had this big chorus singing O Let Me Go Lover or something - and when I got to the mike Arthur came on and said, \"No, not now. Come back later.\"\n\nAnd I kept popping up throughout the show, making like \"When am I going to get to sing?\" and he said \"Later, later\" so I never did get to speak, to sing, and of course that drove everybody mad.\n\nAnd - the show was every two weeks - they came up with a different gimmick where I didn't speak. It just blew out of all proportion. I mean people would stop me in the street and say, \"Just say something to me. Do you really speak, or can't you speak?\n\nAnd that's how it all started.\n\ns- Well, Harold Melsheimer never had any sense of humour. I couldn't believe I ended up marrying a German.\n\nm- Was he actually German or American?\n\ns- No, he was American but he came from Germany. He was born in Germany.\n\nm- It said in one article that you were attracted to him because he didn't know who you were. Was that important to you?\n\ns- I think, maybe I've always been attracted to people who didn't know who I was.\n\nm- Were you trying to get rid of the past?\n\ns- No.\n\nm - You just liked being the average girl?\n\ns- Maybe, ya. In fact I know that when I was doing my scrapbook - it was when I was married to Melsheimer - he never even bothered looking at them. I'd be thinking \"That's nice what I've done\"\n\nm - And he wasn't interested in that?\n\ns- I don't think so, no. I know he didn't want me to be in the theatre. He destroyed all my music which I'd paid - all my charts from my nightclub act - which cost me about 25,000 dollars, or pounds, whatever. He destroyed them all.\n\nm - Why did he do that?\n\ns- Because he didn't want me to work.\n\nm- Did you have many offers in your married days?\n\ns- I didn't look for it. People would- I was- I seemed to have had enough. I don't know. I just lost interest.\n\ns- Let me finish what I thought about Castro 'cos that really upset me. I met him once and that was at the TV studio, and he was doing one of his marathon broadcasts, and I was doing a TV show. He wanted to meet me afterwards and all he said to me was, \"Welcome to my country. I hope you have a very pleasant time, and if there's anything you need please call my aide and they will take care of anything you need.\" And that was the extent of my conversation - not more than five minutes.\n\nm- Apparently, he was calling American journalists and you were in the background having fun with his cabinet.\n\ns- NO... that's not true! Then what happened was, there was one newspaper, Confidential that spliced a picture of him and myself together and put it on the front page, and were insinuating that we were having a romance - that was all.\n\n'Cos he asked me - the press, the Cuban press - what I thought of Fidel. And - what are you going to say? \"He's a hairy bastard\"? No! I said it was either he had a lot of magnetism or charisma, or something like that, and that's all I said.\n\nAnd that was- you know- I never heard from-\n\nO yeah - he sent me a dozen chickens...\n\ns- Painted in the revolutionary colours. [m-A dozen chickens!] They were green. Ya, a dozen green chickens. The thing was ... I had to keep them in the bath tub in my hotel. And every day I'd find one dead and I'd go \"O my God, what's going to happen? Where do I get some more green chickens?\"\n\nI was afraid he was going to find out that I was killing his chickens off.\n\nm- So what did you do with a dozen green chickens?\n\ns- Well, they were just in my bathroom! And what could I do in a hotel room with a dozen chickens?\n\nm - You could fry them.\n\ns- Wouldn't be much of a meal.\n\nm- I'm just wondering how a celebrity deals with a dozen green chickens from a dictator of an aggressive country.\n\ns- Well they all died .\n\nm- In the bathtub.\n\ns- Well, yes. You know, I didn't know what to do with them.\n\nm- It sounds wonderful.\n\ns- [laughs] No. I was very upset.\n\nm- It'd be very hard to take a bath.\n\ns- It was. I'd have to pull them out of the bathtub, otherwise - you know - you'd have chicken dirt on you, wouldn't you? So I had to keep them there, I don't know.\n\nm- The story gets more interesting every moment.\n\ns- That was my involvement with Fidel.\n\nNote: I now can only assume the chickens were actually baby chicks, which explains why they could not have jumped out of the bath nor provided \"much of a meal\".\n\nm- A person called John Andrews would like to know how tall you were.\n\ns- What do you mean \"were\"? You can't grow smaller!\n\nm- Even I have shrunk in my 46 years but-\n\ns- I'm not shrunk [laughs]\n\nm- No, but he was wondering - he knows all of your measurements, all of your vital measurements from your heyday and he was wondering-\n\ns- Five foot six.\n\nm- Five foot six.\n\ns- Uh huh.\n\nm- Right. Because we've never mentioned that anywhere on the site and I thought it was a very good question.\n\ns- And the thing is, everyone was saying to me, \"O you're so tiny\" when they'd meet me because I came across on TV as being- and of course standing next to Arthur who was very tiny... and I looked very big, tall. I'm actually relatively petite, actually quite small.\n\nm- I thought you were, because of that waist [s- ya] you must be fairly petite-\n\ns- Even now, you know, oh - I've got long, sort of reddish coloured hair-\n\nm- Red ?\n\ns- Yes.\n\nm- I thought you were always a blonde.\n\ns- No, no. When I let my natural hair go back to its own colour, it had a reddish tint to it because my mother was a redhead and I have sort of now got long red hair down my back.\n\nm- All of the articles say you were a natural honey blonde.\n\ns- No, I'm not, but what I like to do though is- I like to wear wigs, and I've got a lot of blonde wigs, all styles and shapes and colours and everything. So if I want to be blonde for a day when I go out, I'll be blonde, you know. I'll put on a wig. People will so, \"Oh God, your hair is so beautiful\". I'll say, \"Oh, it's a wig\". I always cop out.\n\nBut I've got wigs that are in bright- you know- red red. All colours, all shapes. I never have a bad hair day.\n\nm- It'll be nice to see you in a picture as a redhead.\n\nAnnie and Sabrina. Pic sent by Sabby.\n\ns- Oh yeah! I've even got some film of me as a redhead.\n\nm - Have you? Great! Because most of your pictures were you in black and white and it was very hard to tell what colour you were.\n\ns- I'm in black and white?\n\nm- Yes.\n\ns- O God, that's why you'd love to see my albums.\n\nm- It would be fascinating. I think most of your fans would be delighted to see you as you really were.\n\ns- Also too, what would be nice is all the reviews I got for shows I did. Where it said I was a good actress, and this and that. I did the play Rattle of a Simple Man * which I never left stage for. There was like two and a half hours - I was on stage the whole time. And it was really basically a two character play.\n\nm- That's a lot of acting.\n\ns- Ya! And I got very good reviews on that. In fact it was very funny. It was here in Hollywood that I did the play and it was with an English man, Bernard Fox . He said - and he's very sarcastic - you know. British people have that wit - and he said, \"Bloody hell. I have to come to America to bloody well work with you .\" You know, implying that I wasn't an actress or anything. And then opening night, or I should say the night after, when all the reviews came out I went in to knock on his door and went into his dressing room and \"Oh!\" he said. \"I'm a fifth generation of actors and I have to come to bloody America to work with you.\" Something like that. So when all the reviews came out I knocked on his door and I threw all the reviews on his table and I said, \"There you are Bernie. It took me one night to knock out five generations of actors.\" [laughs] That's a true story.\n\n*August 1966-7, Ivar Theatre, Los Angeles. Sabrina was 30. I remember Bernard Fox as Dr Bombay in Bewitched .\n\nm- I'm just wondering how you got from a working class background in a small town to be one of the greatest publicity experiences that the United Kingdom-\n\ns- And I never had a publicity agent!\n\nm- You never had one?\n\ns- NO!\n\nm- They kept talking about you having an agent.\n\ns - No, I had a photographer, Joe Matthews [ contemporary reference ], who was acting as my manager in England. And it started out by him taking me to - he would ask me to go out to a certain dinner dance for some charity organisation and of course his-\n\ns- his gimmick was, him being a photographer, all the people at a dinner dance wanted a picture with me and he'd sell the pictures to all the people so they had a picture with Sabrina. And like a friendship developed and he became my manager. He was also like a chaperone to me too. Noone was ever good enough for me. And he would always, if I was going out on a date, he'd always take me there and pick me up so nobody ever got to be alone with me.\n\nm- I always thought your mum was your chaperone.\n\ns- No.\n\nn- Because she seemed to be everywhere that you were.\n\ns- No. I took her to Australia. Then I met that terrible guy Ray Bolwell . She didn't like him so she went home.\n\nRay Bolwell.\n\nSabrina later admitted they were romantically connected at one time.\n\nm- She didn't take you with her?\n\ns- Well, I was still under contract to Tivoli Theatre. He was a bastard.\n\nSabrina and manager Ray Bolwell at Mascot\n\nleaving for USA, 19 Nov 59.\n\nRead more of Sabrina in Australia here .\n\nm- It must be hard in the industry with the casting couch and everything. [s- No] Trying to get on.\n\ns- No, I never had that problem. No.\n\nm- I thought you must have been sort of pestered by all sorts of people who were thinking that they could do you a favour [s- No] if you could do them a favour.\n\ns- No. Never did.\n\nm- That's a surprise.\n\ns- No, because I already had a name. And they couldn't offer me something I didn't have already.\n\nm- The thing that some people say that really stopped you from becoming the big superstar like Marilyn was that you never posed nude after you became famous. Was that because of religious beliefs or you just didn't want to or you didn't have to or what?\n\ns- Didn't have to.\n\nm- But did you see that the potential was there?\n\ns- O yeah, that's all so true. That's what happened too in- a lot of nudity was in the films in Hollywood. I forgot about that. That put me off also.\n\nn- It just didn't take your fancy. You weren't that way.\n\ns- No, no. Marilyn was an exhibitionist, wasn't she? She like to run around in the nude all the time?\n\nm- I never saw her do that, but-\n\ns- No you wouldn't see her do that! [laughs]\n\nm- No, but she was a strange sort of a girl. You always seemed very controlled and you knew what you were doing.\n\ns- Yeah.\n\nm- Did you always have that? Were you in control?\n\ns- Uh huh.\n\nm- Did you get that from your parents?\n\ns- I was just born with it.\n\nm- As a survival skill.\n\ns- And my mother was very astute.\n\nm- Did she give you much guidance?\n\ns- No, not in the theatre because she was just happy when I took her with me.\n\nm- So, when you said you were going to London, what did your mum say?\n\ns- She had a fit! She got onto the next train and tried to bring me back. And then she saw I was with these nice people so she let me stay there. It was funny: she let me go with this boyfriend. She wouldn't have let me go on my own but she let me go with this boyfriend 'cos he said he'd look after me. [laughs]\n\nm- That's even stranger.\n\ns- She liked him, and he said he'd look after me. But she didn't know that when I got there I left him and got on the next train to London.\n\nm- You went from- [s-Blackpool] Blackpool? And you went to where from Blackpool? Was it straight to London or somewhere else?\n\ns- No, I went to Bournemouth for a day. And that's where the boyfriend was. And then I went to London.\n\nm- And when you went, were you aiming for something in particular or did you just want to get out of where you were?\n\ns- Well, I had been to London before because I had gone to Hatton Gardens for the jewellery so when this person said he wanted me to go on a holiday, she let me go. But I just thought, \"O great! I can go to London and stay for a week or so.\"\n\nNote - As you may tell from my questioning, I was (and still am) very confused about this entire sequence of events. If I'm right, Sabrina said she was going from Blackpool to Bournemouth for a holiday with the boyfriend. When she gets to Bournemouth, she leaves him and goes to London with the intention of a short holiday there. She finds the nice couple and stays with them. Annie, her mother, finds out Sabby is in London and has a fit, hops on the train and goes to London to bring Sabby back. Annie sees the nice couple and lets Sabby stay.\n\nm- Do you remember the shots- the first shots we've got of you are from 1954, tenth of April, when you appeared on the cover of Blighty .\n\nClick the pic to enlarge\n\nThe supersized 700x1000 pixel BOOBS version lets you see more clearly what's going on\n\ns- Yeah.\n\nm- And is that the earliest that you remember being on a magazine cover?\n\ns- Yeah, uh huh.\n\nm- We've got- we've got nothing else-\n\ns- There were no more covers because I wasn't a model*.\n\nm- They seem to think you were.\n\ns- Well \"they\" are wrong!\n\nm- Well, I suppose you were posing in front of a camera so they must've thought you were a model.\n\ns- Yeah. I may have done a couple of photography shoots, but that was, you know- I wasn't a model.\n\nm- They said, \"Lovely Norma Sykes provides this week's cover and very attractive she is too.\" [s- giggles] \"When not posing, Norma makes and sells earrings\"-\n\ns- Jewellery. Wasn't it- I had some jewellery around me?\n\nm- No, you had no- you had earrings.\n\ns- O no. I can visualise- see the picture now. I think I've got one hand up and down my leg-\n\nm- You seem to be pointing at your earring.\n\ns- No...\n\nm- And sort of a 1940s hairstyle.\n\ns- Yeah. I'd gone to- I never went to a hairdresser and I'd gone to a hairdresser that day and that's what they did to me. I always did my own hair.\n\nm- Did you?\n\ns- Uhmm hmmm.\n\nm- That's interesting. It says, \"In fact she's pretty and clever.\"\n\ns- Mmm mmm. That was nice of them.\n\nm- Yes! Probably better that a lot of the other articles which seemed to think you didn't have many brains.\n\n[If you don't count these covers - Ed.]\n\ns- I never thought of myself as a singer. Although I did put on a good nightclub act. But I never ever felt I was a singer.\n\nm- I thought your songs were very good actually.\n\ns- You did? I never did- heard them since they were played*\n\nm- I find myself sort of humming them occasionally.\n\ns- You do ?\n\nm- Persuade Me , and A Man, Not a Mouse [1.1M and 971K, both MP3]\n\ns- I had a terrible cold that day. I didn't want to do it because - \"awww, I can't\". And then I know they took- I had to go to a doctor to drain my sinuses because I had a terrible cold. And they had this whole orchestra all booked and everything and Norman Newell ** was having kittens because I couldn't speak. I was- So he had to take me to a Harley Street doctor to drain my nose so I could sing. [laughs]\n\nm- You sounded very well in the end.\n\ns- Really?\n\nm- Yeah.\n\ns- But that's what happened with that record, and I always hated it because I thought, \"O, I could have done better\", you know?\n\n* On radio, I assume.\n\ns- Remember I was trying to get the [nudie card] pictures - you said I was trying to get the pictures back, or something?\n\nm- Yes...\n\ns- Something about Scotland Yard or something?\n\nm- O they made a lot about that, yeah.\n\ns- Yeah, but the only thing that happened was this photographer said \"They're selling these pictures of you.\" Because he wanted a story and I was naive enough to go with him. And my mother came too. And it was just a matter of- we went there to supposedly buy the pictures up, you know? And nothing else happened.\n\nm- It played big in the English press. They said you were- they basically said you were throwing tantrums-\n\ns- O God, no.\n\nm- and claiming that you were poor and broke and you were only- sorry... ' \"I was broke,\" she wailed, \"I had to earn a few shillings.\"'\n\ns- Where ?\n\nm- And this was in London when you went to see Detective Sergeant Glander, I think it was, and he said \"he wouldn't rest until he had the full collection on his desk.\"\n\nm- And the heading is \" Bared - the picture that Sabrina will give £10,000 [pounds] to get back \"\n\nClick to read the Lowdown article.\n\nSee more of the nudie saga.\n\ns- No.\n\nm- And it seemed to think you were throwing tantrums and tearing up cards all around London.\n\ns- No.\n\nm- O. That's a bit of a disappointment.\n\ns- Not true.\n\nm- Did you deliberately decide that you'd never pose nude-\n\ns- They only paid me 15 shillings-\n\nm- And even when your popularity-\n\ns- And that was the extent of it, the one on the card, you know, the playing card. [m- Yes] That was the extent of them.\n\nm- It seemed that you had some deep moral objection to being found nude in public.\n\ns- Well, it was very embarrassing, especially when my mum and dad didn't know about it. Suddenly one morning I woke up and it was on the front page. And I think I wanted, you know, I was almost suicidal when it came out... when the paper came and my mother saw it and before my dad got up. And I thought, you know, \"Let's keep the paper from him\". It was very bad.\n\nm- It would have been embarrassing, yes.\n\ns- Luckily he never knew.\n\nm- It's not the sort of thing you tell your mum, is it?\n\ns- Well, I had to.\n\nNote: I now wonder why Sabrina was at her parents' house in Blackpool, and not in London, when the news broke in 1956. Was it a coincidental visit, or was did she know what was about to happen?"
