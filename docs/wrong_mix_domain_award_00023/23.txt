In years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize.[6] The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II.[7]

Seven laureates have received more than one prize; of the seven, the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times, more than any other.[11] UNHCR has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice. Also the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Bardeen twice, as was the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless. Two laureates have been awarded twice but not in the same field: Marie Curie (Physics and Chemistry) and Linus Pauling (Chemistry and Peace). Among the 892 Nobel laureates, 48 have been women; the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.[12] She was also the first person (male or female) to be awarded two Nobel Prizes, the second award being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, given in 1911.[11]

A prize-awarding body may, however, after due consideration in each individual case, permit access to material which formed the basis for the evaluation and decision concerning a prize, for purposes of research in intellectual history. Such permission may not, however, be granted until at least 50 years have elapsed after the date on which the decision in question was made.[18]

For discovery of how to transform ordinary adult skin cells into cells that, like embryonic stem cells, are capable of developing into any cell in the human body. He shared the prize with John B. Gurdon.

The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences honors transformative advances toward understanding living systems and extending human life. The prize was founded in 2013 by tech titans, including Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, Mark Zuckerberg and Yuri Milner and launched at UCSF.

Developed techniques for manipulating individual genes using mouse embryonic stem cells. This allowed for a more precise understanding of how individual genes worked in the mouse and accelerated the use of the mouse as a model of human cancer. This work has led to the identification of genes that are targets of cancer therapies. This prize was awarded jointly to Mario R. Capecchi, PhD, Sir Martin J. Evans, PhD, and Oliver Smithies, PhD.

This allowed for a more precise understanding of how individual genes worked in the mouse and accelerated the use of the mouse as a model of human cancer. This work has led to the identification of genes that are targets of cancer therapies. Dr. Smithies was funded for earlier work on genetic control of protein structure and synthesis. This prize was awarded jointly to Mario R. Capecchi, PhD, Sir Martin J. Evans, PhD, and Oliver Smithies, PhD.

Kahneman is recognized for the pioneering research and theoretical work he conducted with colleague Amos Tversky, PhD, who died in 1996. While Tversky was acknowledged in the announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences does not award prizes posthumously. "Certainly, we would have gotten this together," said Kahneman on the day of the announcement. "There is that shadow over the joy I feel."

The official number of Nobel Prize winners who were either faculty or graduates of Washington University is 26. While Thomas Stearns (T.S.) Eliot did graduate from the Washington University-run preparatory school, Smith Academy, when reporting official statistics of the University he is not counted, since this was a high school diploma.

Whittingham won the prize for pioneering research leading to the development of the lithium-ion battery along with John B. Goodenough, Virginia H. Cockrell Centennial Chair in Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin and Akira Yoshino of Meijo University in Japan.

Carolyn Bertozzi, a former Berkeley Lab scientist and Molecular Foundry director, is co-winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry. She shares the Nobel Prize with Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless. She is the eighth woman to be awarded the prize.

McMillan and Glenn T. Seaborg shared the prize for their discoveries in the chemistry of elements that are heavier than uranium. McMillan discovered the first, neptunium, and developed the synchrotron, the type of particle accelerator used in the discovery of 19 others. Seaborg was co-discoverer of plutonium and nine other transuranium elements.

On November 19th, fresh from a meeting with President Barack Obama, the nine newly minted laureates shared stories of their discoveries and discussed the challenges faced by U.S. science for an attentive audience of policymakers, diplomats, academics, and the media.

The winners in physiology or medicine, all AAAS members, were James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas S'dhof. They described how fundamental questions about the synchronization of organs within the body led them to unravel the basic machinery of communication within a cell through structures called vesicles ' tiny bubbles that carry signaling molecules.
