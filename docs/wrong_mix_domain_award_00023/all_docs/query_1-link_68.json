James Smith, an ichthyologist from Rhodes University positively identified it as a coelacanth, thought to have been extinct for about 150 million years.\n\nMary Cartwright\n\nMary Cartwright lived for 97 years, from December 17 1900 to April 3 1998. She was born in Aynho, England, UK and died in Cambridge, England, UK.\n\nShe was a mathematician who, with J. E. Littlewood, was the first person to analyze a mathematically dynamical system with chaos: an example of this is the butterfly effect, where a small change in the initial condition produces huge changes in the final outcome. This is often portrayed as the beating of a butterfly’s wings in China causing a hurricane in Florida.\n\nGeorge Whipple\n\nGeorge Whipple lived for 97 years, from August 28 1878 to February 1 1976. He was born in Ashland, New Hampshire, USA and died in Rochester, New York, USA.\n\nHe carried out research into pernicious anemia, which was then a fatal disease. He discovered that feeding liver to anemic dogs reversed the anemia. He was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with George Minot and William Murphy for their discovery of liver therapy treatment of anemia.\n\nBertrand Russell\n\nBertrand Russell lived for 97 years, from May 18 1872 to February 2 1970. He was born in Trellech, Wales, UK and died in Penrhyndeudraeth, Wales, UK.\n\nHe wrote the three volume work Principia Mathematica influencing future mathematical work in artificial intelligence, logic, set theory, and computer science. He was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature for championing humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.\n\nCaroline Herschel\n\nCaroline Herschel lived for 97 years, from March 16 1750 to January 9 1848. She was born in Hanover, Germany and died in the same city.\n\nShe was sister to William Herschel, who discovered Uranus. She became interested in astronomy herself and discovered five comets, and rediscovered Comet Encke. She was the first woman ever to be paid a salary for her scientific work, the salary provided by King George III of Great Britain. The star catalogue she produced resulted in the award of the British Royal Astronomical Society’s 1828 Gold Medal – the first awarded to a woman and the only one awarded to a woman until the next came in 1996.\n\nRenato Dulbecco\n\nRenato Dulbecco lived for 97 years, from February 22 1914 to February 19 2012. He was born in Catanzaro, Italy and died in La Jolla, California, USA.\n\nHe shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Howard Temin and David Baltimore for his discovery that certain types of viruses, called oncoviruses, can infect normal cells, resulting in the incorporation of malignant genes into the host-cell genome. This can switch the genetic behavior of normal cells to produce tumorous cells, resulting in cancer.\n\nJens Christian Skou\n\nJens Christian Skou is currently 98 years old. He was born on October 8 1918 in Lemvig, Denmark.\n\nHe made the first discovery of an ion-transporting enzyme, sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase, often written: Na+, K+ -ATPase. He shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker for his discovery.\n\nBernard Lovell\n\nBernard Lovell lived for 98 years, from August 31 1913 to August 6 2012 . He was born in Bristol, England, UK and died in Cheshire, England, UK.\n\nA radar expert, he obtained radar signals from daytime meteor showers and built what was then the world’s largest steerable radio telescope, the Lovell Telescope. In addition to its scientific use, the Lovell Telescope was deployed as an early warning system against Soviet nuclear missiles. Lovell believed the Soviets tried to assassinate him with a high dose of radiation when he visited Russia in 1963.\n\nErnst Ising\n\nErnst Ising lived for 98 years, from May 10 1900 to May 11 1998. He was born in Cologne, Germany and died in Peoria, Illinois, USA.\n\nHe established the Ising Model, a mathematical model he used to analyze magnetic phenomena. Today the model’s use has expanded to include biological membranes, neural networks, protein folding, and social interactions.\n\nSewall Wright\n\nSewall Wright lived for 98 years, from December 16 1889 to March 3 1988. He was born in Melrose, Massachusetts, USA and died in Madison, Wisconsin, USA.\n\nHe was one of the founders of theoretical population genetics, discovering the inbreeding coefficient. He established methods for calculating how gene frequencies are spread within populations resulting from genetic drift, migration, mutation and natural selection.\n\nJoseph Tyrrell\n\nJoseph Tyrrell lived for 98 years, from November 1 1858 to August 26 1957. He was born in Weston, Canada West and died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nA geologist, he discovered a new species of dinosaur, Albertosaurus, in Alberta in 1884. Albertosaurus is a member of the Tyrannosauridae family.\n\nHans Bethe\n\nHans Bethe lived for 98 years, from July 2 1906 to March 6 2005. He was born in Strasbourg, Germany and died in Ithaca, New York, USA.\n\nHe was awarded the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physics for his research into nuclear reactions, particularly those producing energy in stars.\n\nCharles Townes\n\nCharles Townes lived for 99 years, from July 28 1915 to January 27 2015. He was born in Greenville, South Carolina, USA and died in Oakland, California, USA.\n\nTownes invented the maser and laser, for which he was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics. He also discovered the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. He continued his work as a physicist until he was 98 years old.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAuthor of this page: The Doc\n\nPublished June 8, 2015.
