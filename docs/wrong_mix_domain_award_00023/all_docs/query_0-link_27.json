        "text": "Nobel Prize\n\nFibiger\n\nWhipple\n\nDulbecco\n\nBenacerraf\n\nWarren\n\nhistory of pathology\n\nAlfred Nobel (1833–1896), Swedish chemical engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur, patented over 300 inventions in 5 different countries. Nobel began to experiment with nitroglycerine and produced his first explosion in 1862. After his most important inventions–the detonator (to explode nitroglycerine), dynamite (to stabilize nitroglycerine) and ballistite (smokeless gunpowder)–he built factory after factory in 20 different countries. Soon, he became a mega-industrialist and multimillionaire.\n\nNobel never attended a university nor did he ever obtain any degree. He was a self-educated man and a remarkable linguist. He spoke German, English, French, Italian, Russian, and Swedish. He took serious interest in English literature. Chemistry was his hobby. Despite his fame, Nobel remained a lonely man all his life and never gained happiness. He acquired houses in France, Russia, and Italy, but regarded himself homeless. He worshipped his mother and almost every year he returned to Stockholm on her birthday.\n\nNobel was a pacifist and he considered his inventions so dangerous that making war had become unthinkable. In order to establish permanent peace he set aside funds from his estate for an annual peace prize. This gave him the impetus to extend his generosity to the sciences for the benefit of mankind. Nobel in his final will–a one-page handwritten note that he drafted in Paris in 1895–directed that most of his assets should be allocated for prizes in 5 areas: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. He ordered that the prizes be given annually to those living awardees who during the preceding year had conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.\n\nSince 1901, when the first prizes were awarded, over 800 Nobel Prizes have been granted. Among the Nobel laureates there are many scientists and physicians who had some expertise in pathology, but there have been only 5 physicians who completed pathology training and entered the practice of pathology.\n\nJohannes Fibiger, a pathologist and professor at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, fed cockroaches–obtained from a Danish sugar factory–to rats kept in his research laboratory. After 2 months of feeding, he discovered that most of the rats had developed tumors in the stomach. On histologic examination of the stomach, a parasitic worm belonging to the nematode group was found.\n\nFibiger repeated the experiment over and over again with the same results. The rats developed chronic gastritis, gastric papilloma, and carcinoma. He discovered in the infected cockroaches the same nematode he found in the stomach of the rats. Fibiger received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1926 for the experiments he had conducted more than a decade before when he produced gastric carcinoma in rats by feeding them Spiroptera-infected cockroaches. Although Fibiger and his associates were known as meticulous investigators with integrity, the cause and nature of the gastric tumors were questioned in subsequent years by numerous researchers who failed to reproduce Fibiger’s results. It is still uncertain what caused the tumors produced by Fibiger. It has been suggested that the tumors of the rat stomach resulted from vitamin A deficiency or from contamination of their diet by a fungus, Fusarium, that produces carcinogenic mycotoxins.\n\nGeorge Whipple was born in 1878 in Ashland, New Hampshire, USA. After graduating from college, he spent a year in Ossining, New York, at the Holbrook Military Academy, where he taught mathematics and science and was in charge of the athletic program. He then entered Johns Hopkins Medical School, where his favorite subjects were pathology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. At Hopkins, he came under the influence of Welch, Osler, Halsted, and Cushing. After graduation he remained at Hopkins as a trainee in anatomic pathology and after the second year, he was granted a year to study tropical diseases in Panama. In the Canal Zone, he worked under the direction of General Gorgas.\n\nDuring his years as a pathologist at Hopkins, Whipple developed an interest in diseases of the liver and he attempted to produce liver cell necrosis in dogs by chloroform injection. In 1914, he was offered a professorship in research medicine at the University of California in San Francisco. There he extended his liver injury studies to research on the production of hemoglobin.\n\nIn 1921, he assumed the position as head of the department of pathology and dean of the new medical school in Rochester, New York. Within a few years after his arrival in Rochester, with the generous support of Mr. Eastman and his film manufacturing company, Whipple showed that feeding liver to dogs, made anemic by blood-letting, was a potent cure for anemia. He also demonstrated that a liver fraction was useful in secondary anemia (pernicious anemia).\n\nIn 1934, Whipple was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery that a diet rich in liver cured pernicious anemia. He shared the prize with George Minot and William Murphy of the United States.\n\nRenato Dulbecco was born in Catanzara, Italy, in 1914. At the young age of 22 he received his M.D. degree from the University of Turin. After his training in pathology, he was drafted into the Italian army. During the Second World War, he served with the Italian army in France and Russia. He was wounded and returned to Italy where he joined the Resistance against Mussolini.\n\nAfter the war, in 1947, Dulbecco joined the staff of the California Institute of Technology and began work on animal viruses. In 1962, he moved to the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, where he discovered the interaction between DNA tumor viruses and the genetic material of cultivated cells. He found that the virus either led to destruction of cells and the release of virus particles, or to transformation of cells. He showed by molecular techniques that the genetic material of viruses was incorporated into the genetic material of the transformed cells and represented the first phase in carcinogenesis.\n\nIn 1975, Dulbecco was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition of the research work he carried out at the California Institute of Technology and the Salk Institute. Dulbecco shared the Nobel Prize with David Baltimore and Howard Temin of the USA.\n\nBaruj Benacerraf was born in 1920 in Caracas, Venezuela. He had his primary and secondary education in Paris, France. He received his B.S. in 1942 at Columbia University in New York City and his M.D. in 1945 at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. He trained in pathology at the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City and took a fellowship in Paris. After returning to New York, he went into the banking business in which he failed.\n\nIn 1956, Benacerraf joined the faculty of New York University School of Medicine. There he began developing the concept of immune response (Ir) genes, which control the body’s response to antigens in autoimmune diseases. In 1970, he was appointed chairman of the department of pathology at Harvard University in Boston, where he remained until 1991. As an aside, after Benacerraf assumed his position as chairman of pathology, he discarded the gross and microscopic teaching sets that had been accumulated for medical students by his illustrious predecessors. Benacerraf received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery, while at New York University, of the immune response genes. He shared the Nobel Prize with George Snell of the USA and Jean Dausset of France.\n\nJohn Warren was born in Adelaide, Australia in 1937. At age 18 he was diagnosed as suffering from grand mal epilepsy. Despite this handicap, he gained entrance to the medical school of Adelaide University in 1955. After he completed training in pathology at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, he was appointed pathologist at the Royal Perth Hospital in Perth, Australia.\n\nIt was there, in 1979, that Warren first noticed small curved bacteria in gastric biopsies. Over the next 2 years he demonstrated that the organisms were usually related to chronic gastritis and ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Subsequently, Warren and Barry Marshall, a gastroenterologist, succeeded in culturing the previously unknown bacterial species, Helicobacter pylori.\n\nIn recognition of this discovery, Warren received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005. He shared the Prize with his Australian colleague and co-worker, Barry Marshall."
