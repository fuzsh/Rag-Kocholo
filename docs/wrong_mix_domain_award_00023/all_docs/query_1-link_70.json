Here, an invalid woman uses radio to keep in touch with events in the outside world. The catastrophe of World War I shattered the sense of optimism that had grown in the West since the Enlightenment. Despair gripped survivors on both sides as they added up the staggering costs of the war. Europeans mourned a generation of young men who had been lost on the battlefields. Many people talked about a “return to normalcy,” to life as it had been before 1914. But rebellious young people rejected the moral values and rules of the Victorian Age and chased after excitement. Gertrude Stein, an American writer living in Paris, called them the “lost generation.” Others saw them as immoral pleasure-seekers. The Roaring Twenties During the 1920s, new technologies helped create a mass culture shared by millions in the world’s developed countries. Affordable cars, improved telephones, and new forms of media such as motion pictures and radio brought people around the world closer together than ever before. Duke Ellington was a composer, pianist, and bandleader. He referred to his music as \"American Music\" rather than \"jazz.\" His career spanned the 1920s to the 1970s. In the 1920s, many radios tuned into the new sounds of jazz. In fact, the decade in the West is often called the Jazz Age. African American musicians combined Western harmonies with African rhythms to create jazz. Jazz musicians, like trumpeter Louis Armstrong and pianist Duke Ellington, took simple melodies and improvised endless subtle variations in rhythm and beat. Throughout the 1920s, the popularity of jazz moved from the United States to Europe. Europeans embraced American popular culture, with its greater freedom and willingness to experiment. The nightclub and jazz were symbols of that freedom. Jazz came to embody the universal themes of creativity and self-expression. Much of today’s popular music has been influenced by jazz. It has transcended the \"Roaring Twenties\" American culture to become an international musical language. After the war, rebellious young people, disillusioned by the war, rejected the moral values and rules of the Victorian Age and chased after excitement. During the Jazz Age, this rebellion was exemplified by a new type of liberated young woman called the flapper. The first flappers were American, but their European sisters soon adopted the fashion. Flappers rejected old ways in favor of new, exciting freedoms. The Flapper awoke from her lethargy (tiredness) ... bobbed her hair, put on her choicest pair of earrings and a great deal of audacity (boldness) and rouge and went into battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and ... refused to be bored chiefly because she wasn't boring ... Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim, and most of all to heart. —Zelda Fitzgerald, flapper and wife of author F. Scott Fitzge."
