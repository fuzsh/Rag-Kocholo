        "text": "The University of Bristol Law School has launched a new course for anyone interested in healthcare. The LLM in Health, Law and Society, is a distinctive, master’s level degree that goes beyond traditional courses on\n\nhealthcare law to look at the relationships between law, governance and health\n\nacross society and governmental sectors. The course is offered on a full or part-time basis.\n\nMarking a clear evolution in the field\n\nof Law and Health,\n\nthe\n\nprogramme reflects the urgent challenges facing a fast-evolving\n\nhealthcare world and covers issues that have far-reaching consequences for individuals\n\nand social institutions – issues such as end-of-life decisions, reproductive\n\njustice, right to health and medical negligence.\n\nAs such, students will be tackling\n\nwide-ranging questions concerning the impacts of law, regulation, policy, and practice on\n\nhealth and well-being, in a subject that requires collaboration across public, private\n\nand third-sector organisations and considers the wider environmental and social\n\ndeterminants of ill-health and the associated inequalities.\n\nStudents will be challenged by\n\ninternationally recognised academics\n\nwith\n\na wealth of experience working with organisations responsible for policy\n\ndevelopment, professional regulation, and social advocacy. They will become part of our new\n\ncentre for health, law and society set up in the belief that health policy should address all forms of health,\n\nrather than narrowly focus on physical health – and that prevention of ill\n\nhealth and the promotion of good health are crucial components of health\n\npolicy, and not to be ignored by a near-exclusive Health Law focus on\n\nremediation of ill health.\n\nAnd they will develop understanding and transferable\n\nskills that open up diverse career paths\n\nin policy, health care management, health regulation,\n\nhealth care provision, legal practice, public health practice, advocacy and\n\nlegal/policy research\n\nat the third-most targeted\n\nuniversity by Britain’s top 100 employers – a university that sees global health as a key priority\n\narea."
