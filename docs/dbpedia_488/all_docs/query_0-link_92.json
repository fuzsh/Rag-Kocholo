        "text": "Major League Baseball is off to the races.\n\nLiterally.\n\nIn 2025 the league plans to host a baseball game at Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tennessee, according to a report from a the Nashville Tennesseean. The game will be between the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds; both cities a just shy of a 5-hour drive from the speedway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nBristol sits on the Tennessee-Virginia border, about 115 miles north of Gatlinburg. The official announcement of the matchup from MLB is reportedly expected to come Friday.\n\nWith this game, a new baseball attendance record could be set.\n\nBristol Motor Speedway has a capacity of 153,000 for car racing, and depending on how the field is built and the seating is situated, it could be the place where the largest crowd to watch an MLB game has ever gathered.\n\nCurrently, depending on how you want to look at it, there are actually two records. And no, this doesn't involve an asterisk like Roger Maris' home run record.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe most recent record was set at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 2008 when the Los Angeles Dodgers and Boston Red Sox drew 115,300 spectators for a pre-season exhibition game.\n\nThe season marked 50 years since the Dodgers moved to LA from Brooklyn in 1958, and since the team was housed in the LA Coliseum until Dodger Stadium opened in 1962, the Dodgers made a nostalgic return to the facility.\n\nBut some may say that's not the official record. After all, the game was an exhibition — not exactly what some would call an \"official\" game since it didn't take place during the regular season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThat particular record belongs to the Colorado Rockies.\n\nWhen baseball expanded by two teams in 1993 (the Florida Marlins were the other franchise), the Rockies stadium, Coors Field, wasn't complete and wouldn't be for the next two years. Thus, the team shared old Mile High Stadium, which was multipurpose and housed previous minor league baseball teams, but it is forever known as the home of the NFL's Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Rockies played the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals) on April 9, 1993 to a crowd of 84,087.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAnd this isn't the first time Major League Baseball has ventured out of the cities of its 30 teams to play games.\n\nMLB has hosted games in London, Japan, Australia and Mexico. The league has also hosted games at the legendary Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama; at the site of the \"Field of Dreams\" filming location in Iowa and Fort Bragg in North Carolina — the first time an MLB game took place on an active military base.\n\nThere was even a game played in Hawaii in 1997 at Aloha Stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe San Diego Padres ballpark at the time, Qualcomm Stadium (Jack Murphy Stadium to purists) was undergoing renovations and was not ready for the start of the baseball season. So the Padres' series against the St. Louis Cardinals was moved to Aloha Stadium — better known as the longtime home of the NFL Pro Bowl — but like so may others was a multipurpose facility for both sports.\n\nOther sports have had their moments in different places too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad"
