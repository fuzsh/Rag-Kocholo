        "text": "Although compact in size, Bristol is the South West’s commercial hub and a vibrant, student-friendly place to be. Its size enables it to remain friendly but also big enough to provide excellent employment opportunities. The city is known for its creative character, rich history and culture, including its role as the birthplace of world famous artist Banksy, whose artwork can be seen dotted around the city in public spaces.\n\nOur Bristol campus is close to the city centre, which has lots of independent cafes and restaurants, and is just a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads Train Station – a major transport hub in the area. It’s located in the heart of Bristol’s legal district, within easy reach of major law firms and chambers, meaning our campus benefits from strong links to local legal employers.\n\nThe campus has workshop rooms that are made for interactive learning and lecture theatres that are small enough to mean that students are an active part of the learning experience and can easily interact with our lecturers. Our library allows you to have access to online resources as well as access to all the law reports and reviews you’ll need.\n\nYou will have many opportunities to get involved in a rich sporting and social life at The University of Law Bristol and you even have the option to start a society yourself or take part in activities such as negotiation or mooting competitions. The campus has a café and break out area which is a great space to hang out with friends and grab a coffee between classes.\n\nOur dedicated on-site employability team can guide you through applications and help you to find exciting work experience and pro bono opportunities that will improve your career prospects. Local firms regularly visit our Bristol campus to give talks explaining their recruitment cycles and what they are looking for from future trainees.\n\nAt Bristol, our lecturers and staff are dedicated to helping you achieve your education and career ambitions. If you’re studying law with us, you will be able to benefit from our lecturers’ experience as all of them are qualified lawyers. You will also be allocated an academic coach who is there to support you during your studies and help you access our additional support services."
