        "text": "The BSc Economics and Mathematics degree at Bristol allows students to study mathematics at a high level while also studying economics using mathematical tools.\n\nAt Bristol, students âdoâ history as well as read history through a mix of core units and a choice of primary source-based optional units. Students undertake one independent research project.\n\nBristol Law is a centre for intellectually demanding, research-informed legal education. We aim to produce accomplished, well-rounded, enquiring graduates with an ethical appreciation for law.\n\nIf you are creative, enjoy design and aspire to improve the built environment we live in, then civil engineering is for you. This degree equips students to find solutions to environmental problems.\n\nExpertise in modern languages has never been more important as the United Kingdom forges a new relationship with its European partners and develops its trading and cultural ties throughout the world."
