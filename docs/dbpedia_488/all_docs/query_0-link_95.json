        "text": "Situated in the city's legal and financial centre, Temple Quarter, the University of Law's Bristol campus is a buzzing place to study. Its one of eleven ULaw campuses across England, with 8,000 students across all sites making it the biggest law school in the UK. 96% of its full-time LPC graduates are employed within nine months of leaving, and it was ranked sixth for student satisfaction in law courses in the 2016 National Student Survey.\n\nStudents at ULaw are ensured a well-rounded experience and education, with pro bono clinics on offer where students work on cases alongside qualified lawyers. It also has its own award-winning student employability service. It has extensive connections with legal employers and works closely with all the key professional legal bodies in the UK.\n\nCourses on offer at ULaw Bristol include LLB, GDL, LPSC, PSC and PD qualifications. Events and programmes held regularly on and off campus include court visits, a 'share race', the charity challenge and the Streetlaw initiative where students are given the chance to give presentations on different legal topics at local schools and charities.\n\nOur Bristol building is just 20 minutes' walk from campus, with excellent features including an onsite gym and music practice room."
