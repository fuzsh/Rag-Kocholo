The range of units offered makes this master's programme suitable for graduates from any discipline who have an interest in the way law works in society.\n\nThe programme is one of five South West Doctoral Training Partnership interdisciplinary pathways delivered by world-leading researchers from the University of Bristol, University of Bath, University of the West of England and University of Exeter.\n\nRanked #3 in the UK for legal research excellence (REF 2021)\n\nCourse structure\n\nYou will study three core units in the School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies and two core units in the Law School.\n\nYou will take optional units up to a value of 30 credit points, chosen from across most of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Law.
