        "text": "At the University of Bristol Law School, we are committed to open and diverse academic scholarship of the highest quality. We conduct research which is ambitious and cutting edge, addressing important and challenging questions of society and governance. We want the results of our scholarly investigation to be known and put in practice in a way that contributes to the well-being of Bristol, the South West, the UK and the wider world. The Law School Blog is our tool to communicate, disseminate and showcase our world-leading research beyond traditional academic channels. It is our collective public engagement platform, through which we aim to reach our wider audiences and grow our community of scholars and researchers. The blog builds upon our research outcomes, makes them accessible, and provides evidence-led and reasoned arguments that inform, enrich and shape social and policy debates.\n\nThe opinions expressed in the blog are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of University of Bristol Law School or the University of Bristol as an institution."
