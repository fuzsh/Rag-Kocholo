        "text": "The University of Bristol Law School has over forty academic staff with a range of research interests which extend across doctrinal and socio-legal scholarship. Many of its current staff are acknowledged leaders in their fields.\n\nSupported by a range of funders such as the Economic and Social Research Council, the Legal Services Commission, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the European Commission, our research experts advise, publish and conduct world-leading research in a wide range of legal and socio-legal fields, including commercial law, criminal law and justice, family law, property, employment law, legal theory, international law, human rights, socio-legal methods, the law of obligations, and public law.\n\nThe School of Law conducts research in a wide range of legal and socio-legal fields. 90 per cent of our research was recognised as of international quality in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, and 55 per cent was internationally excellent or world leading. As we submitted the work of 43 full time equivalent members of staff, this attests to wide ranging research capability in Bristol Law School. The School has a thriving body of research students, and welcomes applications from visiting researchers who wish to spend time at Bristol. The School has a strong international reputation for collaborative research."
