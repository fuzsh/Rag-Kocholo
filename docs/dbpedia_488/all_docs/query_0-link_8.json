        "text": "Bristol Law School is one of the top-rated ‘post 1992’ law departments in the country, scoring consistently high ratings in the official research assessment exercises. This reflects the fact that legal research provides a central focus for the work of the Law School, and that many staff are engaged in research of national and international significance.\n\nThe Law School also places emphasis on nurturing new career researchers, investing in providing an environment in which they can flourish, and on using research to enrich the learning experience of students.\n\nView our latest publications\n\nResearch funding\n\nResearch carried out by Law School staff is funded by a wide range of organisations including Innovate UK, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), LexisNexis Risk Solutions, the City of London Police Force, ICT Wilmington Risk & Compliance, Universities South West, the France Telecom Group, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the European Commission, the Open Society Justice Initiative, the College of Policing, a range of UK police forces, the British Academy, the European Institute for Gender Equality, and national and international business corporations.\n\nMedia engagement\n\nBristol Law School staff members have been interviewed by and their work reported in a number of media outlets such as Bloomberg News, the BBC (national and regional), Deutsche Welle, CNBC, the Sunday Times, the Financial Times, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nStudent Law Review\n\nThe UWE Bristol Student Law Review (UWESLR) showcases the best examples of undergraduate research by students on the Law and Joint Awards programmes.\n\nPublished annually, the UWESLR is intended to both promote high quality student work and enhance the sense of community amongst researchers within the Bristol Law School.\n\nEnquiries\n\nWe welcome any enquires about our work and research. Please direct any general enquiries to Professor Vikas Kumar."
