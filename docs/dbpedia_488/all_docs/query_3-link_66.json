Further opportunities include mentoring schemes, human rights and legal tech placements and much more.\n\nOur facilities\n\nLive and learn in great facilities, an exciting UK city and one of the largest legal centres outside London\n\nThe Law School facilities provide the very best blend of tradition and innovation. Much of the teaching is based in the iconic Wills Memorial Building at the heart of Bristol, with its gothic tower, Great Hall and library - and gargoyle framed windows of its lecture halls. Across the road in Berkeley Square is another historic building, housing modern research suites, seminar and tutor rooms and a state-of-the-art Moot Court where you can also test out your debating and negotiating skills. Bristol itself is a vibrant, culturally diverse city, small enough to feel warm and friendly, but big enough to provide outstanding extracurricular opportunities, including a host of clubs, sporting activities and community and volunteering groups.\n\nWhy Bristol?"
