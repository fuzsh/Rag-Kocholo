        "text": "FALL RIVER — If you've never gotten a college degree, Bristol Community College is now literally giving them away for free — as long as you study and earn it.\n\nGov. Maura Healey on Monday signed into law the $57.78 billion Fiscal 2025 state budget, which in part establishes the MassEducate program, a new initiative that makes every community college in the state free for anyone who has never earned a degree.\n\nThe program will pay all your tuition and fees, and provide a stipend for books and supplies for some students.\n\n\"This means that now, more than ever, higher education is within reach,\" stated Bristol Community College President Laura L. Douglas.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the MassEducate program:\n\nMassReconnect: Could you go to community college for free? Here's how to know.\n\nHow much does the MassEducate program cost?\n\nThe state budget allocates $93.5 million to fund the program.\n\nWho is eligible for the MassEducate program?\n\nAnyone without a prior college degree is eligible for the program and can earn a college degree. All 15 community colleges statewide, including Bristol, are participating.\n\nThere are no limits on a student’s age or income level.\n\nWasn’t community college already free?\n\nNo. Massachusetts previously has had a program called MassReconnect, which extends free community college tuition to those 25 or older without a degree. This new program, which builds off that one, removes the age limit and makes free community college open to students right out of high school.\n\nBenefits of free college: Bristol students discuss MassReconnect, other support programs with top education officials\n\nAre there any other benefits to MassEducate?\n\nThe program provides an allowance of up to $1,200 per academic year toward books, supplies and other expenses, based on your household income.\n\nMassReconnect also has a stipend for supplies, up to $600.\n\nDo people actually take advantage of this program?\n\nYes. According to enrollment figures at Bristol, after MassReconnect was implemented in August 2023, the college’s enrollment from the Spring 2023 to Spring 2024 semesters increased by 7.4%. There was a 16.3 % rise in Black, Indigenous, People of Color students and an almost 31% increase in the number of adult learners.\n\n“MassReconnect has demonstrated students' eagerness to pursue their educational goals. Free community college benefits all in the community, not just those obtaining a degree,\" Douglas stated.\n\n“Supporting a higher level of educational attainment and less debt is a long-term investment in the region’s workforce, contributing to a stronger economy, greater equity and healthier communities,” she added.\n\nState Sen. Michael J. Rodrigues, D-Westport, chairman of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, said the measure is a “transformative investment” that will help build the state’s workforce.\n\n“These historic measures enable residents to remain in the state, solidifying our economic future for generations to come,” said Rodrigues.\n\nCan people use the MassEducate program to enroll in the fall?"
