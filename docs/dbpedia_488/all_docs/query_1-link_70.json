        "text": "Published on Friday 19 July, a new book, ‘Rethinking Governance in Public Service Outsourcing’, offers fresh insights into the concept of co-opting the fundamental obligations that non-state providers of public, state services have to society.\n\nIn October 2024, new legislation (the Procurement Regulations 2024) will come into effect in the UK which aims to change the way public money is spent on buying services or products from private companies.\n\nThe book’s author, Nina Boeger, Professor of Law, The City Law School, City St George’s, University of London, suggests that the law could provide more flexibility to national or local government when awarding contracts, and argues that this is a golden opportunity to innovate. She says:\n\nWhat’s more, is that this is a win-win situation. Giving contracts to companies or organisations doesn’t just solve problems in public services outsourcing. It also helps to create a more sustainable economy. Public contracting is a really powerful tool for steering behaviour, that doesn’t involve more tax or more regulation.\n\nBoeger argues that there are many issues with the ‘outsourcing’ or ‘public procurement’ that has been increasingly used across the UK’s public sector for decades.\n\nOne problem she cites is that companies providing services can exploit gaps in contracts: a prison service provider might provide fewer guards, or less time off for each guard. Another is where one company effectively takes over whole areas – SERCO, GS4, or Carillon, for example – with the state depending on them so much that there’s no real market of providers, incurring big problems if they fail.\n\nShe argues that the NHS, and the care home and construction sectors have all experienced these issues too, and that fundamentally, private companies are required to take the steps that incur these issues, because their obligation is to their shareholders, and to maximise profit, rather than a public obligation to society as a whole.\n\nProfessor Boeger shares that, so far, steps to resolve these problems have included:\n\ntrying to draft watertight contracts\n\nusing the procurement process to hold providers to account\n\nimposing tougher regulations\n\nand insourcing (where some things go back into public ownership, such as the national probation service, and some local councils taking refuse collection back in-house).\n\nHowever, she suggests that none of these steps are foolproof, and all have downsides.\n\nShe argues that if public contracts went to providers whose structures and obligations were more aligned with public obligations to society as a whole, the downsides of outsourcing would reduce significantly, and that to some extent this is happening already in:\n\nsmall and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), which tend to be embedded in local communities, can be a better bet than large conglomerates\n\nthe voluntary community and social enterprises (VCSEs) can be even better\n\nbut these are largely absent from mainstream public procurement provision especially in larger procurements and at national government level.\n\nProfessor Boeger also suggests how the benefits from these insights could be scaled up, using many more imaginative forms of company law.\n\nShe recommends that when choosing a service provider, local or national government could look at three factors:\n\nwhat is the purpose of the organisation: profit-maximising for shareholders, or delivery of local services?\n\nwho has the power in the organisation: shareholders, members, employees as partners, employees represented on the board?\n\nwhere does the profit go: to shareholders or to a foundation which supports other aims than profit-maximisation to shareholders?\n\nThere being a world of different models in company law, beyond the narrow extractive approach of shareholder profit maximisation.\n\n‘Rethinking Governance in Public Service Outsourcing, Private Delivery in Sustainable Ownership’ is published by Bristol University Press."
