        "text": "The University of the West of England, Bristol is a higher education corporation, like many other universities, by virtue of the Education Reform Act 1988 which enabled the Privy Council to create an Instrument of Government (PDF) establishing the University in February 1993.\n\nThe Governance is determined by the Articles of Government (PDF), which sets out the respective roles of the Board of Governors, the Principal (Vice-Chancellor) and Academic Board.\n\nOur formal name is University of the West of England Higher Education Corporation.\n\nCharitable status\n\nAs a Higher Education Corporation, the University is classed as an exempt charity under Schedule 3 to the Charities Act 2011. This means that for its charitable activities the University benefits from the status of a charity but it is not registered with the Charity Commission.\n\nThe Office for Students (OfS) is the Principal Regulator of universities holding exempt charity status, and as such is responsible for ensuring that UWE Bristol fulfills its obligations under charity law.\n\nAddress for correspondence\n\nClerk to the Board of Governors\n\nUniversity of the West of England, Bristol\n\nFrenchay Campus\n\nColdharbour lane\n\nBristol\n\nBS16 1QY\n\nYou can also email queries to Chris Gledhill at Chris.Gledhill@uwe.ac.uk, Deputy Clerk to the Board of Governors."
