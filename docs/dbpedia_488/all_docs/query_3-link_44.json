        "text": "Overview\n\nThe MSc in Social Legal Studies presents an exciting opportunity to explore the role of law in society at a critical time in history - and cultivate a deep understanding of interdisciplinary approaches to the study of law and legal phenomena.\n\nOn the programme you will develop rigorous research skills and the ability to engage in broader social understanding, providing a sound basis to progress to a PhD or a career in socio-legal research through the study of different research methodologies across the social sciences and law.\n\nThe MSc has an emphasis on practical research training, on the ability to plan, research and write a sophisticated dissertation - and to think in broad theoretical terms about the law in society. In addition to presenting an ideal introduction to academic research, it also offers excellent preparation for working for NGOs and other organisations that works for legal or social change or within government.\n\nOn the MSc, you will pursue independent, in-depth study of socio-legal topics, and engage in lively debates in a thriving research culture across social sciences and law. The range of units offered makes this master's programme suitable for graduates from any discipline who have an interest in the way law may work in society.\n\nThe programme is one of five South West Doctoral Training Partnership interdisciplinary Pathways delivered by world-leading researchers from the University of Bristol, University of Bath, University of the West of England and University of Exeter.\n\nFind out how you can do more with the law at the University of Bristol Law School.
