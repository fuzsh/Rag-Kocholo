Bristol Law School is one of the top-rated ‘post 1992’ law departments in the country, scoring consistently high ratings in the official research assessment exercises. This reflects the fact that legal research provides a central focus for the work of the Law School, and that many staff are engaged in research of national and international significance.

The Law School also places emphasis on nurturing new career researchers, investing in providing an environment in which they can flourish, and on using research to enrich the learning experience of students.
