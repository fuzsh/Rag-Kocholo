The University of Bristol Law School has launched a new course for anyone interested in healthcare. The LLM in Health, Law and Society, is a distinctive, master’s level degree that goes beyond traditional courses on

healthcare law to look at the relationships between law, governance and health

across society and governmental sectors. The course is offered on a full or part-time basis.

Marking a clear evolution in the field

of Law and Health,

the

programme reflects the urgent challenges facing a fast-evolving

healthcare world and covers issues that have far-reaching consequences for individuals

and social institutions – issues such as end-of-life decisions, reproductive

justice, right to health and medical negligence.

As such, students will be tackling

wide-ranging questions concerning the impacts of law, regulation, policy, and practice on

health and well-being, in a subject that requires collaboration across public, private

and third-sector organisations and considers the wider environmental and social

determinants of ill-health and the associated inequalities.

Students will be challenged by

internationally recognised academics

with

a wealth of experience working with organisations responsible for policy

development, professional regulation, and social advocacy. They will become part of our new

centre for health, law and society set up in the belief that health policy should address all forms of health,

rather than narrowly focus on physical health – and that prevention of ill

health and the promotion of good health are crucial components of health

policy, and not to be ignored by a near-exclusive Health Law focus on

remediation of ill health.

And they will develop understanding and transferable

skills that open up diverse career paths

in policy, health care management, health regulation,

health care provision, legal practice, public health practice, advocacy and

legal/policy research

at the third-most targeted

university by Britain’s top 100 employers – a university that sees global health as a key priority

area.
