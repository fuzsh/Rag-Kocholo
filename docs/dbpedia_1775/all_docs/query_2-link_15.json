        "text": "By Global Policy Forum and partners\n\nJanuary 2007\n\nSee Full Report\n\n\"When we identify positively an enemy target, we're going to go ahead and take it out with every means we have available. I like to remember what Viscount Slim said during the Burma campaign. He said, \"Use a sledgehammer to crush a walnut.\" And that's exactly what we will do. We will use force, overwhelming combat power when it's necessary.\"\n\n- US Major General Charles H. Swannack Jr. [1]\n\nThe US Coalition has used overwhelming military force to attack Iraqi cities on grounds that they were \"insurgent strongholds.\" The offensives, involving air and ground bombardment and armored assaults, have resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, large civilian casualties and colossal destruction of the urban physical infrastructure, making affected cities at least partly uninhabitable. In addition to the two well-known offensives against Falluja in April and November 2004, there have been assaults on a number of other cities, including Najaf (April and August 2004), Tal Afar (September 2004 and September 2005), Samarra (October 2004), al-Qaim (April-May 2005), Haditha (May 2005), Samarra (October 2004 and March 2006), and Ramadi (June-July 2006). These operations have affected more than two million people [2] and have clearly violated numerous articles of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nPrelude to the Attack: Sealed-off Cities and Heavy Curfews\n\nUS soldiers aim their guns as Iraqi civilians flee their homes during a day of heavy gun battles in Najaf.\n\nPhoto credit: Hadi Mizban/Associated Press\n\nIn preparation for impending military operations, Coalition forces have routinely encircled the targeted areas with sandbags and earthen barricades, as well as barriers of razor wire, to control all entry and exit. In massive operations, deploying thousands of troops, with helicopters and armored construction vehicles, they have cordoned off the areas, closing highways and streets, setting up roadblocks and checkpoints. In the case of Tal Afar, the attacking forces built an 8-foot high, 12-mile long dirt wall that ringed the entire city. [3]\n\nBeleaguered residents have been subject to intensive screening at check points, in order to enter and leave their cities [4] and they have been required to carry special identification cards. At the checkpoints, many have been arbitrarily arrested or detained, while others have been denied access for insufficient documents. \"We are like birds in a cage,\" said a resident of Abu Hishma to the New York Times, complaining of the humiliation endured. [5]\n\nIn Falluja, beginning immediately before the November 2004 siege, US forces imposed a strict curfew, including restriction of movement within the city of all men under 45 years of age. [6] Similar curfews were imposed on Ramadi, Tal Afar and many other cities. The UN reported that road closings and curfews in Ramadi raised prices and created a shortage of basic supplies in early July 2006 before the main attacks on the city began. [7] The village of Abu Hishma was locked down for 15 hours a day, preventing residents from going to the mosque for prayers and badly disrupted many families' livlihoods. [8] US forces have routinely fired on any moving person or vehicle after the curfew. [9]\n\nCoalition troops have seized complete control of all movement into and out of the cities, including all goods and supplies, water, food, medicines, and emergency assistance of all kinds. This \"sealing off\" strategy seeks to isolate insurgents and show ordinary civilians the heavy cost of not cooperating with Coalition forces. Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Sassaman described the approach quite bluntly in the early months of the occupation: \"With a heavy dose of fear and violence, and a lot of money for projects, I think we can convince these people that we are here to help them.\" [10]\n\nForced Evacuation and Those Who Remain\n\nIn preparation for the offensives, the US and its allies have issued warnings of impending military operations to the civilian population, urging residents to leave their homes and abandon the urban area. The resulting massive displacement has put tens and even hundreds of thousands of civilian at risk,as they are thrust abruptly into the countryside without water, food or shelter. The displacement has also created an excuse for the attackers --that all non-combattants have fled, so that free-fire zones within the target area are justified. [11] In Tal-Afar, US forces played messages over loudspeakers warning residents to evacuate, while starting to bomb the neighborhood of Sarai. [12] Most of the population (80 percent according to Jon Brain, the BBC's correspondent in Baghdad [13] ) eventually fled to escape the heavy fighting.\n\nIn many other cases, similarly large proportions of the urban population have left their homes and fled. The most fortunate could seek refuge with out-of-town relatives, but the majority were exposed to extremely difficult conditions and eventually forced to stay in temporary shelters and camps, which were set up for the displaced persons by the Red Crescent, the UN or relief organizations. In Falluja, a city of about 300,000, over 216,600 displaced persons had to seek shelter in overcrowded camps during the winter months, inadequately supplied with food, water and medical care. [14] Those fleeing al-Qaim, a city of about 150,000, totaled some 100,000 persons, according to the Iraqi Red Crescent Society (IRCS). [15] People in Ramadi estimated that about 70 percent of the city's population of 400,000 left in advance of the US onslaught. [16]\n\nWhile many have left the cities, significant numbers have remained â an estimated 50,000 in Falluja [17] and more than 100,000 in Ramadi. [18] Coalition forces have assumed that those remaining are insurgents or sympathizers. But those staying behind have included large numbers of civilians, unable or unwilling to abandon their homes, including the old, the sick, and the fearful.\n\nCutting Off Water, Food and Electricity\n\nThe Coalition has repeatedly denied water to the residents of Iraqi cities under siege, including Falluja, Tal Afar and Samarra, affecting up to 750,000 civilians. [19] Water is the most basic necessity, because humans can only survive a short time without it. Many families have only limited emergency storage and cannot survive long once the central supply has been cut. Along with water, the Coalition has cut off electricity (which may be used to power local wells), and also food and medical supplies. It has created a \"state of siege\" and imposed a humanitarian crisis on the entire remaining civilian population of the target cities.\n\nIn September 2004, the US \"turned off\" water supplies to Tal Afar \"for at least three days,\" according to the Washington Post. [20] In October 2004, the Independent reported that \"US-led forces cut off power and water\" in Samarra. [21] And in November 2004, the UN reported a similar cut-off of vital necessities in Falluja, \"directly affecting civilians (approximately 50,000 people then remaining inside [the city]) for whom water is a basic need and a fundamental human right.\" [22] Supplies of basic necessities were unavailable within Falluja for many days and were withheld by the Coalition even from the displaced citizens in camps outside, again according to the UN. [23] The UN more recently reported that in early July 2006, US forces imposed a \"total blockade\" of Rutba \"for approximately four days\" followed by subsequent blockades \"intermittently.\" [24]\n\nThese methods seem to be part of a deliberate policy of collective punishment, with the goal of forcing civilians to leave and pressing them to turn over insurgent fighters. [25] In some cases, the Coalition has used the siege openly as a bargaining tool. In Ramadi, US and Iraqi forces reportedly told residents that they would not get water, electricity, telephones and other services back unless they would hand over \"the terrorists.\" [26] According to Lieutenant Colonel Hassan al-Medan, the Iraqi spokesperson for the operation in Najaf, \"if we allow the entrance of food and medicines to the city we are just feeding the insurgents\" [27] â this in spite of thousands of civilians still within the area.\n\nIn his annual report to the Human Rights Commission in March 2005, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Jean Ziegler, denounced such practices. [28] Ziegler later said in a press conference that the \"Coalition's occupying forces are using hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population,\" calling this \"a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.\" [29]\n\nConfinement of Journalists and Blockage of Media Coverage\n\nPrior to the major assaults, Coalition commanders have prevented journalists from entering the targeted cities. All media workers not \"embedded\" with US forces have been banned for the duration of the battle and usually a long time afterwards. Sometimes, even embedded media have been refused access. This gives the Coalition almost complete control over international public perceptions of what is happening on the battlefield.\n\nPreceding US military operations in Najaf in August 2004, Iraqi police encircled a hotel where journalists were staying, ordering them to leave the city and threatening to arrest all those who did not comply with the order. [30] While claiming that the ban was based on concerns for the safety of the journalists, police officers said they would confiscate all cell phones and cameras. [31] In Falluja, the US military banned all non-embedded journalists from the city. Reports have mentioned that journalists and camera crews were arrested and their equipment confiscated, without explanation, before being released later without charges. [32]\n\nReporters Without Borders, referring to Najaf, condemned \"the totally unacceptable imposition of an information blackout\" and insisted that \"the presence of journalists on the spot is indispensable, as the worst atrocities are always committed in the absence of witnesses.\" [33]\n\nMassive Bombardment\n\nWhile Coalition forces have inflicted prolonged and intensive air and ground bombardment on these cities, destroying thousands of homes, shops, mosques, clinics and schools, and â inevitably â killing and injuring many civilians. [34] The strategy of massive and indiscriminate bombardment, in advance of ground offensives, has reduced the number of Coalition casualties, at a heavy cost in life and injury to the remaining city residents.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that in Falluja, an \"official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described 12 hours of overnight strikes by American helicopters, fighter-bombers, field artillery and tanks as Ã¢â¬Ëshaping operations.' Military commanders use the term as shorthand for battlefield preparation, combat operations specifically intended to remove enemy strong points in advance of an assault.\" [35] In the second assault on Falluja, the air strikes began on October 15, the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and continued for three weeks prior to the assault of November 7. In Najaf, US Marines bombarded the cemetery near the famous Imam Ali Shrine as well as much of the city center, in a massive attack backed by aircraft and tanks. In Ramadi, US forces carried out intensive bombardment, targeting the city's power stations, water treatment facilities, and water pipes, leaving many destroyed houses and no civilian services functioning. [36]\n\nUS military bombardment has destroyed large areas of the cities. Reports have spoken of leveling multi-block areas. \"Those who have witnessed US aircraft firing missiles into packed tenements in Sadr City, and have seen the resulting carnage, treat claims of Ã¢â¬Ëprecision strikes' Ã¢â¬Â¦ with deep skepticism\" commented the London-based Independent newspaper. [37]\n\nAir strikes and artillery bombardment are typically indiscriminate. According to an Iraq Body Count study on the lethality of different types of weapons, aircraft attacks have been responsible for the largest proportion of children killed. [38] In addition to massive bombardment with high explosives, there is clear evidence of the use of indiscriminate and especially injurious weaponry in these ferocious urban attacks. [39]\n\nUrban Assault, Snipers and Violent Searches\n\nAfter extensive bombardment, armed forces storm into the cities with columns of tanks and other armored vehicles. Heavy tank fire blasts into many structures, widening the urban desolation.\n\nTroops seize remaining buildings and carry out house-to-house searches. They often use violent methods to enter the houses, such as setting off explosives or knocking down part of the front wall with a military vehicle. [40]\n\nThe US military has increasingly relied on snipers to back-up infantry patrols. While commanders portray snipers as a precise high-tech method to avoid civilian casualties, in fact sniper teams often fire at anyone moving in the streets, in gardens or even inside of buildings. Everyone is treated in the besieged cities as an enemy. Using night goggles and special high-power scopes, snipers shoot at any moving object, which might be a civilian going out in desperate search for food or water, seeking medical care, escaping a collapsing building, or trying to leave the city. During the siege of Falluja in April 2004, the Guardian reported that US snipers shot an elderly woman carrying a white flag, as well as an ambulance and an aid worker delivering medical supplies on foot. [41] The UN reported that, in August 2006, snipers in Ramadi shot thirteen civilians who had breached the curfew, killing six and injuring seven just in one district.[42]\n\nAttacks on Medical Facilities and Prevention of Humanitarian Assistance\n\nPhoto credit: al-Jazeera\n\nCoalition troops have targeted medical facilities during urban offensives, and repeatedly destroyed and confiscated ambulances, making emergency care nearly impossible. In Fallujah, US troops \"destroyed a civilian hospital in a massive air raid, captured the main hospital and prohibited the use of ambulances.\" [43] All the medical personnel were arrested and the patients removed. Similarly, as the US prepared to launch a major assault on Najaf, Al-Hakeem hospital was \"taken over as a coalition military base, off limits to civilians.\" [44] Coalition forces did the same in Ramadi in the summer of 2006, when they captured the city's General Hospital, endangering the sick and rendering health care impossible.[45] According to the UN, troops captured the city's Specialized Hospital on July 5 and held it more than a week until July 13, after which time they withdrew but set up a patrol outside.[46] Further UN reports have spoken of Coalition snipers stationed on the roof of the Ramadi General Hospital, troops quartered in the hospital garden, and fearful residents avoiding the hospital altogether.[47] In Tal Afar, the UN reported that the city hospital has been \"occupied\" for six months. [48]\n\nCoalition forces have blocked access to humanitarian and medical relief convoys trying to enter cities, obstructing the work of humanitarian agencies trying to assess needs, deliver relief supplies and bring urgent assistance to the population.[49] In Samarra, in March 2006, US troops turned back the Iraqi Red Crescent Committee's aid convoys, leaving hundreds of families, including children, without medical assistance and basic supplies. [50]\n\nNajaf's top health official Falah Al-Mahani reported that the attack was causing \"a real catastrophe\" for local health services. \"Ambulances are prevented from reaching the injured people,\" he said. \"Our staff are not able to reach their hospitals. We are paralyzed.\" [51] As a result, a far higher proportion of injured civilians have died or suffered serious bodily damage than if medical care had been available.\n\nCivilian Casualties\n\nUS-led military operations in populated areas have caused scores of civilian deaths and injuries. People have been killed by ordnance explosions, collapsing buildings, fires, sniper shots and many other results of the attacks. While Coalition forces claim that most of those killed in attacks are men of military-age, many witnesses and other accounts report that many, if not most, of the victims in these operations have been women, children and the elderly. A 2005 UNAMI report concluded: \"The United Nations has been unable to obtain accurate figures concerning civilian losses following such operations but reports received from civil society organizations, medical sources and other monitors indicate that they are significant and include women and children.\" [52]\n\nDuring just the first week of the assult on Falluja in April 2004, the city General Hospital's Director Rafie al-Issawi reported that over 600 people had died, most of them women, children and the elderly. [53] In Najaf too, \"the total number killed was 570 with 785 injured. These statistics were taken from local hospitals and didn't include bodies buried in homes or elsewhere during the fighting.\" [54] Using accounts from tribal leaders, medical personnel and local witnesses, the Washington Post calculated that \"Operation Steel Curtain,\" a US offensive in November 2005, included bombings that killed 97 civilians in Husaybah, 40 in al-Qaim, 18 children in Ramadi, and many others in additional cities and villages. [55]\n\nAmnesty International and other human rights organizations have expressed concern at the growing number of civilian casualties due to the extremely violent US counter-insurgency operations. [56] The rising use of air strikes, which grew five-fold in 2005, has greatly increased the likelihood of civilian deaths in the battles over urban areas. [57]\n\nMassive Destruction\n\nHeavy fighting has led to fearful destruction in the cities under attack, including historical and religious sites, as well as water, electricity and sewage systems. US-led forces have bombed and even bulldozed numerous buildings, either as part of offensives or as retaliation against civilians who do not give information about insurgents. [58]\n\nPhoto credit: Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images\n\nIn Falluja, Operation Phantom Fury left the city in ruins, as a \"ghost town.\" The Study Center for Human Rights and Democracy, a Falluja-based non-governmental organization, reports that the offensive destroyed an estimated 70 percent of the buildings, homes and shops. [59] Speaking in a press conference about the scale of destruction in Najaf, Minister of State Qassim Daoud said: \"It is horrible and it is difficult to know where to start.\" [60] Officials in Najaf told IRIN, that \"a total of 72 shops, 50 hotels, 90 homes, three schools and dozens of cars were destroyed in the fighting.\" [61] They said \"there has also been massive destruction of the historic old part of the city, some of it impossible to repair.\" [62]\n\nIn the Ramadi operation of 2006, \"instead of continuing to fight for the downtown, or rebuild it,\" the New York Times reported, Coalition forces \"are going to get rid of it, or at least a very large part of it.\" [63] US Department of Defense newspaper Stars and Stripes reports that at least eight blocks of buildings were razed. \"We're used to taking down walls, doors and windows, but eight city blocks is something new to us,\" [64] admitted Marine 1st Lieutanant Ben Klay who took part in the demolition work in Ramadi.\n\nWith power, water and sewage systems dysfunctional and most buildings in ruins, many of these cities will remain only marginally habitable for a long time to come, in spite of announced (but largely un-implemented) reconstruction programs.\n\n\"Joint\" Military Operations and Criticism by Iraqi Authorities\n\nIncreasingly, US commanders have portrayed military operations against Iraqi cities as joint operations between US and Iraqi forces. This appears to be an effort to make the sieges more palatable to Iraqi and international opinion. Officially, US troops only \"back-up\" Iraqi forces or the two are said to carry out operations jointly. Observers say, though, that the US always takes the lead.\n\nIn fact, Iraqi government authorities have often been critical of the operations and condemned the conduct of US forces. After a week of heavy fighting in August 2004, Iraq's Interim Deputy President Ibrahim Al-Jaafari \"call[ed] for multinational forces to leave Najaf and for only Iraqi forces to remain there.\" [65] Deputy Governor of Najaf, Jawdat Kadhim Najam al-Quraishi, followed by 16 of the 30 members of the Najaf Provincial Council, resigned in protest against the assault. [66]\n\nIn the case of Falluja, feelings in Iraq ran high and several members of the Iraq Governing Council criticized the attacks and threatened to resign if the US commanders did not halt the operation. Adnan Pachachi, a leading member of the IGC qualified the operation \"as illegal and totally unacceptable.\" [67] And Ghazi Yawar, another prominent member said: \"How can a superpower like the United States put itself in a state of war with a small city like Falluja. This is genocide.\" [68]\n\nIn a statement on government television in August 2006, Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki sharply criticized US-Iraqi raids on Baghdad's Sadr City, saying that such operations \"violate the rights of citizens.\" \"This operation used weapons that are unreasonable to detain someone â like using planes,\" he said, before apologizing to the Iraqi people. He promised \"this won't happen again.\" [69]\n\nThese public statements signal serious differences between Iraqi politicians and US military commanders and they show how little control the sovereign and elected Iraqi government has over these offensives. Iraqi official opposition has not stopped the US military from continuing these campaigns.\n\nConclusion\n\nPrior to the November 2004 attack on Falluja, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote to President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, expressing his \"particular concern about the safety and protection of civilians.\" He continued: \"Fighting is likely to take place mostly in densely populated urban areas, with an obvious risk of civilian casualties...\" [70] Shortly afterwards, while the Falluja siege was still going on, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour called for an investigation into possible war crimes. [71] The United States and its partners ignored these warnings about the risk to civilians and war crimes. They continued with attacks on these and other Iraqi population centers.\n\nInternational law sets clear standards for the conduct of military operations. The Geneva Conventions prohibit attacks which do not clearly distinguish between military targets and civilians, or have a disproportionate impact on civilians. Coalition military operations have clearly violated these laws, with massive displacement of populations, indiscriminate killings of civilians, and large-scale destruction of habitation and urban infrastructure, including historic buildings and religious sites. Coalition forces have violated further provisions of the Conventions by deliberately targeting hospitals, stopping emergency medical care and blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid. In further violation of the prohibition of \"siege tactics,\" they have deprived civilians of food, water, electricity, medical supplies and vital services. Such practices have inflicted collective punishment on Iraqis. Taken together they represent a grave violation of international humanitarian law.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Major General Charles H.
