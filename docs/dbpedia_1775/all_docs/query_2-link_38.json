        "text": "abbreviations/acronyms/initialisms\n\nIn general, avoid unnecessary abbreviations in running text.\n\nCorrect: Professor Jones won the award.\n\nIncorrect: Prof. Jones won the award.\n\nAn exception would be when an exact date is listed. The months Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov. and Dec. should be abbreviated (e.g., She was born on Aug. 3, 2004.)\n\nWith entities whose abbreviations are not well known, spell out the entityâs name on first reference.\n\nCorrect: The school is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.\n\nIf the first reference will be followed with a second reference, the first reference should also include the abbreviation or acronym set off in parentheses:\n\nCorrect: The school is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The AACSB was founded in 1916 to provide accreditation to schools of business.\n\nWell known acronyms and initialisms can be used on first reference without spelling out the entityâs name. Some examples: FBI, IBM, NASA, NBA, NFL, SAT.\n\nacademic degrees\n\nUse AP Style: If mention of degree(s) is necessary to establish someoneâs credentials, the preferred form is to avoid an abbreviation and use instead a phrase such as: John Jones, who has a doctorate in psychology.\n\nUse an apostrophe in bachelorâs degree, a masterâs, etc. There is no possessive when writing Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science, or associate degree.\n\nUse such abbreviations as B.A., M.A., LL.D. and Ph.D. only when the need to identify many individuals by degree on first reference would make the preferred form cumbersome. Use these abbreviations only after a full name â never after just a last name.\n\nWhen used after a name, an academic abbreviation is set off by commas: John Snow, Ph.D., spoke. Do not precede a name with a courtesy title for an academic degree and follow it with the abbreviation for the degree in the same reference.\n\nCorrect: Aaron Furgason, Ph.D.\n\nIncorrect: Dr. Aaron Furgason, Ph.D.\n\nUse Dr. only for medical doctors. Faculty members should be referred to by their professorial titles (e.g., Professor Jones, Assistant Professor, Specialist Professor)\n\nUse periods in academic degrees and professional and honorary designations. For example, B.A., B.S., Ph.D.\n\nBaccalaureate is reserved for use in commencement materials and in accreditation language required by accrediting organizations. In all other instances, bachelor or bachelorâs is preferred.\n\nacademic departments and administrative offices\n\nCapitalize the formal names of departments and offices; do not capitalize informal names and incomplete designations.\n\nCorrect:\n\nDepartment of Chemistry\n\nthe chemistry department\n\nthe department\n\nthe Office of Undergraduate Admission\n\nthe admission office\n\nthe office\n\nadvisor\n\nThis is the preferred spelling in all official Monmouth University communications.\n\nAfrican American, Black\n\nAcceptable for an American Black person of African descent. Also acceptable is Black. The terms are not necessarily interchangeable. People from Caribbean nations, for example, generally refer to themselves as Caribbean American. Follow a personâs preference.\n\nafterward\n\nNot afterwards\n\nalumni\n\nUse the correct form of the word:\n\nAlumna denotes a singular female.\n\nMary Smith is an alumna of Monmouth University.\n\nAlumnae denotes plural female.\n\nThe women are Monmouth University alumnae.\n\nAlumni denotes plural male and plural when both men and women are included.\n\nBob, Mary, and the rest of the alumni group participated in the event.\n\nAlumnus denotes a singular male.\n\nBob Jones is an alumnus of Monmouth University.\n\nNever use casual terms alum or alumn. See also âclass yearsâ below.\n\nampersand\n\nUse only as part of formal corporate and publication names. Otherwise spell out and.\n\nbackward\n\nNot backwards\n\nbuildings, places, centers\n\nCapitalize the formal names of buildings, places, and centers.\n\nIn general, omit the first name of the person for whom a building or center is named, unless the reference is for formal, memorial, or ceremonial purposes (e.g., formal invitations, citations, donor acknowledgment).\n\nExamples:\n\nPozycki Hall\n\nWoods Theatre\n\nPlangere Center\n\nIn general, put the building name first followed by the room number:\n\nBey Hall, Room 208\n\nFor large auditoriums, put the room first followed by the building name:\n\nH.R.

In running text, a title is capitalized when it immediately precedes a personâs name (becoming, in effect, part of the name). The title is not capitalized when it follows a name.\n\nExamples:\n\nPresident Patrick F. Leahy;\n\nPatrick F. Leahy, president of Monmouth University;\n\nthe president\n\nVice President for Enrollment Management Robert D. Mc Caig\n\nRobert D. Mc Caig, vice president for enrollment management\n\nDean of the School of Science Steven M. Bachrach;\n\nSteven M. Bachrach, dean of the School of Science\n\nthe dean of the School of Science;\n\nthe dean\n\nProfessor of English Kristin Bluemel;\n\nKristin Bluemel, professor of English;\n\nthe professor\n\nRichard Guilfoyle, professor emeritus of mathematics\n\nExceptions: A title may be capitalized when it appears on the line following the name (for example, on a letter, poster, or invitation or in running lists).\n\nplaces\n\nWhen referring to Monmouth University, âUniversityâ is always capitalized, except when used in press releases or media communications.\n\nThe formal names of buildings, schools, and places are capitalized.\n\nExamples:\n\nPollak Theatre; the theatre\n\nMarjorie K. Unterberg School of Nursing and Health Studies; the nursing school\n\ntests\n\nThe formal names of standardized tests are capitalized.\n\nExamples:\n\nAmerican College Testing (ACT)\n\nTest of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP) test\n\nCollege Level Examination Program (CLEP)\n\ncentury\n\nLowercase unless part of a name. Spell out numerals under 10. Use ordinals for 10 and above.\n\nExamples: the first century, 12th century, 20th Century Fox\n\nCenters of Distinction\n\nAcceptable on first reference. “the Center” or “the Centers” are acceptable in subsequent references.\n\nBruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University\n\nAcceptable on first reference. On subsequent references, âThe Bruce Springsteen Archives,â âthe Archives,â and âBSACAMâ are all acceptable.\n\nCenter for the Arts\n\nAcceptable in all references.\n\nInstitute for Global Understanding\n\nAcceptable in all references.\n\nKislak Real Estate Institute\n\nAcceptable in all references.\n\nMonmouth University Polling Institute\n\nAcceptable on first reference. On subsequent references “the Polling Institute” is acceptable.\n\nUrban Coast Institute\n\nAcceptable in all references.\n\nclass years\n\nDesignate graduation years as follows:\n\nJoe Jones â88\n\nJane Jones â89M (indicates a graduate degree recipient)\n\nJohn Jones â07, â10M (use commas to separate multiple class years)\n\nBobbi Brown â17HN (indicates honorary degree recipient)\n\nNote the direction of the apostrophe. It is the same as a regular possessive e.g., Steveâs hammer\n\nCapitalize âclassâ in all âClass ofâ references. Example: Members of the Class of 1970 gathered in the Great Hall.\n\nco-chair\n\ncoeducation\n\ncolon\n\nThe colon can be used to mark a break in grammatical construction equivalent to that marked by the semicolon. But the colon emphasizes the content relation between the separated elements, helping to expand upon the first sentence (e.g., Many of the policemen held additional jobs: Thirteen of them doubled as cab drivers.).\n\nA colon is used to introduce a formal statement, an extract, or a speech in dialogue.\n\nA colon is commonly used to introduce a list or a series.\n\nCapitalize the first word after a colon when it is a proper noun or the first word in a complete sentence.\n\ncomma\n\nMonmouth University uses the serial or Oxford comma. In a series consisting of three or more elements, commas separate the elements. When a conjunction joins the last two elements in a series, a comma is used before the conjunction.\n\nPlace the comma when necessary before a closing quotation mark, after a closing parenthesis.\n\nDo not use a comma to separate âJr.â, âSr.â, âIIâ, etc. from a personâs name (e.g., John Doe Jr.; NOT John Doe, Jr.) Exception: when an individual specifically indicates they style their name with a comma.\n\ncoursework\n\nOne word\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 stands for coronavirus disease 2019, and should be used when referring to the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. When referring to the virus itself, use coronavirus.\n\ndash/hyphen\n\nDashes separate, hyphens join.\n\nGenerally, use a hyphen to join two or more words that come before a noun to modify it, except with words ending in -ly. (e.g., The smartly dressed man bought the newspaper-wrapped fish.)\n\nAn em dash (represented by two hyphens when typing) is used to denote a sudden break in thought that causes an abrupt change in sentence structure (e.g., âWill heâcan heâobtain the necessary signatures?â Mills asked pointedly.).\n\nAn en dash is used to connect continuing, or inclusive, numbers including dates, times, or reference numbers. Examples: Mills attended from 1998â2001. The meeting is scheduled for 5â8 p.m. (See also âRangesâ entry below.)\n\nThe en dash is also used in a compound adjective when one of the elements of the adjective is an open compound or when two or more of the elements are hyphenated compounds: New YorkâLondon flight; postâCivil War period; nonâEnglishâspeaking countries.\n\nNever use ordinals (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd) in dates, unless part of an existing, official title.\n\nCapitalize the names of all months.\n\nExact dates are written in the sequence month-day-year, with the year set off by commas. (e.g., The events of April 18, 1775, have long been celebrated in song and story.)\n\nNote that when an exact date is listed, the months Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov. and Dec. should be abbreviated. (e.g., She was born on Aug. 3, 2004.) When a month and year (but no day) is given, no comma is needed and the month should always be spelled out completely. (e.g., The study is expected to run through August 2018).\n\nYears are expressed in numerals. Rather than beginning a sentence with a year, it is best to recast the sentence. (example: âThe company was founded in 2002â is preferable to â2002 was the year the company was founded.â\n\ndegrees\n\nThe word âdegreeâ should not follow an abbreviation.\n\nIncorrect: She has a B.A. degree in English.\n\nCorrect: She has a B.A. in English\n\nor\n\nShe has a bachelorâs degree in English.\n\nor\n\nShe has a Bachelor of Arts in English.\n\nWhen referring to degrees in general, the first letter of the degree should be lowercase.\n\nThey all earned masterâs degrees. She holds a bachelorâs degree.\n\nFormal names of degree programs should be used upon first reference.\n\ndoctor\n\nUse Dr. in first reference as a formal title before the name of an individual who holds a doctor of dental surgery, doctor of medicine, doctor of optometry, doctor of osteopathic medicine, doctor of podiatric medicine, or doctor of veterinary medicine: Dr. Jonas Salk.\n\nThe form Dr., or Drs. in a plural construction, applies to all first-reference uses before a name, including direct quotations. Do not continue the use of Dr. in subsequent references.\n\nDo not use Dr. before the names of individuals who hold other types of doctoral degrees. Instead, when necessary or appropriate: Cassandra Karoub, who has a doctorate in mathematics, was lead researcher. U.S. first lady Jill Biden, who has a doctorate in education, plans to continue teaching. U.S. second gentleman Doug Emhoff, a lawyer, is joining the faculty of Georgetown Law.\n\nIn a list: Stephanie Sanchez, Ph.D.\n\nDo not use Dr. before the names of individuals who hold only honorary doctorates.\n\ndollars and cents\n\nDo not show .00 (zero cents) when figures are mentioned.\n\nellipses\n\nUse an ellipsis (â¦) to indicate words left out of quoted material. Place a space before and after the ellipsis as if it were a three-letter word.\n\nIf the ellipsis is at the end of a completed sentence, use a four-point ellipsis. The four-point ellipsis is also used to indicate one or more sentences have been omitted.\n\nDo not use an ellipsis at the front or start of a sentence quote. Instead, capitalize the first letter of the first word and put it in brackets. (â[T]he times that try menâs souls.â).\n\nemail\n\nAlso, Email, but never e-mail. However, use hyphens for e-book, e-commerce, e-reader. Email is acceptable as a noun or verb.\n\nEOF\n\nEducational Opportunity Fund on first reference\n\net cetera; etc.\n\nUse of âetc.â is discouraged in formal writing, although it is more acceptable in lists, tables, direct quotations, and parenthetical series. Set off by commas; an alternative treatment is to punctuate it like any other final element in a series.\n\nextracurricular\n\nexperiential\n\nfaculty\n\nThe word faculty can be used as a plural noun.\n\nThe faculty are all in agreement.\n\nFaculty members are co-chairing the event.\n\nFaculty are co-chairing the event.\n\nHereâs how to refer to a faculty member:\n\nCynthia Huntington, the Frederick Sessions Beebe â35 Professor in the Art of Writing, has a new book of poems.\n\nEnglish professor Michael Waters is a poet.\n\nProfessor Michael Waters is a member of the English department.\n\nBrendan Nyhan is a professor of government.\n\nProfessor of Government Brendan Nyhan writes for The New York Times blog The Upshot. Professor Brendan Nyhan writes opinion pieces for The Times.\n\nfax\n\nUse as a noun or transitive verb.\n\nfieldwork\n\nOne word\n\nFirst Year Advising\n\nNote that there is no hyphen when referring to Monmouthâs program.\n\nFirst Year Seminar\n\nNo hyphen is used when referring to Monmouthâs graduation requirement. However, first-year student is hyphenated.\n\nfirst-year student\n\nDo not use freshman when referring to a first-year student.\n\nfull-time, full time\n\nOne works full time doing full-time work.\n\nGPA\n\nAcceptable on first reference. When spelled out, âgrade point averageâ (no hyphens, open compound) is correct.\n\nhawk\n\nUse lowercase when referring to the animal in general. Capitalize Hawk when referring to the University mascot or campus member.\n\nhealth care\n\nTwo words in all uses\n\nheadlines\n\nWhen using initial capitalization style for a headline, capitalize the titleâs first word, last word, and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions. Articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions are lowercased.\n\nhome page\n\nTwo words\n\ninclusive (gender-neutral) language\n\nIt is best to use gender-neutral language when writing. Donât say âheâ when referring to an unspecified person. Instead, recast the sentence into the plural, or avoid the use of pronouns altogether.\n\nExample: Each student is expected to turn in his paper on Tuesday.\n\nbetter:\n\nStudents are expected to turn in their papers on Tuesday.\n\nor\n\nThe studentsâ papers are due on Tuesday.\n\nor\n\nEach student is expected to turn in his or her paper on Tuesday.\n\nIf itâs impossible to solve the problem using these approaches, remember that âhe or sheâ is preferable to âhe/she.â\n\nAvoid gender-specific titles or terms:\n\ninstead of … say\n\nchairman … chair\n\nbusinessman … business executive, manager\n\ncameraman … camera operator\n\ncoed … student, female student\n\ncongressman … representative, senator\n\nfireman … firefighter\n\nforefathers … ancestors\n\nforeman … supervisor\n\nmailman … mail carrier\n\nDear Sir … Dear Director, Coordinator, Manager\n\ninternet/intranet\n\nWith a lowercase i\n\nlay, lie\n\nLay is a transitive verb. It needs an object to complete its meaning: to put down or place; to cause to lie or deposit.\n\nLie is an intransitive verb. It does not take an object: to be or put oneself in a reclined position usually on a horizontal space of some sort.\n\nExample: You can lay your book on the nightstand before you lie down in bed.\n\nLGBT, LGBTQ\n\nAcceptable in all references for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning and/or queer. In quotations and the formal names of organizations and events, other forms such as LGBTQIA and other variations are also acceptable with the other letters explained. I generally stands for intersex, and A can stand for asexual (a person who doesn’t experience sexual attraction), ally (some activists decry this use of the abbreviation for a person who is not LGBT but who actively supports LGBT communities) or both. Use of LGBT or LGBTQ is best as an adjective and an umbrella term. Don’t use it, for instance, when the group you’re referring to is limited to bisexuals. Walters joined the LGBTQ business association. Queer is an umbrella term covering people who are not heterosexual or cisgender and is acceptable for people and organizations that use the term to identify themselves.\n\nnames\n\nIf there is a reference to an individual, use first and last names in initial reference, last name only in subsequent references. Avoid nicknames unless specifically requested by individual. As a rule of thumb use job or professional titles in the initial reference, but no social titles.\n\nCorrect: Professional title: Dr.\n\nExample: Dr. Jonas Salk\n\nIncorrect: Social title: Mr., Mrs.\n\nExample: Mr. Jonas Salk\n\nnationalities and race\n\nCapitalize the proper names of nationalities, peoples, races, tribes, etc.: Arab, Arabic, African, American, Caucasian, Cherokee, Chinese (both singular and plural), Eskimo (plural Eskimos) or Inuit, French Canadian, Japanese (singular and plural), Jewish, Nordic, Sioux, Swede, etc.\n\nnon\n\nGenerally use without hyphen, but hyphen can be used, and is generally used when the base word begins with a capital letter.\n\nExamples: nonprofit, non-Euclidean geometry\n\nnumerals\n\nSpell out one through nine. Use numerals for 10 and above, with the exception of ages, which are always given in numeral form.\n\nCorrect: There were seven students living on the floor.\n\nCorrect: There are 17 students living on the floor.\n\nCorrect: Sarah is 4 years old. Joshua is 6 years old.\n\nAll numerals beginning a sentence are written out, no matter the length, or if it would normally be expressed in figures. If it is too cumbersome to write out, reword the sentence so the numeral is not at the beginning.\n\nThirteen squirrels ran across the Great Lawn.\n\nWrite figures out numerically if they are used with a percentage sign for scores, court decisions, vote tallies, ratios, and similar constructions.\n\n7% or 7 percent; 270% or 270 percent\n\nUse figures with million, billion, or trillion in all except casual uses: Iâd like to make a billion dollars. But: The nation has 1 million citizens. I need $7 billion. The government ran a deficit of more than $1 trillion.\n\nUse commas for figures 1,000 and above. A comma is used every three numbers from the right to left.\n\nIf you are indicating a rank or a position use the No. (abbreviation for number).\n\nFor very large sums of money use figures with a dollar sign; spell out million or billion.\n\n$2.6 million; between $3 and $4 billion\n\noff-campus, off campus/on-campus, on campus\n\nThe hyphen is used when off-campus is used as a compound modifier. No hyphen is needed when used as a prepositional phrase.\n\nExamples: The students live off campus. The students live in an off-campus apartment. The on-campus dining options are plentiful. Most students prefer to eat on campus.\n\nonline\n\none word\n\nperiod\n\nUse one space after the period at the end of sentences.\n\nplural or singular\n\nWhen using â(s)â to show that a word can be either singular or pluralâfor example, item(s)âtreat the word as a plural.\n\nCorrect: The item(s) were blue.\n\npost-masterâs\n\nquotation marks\n\nQuotation marks are used to denote direct quotes from other authorâs sources.
