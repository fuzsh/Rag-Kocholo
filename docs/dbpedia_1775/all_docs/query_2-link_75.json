        "text": "Our work aims to understand how animal behaviour affects evolution. Does behaviour speed up the pace of evolutionary change or prevent it altogether? Can the behaviour of one animal cause evolutionary change in a social partner, like its mate or its offspring? What effect does behaviour have on genetic variation? And how does behaviour contribute to speciation? Most of our work focuses on burying beetles now, though I retain an interest in avian brood parasites. Part of our research involves running experimental evolution in the laboratory and watching new adaptations evolve in real time. We then map the findings of this work onto wild populations at different woodland sites across Cambridgeshire, to understand how evolution unfolds in nature. We use a range of techniques from genomic analyses to behavioural observations, field work and phylogenetic analysis.\n\nCurrent research topics include:\n\nHow parental care contributes to evolutionary change (ERC-funded project and Ben Jarrett’s PhD project)\n\nThe evolution of beetle-microbe interactions (Royal Society funded project and Swastika Issar's PhD project)\n\nThe evolution of beetle-mite interactions (Syuan-Jyun Sun’s PhD Project)\n\nStimulation of female fecundity by male burying beetles (Eleanor Bladon’s MPhil project, co-supervisor with Sonia Pascoal)\n\nEpigenetics and evolutionary change (Rahia Mashoodh’s BBSRC Future Leaders Fellowship project, in collaboration with Eric Miska)\n\nThe role of phenotypic plasticity in the adaptive radiation of the Vidua finches (Co-I in collaboration with Claire Spottiswoode, Leverhulme Trust-funded project and Gabriel Jamie’s PhD project)\n\nSpeciation of the Australian Chalcites cuckoos (Co-I in collaboration with Naomi Langmore, Australian National University, ARC-funded project)\n\nEvolution of host defence portfolios (Co-I in collaboration with Øistein Holen, Oslo University, Norwegian Research Council-funded project)\n\nKey Publications\n\nDuarte, A., Welch, M., Swannack, C., Wagner, J. & Kilner, R.
