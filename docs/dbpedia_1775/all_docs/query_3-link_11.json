        "text": "Generals aren't the only ones against the war\n\nOf the six retired generals who have called for Donald Rumsfeld to step down, three of them, including the former commander of key forces in Iraq, are products of the U.S. Military Academy.\n\nRetired Army Maj. Gen. John Batiste, who led the 1st Infantry Division in Iraq in 20042005, last week joined the growing ranks of former generals calling for Rumsfeld's resignation.\n\nIn an interview yesterday, Batiste, now president of Klein Steel Service in Rochester, said the values of honesty and honor instilled in him as a cadet were clearly a factor in his decision.\n\nThe Academy is \"my bedrock foundation. That foundation has shaped, in significant ways, who I am,\" he said. \"I put away the uniform so I could be vocal. It was the most gutwrenching decision I've ever made.\"\n\nSome military analysts have praised the generals for standing up to a defense secretary whom many in uniform see as arrogant and authoritarian. Others worry that the public rebuke could undermine civilian control of the armed forces.\n\nDennis E. Showalter, a military historian at Colorado College who has taught at West Point, said he isn't surprised Academy graduates are at the center of the debate over Rumsfeld.\n\nWest Point sets the tone for the Army's senior officer corps: roughly onethird of current generals earned their stripes at the historic Hudson River institution.\n\nToday's retired officers were also yesterday's young soldiers. Some were on the ground during another unpopular war, managed by another unpopular defense secretary, Robert McNamara.\n\n\"There is a sense that the military, and the Army in particular, had in fact been hung out to dry by the civilian administration\" in Vietnam, Showalter said. \"The Vietnam War was scarring in the officer corps in ways that have endured.\"\n\nHighranking officers aren't the only Academy alumni going public with their criticism. Bill Cross, a 1962 West Point graduate living near Syracuse, helped launch a Web site last week, www.westpointgradsagainstthewar.org, that encourages others to speak out against the Iraqi conflict.\n\n\"I spoke out against the war before we got into it, but haven't really pulled out this West Point card, out of loyalty (to the institution.) I know each of us did not take this step lightly,\" said Cross, a Vietnam veteran and former professor of military psychology at West Point.\n\nStill, while public criticism of Rumsfeld has dominated headlines in recent weeks, some question the graduates' timing.\n\n\"I often told the cadets whom I taught that the real reason they were issued a saber was that they might someday find an issue so important that they would feel compelled to fall on it in protest,\" said Ted Crackel, author of \"West Point: A Bicentennial History,\" and a former West Point history professor. \"Speaking out in retirement, however, is hardly falling on one's sword.\"\n\nBut Jim Ryan, another 1962 graduate who launched the antiwar Web site with Cross, disagreed.\n\n\"We understand that there is a natural reluctance on the part of West Pointers to speak out on the matters that we are giving voice to. But the times have changed,\" he said. —\n\n— Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld \"has shown himself incompetent strategically, — operationally and tactically and is far more than anyone else responsible — for what has happened to America's mission in Iraq. Rumsfeld must step — down.\"\n\n—\n\n— Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton, The New York Times, March 19\n\n—\n\n— 'I do not believe Secretary Rumsfeld is the right person to fight that — war (in Iran) based on his absolute failures in managing the war against — Saddam in Iraq.\"\n\n—\n\n— Maj. Gen. Charles H. Swannack Jr., The New York Times, April 14\n\n—\n\n— 'I think we've got a very long war in front of us, and I, for one, want — a secretary of defense who doesn't have such a dismal track record in — strategic decisions.\"\n\n—\n\n— Maj. Gen. John Batiste, the Times HeraldRecord, April 19"
