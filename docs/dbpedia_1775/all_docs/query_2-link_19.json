        "text": "TAJI, Iraq - In a ceremony at this sprawling Iraqi Army base in early January that drew virtually no attention abroad, the Iraqi military took what American officials say was a pivotal step and a calculated gamble in the effort to defeat the insurgency.\n\nAs nearly 100 Iraqi tanks, gun trucks and armored personnel carriers rumbled by a reviewing stand filled with ribbon-bedecked Iraqi and American generals, the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, and top Iraqi officers made an announcement: Iraq's national guard, a regional civil defense force formed less than two years ago, would be merged into the relatively small national army.\n\nWhat at first glance appeared to be a symbolic shift of command and set of new uniforms is now coming to be seen as an important example of finding new ways to train and equip Iraq's fledgling security forces to defend the country and to allow 150,000 American troops to leave, senior American and Iraqi officers say.\n\nThe 38,000 national guard troops will swell the regular army's ranks to nearly 50,000 soldiers, creating a unified ground force that will have common pay, uniforms and standards.\n\nBeing part of the army will make the former national guard soldiers more available for missions away from their home bases. Most guard units now conduct patrols and operations only in their region, often in tandem with American troops in places like Baghdad and Mosul.\n\nGen. Babakir al-Zibari, chief of staff of the Iraqi armed forces, said incorporating the national guard into the army would \"ensure unity of command and effort to meet the security challenges we currently face.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
