        "text": "The HDR asked readers on Facebook to respond to the following statement:\n\n“Wednesday marks 12 years since al-Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people in the worst terrorist attack in American history. Since then, the United States has invaded two nations as part of its resulting War on Terror, re-elected two presidents and sent children born that day to middle school.\n\n“What have we learned since Sept. 11, 2001? What have we forgotten?”\n\nHere are their responses:\n\n“It's a day that I know I will never forget, and I remember where I was. It's a terrible tragedy. However, remembering the day and highlighting the day by making the survivors/victims/families relive that day over and over with the images, videos, and the reading of the names -- I feel does more harm than good by not allowing people to heal.”-- Mary Murphy Strawn\n\n“I think the reading of the names is quite important. We have men and women fighting every single day overseas and each name is a somber reminder of what they're fighting for, and why.\n\n“My husband and I were in 5th grade when the attacks happened and he just returned from a deployment in May. It's ridiculous to me that those who were children at the time are fighting this battle still, but they are. And those names are what make it all worthwhile.” -- Olivia Nicole Lowman\n\n“We haven't learned anything. We are still engaging in the same interventionist policies that led to 9/11. We supported Bin Laden and the Muhjahideen in the 80's, and now we are about to support an entire new generation of Muslim extremists. Blood will flow through the streets of the US again if we continue down our current path.” -- Josh Flowers\n\n“What I have learned from this unforgettable tragedy is that on September 11th, 2001 we were all the same color, ash-gray. We were Americans, who let our guard down and forgot we had enemies. We saw people jump to their deaths, from shock or whatever went through their minds, we will never know. Our lives were changed forever that day. Now we know we have enemies, and are more aware of our surroundings, not paranoid, but aware. The reason it's important to remember this day is to remind us who we are. We must never be so careless again, and to honor those who died trying to save others, to feel a sense of pride in our country. We are the United States of America. Those who lost loved ones that day, will get through their grief, but never forget, and never should we.” -- Kay C. Sigmon\n\n“I watched the second plane hit on live television as I was getting dressed and ready to head to class for a test. I had just turned it on moments before the second hit took place. My college classes were canceled by the time I had reached the school. I took my friend flowers, because it was her birthday. She was very distraught in her kitchen, and everyone else in her home was watching their television. I had to go to work that afternoon where we were told not to say anything at all to the children in the after school care program even though they were so full of questions. I had to sleep with my television on for a week after that in fear that something else would happen. It all taught me not to take anything in life for granted.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“I am now married to someone who had moved here from New York. His aunt and uncle were there that day trying to get out of the city. They had to e-mail each other to keep in touch with each other and know where or how they each were due to not being able to call each other.\n\n“I sure haven't forgotten what that day taught me, but it seems that so many people have forgotten how precious their loved ones are to them and take for granted the time they have with them. People don't spend nearly as much time with their family and friends as they should or hold ongoing grudges against them. They forget that something or someone can end their life or the life of someone they care about in the blink of an eye.” -- Katie Carman\n\nSpecial area events commemorating 9/11:\n\nPatriots Day Remembrance ceremony\n\nWhere: The Sails on the Square, downtown Hickory\n\nWhen: Today, 6:30 p.m. -- music, 7 p.m. -- ceremony\n\nSpeaker: Major General Charles H. Swannack Jr. - U.S. Army (Retired)\n\nSt. Stephens High School assembly\n\nWhere: High school foyer, 3205 34th Street NE in Hickory\n\nWhen: Today, 11:15 a.m.\n\nWhat: Artifacts from the Twin Towers, including twisted steel, heavy first-floor stone floor tiles and an impressive I-beam from the towers.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
