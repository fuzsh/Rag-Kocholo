        "text": "Coal-tar product\n\nNot to be confused with Benzoyl, Benzyl, or Pennzoil. For other uses of \"benzol\", see Benzol.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, benzole or benzol is a coal-tar product consisting mainly of benzene and toluene. It was originally used as a \"motor spirit\", as were petroleum spirits. Benzole was also blended with petrol and sold as a motor fuel under trade names including \"National Benzole Mixture\" and \"Regent Benzole Mixture\".[1]\n\nConfusingly, in certain languages, such as German, Hungarian, Ukrainian and Russian, the word benzol (or benzole) means \"benzene\", and in some of these languages, words pronounced like \"benzene\" (e.g., the German word Benzin) can mean \"petrol\" or \"gasoline\".[2]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAntiknock agent\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
