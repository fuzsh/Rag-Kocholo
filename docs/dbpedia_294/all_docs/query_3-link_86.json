        "text": "\"And like Papa Smurf always says...\"\n\nBrainy Smurf (original French name Schtroumpf à Lunettes) is one of the main characters of the Smurfs comic books, the 1980s Smurfs cartoon show, and the 2021 Smurfs cartoon show.\n\nCharacter\n\nBrainy Smurf thinks he’s smarter than he really is, and he is certain that he’s smarter than everyone else. This is a Smurf who does not suffer from self-doubt. In fact, he refuses to admit when he’s wrong, and whenever someone proves it, he makes up an excuse.\n\nBrainy considers himself the most responsible member of the band and has proclaimed himself the right-hand man to Papa Smurf. He’s often repeating phrases such as, \"Like Papa Smurf always says…\" or \"Papa Smurf is always right, and when he says that…\" (and at times he finishes his sentences with the word \"Right?\"). The other Smurfs just roll their eyes and find inventive ways to shut him up. One running gag is that they \"eject\" him from the scene - unseen to the audience, an annoyed Smurf gives him a wallop in the butt (a kick), and we see him flying through the air.\n\nDespite his tendency to sometimes act like a spoilsport, he's still respected and deeply loved by the village. As long as he's not pushing his luck...\n\nBetween the release of \"Little Comics Collection\" version of \"The Hundredth Smurf\" and before the album release of \"The Black Smurfs\" (Brainy's glasses were originally exclusive to the 1961 Smurfs cartoon show prior to the album release of \"The Black Smurfs\"), the only thing that visually separates Brainy from the other Smurfs is his tendency to use his declarative finger when he makes speeches.\n\nPersonality\n\nComic Book/2021 TV Series Version\n\nBrainy is the most self-centered of the Smurfs, even more so than Vanity; he annoys almost everyone, up to and including Papa Smurf. Brainy has a penchant for showing off, claiming that he knows everything about everything, although the only things he knows well are things about himself... and even that is debatable. Brainy even claims to be his own favorite subject. Despite this, he is well-liked whenever he's not being a bossy know-it-all, which is all-too-frequently the case.\n\nHis house is filled with of stacks of books all written by himself. The books are either manuals or encyclopedias. Brainy always wants someone to read them, but even the nicest people turn them down... or merely pretend to like them for Brainy's benefit. He enjoys being a leader, always eager to be one in almost any activity. He's dramatic in nature, often inflating problems or freaking out far more than other Smurfs, which can lead to them yelling at him. In general, he's not very patient.\n\nBrainy is very cowardly. In one episode of the 2021 cartoon show, he is faced with the possibility of getting eaten by Azrael or Gargamel and panics. When the Smurfs rescue him, he believes Gargamel and Azrael are back and he suggests eating Dimwitty. When he gets out of the pot he was in, he says he was joking, but he doesn't sound very convincing. In \"Where's Papa Smurf?\", when Brainy hits Papa Smurf in an accident with his smurfway, he unsuccessfully blames Clumsy for it.\n\nBrainy constantly fails to use his intelligence constructively and for the benefit of other Smurfs, including himself. He almost always believes his book-smarts are better than the hand-on smarts of the other Smurfs, which leads him to be either whacked in the head (often with a mallet), booted out of the village, or in a rivalry with another Smurf, where Brainy eventually humiliates himself. Basically, Brainy is a bruised ego who consistently bruises it himself. In the 2021 TV series, Brainy is a lot less egotistical and more knowledgeable and smarter. He still brags about being smart and still annoying, but he is very kind, caring, humble, and selfless.\n\nDespite his little patience for tricks and fun, it does not always seem this way. In \"Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb\", Clumsy and Dimwitty are alerted from the bell as members of the fire brigade, but it turns out that Brainy is just enjoying playing on the ladder. However, he denies that he was doing this when Clumsy and Dimwitty see him, as they would be surprised to see such a serious Smurf playing.\n\n2021 TV Series Season 1 Interpretation\n\nWhile Brainy's characterization is more-or-less the same in the comic books, his lecturing patterns right before being booted out of sight sounded slightly different in episodes of the first season such as \"Bringing Up Smurfy\", \"Fake News\", \"Papa Times Two\" (at the end of the episode), and \"Smurfing Places\" -- most specifically stating to the other Smurfs if they agree with his views or ideas out of expectation regarding certain subjects, compared to his general portrayals of having the tendency of talking too much demonstrated in the original comic books and the second season onwards for the TV series.\n\n1981 TV Series Version\n\nThis version of Brainy was virtually identical to his original comic book portrayal in the first two seasons as a bookworm to begin with, with the only exception that he was portrayed as Papa Smurf's apprentice.\n\nThis would change in the third season where his incompetence and boasting ego started to increase around Season 3, after he started introducing his series of \"Quotations Of Brainy Smurf\" books --- his personal favorite books. Then by sixth season to the end, it shows that Brainy is incapable of doing anything right and causes plenty of trouble around the village such as framing Clumsy for losing Baby Smurf in \"The Smurfy Verdict\".\n\nIt's possible Brainy is quite smart. It's noticed that he was born to be a bookworm when he first got his glasses. Even before he started writing his books of 'wisdom,' he was an avid reader of books, which may explain his mentality of doing thing 'by the book'. Besides Papa Smurf, must have had a good reason to choose him to be his assistant. However, Brainy constantly fails to use his intelligence constructively and for the benefit of other Smurfs, including himself. He almost always believes his book-smarts are better than the hand-on smarts of the other Smurfs, which leads him to be booted out of the village, or in a rivalry with another Smurf, where Brainy eventually humiliates himself. Basically, Brainy is a bruised ego who consistently bruises it himself.\n\nRole in the Village\n\nApart from being Papa Smurf's apprentice, Brainy can (more often than not) be the primary or supporting source of discourse within the village. While he is knowledgeable when it comes to magic and potion making, Brainy often over-estimates himself, or doesn’t clearly follow directions, thinking that his way is best, which can cause many problems for both him and everyone else.\n\nHe will often nosily police Smurfs doing their jobs or chores as if he was an expert, even though it's incredibly rare it actually helps. Occasionally, he inspects Smurfs at night, though he often gets hit by a Smurf who wants him to be quiet. In the 2021 cartoon series, he is often seen doing this with a smurfway, which is a parody of segways.\n\nTrouble-Trouble-Trouble\n\nBrainy causes a lot of problems for the Smurfs sometimes. This is mostly because all he does is make things worse.\n\nAn example is when he forced everyone to be so quiet in \"Unsound Smurfs\", that not even a needle can drop, only because Papa Smurf wanted some peace and quiet to get some sleep. He went so far to make everything quiet, he cast a sound-proof barrier around the village that made no sound get in or out, but this also prevented anyone else from entering.\n\nHe also believes that he is smarter than everyone else and that he should be in charge. Sadly, most of his ideas (such as mind-controlling in \"Smurf, Yes Smurf!\") go wrong, and he usually finds a scapegoat for the mishaps he causes.\n\nHis heart, however, is always in the right spot; in the \"The Smurfs And The Book That Tells Everything\" adventure he uses The Book That Tells Everything to benefit the others and when - thanks to a dam break - he and Baby Smurf were stranded on a little sliver of land in the torrent. Brainy asked the book for help and it responded by telling him that it was too important and that he should give up Baby. Enraged by that prospect, Brainy tossed the book into the river before grabbing Baby and swimming to the shore.\n\n\"It was awful Papa Smurf, that miserable book actually told me to sacrifice Baby Smurf.\" - Brainy, after reaching the shore saving his own life and that of Baby, thus showing that whatever his flaws, when push comes to shove, he actually knows the right thing to do.\n\nIn the comic book version of \"King Smurf\", Brainy was also the first to protest against the jailing of Jokey, saying to the others that good old-fashioned reasoning would show King Smurf the error in jailing Jokey. He went into the castle and started a lecture about how humor shouldn't be considered a crime and that there really was no reason for Jokey to be jailed and that he and the other Smurfs with him didn't agree with the jailing... which led to Brainy being thrown out of the castle and the other Smurfs deciding that a good old-fashioned riot would work far better than reasoning.\n\nRelationship with Others\n\n\"We have this annoying Smurf who lives in our village who wears spectacles and is always going that we 'Should beware' and that we're 'Not supposed to be like that' and 'I'll tell Papa Smurf about that if you don't'. We all dislike him because of his constant meddling.\"\n\n\"What?! But I...\" (He's forcibly silenced)\n\nAstro Smurf to Papa Smurf (as Grandpa Swoof) talking about how life is in the Smurf village.\n\nBrainy is the least liked out of all the Smurfs. This is proven in the episode \"The Masked Pie Smurfer\". A masked Smurf has given every Smurf a chance to get back at someone they dislike by just giving him some smurfberries. In exchange for the berries, the Masked Pie Smurfer will throw Pie at the designated Smurf's face. Unfortunately for Brainy, he was a main target. If the Smurfs play pranks on one another, Brainy is often involved.\n\nIn \"The Talented Justa Smurf\", he is one of the Smurfs that Justa (who had just become \"Mimic Smurf\") imitates. He is visibly annoyed by his imitation while all of the Smurfs laugh. This is more proof that various Smurfs dislike his ramblings.\n\nIn the comic book \"King Smurf\", he is convinced that the Smurfs will elect him to replace Papa Smurf during his absence, but he ultimately receives only two votes, his own and Dopey's.\n\nThe main reason why the Smurfs dislike him is due to his endless chattering and his occasional use of abusing his role as Papa Smurf's assistant. In \"Brainy Gets Ghosted!\", he uses his authority to boss Painter and Chef around because there is an upcoming event that Papa Smurf is going to perform at. During his bossing around, he throws out all of Painter's paintings of Papa Smurf that \"do not look good\" to him and eats several of Chef's desserts, claiming that as Papa Smurf's assistant, he gets to \"taste test\" his meals. Both of these interactions are what directly lead to Painter and Chef attempting to prank him.\n\nPapa Smurf\n\nBeing Papa Smurf's assistant and apprentice, Brainy seems to always pester him and if the leader thinks of a plan, he will always say \"That's exactly what I was thinking!\". It isn't a secret that Brainy is such an admirer of Papa Smurf, always wanting to be like him in some way, and always defending Papa Smurf's wisdom even if it's only to gain some advantage over his fellow Smurfs. If Brainy Smurf is threatened or mistreated by a fellow Smurf, or if things don't go the way he wants them to, he'll usually spout, \"I'm going to tell this to Papa Smurf\". Even though Brainy is constantly hit in the head with a mallet or thrown out of the Village, Papa Smurf appears to be the Smurf that best knows how to put Brainy in his place. In the \"The Smurf's Apprentice\" episode, Papa declines Clumsy's offer to be his assistant, as Brainy is \"more than enough\". Brainy once referred to his own assistant role as \"self-appointed\" in \"Born Rotten\", implying Papa Smurf himself didn't assign him the job.\n\nTheir relationship becomes more strained by the end of the 1981 series (most notably the ninth season), with Papa Smurf often openly expressing any frustration he feels toward Brainy instead of trying to approach it with a patient or gentle attitude. That was usually Papa's best attempt to avoid yelling at Brainy, although his apprentice had pushed him to such a boiling point more than once before. In \"Cave Smurfs\", when Brainy tried to help Papa Smurf reassemble the time crystals by dropping one on top of the structure being assembled, causing it to collapse, Papa Smurf became so mad that he booted Brainy outside the cave, with him being inside his own book.\n\nClumsy Smurf\n\nDue to being a major nuisance towards the other Smurfs, Brainy doesn't seem to have an actual \"Best Smurf Friend\" in most iterations of the franchise. Though exclusively in the 1981 television series, his best friend, and the only Smurf who enjoyed Brainy's company, is Clumsy Smurf.\n\nAt first glance, it would seem that their friendship is only one sided, as Brainy sees Clumsy as an annoyance, but this is proven untrue in \"The Dark-Ness Monster\", where Brainy and Clumsy’s friendship is developed the most when Brainy can finally relate to Clumsy’s own experience in being, well, clumsy. Once he loses his glasses, Clumsy agrees to help him around the village and he tells Clumsy that he ‘actually trusts him with his life’ and that ‘being clumsy isn’t so bad, when he’s with him’, as well as writing him a very heartfelt quotation: 'It is easy to pretend we are strong. It is much harder to admit we are weak. A true friend, by loving every part of us, teaches us to love our weaknesses.' After reading, he allows Clumsy to keep the scroll, even offering him all of his quotations if he wanted them.\n\nThe two often seen (or are appointed to) watch(ing) Baby Smurf together and are together around the village more often than not. Overall, while Brainy does get frustrated with him, there are episodes where they get along perfectly fine, such as in \"Dreamy's Pen Pals\" and \"The Gingerbread Smurfs\". He even expresses great concern about Clumsy being missing in \"The Pussywillow Pixies\" and being hurt in \"The Chief Record Smurf\" (where he also says, \"Your best friend would never let you down!\").\n\nIn other iterations of the franchise, specifically the 2021 TV series, they do not seem to interact much, and when they do, it is not always positive; in \"The Smurfs Show\", he is among the Smurfs that call Brainy \"annoying\", and in \"Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb\", he threatens to break his glasses because Brainy (who had used a brain boosting spell which instead made him dumb) becomes Dimwitty's best friend. However, they are still on slightly better terms than most of the other Smurfs, as Brainy comforts Clumsy when he fears he will smell the forget-me-what flower in \"Forget Me What?\".\n\nHefty Smurf\n\nAnother Smurf seen often in Brainy's company is Hefty, most of the time to clobber him, but during the \"The Smurfs Of Order\" comic adventure Hefty became Brainy's deputy and the two shared a mutual understanding in upholding the law. Also, in another comic story \"A Smurfy Party\" when Gargamel was lured into the village and then doused with glue so he couldn't move, Hefty and Brainy did their normal roles, but with a difference.\n\nBrainy: (As Hefty is clobbering Gargamel's foot) No, no Hefty, you shouldn't do that. Remember what Papa Smurf always says: \"You shouldn't smurf an enemy when he's down!\"\n\nHefty: (Slamming away) You're right (Boom) I will (Boom) never (boom) do it (Boom) again!\n\nWild Smurf\n\nIn the 1980s cartoon show, Brainy often shows disdain for Wild and his animalistic habits, such as licking others. Despite Brainy's opinions, he proudly takes opportunities to 'educate' Wild, such as reading his own books to him after his back injury in \"Grandpa's Walking Stick\" or teaching him how to dance in the episode \"Dancing Bear\", albeit with little success.\n\nIn the comic adaption of \"Smurf On The Wild Side\", Brainy is very close with Wild for whom he has put himself forwards as a mentor figure, trying to teach him how to behave like a proper Smurf. To his credit, Brainy succeeds in teaching Wild Smurf to talk (somewhat) normally and when it becomes clear that Wild Smurf doesn't want to wear normal Smurf clothing, he doesn't press the issue. As a result, Brainy and Wild Smurf have a mutual understanding and respect for each other.\n\nIn the 2021 TV series, Wild speaks in Smurf language, implying that Brainy tutored him like the comics. They are not as close to each other as in the comics, though they can be considered friends. However, like every other Smurf, Brainy annoys Wild at times, to the point of kicking him away in \"Back To Nature\".\n\nSmurfette\n\nBrainy is considered friends with Smurfette. They are often seen together, teaming up regularly in episodes such as \"Mind The Cat\".\n\nUnlike other Smurfs, Brainy does not always want Smurfette in a romantic way. Brainy often doesn't appear in episodes in which Smurfette wants one of the Smurfs to be her escort to parties, such as \"Prince Smurf\". However, Smurfette is often annoyed with his talking, though the only thing Smurfette hates about Brainy more than his endless speaking and egoism is when all the other Smurfs are mean to him. This goes to show Smurfette is one of the few Smurfs who likes him more no matter how much talking he does.\n\nSmurfblossom\n\nIn the 2021 cartoon series, Brainy is often seen with Blossom. He is sometimes annoyed by her overly long talking. Blossom, likewise, shows annoyance when Brainy claims girls are always getting into trouble in \"Mirror, Mirror On The Armoire\" and fears if Brainy will read the encyclopedia to her if he finds out she misplaced his smurfway. However, the two are still seen as friends. In \"Where's My Smurfway?\", Blossom repairs it and Brainy kisses her as a thank-you.\n\nUnlike with Smurfette, Storm, or any of the other girls, Brainy seems to display a more protective nature towards Blossom. Though he is still his usual cowardly self when facing danger, he surprisingly does show a braver side of himself and seems to prioritize her safety, as seen in \"The Pluffs!\".\n\nBlossom is the only Smurf that Brainy seems to trust that is able to use the smurfway, as he lets her ride it in \"Relaxosmurf\" in exchange for a blueberry pie.\n\nOther Smurfs\n\nOften in the comics, Brainy could be heard off-panel typically yammering didactically, and one Smurf would get visibly annoyed at him and walk to him off-panel. Then a loud *PAF!* could be heard.\n\nIn the movie \"The Smurfs And The Magic Flute\", following more closely to the comic book portrayals of Brainy, he usually gets clobbered in the head by a hammer when he gets too annoying to bear. This is funny because in the original comic book story that the movie is based on, he doesn't even appear at all.\n\nAlso, in the comics during the Annual Imitate festival, Brainy for once gets to be the one who does the clobbering, when he takes the role of Hefty and Poet takes the role as Brainy, the scene shows Brainy trying to lift Hefty's halter and Poet lecturing Brainy and ends with Brainy chasing Poet with a hammer trying to clobber him.\n\nBut deep down, some of the other Smurfs love him and would be horrified if something bad happened to him. In \"Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb\", when Brainy used a brain-boosting machine, the machine instead makes him stupid. Papa Smurf and Smurfette try to help him turn back into his real smart self.\n\nHe Saved Them Once\n\nIn \"Papa's Family Album\", Papa Smurf explains to the Smurflings about how things were like back when all the Smurfs (excluding Smurfette and Wild) were Smurflings.\n\nApparently, Brainy was practically blind until Papa Smurf gave him glasses. It was when he got his glasses that he started being the Brainy Smurf we all know and (sort of) love. Once Brainy lost his glasses and Clumsy had to help him until he could get some new ones.\n\nThe Smurfs have a lot to thank Brainy for, actually, as it was him who saved their lives. One time, gargoyles under the command of the evil wizard Hotap came and snatched all the Smurflings and separated them from Papa Smurf. Brainy was able to escape before he was put into a machine with the others. The machine was supposed to turn them into gold.\n\nBrainy was able to buy Papa Smurf some time by stuffing a book into the gears, jamming the machine and preventing the Smurflings from dying.\n\nIn Other TV Shows\n\nCartoon All-Stars To The Rescue\n\nBrainy appears in the cartoon show crossover \"Cartoon All-Stars To The Rescue\" as one of the Smurfs who helps wake up Michael's sister Corey to the fact that her piggy bank was stolen.\n\nIn the Movies\n\nThe Smurfs\n\nIn the 2011 Smurfs movie, Brainy is one of the few Smurfs who travel through time to modern-day New York City. Although he still remains somewhat annoying (though not to the extent that he does in both the comic books and the cartoon show), he does become helpful near the end of the movie when he works on the spell to cause the full moon to appear blue so that the time portal can be reopened. After reopening the portal, Brainy got the rest of the Smurfs to join him in New York to defeat Gargamel. He along with Gutsy, Grouchy, and Clumsy play along with Patrick Winslow on Guitar Hero and raps with Gutsy and Grouchy on the song \"Walk This Way\". After their return to the village, Brainy forms his own band called the Brainiacs, which ironically is one of the few times that he has ever been really popular with his fellow Smurfs.\n\nThe Smurfs: A Christmas Carol\n\nIn the animated feature \"The Smurfs: A Christmas Carol\", Brainy plays the role as the Smurf of Christmas Present, showing Grouchy what current effects his refusal to participate in the celebration of Christmas would have on his fellow Smurfs. Brainy noticeably displays a rather analytical approach to describing a problem not normally found with his character in any other interpretation.\n\nThe Smurfs 2\n\nBrainy Smurf has a brief appearance in the early and late parts of The Smurfs 2 and was one of the three originally chosen by Papa Smurf to journey to modern-day Paris in order to rescue Smurfette from Gargamel (the other two were Hefty and Gutsy) but was accidentally left out as the smurfportation crystals used for traveling through time were instead ingested by Clumsy, Grouchy, and Vanity. Brainy disliked hearing Passive Aggressive's comment to Papa Smurf about him being chosen as one of the three travelers, saying that it wasn't a compliment.\n\nThe Smurfs: The Legend Of Smurfy Hollow\n\nIn the animated feature The Smurfs: The Legend Of Smurfy Hollow, Brainy is the many-times winner of the Smurfberry Hunt, which makes Gutsy jealous and desiring to figure out how he manages to win every year. By following Brainy across the wooden bridge to Smurfy Hollow, Gutsy discovers that Brainy has found a secret patch of smurfberries that he gets his smurfberries from. By making a Headless Horseman figure to cast a shadow with and by using his empty bucket to amplify his voice, Gutsy scared Brainy out of the smurfberry patch so he could collect enough to win that year's Smurfberry Hunt. However, Brainy in his flight ends up captured in one of Gargamel's traps, and with the other Smurfs now wondering why Brainy hasn't shown up at the conclusion of the contest, Gutsy and Smurfette set off into Smurfy Hollow to find Brainy, only to also be captured in traps set up by Gargamel. By working together, Brainy has Gutsy swing his cage into his own until they both broke apart, causing them to fall to the ground. When Gargamel came to see that Smurfette was captured in one of his traps, Brainy and Gutsy also worked together to get her safely out and away from the evil wizard. But just as Gargamel has the three of them cornered, the Headless Horseman shows up and chases after them, sending them toward the covered bridge which Brainy says the horseman cannot cross through. After safely escaping both the horseman and Gargamel, Brainy apologized to Gutsy for keeping the smurfberries all to himself and offered to give up the Smurfberry Hunt award to Gutsy, who in turn insisted that Brainy should have it, and they ended up fighting over who should get the award when it slipped out of their hands and landed around Lazy's neck, therefore declaring him to be the winner.\n\nSmurfs: The Lost Village\n\nBrainy has a main character appearance in Smurfs: The Lost Village, going with Smurfette, Hefty, and Clumsy to find a lost village of Smurfs in the Forbidden Forest. It's also revealed he used to be a \"Smurf Scout\" and has a ladybug assistant named Snappy who makes audio and visual recordings to assist Brainy. After being jokingly addressed as \"Nerdy Smurf\" during Papa Smurf's opening narration, he appears having Hefty serve as a test subject for his Smurfy Thing Finder. After the device is burned out by Smurfette, which Brainy attributes to her unnatural origins-a comment that he only realizes could be offensive as he's saying it-he goes with her, Hefty, and Clumsy on a smurfboarding excursion. Brainy's engine on his board fails catastrophically, while Smurfette's parachute carries her far from Smurf Village where she encounters a mysterious new Smurf before being captured by Gargamel's vulture Monty.\n\nAfter rescuing Smurfette and learning of the existence of another Smurf village, Brainy and his friends approach Papa Smurf but are rebuked for leaving the village and grounded. To her friends' surprise, Smurfette accepts the punishment without argument, but Brainy and the others quickly deduce that she intends to head out regardless of Papa's disapproval and follow her. Making their way into the Forbidden Forest, the group encounter a number of strange plants and creatures, including a species that Brainy dubs \"Dragonflies\" at Snappy's suggestion. The group are then attacked by Gargamel and his pets and driven into a tunnel network, which Brainy attempts to help his friends escape through calm rationale only to be all but ignored. After befriending a rabbit named Bucky the group arrives at a magical river, and thanks to Brainy's experience they are able to build a raft.\n\nThe group then encounters Gargamel on the river, and after his craft sinks Hefty and Smurfette startle Brainy by insisting on going back to help him; they do so only for the group to be knocked from their raft and sent over a waterfall. This and the disintegration of his Smurf Scout manual-which Hefty had thrown on their campfire the night before-prompts Brainy to angrily accost Hefty, and he soon includes Smurfette in his wrath as well. However, the trio and Clumsy are then captured by a group of masked Smurfs who are revealed to in fact be natural Smurf Girls, a fact that astonishes Brainy almost as much as the female Smurfs are intrigued by their male counterparts. The four are then taken to Smurfy Grove and introduced to Smurfwillow, the community's leader, who informs them that Gargamel is one the wrong track to finding their village. She clarifies that a landmark revealed by his magic was misinterpreted as a group of three trees rather than the trio of waterfalls that mark the actual location of the village.\n\nWhile Clumsy is taken off by the suspicious Smurfstorm to check on Gargamel, Brainy and the others are welcomed to Smurfy Grove; not forgetting their heated words, he and Hefty proceed to sabotage each other on multiple occasions in front of the Smurf Girls. However, after sampling the many activities in the village, culminating in a visit to the spa, the pair apologize to each other and make up, but are then stunned when Smurfette shows little interest in returning to Smurf Village with them. Stormy and Clumsy then return, with Stormy confronting Smurfette over her origins; the Smurf Girls then ambush Papa Smurf when he arrives in search of his four missing Smurfs. Unfortunately, Gargamel finds the village and uses his recently invented Freeze Balls to capture all of the natural Smurfs, leaving Smurfette behind as he takes them prisoner to his castle.\n\nAn escape attempt by the Smurfs is thwarted, though Brainy and Hefty manage to remain free and escape his notice, and later assist Smurfette in defeating Gargamel using the magic she displayed during the Smurfy Thing Finder test. Smurfette is reverted to clay form as a result, and Brainy is forced to halt a frantic Papa Smurf as he searches desperately through Gargamel's spell book for a means of restoring her. All the Smurfs and Smurf Girls then gather in Smurf Village to mourn their lost friend, and initially fail to notice magic unleashed by their grief reviving her. Upon hearing both Clumsy and Hefty realizing that Smurfette has been restored, Brainy is convinced that they've been overcome with their sorrow but opens his own eyes to see the truth. All the Smurfs then join in a grand celebration of Smurfette's return, their victory over Gargamel, and their newfound unity.\n\nSmurf Videogames\n\nThe Smurfs (1994 video game)\n\nBrainy appears in one of the levels in the 16-bit versions of the 1994 Smurfs video game as a playable character.\n\nThe Smurfs: Mission Vileaf\n\nBrainy appears in one of the levels of The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf as a playable character. He takes up the Smurfizer and sets out to recover the Agua Magnifica, the first of these ingredients. He rescues Jokey and Handy from Viletraps along the way, before arriving in Wild Smurf’s territory. He then traverses Wild’s incomplete ropes course to locate the Agua Magnifica, which to his disappointment is only water from a particular waterfall. Brainy returns to Smurf Village but must then set out again to rescue Dimwitty from a Viletrap before it can alert Gargamel to the village’s location.\n\nSmurfs Kart\n\nBrainy is not a playable character in Smurfs Kart. However, he is seen on the loading screens.\n\nThe Smurfs 2: The Prisoner of the Green Stone\n\nBrainy acts as one of the main characters of the game and is one of the four playable characters in it. He follows Handy and Storm on their quest to get the Green Stone to lecture them about breaking the rules. He finds himself also joined by Dimwitty.\n\nBrainy, taking charge of the SmurfoMix, volunteers to seek out Stolas with this proposal. Making his way through another portal to the Boiling Baths where he is forced to contend with a massive CrystoToad. Brainy also overhears Stolas commanding the CrystoBeasts to collect magical essence, apparently part of his plan to escape the stone forever. As he continues, Brainy stumbles across an extension of Wild's obstacle course.\n\nBrainy discovers that Smurf Paradise has been destroyed. The local volcano, previously dormant, has apparently become active and covered the resort in lava. Finding Stolas, the creature explains that he wants to get out of the Green Stone. However,having lost all trust in other beings, Stolas battles Brainy before fleeing through yet another portal. Unable to reach his friends, Brainy follows and comes across ruins he soon concludes were built by the alchemists. With the structures collapsing and lava levels rising, Brainy races through the wilds. Along the way, he grows increasingly concerned as the other Smurfs fail to respond to his calls.\n\nUpon passing through a portal back to the hovel, Brainy discovers the cause of his friends’ radio silence. After confronting Brainy, Stolas returned there and commenced a ritual intended to secure his freedom. The hovel has thus been transformed into a mass of wreckage floating in the Astral Nothingness. Later, Handy takes it upon himself to fight Stolas, before gaining his trust and defeats Gargamel. Later, he and the other Smurfs celebrate a party with Stolas.\n\nAppearances\n\nSee Brainy Smurf/Appearances.\n\nTrivia\n\nDanny Goldman reprised the role of Brainy Smurf for some adult-level \"non-canonical\" Smurf segments on Robot Chicken.\n\nBefore Grandpa Smurf, Nanny Smurf, Therapist, and the \"non-canonical\" Narrator appeared, Brainy was the only Smurf who needed glasses.\n\nBrainy's glasses were originally exclusive to the 1961 Smurfs cartoon show prior to the album release of \"The Black Smurfs\".\n\nIn the 1980s cartoon show, Brainy has a habit of saying somebody's name three times.\n\nDespite Brainy being a very common character in the show, he is one of the least liked Smurfs, basically the Butt Monkey of the village.\n\nBrainy, along with Papa Smurf and Hefty, appeared in the 1990 drug prevention TV video, \"Cartoon All-Stars To The Rescue\".\n\nThe 1981 TV series is the only piece of media where he is best friends with Clumsy. In other iterations of the franchise, they don't interact often.\n\nBrainy's hair color is red, as indicated by the incredibly long beard he had grown from using a magical hair tonic in \"Symbols Of Wisdom\".\n\nThe times when Brainy isn't an annoying pest and when the other Smurfs actually enjoy his company are mostly during smurfball games or when they're swimming.\n\nDespite being so arrogant and self-centered, Brainy always wants and seeks to be respected by the other Smurfs. He would go so far as to use magic to make himself strong to take back their food from Bigmouth, and also risking his life to save a wildcat to prove that he lives up to his word, only to lose consciousness after that.\n\nIn the 2011 movie, Brainy is depicted with freckles.\n\nBrainy was voiced by Fred Armesin, known for being on Saturday Night Live, in the live-action film and was voiced by Danny Pudi, known for being on Community, in The Lost Village.\n\nBrainy's glasses are seldom seen with lenses.\n\nThe glass on Brainy's glasses is made from the magic sand of the Sandman.\n\nIn \"Smurf To The Future!\", it is revealed that Brainy's prehistoric self did not have glasses, as this is before glasses were created.\n\nBrainy gets seasick easily.\n\nBrainy plays detective four times: \"The Masked Pie Smurfer\", \"They're Smurfing Our Song\", \"The Village Vandal\", and \"Gargamel's Quest\". In the last two episodes mentioned, he refers to himself as Sherlock Smurf.\n\nIn the 1980s cartoon, at least, although the Smurfs get really annoyed by Brainy and always booting him out of the village, they still seem to care about him. Examples such as in \"Smurfette's Sweet Tooth\" when Brainy was turned into a candy statue, the Smurfs seemed concerned. Also, in \"Essence Of Brainy\", they ended up not liking the 'nicer, less annoying' Brainy, and they worked to get the old Brainy back. They love him, though that doesn't mean they don’t find him annoying.\n\nThe only Season 1 episodes of the 2021 series not to feature Brainy are \"Unsmurfable Smile\", \"Smurf Your Seat Belts!\", \"Funny Mommy\", \"Storm Loses Her Mojo\", and \"Smurfy Mother's Day!\".\n\nThe only Season 2 episodes of the 2021 series not to feature Brainy are \"Mommy's Masterpiece\", \"Blossom Goes Wild!\", \"Smurfy Magic Duel\", \"Baby Sensei\", \"Gargamel Goes Gaga\", \"Wild Gets Tamed\", \"The Sarsaparillo Run\", and \"Gargamel, Queen Of The Prom\".\n\nBrainy is alongside Papa Smurf and Greedy as the only character to appear in every 1980s Season 1 episode.\n\nHe also appears in almost every 1980s Season 2 episode, he's missing only in \"The Impostor King\".\n\nIn the original French version of the comics, Brainy's name translates into \"Smurf with Glasses\". At the time, this name was more appropriate than his English name, as his \"intelligence\" was mostly in his mind and he was not really smart.\n\nIn Smurfs: The Lost Village, Brainy and Hefty get along better than in most source material.\n\nBrainy was Gargamel's first victim as seen in \"Gargamel's Time Trip\".\n\nIn the 1981 series, Brainy started off as a bookworm. It wasn't until Season 3 that Brainy started publishing his ego-tripping books.\n\nHe is one of the Smurfs who were featured in the National Benzole animated commercial series, where he is often seen with a book that is titled \"Rhymes\". It also seems as if he was treated just like how he was treated by the other Smurfs in the entire franchise, which is in the first and second commercial, when he inflated a tire, he was blown away and laughed at by the other Smurfs, and in the third commercial, when he sang his part of the song \"...or elves!\", he is immediately pulled away, and his head is covered by his hat when a Smurf who was standing on him slipped accidentally. His glasses are also red instead of dark colored.\n\nHe was also one of the Smurfs (alongside Chef) who were featured in the Benco animated commercial. His pants and hat are also yellow instead of white.\n\nBrainy is the only Smurf to be crowned King more than once during the original cartoon series: he was King Smurf in the Season 1 episode by the same name, and he was later made King of the Trokels during \"Long Live Brainy\" under false pretenses (unbeknownst to him). In both instances, he demonstrated a decent understanding of human-based culture and applied this knowledge during both reigns. Unfortunately, his hubris led him to be more tyrannical than beloved as a ruler, so he was denounced of his kingship by the end of both episodes.\n\nHe, Papa, Grandpa, Baby, Smurfette, Clumsy, Hefty, Handy, Greedy, Grouchy, Lazy, Vanity, Jokey, Painter, Wild, Sassette, Snappy, and Smoogle are the only characters who timed travel during Season 9 with the Time Scrolls.\n\nIn Italian dub of the 1980's cartoon, Brainy is usually to ending always his phrases saying \"Che è meglio\" (literally \"... that it's better\" or \"that would be better\") when he gives some advice to the other Smurfs.\n\nHe, Papa Smurf, Hefty, Grouchy, and Lazy are the only characters to be in every incarnation of the franchise.\n\nBrainy has his name in six episode titles which are \"Brainy Smurf, Friend To All The Animals\", \"Brainy's Smarty Party\", \"Essence Of Brainy\", \"I Was A Brainy Weresmurf\", \"Long Live Brainy\", and \"Brainy's Beastly Boo-Boo\".\n\nBrainy has his name in two episode titles of the 2021 series which is \"Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb\" and \"Brainy Gets Ghosted!\"."
