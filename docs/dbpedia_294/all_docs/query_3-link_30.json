        "text": "When might I be prescribed benzodiazepines?\n\nBenzodiazepines may be prescribed to treat severe anxiety or severe insomnia, when either is having a significant impact on your daily life. In some cases, doctors may prescribe the benzodiazepine clonazepam to treat panic disorder.\n\nThere are some situations when benzodiazepines may not be the most effective treatment. For example, if you are experiencing bereavement, these drugs may numb your emotions and stop you grieving properly.\n\nBut you may also be unable to sleep because of grief and anxiety. In this case, taking these drugs for a short time may help you relax and start to recover.\n\nOur page on what you may need to know before taking medication has a list of things to ask your doctor before you begin taking any medication. This can help you to decide whether benzodiazepines are right for you.\n\nHow often to take benzodiazepines\n\nMost benzodiazepines are likely to be more effective if you take them as a one-off dose. They can also be effective as a short-term treatment for a few weeks. Doctors will usually advise that you should:\n\navoid taking them every day\n\ntake them for no longer than four weeks.\n\nThese drugs are less likely to keep working if you take them continuously for more than a few weeks. This is because your brain can get used to their effects. It can also mean that when you stop taking the drugs, your brain becomes very sensitive to natural brain chemicals.\n\nIn some cases, doctors may prescribe certain benzodiazepines at low doses for longer periods. This does not always cause problems, and it could be the best treatment for some people.\n\nWho should avoid taking benzodiazepines?\n\nYour doctor will not normally prescribe you benzodiazepines if you have:\n\nsevere lung disease or breathing problems\n\nsleep apnoea (breathing problems during sleep)\n\nsevere liver or kidney disease\n\nsevere and uncontrolled myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular condition).\n\nYour doctor may be cautious about offering you benzodiazepines if you have:\n\nchest and lung problems\n\nmuscle weakness, such as myasthenia gravis\n\na history of alcohol or drug abuse\n\na diagnosis of personality disorder.\n\nYour doctor should prescribe a reduced dose of benzodiazepines if you have:\n\nliver or kidney problems\n\nporphyria (a rare, inherited illness)\n\nWhether you are prescribed benzodiazepines may also depend on your age:\n\nBenzodiazepines are not suitable for children. This is except for rare cases of anxiety or insomnia caused by fear or sleepwalking, when diazepam may be prescribed.\n\nOlder people should be given a lower dose than the standard adult dose.\n\nIf you have any medical conditions or are receiving any other treatments, let your doctor know. This includes any conditions which aren’t listed here.\n\nThey can help you decide whether or not it is safe for you to take this medication.\n\nBenzodiazepines during pregnancy and breastfeeding\n\nThere is not enough research to know exactly how common problems are with taking benzodiazepines while you are pregnant. Some people have reported the following problems with their baby after taking benzodiazepines during pregnancy:\n\ncleft palate\n\nurinary tract abnormalities\n\nheart abnormalities\n\nstomach abnormalities\n\ndyslexia (difficulty reading and writing)\n\ndyspraxia (problems with co-ordination and movement)\n\nautism\n\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nSome people have also reported the following problems in their baby after taking benzodiazepines towards the end of their pregnancy:\n\ndrowsiness\n\nfloppy muscles\n\nbreathing problems\n\nlow body temperature\n\nwithdrawal symptoms including abnormal sleeping patterns, high-pitched crying, tremor (shaking), vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nIf you take certain benzodiazepines while breastfeeding, the medication may be present in your breast milk. In some cases, this can build up in your baby’s body and cause side effects.\n\nIf you are breastfeeding, pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you can ask your doctor about the risks of taking your specific medication.\n\nTaking benzodiazepines with other medication\n\nCombining benzodiazepines with other medications can change the effects of the drugs. This may include reducing the positive effects of either drugs. Or it may lead to negative side effects.\n\nSometimes doctors may prescribe you benzodiazepines at the same time as other drugs. For example, they may prescribe benzodiazepines with antidepressants or antipsychotics.\n\nThe benzodiazepines may be to help you cope with anxiety while you wait for the other medication to begin working. But there may also be negative effects from this, if the drugs interact in a way that causes unwanted side effects.\n\nYou can find out about known medication interactions for individual benzodiazepines from the British National Formulary (BNF) A-Z list of drug interactions.\n\nYou can also speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you are concerned about taking any other medication with benzodiazepines. This includes prescribed medication, over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies.\n\nThis information was published in April 2021.
