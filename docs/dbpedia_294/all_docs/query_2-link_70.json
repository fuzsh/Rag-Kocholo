However both those things are present and hopefully correct - and many thanks to \"A Reader\" who donated the scan of the reverse of Duke \"Musical Instruments\" to save me fettling the terrible one I had before. Guess it will stay now",

        "text": "Topps [trade/commercial - cards and stickers] \"Match Attax\" (2010-11) card 465 /485\n\nso here was your first clue to this weeks them, the referee, and what do referees all have? A whistle. But our clue referred to the fact that whistling only needs a mouth to do, not any kind of special equipment. And it matters not how well you whistle, because if you are in company someone else will certainly join in and attempt to harmonise.\n\nThis set was a base set of 485 cards but there were also limited edition special cards - club badges and autographs, as well as the fact that different players appeared on the packets. A full list of everything that was included in the entire range appears at the Football Cartophilic Info Exchange / Match Attax 2010\n\nNow something I have been told by a reader, already - and many thanks - is that these Match Attax cards started with the 2007-2008 season, and that they were a cross between trading cards and playing cards, that is why there are the points on each card.\n\nTopps lost the UK rights to feature Premier League players for the 2019-2020 season, and Match Attax disappeared. However these rights were picked up by Panini, and they started producing their Adrenalyn XL cards.\n\nTopps did not give up issuing cards though, because they managed to negotiate the UK rights to the UEFA Champions and Europa Leagues.\n\nW.A. & A.C. Churchman [tobacco : UK] \"Nature`s Architects\" (October 1930) /25 - C504-600 : C82-69 : C/103 (RB.10/103)and\n\nTime for clue number two, and that was what bees do, when they fly, which is hum. And humming is another simple noise for anyone to produce, using, once again, just their mouth. Actually the bee does not make the humming noise with their mouth, but with their wings, which vibrate fast enough to disrupt the air and create sound waves.\n\nThis set is first recorded in our original Churchman reference book (RB.10), published in 1948, and listed as\n\n103. October 1930. 25 NATURE`S ARCHITECTS. (titled series) Size 2 11/10\" x 1 7/16\" or 67 x 38 m/m. Numbered 1-25. Fronts printed by letterpress, 4-colour half tone process. Backs in dark green, with descriptions. Printed by Mardon, Son & Hall.\n\nNow if you are not careful, you will close the book and wallk away, but wait. Because directly below it, there is this :\n\n104. May 1930. 12 NATURE`S ARCHITECTS. Similar format to (103) but size 3 5/16\" x 2 9/10\" or 80 x 62 m/m\n\nNow my first thought was to wonder which twelve were selected, but this was not the case, and if you look back at the dates you will see that the set of twelve large cards were issued first, five months earlier.\n\nOur World Tobacco Issues Indexes list the sets, but without listing the months, as simply :\n\nNATURE`S ARCHITECTS. Nd.\n\n(A) small (25)\n\n(B) large (12)\n\nCarreras Ltd [tobacco : UK] \"Birds of the Countryside\" (March 1939) /50 - C151-205 : C18-34\n\nNow our last clue, which showed the nightingale, the bird with the most beautiful song. But again it, and us, only need our bodies to produce the notes and then string them together, and then we are singing.\n\nThis is a very pretty little set dealing with our feathered friends in their natural settings. However it is quite hard to find any information about it, and the original New Issues Report must be in a magazine I do not yet have - though there is a checklist of all the cards at The Trading Card Database / Carreras BOTC\n\nOur World Tobacco Issues Indexes both describe it very simply indeed as\n\nBIRDS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE. Sm. Nd. (50)\n\nRowntree & Co. Ltd [trade : chocolate : UK] \"The Old And The New\" (1934) ROW-180 : RPW-3\n\nThis follows on from the birdsong of yesterday, because I imagine our prehistoric forbears hearing a bird and trying to copy its tunefulness. I will gloss over the fact that pterodactyls only ever said \"caw caw\" and move swiftly on to remind you that imitation is in our nature, who amongst us has not heard a bird late at night and tried to whistle back?\n\nSinging is the most natural of all the ways for a human being to make music, and just like the birds it provides a signal that we are in the area, or were there first. It attracts a mate, or, even better, a friend. The minstrels on this card did eventually make themselves instruments, or get someone else to do so, but they started, like our week, with a whistle and a hum and then giving words to a song.\n\nNow this is a set I have not encountered before, which is always fun, and it also comes in several variations, so you can definitely expect to see more of it, and other cards of the series, in the future. Its first appearance I have found is in our original British Trade Index part 1, and it says :\n\nTHE OLD AND THE NEW. Sml. 76 x 36 with coupon, 67 x 36 without.\n\nA) No`s 1/25, panel at base of back inscribed \"Rowntree`s Elect Chocolate\" only.\n\nB) No`s 1/50, same panel at base of back, words \"Rowntree`s Elect Chocolate\" reset in smaller lettering with further line added, e.g. \"Delicious & Sustaining...\" Vari-backed, five wordings.\n\nHowever book two of the British Trade Index kind of turns this on its head, with\n\nTHE OLD AND THE NEW.\n\nA) 1st Edition 1/25, coupons are found inscribed on left a) 3d. series - b) 6d. series.\n\nB) 2nd Edition. Delete 1/50 and substitute 1/48. Text varies from A) at 4, 10, 11, 13, 18 and 22. Coupon inscribed \"3d. series\". Backs listed in N&N Vol.14, page 12.\n\nSo does anyone know whether those text variations are in the descriptive text and if so what they are ? And does anyone have N&N Vol.14, page 12 ? For this is not the Cartophilic Notes and News, in which the pages, at that time, just carried on one after the other, so has to be the Cameric Notes and News, of which I do not have volume 14.\n\nNow on our modern British Trade Index, reduced to a single volume and a handbook, the text is again slightly altered to read\n\nTHE OLD AND THE NEW 76 x 36 with coupon 67 x 36 without. Nd. Text varies in the two issues at no`s 4, 10, 11, 13, 18 and 22. Coupons found with a) 3d. series b) 6d. series on front.\n\n1. No`s 1/25, base of back panel with \"Rowntree`s Elect Chocolate\". In this issue, the vouchers have differently worded backs, see HR-40.1\n\n2. No`s 1/48, back panel \"Rowntree`s Elect Chocolate\" as above, in smaller lettering, with further line added. 5 wordings known. Vari-backed. See HR-40.2. In this issue the only wording on the back of the voucher is \"Keep this Voucher - It is of Value\".\n\nSo what was the voucher for? And does anyone have our card with the voucher still there?\n\nBy the way, the HR handbook references list the coupon backs and card backs. HR.40-1 refers to the coupon backs (10) series of 48, which start with either :\n\n1. Athletes appreciate the sustaining ...\n\n2. Bananas are sustaining, but a 3d. packet ...\n\n3. Elect Chocolate is a delicious sweet ...\n\n4. Elect Chocolate is free from excessive ...\n\n5. \"Elect\" is the up-to-date chocolate ...\n\n6. The food value of a 3d. packet of Elect ...\n\n7. A 6d. packet of Elect Chocolate has the ...\n\n8. A 6d. packet of Elect Chocolate is a meal ...\n\n9. A 3d. packet of Elect Chocolate\n\n10. You should never be without Elect ...\n\nThe card backs, in the series of 25, are :\n\n1. As smooth as velvet\n\n2. Delicious & sustaining\n\n3. Has a delicious flavour\n\n4. Is of the finest quality\n\n5. The pocket lunch\n\nWe have included this information, and the hashtag #Rowntrees in order to involve other collectors who are not cartophilists, those who collect ephemera, and food memorabilia, specifically chocolate. For it is in those \"hidden\" collections that cards we have no knowledge of may lie sleeping.... waiting to be recorded.\n\nThe Cartophilic Society of Great Britain Ltd [trade : collecting society : UK] \"1935-1985 - 50 Years of Cartophily\" (28 September 1985) 1/1 - CCM-1\n\nThat was a surprise, wasn`t it? You expected the Wills` \"Star and Circle Back\". But more about that later\n\nLets start with the reason why we have a drummer, which may not seem to fit our theme of natural music, but, in case you did not know, when you make a rhythmic tapping sound with your fingers on a table or similar surface you are said to \"drum\" your fingers. By the way it makes a different noise depending on the length of your fingernails, short nails make a muffled noise, whilst long nails make a louder sound, and have the ability to scrape and swoosh for added emphasis at certain points. And if you want to grow your nails, such rhythmic tapping is supposed to encourage the nail bed to put forth more effort and strength. But I sadly do not know whether they named the drum after the action, or the action after the drum.\n\nNow I think that this card is in contention for the longest top line details ever, but maybe also the most fun, because, yes, we, or more correctly, our London Branch produced this card. And now I also get to add it to the London Branch home page, and link back to here. If you still have your own card, presented in 1985, well done. I bought this one, on eBay, which must mean it was a bargain, but, if you were the seller, see, I kept it safely, and still treasure it.\n\nNow you may not know this but quite a few of our Branches and clubs produced single cards, or sets, for special events. I know of a few, but not all. However some, like this one, are listed in the British Trade Index, which is where, in part 3, this CCM-1 code comes from. So one day when I have nothing to do, or, more likely, am trying to find something to occupy my broken heart, I will work through and get at least the titles uploaded.\n\nThe write up in there for this card is :\n\nThe Cartophilic Society of Great Britain Ltd. Publishers of this volume. Cards issued in the 1980s.\n\n\"1935-1985 - 50 Years of Cartophily\" 68 x 36. Reproduction of subject \"England - Drummer, Coldstream Guards\" from Wills set W/13. Presented to members present at Golden Jubilee meeting of London Branch on 28th September 1985\".\n\nNow two things need to be mentioned at this point. The first is the identity of W/13, which is \"Soldiers of the World\", and the second is that if anyone out there has this card from that original set, and could scan front and back we would be most happy to add it in as a comparison, because there are differences, most notably the \"Wills Cigarettes\" on the original bottom line, which is not present here.\n\nThe following two scans come from our Cartophilic Notes and News magazine\n\nThis one came first, in Volume 13, No.133, September/October 1985, and it simply shows the reverse of the card in black and white - though in 1985 colour was a scarcity in our magazine - plus a line of type, which for some reason was sideways, rather than beneath.\n\nThere was another one in the next edition, Volume 13, No.134, November/December 1985, but it is rather unwieldy at the moment so I might fettle with it and see if it cannot be altered so that all the text is on the left and the card, reduced, on the right. Stick with me on that one.\n\nMillhoff [tobacco : UK] \"Real Photographs\" M699-310 : M108-22.1 : RB.113/7\n\nNow this may seem to have nothing to do with music but stick with me, because the oldest musical instrument ever found in the entire world is a flute made from a bone just like this. And this story gets even odder, because if you look at a list of the eight oldest musical instruments in the world, five of them are flutes, made from mammoth, or bear, or even swan and vulture bones, from France, Germany, Eastern Europe, and even China.\n\nHowever all of these have holes in them, which I believe must be a later development, the first attempts surely being just blowing through a hollow bone they picked up in the field or at the back of the cave, and then, perhaps, finding a broken and holed one that made a different noise, which led them to experiment with manufacturing these holes in other bones. And that means that the un-holed bones, the true earliest musical instruments have been lost to time, mistaken for just bones on the floor, discarded.\n\nThis card is one of a lengthy set which eventually covered six series each of twenty-seven cards. In addition, our set, the first set, could be collected in (a) matt format, or (b) glossy format.\n\nDuke [tobacco : O/S ; USA] \"Musical Instruments of the World\" (1890)\n\nNow this started off as a bit of a disaster, mainly the back, which was damaged, something I did not immediately notice. But \"A Reader\", all the way from America, came to my rescue and supplied this super and unblemished reverse.\n\nI have a bit of a soft spot for Duke, or less informally, W. Duke and Sons of Durham, in North Carolina. They were not the first cigarette manufacturer in the World, but, as they so proudly say on this card, they became the largest - and I am sure that this was influenced a great deal by their super cards, which were always so well drawn.\n\nW Duke was a person, not a brand, and his first name was Washington. He was born on December 18th 1820 and he was in the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War, which was not an easy life.\n\nThis set is backlisted in alphabetical order - and backlisted just means that all the cards in the set are listed on every card, which is a great incentive to \"collect them all\" and also to instantly see not only what you are missing, but also almost certainly at least one unfamiliar name to provide a little frisson of shuddering excitement.\n\nActually this set has a lot of that, for the musical instruments are being delicately handled by attractive ladies, and, for the military instruments, they are wearing military attire. However it is all being done in the best possible taste, these are cards that you could allow anyone to look at without a qualm. And there are also \"off camera\" suggestions to excite you still more - look at \"the Bugle\" and you will see that in the free hand there is unmistakeably reins, so this lady is on horseback. Look closer and she is also on a saddle, astride, just like a man - in other ways too, for the saddle would not show in this way if she were wearing a dress, it would have had to ruck up and be bundled at the front of the pommel, making the saddle way less visible. This can only mean she is wearing trousers.\n\nIf you would like to see the entire set, it is wonderfully displayed at Interlude/DukeInstruments And there is something really wonderful that we also need to tell you about the very cards they use, for they fully admit that these cards are from the collection of the The Metropolitan Museum of Art - where they form part of The Jefferson R. Burdick Collection."
