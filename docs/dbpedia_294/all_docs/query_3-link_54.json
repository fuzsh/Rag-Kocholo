World Health Organization Geneva, 2000 The International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), established in 1980, is a joint venture of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the World Health Organization (WHO). The overall objectives of the IPCS are to establish the scientific basis for assessment of the risk to human health and the environment from exposure to chemicals, through international peer review processes, as a prerequisite for the promotion of chemical safety, and to provide technical assistance in strengthening national capacities for the sound management of chemicals. The Inter-Organization Programme for the Sound Management of Chemicals (IOMC) was established in 1995 by UNEP, ILO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, WHO, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Participating Organizations), following recommendations made by the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development to strengthen cooperation and increase coordination in the field of chemical safety. The purpose of the IOMC is to promote coordination of the policies and activities pursued by the Participating Organizations, jointly or separately, to achieve the sound management of chemicals in relation to human health and the environment.

PREVIOUS EVALUATIONS BY INTERNATIONAL BODIES REFERENCES APPENDIX 1 -- SOURCE DOCUMENTS APPENDIX 2 -- CICAD PEER REVIEW APPENDIX 3 -- CICAD FINAL REVIEW BOARD APPENDIX 4 -- INTERNATIONAL CHEMICAL SAFETY CARD RÉSUMÉ D'ORIENTATION RESUMEN DE ORIENTACI²N FOREWORD Concise International Chemical Assessment Documents (CICADs) are the latest in a family of publications from the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) -- a cooperative programme of the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). CICADs join the Environmental Health Criteria documents (EHCs) as authoritative documents on the risk assessment of chemicals. CICADs are concise documents that provide summaries of the relevant scientific information concerning the potential effects of chemicals upon human health and/or the environment. They are based on selected national or regional evaluation documents or on existing EHCs. Before acceptance for publication as CICADs by IPCS, these documents undergo extensive peer review by internationally selected experts to ensure their completeness, accuracy in the way in which the original data are represented, and the validity of the conclusions drawn. The primary objective of CICADs is characterization of hazard and dose-response from exposure to a chemical. CICADs are not a summary of all available data on a particular chemical; rather, they include only that information considered critical for characterization of the risk posed by the chemical. The critical studies are, however, presented in sufficient detail to support the conclusions drawn. For additional information, the reader should consult the identified source documents upon which the CICAD has been based. Risks to human health and the environment will vary considerably depending upon the type and extent of exposure. Responsible authorities are strongly encouraged to characterize risk on the basis of locally measured or predicted exposure scenarios. To assist the reader, examples of exposure estimation and risk characterization are provided in CICADs, whenever possible. These examples cannot be considered as representing all possible exposure situations, but are provided as guidance only. The reader is referred to EHC 1701 for advice on the derivation of health-based tolerable intakes and guidance values. 1 International Programme on Chemical Safety (1994) Assessing human health risks of chemicals: deriviation of guidance values for health-based exposure limits. Geneva, World Health Organization (Environmental Health Criteria 170). While every effort is made to ensure that CICADs represent the current status of knowledge, new information is being developed constantly. Unless otherwise stated, CICADs are based on a search of the scientific literature to the date shown in the executive summary. In the event that a reader becomes aware of new information that would change the conclusions drawn in a CICAD, the reader is requested to contact IPCS to inform it of the new information. Procedures The flow chart shows the procedures followed to produce a CICAD. These procedures are designed to take advantage of the expertise that exists around the world -- expertise that is required to produce the high-quality evaluations of toxicological, exposure, and other data that are necessary for assessing risks to human health and/or the environment. The first draft is based on an existing national, regional, or international review. Authors of the first draft are usually, but not necessarily, from the institution that developed the original review. A standard outline has been developed to encourage consistency in form. The first draft undergoes primary review by IPCS to ensure that it meets the specified criteria for CICADs. The second stage involves international peer review by scientists known for their particular expertise and by scientists selected from an international roster compiled by IPCS through recommendations from IPCS national Contact Points and from IPCS Participating Institutions. Adequate time is allowed for the selected experts to undertake a thorough review. Authors are required to take reviewers' comments into account and revise their draft, if necessary. The resulting second draft is submitted to a Final Review Board together with the reviewers' comments. The CICAD Final Review Board has several important functions: - to ensure that each CICAD has been subjected to an appropriate and thorough peer review; - to verify that the peer reviewers' comments have been addressed appropriately; - to provide guidance to those responsible for the preparation of CICADs on how to resolve any remaining issues if, in the opinion of the Board, the author has not adequately addressed all comments of the reviewers; and - to approve CICADs as international assessments. Board members serve in their personal capacity, not as representatives of any organization, government, or industry. They are selected because of their expertise in human and environmental toxicology or because of their experience in the regulation of chemicals. Boards are chosen according to the range of expertise required for a meeting and the need for balanced geographic representation. Board members, authors, reviewers, consultants, and advisers who participate in the preparation of a CICAD are required to declare any real or potential conflict of interest in relation to the subjects under discussion at any stage of the process. Representatives of nongovernmental organizations may be invited to observe the proceedings of the Final Review Board. Observers may participate in Board discussions only at the invitation of the Chairperson, and they may not participate in the final decision-making process. 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This CICAD on benzoic acid and sodium benzoate was prepared by the Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Aerosol Research, Hanover, Germany. The two compounds are being considered together because it is undissociated benzoic acid that is responsible for its antimicrobial activity. As benzoic acid itself is only slightly soluble in water, sodium benzoate -- which, under acid conditions, converts to undissociated benzoic acid -- is often used instead. This CICAD was based on reviews compiled by the German Advisory Committee on Existing Chemicals of Environmental Relevance (BUA, 1995), the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA, 1972a), and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) (WHO, 1996) to assess potential effects of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate on the environment and on humans. A comprehensive literature search of relevant databases was conducted in September 1999 to identify any relevant references published subsequent to those incorporated in these reports. Information on the preparation and peer review of the source documents is presented in Appendix 1. Information on the peer review of this CICAD is presented in Appendix 2. This CICAD was approved as an international assessment at a meeting of the Final Review Board, held in Sydney, Australia, on 21-24 November 1999. Participants at the Final Review Board meeting are listed in Appendix 3. The International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC 0103) for benzoic acid, produced by the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS, 1993), has also been reproduced in this document (Appendix 4). Benzyl acetate, its hydrolysis product, benzyl alcohol, and the oxidation product of this alcohol, benzaldehyde, are extensively metabolized to benzoic acid in experimental animals and humans. Therefore, toxicological data on these precursors were also utilized in the assessment of the potential health effects of benzoic acid. Benzoic acid (CAS No. 65-85-0) is a white solid that is slightly soluble in water. Sodium benzoate (CAS No. 532-32-1) is about 200 times more soluble in water. Benzoic acid is used as an intermediate in the synthesis of different compounds, primarily phenol (&gt50% of the amount produced worldwide) and caprolactam. Other end products include sodium and other benzoates, benzoyl chloride, and diethylene and dipropylene glycol dibenzoate plasticizers. Sodium benzoate is primarily used as a preservative and corrosion inhibitor (e.g., in technical systems as an additive to automotive engine antifreeze coolants). Benzoic acid and sodium benzoate are used as food preservatives and are most suitable for foods, fruit juices, and soft drinks that are naturally in an acidic pH range. Their use as preservatives in food, beverages, toothpastes, mouthwashes, dentifrices, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals is regulated. The estimated global production capacity for benzoic acid is about 600 000 tonnes per year. Worldwide sodium benzoate production in 1997 can be estimated at about 55 000-60 000 tonnes. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants and in animals. It is therefore a natural constituent of many foods, including milk products. Anthropogenic releases of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate into the environment are primarily emissions into water and soil from their uses as preservatives. Concentrations of naturally occurring benzoic acid in several foods did not exceed average values of 40 mg/kg of food. Maximum concentrations reported for benzoic acid or sodium benzoate added to food for preservation purposes were in the range of 2000 mg/kg of food. After oral uptake, benzoic acid and sodium benzoate are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glycine, resulting in the formation of hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted via the urine. To a lesser extent, benzoates applied dermally can penetrate through the skin. Owing to rapid metabolism and excretion, an accumulation of the benzoates or their metabolites is not to be expected. In rodents, the acute oral toxicity of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate is low (oral LD50 values of &gt1940 mg/kg body weight). In cats, which seem to be more sensitive than rodents, toxic effects and mortality were reported at much lower doses (about 450 mg/kg body weight). Benzoic acid is slightly irritating to the skin and irritating to the eye, while sodium benzoate is not irritating to the skin and is only a slight eye irritant. For benzoic acid, the available studies gave no indication of a sensitizing effect; for sodium benzoate, no data were identified in the literature. In short-term studies with rats, disorders of the central nervous system (benzoic acid/sodium benzoate) as well as histopathological changes in the brain (benzoic acid) were seen after feeding high doses (&gt1800 mg/kg body weight) over 5-10 days. Other effects included reduced weight gain, changes in organ weights, changes in serum parameters, or histopathological changes in the liver. The information concerning long-term oral exposure of experimental animals to benzoic acid is very limited, and there is no study available dealing specifically with possible carcinogenic effects. From a limited four-generation study, only a preliminary no-observed-(adverse-)effect level (NO(A)EL) of about 500 mg/kg body weight per day can be derived. With sodium benzoate, two long-term studies with rats and mice gave no indication of a carcinogenic effect. However, the documentation of effects is inadequate in most of these studies; therefore, no reliable NO(A)EL values can be derived. Data on its precursors support the notion that benzoic acid is unlikely to be carcinogenic. Benzoic acid tested negative in several bacterial assays and in tests with mammalian cells, while in vivo studies were not identified. Sodium benzoate was also inactive in Ames tests, whereas tests with mammalian cells gave consistently positive results. In one in vivo study (dominant lethal assay with rats), a positive result was obtained. At present, a genotoxic activity of sodium benzoate cannot be ruled out entirely. For benzoic acid, two limited studies gave no indication of adverse reproductive or developmental effects. With sodium benzoate, several studies on different species have been performed, and embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects as well as malformations were seen only at doses that induced severe maternal toxicity. In a dietary study in rats, a NO(A)EL of about 1310 mg/kg body weight was established. Data on its precursors support the notion that benzoic acid is unlikely to have adverse reproductive effects at dose levels not toxic to the mother. In humans, the acute toxicity of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate is low. However, both substances are known to cause non-immunological contact reactions (pseudoallergy). This effect is scarce in healthy subjects; in patients with frequent urticaria or asthma, symptoms or exacerbation of symptoms was observed. A provisional tolerable intake of 5 mg/kg body weight per day can be derived, although benzoates at lower doses can cause non-immunological contact reactions (pseudoallergy) in sensitive persons. As there are no adequate studies available on inhalation exposure, a tolerable concentration for exposure by inhalation cannot be calculated. From their physical/chemical properties, benzoic acid and sodium benzoate emitted to water and soil are not expected to volatilize to the atmosphere or to adsorb to sediment or soil particles. From the results of numerous removal experiments, the main elimination pathway for both chemicals should be biotic mineralization. Data from laboratory tests showed ready biodegradability for both substances under aerobic conditions. Several isolated microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) have been shown to utilize benzoic acid under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. From the experimental data on bioconcentration, a low to moderate potential for bioaccumulation is to be expected. From valid test results available on the toxicity of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate to various aquatic organisms, these compounds appear to exhibit low to moderate toxicity in the aquatic compartment. The lowest EC50 value of 9 mg/litre (cell multiplication inhibition) reported in a chronic study was observed in the cyanobacterium Anabaena inaequalis. EC50/LC50 values for the other aquatic species tested were in the range of 60-1291 mg/litre. Immobilization of Daphnia magna has been demonstrated to be pH dependent, with a lower 24-h EC50 (102 mg/litre) at acidic pH. For the freshwater fish golden ide (Leuciscus idus), a 48-h LC50 of 460 mg/litre has been determined. Developmental effects have been found in frog (Xenopus) embryos at a concentration of 433 mg/litre (96-h EC50 for malformation). For sodium benzoate, exposure of juvenile stages of aquatic organisms in a multispecies test (including Daphnia magna, Gammarus fasciatus, Asellus intermedius, Dugesia tigrina, Helisoma trivolvis, and Lumbriculus variegatus) resulted in 96-h LC50 values of greater than100 mg/litre. A 96-h LC50 of 484 mg/litre has been determined in the freshwater fish fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Owing to the limited available data on exposure levels in water, a quantitative risk characterization with respect to aquatic organisms in surface waters could not be performed. Taking into account the rapid biodegradability, the low to moderate bioaccumulation potential, the low toxicity to most aquatic species, and the rapid metabolism of these substances, benzoic acid and sodium benzoate will -- with the exception of accidental spills -- pose only a minimal risk to aquatic organisms. The few available data indicate that benzoic acid and sodium benzoate have only a low toxicity potential in the terrestrial environment. Except for the antimicrobial action of benzoic acid, characterized by minimum microbiocidal concentrations ranging from 20 to 1200 mg/litre, no data on toxic effects of benzoic acid on terrestrial organisms were available. For sodium benzoate, bacterial and fungal growth were inhibited in a pH-dependent manner by concentrations ranging from 100 to 60 000 mg/litre. Owing to the lack of measured exposure levels, a sample risk characterization with respect to terrestrial organisms could not be performed. 2. IDENTITY AND PHYSICAL/CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Benzoic acid (CAS No. 65-85-0; C7H6O2; C6H5COOH; benzenecarboxylic acid, phenyl carboxylic acid [E 210 (EU No. Regulation on Labelling of Foodstuffs)]; molecular weight 122.13) is a white solid that starts to sublime at 100°C, with a melting point of 122°C and a boiling point of 249°C. Its solubility in water is low (2.9 g/litre at 20°C), and its solution in water is weakly acid (dissociation constant at 25°C = 6.335 × 10-5; Maki & Suzuki, 1985; p K a 4.19). It is soluble in ethanol and very slightly soluble in benzene and acetone. It has an octanol/water partition coefficient (log K ow) of 1.9. Its vapour pressure at 20°C ranges from 0.11 to 0.53 Pa. Its calculated Henry's law constant at 20°C was given as 0.0046-0.022 Pa.m3/mol (BUA, 1995). Additional physical and chemical properties are presented in the International Chemical Safety Card reproduced in this document (Appendix 4). Sodium benzoate (CAS No. 532-32-1; C7H5O2Na; benzoic acid, sodium salt [E 211 (EU No. Regulation on Labelling of Foodstuffs)]; molecular weight 144.11) has a melting point above 300°C. It is very soluble in water (550-630 g/litre at 20°C) and is hygroscopic at a relative humidity above 50%. Its pH is about 7.5 at a concentration of 10 g/litre water. It is soluble in ethanol, methanol, and ethylene glycol. Dry sodium benzoate is electrically charged by friction and forms an explosive mixture when its dust is dispersed in air (Maki & Suzuki, 1985). 3. ANALYTICAL METHODS Analytical methods for the determination of benzoic acid include spectrophotometric methods, which need extensive extraction procedures and are not very specific; gas chromatographic (GC) methods, which are more sensitive and specific but need lengthy sample preparation and derivatization prior to determination; and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which has a high specificity and minimum sample preparation and does not require derivatization. A direct determination of benzoic acid in air by flash desorption at 240°C with helium into capillary-GC gave a detection limit of 0.1 ppm (0.5 mg/m3) in a 20-litre sample (=10 µg benzoic acid). This method has been developed and used for monitoring occupational exposure (Halvorson, 1984). A method for the determination of benzoic acid in solid food at 0.5-2 g/kg levels involves extraction with ether into aqueous sodium hydroxide and methylene chloride, conversion to trimethylsilyl esters, and detection by GC and flame ionization (Larsson, 1983; AOAC, 1990). For margarine, a method using HPLC and ultraviolet (UV) detection has been described with prior extraction with ammonium acetate/acetic acid/methanol (Arens & Gertz, 1990). When benzoic acid is used as a preservative in soft drinks and fruit drinks, other additives, colouring agents, and other acids (e.g., sorbate) may interfere with its analysis. Liquid chromatographic methods were developed to overcome this (e.g., Bennett & Petrus, 1977; Puttemans et al., 1984; Tyler, 1984). For the sensitive determination of benzoic acid in fruit-derived products, a clean-up pretreatment with solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography with UV absorbance detection is described (Mandrou et al., 1998). The detection limit is 0.6 mg/kg, with a range of quantification of 2-5 mg/kg. For soft drinks, a simultaneous second-order derivative spectrophotometric determination has been developed (detection limit 1 mg/litre) (Castro et al., 1992). Sodium benzoate was measured in soya sauce, fruit juice, and soft drinks using HPLC with a UV spectrophotometric detector. Before injection, all samples were filtered (Villanueva et al., 1994). GC determination of low concentrations (down to 10 ng/ml) of benzoic acid in plasma and urine was preceded by diethyl ether extraction and derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (Sioufi & Pommier, 1980). Detection was by 63Ni electron capture. HPLC methods have been developed for the simultaneous determination of benzoic acid and hippuric acid -- the metabolite of sodium benzoate that is eliminated in the urine -- that require no extraction step (detection limit for both, 1 µg/ml; Kubota et al., 1988). Hippuric acid and creatinine levels have been determined simultaneously by HPLC, and measured hippuric acid levels corrected for urinary creatinine excretion (Villanueva et al., 1994). 4. SOURCES OF HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE 4.1 Natural sources of benzoic acid Benzoic acid is produced by many plants as an intermediate in the formation of other compounds (Goodwin, 1976). High concentrations are found in certain berries (see section 6.1). Benzoic acid has also been detected in animals (see section 6.1). Benzoic acid therefore occurs naturally in many foods, including milk products (Sieber et al., 1989, 1990). 4.2 Anthropogenic sources 4.2.1 Benzoic acid Benzoic acid is produced exclusively by the liquid-phase oxidation of toluene (Srour, 1998). According to Srour (1998), the estimated global production capacity of benzoic acid is 638 000 tonnes per year, although over half of this is converted directly to phenol. The major producers of benzoic acid are the Netherlands (220 000 tonnes per year) and Japan (140 000 tonnes per year), followed by the USA (125 000 tonnes per year). Another reference gives the total European capacity as less than 153 000 tonnes (SRI, 1998). Benzoic acid is detected in car exhaust gases, presumably as an oxidation product of toluene (Kawamura et al., 1985), and in Japanese cigarettes (12 and 28 µg per cigarette in mainstream and sidestream smoke, respectively; Sakuma et al., 1983). It can also be produced through the photochemical degradation of benzoic acid esters used as fragrance ingredients (Shibamoto & Umano, 1985; Shibamoto, 1986). Benzoic acid has been detected in wastewater from the wood production industry in Norway and Sweden (Carlberg et al., 1986; Lindström & Österberg, 1986) and in foundry waste leachates (Ham et al., 1989), as well as in extracts of fly ash from municipal incinerators (Tong et al., 1984). 4.2.2 Sodium benzoate Sodium benzoate is produced by the neutralization of benzoic acid with sodium hydroxide. Worldwide sodium benzoate production in 1997 can be estimated at about 55 000-60 000 tonnes (Srour, 1998). The largest producers are the Netherlands, Estonia, the USA, and China. 4.3 Uses 4.3.1 Benzoic acid In 1988, of the benzoic acid produced in Europe, about 60% was further processed to phenol and 30% to caprolactam (for nylon fibres). Five per cent was used for the production of sodium and other benzoates, 3% for benzoyl chloride, and the rest for alkyd resins, benzoate esters, such as methyl benzoate, and various other products (Srour, 1989). These percentages are still approximately correct today (Srour, 1998). Caprolactam seems to be produced only by European companies (Srour, 1998). Benzoic acid is increasingly used in the production of diethylene and dipropylene glycol dibenzoate plasticizers in adhesive formulations (about 40 000 tonnes in 1997). It is also used to improve the properties of alkyd resins for paints and coatings and as a \"down hole\" drilling mud additive in secondary oil production. Its use as a rubber polymerization retarder is diminishing (Srour, 1998). Benzoic acid and sodium benzoate (see section 4.3.2) are used as preservatives in beverages, fruit products, chemically leavened baked goods, and condiments, preferably in a pH range below 4.5. A disadvantage is the off-flavour they may impart to foods (Chipley, 1983). Owing to their inhibitory effect on yeast, they cannot be used in yeast-leavened products (Friedman & Greenwald, 1994). Examples of upper concentrations allowed in food are up to 0.1% benzoic acid (USA) and between 0.15% and 0.25% (other countries) (Chipley, 1983). The European Commission limits for benzoic acid and sodium benzoate are 0.015-0.5% (EC, 1995). Benzoic acid and its salts and esters are found in 11 of 48 (23%) toothpastes (Sainio & Kanerva, 1995) to a maximum of 0.5% (Ishida, 1996) and in mouthwashes and dentifrices. Benzoic acid is also used in cosmetics (in creams and lotions with pH values under 4, up to 0.5%) (Wallhäusser, 1984). Sixteen out of 71 deodorants tested contained benzoic acid (Rastogi et al., 1998). Benzoic acid is a breakdown product of benzoyl peroxide, which is used as an additive at levels of between 0.015% and 0.075% to bleach flour (Friedman & Greenwald, 1994) and in dermatological antifungal preparations (BMA, 1998). Benzoic acid is reported to leach from denture-base acrylic resins, where benzoyl peroxide is added as a polymerization initiator (Koda et al., 1989, 1990). Benzoic acid can be used in combination with salicylic acid (Whitfield's ointment) as a fungicidal treatment for ringworm (BMA, 1998). 4.3.2 Sodium benzoate Although undissociated benzoic acid is the more effective antimicrobial agent for preservation purposes, sodium benzoate is used preferably, as it is about 200 times more soluble than benzoic acid. About 0.1% is usually sufficient to preserve a product that has been properly prepared and adjusted to pH 4.5 or below (Chipley, 1983). A major market for sodium benzoate is as a preservative in the soft drink industry, as a result of the demand for high-fructose corn syrup in carbonated beverages. Sodium benzoate is also widely used as a preservative in pickles, sauces, and fruit juices (Srour, 1998). Benzoic acid and sodium benzoate are used as antimicrobial agents in edible coatings (Baldwin et al., 1995). Sodium benzoate is also used in pharmaceuticals for preservation purposes (up to 1.0% in liquid medicines) and for therapeutic regimens in the treatment of patients with urea cycle enzymopathies (see section 9). Possibly the largest use of sodium benzoate, accounting for 30-35% of the total demand (about 15 000 tonnes of benzoic acid), is as an anticorrosive, particularly as an additive to automotive engine antifreeze coolants and in other waterborne systems (Scholz & Kortmann, 1991; Srour, 1998). A new use is the formulation of sodium benzoate into plastics such as polypropylene, to improve strength and clarity (BFGoodrich Kalama Inc., 1999). Sodium benzoate is used as a stabilizer in photographic baths/processing (BUA, 1995). 4.4 Estimated global release From data provided by the German producers, emissions of benzoic acid from industrial processes were less than 525 kg per year into the atmosphere, less than 3 tonnes per year into the River Rhine, and 8 tonnes per year into sewage or water purification plants (BUA, 1995). No data were available from other countries. Other anthropogenic releases of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate into the environment are emissions into water and soil from their uses as preservatives in food, toothpastes, mouthwashes, dentifrices, and cosmetics. There were no data available on the emission of benzoic acid from the disposal of antifreeze mixtures and waterborne cooling systems and other miscellaneous industrial uses. The amount of benzoic acid emitted to air from car exhaust gases as an oxidation product is not quantifiable from the available data. 5. ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORT, DISTRIBUTION, TRANSFORMATION, AND ACCUMULATION 5.1 Transport and distribution between media 5.1.1 Benzoic acid From its use pattern (see section 4), it can be expected that benzoic acid is released to surface waters and (from dumping sites) to leaching water (and groundwater). Minor amounts are expected to be emitted to the atmosphere. From its physicochemical properties (vapour pressure, Henry's law constant; see section 2), a significant volatilization of benzoic acid from water or soil is not expected. Owing to its solubility in water (see section 2), wet deposition from air may occur. Experimental data on wet and dry deposition from air are not available. 5.1.2 Sodium benzoate No information on the environmental transport and distribution of sodium benzoate could be identified. Owing to its use pattern, which is similar to that of benzoic acid, most of the amounts released to the environment are also expected to be emitted to aquatic compartments (e.g., surface waters). 5.2 Transformation 5.2.1 Benzoic acid The experimental determination of the photodegradation of benzoic acid in aqueous solution (25°C; lambda = 240-300 nm) in terms of quantum yield (average number of photons absorbed) resulted in very low values -- in the order of 6 × 10-2 mol/einstein1 (Oussi et al., 1998). However, benzoic acid adsorbed on silica gel (SiO2) and irradiated with UV light (lambda &gt 290 nm) for 17 h showed 10.2% photodegradation (Freitag et al., 1985). This may be due to a photocatalytic effect, which was also observed with other oxides, notably zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2). When benzoic acid was irradiated with sunlight in aqueous suspensions of zinc or titanium dioxide, 67% (after 2-3 h) or 90% (after 24 h) of the applied amount was mineralized (Kinney & Ivanuski, 1969; Matthews, 1990). 1 An einstein is a unit of light energy used in photochemistry, equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light of the frequency in question. Indirect photolysis by reaction with hydroxyl radicals is expected to be low. Hydroxyl radical rate constants (kOH) for benzoic acid and its anion have been estimated to be approximately 0.5 × 10-12 and 2 × 10-12 cm3/s, respectively (Palm et al., 1998). Standardized tests on ready (MITI, 1992) or inherent (Zahn & Wellens, 1980) biodegradation showed benzoic acid to be readily biodegraded. The degrees of aerobic degradation were as follows: MITI I 85% (100 mg/litre; (MITI, 1992) test 2 weeks; OECD No. 301C) Zahn-Wellens &gt90% (508 mg/litre; (Zahn & Wellens, test 2 days) 1980) Easy degradation of benzoic acid to methane and carbon dioxide was also observed in different non-standardized experiments using sewage sludge as inoculum (BUA, 1995). Benzoic acid was found to be degraded by adapted anaerobic sewage sludge at 86-93% after 14 days (Nottingham & Hungate, 1969), by aerobic activated sludge (adapted) at &gt95% after 5-20 days (Pitter, 1976; Lund & Rodriguez, 1984), and by unadapted aerobic activated sludge at 61-69% after 2-3 days with a preceding lag time of 2-20 h (Urano & Kato, 1986). The use of a synthetic sewage inoculated with laboratory bacterial cultures led to complete degradation of benzoic acid after 14 days under anaerobic conditions (Kameya et al., 1995). A greater variability in degradation (0-100%) was seen in tests using environmental matrices (e.g., rain, lake water, seawater, soil, etc.). It depended mainly on substance concentration and time for acclimation (see Table 1). Test durations exceeding 2 days resulted in removal of &gt40% when initial concentrations were below 20 mg/litre. A rapid mineralization occurred in groundwater and subsurface soil samples. In groundwater, a half-life of 41 h has been found for benzoic acid (initial concentration 1-100 µg/litre; metabolized to 14CO2) under aerobic conditions (Ventullo & Larson, 1985). Half-lives of 7.3 h and 18.2 h, respectively, have been observed for aerobic and anaerobic degradation of benzoic acid (initial concentration 1 mg/kg dry weight; metabolized to 14CO2) in subsurface soils of septic tank tile fields (Ward, 1985). Anaerobic degradation of benzoic acid (initial concentration 250 mg carbon/litre) in a methanogenic microcosm (consisting of aquifer solids and groundwater) required 4 weeks of adaptation, followed by nearly complete depletion after 8 weeks of incubation (Suflita & Concannon, 1995). Several isolated microorganisms have been shown to utilize (and therefore probably degrade) benzoic acid under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. They include, among others, fungal species such as Rhodotorula glutinis and other yeast-like fungi (Kocwa-Haluch & Lemek, 1995), the mould Penicillium frequentans (Hofrichter & Fritsche, 1996), and bacteria, such as Alcaligenes denitrificans (Miguez et al., 1995), Rhodopseudomonas palustris, several strains of denitrifying pseudomonads (Fuchs et al., 1993; Elder & Kelly, 1994; Harwood & Gibson, 1997), and Desulfomicrobium escambiense (Sharak Genthner et al., 1997). Although benzoic acid is primarily metabolized to hippuric acid in rats (see section 7), some other species do excrete other metabolites, such as dibenzoylornithine (hen), benzoylglutamic acid (Indian fruit bat), benzoylarginine (tick, insects), or benzoyltaurine (southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma) (Parke, 1968; Goodwin, 1976; James & Pritchard, 1987). 5.2.2 Sodium benzoate Experimental data on photodegradation of sodium benzoate are not available. As with benzoic acid, photolysis in aqueous solution is assumed to be unlikely with regard to its known UV spectra (Palm et al., 1998). Indirect photolysis by reaction with hydroxyl radicals plays only a minor role, with estimated and measured hydroxyl rate constants of about 0.33 × 10-11 cm3/s (Palm et al., 1998). Sodium benzoate was readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions in several standard test systems: Modified 84% (100 mg/litre; (King & Painter, MITI test 10 days) 1983) Modified 80-90% (50 mg/litre; (Salanitro et al., Sturm test 7 days) 1988) Closed bottle 75-111% (5 mg/litre; (Richterich & test 30 days) Steber, 1989) Degradation assays using seawater as test medium (\"natural water\") or as inoculum (marine filter material given into a synthetic marine medium) according to an adapted Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline (301B) resulted in a degradation of 85% and 97%, respectively (10 mg/litre; carbon dioxide measurement; 28 days) (Courtes et al., 1995). Anaerobic mineralization of sodium benzoate (50-90 mg/litre) by domestic sewage sludge varied from 50% to 96.5% (measurement of carbon dioxide and methane; 28-61 days) (Birch et al., 1989). In another study using anaerobic sludge from sewage works receiving a mixture of domestic and industrial wastewaters, 93% mineralization was observed after 1 week of incubation (measurement of carbon dioxide and methane; initial concentration 50 mg carbon/litre) (Battersby & Wilson, 1989).

Benzoate-acclimated sludges were reported to be capable of completely degrading benzoate concentrations of 3000 mg/litre within 5-7 days (Kobayashi et al., 1989). 5.3 Accumulation 5.3.1 Benzoic acid The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log K ow) of 1.9 (see section 2) indicates a low potential for bioaccumulation. Consistently, measured bioconcentration factors (BCFs) found in aquatic biota were low. BCFs of &lt10 (based on wet weight) have been determined for fish (golden ide, Leuciscus idus melanotus) and green algae (Chlorella fusca) after 3 and 1 days, respectively (Freitag et al., 1985). A 6-day BCF of 7.6 has been reported for another green alga (Selenastrum capricornutum) (Mailhot, 1987), and a 5-day BCF of 1300 (based on dry weight) in activated sludge (Freitag et al., 1985). The following 24-h bioaccumulation factors (focusing on uptake via medium plus feed within food chain members) have been obtained in aquatic model ecosystems operated with 0.01-0.1 mg of radiolabelled benzoic acid per litre: 21 (mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis), 102 (green alga, Oedogonium cardiacum), 138 (mosquito larvae, Culex quinquifasciatus), 1772 (water flea, Daphnia magna), and 2786 (snail, Physa sp.). Except for Daphnia and snail, the values were low (Lu & Metcalf, 1975). However, the very low exposure concentrations could likely have resulted in the calculation of the high BCF values, even with moderate uptake. Moreover, because this was a radiolabel study, it remains unclear if the label was still the parent compound. Geoaccumulation of benzoic acid has also been found to be low. Depending on soil depth, sorption coefficients (Kd) of 0.62 (18.9 m) to 1.92 (0.4 m) have been measured (Federle, 1988). Mobility determinations of 14C-labelled benzoic acid in different soils by means of thin-layer chromatography showed benzoic acid to be moderately mobile. Its mobility was positively correlated with soil pH and negatively correlated with aluminium and iron contents and effective anion exchange capacity (Stolpe et al., 1993). 5.3.2 Sodium benzoate No experimental data on bioaccumulation or geoaccumulation of sodium benzoate have been identified. From the information on benzoic acid, a significant potential for accumulation is not to be expected. 6. ENVIRONMENTAL LEVELS AND HUMAN EXPOSURE 6.1 Environmental levels Generally, benzoic acid can occur in almost all environmental compartments. Whether it exists in the undissociated or dissociated form depends on the specific physicochemical conditions. Above pH 6, the benzoate anion prevails (Chipley, 1983). There is a series of reports on positive qualitative analyses of benzoic acid in various environmental media, such as air (Belgium: Cautreels & van Cauwenberghe, 1978; Germany: Helmig et al., 1989), rain or snow (Norway: Lunde et al., 1977; Germany: Winkeler et al., 1988), surface waters (Norway, river: Schou & Krane, 1981), and soils (United Kingdom, heathland soil: Jalal & Read, 1983; Germany, river terrace soil: Cordt & Kußmaul, 1990), but these do not provide quantitative measurements. Semiquantitative measurements of concentrations of benzoic acid in urban air in Pasadena, California (USA) were in the range of 0.09-0.38 µg/m3 (Schuetzle et al., 1975). This was comparable to quantitative measurements performed in 1984 in Los Angeles, California (USA), which resulted in atmospheric concentrations of 0.005-0.13 µg/m3 (n = 8) (Kawamura et al., 1985). Most of the quantitative data compiled in Table 2 with respect to water samples refer to concentrations of benzoic acid in groundwater, with a maximum of 27.5 mg/litre measured in the vicinity of a point source. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in free and bound form in many plant and animal species. It is a common metabolite in plants and organisms (Hegnauer, 1992). Appreciable amounts have been found in gum benzoin (around 20%) and most berries (around 0.05%) (Budavari et al., 1996). For example, ripe fruits of several Vaccinium species (e.g., cranberry, V. vitis idaea; bilberry, V. macrocarpon) contain as much as 300-1300 mg free benzoic acid per kg fruit (Hegnauer, 1966). Benzoic acid is also formed in apples after infection with the fungus Nectria galligena (Harborne, 1983) or in Pinus thunbergii callus inoculated with a pathogenic pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) (Zhang et al., 1997). Among animals, benzoic acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) (Hegnauer, 1989) as well as in gland secretions of male muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) (Flood et al., 1989) or Asian bull elephants (Elephas maximus) (Rasmussen et al., 1990). Owing to its occurrence in many organisms, benzoic acid is naturally present in foods (review in Sieber et al., 1989, 1990). Some typical examples specifying reported ranges of means in selected foods have been compiled from Sieber et al. (1989) as follows: Milk traces - 6 mg/kg Yoghurt 12-40 mg/kg Cheese traces - 40 mg/kg Fruits (excluding traces - 14 mg/kg Vaccinium species) Potatoes, beans, cereals traces - 0.2 mg/kg Soya flour, nuts 1.2-11 mg/kg Honeys from different floral sources (n = 7) were found to contain free benzoic acid at concentrations of &lt10 mg/kg (n = 5) and of &lt100 mg/kg (n = 2) (Steeg & Montag, 1987). Because benzoic acid and its compounds are used as food preservatives (see section 4), some processed foods contain artificially elevated concentrations of these substances (see section 6.2). 6.2 Human exposure The main route of exposure of the general population to benzoic acid or sodium benzoate is likely via foodstuffs that contain the substances naturally or added as antimicrobial agents. There are a few analyses of processed foodstuffs available. They refer to different types of food items (juice, soft drinks, soya sauce varieties) from the Philippines (a total of 44 samples) and from Japan (a total of 31 samples) and to orange drinks sampled in England. The concentrations of sodium benzoate in the Philippine dietary samples ranged from 20 to &gt2000 mg/litre. The range in the Japanese products was 50-200 mg/litre, thus reflecting the lower maximum level of sodium benzoate allowed to be added to food in Japan as compared with the Philippines (Villanueva et al., 1994). Orange drinks from England contained sodium benzoate at concentrations ranging from 54 to 100 mg/litre (mean 76.7 mg/litre; n = 6) (Freedman, 1977). Generally, the actual uptake depends on the individual's choice of food to be consumed and the different limit values in different countries. Several intake estimations have been published. Three Japanese studies reported average daily intakes of benzoic acid from processed foodstuffs to be 10.9 mg per person (Toyoda et al., 1983a) and 1.4 mg per person (Toyoda et al., 1983b; Yomota et al., 1988), corresponding to 0.02-0.2 mg/kg body weight (for persons with a body weight of 50-70 kg). Both of the latter studies used the market basket method for intake calculations, whereas the first-mentioned study calculated intakes using the results of a national nutrition survey. The concentrations of benzoic acid in 3319 food samples analysed for this study (Toyoda et al., 1983a) ranged from not detected to 2100 mg/kg food. The maximum was found in salted fish (n = 7; mean 754 mg/kg). Another survey refers to the United Kingdom, where analyses of benzoic acid in foods and drinks in which it is permitted as well as intake estimates have been performed (UK MAFF, 1995). Sixty-five out of 122 samples tested contained detectable benzoic acid. The highest Table 2: Concentrations of benzoic acid in rain, snow, groundwater, and leachate samples.

The survey found that the concentrations of benzoic acid detected would lead to a dietary intake below 5 mg/kg body weight per day, even for adults with an above-average consumption. A frequent contributor to dietary exposure is soft drinks. A rough estimation based on the average daily consumption in Germany of such drinks (372 ml non-alcoholic beverages, excluding bottled water; BAGS, 1995) by 19- to 24-year-old men, assuming the concentration of benzoic acid present corresponds to a maximum allowable level of 150 mg/litre (EC, 1995), would result in a mean daily intake of 55.8 mg benzoic acid per person (or 0.80 mg/kg body weight, assuming a 70-kg body weight). For comparison, a similar calculation with sugar-free marmalade, jam, and similar spreads, which are allowed to contain higher levels of benzoic acid (500 mg/kg; EC, 1995), would result in a possible intake of 4.1 mg per person per day, or 0.06 mg/kg body weight per day (assumes a daily consumption of 8.2 g, according to BAGS, 1995). This was more than a possible intake via fruits containing natural benzoic acid. For example, a daily consumption of 40.4 g of fruits (BAGS, 1995) would lead to a possible intake of 0.57 mg benzoic acid per person per day (or 0.008 mg/kg body weight for a 70-kg person), if the reported maximum of 14 mg benzoic acid/kg (see section 6.1) were present. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) assessed the intake of benzoates from information provided by nine countries (Australia, China, Finland, France, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and USA) (WHO, 1999). Because diets differ among countries, the foods that contribute to benzoate intake would be expected to vary. The food category that contributed most to benzoate intake was soft drinks (carbonated, water-based, flavoured drinks) for Australia/New Zealand, France, the United Kingdom, and the USA. In Finland, 40% was in soft drinks. Soya sauce was the main source of benzoate in China and the second most important in Japan. The best estimates of national mean intakes of benzoates by consumers ranged from 0.18 mg/kg body weight per day in Japan to 2.3 mg/kg body weight per day in the USA. These estimates were based on analyses involving either model diets or individual dietary records and maximum limits specified by national governments or the European Union. The estimated intake by high consumers of benzoates, based on food additive levels in national standards, was 7.3 mg/kg body weight per day in the USA and 14 mg/kg body weight per day in China. Benzoates have been detected in groundwater, but not in drinking-water. Quantitative information on (oral or dermal/mucosal) exposure via cosmetic, hygienic, or medical products is rare, but the data available indicate a remarkable contribution to exposure. There are reports on leaching of benzoic acid from denture-base acrylic resins. After 10 days of immersion in artificial saliva, concentrations of up to about 3 mg/litre have been observed for benzoic acid, which is formed as a degradation product of the benzoyl peroxide that is added as a polymerization initiator (Koda et al., 1989, 1990). In Japan, commercial toothpastes have been found to contain benzoic acid at concentrations ranging from 800 to 4450 mg/kg (n = 18). Use of the toothpaste with the highest concentration (by 40 20-year-old female students) would result in a calculated daily intake of about 2.23 mg per person. This was about the same amount as their estimated intake from diet (Ishida, 1996). Benzoic acid is also used in dermatology as a fungicidal topical treatment for ringworm (Tinea spp.). The emulsifying ointment preparation contains benzoic acid at 6% and is applied twice daily (Goodman et al., 1990; BMA, 1998). Recent quantitative monitoring data on concentrations of benzoic acid or salts in ambient or indoor air are not available. Considering the few (low) levels of benzoic acid measured in urban air in the past, with a maximum of 0.38 µg/m3 (see section 6.1), inhalation may contribute only marginally to exposure of the general population. Using this maximum, a daily inhalative dose of 8.74 µg per person (or 0.12 µg/kg body weight) is obtained (assuming a daily inhalation volume of 23 m3 for a 70-kg adult male; WHO, 1994). Few quantitative data on occupational exposure have been identified. Nevertheless, there is a potential for inhalation or dermal contact in the chemical and allied product industries as well as in workplaces where these products are used. Air samples (n = 50) collected in an industrial environment (no further details given) over a year's time showed benzoic acid concentrations ranging from not detected to 1.5 mg/m3 (Halvorson, 1984). On the basis of the latter value, an inhalative dose of 14.4 mg per person per 8-h working time (or 0.2 mg/kg body weight) would result (assuming an inhalation volume of 9.6 m3 for an 8-h exposure with light activity; WHO, 1994). However, because of the lack of information on specific working operations and conditions involved (e.g., duration of exposure, use of protective clothes, etc.), it is impossible to derive a realistic estimate of occupational exposure. 7. COMPARATIVE KINETICS AND METABOLISM IN LABORATORY ANIMALS AND HUMANS After oral ingestion of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate, there is a rapid absorption (of undissociated benzoic acid) from the gastrointestinal tract in experimental animals or humans (US FDA, 1972a, 1973). From the figures on excretion given below, 100% absorption can be assumed. In humans, the peak plasma concentration is reached within 1-2 h (Kubota et al., 1988; Kubota & Ishizaki, 1991). Benzoic acid is not completely absorbed by the dermal route. In a study with six human subjects, Feldmann & Maibach (1970) found an uptake of 36% of the applied dose (14C-labelled benzoic acid dissolved in acetone; 4 µg/cm2; circular area of 13 cm2; ventral surface of the forearm; non-occlusive) within 12 h. The total uptake within 5 days was 43%. In a second study with 6-7 subjects (comparable method; application of 3, 400 or 2000 µg/cm2), the percent absorption decreased from 35% to 14% within 24 h. However, the total uptake per cm2 increased from 1 to 288 µg (Wester & Maibach, 1976). For sodium benzoate, no data concerning dermal uptake were identified in the literature. In vivo dermal studies with benzoic acid in experimental animals (e.g., guinea-pigs, mice, rats, pigs, dogs, rhesus monkeys) confirm the results with humans (Hunziker et al., 1978; Andersen et al., 1980; Wester & Noonan, 1980; Bronaugh et al., 1982a; Reifenrath et al., 1984; Carver & Riviere, 1989; Maibach & Wester, 1989; Bucks et al., 1990). Absorption ranged from 25% in pigs (Reifenrath et al., 1984; Carver & Riviere, 1989) to 89% in rhesus monkeys (Wester & Noonan, 1980; Maibach & Wester, 1989; Bucks et al., 1990). Due to the good database on humans and animals in vivo, in vitro studies performed with animal or human skin are not considered further (Franz, 1975; Bronaugh et al., 1982b; Hotchkiss et al., 1992; MacPherson et al., 1996). No information is available on absorption via inhalation. After oral and dermal uptake, benzoate is metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glycine, resulting in the formation of hippuric acid (Feldmann & Maibach, 1970; US FDA, 1972a; WHO, 1996; Feillet & Leonard, 1998). The rate of biotransformation in humans is high: after oral doses of 40, 80 or 160 mg sodium benzoate/kg body weight, the transformation to hippuric acid was independent of the dose -- about 17-29 mg/kg body weight per hour, corresponding to about 500 mg/kg body weight per day (Kubota & Ishizaki, 1991). Other authors obtained higher values of 0.8-2 g/kg body weight per day (US FDA, 1972a, 1973; WHO, 1996). Hippuric acid is rapidly excreted in urine. In humans, after oral doses of up to 160 mg/kg body weight, 75-100% of the applied dose is excreted as hippuric acid within 6 h after administration, and the rest within 2-3 days (Kubota et al., 1988; Fujii et al., 1991; Kubota & Ishizaki, 1991). The limiting factor in the biosynthesis of hippuric acid is the availability of glycine. The utilization of glycine in the detoxification of benzoate results in a reduction in the glycine level of the body. Therefore, the ingestion of benzoic acid or its salts affects any body function or metabolic process in which glycine is involved; for example, it leads to a reduction in creatinine, glutamine, urea, and uric acid levels (US FDA, 1972a, 1973; Kubota & Ishizaki, 1991; WHO, 1996). Another metabolite of benzoate is the benzoyl glucuronide. For example, the dog excretes considerable amounts of this metabolite in the urine (20% after a single dose of 50 mg/kg body weight; Bridges et al., 1970). In other species, this metabolite appears only after higher doses of about 500 mg/kg body weight (see above) of benzoic acid or sodium benzoate, resulting in a depletion of the glycine pool (Bridges et al., 1970; US FDA, 1972a; Kubota et al., 1988). In cats, glucuronidation is generally very low (Williams, 1967). In some species, including humans, minor amounts of benzoic acid itself are also excreted in the urine (Bridges et al., 1970; Kubota & Ishizaki, 1991). Experiments on the distribution and elimination of 14C-benzoate in the rat have shown no accumulation of sodium benzoate or benzoic acid in the body (US FDA, 1972a, 1973). In the acid conditions of the stomach, the equilibrium moves to the undissociated benzoic acid molecule, which should be absorbed rapidly. Benzoate from sodium benzoate would change from the ionized form to the undissociated benzoic acid molecule. As a result, the metabolism and systemic effects of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate can be evaluated together. 7.1 Precursors of benzoic acid Benzyl acetate, its hydrolysis product, benzyl alcohol, and the oxidation product of this alcohol, benzaldehyde, are precursors of benzoic acid in experimental animals and humans. Benzyl acetate is metabolized to benzoic acid and further to hippuric acid and benzoyl glucuronide to an extent of &gt90% both in mice and in rats of different strains. Benzyl alcohol was metabolized to benzoic acid and its conjugates in preterm infants. Benzaldehyde is metabolized to benzoic acid and its conjugates in rabbits to an extent of approximately 90% (WHO, 1996). 8. EFFECTS ON LABORATORY MAMMALS AND IN VITRO TEST SYSTEMS 8.1 Single exposure With oral LD50 values (administration by gavage) of 3040 mg benzoic acid/kg body weight in rats (Bio-Fax, 1973) and 1940-2263 mg benzoic acid/kg body weight in mice (McCormick, 1974; Abe et al., 1984), the acute toxicity of benzoic acid is low. Clinical signs of intoxication (reported for rats only) included diarrhoea, muscular weakness, tremors, hypoactivity, and emaciation (Bio-Fax, 1973). With oral LD50 values of 2100-4070 mg sodium benzoate/kg body weight in rats, the acute toxicity of sodium benzoate is similar to that of benzoic acid, as are the symptoms (Smyth & Carpenter, 1948; Deuel et al., 1954; Bayer AG, 1977). In four cats given diets containing 0 or 1% benzoic acid (approximately 0 or 450-890 mg/kg body weight), aggression, hyperaesthesia, and collapse starting 14-16 h after feed uptake were seen at a dose level equal to 630 mg/kg body weight. The duration of the syndrome was about 18-176 h, and the mortality rate was 50%. The histopathological examination of the two cats that died revealed degenerative changes in liver, kidneys, and lung, but no pathological findings in brain or spinal cord (Bedford & Clarke, 1972). The authors attributed the higher toxicity of benzoic acid in cats compared with other species to the low capacity of cats for glucuronidation (see section 7). In rats, exposure by inhalation to 26 mg/m3 over 1 h caused no mortality, but generalized inactivity and lacrimation were noted. The gross autopsy gave no significant findings (no further information available; Bio-Fax, 1973). In a limit test with rabbits, no mortality or signs of intoxication were seen after dermal application of 10 000 mg/kg body weight. The gross autopsy gave no significant findings (no further information available; Bio-Fax, 1973). 8.2 Irritation and sensitization 8.2.1 Benzoic acid Although there is a wide range of results from mostly non-standardized tests using various scoring systems, it can be concluded that benzoic acid is slightly irritating to the skin and irritating to the eyes. In different experiments with rabbits, which have not been performed according to current guidelines, benzoic acid applied as dry powder or in the form of a paste was not irritating to slightly irritating to the skin (score 1.66/8: Bio-Fax, 1973; no score given: Bayer AG, 1978; primary skin irritation index 0.5 [no further information available]: RCC Notox, 1988a). In an acute eye irritation/corrosion study with rabbits conducted according to OECD Guideline 405, some eye irritation was reported after application of benzoic acid in the form of a paste. Within 72 h, the scores for chemosis, reddening of the conjunctivae, iritis, and keratitis always remained at &lt2 (Bayer AG, 1986). In different non-standardized experiments with the solid substance, moderately irritating to severely irritating effects on the eye were noted (score 65/110: Bio-Fax, 1973; no score given: Bayer AG, 1978; score up to 108/110 [eyes rinsed after instillation] or up to 50/100 [eyes not rinsed]: Monsanto Co., 1983; score 35 according to the scheme of Kay & Calandra, 1962: RCC Notox, 1988b). In a maximization test, none of 15 guinea-pigs reacted positively after induction and challenge with a 10-20% solution of benzoic acid in water (Gad et al., 1986). In addition, the substance also tested negative in a Buehler test with guinea-pigs and in an ear swelling test and local lymph node assay with mice (Gad et al., 1986; Gerberick et al., 1992). The concentrations used for induction and challenge were 10-20% in acetone or water. However, a dose-dependent positive result was obtained in an ear swelling test with five guinea-pigs (induction with 0.2, 1, 5, or 20% in absolute ethyl alcohol; no challenge) used as a model for detecting agents causing non-immunological contact urticaria in humans. At several other regions (back, abdomen, flank site), a concentration of 20% failed to produce any reactions (Lahti & Maibach, 1984). 8.2.2 Sodium benzoate An acute dermal irritation/corrosion study with rabbits conducted according to OECD Guideline 404 (no data about physical state; score 0: RCC Notox, n.d., a) as well as a non-standardized experiment with the solid substance (score not given: Bayer AG, 1977) gave no indication for skin irritating effects. In a study performed according to OECD Guideline 405 (no data about physical state; RCC Notox, n.d., b), sodium benzoate was only slightly irritating to the eye (score 9.3, according to the scheme of Kay & Calandra, 1962). The application of the solid substance in a non-standardized experiment caused no irritation (score not given: Bayer AG, 1977). For sodium benzoate, no data on sensitizing effects were identified in the available literature. 8.3 Short-term exposure 8.3.1 Oral exposure In general, the database for benzoic acid and sodium benzoate is limited, and there are no studies available performed according to current guidelines. In addition, the documentation of these studies in most cases is insufficient. Detailed information is given in Table 3. From the available studies, it can be assumed that the toxicity of benzoic acid after short-term oral exposure is low. In high-dosed rats given approximately 2250 mg/kg body weight per day via diet over 5 days, excitation, ataxia, convulsions, and histopathological changes in the brain were seen. The mortality was about 50%; in some cases, bleeding into the gut was noted (Kreis et al., 1967). In two other studies with rats dosed with approximately 825 mg/kg body weight per day over 7-35 days (Kreis et al., 1967) or with 65-647 mg/kg body weight per day over 28 days (Bio-Fax, 1973), no clear treatment-related effects occurred. The reduced weight gain at 2250 and 825 mg/kg body weight per day may be attributed to reduced food intake in the study by Kreis et al. (1967). The relevance of the reduced relative kidney weight at 324 mg/kg body weight per day, which was not dose-related and not accompanied by changes in histopathological examinations, is unclear (Bio-Fax, 1973). As given in Table 3, both studies have several limitations (i.e., missing haematological and clinical chemical investigations, incomplete histopathological examinations); therefore, both of these studies were inadequate for derivation of a NO(A)EL. More information on dose-response can be gained from the study of Fujitani (1993), in which rats received sodium benzoate for 10 days in feed. At the lowest tested concentration of 1358 mg/kg body weight per day, changes in serum cholesterol levels occurred in females. At doses of 1568 mg/kg body weight per day and above, changes in further serum parameters and an increased relative liver weight were described. Histopathological changes of the liver, increased relative kidney weights, and disorders of the central nervous system (convulsions) were seen after dosing via diet with approximately 1800 mg/kg body weight per day. In several other studies listed in Table 3, adverse effects were seen only at higher doses after feeding sodium benzoate over periods from 10 to 42 days, so that a lowest-observed-(adverse-)effect level (LO(A)EL) of 1358 mg sodium benzoate/kg body weight per day for short-term exposure can be derived. With cats (Bedford & Clarke, 1972), also described in Table 3, the effect levels with benzoic acid were lower. However, due to the differences in the metabolism of benzoic acid in cats compared with other experimental animals and humans, this study was not taken into further consideration (see section 7).

mass aerodynamic diameter [MAD]/sigma g (standard deviation): 0, 4.6/3.1, 4.4/2.1, 5.2/2.1; mass median aerodynamic diameter [MMAD]: 4.7 µm) for 6 h per day and 5 days per week over 4 weeks. After this time, various serum biochemical, haematological, organ weight, and histopathological examinations were conducted. At &gt25 mg/m3, an increased incidence of interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate and interstitial fibrosis in the trachea and lungs in treated animals compared with controls was seen. Although the number of these microscopic lesions was higher in treated animals than in controls, there was no clear dose dependency for this effect. A concentration of &gt250 mg/m3 resulted in upper respiratory tract irritation, as indicated by inflammatory exudate around the nares, and significantly decreased absolute kidney weights in females. In the highest dose group, one rat per sex died, and the body weight gain was significantly decreased in males and females compared with controls. In addition, a significant decrease in platelets (males/females), absolute/relative liver weights (males), and trachea/lung weights (females) was noted (Velsicol Chemical Corp., 1981). Studies concerning repeated exposure by inhalation to sodium benzoate were not identified in the available literature. 8.3.3 Dermal exposure Studies concerning repeated dermal exposure to benzoic acid or sodium benzoate were not identified in the available literature. 8.4 Long-term exposure In general, the database for benzoic acid and sodium benzoate is limited, and there are no studies available performed according to current guidelines. In addition, the documentation in most cases is limited. Detailed information is given in Table 4. 8.4.1 Subchronic exposure In a 90-day study with rats dosed with 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8% sodium benzoate via diet, the mortality in the highest dose group (approx. 6290 mg/kg body weight per day) was about 50%. Other effects in this group included a reduced weight gain, increased relative weights of liver and kidneys, and pathological changes (not further specified) in these organs (Deuel et al., 1954).

In one of these studies, mortality was increased (15/50 rats of both sexes versus 3/25 in controls) (Marquardt, 1960). No further information on these studies is available, as only provisional results were published. In a four-generation study with rats, no effects on life span, growth rate, or organ weights were reported after dosing with up to 1% in the diet (approximately 500 mg/kg body weight per day) (Kieckebusch & Lang, 1960). Only animals of the third generation were autopsied after 16 weeks, but it is not clear if a complete histopathological investigation was performed. With sodium benzoate, two long-term studies with rats (administration of up to 1400 mg/kg body weight per day via diet over 18-24 months; Sodemoto & Enomoto, 1980) or mice (lifelong application of up to 6200 mg/kg body weight per day via drinking-water; Toth, 1984) are available. The results gave no indication of a carcinogenic effect in the tested animals. Although the study with mice was not performed according to current guidelines, the results seem to be reliable, due to a sufficient number of animals and detailed histopathological examinations. However, the results from the study with rats are uncertain, due to a very high mortality in animals of all dose groups, including controls (from an \"infection\" after 16 months), no detailed information about dosing regimen (only mean values given), and the considerable differences in the body weight of male and female rats (the body weight of females was about twice that of males). 8.4.3 Carcinogenicity of benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde As benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde are practically quantitatively metabolized via benzoic acid (see section 7.1), data on their carcinogenicity from 2-year studies may be used as supportive evidence in the assessment of the hazards associated with benzoic acid. Benzyl acetate was administered in corn oil via gavage to F344/N rats (0, 250, or 500 mg/kg body weight per day) or B6C3F1 mice (0, 500, or 1000 mg/kg body weight per day). In high-dose male rats, the incidence of acinar cell adenomas of the exocrine pancreas was increased, whereas there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in female rats. In high-dose male and female mice, benzyl acetate caused increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and squamous cell neoplasms of the forestomach (US NTP, 1986). In contrast to these findings, no such tumours were observed in another study with the same strain of rats and mice when benzyl acetate was administered via diet (rats: &lt575 mg/kg body weight per day; mice: &lt375 mg/kg body weight per day) (US NTP, 1993). With benzyl alcohol, no treatment-related increase in tumours was observed in F344/N rats or B6C3F1 mice after administration of &lt400 mg/kg body weight per day in rats or &lt200 mg/kg body weight per day in mice by gavage in corn oil (US NTP, 1989). In B6C3F1 mice dosed with benzaldehyde in corn oil by gavage (males: 0, 200, or 400 mg/kg body weight per day; females: 0, 300, or 600 mg/kg body weight per day), the incidences of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach were significantly greater in both exposure groups than in controls. A dose-related increase in the incidence of forestomach hyperplasia was also observed. In F344/N rats dosed with &lt400 mg/kg body weight per day, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity (US NTP, 1990). 8.5 Genotoxicity and related end-points 8.5.1 Benzoic acid Benzoic acid tested negative in several Ames tests and in one DNA damage assay with different Salmonella typhimurium strains in the presence or absence of metabolic activation (McCann et al., 1975; Ishidate et al., 1984; Nakamura et al., 1987; Zeiger et al., 1988). Only in one recombination assay with Bacillus subtilis H17 and M45 was a positive result obtained (Nonaka, 1989). However, due to missing experimental details (only results given), the validity of this study cannot be judged. There was no indication of genotoxic activity (chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchange) in tests with mammalian cells (Chinese hamster CHL and CHO cells, human lymphoblastoid cells, human lymphocytes) without metabolic activation (Oikawa et al., 1980; Tohda et al., 1980; Ishidate et al., 1984; Jansson et al., 1988). In vivo studies with benzoic acid were not identified in the literature. 8.5.2 Sodium benzoate Sodium benzoate also gave negative results in some Ames tests and in Escherichia coli in the presence or absence of metabolic activation (Ishidate et al., 1984; Prival et al., 1991). As with benzoic acid in recombination assays with Bacillus subtilis H17 and M45, positive results were obtained (Ishizaki & Ueno, 1989; Nonaka, 1989). Although sodium benzoate tested negative in a cytogenetic assay with WI-38 cells in the absence of metabolic activation (US FDA, 1974), consistently positive results (in contrast to the negative results of benzoic acid) were obtained in tests on sister chromatid exchange and chromosome aberrations with CHL/CHO and DON cells or human lymphocytes without metabolic activation (Abe & Sasaki, 1977; Ishidate & Odashima, 1977; Ishidate et al., 1984, 1988; Xing & Zhang, 1990). However, from the limited information given in the publications (i.e., only results given), it cannot be judged if these positive results may have been attributable to cytotoxic effects. In a valid in vivo study performed by the US FDA (1974), sodium benzoate tested negative in a cytogenetic assay (bone marrow) in rats after single or multiple oral application of doses up to 5000 mg/kg body weight. In a study with mice (comparable dosing scheme), there was also no indication of mutagenic activity in a host-mediated assay (US FDA, 1974). However, in a dominant lethal assay with rats (comparable dosing scheme; males were mated with untreated females following 7 or 8 weeks of dosing), some statistically significant and dose-related findings were reported in week 7: decreased fertility index for both treatment regimens and an increased number of preimplantation losses after single dosing (US FDA, 1974). In summary, the in vitro studies with benzoic acid gave no indications for genotoxic effects, whereas in vivo studies were not identified. Sodium benzoate was also inactive in bacterial test systems, whereas tests with mammalian cells gave consistently positive results. In addition, in an in vivo study with sodium benzoate (dominant lethal assay in rats), a positive result was obtained. As a result, a genotoxic activity of sodium benzoate cannot be ruled out entirely at present. Detailed information concerning the genotoxicity of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate in vitro is given in Table 5. 8.6 Reproductive and developmental toxicity 8.6.1 Fertility There are no studies available dealing specifically with the effects of benzoic acid or sodium benzoate on fertility that have been conducted according to current protocols. In a four-generation study with male and female rats, no adverse effects on fertility or lactation (only investigated parameters) were seen after dosing with benzoic acid at up to 1% in the diet (approximately 500 mg/kg body weight per day) (see also section 8.4.2; Kieckebusch & Lang, 1960). In studies with repeated oral application, no effects on the testes were observed in rats after dosing with benzoic acid at up to 647 mg/kg body weight per day in the diet for 4 weeks (see also Table 3; Bio-Fax, 1973) or in mice after lifelong application of 6200 mg sodium benzoate/kg body weight per day via drinking-water (see also Table 4; Toth, 1984). In summary, no clear statement can be given as to the possible effects of benzoic acid or sodium benzoate on fertility. 8.6.2 Developmental toxicity In a study with pregnant rats given only one oral dose of benzoic acid (510 mg/kg body weight on gestation day 9), there was no indication of an increase in resorption rates or malformations (Kimmel et al., 1971). For sodium benzoate, several teratogenicity studies are available that have been performed with different species. As given in Table 6, no effects were seen in dams or offspring of rats, mice, rabbits, or hamsters given oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg body weight per day (highest dose tested) during gestation (US FDA, 1972b). In a study with rats by Onodera et al. (1978), doses of 4% or 8% via diet (uptake of 1875 or 965 mg/kg body weight per day) induced severe maternal toxicity (no weight gain/loss in body weight, increased mortality) and were associated with embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects as well as malformations. However, the authors suggested that the effects on the dams and fetuses at &gt4% dietary levels were caused by reduced maternal feed intake, leading to malnutrition. The intake of sodium benzoate in the highest dose group (8%) was lower than that at 2%, where no adverse effects were seen. From this study, a NO(A)EL of about 1310 mg/kg body weight per day can be derived. In a study with rats by Minor & Becker (1971), however, fetotoxic and teratogenic effects occurred at 1000 mg/kg body weight per day. In this study, sodium benzoate was applied by intraperitoneal injection. Therefore, differences in pharmacokinetics between oral and intraperitoneal administration may be the reason for the higher sensitivity. Studies performed with eggs of leghorn hens (single injection of &lt5 mg per egg), chick embryo neural retina cells (lowest-observed-effect concentration [LOEC] of 34.7 mmol/litre), and a chick embryotoxicity screening test (single injection of &lt0.1 mg per embryo) gave no indication of embryotoxic or teratogenic effects (Verrett et al., 1980; Jelinek et al., 1985; Daston et al., 1995). 8.6.3 Reproductive toxicity of benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde As benzyl acetate and benzyl alcohol are practically quantitatively metabolized via benzoic acid (see section 7.1), data on their reproductive toxicity may be used as supportive evidence in the assessment of the hazards associated with benzoic acid. Dietary benzyl acetate (up to 5% in the diet for 13 weeks) had no effect on the weights of the epididymis, cauda epididymis, or testis, on sperm motility or density, or on the percentage of abnormal sperm in mice or rats (US NTP, 1993). Benzyl acetate (0, 10, 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg body weight per day by gavage on days 6-15) had no significant effects on maternal health in rats and did not induce changes in the numbers of corpora lutea, implantations, live or dead fetuses, or resorptions, implantation ratio, sex ratio, external or internal malformations, or placental weight. Fetal weights were significantly reduced at the highest dose (Ishiguro et al., 1993). Benzyl alcohol at 550 mg/kg body weight per day by gavage on days 6-15 of pregnancy had no effect on gestation index, average number of live pups per litter, postnatal survival, or pup body weight on days 0 and 3 in CD-1 mice (York et al., 1986), while 750 mg/kg body weight per day (days 7-14) induced a reduction in the pup weight and maternal weight gain, but no pup mortality or changes in mating or gestation indices, the total number of resorptions, or the number of live pups per litter (Hardin et al., 1987).
