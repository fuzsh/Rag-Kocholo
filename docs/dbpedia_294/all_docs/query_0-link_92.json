        "text": "Structural biochemistry has become vital in the development of new medicine. Medicines are now being studied with the tools of biochemistry such as X-Ray Crystallography. Modern methods of biochemistry are usually used to understand the enzyme structure by understanding the folding and bending of the structure. Enzymes are biological catalysts that increase the rate of reactions by lowering the energy required to form the transition state of the reaction. Enzymes are typically made of a protein or of a group of proteins. Understanding protein tertiary and quaternary structure can tell scientists how a medicine does its job. Medicinal scientists have made use of the structure of enzymes to develop new drugs from old drugs. Drugs cross the cell membrane by first letting a message or drug encounter the outside of a cell and make it contact the receptor. Then, a connecting transducer passes the message inward, which finally gets signal amplified, prompting the cell to complete its function. Many scientists believe that in 10 to 20 years the field of medicine will be drastically different especially in the manner in which doctors prescribe drugs to their patients. Currently, drugs are administered based on average dosages that have been determined based on the size of an individual and their age. The effectiveness of a drug is depicted on a graph called \"dose-response curves\". These graphs are created to show a relationship between the desired effect of the drug and the amount of the drug administered. Typically there is another curve displaying the amount of drug that causes maximal side effects. Pharmacologist uses this data to first prove that the drug is effective and then use it to provide doctors with a safe dosage range to the drug to their prescribe patients.\n\nGood medicine design relies on many variables which include its absorbency into the body, its activity of working correctly, how long it will be active, and its toxicity. Knowledge of the structures of target molecules allows for a more direct path of finding a molecule that will fit the shape of the target perfectly, creating the most useful drug. Therefore, molecules that obviously don’t fit the target will automatically be known to not work in its present state and should be disregarded or reconfigured.[1]\n\nIn the future the goal is to provide tailor-made drugs for each individual. The idea is that a drug will be designed based on the individuals DNA sequence which describes the individual’s personal biochemistry. The desire behind this is for a drug that is more effective and that causes fewer side effects. The desire for tailor-made drugs was not even a realistic venture less than a decade ago, but with the extreme advances in DNA sequencing this dream could become a reality in a couple of decades.\n\nThe number of people diagnosed with cancer every year continues to be extremely high. Scientists have been diving into the relatively new field of nanoparticle based drug design in hopes of making more effective anti-cancer drugs. Current chemotherapy techniques are effective at destroying cancer cells, but also are toxic to healthy cells that are essential to the body.\n\nNanomedicines can be chemically engineered to specifically target cancer cells without obtaining the harsh effects of chemotherapy. Different parts of nanoparticles can be modified in order for the medicine to be able to enter into the bloodstream of a person and target the cancer cells without being broken down by the liver. Some nanoparticles are packaged in lipsomes[check spelling], while many new compounds are delivered through biodegradable polymers. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a biodegradable polymer that protects the nanoparticles from being visible to immune cells, which helps the medicine to reach its target destination. Some of the nanoparticle shells are made with sugars such as “cyclodextrins,” but are covered in PEG. The hydroxyl groups on the sugars make the compounds soluble in water, yet easy to disintegrate in acidic environments in order to release the drug. Approximately twelve nanoparticle based anti-cancer drugs are in clinical trials and are waiting to be approved to be distributed to the world.\n\nNanoparticles are also being used to carry RNA molecules to target cancer cells through antisense therapy. If the RNA molecules are able to reach the cancer cells with the help of nanoparticles, then they can have the ability to bind to the cancer cells’ own RNA and inactivate certain genes. For example, antisense therapy can halt the production of proteins in cancerous cells, which helps stop the overall growth of the cancer.\n\nNatural products have assisted medicine in many different ways. It is found that natural products contain many disease and cancer fighting properties. They can be synthesized into a compound to used in medicine. For example, small plant like organisms such as cyanobacteria that reside in wet environments have these powerful cancer and bacteria killing sources. A professor named Dick Moore from the University of Hawaii at Mano was able to devise a way to find compounds that was especially good against slowly developing and difficult to treat tumors. An example of this was a compound called cryptophycin-8, which could rip apart the cellular scaffolding in a wide variety of solid tumors used in mice.\n\nAlso there has been a huge variety of substances and chemicals in the sea that have immensely powerful cancer and disease fighting capabilities. This has propelled scientists to develop new ways to synthetically create compounds that are derived from these natural products in the sea. The goal of making a good drug is the result of scientists playing around with natural compounds to extract their medicinal properties but taking away the parts that causes unwanted side effects.\n\nMedicines can potentially be made from even the most strange materials. For example, chemist Jim Gloer from the University of Iowa has been researching for ways to use a fungus that lives in animal feces to create antibiotics. These organisms are called coprophiles, which means feces loving have a lot of potential for developing useful drugs. These fungi release chemicals that kill off neighboring species, which is what biomedical researches and scientists want so that they can develop medicines that kill unwanted fungus that are hazardous to humans.\n\nAccording to World Health Organization’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, the current definition of disease include in 22 chapters. These are divided into over 2500 blocks which give us thousands of phenotypic descriptors of disease.\n\nBiochemists are focused on understanding structure of molecules and process in which these molecules come together. Understanding these processes also give us a chance to “correct” them when they go wrong. But there are many different keys that come into consideration to acquire therapies. For example in the case of drug development, it is the combination of the knowledge of chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, etc. This is obviously not a predictable process because the high failure rate of experimental drugs.\n\nBiochemists look into biochemistry of disease to study important points which they can use to develop new disease therapies. These major points in the field are biosynthesis of unusual microbial metabolites, structure-based design of inhibitors, mechanisms or drug resistance, and the role of protein folding dynamics that can lead to inappropriate protein folding and aggregation.\n\nService, Robert F. \"Nanoparticle Trojan Horses Gallop From the Lab Into the Clinic.\" Science 15 October 2010: 314-315\n\nDavis, Alison. \"The Chemistry of Health.\" NIGMS August 2006: 36-42. http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/chemhealth/coh.pdf\n\nIn the field of Biochemistry, several important themes contributing to drug design should be evaluated in order to cure diseases, including structure-based design of inhibitors, mechanisms of drug resistance, biosynthesis of unusual microbial metabolites, and the role of protein dynamics that can lead to protein-misfolding.[1]\n\nThe Biochemistry of Disease: Desperately Seeking Syzygy Annual Review of Biochemistry Vol. 78: 55-63 (Volume publication date July 2009) DOI: 10.1146/annurev-biochem-120108-082254 John W. Kozarich http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-biochem-120108-082254?journalCode=biochem\n\nIn order to delivery drug to the desired destination, targeting is an important subject in drug delivery. Ligand is a substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve for a biological purpose. There are three classes of ligands that are commonly used for drug delivery targeting. Antibodies and/or antibody fragments, peptides, and aptamers. Depending upon the situation of targeting, different type of ligand is used.\n\nDrug targeting can be defined as the method and efficiency of delivering drugs to a target organ or system. Although this may seem like a simple process (just eat it or inject it into the blood right?), there are actually so many obstacles that have to be solved that it takes pharmaceutical companies years to develop one drug. These challenges include if the drug actually makes it to the target organ, and if it makes it to the organ in significant amounts that would actually be of benefit. Its common knowledge that if drug is eaten, it'll eventually end up in the blood and go everywhere in the body. What is not usually knows is if the drug is too thinly spread out over the body to be of any use, and the consequences of these drugs arriving at an non-target organ.\n\nThe fact that drug concentrations could be diluted to the point where it has no effect could be linked to a pharmaceutical's attempt in finding out the dosage of this drug. When testing a drug, scientists must find out how much of the drug could be administered to give a significant effect, while also testing for if increasing the dosage would increase the side effects. A balance of these two must be met in order for a drug dosage to be determined. Some variables would include the patient's body mass, age, blood levels, health of kidney and liver, and other medications the patient is taking. All these factors would play a role in determining how much drug to administer to the patient. If a patient has healthy liver, there's a good chance that a lot of the drug is going to be destroyed before it reaches the bloodstream. If the patient has low amount of blood, not a lot of drug has to be administered because it wont be as diluted. other medications the patient is taking could have chemical reactions that could lead to serious side effects. Another factor to take into account is the chemical weight and properties of the drug. If the drug has high molecular weight, not as much of the drug needs to be administered.\n\nMainly, pharmaceuticals are more concerned with what would happen if a drug meant for the kidney ends up near the lungs, or something similar to this. This could be called side effects. Often this is solved by observing the carbohydrate chains on the surface of cell membranes to discover what receptors cells of specific organs have. Developing a drug that fits into most of these receptors (a broad and commonly structured drug) would increase the chances of side effects. It is therefore crucial to develop a drug that binds to a cell's receptor as specifically as possible to reduce side effects. Discovering side effects and minimizing these side effects is a big part of getting a drug pass the examination tests and get on the shelves of pharmacies.(5)\n\nTwo drugs that target harmful microbes at the cell membrane level include polymyxins and nystatin. Polymyxins interfere with bacterial cell membrane, and therefore bacteria cannot function as osmotic barriers. The functional distinction between polymyxins and nystatin is that nystatin interferes with cell membranes of fungi and yeast whereas polymyxins disrupt bacterial cell membrane. Nystatin will bind to ergosterol, an essential component found in fungi cell membrane, which leads to cell membrane interruption that is representative with appearances of holes in the membrane.\n\nFluoroquinolones, or Cipro, inhibits synthesis of nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA, by preventing gyrase, an enzyme needed for DNA replication, from unzipping. As a result, there is no DNA replication. Fluoroquinolones is broad-spectrum and extremely potent and thus can be used on difficult to treat bacteria, such as Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Another anti-microbial drug that is targeted at the DNA level is rifampin, which is used to treat TB by inhibiting prokaryotic RNA polymerase, which in turn prevents transcription and therefore, no production of mRNA. The bacteria cannot live without these essential proteins.\n\nLinezolid, or Zyvox, disrupts the initiation of protein synthesis, and thus is used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), which are two of the most difficult pathogens to treat. Other antimicrobials acting at the protein synthesis level include streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracyclines, and erythromycin.\n\n\"Antibody Fragmentation.\" Antibody Fragmentation. N.p., n.d.

It includes subject such as Nanoengineering, chemical engineering, bioengineering, chemistry, material science, biology, physics, pharmacy, and medicine. In order to ensure a drug is effectively taken place inside the body, the biological system, the chemical reactivity of the drug, and the physical transportation inside the body must be well considered. Nanomedicine is a field that is being heavily studied in recent decades. There are more and more innovative ways to make an already known drug more effective, such as combining a drug with two or three materials to achieve a goal that just drug alone cannot achieve.\n\nExample Quantum Dot – Aptamer Conjugates In cancer treatment, it is important to see whether the cancer drug is killing tumor tissue or normal healthy tissue. Therefore, imaging is an important application. Fluorescent and quantum dots are two good indicators. Quantum dots, a type of semiconductor nanocrystal that functions similarly as fluorescent, has been increasingly utilized in biological system and labeling due to their unique optical properties, including board range of absorption with narrow photoluminescence spectra, high quantum yield, low photobleaching, and resistance to chemical degradation. The surface of quantum dot can be modified such that antibodies, aptamers, or peptide bonds can be attached to it. Now this complex exhibits several properties that are useful for cancer therapy.\n\nThe specific example given here comprises of quantum dots, aptamers, and doxorubicin conjugate (as the schematic shown below) that targets and kills prostate cancer cells. The quantum dot fluorescent functions as an imaging tool. One end of the RNA aptamers attaches to the surface of quantum dot and the other end attaches to doxorubicin. This aptamer also functions as an active ligand that targets cancer cells. Lastly, doxorubicin is a well-known cancer therapeutic agent that also has slight fluorescent property. The fluorescent of doxorubicin is too weak to be detected; therefore, it is not viable. However, if quantum dots are used, the fluorescent signal inside thin human body tissue can be detected.\n\nWhen the quantum dot is by itself, it has a fluorescent color of green. That is known as the “on” state. In order to temporarily “turn off” the fluorescent of quantum dot, the fluorescent property of doxorubicin becomes crucial in this conjugate. When two materials both exhibit a fluorescent property are close together, they “quench” each other. In this case, they can temporarily disable the fluorescent property of each other. Doxorubicin exhibits a red fluorescent, while this specific quantum dot exhibits a green fluorescent. When the two form a conjugate, the two colors are able to “cancel” each other. The ratio to cancel doxorubicin to quantum dot is approximately 8 to 1.\n\nBefore this conjugate enters the cancer cell, this conjugate is in the “off” state. When the conjugate is being transported to the tumor site in blood streams by both convection and diffusion, the conjugate is able to target tumor cell due to the aptamer ligands on the conjugate. After the conjugate enters through endocytosis into the tumor cell, the conjugate is sent to lysosome. The lysosome is able to digest aptamer, breaking the conjugate. The release of doxorubicin recovers the fluorescent property of the quantum dot back to the “on” state, enabling imaging and detection. The released doxorubicin moves to the nucleus to kill the cancer cell. The figure shown below is a schematic of the conjugate inside the cancer cell.\n\nThis innovative conjugate is able to not only target the cancer cell but also provide imaging inside the cancer cell. There are numerous other methods that is yet to be discovered to achieve more effective targeted drug delivery.\n\nBagalkot, Vaishali, Liangfang Zhang, Etgar Levy-Nissenbaum, Sangyong Jon, Philip W.

Print. Pure drugs are usually combined with inactive materials to produce a pharmaceutical dosage (dosage form). It is the physical form of the drug that are that are sold to the patient. The common dosage forms that are used widely in pharmacy practice are listed below.\n\nTablets are found generally in various size, color, shape, and weight. It is so called the most popular dosage form that is widely used in pharmacy practice because of its advantages: compactness, portability, accuracy, convenience, and lack of taste. Several formulation aids (diluents, excipients, binders, lubricants, disintegrators, coloring, and flavoring agents) are combined with the active ingredient before the mixture is put through mechanical compression in a tableting machine to produce a compact SOLID dosage form of drugs.\n\nHowever, the drug must be break-down in the stomach so that it will be released under molecular form to be biologically active. This process contributes to one of the properties of tablet form: long onset of action.\n\na form of tablets that can be chewed or dissolved in the mouth before swallowing.\n\nthis kind of tablets is not designed to be dissolved in the stomach but is meant to be broken down in the intestines of a patient. To make this happen, the compressed tablets are coated with specific substances to prevent them from melting inside the stomach. Because of it specific structure, these drugs are inhibited to be chewed or crushed before swallowing. Antacids cause dissolution in the stomach so it is forbidden to be taken with the enteric- coated tablets.\n\nare designed to be placed under patients’ tongue so that the active ingredient can be absorbed into the blood stream right away and make its first circulates throughout the body before breaking down in the liver.\n\nare left between the gum and cheek of the patients because this drug will dissolves there slowly over a period of time.\n\nare drugs that coated with water-soluble material that protect sensitive drugs from deterioration due to light and air, masks the odor or taste for the patients to obtain easier.\n\nother names are long-acting/ delayed release /prolonged-action tablets. These tablets are designed specially so that the active ingredient is metabolized slowly at a constant rate for a prolonged period of time, around 8 to 24 hours.\n\nhas oval or discoid in shape so that it will dissolve slowly and kept in contact with the mouth or throat for a prolonged period of time.\n\nare being implanted as a method of birth control or hormones such as testosterone and estradiol. These cylindrically shaped tablets are implanted under the skin so that the drug can be absorbed slowly in a long period of time.\n\nare a solid forms of dosage in which the drug is packed inside a soft or hard gelatin shell. The shell sizes range from 000 to a number 5 capsule (largest to smallest respectively), and will dissolves to release the drug after 10 to 30 minutes in the stomach. The advantages of this dosage form are that it will provide various distinguishable shapes and colors, moreover, will eliminate the tastes and odors the drug has.\n\nThis kind of tablets will serve as the mask of unpleasant, bitter tasting drug by using the acid-base reaction between sodium bicarbonate with either citric acid or tartaric acid. The reaction will help dissolves matter into the solutions and causes “effervescence” by the liberation of carbon dioxide gas.\n\nReifman, Noah.

Print.\n\nare homogenous mixtures that include one or more soluble ingredients (can be a liquid, solid, or gas) dissolved in the solvent (water or water-miscible liquid).\n\nThe advantages of this dosage form is that it can be absorbed relative quickly in the gastrointestinal tract, easier to swallow so that it is usually prescribed for pediatric or geriatric doses. If drug is an external solutions form it must be carefully label.\n\nthis type of drug is mostly used for antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, and vitamins. It is defined as sweet, viscous, concentration aqueous solutions of sugar.\n\nThis is probably the most widely used type of liquid dosage form because of its pleasant taste, relative stability, and ease of preparation characteristics. It is a sweetened hydroalcoholic solution in with the concentration of alcohol may vary (no more than 20%)\n\nTinctures is another form of alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions like elixers but with a higher concentration of alcohol. Vegetable, animal, or chemical materials are main ingredient for this form.\n\ncontains finely divided insoluble medicinal products (called internal phase) dispersed in aqueous external phase (usually contains additional flavoring agent).\n\nPatients can take this drugs by mouth or being applied externally like lotions or be injected into the body depend on which type of suspensions was dispensed to them.\n\nAvailable in both internal and external preparations. Must carefully read the instruction to see if the emulsion is to be used internally or externally.

Patients instill multiple medicated eyedrops should wait 5 minutes between instillations.\n\nOpthalmic ointments are used for instilling into the eye. Theirs characteristic as a sterile emulsions give them the ability to stay contact with the eyes for a longer time period than ophthalmic drops.\n\nWarning: eyesight becomes blur after usage so patients should only use this drug at bedtime only.\n\nMust be pre-soaked with medication prior to inserting into the eye; its advantages are providing controlled-release and longer contact of the drug with the eye.\n\nUsed for certain antibiotics like tetracycline and chloramphenicol.\n\nDrug is placed in the lower eye sac between the sclera and the eyelid. Its advantages is providing a longer contact time between the drug and the eyes, control the amount of medication released into the eyes. Need to be pre-soaked prior to usage.\n\nReifman, Noah.

It is used for insertion into the rectum, vaginal cavity, or urethral tract where it will perform its therapeutic effects locally or will be absorbed into the bloodstream of the patients.\n\nDifferent length and weight of suppositories are varies for adult and pediatric.\n\nAdult rectal suppositories weigh ~2grams and ~2.5 to 3.5 cm long, double the size and weight of pediatric suppositories.\n\nVaginal suppositories are globular, ovoid or conical, weigh 3 to 5 grams.\n\nUrethral suppositories has diameter of 3mm to 5 mm, length varies differently in female urethra and male urethra (60 to 75 in female and 100 to 150 in male).\n\nThis type of dosage form of drug is inhaled via the nose or mouth in the form of gas or air, so that the micro small medicinal particles can flow into the alveolar sacs in the lungs.\n\nNeed to be shaken well prior to usage.\n\nAround 4 drops of this solutions or suspensions can be instilled into the ear canal.\n\nWarning: only used for the ear and have to shake well if the drug is a suspension.\n\nIt is the liquid preparations that are used by introduced into the rectum by a bulb syringe at room temperature. This drug’s effects are orientated to be either local or systemic.\n\nIt is the aqueous solutions which are introduced into a cavity of the patients’ body for the main purpose of cleaning the cavity. For example, eye douches are used to removed foreign particles from the eyes; vaginal douches help cleanse and provide medication for the vaginal mucosa while directed to the female vagina.\n\nReifman, Noah.

The goal and the challenge of the researchers is to minimize the drug toxicity to the body and to maximize the drug activity inside the body. In order to keep the drug concentration inside of blood at the therapeutic window, a sustainable drug release is desired. To achieve this, many nanotechnology drug platforms are available. The most common ones are liposomes and hydrogels.\n\nHydrogel can encapsulate drugs inside its core. When the environment changes, the hydrogel is able to swell, which causes the release of drug.\n\nchange in pH causes swelling causes release of drug\n\nchange in ionic strength causes change in concentration of ions inside the gel causes change in swelling causes release of drug\n\nElectron-donating compounds causes formation of charge and transfer complex causes change in swelling causes the release of drug.\n\nA substrate is present, and enzymatic conversion causes the product the change and swell, which causes the release of drug.\n\nA magnetic field is applied to change the pores in gel to change in swelling and thus release of drug.\n\nA change in temperature causes change in polymer-polymer and water-polymer interactions that changes the shape of hydrogel and causes the release of drug.\n\nAn electric field is applied that causes the membrane the charge and causes the electrophoresis of charged drug and change the shape of hydrogel to release the drug\n\nUntralsound irradiation is used to increase the temperature to cause the hydrogel to swell to release the drug.\n\nZhang, Liangfang. \"Controlled Drug Delivery Systems.\" CENG 207 Lecture 11.

Drug development today is constantly pressured from multiple different aspects due to the all-time low of drug approval on the market. Drug developers must acknowledge this trend even before the process begins. Unfortunately for some companies, resources are already limited and do not have the luxury of researching and developing as easily as others.\n\nRegulatory requirements and commitments are continually increasing over time and have effected the trial size and length. This has led to an overall increase in total cost of drug development. The FDA now requires more sample trials in order to be approved, this is to ensure safety and efficacy.\n\nDue to the increase in clinical trials, it has become necessary for trials to occur in foreign countries. Unfortunately, each country has its own set of regulations for drugs, further increasing the difficulty of trials.\n\nElectronic submission to regulatory authorities has become mandatory in some countries such as the US. The transition to the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD), will soon become the mandatory and preferred way of submission. While the eCTD does come with many benefits, developing countries must quickly adapt to the system, further slowing the development process of drugs.\n\nDrug administrations and absorption levels linked to the effect and side effect of the drug are a crucial part of the process.\n\nMany compounds have significant effects when taken into the body, but only every small fraction of them have the potential to become useful drugs. A foreign compound, synthesized in a wet lab or extracted from nature, must be able to adapt in the cells of an organism to function effectively without causing any serious harm. Drug candidates must be potent modulators of their targets as wee have suitable properties to reach their targets\n\nFor drugs to be effective, it needs to bind a sufficient number of its target proteins when taken at a reasonable dose. One factor in determing drug effectiveness is the strength of the interaction between the drug and its target. A molecule that binds to some target molecule is often referred to as a ligand. Ligand molecules occupy progressively more target binding sites as ligand concentrations increases until essentially all of the available sites are occupied. This tendency of a ligand to bind to its target is measured by the dissociation constant, Kd\n\nKd = [R][L]/[RL]\n\nwhere [R] is the concentration of the free receptor, [L] is the concentration of the free ligand, and [RL] is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex. The dissociation constant value is a measure of the strength of the interaction between the drug candidate and the target; the lower the value, the stronger the interaction. The concentration of free ligand at which one-half of the binding sites are occupied equals the dissociation constant, as long as the concentration of binding sites is substantially less than the dissociation constant.\n\nHowever, sometimes in the cases of biological assays where drug candidates are utilized on living cells or tissues, an alternative method is used to determine the potency of a drug. In these cases, the EC50 concentration is measured. This is the concentration of the drug candidate required to elicit 50% of the maximal biological response. For drug candidates that are inhibitors (ex. sodium channel blockers), the term IC50 is used to describe the concentration of the inhibitor required to reduce a response to 50% of its value in the absence of inhibitor.\n\nIC50 = Ki(1 + [S]/KM)\n\n(Ki is known as the inhibition constant; KM is the Michaelis constant for the substrate S. The higher the concentration of the natural substrate, the higher the concentration of drug needed to inhibit the enzyme to a given extent.\n\nIC50 and EC50 values are important measures of potency of a drug candidate in evaluating the activity of the desired biological target. Oftentimes a drug target is a member of a large family of proteins that similar in nature, which can be extremely challenging when developing a target drug.\n\nIn addition to the ability of molecules to act on specific target molecules, an effective drug must also have other characteristics. For example, it must be easily administered and reach its target at sufficient concentration to be effective, a drug molecule encounters a variety of obstacles on its way to its target. The following properties are the four basic stages of a medicine's life in the body:\n\n1. Absorption\n\n2. Distribution\n\n3. Metabolism\n\n4. Excretion\n\nDrugs can be taken orally as a small tablet and must be able to survive the acidic conditions in the gut and then be absorbed through the intestinal epithelium. A few of the most common ways to administer drugs are oral (swallowing an aspirin tablet), intramuscular (getting a flu shot in an arm muscle), subcutaneous (an injection of insulin under the skin), intravenous (receiving chemotherapy through a vein), or transdermal (wearing a skin patch). Drugs face a great deal of hurdles during absorption, because of the liver and the great deal of variability in drug administration in the human body. There are a set of rules that tells us when poor absorption is likely:\n\n1. molecular weight is >500 g/mol\n\n2. number of hydrogen bond donors is greater than 5\n\n3. number of hydrogen bond acceptors is greater than 10\n\n4. partition coefficient is greater than 5 (way to measure the tendency of a molecule to dissolve cell membranes)\n\nThe challenge with the liver is that the liver will filter most of the drugs away before it will reach the bloodstream. Metabolic enzymes would break down the drug rendering it useless. This would lead to most of the drugs not reaching the target organs, or not having any effect. In order to bypass this, the many different absorption methods are introduced.(2)\n\nOnce a drug is absorbed, the next stage is the distribution of the drug. Most often, the bloodstream is the primary means of transportation for drugs. Once the drug reaches the bloodstream, it is distributed to different fluids and tissues. This is the step that leads to a wide array of side effects in organs throughout the body. However it is important to note that some organs have stronger defense systems than others. For example, the central nervous system has a strong blood brain barrier that protects the brain from dangerous poisons or viruses.\n\nAnother challenge during the distribution of the drug throughout the body is its attachment to other molecules besides the receptors of the target organ. Drugs could react with compounds present in the blood of the patient and could end up rendering the drug useless, or could produce unwanted side effects. Also, because the compound is spread all over the body, non-target organs with specialized cells and unique receptors could end up reacting and attaching to the drug. If the drug attaches to a receptor and activates, or activates a function of the cell, it could lead to unwanted side effects that could be potentially harmful or fatal.(2)\n\nAfter a drug has been distributed throughout the body and has done its job, the medicine is broken down or metabolized. The metabolism generally occurs in the liver. The liver is the site of continuous yet controlled activity. Everything that enters the bloodstream is carried straight to the intestine. In the intestine, molecules and substances are chemically and physically metabolized.\n\nOnce a drug is absorbed and carries out its specific biological tasks, it must be converted into a substance that can be physically excreted. The liver detoxifies the drug's components using chemical metabolites, which then exits via the urine or feces.\n\n1. Berg J, Tymoczko J, Lubert S: Biochemistry, 7th Edition\n\n2.

Drug Development Challenges. Pharma. <http://www.pharmafocusasia.com/strategy/drug_development_challenges.htm> 3. Medicine by Design National Institute of Health\n\nOsteoporosis is a bone disease that can lead to fractures and deteriorating. Bisphosphonate, also known as Diphosphonate are drugs known for treating and reducing the risk of contracting the illness. It is one of the key elements used by chemist as a pathway to finding the drugs for Osteoporosis. Bisphosphonate has the ability to bind with a naturally occurring mineral called Hydroxylapatite, that can make up 70% of bone. Alendronate (Fosamax), ibandronate (Boniva), risedronate (Actonel), and zoledronic acid (Reclast) are three examples of drugs used to treat osteoperosis.\n\nThe bisphosphonates are synthetic compounds that have been used as water softeners in canals and irrigation systems since the mid-nineteenth century. Their efficiency in treating osteoporosis can be ascribed to the alignment of biological and physicochemical properties of the compound. Bisphosphonates have impressive layers of cellular selectivity, which compose long-acting drugs that inhibit the resorption of bone by osteoclasts safely. After binding with Hydroxylapatite on the bone surface, approximately 50% of bisphosphonates will stick there and the half-life of bone-bound alendronate is estimated to be around 10 years. The dose of drugs that do not stick around will be excreted rapidly, and bisphosphonates' low cell permeability will minimize their exposure to other tissues, which in terms lower the probability of having side effects. This property of essential targeting to bone is very useful for the subsequent cellular activities in treating osteoporosis. During bone resorption, osteeoclasts are attached to bisphosphonates and hence will not be able to resorb bones.\n\n[2]\n\nInfluenza viruses, also referred to as the flu is a disease that is more severe that a normal cold and is highly contagious. The virus can be transferred through air, cough, sneeze, as well as direct contact. It affects all age group, but young children have a tendency to catch the disease more than adults. It is a seasonal disease that spread around the world and kill thousands and thousands of people each year. In the case of the influenza target neuraminidinase, crystallographic analyses of N2 and type B neuraminidases have been essential to understanding how activesite plasticity affects the emergence of distinct resistant variants to the current commercial drugs, zanamivir (Relenza®) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu®). Zanamivir, the first drug on the market (10), shows poor oral bioavailability (2%), likely reflecting its zwitterionic character at physiological pH (11). Oral inhalation is required. In the case of oseltamivir (12), the carboxylate is an ethyl ester prodrug, thereby rendering the molecule cationic, which enhances oral absorption (75%). The required carboxylate is generated in the host by enzymatic hydrolysis (13). In addition, the guanidinium group of zanamivir is simplified to an amino group, and the glycerol moiety is redesigned in oseltamivir to a hydrophobic ether, which results in a different enzyme conformation upon binding. This modification may be problematic in the emergence of resistance to oseltamivir.\n\nOsteoporosis: The company Biota discovered Zanamivir, a drug made help bone conditions such as Osteoporosis and similar diseases. Of its kind, it was the first commercial drug on the market to serve as patients with bone diseases, but unfortunately, it was proven to have low effectiveness due to its poor bioavailability of 2%. The human body was unable to fully absorb the dosage because of Zanamivir's zwitterionic character.\n\nBiota should be looking into developing an ester of zanamivir to increase its oral bioavailability, but it did not do so for good reasons. During Biota's discovery of this drug, the Gilead group prepared free carboxylate and guanidinium analogs of oseltamivir, which is a prodrug. To mimick Zanamivir, the Gilead group replaced the amino group of Zanamivir with guanidinium group ultimately resulted in a loss of oral bioavailability. Therefore, the company came to the conclusion that the prodrug form of zanamivir was not more bioavailable that its original form probably because of some mitigating effect of the guanidinium group. Apparently, when it comes to producing medicines, aligning one parameter with the grand picture may negatively impact another parameter. Zanamivir was licensed to GlaxoSmithKline for final development; despite Biota or GSK's effort to make the drug more orally bioavailable, this drug was outsold by the orally active oseltamivir.\n\n[3]\n\nInfluenza: In an experiment on animals and man, inhaling doses of Zanamivir is an effective treatment for influenza. Although Zanamivir is and ester prodrug, if taken orally, the medicine will not successfully distribute through out the body and therefore, will not fight against the infectious disease. Due to this matter, many attempts have been made to better the pharmacological properties of Zanamivir by changing the structure of the compound.\n\nOsteoporosis: Following the discovery of Zanamivir, to improve bone diseases, Gilead group generated a drug called Oseltamivir. This new medicine serves the same purpose as Zanamivir but it was highly effective and it outsold Zanamivir by 3 to 1. This drug was more successful than Zanamivir because its carboxylate is an ethyl ester prodrug, in which enhancing the molecule to be cationic, and therefore, an increase in oral absorption (75%).\n\nInfluenza: By looking to improve the oral intake of Zanamivir, researchers redesigned the structural compound of pyran by removing carboxylic acid, and changing it into a carbocyclic scaffold, in which discovered an active antiviral product (Oseltamivir) that targets influenza viruses and can be taken orally. Overall, Statistics shows that in Japan, Oseltamivir was more commonly used, roughly 90 times more than Zanamivir.\n\nKozarich, John W. \"The Biochemistry of Diseases: Desperately Seeking Syzygy.\" Annu.

This requirement is particularly true for drug candidates that are to be taken by people who are relatively healthy. The trials test the effectiveness and potential side effects of a candidate drug before it is approved by the FDA for general use.\n\nClincial trials proceed in at least three phases.\n\nPhase 1: In phase 1, a small number (10-100) of healthy volunteers take the drug for an initial study of safety. These volunteers are given a range of doses and are monitored for signs of toxicity.\n\nPhase 2: In phase 2, the efficacy of the drug candidate is tested in a small number of persons who might potentially benefit from the drug. Further data regarding the drug's safety are obtained. Such trials are often controlled and double-blinded.\n\nPhase 3: In phase 3, similar studies are performed on a larger population (thousands). This phase firmly establishes the efficacy of the drug candidate and to detect side effects that may eventually develop in a small percentage of the subjects who receive treatment.\n\nOnly after the conclusion of all three phases can a drug be approved for clinical use by the public.\n\nClinical studies are designed to add medical knowledge related to treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of diseases or conditions. Some common reasons for conducting clinical studies include:\n\nEvaluating one or more interventions for treating a disease, syndrome, or condition\n\nFinding ways to prevent the initial development/recurrence of a disease or condition\n\nExamining methods for identifying a condition or risk factors for that condition\n\nExploring ways to improve the comfort and quality of life of people with a chronic illness through supportive care\n\nClinical Trials are usually led by a principal investigator, who is often a medical doctor. Clinical studies have a research team that may include doctors, nurses, social workers, and other health care professionals. Clinical studies can take place in many locations, including hospitals, universities, doctors' offices, and community clinics. The location depends on who is conducting the study.\n\nControlled studies involve a group of individuals given a placebo and a second group that is given the actual drug. These studies also tend to be double-blinded, so that neither the subjects nor the researchers know which subjects are in the treatment group and which are in the control group. This approach prevents bias in the course of the trial. After the completion of the trial, the assignments of the subjects are unsealed and the results for the two groups are compared. A variety of doses are often investigated in phase 2 trials to determine which doses appear to be free of serious side effects and which does appear to be effective.\n\nClinical trials tend to be extremely expensive. Costs can run from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. Extensive records and documentations are filed and subsequently compiled for submission to the FDA. The full cost of developing a drug is currently estimated to be from $400 - $800 million dollars.\n\nAccording to one study, it takes an estimated 15 years for a drug to go from lab to patient.\n\n1.

Also known as the Comprehensive Drug Abused Prevention and Control Act of 1970, the CSA is administered under the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which investigates the illegal production of controlled substances on an interstate and international level. [1]\n\nUnder Section 812 of the CSA, the controlled substances are divided into five schedules. Each controlled substances is placed under Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V based on its potential for abuse, accepted medical treatment and safety within the United States, and its likelihood of causing physical and psychological dependence.\n\nThe drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.\n\nThe drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\n\nThere is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.[2]\n\nPrescriptions for Schedule I drugs are not accepted anywhere in the United States.\n\nSome examples of Schedule I drugs include heroin, cannabis, Ecstasy, and LSD. These drugs contain hallucinogenic substances, opiates such as acetylmethadol, or any opiate derivatives including its isomers, esters, salts, or other chemical combination.

In California, schedule II prescriptions must be on a new, tamper-resistant prescription form, and are not allowed to have refills on them. Typically these prescriptions are written for a thirty days supply. [5]\n\nSome examples of Schedule II narcotics include oxycodone, amphetamine salts, and methylphenidate. Better known brand name drugs include OxyContin, Percocet, Adderall, and Ritalin.

These drugs contain some compound or mixture of depressants, methylphenidate, and narcotic drug. Although there are some Schedule II drugs mixed into Schedule III narcotics, the DEA allows up to 1.8 milligrams of codeine per 100 milliliters. Some other regulations include a maximum of 500 milligrams of opium per 100 milliliters, and a maximum of 50 milligrams of morphine per 100 milliliters compound.[7]\n\nThe drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.\n\nThe drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.\n\nAbuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III.

However, there is a limited quantity of the active narcotic drug that is allowed within the compound. For example, only 100 milligrams of opium per 100 milliliters can a mixture contain.[11]\n\nA natural product is a chemical substance produced by a living organism. It is found in nature and has biological effects that can be studied in order to support drug discovery and drug design. A substance is considered a natural product even if it can be prepared by total synthesis. [12]\n\nSources of natural products are plants, bacteria, marine environments, and animal venoms.\n\nCoprophiles are organisms that specifically thrive in animal dung. These territorial species spit out toxic chemicals to its neighboring fungi. Scientists and researchers allocate this information and specifically search for chemicals that are rather poisonous to some fungi and can be potentially dangerous to people that are infected.\n\nCyanobacteria are plant-like organisms that live in both wet and damp environmental conditions. These species have been proven to become sources of cancer and bacterial cell killers. For example, the compound cryptophycin-8 can tear apart the scaffolding in a spectrum of tumors. Another molecule called majusculamide C focuses in on fungi, potentially allowing it to be used to treat fungi-related diseases in humans.\n\nFilter feeders are organisms that stick to rocks and coral. These species compete with others for food and other natural resources. Scientists and researchers have discovered that some of these potent chemicals can be used in the long run to treat cancer and other fatal diseases.\n\nUltimately, these natural products have been scientifically utilized to create both a wanted and an unwanted effect. In short, many of these chemicals show a promising future in the field of medicine.[13]\n\nCyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, are plant-like organisms that live in both wet and damp environmental conditions. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms that can create energy from sunlight. These microorganisms can be found in colonies called algal bloom, and have dated back to the oldest fossils on earth. They make up one of the largest groups of bacteria in the world, and are linked to many human and animal diseases. Blooms will form when there is extravagant growth of the bacteria within a few days time. These algal blooms will cause clear water to become cloudy looking. Cyanobacterial blooms are dangerous because they can use up all of the oxygen present in the water they grow in, which will kill the other plants and animals living there. Some cyanobacteria even produce some of the most powerful natural poisons known, with no antidotes.\n\nHowever, these species have been proven to become sources of cancer and bacterial cell killers. For example, the compound cryptophycin-8 can tear apart the scaffolding in a spectrum of tumors. Another molecule called majusculamide C focuses in on fungi, potentially allowing it to be used to treat fungi-related diseases in humans.\n\nFilter feeders are organisms that stick to rocks and coral. These species compete with others for food and other natural resources. Filter feeders use an aquatic feeding method for getting their food. Scientists and researchers have discovered that some of the potent chemicals found in filter feeders can be used in the long run to treat cancer and other fatal diseases.\n\nFilter feeders include the sea sponge, which is the simplest of multi-cellular animals. Sea sponges produce a great array of toxins, which they either release into the water or show on their surfaces. These toxins will ward off any predators that would feed on the sponges. Symptoms of being in contact with these toxins include: redness at the site of contact, pain, tingling, itching, swelling, bumps, nausea, or even fainting.\n\nDespite their toxicity, sea sponges have proved to show great promise in the area of fighting infectious diseases and cancers. Scientists have been able to extract anti-viral, anti-cancer, and anti-neoplastic compounds from sea sponges to create many drugs. For example, in the 1950's chemists used sponge compounds to create a drug for treating Herpes called Acyclovir (Zovirax), and a drug to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma called Cytarabine (Cytosar). [14]\n\nUltimately, all of these natural products have been scientifically utilized to create both a wanted and an unwanted effect. In short, many of these chemicals show a promising future in the field of medicine.\n\nTunicates lie under the category of filter feeders that are greatly contributing to the medicinal research of cancer drugs. Also known as sea squirts, tunicates look merely like little colorful blobs but offer much to the pharmaceutical world than one would expect. For example, in the West Indie coral reefs, a tunicate named Ecteinascidia turbinata contributes to the fight of cancer. This marine animal, as discovered by Ken Rinehart from the University of Illinois, harbors the natural substance ecteinascidin used to make the cancer drug named Yondelis™. Although this medicine is still in its preliminary stage and further research needs to be done, lab tests have already confirmed that it can kill cancer cells and is suitable for human intake.\n\nRecently, Elias J. Corey from Harvard University has discovered the way to synthesize ecteinascidin in the labs. This is important because to produce one gram of medicine, more than one ton of tunicates need to be harvested; a clearly ineffective process. With the ability to synthesize the natural product of interest, scientists are catalyzing the advancement of utilizing natural products to produce effective medications to cure diseases. [15]\n\nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, </ref>]] Taxol is a drug used in the treatment of cancer. It is derived from the bark and needles of a tree called the Pacific Yew (Taxus brevifolia), which dies when taxol is extracted. On the downside, although it is one of the most useful drugs in fighting cancer, a small sample of taxol is produced from a large quantity of Yew barks (about 1200 kg of bark produces 10 g of pure taxol). Because of the negative impact the production of this drug has on the environment, the creation of taxol raises concerns over the ecological effects on the yew population.\n\nTaxol works by preventing cancer cells from replicating. It does so by binding to the microtubules during cell division by preventing them from breaking down. Because in microtubules are normally disassembled after the cell divides, the presence of microtubules prevents the cell from dividing into daughter cells. [16]\n\nEpibatidine is a molecule found on the skin of a species of Ecuadorian frog (Epipedobates tricolor) that has an analgesic effect, meaning that it is an effective painkiller. Although studies have proven Epibatidine to be a more effective painkiller than morphine, Epibatidine is poisonous and small doses of it can kill a large organism. Because of this, Epibatidine is unlikely to be available for the medicine market.\n\nEpibatidine works by binding the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) binding sites. When nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are bound by neurotransmitters, it releases dopamine and norepinephrine, which causes the organism to be insensitive to pain. [17]\n\nClostridium botulinum is a bacterium that produces a type of toxins called neurotoxins, which are responsible for food poisoning. In the late 1960s, scientist Alan Scott tested botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in monkeys and discovered that BTX-A can be used to treat strabismus (a condition which the eyes are not aligned with one another).\n\nA more well-known use for the botulinum toxin is its ability to reduce wrinkles and frown lines when injected into the skin. Many celebrities undergo botox (short term for botulinum toxin) to smooth out their facial skin. [18]\n\nExplain how drugs interact with the cell membrane and the membranes structural characteristics relevant to drugs interaction\n\nMany drugs need to pass through one or more cell membranes to reach their site of action. A common feature of all cell membranes is a phospholipid bilayer, about 10 nm thick. Spanning this bilayer or attached to the outer or inner leaﬂets are glycoproteins, which may act as ion channels, receptors, intermediate messengers (G-proteins) or enzymes. Cells obtain molecules and ions from the extracellular fluid, creating a constant in and out flow. The interesting thing about cell membranes is that relative concentrations and phospholipid bilayers prevent essential ions from entering the cell. Therefore in order for drugs to move across the membrane these problems must be addressed. In general, this is completed by facilitated diffusion or active transport. In facilitated diffusion, relative concentrations are used to transport in and out. Active transports uses energy (ATP) to transfer molecules and ions in and out of the cell.[1]\n\nCellular signals cross the membrane through a process called signal transduction. This three-step process proceeds when a specific message encounters the outside surface of the cell and makes direct contact with a receptor. A receptor is a specialized molecule that takes information from the environment and passes it throughout various parts of the cell. Next, a connecting switch molecule, transducer, passes the message inward, closer to the cell. Finally, the signal gets amplified, therefore causing the cell to perform a specific function. These functions can include moving, producing more proteins, or even sending out more signals.[2]\n\nThe most common method for drugs to cross the cell membrane is by Passive Diffusion. Drug molecules will diffuse down its concentration gradient without expenditure of energy by the cell. However, the membranes are selectively permeable, so it has different effects on the rate of diffusion on different drug molecules. The rate of diffusion also can be enhancing by transport proteins in the membrane by Facilitated Diffusion. There are two types of transport proteins that carry out the facilitated diffusion, Channel protein and Carrier Protein. [3]\n\nActive transport is an energy-requiring process. The drug molecule, transport against the a concentration gradient, and most of the protein used are carrier proteins, rather than channel proteins. There are also two type of active transport\n\nPrimary active transport which directly uses energy to transport molecules across a membrane.Sometime the carrier protein can be an electrogenic pump. [4]\n\nIn secondary active transport or Co-transport also uses energy to transport molecules across a membrane. However, It differs from primary transport is that there is no direct coupling of Adenosine triphosphate|ATP; instead, the electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions out of the cell is used. [5]\n\nMDR stands for Multidrug‐ resistance, and describes large integral protein pumps located in the cell‐surface membranes of most living organisms. The main purpose they serve are to monitor chemicals passing through the cell membrane and eject ones that might endanger the well being of the cell. Normally they are beneficial to the cell's growth, but when growth is unwanted, i.e. in case of a bacterial infection or spreading cancer cells, MDR pumps become a problem. MDR pumps provide the ability to adapt and defend cells against some types of antibiotics. Cells employ the use of MDR pumps for protection against their environments, and researchers need to not only synthesize antibiotics that affect a targeted cell but they need to be able to cross the cell's defenses. The MDR pumps are activated by using packets of energy called ATP to force out unwanted toxins.\n\nMDR pumps are found throughout the human body, including the brain, digestive tract, liver, and kidneys. These pumps carry out specific functions in the human body such as transporting molecules like hormones into and out of cells.\n\nResearchers suggest that plants have evolved over time to produce chemicals that block MDR pumps, essentially having the same effect as what antibiotics need to have. This theory was tested by knocking out the MDR pump gene from a specific bacterial cell (Staphylococcus aureus). The bacteria was then exposed to the antibiotic berberine extracted from berberine berries. Berberine has proven to be typically ineffective in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. However, it was extremely effective against the genetically modified bacteria without the MDR pump. The bacteria were also killed in the presence of the berberine when also exposed to a berberine extract that was believed to inhibit bacterial MDR pumps.\n\nMDR pumps are Multidrug‐ resistance pumps that are large proteins in cell‐surface membranes of microorganisms.They are used to monitor incoming chemicals and spit out ones that might endanger the bacteria.The gate must be opened for the pump to work.With the pump open, it can take up the drug.The pump's cytoplasmic gate closes, allowing the drug to be pumped out of the cell.\n\nMDR pump can bestow deadly power-in the form resistance to antibiotics-to tiny organisms which is a bacteria. While bacteria MDR genes are not identical to those, the three-dimensional shape of all pumps is the same, they perform a similar task: preventing harmful molecules from setting up the cell's interior. Many MDR pumps confer resistance against first time used to treat pathogenic yeast and parasites. Resistance to drugs called antifungals that are used to treat yeast infections is increasing rapidly, affecting immunecrippled AIDS patient. MDR is saquinavir, a class of anti-AIDS frugs, called protease inhibitors. MDR pumps might also transport \"normal\" substances. In mammals, MDR pumps are positioned to encounter potentially harmful substances face to face in the intestine.\n\nResearchers are focusing on fighting cancer through the use of MDR pumps. Stem cells, which are those cells that have yet to be differentiated, have minimal MDR pumps in their membranes. Because of this, these stem cells are extremely sensitive to cancer-killing drugs. A specific major drawback to chemotherapy is bone marrow toxicity, which leaves the human body defenseless against deadly infections. Scientists and researchers devised a method to attach the defenseless stem cells with MDR pumps. In doing so, the stem cells can possibly stand a chance to the chemotherapy required to kill tumors in the human body. [1]\n\nRecent discovery by a pharmacologist Mary Vore of the University of Kentucky in Lexington shows that MDR pump will not work properly while the woman is pregnant. Basically, the MDR pump is malformed in pregnant women who have ICP, Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy, which can endanger the growing fetus. The suggested reasons for this are the effect of estrogen and other pregnancy hormones during pregnancy.\n\nFile:Mdr pump.jpg Scientists and researchers believe that medicines produce an effect for less than half of those who take it. This is partly due to lifestyle and environmental factors, but it is primarily the result of genetic variants. The genes that make cytochrome P450 proteins are responsible for a medicinal effect in the body. These proteins metabolize hormones that our body produces and those that are foreign. Because every human consists of a different genomic sequence, the proteins that genes encode for also differ. This genetic variant can affect the way in which cytochrome P450 reacts and how the drug elicits an effect. Ultimately, the cytochrome P450 proteins process many of the drugs we take, therefore explaining the different responses to medicine between individuals. [2]\n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/DoseResponse.png\n\nThe above picture is the Dose-Response curve that tells how much a drug (x-axis) causes effect in the body (y-axis). The region in between the blue and green curve is the desired effect and the region on the right side of the green curve is the side effect. Scientists study the relationship between the medicine and its effect on human body. Like how the image is showing, at first there is no effect when no drug is put in. The researcher then adds more drug into the system to see the effect on the body. If too much drug is taken, the body will reach its overdosing point and may face side effects. This image demonstrates the right amount of dose researchers are looking for while working with a drug. [3]\n\nBerg, Jeremy M., ed. (2002), Biochemistry (6th ed.) New York City, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company\n\nDavis, Alison Davis. Medicines By Design. The Office of Communications and Public Liaison. 2006.\n\nThe influenza virus is the main culprit of respiratory infection more commonly known as the \"flu\". The structure of the influenza virus includes a nucleoprotein (RNA) center enclosed in capsid, a lipid envelope, and spikes of two key proteins on its surface: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. About 80% of the spikes consist of hemagglutinin. The function of hemagglutinin is to bind the virus with the host cell. It acts as to stick the virus onto the host cell in order to cause an infection. The other protein, called neuraminidase, cover the rest of the surface. The lesser amount of neuraminidase doesn't account for its large role, however. Neuraminidase helps facilitate the release of the newly formed viral molecules from the host cell. In perspective, hemagglutinin is the anchor that binds the virus to the host cell and neuraminidase is the trigger that induces a viral infection. Since neuraminidase is so important for influenza virus, scientists have developed methods to inhibit the protein and prevent influenza virus from infecting the host cell.\n\nStructural based design has been one of the primary methods in the design of a drug. With the use of two key techniques, X-Ray Crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), they have aided in the determination of a molecule’s structure. Such information as the three-dimensional structure of a specific target, helps direct drug creation because with structure based design, it allows one to observe the interaction between the target and the drug.\n\nRecently, studies have shown a positive correlation between the similarity in drug and its target’s natural ligands to the increased barrier to resistance. In other words, the design of a drug needs to take into account that similarity, both physically and chemically, to the target’s natural ligands will make it more difficult for said disease and target to become resistant.\n\nThe discovery of neuraminidase inhibitors for the Influenza virus is one of the early examples of structure based drug design. The target of the Influenza drug is based on the virus’s neuraminidase enzyme. This enzyme’s role is to free the progeny of the virus in order to spread and infect other cells within the body. The neuraminidase inhibitors were created based on crystal structure data of the virus’s neuraminidase. What the neuraminidase inhibitor does is it chemically destroys the virus’s receptors thereby stopping virus replication. Neuraminidase inhibitors must be taken within 48 hours that symptoms arise. They do not ‘kill’ the flu virus, but merely slow down the virus replication to a point where the immune system can destroy it easier. As a result, they can reduce the severity and duration of a flu illness.\n\nThe spread of the flu virus is slowed in the body by the following steps: (1) The virus enters a cell with neuraminidase inhibitors present. (2) Once inside the cell, the neuraminidase inhibitors attach to the virus. (3) The flu virus can still use its host to replicate itself. (4) However, the inhibitors prevent the virus from leaving the cell—which halts the infection of other cells. (5)The virus is rendered ineffective and dies within the cell.\n\nCurrently, ten neuraminidases enzymes have been discovered and their structures determined: N1-N9 for Influenza A and type B neuraminidase for type B Influenza. Four approved drugs that have been administered for public use are zanamivir, oseltamivir, amantadine, and rimantadine.\n\nZanamivir, oseltamivir, amantadine, and rimantadine are different in the types of influenza viruses they inhibit, route of administration, and approved use in age groups. However, the side effects and cost of zanamivir and oseltamivir vary from those of amantadine and rimantadine. Side effects, including nervousness, anxiety, concentration difficulty, and lightheadedness, have been reported to be less frequent in patients who take zanamivir and oseltamivir. In addition, zanamivir and oseltamivir are more expensive than rimatadine, which is more expensive than amantadine. While amantadine and rimantadine are drugs that have both been used extensively for treatment of influenza A, zanamivir and oseltamivir are new alternatives. Unlike zanamivir and oseltamivir, amantadine and rimantadine are chemically related antiviral drugs that act against influenza A viruses but not influenza B viruses. However, these antiviral agents for influenza are not a substitute for vaccine, but instead are a supplement.\n\nExperiments have discovered that these two drugs have different resistances based on their method of intake and their binding affinity to the target. Oseltamivir is taken orally as a tablet whereas Zanamivir is taken as an inhalant. Oseltamivir is a prodrug, which means that it is inactive until it is taken within the body. Both drugs have been found that they work better according to those aforementioned methods. As for the inhibitors, amino or guandino groups have replaced the C4-hydroxyl groups of the neuraminidase enzymes. Changing the substituents optimize the binding potency both chemically and physically. According to Dr. Colman, “The loss of inhibitory potency toward neuraminidase…. zanamivir, and oseltamivir carboxylate, is greater the less the inhibitor resembles the substrate.” [4]\n\nMore studies have shown substantial evidence that support the hypothesis that drugs that resemble the target’s natural substrate and ligands are more successful at suppressing the possibility of drug-resistance. In fact, viruses need to be able to bind to its own substrates and to be able to distinguish against that of the drug. If drugs resemble the virus’s own substrates, it will be difficult for it to discriminate and therefore, become less resistant. In addition, this is why multi-drugs and multi-dosages are prescribed. Using “drug cocktails,” dosages, and routes of administration will result in better outcomes.\n\nTwo important proteins on the surface of influenza virus cells are lectin hemagglutinin protein and enzyme sialidase. Lectin hemagglutinin has 3 shallow sialic acid-binding sites while enzyme sialidase has an active site in a pocket. The deep active site of low molecular weight inhibitors makes sialidase the more attractive anti-influenza drug target than hemagglutinin.\n\nInfluenza virus binds to sialic residues. Because of this, viruses gain entry into the host cell by adhering to the surface of carbohydrates. The viral protein that binds to sugars is called hemagglutinin. Once the virus penetrates the cell membrane, a viral protein called neuraminidase cleaves the glycosidic bonds of the sialic acid residues, freeing the virus to infect the host cell. Neuraminidase inhibitors are analogues of sialic acid that block the active site of neuraminidase and leave uncleaved sialic acid residues on the surface of host cells and influenza viral envelopes. Viral hemaggluttin binds to the uncleaved sialic residues, reducing the spread of infection to other cells.\n\nColman, Peter M. \"New Antivirals and Drug Resistance\", 'Annual Review of Biochemistry', 2009.\n\nAlprazolam (also known as Xanax) is a psychoactive drug used to treat anxiety disorders along with panic disorders. It is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines and how it works is it decreases abnormal excitement in the brain. Alprazolam can come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can come as a tablet, an extended-release tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet, and it is also available in a liquid form. Alprazolam is used to treat anxiety disorders and panic disorders (sudden and unexpected attacks of extreme fear and uneasiness about these thoughts). Alprazolam is in a class of medication called benzodiazepines, which works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.\n\nAlprazolam is also sometimes used to treat depression, fear of open spaces (agoraphobia), and premenstrual syndrome. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\nAlprazolam is now part of Pfizer, but it was first released by Upjohn. It was covered under U.S. Patent 3,987,052, which was filed on October of 1969 and expired in September 1993. In the year 1981, Alprazolam was released. When it came out, the first approved indication was panic disordered.\n\nA young psychiatrist named David Sheehan suggested using the new distinction called DSM-III. Hence, DSM-III created in the classification of anxiety disorders between generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) and panic disorder in order to market alprazolam. In other words, this was a way for Sheehan to advertise the use of alprozolam. From his studies, Sheehen knew that panic disorder was both widespread among the populace and responsive to benzodiazepines. Therefore, he had an idea and suggested to Upjohn that marketing alproxolam for panic disorder would both cover new diagnostic territory and emphasize the unique potency of this drug. He was basically finding unique ways to show how great alprazolam is.\n\nAs his clinical study continues, Sheehen describes how the first group of patients he tested with aplprozolam say how effective this drug was. They were basically all very impressed with the action that alprozolam carries. Several months later, when the United States Food and Drug Administration approved alprozolam, alprozolam was sold out quick and they made a great profit. However, similar to many other drugs out there many published reports in the medical literature state that taking alprozolam created severe withdrawal symptoms including psychoses, seizures, and intense rebound anxiety.\n\nAlprazolam is effective in relieving moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. It is no longer the first line of defense for these attacks due to concerns of tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Doctors limited Alprazolam for a patient from 4 to 10 weeks and is only allowed to distribute the drug to those of no history of tolerance or dependence of any drug.\n\nBy taking Alprazolam while being pregnant has potential risks. It can cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period. It can also cause neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. Alprazolam are known to excreted in human milk and passed down to the infants. Alprazolam causes the infants to lose weight and become lethargic.\n\nAlprazolam is a Central Nervous System drug from the benzodiazepine class of no known mechanism of action. It is predicted to have its effects through binding to different stereo-specific receptors in the CNS. Alprazolam has also been tested to show antidepressant properties, which isn't usually a common characteristic of regular benzodiazepine derivatives.\n\nAlprazolam can cause several side effects. The most common side-effects are:\n\ndrowsiness\n\nlight-headedness\n\nheadache\n\ntiredness\n\ndizziness\n\nirritability\n\ntalkativeness\n\ndifficulty concentrating\n\ndry mouth\n\nincreased salivation\n\nchanges in sex drive or ability\n\nnausea\n\nconstipation\n\nchanges in appetite\n\nweight changes\n\ndifficulty urinating\n\njoint pain\n\nBesides these common side effects, it sometimes produces more side side effects such as:\n\nshortness of breath\n\nseizures\n\nseeing things or hearing voices that do not exist (hallucinating)\n\nsevere skin rash\n\nyellowing of the skin or eyes\n\ndepression\n\nmemory problems\n\nconfusion\n\nproblems with speech\n\nunusual changes in behavior or mood\n\nthinking about harming or killing yourself or trying to do so\n\nproblems with coordination or balance\n\nAlprazolam is metabolized via CYP3A4. Inhibitors such as fluoxetine, ketoconazole, cimetidine, nedfazodone, ritonavir, propoxyphene, erthromycin, and itraconazole are all examples of combining CYP3A4 inhibitors. These inhibitors basically delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam which create an excessive accumulation of alprazolam.\n\nThrough the concomitant administration of alprazolam tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day, Imipramine and Desipramine both have been reported to increase an average 31% and 20%. It is also known that combined oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of alproxolam. This leads to the increased of plasma levels of alprozolam and accumulation.\n\nFurthermore, herb kava and alprazolam can have a great affect between each other when combined because it can result in the development of a semi-comatose state. Hypericum is a genus of about 400 species of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae that can lower the plasma levels of alproxolam and reduce its therapeutic effect. However, looking at the big picture, alcohol is one of the most important and common interactions. This is due to the idea of combination. Alcohol and benzodiazepines such as alproxolam taken in combination have a synergistic effect on one another. Due to this reaction, it causes severe sedation, behavioral changes, and intoxication. Therefore, it is usually seen that the more alcohol and alprozolam taken, the worse the interaction will be.\n\nGeneric:(Alprazolam)\n\nOral Tablet: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg\n\nOral Tablet, Disintegrating: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg\n\nOral Tablet, Extended release: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg\n\nAlprazolam Intensol (oral solution) : 1 mg/ml\n\nNiravam: Oral Tablet, disintegrating: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg\n\nXanax: Oral Tablet: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg\n\nXanax XR: Oral Tablet, Extended release: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg\n\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a684001.html http://www.medicinenet.com/alprazolam-oral/page2.htm http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000807 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam Amsacrine\n\nAmsacrine is a potent intercalating antineoplastic agent.

It is believed to have been first used in 400 BC by the Greek physician Hippocrates who would prescribe the bark and leaves of the willow tree to his patients to relieve pain and fever. It turns out that the willow tree is rich in a substance called salicin which was later turned into salicylic acid in 1832 AD by a German chemist named Charles Gergardt. Finally in 1897 AD, Felix Hoffman, a German chemist, invented aspirin which lead to the Bayer’s release of aspirin in 1899 AD. Scientists used X-ray crystallography to determine the 3D structure of the enzyme COX (cyclooxygenase), which helped them study the shapes of the enzyme and how drugs like aspirin block it.\n\nThere are many drugs that belong to the NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug) family of medicine such as Advil, Ibuprofen, and Aleve. Each of these drugs functions in a similar manner in that they all block a family of enzymes called cyclooxygenases (abbreviated COX). These drugs block two similar enzymes known as COX-1 and COX-2. COX-2 triggers an immune response and swelling in response to infection or injury. Blocking COX-2 is desirable because it can reduce swelling, fever, pain, etc. The problem with these drugs, such as aspirin, is that they also block COX-1. COX-1 produces molecules that protect the stomach wall called prostaglandins. Blocking COX-1 therefore results in ulcers due to the gastric acid being able to digest the de-protected stomach wall. This is a significant problem with long term use of aspirin to treat diseases such as arthritis. These side effects of long term use of aspirin result in about 16,500 deaths every year in the U.S.[1]\n\nScientists wondered for many years how COX inhibitors such as aspirin worked so they used X-Ray Crystallography and other biophysical techniques to determine the three dimensional structure of the cyclooxygenases. The structure of an enzyme is important in understanding its function. Visualizing the individual enzyme’s structural folding and bends enables scientists to consider possible inhibitors that might bind to the enzyme. As the structures of COX-1 and COX-2 were being solved a new drug was found that blocks COX-2 but not COX-1, called Celebrex. The solved structures of COX-1 and COX-2 showed why only COX-2 was inhibited. In the binding site for Celebrex in COX-1, an isoleucine is present where there is a valine in COX-2. The structure of valine has a pocket-like end that is easily bound to, whereas isoleucine has an extended side chain structure that makes it impossible for the drug to bind. This allowed for the new drug to be made to bind to that specific target without the bad side effects that were caused by the COX-1 enzyme.[1]\n\nScientist have also developed another inhibitor called COX-3 inhibitors. This inhibitor appears to be more similar to Tylenol. Tylenol does not belong to the NSAID family of medicine because it is not an anti-inflammatory medicine. The future of COX-3 drugs may lead to a more significant understanding of Tylenol.\n\nOne of common method for Synthesis of Aspirin is classified as esterification reaction as followed[2]:\n\nReaction Mechanism\n\nAspirin is an antiplatelet drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase or COX. COX-2 triggers inflammation as an immune response. By blocking COX-2, aspirin acts as a potent pain killer and anti-inflammatory agent. However, COX-1 enzymes are also the key enzymes in thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generation. Thromboxane TXA2 causes platelets to clump together over the vessel tear to facilitate repair when blood vessels are damaged or are diseased. The aggregation of platelets results in a clot which stops bleeding and aids repair of the damaged blood vessel. Aspirin inhibits COX-1, therefore TXA2, thereby reducing the ability of platelets to accumulate. This is why aspirin is known as a blood thinner or anti-platelet agent.\n\nCOX-1 and COX-2 are both cyclooxygenase enzymes with similar structure but"
