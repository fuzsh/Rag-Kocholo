Seller Inventory # 3682\n\nContact seller\n\nReport this item\n\nWe are a small, single-owner business. We have been operating on and off since 1977 and our stock is varied, leaning towards antiquarian and 19th century with the addition of original aquatint and lithographic, or woodcut engravings.

We very rarely use \"fine\" or \"mint\" as a description, mainly due to the age and the fact that 99.9% of what we sell has been pre-owned and therefor Fine would not be a term for a book we sell despite its fine-like appearance. We always take items back unreservedly if not in the condition as described. We always try to describe fully.\n\nVisit Seller's Storefront\n\nSeller's business information\n\nColophon Books (UK)\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nTerms of Sale:\n\nWe guarantee the condition of every book as it's described on the AbeBooks web sites.
