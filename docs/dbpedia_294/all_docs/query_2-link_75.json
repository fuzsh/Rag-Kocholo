        "text": "Programmes kicked off at 8pm and, within a few minutes, a 70-second spot for Gibbs SR toothpaste became the first TV commercial to be screened in the UK.\n\nCreated by a 26-year-old Young & Rubicam copywriter, Brian Palmer, the commercial owes its iconic status to chance. It had won a lottery against 23 other ads - including those for Guinness, Surf, National Benzole, Brown & Polson custard and Summer County margarine - for the chance to go first.\n\nMore than half-a-century on, the ad remains etched on the collective memory - a tube of toothpaste sits embedded in a block of ice as a young woman vigorously brushes her teeth, while the beautifully enunciated tones of the TV presenter Alex Macintosh announces: \"The tingling fresh toothpaste that does your gums good too. It's tingling fresh. It's fresh as ice. It's Gibbs SR toothpaste.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, the first commercial had a difficult birth. \"We used a real block of ice for the long shots,\" Palmer remembers. \"But the ice started to melt under the studio lights. Also, the ice block steamed up, so you couldn't see the tube of toothpaste inside, which was the whole point. So we used a plastic tube for the close-ups.\"\n\nBecause its audience was small, the ad had little impact on Gibbs SR sales - but it did have churchmen, teachers, academics and politicians queuing up to condemn TV advertising as crass and vulgar.\n\nThere was no critic fiercer than the Labour MP John Wilmot, who warned the Commons that \"the nightly poison of advertising which boosts the sale of goods to the working class is against the national interest\".\n\nSafeguards put in place by the Television Advisory Committee eased public fears while the then Postmaster General, Charles Hill, assured the sceptics: \"We shall not be bothered by a violinist stopping in the middle of his solo to advise us of his favourite cigarette brand.\"\n\nTHINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW"
