        "text": "Home Smurfs Supersmurfs Playsets Houses Buildings Contact\n\nNational Benzole Smurf Campaign\n\n1978-1982\n\n1977\n\nThe negotiations for the license of the smurfs started in 20th of September 1977 with\n\nBP Netherlands( Customer), Peyo( Creator) and Schleich ( manufacturer).\n\nThe person giving this story is Dorothy Selby-Boothroyd, editor at BP Shield for a while.\n\nHere is a proof that she worked with the smurfs in London at that time.\n\nA pilot was run at 7 National Service Stations in the London Area between\n\nNovember 1977 and February 1978. Cost for each figurine was 0.36p.\n\n1978\n\nSmurf Day was set to 20th of May 1978.\n\nLaunchpack sent out in April.\n\nSo when they started they sold 10 different smurfs the large house in UK box and\n\nalso the garden playset. Then it had no number 1 on the front. You can also read\n\nthat the footballing smurf were in production and he was added during early summer 1978.\n\nHere is a picture of how it could look on the shelves on the launch day.\n\nI made a large closeup because you can see that the new Schleich Smurfette\n\nmade in 1977 was also sold in UK. Gardener, Mechanic, Guitar, Normal, Spy,\n\nDrummer, Smurfette, Astro and Brainy on the mid shelf. Papa was also sold.\n\nNames used by National is on the pictures above. Soccer got the name Striker.\n\nFor the holiday( July) 1978 they got new figurines. Striker was already added then.\n\nIn summer 1978 you could also buy a \"Showdrome\" for the special price Â£29.50.\n\nFor the winter new items were possible to get. Orders were possible in end of october.\n\nSo at the end of 1978 you could have a display with all smurfs sold looking like this.\n\nOne thing you could notice is that 30 smurfs had been released but only 29 are on the shelf.\n\nThis is because the Gardening smurf was removed when he bacame a Super Gardener Smurf instead.\n\nAlso both yellow scarf on Chimney and Sledder was made in late 1978. Probably sold\n\nlike that from the beginning. Notice also that the Postman with the Christmas envelope was the\n\nfirst version in the UK.\n\nCoin Smurf was also made for National in late 1978 in a limited edition campaign. They called\n\nhim Saver Smurf. But the promotion was pulled before it was allowed to hit the shops.\n\n1979\n\nThe year 1979 starts with the Valentine smurf. It is the Postman with a heart on the envelope.\n\nMarch gives you National Attendant with pump.\n\nMarch 1979 advert. Notice the attendant and valentine.\n\nApril gave us the 6 UK Strikers made for the FA Cup 1979.\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly was Angeling Smurf for the course fishing season.\n\nThe Super Motoring Smurf was sold in August.\n\nSo in the end of Summer 1979 the poster looked like this.\n\nHere is a picture with all smurfs on the poster except swimmer and motoring smurf.\n\nIn summer 1979 you could also get a lot of other smurf items.\n\nFirst time Brainy with yellow glasses is shown. :)\n\nRed Ball Striker\n\nCloseup on shop.\n\nLots of other smurf items in this catalogue, but will continue with the PVC smurfs. :)\n\nSome store pictures in closeup so not the best quality.\n\nSecond half of 1979 gave us these smurfs.\n\n1980\n\nBefore 1980 only no smurfs made of Bully molds were sold in the UK.\n\nAll smurfs made for the UK were made by Schleich.\n\nHere is an article from early 1980 when they had around 40 figurines for sale.\n\nNational promissed 21 new smurfs for 1980 including the 10 sport supersmurfs for the Oilympics.\n\nHere is how the plan was for 1980.\n\nJanuary gave us the Doctor.\n\nThis also came in Spring 1980.\n\nAnd before the summer the oilympic sportsmurfs and torchbearer was sold.\n\nHere the oilympicstadium in colour. Not 100% correct boxes and smurfs though. :)\n\nOnly one more supersmurf was added in 1980. Hobby Horse in Octorber.\n\nOnly one more regular smurf was added in summer 1980. It was Cricket Smurf. Record says April?\n\nCould be correct with April. Found this picture stored. :)\n\nHere is a poster for late 1980. 40 regular smurfs were possible to get.\n\nThis is the only poster I have seen with UK emblem Torch. Or Olympic as National called him.\n\nLast 5 though were sold in January 1981. And these were the supers on that poster.\n\n1981\n\nDuring 1981 the smurfs made from Bullymolds got to the UK.\n\nIn January the Five Nation Rugby Smurfs were made for the start of the Rugby season. And these 3.\n\nPierre sent me a picture of the Rugby Poster. Super nice. :)\n\nWe still do not know exactly which teams were sold in this campaign until we find the advertisment. :(\n\nShould be these 6, the All Black was also sold in UK.\n\nIn Spring 1981 thirteen new smurfs were added to the smurf line.\n\n4 new super smurfs were sold during 1981.\n\nWindsurfer( Spring), Photographer, Fireman( Summer) and Go-Kart( Autumn).\n\nAfter the 12 new regular smurfs sold during Spring 1981, another 12 new ones were sold.\n\nFirst 6 during the summer and last 6 in Autumn( the OCT ones).\n\nSo by the end of 1981 you could buy all these smurfs.\n\n1982\n\nThese could have been very late 1981 smurfs but most likely the first ones sold in 1982.\n\nNew ones for April\n\nAdvertisment for these.\n\nIn June 1982 Coronet took over the distribution of smurf figurines from Schleich in the UK.\n\nAlready after the Oilympics in 1980 they had been involved in the Schleich smurfs.\n\nAnd you can see their name on the leaflets from 1980 on.\n\nIn summer 1982 these came.\n\nThese were the last smurfs sold under the BP license and in the BP boxes.\n\nAfter these smurfs were sold Coronet took over and BP And National Benzole\n\nhad nothing to do with the smurf license anymore afaik.\n\nNote that Coronet had been appointed sole distributor of smurf figurines and Schleich items!!\n\nYou can also read that Coronet supplied the new Smurf and Super Smurf\n\nCollectors Centres. Same as W Berrie used in the US.\n\n1983\n\nAfter 1982 Schleich made no special BP boxes anymore. Coronet basicly sold everything that\n\nwas in the Schleich catalogues, as other countries, to the toystores.\n\nIn 1984 they made these great cards with the old large Smurf on the front.\n\nAlmost like the BP boxes. Maureen has one of these cards. Not sure if the pictures\n\nare from the auction or from Maureen. Thanks anyway Maureen!! :)\n\nThe only UK National Super Smurfs in boxes you can get are these."
