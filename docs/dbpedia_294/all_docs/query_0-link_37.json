In the 1920's, even before the onset of the Speculative Embroglio, security prices behaved counter to the course of both industrial production fluctuations and commodity prices. Again, in the SEC de-manipulated markets of the mid-30's, the great bull market of 1935-37 had little foundation in either general business conditions or the trends of particular industries. During the first quarter of 1936, in the face of a decline of 27% in industrial production, the common stock averages rose by 8%.

So long it operates in the shadow of Federal regula¬ tion of natural gas production, the petroleum industry and other competitive industries face a more serious threat as which endangers the nation's historic economic of free enterprise. That threat is that Federal system control will be extended tive eventually to all other competi¬ industries. The only solution to this problem is the enactment of Congressional legislation which will clearly exempt in¬ dependent gas producers and gatherers from Federal regulation in language which no one can misinterpret. Another major industry problem is posed by continued excessive importation of crude oil. Throughout the year, the spotlight was on the need to adjust imports to levels that would not discourage domestic discovery and devel¬ opment activities. Domestic producers have been badly hurt by greatly reduced allowable production rates as foreign crude oil has supplanted domestic crude oil to an alarming extent. Total United 2% States crude oil supply during 1954 was below the level of 1953. After many months of ex¬ cessive as inventories, the relationship of supply to demand Las improved in recent months. However, total imports, Which were already excessive in 1953, were increased. Thus, domestic producers largely bore the brunt of the of supply even though some major importers reduced their volumes of imports during the year. As less remedy is a Some nust soon solution to applied. the of excessive found, not only for economic, but also security reasons. The nation can not risk imports for a defense with promptly the crucial products essential to survival.

Also, there is every reason Assuming general at least as good as in 1954, the insurance in¬ dustry will provide more insurance protection through greater sales efforts.

On the average, life insurance per family is the equivalent of only a little more than one year's an¬ sales for of insurance increase. to business is income. nual • It is in the investment field that conditions ' & appear uncertain an and only fairly satisfactory. There should be ample supply of mortgages, particularly guaranteed and also of tax exempt revenue issues.

On the money supply side, we expect the gradual in¬ able to of funds crease there will be seeking investment to continue. Whether an imbalance between the demand supply, time will tell. and the Perhaps, however, the most im¬ portant factor affecting the level of interest rates will be the attitude and actions of the Federal Reserve.
