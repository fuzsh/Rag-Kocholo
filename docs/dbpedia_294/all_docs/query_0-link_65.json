Here presented method aims to bridge the economic approach to asset management with the technical approach to road infrastructure life cycle, namely its resilience and performance. The presented asset value calculation methods are based both on socio-economic viewpoints on community benefits of an asset, as well as the technical aspect of the technical condition and residual life calculations of a road infrastructure. In contrast to common road asset management methods, asset value is not arbitrarily annually depreciated, instead, it is exactly calculated based on pavement performance models, pavement construction fatigue and paving material properties. Road asset value calculation is based on the asset performance and the technical condition of a pavement structure and other objects. Road asset performance is defined in terms of society and road user demands put on road category and its qualitative standard. Road asset technical condition is evaluated by the procurement cost calculation and condition deterioration. Value of condition deterioration is defined by residual life expectancy based on fatigue and construction reliability of the road infrastructure. The cross-asset allocation method is used for the creation of programs for claim and allocation of funding. The aim was to increase the credibility of the road administrators with the public as they present their decisions based on road asset management, and to increase the level of acceptance for practitioners.

However, academic research on this emerging marketing method remains insufficient. To fill this literature gap, this paper examines whether live-streaming e-commerce has gained consumers’ trust and strengthened their intention to purchase green agricultural products. On the basis of a literature review, in this paper, we establish an evaluation system for live-streaming e-commerce which includes information quality, system quality, service quality, telepresence, and social presence and assumes that high-quality live-streaming e-commerce will increase consumers’ green trust and, thus, strengthen green purchase intention. Altogether, 726 valid questionnaires were collected, and structural equation modeling (SEM) and stepwise regression were used to analyze the data. The results demonstrate that the five aforementioned dimensions of live-streaming e-commerce quality that were used as criteria positively impact green trust. The findings provide suggestions for green-product companies on how to improve their live-streaming quality to enhance consumers’ purchase intention to realize economic and social value.

It constitutes a low-density territory, characterized by a human and social landscape based on community practices, such as joint aid and the community use of goods and means of agricultural production, which have contributed to the construction of the “transmontana” identity and to the richness of the habitats. The promotion of the sustainable development of this low-density rural region demands the understanding of its specificities and an appropriate approach to grasp its challenges and develop effective management tools, allowing to preserve and exploit the region’s potential from various perspectives. The purpose of this article is to develop an analytical model using a literature review and a survey of the region’s specificities. This analytical model intends to provide the basis for designing and assessing sustainable development solutions, increasing local entrepreneurship and community empowerment through regional dynamism, with a focus on environment and heritage preservation, universal tourism accessibility, collective memory and endogenous product development. The suggested model adopts an interdisciplinary perspective and stresses that, in order to ensure that the new initiatives will contribute to the territory’s sustainable development, they should be scrutinized by asking four main questions: Is the initiative promoting the rural development of the territory through the creation of synergies between agroforestry and tourism activities? Is the initiative promoting an inclusive and sustainable tourism that is based on the territory’s resources? Are heritage and collective memory being preserved and valued through the initiative? Is the initiative promoting the empowerment of local communities?

However, tourism has negative impacts in destinations, such as the displacement and relocation of communities and disruption of economic systems, socio-political processes and organizations. It must be recognized that new strategies are required, because growth itself is not sufficient to fight poverty and inequality. Local people, especially the disadvantaged sections of the communities, need to be protagonists and able to control the tourism sector and benefit from it. The aim of this paper is to contribute to wellbeing, sustainability, and tourism research by proposing issues and ways forward related to enhancing well-being through community-based tourism (CBT). The paper is divided into three sections. The first focuses on CBT approaches. The second concerns the conceptual framework of wellbeing, with special emphasis on wellbeing in tourism, including host/guest relations; we present different evaluations of wellbeing, e.g., (socio-cultural, psychological, economic, and environmental). The third section discusses how wellbeing is presented in CBT and proposes ways forward for research. The paper is theoretical, and is based on previous literature and institutional and organizational documents.

They are currently exploring their options to digitally transform their clinical procedures and overall patient engagement. This work thoroughly investigates how hospital departments in the Netherlands can simultaneously leverage their strategic exploration of new IT resources and practices and exploit their current IT practices, i.e., IT ambidexterity, to drive digital transformation. Specifically, we investigate IT ambidexterity’s role in shaping patient agility at the departmental level, i.e., the ability to sense patients’ needs and respond accordingly. In this study, we use the dynamic capability view as our theoretical lens to develop a theoretical model with associated hypotheses and test it using cross-sectional survey data from 90 clinical hospital departments in the Netherlands. We use partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) and a Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach for our analyses. This study shows that IT ambidexterity positively influences patient agility, providing a foundation for the achievement of high patient service and market performance. Furthermore, this study’s outcomes show that IT ambidexterity is present in each configuration following the fsQCA analyses, showcasing the vital role of a dual strategic approach to IT practices. The study outcomes support the theorized model and the subsequently developed IT-driven patient agility framework and illuminate how to transform clinical practice and drive patient agility.

However, there are certain realistic challenges such as the lack of rural culture, the destruction of cultural context, and the loss of “rurality” of tourist areas. It is of vital significance to explore, integrate and revive the rural culture by advancing the rural cultural landscape based on the concept of cultural landscape in human geography. The specific categories of the rural cultural landscape were divided into three perspectives of agricultural production, famers’ lifestyle, and countryside ecology. Spatial reflections of various rural cultural landscapes were carried out based on pluralistic new data. The spatial characteristics of cultural landscapes were studied by using kernel density analysis and creating Thiessen polygons analysis and interpolation in ArcGIS spatial analysis, in order to show the spatial patterns of the special rural cultural areas and the cultural landscapes in greater Xi’an. Above all, our study inventoried and mapped the rural cultural landscapes in the context of rural tourism, identified spatial features of rural cultural landscape and rural tourism, and we proposed solutions that promote the cultural quality of rural tourism which are of vital significance in reviving rural culture.

Although the two facets share some common characteristics, their distinct focuses indicate that they cannot be fully covered by tort law or environmental law systems alone. As a result, an international trend toward the regulatory approach to environmental civil liability, which is referred to in this article as the “separate-regulatory paradigm”, is emerging. In such a pattern, as followed by the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), environmental tort liability and liability for environmental damage are mainly regulated by tort law and environmental statutes, respectively. However, China, relying substantially on its civil law system to address liability for environmental harm, seems to deviate from this paradigm. This article analyzes the significance of the separate-regulatory paradigm and argues that it has profound implications for China. This article suggests a separate statutory liability scheme that moves beyond the existing Chinese civil law framework to achieve the full recovery of environmental damage.

The political program provokes numerous ambitious measures but leaves room for various definitions and interpretations about which measures perform well. The challenge lies in understanding poverty and inequality in ways that move beyond a pure income-related perspective. In accepting this challenge, measures have been elabourated, which are supposed to advise the Austrian government in their efforts to implement the SDGs. The ‘unconditional basic income’ and the ‘all citizens’ insurance scheme’ represent two approaches among those measures, which call themselves for a comprehensive consideration of social justice. Both approaches will be discussed in terms of their political and normative claims. While basic income remains dominated by income, the insurance scheme engages with the question of who is entitled to benefits. Both approaches are ultimately unable to unfold their potentials as long as a territorial–administrative space concept is utilized. Since urban environments have their own specific social and spatial characteristics, it is essential to trigger a thorough discussion of political concepts which cope with the particular causes and effects of urban poverty, exclusion and inequality.

However, the geochemical site characterization revealed Pb, Cu, Zn and Hg concentrations in the soil exceeding the thresholds imposed by Italian regulations for residential use. Pb, Cu and Zn contents likely reflect the effects of urban vehicle traffic, while Hg contamination represents the legacy of a past artisanal tannery that used Hg(II)-chloride in leather processing in the mid-1900s. Mercury is widely distributed in the area, with the highest concentration in the uppermost soil layer, and reaching about 170 mg/kg in the common dandelion rhizosphere. Chemical extractions and thermal desorption experiments have indicated that most Hg is in the elemental free and matrix-bound fraction, with a possible minor amount (less than 4 wt%) of HgS and negligible methylated forms (0.1 wt%). The data suggest that soil processes could reduce Hg2+ to volatile Hg0. Mercury in groundwater, hosted in a shallow aquitard in the area, was below 0.2 µg/L. However, the presence of chloride in groundwater might result in the formation of Hg stable aqueous complexes, increasing Hg release from solids. Future water quality monitoring is hence recommended. The risk assessment highlighted that mercury in soil carries a risk of non-cancerous effects, in particular for children, posing the basis for management planning.

This study, from the perspective of sustainability, discusses the current business model of the relationship between CSR and the performance of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), a state−owned bank, with SBM-DEA and Tobit regression methods, and it puts forward a direction for improvement for future business models. Through the analysis of the years from 2010 to 2018, it has been found that the years with the best performances are 2010, 2011, and 2018, and some empirical evidence from the ICBC is as follows. First, corporate financial leverage closely follows gross domestic product (GDP) growth in terms of utilizing total assets. The ICBC seems to place less attention on its sales and on the number of deposits because of its high ratio of government stock holdings. Second, the ICBC raises labor productivity through education and training of its employees as well as through the proper utilization of capital for input-side management. Lastly, performance has improved as the ICBC has focused more on long-term society contributions, which are directed toward charity donations, loans for poverty alleviation, and green economy development in terms of output-side management. Therefore, through the above three CSR strategies, the ICBC has positively contributed toward environmental innovation and the societal transition of China, and its practices can be used as a sustainable model for future development.

Methodologically, it examines opportunities and limits for negative emissions by means of a literature review. On this basis, it conducts a qualitative governance analysis of the most important instruments of EU forest policy and presents optimizing policy options, measured against the binding climate and biodiversity targets under international law. Our analysis shows that the potential benefits of afforestation and reforestation for climate mitigation are overestimated, and are often presented as the new saviours to assist in reaching climate neutrality, inter alia, since only biodiverse and thus resilient forests can function as a carbon sink in the long term. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existing EU law fails to comply with climate and biodiversity targets. Quantity governance systems for livestock farming, fossil fuels and similar drivers of deforestation represent a more promising approach to forest governance than the dominant regulatory and subsidy-based governance. They are most effective when not directly addressing forests due to their heterogeneity but central damaging factors such as fossil fuels and livestock farming. Selected aspects of regulatory and subsidy law can supplement these quantity governance systems when focusing on certain easily attainable and thus controllable subjects. These include, e.g., the regulatory protection of old-growth forests with almost no exceptions and a complete conversion of all agricultural and forest subsidies to “public money for public services” to promote nature conservation and afforestation.

There are many studies on the influencing factors of residents’ consumption; however, few have studied the effects of industrial agglomeration on residents’ consumption, and even fewer have studied the spatial correlation of residents’ consumption. The goal of this paper is to research the impact of China’s manufacturing industrial agglomeration on residents’ consumption from a spatial perspective. Using data on China’s 31 provinces from 2003 to 2019 and the spatial Durbin model, our results show that the manufacturing industrial agglomeration and residents’ consumption present an inverted “U-shape” relationship and that different regions show different effects. Industrial agglomeration in the eastern region is relatively high and has a restraining effect on residents’ consumption, while industrial agglomeration in the central and western regions is at an early stage and promotes residents’ consumption. Therefore, different regions should adopt different industrial agglomeration policies.

This study addresses the research gap by conducting a hypothesis-testing quantitative study. The questionnaire survey data of 206 Chinese SEs were analyzed by performing Pearson correlation and hierarchical linear regression analyses. The research findings show that four types of organizational capabilities have divergent effects on the social and economic performance of Chinese SEs. Specifically, stakeholder engagement capabilities and business planning capabilities make positive contributions to SE performance in economic and social domains, while human resource management capabilities have positive effects on social performance but not economic performance, and there is no statistically positive relationship between marketing capabilities and SE performance in economic and social domains. Our study provides important practical implications to managers of SEs in China or in another similar context, who should give priority to enhancing stakeholder engagement capabilities and business planning capabilities rather than human resource management capabilities and marketing capabilities as a booster of economic and social performance of SEs.

Therefore, finding effective training and coaching to improve the professional skills of preservice teachers (PSTs) is of great importance. This study developed a proactive online training program (POTP) based on a model of work-integrated learning (WIL) activities and teacher education. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the POTP in improving PSTs’ professional skills. The participants consisted of 83 PSTs in an education program from two universities in Thailand. This study comprises three phases: phase I, the development of the POTP; phase II, a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design; and phase III, a focus group discussion. The findings demonstrated that PSTs in the group in which the POTP was implemented exhibited increased professional skill development compared to the PSTs in the control group, i.e., without the POTP. Analysis from the focus group confirmed that participants gained knowledge and satisfying online tools, and they were found to have better skills. They also revealed that the POTP not only improved professional skills but also enhanced the inspiration and confidence of the PSTs and supported their life and career goals and preparation. Therefore, educators, practitioners, and policymakers involved in pedagogical content knowledge development in teacher education programs can apply the POTP and assessment models proposed in this work to develop essential soft skills for PSTs and to better prepare them for their careers as teachers in the 21st-century digital era.

COVID-19 has had a direct and indirect effect on countries’ development. Thus, the pandemic limits the movements of labour forces among countries, restricting migrants’ remittances. In addition, it provokes the reorientation of consumer behaviour and changes in household expenditure. For developing countries, migrant remittances are one of the core drivers for improving household wellbeing. Therefore, the paper aims to analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected household expenditure in Ukraine, as being representative of a developing country. For this purpose, the data series were compiled for 2010 to the second quarter of 2021. The data sources were as follows: Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, The World Bank, and the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. The core variables were as follows: migrants’ remittances and expenditure of households by the types. The following methods were applied to achieve the paper’s aims: the Dickey–Fuller Test Unit Root and the ARIMA model. The findings confirmed that COVID-19 has changed the structure of household expenditure in Ukraine. Considering the forecast of household expenditure until 2026, it was shown that due to changes in migrants’ remittances, household expenditure in all categories tends to increase. The forecasted findings concluded that household expenditure on transport had the most significant growth due to changing migrants’ remittances.

The sustainability of the internal and external cycles of production systems is closely related to global value chains. Based on the world input-output model, we define the trade pattern of intermediate goods in various countries from the perspective of trade intermediary attributes, and propose two indicators by which to measure the dependence of China on the global value chain in the process of “dual circulation” development: the degree of vertical specialization (VSD) and the import share of domestic total consumption (IMS); China’s super-large market leads to low values of both VSD and IMS. China’s high-tech industry has the highest degree of external dependence in the process of participating in dual circulation, and there has been a fluctuation cycle since 2009. The external dependence of different industries shows heterogeneity.

Well-designed initiatives in the aftermath of a disaster can help displaced populations enter a positive cycle of resilience-building using new approaches. This paper draws from a recent field study to examine the reasons for the poor performance of existing housing stock in the face of disasters and presents a chain of graded causal factors that contribute to their vulnerability. Specifically, in the context of rural housing, the paper looks at three case studies of innovative habitat reconstruction initiatives undertaken in the aftermath of major disasters in India and analyses them for their impact on building the resilience of displaced communities. The study highlights that in order to address the various causes of vulnerability of rural housing, it is important to leverage the existing connections between different dimensions of habitat development, including access to finance, choice of appropriate materials, skill-building, and safe construction methods. This is at the core of the ethos of “building back better.” Full article\n\n►▼ Show Figures\n\n29 pages, 2283 KiB\n\nOpen AccessArticle\n\nThe Future of Wood Construction: Opportunities and Barriers Based on Surveys in Europe and Chile\n\nby Ewa Leszczyszyn, Henrik Heräjärvi, Erkki Verkasalo, Javier Garcia-Jaca, Gerardo Araya-Letelier, Jean-Denis Lanvin, Gabriela Bidzińska, Dobrochna Augustyniak-Wysocka, Uwe Kies, Alex Calvillo, Margareta Wahlströmh and Jean-Luc Kouyoumji\n\nSustainability 2022, 14(7), 4358; https://doi.org/10.3390/su14074358 - 6 Apr 2022\n\nCited by 17 | Viewed by 6580\n\nAbstract\n\nThe demand for wood has increased in recent years due to new technical possibilities and environmental concerns.

This paper provides an analysis of the factors that affect the use of wood in the construction sector, and an assessment of their importance in individual countries and for groups of stakeholders. The study covers the technical, societal, political, economic, and gender aspects of wood construction, with the aim of increasing global understanding regarding national differences, the current situation, and the potential for further development. The subject was investigated using a survey, and the most important opportunities for and barriers to growth in the use of wood in the construction sector were selected, following a statistical analysis. The results indicate strong regional and cultural differences regarding the acceptance of some of the opportunities and barriers related to the development of wood construction. The findings indicate that there is a need to promote wood construction based on its technical and economic benefits rather than its societal ones. On the other hand, the current societal barriers should be addressed as a priority, together with the establishment of common and harmonized policies. The results of this study, therefore, will contribute to the generation of regional-sensitive information that can be useful for policymakers when updating the building codes in their individual countries.

This research aims to extend the understanding of the government-led top-down urban regeneration approach with a case study of the Eastern Suburbs in Chengdu, China. A qualitative interview-based approach was adopted. The results show that the top-down approach is efficient and brings high-quality results for large-scale post-industrial transformation with inclusive stakeholder management. There are several possible ways to involve stakeholders: actively or passively, participating in the whole process or some stages, and engaging fully or partially, according to the demand on site.

Aluminum form-workers have increasing evidence of MSDs from repetitive tasks such as the adjustment, alignment of pins, pulling, pushing, and installation of panels, because of the cumulative exposure to ergonomic risks. Existing research indicates that this is due to insufficient expertise, form-worker awareness, and a complex construction plan. Using the Tecnomatix process simulate, this study aims to identify awkward postures during the process of lifting, assembling, and installing formwork to quantify MSDs and assess the ergonomic risk of aluminum form-workers and provide simple solutions. This simulation method makes use of input data from a random sample of 92 participants retrieved from four construction sites. The Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), Ovako Working Analysis System (OWAS) scores, and Energy Expenditure Rate (EER) for three identified awkward cases were determined to be unsatisfactory, unsafe, and acceptable with suggested alternatives. The ergonomic scores correspond to various bodily stresses, allowing workers to better understand which body parts experience major stress when performing manual jobs. The suggested integrated preventive ergonomics system reduces MSDs and improves how people interact with their surroundings.

The aim of this study was to determine the uniformity of spreading of organic fertilizers on the soil surface at different flows by evaluating the influence of the physical and mechanical properties of the fertilizers. The physical properties of organic fertilizers have been found to have a significant impact on the uniformity of fertilizer distribution. The investigation of fertilizer properties showed that the average moisture content of meat and bone meal granular fertilizers was 8.6 ± 0.2%, of cattle manure granular fertilizers—14.9 ± 1.5%, of dry lime—9.4 ± 0.1%, of wet lime—17.0 ± 1.1%, and of manure—66.7 ± 6.9%. It was found that the granules of cattle manure were more evenly spread on the soil surface (Gaussian coefficient 0.46) than the granules of meat and bone meal (g2 = 7.11). At the same time, manure was found to be most evenly distributed on the soil when dry lime was spread more evenly than wet. Simultaneously, it was revealed that the physical properties of the fertilizer, such as higher moisture, lower mass, granule length, and width, affected the uniformity of fertilizer distribution on the soil surface.

The installation of renewable energy generation units in non-optimal locations may increase system losses, costs, voltage fluctuations, etc. The main hurdle in integrating renewable energy generation units with an existing electrical grid is the uncertainty of renewable sources. This paper presents the impact of wind farm integration on the system economy in a wind-integrated deregulated power market. The importance of deregulation in terms of the system generation cost, bus voltage profile, and locational marginal pricing (LMP) are also studied in this work. LMP is the main parameter responsible for handling the system economy (i.e., profit of generating units and profit of customers). Considering the variable nature of wind flow, three different real-time wind speed datasets are used to validate this work. Bus sensitivity factor (BSF) is considered for equating the optimal position of the wind farm in the integrated system. Five different optimization techniques, i.e., sequential quadratic programming (SQP), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, and slime mold algorithm (SMA), are introduced to solve the optimal power flow problem. The SMA and ACO are used for the first time in this type of economic assessment (i.e., impact valuation of LMP) in a deregulated power system, which is the novelty of this work. The entire work is performed in a modified IEEE 30 bus test system.

For this purpose, the locally available energy sources, a local energy generation system, and the energy distribution in urban quarters should be considered. In the IWAES project presented here, a bidirectional low-temperature heat network was developed, thus it falls into the category of fifth-generation heat networks. It also makes use of existing urban water management infrastructure. The innovative concept is based on the approach of modifying sewers so that they can transport thermal energy between users in the same quarter and extract thermal energy from wastewater. The overall goal is to generate thermal energy and balance the different thermal needs. This is particularly useful in mixed-use quarters, as the peak loads of different uses occur at different times. The supply concept also envisages integrating other thermal energy sources available in the quarter as well as storage options into the supply concept. As a framework for the technical aspects, a precise urban planning concept is needed that provides the legal framework for land use and urban development and coordinates and implements the developed concept—through so-called energy master planning. A life cycle assessment shows the ecological impact of the developed concept compared to a conventional energy solution. It also shows the savings potential of the developed concept compared to an urban quarter supplied conventionally with heating and de-centrally with cooling. The assessment outlines the dual use of the pre-existing infrastructure, such as the wastewater system, significantly reduces CO2 equivalents. Another result is that the sustainability of the system depends significantly on the used mix of electric sources.

A review of existing literature suggests two forms of tourism linked to migration: visiting friends and relatives and second home tourism. Tourism related to visiting friends and relatives can be stimulated by migratory movements, and, in turn, gives rise to new migrations. Second home ownership, however, serves as the main connection between tourism and migration, promoting tourism that generates from or relates to current and past migrations. This exploratory study is based on a qualitative systematic literature review and focuses on the characteristics of second home and visiting friends and relatives-related tourism, and migration, in order to clarify little studied linkages among them that can affect tourism-related development.

They also play an essential role in enhancing technological development and competitiveness. Due to the impact of the fierce U.S.-China trade war on the global economy, many Taiwanese companies are considering moving their high-end product production lines back to their home country. This trend may promote the growth of the population in the surrounding areas of science parks and affect the limited infra-structure at the same time. This study explores how science parks could achieve sustainable development goals by formulating their development strategy. We summarized four evaluation aspects for constructing the driving factors for developing the science park through literature review and interviews with experts. Combined with the hybrid multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, we analyzed stakeholders’ satisfaction among the four aspects of the driving factors for the development of the science parks and put forward appropriate strategy recommendations. We found that the improvement of public infrastructure (PI) can improve not only the environmental quality (EQ) but also promote the business environment (BE) and the working environment (WE). This improvement could attract domestic and foreign manufacturers, create employment opportunities, expand the park’s scale, and eventually promote industrial development. This research improves the method of collecting empirical data to establish the driving forces for developing science parks through suitable development strategies.

The demand for natural gas will increase by 30% from 2020 to 2050, with the rise of industrial activities and the lifting of travel restrictions. The long-term production of these high acid-gas fields requires mitigation plans, which include carbon capture, utilization, and a storage process to reduce carbon emissions. Absorption is one the most established technologies for CO2 capture, yet it suffers from extensive energy regeneration and footprint requirements in offshore operations. Therefore, the aims of this paper are to review and analyze the recent developments in conventional and emerging solvent regeneration technologies, which include a conventional packed-bed column, membrane contactor, microwave heating, flash drum, rotating packed bed, and ultrasonic irradiation process. The conventional packed column and flash drum are less complex, with minimum maintenance requirements, but suffer from a large footprint. Even though the rotating packed-bed column and microwave heating demonstrate a higher solvent flexibility and process stability, both technologies require regular maintenance and high regeneration energy. Membrane contactor and ultrasonic irradiation absorption systems are compact, but restricted by various operational issues.

In response, research related to the risk of economic loss due to natural disasters has continued to develop. At present, insurance remains the best solution for funding such losses. The purpose of this study is to analyse the development of insurance as an alternative for sustainable economic recovery after natural disasters. The data used are articles obtained from several sources indexed by Scopus and Google Scholar. The search resulted in a final database of 266 articles, culled from a total of 813 articles before the final selection was made. The articles used are publications from 2000–2021 (including 21 database periods), to which we applied a systematic literature review method. Identification and evaluation of the articles was carried out through visualization of their content, development of disaster risk insurance, and availability of disaster risk insurance by country and type. The identification results show that the relationship between the word “insurance”, according to visualization using the VOSviewer software, has a relationship with other clusters including the words “disaster”, “disaster insurance”, “risk”, “natural disaster”, “study”, “recovery”, and “disaster risk financing”. The 266 articles studied show that there was an annual increase in the number of published scientific papers over the period 2000–2021. The types of disaster risk insurance, based on a review of the articles, include agricultural insurance, flood insurance, property insurance, earthquake insurance, crop insurance, and natural disaster insurance. In addition, of the six types of disaster risk insurance, three have been discussed the most in the last five years, namely, agricultural, flood, and property insurance. The increase in the number of scientific publications discussing these three types of disaster risk insurance has been influenced by climate change. Climate change causes a significant increase in the potential for disasters and is accompanied by an increased risk of loss. This review is expected to provide information and motivation for researchers related to the development and importance of disaster risk insurance research. Research in the risk sector for disaster losses due to climate change should be continued in the future in order to help fund economic recovery, especially throughout the insurance sector. With continuous research on disaster risk insurance, it is hoped that the resulting information can be more effective in determining insurance risk and in helping local economies and communities recover after the advent of a disaster. With the availability of funds for post-disaster recovery, the regional economy affected by the disaster can be immediately restored and recovered from adversity.

Lean principles in higher education institutions (HEIs) contribute positively to sustainability performance. The current study aims to: (a) assess waste in HEIs based on lean principles and even their potential effect on sustainability; (b) establish the relationship among wastes; (c) develop a structural model using Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM); (d) carry out the Matrice d’impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliqué Àun Classement (MICMAC) analysis. In Phase 1 of this study, the identification of waste modes in HEIs was established. In Phase 2, risk assessment of each waste mode was conducted using the waste-Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (w-FMEA) technique. In Phase 3, ISM-MICMAC was used to identify relationships among critical waste modes. The results showed that eighteen waste modes were identified as critical in HEIs—with six waste modes being autonomous determinants; four were dependent determinants, four were linkage determinants, and four were driver determinants. This study is expected to help academicians and practitioners understand HEI’s waste types by listing the critical wastes, mapping their interrelationship, identifying the driving power and dependence, and proposing mitigation actions. It will also contribute to the growing body of literature highlighting the waste in HEIs.

Non-uniform loading of transmission lines (which normally occurs due to the inefficient transmission of power) may lead to overloading of a few lines. These lines would then be prone to voltage instability. However, this problem would be aggravated under the network contingency condition. This paper focuses on improving the line loadability of the transmission system by considering the benchmark voltage stability index named rapid voltage stability index. The optimal loadability problem is considered using the grey wolf algorithm. The proposed work is implemented on a standard IEEE 30 bus test system using MATLAB software by addressing the problem by using line stability voltage index and grey wolf algorithm in optimal power flow. Minimizations of cost of generation, carbon emissions, voltage deviation, and line losses have been considered as objectives and improve the line loadability of the transmission system. The simulation results show that the proposed method is very effective in improving line loadability, reducing line congestion and fuel cost. Furthermore, the methodology is tested rigorously under various contingency conditions and is shown to be very effective. The proposed method relieves transmission line congestion and reduces fuel costs using the rapid voltage stability index (RVSI) is tested on an IEEE 30-bus standard test system utilizing MATLAB for various contingency lines Full article\n\n(This article belongs to the Special Issue Energy Scenario in the Context of Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement)\n\n►▼ Show Figures"
