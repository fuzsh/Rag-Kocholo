Y., Thursday, September 29, 1960 Price 50 Cents Copy a American Bankers Association renowned philosopher once remarked that we learn nothing from history except that we learn nothing from history. Before these words are put down as a master¬ piece of cynicism, it might be well to look around us to see what has been going on during the past two or three decades in this country. Remembering that the great depression began in the Administration of President Hoover (who, of course, followed another Republican, Calvin Coolidge) a good many have repeatedly made the broad statement that the Republican party generates de¬ pressions when it has been in office a number of years. The political reply most often heard is of a piece with the allegation, namely that the Democratic party has a way of getting us into world wars—reciting the fact that both World Wars started during Democratic re¬ gimes. It would be difficult to say which of the two political claims has the less real support in history. What we should be concerning ourselves with is, in any event, not which of the major political parties have done this or that, but rather what broad public policies have shown through the decades and even centuries that they best serve the real interests of the people. The fact of the matter is that for a good many years, even decades, there has been all too little difference between the poli¬ cies of the major parties and all too great a difference between them both ernmental policies on on the one Holds 86th i Many pressing financial domestic and nation's > a bankers.
