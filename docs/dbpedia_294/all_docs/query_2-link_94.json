JOHN SPARKMAN, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, Washington 25, D. C., August 18, 196',2. Chairman, Select Committee on Small Business, United States Senate, Washington, D. C. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Pursuant to the request made in your letter of August 18, 1952, I transmit herewith a copy of the staff report of the Federal Trade Commission on the International Petroleum Cartel. It is understood that this report will be published by your Monopoly Subcommittee, which is currently holding hearings on the effect of cartels and monopolies on small business. If and when hearings are scheduled concerning our staff report on the International Petroleum Cartel, the Commission will be glad to designate personnel to appear before your committee and discuss the contents of the report. By direction of the Commission. Sincerely, STEPHEN J. SPINGARN, Acting Chairman.. Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 PREFACE We are happy to have this staff report by the Federal Trade Com- mission on the International Petroleum Cartel. Our Monopoly Subcommittee, headed by Senator Long, has already held several hearings and issued a number of reports on monopolistic practices and cartel arrangements, particularly as they affect small business. This subcommittee was appointed in February 1952, and practically from its inception has been beleaguered by requests to investigate the alleged restrictive practices of the international oil industry. On April 23, April 29, and July 16, the subcommittee-in the course of public hearings-announced its keen interest in the staff report of the Federal Trade Commission on international petroleum cartels, and expressed the belief that the report should be released. On July 28, a letter was dispatched to the White House requesting that the report be made public. Now. that the President has approved this request, it is entirely appropriate that the report be included as part of our subcom- mittee's, series on monopolies and cartels. The Senate Small Business Committee has a profound and abiding interest in the effect of monopolistic and restrictive activities on the survival of independent competitive enterprise. Such activities are not always regional or even national in scope. When in exceptional, circumstances the fate of competitive free enterprise at home is inextricably linked with the pattern of business operations abroad, this committee will not hesitate to extend its investigations so as to determine the exact nature of these operations. However, our purpose is always the same: to discover the effect of certain business practices and arrangements on the American small-business man and on the American consuming public. With reference to the alleged Oil Cartel, it has been the aim of this committee to learn (1) whether or not five major integrated American oil companies have joined two foreign companies in a series of inter- national monopoly agreements;. (2) whether or not the structure of international oil prices has imposed an excessive burden on the economies of friendly nations, and thus on the American public which- is extending economic and military assistance to these nations; and, perhaps most important of all, (3) whether or not the dumping of foreign oil in the United States, at a net cost far below the price charged in Europe and the Middle East, is causing injury to inde- pendent American oil producers. It is our hope that publication of this report will contribute mate- rially to public knowledge and understanding of international business arrangements. It is a factual report and as such is subject, of course, to a variety of interpretations. If any interested party wishes to be heard, this committee will make time available so that all shades of opinion may be represented. Only after such hearings are completed, however, will our committee issue its final conclusions and recom- mendations on the effect of the alleged International Oil Cartel on Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 small busine s, in particular, and the consuming public of America, in general. I want to make it clear that this report is being published by our committee only after careful study and deliberation. It is my opinion that its release at this time is not likely to jeopardize our national security or undermine the aims of our foreign policy. The security aspect of the matter has been cleared with responsible agencies of Government. As to foreign policy, the goals of the United States in international affairs are clear: To attempt in every way possible to assure justice and freedom, under law, to all peoples of the earth. Publication of this report will certainly not interfere with the attain- ment of thes goals. There is another important reason for making this report available, and that is t subject the activities of great concentrations of economic power to the spotlight of publicity. It has long been the public policy of the United States to supple- ment the leg 1 provisions of the antitrust laws with broad, fact-finding powers. The fundamental purpose of fact-finding is to prevent the abuse of power. Where power exists there also exists the possibility of its abuse. Some two decades ago the Federal Trade Commission, through an e onomic investigation, restrained the abuse of power by the private u ility holding companies. Today the power of. the inter- national oil companies is so vast as to invite its abuse. By focusing the spotlight of publicity on the activities of these oil companies, the present r .-port of the Federal Trade Commission, like the earlier investigation of the utility companies, should prevent any possible abuse of pow r, either at home or abroad. The Senate Small Business Committee believes that it is the basic philosophy o the United States to oppose vast monopolistic con- centrations economic power. Practically alone among the great nations of the world, the United States-through fact finding and through enforcement of its antitrust laws-endeavors to hold in check the power o giant organizations. Whether privately or publicly owned, such organizations carry with them the inherent possibility that their overwhelming power may be abused to the' detriment of the people. The Senate Small Business Committee, in publicizing the operations of the international oil companies, wishes to reaffirm the determin tion of the American people that American companies, whether at home or abroad, shall so conduct themselves as to promote the interests f all people .everywhere. The Senat Small Business Committee, in issuing this report, is expressing its faith in Justice Brandeis' belief that sunlight is the best of disinfectar is and electric light the most efficient policeman.

Federal Trade Commission passed a tee,?olutiot directing its economic staff to conduct a long-range in- westigation of international cartels. The resolution stated in part that: Whereas the Federal Trade Commission Act authorizes the investigation of trade conditions in and with foreign countries where associations, combinations or practices of manufacturers, merchants, or traders, or other conditions may affect the foreign trade of the United States; and to report to Congress thereon * * * and Whereas there is evidence that agreements detrimental to the trade, commerce, and security of the United States existed prior to the war, between German ancll American, British and American, German and British, and between industry groups in other nations * * * * * * * Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Federal Trade Commission * * * herewith directs the chief economist to make an investigation and inquire into- The practices, arrangements, agreements, and operations of manufacturers, merchants, or traders operating in export trade. The effectiveness of the said agreements, arrangements, and associa- tions The effects resulting from the operations of foreign cartels or other combina- tions of foreign manufacturers; merchants, and traders upon the export trade of the United States of America and the American consumer.

The International Cartel in the Alkali Industry--------------------- 1949 1950 The Commission felt that the basic purpose of its resolution of 1944 would not have been accomplished without the preparation of a report on one of the most important of the international cartels-the inter- national petroleum cartel. To facilitate the preparation of this report, the Commission on December 2, '1949, passed a supplemental resolu- tion calling for an investigation of the international cartel in this specific industry. This resolution provided as follows: Whereas the petroleum industry is one of the largest and most important industries in the United States; And whereas this industry is very highly concentrated, with the preponderance of total assets, proved reserves, crude production, and refining capacity held by a relatively few large companies; Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 And wherea i it is reported in authenticated, secondary sources that over a long period of years American petroleum companies operating in foreign countries have entered i to restrictive agreements among themselves and with petroleum companies of other nations, many of these agreements having reportedly been recently exten ed and reinforced; And wherea. such restrictive agreements are reported to have had the effect of restraining trade and of affecting prices of petroleum and petroleum products in the United States; And whereas this problem has been intensified by the importance of recent discoveries of it in foreign nations: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Federal Trade Commission, in the exercise of the powers vested in it by section 6, paragraphs (a), (b), and (h) of the Federal Trade Com- mission Act, a d with the aid of any, and all powers conferred upon it by law, do forthwith proceed to make an investigation of agreements entered into by Ameri- can petroleum companies among themselves and with petroleum companies of other nations i connection with foreign operations and with international trade in petroleum a d petroleum products and of the relationship of such agreements to domestic tr de in and pricing practices of the American petroleum industry; and that the D rector of the Bureau of industrial Economics be hereby authorized to conduct such investigation on behalf of the Commission. Like its p edecessors, the present report,, which was thus prepared under a gene al resolution of 1944 and a specific :resolution of 1949, is merely descriptive and fact finding in character. It contains sum- maries of th facts presented but no recommendations. These sum- maries are presented at the end of each of the report's 10 chapters . One of the petroleum companies voluntarily submitted to the Com- mission certain agreements made subsequent to the date of the Com- mission's su pena, since, in the opinion of this company, these agree- ments cast 1 ght upon the meaning of some of the documents sub- penaed. Th discussion in the report makes reference to this supple- mental information; but otherwise the analysis of the subpenaed ma- terial has no sought to take account of developments subsequent to the date of t e subpenas nor of any new agreements that may have been entered into subsequent to that date.

At times it has been the subject of competition and rivalry; more frequently it has been the subject of agreement and international cartel arrangements. Over the years an international petroleum industry has developed, not only because of the importance of petroleum products, but also because these products are so stand- ardized as to have almost universal acceptance, irrespective of the source of the crude from which they are derived. WORLD'S RESERVES The world's petroleum reserves are concentrated in a few countries. As of January 1, 1949, these reserves, excluding those of Russia, were estimated at 73.7 billion barrels, of which more than 90 percent or 69 billion barrels were in six countries: United States, Venezuela, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. The following table shows the estimated proved reserves by geographical areas and by countries.

The most important discoveries of new reserves in recent years have been in he Middle East and in Canada. New discoveries in Canada are expected to add more than 1 billion barrels to the total reserves of that country,2 while the tremendous new 'discoveries in the Middle E st have made that area the most prolific potential sup- plier of oil in the world. PRINC PAL CRUDE PRODUCING AREAS OF THE WORLD Crude petroleum is produced in more than 40 countries, but in 1949, 7 countries accounted for about 85 percent of the world's total pro- duction. Thee seven countries were the United States, Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mexico, and Iraq. If the production of Russia and Russian-controlled countries is excluded, these seven countries prod ced more than 92 percent of the world's crude in 1949. 1 The estimates on w ich table l is basod vary in accuracy depending on the data available in each country, the expertness of those making tiie estimates, the assumptions underlying the data and so on. Estimates for well-developed field are more dependable than those for newly opened fields, such as those in the Mid- dle East. fl World Oil, July 15, 119m, p. 65.

In North America, the principal producers are the United States, Mexico, and Canada. In 1949, those three countries produced more than 57 percent of the world's total crude. Table 2 gives world production in 1949 by country and by geo- graphical area. The United States has long been the world's most important pro- ducer of crude petroleum, and has maintained. a relatively constant proportion since the turn of the century. For sereral years produc- tion in the United States has averaged about 60 percent of world production. In 1949, however, this percentage declined to 54.7 percent. In 1949, production in the United States averaged about 5 million barrels per day from more than 449,000 wells, or an average produc- tion of approximately 11 barrels per day per well.' In the average of barrels per well per day, the United States ranks far below most other important oil-producing countries. In 1949, Mexico produced about 60 million barrels of crude, and had seventh place among the important oil-producing countries of the world. Peak production in Mexico was reached in 1921, with 193 million barrels. At that time Mexico was the second largest crude producer in the world. However, production declined rapidly and reached a low of 33 million barrels in 1032. Since the end of World War II, production in Mexico has increased from 43 million to more than 60 million barrels annually. Daily output per well averaged about 160 barrels in 1949,4 nearly 15 times that of the United States. ' world Oil, July 15, 1950, p. 54. 4 Ibid., p. 44.

Ranking second to the. United States in production of crude is South America, especially the Venezuelan-Caribbean area. In addi- tion to Venezuela, which produced at the rate of about 1,320,000 barrels daily in 1949, crude oil is produced in significant amounts in Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Trinidad. The total crude output of the-latter four countries averaged 240,000 barrels per day in 1949. Total production in South. America accounted for more than 16 percent of the world's output in. 1949.6 Production per well in the Venezuela-Caribbean area is generally much higher than in the United States, and is exceeded only by the wells of the Middle East. In 1949, the average production per well per day in Colombia was 69 barrels, in Argentina 47 barrels, in Trinidad 25 barrels, in Peru 11 barrels, and in Venezuela-South America's most important crude producer-200 barrels.' The third important area of crude oil production is the Middle East, which includes Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrein. In 1949, about 15.5 percent of the world's crude output was obtained from this area. The average daily rate of production for the five most important Middle Last countries was close, to 1,400,000 barrels daily.' Although oil was produced in the Middle East prior to World War I, it is only since World War II that the Middle East haq developed into an important potential supplier of the world's crude. The vast potential of this area is indicated by the fact that total production in 1949 came from only 287 wells, with an average output per well per day of 5,143 barrels. In Iraq, the average production per well per day was no less than 11,200 barrels, in Iran 2,190 barrels, in Saudi Arabia 6,083 barrels, and in Kuwait, almost 4,450 barrels.' By drilling more wells and building more pipe lines, the Middle East could undoubtedly become the leading oil producing area of the world. Despite the difficulties in obtaining supplies and equipment during World War II, production increased 320 percent between 1939 and 1949. 'In the Far E4st, the important producing countries are the Nether- lands East Indies and British Borneo, which, however, produced in 1949 only about 2 percent of world production e This area has not fully recovered from war damage, and during the past year political disturbances have hampered operations. Russia and Eastern Europe, including Rumania, produced about 8 percent of the world's crude in 1949, nearly all of which was used by countries under Soviet influence.10 Although the world's production of crude petroleum is derived from the same areas and countries that have the crude reserves, a comparison of the distribution of reserves with crude production in 1949 reveals wide disparities in the relative positions of some countries, as is indicated in table 3. It will be seen from table 3 that some countries are drawing on their reserves at a much faster rate than others. For example, in E Ibid., p. 54. 6 Ibid., p. 54. 7 Estimates of production do not always agree. World Oil July 15, 1950, gives the average daily produc- tion of the Middle Fast (including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrein) as 1,473,718 barrels, while the Oil and Gas Journal, January 26, 1950, gives production for the same countries as 1,386,000 barrels daily. e World 011, July 15, 1950, p. 54. o Ibid., p. 42.

The percentages of world production by Venezuela and Mexico also exceed their respective percentages of world reserves. On the other hand, Kuwait and the other major holders of reserves in the Middle East had a percentage of world production much below their per- centage of world reserves. The Middle East, however, is developing rapidly, and its reserves, as well as its annual share of the world's crude production, are expected to increase in the future. WORLD CRUDE OIL REFINING CAPACITY A country's ability to convert crude petroleum into usable products is indicated by its refining capacity.

Thus the table reveals those areas of the world which consumed more oil than they produced, as well as those areas which produced in excess of domes tic needs. The only two areas of the world that produced more petroleum than they consumed in 1947 and 1949 were the Caribbean and the Middle East.

These deficit areas were Europe, Africa, the Far East and Oceania., and parts of North and South America. One of the most striking developments revealed in table 2 is the rise of the Middle East as an important supplier of the world's petro- leum needs. In ,1947, the Middle East had an excess of supply over consumption of about 671,000 barrels daily; by 1949, this excess had nearly doubled, reaching 1,191,000 barrels daily, which was almost enoumh to surpass the Caribbean area as a surplus producer of petroleum. In the United States in 1949 consumption exceeded domestic supply. by about 322,000 barrels daily, while in 1947 consumption and supply were approximately equal. 'raking the 'major. producing areas as a whole, in 1949 the United. States, the Caribbean, and the Middle East supplied 85 percent of the world's oil but consumed only 64 percent. Thus a surplus of 21 per- cent, or about 2,120,000 barrels per day, was available for the deficit- producing countries. :FABLE 5,-Petroleum demand and supply by areas, 1947 .and 1949 [In thousands of barrels daily] Percent of world Excess of Excess of supply Domestic Domestic supply demand Country demand supply over over demand supply Domestic Domestic demand supply 1949 United States___________ 5,792.4 5,470.4 322.0 59.42 65.70 Other North.

R., the United States is the only important tra ized country which is able to supply its own petroleum needs. any of the major crude-oil-producing countries are not highly i dustrialized and, therefore, have a limited demand for petroleu . Typical of such countries are the nations of the Middle East and South America. The converse is true of most of the coun- tries of Western Europe and Canada (the latter prior to recent dis- coveries), which are highly industrialized but produce little pe- troleum. TH PATTERN OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN PETROLEUM In the receding sections it has been shown that the geographic distributi n of the world's petroleum production differs widely from the geogr phic distribution of consumption.. This wide disparity has given rise to it rather well defined pattern of international trade in the ind istry. The pr' cipal movements of crude petroleum in international trade are shown for 1948 in table 6. It will co seen that in 1948 there were three dominant movements of crude-- all of course, from surplus areas. From the United States, the principa, l crude movements were to Canada, Cuba, Argen- tina, Fran e, and the United Kingdom. From Venezuela and Colom- bia, large uantities of crude moved to the Netherlands West Indies, United St tes, and Europe, with small ? amounts going to Africa, Argentina, and Uruguay. The third major international movement of crude was from Iran and the Persian Gulf 11 to North and South America, urope, Africa, and Asia. 11 In preceding sections Iran and the Persian Gulf are included under the more general term \"Middle East.\" Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 '.,nmrc 1 0.

In 1948, about 23 million barrels of crude moved from the Middle East to the United States an Canada, representing approximately 12 percent of all crude exported from the Middle East. As would be expected, the international movements of crude are from the producing areas to countries which have the refining capacity to convert crude to products, rather than to the important consuming countries. Thus a considerable proportion.of the international trade in petroleum moves indirectly to the consuming countries, by way of those ar as which possess, refining facilities'. \"Rafining facilities are frequently located where neither production nor consumption of petroleum is important. For example, in 1.948, large quantities of crude prod ced in Venezuela were exported to the Netherlands West Indies for efining, with the products then exported to the consuming countries. In 1948, Venezuela exported 437,700,000 barrels of crude petroleum. Of this total, 270,992,000 barrels, or approximately 62 ? percent, w lit to the Netherlands West Indies, which is neither an important producing nor consuming area. Since most of the refined products d rived from this crude must be moved to consuming areas, the result is a corresponding increase in the volume of international trade. Similarly, the..Inovements of crude from: the Persian Gulf to Bahrein Island and Palestine; (as shown in -table 6) are -movements to refining centers, ra her than to consuming areas.. From these refineries, finished petroleum products are shipped to Europe and Asia. Another type of movement is the shipment of crude to countries which are important consumers of petroleum products, have consider- able refining capacity, but are deficient in crude production. In 1948, France had about 50 percent of the refining capacity of Western Europe, hub its crude production accounted for only about six-tenths of 1 percen of refinery runs. About 72 percent, or roughly 40 million barrels, of the imports on which France depended came from the Middle East; while 28 percent, or approximately 14.5 million barrels, came from , the United States and Venezuela--primarily from the latter.12 - Since France's refinery output could not satisfy her requirements, these imports of crude were inadequate. As a result, France im- ported approximately 7 million barrels of refined, petroleum products (motor gasoline and' distillate fuel oil)-principally from the United States and ho Persian Gulf.13 The flow f refined products is shown in table 7, which reveals three principal ex orters of,refined products: the United States, Netherlands West Indie and Venezuela, and the Persian Gulf. As importers, the major geog aphical areas stood, in order of importance, as follows: Europe, As a, North America, Africa, Oceania, and South America. The principal movements of refined products were: (a) from the United States to other North American countries, to South America and Europ , with small quantities to : Oceania, Asia, and Africa; ' Bureau of M es, International Petroleum Trade, May 31, 1949, pp. 127-128.

On December 14, 1933, they accordingly entered into an agreement: 1. To exercise Eastern Gulf Oil Corp.'s option on any concession or concessions which Eastern and General Syndicate might obtain in Kuwait; 2. To use the agencies and facilities at the disposal of each to obtain these concessions on terms not substantially more onerous to the con- cessionaire than those of a draft concession which, by reference, was made part of the agreement; 3. To assume on a 50-50 basis any expenses subsequently incurred by either party in obtaining these concessions, including a cash pay- ment of ?36,000 due to Eastern and General Syndicate if and when Eastern Gulf Oil Co. took up its option with the syndicate; 4. To form an operating company (Kuwait Oil Co., Ltd.) to be financed and owned equally by Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd. and Gulf Exploration Co., whose production would be shared equally by Anglo- Persian and Gulf at cost, the ownership of which could not be sold or transferred except (a) with the consent of the other party and (b) subject to the provision that any transferee would become fully bound by the terms of the 1933 agreement.1e Two other important provisions relating to the disposal of oil which the Kuwait Oil Co. might produce in the future were covered by the agreement. In the first place, each gave assurance to the other that Kuwait oil would not be used to \"upset or injure\" the other's \"trade or marketing position directly or indirectly at any time or place.\" In the second place, each party undertook \"to confer from time to time as either party may desire and mutually settle in accordance with such principles any question that may arise between them regarding the marketing of Kuwait oil and products therefrom.\" It was further stipulated that Anglo-Persian's marketing position in India as a sup- plier of Burmah Oil Co. was recognized even though its marketing position: * * * is on an in and out nature dependent on the relation from time to time between Burmah Oil Co.'s and/or the Burmah-Shell Co.'s outlet there and the volume of indigenous production * * * even though in pursuance of such arrangement it [Anglo-Persian] may not at any given time actually be supplying oil or the full range of its products to that market. Notwithstanding these restrictive provisions, the agreement stated: Anglo-Persian recognized, however, that Gulf will wish to have outlets for Kuwait oil, if and when produced; and therefore has no desire that Gulf should 15 '1 he reason for A nglo-Persian's sudden change of interest appears to have been the discovery by Stand- ard Oil Co. of California of oil in quantity in nearby Bahrein in an area previously considered by British geologists to be unfavorable to oil production. Specifically, the agreement was that if either party proposed to sell or transfer bis interest in whole or in part to a third party, all the facts as to purchaser, price, etc., had to be reported to the other party who then had the option of approving the sale or of buying the shares at the price offered by the third party. Only if the other party was wlling neither to approve the third party nor to buy the shares at the price offered by the third party, could the sale or transfer to an outsider be completed without the consent of the other party.

INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM CARTEL assume any restrictions with respect to the marketing of such oil products there- from which would in any way interfere with Gulf's freedom to obtain such outlets consistently with the observance of the above assurance. Thus, Angl -Persian assured Gulf that it would have freedom to seek markets for Kuwait oil, while both bound themselves not to compete with ach other in such a manner as to endanger each other's marketing po ition. These provisions were entirely consistent with the international cartel agreement, heads of agreement for distribu- tion, which had been formulated with the participation of Gulf and which was the in effect. Under this agreement the market positions of all participants were to be determined on the basis of their 1928 volume of b siness and their proportion of any future increase in production,\" 1 and quotas so determined were to apply in every country of the world except the United States.18 In entering into this agreement Gulf, which bad a \"recognized marketing po ition\" in European and Western Hemisphere foreign markets, but one in the Far East, was seeking a Middle East source of supply and r its own control. If it obtained such a source free from restrictions o its sale of Kuwait oil, not only would its competitive position be greatly strengthened in European markets, but also it would be able to enter the Far East markets. Naturally Gulf wished to retain these advantages. It declare in an application to the Securi- ties and Excha go Commission, in 1946, that the restrictive marketing provisions were obnoxious to both Gulf Exploration Co. and its 1 parent compa y. 9 On the oth r hand, as noted in a subsequent chapter, Gulf had participated i the formulation of the world cartel's heads of agree- ment for distribution. Hence, the company was fully aware of the cartel's attempt to divide world markets on the basis of the percentages of trade done i each market in 1928.20 Its participation in the form- ulation of the artel agreement obviously weakened Gulf's position in resisting the marketing restrictions insisted upon by Anglo-Iranian, which were based on the cartel agreement itself. Thus even though Gulf had the upport of the United States Department of State's \"open-door p licy,\" it was virtually compelled to accept various restrictive conditions. Gulf's counsel has stated that further efforts were made to ave the British Government modify or remove these restrictions but without success.21 Gulf was also obliged to accept a condition, insi ted upon by the British Government, that only a British compa y could hold a concession to produce Kuwait oil.22 17 Principle No. 1 of he Achnacarry Agreement of 1929.

(For the basis for such insistence, soo treaty agreements with the Sheik quoted on p. 129 Later, but only-folio by the United States Department of State in 1932, His Majesty's Government modified i s position to the extent of waiving the nationality clause in the concession, but stood by its requirement tha the concessionaire must be and always remain a British company.

That any additional oil produced at the request of either Gulf or Anglo-Persian would \"be allocated in full to the party making the request, at cost for all such oil.\" 23 In addition, section 8 of the agreement stated: The parties have in mind that it might from time to time suit both parties for Anglo-Iranian to supply Gulf's requirements from Persia and/or Iraq in lieu of Gulf requiring the company to produce oil or additional oil in Kuwait. Provided Anglo-Persian is in position conveniently to furnish such alternative supply, of which Anglo-Persian shall be sole judge, it will supply Gulf from such other sources with any quantity of crude thus required by Gulf provided the quantity demanded does not exceed the quantity which in the absence of such alternative supply Gulf might have required the company to produce in Kuwait- at a price and on conditions to be discussed and settled by mutual agreement from time to time as may be necessary-such price f, o. b., however, not to be more than the cost to Gulf of having a similar quantity produced in and put f. o. b. Kuwait. Thus Gulf and Anglo-Persian could order jointly or separately as much oil out of Kuwait as either desired. The above provisions, however, gave Anglo-Persian a powerful voice in determining the actual amount of Kuwait production. Anglo-Persian, having exten- sive interests in Iran and Iraq, could determine for itself how much of its own requirements would be ordered from Kuwait rather than from Iran and Iraq. Whenever convenient, moreover, a matter of which it was the sole judge, Anglo-Persian, in consultation with Gulf, could decide that part or all of the oil ordered out of Kuwait by Gulf would actually be produced by Anglo-Persian in either Iran or Iraq or both. The provision that such alternative oil would not cost Gulf more than if it had been \"produced in and put f. o. b. Kuwait\" made it a matter of indifference to Gulf, insofar as price was concerned, whether Kuwait oil or \"alternative oil\" were actually supplied. Anglo-Persian's power to substitute, with Gulf's consent, alternative oil for increased Kuwait output accorded perfectly with the principles of the international cartel agreement of 1928, commonly known as the Achnacarry agreement. Under that agreement the major inter- national oil companies, including Anglo-Persian, endeavored to control production by such means as (1) joint use of existing facilities, (2) constructing only such additional facilities as were necessary to supply increased demand, and (3) shutting in any excess of production over consumption. If and when Kuwait produced oil, it would of course become a new source of supply in the international market. Some means of controlling its production by the substitution of oil from other established producing regions would be a logical cartel objective under these principles. The substitution of Persian or 28 \"Cost\" was defined as the actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the company, including explora- tion. drilling, royalties, duties, taxes, and all other expenses whatsoever applicable to such oil, and deprocia- tion, amortization, and interest on capital at reasonable rates to be agreed upon. 23541-52-10 Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 Approved For Release 2010/04/14: CIA-RDP57-00384R000700130001-2 Iraq oil would c equivalent to sh Reiteration of March 23, 1937, consisting of 10( Oil Co., Ltd.

To obtain the concession California Standard agreed to make loans and advances to the Arabian Government in the amount of ?150,000; to pay an- nually a cash rental of ?5,000; and if oil were discovered, to pay a royalty of 4s. per ton and to furnish free to the Saudi Arabian Govern- ment 200,000 gallons of gasoline and 100,000 gallons of kerosene, annually. Further advances of ?100,000 and an increase in the annual rental of ?20,000 was the price for obtaining a second conces- sion in 1939 which extended the concession area to 440,000 square miles. The loans and cash advances were recoverable by the com- pany only by deductions from royalties, and the Government also hoped to augment its income through royalties. From the outset, therefore, Aramco's financial relationships with the Saudi Arabian Government required a market outlet for any oil discovered. With no established position in the Eastern Hemisphere, Standard of California had already come face to face with the difficulty of finding a market for its Bahrein oil without engaging in a competitive struggle with the established international companies. The Bahrein problem was solved on July 1, 1936, when Standard of California bought a half interest in the far eastern marketing facilities of the Texas Co., which already had an established position east of Suez, with the Texas Co. buying a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Co. Aramco also obtained access to these limited eastern markets when the Texas Co., in December 1936, bought a half interest in Aramco. A trade press comment at the time of the first acquisition stated that- * * * it assures that Bahrein production as well as any output that may eventually come from countries now being developed by Standard Oil Co. of California will have assured and regulated outlets and will so lessen any possible danger of upsetting the equilibrium of international markets.27 Up to 1941, Caltex, the marketing company owned jointly by Standard of California and Texas, was able to find markets cast of Suez for only 12,000 to 15,000 barrels daily of Aramco's oil. This was reported to be less than one-seventh of what Aramco's developed fields could have produced in 1941. During the war, production was gradually increased to 58,386 barrels daily in 1945. Since a large proportion of this output, however, was refined and sold to the Allied Governments, this proved to be only a temporary outlet, leaving Aramco at the end of the war with crude oil and refining facilities, but no market. Moreover, Aramco's need for markets was aggra- vated by the discovery of additional fields in 1945 and 1947. At this point, Aramco proposed to build a pipeline to the Mediterranean. This proposal caused great concern to the established international companies, which immediately endeavored to open up additional markets to Aramco, both east and west of Suez, but in such a manner as not to disturb world markets. This involved several coordinated steps. First, the Texas Co. sold its European marketing facilities to Caltex, thus making its markets west of Suez available to Aramco. Second, Standard of California and Texas permitted Standard Oil Co. (New Jersey) and Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., together, to purchase a 40-percent interest in both Aramco and Trans-Arabian Pipe Line 37 The Petroleum Times, July 4, 1036, p. 8.

And third Jersey Standard and Socony-Vacuum entered into contracts to buy oil from Aramco. Thus, while new markets were opened up to ramco, the recognized marketing positions of the international of companies were preserved. The principal change was a shift in their sources of supply on the part of three of the four American companies which now own Aramco in order to make room for Aramco's production, which they are now in a position to control. Kuwait Oil Co , Ltd.-The history of Kuwait Oil Co., Ltd., is likewise one of an American company which, single-handed, sought to obtain a foothold in Middle East production. In 1931, both Eastern Gulf Oil Co., a subsidiary of Gulf Oil Corp., and Anglo-Persian, separately, began negotiating for a concession in Kuwait.

When these purchase agreements are discussed publicly by representatives of the petroleum companies, emphasis is usually placed on the ordinary commercial purchase and sale aspect which they share with all other sales contracts. -However, since the companies participating in them often are already bound together through joint-ownership arrangements and participate in various production and marketing agreements, purchase and sale contracts among them often lack many of the arm's-length features that characterize ordinary commercial agreements among mutually independent buyers and sellers. Under these circumstances, the sales of oil covered by the contracts can often be utilized as an instrument to divide production, restrain competition in marketing, and protect the market positions both of the buyer and the seller. They deter- mine who may or may not buy crude oil from particular producing properties. They tend to funnel the production from more or less diversified ownerships into the centralized marketing organizations of the large companies. They tend to keep surplus supplies of crude oil out of the hands of independent oil companies. The existence of these contracts in an atmosphere of joint ownership of production and marketing, the long periods for which they run,' the manner in which prices are determined under them, and the marketing restric- tions often written into them, indicate that they are something, more ,than ordinary commercial purchase and sale contr"
