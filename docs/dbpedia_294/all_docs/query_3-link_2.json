Anyone remember the little Dennis Aces - and the classic Scammell normal control heavy road tanker, big brother to the BR Scarab?\n\nRail tankers were rather more spartan - the black looks familiar from earlier - though there were also bitumen rail tanks that used to be warmed at special plants before discharge. One such plant was by the Paradise bridge on Scotswood Road, Newcastle, operational till long after that leg of the N&C was closed.\n\nI had a Trix Twin set in the postwar 1940s. It had a black LMS 0-4-0 and a yellow shell tank waggon - that could not have been UK: mebbe Dutch at the nearest!\n\nFina existed in the post war years. I recall going on a school visit to Stanlow Shell refinery in about 1954 and seeing Esso, Regent and Fina road and rail tank waggons being filled ready for distribution and they explained that the oil companies all bought from the nearest refinery. So much for that special Tiger in Your Tank!\n\nRaR"
