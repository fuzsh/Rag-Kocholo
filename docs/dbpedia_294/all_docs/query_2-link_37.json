Whilst Richard Edmonds Auctions make every effort to ensure the accuracy of their catalogues and the description of any lot:-\n\n(a) Each lot as set out in the catalogue or as divided of combined with any other lot or lots is sold by the seller with all faults, imperfections and errors of description.\n\n(b) The Richard Edmonds Auctions do not accept responsibility for the authenticity, attribution, genuineness, origin, authorship, date, age, period, condition or quality of and lot unless they have been instructed in writing by the seller to so certify, and in such cases the Auctioneers do so as agents of the seller and are not themselves responsible for such claims.\n\n(c) All statements, whether printed in the catalogue or made orally as to any of the matters set out in the above are statements of opinion only and are not to be taken as being, or implying any warranties or representations of fact by Richard Edmonds Auctions unless they have been instructed in writing by the seller so to certify.\n\n(d) Any claim under such statute must be received in writing by the auctioneers within seven days of the day of sale.\n\n3. The Auction\n\n(a) The Auctioneers have absolute discretion to divide any lot, to combine and two or more lots or to withdraw any lot or lots from the sale, to refuse bids, regulate bidding or cancel the sale without in any case giving any reason or without previous notice.

The Auctioneer may at his sole discretion determine the advance of the bidding or refuse a bid. If during the auction the Auctioneer considers that a dispute has arisen, he has absolute discretion to settle it or re offer the lot.\n\n(c) Each lot is put up for sale subject to any reserve price placed by the seller. Where no reserve has been placed the seller has the right to bid either personally or by any one person on his behalf (who may be the Auctioneer)\n\n(d) All conditions, notices, descriptions, statements and other matters in the catalogue and elsewhere concerning any lot are subject to any statements modifying or affecting the same made by the auctioneer from the rostrum prior to any bid being accepted for the lot.\n\n4.
