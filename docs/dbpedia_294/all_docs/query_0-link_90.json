R.\n\nThe names of Horton and Philip occur together so frequently in any discussion of infiltration that it is particularly appropriate that John R. Philip should be the recipient of the Robert E. Horton Medal. In 1931, Horton emphasized the need for âresearch to provide connective tissue between related problems,â and Philip's achievements have gone far toward satisfying that need.John R. Philip was born at Ballarat, some 70 miles from Melbourne, and attended Melbourne University, graduating as bachelor of civil engineering in 1946. After a few years of engineering experience with Queensland's Irrigation Commission, he took up a position as research scientist in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in 1951. He moved rapidly from analysis of the hydraulics of border irrigation to the general problems of infiltration and soil water movement and found analytical solutions to a wide range of problems in homogeneous porous media. In 1957, Philip and his colleague D. A. de Vries were awarded the Horton prize of the AGU for their paper on moisture movement in porous materials under temperature gradients. In 1960, Melbourne University awarded John Philip his doctorate of science for a thesis, âPhysical Contributions to Microhydrology,â consisting of 19 published papers.\n\nYF-12A #935 with test pilot Donald L. Mallick\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1972-01-01\n\nNASA test pilot Don Mallick, in full pressure suit, stands in front of the YF-12A (60-6935). Don is ready for a flight across the Western United States. Donald L. Mallick joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics' Langley Aeronautical Laboratory at Hampton, Virginia, as a research pilot, in June 1957. He transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Flight Research Center, Edwards, California, in February 1963. Mallick attended Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, for the period 1948-1949, studying Mechanical Engineering before entering the U.S. Navy for pilot training. Don served during the Korean War period, 1950-1954, flying F2H-2 Banshee jets from the carriers, USS F.D. Roosevelt and the USS Wasp. Later in 1954 he returned to school at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, graduating with Honors in June 1957 and earning his degree in aeronautical engineering. Don joined the Naval Reserves and served in almost all categories of Reserve operations before retiring in 1970 as a Lieutenant Commander. As a research pilot at NACA-NASA Langley Don flew quantitative stability-&-control and handling-qualities tests on modified helicopters. On the Vertol VZ-2 Vertical Short Take-off and Landing research aircraft, he performed qualitative evaluation flights. Other aircraft flown for flight tests were: F2H-1 Banshee, F-86D, F9F-2 and F8U-3, F11F-1 Tigercat, and F-100C. Don also flew support and photo flights. In his capacity as research pilot at the NASA Flight Research Center Don was assigned to NASA's Lockheed Jetstar General Purpose Airborne Simulator (GPAS). He flew all of the tests, with the majority being as project pilot. Mallick made a flight in the lightweight M2-F1 lifting body on January 30, 1964. In 1964, Don was assigned to and completed the USAF Test pilot school, Class 64A. Later in 1964, he flew as the co-project pilot on the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV) making over seventy\n\nJohn F. Fulton, Coccidioidomycosis, and Penicillin\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTager, Morris\n\n1976-01-01\n\nWhen the late Dr. John F. Fulton contracted severe pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in January, 1942, a metastatic lesion posed the threat of further progression and fatal dissemination. The possibility that an untested and generally unavailable antibiotic, penicillin, might be of value in Fulton's illness led his physician, Dr. John Bumstead, to appeal directly to Fulton to obtain this antibiotic, but ostensibly for the benefit of another patient succumbing to hemolytic streptococcal infection. While of no value for Fulton, penicillin was highly successful in the treatment of his other patient and soon of a second one with staphylococcal sepsis and pneumonia. This penicillin, administered in March, 1942, was the first clinical trial of penicillin under the control of the Office of Scientific Research and Development. The unique contribution of Dr. Fulton and of his illness to this event is described.

We define the classical and the generalized Horton laws for peak flows in rainfall-runoff events, which link self-similarity in network geomorphology with river basin hydrology. Both the Horton laws are tested in the Iowa River basin in eastern Iowa that drains an area of approximately 32â400âkm(2) before it joins the Mississippi River. The US Geological Survey continuously monitors the basin through 34 stream gauging stations. We select 51 rainfall-runoff events for carrying out the tests. Our findings support the existence of the classical and the generalized Horton laws for peak flows, which may be considered as a new hydrologic discovery. Three different methods are illustrated for estimating the Horton peak-flow ratio due to small sample size issues in peak flow data. We illustrate an application of the Horton laws for diagnosing parameterizations in a physical rainfall-runoff model. The ideas and developments presented here offer exciting new directions for hydrologic research and education.\n\n75 FR 41524 - Horton Manufacturing Company, LLC, Tallmadge, OH; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-07-16\n\n... employees of Horton Manufacturing Company, LLC and were not employees of either Wildcomm-Horton Partners...

The framework is based on a univariate regression model that leads to an alternative expression for Horton ratio, connects Horton regression statistics to distributional simple scaling, and improves the accuracy in estimating Horton plot parameters. The model is used to examine data for drainage area A and mainstream length L from two groups of basins located in different physiographic settings. Results show that confidence intervals for the Horton plot regression statistics are quite wide. Nonetheless, an analysis of covariance shows that regression intercepts, but not regression slopes, can be used to distinguish between basin groups. The univariate model is generalized to include n > 1 dependent variables. For the case where the dependent variables represent ln A and ln L, the generalized model performs somewhat better at distinguishing between basin groups than two separate univariate models. The generalized model leads to a modification of Hack's law where L depends on both A and Strahler order ??. Data show that ?? plays a statistically significant role in the modified Hack's law expression. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.\n\nHorton, pipe hydraulics, and the atmospheric boundary layer (The Robert E. Horton Memorial Lecture)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBrutsaert, Wilfried\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe early stages of Horton's scientific career which provided the opportunity and stimulus to delve into the origins of some contemporary concepts on the atmospheric boundary layer are reviewed. The study of Saph and Schoder provided basis for the experimental verification and validation of similarity by Blasius, Staton and Pannel, and for the subsequent developments that led to the present understanding of the turbulent boundary layer. Particular attention is given to incorporation of similarity and scaling in the analysis of turbulent flow.\n\n1987 Robert E. Horton Award to Thomas Dunne\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDunne, Thomas\n\nRobert Horton demonstrated in his seminal 1945 paper that physically based quantitative models for landscape evolution can be constructed by using predicted overland flow in a sediment transport equation for sheetwash. He envisioned drainage network evolution by infiltration-limited overland flow as a process of channel incision, network growth, and then abstraction to a stable channel network fed by hillslopes too short for channel initiation. Not until the work of Tom Dunne in the late 1960s in the Sleepers River watershed, Vermont, was it realized that overland flow, and consequently hillslope evolution, could occur by an entirely different mechanism than that proposed by Horton. Dunne showed that in certain predictable zones of the landscape, exfiltration from saturated grounds adds to precipitation on the soil surface to form what he later called saturation overland flow. Many researchers have since found that this form of overland flow occurs in humid and semiarid landscapes throughout the world. So clear is Dunne's contribution to defining this process that some refer to it as the âDunne mechanismâ to distinguish it from âHorton overland flow.â His work also documented unquestionably the applicability of the partial area concept in explaining runoff generation. Because of this work, his research in snowmelt runoff, and his subsequent authorship with Luna Leopold of the widely used book entitled Water in Environmental Planning, Dunne has established himself as a leader of process hydrology.\n\nYF-12 in flight\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1972-01-01\n\ninterceptor version was developed in 1963 under the designation YF-12A. A USAF reconnaissance variant, called the SR-71, was first flown in 1964. The A-12 and SR-71 designs included leading and trailing edges made of high-temperature fiberglass-asbestos laminates. The NASA YF-12 research program was ambitious; the aircraft flew an average of once a week unless down for extended maintenance or modification. Program expenses averaged $3.1 million per year just to run the flight tests. NASA crews for the YF-12 included pilots Fitzhugh Fulton and Donald Mallick, anf flight test engineers Victor Horton and Ray Young. Other NASA test pilots checked out in the YF-12A included John Manke, William Dana, Gary Krier, Einar Enevoldson, Tom McMurtry, Steve Ishmael, and Michael Swann. Except for its delivery and departure, the YF-12C was only flown by Fulton, Mallick, Horton, and Ray. It made 90 flights between 16 July 1971 and 22 December 1978.\n\nRevisiting Horton's laws with considerations of the directly drained VS source area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Soohyun; Paik, Kyungrock\n\n2015-04-01\n\nRiver networks have been regarded as excellent examples of self-similar patterns in nature. Fractal characteristics of river networks have been quantified through scaling relations between several morphologic variables (e.g., Hack, 1957; Flint, 1974). In particular, Horton's legendary study on scaling properties between numbers and lengths of streams in different orders (Horton, 1945) has significantly influenced research studies in this subject. Today, Horton's laws are referred to the log-linear relationships of three variables across stream orders, i.e., number, length, and area which is later added by Schumm (1956). In a closer look, there is a conceptual inconsistency between their definitions though. While length is defined as the length of stream of a specific order only, area by its definition includes drainage area of lower order streams. To deal with this inconsistency, there was an attempt to distinguish the average area drained directly by the stream of a particular order in the Hortonian formulation (Marani et al., 1991; Beer and Borgas, 1993). Nevertheless, there remains an interesting problem in the definition of directly drained area for 1st order and for the rest orders in these studies. While the whole area of 1st order stream is regarded as the directly drained area in these studies, for a channel to form it needs the minimum drainage area named source area. In this study, we evaluate how significant considering this zero order area separately is in understanding overall river network organization. To this end, we define new expression for the directly drained area and revisit Horton's laws with a generalized formulation. To test the proposed ideas, several river networks extracted from digital elevation models (DEMs) are analyzed. References Beer, T., & Borgas, M. (1993).

The advantages of developing distributed or semi-distributed models have currently been made clear. Now the importance of using continuous distributed modeling emerges. A proper schematization of the infiltration process is vital to these types of models. Many popular infiltration schemes, reliable and easy to implement, are too simplistic for the development of continuous hydrologic models. On the other hand, the unavailability of detailed and descriptive information on soil properties often limits the implementation of complete infiltration schemes. In this work, a combination between the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method (SCS-CN) and a method derived from Horton equation is proposed in order to overcome the inherent limits of the two schemes. The SCS-CN method is easily applicable on large areas, but has structural limitations. The Horton-like methods present parameters that, though measurable to a point, are difficult to achieve a reliable estimate at catchment scale. The objective of this work is to overcome these limits by proposing a calibration procedure which maintains the large applicability of the SCS-CN method as well as the continuous description of the infiltration process given by the Horton's equation suitably modified. The estimation of the parameters of the modified Horton method is carried out using a formal analogy with the SCS-CN method under specific conditions. Some applications, at catchment scale within a distributed model, are presented.\n\nMaladie de Horton rÃ©vÃ©lÃ©e par une dyspnÃ©e\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMahfoudhi, Madiha; Mamlouk, Habiba; Turki, Sami; Kheder, Adel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLes manifestations pleuro-pulmonaires de la maladie de Horton sont rares et peu connues.

Verhaart had easy access to primate brains in Batavia and stayed at Fulton's lab as a Rockefeller fellow (1938-1939), learning techniques of surgery and histology of the primate brain in order to apply it in his own lab. The correspondence relates of their undertakings in research, the preparations for Verhaart's stay in New Haven, the failure of subsequent research plans because of World War II, the camp experiences in Asia by Verhaart, the period of restoration after the war, helped by Fulton, and the political changes (independence) in Indonesia that finally lead to Verhaart's return to the Netherlands in 1950, where he became professor of histology and Director of the Neurological Institute at Leiden University. The correspondence shows how neuroscientists from different parts of the world cooperated. Moreover it is an example of the gradual change from a German (like his teacher Winkler) to an Anglo-American orientation in medical science that started in the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\nF-18 chase craft with NASA test pilots Schneider and Fulton\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1992-01-01\n\nEd Schneider, (left), is the project pilot for the F-18 High Angle of Attack program at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California.

In addition to his assignment with the F-18 High Angle of Attack program, Schneider is a project pilot for the F-15B aeronautical research aircraft, the NASA NB-52B launch aircraft, and the SR-71 'Blackbird' aircraft. He is a Fellow and was the 1994 President of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. In 1996 he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. Schneider is seen here with Fitzhugh L. Fulton Jr., (right), who was a civilian research pilot at Dryden. from August 1, 1966, until July 3, 1986, following 23 years of service as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force. Fulton was the project pilot on all early tests of the 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) used to air launch the Space Shuttle prototype Enterprise in the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) at Dryden in l977. For his work in the ALT program, Fulton received NASA's Exceptional Service Medal. He also received the Exceptional Service Medal again in 1983 for flying the 747 SCA during the European tour of the Space Shuttle Enterprise. During his career at Dryden, Fulton was project pilot on NASA's NB-52B launch aircraft used to air launch a variety of piloted and unpiloted research aircraft, including the X-15s and lifting bodies. He flew the XB-70 prototype supersonic bomber on both NASA-USAF tests and NASA research flights during the late 1960s, attaining speeds exceeding Mach 3. He was also a project pilot on the YF-12A and YF-12C research program from April 14, 1969, until September 25, 1978. The F/A-18 Hornet seen behind them is used primarily as a safety chase and support aircraft at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif. As support aircraft, the F-18's are used for safety chase, pilot proficiency and aerial photography.

It was replaced by the so-called YF-12C (SR-71A 61-7951, modified with YF-12A inlets and engines and a bogus tail number 06937). The Lockheed A-12 family, known as the Blackbirds, were designed by Clarence 'Kelly' Johnson. They were constructed mostly of titanium to withstand aerodynamic heating. Fueled by JP-7, the Blackbirds were capable of cruising at Mach 3.2 and attaining altitudes in excess of 80,000 feet. The first version, a CIA reconnaissance aircraft that first flew in April 1962 was called the A-12. An interceptor version was developed in 1963 under the designation YF-12A. A USAF reconnaissance variant, called the SR-71, was first flown in 1964. The A-12 and SR-71 designs included leading and trailing edges made of high-temperature fiberglass-asbestos laminates. The NASA YF-12 research program was ambitious; the aircraft flew an average of once a week unless down for extended maintenance or modification. Program expenses averaged $3.1 million per year just to run the flight tests.

Cooley defines transportation as a spatial and physical form of communication. He also develops a interactionist theory of valuation and articulates that value as an end of action is shaped an d transformed by communication and interaction. These insights suggest that transportation as a form of communication will change and develop economic society through transforming personal desires and values so as to change behaviours. Cooley's theory implies that an interactionist approach is useful for understanding the subjective side of phenomena of transportation.\n\nA 10-year epidemiologic review of homicide cases in children younger than 5 years in Fulton County, GA: 1996-2005.\n\nPubMed\n\nFajardo, Geroncio Cagigas; Hanzlick, Randy L\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe primary purpose of this study was to present the epidemiologic review of homicide deaths certified by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2005 in children younger than 5 years. The secondary purpose of this study was to determine if the observed cases of homicide deaths among children younger than 5 years in Fulton County are significantly greater than expected when compared with those in the State of Georgia. For purposes of this study, only homicide deaths of Fulton County residents were included. The authors reviewed all homicide cases in children younger than 5 years: infancy (<1 year) and early childhood (1-4 years). Ï values were calculated using Epi Info (version 3.4.1; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga) to determine differences in homicide among age group, race, and sex variables. In addition, a Ï test at the Î± level of 0.05 was done to determine if the observed cases of homicide deaths among children younger than 5 years in Fulton County were significantly greater than expected when compared with those in the State of Georgia. There were 49 homicide cases in children younger than 5 years identified over this 10-year period. The yearly distribution of these 49 homicide deaths ranged from 1 death in 2003 to 9 deaths in 2004. Most of the patients were male (n=29, 59.2%) and black (n=44, 89.8%). Between infancy and early childhood cases, homicide victims were nearly equally divided between the 2 groups. However, Ï values showed that decedents younger than 5 years are more likely to have died of homicide compared with decedents 5 years or older (odds ratio [OR], 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-2.35). Black decedents younger than 5 years are more likely to have died of homicide compared with other races (OR, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.21-9.28). Male and female decedents are equally at risk to have died of homicide (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.61-2.11).

Many such deaths, especially those that involve external causes such as injury and poisoning, are amenable to prevention. Characterizing the causes and circumstances of nonnatural childhood deaths may provide information that is useful for development of prevention strategies and programs. This is a retrospective review of all nonnatural deaths investigated and certified by the Fulton County Medical Examiner involving persons 10 to 19 years of age during the years 1985-2004, inclusive. Cases were identified by searching electronic death investigation files maintained during the study period. Demographic and circumstantial information were tabulated for homicides, suicides, motor-vehicle fatalities, and other accidental deaths, and crude death rates were calculated for each 5-year period during the study. During the 20 year period there were 961 nonnatural deaths among persons 10 to 19 years of age. Most deaths were due to homicide (48%) followed by motor-vehicle fatalities (30%), suicide (12%), and nontraffic accidental fatalities (10%). Black males had the highest death rates among the homicide, suicide, and nontraffic accidental deaths, although the rates for each of these were lower in the most recent 5 year period than the first 5-year period. The number of deaths increased in each category as age increased, and this observation was most marked for homicides and least marked for nontraffic accidental deaths. Firearms were involved in 88% of homicides and 61% of suicides. Most nontraffic accidental deaths were due to water-related accidents, followed by drug and/or alcohol toxicity, fire-related injuries, and accidental firearms injuries. Homicide accounts for almost half of all deaths among persons 10 to 19 years of age. Black males are at particularly high risk for nonnatural death in comparison with other race/sex groups\n\nHutton to Horton: views of sequence, progression and equilibrium in geomorphology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKennedy, Barbara A.\n\n1992-08-01\n\nThe papers by Strahler (1952) and Chorley (1962) strongly advocated the adoption of a \"dynamic\" as opposed to an \"historical\" approach to geomorphology. The opinion of some later workersânotably Simpson (1963) and Mayr (1982) âis, however, that any advance in the historical natural sciences depends upon the combined appreciation of immanent and configurational elements (Simpson's terminology); and the view that events may have an essential historical or timebound component is now accepted even in \"experimental\" sciences such as chemistry (Prigogine, 1978). In the light of these contrasting approaches to earth science, an attempt is made to analyse the mjor lines of thought concerning change, progression and equilibrium in the work of six leading precursors of modern geomorphology: James Hutton, Charles Lyell, Charles Darwin, James Dwight Dana, Grove Karl Gilbert and Robert E. Horton. Despite their perceived general adherence to the Uniformitarian tradition, it is suggested that the work of the six reveals two contrasting attitudes to ideas of change and of equilibrium, It is argued that those authors â Lyell, Dana, Hortonâwho are primarily concerned to demonstrate that the present state of the earth is in some sense the normal or optimum, tend at the same time to accept the existence or desirability of some equilibrium state and, paradoxically, to overstate the role of \"unusual\", \"cataclysmic\" or \"catastrophic\" events in creating and sustaining this equilibrium. The views of Horton, in particular, lend themselves to the description \"punctuated equilibrium\". In contrast, it is contended that Hutton, Darwin and Gilbert have no ideological commitment to the present state of the earth as anything other than one moment in time. Their ideas are considered to focus upon the entire sequence of changes which may be inferred to create the phenomena viewed at any time or place. As a consequence, the concept of equilibrium has only a minor role in the works of these\n\nHealth Education Needs: A Survey of Rural Adults in Fulton County, Pennsylvania, 1975. An Interim Report.

(see record 2011-23134-001). Based on their meta-analytic review of the correlates of the two factors of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI), Fearless Dominance (FD) and Self-Centered Impulsivity (SCI), Marcus, Fulton, and Edens (this issue, pp. 70-79) raise important questions about the role of FD in diagnostic conceptualizations of psychopathy. In considering their findings, general limitations of metaanalyses (e.g., Ioannidis & Lau, 1999) should be borne in mind, along with specific limitations of their analysis. These limitations are discussed here.\n\nScale Invariant Power Laws Capture the 3-D Coupling Between Water, Energy and Carbon Budgets Across River Basins of Increasing Horton-Strahler Orders in the Andes-Amazon System\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPoveda, G.; Zapata, A. F.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe Andes-Amazon system exhibits complex interactions and feedbacks between hydrological, ecological, biogeochemical and climatic factors in a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. We aim to understand the coupling existing between water, energy and carbon budgets in the Andes-Amazon system, by performing a systematic study of the system for river basins of increasing Horton-Strahler orders, from the headwaters of the Amazon River basin along the Andes (order Ï=1 river sub-basins) to the low-lying larger river sub-basins (order Ï=10). To that end, this works introduces a 3-D generalization of the Budyko framework that aims to link the water, energy, and Carbon budgets in river basins. The newly proposed 3-D non-dimensional space is defined by: (1) the ratio between long-term mean values of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) and Precipitation (P), Î±=AET/P, representing the water balance; (2) the ratio between AET and Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), Î²=AET/PET, representing the energy balance; and (3) the ratio between AET and Aboveground Net Primary Productivity, Î´=AET/ANPP, representing the carbon budget. We use a 3\" Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which allows defining river basins with Horton-Strahler orders from 1 to 10. The long-term water, energy, and carbon budgets are estimated for increasing values of the Horton-Strahler orders during the period 1987-2007. Data sets pertaining to the water balance come from ORE-HYBAM, potential evapotranspiration (PET) from GLEAM (Global Land-surface Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology). Data for the energy budget are from the Surface Radiation Budget (SRB). Data for the Carbon budget (annual mean net primary productivity, ANPP, gross primary productivity, GPP, and respiration rates, Rr, come from AMAZALERT and ORCHEDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms), as well as from Flux Tower Data and the LBA project.

During rain of fluctuating intensity, ponding deepens and dissipates, and the drivers of soil infiltration, including sorptivity, fluctuate in value. This has been explored on dryland soils in the field, using small plots and rainfall simulation, involving repeated changes in intensity as well as short and long hiatuses in rainfall. The field area was the Fowlers Gap Arid Zone Research Station, in western NSW, Australia. The field experiments used multiple 60 minute design rainfall events that all had the same total depth and average rainfall intensity, but which included intensity bursts at various positions within the event. These were based on the character of local rainfall events in the field area. Infiltration was found from plot runoff rates measured every 2 minutes, and rainfall intensities that were adjusted by computer-controlled pumps at 1 second intervals. Data were analysed by fitting a family of affine Horton equations, all having the same final infiltrability (about 6-7 mm/h) but having initial infiltrabilities and exponential decay constants that were permitted to recover during periods of very low intensity rain, or rainfall hiatuses. Results show that the terms in the Horton equation, f0, fc, and Kf, can all be estimated from field data of the kind collected. This is a considerable advance over 'steady-state' rainfall simulation methods, which typically only allow the estimation of the final infiltrability fc. This may rarely be reached owing to the occurrence of short rainfall events, or to changing intensity under natural rainfall, that prohibits the establishment of steady-state infiltration and runoff. Importantly, this method allows a focus on the recovery of infiltrability during periods of reduced rainfall intensity. Recovery of infiltrability is shown\n\nAccidental drug deaths in Fulton County, Georgia, 2002: characteristics, case management and certification issues.\n\nPubMed\n\nGraham, Jason K; Hanzlick, Randy\n\n2008-09-01\n\nHistorically, the duty of the medical examiner in assigning cause and manner of death in drug-related death cases has been fraught with controversial challenges. The lack of standardization in certifying drug-related deaths may involve differences among practicing forensic pathologists in their approach to such cases. The central objectives of the present study include characterization of current drug death patterns and the variability among medical examiners with respect to autopsy performance and death certification practices in one county medical examiner's office. Death certificates, scene information/investigative reports, autopsy reports, and toxicological laboratory results for each of the 100 cases of drug-related death occurring in 2002 in Fulton County, Georgia were reviewed. Comparison of overall autopsy rates and autopsy rates in drug-related death cases for each medical examiner individually and for the group collectively was performed. In examining cocaine-related deaths (most common), statistical analysis was performed for comparison of drug concentrations (cocaine and benzoylecgonine) between deaths certified as cocaine toxicity (poisoning) versus cocaine-complicating disease or causing an adverse event such as cerebral hemorrhage. Causes of accidental drug deaths included cocaine 40%, mixed drug intoxication 37%, opioids 10%, ethanol 7%, and prescription medication (nonopioid) 5%. Overall total autopsy rates in 2002 for each of the 6 independent medical examiners ranged from 51% to 69% (mean 64%), whereas autopsy rates in drug-related death ranged from 55% to 91% (mean 81%). In review of the subset of 40 cocaine-related deaths, 25% were certified as cocaine toxicity (poisoning), with the remaining 75% certified as cocaine-complicating disease or causing and adverse event. Autopsy rates in cocaine-related deaths were as follows: cocaine toxicity 80%, cocaine-complicating disease 77.3%, and cocaine causing adverse event 62.5%.

The remains were recovered mostly from ca. 170-260 cm below the current land surface in marl overlain by peat and peaty marl. The stratigraphy of the site indicates that the remains were deposited in a small, open-water pond that subsequently filled. The skeleton, which is 41-48% complete, is that of a mature female, ca. 30-34 y old at death based on dental eruption and wear. Postcranial bone measurements indicate that this individual was relatively large for a female. Radiocarbon dating of wood from under the pelvis of the mastodon provided a maximum date of 12,575 ? 260 14C y BP [15,550-13,850 cal y BP] for the animal, which is up to 2575 14C y before the species is believed to have become extinct. Pollen samples from the site corroborate the interpretation that the regional climate was cooler and more humid than at present and supported a mixed spruce-deciduous parkland assemblage. The relatively small size of the molars of this and other mastodons from Indiana supports the hypothesis that late-glacial mastodons - just prior to their extinction - were smaller in size relative to earlier, full-glacial conspecifics. The relationship between molar size and body size is not clear, however, and there may be geographical factors as well as a temporal influence to size variation in these animals.\n\nSpatial Information Technology Center at Fulton-Montgomery Community College\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe Spatial Information Technology Center (SITC) at Fulton-Montgomery Community College (FMCC) continued to fulfill its mission and charter by successfully completing its fourth year of operations under Congressional funding and NASA sponsorship.

The bacterial endospores need a staining which can penetrate wall thickness of spore bacteria. A method of endospores staining is Schaeffer Fulton method that used Malachite Green. It is an alkaline substance staining that can staining the spore bacteria. In this research, it have found the alternative staining that can replace Malachite Green solution in spore bacterial stain. The alternative staining used is Methylene Blue solution (0,5 %, 0,7%, and 1% concentration) with pH variation (10, 11, and 12), and varyous heating time (3, 4, and 5 minutes). The all treatments staining have been effect on bacterial spores staining results. The warming time greatly affect the dye to penetrate the walls of bacterial spores, this can be seen in the results with various concentration at pH 10, indicates that the not long warm-up time 3 and 4 minutes, bacterial spores are not stained, while in the longer heating time is 5 minutes bacterial spores stained. This is caused because the longer heating time can make the pores of spore wall is open so that can facilitate the dye to get into the bacterial spores.\n\nMelvin Burke, Ike Gillam, Fitz Fulton, and Deke Slayton give the Space Shuttle Columbia a humorous sendoff before it's ferry flight back to KSC in Florida\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1981-04-28\n\nAfter completing it's first orbital mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base on April 14, 1981, Space Shuttle Columbia received a humorous sendoff before it's ferry flight atop a modified 747 back to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The illocutionary act of publishing his critique stands as an effort to project the image of Mead's intellectual self and enhance his standing among sociologists within and outside the orbit of the University of Chicago. It expressed Mead's ambivalence toward his precursor Cooley, whose influence he never fully acknowledged. In addition, it typifies the contending fractal distinctions of the scientifically discursive versus literary styles of Mead and Cooley, who both founded the interpretive sociological tradition. The contrasting styles and attitudes toward writing of the two figures are discussed, and their implications for the problems of scale that have stymied the symbolic interactionist tradition are explored.\n\n1988 Horton Medal presented to Peter S.

The reason is simple: there is no one in the world who better represents the standards of excellence that a hydrologist hopes to achieve and that hydrologists hope our discipline will attain than Peter Eagleson.Pete did not start his research career in hydrology. In fact, his Ph.D. thesis in 1956 and his research up to 1965 were mainly in the field of sediment sorting and transport by waves on beaches. During this period he also investigated problems related to flow-induced vibrations of plates. His research in these areas was extremely successful, producing three chapters in books and about 20 journal papers in addition to many technical reports and journal discussions. Indeed, Pete had made his mark in wave theory and sediment transport, but it was good fortune for our field that starting about 1964 his interest in hydrology overcame all his past experience and assured a reputation in the waves and sediment field, and thus he embarked on a new adventureâbringing into hydrology the scientific rigor that existed in more academically established disciplines. With his strong fluid mechanics backgroundâhe still teaches that subject to undergraduates at MITâPete was ideally suited to lead the field toward new problems and also toward new approaches to old problems . . . and this he did indeed! Just in 1967 he and his students published six papers, most of them in Water Resources Research, which had a strong, an almost immediate impact on the field of hydrology. Here was somebody who was tackling the modeling of overland flow with the scientific standards of fluid mechanics. At the same time, finally somebody had\n\nModeling of road traffic noise and estimated human exposure in Fulton County, Georgia, USA.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeong, Jeong C; Park, Tae H; Ko, Joon H; Chang, Seo I; Kim, Minho; Holt, James B; Mehdi, Mohammed R\n\n2011-11-01\n\nEnvironmental noise is a major source of public complaints. Noise in the community causes physical and socio-economic effects and has been shown to be related to adverse health impacts. Noise, however, has not been actively researched in the United States compared with the European Union countries in recent years. In this research, we aimed at modeling road traffic noise and analyzing human exposure in Fulton County, Georgia, United States. We modeled road traffic noise levels using the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration Traffic Noise Model implemented in SoundPLANÂ®. After analyzing noise levels with raster, vector and faÃ§ade maps, we estimated human exposure to high noise levels. Accurate digital elevation models and building heights were derived from Light Detection And Ranging survey datasets and building footprint boundaries. Traffic datasets were collected from the Georgia Department of Transportation and the Atlanta Regional Commission. Noise level simulation was performed with 62 computers in a distributed computing environment. Finally, the noise-exposed population was calculated using geographic information system techniques. Results show that 48% of the total county population [N=870,166 residents] is potentially exposed to 55 dB(A) or higher noise levels during daytime. About 9% of the population is potentially exposed to 67 dB(A) or higher noises. At nighttime, 32% of the population is expected to be exposed to noise levels higher than 50 dB(A). This research shows that large-scale traffic noise estimation is possible with the help of various organizations. We believe that this research is a significant stepping stone for analyzing community health associated with noise exposures in the United States. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Bruce Peterson was scheduled to take over as the M2-F1 project pilot from Milt Thompson, while Don Mallick was to be his backup. Col. (later Brig. Gen.) Charles (Chuck) Yeager, then commandant of the Air Force's Aerospace Research Pilots School, wanted to evaluate a possible lifting-body trainer for the school. This photo shows all of these distinguished pilots on or in the M2-F1, with Col. Yeager in the pilot's seat. The lifting body concept evolved in the mid-1950s as researchers considered alternatives to ballistic reentries of piloted space capsules. The designs for hypersonic, wingless vehicles were on the boards at NASA Ames and NASA Langley facilities, while the US Air Force was gearing up for its Dyna-Soar program, which defined the need for a spacecraft that would land like an airplane. Despite favorable research on lifting bodies, there was little support for a flight program. Dryden engineer R. Dale Reed was intrigued with the lifting body concept, and reasoned that some sort of flight demonstration was needed before wingless aircraft could be taken seriously. In February 1962, he built a model lifting body based upon the Ames M2 design, and air-launched it from a radio controlled 'mothership.' Home movies of these flights, plus the support of research pilot Milt Thompson, helped pursuade the facilities director, Paul Bikle, to give the go-ahead for the construction of a full-scale version, to be used as a wind-tunnel model and possibly flown as a glider. Comparing lifting bodies to space capsules, an unofficial motto of the project was, 'Don't be Rescued from Outer Space--Fly Back in Style.' The construction of the M2-F1 was a joint effort by Dryden and a local glider manufacturer, the Briegleb Glider Company. The budget was $30,000. NASA craftsmen and engineers built the tubular steel interior frame.

The LGM is largely characterized by grasslands and xerophytic herbs dominated open habitats. Arid-LGM punctuated climatic ameliorations, which took place in short episodes. Humans appear to have reached the HP ecosystem after 18,000 cal yrs BP occasionally. The first Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) induced changes in South West Monsoon (SWM) rains occurred at low latitudes between 16,200 and 15,900 cal yrs BP suggesting an onset of monsoon rains. After this event, monsoon rains weakened for several millennia except the period 13,700-13,000 cal yrs BP, but human activity seems to have continued with biomass burning and clearances by slash and burn. Very large size grass pollen grains, which are morphologically similar to pollen from closer forms of Oryza nivara, were found after 13,800 cal yrs BP. Early Holocene extreme and abrupt climate changes seem to have promoted the forms of O. nivara populations in association with humans. New data from the HP would therefore be most interesting to investigate the dispersal and use of domesticated rice in South Asia.\n\nNatural Gas Hydrates Estimation Using Seismic Inversion and Rock Physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDutta, N.; Dai, J.; Kleinberg, R.; Xu, H.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nGas hydrate drilling worldwide indicates that the formation of gas hydrates in shallow sediments tends to increase P- and S-wave velocities of the hosting rocks. Rock physics models of gas hydrates provide the links between velocity anomalies and gas hydrate concentration. In this abstract, we evaluate the numerical predictions of some of the major rock physics models of gas hydrates and validate those with well log data from the Mallik and Blake Ridge wells. We find that a model in which the gas hydrate is a part of the rock framework produces results that are consistent with well log data. To enhance the accuracy of seismic estimation, we adopt a five-step, integrated workflow that enables us to identify and quantify gas hydrates in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM). It includes: 1) Reprocessing conventional 3D seismic data at high resolution using an amplitude-preserving flow with prestack time migration, 2) A detailed stratigraphic evaluation to identify potential hydrate zones, 3) Seismic attribute analysis to further delineate anomalous zones, 4) Full waveform prestack inversion to characterize acoustic properties of gas hydrates in 1D (Mallick, 1995; Mallick, 1999) and map in 3D using hybrid inversion techniques (Dutta, 2002; Mallick and Dutta, 2002), and 5) Quantitative estimation of gas hydrate saturation using rock property models. We illustrate the procedure using 3D seismic data, and estimate gas hydrate saturation in the study area in the GOM.\n\nEffect of solute immobilization on the stability problem within the fractional model in the solute analog of the Horton-Rogers-Lapwood problem.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlimenko, Lyudmila S; Maryshev, Boris S\n\n2017-11-24\n\nThe paper is devoted to the linear stability analysis within the solute analogue of the Horton-Rogers-Lapwood (HRL) problem. The solid nanoparticles are treated as solute within the continuous approach. Therefore, we consider the infinite horizontal porous layer saturated with a mixture (carrier fluid and solute). Solute transport in porous media is very often complicated by solute immobilization on a solid matrix of porous media. Solute immobilization (solute sorption) is taken into account within the fractal model of the MIM approach. According to this model a solute in porous media immobilizes within random time intervals and the distribution of such random variable does not have a finite mean value, which has a good agreement with some experiments. The solute concentration difference between the layer boundaries is assumed as constant. We consider two cases of horizontal external filtration flux: constant and time-modulated. For the constant flux the system of equations that determines the frequency of neutral oscillations and the critical value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number is derived. Neutral curves of the critical parameters on the governing parameters are plotted. Stability maps are obtained numerically in a wide range of parameters of the system. We have found that taking immobilization into account leads to an increase in the critical value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number with an increase in the intensity of the external filtration flux. The case of weak time-dependent external flux is investigated analytically. We have shown that the modulated external flux leads to an increase in the critical value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number and a decrease in the critical wave number. For moderate time-dependent filtration flux the differential equation with Caputo fractional derivatives has been obtained for the description of the behavior near the convection instability threshold. This equation is analyzed numerically by the Floquet method; the parametric excitation of\n\n75 FR 22610 - Pennsylvania; Major Disaster and Related Determinations\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-04-29\n\n..., Dauphin, Delaware, Fayette, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Juniata, Lancaster, Lebanon..., Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Juniata, Lancaster, Lebanon, Perry, Philadelphia, Somerset, Westmoreland..., Dauphin, Delaware, Fayette, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Juniata, Lancaster, Lebanon...\n\n75 FR 73969 - Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Extension of Attainment Date for the Atlanta...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-11-30\n\n..., Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Hall, Henry, Newton, Paulding...

Two steeply to moderately dipping stratigraphic packages are recognized: one involving Horton and lower Windsor groups (Tournasian-Visean); the other involving upper Windsor and Mabou (Visean-Namurian) groups. Also anomalous on Isle Madame are three long narrow belts of \"basement\" rocks, together with voluminous chloritic microbreccia and minor semi-ductile mylonite, which are separated from the conglomerate-dominated successions by faults. The angular relations between the cataclastic rocks and the conglomerate units, combined with the presence of cataclasite clasts in the conglomerate units and evidence of dip-slip faults within the basin, suggest an extensional setting, where listric normal faults outline detachment allochthons. Allochthon geometry requires two stages of extension, the older stage completed in early Windsor Group time and including most of the island, and the more local younger stage completed in Mabou Group time. Domino-style upper-plate faulting in the younger stage locally repeated the older detachment relation of basement and conglomerate to form the observed narrow belts. Re-rotation of older successions in the younger stage also locally overturned the Horton Group. These features developed within a broad zone of Carboniferous dextral transcurrent faulting between already-docked Avalon and Meguma terranes. Sites of transpression and transtension alternated along the Cobequid-Chedabucto fault zone that separated these terranes. The earlier extensional features in Isle Madame likely represent the northern headwall and associated clastic debris of a pull-apart or other type of transtensional basin developed along part of this fault zone that had become listric; they were repeated and exposed by being up-ended in the second stage of extension, also on listric faults.

V.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Tokunaga self-similarity has proven to be an important constraint for the observed river networks. Notably, various Horton laws are naturally satisfied by the Tokunaga networks, which makes this model of considerable interest for theoretical analysis and modeling of environmental transport. Recall that Horton self-similarity is a weaker property of a tree graph that addresses its principal branching; it is a counterpart of the power-law size distribution for system's elements. The stronger Tokunaga self-similarity addresses so-called side branching; it ensures that different levels of a hierarchy have the same probabilistic structure (in a sense that can be rigorously defined). We describe an improved statistical framework for testing self-similarity in a finite tree and estimating the related parameters. The developed inference is applied to the major river basins in continental United States and Iberian Peninsula. The results demonstrate the validity of the Tokunaga model for the majority of the examined networks with very narrow (universal) range of parameter values. Next, we explore possible relationships between the Tokunaga parameter anomalies (deviations from the universal values) and climatic and geomorphologic characteristics of a region. Finally, we apply the Tokunaga model to explore vulnerability of river networks, defined via reaction of the river discharge to a storm.\n\nOPAL Netlogo Land Condition Model\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2014-08-15\n\nER D C/ CE RL T R- 14 -1 2 Optimal Allocation of Land for Training and Non-training Uses ( OPAL ) OPAL Netlogo Land Condition Model...Fulton, Natalie Myers, Scott Tweddale, Dick Gebhart, Ryan Busby, Anne Dain-Owens, and Heidi Howard August 2014 OPAL team measuring above and...online library at http://acwc.sdp.sirsi.net/client/default.

However, when these operations are applied in commercial recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) using standard lighting technology, sexual maturation is not suppressed. In this study, an L9 (33) orthogonal design was used to determine the effects of three factors (spectral composition, photoperiod, and light intensity) on the gonadal development of Atlantic salmon in RAS. We demonstrated that the photoperiod at the tested levels had a much greater effect on the gonadosomatic index and female Fulton condition factor than spectral composition and light intensity. The photoperiod had a significant effect on the secretion of sex steroids and melatonin ( P<0.05), and a short photoperiod delayed sex steroid and melatonin level increases. The three test factors had no significant effects on the survival rate, specific growth rate, relative weight gain, and male Fulton condition factor ( P>0.05). The optimum lighting levels in female and male Atlantic salmon were LD 8:16, 455 nm (or 625 nm), 8.60 W/m2; and LD 8:16, 8.60 W/m2, 455 nm respectively. These conditions not only delayed gonadal development, but also had no negative effects on Atlantic salmon growth in RAS. These results demonstrate that a combination of spectral composition, photoperiod and light intensity is effective at delaying the gonadal development of both male and female salmon in RAS.\n\nLong-Term Interactions of Streamflow Generation and River Basin Morphology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, X.; Niemann, J.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nIt is well known that the spatial patterns and dynamics of streamflow generation processes depend on river basin topography, but the impact of streamflow generation processes on the long-term evolution of river basins has not drawn as much attention. Fluvial erosion processes are driven by streamflow, which can be produced by Horton runoff, Dunne runoff, and groundwater discharge. In this analysis, we hypothesize that the dominant streamflow generation process in a basin affects the spatial patterns of fluvial erosion and that the nature of these patterns changes for storm events with differing return periods. Furthermore, we hypothesize that differences in the erosion patterns modify the topography over the long term in a way that promotes and/or inhibits the other streamflow generation mechanisms. In order to test these hypotheses, a detailed hydrologic model is imbedded into an existing landscape evolution model. Precipitation events are simulated with a Poisson process and have random intensities and durations. The precipitation is partitioned between Horton runoff and infiltration to groundwater using a specified infiltration capacity. Groundwater flow is described by a two-dimensional Dupuit equation for a homogeneous, isotropic, unconfined aquifer with an irregular underlying impervious layer. Dunne runoff occurs when precipitation falls on locations where the water table reaches the land surface. The combined hydrologic/geomorphic model is applied to the WE-38 basin, an experimental watershed in Pennsylvania that has substantial available hydrologic data. First, the hydrologic model is calibrated to reproduce the observed streamflow for 1990 using the observed rainfall as the input. Then, the relative roles of Horton runoff, Dunne runoff, and groundwater discharge are controlled by varying the infiltration capacity of the soil. For each infiltration capacity, the hydrologic and geomorphic behavior of the current topography is analyzed and the long\n\nAttention selectively modulates cortical entrainment in different regions of the speech spectrum\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaltzell, Lucas S.; Horton, Cort; Shen, Yi; Richards, Virginia M.; D'Zmura, Michael; Srinivasan, Ramesh\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRecent studies have uncovered a neural response that appears to track the envelope of speech, and have shown that this tracking process is mediated by attention. It has been argued that this tracking reflects a process of phase-locking to the fluctuations of stimulus energy, ensuring that this energy arrives during periods of high neuronal excitability. Because all acoustic stimuli are decomposed into spectral channels at the cochlea, and this spectral decomposition is maintained along the ascending auditory pathway and into auditory cortex, we hypothesized that the overall stimulus envelope is not as relevant to cortical processing as the individual frequency channels; attention may be mediating envelope tracking differentially across these spectral channels. To test this we reanalyzed data reported by Horton et al. (2013), where high-density EEG was recorded while adults attended to one of two competing naturalistic speech streams. In order to simulate cochlear filtering, the stimuli were passed through a gammatone filterbank, and temporal envelopes were extracted at each filter output. Following Horton et al. (2013), the attended and unattended envelopes were cross-correlated with the EEG, and local maxima were extracted at three different latency ranges corresponding to distinct peaks in the cross-correlation function (N1, P2, and N2). We found that the ratio between the attended and unattended cross-correlation functions varied across frequency channels in the N1 latency range, consistent with the hypothesis that attention differentially modulates envelope-tracking activity across spectral channels.

F.; Quintero, F.; Ghimire, G.; Rojas, M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Iowa Flood Center (IFC) provides streamflow forecasts for about 2000 locations in Iowa using a real-time distributed hydrologic model, forced with radar and raingage rainfall information. The model structure is based on ordinary differential equations that represent the flow of water from the hillslopes to the channels of the river network. The formulation of the routing of water across the rivers constitutes a fundamental aspect of the model, because this component is mostly responsible for providing estimates of the time-to-peak and peak magnitude. The routing model structure of the system is based on the scaling properties of river velocity with the discharge and drainage area of the channel, which can be written in terms of a power-law function. This study examines how this scaling relation is connected to the Horton-Strahler order of the channel network. This evaluation represents a step forward towards formulating model structures that are based on characteristics that are invariant across spatial scales. We proposed a routing model for every different Horton orders of the network, by adjusting a power-law function to available observations of velocity and discharge provided by USGS. The models were implemented into the Hillslope-Link Model (HLM) of the IFC for offline evaluation. Model simulations were compared to discharge observations to assess their performance, and compared to simulations obtained with other hydrologic routing schemes, to determine if the new formulation improves performance of the model.\n\nA Representation of an Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph From Geomorphology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGupta, Vijay K.; Waymire, Ed; Wang, C.
