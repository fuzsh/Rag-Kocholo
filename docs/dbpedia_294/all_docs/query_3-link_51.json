In this sense, the refining industry can make its contribution by reformulating high-octane petrol fuel. The impact of this type of gasoline from CO2 emission balance, technical feasibility, and economics standpoints has recently been assessed by the petroleum industry with promising results, and new potential boosters that could improve the octane number of standard gasoline are more needed than ever. The present work summarizes a comprehensive review aimed at collecting available data regarding chemical molecules that can be used in advanced gasoline formulations for modern spark-ignited car engines focusing on ash-free technologies. Potential boosters are divided into two categories: high-octane gasoline components and octane enhancer additives, with 2 vol % the considered frontier concentration between them. Targeted chemical compounds examined in the screening for high-octane components include isoparaffins, olefins, aromatics, alcohols, ethers, esters, ketones, furans, and carbonates. Chemical families assessed as additives were anilines, hydrazines, amines, pyridines, quinolines, indoles, N-nitrosamines, iodine compounds, selenium compounds, phenols, formates, oxalates, and, in lesser extension, other families. The scope of the analysis includes not only anti-knock effectiveness but also associated side effects for the engine, possible effects on both human health and the environment, current applications, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, among others. Promising opportunities in the medium- and long-terms for every family of chemical compounds that can potentially improve the anti-knock character of modern gasolines well beyond current specifications worldwide are presented. Furthermore, a few chemical families are identified as the most promising ones to be used in future gasoline formulations, either as high-octane components (such as ethers, ketones, and esters) or as octane booster additives (such as anilines, N-nitrosamines, and phenols).",

        "text": "As is known, vehicle efficiency is a key factor for competitiveness that can contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and acceleration of the decarbonization of the road transport sector. The refining industry could help achieve this goal by the formulation of high-octane petrol (HOP). The impact of this type of gasoline from CO2 emission balance, the technical feasibility of its production in the EU refining system, and economic standpoints have been theoretically assessed by Concawe (Environmental Science for European Refining, an association of companies that operate petroleum refineries in the EU) with promising results. For instance, when compared to standard 95- and 98-grade gasoline, one can observe that an optimized engine operating with a high compression ratio presents a 1% engine efficiency increase per 1 point of research octane number (RON) increase, with a reduction in CO2 emissions. (1,2) A recent engine modeling and vehicle study also carried out by Concawe has confirmed that the thermal efficiency and tailpipe pollutant emissions benefits previously predicted could be attributed to the use of HOPs in spark-ignited (SI) engines. (3) A newly designed high-octane rating fuel (Efitec 100 Neotech, an additivated gasoline) has been already launched successfully to the market. (4) This fuel not only reduces fuel consumption and gaseous and particle emissions but also does not produce any detrimental effects on commercial three-way catalytic converter (TWC) performance over the short catalyst aging acceleration test in comparison to a current commercial gasoline fuel used as the baseline. (5,6)\n\nAccordingly, fuel and engine technologies interact synergistically, with HOPs enabling the engine to work in more efficient conditions leading to an effective GHG emissions reduction. Molecules that could improve the octane number of standard gasoline are needed more than ever, and their availability to the refining industry needs to be forwarded. For this reason, works reflecting on the state of the art in this field are essential at this point. Notwithstanding, there are many works and patents to be quoted, many of which are set out in recent reviews. Boot et al. studied the chemistry behind octane boosters and deduced generic design rules to guarantee good anti-knock performance, considering recent advances in engine technology. (7) They concluded that highly unsaturated cyclic compounds are the preferred octane boosters for modern SI engines. Multibranched paraffins come in a distant second place, and depending on the type and location of the functional oxygen group, oxygenates can have a beneficial, neutral, or detrimental impact on anti-knock quality. The review of Dunn et al. focuses on biomass-derived blendstocks that could be blended with gasoline and used in SI engines, regardless of the possibility that they could also be produced from petroleum or natural gas feedstocks. (8) Those promising bioblendstocks, with RON exceeding 98, were previously identified by the Co-Optimization of Fuels & Engines (Co-Optima) research initiative. (9) They were evaluated by means of 17 metrics, developed for economic viability, scalability, and energy and environmental impacts. For each metric, three categories were established, into which each blendstock fell: favorable, neutral, or unfavorable. They sowed key knowledge gaps including the degree of purity needed for use as a bioblendstock and the uncertainty about their blending level.\n\nTogether with the mentioned works, references can be found in the literature dealing with several aspects related to vehicle efficiency which are of paramount relevance, such as technical progress in internal combustion engine technologies (e.g., refs (10−12)), emission control (e.g., refs (13−15)), and, in significantly superior number, advanced fuel formulations (e.g., refs (16−20)). However, to date, scarce relevant references can be found focusing on identifying potential molecules able to boost HOPs. Recent relevant review papers covering different aspects related to gasoline boosters and/or topics directly linked to efficiency in car transportation engines are listed in Table 1.\n\nAuthor(s)Topic reviewedDate to which literature coveredZhao et al.

By this, more than 22 chemical compound families are assessed concerning their potential improvement on the anti-knock character of modern gasoline, well beyond current specifications worldwide. However, not only anti-knock effectiveness is considered when analyzing potential boosters but also associated side effects, distribution system compatibility, technology readiness, and applications, including production viability, sustainability of use, and associated toxicology according to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS).\n\nA brief introduction is conducted in Section 1, which is devoted to reviewing trends in engine and octane booster technology by presenting various indicators to assess the potential blendstocks (Section 1.2), to offer a historical perspective on anti-knock additives (Section 1.3), and to present and define a set of metrics that allow proper comparison among candidate molecules (Section 1.4). Sections 2 and 3 present the main properties of the assessed chemical families, which have been divided into two main categories, that is, high-octane components (Section 2), which include potential molecules to be added to gasoline formulations in concentrations higher than 2 vol %, and octane enhancer additives, which deal with potential molecules to be included in lower concentrations (Section 3). Both sections include information regarding physical and thermochemical data, as well as associated hazard information, together with available information on associated side effects, distribution system compatibility, and current technology readiness, among other aspects. Section 4 is devoted to the future scope and trends in the field. Finally, concluding remarks leading to preferred chemical compounds to be used in modern gasoline formulations are presented in Section 5, according to the previously defined metrics.\n\n1.1. Modern Spark-Ignited engines\n\nDuring the past several decades, different strategies aimed at improving engine efficiency have been developed and adopted by car manufacturers. The main targets have been to reduce specific fuel consumption and to prevent knocking, as well as to comply with the increasingly more restrictive legislation requirements on pollutants emissions. Concerning the knocking phenomenon, the most widely adopted strategy is based on the fact that by modifying the engine operation conditions, the octane requirements for a given fuel are lower. As is further discussed in Section 1.2.6, octane requirement (or octane appetite) refers to the minimum fuel quality needed to prevent knocking for a given engine or engine operating conditions. (7)\n\nAmong the different strategies adopted to improve efficiency, direct injection, turbocharging coupled with engine downsizing, and higher compression ratios with new valve timing to shorten the compression stroke have been successful in lowering unburned gas temperatures relative to pressure, which in turn have resulted in reducing the actual octane appetite of modern cars and thus effectively reduce knocking. (7,21,22)\n\nWith gasoline direct injection (GDI), the air–fuel mixture is injected in the form of a spray into the cylinder. As a consequence, mixture vaporization is mainly driven by the absorption of heat by the charge, rather than by heat absorption from the surfaces of elements in the engine (such as the walls or the intake valve), as is the case with port fuel injection, which results in a reduction of the air–fuel mixture temperature before the compression stroke. Also, when compared with carburetors (an earlier technology), GDI avoids freezing of less volatile, more knock-resistant, fuels. (7,10)\n\nInitially, turbocharging was meant to boost the engine power output. However, with time, it became evident that fuel economy highly benefitted from downsizing, which involves displacing smaller volumes, and the consumer’s demand grew considerably due in part to legislation requirements. In principle, turbocharging an engine involves a slight increase of the air–fuel mixture temperature because of the higher compression. However, the associated presence of an intercooler overcompensates such a rise due to heat losses, and globally, the mixture temperature drops. (7,23)\n\nConcerning compression ratios, the higher the ratio is, the greater the temperature drop relative to pressure is. Even though, generally, higher ratios involve both higher temperatures and pressures, at high ratios, the end gas volume is reduced in size. As a consequence, hot combustion gases are expelled to a greater extent during the exhaust stroke. Thus, there is less hot gas to be cooled during the intake stroke. Therefore, temperature relative to pressure is reduced at higher compression ratios. (7)\n\nOn the other hand, application of the Miller cycle (i.e., shortening compression stroke in relation to expansion stroke) has proven to reduce both temperature and pressure at the end of the compression stroke. Such a cycle can be implemented by altering the closing timing of the intake valve. Either late or early intake valve closing has the potential to suppress knocking and to enhance fuel consumption economy. (22)\n\nFuture trends also include spark controlled compression ignition (SPCCI) engines, which operate at a high compression ratio (at about 16:1) and with an extremely lean air-to-fuel ratio to achieve more complete combustion of the gasoline throughout the cylinder. In SPCCI engines, compression ratios are just below those in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), typical of diesel engines. This is achieved by using controlled autoignition of gasoline to take advantage of the consequential pressure rise. HCCI technology offers a wide range of fuel flexibility, higher thermal efficiency, and low emissions (NOX and soot emissions are suppressed from the engine). (24)\n\n1.2. Fuel Quality Testing\n\n1.2.1. Research and Motor Octane Number\n\nAmong gasoline quality testing, octane number (ON) is the most known measure of the autoignition character of a fuel. As early as 1932, two tests were defined to assess ON: research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON). Nowadays, both tests are run in cooperative fuel research (CFR) engines worldwide according to EN ISO 25164 (or the equivalent ASTM D2699) and EN ISO 25163 (or ASTM D2700), respectively. CFR engines are standard single-cylinder, four-stroke engines, specially developed for this purpose. RON is used to assess ON in normal road performance, i.e., at mild conditions of air inlet temperature (52 °C) and revolutions per minute (600 rpm), while MON corresponds to high-speed performance at more severe conditions (i.e., 149 °C of air–fuel mixture and 900 rpm). (7,21,25)\n\nRON and MON values of pure hydrocarbons decrease in the order: aromatics > isoalkanes (isoparaffins) > alkenes (olefins) > cycloalkanes (naphthenes) > n-alkanes (n-paraffins). Increasing molecular complexity (branching), decreasing molecular weight, and presence of unsaturation each tend to increase octane number. (26,27)\n\nON is established by comparison of the autoignition performance of a given fuel in a CFR engine to that of standard binary mixtures, according to an arbitrarily established scale. These mixtures present different concentrations of n-heptane (for which ON = 0 was defined since it autoignites easily) and 2,4,4-trimethyl-pentane (or isooctane, which, by definition, has ON = 100 because it exhibits high knocking resistance). According to its knocking performance, the ON of a given fuel is presented as the volumetric percentage of isooctane of the standard binary mixture that produces the same knock intensity as the tested fuel. (21,28) However, some chemicals present higher anti-knock resistance than isooctane, giving rise to fuels with ON greater than 100. In such cases, the tested gasoline is compared to reference fuels composed of isooctane and different amounts of tetraethyllead, an anti-knock additive, using empirical relationships defined by either RON or MON tests. (26)\n\nON of pure compounds are often noted as ONC, whereas ON of mixtures are ONM. On the other hand, the ON of a component in a gasoline mixture is part of what is often referred to as blending octane number (BON). BON is useful because ONM cannot be calculated directly from ONC. After all, either synergistic or antagonistic effects can arise when blending fuel components that result in nonlinear ON responses for real fuels. BON is related to ONM according to (27)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ONBG is the ON of the base gasoline and x the volume fraction of the component. Here, base gasoline refers to the gasoline mixture to which the component is added. Equation 1 is based on attributing all the differences between ONM and ONBG to the blended component, and it provides a fictitious BON value obtained by linear extrapolation. Two possibilities can take place when the ONC of the blended component is measured: Either the obtained value is higher than BON, or it is lower. If BON is larger than ONC, a synergistic effect further improves the gasoline anti-knocking quality by the addition of the component, and conversely, if BON is smaller than ONC, the addition of that component poses an antagonistic effect. (27,28)\n\n1.2.2. Road Octane Number\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the Coordinating Research Center (CRC) conducted studies aimed at assessing the octane requirements of U.S. cars, and new tests were developed. CRC carried out tests on chassis dynamometers, with the cars being run at part or wide-open throttle that provided a more informative insight on the actual octane requirements of more realistic engines, and the road octane number (RoadON) was defined thereof. RoadON is determined by the knocking performance of the tested engines under the specified operating conditions when fueled with a standard fuel with known RON and MON, which was designed to emulate commercial gasolines. RoadON can be expressed as a function of RON and MON as follows\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are parameters obtained by least-squares regression. CRC data allowed observing that, over the years, RON became more important than MON, probably due to the generalization of newer technologies. As a consequence, RoadON is now considered almost an equivalent of RON. (7)\n\n1.2.3. Octane Index\n\nAs commented, the knock resistance defined by RON and MON is based on CFR engine tests, representative of 1930s car engines. Therefore, in such testing, the engine operating conditions are far more severe than in modern car engines. This is particularly evident for temperatures, which nowadays are way lower (in the range of 30–50 °C on average) since current technology is no longer run by heated carburetors and includes more adequate cooling systems. Consequently, a newer measure of the anti-knock quality of fuel was defined to take this fact into account: octane index (OI). OI can be formulated as follows\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the parameter Κ depends not on the fuel but on the engine conditions, that is, on the end gas temperature–pressure history before the autoignition takes place. By definition, Κ equals zero for RON conditions and 1 for MON. Tested values of Κ using real engines rose from 0.5 in 1930 to 1 during the 1940s. The historical Κ value of 0.5 led to the definition of the anti-knock index (AKI), still used nowadays, as can be deduced from eq 3\n\n(4)\n\nFrom CRC data, it has been determined that, on average, Κ equaled zero by 2000 and is negative for current engines. Negative values of Κ imply that, for a given RON, gasolines with a high-octane sensitivity (S) have better anti-knock performance, and consequently, they do not necessarily improve when RON or MON are increased. Sensitivity is defined as the difference between RON and MON (S = RON – MON), which gives rise to the following reformulation of OI. (7,29)\n\n(5)\n\nS is a measure of “octane depreciation” at increasing engine speed and temperature, which is the tendency of hydrocarbon fuels to exhibit anti-knock behavior that becomes increasingly worse as conditions are more severe (i.e., high engine speed and temperature). (7,30) Typically, aromatics, olefins, and oxygenates have S values that are greatly larger than those of paraffins, (7) which encourage their usage in fuel formulation meant for modern engines. Currently, 10 point sensitivity is generally prescribed for every gasoline. (31)\n\nInterestingly, an empirical correlation has been reported between gasoline’s sensitivity and the blending ON that it will exhibit, (27,32) according to which an increase in S would entail a decrease in BRON or BMON (that is, blending research or motor octane number, respectively).\n\n1.2.4. Front End Octane Number\n\nThe front end octane number (FON or R100) is the RON determined for the fuel fraction that boils at temperatures below 100 °C. This measure is useful for fuels presenting a nonhomogeneous concentration distribution (hence octane distribution). Light fractions tend to vaporize swiftly once in the intake system and to be well distributed among all cylinders. However, heavier fractions usually condensate on the intake system walls, and therefore, their distribution in the engine cylinders can be nonuniform. (33,34)\n\nHistorically, FON was particularly important during the era when lead-based compounds were used as octane enhancers (until the 2000s, approximately). Among lead-based compounds, tetraethyllead (TEL) tended to concentrate in the heavier fuel fraction, whereas tetramethyllead (TML) improved FON greatly due to its lower boiling point. (27) Thus, to cover a broad range of gasoline fractions, mixed alkyl lead compounds were used.\n\nToday, FON is still useful to ensure enough knocking resistance during the cold start warming up period since, at low ambient temperatures, vaporization of the different gasoline fractions might result in nonuniform octane distribution among the engine cylinders, especially when port fuel injectors are used. (35)\n\n1.2.5. Distribution Octane Number\n\nThe distribution octane number (DON) is related to the octane requirement increase due to specific engine conditions. When operating at low speed and with a wide-open throttle, the fuel vaporization in the intake system is poor, and therefore, fractionation of the fuel is observed. DON is meant to evaluate anti-knock performance under these conditions because the octane quality of the fuel injected into the cylinder might be substantially different than that of the fuel in the tank. (36)\n\nDON tests measure the knocking performance of the different gasoline fractions, which are obtained either by distillation or condensation, in single-cylinder laboratory engines designed for RON determinations. (36)\n\nDON and FON are related to one another by ΔRON, which is defined as the difference in RON values between the heavier and the lighter gasoline fractions, the lighter fraction being the one that boils below 100 °C. The determination is carried out in three stages: (1) conventional determination of RON, (2) ASTM distillation up to 100 °C and recovery of the distillate, and (3) measurement of RON of this volatile fraction. Values of ΔRON for most commercial gasolines are between 5 and 15. A value below 10 is considered satisfactory (Germany requires a minimum ΔRON = 8). (37)\n\n1.2.6. Octane Requirement Increase\n\nFirst, it is convenient to define the octane requirement (OR) as the lowest octane number reference fuel that will allow an engine to run without knocking under standard conditions of service. This is a characteristic of each individual vehicle. (38)\n\nThe accumulation of carbon deposits in the combustion chamber increases octane requirements for a given engine and fuel. The difference between the new OR and the original one is the octane requirement increase (ORI). The formation of deposits increases with car mileage and depends on several aspects, such as driving conditions, engine design, gasoline composition, lubricant oils, and weather. Deposits are piled up on the piston top, on the intake and exhaust valves, on the end gas region, and on spark plugs. The effect of deposits on ORI is based on three possible mechanisms: (i) As deposits accumulate, the available cylinder volume decreases. (ii) Presence of deposits may alter the normal combustion process chemistry. (iii) Deposits store heat through the different cycles, which gives rise to the formation of hot spots. (21,39)\n\nHigh molecular weight additives usually increase the level of combustion chamber deposits, particularly those with higher ratios of mineral oil carriers. Detergents with optimized synthetic carrier fluids and compounds like polyether amines (PEA) minimize combustion chamber deposits build-up. (40)\n\nORI tests are performed with CRC chassis dynamometers (Section 1.3.2) after the car has been driven for a specified number of kilometers. (39)\n\nSince the phase-out of leaded gasoline, and with the newer car engine designs, the problem posed by ORI due to the formation of deposits has notably been reduced. (21)\n\n1.2.7. Supercharged\n\nThe term “supercharged” refers to a modification of the basic engine design (naturally aspirated) that includes a mechanical compressor connected to the crankshaft to increase the pressure of the air supplied to the engine. The basic concept is similar to that of turbocharged engines, that is, to increase the engine efficiency and power output by forcing extra air into the combustion chamber. The main difference between these two options is that in turbocharged engines the extra pressure is given by a turbine powered by the exhaust flow of the engine. (41)\n\nIn car engines, turbocharging has been the preferred option because turbochargers tend to be more efficient. However, in aviation engines, supercharging provides better results because, at high altitudes, temperature and pressure are lower.\n\nThis said, a specific octane quality protocol was developed to assess the knocking performance of fuels for supercharged aviation engines. This protocol consists of assessing the fuel behavior under two different conditions: those at takeoff, when maximum power is required and therefore a rich mixture is fed to the engine, and those at cruising speed, when a weak mixture is more efficient. The ASTM D909 test allows quantifying the fuel knock resistance when rich mixtures are used, and ASTM D2700 (MON) is the test of choice for the weak mixture performance. (42)\n\n1.2.8. Preignition Measurement\n\nIn today’s cars, the occurrence of preignition has gained importance due to the general trend of downsizing and turbocharging. Some tests have been developed to induce preignition in modern engines. In these tests, the engine is run at relatively high speeds (i.e., 1750 rpm), and the pressure charge is increased until preignition occurs for a given air–fuel mixture. Optical measurements can be employed to observe the formation and development of hot spots that trigger preignition. (43,44)\n\n1.3. Historical Perspective on Metallic Anti-Knock Additives\n\n1.3.1. Lead Alkyls, MMT, and Ferrocene\n\nThe anti-knock effect of lead alkyl compounds was discovered in 1921 by Thomas Midgley, and the use of these compounds as additives to boost octane was finally patented in 1926. (45,46) Since then, their use as anti-knock additives was massively adopted worldwide until their phase-out, which ended by the turn of the century. General characteristics of lead alkyl compounds are listed in Table 2.\n\nTELTMLMTELTMELDEDMLFormula(C2H5)4Pb(CH3)4PbCH3(C2H5)3Pb(CH3)3(C2H5)Pb(CH3)2(C2H5)2PbMolecular weight (kg/kmol)323.4267.3309.4281.4295.4Boiling point (°C)200109702751Melting point (°C)–133–30.2–30n.a.n.a.Vapor pressure at 20 °C (Pa)353000100973293Density at 20 °C (kg/m3)16602000171018801790Solubility in water (mg/L)0.25151.97.654.6Flash point (°C)8538n.a.n.a.n.a.Odorfruityodorlessn.a.n.a.n.a.\n\nLead alkyl compounds were the most predominantly used metallic anti-knock additives because they met most of the technical and economical requirements and also thanks to the joint introduction of other additives (antioxidants and scavengers) that improved their properties. (27) As seen in Table 3, tetraethyllead possesses relative anti-knock effectiveness which, on a molar basis, is far superior to that of many other compounds.\n\nTetraethyllead118tetraethyltin4.0Tetraphenyllead73triphenylarsine1.6Iron pentacarbonyl50xylidine1.6Nickel carbonyl35diphenylamine1.5Diethyl telluride27n-methylaniline1.4Triethylbismuth24dimethylcadmium1.2Diethyl selenide7.0aniline1.0Stannic chloride4.1ethanol0.1\n\nWith regard to other lead alkyl compounds different from TEL, the most important one in terms of their degree of implementation was tetramethyllead (TML). TML was introduced in the 1950s due to the predominance in the car market of engines with higher compression ratios, which increased the octane number demand. (47) Nevertheless, no alkyl–scavenger combination provides better results than TEL, and nowadays, it is the only compound used for the niche markets where lead is allowed.\n\nLead-based additives formed solid combustion products that caused the accumulation of deposits on valves, spark plugs, and combustion chambers, shortening the life of the engine. As other octane enhancers, they were prone to oxidation over long storage periods, leading to the separation of solid residues that could lead to blockages in the fuel system. To solve these problems, coadditives are used, and they are discussed later in this work. Another unwanted side effect of using tetraethyllead was related to its antagonism with sulfur. Gasolines containing significant amounts of sulfur gave significantly smaller increases in octane number on the addition of tetraethyllead than sulfur-free gasolines with similar hydrocarbon composition and base octane number. (49)\n\nOn the other hand, a positive side effect of using lead alkyl compounds is that they protected unhardened valve seats, present in older engines. In this sense, lead compounds formed in the combustion chamber inhibited erosion and wear of the valve seats because they avoided high-temperature corrosion, and they acted as solid lubricants. (27)\n\nBy the late 1970s, the once-massive use of lead-based additives began a steep decrease, especially in more developed countries, due to the population’s growing environmental awareness that ended up translating to more restrictive legislation, like the U.S.’s Clean Air Act in 1970. Actually, it had been proved from the start that tetraethyllead was highly toxic (e.g., fatal poisoning of several workers already occurred in the mid-1920s). In addition, inorganic lead compounds resulting from its combustion were also highly toxic and environmentally hazardous─and about three-fourths of lead burned in the engine is emitted as inorganic lead. (48)\n\nHowever, it was not until General Motors announced that they were planning to install catalytic converters in all new cars in order to meet the air quality requirements of the engine exhaust that leaded compounds stopped being so massively used due to their incompatibility with the noble metal oxidation catalysts in the converters. In particular, 1,2-dibromethane (one of the lead scavengers) was proven to be responsible for decreasing the catalyst activity, especially of catalysts containing palladium. (48)\n\nAnother set of historically relevant octane booster additives were manganese compounds. Particularly, methylcyclopentadienylmanganese tricarbonyl (MMT) has been commonly used as octane booster additives in some countries such as Russia until 2013 (see Table 4 for general properties of MMT), when the Worldwide Fuel Charter forced oil companies to stop using it for unleaded gasoline in the main developed countries (i.e., U.S., Canada, Europe, India, Japan). (27)\n\nMMTFormulaC9H7MnO3Molecular weight (kg/kmol)218.1Boiling point (°C)231.67Melting point (°C)2.22Vapor pressure at 20 °C (Pa)933Density at 20 °C (kg/m3)1390Solubility in water (mg/L)29Flash point (°C)96Odorherbaceous\n\nIn this regard, a typical manganese concentration of 0.0165 g/L of gasoline enhanced the anti-knock index by 0.5–1.0 units, depending on the gasoline composition. In Russia, 0.050 g Mn/L was established as the maximum allowed concentration. (50) Initially, MMT was meant to be used as a supplement to lead alkyl compounds, especially in paraffinic fuels. (51) It had been hoped that the use of MMT would not collide with the implementation of the noble metal catalyst technology in exhaust systems following the 1970s Clean Air Act, because manganese oxides only caused mild damage to the catalysts. However, manganese is responsible for wear and fouling, which pose detrimental effects on engine deposits, and it is suspected to be a strong neurotoxin and respiratory toxin. (38) For all these reasons, MMT ended up being either prohibited or strongly limited for standard motor gasoline in most territories worldwide. (21,50,51) Concerning aviation gasoline, ASTM working group 69284 is discussing the specification of an unleaded test fuel containing MMT with an appropriate scavenger coadditive, but balloting is not yet concluded.\n\nFerrocenes (see Table 5 for general characteristics) emerged as cheaper alternatives to MMT to boost octane numbers. Among the ferrocene compounds in anti-knock compositions, alkylferrocenes and dimethylferrocenylcarbinol have been the most widely used. (50)\n\nDicyclopentadienyl iron (ferrocene)Iron pentacarbonylFormulaC10H10FeC5FeO5Molecular weight (kg/kmol)186.0195.9Boiling point (°C)245.9102.9Melting point (°C)175.0–21Vapor pressure (Pa)6.6 (40 °C), 340 (100 °C)5333 (30.6 °C)Density at 20 °C (kg/m3)11071453Solubility in water (mg/L)insolubleinsolubleFlash point (°C)n.a.n.a.Odorcamphor-likemusty\n\nIron compounds were widely used as anti-knock compounds in Russia in 1960–1970, but they were considered unfit due to ferrocene main drawback: the iron-containing deposits formed from ferrocene can lead to the formation of a conductive coating on the spark plug surfaces. (25,50) No effective iron evacuators could be found, and consequently, the only measure that could be applied was to limit the maximum concentration at 0.038 g Fe/L, at which high fouling is not observed. (50) Moreover, ferrocene oxides are abrasive, which entails rapid engine wear. (51) Furthermore, iron oxide was reported to act as a physical barrier between the catalyst/oxygen sensor and exhaust gases and led to erosion and plugging of the catalyst, resulting in poor functioning thereof. (52)\n\n1.3.2. Co-Anti-Knock Additives\n\nThe historical role of scavengers as co-anti-knock additives in the era of leaded gasoline was to reduce the deposits formed by lead upon combustion. Such deposits accumulated on valves, spark plugs, and combustion chambers, which entailed shorter lifespans for engines. The most widely used scavengers were halogenated compounds, such as 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane. These halogens reacted with lead, forming lead bromide and lead chloride, which had great volatility at high temperatures and therefore helped to evacuate lead from the engine. As a result, the amount of lead deposits could be reduced by about 70%–80%. (27) Numerous patents claiming huge lead deposit reductions with several scavenger compositions, including halides, sulfides, arsenides, and/or phosphines (e.g., U.S. Patents 2398281, 2479901, 2479902, 2557019, 2750267, 2797153, 2999739, and 3126261, among others (53−60)), can be found. Similarly, scavengers for manganese anti-knock additives were also designed with the same purpose. For instance, some references indicate that phosphates were useful in this regard (e.g., U.S. Patent 2018/0119037A1 (61)).\n\nOn the other hand, the term “anti-knock extender” refers to co-anti-knock additives different than scavengers that, without being able to increase the octane quality of fuel by themselves, were capable of increasing the efficiency of an octane booster additive. To avoid confusion, this concept should be well differentiated from that of the so-called “fuel extenders”, which refer to high-octane components such as oxygenates. Originally, anti-knock extenders were meant to increase TEL anti-knock efficiency in raising the octane quality of fuels. Two reasons explain the use of extenders in gasoline. On the one hand, adding a chemical that could improve the effectiveness of TEL was economically more attractive than adding larger doses of the more expensive TEL. On the other hand, along the years that followed the introduction of leaded gasolines, major changes occurred in both gasoline composition and engine design which, for obvious reasons, had not been considered in the early development of lead-based additives. Therefore, a reevaluation of the anti-knock needs of more modern cars had to be undertaken. (62)\n\nAmong anti-knock extenders, carboxylic acids (such as acetic and ethylhexanoic acids) were singled out because they could improve the anti-knock quality of high-octane gasoline in about 2.5 RON units. (63) A synergistic effect between the acid and TEL was clearly observed experimentally in their work. The mechanism to explain the action of TEL extenders is related to their interaction with the actual anti-knock species resulting from TEL addition, that is, lead oxides. Assuming that TEL anti-knock effectiveness would diminish as lead oxides agglomerate forming deposits, it seems reasonable to anticipate that the octane-enhancing action of the extender can be explained by its interference with lead oxides, which would prevent (or at least retard) their accumulation and would prolong the oxide particles action from effectively anchoring free radicals in the combustion chamber. It hence follows that excessive extender concentration would pose a negative effect on the anti-knock ability of TEL for it would consume TEL before suppressing free radicals. (62)\n\nBesides scavengers and extenders, other co-anti-knock additives that were highly relevant, such as antioxidants to prevent TEL oxidation during storage and transportation, were used. As TEL antioxidants, the most quoted ones are phosphine sulfides, hydroperoxides, alkylated phenols, or hydrogenated quinolines, among others. (64,65)\n\n1.4. Definition of General Metrics to Select Candidate Molecules\n\nTo establish a proper comparison among molecules of different chemical families, a rather straightforward approach has been adopted. It mainly consists of comparing their general behavior according to selected key features that must be evaluated when considering new gasoline formulations. These features have been selected based not only on anti-knock effectiveness of compounds included in a chemical family─which for obvious reasons is a pivotal metric in the present work─but also on more collateral aspects that, thanks to the aforementioned historical perspective, are known to have an impact on the field. For instance, the side effects of a potential candidate on current engines need to be known so that potential coadditives are designed to be coupled with the anti-knock booster. Likewise, the compatibility of the candidate molecule with the existing gasoline distribution system or its sustainability of use is also of the utmost importance. Specifically, the metrics that have been used in the present work to assess chemical families are the following:\n\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nClick to copy section linkSection link copied!\n\nA schematic qualitative comparison of the chemical compounds presented in Sections 2 and 3 is presented familywise in Table 87 (for high-octane components) and Table 88 (for ash-less octane-enhancer additives). For the sake of simplicity, information on each chemical family accounting for the different metrics defined in Section 1.4 is presented on the basis of favorable, neutral, or unfavorable categorizations. Thus, green, amber, and red circles in the table represent favorable, neutral, and unfavorable categorizations, respectively. Gray circles reflect a lack of information to categorize the substance for the established metric.\n\nAs seen in Table 87, regarding the global outcome of the different considered metrics, it can be identified that most of the selected families present positive effects on the anti-knock behavior of gasoline and that all of them are technologically available nowadays. Stronger differences among families can be appreciated regarding the rest of the defined metrics.\n\nAbout the suitability of the compared chemical families, taking into account the defined metrics, ethers, ketones, and esters are the considered families presenting a larger number of favorable categorizations (i.e., five out of seven). Among these, ethers seem to be the most favored compounds to be added to gasoline as high-octane components since no unfavorable categorizations have been identified for them. On the other hand, given that esters present a relatively more modest effect on the anti-knock behavior of gasolines, their suitability appears to be lower than that of ethers, provided that anti-knock effectiveness is regarded as the most important feature for high-octane components. Regarding ketones, reported negative side effects would make them less eligible compounds compared to ethers and esters, unless coadditives were designed to palliate such effects.\n\nAccording to results depicted in Table 88, strong differences can be appreciated when comparing the available information on ash-less additives for the different metrics. As in the previous case, technological readiness does not appear to be an issue, but environmental hazards can be, as a general rule, more severe for considered additives than for high-octane components (Table 87). Regarding compounds, eligibility as octane-enhancer additives, anilines, iodine compounds, N-nitrosamines, and phenols are the most favored ones since they present between four and five favorable categorizations out of the seven defined metrics. Among these compounds, iodine compounds could be discarded due to their high cost. For some of the presented compounds within families of anilines, N-nitrosamines, and phenols, the promising results reproduced in this work should motivate further research.\n\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c00912.\n\nInformation regarding toxicology associated with high-octane components and ash-less octane-enhancer additives (PDF)\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.
