Scans from a rather fine mid-60s 'town plans' booklet issued by the National Benzole petrol company. Never easy to date these - but the Manchester map has the original M62 Eccles Bypass on it and alone - this was opened by the Lancashire County Council in 1961 so a date in the early 60s is plausible.

The 'Mercury' logo was a well known sight on British roads - Benzole, a by-product from coal, was extensively used as a fuel additive and the Benzole Company was formed in 1919 - over time the ratio of benzole to petrol was changed from 50/50 to zero by the late 1950s and in 1957 National Benzole became part of Shell-Mex & BP. The brand was phased out in the 1990s.

This is the back cover - with a version of the roadside totem used to denote the company's petrol stations.
