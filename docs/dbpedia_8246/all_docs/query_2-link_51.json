Managed by the U.S. Marshals, Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) is one of the largest transporters of prisoners in the world, handling more than 1,070 requests every day to move prisoners between judicial districts, correctional institutions, and foreign countries. JPATS completes more than 275,400 prisoner and alien movements annually via coordinated air and ground systems.\n\nFugitive Operations\n\nThe U.S. Marshals is the federal government's primary agency for conducting fugitive investigations and apprehend more federal fugitives than all other law enforcement agencies combined. Working with authorities at the federal, state, and local levels, U.S. Marshals-lead fugitive task forces assist in the arrest of state and local fugitives across the country.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals is the premier agency to apprehend foreign fugitives believed to be in the United States, and it is the agency responsible for locating and extraditing American fugitives, who flee to foreign countries. In support of its international fugitive investigative mission, the USMS has established foreign field offices in Jamaica, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.

The Marshals collaborate with those partner agencies to aggressively investigate and pursue non-compliant offenders, placing the highest priority on those who have committed violent acts and crimes against children.\n\nMissing Child Program\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service supports the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's (NCMEC) mission to protect children from victimization by providing assistance to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 enhanced the U.S. Marshals’ authority to assist federal, state and local law enforcement with the recovery of missing, endangered or abducted children, regardless of whether a fugitive or sex offender was involved.\n\nThe Marshals established a Missing Child Unit to oversee and manage the implementation of its enhanced authority under the act.\n\nPrisoner Operations\n\nThe Marshals Service houses over 55,000 detainees in federal, state, local and private jails throughout the nation. In order to house these pre-sentenced prisoners, the Marshals Service contracts with approximately 1,800 state and local governments to rent jail space. Seventy-five percent of the prisoners in Marshals Service custody are detained in state, local and private facilities; the remainder are housed in Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities.\n\nTactical Operations\n\nEach year the U.S. Marshals Service carries out hundreds of special missions related to its broad law enforcement authority and judicial security responsibilities. It also responds to homeland security crises and national emergencies.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service Special Operations Group (SOG) is a specially trained, tactical unit comprised of Deputy Marshals, who can respond immediately to incidents anywhere in the United States or its territories.\n\nAsset Forfeiture\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service is responsible for managing and disposing of seized and forfeited properties acquired by criminals through illegal activities. Under the auspices of the Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture Program, the Marshals currently manage nearly $2.2 billion worth of property, and promptly disposes of assets forfeited by all Department of Justice agencies.\n\nThe Program's goal is to maximize the net return from forfeited property and then reinvest the proceeds for law enforcement purposes.\n\nWitness Security\n\nThe U.S. Marshals ensures the safety of witnesses, who risk their lives testifying for the government in cases involving organized crime and other significant criminal activities. Since 1971, the Marshals have protected, relocated and given new identities to more than 8,500 witnesses and more than 9,900 of their family members.\n\nThe successful operation of the Witness Security Program has been recognized as providing a unique and valuable tool in the government's battle against major criminal enterprises and international terrorism.
