        "text": "The Judicial Academy helps lawyers who are interested in becoming judges learn about the profession and improve their chances of appointment or election to the bench.\n\nAs of the summer of 2024, 31 alumni of the first four Judicial Academy classes had already made it to the bench. See below for the full list.\n\n“I absolutely loved the Judicial Academy, and I highly recommend that anyone aspiring to a judicial career invest in this course,” said Presiding Judge Lorrie Sinclair Taylor of the 20th Judicial District Court in Loudoun County, Virginia. She became the first African-American judge in the history of Loudoun County.\n\nParticipants in the weeklong course learn from veteran judges about a judge’s responsibilities, including:\n\nInterpreting the law\n\nAssessing evidence\n\nControlling hearings and trials\n\nDeciding impartially\n\nSentencing criminal defendants\n\nTerminating parental rights\n\nThe instructors also include professionals in charge of judicial selection and experts on judicial election campaigns.\n\nOne of the goals for the Academy is to increase diversity in the judiciary, so applicants from diverse backgrounds are encouraged to apply."
