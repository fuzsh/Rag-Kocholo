        "text": "Historians and political scientists have noted that appointments of judges to the U.S. Courts of Appeals are not determined by senatorial courtesy alone. What has not been adequately explained is why and when a president defers to a senator's choice rather than seek to control the selection. This article attempts to understand the politics of federal appellate court appointments. The author first identifies a major change in the work of the courts of appeals during the years 1900-1945—the growth in review of the actions of newly created federal regulatory agencies. Then, by examining Justice Department files and presidential correspondence, he discoveres three patterns of appointment emerging in the same period. The patterns vary with presidential perceptions of the role of the federal government and of the courts of appeals' ability to affect accomplishment of administration goals. Appointments during the first years of the presidencies of Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and during the Harding and Coolidge administrations were dominated by patronage concerns. Those administrations yielded to the recommendations of senators and demonstrated no interest in the policy-making potential of these courts. In the two other patterns the White House played a more active role, with senators more often deferring to the president's selection. Concerns about professionalism dominated selections in Taft's and Hoover's administrations: because they recognized the policy importance of those judgeships but saw the role of government as limited, they sought judicial craftsmen who would make policy only incrementally. Policy concerns dominated selections during Wilson's administration and the latter years of both the Roosevelts' administrations: Justice Department officials screened nominees to determine their policy orientation, because federal appellate court judgeships were perceived as crucial policy positions that could affect the president's ability to implement his reform programs.\n\n5 E.g., in his study of judicial lawmaking in the first half of the nineteenth century Horwitz ignores any questions about how recruitment of judges might transform the law. Morton J. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law, 1780–1860 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1977). Similarly, in studying the Second Circuit during Learned Hand's chief judgeship, Schick only cursorily examines appointments of judges to that court. Marvin Schick, Learned Hand's Court ch. 1 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1970). The major historical studies of appointments are Kermit L.

Chase, , supra, relying on Burke Shartel, Federal Judges–-Appointment, Supervision, and Removal–-Some Possibilities Under the Constitution (pt. l), 28 Mich. L. Rev. 485, 500–501 (1930), argues that lower federal court judges are “inferior officers” and thus could be appointed by the president alone, if Congress chose. Chase's argument seems convincingly refuted by the debates in the constitutional convention. See Ferling, supra, at 62–70; see also Hall, Politics of Justice, supra note 5, at 194 n.12. As Chase points out, whatever the framers' intent, since 1789 the process has always been presidential nomination with advice and consent of the Senate. The 1891 Evarts Act setting up the Circuit Courts of Appeals gave the president the right to appoint circuit judges “by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.” Circuit Court of Appeals (Evans) Act, ch. 517.26 Stat. 826 (1891) (current version in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C. (1982)). See 28 U.S.C. § 43(a) (creation of courts of appeals) and § 44(a) (appointment of circuit judges) (1982). The 1948 recodification of the U .S. Statutes gave the president the same power to nominate and appoint federal district judges as he had had for circuit (courts of appeals) judges since 1891. Ch. 646, § 133, 62 Stat. 895 (1948), 28 U.S.C. § 133 (1982). See Berkson & Carbon, supra note 1, at 13–14.Google Scholar\n\n22 Id. at 62–63; Chase, supra note 6, at 6–13; Harris, supra note 5, at 40–41. 215–37. The history of senatorial courtesy is disputed. Hall, Children of the Cabins; supra note 5, at 430 n.44, relies on his work (Hall, Politics of Justice, supra note 5, at 171–72) to argue that Harris is incorrect in finding antebellum senatorial control of lower court selections through the use of senatorial courtesy. Hall argues that senatorial courtesy is a late nineteenth-century development. Harris, Chase, and Slotnick all demonstrate that from the 1930s on a senator had to state reasons for finding a candidate “personally obnoxious” in order to convince his fellow senators to block a confirmation. Merely reciting the phrase would no longer suffice.Google Scholar\n\n27 As we will see in examining the early part of both Theodore Roosevelt's presidency and Franklin Roosevelt's, patronage considerations may also dominate administrations in which the role of the federal government is perceived to be to promote change but the importance of lower federal courts in achieving that goal is not perceived. As discussed in sec. II, the form in which change took place during those periods made it quite likely that those administrations would come to see the importance of the courts.Google Scholar\n\n28 Regardless of which pattern describes a president's appointments, all presidents overwhelmingly appointed judges from their own party. Democrats appointed Democrats 94% of the time and Republicans appointed Republicans 87.3% of the time. Biographical Dictionary of the Federal Judiciary, comp. Harold Chase et al., xvi (Detroit: Gale Research Co., 1976). The question is not whether these presidents were partisan or whether these appointments were political (which of course they were), but whether partisan politics was the only issue or most dominant motive for the appointment.Google Scholar\n\n44 Writing on the Progressive Era is voluminous. An excellent historiographic essay is Rogers, Daniel T., In Search of Progressivism, 10 Revs. Am. Hist. 113 (1982). which contains citations to much of the relevant literature. Perhaps the most influential works are Richard Hofstadter, The Age of Reform: From Bryan to F.D.R. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1955); Wiebe, supra note 42; Hays, Samuel P., The Politics of Reform in Municipal Government in the Progressive Era, 55 Pac. Nw. Q. 157 (1964); Gabriel Kolko, The Triumph of Conservatism: A Reinterpretation of American History 1900–1916 (New York: Free Press of Glencoe, 1963); James Weinstein, The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State, 1900–1918 (Boston: Beacon Press, 1968); Filene, Peter G., An Obituary for the Progressive Movement, 22 Am. Q. 20 (1970). For the contours of some of the debates see the selections of readings in Arthur Mann, ed., The Progressive Era (2d ed. Hinsdale, Ill.: Dryden Press, 1975).Google Scholar\n\n62 The information is taken mostly from the biographies contained in Biographical Dictionary of the Federal Judiciary, supra note 28, and Senate Committee on the Judiciary, supra note 40. I have excluded the appointments to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia because the absence of any senators or geographic representation and the peculiar local jurisdiction of the court made it dissimilar to other courts of appeals. Not until the post-World War II period, with the increase in administrative rule making, did the D.C. Circuit become the most important court in supervising the work of the federal agencies. Then Congress placed venue for the review of many agency actions either exclusively in the D.C. Circuit, or made it one of a litigant's choices. See text, table, and notes in Note, Venue for Judicial Review of Administrative Actions: A New Approach, 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1735, 1737, 1739, 1755–58 (1980). Also suggestive of the different nature of the D.C. Circuit before World War II is that when T.R. discussed his judicial appointments with a journalist at the end of his presidency, he included D.C. appointments not with the other federal courts of appeals, but rather with the territorial and Court of Claims appointments. Roosevelt to Mark Sullivan, May 13, 1907, in The Letters of Theodore Roosevelt, ed. Elting E. Morison, vol. 5, The Big Stick: 1905–1907, no. 4320 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1952) [hereinafter T. Roosevelt Letters]. One should also note that in his fine study of the legal challenges to the New Deal agencies Irons does not mention the D.C. Circuit. Peter H.

Even when Roosevelt fought with a senator in 1905, as in the appointment of a district judge in Oregon, it was not over policy issues. Because it appeared the Oregon senator was attempting to appoint a U.S. attorney who would fail to prosecute a land fraud conspiracy involving the senator's friends, T.R. refused to accept the senator's nominee for district judge and chose instead Charles Wolverton, because, he wrote, “I have received information about you that satisfies me that in point of integrity, force, and judicial capacity you more than anyone else satisfy the high requirements incident to satisfactorily filling a position on the Federal bench.” There is no mention of labor-management issues or corporate regulation, as there was with the later appointments.

Roosevelt Letters, supra note 62, no. 4371, at 719. See also id., July 10, 1907, no. 4362. In that letter T.R. shows that he feels policy considerations should dominate political considerations, although he is willing to give in if Taft feels disappointing the senators by not appointing Noyes would harm Taft's presidential chances in 1908. “I am perfectly willing to nominate Beach and let [the senators] do as they think best about supporting him. … I am going to follow your judgment in the matter if you feel very strongly on the the subject…. [Beach's] record on labor inclines me to nominate him anyhow.”Google Scholar\n\n97 Gregory served Aug. 29, 1914-Mar.4, 1919. James McReynolds had served Mar. 5, 1913-Aug.29, 1914, and A. Mitchell Palmer followed Gregory, serving Mar. 5, 1919-Mar. 5, 1921. McReynolds, like Gregory, owed his appointment to the cabinet to Col. E. M. House. McReynolds had a reputation ac a proponent of vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws. This reputation, plus the desire to end a political controversy over McReynolds's motives in ordering the postponement of the trial of the son-in-law of a Wilson administration official, led Wilson to nominate him for the U.S. Supreme Court in 1914. David Burner, James C. McReynolds, in Friedman & Israel, supra note 71, at 2023, 2026; Arthur Walworth, Woodrow Wilson 271–72 (3d ed. New York: W. W.

Alschuler was a Jew and the first Jew appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Alschuler appointment, a year before Brandeis's, went through the Senate without controversy. The only Jews to have been appointed to the federal bench before Alschuler were Jacob Trieber of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas (1900) and Julian Mack of the U.S. Commerce Court (1911). Mack served on the Seventh, Sixth, and Second circuits following the abolition of the Commerce Court.

Ellis, Dec. 30, 1914, Alschuler Collection, Illinois State Historical Society, Springfield.Google Scholar\n\n133 One appointee was Charles Johnson of Maine to the First Circuit, for whom Wilson received recommendations from many senators, congressmen, and party officials. As one said, “[Johnson] always took a deep interest in and supported all legislation favorable to the administration.” William Ingraham to Wilson, Sept. 29, 1917. Wilson sent the letters to Gregory and asked for his opinion. Wilson to Gregory, Sept. 19, 1917. The other was Nathan Bryan of Florida to the Fifth Circuit in 1920. Memo, W. M.

Burke states further on: “A number of Roosevelt's nominees were accepted by the senators without enthusiasm and only after political pressure had been applied.” Id. at 238. Burke dates the period of the importance of ideology in courts of appeals appointments as 1935–40. Id. at 245–46. However, in 1935–36 F.D.R. made six appointments to the appeals courts. With insufficient information on one of the six, Burke's account of the others attributes three to senatorial politics, says one enjoyed the support of both his senator and F.D.R.'s patronage chief, Jim Farley, and characterizes only Clifton Mathews, U.S. attorney in Arizona, as an ideological choice.Google Scholar\n\n142 Memo, Asst.

Henry Hanna, The Common Law in Ireland, in The Future of the Common Law 233 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1937). Treanor was a friend and admirer of Roscoe Pound, who invited him to be one of the speakers at the Conference on the Future of the Common Law, part of Harvard's tercentenary celebration. The Treanor appointment was controversial because it was one of the instances when a president moved an appointment from one state to another; when Illinois Democrats remained deadlocked over two candidates, the attorney general decided to shift the appointment to Indiana. Congress had created a new judgeship, and a deal was finally arranged whereby the New Deal liberals, led by Gov. Henry Homer, would have Lt. Gov. Otto Kerner named to the Seventh Circuit, and the regular party, led by Chicago mayor Edward J. Kelly, would get Mike Igoe named to the district court. Although political considerations were paramount in Kerner's selection, it should be noted that Cummings selected the more liberal candidate for the court of appeals position.Google Scholar\n\n157 Id. at 168. But note another writer's comment: Yet Taft did not fully accept the judicial myth which permeated so much contemporary conservative political thought. Although he was perfectly able to accept and even expound the priestly role of the judge as a dispenser of sacred doctrine, he was not able to endorse the view that it was the Constitution, not the judge, which spoke through judicial decisions. In 1913 Taft had argued that judges had to adapt law to meet new conditions. “Indeed,” he stated. “it is one of the highest and most useful functions that courts have to perform in making a government of law practical and uniformly just.” The next year he was even more explicit: “Judges are men. Courts are composed of judges and one would be foolish who would deny that courts and judges are affected by the times in which they live.”Google Scholar\n\nWalter F. Murphy, In His Own Image: Mr. Chief Justice Taft and Supreme Court Appointments, 1961 Sup. Ct.

It should be emphasized that these policy concerns were expressed after Taft's term as president, when splits had developed within his party and after Brandeis and Clarke, Wilson's Supreme Court appointees, had in Taft's opinion shown themselves to be result-oriented liberals. Murphy, supra note 157, at 163–64. The intra-party split with Roosevelt was in part triggered by T.R.'s attacks on the judiciary and by such proposals as judicial recall. Thus during most of his four years as president, Taft was not at odds with his party over the policy question of the role of the judiciary. See D. Anderson, supra note lS5, at 229–33; Garraty, supra note 67, at 288–91.Google Scholar\n\n168 Id. See also Taft to William Mason, Dec. 18, 1912, Taft Papers, supra note 165. “[I hoped] I might justify my own judgment in the selection of your son, and could I have appointed him it would have gratified me … and I should like to have delighted your father's heart. But these matters are of rigid conscience and I could not reach the conclusion … to send in your boy's name.” The Democrats managed to block confirmation of Carpenter, wanting to save the appointment for President-Elect Wilson. Carpenter remained on the district court, and Taft later sought to have him promoted, recommending him to Coolidge in 1924.
