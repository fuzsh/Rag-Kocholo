We also have some early Federal court records from Montana.\n\nBrief Overview\n\nWhat Can I Find in Federal Court Records?\n\nWhat Types of Federal Court Records Can I Find at the National Archives at Seattle?\n\nFinding Aids\n\nRelated Microfilm Publications\n\nBrief Overview\n\nRecords of The District Courts of the United States are contained within Record Group 021.\n\nU.S. district courts serve as the trial courts of general federal jurisdiction in each state. District courts handle civil and criminal cases. There is also a bankruptcy court associated with each district.\n\nU.S. district courts were established by the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 76).\n\nEach state is considered a district. The organization of the divisions within the individual districts varies depending upon the state.\n\nUntil 1991, U.S. district courts also handled naturalization cases.\n\nRecord Group 021 also includes records of some U.S. territorial courts and U.S. circuit courts.\n\nU.S. territorial courts handled cases of federal jurisdiction within organized incorporated territories of the United States. Once the organized territories became states, the territorial court was replaced by a district court. Some territorial court records can be found in state archives.\n\nU.S. circuit courts (1789-1912) were also established by the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\nCircuit courts had original jurisdiction over suits involving an alien, suits between citizens of different states, and suits in common law and equity where the disputed amount exceeded $500.\n\nIt is important to note that the U.S. circuit courts and the U.S. circuit courts of appeals (RG 276) are different. In 1891, Congress created the U.S. courts of appeals (Evarts Act) to hear appeals from both the district courts and the circuit courts, which meant the circuit courts no longer had appellate jurisdiction over the district courts. Each court of appeals serves a specific circuit (region), and they were called circuit courts of appeals until 1948.\n\nThe presiding judges in each circuit traveled to each of the districts to hear cases. Thus, records of the U.S. circuit courts were organized based on the district where the cases originated, as opposed to the circuit.\n\nIn 1812, circuit courts were granted the authorization to appoint U.S. commissioners to assist in taking of bail and affidavits. Commissioners' functions were expanded by subsequent legislation and court rules. Their powers have included the authority to issue arrest warrants, examine persons charged with offenses against Federal laws, initiate actions in admiralty matters, and institute proceedings for violation of civil rights legislation. The authorization to appoint commissioners was transferred to the district courts in 1896.\n\nThe U.S. circuit courts were abolished by the Judicial Code of 1911, and their trial jurisdiction was transferred to the U.S. district courts.\n\nWhat Can I Find in Federal Court Records?\n\nThe records document the actions of Federal district, circuit, and some territorial courts. These courts have jurisdiction over naturalization, bankruptcy, civil (law, equity, and admiralty), and criminal cases.\n\nSome of the general subjects documented in these records are civil rights, commerce and corporate history, demographics, genealogy, immigration and ethnic groups, the impact of Federal regulatory programs, judicial administration, labor relations and union activity, maritime history, and State and local political activity.\n\nSpecific topics documented include collection of debts, enforcement of contracts, claims for damages; counterfeiting, and smuggling or violations of customs regulations; European immigration and the exclusion and deportation of Chinese; evasion of import duties; the illegal sale or manufacturing of alcoholic beverages; infringement of patent or copyright; interstate transfer of stolen property; mutiny or murder on the high seas; prize condemnations; theft, assault, or murder on Federal property; and violations of Federal election laws and civil rights legislation, international agreements (such as the Migratory Bird Act); Selective Service regulations, and slave importation laws.\n\nCourt records can be useful for biographical research, but they should generally not be the starting point.\n\nWhat Types of Federal Court Records Can I Find at the National Archives at Seattle?\n\nIt is important to note that, historically, each district court has managed their records differently. Thus, we may have some records for one district court that we do not have for another.\n\nCase files\n\nCase files have documents created for a specific case. These documents have been filed by attorneys or issued by the court. They can include affidavits, complaints, depositions, indictments, judgments or final decrees, motions, petitions, subpoenas, and writs.\n\nCase files are usually arranged numerically by the docket number assigned when the case was filed.\n\nExhibits submitted as part of court proceedings usually were returned to the parties involved, but they are sometimes included in the case file.\n\nTranscripts are seldom part of the file.\n\nBankruptcy case files also contain petitions of creditors and schedules of assets and liabilities.\n\nDocket books\n\nDocket books have lists of each of the documents filed in an individual case.\n\nThey can be considered a summary of proceedings in each case.\n\nDocket books may have a record of the fees collected and a statement of the disposition of the case. They will always give the reason for the case.\n\nMinute books or journals\n\nThese volumes have daily chronological record of court proceedings.\n\nThey can include information about financial accounts and the collection of fees, lists of jury members, names of attorneys admitted to practice, and the text of orders appointing court officials.\n\nOrder or judgment books\n\nThese volumes have the text of orders and judgments and records of the amounts of monetary judgments.\n\nRecords of proceedings (only for U.S. commissioners)\n\nThese are printed forms that give the names of defendants, summaries of the nature of the charges, the actions taken, and the disposition of the cases. These are often the only record of commissioner cases.\n\nNaturalization records\n\nThese records include declarations of intention, petitions for naturalization, depositions, and certificates of naturalization\n\nSome cases include maps and photographs.\n\nFinding Aids\n\nCase numbers can sometimes be determined from indexes in minute, docket, or order books, but these are not available for all courts. Card indexes of defendants and plaintiffs exist for some of the courts. Records for a case can usually be located by case number and name of the court. Additional information may be available from the clerk of the court involved.\n\nPlease contact us for more information on finding aids we have may have available for this record group.\n\nRelated Microfilm Publications"
