        "text": "Following is a list of all Article III United States federal judges appointed by President Ronald Reagan during his presidency.[1] In total Reagan appointed: four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States, including the appointment of a sitting associate justice as chief justice, 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, 290 judges to the United States district courts and 6 judges to the United States Court of International Trade. Reagan's total of 383 Article III judicial appointments is the most by any president.\n\nIn addition to these appointments, Reagan signed the Federal Courts Improvement Act in 1982, which transferred five judges from the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and seven judges from the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims, into the newly created United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Although each of those twelve judges had been appointed to their original tribunals by previous presidents, Reagan's signing of the act effectively placed all of them on the new Court of Appeals.\n\n11 of Reagan's appointees remain in active service, five appellate judges and six district judges. Three additional judges named by Reagan to district courts remain in active service as appellate judges by appointment of later presidents.\n\nReagan elevated William Rehnquist to the office of Chief Justice.\n\nSandra Day O'Connor was appointed by Reagan as the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nReagan named Antonin Scalia to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit before elevating him to the Supreme Court.\n\nReagan signed into law the bill that created the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and reassigned judges from predecessor courts to the new Circuit Court.\n\n# Justice Seat State Former justice Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Confirmation\n\nvote Began\n\nactive service Ended\n\nactive service Ended\n\nretired service 1 8 Arizona July 1, 1981 September 21, 1981 99–0 September 25, 1981 January 31, 2006 December 1, 2023 2 Chief Virginia[Note 1] June 20, 1986 September 26, 1986 65–33 September 26, 1986 September 3, 2005 – 3 9 New Jersey June 24, 1986 September 17, 1986 98–0 September 26, 1986 February 13, 2016 – 4 1 California November 30, 1987 February 3, 1988 97–0 February 18, 1988 July 31, 2018 Incumbent\n\n# Judge Circuit Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Confirmation\n\nvote Began active\n\nservice Ended active\n\nservice Ended senior\n\nstatus 1 Fourth July 16, 1981 September 16, 1981 Unanimous consent September 19, 1981 May 31, 1991 April 18, 2018 2 Fifth September 17, 1981 October 21, 1981 Unanimous consent October 26, 1981 January 23, 1997 July 14, 2011 3 Second October 1, 1981 October 29, 1981 Unanimous consent October 29, 1981 November 13, 1993 October 16, 2015 4 Second September 8, 1981 November 18, 1981 Unanimous consent November 18, 1981 January 1, 1990 March 31, 1995 5 Seventh October 20, 1981 November 24, 1981 Unanimous consent December 1, 1981 November 4, 1985 October 25, 2005 6 Seventh October 27, 1981 November 24, 1981 Unanimous consent December 1, 1981 September 2, 2017 – 7 Third November 16, 1981 December 3, 1981 Unanimous consent December 3, 1981 May 4, 2003 May 19, 2006 8 Second November 18, 1981 December 9, 1981 Unanimous consent December 10, 1981 September 30, 2000 December 8, 2020 9 D.C.
