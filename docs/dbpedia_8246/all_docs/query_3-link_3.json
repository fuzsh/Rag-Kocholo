U.S. circuit courts, and Confederate States district courts.\n\nU.S. territorial courts were established by statute for organized territories of the United States. They had the form and jurisdiction of district courts, by which they were superseded when the territories became states.\n\nU.S. circuit courts were established concurrently with U.S. district courts by the Judiciary Act of 1789. They shared with U.S. district courts original jurisdiction over criminal cases, tort suits by aliens, and all common law suits involving the United States. They had exclusive original jurisdiction over suits involving an alien, suits between citizens of different states, and suits in common law and equity where the disputed amount exceeded $500. They had appellate jurisdiction over cases heard in U.S. district courts comprising each circuit, except those cases that by law were heard immediately by the U.S. Supreme Court. Appellate jurisdiction was transferred from U.S. circuit courts to newly established U.S. circuit courts of appeals by the Judiciary Act of 1891 (26 Stat. 826), March 3, 1891. U.S. circuit courts were abolished, effective January 1, 1912, by the Judicial Code of 1911 (36 Stat. 1167), March 3, 1911, with jurisdiction, records, and pending cases transferred from each circuit court to the appropriate U.S. district courts.\n\nConfederate States district courts were successors to U.S. district courts within the states comprising the Confederate States of America, 1861-65. At the end of the war, U.S. district courts resumed jurisdiction.\n\nTop of Page\n\n21.2 Records of U.S. District and Other Courts in Alabama\n\n1813-1976\n\nTop of Page\n\n21.2.1 Records of the U.S. Territorial Court\n\nTextual Records (in Atlanta): Case files, 1813-18.\n\nTop of Page\n\n21.2.2 Records of the U.S. District Court for the Northern\n\nDistrict\n\nTextual Records (in Atlanta): Records of the Northeastern Division (Huntsville), including minute books, 1826-1963; dockets, 1838-1957; case files, 1866-1963; final record books, 1875-1931; and records relating to naturalization, 1875-94, 1909-11, and 1923-26.
