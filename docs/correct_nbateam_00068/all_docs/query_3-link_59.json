        "text": "Derek Fisher denied a rift in union leadership in a letter to NBA players Monday, telling them there have been “no side agreements, no side negotiations or anything close” with league officials. A story Saturday on Foxsports.com titled “Is Fisher in Stern’s pocket?” said there was a disagreement between Fisher and players’ association executive director Billy Hunter and that the Lakers’ guard had promised NBA commissioner David Stern that he could deliver a deal with a 50-50 split in basketball-related income. The story said Hunter confronted Fisher last Friday, the day talks with the league broke down, which led to the cancellation of the entire November schedule.\n\nFirst baseman Adrian Gonzalez, second baseman Dustin Pedroia and center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury became the first three Red Sox in 32 seasons to win American League Gold Gloves together. Gonzalez earned his first AL Gold Glove to go along with two he won in the NL while with San Diego, Pedroia won at second base for the first time since 2008 and Ellsbury picked up his first Gold Glove when the awards were announced last night. Clayton Kershaw, Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier became the first trio of Los Angeles Dodgers to win NL Gold Gloves in the same year, and Kershaw became a first-time winner at pitcher. Ethier earned his first Gold Glove in the outfield and Kemp regained the NL award he earned in 2009.\n\nBrian Cashman signed a three-year contract with the New York Yankees, a day after his previous deal as general manager expired. Cashman has been GM since February 1998, when he succeeded Bob Watson. The only general manager to serve longer with the Yankees was Ed Barrow from 1920 to 1945. Under Cashman, the team has won four World Series titles and six AL pennants.\n\nThe Big East is ready to start adding members after having spent the last month and a half losing them. A person familiar with the decision said the Big East will invite Boise State, Navy and Air Force for football only and SMU, Houston and Central Florida for all sports in upcoming days. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the conference was not ready to announce its plan. Commissioner John Marinatto met with the league’s presidents at a Philadephia hotel yesterday, but declined to publicly elaborate on the Big East’s next moves. He said he expected the targeted schools to accept, but details still must be worked out with each. “As we’ve learned over the last two months, don’t believe anything anybody tells you. Nothing’s done until it is over. So I’m obviously being very cautious and that’s why I’m reluctant to say names of schools,” he said. Marinatto did acknowledge the league intends to expand west. Boise State and Air Force, both in the Mountain West Conference, and SMU and Houston, members of Conference USA, would be in the Big East’s western division, along with Louisville and Cincinnati. Navy, an independent, and UCF, also from CUSA, would be part of the league’s eastern division along with Connecticut, South Florida, Rutgers and another school. The league would then likely play a conference championship game. The Big East has been working on a plan to add those six schools and reconfigure as a 12-team football conference since soon after Syracuse and Pittsburgh announced Sept. 18 they would be leaving for the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nInterim Big 12 commissioner Chuck Neinas said he expects West Virginia to start play in the conference next season despite the Big East’s attempts to keep the university from a quick exit. Neinas attended a reception in Morgantown officially welcoming the Mountaineers into the Big 12 yesterday. A day earlier, the university sued the Big East, seeking to clear the way for it to start Big 12 play next fall. The Big East has said it plans to keep West Virginia for two more years\n\nBrittney Griner of Baylor is a unanimous choice on The Associated Press’ preseason All-America team in women’s basketball. The 6-foot-8 junior received all 40 votes from a national media panel, becoming the eighth player to be on every ballot. Griner is joined on the preseason squad by Notre Dame’s Skylar Diggins, Stanford’s Nnemkadi Ogwumike, Miami’s Shenise Johnson and Tennessee’s Shekinna Stricklen.\n\nThe Oakland Raiders signed wide receiver T.J. Houshmandzadeh. The team announced the move yesterday after watching Houshmandzadeh work out. The signing gives new quarterback Carson Palmer a receiver he knows extremely well. The two were teammates in Cincinnati for six seasons, and both had their greatest NFL success when they were together. Houshmandzadeh, 34, had been out of the league since playing with Baltimore last season but had been working out in Southern California with Palmer before the Raiders acquired the quarterback last month.\n\nNovak Djokovic made his return after missing six weeks with a back injury and defeated Xavier Malisse, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, in the first round of the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland. The top-ranked Serb improved his season record to 65-3. On the night after Halloween, Djokovic arrived on court for the first time since Sept. 18 wearing a fright mask resembling rock star Alice Cooper. Dressed all in black, Djokovic broke the Belgian opponent’s first service game."
