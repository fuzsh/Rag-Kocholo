        "text": "Water under the bridge.\n\nMatt Barnes says he’s cool with ex-teammate Derek Fisher after their infamous 2015 altercation, when Barnes learned Fisher, the then-Knicks coach, was dating his ex-wife, Gloria Govan, and was spending time with their then 6-year-old twin sons, Carter and Isaiah.\n\nBarnes recalled the feud while on the “Charges With Rex Chapman” podcast with his “All the Smoke” co-host Stephen Jackson.\n\n“Fast forward, we buried the hatchet, we spoke, because they’re still together,” Barnes said about Fisher and Govan, whose wedding was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“To me, it’s about raising these twins the best we possibly can, and co-parenting. So now he and I are cool. We’re on the same page. We communicate and see each other when we’re at events. They’ve been to my house for the twins’ birthday, I’ve been to their place,” Barnes said about his relationship with Fisher.\n\n“But obviously it’ll be something that’s kind of in infamy now because Kanye [West] rapped about it [in his “30 Hours” song], and everyone thinks he stole my chick — like, he started dating my ex-wife, that’s what it was. He didn’t steal s–t from me.\n\n“What I’m tripping off is that you’re in my house that I pay for with my kids and you didn’t tell me, that’s what I told him.”\n\nJackson chimed in after and added, “All the women in the world and you choose your teammate’s girl?”\n\nFisher, the current coach of the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks, and Barnes were teammates on the Lakers for two seasons from 2010-12.\n\nIn October 2015, The Post exclusively reported that Barnes, who was on the Grizzlies at the time, abruptly exited the team’s California training camp to drive 95 miles to “beat the s–t” out of Fisher after learning about his romance with Govan.\n\nBarnes discovered news of the relationship during a phone call with his and Govan’s twins, when he heard Fisher in the background at the home he once shared with Govan.\n\nBarnes did indeed make the trip, and came to blows with Fisher at a backyard gathering, where Fisher, Govan and a number of others were in attendance.\n\n“I was on his a–, and every time I was on him they would break me up,” Barnes recalled of the fight during the recent podcast appearance. “They finally let me get him the third time when I finally got some shots in and then they broke it up again.”\n\nBarnes filed for divorce from Govan in January 2015, LA court records show.\n\nThe retired NBA champion met Govan when she was 12, and began dating the former “Basketball Wives LA” star in 2006, when he played for the Warriors. They married in 2012."
