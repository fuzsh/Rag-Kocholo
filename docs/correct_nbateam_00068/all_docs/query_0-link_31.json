        "text": "In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, veteran point guard Derek Fisher said his decision to leave the Mavericks on Dec. 22, only to resurface with Oklahoma City last week, should not be construed as unhappiness or dissatisfaction with his time in Dallas.\n\nAnd yet, in his next breath to The Times, Fisher, did himself no favors with the Mavericks organization or its fans by admitting that his decision to chase a title ring with the Thunder is “something I deserved to do for myself.”\n\nFisher, 38, only played nine games as a Maverick, all as a starter, averaging 8.6 points and 3.4 assists. He is scoreless in two games with the Thunder. When he requested that the Mavericks waive him on Dec. 22, he cited a knee strain and a desire to be with his family in Los Angeles.\n\nMavericks owner Mark Cuban last week reacted with obvious sarcasm to Fisher’s sudden change of heart, saying, “Look, I understand completely. From the time Derek was here to his signing with OKC, his kids are older, they can deal with things better. So I understand him having more comfort in being away from them.”\n\n“I was being open and honest at the time and I’m being open and honest now,” Fisher told The Times. “At the time, I felt strong about the decision on a personal level. It wasn’t anything about Dallas or Mark that I was not happy about. Just personally, I didn’t enjoy being away from my family at the time.\n\n“Over the last couple of months, being out of the game and having a chance to reflect on some things and think about some things, when this opportunity presented itself and I thought about the totality of my career, I decided that this was something I deserved to do for myself. Sometimes as a leader, you can’t make decisions based on what other people are going to think or how they’re going to feel. You just do what you think is right at that time and that’s what I’m doing here.”\n\nLast week, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle diplomatically said he was “going to take (Fisher) at his word,” that he truly left the Mavericks to return to his family. Carlisle added, “My opinion is he’s earned the right to do what’s best for him.”\n\nFisher, who won five championship rings with the Lakers and played in last season’s NBA Finals as a member of the Thunder, apparently agrees with Carlisle. His Dallas departure marked the third time in his career that he has persuaded a team to nullify his contract. It happened with Utah in 2007 (after Fisher’s daughter was diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer) and with Houston last March.\n\n“I respect Mark, I respected Coach Carlisle, I respect their team,” Fisher told The Times. “That will never change, but it’s not about everyone else necessarily. It’s just about making a decision I felt was best for me at this time.”\n\nRecall that after his first practice in Dallas, on Nov. 29, Fisher declared: “I told (teammates) today, ‘This is not a pit stop. This is not kind of the final whatever before I decide to retire soon.’ I’m here to give everything I have to help this team right now and continue to build as we go through this season.”\n\nFisher’s former Mavericks teammates last week took the high road and declined to comment, although a couple of them were visibly annoyed. FYI, Oklahoma City visits Dallas one more time this season, on March 17. Could be an eventful St. Patty’s evening for Mr. Fisher."
