        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks will waive point guard Derek Fisher at Fisher's request, according to ESPN's Marc Stein.\n\nFisher, 38, has played in 16 seasons since being drafted in the first round of the 1996 NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. In his first season with the Mavericks, Fisher played in nine games, all starts, replacing Darren Collison in the starting lineup. In his nine games with the Mavericks, Fisher averaged 25.4 minutes with 8.6 points and 3.6 assists per game.\n\nStein also reports that the Mavericks will call up Chris Douglas-Roberts to replace Fisher. A second-round pick in the 2008 NBA Draft, Douglas-Roberts has played in 155 NBA games with the Nets and Bucks, making 53 starts. He hasn't played in a game since April 2011, but averaged 20.1 minutes and 7.3 points per game in that season.\n\nFisher suffered a right knee injury during Tuesday's night game against the Philadelphia 76ers and did not play in games on Thursday or Friday.\n\nUpdated:\n\nFisher sent out a series of tweets about the decision to ask for release from the team:\n\nIn Tuesday's game against Philadelphia I suffered an injury to my patellar tendon. The recovery time will be approximately 2 weeks. With this news & the difficulty I have been having being away from my family I have asked the organization to waive me so I can return home.\n\nMark Cuban has been extremely supportive and has granted me this request. I cannot say enough good things about this organization. From Mark, to Coach Carlisle, to the players on the Mavericks team, I sincerely thank them for the opportunity.\n\nI have made decisions in the past, leaving money & opportunity on the table, & I will need to do that again. My family is my priority and that is where I choose to be. I won't close the possibility that I will play again, however, for now my family & being close to them remains the priority."
