        "text": "Derek Fisher is partnered with Pro Sharna Burgess. Watch their Meet the Cast video now!\n\nDerek Fisher spent his entire pre-NBA life in Little Rock, Arkansas. His work ethic and determination were evident even from a young age, but basketball was always what drove him. A stand-out guard in high school, he starred for Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High. Even as a teenager, his leadership qualities were on display for all those who encountered him.\n\nIn 1996 he was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers and went on to play more than 18 seasons in the NBA, a majority with the Lakers, with whom he won 5 NBA Championships. Fisher is the all-time NBA record holder in playoff games played. While playing for the Lakers, he hit a buzzer beater with 0.4 second left in game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference Semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs, which the NBA lists as the 18th-greatest playoff moment of all time. Fisher also served as president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), while playing.\n\nIn 2014 he was hired by the New York Knicks to be the team's head coach and became one of the only players to get a head coaching job in the NBA directly from playing. In 2016 he moved back to Los Angeles and began to work professionally as a broadcaster, making appearances on TNT, NBA TV and Spectrum SportsNet. Fisher made multiple appearances on TNT's Inside the NBA and was on TNT's new Player's Only coverage, where former NBA players provided color commentary on games. He worked alongside with Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill and Brent Barry, among others. At the start of the 2016-17 NBA season, Fisher joined Spectrum SportsNet as an in-studio analyst for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nFisher's passion for impacting the lives of young people motivated him to create a camp experience for children and teens of all skill levels. In 2009 he started the Derek Fisher Basketball Academy, which is dedicated and focused on developing the basketball, leadership and life skills of each camper.\n\nHe currently resides in Los Angeles with his family."
