        "text": "Fisher was released by the Twins on Saturday, Brandon Warne of Access Twins reports.\n\nFisher missed out on an Opening Day roster spot as a non-roster invitee this spring and failed to make a case for a promotion while with Triple-A St. Paul, hitting just .158/.259/.305 in 27 games. That line means he'll almost certainly be stuck searching for a minor-league deal on the open market.\n\nThe Twins reassigned Fisher to minor-league camp Wednesday.\n\nFisher, who joined the Twins in December on a minor-league contract, fell short in his bid for a reserve outfield gig with the big club. The 28-year-old has seen big-league action in each of the past five seasons, but as a non-40-man-roster player, Fisher will face a tougher path in earning a promotion to Minnesota. He's expected to spend the majority of the upcoming season at Triple-A St. Paul.\n\nFisher signed a minor-league contract with the Twins on Thursday, Darren Wolfson of Channel 5 Saint Paul reports.\n\nFisher missed the start of the 2021 campaign due to hamstring and calf injuries but appeared in four big-league games with the Brewers last year. However, he spent most of the season at Triple-A Nashville. Across 25 contests in the minors, the 28-year-old hit .205 with a homer, 11 runs and eight RBI. Although he's appeared in just 20 major-league games across the last two seasons, he could be in the mix for a big-league roster spot in 2022.\n\nFisher was outrighted to Triple-A Nashville on Monday.\n\nFisher was designated for assignment last week, but he'll remain in the organization after he cleared waivers. The 27-year-old has appeared in 17 games for Triple-A Nashville this year and has hit .220 with a home run, five doubles, eight runs and six RBI.\n\nThe Brewers designated Fisher for assignment Tuesday, Tom Haudricourt of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.\n\nThe outfielder appeared in just four games for the Brewers, going 2-for-8 with a triple. Out of options, Fisher will join Triple-A Nashville unless another organization takes interest and claims him.\n\nFisher (hamstring) went 0-for-2 in Thursday's 7-3 loss to Colorado.\n\nFisher entered the game as a defensive replacement as part of a double-switch in the sixth inning. The outfielder wasn't able to make an impact at the plate in his Milwaukee debut. The 27-year-old figures to serve as a bench option going forward now that he's past his hamstring injury.\n\nFisher (hamstring) was reinstated from the 10-day injured list Thursday.\n\nFisher has been sidelined since the start of the regular season due to hamstring and calf issues, but he resumed his rehab assignment with Triple-A Nashville in early June. Across 17 rehab games, he hit .220 with a home run, eight runs and six RBI. The 27-year-old is out of minor-league options, so he'll join the Brewers for now and should serve mainly in a depth role.\n\nFisher (hamstring) was sent to Triple-A Nashville on Friday to resume his rehab assignment.\n\nFisher was placed on the injured list April 1 with a hamstring injury. He began a rehab assignment in early May but had it paused when he picked up a calf injury May 18. He'll now head back to Nashville in hopes of successfully getting some games under his belt with the Sounds.\n\nFisher (hamstring) had his rehab assignment paused by a calf injury Tuesday, Adam McCalvy of MLB.com reports.\n\nThe 27-year-old left Sunday's game with Triple-A Nashville due to an injury; it turns out he didn't aggravate the hamstring strain and is instead dealing with a new injury. It's unclear whether Fisher will be sidelined by this new issue for long enough that he'll be forced to restart his rehab program.\n\nFisher (hamstring) is expected to begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Nashville on Tuesday, Will Sammon of The Athletic reports.\n\nFisher has been sidelined since mid-March with a left hamstring strain, but the 27-year-old outfielder looks like he could be nearing the finish line in his recovery from the injury. Since he's been idle for more than six weeks, the Brewers will likely want Fisher to get in competitive at-bats across multiple games before bringing him back from the 10-day injured list. Once reinstated, Fisher will likely serve as a fourth or fifth outfielder for Milwaukee.\n\nThe Brewers placed Fisher (hamstring) on the 10-day injured list Thursday.\n\nFisher's bid for the Opening Day roster ended when he suffered a left hamstring strain in a March 14 Cactus League game. Billy McKinney ended up breaking camp with Milwaukee as the fifth outfielder behind Christian Yelich, Lorenzo Cain, Jackie Bradley and Avisail Garcia.\n\nFisher (hamstring) may not be able to get back on the field before the end of camp, Tom Haudricourt of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.\n\nFisher left Sunday's game against the Marines with a strained hamstring. He isn't expected to get back on the field until very late in camp at the earliest, which seemingly takes him out of contention for the Opening Day roster. Even when healthy, he'll be battling Tyrone Taylor and Billy McKinney for the fifth outfielder job.\n\nFisher (hamstring) is expected to miss time after leaving Sunday's spring game against Seattle, Tom Haudricourt of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.\n\nFisher was diagnosed with left hamstring discomfort following his early departure Sunday, and the injury will likely impact his availability for the start of the regular season. The 27-year-old was competing for a backup role in the outfield but could now have to begin the season in the minors following his injury.\n\nFisher exited Sunday's spring game against the Mariners due to left hamstring discomfort.\n\nFisher was removed from Sunday's game in the top of the fourth inning after sustaining a left hamstring injury while running from first to home. The 27-year-old is competing for a depth role in Milwaukee's outfield during spring training, and it's not yet clear whether he'll be forced to miss additional time.\n\nFisher left Sunday's spring game against the Mariners with an apparent hamstring injury, Adam McCalvy of MLB.com reports.\n\nFisher went from first to home on a Zach Green double in the top of the fourth inning Sunday, but he appeared hobbled as he went back to the dugout. Trainers appeared to be looking at his left hamstring in the dugout, and he was removed from the game as a result of the injury. The severity of the issue isn't yet known.\n\nFisher went 5-for-9 (.555) with a home run, two doubles, six RBI and three runs over his last five spring games.\n\nFisher went 0-for-5 over his first two appearances of the spring, but he has racked up all kinds of hits since. He is out of options, which will help his chances of remaining on the Brewers' roster when spring training comes to a close. However, if Lorenzo Cain (quad) is ready for Opening Day, there will only be one outfield spot -- at most -- up for grabs, and Fisher will need to beat out Tyrone Taylor to claim it.\n\nFisher has been traded from the Blue Jays to the Brewers in exchange for a player to be named later and cash considerations, Ben Nicholson-Smith of Sportsnet.ca reports.\n\nFisher appeared in just 16 games a season ago for the Blue Jays, slashing .226/.359/.452 with a home run and seven RBI in 31 at-bats. He'll likely have a chance to compete for a backup outfield role with Milwaukee during spring training.\n\nFisher (knee) has been designated for assignment by the Blue Jays.\n\nFisher missed the final several weeks of the regular season due to a right knee contusion, but he should be healthy heading into spring training in 2021. However, he'll be removed from the 40-man roster to make room for right-hander David Phelps. The 27-year-old slashed .226/.359/.452 with seven RBI over 39 plate appearances in 2020.\n\nFisher was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right knee contusion Wednesday, Ben Nicholson-Smith of Sportsnet.ca reports.\n\nFisher was hit by a pitch during a live batting practice session, and he'll miss at least 10 days as a result. With just under two weeks remaining in the regular season, it's unclear whether he'll be able to return prior to the postseason. Teoscar Hernandez (oblique) was activated from the injured list in a corresponding move and should serve as the primary right fielder going forward."
