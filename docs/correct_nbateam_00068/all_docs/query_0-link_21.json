        "text": "Is this the end for Derek Fisher? The point guard has asked for a release from the Dallas Mavericks, claiming that he’d like to be closer to his family, the Star-Telegram reports: “Stressing the need to be closer to his family in Los Angeles, Derek Fisher asked the Dallas Mavericks to release him from his contract on Saturday, and they promptly obliged. Fisher, 38, signed a one-year, $1.1 million contract with the Mavs on Nov. 29. But after less than a month with Dallas, he apparently could no longer accept being away from his family. Fisher released a statement about his request to be waived, saying: ‘In Tuesday’s game against Philadelphia, I suffered an injury to my patellar tendon. The recovery time will be approximately two weeks. With this news and the difficulty I have been having being away from my family, I have asked the organization to waive me so I can return home.’ … The Mavs, who visit the San Antonio Spurs tonight, will promote Chris Douglas-Roberts from the Texas Legends of the D-League to take Fisher’s roster spot.”"
