        "text": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is still a little salty over the way that Derek Fisher left the Mavericks after signing with them before saying he needed to \"spend time with his family\" only to then sign with Oklahoma City in 2012. From the New York Daily News after the Knicks' trip to Dallas this week:\n\nCuban still appears to harbor some ill-will toward first-year Knicks coach Derek Fisher, who requested his release after playing nine games for Dallas in 2012-13 to spend more time with his family before resurfacing later that season with Oklahoma City.\n\nAsked if he’s worried about Fisher’s commitment level with a struggling Knicks team, Cuban fired back, “No. I’m more concerned with his health and welfare. I know how hard it is for him to fly and travel and be away.”\n\nvia Mark Cuban still bitter of Derek Fisher leaving Mavericks - NY Daily News.\n\nCuban tends to hold grudges this way, and Fisher's whole situation was pretty, er... Fishy. He often found his way into whatever situation afforded him the best chance of winning a title, regardless of prior commitments. But then, given the way that players are treated by owners, and Fisher's first-hand experience with that as head of the union until last year, can you really blame him?"
