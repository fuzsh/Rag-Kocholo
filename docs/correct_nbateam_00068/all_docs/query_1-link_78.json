        "text": "WASHINGTON — Derek Fisher left without a word when he was fired just under a year ago, suddenly gone after struggling through as the first-time coach for the rebuilding franchise. But he opened up in an interview with Bleacher Report and had some harsh words for his former boss and mentor, Phil Jackson.\n\nFisher defended his work that showed a 40-96 record, but he felt was pushing the Knicks forward. But he also pointed out the difficulties of working for Jackson when neither one of them had a day of experience in the roles they were taking on.\n\n“We both didn’t know exactly what we were doing,” Fisher said. “Being the head coach is not like playing. Being president is not like being the head coach.”\n\nFisher, now working as a television studio analyst for Lakers games, has something in common with players and coaches in New York, feeling that Jackson’s presence loomed over the franchise. But as Jeff Hornacek saw early this season, Jackson’s discussions with the team and coaches about strategy created confusion as to who was in charge.\n\n\"One of the challenges for all of us was we were in the basketball department under the umbrella of Phil Jackson and who he was and who he is and what he was able to do as coach and leader,\" Fisher said. \"Then asking me as a head coach in a sense not to create the same results, but take the same system or way of playing and try and teach these guys how to play it — and utilize it in similar ways as when he taught it — I think at times it was more challenging for our players to really understand, 'Who am I committing myself to? Who am I selling myself to? Who am I running through the brick wall for?’ ”\n\nFisher’s tenure was marred not just by the record, which is understandable as Jackson tore down the roster, stripping it of talent in the franchise-worst 17-65 season that was Fisher's and Jackson’s first full year. He started his second season by flying home to Los Angeles after minicamp, and when he ended up in a fight with former teammate Matt Barnes over his relationship with Barnes’ estranged wife, he missed the first day of preseason workouts.\n\nFisher defended his coaching, insisting, “We were able to take a team that wasn’t as talented as the team they have now, and we were much better and much further along than this group is that they have now, because the foundation was being laid.”\n\nEmail: popper@northjersey.com"
