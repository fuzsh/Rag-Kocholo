        "text": "I had the opportunity yesterday to be on a panel at SecureWorld to discuss the challenges regarding #hiring in #cybersecurity (disregard my face below, I took it seriously üòâ). There were a lot of people there, so we all recognize that hiring or being hired is painful today. That's putting it mildly. The hiring process is a dumpster fire. On both sides. There are a lot of candidates looking for ways to beat the system, and hiring departments (or people) looking to make the system better at \"weeding out the chaff\". Hint: sometimes there is gold in that chaff.... There was a lot of good back and forth and some excellent questions, but one question came up that is still resonating with me. \"How do we diversify the talent pool?\" We tend to see similar profiles for roles, and as Arielle Baine mentioned, our unconscious bias can come into play. We think we know the profile we're looking for (whether it's race, gender, age, location, background, etc). The reality is that we often won't find that gem if we're looking for a specific bio. However, back to #diversifying the #talent pool. My response was that we need to get talent involved early. And I mean real early. Cybersecurity programs should be part of the middle and high school curriculum. And I don't just mean teaching kids the dangers online (ping me if you want more information on that üòÅ). I mean that we need to treat cybersecurity as an extension of #STEM. Channel those inner hackers early. We work in an exciting space, that excitement needs to be exposed to the younger age groups. Then we'll see a more diverse talent pool. Hopefully."
