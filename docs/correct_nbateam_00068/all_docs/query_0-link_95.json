        "text": "DALLAS — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shook his head, holding onto every syllable of P.J. Washington’s name.\n\nMaybe saying it aloud helped the unimaginable feel real.\n\nWashington’s latest 3-point barrage Saturday afternoon was key in the Mavericks’ Game 3 win over the Thunder, which gave Dallas a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\nWashington, arguably Dallas’ third-best player, scored 27 points. Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren, the Thunder’s second-and third-best players, combined for 29 points.\n\nMore: OKC Thunder lands No. 12 pick in 2024 NBA Draft lottery\n\n“He’s hooping,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “We’ve gotta turn that water off if we want to win the series.”\n\nFor whatever reason, something about the Thunder brings out the best in Washington.\n\n“When he was in Charlotte, it felt like every shot went in,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said.\n\nWashington was already a Thunder killer, but now he’s a Thunder playoff killer.\n\nIt made me think, what other under-the-radar players like Washington have given the Thunder problems in the playoffs?\n\nHere’s one surprise Thunder killer from every run.\n\nMore: Mussatto: OKC Thunder now in big trouble in NBA playoffs thanks to Mavericks' 16-0 run\n\nDerek Fisher, Lakers (2009-10)\n\nIt’s still crazy that Oklahoma City’s first-ever playoff opponent was a Kobe Bryant-led Lakers squad that went on to win the NBA title.\n\nOf course Bryant and Pau Gasol were the pillars of that team, but a 35-year-old Derek Fisher helped do the Thunder in.\n\nFisher, a 35% 3-point shooter that season, went 14-of-30 (47%) from behind the arc in that series, which the Lakers won in six.\n\nFisher later helped the Thunder win more than a few playoff games.\n\nJ.J. Barea, Mavericks (2010-11)\n\nThe 5-foot-10 Puerto Rican drove Thunder fans crazy.\n\nDespite playing the seventh-most minutes for the Mavericks in the 2011 Western Conference Finals against the Thunder, Barea was Dallas’ fourth-leading scorer.\n\nBarea averaged 11.4 points on 48% shooting. He went 6-of-13 from three. He had 15 assists against three turnovers.\n\nStephen Jackson, Spurs (2011-12)\n\nJackson was traded twice at the 2012 trade deadline. First from Milwaukee to Golden State, and then Golden State to San Antonio.\n\nThe 33-year-old Jackson, despite nearing the end of his career, gave the Spurs good minutes against the Thunder.\n\nJackson averaged 11.8 points in the series on otherworldly shooting splits: 66% from the field, 68% (17-of-25) from 3-point range and 89% from the foul line.\n\nOKC overcame Jackson’s out-of-body series to advance to the NBA Finals.\n\nMore: What sunk Thunder vs Mavericks in Game 3 loss? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander needs some help\n\nPatrick Beverley, Rockets (2012-13)\n\nBeverley didn’t have a killer series, but he killed the Thunder’s chances of a long playoff run when he crashed into Russell Westbrook’s knee in Game 2 of a first-round series.\n\nWestbrook missed the rest of the playoffs with a torn meniscus. The Thunder got by the Rockets before losing to the Grizzlies in the second round.\n\nDanny Green, Spurs (2013-14)\n\nWashington’s 3-point shooting could shift the series like Green’s did in 2014.\n\nGreen shot 20-of-37 (54%) from deep in the 2014 Western Conference Finals. Green was 7-of-10 from three in the Spurs’ 35-point win in Game 2.\n\nSan Antonio won the series in six.\n\nHarrison Barnes, Warriors (2015-16)\n\nGame 6 Klay, I know, but Klay Thompson is too good to qualify for this list.\n\nBarnes is admittedly a reach, but he had a good series, shooting 48% overall, including 10-of-19 from three.\n\nIt was Barnes’ last year in The Bay before you-know-what happened.\n\nLou Williams, Rockets (2016-17)\n\nHis Rockets stint was brief, but Williams had himself a series against the Thunder.\n\nHe was Houston’s second-leading scorer, averaging 18.8 points on 48% shooting. Williams shot 41% from 3-point range and 88% from the foul line.\n\nThe Rockets won the first-round series in five. Williams scored 22 points off the bench in the closeout game.\n\nMore: How OKC Thunder's Mark Daigneault ascended from UConn manager to NBA Coach of the Year\n\nJoe Ingles, Jazz (2017-18)\n\nThe series when Ingles punked Paul George. What a bizarre beef.\n\nIngles played excellent defense against George, but the Aussie forward was even better offensively.\n\nIngles averaged 14.2 points on 44% shooting. He shot a whopping 47% (21-of-45) from 3-point range as the Jazz won the first-round series in six.\n\nAl-Farouq Aminu, Trail Blazers (2018-19)\n\nThis first-round series, which Portland won in five, is known for two things: Damian Lillard’s iconic walk-off shot and Al-Farouq Aminu.\n\nYou don’t recall Aminu’s impact? Me neither, but the honorary killer title had to go to someone.\n\nAminu averaged 11 points and seven rebounds in the series while knocking down 41% of his 3-pointers.\n\nRobert Covington, Rockets (2019-20)\n\nThe seven-game bubble series didn’t feel like real life.\n\nBut it happened, and Covington thrived against the Thunder. He averaged 13.3 points on 50% shooting while doing everything defensively — 2.4 steals and 1.6 blocks per game.\n\nThe Thunder had 37 steals in the series. Covington had 17 by himself.\n\nMore: Patrick Mahomes says OKC Thunder guard Lu Dort could play in the NFL"
