        "text": "he next major move in the new Phil Jackson administration was to secure, 5-time champion, 13th time All-Star, Derek Fisher as the new head coach of The New York Knicks, in a deal worth $5 million dollar over 5 years.\n\nKnicks President Phil Jackson who is challenged to rebuild the Knicks and surrounding himself with people he’s associated with and has alliances to, coached Fisher on all of his five Los Angeles Lakers championship teams from 2000 to 2010. Now Fisher follows Jason Kidd who coached the Brooklyn Nets directly after retiring from the Knicks and makes that transition into head-coaching immediately after retiring as a player with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\n“Coaching allows for you to positively impact other people’s lives,” Fisher said of his new position as the 26th head coach of the New York Knicks. “That’s exciting to me.”\n\nMany were disappointed when Jackson’s first choice, Steve Kerr, decided to take the vacant Golden State Warriors job but I think that was actually a good look. Personally I don’t think Steve Kerr would have held up well under the sometime relentless and unforgiving New York Media. I believe Fisher has the muscle, thick-skin and championship pedigree and a just the right amount of arrogance that New Yorkers appreciate (as long as your winning)!\n\nWith all the African-American head coaches that were recently fired including the former Knicks head coach, Mike Woodson and former New York Knick player and former Golden State Warrior coach, Mark Jackson, I am glad that Derek Fisher was generously compensated as the 18 year veteran now becomes a rookie coach.\n\nWhat does this mean for Melo staying or leaving, I don’t know, but I do believe Phil Jackson has taken another important step in putting his stamp on the organization he’s challenged to restore to a winning franchise. I believe Phil will be hands on in the beginning at training camp as coach, training Fisher and composing the remainder of the coaching staff. The fact, Fisher is open to learning from his former coach I think makes this a good look for the future of The Knicks!"
