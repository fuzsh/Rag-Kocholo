        "text": "Former New York Knicks coach Derek Fisher is on his way to the altar.\n\nFisher, 43, proposed to his girlfriend Gloria Govan at a family get-together on April 7, according to TMZ Sports. The two have been dating since 2015. It will be the second marriage for both.\n\nGovan was previously married to Fisher's former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Matt Barnes.\n\nThe two players have a history between them; they were involved in an altercation at Govan's home in Los Angeles in October 2015 and a fight reportedly took place. No charges were filed, however, and the two apparently have put aside their differences.\n\nBarnes shared his congratulations on Instagram on Tuesday, writing in part: \"You guys want this to be an issue, it’s not! I’ve known about this for a few weeks & I am all for it..\n\nMy kids matter to me at this point, that’s it!\"\n\nFisher won five NBA titles as a player with the Lakers and served as the Knicks head coach from June 2014 to February 2016.\n\nAfter leaving the Knicks, he competed on Season 25 of ABC's Dancing With the Stars, but was eliminated in the third round."
