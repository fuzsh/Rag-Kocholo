Dallas Mavericks point guard Derek Fisher will be waived from the team at his request, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports. The Mavericks later announced the move.

Fisher signed with the Mavericks on Nov. 29 and had been a good fit in his short time with the team, but he did not like being away from his family in Los Angeles and asked Dallas owner Mark Cuban to respect his wishes and facilitate this move. The person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said Fisher has already left the team and is in Los Angeles rehabilitating the right knee that he injured on Tuesday in a game against Philadelphia.

Fisher and his wife, Candace, have 6-year-old twins (a boy and girl), a 10-year-old girl and a 17-year-old stepson. The Mavericks are expected to call up Chris Douglas-Roberts from their Texas Legends team in the NBA Development League to take Fisher's place, a person with knowledge of that deal also confirmed.

"In Tuesday's game against Philadelphia I suffered an injury to my patellar tendon," Fisher said in a statement. "The recovery time will be approximately two weeks. With this news and the difficulty I have been having being away from my family I have asked the organization to waive me so I can return home.

"Mavericks owner) Mark Cuban has been extremely supportive and has granted me this request. I cannot say enough good things about this organization. From Mark, to Coach (Rick) Carlisle, to the players on the Mavericks team, I sincerely thank them for the opportunity. I have made decisions in the past, leaving money and opportunity on the table, and I will need to do that again. My family is my priority and that is where I choose to be. I won't close the possibility that I will play again, however, for now my family and being close to them remains the priority."
