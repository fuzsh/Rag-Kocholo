On Wednesday night, the struggling Dallas Mavericks announced their intention to sign veteran point guard Derek Fisher, providing the five-time NBA champion passes a physical on Thursday. Fisher has played nearly 1,200 NBA games since entering the league in 1996, sharing court time with dozens of players during time with the Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, and Oklahoma City Thunder.

With Fisher about to join his fifth, and possibly last NBA franchise, we thought it best to take a look at some of Fisher's more notable NBA teammates through the years.
