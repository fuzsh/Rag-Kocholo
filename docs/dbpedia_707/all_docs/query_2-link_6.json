        "text": "Yes. The Green to Gold program has four options designed to help enlisted Soldiers go to college, earn a degree while serving, and commission as Army Officers.\n\nCommissioned Officers apply their advanced skills and knowledge to plan and lead missions, as well as train and mentor teams. Warrant Officers remain single-specialty Officers with career tracks that progress within their field, allowing them to serve as experts and advisors.\n\nOnce you’ve enlisted, you’ll join other Army Soldiers in the three phases of Basic Combat Training, which usually take about ten weeks depending on your chosen specialty. Once you complete Basic Combat Training, you’ll receive your assignment.\n\nEvery situation is unique, so it may help to reach out to a recruiter or read the requirements to join. But generally, if you’re a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, and 17 to 32 years old with a high school diploma, you’re off to a great start.\n\nYes, you can work with an Army career counselor to pursue new jobs and promotional opportunities with a reclassification request.\n\nYes, you can join with up to four of your friends through the Buddy Team Enlistment Option. All friends will need to enlist on the same day and agree to the same Army job. Then, you’ll attend Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training together and be stationed together when you start your job."
