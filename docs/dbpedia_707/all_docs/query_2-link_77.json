        "text": "Introduction to West Yorkshire Police\n\nAs the fourth largest of the 43 Home Office forces, the West Yorkshire Police force area is varied, combining busy cities and towns with quiet villages and picturesque rural locations. Not only the locations, but the communities are equally as varied, representing a diverse range of ethnic, cultural and economic backgrounds.\n\nThe Force collaborates across the Yorkshire and Humber Region and wider North Eastern Region, leading on a number of national and regional policing responsibilities.\n\nServing the 2.2 million people living in West Yorkshire, policing is delivered from the five policing districts of Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield where day-to-day policing services are carried out across the county.\n\nWe look for all kinds of skills, recognising it takes all kinds of people to protect the public. Problem solving, compassion, resilience, respect, courage, and teamwork. These are the qualities we are looking for. To truly reflect the communities we serve, we’re particularly keen to recruit people from under- represented groups, such as those from black, Asian, and other ethnic backgrounds.\n\nTop of the page ^\n\nTop of the page ^\n\nStandards of Professional Behaviour\n\nThe ten standards of professional behaviour are:\n\nHonesty and integrity\n\nI will be honest and act with integrity at all times, and will not compromise or abuse my position.\n\nAuthority, respect and courtesy\n\nI will act with self-control and tolerance, treating members of the public and colleagues with respect and courtesy. I will use my powers and authority lawfully and proportionately, and will respect the rights of individuals.\n\nEquality and diversity\n\nI will act with fairness and impartiality. Will not discriminate unlawfully or unfairly.\n\nUse of Force\n\nI will only use force as part of my role/responsibilities, and only to the extent that is necessary/proportionate/reasonable in all circumstances.\n\nOrders and instructions\n\nI will, as a Police Officer, give and carry out lawful orders only, and will abide by Police Regulations. I will give reasonable instructions only, and will follow all reasonable instructions.\n\nDuties and responsibilities\n\nI will be diligent in the exercise of my duties and responsibilities.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nI will treat information with respect, and access or disclose it only in the proper course of my duties.\n\nFitness for work\n\nI will ensure when on duty or at work, that I am fit to carry out my responsibilities.\n\nConduct\n\nI will behave in a manner, whether on or off duty, which does not bring disgrace on the police service or undermine public confidence in policing.\n\nChallenging and reporting improper behaviour\n\nI will report, challenge or take action against the conduct of colleagues which has fallen below the standards of professional behaviour.\n\nTop of the page ^\n\nMore information can be found on the Police Officer section of the West Yorkshire Police website – www.westyorkshire.police.uk/joinus\n\nThe training programme is fully timetabled, with set annual leave periods. You may not be able to take additional leave during the first 12 months of your training.\n\nAll student officers will need to complete a two or three year probation period, depending on their entry route. During this period you will be assessed based on attendance, behaviour, operational performance and completion of academic assessments (where appropriate).\n\nPC Abdul Rahman (PCDA Student Officer)\n\n\"Deciding to become a Police Officer is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Of course, some parts of policing can be challenging at times, but by focusing on serving the public, I know I can play my part in having a positive impact on my community, which feels incredibly rewarding.\n\n\"Being a Police Officer is much more than ‘locking up the bad guys’, the role is vast and varies day to day. I particularly enjoy going to jobs where I can use a range of skills, such as cases involving mental health issues where people are struggling and I can get them the support they need.\"\n\nTop of the page ^\n\nHealth and Fitness\n\nThe fitness test involves a multi-stage shuttle run, also known as the ‘bleep test’, which is a physical test of your aerobic capacity (stamina). It involves running between two points that are 15 metres apart (a “shuttle”) and should take a total of 3.5 minutes. The pace of each shuttle is synchronised with a pre-recorded audio tape that bleeps at set intervals - and speeds up during the test. The idea is to reach the other side before the next bleep. Some people worry about not being fit enough to pass the test but, as long as you’re reasonably fit and have prepared enough in advance, you should be fine. The required pass mark is to run to level 5.4.\n\nPolice Officers need to maintain a reasonable level of fitness to do their job well. Therefore, further fitness tests will take place throughout your basic training and then as part of yearly officer safety training.\n\nTop Tips\n\nDon’t start training the week before the test! We’d recommend training up to six weeks before the test.\n\nIf you’ve not exercised regularly in the past, seek medical advice before starting your training. Start slowly and build up the length and intensity of your sessions.\n\nAlways warm up and stretch before exercising. And don’t forget to cool down properly.\n\nBuild in toning and strengthening exercises to the end of your runs, e.g. press-ups and crunches. They’ll really help increase your overall fitness.\n\nDon’t forget to keep your fluid levels up as you train.\n\nPractice sessions are available through the Positive Action Team.\n\nTop of the page ^\n\nPolice Officer Roles\n\nThere are a number of roles and specialisms that you can undertake once you have completed your probationary training period. Below are a number of different Police Officer roles with brief descriptions of some of the day-to-day actions they carry out;\n\nTop of the page ^\n\nPolice Staff\n\nAcross the Force, there are over 700 different police staff roles.\n\nIn West Yorkshire Police, our Police Officers, staff and volunteers work daily to make a difference in people’s lives, showing courage, determination, teamwork, and compassion. Across the Force, there are over 700 different Police staff roles.\n\nThere are a wide range of career opportunities, including forensic roles, Police Staff Investigators, Detention Officers and Police Community Support Officers, as well as call handlers, analysts, data and information roles, researchers, and legal professionals.\n\nYou may be unaware that you possess the skills we need.

Specialised roles may require a degree, however many entry level ones do not.\n\nIf you develop through your career and gain an increase in seniority, you may progress through roles at Senior Officer (SO) grades, with a starting salary of £31,434. Principal Officer (PO) roles have a starting salary of £35,223 and Executive Officer (EO) roles have a starting salary of £59,903.\n\n*salaries correct as of March 2023\n\nTop of the page ^\n\nPolice Staff Roles\n\nDress Code\n\nAs a public service, it is important that West Yorkshire Police portrays an image which instils confidence, credibility and respect in the public we serve. No member of the public should be made to feel uncomfortable or threatened by the dress or appearance of an employee or volunteer of the Force. This also extends to presenting a professional image to colleagues and other organisations.\n\nWe welcome and accept all styles and recognise the unique differences of hair. Workplace adjustments may be required to suit hair, such as afro styles, dreadlocks, and protective styles. Hair dyes of any colour may be used, however this is restricted to a single colour.\n\nTattoos are not a bar to appointment. However, some tattoos could potentially offend members of the public or colleagues or could bring discredit to the Police Service. Therefore, visible tattoos on hands and neck will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTop of the page ^\n\nVetting\n\nWhat does vetting mean?\n\nWe will carry out security checks on you and your:\n\nSpouse/Partner\n\nFather/Stepfather/Mother’s partner\n\nMother/Stepmother/Father’s partner\n\nBrothers/Sisters (full/half/step)\n\nChildren/Children of your partner (only those aged 10 years and over)\n\nAny other adult living at your address\n\nFinancial circumstances\n\nSocial media accounts\n\nWhat if I have a relative who has convictions?\n\nIf your friends or family members have criminal convictions, you must disclose this when asked on your vetting application.

In particular, the following would result in rejection: offences where vulnerable people were targeted; offences motivated by hate or discrimination; domestic abuse offences.\n\nDo I have to declare if I was arrested but not charged?\n\nYes. You must declare if you have ever been subject to a criminal investigation whether or not this led to a prosecution. Failure to make such declarations will lead to your application being rejected.\n\nWhat if I’ve been bankrupt before?\n\nYou can still apply but only if it is three years after bankruptcy debts have been discharged.
