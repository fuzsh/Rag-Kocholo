        "text": "Environmental Careers Overview\n\nAdvocacy, Outreach, and Communication\n\nJobs in this area are generally with non-profit organizations, state and local agencies, and business. They involve educating the public about an environmental issue like biodiversity, urban sprawl, energy conservation or recycling. Employers want people with strong organization and communication skills and experience with computers. A BA or BS is required, but the degree can be almost anything, though an environmental studies degree is preferred. Experience in marketing, fund raising, business and environmental issues is a plus.\n\nPolicy and Regulation\n\nThese jobs can be with non-profits, government or industry. In this case, employers look for people who can write, analyze, interpret or administer environmental regulations. In some cases, the job involves lobbying government to pass laws, to alter their interpretation, or to implement them. It helps to have strong research skills, some kind of technical background, and familiarity with environmental laws. There is no particular degree required in the field though individual listings request everything from law to chemical engineering.\n\nConservation and Natural Resources\n\nHere the educational requirements are more specific and employers (government and industry) want someone with a B.S. or M.S. in wildlife biology, forestry or soils. Oral and written communication skills are important, though not as important as for advocacy jobs. The ability to use text, spreadsheet, GIS, Arcview and html software is highly desirable. Additional qualities include effective people skills, office skills and the ability to meet deadlines. Being in good physical shape, and in some parts of the country, having the ability to speak Spanish are advantageous.\n\nEnvironmental Engineering and Scientific Services\n\nEnvironmental Engineering and Scientific Services has the most job listings - 32%, mainly with industry and to a lesser extent with the government. These jobs invariably require a technical degree in engineering, biology, geology, chemistry, math or industrial hygiene. Employers also rank written and oral communication skills very highly, along with the ability to do data analysis and familiarity with federal and state environmental laws.\n\nOutdoor and Environmental Education\n\nEmployers in this category include private educational enterprises and programs affiliated with schools and colleges or with local, state and federal parks. They are looking for a degree in education and/or conservation and natural resources. Oral skills are important, especially the ability to speak in public and tell stories. One to two years of teaching experience is desirable, along with experience working with children and youth in outdoor settings. Outdoor skills, safety training and some knowledge of practical maintenance (carpentry, plumbing, etc.) are valuable.\n\nSkills and Careers Assessments\n\nCreating a career path requires you to examine your skill set so you can search for careers that are suited to your individual strengths. Skills and careers assessment tests can help you determine which types of positions are best suited to your interests and abilities. Contact the MU Career Center to complete the following assessments with a Career Specialist:\n\nSelf-Directed Search\n\nMissouri Card Sort\n\nDiscover\n\nStrengthsQuest\n\nMU Career Center\n\n909 Lowry Mall\n\nM-F 9:00AM-5:00PM\n\n(573)882-6801\n\nSkills and Career Assessment Websites\n\nJob Hunter’s Bible\n\nRiley Guide\n\nSkill Scan\n\nPractical Considerations\n\nIt may seem hasty to make decisions about your future now, but if you can identify aspects of the lifestyle you want in the future, it can help you determine which careers will make the best fit. Ask yourself the following questions:\n\nWhere do you want to live? In the United States or abroad? In a rural or urban area?\n\nDo you plan on having a family with a spouse and/or children? How will a particular career path affect your current and/or potential family members?\n\nDo you want to travel for work frequently, sometimes, or rarely?\n\nWhat type of work environment are you most comfortable in? Do you want to work closely with other people or do you prefer self-directed work?\n\nWhat salary range would you like to reach in five years? Ten? Twenty?\n\nSuggested Career Assessment Reading\n\nBoldt, Laurence. Zen and the Art of Making a Living: A Practical Guide to Creative Career Design. New York: Arkana, 1999.\n\nBolles, Richard.

You can maximize the benefits and academic experience of a course by using the following suggestions:\n\nRead sources frequently cited in your assigned course readings. The sources are probably important to the field and contain information that will help you understand methods, assimilate information, analyze issues, and become a strong researcher.\n\nDo not be passive about your education! When you are in class, interact with your classmates and the instructor. When you are completing course-related readings, develop a list of relevant questions to bring up in class and/or to discuss with your instructor during their office hours.\n\nDevelop a professional relationship with your professors. Take the time to visit their office hours and talk with them about the things you are learning in class, your research, and discuss your questions. Do not be intimidated by your professors. Most of them chose a career in teaching because they enjoy working with students. In the future you may need letters of recommendation from your professors, so the more positive things they know about you and your work, the better.\n\nDo not look at your courses in isolation; try to make connections between course materials. Synthesizing information will hone your analytical skills and help you examine the big and small pictures.\n\nOrganize and save all of your relevant course materials. It is very likely that you will be able to utilize past course materials (such as class notes) in a future course.\n\nDevelop your writing by visiting The Writing Center and speak with your instructors about approaches you can take to improve your writing. Remember, well-written papers are papers that have been revised. Writing is a recursive process.\n\nFind academic journals related to your area of study and read them. Journals will help you identify current topics in your field. Numerous journals are available in the library and through inter-library loan. Many academic journals provide subscriptions to students at a reduced rate.\n\nConsider presenting your research at the Undergraduate Research Forum or publish your work in the Artifacts Journal, an undergraduate research journal. Doing so will help you get valuable feedback from professors and peers on your research. Presenting or publishing your research will help you develop your public speaking and/or writing skills. Presentations and published works are excellent to include in resumes and graduate applications. Fellowships are available through the MU Fellowship Office.\n\nIf you excel in a subject, consider tutoring people who need additional help. In addition to the satisfaction of helping someone else, tutoring can expand your understanding of a subject and develop fluency in expressing ideas orally.\n\nNetworking\n\nThe saying “It’s all about who you know” could not be truer, especially in the context of developing a career. The people you know may be able to help you obtain volunteer opportunities, internship positions, and acceptance to graduate school, possibly support your fellowship applications, and assist in your employment search. There are a number of events that can facilitate the networking process such as special lectures, conferences, professional association meetings, and career fairs. Be outgoing, introduce yourself, and interact with the people you meet while attending events, volunteering, interning, working, attending class, and participating in university organizations. Networking is not only a career development tool, but it is also personally fulfilling because it gives you the opportunity to meet amazing people in related fields who share your interests.\n\nLocal Environmental-Related Programs\n\nCenter for Applied Research and Environmental Systems\n\nCity of Columbia Parks and Recreation\n\nCity of Columbia Public Works Department\n\nCity of Columbia Sustainability Office\n\nColumbia Area Earth Day\n\nColumbia Center for Urban Agriculture\n\nColumbia Farmers Market\n\nColumbia Garden Coalition\n\nCommunity Policy Analysis Center\n\nEnvironmental Leadership Office\n\nFood and Agricultural Policy Research Institute\n\nGreat Rivers Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit\n\nMissouri Department of Conservation\n\nMissouri Environmental Education Association\n\nMissouri Master Gardener Extension Program\n\nMissouri River Relief\n\nMizzou Energy Action Coalition\n\nMU Extension Community Revitalization and Sustainability\n\nMU Extension Program Index\n\nMU Sustainability Office\n\nPeace Nook\n\nPeaceworks Center for Sustainable Living\n\nRenew Missouri\n\nRural Policy Research Institute\n\nSierra Club Osage Group\n\nSustain Mizzou\n\nUSGS Columbia Environmental Research Center\n\nVoluntary Action Center\n\nVolunteering, Internships, and Employment\n\nThe best way to learn about an occupation is to gain hands-on experience through volunteering, an internship, or employment. Your experiences will help you determine whether or not you want to pursue a particular career path, will give you the opportunity to create a network by meeting people in a particular field, and will help you gain invaluable employment experience.

There are numerous resources on the internet and in print that can help you determine which careers are best suited to your skills and future goals. Learning from people who are employed in your fields of interest via informational interviews and shadowing can provide invaluable information about a particular career. Of course, there is no substitute for hands-on personal experience which can be gained through volunteer work, internship experience, and employment.\n\nCareers Internet Research\n\nTry some of the suggestions below to begin career research on the Internet:\n\nEnter broad terms such as environmental jobs, environmental careers, and environmental employment into a search engine like Google or Yahoo. Also Search O*NET, The Occupational Outlook Handbook, and GoinGlobal or a similar type of site, because it will give you an in-depth introduction to careers and provide you with information on employment viability (salary and job security).\n\nUse the searches you perform on-line and the lists provided on this website to compile a list of job titles, careers, and/or employers that sound interesting to you; this list will continue to grow as you do more research.\n\nSearch for information on specific job titles and careers. Then ask yourself the following questions:\n\nWhat educational and/or experiential requirements are necessary for employment in the position?\n\nWhat employers hire people for the positions you are interested in or vice versa?\n\nWhat skills are required for the career, and how do these skills match your own set?\n\nHow does the career match with your future goals? Does the career provide opportunities for advancement? What is the starting wage and potential wage for the position? What careers are closely related?\n\nHelpful Websites for Career Planning Research\n\nAbout.com: Career Planning\n\nCareerOneStop\n\nCareers.org\n\nCareer Project.org\n\nCareerSearch.com\n\nCollegeGrad.com\n\nCNN\n\nEco.org\n\nEnvironmentalCareer.com\n\nEnvironmentalCareer.com Career Research\n\nEnvironmentalCareer.com Jobology\n\nEnvironmental Jobs and Careers\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nGoinGlobal\n\nGoogle\n\nMonster\n\nMU Career Center Job Search Series Environmental Careers\n\nMU Career Center Majors and Careers\n\nNational Association of Colleges and Employers\n\nOccupational Outlook Handbook\n\nO*Net\n\nSalary.com\n\nSustainabilityDegrees.com\n\nVault\n\nWebcrawler\n\nWetFeet\n\nYahoo\n\nInformational Interviews\n\nTake advantage of the knowledge and experience of people who work in occupations you are interested in by requesting an informational interview.
