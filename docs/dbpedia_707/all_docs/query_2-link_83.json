        "text": "A job in consulting rewards you with a very transparent and meritocratic career trajectory. Whatever your entry point, you can be assured that, if you perform well and enjoy the role, there’s a promising future ahead.\n\nConsulting firms do most of their hiring at the junior levels, attracting undergraduates, postgraduates, MBA students, and those with a few years of industry experience. This is typically their first step into the world of consulting.\n\nAt these levels, roles are focused on analyzing data and drawing insights to contribute to solving client problems. Junior roles such as analyst, associate consultant, associate, and consultant can be confusing and don’t communicate what’s involved in the work. Although the role titles differ across firms, they are similar in their responsibilities and activities involved and follow very similar paths for progression.\n\nAt the more senior levels, roles are more managerial, so titles such as engagement manager, project leader, principal, partner, and director, are most common. At these senior levels, you will oversee the problem-solving and take a larger role in client management, not focus on crunching the numbers.\n\nSenior consultants are hired with more years of industry experience. They usually have deep expertise in their field, existing leadership skills, experience growing a client base, or prior consulting experience. They can step into their role and have an immediate impact on the firm. In some consulting firms, you can only be promoted internally into these senior roles.\n\n“No two days are the same” really does apply in consulting. Having an understanding of the key responsibilities of each role is helpful if you’re wondering whether consulting is the right career for you or if you want to know what activities you might be doing day-to-day.\n\nIf you’re applying as an undergraduate, a master’s student, or a recent graduate, you’ll join at the analyst or associate consultant level. This is the start of the consulting career ladder.\n\nFirms want to see that you have a strong academic record, relevant skills gained from holding positions of responsibility within on-campus clubs and societies and from work experience, and a desire to continue learning. They also recruit from a variety of backgrounds, with no focus on specific degrees. There are exceptions to this if you are recruiting for a specialized firm, such as a healthcare consulting firm. In our article, The Best Major for Consulting, you can learn more about how different degrees can prepare you for consulting.\n\nAt this stage, you’ll be learning the ropes, so lots of in-depth training will be provided before you’re staffed on a project. From the beginning, you’ll become a key member of the teams you work with.\n\nAs a member of a team of 3 to 6 other consultants, you’ll be given ownership of a component of the project. Analyzing data, testing hypotheses, interviewing stakeholders, and presenting your findings to the rest of the team or the client are the most common activities. All of which contributes to the team’s purpose of taking ambiguous problems from the client and working together to create solutions that the client can act on. You may also be involved in supporting the implementation of these solutions.\n\nYou’ll be working across multiple industries and business functions, gaining broad experiences to develop your ability to apply problem-solving skills in a variety of situations.\n\nAs a Ph.D. candidate, MBA student, or an experienced professional with a few years of experience, you’ll likely fit into the consultant or associate-level role. Junior consultants are also promoted to these roles (either directly or after they return to school for an advanced degree).\n\nFirms still want to see a strong academic record when hiring for these roles. They’re also looking for how else you’ve gained relevant skills, how quickly you’ve progressed in your current or former career, and in which areas you have developed expertise.\n\nAgain, as a new hire, you’ll receive lots of training to ensure you’re set up for success for your first and ongoing projects.\n\nWhen you join at this level, you’ll be taking on more responsibility by managing more complex elements of the projects you’re working on. You might also be conducting expert interviews and running client workshops to generate and test ideas. You will start to lead more junior members of the team as you progress."
