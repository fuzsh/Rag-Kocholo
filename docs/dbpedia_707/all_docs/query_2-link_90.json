        "text": "The Mission Crew Wing is awarded to TACCOs and SENSOs in the flying squadrons who have completed the Mission Crew Conversion Course and reflect a high level of competency.\n\nThe RSN Submariner’s Badge is represented by two dolphins flanking the RSN Crest. Dolphins have a universal appeal, symbolising many of the traits highly desired of a submariner. The dolphins represent skilfulness, intelligence, strength, determination, esprit de corps, aggressiveness and fighting spirit. The waves caused by the dolphins leaping out of the surface are a display of strength and power.\n\nThe lion and tiger, which represent the nation, frame the traditional diver’s hard hat and show that we are the only SAF unit that specialises in diving. The hard hat represents strength, determination, aggressiveness and fighting spirit of the divers. The waves symbolise the underpinning naval tradition and highlight the relentless spirit of the special breed of men with a “nothing-stands-in-our-way” attitude.\n\nThe Naval Warfare Badge signifies the professional expertise of the Naval Warfare Officer in the conduct of maritime warfare. The crest in the centre of the badge represents the Republic of Singapore Navy. The swords are a symbol of the Officer Corp. The sea waves depict the naval character of the badge.\n\nThe RSN Submariner’s Badge is represented by two dolphins flanking the RSN Crest. Dolphins have a universal appeal, symbolising many of the traits highly desired of a submariner. The dolphins represent skilfulness, intelligence, strength, determination, esprit de corps, aggressiveness and fighting spirit. The waves caused by the dolphins leaping out of the surface are a display of strength and power.\n\nEngineers are silent heroes. They work long hours in the machinery control room to ensure the ship operates in peak condition. The compass rose on the engineers’ badges reflects direction and symbolises the technical leadership at the heart of every engineer.\n\nEngineers are silent heroes.

The swords are symbols of the leadership and combat rules that the CIC Supervisor performs. The sea waves depict the naval character of the badge. The silver colour depicts the fighting spirit, valour and resilience of the CIC Supervisor.\n\nThe RSN Submariner’s Badge is represented by two dolphins flanking the RSN Crest.

The dolphins represent skilfulness, intelligence, strength, determination, esprit de corps, aggressiveness and fighting spirit. The waves caused by the dolphins leaping out of the surface are a display of strength and power.\n\nDeep expertise is required in operating and maintaining complex weapons systems on board. This is represented on the badge by the outwards pointing naval guns and missiles.\n\nMealtimes are always welcome on board and the globe, with its three outward pointing arrows, represents the vital logistical support provided to Navy personnel that enables them to sail the world smoothly.\n\nFeaturing a shield with an atom and a raven with an electric bolt, this badge perfectly signifies the art of attacking your enemies without firing a single shot.\n\nAs the vital link between the ship and shore, the CS specialist’s role in maintaining communications is symbolised by the signal flags.\n\nAs the “brains” of the ship, C2 operators are always on the quest for greater knowledge and expertise — symbolised by the compass rose around the radar screen.\n\nThis is awarded upon completion of the Special Forces/Special Forces Detachment Officer Qualification Course at the US Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Centre and School in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\nDecorating some of the world’s best maritime warriors, this coveted badge is earned by undergoing demanding training for sea, air and land operations."
