        "text": "If you're an outgoing, extroverted people-person, it might help to tailor your job search to careers where your personality can be an asset.\n\nYour people skills can be a major factor in helping you land a job. Recent research shows that employers are interested in human skills, including traits associated with extroverts like leadership and communication, even amid the rise of tech skills like AI.\n\nThere isn't necessarily a hard line between introverted and extroverted people, but more so a spectrum of how sociable you might be. You might even be an introvert who excels in social settings or an extrovert who gets shy in social situations. You might have both introverted and extroverted aspects to your personality, but there are a number of jobs where you can excel if you're a people person.\n\nRead on to learn more about jobs for extroverts and start down the path to finding a good fit for your individual personality.\n\nCommon Characteristics of Jobs for Extroverts\n\nJobs for extroverts feature teamwork, communication, and flexibility.\n\nIf you're a people person who loves social interactions, there are a number of jobs that might fit your personality. That could mean working in a customer-facing role as a sales representative or leading teams behind the scenes as a business management professional. It could also mean building students up as an educator or managing people as part of a human resources department.\n\nIt's also important to look for a job that allows you to build relationships with clients and coworkers. A rewarding career for an extrovert might entail being part of a team and brand that they're proud of.\n\nPopular Online Degree Programs\n\nLearn about start dates, transferring credits, availability of financial aid, and more by contacting the universities below.\n\nWhat Are the Best Jobs for Extroverts?\n\nPublic Relations\n\nPublic relations careers will see you working as a liaison between a business or organization and the public. That'll mean writing press releases, running communications campaigns, and even managing a brand's social media presence.\n\nBeing a public relations professional is an ideal job for extroverts who love outreach and being the face of a brand, company, or organization. Public relations specialists had a median salary of $66,750 in May 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nJournalism\n\nJournalism can take many forms, but whether it's writing a traditional news outlet or producing video for a digital media company, extroverts will excel in this fast-paced field. The median annual wage for news analysts, reporters, and journalists was $57,500 in May 2023.\n\nWorking as a journalist will mean talking to a host of different people across your community and tapping into current news. Extroverts will thrive in a collaborative newsroom environment and in managing sources, securing interviews, and interacting with community members.\n\nSales\n\nSales is a broad field, but making a pitch and working directly with clients is an almost universal part of this extrovert-friendly occupation. Promoting a product and working directly with consumers or other businesses is a key aspect of sales regardless of your industry or product, and extroverts can thrive in that fast-paced, high-interaction environment.\n\nThe median annual wage for sales representatives, specifically in wholesale and manufacturing, was $65,630 as of May 2023. For sales representatives in the technical and scientific product field, that figure was $99,710.\n\nBusiness Management\n\nBusiness managers lead teams and work cross-functionally to meet goals — an ideal gig for extroverts who like working with people. You'll need to work your way up to leading a team, but having people skills is a major bonus as you climb the ladder to business management.\n\nBusiness management comes with the dual role of meeting business needs and also keeping up team morale and communicating effectively. Master of business administration (MBA) degrees can help prepare you for this high-demand job by mixing both leadership and fundamental business skills.\n\nManagement occupations as a whole are fast growing and lucrative. The median annual wage for management occupations was $116,880 as of May 2023.\n\nSocial and Community Service\n\nEmployment of social and community service managers is growing, and the public service field is a perfect place for extroverts to interact with and help their community.\n\nWhether you're working for a local recreation center, food bank, government agency or nonprofit, a community-facing service role will help you interact with members of your community while also helping people locally. Social and community service managers had a median annual wage of $77,030 as of May 2023.\n\nEducation\n\nEducators play critical roles in shaping students' futures, so having an extroverted personality can help you excel in both teaching and counseling students.\n\nEducation can take many forms, whether you're working as a primary school or high school teacher, or even teaching at a college or other higher education institution. It can also mean tutoring or working in any number of support roles at schools. High school teachers had a median annual salary of $65,220 as of May 2023.\n\nHuman Resources\n\nHuman resources is, first and foremost, a people-oriented job. That might entail onboarding, training, and managing people at a company. It can also mean dealing with challenging situations, like internal complaints and other issues that crop up in businesses.\n\nHaving an empathetic, people-focused personality will help you excel regardless of your role in human resources. Human resources managers had a median annual wage of $67,650 as of May 2023.\n\nLaw\n\nWorking in law requires people skills well outside of the courtroom. You'll be interacting with clients, court staff, and other lawyers regularly. As a lawyer, for instance, you'll need to be an expert negotiator and be willing to think on the fly — an extroverted personality will help you manage those many requirements on top of speaking publicly in court.\n\nBecoming a lawyer is a long road, but can pay off with a high return on investment. Employment of lawyers is growing, and the BLS estimated their median annual wage at $145,760 as of May 2023.\n\nSocial Work\n\nSocial work requires people skills, empathy, and understanding. People skills are a must for helping people deal with challenging circumstances. Social work careers are all about supporting people and communities, whether you're providing therapy or counseling or working on the policy and research side of the profession.\n\nThe median annual wage for social workers was $58,380 as of May 2023. That critical occupation is projected to grow over the next decade.\n\nConsulting\n\nConsulting will see you working with various organizations and businesses to improve their efficiency. This will mean interviewing people across teams, analyzing data, and presenting your findings to leadership. People skills are a must in consulting, which relies heavily on networking and effective communication.\n\nManagement analysts, who work directly with clients to boost a group's efficiency, are in high demand. They also bring in a lucrative wage, with the BLS projecting a median annual wage of $99,410 as of May 2023.\n\nJobs for Extroverts Job Extrovert Strengths Public Relations Communication, brand awareness, teamwork Journalism Interviewing, communication, flexibility Sales People skills, pitching, fast-paced Business Management Leadership, communication, team building Social and Community Service Empathy, community building Education Teaching, engagement, development Human Resources People skills, communication, mediation Law Negotiation, networking, public speaking Social Work Empathy, counseling, arbitration Consulting Networking, negotiation, public speaking\n\n7 MBTI Extroversion Personality Types\n\nPersonality is a dynamic and highly individual thing.
