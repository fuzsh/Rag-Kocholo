        "text": "The following list describes the distinct types of master’s degrees based on the most common course names used in university listings. As there is no single standardised system, you may find variations between institutions in terms of both naming and course content.\n\nMaster of Arts (MA)\n\nA Master of Arts (MA) is usually awarded in disciplines categorised as arts or social sciences, such as communications, education, languages, linguistics, literature, geography, history and music. Candidates are taught through a combination of lectures and seminars and assessed through an examination and/or a dissertation based on an independent research project.\n\nMaster of Science (MS, MSc)\n\nA Master of Science (MS, MSc) is usually awarded in disciplines categorised as the sciences, such as biology, chemistry, engineering, health and statistics. Certain fields such as economics and the social sciences can fall under both arts and sciences, with the individual institution deciding on what to call their master’s degree programme. In such subjects, it may be the case that the MS has a stronger research component and can be perceived to hold more weight than an MA in some industries.\n\nMaster of Research (MRes)\n\nA Master of Research (MRes) degree is designed to provide training in how to become a researcher. Containing a significantly larger research element than MA or MSc programmes, an MRes may give candidates an advantage if they wish to pursue a PhD or enter a career in research. Note that some institutions may refer to MRes-style degree programmes as an MSc, so it’s worth checking the course content carefully before applying.\n\nMaster by Research (MPhil)\n\nA Master by Research (MPhil) is an advanced research-based degree which allows the candidate to focus on a particular topic in-depth and independently, to complete a single large research project. An MPhil is often seen as a precursor to a PhD and is often used by institutions to allow students to ‘test the water’ before commencing a PhD degree programme. This often takes longer to complete than other types of master’s degrees – though the length of time and the status awarded to an MPhil varies significantly depending on the country and institution.\n\nMaster of Studies (MSt)\n\nTaught in only a few places (including the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge), a Master of Studies (MSt) degree is comparable to the MA or MSc, requiring both classroom learning and the completion of a thesis and an examination. An MSt can serve as a provisional enrolment for a PhD in some cases. The need for this category of master’s degree partly stems from the fact that at Oxbridge universities students who have completed a Bachelor of Arts are automatically awarded an MA after a defined time-period has passed. In contrast, those with a MSt have completed postgraduate coursework to gain the title.\n\nThere are also more specialised types of master’s degrees, often focusing on a specific professional area. These are sometimes known as ‘tagged master’s degrees’, because they are ‘tagged’ to a certain field, or professional master’s degrees, because they focus on career development in a particular profession. Some professional master’s degrees start with the word Professional in the title, such as the Professional Science Master’s Degree (PSM), a hands-on degree with a heavy practical component giving students the skills and knowledge needed to work professionally in their chosen field.\n\nAs ever, classifications and course details will differ depending on the country and institution. Here are some of the most common examples of specialised and professional master’s degrees:\n\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\n\nThe Master of Business Administration (MBA) is designed to give students the skills and knowledge required for career progression in business and management roles. Candidates are given broad training in all aspects of business, allowing them to apply their learning to a variety of careers. Many MBA candidates are mid-career professionals, with most programmes requiring at least three years’ professional experience. You can also choose to combine an MBA with a specialisation such as accounting or finance, and tailor the degree to a specific field of interest. Related master’s degrees include the Master of Professional Accountancy (MPAcc) and Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS).\n\nMaster of Library Science (MLS, MLIS, MSLS)\n\nThe Master of Library Science is designed to give students both academic and professional knowledge for entry into the workplace – in this case, libraries. Taught at an accredited library school, an MLS includes theoretical components along with a practicum (supervised practical teaching) or internship, ending with a research project or thesis. The MLS is often a requirement for professional librarian positions in the US and Canada.\n\nMaster of Public Administration (MPA)\n\nThe Master of Public Administration is a public policy degree similar to an MBA but focusing on the public sector rather than the private sector. Students can specialise in areas such as the environment, international administration and science and technology with an aim to work for the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), not-for-profit organisations and in consulting. The MPA combines academic and professional elements, with a focus on policy analysis and management. Other public policy master’s degrees include Master of Public Policy (MPP), Master of Public Affairs (MPA) Master of Urban Planning (MUP) and Master of International Affairs (MIA).\n\nMaster of Public Health (MPH)\n\nThe Master of Public Health has academic and professional elements, taking an interdisciplinary approach to areas related to public health. Students are taught how to monitor, diagnose and regulate the health concerns of communities through public policies. Many MPH degree programmes are specialised in areas such as epidemiology, global health, occupational health, and nutritional sciences. While some countries accept students with accredited bachelor’s degrees for the MPH, others only accept medical graduates.\n\nMaster of Social Work (MSW)\n\nThe Master of Social Work degree prepares students for careers within the field of social work, focusing on improving the quality of life for individuals, groups and communities. The MSW is offered either as a clinical degree allowing students to work directly with clients, or as a macro-practice degree preparing students for work in political advocacy and community organising.\n\nMaster of Laws (LLM)\n\nThe Master of Laws degree is usually taken after having graduated from a professional law degree and gives candidates the chance to combine their knowledge of the basic skills needed to become a lawyer with specialist knowledge gained through research in a particular area of law.\n\nMaster of Arts in Liberal Studies (MA, MALS, MLA/ALM, MLS)\n\nThe Master of Arts in Liberal Studies is an interdisciplinary programme designed to provide rigorous teaching in the liberal arts. Candidates graduate with both depth and breadth of postgraduate knowledge, with MALS programmes drawing from courses and instructors from across the university’s postgraduate curriculum. Typically, liberal arts students choose the course for an opportunity to intellectually challenge themselves, explore ideas and pursue knowledge, rather than to pursue a specific career path.\n\nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA)\n\nThe Master of Fine Arts is a creative degree granted in disciplines such as the visual, performing and studio arts. This may include creative writing, graphic design, photography, filmmaking, theatre and painting. Assessment and study are both practical, culminating in a major work or performance.\n\nMaster of Music (MM/MMus)\n\nAwarded by universities and music conservatories, the Master of Music degree combines advanced studies in a specialist applied area chosen by the student (such as music performance, composition or conducting) with advanced studies in musical theory. MM degrees could be preparation for teaching music or to become a professional in a chosen field.\n\nMaster of Education (MEd, MSEd, MIT, MAEd, MAT)\n\nThe Master of Education degree prepares students for careers in education. Some Master of Education degrees prepare student teachers to become certified, while others are more suited for experienced, already certified teachers to specialise in areas such as curriculum, instruction, special education, counselling and administration. The MIT and MAT degrees include coursework and a student teaching internship and lead to the teacher certification qualification needed to teach in public schools.\n\nMaster of Engineering (MEng)\n\nThe Master of Engineering degree can be either academic (with a focus on engineering theories and practice) or professional (with a focus on preparing students for work in the engineering field). While some MEng programmes require students to become published in an industry journal, others involve training periods in industry or laboratories, or a combination of the two in order to graduate.\n\nMaster of Architecture (M.Arch)\n\nThe Master of Architecture is a master’s degree in architecture that assesses students through practical internships, final examinations and/or a thesis or final project in order to receive a license. As M.Arch degrees vary in kind, you may find different names for different types of programmes. Students are required to produce coursework in subjects such as design, building science, structural engineering, architectural history and theory and professional practice.\n\nFinally, master’s degrees also vary in terms of the entry requirements applicants need to meet. To meet the requirements of a master’s degrees it’s usually necessary to have graduated with a bachelor’s degree (though not always), and some programmes require a certain amount of professional experience. See below for the most common requirements for different types of master’s degrees.\n\nPostgraduate master’s degrees (MA, MSc, MLA, MSW, etc)\n\nThese master’s degrees are usually open to anyone who holds a bachelor’s degree.\n\nBusiness or management master’s degrees (MBA, MSc, MIM, MSM, MA, MEM)\n\nFor these types of programme, master’s degree requirements usually include a certain amount of professional experience, especially in the case of an MBA (Master of Business Administration). An MSc in Management (MSc, MIM, MSM) typically requires a bachelor’s degree in social sciences, while an MA in Management is more likely to accept candidates from all backgrounds. The Master’s in Engineering Management (MEM) is specially designed for engineering students.\n\nExecutive master’s degrees (EMBA, EMS)\n\nDesigned specifically for mid-career executive professionals, executive master’s degrees require candidates to have gained significant professional experience – even more than in the case of an MBA. The most common are Executive Master’s in Business Management (EMBA) or Executive MSc programmes.\n\nPostgraduate research master’s degrees (Master by Research)\n\nMaster by Research programmes are designed for those who hold a bachelor’s degree with a significant research component and/or have several published research papers.\n\nIntegrated master’s degrees (MEng, MMath, MSci, etc)\n\nThese are master’s degrees that follow on directly from an undergraduate degree programme, most commonly available in scientific and technology subjects. It’s possible to apply for an integrated master’s degree programme directly after completion of secondary-level education. Integrated master’s degree programmes usually last a year longer than it would take to earn an undergraduate degree, and students may have the option to skip the final year and just graduate at bachelor’s level instead.\n\nThere is also the option (particularly in countries such as the US) to earn a master’s degree alongside your undergraduate studies. This is called ‘en route’, ‘in passing’ or ‘in course’ and is awarded following the successful completion of coursework and certain examinations.\n\nDo you need a bachelors degree to get a master's?\n\nGenerally, yes you will need a bachelor's degree to be accepted onto a master's degree course. However, sometimes, for certain subjects, significant industry experience may suffice. It is important to research the course that you are interested in and the university or postgraduate school that you are considering in order to learn more. Information about entry requirements can usually be found on an institution's website.\n\nIs a master's degree hard?\n\nA master's degree is designed to challenge you and build upon skills that have already been established. While it is unlikely that you will be doing anything completely new while studying a master's degree, particularly if you have a bachelor's degree in the same subject, a master's course will likely be a lot more independent with the faculty providing less direct information and more of a guide to allow you to do your own research.\n\nWhat is the difference between a master's and a PhD?\n\nA PhD is usually the next step after a master's degree for students who wish to pursue a career in academic research. A PhD generally takes a lot longer to complete than a master's degree. In the UK, a master's degree will usually take a year to complete whereas a PhD usually takes around four years. Also, there are some taught modules within a master's degree whereas a PhD will involve the student designing a thesis and researching it independently with the guidance of a faculty member.\n\nCan I get a master's degree if my bachelor's degree is in a different field?\n\nThis is possible. Generally, the subject of your bachelor's degree should be similar to the subject of the master's degree that you are applying to. For example, a person with a bachelor's degree in biology could go on to study medicine or veterinary science for their master's degree. A student studying maths, physics or computer science may go on to study engineering. A student studying a humanities subject may go on to study law or teaching.\n\nSome master's degrees may require that students who did not study the topic at an undergraduate level complete a conversion course.\n\nShould I work first before getting my master's?\n\nThis varies depending on the student, the course and the career path. Some master's degree programmes will require some work experience. Some career paths require a master's degree before a student can attain a job within the field. Some students will choose to take time out of education after their undergraduate degree and work for a while before pursuing a master's while other's do their bachelor's and master's qualifications one after the other. The answer to this question will vary but many times it is a personal choice."
