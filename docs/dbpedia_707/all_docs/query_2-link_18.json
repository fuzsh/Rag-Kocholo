        "text": "A career in the Armed Forces is a great way to serve the United States of America in one of its five active duty military branches – Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, or Coast Guard. Depending on the job selected, working can be akin to most civilian jobs – Monday through Friday, 9 to 5. However, other positions are more volatile, unpredictable, and adventuresome.\n\nThe following guide will help interested individuals explore potential career paths by providing a high-level overview of the Armed Forces, including a look at different roles, related skills, earning potential, and employment outlook.\n\nCareer Paths in the Armed Forces\n\nServing in the Armed Forces has always been a popular career option. The reasons for joining are as varied as the individuals themselves. Many serve to be part of something larger than themselves and to do what they feel is their patriotic duty. Others do it for the higher education financial aid benefits, such as the Student Loan Repayment program, Post 9/11 GI Bill®, Tuition Assistance and Tuition Top-Up. Still others want to be on the cutting edge of technology or pursue something that is challenging and life-changing.\n\n* GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government website at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill.\n\nCareer paths can include serving at various grade levels: Commissioned Officer, Warrant Officer or Enlisted. Within each level are several fields and numerous jobs within those fields. Below is a sampling of some of the jobs available:\n\nArmed Forces Salaries\n\nPay in the military differs from the civilian sector in that the earnings depend on rank, years of service, and location. For example, an E-5 with over three years of service earns $2,464.50 per month in Base Pay, but the same E-5 with over six years in the Armed Forces earns $2,761.80.\n\nBy comparison, an O-3 officer with those same years of service would earn $4,787.10 and $5,469.60, respectively. Warrant Officers Basic Pay falls in between the enlisted and officer.\n\nIn addition, certain military members also get a Basic Housing Allowance (BAH), which is determined in part by location and rank. The table below shows a sample comparison between an E-5 and O-3 BAH at three Army posts in the U.S., along with a total for both Base Pay and BAH (with and without dependents):\n\nFt. Drum, NY\n\nFt Riley, KS\n\nFt. Irwin, CA\n\nSource: Defense Travel Management Office\n\nBesides Base Pay and BAH, military members also get certain allowances, such as clothing or separation (if stationed away from their family). They may also get an incentive pay depending on their job, location, and other criteria, such as stationed-at-sea, serving in a combat zone, flight pay, submarine pay, etc.\n\nComponents of a Successful Career in the Armed Forces: Skills, Tools, and Technology\n\nSkills\n\nBecause the jobs in the military vary so greatly (there are over a 150 career paths in the Army alone), it is hard to nail down the skills needed. However, there are certain personal skills that are valuable regardless of the branch, path, or job. Such skills include:\n\nStamina and physical fitness\n\nThe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown military members must be in top physical and mental shape to endure the rigors of deployment. Service members who were overweight and less in shape suffered higher rates of injuries. Because Armed Forces service is stressful â both physically and mentally â members at the top of their game stay in longer.\n\nTeam Player\n\nThe military relies the team concept to get its work down. By working together, a team gets more done than if each member worked alone. That is why one of the first things learned in Basic Training is teamwork.\n\nPatriotism\n\nWhether an enlisted or officer, defending the Constitution without question is paramount to success as a military careerist. As a result, an Oath of Allegiance is required.\n\nAdaptability\n\nThings can change fast in the military and you have to be able to âroll with the punchesâ. Today you may be in one place and tomorrow on a plane to somewhere else. Being able to quickly adapt to changes â and challenges â on the fly is critical to both mission and personal success.\n\nEmpathy\n\nThe military operates in all types of environments â some of which are hostile and unhealthy â usually in developing areas of the world. It is necessary to be able to relate to the local socio-economic background, race, culture and religions. For many, it is a way to survive.\n\nIn addition to the above skills, credentialing is a license or certification that shows the individual has the training and experience to perform a certain job in the civilian sector. Currently, there are over 105 jobs that can be credentialed in the Army alone. Credentialing is commonly found in the healthcare field, such as an x-ray technician, dental assistant, or Physician's Assistant (PA). But it can also validate one's expertise in operating commercial vehicles, thus making it easier to get a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) when transferring to the civilian sector. Working in a nuclear plant control room or having a computer-specific certification from a vendor, such as Cicso or Microsoft, are two other types of credentials that are valuable in the civilian world but can be obtained through military service depending on the job.\n\nSome credentials are nationally recognized while others may only be specific to a State or Territory. Credentialing certain military skills not only saves time and money, but can also be a benefit when trying to get a civilian job after leaving a military career.\n\nFrom vehicles, weapons, computers, planes, and everything in between, the Armed Forces are first in many cases to develop, test, and refine equipment and technology that is cutting edge, state-of-the-art, and not found anywhere else in the world.\n\nThe military has many opportunities not found in the civilian sector. For instance, how many businesses use tanks in their line of work? And, depending on the specific Armed Forces role, civilian careers utilize many tools and technologies that first started out as new technology in the military.\n\nTake Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for example. The military has been using the Predator and Shadow drones for years. Drones overhead in Iraq and Afghanistan were (and still are) flown from here in the United States.\n\nFrom that technology, we now have small drones that are being used for everything, from photographers taking low altitude photos of a house for a realtor, to Amazon using drones and GPS to deliver packages.\n\nJob Growth, Prospects, and Outlook in the Armed Forces\n\nWith the war in Iraq ended and the drawdown continuing in Afghanistan, the Armed Forces are becoming smaller by design and out of budget necessity. As shown below, the total number of active duty military personnel has been steadily declining:\n\nYear Number of Active Duty Military Personnel 2011 1,520,100 2012 1,492,200 2013 1,433,150\n\nThe need for new service members won't be as great in the near term (2015 out to 2020) as it has been in the last decade. But with ISIS still strong, and other threats still developing, there still will be a need to meet strength goals and to make up for attrition due to service members getting out or retiring.\n\nAccording to the latest data available, below is a look at how the Armed Services looks now and what it is projected to look like in the next five years:\n\nU.S. Armed Forces Strength by Branch\n\nMilitary Branch Current (2015) Projected (2020) Notes Army 490,000 450,000 Special Forces is planned to grow by 3,000 to 69,700 Air Force 315,000 315,000 Smallest it has been since it was created in 1947 Navy 325,000 328,000 The only branch slated as a whole to grow Marines 190,000 182,000 Could go down to 175,000, if sequestered\n\n* Note: Numbers do not include 335,000 National Guard or 195,000 Reserve members.\n\nAs shown above, the branch with the most overall opportunity for growth is the Navy. The other branches are projected to shrink as a whole. Within the Army, the Special Forces is projected to grow as they have shown they are best suited for the type of combat actions encountered now and currently projected for the near-term.\n\nWhat Do Related Occupations Make?\n\nWhile some of the jobs in the Armed Forces are unique and not found in the civilian sector, many do crossover. As the chart below illustrates, the annual salary of three sample military jobs - Pilot, Mechanical Engineer and Electrician - fall around the median salary point when compared to their related civilian equivalents. Nurse and Truck Driver are closer to the Top 10 percent.\n\n'\\\"Subject\\\";\\\"10th Percentile\\\";\\\"Median Salary\\\";\\\"90th Percentile\\\"\\n\\\"Pilot\\\";72000;90495;120000\\n\\\"Mechanical Engineer\\\";76000;90767;130000\\n\\\"Nurse\\\";28000;32400;60000\\n\\\"Electrician\\\";48000;52000;72000\\n\\\"Truck Driver\\\";23200;33110;67000'\n\nThe above figures for the first three positions uses an officer O-3 with over 6 years as a standard for Base Pay and an average BAH. For the last two, an enlisted E-6 with over 6 years is used as the standard.\n\nRelated Occupations: What You Need to Know\n\nServing a career in the Armed Forces can be a great way to learn a skill or trade that can then be used to get a job after retiring from military service. With the education benefits available to all service members – Tuition Assistance and Tuition Top-Up – it can be easy to get a postsecondary education all the way up to a four-year college degree while serving. One could also go back to school after military retirement and use the GI Bill for an advanced degree.\n\nHere is a sampling of jobs in the Armed Forces that directly convert to the civilian sector, along with information on median salary, growth potential, and the education or training required by most companies to compete for these positions.\n\nRelated Careers at a Glance\n\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nBecome Team\n\nContributing Writer"
