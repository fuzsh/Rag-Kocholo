        "text": "Jobs in the financial sector can be highly lucrative, which helps explain why they’re in such great demand. Of course, breaking into the world of finance isn’t easy—the entry qualifications can be as lofty as the salaries. At a minimum, most jobs require a four-year degree, and many professionals have advanced degrees in business, math, economics, or statistics.\n\nStill, the finance industry has various opportunities, both on and off Wall Street, that cater to different skill sets and interests. This includes jobs in investment banking, portfolio management, and financial planning to name a few. Below, we list some of the most well-known and highest-paid careers in this industry:\n\nInvestment Banker\n\nAverage Base Salary: $116,184 (total pay is $61,000 to $249,000)\n\nProjected Growth Rate: 7%\n\nEducation Requirements: Four-year degree in finance, economics, or a quantitative or business-focused field, plus an MBA or a master’s in finance (ideally from a top school)\n\nSome of the most glamorous (and intense) financial careers are in investment banking. Investment banks help companies and governments raise money through bonds, stocks, public offerings, venture capitalism, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A).\n\nInvestment banking firms typically have numerous divisions and groups with different objectives and responsibilities. Working in a traditional investment bank allows you to interact with issuers of securities and M&A professionals. You might even work on the trading desk, trading stocks, bonds, and other securities in the secondary market.\n\nWhile the profession has grown more democratic, it still has an elitist tinge: MBAs from top-level programs are often all but mandatory. Still, it’s less common today for investment bankers to seek out professional certifications like the Series 7 or CFA compared with some other finance jobs.\n\nTypes of Investment Banking Jobs\n\nMergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Bankers focusing on M&A provide strategic advice to companies looking to merge with competitors or buy smaller companies. M&A bankers use financial modeling to evaluate these potential large-scale deals. These jobs typically require interactions with high-profile executives, and M&A specialists must convince these executives of their ideas.\n\nUnderwriting: Raising capital is part of a bank’s underwriting department. Underwriting specialists typically focus on debt or equity and often have an industry-based focus as well. These bankers commonly serve in client-facing roles, working with outside contacts to determine capital needs while at the same time working in-house with traders and security salespeople to find the best options. Underwriting is not limited to investment banks and has spread to larger universal banks to a great degree in recent years.\n\nPrivate Equity: Many investment banks have private equity arms, though jobs are typically found at smaller, specialist firms. Bankers in this area raise money for nonpublic enterprises and companies, keeping a portion of any profits that they generate through deals. It’s common for PE professionals to have prior experience at investment banks, as well as outstanding academic credentials.\n\nVenture Capital: Venture capital (VC) firms frequently provide cash to emerging companies, often in rapidly developing industries, such as tech, biotech, and green technology. While many target companies eventually fail, VC companies prosper by getting their financial stake in and out at the early stages of development, producing massive returns on investments. Employees of VC firms are typically adept at number crunching and dealmaking, and they are clued into new technologies and ideas. They thrill at the prospect of discovering the next new thing.\n\nActuary\n\nAverage Base Salary: $103,402 (total pay is $60,000 to $158,000)\n\nProjected Growth Rate: 23%\n\nEducation Requirements: Four-year degree in actuarial sciences, math, statistics, or a business-related field such as finance, economics, or business, plus coursework and a series of professional exams from the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) or the Society of Actuaries (SOA)\n\nActuaries analyze the monetary consequences of risk by using math, statistics, and financial theory. These professionals gather, assemble, and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely costs of such events as injury, sickness, disability, death, and property loss. As the CAS and the SOA state on their Be an Actuary website, “Actuaries are experts in evaluating the likelihood of future events—using numbers, not crystal balls.”\n\nActuaries work for entities that need to manage risk, including insurance companies (the most common employer), pension plans, banks, investment firms, accounting firms, consulting firms, governments, and hospitals. Their input and expertise are vital in helping these entities manage their assets to minimize risk and maximize returns.\n\nTo work as an actuary, you need a strong background in math and a four-year degree in actuarial sciences, math, statistics, finance, or economics. To achieve full professional status, you must become an associate or fellow of the CAS or the SOA. The certification process can take up to seven years at the associate level, with an additional two to three years to earn fellowship status.\n\nPortfolio Manager\n\nAverage Base Salary: $99,118 (total pay is $62,000 to $156,000)\n\nProjected Growth Rate: 16%\n\nEducation Requirements: Four-year degree in business, economics, or finance, plus applicable Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) license(s)\n\nPortfolio management is one of the most prestigious roles in the finance industry. Portfolio managers or money managers oversee institutional and retail client investments. They recommend personalized investment strategies and specific investment decisions to clients, and they usually have discretionary power in executing those strategies to fulfill the client’s goals.\n\nIt’s common for portfolio managers to specialize in specific asset classes, such as equities or fixed income. Or, a manager may be a specialist in certain types of stocks, blockchain-related startups, or high-yield bonds.\n\nFocused funds that employ these specialized managers may seek individuals with a background in analytical research. Others include broader mandates, such as a multi-asset class strategy, and these firms often look for managers with a similarly broad base of investment knowledge and background.\n\nThere are a variety of employers in the sector, each focusing on a specific segment:\n\nInvestment companies and financial service firms offer funds for retail investors.\n\nInvestment banks provide strategic advice to corporations, large institutions, and even governments.\n\nCommercial banks offer a range of investments to their customers.\n\nMoney management firms, portfolio management companies, and hedge funds cater to high-net-worth individuals.\n\nAfter earning a four-year college degree, as well as a graduate degree, many potential money managers also attain the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation. Often, a portfolio manager position is a “destination” role that does not lead anywhere else. Thus, rather than continue to climb a career ladder, portfolio managers typically manage increasing amounts of money. Or, they may leave to start their own firm or hedge fund.\n\nQuantitative Analyst\n\nAverage Base Salary:$96,198 (total pay is $69,000 to $147,000)\n\nProjected Growth Rate: 8%\n\nEducation Requirements: Master’s or doctorate in a quantitative field such as math, statistics, finance, or economics with a strong computer skill set; or an advanced degree in financial engineering or computational finance\n\nWhile some economic analytic positions require public speaking or writing, quantitative analysts (also referred to as quants) typically work behind the scenes. Professionals in this branch of analysis create mathematical models to help companies make business and financial decisions. Asset managers, banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, and private equity firms all employ quants to help them manage risk and identify investment opportunities.\n\nQuants are in especially high demand in the trading world, where they create algorithms to find the most profitable trading opportunities. Most quant workers have backgrounds in mathematics or statistics, often with a Ph.D.\n\nSecurities Trader\n\nAverage Base Salary: $71,989 (total pay is $49,000 to $133,000)\n\nProjected Growth Rate: 7%\n\nEducation Requirements: Four-year degree plus applicable FINRA license(s)\n\nSecurities traders work at commercial banks, investment banks, asset management firms, hedge funds, and more. Wherever they work, traders buy and sell securities on behalf of the assets managed by that firm. Traders work in different markets, such as stocks, commodities, or cryptocurrencies, and may specialize in one type of asset class or investment.\n\nIt used to be possible to work your way up as a trader even without a college degree. While the career path still tends to be somewhat less defined than for, say, investment banking, most traders have a background in a finance-related field from a strong university, and many have advanced degrees in statistics, mathematics, or related fields. It’s also common for traders to take the Series 7 and Series 63 exams early in their careers.\n\nTraders who perform well typically will be allocated increasing amounts of capital. It’s not uncommon for top traders to break out on their own to form hedge funds.\n\nTypes of Trading Jobs\n\nSell-Side Traders: Sell-side traders typically work for banks. They buy and sell products for the benefit of the bank’s clients or the bank itself.\n\nBuy-Side Traders: Buy-side companies, such as asset management firms, also employ traders. They typically conduct buying and selling under the direction of a portfolio manager.\n\nHedge Fund Traders: Hedge fund traders are working not to satisfy client orders but to maximize profits for the fund itself. Like buy-side trading jobs, traders at hedge funds may take orders from a portfolio manager, or they may be able to decide on their buys and sells.\n\nFinancial Planner\n\nAverage Base Salary: $69,502 (total pay is $47,000 to $109,000)\n\nProjected Growth Rate: 13%\n\nEducation Requirements: Bachelor’s degree plus certifications and applicable FINRA license(s)\n\nFinancial planners help individuals develop plans to ensure their present and future financial stability. Typically, they review a client’s financial goals and generate an appropriate strategy for saving and investing. The plan may focus on wealth preservation or investment growth and may include estate and tax planning.\n\nMost financial planners work in either large, nationwide groups or smaller, locally based firms. Some planners charge a set fee, and others charge a percentage of the client’s assets under management (AUM). Commission-based planners receive commissions on the products that they sell and may charge no fees to clients. Some planners are compensated in more than one way.\n\nFinancial planners with the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation are generally in demand the most because of their rigorous training. To be certified, planners must hold at least an undergraduate degree from an accredited university, complete coursework, pass exams, and have relevant experience in the financial field—6,000 hours of financial planning experience or 4,000 hours of apprenticeship experience.\n\nFinancial Analyst\n\nAverage Base Salary: $67,329 (total pay is $52,000 to $89,000)\n\nProjected Growth Rate: 8%\n\nEducation Requirements: Four-year degree in finance or a related field; MBA, CFA certification, and applicable FINRA license are helpful\n\nAnalysts at financial industry firms are typically responsible for researching potential investments and offering opinions and recommendations to help guide traders and portfolio managers. Financial analysts also work at nonbank corporations, where they analyze the company's financial position and help formulate budgetary plans.\n\nTo be a financial analyst, you must have strong analytical, math, and communication skills—and be able to endure high stress. You must have a four-year degree in finance or a related field, and you’ll eventually need a CFA certification or other FINRA license and, likely, an MBA.\n\nTypes of Financial Analyst Jobs\n\nInvestment Analyst: Investment analysts typically specialize in one or more areas, including geographic locations, industrial or economic sectors, or types of investment vehicles. Analysts who work for sell-side companies usually put out buy-and-sell recommendations for clients. Analysts working for a buy-side company typically recommend securities to buy or sell for their portfolio managers.\n\nFinancial Analyst: Financial analysts tend to work at more traditional (non-finance) corporations or government agencies. Nearly every large company, regardless of sector or industry, keeps financial analysts on staff to analyze cash flows and expenditures, maintain budgets, and more. These analysts also may help determine the best capital structure for the corporation or assist with capital raising. Financial analysts have the potential to rise through the ranks at their corporation, eventually becoming treasurer or chief financial officer.\n\nEconomic Analyst\n\nAverage Base Salary: $73,399 (total pay is $52,000 to $107,000)\n\nProjected growth rate: 6%\n\nEducation Requirements: Degree (advance preferred) in economics, statistics, or a related field, plus experience writing and publishing reports.\n\nEconomic analysts observe broad areas of the economy and the markets to look for major trends. These jobs appeal to individuals who enjoy analyzing data, tracking trends, and making opinions based on those trends regarding the future of financial markets. Analytic jobs frequently involve writing, public speaking, and ample work with Excel or other spreadsheet applications.\n\nThese jobs exist at investment banks, money management firms, and other traditional finance-world institutions. They also can be found in the public sector, in government, and in academia. Most financial analysts hold an MBA degree, and many have a Ph.D. Because of the writing component in many related jobs, experience with writing and publishing in the field is desirable.\n\nTo work as an economic analyst, you will need a four-year or advanced degree in economics, statistics, or a related field. While there is a high initial barrier to entry, once in, analysts enjoy a degree of flexibility that many other finance jobs do not.\n\nAnalysts can work for a wide range of employers. An established economist may move from a job at an investment bank to one at a university to one with the government—while performing essentially the same type of work in each place.\n\nTypes of Economic Analyst Jobs\n\nEconomist: Economists are ubiquitous at a variety of finance-related institutions. Investment banks, asset management companies, and central banks employ economists, as do government agencies and academic institutions. An economist tracks and analyzes data to explain current market or economic circumstances and predict trends going forward.\n\nEconomic Strategist: There is a fine line between a strategist and an economist. Economists tend to focus on the broad economy, while strategists home in on the financial markets. Strategist jobs are more likely to be found at banks and money management companies than at academic and government institutions. Many strategists begin their careers as research analysts, focusing on a particular product or industry.\n\nChoosing a Financial Career\n\nTo effectively pursue jobs with the best chances of success, consider the demand for the position. Do the research first to discover your options. Time spent uncovering the most interesting possibilities can be time saved working in a job that just doesn’t fit.\n\nFinancial jobs require distinct skills and present vastly different work environments, so it’s wise to select one that aligns with your long-term interests and abilities. Someone with solid interpersonal skills, for example, might do well as a financial planner, while someone who enjoys crunching numbers might do better as an actuary.\n\nFinding Finance Job Opportunities\n\nFinancial jobs exist at almost every company in almost every industry. There are two ways to find openings—online and offline—and it’s a good idea to use both methods. Keep in mind that financial jobs are highly specialized, so generic job boards are not the best places to seek such positions.\n\nWhen looking offline, specialized executive recruiters or headhunters can be excellent resources for financial job opportunities and career advice. Your university’s alumni association can also be very helpful by putting you in touch with industry insiders and B-school alumnae who are willing to provide insight—and sometimes job leads.\n\nIndustry conferences and other networking events are also great places to look for financial jobs. Concerning networking, never forget the value of personal interaction. Everyone you meet could know someone who knows of a job opening. Keep your avenues of communication open by following up in a professional, personalized way—with every contact.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Finance Jobs\n\nAdvantages\n\nThe most obvious plus is the pay: Finance jobs tend to pay better than other professions. Other notable advantages include decent working conditions, a certain degree of flexibility, and the possibility to potentially use your skills elsewhere. Being good with numbers and finance is generally highly desired in every industry, so if you fancy a career change, it shouldn’t be too hard to find new opportunities.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nLike every field, there are also drawbacks to a career in finance. They can include high stress, big responsibility, long working hours, continuing education requirements, and, in some cases, a lack of job security—the finance industry is generally quite cyclical.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
