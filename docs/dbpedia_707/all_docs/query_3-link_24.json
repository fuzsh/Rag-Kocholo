        "text": "social status, the relative rank that an individual holds, with attendant rights, duties, and lifestyle, in a social hierarchy based upon honour or prestige. Status may be ascribed—that is, assigned to individuals at birth without reference to any innate abilities—or achieved, requiring special qualities and gained through competition and individual effort. Ascribed status is typically based on sex, age, race, family relationships, or birth, while achieved status may be based on education, occupation, marital status, accomplishments, or other factors.\n\nThe word status implies social stratification on a vertical scale. People may be said to occupy high positions when they are able to control, by order or by influence, other people’s conduct; when they derive prestige from holding important offices; or when their conduct is esteemed by others. Relative status is a major factor in determining the way people behave toward each other (see role).\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nHinduism: Ritual and social status\n\nOne’s status tends to vary with social context. For example, the position of a man in his kin group helps determine his position in the larger community. The Native American Hopi lineage, although unnamed, contains the mechanism for transmitting rights to land, houses, and ceremonial knowledge and is thus vital to personal status. Among the Tallensi of Ghana, a boy who has lost his father is head of a household and therefore counts as an elder; a middle-aged man living under his father’s roof is formally a child. Status may be governed by occupational considerations; thus, in parts of sub-Saharan Africa blacksmiths commonly form a separate group of low status. In the Hindu caste system, sweepers are at the bottom of the scale because they handle excrement.\n\nIn most Western urban-industrial societies, such attributes as a respected occupation, the possession and consumption of material goods, physical appearance and dress, and etiquette and manners have become more important than lineage in determining one’s social status. Occupations in these societies tend to be graded along a continuum rather than in a rigid hierarchy.\n\nStatus is closely correlated with etiquette and morality and in many societies rises with the liberal use of wealth (see gift exchange; potlatch). Manipulation of the wealth-status system in such cases often demands great individual effort, aggression, and chicanery."
