        "text": "The U.S. Department of State is announcing an additional innovation to the Foreign Service selection process to further advance the Secretary’s goals to modernize American diplomacy and win the competition for talent.\n\nTo improve the candidate experience and make application to the Foreign Service (FS) more accessible by reducing the financial and logistical barriers associated with travel for in-person assessments held in Washington, D.C., the Board of Examiners (BEX) will transition all Foreign Service assessments to virtual platforms. In Spring 2020, in response to the pandemic, BEX began hosting Foreign Service Specialist Assessments (FSSA) on a virtual platform, a change made permanent in February 2022. Now, candidates interested in 17 FS Specialist job categories (all non-DS Specialist job categories) can test from anywhere in the United States and from most parts of the world. In Fiscal Year 2023, BEX virtually assessed 800 candidates across 14 specialties. Survey respondents have consistently lauded this move.\n\nBEX will now transition the Foreign Service Officer Assessment (FSOA) to a virtual platform as well. Beginning with candidates who took the February 2024 Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT), the Department will move to a fully virtual FSOA. The first of the three components, the Case Management Exercise (CME), will be offered separately and in advance of the remaining two components, the Group Exercise (GE) and Structured Interview (SI). Invited candidates may take the CME from home, a private location of their choice, or at one of 850 on-site locations offered through PearsonVUE around the world.\n\nThe move to virtual platforms for the three components of the FSOA – the Case Management Exercise (CME), Group Exercise (GE), and Structured Interview (SI) – will begin with candidates who took the February 2024 FSOT. Other candidates currently in the FSOA pipeline will continue with their already scheduled in-person assessments. It is important to note that the structure of the assessment is not changing. All candidates will continue to participate in all three segments of the FSOA (CME, GE, SI) with no additional performative requirements. By offering the assessment virtually, we will reduce travel and other costs which have discouraged qualified candidates from participating in the assessment in the past while improving the experience for candidates. These were concerns consistently identified in surveys of previous candidates.\n\nThe first of the three components, the Case Management Exercise (CME), will be offered separately and in advance of the remaining two components, the Group Exercise (GE) and Structured Interview (SI). Invited candidates may take the CME from home, a private location of their choice, or at one of 850 on-site locations offered through PearsonVUE around the world. The CME has been separated from the other two components to maximize scheduling flexibility and to increase the number of assessors who will evaluate each candidate, thereby improving the process.\n\nYes, candidates for all Foreign Service Specialist positions take the specialist assessment, and most are conducted virtually. All Foreign Service Specialist assessments share common elements and are judged according to the same dimensions, but there are some differences in the exam according to the specialty. Please review the Steps to Becoming a Foreign Service Specialist for more information on the Specialist Assessment. . Please review the Steps to Becoming a Foreign Service Specialist for more information on the Specialist Assessment.\n\nTo prepare for the FSOT, the Department of State recommends you have a broad academic foundation, intellectual curiosity, and good writing skills.\n\nThe Department offers a number of helpful resources including a Foreign Service Officer Test practice exam found on our Careers.state.gov site\n\nas well as a Suggested Reading List on our Careers.state.gov website.\n\nCandidates seeking information about positions at the U.S. Department of State may wish to contact the Diplomat in Residence responsible for their geographic area. Full information on the Diplomats in Residence Program, including contact details, is available under the Connect Tab\n\nThe FSOT will still factor into the decision of whether to advance a candidate to the Foreign Service Officer Assessment (FSOA). However, the FSOT will no longer be a pass/fail gateway test.\n\nRather, we will give all candidates the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and abilities via their responses to Personal Narrative prompts and their professional experience.\n\nThese responses, in addition to their FSOT score, will determine who gets invited to the FSOA Assessment.\n\nThe FSOT will still factor into the decision of whether to advance a candidate to the Foreign Service Officer Assessment (FSOA).

There are mentoring processes. You can locate the Diplomat in Residence who is nearest you and contact that person by phone or e-mail. They will be happy to discuss your questions with you. Once you join an orientation class you will have a formal Career Counselor as well as an assigned mentor from a group of volunteer mentors. You’ll get lots of advice and guidance throughout your career.\n\nCandidates to join the Department of State as Foreign Service Officers/Generalists are required to choose one of five career tracks (Consular, Economic, Management, Political, or Public Diplomacy) when they register for the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT). The Department collects this career track information for workforce planning purposes, so as to accurately assess a candidate’s background and qualifications throughout the selection process. Candidates are urged to research and consider carefully the options before they choose.\n\nWhile all FSOs are known as “generalists”, the choice of a functional specialization will determine what type of work you will do for the majority of your career. You can get more details about each career track by going to the Officer Career Track page. We know that this can be a tough decision, so we’ve developed a questionnaire to help you match your interests to the career track that may be right for you.\n\nA security clearance can take anywhere from a couple months to more than a year depending on the particular circumstances candidates should be aware that the clearance process may take longer to complete if they, lived, worked, or were educated in a variety of locations, as this increases the number of places where references and records must be checked. Any potential security concerns as listed in SEAD 4 (linked above) may also take longer to mitigate, depending on the complexity. For more information, visit https://www.state.gov/security-clearances.\n\nSecurity clearances are adjudicated by examining the candidate’s history from a variety of sources, to include references that are identified via DS and court and police records. While criminal and drug history are relevant to the adjudication of a security clearance, there are also factors that mitigate such concerns, such as the amount of time that has passed, and the circumstances under which the behavior occurred, and likelihood of recurrence. For more information, visit https://www.state.gov/security-clearances.\n\nIf you do not want your current employer contacted, you need to advise the Clearance Coordinator who contacts you regarding the completion of your SF-86, and/or annotate it on the SF-86 under that employment entry. While efforts will be made to work with you before contacting any current employment references, it is required that your current employment is verified. The absence of an employment verification will result in your case being adjudicated without satisfying investigative standards. This may result in DS’s inability to consider your eligibility for access to classified information, and may compel DS to err on the side of national security and deny access to sensitive and/or classified information.\n\nStudents tentatively selected for the internship program must undergo a background investigation and receive the appropriate security determination, typically either a Secret or Top Secret security clearance. The clearance process takes approximately 60-120 days to complete from the time you submit your forms to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS). Investigations may take substantially longer than 120 if there is a security, suitability, or medical issue to resolve. In part, these issues could include current or past illegal drug use, to include marijuana, or alcohol abuse, criminal conduct, or a recent history of financial/credit problems. For more information, visit https://www.state.gov/security-clearances.\n\nUpon completion of the background investigation, a Suitability Review Panel will examine a candidate’s completed file (except medical records) to determine suitability for employment with the Foreign Service. In evaluating suitability, the Suitability Review Panel takes into consideration factors such as misconduct in prior employment; criminal, dishonest, or disgraceful conduct; misrepresentation, including deception or fraud in the application process; repeated or habitual use to excess of intoxicating beverages; abuse of narcotics or controlled substances; reasonable doubt as to loyalty to the U.S. Government; conduct which clearly shows poor judgment and/or lack of discretion; and financial irresponsibility, including a history of not meeting financial obligations or an inability to satisfy debts. For a complete list of factors considered, see 3 FAM 2215.2-6 Suitability Criteria. Eligibility for a security clearance and suitability determinations are separate and distinct processes and evaluations, therefore, obtaining a security clearance does not automatically confer a favorable suitability determination.\n\nIf you were born a male after December 31, 1959, and are at least 18 years of age, civil service employment law (5 U.S.C. 3328) requires that you must be registered with the Selective Service System, unless you meet certain exemptions under Selective Service law. If you are required to register but knowingly and willfully fail to do so, you are ineligible for appointment by executive agencies of the federal government. If you are unsure of your registration status, or are seeking further details on exemptions to the registration requirement, you can check the Selective Service System website at: http://www.sss.gov.\n\nCandidates will undergo a background investigation that includes verifying and corroborating key activities, information, and events. In addition to various inquiries into criminal history, credit, and other databases, a Diplomatic Security (DS) background investigator may conduct interviews with you and various references (those you provide and those developed through the investigation).\n\nBased on the information obtained in the investigative process, DS will determine if you are eligible for access to classified information. A Security clearance will enable you to perform the various duties and responsibilities of a Foreign Service or Civil Service employee. The security clearance is adjudicated based on Security Executive Agency Directive (SEAD) 4: National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. These guidelines include factors that may raise security concerns, as well as the circumstances that mitigate those concerns. You are encouraged to review SEAD 4 for awareness of the issues DS considers in making this determination. See SEAD 4 For more information, visit https://www.state.gov/security-clearances.\n\nUpon completion of the background investigation and minimum medical qualification, a Suitability Review Panel is convened for each candidate. The Panel examines a candidate’s total record (except medical files) to determine suitability for employment with the Foreign Service. In evaluating suitability, the Panel considers among other points: misconduct in prior employment; criminal or dishonest conduct; misrepresentation in the application process; use to excess of intoxicating beverages; trafficking in or abuse of narcotics or controlled substances; doubt as to loyalty to the U.S. Government; conduct which clearly shows poor judgment; and lack of financial responsibility, including a history of not filing tax returns or meeting financial obligations.\n\nYes, it is possible to have more than one active candidacy. However, if a candidate accepts a job offer from the Department in one career track while he or she is on an additional register or registers, the signature of a Letter of Offer will close any other candidacies still active or pending with the Foreign Service. Consular Professionals in Limited Non-Career Appointments (LNA) are not considered career positions and accepting an LNA position will not terminate other candidacies.\n\nHome Leave is provided by order of Congress to ensure that Foreign Service employees maintain close ties to the United States while pursuing careers overseas. Home Leave accrues at the rate of 15 workdays per calendar year while on overseas assignment and may be used at the end of a two- or three-year assignment abroad, or at the midpoint of a three- or four-year tour. In addition to providing paid Home Leave, the U.S. government will also pay for employees and family members to travel to a Home Leave address in the United States.\n\nThe Foreign Service is looking for employees who represent the depth and breadth of the United States, and we expect new hires will bring unique skills and life experiences. Those who come to the Foreign Service with decades of experience will have opportunities to share that experience, but they are entry level employees on par with other entry level employees who may not have as many years of experience. The mix of new employees can greatly enrich teams at posts, and most of these second- and third-career new hires find the experience richly rewarding.\n\nYes, certainly. They might opt to bring their own car, or they might buy one from a departing colleague when they arrive at post, or through a diplomatic sales option once they have arrived at post – if available. There are a number of possibilities. Just keep in mind you are limited by certain restrictions – right-hand drive cars, sometimes limitations on retractable headlights, emissions, age or color of vehicle etc. All of this information about a particular country’s requirements is readily available to you once hired.\n\nYes. A candidate may qualify for more than one career track and be on more than one hiring register at a time. For example, applicants may qualify for more than one specialist career track, or they may qualify for a specialist career track as well as a generalist career track. If a candidate accepts a job offer from the Department in one career track while on another register, any other active or pending offers with the Foreign Service will be closed effective the date the candidate signs the Letter of Offer.\n\nThe Department of State will place competitively qualified U.S. citizens into Foreign Service Limited Non-Career Appointments (LNA) in country-specific posts with high workloads. These employees will be fully professional members of consulate and embassy teams. Limited appointments, however, cannot serve as special access or alternate entry to the career Foreign Service or the Department of State, i.e., they do not lead automatically to onward employment at the Department of State or with the U.S. government. LNAs are welcome to apply to become Foreign Service Specialists or Generalists or Civil Service employees, but they must meet the applicable qualifications and complete the standard application and assessment processes. Service time and benefits earned as a Consular Adjudicator can be credited in any subsequent federal employment.\n\nLanguage proficiency tests are given as part of the Consular Fellow Program assessment process. The competitive candidates ranked by the Qualifications Evaluation Panels will be invited to take a language proficiency test with the Language Testing Institute to confirm that they have the required language skills in one of the designated foreign languages (Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, or Spanish). Both speaking and reading will be tested. Candidates will receive their scores from the Consular Fellows Program Unit, along with the invitation to schedule an appointment for the Foreign Service Consular Professional Assessment. Please find a description of the language proficiency test on the Language Tests page.\n\nAs a Consular Fellow you will use your proficiency in Arabic, Mandarin, Portuguese, or Spanish to promote America’s interests by assisting U.S. citizens abroad, fostering economic growth at home, and contributing to U.S. national security.\n\nConsular Fellows work side by side with officers. They may conduct visa interviews, for both Immigrant and Non-Immigrant visas; assist in providing passport and other services to American citizens residing in the consular district; and other duties as assigned by the Section manager.\n\nNo. Applicants are generally starting the application process for graduate school at the same time they are applying for the Pickering/Rangel Fellowship. So, applicants should list programs to which they have applied or plan to apply. No acceptances are required. If you have already been admitted to a program that you plan to attend, you can upload your acceptance letter when submitting your application.\n\nForeign Service candidates who can document creditable veterans’ service by submitting form DD-214 or other certification will be eligible to receive additional points on the Hiring Register: 0.175 for a five-point standing and 0.35 for a 10-point standing. In all cases points are awarded once a candidate has passed the Foreign Service Officer or Specialist Assessment. Instructions on how to claim these points are provided at that time. Qualifying, preference-eligible veterans may be appointed from the rank-ordered register at any time before they turn 65. If appointed between the ages of 60 to 65, a qualifying, preference-eligible veteran may serve five years prior to being mandatorily retired."
