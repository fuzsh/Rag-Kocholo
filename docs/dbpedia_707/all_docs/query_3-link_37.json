        "text": "ACADEMIC TITLES AND DEGREES\n\nDr. and Professor\n\nDon't use these in writing before people's names, as a rule. Not all faculty members hold a doctoral degree, and not all hold the rank of full professor. Instead, use the styles below:\n\nJane Smith, Ph.D., biology\n\nJane Smith, biology faculty Jane Smith (biology)\n\nTo authoritatively confirm a faculty member's official title and degree(s), contact that faculty member directly, or Cathy Thiele, assistant to the provost and academic dean. (The GO site [people tab] is a handy reference for current faculty job titles, but occasionally a posted title is out of date.)\n\nFormal College communications occasionally use Dr. before a person's name—particularly when referring to speakers visiting the campus. We also occasionally use \"Professor\" (never \"Prof.\") as a courtesy title before the name of an established faculty member who does not have a Ph.D.\n\nOur goal is to be courteous and appropriate, and these guidelines are flexible. They apply to the College's more formal written communications. They don't apply to the many forms of less formal writing that occur in the course of College life—departmental newsletters, on-campus posters, et al. When speaking, many of us routinely use \"Dr.\" and \"Professor\" as titles, and these guidelines are not intended to criticize this.\n\nFirst and second references\n\nIn a formal first reference to a faculty or staff member, use the person's formal first name and last name followed by degree (if applicable) and lowercased job title. If the individual routinely uses his or her middle name, include it. If the individual is widely known by a shortened name or nickname, include it in parentheses.\n\nValerie Gin, Ed.D., professor of kinesiology\n\nIf the faculty member holds an endowed chair, include and capitalize all honorifics.\n\nBruce Herman, M.F.A., Lothlórien Distinguished Chair of Visual Arts\n\nIn formal and informational College communications, use the person's last name only in references that follow. However, it's fine to use first names when that style better suits the tone of a feature article.\n\nSpelling out and abbreviating academic degrees\n\nWhen writing about one of the seven degrees the College grants, spell out the name of the degree on first reference and use the abbreviation thereafter. Lowercase the name of the academic program (e.g. Bachelor of Arts in psychology) Spell, space and abbreviate like this:\n\nBachelor of Arts / B.A. Bachelor of Music / B.M. Bachelor of Science / B.S.\n\nMaster of Arts / M.A. Master of Education / M.Ed.\n\nMaster of Music Education / M.M.E. Master of Science / M.S.\n\nIn general reference to a type of degree, lowercase the name/level of the degree, and in some cases, use the possessive (not plural) form.\n\ndoctorate master's degree bachelor's degree bachelor's in music\n\nIn a sentence that mentions a degree earned by an individual, spell out and lowercase the name of the degree on first reference; abbreviate it thereafter.\n\nDr. Bird earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Auckland University, a Bachelor of Divinity from London University, a Bachelor of Music from Berklee College of Music, and a master's and doctorate from Harvard University.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nSome publications omit periods from the abbreviations of academic degrees. It is Gordon College style to include periods, except in two special cases: MBA and MPH.\n\nCapitalize the first letter of the abbreviation for each word the abbreviation represents, and follow each with a period. Don't space between them. Common abbreviations appear below; find others on the Internet, and adjust the style to match the guidelines above.\n\nEmeritus versus retired\n\nRefer to retired faculty in one of two ways. Sequence the words as shown below; do not capitalize or italicize.\n\nNiles Logue, retired professor of economics and business\n\nRussell Bishop, professor emeritus of history and Stephen Phillips Chair of History\n\nEmeritus is the masculine form, emerita is the feminine form, and emeriti is the plural form of an official honorific. At Gordon the trustees confer these titles on faculty members who retire after 10 or more years of service at Gordon College. This occurs one year after the individual retires. A list of professors emeriti appears near the end of the academic catalog as the last subsection of the list of faculty; use the boldfaced Latin words above only in reference to individuals listed there.\n\nAlways refer to former members of the Board of Trustees as emeritus, emerita or emeriti.\n\nJames H. Roberts '66B, trustee emeritus\n\nJOB TITLES\n\nCapitalize and spell out in their entirety Gordon College job titles that precede names. If you wish to make an exception to the rule of thumb above and use \"Professor\" before a faculty member's name, spell it out, and omit the name of the academic department.\n\nPresident Michael D. Hammond\n\nProfessor Elaine Phillips\n\nLowercase and spell out job titles that follow names or stand alone.\n\nMichael D. Hammond, president of Gordon College\n\nElaine Phillips, professor of biblical studies\n\nAn admissions counselor will present an overview of the application process.\n\nLowercase words that identify jobs, but are not official job titles.\n\ngroundskeeper member of the design staff librarian lecturer\n\nPERSONAL NAMES AND TITLES\n\nUse a person's full name on first reference. Thereafter, in formal and informational College communications use the last name only. However, it's fine to use first names when that style better suits the tone of a feature article.\n\nAlumni\n\nUse the style above, and on first reference, follow the name with the person's abbreviated class year, spaced, punctuated and abbreviated as shown below. For a Barrington alumnus, follow the year with a capital B (no space in between). To refer to an individual who spent just one year at Gordon or Barrington, follow the name with an abbreviation of that academic year, and precede it with a lowercase x. For graduates of Gordon's master's programs, use a capital M before the apostrophe and graduate year, with no spaces in between.\n\nOn this web page, the apostrophe before the class year appears as a \"straight quote,\" but for other media type an apostrophe that is a \"smart quote\" —a curved single closing quotation mark that points to the left.\n\nIf an alumna's last name is different than it was at the time she attended Gordon, use the style shown below: position the class year after the person's \"Gordon era last name\" and then follow it with the last name she uses now. If a couple's names appear together in sequence, put parentheses around the wife's Gordon-era last name to make it clear this is not the name she uses at present as her surname; place their common last name after the husband's name only.\n\nFor Jessica Hansmeier '07, serving and working are wrapped in one package. Hansmeier moved to Palestine in August without a return ticket.\n\nOdell Grooms '78B\n\nRuth-Marie Bratt x'49 Goff\n\nSasha (Massand) '01 and Dan Moen '04\n\nRichard Smith M'15\n\nJordan Heckelmann ’15 M’18\n\nException: In STILLPOINT Alumni Notes and in some Alumni Office communications, use first names on second/subsequent reference.\n\nWhen an alumnus also is the parent of a Gordon student (or more recent alumnus), add a capital P and the son or daughter's class year, in this format:\n\nJon Tymann '83, P'12\n\nClergy\n\nConventions for how to refer to a member of the clergy differ among denominations. If written communication from the individual is on hand or can be viewed online, let that be your guide. Consult on-campus sponsors about the correct title to use when writing about a member of the clergy who will be participating in a campus event.\n\nSome denominations still use phrases such as the Most Reverend in clerical titles. On this point it is the College's policy to err on the side of respectfulness. Use the when the honorific is spelled out and the individual's full name is used; with abbreviations, or on second reference with the person's last name only, it is not necessary. Consult the Chicago Manual of Style 8.29, 15.18, and 15.22 for additional style points regarding abbreviation, capitalization and word sequence.\n\nAbbreviate some clergy titles before names; spell others out.\n\nRev. Dr. Pastor Rabbi Sister Father\n\nCoaches\n\nThe rules above apply. Capitalize Coach or Assistant Coach before a name (and any other major words in the coach's official job title if you wish to state it in full). Lowercase them when they follow a name. On subsequent references, use the person's last name only in College communications for a broad audience. Never refer to a person just as \"Coach,\" except in a direct quotation. As a rule, Gordon communications do not include degrees after coaches' names.\n\nCoach Peter Amadon Peter Amadon, tennis coach Amadon\n\nException: In Gordon Athletics communications, second references may include the title.\n\nJr., Sr., III, IV\n\nDon't use a comma between a name and Jr., Sr., III, and so on.\n\nJames Bartos Jr.\n\nMr., Ms. and other personal titles\n\nIn some formal College communications, it is appropriate to use a title before an individual's last name on second and subsequent references. Use abbreviations: Mr., Ms., Mrs., Miss, Dr., Rev.\n\nMs. works for married and unmarried women. Some women prefer it; if possible, ask. If it’s not feasible to inquire about a woman’s preference, use Ms. It is the safest term to use when marital status is unknown (in the same way Mr. is used).\n\nTrustees\n\nAs a rule, trustee(s) is lowercased and Board of Trustees (Board on second reference) is capitalized. Use standard job title rules (see above) when listing a trustee’s specific role on the board. When referring to someone as a general member of the Board, do not use the word “trustee” itself as a title (e.g. Trustee Forkner). Use trustee members’ full names on first reference, and do not list degrees after trustee unless specified."
