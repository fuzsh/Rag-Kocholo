        "text": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects employment opportunities in software development and engineering to grow by 25% from 2022-2032. Increasing demand for mobile applications and medical software drives this faster-than-average job growth.\n\nThough the field can be competitive, pursuing a software engineering career offers many rewarding benefits. The BLS reports that software developers and engineers earned a median annual salary of $132,270 in 2023.\n\nOn this page, we map out the steps you can take to become a software engineer. Read on to learn what education and experience you need to excel in this in-demand field.\n\nWhat Is a Software Engineer?\n\nSoftware engineers develop, design, and test software systems and applications to meet specific needs. They rely on diverse skills in programming, technical design, and analysis.\n\nDuring the development process, software engineers interact with clients, software users, designers, programmers, analysts, and other engineers. Daily tasks can vary widely depending on the software engineer's specialty. For example, some engineers focus exclusively on front-end, customer-facing products, while others address back-end, server-side issues.\n\nTo learn more about what software engineers do, visit the link below.\n\nWhat Does a Software Engineer Do?\n\nSoftware engineering is a branch of applied computer science. Theoretical computer science studies the formal aspects of algorithms, programs, and languages. Applied computer science, by contrast, considers the development of algorithms, programs, and software. A software engineer typically specializes in an aspect of software development, like programming or user interface design.\n\nPeople commonly conflate software engineering roles with computer engineering and information technology (IT) roles. Unlike software engineers, however, computer engineers design and construct hardware such as microchips, circuit boards, and routers. IT professionals manage networks and databases or install and service software, computers, and networks.\n\nIndividuals with software engineering certificates or degrees commonly work in IT roles, along with some computer engineering and computer science positions.\n\nTop Online Programs\n\nExplore programs of your interests with the high-quality standards and flexibility you need to take your career to the next level.\n\nRequired Education for Software Engineers\n\nEducation requirements for software engineers vary depending on skills, experience, and career aspirations.\n\nMost employers prefer or require software engineers to hold at least a bachelor's degree in a relevant discipline like software engineering, computer science, information technology, or computer and information systems. Professionals interested in management positions may benefit from a master's in software engineering.\n\nSoftware engineers may also develop their skills through college certificate programs, associate degrees, or alternative pathways like self-study or bootcamps. Bootcamps provide intense short-term training that develops skills through hands-on projects.\n\nPh.D. programs in software engineering offer a rigorous, research-oriented program for individuals who want to work in research or academics. Ph.D. candidates tailor their education to their interests, often culminating in a project or dissertation.\n\nRegardless of their education level, all software engineers can benefit from professional certification and continuing education opportunities.\n\nComputerScience.org is an advertising-supported site. Featured or trusted partner programs and all school search, finder, or match results are for schools that compensate us. This compensation does not influence our school rankings, resource guides, or other editorially-independent information published on this site.\n\nMatch me with a bootcamp.\n\nFind programs with your skills, schedule, and goals in mind.\n\nMATCH ME TO A BOOTCAMP\n\nRequired Experience for Software Engineers\n\nExperience requirements for software engineers vary by position. Employers with large software development teams often hire candidates into different tiers according to experience level:\n\nJunior/Associate Software Engineer: Entry-level; less than one year of experience required, ideal for recent college graduates\n\nSoftware Engineer I, II, or III: Mid-level; experience requirements vary by position/employer, typically 1-3+ years\n\nSenior Software Engineer: Mid-level and late career; experience requirements vary by position/employer, typically 3-5+ years; job candidates with a master's may need less experience\n\nWhen applying for software engineering jobs, sharing a portfolio of completed work can help you stand out. Software engineering bootcamps can provide you with essential education through hands-on, project-based assignments. Entry-level applicants also benefit from pursuing internships during or after college.\n\nInternship Opportunities\n\nCertifications for Software Engineers\n\nCertification, while optional, shows employers a level of proficiency and dedication that can help engineers stand out during the recruitment process. Below, we explore several popular certifications for software engineers.\n\nHow to Become a Software Engineer\n\nComputer science professionals enter their careers from a variety of paths. The most traditional way to become a software engineer is by earning a bachelor's degree, gaining internship experience, then entering the job market. Software engineers may also begin their education with an associate degree, later transferring to a bachelor's program.\n\nSome software engineers learn programming and computer science essentials through self-study and practice. While independent learners can access a wealth of free programming information online, learning on your own takes a significant amount of time.\n\nFurthermore, self-taught software engineers may face hiring challenges, as employers tend to prefer applicants with formal education. Self-taught tech professionals can boost their resumes with bootcamps, internships, projects, and certifications.\n\nSteps to Become a Software Engineer\n\nBachelor's Degree Path\n\nEarn a Bachelor's Degree: Most software engineering jobs require at least a four-year bachelor's degree.
