These degrees directly lead to roles in policing, social work, victim and survivor advocacy, crime analysis and prevention, and criminal rehabilitation. You can also combine a criminal justice degree with training in other fields to access advanced and specialized careers.\n\nWhat can you do with a criminal justice degree?\n\nCommon jobs you can get with a criminal justice degree include police officer, probation officer, correctional officer, private investigator, and social worker. With additional training, you may also pursue specialized and technical roles in forensic science, medicine, research, public policy, and law, among other areas.\n\nWhat criminal justice job pays the most?\n\nTwo of the top-paying jobs available to professionals with standalone criminal justice degrees include police chiefs and prison wardens. Both positions represent the summit of their professions, and typically require many years of on-the-job experience in addition to schooling.\n\nYou can enter other high-paying careers by combining criminal justice with a few different advanced degrees.
