This career requires a college degree and at least five years of experience.

[/icon_content]\n\nBest States for Careers in Criminal Justice\n\nAlongside factors like education, experience, and job title, one's location can greatly impact salary and potential for upward mobility.\n\nLarger population densities tend to correlate with higher crime rates, so major cities and high-population states tend to offer both the largest number of job openings and the highest wages.

While California-based detectives take home larger paychecks than detectives in Utah, detectives in Utah enjoy lower costs of living.\n\nIn addition to income considerations, location also determines what types of criminal justice careers become available.
