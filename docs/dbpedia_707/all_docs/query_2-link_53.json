Of course, they must demonstrate a strong technical skillset and an outstanding project portfolio to beat the competition.\n\nThe 365 Data Science program provides an excellent way to acquire the skillset needed to land a job as a data scientist. We’ve partnered with world-class data scientists from companies like Meta, Netflix, Spotify, and Google to develop a comprehensive curriculum that teaches you business, technical, and soft skills to excel in the ever-evolving work landscape.\n\nSought-After Technical Skills for Data Scientists\n\nThe variety of technical skills mentioned in job postings reflects the diverse and extensive expertise a data scientist must bring—from basic data analysis skills to advanced specialization in various domains.\n\nCompared to previous years, we see an increase in the demand for advanced data science skills. Still, despite the evolving tech landscape, the core of entering the field remains the same: statistics knowledge and solid data analysis skills form the foundation of data science expertise.\n\nData Analysis Skills\n\nEmployers’ requirements vary from generalized skills like data visualization (10.2%) and statistical analysis (7.7%) to concrete techniques [A/B testing (1.6%), time series analysis (1.3%), etc.] and tools [Statistical Analysis System (SAS), 6.2%].\n\nExcel is still an essential asset in the data scientist’s toolbox, mentioned in 10% of job postings—although to a lesser extent than in previous years (26% in 2023). And surprisingly, many offers mention other Microsoft Office tools, too.\n\nThe number of data visualization libraries and software mentioned in data scientist job postings further emphasizes the importance of presenting and communicating the extracted insights. Unsurprisingly, the most popular choices are Tableau (11.5%) and Power BI (9.1%).\n\nCoding Skills\n\nIn addition to data analysis and visualization, coding is the other building block of data science expertise.\n\nAnd what is the number one programming language for data scientists?\n\nNo big surprises here: Python holds the lead with 57%, followed by R (33%) and SQL (30%). Java (9%) and SAS (5%) take the very distant fourth and fifth places, respectively.\n\nBut while there’s hardly any change in the types of programming languages, the percentage of job offers mentioning them has decreased. In 2023, 78% of job postings required Python, while SQL stood at 60%.\n\nCould this be the impact of AI on the data science job market?\n\nData Science and AI\n\nOur findings demonstrate that the field’s transformation is already at full speed.\n\nAlmost a quarter of job postings contained ‘AI’ or ‘artificial intelligence.’ In addition, we observe a noticeable spike in companies seeking various skills related to developing AI models. Most notably, the demand for natural language processing skills has increased from 5% in 2023 to 19% in 2024.\n\nMachine learning was mentioned in over 69% of data scientist job postings, with some ads specifying the required algorithms and methods.\n\nOther companies went a step further, seeking candidates skilled in AI tools like:\n\nPyTorch: 10.8%\n\nTensorFlow: 10.4%\n\nscikit-learn: 6.4%\n\nKeras: 3.6%\n\nGPT/ChatGPT: 1.5%\n\nTransformers: 1.1%\n\nHugging Face: 0.7%\n\nLangChain: 0.4%\n\nTheano: 0.2%\n\nPinecone: 0.1%\n\nAlthough outside the primary requirements, specializing in any of these tools and frameworks will give you a competitive edge.\n\nAdvanced Data Skills\n\nAnother significant trend we’ve noticed in the past few years is the amplification of competencies required by data scientists in smaller firms. Companies often look for full-stack data experts with superb data analysis and ML skills and are also competent in cloud computing, data engineering, and architecture.\n\nOf course, this is partially due to the interlinked nature of data science roles and hiring managers’ difficulty navigating this complex field. Still, it’s a noticeable trend that we cannot dismiss. So, we’ve grouped and presented some of the advanced data skills we encountered among the data scientist requirements.\n\nSome frequently mentioned data engineering skills and software include (among others):\n\nMicrosoft Azure: 28.5%\n\nApache Spark: 11.7%\n\nBig data: 7.7%\n\nHadoop: 7.1%\n\nDocker: 6.9%\n\nData pipelines: 4.7%\n\nETL: 4.4%\n\nData modeling: 4.4%\n\nThe most popular cloud skills and software mentioned in data science job offers include Microsoft Azure (28.5%), AWS (19.7%), Apache Spark (11.2%), data management (7.4%), Apache Hadoop (7%), Docker (6.8%), and Kubernetes (4%).\n\nLastly, some data architecture competencies also appeared in a small number of job offers, including cloud computing (4.8%), microservice architecture (2.9%), NoSQL databases (1.8%), etc.\n\nWhere Do Data Scientists Work?\n\nWith mass layoffs and hiring freezes in the tech sector and beyond, which industries hire data scientists in 2024?\n\nThe most significant percentage of job offers is in Technology & Engineering (28.2%), followed by job postings from HR companies (19%) hiring for various industries.

Yet, our study reveals that the most commonly posted salary range is \\$160,000–\\$200,000 annually. But note that only 37.8% of job postings announced the salary.\n\nThis reveals the numerous factors and biases affecting salary range reports. While Glassdoor’s data comes from employees who volunteer this information, our source is the hiring companies who are much more likely to report renumerations when they’re considered attractive.\n\nIn addition, salaries vary significantly by years of experience.\n\nBelow are Glassdoor’s estimates of the median annual total pay for data scientists in the US based on years of experience:\n\n0-1 years: $117,276\n\n1-3 years: $128,403\n\n4-6 years: $141,390\n\n7-9 years: $152,966\n\n10-14 years: $166,818\n\n15+ years: $189,884\n\nWhile most job postings in our research didn’t specify the required work experience, the most significant percentage was for mid-level positions.\n\nOf course, factors like industry, location, education, and company size also influence data science salaries.\n\nStill, data science is a high-paying career with a growing trajectory. The average data scientist’s salary reported by Glassdoor in 2023 was $125,242/year, with entry-level positions starting at \\$83,011/year.\n\nIs There a Demand for Data Scientists in 2024?\n\nA few years ago, data science was a fancy word with little meaning to the average person. Now, the world has a better understanding of what the field encompasses. With a growing awareness of the significance of data in all areas of work and life and the commercialization of AI solutions, the demand for jobs in data science is on the rise. But the job requirements are changing.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, data scientist positions will continue to be among the fastest-growing jobs in 2024. The projected increase in job openings from 2022 to 2032 is 35%.\n\nIn addition, the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs 2023 report estimates that by 2027, the demand for AI and machine learning specialists will increase by 40%, and for data analysts, scientists, engineers, BI analysts, and other big data and database professionals will grow by 30%–35%.\n\nThe Data Scientist Job Market in 2024: Challenges, Opportunities, and Requirements\n\nOur findings revealed some intriguing—although expected—data science job trends in 2024. While fundamental data analysis and programming skills are still the most required competencies, employers’ expectations have expanded to include more advanced specializations like cloud, data engineering, data architecture, and (mostly) AI-related tools.\n\nAll this demonstrates that data scientists are still very much in demand, but the requirements are shifting. With rising expectations and more opportunities for mid-level and experienced specialists, the barrier to entry is higher—but so are the career development opportunities.\n\nThe data analyst job is a great stepping stone to a data science career if you‘re new to the field.
