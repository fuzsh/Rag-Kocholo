Students can typically complete their Accounting degree and the specific course requirements for the CPA in the minimum 120 credits required to earn the degree. However, if 150 credits are required to fulfill the education requirements to obtain a CPA license, students must complete 30 credits beyond the specific course requirements to be licensed. These additional credits can be completed in several ways, as illustrated below. Please consult the Board of Accountants in the state where you intend to take the exam for their specific requirements because requirements can vary between states. For details on various states' CPA requirements visit www.nasba.org.\n\nGraduate Programs\n\nThe Smith School offers several specialty master's degrees including one in accounting. Credits from these programs can apply to the 150 credits required for the CPA, and these programs can further enhance your accounting knowledge and skills or provide you with more depth in another area of business. In addition, accounting majors can pursue +1 Dual Bachelor's/Master's degrees and take up to 10 credits of graduate credit as an undergraduate at undergraduate tuition rates. In addition, some graduate credits can satisfy undergraduate degree requirements. For more details on these programs visit Business Master’s and Plus 1.\n\nIn addition, many institutions offer graduate programs for undergraduate accounting students. Consult institutions in your area about the availability of these types of graduate degrees.\n\nDouble Majors/Degrees\n\nAccounting majors can select a second major in or outside the Smith School. Any credits required to complete the second major, above the 120 minimum required for a degree, can be applied toward the 150 total credits to obtain a CPA license. Students who accumulate 150 credits while completing both majors are eligible to earn two degrees upon their graduation.\n\nObtain information on majors outside the Smith School.\n\nMinors\n\nThe Smith School of Business currently offers two minors that are open to Smith School students, Business Analytics and Innovation & Entrepreneurship. Additionally, many minors are offered in other departments across the campus.\n\nSmith Undergraduate Fellows Program\n\nThe Smith Undergraduate Fellows program is an innovative concept in undergraduate business education, offering a series of special academic programs—or tracks—that will create small communities of scholars within the larger Smith School community. Each specialized fellows program combines opportunities for action learning and professional development with rigorous in-depth academic coursework focused on cutting-edge issues affecting 21st-century business.\n\nStudy Abroad Programs (summer, winter, and/or semester programs)"
