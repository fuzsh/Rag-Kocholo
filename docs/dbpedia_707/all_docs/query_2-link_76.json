        "text": "Many rewarding careers today involve numbers. Numbers may not be the central focus of these professions, but they can serve as critical building blocks of a larger and more meaningful whole. Mechanical engineers, for example, work with numbers for the design and production of all types of simple and complex machines. Actuaries use numbers to calculate and assess the consequences of financial risk. And economists analyze and interpret quantitative data to discern macro- and micro-economic patterns. If you enjoy working with numbers, whether crunching them constantly or calculating occasionally, a wide range of careers out there give you the chance to nurture your numerical need.\n\nIs a Career in Numbers Right for You?\n\nNot all careers that involve numbers are the same. In fact, many differ greatly, and attract a wide range of people with very diverse sets of skills, traits and interests. However, certain commonalities exist, as well. People who work with numbers may possess one or more of the following:\n\nA facility for reasoning and reverse reasoning\n\nReasoning concerns the ability to think logically using analytical, deductive and inductive concepts. Reverse (or backward reasoning) concerns beginning with a stated goal or solution and then working backward to determine a method to reach that goal.\n\nAn understanding of spatial, quantitative and abstract relationships\n\nPeople who work with numbers must be able to apply mathematical concepts beyond numbers in an equation or written on a page.\n\nAn ability to think and communicate in symbols\n\nThe ability to understand, apply and communicate through numerical and other math-related symbols â or, put more simply, knowing the language of math â is essential.\n\nAn ability to analyze, challenge and critique one's own work and the work of others\n\nPart of working with numbers in a collaborative environment is being able to have one's concepts and conclusions confronted and justified.\n\nMathematical modeling\n\nWorking with numbers means modeling with numbers to solve practical problems. Numbers professionals must be able to successfully choose from among a variety of mathematical methods to create, analyze and revise modeling concepts.\n\nAn ability to identify patterns and structures through observation and the analysis of mathematical relationships\n\nNumbers professionals are often challenged by complex problems that require them to break down issues into smaller, simpler parts and discover underlying structures in order to solve them.\n\nA talent for taking risks with mathematical concepts\n\nNumbers professionals must be able to not only identify patterns and structures in mathematical relationships, but also see beyond those patterns and structures to develop new concepts and strategies.\n\nAn attention to detail and precision\n\nAccuracy is a fundamental necessity to mathematical work. Numbers professionals must be able to construct precise formulations, employing both mathematical structures and symbols as well as the written word and spoken language.\n\nAn ability to employ numbers and mathematics with confidence\n\nNumbers professionals must have a solid, usable grounding in the fundamentals of math.\n\nPatience\n\nAn often overlooked characteristic, patience is an absolute necessity for numbers professionals. Arriving at a successful mathematical solution requires the facility to explore and thoroughly analyze a sometimes large number of disparate elements.\n\nStacking Numbers Careers Against Others\n\nOne great piece of news for anyone interested in a career involving numbers is that there are a lot of jobs available that pay well. It is no secret that graduates with STEM-related degrees are in high demand today and are expected to remain in high demand for years to come. High demand for people who work with numbers translates to higher salaries. The chart below illustrates this point by comparing careers that require a math or a math-related degree with those that do not:\n\nNumbers Careers Other Careers\n\nSource for Chart: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nDoes a Master's Degree Pay Off?\n\nIt's the question that every student approaching baccalaureate graduation asks: \"Should I stay in school and earn my master's degree, or is it time to get a job?\" The answer is bound to be a personal one, but there are a number of objective factors to consider. Chief among them are potential career advancement and money. One mistake that many students make is to assume that earning their master's degree will automatically have a significant effect on their careers. Although, in the broadest terms, earning a graduate degree usually means higher salaries and more upward mobility, the truth is that it really all depends on the specific profession.\n\nThe bottom line is that you have to look at the particular job to determine if earning a master's degree will actually pay off. Below is a list of numbers-related careers where a master's degree is most likely to have a positive impact at the beginning of a career, using median starting salaries as a guide:\n\nAccounting/Computer and Electronics Manufacturing\n\nBachelor's: $55,000\n\nMaster's: $66,000\n\nComputer Engineering/Information\n\nBachelor's: $61,305\n\nMaster's: $70,523\n\nFinance/Computer and Electronics Manufacturing\n\nBachelor's: $55,000\n\nMaster's: $69,500\n\nFinance/Food and Beverage Manufacturing\n\nBachelor's: $55,000\n\nMaster's: $100,000\n\nMathematics and Statistics/Finance, Insurance and Real Estate\n\nBachelor's: $50,500\n\nMaster's: $53,000\n\nSource: National Association of Colleges & Employers (NACE) Salary Survey (January 2015).\n\nTop Paying Numbers Jobs in Silicon Valley\n\nThe \"technology boom\" has been around now for decades — so long that calling it a boom might not fit anymore. Regardless of what it's called, the tech industry's epicenter can be traced back to the geographic area south of San Francisco known as the Silicon Valley. Tech is still king there, and so are tech jobs, which means that well-educated and skilled numbers professionals remain in strong demand. Here are just a few high-paying numbers jobs that can be found in Silicon Valley:\n\nAlgorithms Engineer\n\nAlgorithms and data structures are fundamental to the development of all computer applications. Algorithms engineers are employed in every sector of the high-tech industry to design, analyze and evaluate computer algorithms. Algorithms engineers typically hold a bachelor's degree in mathematics, engineering, statistics or a closely related field and must be proficient in one or more programming languages. The big data explosion has increased the demand for algorithms engineers both in Silicon Valley and around the world. While comprehensive salary figures are lacking, algorithm engineers are likely to earn between the high-80s to over $100,000 annually and sometimes much more in Silicon Valley. [Source: Glassdoor].\n\nData Scientist\n\nAgain, big data plays a major role in the increased demand for skilled data scientists. It is the job of data scientists to immerse themselves in the ocean of big data, bringing structure to it that, in turn, allows for effective analysis of that data. Data scientists typically hold a degree in a subject such as computer science or applied mathematics, with many additionally holding a PhD. Salaries for data scientists can start in the mid-90s [Source: Glassdoor]. Top earners can pull in over $200,000 annually. [Source: Fortune.com.]\n\niOS/Android Software Engineer\n\niOS is the mobile operating system developed by Apple and runs several of its mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPad. Android, the operating system developed by Google, is used in non-Apple mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. iOS and Android software engineers design and develop the software as well as many of the applications that run on the two operating systems. Most working software engineers hold a BA or BS in computer science or a closely related subject such as mathematics, but employment may also require some level of practical experience in the field.\n\nMathematical Modeler\n\nSome dictionaries define a mathematical model as âa representation in mathematical terms of the behavior of real devices and objects.\" [Source: Vahid Dabbaghian: What is Mathematical Modeling, pg. 3.] Mathematical modelers, then, design models to describe processes of devices and objects and solve complex problems associated with those devices and objects. Working as a mathematical modeler normally requires the job seeker to hold a PhD in mathematics, applied mathematics or a closely related field. However, in some cases, a master's degree along with experience in the field may suffice. [Source: Michelle Burton: Mathematical Modeler - Career Profile, Animation Career Review (2011).]\n\nFind Your Numbers Career\n\nNumbers careers are everywhere — in every business and industry throughout every sector of the economy.

It has to be somebody who has a keen interest and desire to pursue mathematics at its highest level. It can be a bachelor's degree in math, statistics or any of the hard sciences, like engineering or physics. That would be a good start.\n\nHow about a graduate degree?\n\nThey don't need to get a master's.\n\nAny other suggestions for college?\n\nWhat is unique about the actuarial profession is that, even in college, students can start sitting for the necessary professional exams. To become a fully credentialed actuary, you have to complete all of the exams. That will net you your fellowship either in the Society of Actuaries, which covers life [insurance] and pension markets, or the Casualty Actuarial Society, which covers the property and casualty market.\n\nWould you recommend that a student seek out an internship with an actuarial firm while in college?\n\nAbsolutely. That certainly can help. What's most important is that you come out of college not only with a degree in mathematics or one of the other related hard sciences, but that you have passed at least a couple of the actuarial exams. That demonstrates to employers that you have what it takes to be successful at the exams and have the potential to be successful as an actuary.\n\nWho employs actuaries?\n\nThe insurance industry. That's where the majority of actuaries work — insurance companies or firms that consult with insurance companies. Actuaries do sometimes also work in the banking industry — investment banking or the other financial services.\n\nWhat would be your single best piece of advice to a student who has just graduated college and is seeking a job as an actuary?\n\nMake sure that you have an impressive GPA and, again, that you have passed a couple of the actuarial exams before you graduate. That will put you in good stead to interview.\n\nFor students who are not interested in becoming an actuary but have a math degree, for example, what are some of the related occupations they might consider?\n\nThere are other opportunities for math grads within the insurance industry as well. They can work in areas like risk management, for example. There's a growing area called predictive analytics. There is also catastrophe modeling. So, there are a number of relevant areas where somebody with a math degree can work in the insurance industry but not follow the traditional actuarial exam track.\n\nJob Search Sites\n\nResearching career options requires some real digging, but fortunately there are hundreds of applications and websites designed to make the digging a lot easier. Sources include academic and professional associations and organizations; university math, business, science and engineering departments; government agencies; private businesses; and job recruiter sites. The following is a sample of some of the most helpful sites for numbers career seekers:\n\nCareerRookie\n\nJob search site that specializes in internships, part-time jobs and entry-level career positions.
