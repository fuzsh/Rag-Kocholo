        "text": "Ireland get the finger out, bad enough the credit timeline is 2028, hmm 4 years, planning might just take that alone. This needs a timeline that is understood by investors that if they build it, they will come and not that the credit will run out just as they arrive and they will do a uturn. No point in having a 120 million upper production limit if there is nowhere to go as such. And that somewhere better include full accommodation and amenities given the current housing crisis and lack of hotel accommodation. Joint up thinking is required and then make it clear that this is long term on a twenty-year timescale not the next five minutes. A million square foot of anything Green Film and Sustainable to booth is 400-500m in change, a new indie 40% tax credit on our doorstep I believe for anything under 15m, if we had 750m in spend in 2023 for 150 productions, that's an average of 5m per production, don't see too many 70-120m anything in that average. So, Ireland is at the UK tax credit definition an Indie production house at best. We need to be the Global Hub go to one stop shop and drop. It is not meant to be a game of catch up, it is meant to be set the pace, hell change the rules and even the game.\n\nRecently I had to admit to myself that I started two businesses, not one. Up until now, everything has either been CASA Creative Studios, our film-first creative agency or CASA Film Studios our soundproof studio facility for rent. Two sides of the same CASA coin, just different customers, using different amounts of us. It made total sense to me without need for the explanation but unfortunately not to everyone else (or Google). And in practise, they are completely different client bases that share almost no similarities. As a team, at the start of this year, we decided to rebrand the studio rental business to Tooting Film Studios and effectively make it a client of our CASA Creative Studios business. In turn, being our own living case study and for us to experience our own creative and strategic medicine. We often advise clients on tough decisions and help them focus down on the new path. Flipping the tables and being on the receiving end of that advice for ourselves has been illuminating and renews my admiration for all the businesses that have gone down that difficult path. Pivoting away from things you’ve been investing in emotionally and financially is a hard decision. It feels like defeat. And sure, reasonable people will say, \"it’s not a defeat, you’ve learnt something.\" They’re not wrong but that doesn’t make it any easier to make the call. The only thing that will make it easier is knowing that as soon as you’ve agreed on the problem, you pulled the lever to get on with fixing it quickly. Below is a blog I wrote that goes into more detail about the naming choices. I’ll be doing a breakdown video on our creative treatment soon. I won’t be speaking much about our Tooting Film Studios business here, so give us a follow if you’re interested in seeing the content we’re making for it.\n\nIn the context of movies, \"studios\" typically refers to facilities or companies involved in the production, distribution, and sometimes exhibition of films. Here's a breakdown: 1. **Production Studios**: These are facilities where films are produced. They include sound stages for filming, editing rooms, post-production facilities, and other necessary infrastructure for creating movies. Production studios may be owned by major entertainment companies or operate independently. 2. **Film Studios**: This term can refer to both production studios and companies that oversee the entire process of filmmaking, from development and financing to production and distribution. Examples include major Hollywood studios like Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, and Paramount Pictures. 3. **Studio System**: Historically, the studio system referred to the dominant model of film production in Hollywood during the early to mid-20th century. Under this system, major studios controlled all aspects of filmmaking, including contracts with actors, directors, writers, and other talent, as well as distribution and exhibition through their own theater chains. 4. **Independent Studios**: These are smaller production companies that operate outside the major studio system. They may focus on niche or independent films and often collaborate with larger studios for distribution. Overall, \"studios\" in the context of movies encompasses the physical facilities where films are made, as well as the companies and entities responsible for creating and distributing them. #MovieStudios #FilmProduction #HollywoodStudios #FilmIndustry #StudioSystem #IndependentFilm #MovieMaking #EntertainmentIndustry #FilmStudio #ProductionCompany\n\nThe UK is bigger than Hollywood and the shear gap in studio real estate will undoubtedly continue to grow. This is a sector I have been following closely for the past few years, as more and more studio space has gotten planning permission and subsequently opening their doors. In recent years, we have seen the launch of Sky Studios Elstree, Shepperton completed it's expansion earlier this month to become the world's second largest studio lot and now the half-billion dollar investment into a sizable studio lot in Sunderland. Even as far back as 2022, the BFI had noted that the UK had surpassed Hollywood in terms of space. There is an underlying concern that all this space may prove to be too much, I beg to differ. Netflix, Disney and Amazon have all secured long term leases on sound stages at Pinewood and Shepperton, effectively taking the majority of the stages off the market for the next few years. Couple this with the fact that the UK has over 56,000 talented film and TV crew members, the second largest base of talent in the world, and increased tax relief scheme for 2024, making the UK an attractive place to produce high-budget film and television. There are numerous challenges that face Hollywood retaining it's market share for film & TV production. Los Angeles is already a dense city, proving difficult to acquire and redevelop space necessary for a large studio. With an additional 19 sound stages coming onboard, as part of the latest planned studio lot, the UK is cementing itself at the international destination of choice for high-end film and TV production.\n\nPhone Up Studios is out of Laredo, Texas. Which brings up the obvious question, why did Phone Up go to Atlanta and LA to build studios, since the economic benefits certainly would be good for Laredo? (and why did the press release come out of Nebraska?) Answer, greater emphasis on film production support services, supplies, and labor. (as for the Nebraska press release, who knows) For a region without an existing presence of major film making activity, the private, public, and education sectors would have to contribute to the effort along with a major film studio company, with a history of successful studio construction and launching, orchestrating the effort. As to exactly why Phone Up went out of Texas (other than Atlanta and LA are well prepared for film studios) if someone knows, please educate me.\n\nFrom the FT: Europe’s largest privately owned #cinema operator Vue International is moving into #film distribution following a lack of supply after the #Hollywood strikes. The company set up a distribution arm in the UK last month with the goal of rolling out British, foreign and independent films on its own screens and those of rivals. Vue also announced during the Marché du Film - Festival de Cannes last month that it would team up with UK producers Andy Paterson and Annalise Davis, and virtual production company Dimension Studio, in a project to distribute films they produce. “Because of the Hollywood strikes, we are suffering this year with a number of movies, [as] we have a supply issue,” chief executive Tim Richards told the Financial Times. “As a consequence, we thought it was a very opportune time to start bringing our own movies in.” He added that Vue would eventually expand its distribution business to continental #Europe and that it was hiring for the business. Moving into distribution is a relatively unusual move for a cinema chain, but the new arm will allow Vue to gain greater control of films after a period of limited supply. Vue, which operates 220 sites in eight countries including the UK, Ireland, Germany and Italy, earlier this year released Italian dramedy There’s Still Tomorrow in the UK in its first attempt to distribute a movie. The world’s largest cinema chain, the US’s AMC Theatres , is also expanding its distribution business following its success in concert films such as Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour and Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé. Vue’s Richards said its eight-year experience in building and deploying a predictive artificial intelligence model to determine what films to show on which screens would give the distribution arm a head start in matching films with particular cinemas. “We know who wants to see Asian films, Turkish films, Polish or Italian films. We know where those audiences are because of our extensive use of AI,” he said. The #technology allows Vue to adjust scheduling to demand with more day-to-day and intraday variation. The company claimed it had been able to screen more films on any given week than other competitors. “Normally you would give an opening film the biggest and best screen on opening weekend,” Richards said. “[But] the #AI would say, maybe with this movie, you should give it the second-biggest screen and keep last week’s movie on the big screen for another week because it’s still doing really well.” Hancock added: “Cinema is quite a traditional sector. Taking away the film programmer and putting in machine learning to schedule films was quite a bold move [ . . . ] Competitors haven’t done this yet at scale,” he said.\n\nHollywood’s Senior Directors Lead Movies’ Return To Theaters – Deadline https://ift.tt/a93oKAC 2023-09-29 02:30:00 With guild agreements being signed and manufacturing ramping up, Hollywood hopefully awaits a second of youthful innovation. Oops: The most newsworthy movies set for imminent launch are directed by filmmakers of their 80s – grizzled veterans who perceive their muscle however, just like the neophytes, are perplexed by the chaotic panorama. Will this turn into a Back to the Future second? Ageism debates about Biden (80) and Trump (77) might immediate political headlines, but it surely’s not intruding on both The Golden Bachelor (Gerry Turner is 72) or the film launch date calendar. Still, speak to Michael Mann (Ferrari), Ridley Scott (Napoleon) or Martin Scorsese (Killers of the Flower Moon) and also you received’t encounter the form of “we own the system” bluster held by the old-time studio administrators. Behind them is a fair older lineup of classic filmmakers: Woody Allen (87) and Roman Polanski (90), whose films await launch dates, and Francis Coppola (84), who would welcome distribution for his self-financed epic Megalopolis which remains to be in post-production. Even the previous grasp Steven Spielberg (76) acknowledges disappointment with the discharge of his most up-to-date movies (The Fabelmans) or of his manufacturing firm Amblin. He misses the hubris of the ‘70s when Jaws went 100 days over schedule and Universal determined to not discover. The instances are transformative, however is that excellent news or dangerous? The movies of the older technology all replicate the knowledge and abilities of the previous, but in addition carry some baggage. Scorsese (80) has been essentially the most self-critical of his technology. He believes his $200 million Killers of the Flower Moon starring Leonardo DiCaprio represents a forceful refutation of Marvel films (“they’re about marketing, not cinema”}. (L-R) Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio in ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Apple TV+ / Courtesy Everett Collection But he additionally has some regrets about his earlier award-winning DiCaprio film Shutter Island (“it was a genre movie”). His follow-up, Silence, arguably lacked narrative in addition to style. While Scorsese scored a gala reception at Cannes with Flower Moon, some critics fretted that its violent moments harkened again to the excesses of Gangs of New York. Major field workplace success is nonetheless predicted. Cineastes viewing Napoleon might inevitably examine the Ridley Scott (85) conception with Stanley Kubrick’s legendary Napoleon saga of the late ‘90s — lengthy thought-about the most effective film by no means made. Celebrating his success in 2001, A Space Odyssey in 1968, Kubrick not solely talked up his analysis to his followers, however even circulated a draft of his script, later printed on-line. Kubrick’s Napoleon was speculated to...\n\nAnother disturbing article for the UK indie / film industry by The Guardian if your an indie filmmaker. Headline: #barbiemovie contributed £80 million to the UK economy 💷 Public takeaway from the headline:: Wow UK film industry is smashing it 💪🏻 ✅ Reality of situation: UK indie film is dying ⚰️ and our immensely talented and world leading industry professionals are at the mercy of the big US studios and streamers and the recent sag aftra strike action showed this reality with many unable to work due to productions being call off. What the public needs to hear: “the independent film sector is almost dead, and the UK studio sector is hostage to the fortunes of (mainly) US based entities …\" Michael Kuhn. “UK producers need help … I shake my head in sadness that all our talent is working on US movies and series and that our rich and wonderful UK movie tradition is collapsing so visibly on the world stage.” Mike Goodridge. These are the headlines people need to see, cinema has made a big comeback, in my opinion, the past year with some big titles choosing the big screen over the little one, but the battle for the survival of cinema is still a fragile one and not over. Despite less movies going into the cinema due to the online streamers self releasing, indie films still struggle to finance cinema runs. The fight for UK indie film is clearly reaching critical, as if these seasoned award nominee professionals find it tough, how will the new generation manage to carve careers in a job they love? I'm not saying the Guardian have done a bad job here, they are reporting on the issue but for me the wrong message will be given to 90% of the causal readers skim reading headline, or I am just totally misjudging this? Am I a little to close to this? Relaitly check me please, would love to hear thoughts if you have any... #UkFilm #UkCinema https://lnkd.in/eF3jUeR7"
