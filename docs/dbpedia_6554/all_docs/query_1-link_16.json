        "text": "(00:02) The camera pans at night past a number of headstones in the cemetery, dissolving to a close-up of Marty's headstone. Someone is shovelling dirt behind it.\n\n(00:23) Marty appears and spots that something is going on by his grave.\n\n(00:43, pictured) Marty sees a man digging near his headstone.\n\nSpotter's Note: While the 'Then' and 'Now' shots may well appear dissimilar, this is because the area was chosen as graves had then to be dug on these plots. The monument with the ornate urn was a prop brought to the site for filming, as was to grave at the centre of frame. The leaning headstone to the left of frame can clearly be seen in both photographs.\n\nAlso appeared in:\n\nRandall and Hopkirk (Deceased) - 'Whoever Heard of a Ghost Dying?'\n\nThe Avengers - 'The Gravediggers'\n\nThe Baron - 'Epitaph for a Hero'\n\nThe Champions - 'The Body Snatchers'\n\nThe Adventurer - 'Mr Calloway is a Very Cautious Man'\n\nFeature Films:\n\nThat's Your Funeral (1973)\n\n(01:41) Jeff arrives with Marty and he sees what has concerned Marty. He goes to investigate and gets himself a nasty bump on the head.\n\n(02:41, pictured) The man who has floored Jeff and another who has been digging the grave are dressed in 18th century period costume.\n\n(1B)\n\n'SITE 2'\n\n(in Section L)\n\nNEW SOUTHGATE CEMETERY\n\nBRUNSWICK PARK ROAD\n\nNEW SOUTHGATE\n\nLONDON N11\n\n(09:11) Harper escapes through the cemetery.\n\nSpotter's Note: This location was originally identified by Anthony McKay and Annette Hill in the 1980s. However, finding it once again in 2023 for the purposes of photographing our 'Now' shot proved somewhat challenging as many historic graves at New Southgate Cemetery are now heavily overgrown. One of the cemetery staff, Victoria Crabb, kindly suggested that they would be happy to pinpoint it for us, even if it were inaccessible, if we could provide a name from any of the graves. Just one was legible on the Blu-ray - William Henry Hayes (no relation to this sites creator!) - but it was enough for Harry Crabb to locate it. Hayes' headstone, dated 1902, is the one just to the right of the large cross. The other three are obscured by a bush in the 'Now' shot but can be seen, covered with ivy, in the reverse shot (below) taken to the right of it. William's is to the left of these.\n\nImage © Craig Robins, 2023\n\n(1C)\n\n'SITE 3'\n\n(in Section M)\n\nNEW SOUTHGATE CEMETERY\n\nBRUNSWICK PARK ROAD\n\nNEW SOUTHGATE\n\nLONDON N11\n\nIdentified by:\n\nAnthony McKay and Annette Hill\n\n(09:39) Harper continues through the cemetery, nearing Jeff's position at Marty's graveside.\n\nSpotter's Note: The large cross that Harper is leaning on was intact in 2004 but has since broken at its base. It is now lying in front, on top of the grave, and is visible in the bottom right-hand corner of shot. In addition, the pointed cross behind Harper's right shoulder has toppled backwards but can be seen, partly masked by the top right of the modern headstone. A similar fate has befallen the cross behind and just to the right of that.\n\n(1D)\n\n'SITE 4'\n\n(path between Section L\n\nand Section M)\n\nNEW SOUTHGATE CEMETERY\n\nBRUNSWICK PARK ROAD\n\nNEW SOUTHGATE\n\nLONDON N11\n\nIdentified by:\n\nAnthony McKay and Annette Hill\n\n(10:02) Jeannie searches for Jeff.\n\nSpotter's Note: A tree seen in the episode was still present in 2020 but has since been felled. A bush is growing in its stead. Many of the older graves at the cemetery have settled and shifted. The angel featured here is one such example. As seen in the high-angle view, it is now leaning both away from the camera and to the left, making it impossible to perfectly match any of the original shots in which it appears. Even so, the angel is faring better than its counterpart opposite which was decapitated at some point after 2020!\n\n(39:27) Establishing shot of the cemetery gatehouse.\n\nSpotter's Note: The New Southgate Cemetery gatehouse has been extended since filming. In addition, the original door was bricked up at some point prior to our 2004 photograph being taken. By this time, the original downstairs bay windows, seen to the right of the bricked up doorway, had been rebuilt and re-roofed, the replacement being quite incongruous. More recently, this construction has also been replaced, with the new brickwork being much more in keeping with the rest of the building. Access to the gatehouse is now from Brunswick Park Road, which is odd when you realise that both downstairs bay windows have been replaced with full-length double-glazed doors!\n\n(1H)\n\nCHURCH OF ST. MARY AND ST. THOMAS\n\nKNEBWORTH PARK\n\nKNEBWORTH\n\nHERTFORDSHIRE SG3\n\n(11:01) Mandrake points to his house.\n\nSpotter's Note: This church is reputed to date back to the 12th century when it was sited in Old Knebworth. Archaeological investigations have identified traces of an early settlement between the church and Knebworth House. It is believed that the settlement was abandoned when the park was created in c. 1300. In 1914 work started on a new church, St Martin's, to serve the main population centre of Knebworth, but St. Mary and St. Thomas has remained in use to this day.\n\n(03:55) A crane shot looks down on the steps of the last house in the row (number 35) as the postman approaches to make a delivery.\n\n(04:06) A high angle shot focusing on the door as the postman delivers a letter.\n\n(04:11) A tight shot of a milkman delivering milk to the house.\n\n\"Mandrake Hall\"\n\n(3A)\n\nWEST LODGE\n\n(now Tower Lodges)\n\nHITCHIN ROAD\n\nCODICOTE\n\nHERTFORDSHIRE SG4\n\n(14:52) Jeannie, driving her Mini, enters the grounds of Mandrake Hall.\n\nSpotter's Note: This Grade II listed lodge and gateway was erected in 1816 at the behest of Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton from material of the gatehouse destroyed in the alterations to Knebworth House in 1811, recycling Tudor era materials. The building was initially divided into two two-storey living spaces either side of the archway, with the additional an octagonal stair turret-cum-tower. The building stands 0.9 miles from Knebworth House itself and was part of the Knebworth Estate at the time of filming for Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). It was sold by the Estate and converted to a house in the 1980s, but it was only in 2005, when it was renovated and repaired by WEAL Architects, that significant problems - old and new - were fully addressed. The tower was in a dangerous state, the chalkstone decaying, and the gateway arch near-derelict. The company undertook to repair the building without losing much historic material and character, and were rewarded with an HAA Award for conservation once the work was completed.\n\n(3B)\n\nKNEBWORTH PARK\n\n(now Knebworth Country Park)\n\nKNEBWORTH\n\nHERTFORDSHIRE SG3\n\n(15:00) Jeannie approaches the house along the western driveway and stops to ask Harper is he has seen two men passing by.\n\nSpotter's Note: Knebworth Country Park is the area immediately outside the walls of Knebworth House, and is part of the Knebworth Estate.\n\nOf the trees in this view, the fourth from the left is no longer present. As seen in 1969, it had a distinct lean to one side and it is likely that it fell as a young tree as little evidence of its former presence remains.\n\n(33:09) Dighton arrives via the western driveway with the ransom note, which he intends to hand to Harper for it to be delivered. Harper refuses to deliver it as he is known to Mandrake.\n\nSpotter's Note: The tree at which Dighton parks his car is no longer present. It was then the nearest to Knebworth House on the east side of the avenue (the avenue running south east to north west). The tree has not been replaced.\n\n(36:38, 36:49, 36:57) Harper and Dighton wonder how they can deliver the note and then find inspiration...\n\nSpotter's Note: As previously mentioned, the large tree is no longer present. Some of the other old trees have considerable rot which may explain why. However, it is still possible to work out exactly where the tree once stood because of small details on the church tower in the original shot which only align from the original camera position.\n\n(38:08) A young lad, who has come out to do a spot of fishing, walks into view. Dighton and Harper spring into action, with Dighton asking the boy if he'd like to earn a shilling.\n\nSpotter's Note: As per 33:09, the tree on which Dighton sits is no longer present and has not been replaced. Additionally, as previously mentioned, the tree across the path with the bowed trunk (left of frame) is also absent today.\n\n(38:23) The boy is interested, so Dighton asks him to put the letter \"through the door of the big house\". He hands the boy the letter.\n\n(38:38) After the boy reminds him about the shilling, Dighton hands it over. The boy walks off to the house. Meanwhile, Dighton and Harper run to their car and speed off down the drive.\n\nSpotter's Note: As per 33:09, this tree is no longer present and has not been replaced.\n\n(34:47) Before he can deliver the note, Dighton is surprised to see the door opening. It is Martha, in her dressing gown. Thinking on his feet, he gives her his business card - \"Dighton's Funeral Parlour. Always at your service,\" he announces, raising his hat.\n\nSpotter's Note: Although the 'Now' photographs of Knebworth House were shot with verbal permission, that permission did not extend to shooting any interior detail for the website. Therefore, out of respect for this stipulation, our matching shot was taken with the front door closed rather than ajar.\n\n(38:01) The boy arrives at the gates but is called away by a friend - and does not deliver the ransom note.\n\nSpotter's Note: During the period that ITC filmed at Knebworth House the wrought ironwork on the gate was always incomplete, missing several of its decorations. The gate has now been restored to its original appearance.\n\n(3E)\n\nPERIMETER WOODLAND\n\nELSTREE STUDIOS\n\nSHENLEY ROAD\n\nBOREHAMWOOD\n\nHERTFORDSHIRE WD6\n\n(28:46) Looking out of a window at Mandrake Hall, Jeff spots a man carrying a lantern, heading towards the greenhouse.\n\nSpotter's Note: This shot is likely to have been filmed at some point around the perimeter road. The foliage in the foreground appears to have been placed there for the purposes of filming this shot.\n\nSince Filming: The Elstree Studios backlot area is significantly changed since the 1960s, but some of the perimeter access road has survived.\n\n(4B)\n\nNEUHAUSER STRASSE\n\nALTSTADT\n\nMUNICH 80331\n\nWEST GERMANY\n\nIdentified by:\n\nAnthony McKay\n\n(44:18) Establishing shot of a Munich street.\n\nSpotter's Note: Neuhauser Strasse dates back to at least 1293 and is a part of Munich's famed Old Town. It was for many years in the 20th century a major traffic and tram link in the city, though the trams and traffic are long gone. The street usage was changed as part of the city's redevelopments prior to hosting the 1972 Olympic Games, with it becoming part of Munich's first pedestrian zone. Today it is one of the Old Town's most popular destinations, with shops, restaurants, museums and other attractions on offer there.\n\n(42:34) The hearse drives past the point where Rowley Lane becomes Holmshill Lane.\n\n(42:41) Jeff follows the hearse in his Vauxhall.\n\nSpotter's Note: The neat, flat piece of green that the crew filmed from no longer exists. In its place is a much narrower, scrubby embankment and just beyond that a more recent footbridge over the A1 (which runs parallel with this stretch of Rowley Lane, behind the camera position). Interestingly, this same small piece of land was home to Hertfordshire's last Police Box which stood there until 19th November 1980. The bridge could not have been built until after its removal as it occupies the same spot. The original camera position would also have been swallowed up during construction.\n\n(43:15) Jeff thinks he sees a passing pass, but the road quickly narrows again and he has to continue following the hearse.\n\nSpotter's Note: Although the original camera position was within the boundary of Strangeways Farm, the fence has long since gone which ought to make it possible to shoot from the same spot. Unfortunately, subsequent tree growth blocks the view.\n\nIdentified by:\n\nCraig Robins, January 2020\n\n(43:33) Dighton realises that it is Randall on their tail and accelerates.\n\n(43:37, pictured) Randall now realises that it must be Harper and Dighton in the hearse and accelerates to pursue it.\n\nSpotter's Note: This shot approaches and then passes Rowley Farm, the tree formation being identical to the later shot of the tractor crossing from the farm to the field opposite.\n\n(6B)\n\nSCENE DOCKS\n\nELSTREE STUDIOS\n\nSHENLEY ROAD\n\nBOREHAMWOOD\n\nHERTFORDSHIRE WD6\n\n(47:01) Waiting at the docks, Harper reads something alarming in his newspaper - he tells Dighton and Harry (who sits up out of his coffin) that Mandrake and Martha Watson are to marry. This completely scuppers their plans!\n\nSpotter's Note: When a large part of the Elstree Studios land was sold off to Tesco plc, the Scene Docks and plasterers' building were shortened at their south-western ends as they encroached into the land that had been sold off. The red line in the aerial view demonstrates the approximate 'cut line' through the studio buildings, with everything to the right of the line being demolished. Stage 5 was demolished in its entirety. The orange arrow denotes the approximate filming site."
