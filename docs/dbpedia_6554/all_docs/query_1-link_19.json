        "text": "“That pink Barbie Land set in last weekend’s blockbuster hit? It was built in the Warner Bros. Studios in London” US studio backed projects totalled $1.36 billion in 2022, an increase 36% on 2021. Because of this the UK Film Production industry in the UK is largely shut down due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes in Hollywood. The Walt Disney Company Lucasfilm have a long term lease agreement with Pinewood Group Limited. Warner Bros. Discovery have a studio in Leavesden, London, Netflix and Prime Video & Amazon Studios film at Shepperton Studions Pinewood Group Limited. Universal Pictures have Elstree Studios. Apple TV+ Paramount 20th Century Studios all film in the UK and have all secured long term investment to make sure they continue filming here in years to come. Why? They get a handsome tax break and work with some of the best Prodution Crew in the world. (who are mostly outside of the USA union systems). The knock on affect to the UK Production industry, UK actors, writers, UK crew and all the small independent business that support the industry is huge, both mentally and financially, with no future benefits even if an agreement is reached by SAG-AFTRA. Is now the time for the UK unions Bectu and Equity UK to look at how the UK unions are under the shadow of the US unions and film studios, even when filming in the UK? Make no mistake, the industry must change in order to keep supplying memorable entertainment and to keep moving forward. The distribution of wealth within the industry has never been greater and new agreements must be put in place to reflect how the industry now distributes content. But if UK representatives are not in the room, then no is negotiating on our behalf. https://lnkd.in/eyiGvs5T washingtonpost.com #filmandtv #sagaftra #filmproduction #strikes #entertainmentindustry #streaming #media #barbiemovie #hollywood #amptp"
