Lewis beloved\n\nseries of literary classics. The film continues the spectacular story that began with the Oscar®winning\n\n2005 release, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\n\nwhich earned over $745 million in its worldwide theatrical release, making it one of the most\n\nsuccessful movies ever made, and one of\n\nthe biggest successes in the annals of the\n\nWalt Disney Studios.\n\nAcclaimed director Andrew Adamson\n\n(the Oscar®-winning Shrek, Shrek 2)\n\nembarks on his second Narnian film\n\nadventure from a screenplay he co-wrote\n\nwith Emmy® Award-winning writing\n\npartners Christopher Markus & Stephen\n\nMcFeely (HBOs The Life and Death of\n\nPeter Sellers), who also co-scripted the\n\nfirst film.

Also reprising their roles are executive producer and former\n\nWalden Media executive Perry Moore and co-producer Douglas Gresham, author Lewis\n\nstepson.\n\nOnce again toplining as the Pevensie children are the four young British talents discovered\n\nby Adamson for the first film: 12-year-old Georgie Henley as Lucy, the youngest and the first\n\nto encounter the great Aslan on their new journey through Narnia; 16-year-old Skandar\n\nPRODUCTION INFORMATION\n\n19\n\nPRODUCTION INFORMATION\n\nKeynes as Edmund, the younger boy who betrayed his siblings for his own selfish gain in the\n\nfirst adventure; 19-year-old Anna Popplewell as Susan, the cautious and practical older sister;\n\nand 21-year-old William Moseley as Peter, the eldest of the siblings and now High King of\n\nNarnia who valiantly leads the battle to save his realm from the tyrannical reign of the evil\n\nKing Miraz.\n\nThe films title character is played by\n\nBen Barnes, a 26-year-old British stage\n\nactor best known for his role in the drama\n\nThe History Boys for Londons\n\nNational Theatre Company, the first West\n\nEnd staging of Alan Bennetts award-\n\nwinning play. He recently completed the\n\nfilm adaptation of Noel Cowards Easy\n\nVirtue opposite Jessica Biel and Colin\n\nFirth, starred in the independent feature\n\nBigga than Ben and had a featured role in Matthew Vaughns fantasy film Stardust.\n\nAlso co-starring in the new film are Peter Dinklage (The Station Agent, Death at a\n\nFuneral, Elf ) as Trumpkin the Red Dwarf, who accompanies the Pevensie children on their\n\nnew journey, and Warwick Davis (Willow, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Return\n\nof the Jedi) as the suspicious Black Dwarf, Nikabrik.\n\nVeteran Kiwi actor Shane Rangi (Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Lion, the Witch and the\n\nWardrobe) plays Asterius, the aging minotaur, and British musical theater star Cornell S.\n\nJohn (Sir Trevor Nunns Gershwins Porgy and Bess, Julie Taymors The Lion King) is\n\nGlenstorm, the leader of the centaurs.\n\nThe films international cast includes\n\nacclaimed Italian actor-director Sergio\n\nCastellitto (The Big Blue, Mostly\n\nMartha, Dont Move) as the villainous\n\nKing Miraz; fellow Italian performer\n\nPierfrancesco Favino (Night at the\n\nMuseum, Romanzo Criminale) as the\n\nleader of the Telmarine army, General\n\nGlozelle; Mexican star Damián Alcázar\n\n(Men with Guns, And Starring Pancho\n\nVilla as Himself ) as Lord Sopespian,\n\nanother high-ranking soldier in Mirazs army; Spanish actress Alicia Borrachero\n\n(Periodistas, TVs Hospital Central, Love in the Time of Cholera) as Mirazs loyal wife,\n\nQueen Prunaprismia; and veteran French-Flemish actor Vincent Grass (Vatel, Ma Vie en\n\nRose) as the wise old sage, Doctor Cornelius.\n\nScottish actor Ken Stott (Casanova, King Arthur, The Boxer) lends his vocal talents\n\nto the CGI character of Trufflehunter, the faithful badger.

South Island locales included the isolated\n\nPRODUCTION INFORMATION\n\n21\n\nTHE RETURN TO NARNIA\n\nHaast River Valley bordering the Tasman Sea on the countrys verdant South Westland coast,\n\nand forests near Paradise Valley and Glenorchy outside of Queenstown.\n\nAfter concluding the New Zealand portion of the schedule in late March, the company\n\nrelocated to Eastern Europe and the legendary soundstages at Pragues Barrandov and\n\nModrany Studios. Key exterior locations in the Czech Republic included the Northern\n\nBohemian city of Usti, the primary site of the films epic climactic battle, and locales in\n\nPoland and Slovenia.\n\nTHE RETURN TO NARNIA: THE STORY OF PRINCE CASPIAN\n\nThe enchanting characters of C.S. Lewis timeless fantasy come to dazzling life again in\n\nTHE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN. This time out, the Pevensie\n\nsiblingsPeter, Susan, Edmund and\n\nLucyare magically transported from\n\nWorld War II-era England to Narnia\n\nthrough a tube station near Londons\n\nTrafalgar Square, embarking on a perilous\n\nnew adventure and an even greater test of\n\ntheir faith and courage.\n\nOne year after the incredible events of\n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\n\nthe former kings and queens of Narnia\n\nfind themselves back in that faraway\n\nrealm, only to discover that more than 1,300 years have passed in Narnian time. During their\n\nabsence, the Golden Age of Narnia has faded into legend. The lands magical talking animals\n\nand mythical creatures exist as little more than folktales to the Telmarines, a race of humans\n\nled by the merciless Lord Miraz. The mighty lion Aslan has not been seen in 1,000 years.\n\nThe four children have been summoned back to Narnia by Caspian, the young heir to the\n\nTelmarine throne, to combat his evil\n\nuncle, Miraz. With the help of a crusty,\n\nvaliant dwarf (Trumpkin), a courageous\n\ntalking mouse named Reepicheep and a\n\nmistrustful Black Dwarf (Nikabrik), they\n\nlead the Narnians on a remarkable\n\njourney to restore magic and glory to the\n\nland.\n\nPrince Caspian is the second of Lewis\n\nseven-book Chronicles of Narnia series,\n\nwhich includes The Voyage of the Dawn\n\nTreader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and His Boy, The Magicians Nephew, The Last Battle\n\nand the story that launched the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Published\n\nbetween 1950 and 1956 and long regarded as one of literatures most enduring and imaginative\n\nclassics, Lewis books have sold over 100,000,000 copies in more than 35 languages, making\n\nit one of the biggest book series the world over.\n\nAs the creative and artistic director of Lewis estate and the C.S. Lewis Company, Douglas\n\n22\n\nGresham (the son of Lewis wife, Joy\n\nDavidman Gresham, and her first\n\nhusband, novelist William Lindsay\n\nGresham) worked for over 20 years to\n\nbring Lewis books to the big screen.\n\nFollowing the resounding success of The\n\nLion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\n\nGresham is embarking on what he calls\n\nthe second chapter in a lifelong dream.\n\nI watched that dream come true when\n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n\nexploded onto movie screens around the world in 2005, Gresham exclaims. I always\n\nexpected the movie to be a delight and a joy to world audiences, but I have been somewhat\n\nhumbled by its level of success.\n\nProducer Mark Johnson believes the second film has surpassed the original in many\n\nrespects. This movie is bigger than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, he says. Its\n\nbigger in terms of the number of people behind the camera. Its bigger in terms of the number\n\nof people in front of the camera and, most importantly, its bigger dramatically. The themes\n\nthat were playing out here, and the relationships, are much bigger and a bit darker than they\n\nwere in the first film.\n\nDirector Adamson explains: PRINCE CASPIAN tells the story of Narnia 1,300 years after\n\nthe Pevensies left. The Telmarines have taken over Narnia and driven all the creatures into the\n\nforest. Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the throne, has been ousted by his uncle, Miraz.\n\nCaspian blows Susans horn to bring the Pevensie children back to Narnia to save the land\n\nfrom Miraz, this unrightful king.\n\nThe story reminds Johnson of the films\n\nhe loved as a kid. It harkens back to some\n\nof those movies that were full of adventure\n\nand swashbuckling and brave characters.\n\nWe even have a castle and a moat! On top\n\nof that, it takes place in Narnia, so it\n\ninvolves C.S. Lewis imagination.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which\n\ndeliberately started small and built to the\n\nepic battle scene, PRINCE CASPIAN\n\nstarts big and gets even bigger. Weve seen that epic world now, notes Adamson. So, at the\n\nbeginning of this movie, we had to start epic and then get more epic. We had a lot more\n\nexterior locations. We had castles and kingdoms created by a new race of men, the Telmarines.\n\nSo there was this whole new world to design. Also, this film is probably a little darker and\n\ngrittier than the last one, partly because the children are older, making the story more adult\n\nin nature.\n\nIn the last film, I think we went to some pretty dark places, he adds. Aslans death,\n\ncertainly, is one of the darkest moments in the film. I think this movie has the potential to be\n\neven more sinister. Miraz is potentially someone that we might actually see in real life, which\n\nmakes him and the story that much darker.\n\nTHE RETURN TO NARNIA\n\n23\n\nCHARACTERS OLD AND NEW\n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the\n\nWardrobe is a very emotional story about\n\nsacrifice and forgiveness, Adamson says.\n\nIn some ways, this is a more personal\n\nstory, a story of these kids returning to a\n\nplace that they love but that no longer\n\nexists. This is more about coming to\n\nadulthood, about growth and adventure.\n\nThat idea resonated with the director\n\non a personal level. Although born in New\n\nZealand, Adamson spent his formative\n\nteen years in Papua New Guinea, which no longer exists as I remember it growing up. For\n\nme, its a similar experience for these four children as they venture back to Narnia, a world\n\nthat is not the same as when they first went there.\n\nWhen I read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe as a child, I remember getting to the\n\nend of it and thinking, Well, hang on a sec, Adamson recalls. These guys were kings and\n\nqueens. They ruled Narnia for 15 years. They fought battles. They won wars against giants and\n\nnow they have to go back to school? I wanted to see what happened next.\n\nPRINCE CASPIAN is a completely different story from The Lion, the Witch and the\n\nWardrobe, producer Johnson explains. The children have adjusted to a varying degree to\n\nbeing British school kids again. All of a sudden, theyre brought back to Narnia because they\n\nare needed to help save the land once again.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS OF PRINCE CASPIANOLD AND NEW\n\nIts a wonderfully nostalgic story, adds Adamson. Basically, the children have come back\n\nto a place that theyve longed to be, the place they ruled for 15 years. Everything has changed.\n\nCair Paravel is in ruins. The people they know have been driven into the wild. Aslan hasnt\n\nbeen seen for 1,000 years. Theyve got to come to terms with that, and at the same time, try\n\nto restore Narnia as they know it.\n\nThat theme intrigued the screenwriters\n\nas well. Its an area Lewis left mostly\n\nuntouched, offers screenwriter Markus.\n\nLewis memorably examined what it\n\nwould be like for a 1940s school kid to\n\nbecome King of Narnia. However, he\n\ndidnt much consider what it would be\n\nlike for a King of Narnia to return to\n\nbeing a 1940s school kid.\n\nTheir year back in London must have\n\nbeen awkward at best, adds writing partner McFeely. Given their different personalities,\n\neach Pevensie handles the situation with varying levels of success. Their sudden return to\n\nNarnia pushes different buttons in each.\n\nAnd, how do the experiences of the four young British actors compare to what their screen\n\ncounterparts encountered in the new story?\n\n24\n\nThe eldest of the foursome, 21-yearold\n\nWilliam Moseley, says his anticipation\n\nand anxiety to get back in front of the\n\nmovie cameras echoed what his character\n\nPeter endured in the time between his 15year\n\nreign of Narnia and his return to the\n\nkingdom in the new story. Just like his\n\ncharacter, the handsome British native\n\nreturned to secondary school.\n\nFinishing the first film was an\n\namazing experience, he says. Then it\n\nwas all taken away. Even though I didnt react the same way Peter does, I can really understand\n\nhow he feels.\n\nOnce the senior sibling returns to Narnia, he becomes slightly arrogant, the actor notes\n\nof his character. Theres fighting within the group. Peter cannot accept Caspian. His plans are\n\nnot set from his heart, but from his ego. Even when he doubts himself, he still is too stubborn\n\nto back down and accept that he might be wrong. And ultimately, he pays the highest price.\n\nIn the process, Moseley says, his character becomes a man. When he gets back to Narnia,\n\nits 1,300 years later and people dont know hes a high king. They just see a boy. Peter has to\n\nprove who he is to the Narnians.\n\nWhen we cast William as Peter, he was just 15 and had never done anything like this\n\nbefore, Adamson notes. Williams transformation was not dissimilar to that of his character,\n\nPeter, in the story, from this 17-year-old boy into a young man. I dont think hed even been\n\non a movie set before. He was just this really great kid you wanted to be your big brother. And\n\nnow, William has turned out to be a handsome and capable young man.\n\nAdds co-star Anna Popplewell, Although William is 21, hes playing a 16- or 17-year-old.\n\nBut hes an adult now. I had my first audition with him when I was 13. And we really have sort\n\nof grown up together. Everyone has grown up a little bit, and changed a little bit, she\n\nobserves.\n\nHowever, Popplewell did notice how the character of Susan had changed when she read\n\nthrough the script. Susan gets to be involved in a bit more action this time, the actress\n\nenthuses. I loved doing the fighting scenes. I loved being in the raid and the battle and getting\n\nmy teeth into some of the stunts. I didnt get to do much of that in the first movie.\n\nThe film marks the end of Narnias road for the eldest Pevensies, Susan and Peter.\n\nPopplewell admits, I feel incredibly lucky to have had this experience, a fantastic time. And\n\nId so much rather have been here than not been here. But, at the same time, its really sad that\n\nI wont be coming back.\n\nAfter finishing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Popplewell concentrated on her\n\nsecondary school studies and landed a coveted spot at Oxfords Magdalen College, the same\n\nschool where author C.S. Lewis served a three-decade tenure from 1925-54, although she did\n\nnot know of Lewis longtime connection to the college until she read a biography of the famed\n\nauthor.\n\nCo-star Georgie Henley has grown into a bright and studious 12-year-old who has written\n\ntwo of her own stories, The Snow Stag and A Pillar of Secrets.\n\nAbout Lewis imaginary world, its story and its characters, Henley says, Theyre just\n\n25\n\nCHARACTERS OLD AND NEW\n\nCHARACTERS OLD AND NEW CHARACTERS OLD AND NEW\n\nbrilliant because of the way C.S. Lewis\n\nwrote them. He didnt put too much\n\ndescription in, so Narnia is almost our\n\ncomplete imagination. We can interpret it\n\nhowever we like. I think that most people\n\nhave their own interpretation of these\n\nbooks and these characters.\n\nHenley acknowledges two changes in\n\nher character in the second film. In the\n\nlast film, I was sweet little Lucy, and now\n\nIm a bit more actiony, which was quite\n\nfun, she says, adding that she spent time learning to ride a horse and wield a dagger for her\n\nrole. Also, Lucy stands up for what she believes in more than in the last filmher faith in\n\nAslan. Shes braver and she has her own view about what she thinks is right. She sees Aslan\n\nbefore her siblings do, which I think shows Lucys trust in Aslan more than the others.\n\nProducer Mark Johnson describes Lucy Pevensies dilemma as a fundamental question of\n\nfaith. Shes asking, Who am I? What is the right thing to do? Her conscience dictated a lot\n\nof what she did on the last film. In this one, its put to some pretty severe tests.\n\nSkandar Keynes, who plays Edmund, was 12 when he started shooting the first movie. By\n\nthe end of PRINCE CASPIAN, he had turned 16. Despite his being five years younger than\n\nhis co-star Moseley, Keynes sees his character as taking the role of the older brother in his\n\nrelationship with the elder sibling Peter this time out.\n\nEdmund is always looking out for Peter, says the young actor. He always helps him, but\n\nnever gets the credit he deserves and that gets to him a bit. Its one of the recurring themes\n\nhow Edmunds always helping Peter out. You know, there was even a day on the call sheet\n\nwhere the scene description was Edmund\n\nsaves the day. I didnt let anyone forget it.\n\nI walked around with a call sheet in my\n\nhands all day saying, Edmund saves the\n\nday. That was really cool.\n\nCo-star Moseley believes moviegoers\n\nwill see the Pevensies in a new light in\n\nPRINCE CASPIAN. Peter and Susan\n\nespecially. These two had challenges in\n\nthe first film, but nothing on this level. I\n\nthink audiences will be surprised and\n\nengaged by both the physical battles and the emotional battles endured by our characters.\n\nTheyve all grown up really well, director Adamson says, sounding like a proud parent of\n\nthe young actors portraying the Pevensie clan. A large reason for me to do this again was\n\nworking with the same children. There is this wonderful relationship between the kids, how\n\nthey became a family and how they let us become a part of that family. Theres change in very\n\npositive ways in growing up, but Id like to say the movie didnt change who they are, which\n\nIm really happy about.\n\n26\n\nTHE NEW CHARACTERS\n\nThe characters battling for control of the vastly altered Narnia are played by two new faces\n\non the Hollywood movie scenethe young, charismatic British stage actor Ben Barnes as the\n\nfilms title character and seasoned Italian movie star Sergio Castellitto, who embodies pure\n\nevil as King Miraz.\n\nBarnes was no stranger to the C.S. Lewis literary series. I was a massive Narnia fan as a\n\nkid, Barnes exclaims with the exuberance of an eight-year-old boy delving into the novels for\n\nthe first time. I definitely remember the books being a big part of my childhood. When I found\n\nout I got the part, I looked through my bookshelves and found this copy of Prince Caspian with\n\na 1989 copyright, when I\n\nwas eight.\n\nWe took a long time to\n\nfind Ben and saw many\n\nactors for this role,\n\nJohnson says. We needed\n\na young man who could\n\nbe heroic, but who also\n\nhad something in his\n\npersonality that reflected what the character learns through the journey in this film.\n\nEnglish casting veteran Gail Stevens had an assistant who had seen Barnes in the recent\n\nWest End staging of the award-winning drama The History Boys. When she contacted his\n\nagent, the actor taped an audition reading for Adamson.\n\nThat video introduction led to a personal audition where the director crowned him the star\n\nof his new movie. When we finally met Ben in person, we found him charming and fun and\n\ncomfortable. He won us over, Adamson recalls. You could see from his effort and\n\nenthusiasm how much he wanted the role. I admired his work ethic.\n\nBarnes whirlwind adventure began almost immediately. Costume fittings, horseback-\n\nriding practice, dialect lessons, fencing and stunt rehearsals consumed his early days and\n\nweeks on location in New Zealand.\n\nIn addition to immersing himself in the\n\nrole, he also had to find a place for\n\nhimself in a tight-knit film family. All\n\nfour Pevensies were anxious to meet\n\nBarnes and see how he would fit in when\n\nhe first arrived in New Zealand.\n\nHe became an honorary Pevensie,\n\njokes Keynes. And the fact that he was\n\n25 when we made the movie made\n\neveryone else act a bit more mature.\n\nBen had a lot to live up to before wed\n\neven met him, says Popplewell. Especially for William and me, because we knew that we\n\nwere not in the next story. We were, in a sense, passing the films onto someone whom we\n\nreally liked. He had that something that we very much connected with.\n\nBefore he meets the Pevensies in Narnia, Caspian is rallying support among the Narnians\n\nTHE NEW CHARACTERS\n\n27\n\nTHE NEW CHARACTERS\n\nfor a campaign against his own people, the Telmarines. Theyre trying to kill him, Barnes\n\nexplains. I blow the magic horn and summon the Pevensies back to Narnia. Peter, as the High\n\nKing, rightfully assumes that hes in charge. We both have different ideas about how we should\n\ngo about defeating my evil uncle, which leads to this conflict between us.\n\nEven though the story takes place in a fantasy world, you have to play every moment as\n\ntruth, says Barnes. I hope those moments translate into something that the audience can\n\nreally become involved with. If so, they will get behind Caspian and see him through from the\n\nbeginning to the end of his journey.\n\nThe adult characters are much more scary in this film, says Moseley. The White Witch\n\nwas scary, but youve seen nothing until youve seen Miraz. I fought both of them one-on-one,\n\nand Miraz took my breath away. It was really interesting watching Sergio change into Miraz.\n\nHe takes on a whole new persona!\n\nDuring the casting process for the evil Miraz, the filmmakers were immediately intrigued\n\nwith Castellitto. Sergio is one of the most accomplished and well-regarded European actors\n\naround today, says producer Johnson about his screen villain. As soon as we saw his audition\n\ntape, we said, Lets explore this further.\n\nCastellittos lengthy acting resume includes some of Italys best-known movies over the last\n\nquarter century. He is well known for roles in Luc Bessons The Big Blue and Best Foreign\n\nFilm Oscar® nominees from Italy such as La Familia and LUomo delle stele.\n\nI have a lot of admiration for Andrew Adamson because he pays attention to the\n\npsychological aspect of the performance and character, Castellitto says. We spoke about the\n\ncharacter as a human being. We spoke about the battle between youth and age. The good and\n\nevil is evident in that dichotomy between Miraz and Caspian.\n\nOnce actor and director had established Mirazs psychological profile, they next turned to\n\nhis physicality. The physical look of the\n\nfilms human cast fell to a team of\n\nmakeup magicians led by two-time\n\nAcademy Award® nominee Paul Engelen\n\n(Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan,\n\nLord of the Apes, Casino Royale) and\n\nhair designer Kevin Alexander (Casino\n\nRoyale).\n\nEngelen, a 40-year industry veteran\n\nwith one of his crafts best professional\n\nresumes, in collaboration with Adamson,\n\ncreated a Mediterranean look for the Telmarine characters. The longtime makeup artist felt\n\nimmediately that Miraz should have some kind of beard. The character of Miraz demanded\n\nthat he be very forceful and intimidating for the part to succeed, and I very soon arrived at the\n\ntriangular design we decided to use, Engelen says. I enlarged the chin area with an extension\n\npiece. With the addition of extended eyebrows, some darker color in and around the eyes, and\n\nthe characters trademark earring, we ended up with a good character look for Sergio.\n\nAdd to this a wardrobe that costumer Mussenden describes as a bit pirate, barbaric in\n\ncharacter, but sophisticated in style and all inspired by images of 15th-century Spanish soldiers,\n\nplus Wetas magnificent armor and weapons, and Miraz came to vivid and terrifying life.\n\n28\n\nTHE CREATURES\n\nHoward Berger and his award-winning makeup magicians had been waiting two years to\n\nreturn to Narnia. We were chomping at the bit to go back for the next film and get a chance\n\nto revisit all the Narnian inhabitants we helped create for the first film, Berger says.\n\nBerger was eager to create the new,\n\nwilder look of the creatures of Narnia,\n\nwho have been living in hiding for\n\ncenturies when the film begins. In\n\nPRINCE CASPIAN, we had heavyset\n\nfauns, old-age fauns, female dwarves,\n\nAfrican-Narnian centaurs and their\n\nfamilies. The minotaurs are now on the\n\nside of good. We have a new hag, a\n\nwerewolf and the satyrs are back, but all\n\nredesigned to be more animal-like.\n\nThe task would require a large staff of experts ranging from concept artists to creature-suit\n\nfabricators, from hair designers to latex-piece manufacturers. We estimated close to 3,000\n\nmakeups on the film, which would keep the foam department busy almost 24/7 for the next\n\nnine months. We ended up applying 4,600 makeups by the end of the shoot, which is, I believe,\n\na world record, Berger reports.\n\nBerger and a team of more than 40 special makeup artists gave birth to the films more\n\nfantastical creatures. My favorite Narnians are the dwarves, Berger says. We had two\n\nfantastic dwarf characters in the film: Trumpkin, played by Peter Dinklage, and Nikabrik,\n\nplayed by Warwick Davis. We designed some very intricate makeup applications to transform\n\nthem into Narnians.\n\nWhen the role of Trumpkin was being conceived, director Adamson knew that Dinklage\n\nwas his first choice to play the role. I knew when I saw The Station Agent that I wanted to\n\ncast him, the filmmaker says.\n\nHes the first actor we cast for this movie, exclaims Johnson about Dinklage. Hes just\n\nphenomenal.\n\nOnce signed on, Dinklage turned to the bookswhich he did not read as a youthfor\n\nresearch and inspiration. He describes his character as curmudgeonly but adds too much\n\nof that and youre not going to want to spend time with him on the journey. Lets just say that\n\nthe Pevensies annoy him, and hed rather have a glass of wine back in his tree.\n\nBefore agreeing to take the role, Dinklage caught a glimpse of what Trumpkin might look\n\nlike when he visited with Adamson in Los Angeles for an introductory meeting. The\n\nfilmmaker showed Dinklage some of the pre-visualization materials, some computer\n\nanimation of what appeared to be these big battle sequences, the actor remembers.\n\nI sat there in this room filled with computers and watched as my likeness came up in these\n\ncomputer images, he continues. I had never seen anything like that before. It was weird,\n\nreally, but I felt like I couldnt say no at that point.\n\nEven with this unexpected peek at Trumpkins appearance, Dinklage had no notion as to\n\nwhat Berger and his team would devise to transform the blue-eyed actor into a vivid Narnian\n\ncreature. Berger and Tami Lane, who both earned Oscars® for the first movie, rendered him\n\nTHE CREATURES\n\n29\n\nTHE CREATURES\n\nunrecognizable, except for his piercing eyes.\n\nWorking from a concept painting of what Berger envisioned for the character, Lane began\n\nthe daily two-and-a-half-hour transformation by shaving Dinklages head completely and\n\npainting it. She dyed his eyebrows before gluing on latex face pieces. Finally, the makeup\n\nartist tacked on the intricate hair work that turned Dinklage into a fantastical, otherworldly\n\ncreature.\n\nThe last thing was a really long, red beard and wig made of yak hair, Dinklage says. And\n\nsomewhere theres a yak on top of a mountain whos very cold. And Im sorry. However,\n\nbecause we filmed in the summer in Prague, it was not the coolest of makeups for me.\n\nWith a lot of makeups, you can lose the actor underneath them, the actor continues.\n\nHoward and Tami really managed to make me look completely different and still allowed my\n\nexpressions, my emotions, to come through.\n\nPeter brought so much life to the character, says Berger. I always say that a makeup is\n\nhalf successful if we do our jobs right. That, plus the performance, made Trumpkin truly alive\n\nand believable. We gave Trumpkin his look. Peter gave him his heart.\n\nWhile Lane concentrated her daily efforts on actor Dinklage, fellow makeup artist Sarah\n\nRubano won the assignment to metamorphose Warwick Davis into a character the actor\n\nhimself calls sour inside.\n\nHowards makeup was loads of help for me in understanding the character, says Davis.\n\nThen you find the characters voice. Then Isis costume, which was such an immaculate piece\n\nof workmanship while the detail may not come across for audiences, subliminally, its all\n\nthere. As an actor, it makes you feel so at home in the character. I lived, worked and fought in\n\nthose clothes. You are then placed in the surroundings, the sets, and magically, you are in\n\nNarnia.\n\nWarwick is an actor who has been able to imbue all of his characters with something\n\ndifferent, notes producer Johnson.\n\nThats what I prize most in an actor\n\nsurprises. I think his Nikabrik character is\n\nvery surprising because he is irascible, yet\n\nspeaks real logic. Nikabrik has really paid\n\nfor the fact that Narnia has been under the\n\nthumb of the Telmarines. So he has some\n\nreal surprises as a character up his\n\nsleeve.\n\nDavis was intrigued by a clever\n\nillustration of the character done by one\n\nof Bergers associates at KNB, John Wheaton. It was brilliant, because it was me, but as an\n\nold man. It was my photograph over which he painted the character concept. It captured\n\nNikabrik perfectly.\n\nWhen Davis looked in the mirror after the marathon session, What I saw was the character\n\nin three dimensions that Howards artist had portrayed in two dimensions, the actor notes. It\n\nwas astounding.\n\nAnother daily visitor to Bergers trailer camp was English musical-theater star Cornell S.\n\nJohn, who plays Glenstorm, the powerful Afro-Narnian centaur who aids Prince Caspian and\n\nthe Pevensies in their fight against Miraz.\n\n30\n\nFor Glenstorm, Andrew wanted a tall and imposing actor of African descent, casting\n\ndirector Stevens remembers. Glenstorm is a wise, spiritual character who is also a great\n\nwarrior, so he needed to move with grace and dignity. We did a global search that went as far\n\nafield as Africa and found Cornell in London. We had known and admired him in many\n\nleading roles in musical theater and opera, from The Lion King to Porgy and Bess.\n\nJohn endured a lengthy makeup process that transformed the actor into one of mythologys\n\nquintessential creatures, the centaurhalf man and half horse. Latex face appliances\n\ncombined with green-screen tights over which the VFX magicians superimposed the body and\n\nlegs of a horse turned the soft-spoken actor into one of the films most imposing creations.\n\nIm 160-percent Mike Fields, the guy who did my makeup, John states. In the\n\nbeginning, I had no idea what I should look like. I was hoping for something that expressed\n\nhonor, pride and tradition. Because centaurs can live for hundreds of years, theres no age limit\n\non this. I put myself at 170 Earth years. This face of Glenstorm is the face of time.\n\nAnd, as they did on the first film, KNB created life-sized animatronic puppets and suits for\n\nthe CGI character of Aslan for use on the set during filming.\n\nAndrew wanted him to be 15 percent larger, says Berger. We were able to utilize the\n\ndigital scanning information from the first film and have Cyber FX mill out a new sculpture\n\n15 percent larger than the first. We ended up with a very large lion in the shop.\n\nThe face of Reepicheep, the swashbuckling mouse, did not come from the brush of one of\n\nBergers talented artists. Instead, the rodent was born from the strokes of a keyboard mouse,\n\nthrough computer software under the control of VFX co-supervisor Wendy Rogers.\n\nI grew up on the Narnia books and Reepicheep was definitely one of my favorite\n\ncharacters, director Adamson says of the gallant, honorable and noble mouse who wields a\n\ntiny little rapier, in author Lewis description of the character. He was ingrained in my\n\nimagination. The trick here was finding the right voice. He was difficult to find, but we finally\n\ncast Eddie Izzard for the part.\n\nThe filmmakers auditioned over 100 voices to find the right actor to bring the character to\n\nlife, says producer Mark Johnson. Eddie Izzards voice came closest to the seriousness of the\n\ncharacter and yet didnt in any way repel us or not let us have immediate affection for\n\nReepicheep.\n\nOnce the filmmakers chose Izzard, Rogers focused on physicalizing the character.\n\nReepicheep is a big mouse, some 22 inches tall, Rogers explains. That will take some\n\nsuspension of disbelief. At that size, we still have to make him feel like hes a mouse. We have\n\nto find the correct balance between anthropomorphizing Reepicheep and maintaining the fact\n\nthat he is a real animala mouse.\n\nThe voice actor plays such a big part in defining the character, Rogers continues. Its not\n\nthe fact that the animated character resembles the actor playing him. The actor may do some\n\nmannerisms or a physical flourish, like wave a sword. We have lipstick cams at these recording\n\nsessions to capture that. That helps our exploration of who the character is.\n\nOf all the Narnian characters London-based visual effects house The Moving Picture\n\nCompany (MPC) had to create for PRINCE CASPIAN, Reepicheep was the one requiring the\n\nmost art direction and overall attention to detail, says MPCs Greg Butler. One of the first\n\nchallenges was that a very big mouse would be hard to keep looking mousey. We wanted to\n\nmake sure Reepicheep didnt end up looking like a rat. We also had to work out an anatomy\n\nthat was based on a mouse, but still allowed him to sword-fight, wear armor and walk on two\n\nTHE CREATURES\n\n31\n\nRECREATING NARNIA\n\nas well as four legs.\n\nThis story is Reepicheeps introduction, says Adamson. Dawn Treader will be his story.\n\nWhat weve done is establish him for the next Narnia adventure. I didnt really get to exploit\n\nhim like so many other characters. But he is so worthwhile and interesting.\n\nTHE PRODUCTION: RECREATING NARNIA\n\nC.S. Lewis began Prince Caspian with the following passage:\n\nOnce there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy,\n\nand it has been told in another book called The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n\nhow they had a remarkable adventure.\n\nThe second remarkable journey for Adamson and his team of artisans and actors (which\n\nnumbered about 2,000 by the time filming ended) began while the first project was still in\n\npost-production. While screenwriters\n\nMarkus and McFeely toiled on the script,\n\npre-visualization artist Rpin Suwannath\n\ncoordinated a staff of 12 artists and\n\nstarted visualizing the movie in a\n\ncomputer.\n\nPre-visualization is the process of\n\ncreating computer-generated animatics\n\nthat serve as a creative, technical and\n\nuseful tool for budgeting the movie and\n\nlet Andrew visualize his scenes months\n\nbefore he shoots them, explains Suwannath, who oversaw the same responsibilities on the\n\nfirst movie.\n\nThe process was vital to Adamsons ability to mount a film of this magnitude. It helps you\n\nsee pieces of the puzzle that arent there on the day you direct these huge scenes, the director\n\nsays. I cant imagine not using pre-vis for a movie like this.\n\nWhile Suwannath and his team began to visualize the world of Narnia inside their\n\ncomputers, the filmmakers began their lengthy, global search to find locations that would\n\nevoke a vastly different realm than the winter landscape depicted in The Lion, the Witch and\n\nthe Wardrobe.\n\nNarnia doesnt exist, says Mark Johnson. Except in C.S. Lewis imagination. And in\n\nAndrew Adamsons vision. In putting together this physical Narnia, we had location scouts all\n\nover the world for almost a year before filming began, trying to find places we could use to\n\nportray Narnia.\n\nJames Crowley, who served as location manager on the first film, along with a team of\n\nregional scouts, went to 20 countries, spanning six continents.\n\nThere was a predetermined feeling about New Zealand, Crowley says. Europe was also\n\ndiscussed, but not where specifically. Part of this was due to the seasons. For this story, we\n\nneeded an endless summer, so the seasons and the hemisphere played a huge factor in\n\ndetermining the final locations for the movie.\n\nThe filmmakers ultimately chose to shoot in the Czech Republic (including Prague, Usti\n\n32\n\nand the Brdo region near Dobris), Poland (Stolowe National Park near Kudowa-Zdrój; the\n\nKamiencyka Gorge in Szklarska Poreba), Slovenia (the River Soca in Bovec near the countrys\n\nonly national park, Triglavski Narodni Park) and New Zealand.\n\nThe thing that New Zealand offers that a lot of places dont is a proliferation of old-growth\n\nforests, Adamson says, explaining what drew him back to his native country. Theres not an\n\narea of Europe that hasnt been felled and regrown at some point, so finding an old-growth\n\nforest is very difficult. In New Zealand, the whole west coast of the South Island is covered\n\nwith ancient forests.\n\nShooting began at two breathtaking sites on the Coromandel Peninsulas Mercury Bay,\n\nwhich served as the settings for scenes in which the Pevensie children take their first steps\n\nback into Narnia: Cathedral Cove, a spectacular beach on the eastern shore of the peninsula,\n\nand a majestic bluff rising several hundred feet above the ocean where the siblings discover\n\nthe ruins of Cair Paravel.\n\nThe company then departed for the countrys South Island, a magical place offering some\n\nof the planets most glorious scenery. Three sites were chosen for the two-week trip south. The\n\nfirst two, spectacular rivers in the countrys South Westland area have been given aliases to\n\nprevent them from being overrun by touriststhe Westland River, a scenic site which\n\ndramatically empties out to the Tasman Sea, and Glasswater River.\n\nThis second locale is defined by a dramatic river chasm bookended by cascading waterfalls\n\nthat plunge 200 feet into the glassy waters. The water shimmered so clearly, actress Popplewell\n\nsays, Audiences wont believe its real water because it appears to be an optical illusion\n\ncreated by VFX in post-production.\n\nThe third South Island site chosen for filming was Paradise, a privately owned horse ranch\n\nabout an hours drive from Queenstown. There were a couple of locations that were perfect\n\nfor this movie that only New Zealand could offer, says Johnson. In many ways, it is a\n\nfairytale country with the kind of locations that make your jaw drop. New Zealand gave us the\n\nmagic of Narnia.\n\nAfter a ten-day break in production to relocate scores of crew members and the film\n\nequipment literally halfway around the world, PRINCE CASPIAN resumed filming in Prague,\n\nalso known as the City of 100 Spires because of the plethora of church and castle towers\n\nthat dot its skyline.\n\nPrague is a popular place for film\n\nshoots, says Johnson, for a number of\n\nreasons. They have very good film crews;\n\nall the necessary equipment and\n\nsoundstages are available here; and its a\n\nrelatively inexpensive place to shoot,\n\nwhich is a real factor these days.\n\nThe location was also an advantage for\n\nthe cast. It was really difficult on the\n\nchildren and their families to spend six or\n\nseven months in New Zealand on the last film, he says. From central Europe, they could be\n\nback home in England in a couple of hours. That was really important for them.\n\nThe capital of the Czech Republic doubled for World War II England with the collective\n\nhelp of the art department, costumes and transportation. The road in front of the Praha\n\nRECREATING NARNIA\n\n33\n\nRECREATING NARNIA\n\nRudolfinum, one of the citys grand\n\nconcert halls, was transformed into\n\nTrafalgar Square circa 1941, with a bit of\n\nhelp from VFX supervisor Wright, who\n\nrotoscoped in footage from that era.\n\nPrague is also the home of legendary\n\nBarrandov Studios, which has attracted\n\nplenty of large-scale productions over the\n\nlast decade, of which this film is\n\nreportedly the biggest. Since its\n\nbeginnings in 1931, Barrandov has\n\nlaunched the careers of cinema giants including Milos Forman, Jirí Menzel and the late Ján\n\nKadár. In recent years, Hollywood has brought in productions including Casino Royale,\n\nThe Brothers Grimm and The Bourne Identity, as well as The Lion, the Witch and the\n\nWardrobe.\n\nThe studios are large enough to house a small forest. In fact, Barrandovs brand-new Max\n\nStage 8 became C.S. Lewis Dancing Lawn, an indoor forest complete with a sophisticated\n\nsprinkling system to feed the living set. Dancing Lawn is a place so deep in the forest that\n\nthe Telmarines have never found it, production designer Roger Ford explains. In the book,\n\nits a place where the fauns and other Narnian creatures go to dance in the night. In the film,\n\nits the place the Narnians gather to plan their campaign with Caspian.\n\nThe designer used Lewis scant descriptive phrases as the inspiration for his vivid\n\ninterpretations of the films settings. He did not take his obligations lightly, understanding that\n\nhis interpretations would be closely scrutinized by fans.\n\nFords signature set piece was the mammoth castle courtyard built on the studios backlot.\n\nThe set, which he calls a character in the story, began with Lewis simple phrase: Caspian\n\nlived in a great castle  Six stories high, the castle shoots some 200 feet into the sky,\n\ncourtesy of VFX augmentation, and contains more than 20,000 square feet of interior space.\n\nThe magnificent design took 200 carpenters, painters, sculptors and other craftspeople 15\n\nweeks to build.\n\nTwo symbols were chosen to emphasize that the Telmarines are warlike, and not a very\n\nnice bunch of chaps, according to Ford. Much of the Telmarine world is adorned with the\n\nhead of an eagle, which embellishes not only the castle courtyard on the backlot and the\n\ncrossbows used by the Telmarines, but the arms of the various thrones scattered throughout\n\nMirazs Great Hall.\n\nIn addition, Ford was inspired by the Telmarines origins as a pirate culture to use the\n\ncompass on the soldiers shields in the architecture of the Great Hall and in the banners\n\nfabricated for each of the 21 lords under Mirazs rule.\n\nEqually impressive in scope and detail are the ruins of the Stone Table in the How, where\n\nAslan the Lion was sacrificed in the first story. The crypt-like, circular structure was carved\n\nout of plaster and polystyrene, with pillars reaching dozens of feet towards the stages towering\n\nceiling. It contains a series of detailed plaster carvings that depict the history of the Narnians\n\nover the past 1,300 years.\n\nThe How was such an important storytelling piece because of the Stone Table, explains\n\nsupervising art director Frank Walsh. We had to develop and tell the story of what happened\n\n34\n\nduring those missing hundreds of years. These carved stone panels are all very important\n\nimages.\n\nAdamson came up with the idea of a channel or trough around the How directly beneath\n\nthe wall carvings, Ford says. It is a well of oil that Caspian lights with a torch. The flames\n\nencircle the room, lighting up the panels.\n\nWe couldnt use real oil or burning liquid because its hard to control, explains\n\nmechanical effects supervisor and designer Gerd Feuchter. We had to create a special\n\npropane burner which we then placed underneath a level of colored water. The grid of\n\npropane valves sat underwater in the circular trough, which baffled set visitors, who had no\n\nidea that propane could burn underwater.\n\nFords crew spent over two months in the Bovec region of Slovenia erecting a massive\n\nbridge over the River Soca and its tributary Gljun for the setting of what may be the most\n\nmemorable moment in the film, the River God sequence.\n\nIn the book, the Bridge at Beruna is built by the Telmarines hundreds of years earlier, says\n\nthe designer. When the Narnians are finally victorious, Aslan calls on the River God to\n\ndestroy the bridge and free the river.\n\nIndustrial engineers were called in to reroute the rivers flow to accommodate Fords set\n\ndesigns for the scene. The films bridge was constructed out of oversized pine logs lashed\n\ntogether with massive ropes. It had to be a practical bridge that could hold 200 soldiers (and\n\ndozens of crew members and heavy equipment) charging across it. It was really quite\n\nextraordinary, Ford says, referring to the engineering and the machinery involved.\n\nIt required a real piece of civil engineeri"
