        "text": "Throughout the silent film era, two actresses stood at the very top of the movie tree – Mary Pickford and Mabel Normand. Two totally different personalities, the pair were friends from the very early days at Biograph studios, although they eventually drifted apart, even though they never lived more than a mile from each other. Mabel maintained her friends right the way through, but Mary whittled down her friends to a small group. Mabel was not on that list, and, after 1920, they only met by sheer chance. Something had happened, but what? Some people like to think that they were enemies by profession i.e. they fought a battle for supremacy in Hollywood, and those that think this, cite a drunken statement by Mabel that Mary was a “prissy bitch”. The fact is that you can call your friend a prissy bitch, but she is still your friend. Strangely enough, Mary knew she presented as excessively respectable, but could not really change that.\n\nIt is fairly well-known that Mary Pickford and Mabel Normand began in pictures at the Biograph Studio on 11 East Fourteenth Street, New York. Mary preceded Mabel at Biograph by something over a year, and she had formerly been a stage artist of some note. It was Mama Pickford’s fear for the future that prompted her to put her Goldilocksian daughter into films. Life was tough on the road, and Mama was not getting any younger. She realised that if she got sick, the whole of her young family would be imperilled, and for this reason Mrs Smith, for that was her real name, sent young Mary (or Gladys) to get employment with the genius of film, D.W. Griffith. Mabel had been aware of Mary, as her father sometimes took her to the theatre in Manhattan (her mother was the stay at home, religious type and rarely left her house on Staten Island). Mabel of course was a well-known model for artists like Flagg and Gibson, and Mary loved to see her pictures on the covers of magazines.\n\nIt was with some surprise, then, that one day Mary saw the apparition of Mabel sitting in the dressing room, where she had been placed by Wilfred Lucas (or The Great Lucas as Mabel later called him) to await an audience with the genius. The astute Mary instantly recognised that Mabel was just the kind of girl that the studio needed. In a studio full of blonds, platinum blonds, and half-blonds, Mabel stood out, and could fulfil roles that the innocent-looking fair-haired maids could not. Grabbing Mr. Griffith, she virtually dragged him to the dressing room, telling him that the girl of the century was sitting in the studio, and she had dark lustrous hair, big dark eyes and eyelashes two-inches long. Well, seeing was believing, and Griffith hired her on the spot. Thus, it was, that Mary Pickford discovered Mabel Normand – and she never received a red cent for it.\n\nLife in The Madhouse.\n\nThe Biograph studio was a crazy place, full of crazy people. There were, at any one time, something approaching a hundred performers and extras in that four-storey brownstone house, and the noise, from the young excitable players, was tremendous, even during filming. Everyone was known by their first names and the atmosphere was one of friendly competition, and, at first, Mary had been shocked by the familiarity among the inmates. The comradeship was infectious however, and Mary had soon settled in, and become one of the gang. In reality, however, Mary’s concern for money and ‘appearances’, meant that she could never completely fulfil this role. This doesn’t mean that she despised the other players – inside she wanted to be just like her peers, and wished she could ‘chill’, just like her siblings, Jack and Lottie. Meanwhile, at this early period, Mabel was becoming very popular around the studio, and was always surrounded by a throng of actors and actresses. In fact, it was very difficult for someone like Mack Sennett to get close to her. Mack found Mary to be more approachable, and he sometimes collaborated with her on stories. It was Mack who wrote Mary’s biggest vehicle to that date, The Lonely Villa. Of course, Mabel got to see a highly trained actress, when Mary was on the set, but being of the ‘natural’ kind of actress, Mabel could only use a proportion of what she saw. When she began to get leading roles at Biograph (for instance in Mender of Nets) she was usually cast as a villainess or a tragic figure that eventually died. This required natural skills that Mary did not possess. It was later, when Mabel began comedy that Mary took most note of her methods, which she was to use at a much later date. It could be said that Mabel took some dramatic cues from Mary, especially after 1916, when Mary was so big that it made complete sense to ‘ape’ her mannerisms (good or bad). It is, however, difficult to determine how much ‘dramatics’ Mabel took from Mary, as both had been trained by D.W. Griffith.\n\nThings changed at Biograph when Griffith left for California at the end of 1910, taking the trained stage actors with him. Many were left behind, including Mabel and the young Jack Pickford. However, Mama Pickford ordered Mary and Lottie off the train. They wouldn’t go unless Jack went too. Griffith relented, as he realised that he could incorporate more stunts into his films – Jack could be a stand-in for the girls. In the meantime, Mabel went off to Vitagraph in Brooklyn. Brooklyn was an awkward journey in those days from Mabel’s home in Staten Island, but Mabel thought it worth it. Quite likely, she found lodgings with another actress, as she developed a habit, even at the pinnacle of her career, of shacking up with other people – single girls, and married couples, mostly. At various times she lived with Blanche Sweet, Raymond Hitchcock and wife, and with the Arbuckles at their Santa Monica beach house.\n\nA Religious Awakening.\n\nWhile Mary and co were having a whale of a time, out in California, Mabel was signing a morality clause at Vitagraph, a company set up by puritans, to introduce wholesomeness into pictures. The way Mabel had behaved at Biograph was not acceptable at Vitagraph, where at least one director was a reverend of the church. However, Mabel would not have to curtail herself too much – she’d get into comedy, which gave her some freedom of expression. It wasn’t long before Mabel came to the attention of the other Vitagraph players, and the Talmadge sisters became fascinated with this free-speaking, bronco-riding, cliff-diving emigre from Biograph. Mama Talmadge was also enchanted with Mabel, but told her girls that ‘The Madcap’ would surely come to no good. It was while at Vitagraph that Mabel become a named star, playing comedy alongside John Bunny and Flora Finch. Mabel was riding the crest of a wave, but, all too soon, she came to the attention of the executives for her ‘lewd and unacceptable behaviour’.\n\nThe puritans fired her, so Mabel traipsed back to Biograph, where she was welcomed back, a star – even Mack Sennett became interested. By this time Mary had gone over to the IMP company, which turned out to be a big mistake, and a move that prevented her from gaining early movie stardom. When Mary returned to Biograph in 1912, she renewed her friendship with Mabel, but this time things were different. Mabel was a named star, the only one at the studio, and would be instantly recognised in the films. Consequently, she was even more of an idol to the players than she had been before. This does not mean Mary harboured any ill-feeling towards Mabel, and, indeed, there was none in the opposite direction. In fact, Mabel’s new fame just made Mary more determined to make it to the top. Mabel, of course, was now getting good parts, and she’d cornered the two Greek areas of the dramatic arts – tragedy and comedy. This left Mary with pure dramatics in which to excel. Later, Mary was to say that she’d co-starred with Mabel in a number of films, but we know of just one, The Mender of Nets. In this film Mabel was the tragedienne par excellence, but Mary acquitted herself well, against a formidable opponent in this area of drama.\n\nIt was not all roses for Mary and Mabel, at that time. D.W. Griffith was a complete chauvinist that thought he made the films great, and stars were only made at his command. As a consequence, he adopted an overly -patriarchal way with his actresses. If he gave you a part, you had to take it, or suffer the consequences. Mary was given the lead in Man’s Genesis, but refused it, on the grounds that the part clearly required the wearing of a grass skirt. She discussed this with Mabel, who would likely inherit the role. Mabel said she’d refuse it too, and, in fact, all the ‘regulars’ decided they’d turn it down. Griffith handed the role to newcomer Mae Marsh, who also took the lead in The Sands of Dee. The upshot was that Mary and Mabel decided they would leave at the first opportune moment. Mabel was then asked by Mack Sennett, who’d been made Biograph Comedy director, if she’d like to do comedies with him. Mabel was ambivalent, but Griffith turned Mabel over to Mack to do a certain amount of comedies. Out in California in 1912, Mabel did a mix of comedy and drama, and it was during this time that she made Mender of Nets with Mary. As well as getting along with Mary, Mabel was also friendly with brother Jack and sister Lottie. Some people have suggested that Jack and Mabel became lovers, but although they were definitely friends there is no evidence that they were amorously involved. Lottie was one of the group that idolised action-girl Mabel, along with chief ‘Mabelists’ Dorothy Gish and Gertie Bambrick.\n\nMabel was the first to scat from Biograph, soon after the company returned to New York. Mary left a few months later, to begin her rise to stardom, but made another kind of bad move back to the stage. The theatre was full of big stars, and belatedly Mary realised that it would be easier to get to the top in the nascent world of movies than on the stage. Meanwhile Mabel was making it big time out in L.A. at the new Keystone company, run by Mack Sennett. Mabel, though, was one of the few actresses in L.A. at the time, and she might have filled her lonely hours, by writing back east to her Biograph friends, including, perhaps, Mary. Through 1913 and into 1914, Mary began to get more noticed in her pictures for Famous Players, and her name appeared above the title on cinema notices, and was eventually put up in lights. More of the east coast actors were now coming to Hollywood, and it was at a movie function that Mabel introduced Mary to Charlie Chaplin. She told Chaplin that Mary’s name was Hetty Green, the money-mad millionairess. Chaplin, it turned out, was to play a big part in the separation of Mary and Mabel. However, in 1914, Charlie had played a part in helping Mabel play the type of roles she wanted. Mabel belonged to Mack, while Chaplin belonged to big boss-men Kessell and Baumann, who together, had a bigger share of Keystone than Mack. Charlie was, therefore, able to have more control over his films than Mabel, but together they had a lot of control over their joint pictures. Sure, Mack still interfered, and introduced more slapstick, but Mabel could blossom out into roles that included tragedy and dramatics. This more or less ended, when Chaplin left, and Mack got a firmer grip on things. The following year, 1915, was when Mabel won the Motion Picture best comedienne and Mary the best leading lady. Chaplin, as best comedian, polled 150,000 votes more than Mabel, who polled 100,000 votes more than Mary (Mary Maurice, incidentally, topped the poll with 2,300,000 votes). It was also in 1915 that things went sour between Mary and husband Owen Moore, who moved over to Keystone, and appeared as Mabel’s boyfriend in The Little Teacher.\n\nBeyond 1915.\n\nIn 1916, Mabel had her own studio and production company, The Mabel Normand Feature Film Company, under the auspices of Triangle. Mary attended the opening of Mabel’s studio, and then wrote two articles for her newspaper column in which she praised Mabel’s work, her athleticism and her daring. It was during this time that Mary really hit the top of her game. She also became aware of a new actor in Hollywood by the name of Douglas Fairbanks. Fairbanks was a daring, tree-swinging kind of actor, who stole Mary’s heart. Meanwhile, Mabel had given up ‘he man’ types, and was drifting towards literary men of the bohemian persuasion. Mabel probably thought that there was only room for one daredevil in a relationship, while Mary thought there was only room for one writer – herself. As Mary became more and more enamoured of Fairbanks, she became increasingly dull, and disinterested in being ‘one of the girls’. Fairbanks was a domineering, misogynistic type, and Mary seemed under his spell, so that she inevitably drifted away from husband Owen Moore.\n\nElsewhere, a certain Charlie Chaplin was coming under the spell of Doug Fairbanks. Following Charlie’s marriage to Mildred Harris, he and Mildred spent much time with Mabel, and the girls (and other friends of Mildred) more or less henpecked Charlie. Charlie, of course, was not a ‘man’s man’. However, he found friendship and solace with the older Doug Fairbanks, and more so when Doug and Mary married in 1920, Doug, Mary, and Charlie all being divorced from their partners in that year. Mabel, naturally, lost two friends to Fairbanks, while Mary moved into Doug’s Beverly Hills mansion, a good move, perhaps, but it was probably a gilded cage. As soon as Doug and Mary married, Doug wrote out a list of Mary’s friends that could be invited to the house, which soon became known as Pickfair. Many were left off that list, including Mabel. One person who became a frequent visitor was Charlie Chaplin. Doug and Charlie would go off into the hills, leaving Mary at home, all alone, or baby-sitting one of Charlie’s child brides. The formation of the United Artists film distribution company, in 1919, had meant that Mary, Doug and Charlie became inextricably linked.\n\nWhen looking at the film made at the creation ceremony of United Artists, it seems clear that Doug is the leader of the pack, and Mary and Charlie are mere followers, or even disciples of the great man. They’d become ‘extras’ in the movie that was Doug Fairbanks. Doug’s orchestration and control of Mary and Charlie continued into the 1930s, and evidence of it can be found in the Doug and Mary world tour of 1921, Marilyn Miller’s wedding to Jack Pickford of 1922, and any time the trio were publicly filmed. On the world tour, Mary appeared as a silly little girl, totally dependent on Doug, and when things got a little too hectic in a big crowd, Doug picked Mary up, and balanced her precariously on one shoulder, in good tarzan style. While this made Doug a he-man, Mary was terrified, not so much of the crowds, but of being dropped by Doug. After the tour Doug and Mary were interviewed by the press, but Doug treated Mary like a scatter-brain in front of the camera. Mary, of course, was 30 years old at the time, and not a child. Doug himself was not just an athletic moron, but was the real brains behind United Artists, although he was steeped in prejudice and arrogance.\n\nMarilyn Miller’s and Jack Pickford’s wedding of 1922 is of interest. Jack and Marilyn were great friends of Mabel, but she learned of their marriage while in France, and was not happy that they’d had a proper wedding, while she was away. The newspaper photos showed that Doug and Mary were central in the wedding proceedings, with Charlie Chaplin standing in as chief jester. In any case, when Mabel returned to New York, she headed straight to Marilyn’s apartment, as Marilyn had given Mabel the key, before she went away. She was surprised to find Marilyn’s mother there, as she’d assumed she was still in Los Angeles. Marilyn’s mother explained the whole sordid story. Basically, the Fairbankses had taken over the wedding arrangements, leaving Marilyn’s mother out of the equation. Marilyn’s family thought the wedding should have been in New York, where they all lived, and where many of Jack and Marilyn’s friends resided. Marilyn’s mother received an invitation from Mary in the post, but she simply threw it into the trashcan.\n\nMabel stayed with her for above a week, not daring to leave her alone. Nor was this the first time she’d sat with a mother bereft with tragedy. Two years before, she’d sat every Sunday on the beach at Santa Monica, with the mother of Olive Thomas, following Ollies’s tragic death. Again, the Pickfords had been involved, but perhaps not Doug. Whether Doug was aware that Mary was writing an open letter to the newspapers, in support of Mabel, following the W.D. Taylor murder is not known, but Mary was very supportive. Naturally, the events surrounding the murder affected everyone in Hollywood, including Doug and Mary, and helping Mabel would also have helped themselves.\n\nThe relationship between Mabel and Mary prior to 1919/1920 is pretty much known, but how much Mabel was involved with Doug Fairbanks at that time is unknown. Doug was involved with Triangle through Griffith, at the same time that Mabel was part of the Mabel Normand Feature Film Company, also under Triangle. The lack of familiarity between them might suggest that they were not keen on each other, especially as Mabel was no longer drawn to tree-swingers and lantern-jawed Irishmen. Probably they simply ignored each other, whenever possible. There are no still pictures of the two together, but there are none of Mary and Mabel together either. As we know Doug and Mary lived in a Beverly Hills mansion, a type of place Mabel avoided, after she’d set up for a time at a rented mansion on Melrose Hill in 1915. Chaplin was led by the nose by Doug Fairbanks for a number of years, but at least Doug was a man. Mabel was always fond of linking arms with Charlie in public, until, in the end, he was in danger of becoming Mr. Normand. He did not want to be seen as the lap dog to a slip of a girl with curls. Perhaps that is also why Charlie and Mary were often at loggerheads. Did he think Mary was getting between himself and Doug? Mary summed up Charlie thus: “…. that obstinate, suspicious, egocentric, maddening, and lovable genius of a problem child, Charlie Chaplin.”\n\nWhile Mabel became mainly concerned with literary folk, Doug and Mary began to court celebrity. The celebrities included Albert Einstein, Ghandi, Lord and lady Mountbatten, and other assorted titled peoples. Doug and Mary, of course, were supporters of the Fascists in Germany, much to the distaste of Charlie, and probably Mabel, as well. One problem with Mabel that Doug probably recognised, was that Mabel would not stand for pomposity, bigotry and self-importance, making her unsuitable to be in the same room with jumped-up celebrity, Albert Einstein, or the pompous Lord Louis Mountbatten. Mabel was sure to say or do the wrong thing, hence no Mabel at Pickfair. As time went by, though, Doug and Mary became more and more reclusive from Hollywood, and by 1925 they were regularly pulling up the Pickfair drawbridge. Mary had herself, told many people to come around whenever they liked. One day they were sitting outside the house, when Rudolph Valentino suddenly appeared on the lawn. Doug sprang from his deckchair, grabbed Valentino by the collar, and marched the “greasy dago” down to the gate and threw him out.\n\nThe Final years of the 1920s.\n\nFollowing the scandals associated with Mabel, she’d completed her last film with Sennett, then went on a stage tour of the U.S. Returning to the coast, Mabel was perforce to buy a Beverly Hills house, in order to show that the ‘bad girl’ had settled down. Unfortunately, Sennett again laid claim to Mabel, and planned a super-feature for her in 1926. Mabel considered accepting, but then, out of the blue, married ex-Keystone star Lew Cody, and she decided Sennett was taboo – Mack had to give up. Many producers were ready to scoop Mabel up, but were unsure if Mabel and Mack would get together. A flurry of letters by Mary Pickford, Norma Talmadge, Blanche Sweet and others, to Hal Roach, convinced the Irish comedy producer that it was sensible to sign Mabel, and poke Sennett in the eye. Hal thought of Mabel, as a falling star that could be acquired at a peppercorn price. After all, hadn’t he signed mega-vamp Theda Barra for $500 a week? Unfortunately, for Hal, Mabel came with a super-star price tag, and life for the Irishman would henceforth be ‘uncomfortable’. Below is an open letter published, after Mabel had signed with Roach\n\nOpen letter from Mary Pickford April 1926.\n\nWelcome back to the screen, Mabel Normand! Your return makes us all happy for you have the gifts, the training, the personality and the technique, the one which is so sure that it does not show.\n\nYou have that rare thing, that possession above price, Mabel Normand, the charm of personality! Ever since I first saw you on the screen I have tremendously and sincerely admired your gifts and abilities as an artist. These with your kindly heart and mind make you the screen’s very own and we all are proud of your splendid work.\n\nThis is a wish, thus publicly expressed, for newer and bigger success to you, and it is a wish that everybody that I know sincerely shares.\n\nThe best o’ luck, Mabel\n\nMabel died in February 1930, just as the final curtain fell on the silent movie. At the funeral, Mary came close to beating Constance Talmadge with the tears, the first time anyone had been close to displacing Connie. It was not just the silent movie that had died, though, for Mary and Doug’s marriage was also now slowly dying. Was there any point in carrying on as the ‘It couple’? To be honest, the whole thing had been a sham – just a way of creating a dynasty that would keep them in the public eye forever. Both Doug and Mary entered into extra-marital affairs, and while Doug was out on the town hitting the booze, Mary was often at home, drinking herself into oblivion. They still appeared in public, and still entertained celebrities at Pickfair, but they were ‘has beens’, just interesting windows into the past. Inevitably, they became estranged, and divorced in 1936. Both remarried, and Mary found Buddy Rogers, who was to be her rock, until she died in 1979.\n\nInteresting facts about Mary and Mabel.\n\nMary was known for her golden banana curls from the earliest days. So much success did she reap from the curls that everyone began to copy the style. Mabel, when she first came to Biograph, had a coiffuered style, befitting of the Gibson Girl that she was, and did not want to change to a Little Lord Fauntleroy hairdo. Mabel’s curls first appeared under Mack Sennett, so he obviously considered them advantageous. Mabel, however, had an intense dislike for them, and found curls to be something of a nuisance, and piled them up on top of her head wherever possible. Mary’s curls, though, were different to those of everyone else, as she used three different types of curler to achieve the effect of big curls, small curls and wavy top. Other actresses used rags to make the curls, but Mary had the rollers in overnight, with, as Claire Windsor told in an interview, her hand between her head and the rollers, while she slept. This apparently caused some damage to the nerves in her hand. When Claire told Mary she admired her acting, Mary said “Don’t be silly, my success is all down to my hair.”\n\nMary Pickford was a capable seamstress, although in her Biograph days, her mother had made her dresses. When mama’s time-knurled digits began to give out, Mary began to make her own frocks. Again, Claire tells us that, when she worked for Mary, she thought nothing of getting down on her hands and knees to alter Claire’s dresses. Mabel, of course, did not know one end of a needle from the other, and bought Parisian frocks by the half-dozen, wore one, and gave the rest away. If you think some of Mabel’s dresses are unlike anything in contemporary catalogues, then you’d be right, for she sometimes designed, but did not make, her own clothes and hats.\n\nAt Biograph, D.W. Griffith often criticised Mary, and told her she was too fat. Mary was always ‘chubby’ and once said her head was too big for her body, her arms were too long, and her legs too short. Mabel was, naturally, that rare thing, a perfect ‘36’. In her autobiography, Mary recounts how Griffith would shake her by the shoulders, and one day hurled her across the set, leaving her with a badly bruised arm. Blanche Sweet received similar treatment, but tough guy Griffith avoided Mabel — her vindictive tongue alone could turn the strongest man to a quivering jelly.\n\nMary was part of a close-knit family, but by 1938, her mother, brother and sister were all dead, leaving her alone in the world. Doug Fairbanks died in 1939. Mary retreated to Pickfair, with new husband Buddy Rogers, who kept her on an even keel for many years, and covered up her secret drinking. By the late 1960s Mary was losing her mind, and she spent her remaining years in bed.\n\nIt is probably true to say that Mary was a star of Hollywood, but that Mabel was a star in Hollywood — it was Mabel’s peers that put her on a dais in the temple of Hollywood.\n\nMack Sennett and Sam Goldwyn were once involved in a battle royal for a star, and her name was Mabel Normand. Unbelievably, Sam, for a time, came out the winner, but there were extenuating circumstances that led to his very pyrrhic victory. The most important part about this tale, is that Goldwyn and Sennett were very different personalities, the original chalk and cheese. Let’s look at who they were, and how they came to Tinsel Town, or ‘Mudsville’, as it then was.\n\nThe Star-maker and the Glove-maker.\n\nMack Sennett called himself ‘The Star-maker’ and there is no doubt that he made stars of many of the people that he dragged off the street. His contention, nonetheless, that he made Mabel Normand a star is, as Louise Brooks once said, a complete fabrication. In a scene from his great extravaganza, not a film but his autobiography, he would have us believe that, on a Staten Island ferry, one moonlit night, he took the Biograph Girl in his arms and vowed that he’d make her a star. Total piffle, said the incredulous Miss Brooks, for Mabel was already, at that time, a star of great magnitude, and the only named star at the Biograph studio. He claimed he’d given Mabel a cheap engagement ring, but this ignores the fact that Mabel already knew the difference between diamonds and paste. If he’d given her this ring, then it must, surely, now lie at the bottom of the Hudson river, where Mabel would have certainly thrown it. The relationship between Mack and Mabel is well-documented by Mrs Griffith (wife of the great D.W.). She records that Mack, far from wooing Mabel, tried to buy her compliance in his crazy scheme of film-making. Mrs Griffith assures us that Mack, who saw Mabel drifting away at the eleventh hour, tried to keep her onside with a seventy-dollar ($1,900 today) bracelet.\n\nShe then sums Mack up, by saying that, when he was offered eighty-five dollars for said bracelet, he immediately relaxed his grip on the glittering prize. In brief, Mabel went with the Keystone set-up for completely different reasons, that did not include love. Mack was to run his studio, not with a rod of iron, but a baseball bat. If you crossed him, you cleared out quick, before he got a grip on the bat. Charlie Chaplin was a different kettle of fish altogether. His close relationship with the Keystone Girl, made him Mack’s biggest threat, so Charlie almost certainly left at the point of Mack’s 45-calibre revolver. Mabel’s rise from ‘Hollywood Bad Girl’ to the paragon of motion pictures, though, in the 20 years following her untimely death, was entirely due to Mack’s untiring efforts, but these were efforts to put himself on a pedestal, rather than Mabel. In the 1930s, the silent stars dropped out of favour, so it was with some surprise that a thousand Hollywood talkie stars, and aging silent stars, found themselves at Republic Studios in 1940, to not only open the Mabel Normand Sound Stage, and celebrate her life, but to erect the only plaque to a movie star in the whole of Hollywood.\n\nThat plaque was (is) solid bronze, three feet high, and weighed a staggering 300 pounds. Mack was flying high, and in the late 40s, persuaded Paramount to make a film called The Keystone Girl, starring Betty Hutton, as Mabel. The film, was dropped when Betty learned that she would not be the star – the actor playing Mack Sennett would head the film credits. Paramount picked an alternative film called Sunset Boulevard. The film damned Mabel’s memory forever, but allowed washed up silent star Gloria Swanson to extend her career – forever. The sacrilegious act that the film’s director Billy Wilder committed, did not, however, go unnoticed by the old silent producers headed by Louis B. Mayer, who swore that he’d drive the infidel out of the movies. As an example of Mack’s character, he said nothing. At that time, though, when McCarthyism was in vogue, and Chaplin had been booted out, there was little Mack could do, except prepare to be investigated by McCarthy and the I.R.S. and probably the F.B.I over the dormant Taylor murder case.\n\nSam Goldwyn (or Goldfish) was an entirely different character to Mack Sennett. The only thing that linked the two was their mode of entry into the U.S. via the Canadian border – they’d both simply walked over the line. Mack was Irish-Canadian, Sam was a Polish-Jew. Mack cut his teeth in the iron works, and down in the low-class theatres (more correctly termed joints) of the East Side’s Bowery. Sam was a glove salesman of considerable ability, who had once tried to make gloves. He was hopeless, but managed to persuade a Mr Lehr to make them for him. Lehr (or ‘Leer’ as Mabel called him) later became Sam’s studio supervisor. Sam was, essentially, a loner, a renegade, someone who would chance his arm on any scheme. He’d been involved with a large number of movie big-shots, before he finally, to everyone’s surprise, went on his own. This seemed like lunacy.\n\nSam had no studio, no camera and no performers, and it all seemed hopeless, didn’t it? Well, no, actually. Sam had a secret, and a very special secret – he had letter of intent signed by, of all people, Mabel Normand. Yes, she of The Mabel Normand Feature Film Company, she of the title of Best Comedienne 1915, and the most desirable maid in Christendom. This was Sam’s passport to – money, and lots of it. Bankroll Sam, and he could add studio, cameras, lights and everything else. The main point was he had the star, correction, THE STAR! Just one question – how did Sam get his hands on, of all actresses, the Keystone Girl? Sam had made his initial move at the opening ceremony for The Mabel Normand Studio. Convinced that the distribution company, Triangle, would fail, taking Sennett, Griffith, Ince, and New York Motion Pictures with it, Sam told Mabel that, if the pack of cards should collapse, he’d sign her up for a new studio he had in mind. When the prophesy came true, Mabel signed the letter, and by November had signed the contract. It was around this time that Mabel came to realise that she was being tailed by various goons, hiding behind sunglasses — hired separately by Mack and Kessell and Baumann of New York Motion Pictures.\n\nAway To The Jersey Shore.\n\nIt was in the Spring of 1917 that Mabel quietly boarded a train for New York. She was going to set up in the city, before starting at Sam’s Fort Lee studio. She had reservations though. It transpired that Sam was not going to run a studio with one big star supported by a team of also-rans. The Pole had signed Mae Marsh, glittering star of the Griffith Studio, and not someone Mabel or the ‘old girls’ from the Biograph academy were particularly keen on. Sam’s plans now became clear – he would buy up rights to successful stage plays, and bring equally successful stage artists to play in movie adaptations of the plays. This obviously sent alarm bells ringing in Mabel’s head, and, additionally, there was no guarantee that the glove-maker could deliver well-adapted stage plays. Mabel didn’t panic, she merely announced in the press that she would work for anyone with the necessary finance to pay for her services.\n\nShe’d signed with Sam for $1,000 a week, but only on the understanding that she’d be the sole star name. As far as Mabel was concerned the contract was null and void. Sam, though, thought differently, as the ‘one star only’ clause had not been written down. The friendly Pole, therefore, obtained an injunction, preventing Mabel from working elsewhere. This was bad news for Mabel, who’d been bitten for the second time. It had been within her grasp to be a partner in the Keystone, when it was first formed, as the two wise guys, Kessell and Baumann that had founded the company had stipulated that Mabel had to be part of the package Mack Sennett brought to the company. If Mabel hadn’t been young and foolish, she could have contracted for one-sixth of Keystone – as it was, when she entered New York in 1917, she owned little more than the coat on her back and one battered suitcase. She’d given her best years to building Keystone, and had nothing to show for it. However, for Mack it was not all roses. He’d lost his biggest star, but, so involved was he in holding onto what he had that he could not pursue Mabel. Mack lost the Keystone name to movie tycoon Harry Aitken, but retained the studio on Allesandro Street, and the Fountain Avenue studio, previously housing The Mabel Normand Feature Film Company. However, Mack could not simply snatch Mabel, due to the injunction, but he could renegotiate Mabel’s contract – and make the price so high that Sam would relinquish his hold on her. Mack was never able to attend to the negotiations himself, but sent lawyers instead, which displeased Mabel. When the contract price reached $1,500 a week, Mabel pulled out, and settled for the 1,500, leaving in the first instance for Sam’s Florida studio.\n\nAs we can tell from Mabel’s telegram, she was not pleased that Mack had not pursued her with more vigour. However, Mack had done what he could could, under the circumstances, and he knew Sam was smart with a capital ‘S’. Mabel had sleep-walked into the situation, again not realising the importance of solid contracts, and relying on promises. Of all the movie-moguls, Sam was probably the most astute, but he was also the most pig-headed and obstinate, remaining a lone producer for most of his career. In terms of reverence among the Hollywooders, he was right up there with Mabel, but for slightly different reasons.\n\nMabel settled down to life as a Jersey shore girl, but Sam was to discover all too soon that she was a Staten Island girl at heart, and chaos soon ensued at the studio. Mabel would disrupt the scenes of the swell-headed theater and opera stars that Sam brought in, and those that thought they could shut Mabel out were wrong – suddenly buckets of water would reign down on their heads from the open tops of their sets, and loud jazz music would drown out their soothing classical strains. Executives that warned Mabel off, became victims of Mabel’s schoolgirl pranks, like electrified doorknobs, and liberal sprayings of strong perfume. By this time, of course, Mabel had become unassailable, but, in any event, Sam was infatuated and fascinated by her. Mabel was a Hollywood treasure, although it was difficult for any other producers to lay hands on her. Simply, they had all been involved with Sennett in some way or other, and respected his right of ownership over his Keystone Girl, but Sam was a maverick, as stubborn and bull-headed as any Irishman, and he didn’t care how many goons or hit squads Mack sent around. He also knew that, although actors and directors could be ‘blown away’, producer on producer was verboten.\n\nMoney For Old Rope.\n\nThe general opinion of the movie critics was that the Goldwyn pictures were badly presented, despite the volume of talent that filled them. Although meant to be plays projected onto the screen, the films came over as slightly below par. Mabel, however, was able to transcend the lack of artistry, and increase her standing in the world of films. This was mainly due to Sam’s insistence on a huge publicity campaign accompanying each film, and the public loved it. When Mabel presented her brother Claude with a new Indian motorcycle, Sam’s photographers were there to record the event, and snap Mabel aboard the bike with heart-throb Jack Pickford. Mabel’s innate love of children, and the way children were naturally drawn to her, meant Sam would often put Mabel with youngsters for photo sessions. When the film Jinx was released, dozens of Mabel-lookalikes were brought to the studio, and photographed wearing checked ‘Jinx’ costumes. At Christmas 1918, Mabel hosted an orphans party at the Fort Lee Studios, which was a massive, highly publicised extravaganza. Just to make sure Sam’s head didn’t inflate too much, Mabel’s seminal Triangle feature, Mickey, was released in the same year.\n\nOf course, Mickey was the picture that out-grossed D.W. Griffith’s Birth of A Nation, and this decreased Sam’s theoretical hold on The Keystone Girl, and increased the likelihood that Mack might snatch her back. There was no way Sam, with his current set-up, could hope to match the charm, magnetism and sheer artistry of Mickey, but he wasn’t beaten yet. He would turn the producer/actress relationship upside down — henceforth he’d give Mabel everything she desired, along with things she’d never even thought of. Mabel’s lateness at the studio cost the company above $30,000, Sam ignored it. Her japes and jokes cost Sam more money, and brought complaints from the executives and other actresses — Sam ignored them. One actress decorated her dressing room at her own cost — Sam paid thousands to bring Mabel’s dressing room up to an even better standard. Directors were afraid to report Mabel to Sam for indiscretions. As Mack described it, Mabel was swinging the rope, and Sam was jumping.\n\nThe Class of 1919/20.\n\nEarly in 1919, Mabel had returned to L.A. and was based at Sam’s Culver City Studio. It seemed she’d tired of Fort Lee, especially as the movie industry itself was increasingly shifting west. Probably, Mabel was keen to be at the center of things, and did not want to miss out. Most of her friends were now in Hollywood. Mildred Harris had married Charlie Chaplin, and Mabel wasted no time in getting involved with the couple, as she had with others in the past, and would in the future. Early on at Keystone, she’d befriended the Arbuckles, and spent much time at their beach-house in Santa Monica. When things got bad between Mack and Mabel, in 1915, she’d hidden out at the beach-house for over a week. Later, when she’d ran away to New York in 1917, Raymond Hitchcock and his wife had put her up for a while. The curious thing about Mabel was her dislike, or fear, of living alone. She loved the apparent security of her married friends lives, but refused to marry herself. For two years she’d lived with Blanche Sweet and her mother. It’s possible that Mildred and Charlie accepted Mabel as a levelling influence, as things were not good between them. Being a party animal, Mabel was able to organise functions for the couple, Charlie being socially inept, and Mildred being a little too young. It was to be Mabel’s renewed contact with Chaplin that led towards Mabel’s departure from Goldwyn and re-arrival at Sennett Studios.\n\nThings began to change for Sam, as the war and the subsequent influenza epidemic began to wipe out his profits. In a period of gloom, the public was not prepared to seek out picture houses that had stayed open, and watch gloomy drama, but they were prepared to go out and watch Mabel’s comedies. As a result, Sam began to cut his dramatic stars’ pay and benefits. Renegotiated contracts were worth less, and costume and travel allowances were terminated. Mabel, however, always a big earner, remained untouched. Then, in 1920, Mabel contracted influenza, which aggravated her tuberculosis, and put her close to death. On top of that, her friend Olive Thomas, wife of Jack Pickford, died after inadvertently swallowing drain cleaner, sending Mabel into a downward spiral. It may have been Norma Talmadge, Charlie Chaplin, or Sam himself that engaged a private nurse, Julia Brew, so that Mabel could keep working. Soon after, Sam records, Mabel entered his office, and tipped out $80,000 worth of bonds and jewelry out of her bag and onto his desk.\n\n“There you go Sam — if this is of any help to you, my love, take it.”\n\nSam did not take it, it would not have helped — Sam was two-million in debt. The bonds had come from a trust fund set up by Sam to ensure spendthrift Mabel did not end up on the streets.\n\nWinners and Losers.\n\nAs 1920 rolled into 1921, it became clear to Sam that he could not carry on with his all-star team, and he began to jettison stars. Mabel was now unsustainable, and much as he regretted it, he’d eventually have to let her go, . In any event, his Goldwyn Girl was still sick, and Sam was concerned that she might die, while under his contract (by this time Mabel had already been given the last rites on two occasions). In desperation, he contacted the world expert on all things Mabel — Charlie Chaplin. Charlie told him straight:\n\n“You must send her to Sennett. It’s a matter of understanding, they are both as Irish as the banshees, and compliment each other perfectly. At Sennett she will flourish, anywhere else she will become commonplace.”\n\nSam, naturally, was unsure. Could he really pack Mabel off to his arch-enemy? In reality, he could not send her anywhere else. The big studios would not touch Mabel, while Mack maintained an interest in her. Mack had already sensed blood, and had made representations to Sam for Mabel’s return. Sam came to a decision — he’d cancel Mabel’s, contract leaving her free to sign with the Irishman, the price being a mere $15,000. Mack was shocked, but a quick calculation convinced him that he could claw back the cash easily, from just one film. He had a feature film in mind, Molly O’, which required a star performer of the greatest magnitude, and none of his stock company could genuinely fulfill that role. The public were eager to have a new Mack and Mabel film, and the picture would be a blockbuster for sure.\n\nSo it was that Mabel meekly arrived on a July day in 1921, at the Sennett studios, Allesandro Street, Edendale — except there was nothing meek about her arrival. She was carried through the gate in a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce, together with her lawyer, and a liveried footman. After allowing sufficient time for her fans, the entire Sennett company, to assemble, the queen stepped forth to the obvious joy of the actors and actresses. The studio had been without a real figurehead since 1917, now they had Mabel. Mack rapidly appeared, intent on stealing the thunder, but had difficulty in extracting his new star from the throng. Once ensconced in Mack’s office, it was down to business around Mack’s board table. Mack wasted no time, and pushed the contract across the table. Mabel pushed it aside, and the lawyer placed Mabel’s own contract down. Mack glanced at it:\n\n“Five-thousand a week, Mabel, and 30% of the profits, you must be joking!”\n\n“I kid you not, Mister Sennett, you can take it or leave it, and my name is Miss Normand to you”\n\nMack read some more.\n\n“Sorry Mabel, there’s something missing — our standard terms are that the actor supplies their own costumes, and pays for their own transport costs to all locations.”\n\n“Not this baby, my old chap.”\n\nThe lawyer intervened:\n\n“Mister Sennett, Miss Normand is an actress of the topmost quality, and I’m sure you understand that she attracts the highest rates of pay, as a consequence.”\n\n“Yes, but good god, this could bankrupt us.”\n\n“Take it or leave it, old bean, take it or leave it.” Replied Mabel.\n\nMack was in a fix: “Well, I think this can all be sorted out amicably, but the final say must lie with our chief director and supervisor, Dick Jones.”\n\nHe sent out a call for Dick Jones. Mack had noticed that Mabel did not look at all well, and wanted Dick to see her. Dick was somewhat aghast at Mabel’s appearance, but managed to conceal his emotions. Dick ran through a few things with Mabel, and made it clear that she’d have to go through the standard insurance medical examination, but he was sure Mabel would pass the test. Mabel signed a letter of intent, which was contingent upon the medical and a redrawn contract.\n\nThe contract Mabel’s lawyer received stated that the start day of the contract would be five weeks hence, should Mabel pass the insurer’s medical. The terms stated that Mabel should immediately go to New York, where she could rest up in order to recover her health. The medical would take place in Manhattan. Mack realised that if she stayed in the party-strewn environs of Hollywood, she would not recover. The lawyer returned the contract with modifications. Briefly, Sennett studios would pay all costs involved in travelling to and from New York, and cover all living costs while there. Sennett agreed, but stipulated that Mabel must stay with her parents on Staten Island. This would be cheaper, but also ensure that she did not have easy access to the flesh pots of Manhattan. At any one time, there were a host of Hollywood actors in New York, and Mack did not want Mabel associating with the likes of Jack Pickford or Marilyn Miller. In the event, Mabel ended up in Greenwich Village, among the bohemians, artists, and literary people. She gave up the gin and the ice-cream breakfasts, and passed the insurer’s medical, returning to L.A., as Mack Sennett told it, as gay as a wisp. Mack would not have an easy time.\n\nEpilogue\n\nLife for Mack was far from easy, when Mabel arrived back at the studio, for she immediately demanded her old dressing room, which had been occupied by another actress for a couple of years. She also insisted that Mack install a marble-lined bath, then, just as arrangements had been made for the other actress to move out, Mabel decided to share it with her. To keep Mack on his toes, Mabel insisted that she would only sign contracts on a picture by picture basis. Mack Sennett had won the battle, but he had not won the war. In a few short years, Mabel would be lost to her ‘svengali’ — for good.\n\nThis is the continuing story of Carl Stearn Clancy’s round-the-world ride to Hollywood. In the previous part he described how he met Mack and Mabel in California, then continued to New York, with a determination to later return to the orange groves, and stake a claim to the Tinsel Town lifestyle. We begin with Clancy’s ride to Portland, with Hollywood boy, Bob Allen aboard their trusty Hendersons..\n\n——————————-\n\nThe journey from Oakland to Portland was the worst I’d ever experienced in my life. When a mere three miles from Oakland, our club friends abandoned us to our fate and the Oregon Trail, which by the way, is designated The Pacific Highway (we were, by the way, unaware that the Lincoln transcontinental highway was then under construction). Some highway – we soon hit deep sand, and were often bogged down and smothered in the clouds of dust, stirred up by prairie schooners (horse-drawn wagons, to you and I). The land around was completely flat, but when the road hit a ranch, it simply stopped, leaving us to skirt around in the scrub, until we found the sand road again on the other side, many miles distant. Eventually we reached the foothills of the Sierras, and began a gentle climb, until we hit the mountains proper, and then our troubles started. The inclines were incredibly steep and slippery, and my old model struggled, but Bob’s 1913 model had a stronger transmission and sometimes he had to tow me.\n\nThe problem was that, when you went up, you came down again, slipping and sliding, barely able slow the speed, and heading for the lake that inevitably sat at the end of the descent. Bob luckily had both a front and rear brake. We did a lot of pushing in the mountains! After several days we made it to a lonely settlement, scarcely worthy of the name town. The large gas cans we carried were just about empty, and we eagerly tanked up — at 26 cents a gallon. We had an interesting talk with the garage owner. We said we were surprised at the lack of Red Indians in the mountains, as we knew that the intrepid Lewis and Clark had been helped by them in their 1801 transcontinental trek. The owner explained:\n\n“Well” He said “Buffalo Bill took half of them, and the rest made off for Hollywood, to perform in them thar cowboy films.”\n\nMy L.A. friend, Bob, smiled, and I told our man that we’ heard the mountains groan eerily in the middle of the night. He told us it was the mountains ‘speaking’, or at least the silver in them. It seems that sometimes the lode groans, and sometimes it clangs, like a hammer on an anvil.\n\nWe continued on to Portland, with the bad roads causing us mischief. First my head-race collapsed so that the handlebars locked, but we solved that by removing the bearing race, inserting a long bolt and securing it by bending it around. Then Bob’s front fork snapped and had to be secured by two plug wrenches wired together. The small towns were a problem to us, as every time we parked up, something got thieved from the machines. At one time we abandoned the trail and rode along the sleepers of a railway line, but eventually reached The City of Roses, Portland. Away, then, to the Rockies, and the Continental Divide. Finally, we hit the real Wild West at Butte Montana, where every other man was drunk, and almost nobody spoke English. We shot out from Butte like scalded cats, mainly because prices were so extraordinarily high, due to the large wages earned (and drunk) by the copper miners. From there we reached Yellowstone, but were barred from the park, as motor traffic was not then being allowed through. It was about twenty miles from Chicago, that we hit unexpectedly bad roads. After leaving Bob in Chicago, I visited the Henderson factory in Detroit, and it was onward to the good old well-surfaced roads of New York.\n\nHollywood Beckons\n\nI was glad to be home, but my euphoria lasted all of five days. I had to admit it – I had the wanderlust. During that time, I began to wonder what Walt Storey was up to. Walt, you will remember, was the companion who abandoned me in Paris for the good life at Pathe Films. Now he was with Pathe, would he come to America? Pathe were here already, and they’d formed an all-American studio, which had begun making the Perils of Pauline films, aimed at wiping Mack and Mabel clear off Sunset Boulevard. Bob Allen wrote to me from Hollywood, suggesting I should come out there. In the meantime, I received a beautifully written letter from Mabel, via my publishers, replete with some poetic verse. Enclosed in the package was a complete reel of 35mm film. I hurriedly borrowed a projector, and ran the picture. There was the film of our meeting with the bikes, but there were also snips from other Mabel films, including clips of Minta and Roscoe Arbuckle, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain. Apparently, Mabel had stolen the negatives, and had them printed downtown. This was shocking enough, but there was also a check for $500!\n\n“I thought you might be short of cash after your round the world trek, so here’s what I would have contributed, if I had known you, before you went away.”\n\nI’d heard that Mabel was generous to a fault, but this was ridiculous (apparently her lowest tip to a waiter was $10!). Anyhow, I began to write travel stories, which I thought might interest Sennett. I sent several out to him, two of which he accepted, and sent me a check for $60. A good start. Meanwhile, I had been catching up on the Keystone films. One of them stuck in my mind, Mabel’s Dramatic Career, in which Mabel abandons her love, country boy Mack Sennett, for a tin-type played by Ford Sterling, who puts her into pictures. Some years later, Mack discovers that Mabel is a movie star, which greatly upsets him. Then the unbelievable happens, and Mack goes after the tin-type with a .45 revolver, and discovers, to his horror, he’s married to Mabel, with whom he has had three children. Mack pushes his gun through the open window of their house, determined to kill them all. Of course, comedy overtakes, and Mack is stopped by someone emptying a chamber pot over his head from above.\n\nThe film puzzled me greatly, for nothing of the like had happened in a Keystone before. Then I remembered back to the café argument between Mack and Mabel over Chaplin – could it be that the film was a thinly-veiled warning to Chaplin not to get too involved with The Keystone Girl? Chaplin eventually went to Keystone, but, as he later told me, he was initially too afraid to go through the gate, being certain that Sennett would immediately ‘blow him away’. Anyhow, Chaplin came to Keystone, and made very good films, eleven of them with the Keystone Girl. He was incredibly funny as the drunken tramp in Mabel’s Strange Predicament, alongside the indefatigable, pajama-clad Mabel. Then there was Mabel At The Wheel, which was a comic-drama type film, in which Mabel played a motor-racing heroine, and Chaplin played a Mustachio-Pete type villain. From my point of view, the film was great, with plenty of views of the top race cars sliding around. Chaplin, though, looked very small in this film, and his performance was, shall I say, lacklustre and somewhat ridiculous. Chaplin was badly squeezed I thought, between Mabel and Marie Dressler, in Tillies Punctured Romance, and, again, Mabel outshone him. Charlie told me, years later, that the film had little merit, but Mabel, as a gangster’s moll, broke new ground in this picture. Later Chaplin bought the rights to the film, and put his own name at the top of the cast list. An egotist? Well, everyone has to make up their own mind about that.\n\n1915 was a curious year for me. I was selling more stories and adaptations to studios in Hollywood, New York and on the Jersey shore. I’d even penetrated the British market, to a small extent. I also came under pressure to marry a debutante, the daughter of my father’s business partner, a multi-millionaire. In defiance I became engaged to my childhood sweetheart, the daughter of a car salesman, who I shall call Delia to save her from embarrassment. Delia was a bike fan, but also the world’s greatest Mabel fan. Girls of course made up more than half of Miss Keystone’s fan base, and few went over to Pearl White’s Pauline. In late 1914, Chaplin left the Keystone fold, and Mabel began to appear regularly with Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle. These were based on Roscoe and Mabel being love-sick country kids, something I found somewhat distasteful, but which the girls, including Delia, found to be right up their street. On top of the love-sick stuff there was slapstick galore, something which I’d thought Mabel was moving away from.\n\nDuring the year, I’d sent Sennett an adaptation of an early D.W. Griffith film called The Little Teacher. He was delighted by anything that tweaked the genius’ nose, and he made a good job of this one, as far as slapstick’s concerned. Again, this seemed to go against the tide, as far as Mabel was concerned, and I’d intended it to be a comic-drama. I later found that this film caused the greatest row ever, between Mack and Mabel, and began their descent into estrangement. I can see three possible reasons for the arguments.\n\nSennett deviated from my script, in which I intended that Mabel’s personality would come to the fore (in fact Mack Sennett usurped the leading role).\n\nMabel wanted to insert a scene, in which she dives eighty feet from a bridge into the Hollenbeck Park lake, to rescue a drowning Arbuckle. Mack refused, on the grounds that she’d kill herself. Mabel insisted, on the grounds that Mack was destroying her career, so she might just as well be dead.\n\nMabel wanted Keystone’s new signing, Owen Moore, in the film. Mack knew that Owen had recently become separated from spouse Mary Pickford, and was consequently just about back on the market – the pair officially divorced the following year. This might have rattled Mack. Having got shot of Chaplin, he had to worry about Mabel running away with heart-throb Owen. This, I think is the first time we see Mabel in a nightdress, being fondled by – Owen Moore!\n\nLink: The Little Teacher 1915.\n\n“Go West, Young Man!”\n\nIn early 1916, my fiancé, and I agreed to moving out to the San Francisco area. The movie industry was gradually drifting away from the east coast, and we’d tired of the Atlantic weather. It was palm trees here we come, and we chose to reside in Santa Clara, which was close to just about everything, including steamships out to the Pacific. Mabel had been in New York for a couple of months, but, unsurprisingly, we hadn’t seen her, although it was reported that she was not returning to Keystone, and staying on in New York. To do what, we wondered? We boarded the California-bound train, having sent the Henderson onward by freight. At Chicago we read in the paper that Mabel had signed for Keystone’s old distributor, Mutual, apparently to do Chaplin pictures! This meant, of course, that she would soon be back in Hollywood, but I had visions of Sennett, stalking around with that old .45. It was, I think, in Salt Lake City that we picked up another paper, in which it was said that Keystone’s new distributors, Triangle, had signed her for a new company called The Mabel Normand Feature Film Company, and she’d be in Hollywood within a week, to take possession of a brand new studio on Fountain Avenue, East Hollywood. Oh my God, history was being written, and we’d be there to witness it!\n\nMotography, May 6, 1916\n\n“Mabel Normand, the former Keystone comedienne, is ready to start her new work as an aspiring dramatic star with ‘Triangle’. Miss Normand is to have her own studio, a four-acre tract midway between Los Angeles and Hollywood, and will have her own company of players who will be used as her permanent supporting cast in each of the plays in which she will appear. The director for Miss Normand has not yet been named. Each player will be under the personal supervision of Ince and will be released as a Triangle-Kay Bee subject.”\n\nI set to work immediately I arrived in California, and began punting around for freelance work with newspapers and magazines, and I also sketched some ideas for documentary films and sent them to Sennett for his thoughts. One was a film about shark fishing, another about whales, and something on Hawaii (who knows we might get a free holiday). Sennett replied very quickly and said he might use the shark fishing idea, but we were shocked to find he’d enclosed an invitation for three people, to the grand opening of The Mabel Normand Studio, RSVP, along with the letter. Well, we were stunned, but surprised that Sennett had anything to do with this studio – we’d heard Tom Ince was supervising. Evidently, Ince had dropped out and Sennett took over. We wondered what Mabel thought about that. We were, however, over the moon, naturally, and I wired Bob Allen in Hollywood telling him that he could come to the opening, if he so wished. Bob of course, did not refuse, and invited us down to his house in Hollywood. A week later, and we set off for the Mabel Normand Studio. We arrived just as the stars were going in wearing their best finery, and Delia got panicky. “Oh, God, I don’t fit in here.” She said. I replied “Don’t worry about that, no-one expects you to be a star.” Bob, of course, was keen on getting close and personal with The Keystone Girl, or was she now The Mabel Normand Girl? On entry, a Japanese butler bowed and took our coats. Mack Sennett was greeting everyone, and he instantly recognised me, shook my hand, then led us over to where Mabel was amongst a throng of giggling girls. I recognised most of them as sirens of the screen. Mack said:\n\n“Mabel, you remember our Mr Clancy, don’t you?”\n\n“Of course I do, how are things going for you nowadays?”\n\n“Just fine, Miss Normand, this is my fiancé, Delia Cooper.”\n\n“Oh, you’re getting married, I’m so pleased for you.”\n\nWith that she threw her arms around the astonished Delia, and embraced her saying:\n\n“I always think a single girl is like an empty jug, don’t you?”\n\nI learned later that this was typical Mabel behaviour. Mabel recognised Bob and shook his hand. Then Sennett took mine and Bob’s arms saying,” let’s go see the men.” Delia tried to follow, but Mabel caught her arm saying “Now you stay with us girls, my dear.” Delia told me later that she was trembling before the massed company of stars, and wished for the floor to open up and swallow her. Mabel introduced her ‘friends’ in the following way:\n\n“This is Blanche, this is Dotty, this is Norma, this is Connie (sisters you know), this is Lottie, this is Gladys, sorry Mary, this is Minta, and this is our new girl on the block, Bessie… and so on”\n\nDelia filled the rest in herself: Sweet, Gish, Talmadge, Pickford, Durfee, and Love….\n\nI was introduced to quite a few producers, and naturally I was touting for future business. Bob kept looking over to where the girls were, and was getting restless. Then there followed the opening ceremony, and Mack Sennett and Mabel made a long, combined speech, after which the cameras moved in, and suddenly a girl was brought either side of me, and told to put their arms around me and kiss me. Well, an electric shock went up my spine. The kissers? Norma and Constance Talmadge! Following this, the ‘girls’ departed for Mabel’s first floor dressing room, taking Delia with them. A few minutes later, Blanche Sweet appeared on Mabel’s balcony overlooking the main stage (where we were) and gave a rendition from Romeo and Juliet. Bob and I circulated for about two hours, by which time a lot of squealing and giggling was coming from Mabel’s dressing room. To keep it short, I rescued Delia from ‘the girls’ as I did not wish to hang around to see the objects of my long-term desire, lying around dishevelled, among the erstwhile contents of their own stomachs. Mabel was ‘well gone’ by the time I pulled the tipsy Delia away, and plenty of the starlets were somewhat hazy, among the full and empty gin bottles.\n\nThe next day I asked Delia what had happened in the dressing room, and she told me that the actresses seemed to be sincere, and close-knit friends, and Mabel took pains to make sure Delia was not left out. Bessie Love seemed out of the loop, but Mabel made her feel welcome, calling her “My little Pixie.” Downstairs, we’d had beer and sandwiches, but Mabel’s Japanese cook had prepared a meal for 25 girls, using the dressing room facilities. Most of the conversation was about the producers that they, and especially Mabel, ridiculed mercilessly. The great Griffith was a “hook-nosed Welsh windbag”, Sam Goldwyn was “that bald-headed, Hungarian goulash that waddled like a duck” but Mabel saved her venom for Sennett. Once, she looked over the balcony, pointed at Sennett, saying “Look at him, a fucking jumped-up Napoleon – a thick-necked, ignorant fucking MICK!” Then she turned to Delia saying “Sorry, Delia, for pointing.” The dressing room itself looked as though it had been stolen from the Palace of Versailles, the floor covered by an expensive oriental rug. The place was huge, as big as the average apartment, and richly furnished. Outside, on a veranda, was a rose garden, where Mabel grew her own plants. Overall, Delia found the actresses to be totally different to what she’d expected. She thought they were overly familiar with each other, and hugged and kissed more often than Americans ought to. She was also somewhat distressed at Mabel’s habit of putting her hand on her leg, when she spoke to her. The girls slouched and sprawled in their chairs, with their legs an unladylike distance apart. It was all too ‘French’ for Delia, but it did prove that they were, after all, human beings and not avatars dropped from heaven.\n\nWay Down East.\n\nOver the next couple of years, I continued to send stories to Sennett, and, in the meantime, I increased my connections with other producers. My screenplays got more and more attention from the studios, and I became an adviser to some of them, ferreting out suitable locations. Then, Mabel ran away, straight into the welcoming arms of Sam Goldwyn. She’d relocated to New York / New Jersey, and before long, I myself became a regular trans-continental traveller. Come June 1917, and Uncle Sam came a-calling, and I was shipped out along with Mabel’s brother, Claude, and a million others, to get the mud of the Somme between our teeth. In the run up to the war, Mabel had led a national anti-war campaign, but now she was on the campaign trail to sell war bonds with the famous ‘Buy a Bond, And Get A Kiss From Mabel’ Tour. She sold as many bonds as Chaplin, Pickford and Fairbanks combined, and was all ‘kissed-out’ by the end.\n\nDuring the aftermath of the war, in France, in December 1918, I was fortunate enough to see the final release of the film Mickey, which Mabel had made at her Mabel Normand Studio. Later, on my return to New York, I found everyone singing and whistling the song Mickey, which some wise guy had released, and made himself a million bucks. Mickey was the sensation of the century, and movie tycoon, Adolph Zukor, later told me it had grossed eighteen-million dollars. On another front, I received divorce papers from Delia’s attorney – we’d been struck with the Hollywood disease – distrust. Delia cited various affairs with different New York Follies Girls, including Olive Thomas, and Marilyn Miller. All I can say is “Chance would be a fine thing!” I now became involved with Sam Goldwyn of duck-walk fame, back in New York, and it wasn’t because Mabel was still at the studio, although I did run into her often. Importantly, I met a certain Will Rogers at Sam’s studio, a vaudevillian cowboy turned film actor, with whom I would have a lucrative business relationship later.\n\nLink: The ‘Mickey’ song\n\nHe’d also done shows at The Follies on Broadway. On the Mabel front, there was the perennial problem of getting near her, for, as usual, she was always surrounded by doting beauties, and no small number of beasts. Another actress, called Geraldine Farrar, thought she could form her own rival ‘gang’ in the studio. Geri, though, cheated somewhat, as being a lesbian, she brought her ‘acquaintances’ in from outside, who we called ‘Geri-flappers’. No-one knows who balanced the bucket of water, laced with green dye, on Geri’s dressing room door, but she blamed Mabel for ruining her $3,000 Parisian dress. The Goldwyn Girl was hauled in front of Judge Sam, who demanded an explanation. Mabel sat up on Sam’s desk, and twinkled her legs and fluttered her eyelashes. Sam still demanded an explanation. With no more ado, Mabel reached into her bag, drew out $5,000, and threw it across the desk, saying “If she’s that fucking hard up, she can fucking well have this!” Mabel, I can say, was like a child in a sweet shop where money was concerned, and gave more away than she ever spent on herself. Even more improvident was Jack Pickford, Mabel’s old partner in crime at Biograph – little Jack Pickford, no longer little, and the heart-throb of Hollywood. I can remember the day Jack joined us at the studio, and Mabel was as excited as a small girl who’d just met Tom Sawyer. I always say that Mabel only ever loved one man – Charlie Chaplin, but Jack ran him a close second. It was on that very day that Mabel’s brother Claude came to the studio, like me, fresh from the war. It was his birthday, and Mabel had a present for him – the latest model Indian V-twin motorcycle. We were all jealous, I can tell you, and the studio capitalised on the meeting of Jack, Mabel and Claude.\n\nThe photographers put Jack on the bike, with Mabel behind, her adoring arms wrapped around the younger Pickford. Some people say they renewed their relationship at this time. Total nonsense I say, for Jack was then married to Olive Thomas, and Mabel adored Ollie, who was, furthermore, her friend. This bike meet reminded me of the time that Chaplin was asked by Mack Sennett, if he’d ever ridden a motorcycle. Charlie lied, and said he had. The scene was set up with Charlie at the handlebars of the Thor IV, with the precious Mabel on the back. Charlie got the machine going for a few yards, then cracked the throttle wide open. The thing reared up, and went into a hundred-foot wobble, before crashing to the ground at fifty per. Mabel was flung like a rag doll into a ditch, and they later found Charlie’s mortal remains, wrapped up in the remnants of the cycle. Afterwards, Charlie claimed poverty, and Mabel gave him $50 to replace his wrecked frock coat. Charlie never contributed anything towards replacing Mabel’s $1,000 suit, which demonstrates, I suppose, how cheap Charlie really was. Claude, it turned out, had got himself a job as a cameraman. Mabel warned Claude and I against ever being tempted to go in front of the camera. Our lives would be hell, and it was far better to shoot a camera, then return home, content with a few dollars. I took her advice.\n\nGoldwyn was a strange bird, a loner, who never learned to speak English properly. He brought in stars at vast expense, stage plays at equally vast expense, and he spent a fortune on publicity. He spent little on adaption for the screen, and I had untold arguments with him about skimping on the screenplays. All the Goldwyn stars suffered, although Mabel pulled through unscathed, but only due to her unshakeable fan base. Was Mabel still the Queen? I put the question to Madge Kennedy, who shared Mabel’s exotic dressing room at Goldwyn for three years:\n\n“Carl, we were all Queens, at one time or another, but Mabel was different – she was a Goddess.”\n\nMy conclusion about Goldwyn, is that he staked everything on publicity, and it is clear that most of the photos and articles of Mabel date, not from her Keystone days, but from her time at Goldwyn. It was in 1919 that the big producers had plans to put an end to the Biograph and Vitagraph Old Girls’ hold on Hollywood power. The girls and their male counterparts had forced up pay to unsustainable levels, and the big-shots intended to collectively end the star system for good. They were thwarted, at the eleventh hour, by that creation of Chaplin, Pickford, Griffith and Fairbanks, the United Artists distribution company. Goldwyn remained in favour of the star system, so there were now five studios against the big boys.\n\nTinsel Town Beckons Again.\n\nI was now pretty much established, and well known, in the movie industry, and the future looked good. I’d got in with Pathe, and was to eventually become Editor-In-Chief of their newsreel division. This meant I got close (but not personal) with the gorgeous blond Pearl White, a dark girl who wore a blond wig. Mabel left for Goldwyn’s L.A. studio, and I followed, for another stint in Tinseltown. 1920 turned out to be a bad time for the Hollywooders, for, in that year, we lost Clarine Seymour, Bobby Harron and the Queen Flapper, Olive Thomas. Mabel was most distressed by Olive’s untimely death, and became dangerously sick.\n\nDoctors pronounced that she would die within weeks, a victim of Spanish flu, which had caused a resurgence in her tuberculosis. Someone engaged a private nurse, actually a Catholic nun, by the name of Julia Brew, and Mabel recovered. It was in early 1921 that Mabel had suddenly disappeared from Goldwyn, and re-emerged at Mack Sennett Studios. It transpired that Goldwyn was afraid Mabel might die under his contract, in which circumstance fingers would certainly be pointed in his direction. To his credit, Sam had created a trust fund for Mabel with 6-week’s pay that Mabel had failed to collect, and he’d thereafter stopped $1,000 a week from her salary, which he added to the fund. His fear was that the spendthrift Mabel would end up penniless on the streets, should her career falter. In around August 1921, I was sitting in Levy’s L.A. café with my latest girlfriend, when a sudden commotion occurred behind me. A knot of people had gathered and others were leaving their tables to join the throng. I heard the words “Mabel, Mabel, Mabel” Mabel was back in town, fresh from Greenwich Village, where she had been recovering from another illness. Then, we were decanted straight into the Fatty Arbuckle murder scandal, and no sooner than we’d recovered from the shock, than Mabel was involved in the W.D. Taylor murder. For myself, I’d got involved deeply with writing for Will Rogers, who’d taken Hollywood by storm. Will’s live shows were popular, and he’d determined to say something about the Taylor shooting, as he thought Mabel was being given a rough ride. What he’d planned, I thought, would not work in the right way. At the show, he ran onto the stage and started thus:\n\n“There were two shootings in downtown L.A. today – Mabel Normand must be in town!”\n\nThe audience was in stitches with laughter, including Mabel herself. Will designated me his permanent writer, and we got along famously. Will Hays came to town to clean the place up, and everything carried on as before, except some of the press were labelling Will Rogers ‘The most dangerous man alive’, due to his much-publicised political views. In the meantime, I made the film The Headless Horseman with Will, a film I both wrote and produced. I then departed for Europe, in around September 1922, my ship passing Mabel’s as she returned from her own European tour. I spent several weeks seeking out location in England, France, and Italy. I was back in Naples, Italy in February 1923, searching out suitable locations for a love story and a gangster film. While there, I took a holiday and wrote the adaptation for Six-cylinder Love, which was shot and released that year. I’d also met up with Robert J. Flaherty, and worked on his film Nanook of The North, and organised its release by Pathe, as the first feature-length documentary. A down point was when I heard that one of the Henderson brothers had been killed testing a prototype bike – the ‘Ace’. The old Henderson set-up had passed to Excelsior. I continued as a consultant for various studios, and had just about as much work as I could handle, including advising on the Wally Reid car-racing films, as well as on some Sennett motorcycle scenes. Edna Purviance’s A Woman of Paris, and Mabel’s Extra Girl were released that year, and, while Edna’s film more or less bombed, Mabel’s film was hailed as the equal of her first feature, Mickey.\n\nWhat happened then? Mabel’s chauffeur shot Edna Purviance’s millionaire boyfriend, Courtland Dines, that’s what happened. All hell broke loose again, and Mabel made a run for the stage. Al Woods, who was producing Mabel’s play, rang me, and said that Mabel had requested that I look the script over, and make any adaptations necessary to suit hers style. Well, I’d adapted plays for film, but I’d never adapted a stage play for the stage!\n\nAnyhow, I had many deadlines running at the time, so I had to decline. Mabel went off on her nationwide tour, supported by her nurse, and screen and stage legend, Alla Nazimova. The show played to packed houses, but the critics lambasted the play itself, which needed some serious work. As I moved into a new house on Vine Street Hollywood, Mabel moved from her bohemian pad on West Seventh, clutching the 3-million she’d made that year, to a movie star mansion on Camden Drive, Beverly Hills, which cost an astonishing $20,000. Just to prove she’d settled at the fireside, she bought a pair of slippers and a rocking chair. No longer would she be the gad-about-town. This lasted about three minutes, before complaints rolled in to the BH Police office about riotous parties on Camden. I attended some of them, but found that teetotaller Charlie Chaplin and myself were the only sober ones in the house. That’s Hollywood, folks!\n\nTo be Continued: The next instalment will follow later, in which Clancy tells of how he forged a successful link with Will Rogers, and how he bridged the change from silents to talkies.\n\nBibliography\n\nMotorcycle Adventurer: Carl Stearns Clancy, The First Motorcyclist to Ride Around the World. 1912 -1913 by Dr. Gregory W.

They were always the uncivilised, vicious savages that killed and scalped the white man. Notably, the palefaces always won in the end, after the ‘savages’ had bit the dust. While Biograph’s Griffith can be praised for his film The Squaws Love 1911, in which there are only red men (or whites reddened up) it is notable that the ‘savages’ fight each other, without any prompting from the palefaces. As usual, then, Griffith is using minorities as figures to be feared, distrusted and somewhat hated. The film itself, has just about everything an audience could want – love, violence, comradeship and mild savagery. For those that had followed the career of Mabel Normand at The Vitagraph, this film was manna from heaven. Mabel, suitably darkened up, is the star of the show, even though she is the smallest in the cast, and, we must say, she is simply lovely as the classic Indian squaw. What the audience did not generally realise, though, was that the average Indian squaw looked nothing like Mabel. Anyone that has seen Minnie Devereaux (Minnie Ha Ha) will know what this means. Of course, Mabel began in pictures playing an Indian at Kalem, but these movies included the dreaded cowboys that chased them uphill and down dale all day long. It was exhausting, dusty, and unpleasant work, and Mabel soon returned to the more sedate career of modelling. We can presume that she jumped at the chance of this particular role, however, as romance, jumping off cliffs, and swimming in Cuddebackville’s swollen, rock-strew Neversink River were just her thing.\n\nMabel, as everyone knows, was the action girl of Biograph, and as Mary Pickford said in 1916:\n\n“There was no cliff so high that Mabel was afraid of it, no water so deep that she would not dive into it, no bucking bronco too wild for her to ride …….. and no-one could do it more gracefully and with as much poise as Mabel.”\n\nWe can imagine that the whole company turned out to watch the memorable action scenes in this film.\n\nOut in Cuddebackville\n\nThe film is tied in with D.W. Griffith’s decision to abandon the old Biograph stomping ground of Fort Lee, N.J. which he thought to be played out by 1909. Cuddebackville, New York State, had everything; rolling green fields, mountains, rivers and crags. Thus, was Cuddebackville chosen for film work, just as Griffith ended his first year of directing. The information on producing films in this new location comes from Linda Griffith’s book of 1925, When The Movies Were Young, a volume worth keeping on your coffee table. One advantage of Cuddebackville was that it was relatively free of tourists, meaning getting lodgings was easy, and they would be little disturbed by ‘rubber-neckers’. However, when the much-enlarged company arrived on their third visit, the little village was shaken to the core by the appearance of this gang of strange, painted acting folk. Griffith was driven from the rail station to the Cuddeback Inn, while the hoi polloi jumped the luggage wagon or walked behind. Among the hoi polloi was master-bassist Mack Sennett, who, along with Wally Walthall, and Arthur Johnson, supplied the evening entertainment — when he wasn’t grouching.\n\nThe Cast: In this film, Mabel plays the squaw White Flower, Alfred Paget is Gray Fox, Dark Cloud: White Eagle, Claire McDowell: Silver Fawn, Wm. J. Butler: Father, Kate Bruce: Mother. Lesser Indians: Edwin August, Donald Crisp, Grace Henderson, Wilfred Lucas, Dorothy West.\n\nInteresting facts about the cast: Alfred Paget was an English actor, who’d fought in the Boer War. Dark Cloud was a genuine red Indian, who’d fled the reservations for the movies. Claire McDowell remained in movies for another 30 odd years, and appeared in 350 films. Wilfred Lucas was a prolific Biograph actor, who became Griffith’s right-hand man, and it was ‘The Great Lucas’, as Mabel called him, who prevented Mabel from running away on her first day at the Biograph. Kate Bruce was the ‘old maid’ at the studio, and was informal chaperone and agony aunt to the fledgling starlets. She appeared in 300 films. Dorothy West, appeared in 126 films, and her career ended in 1916. Mrs Griffith told her husband that Dorothy was too ugly to be in movies:\n\n“My dear” said the genius “Our cameras are now so good they make everyone look beautiful.”\n\nThe Film.\n\nThe plot is as follows: White Eagle is in love with Silver Fawn. Wild Flower is the daughter of The Chief, and she is in love with Gray Fox. As is usual in Mabel films, the Chief is none too happy about the love affair, and sends Gray Fox away, after an Indian posse give him a good beating with staves. Gray Fox meets up with White Eagle, who is away hunting. White Eagle agrees to go and meet with White Flower, and bring her to Gray Fox. Unfortunately, Silver Fawn sees White Eagle and White Flower going off into the woods together, and, being suspicious, she follows. White Flower and Silver Fawn, armed with a big knife, fight it out on a cliff, and White Flower gets thrown over the cliff and lands in the raging river, where she is rescued by Gray Fox (who is on the run from another Indian group) in a canoe, just as she enters the dangerous rapids. The old chief, is furious that the two lovers are together again, and he orders their deaths. In the meantime, Silver Fawn has learned the truth about White Flower and White Eagle, but now, the four friends are being pursued by the execution party in canoes. While the men faint away in fear, Indian brave White Flower, leaps into the river, with a knife between her teeth, and slashes the pursuers canoe open, and sinks the vessel. An interesting scene occurs towards the end of the film, when Mabel is paddled off in a canoe, and is filmed with a smug, satisfied expression on her face, indicating, perhaps, that she’d achieved the status of Queen, not of the Indians, but of Biograph.\n\nSumming up the film.\n\nThis was never meant to be a great film, but merely one of the hundreds of ordinary short films produced by Biograph. Griffith called the picture an Indian love poem in pictures. Well, that’s a big claim to live up to, but he achieved this by casting a lead who was actually, herself, poetry in motion. Mabel Normand always glided rather than walked, but in this film her separate movements are seamless, which is obviously what you would expect from a noble savage. She jumps in and out of canoes in one unhesitating movement, and almost seems to pour herself into the boats. If this seems easy, just try hauling yourself from a river into an almost two-foot high boat. It can be done, but there would not be anything ladylike, or indeed, gentlemanly about it. There is little to say, about Mabel’s fearlessness and ability in the water, as this is all well documented. Did Mabel make a good squaw? In Griffith-world, yes, she did. Griffith wasn’t looking for authenticity, he already had a real-life Indian on board, but Mabel had certain features that qualified her for the part. Knowing that whoever played the part would be ‘blacked up’, he needed someone whose personality would shine through, and Mabel had big white eyes and big white teeth, like torches in the night. Well, Mabel was often the hissing Biograph villainess, someone who’d steal your boyfriend, and jam a stiletto between your ribs, but in this film, Griffith chose Claire McDowell to pursue Mabel and run her through. Naturally, Miss McDowell was no looker, but she made a more plausible Indian for this reason (definitely more plausible than Stanhauser’s Pochohontas, Anna Rosemond).\n\nThe Critics View: How did the critics perceive this film? Beyond praising Mabel, they found the whole thing laughable, and the lack of inter-titles made the film confusing and somewhat unintelligible. Many could not understand how Indians could be fighting Indians – where were the palefaces? The fact is that, by 1911, we are beyond the period of the Indian wars, and very few film/theatre critics had been to a reservation, let alone seen a redskin in his natural environment, and, consequently, did not understand that the native Indians were not a nation. Historically, they were constantly at war with each other, and we need look no further than Francis Parkman’s book, The Oregon Trail of 1849, to find Indians making internecine war. Parkman points out that the plains Indians had little access to timber, and once a year they’d trek to the Black Hills to gather poles for their wigwams and other necessities. The problem was that the Black Hills were visited by many tribes, and if one tribe caught a member of another tribe in the hills, they’d be immediately dispatched. The Crow were particularly fond of burning their enemies on bonfires.\n\nMabel’s Performance: Who was it that got thrown off the cliff? Was it really Mabel? Mary Pickford always maintained that her brother Jack always did the girl’s stunts, but in this film, it looks as though Mabel really did launch off that cliff. Conversely, in Mabel At The Wheel (1914) it is plainly obvious that it is a man that falls off the back of Chaplin’s motorcycle.\n\nIn a way, the stolen love tale is similar to many other Mabel vehicles at Biograph (Mender of Nets, Eternal Mother etc), but Mack Sennett later kept her away from love triangles on the screen. It seems, however, that illicit love was in Mabel’s blood, for, once temporarily away from Mack, she played a scarlet woman in He Did And He Didn’t alongside Roscoe Arbuckle. Of course, her off-screen love triangles eventually hit the headlines big time. In the event, we can probably say that Mabel’s appearance in the film saved it from being a ‘bomber’. It does take, however, more than big eyes and big teeth to make an Indian.\n\nInteresting thoughts.\n\nMabel’s falling off a cliff scene is not just dangerous, but beyond what was either required or necessary. The scene itself is dangerously complicated, and we have to wonder why Griffith did not opt for the classic cowboy jump-off-a-cliff scene, where the pursued simply runs off the edge. The risks can be easily calculated, and there is a mere ten-percent risk of death. In Mabel’s scene, there is a less than evens chance of survival. The problem is that when Claire pushes Mabel, she does not actually jump or fall into the river – she spends an inordinate length of time trying to regain her footing, before finally pushing off into space. It’s this scrabbling around that makes the scene risky, as there is no guarantee that Mabel will not accidentally fall and be dashed to pieces on the cliff face – that final well-timed push was absolutely necessary. Of course, Claire would have had to remain calm throughout, and be sure that Mabel would not panic and make a grab for her, thereby taking them both to their inevitable deaths. It is clear, though, that Mabel, even at this early stage, was the consummate professional, and her all-action reputation, among the other actresses, possibly stemmed from this film. Her timing and poise were simply perfection.\n\nQuite why Griffith took such a complicated, convoluted story and committed it to silent film, without adequate inter-titles is a complete mystery. The reason isn’t that we’re so dumb today, as the critics at the time could not work the plot out at the one viewing. Griffith seems to have screwed up, perhaps thinking that his genius would inevitably shine through. However, with Mabel riding the crest of a wave of popularity from Vitagraph to Biograph, she was quite prepared to give all, for this love and war picture.\n\nIt has been said that there are underwater scenes of Mabel swimming deep in the river with a knife between her teeth. On the available DVD version, it seems this footage does not appear. Mabel, of course, was always equally at home in the water, as on land, and, like a female Huckleberry Finn, she abandoned school, not for the Mississipi river, but for the Hudson.\n\nIt has always been a mystery as to why Griffith handed his greatest tragedienne and action-girl, Mabel, over to Mack Sennett’s comedy unit. The answer may be found in this film. In some scenes, she is the classic Griffith girl (think Gish and Sweet) but, in other scenes, she seems to have taken control, so that her personality shines through, and we might suggest that certain details of the cliff fall scene were her idea. The chauvinistic Griffith found Mabel difficult to handle on set and on location, but Sennett simply let Mabel be Mabel during the shoot, then made cuts in the middle of her scenes during editing. It was less trouble that way.\n\nWhat did Mabel think of the film? Well, Mabel was the consummate tragedienne, and we might suppose that the tragic story of Running Bear and Little White Dove, where the lovers are swept away by the raging river, would have suited her better.\n\nLink: ‘Running Bear’ song.\n\nTechnical stuff.\n\nThe Squaw’s Love 1911\n\nProducer: The Biograph Company.\n\nDirector: D.W.

In the early days, at studios like The Biograph and the Vitagraph, everyone was on first name terms, and the atmosphere was one of friendly competition. Over-competitiveness was pretty much frowned on, and the statement “Don’t let the old cranium get too inflated, my dear” was commonly heard. At Biograph, however, the legendary D.W. Griffith promoted competition to keep his charges on-side. By early 1912, his stars, including Mary Pickford and Mabel, were given good parts, although he was careful to give lead roles to others, just to keep the regular’s hat sizes in check. This type of behaviour inevitably brought conflict, and when newcomer Mae Marsh was given the lead in Man’s Genesis and The Sands of Dee, Mary, Mabel and Blanche went crazy. Other actresses supported them, and it was at that time that the Biograph girls formed themselves into an unofficial union. Some of the girls, like Mary and Mabel, determined to escape the clutches of the ‘evil genius’ and make their own way, but they were also hell bent on presenting a united front against the producers.\n\nAs the early starlets began to bleed away to California and Florida, they temporarily became separated from each other, but as more and more of them gravitated to Hollywood, they reinforced their union. One can look in vain for examples of the Biograph Girls publicly disrespecting each other – there are none, and producers attempts to break them inevitably failed. By 1916, the girls had acquired immense power in Hollywood, with Mary having her name up in lights, and Mabel her name emblazoned over a studio. Mae Marsh, the Gish sisters, Blanche Sweet and others threw in their lot with Griffith, although Dotty Gish and Blanche gave Griffith hell, as the genius needed them, more than they needed him.\n\nNew Girls on the Block\n\nBy 1915, the queens of Hollywood were in a position to help any new actresses that they thought worthy of their attention. Out at the local dump, commonly known as Keystone, a new wardrobe lady came to the studio, and she had a young daughter, Bebe Daniels. Mabel Normand was Empress in those days, and she was a monarch that was very fond of children, and so she inevitably took an interest in the 14-year old Bebe. Bebe was interested in the movies, and Mabel arranged for her to appear in her own little private films. Unfortunately, Mabel was then in dispute with Sennett, about the emergence of The Bathing Beauties, and she had the brilliant idea of dressing Bebe up in a swimsuit and filming her. As Sennett states in his book, he ran screaming from his office demanding that the film crew ‘cease and desist, before the ‘thought police’ invaded the lot. Now, Bebe could have decided to hang around the lot and get properly into Sennett films, but mother decided that Bebe could become a protégé of Mabel, and people would always say that Bebe had been given a hand up. Consequently, Bebe moved on, and never appeared in a Keystone, not even as a Bathing Beauty.\n\nIn the meantime, another girl, Bessie Love, had come to Hollywood, and found a berth at the Griffith studio. Here she met up with Blanche Sweet, who formed a long-lasting friendship with the younger starlet. We might consider that some of Griffith’s stars, like the inscrutable Dotty Gish, looked at Bessie as a rather feeble, elfin creature. Dotty, of course, had been part of the Mabel Normand Biograph gang, back in the day. All good-looking, sweet girls, they took no nonsense from Griffith, who Dotty called, with some political incorrectness, ‘a hook-nosed Kike’, even to his face. Innocent on the outside, these girls were as tough of old boots – when there were no cameras in range. Mabel herself, was not so enamoured with ‘the elf’ and Griffith only brought Bessie to Keystone, for Triangle celebrations, while Mabel was away in New York. As far as Mabel was concerned, anyone that tied themselves to Griffith, and allowed him to change their name, was a jerk, or, in her terms, a ‘crawl-ass’. Mabel put Dotty’s sister, Lillian, into this category, and she was not surprised when the genius later dumped his loyal player, believing that he could survive without her. He was wrong, for on that very day D.W.’s career effectively ended.\n\nIt was through Blanche Sweet that Bessie met Bebe Daniels. Blanche, as we know, had been a close associate of Mabel, and had even spent a total of around two years, on and off, living with her. Due to Mabel’s odd and unpredictable behaviour (she would often wander around the house all night) Blanche eventually drifted slightly apart from Mabel, and was happy to acquire friends that were more, shall we say, stable. In any event, Mabel was, it seems, turning a little crazy, associating with bohemians, and refusing to move into a Hollywood mansion (she did, but briefly, rent a mansion). Bessie and Bebe, like Blanche, had stage mothers, who themselves got on well. Mabel was a loose cannon that had no stage mother, nor husband, nor anyone that could stabilise her life. Until 1926, she saw men, not as potential husbands, but as a source of those shiny, glittering objects we call diamonds. Bessie Love became dubious about men, following Blanche’s marriage to Marshall Neilan, which left her so often sporting black eyes. Consequently, Bessie married late, for those times, in 1929. For the same reason, Bebe left it until the following year to marry. Bessie, unfortunately, married purely for love, although Bebe’s new spouse, Ben Lyon, was the Hollywood heart-throb, and she knew he could help her in her failing career. Bebe, incidentally, had been a ‘bad girl’ publicly, while Mabel was ‘bad’ in private. The Keystone Girl could never be anything, but innocent and wholesome — the real Mabel packed a gun, swore like a trooper, drank like a fish, and loved nothing better than a love triangle. Bessie? Bessie was, well, just Bessie, a fluffy bunny.\n\nIn 1930, Bebe sailed off for England with the ex-pat British actress Dorothy Mackaill, of bee-stung lips fame. Dotty was going home to pick up her mother, and bring her back to Hollywood. Bebe was happy to get a holiday, but she also was looking for new opportunities in her career, as the old silent performers were bound to go out of vogue. Over the following few years, things were looking bleak for those becoming old in Hollywood. The homicide and suicide rates were rising exponentially, and Chicago and New York mobsters infiltrated Sunset Boulevard, looking for la dolce vita. Displaced ‘Okies’ were also invading the land of orange groves, while kidnap was becoming a lucrative source of money for villains, and they were definitely not of the Keystone variety. By the mid-1930s, both Bebe and Bessie had children, and the former gay flappers had a more serious outlook on life. When Bessie’s marriage failed in 1935, she knew where to go, and headed to London with her daughter, and mother. There was nothing for them in Hollywood, any more. Bessie, however, being single, found the going tough, but she was determined to make it all work, even though few in the London studios had heard of her! The names that slipped from their tongues were the obvious ones – Pickford, Chaplin and Normand et al. Bebe arrived in London a while later, and was best placed to start afresh, as she had the support of Ben, who’d gained work in London. Blanche Sweet, by the way, stayed on in Hollywood, not wishing to move on. Like a good many silent stars, she ended her working life behind the counter of a department store, forgotten and unloved.\n\nBy 1939, WW2 had begun, and the U.S. government virtually insisted that their citizens leave England – pronto. Bessie and Bebe, however, had no intention of leaving – bombs or no bombs. Bessie was never as out-going as Bebe, and found herself with little work, but put herself forward for war duties. She was politely informed that, being a citizen of a neutral country, they could not (dare not) use her. Bessie finally got work as a (deputy) continuity girl for £5 ($25) a week, making war films. After 6 months she qualified for a week’s holiday, which she took in Scotland. Bebe and Ben had landed a radio show, Hi Gang!, and Bebe even starred in a stage play. Bebe became famous for admitting an air raid warden to her Park Lane apartment, after he’d had his leg blown off by a bomb explosion. He left three pints of his blood behind on Bebe’s carpet. All along Bessie and Bebe stayed in touch, although they moved in different circles. During the war, Bebe returned home briefly, then came back, while Bessie stayed on without a break. It was during the war that a hero of the Special Air Services, George Daniels, was nicknamed ‘Bebe’ by his comrades, which demonstrates that Bebe was a household name by the 1940s. It was while Bebe and Bessie were in England, during 1940, that Mabel’s life was being celebrated back in Hollywood with The Night of A Thousand Stars, during which the ‘Mabel Normand Sound Stage’ was officially opened and a memorial plaque to The Madcap was unveiled. For her own part, Bebe received, post-war, The Medal of Freedom from President Truman, in recognition of her war work — Bessie, of course, as a continuity girl, was invisible during the conflict. More Americans were in London during the war than might be expected. One was comedian Vic Oliver (like Hitler, born in Austria), who said, during the Blitz “Every night I leave home and go to my shelter. It’s a lovely shelter — so quiet you can hear a bomb drop.” In 1940, Bebe was asked what she knew about Italy “All I know ” She said “Is it’s shaped like a boot, and run by a heel.”\n\nPost-war, both Bessie and Bebe found work aplenty in the movies, on the radio, and on the up and coming T.V. shows. Bebe and Ben had an amazingly successf"
