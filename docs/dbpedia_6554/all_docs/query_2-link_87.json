        "text": "Chapter 10\n\n_______________________________\n\nThe Final Years, 19751977\n\nBing had been tempted back into the recording studios by producer Ken Barnes and quickly made three albums with him in London. He also made two LPs, which he financed himself, and during an extended stay in the U.K. in the summer of 1975, he made many appearances on radio and television shows. His appetite for show business seemed to have returned and then he decided to give a series of concerts to celebrate his fifty years as an entertainer. Starting in California, and then coming across to the London Palladium for a two-week stint, his performances were a revelation to many, including the author, and Bing was clearly enjoying himself.\n\nThe opening of the show in London was clever, featuring as it did a 1944 newsreel of Bing singing at the opening of the Stage Door Canteen. The screen then lifted away, the orchestra played the opening bars of Where the Blue of the Night, and Bing Crosby himself walked onto the stage to tumultuous applause. In unusually high temperatures, he was on stage at the Palladium for most of the two and a half hour show and he wound up with a thirty-five minute medley of his old hits, with the audience joining in enthusiastically, before closing with the song Thats What Life Is All About.\n\nBing returned to New York for another two weeks of appearances. Then in March 1977, near tragedy struck when he fell off the stage at the end of a concert in Pasadena. Bing ruptured a disc at the base of his spine and his recovery was slow. However, to everyones surprise, at the last moment he agreed to continue with another tour of the U.K. in August, and despite being in pain with his back, the somewhat frail Bing again gave some memorable performances, although, to the authors ear, his voice did not seem as strong.\n\nHe then flew to Spain for a few days golf. . . .\n\n1975\n\nJanuary 3, Friday. Bing writes to Mrs. Jean Pochna in East Dennis, Massachusetts.\n\nDear Jean:\n\nThanks for your letter and Christmas card.\n\nI have written the Bennington College authorities asking for some literature or catalogs or brochures about the college.\n\nMy daughter, Mary Frances, is keenly interested in pursuing the dramatic part of the theatre. Although she has been 9 or 10 years with the ballet, she doesnt aspire to ever becoming a ballerina, and is only taking classes now to keep in shape and to be sure that she doesnt lose touch with the art.\n\nDelighted to hear that your two children are doing so well, and Im going to have to look up the W. C. Fields book if there are some things in it from Morrow.\n\nPoor Bill. How we miss him! He was a marvelous man.\n\nI hope this finds you in abundant good health \n\nWarmest best wishes, Bing\n\nJanuary 5, Sunday. The Crosby family flies from Las Cruces to San Francisco.\n\nJanuary 16, Thursday. Begins recording the A Southern Memoir album at T.T.G. Studios in Hollywood with Paul Smith and his Orchestra. Bing eventually leases the tracks to English Decca following negotiations with producer Geoff Milne.\n\nCrosby can be sampled on his own to pleasant effect in A Southern Memoir which in conformity with its title is a relaxed, easy-going selection of numbers from below the Mason-Dixon Line\n\n(The Gramophone, February, 1976)\n\nIn 1975, Bing was encouraged by John Scott Trotter (who had been a long-time friend of Geoff Milnes) to talk to him about Decca in the UK issuing the Southern Memoir tracks which Bing had recorded at his own expense in January 1975 and which no record company seemed interested in picking up. Naturally, Geoff was delighted to become involved and he recalled that the negotiations were with Bing direct and were very relaxed as Bing didnt drive a particularly hard bargain. He always found Bing warm and friendly.\n\n(Malcolm Macfarlane, Milne Magic, BING magazine, summer, 2005 [#140])\n\nThis collection of Southern-cum-mammy type songs was a pet project of Bings and his affection for the material reveals itself time and again throughout each of the twelve songs. The small-band backings arranged by pianist-conductor Paul Smith are beautifully written and very well played. Bing sings with greater spirit and drive than on his album with Basie and some of the tracks, notably Carolina in the Morning, Swanee, and Sailing Down the Chesapeake Bay stand comparison with some of his best-ever up-tempo performances. There is also a finely sung On the Alamo with seldom-heard verse and a beautiful Sleepy-Time Down South. The tongue-in-cheek Where the Morning Glories Grow has a highly humorous Lombardo-style arrangement but the song itself is hardly worth the time that Crosby and Smith spent on it. At the other end of the spectrum there is a wild rock arrangement of Georgia on My Mind which, though well played and sung, is an equal waste of time in an album of this sort. But these two last tracks apart, the combination of Crosby and Smith (and one should not overlook the latters brilliant piano-playing) is sheer magic.\n\n(Ken Barnes, The Crosby Years, page 98)\n\nJanuary 19, Sunday. The American Sportsman program on ABC-TV features Bing, Phil Harris and Curt Gowdy as they pursue Canadian geese on the Delmarva Peninsula in Maryland.\n\nJanuary 21, Tuesday. Completes the recording of the A Southern Memoir album at T.T.G. Studios in Hollywood with Paul Smith and his Orchestra.\n\nJanuary 22, Wednesday. Bing drives down for the Pro-Am Clambake at the Monterey County Fair Grounds. No-Host cocktails at 6 p.m., Dinner at 7 p.m. and the show at 8 p.m.\n\nJanuary 23-26, ThursdaySunday. Bing attends the thirty-fourth Bing Crosby National Pro-Am and returns to his role as a commentator in the television coverage. Gene Littler is the winner. The tournament sets an all-time gate receipt record of nearly $600,000. The cost for commercial TV sponsorship is about $40,000 for each minute, producing gross revenues of almost $1m for ABC. The bill for 3M alone was over $300k. Celebrities playing include Andy Williams, Pat Boone, Ernie Ford, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., George C. Scott, Oleg Cassini, Jack Lemmon, Robert Stack, Clint Eastwood, Hank Ketcham and Glen Campbell. Bing's nephew, Howard Crosby (5 handicap), plays with the pro Bob Eastwood. Bing and Kathryn drop in at the house occupied by Francis Brown and Winona Love for drinks on the Friday night. On the Saturday night, Bing and Ray Herzog (CEO of 3M) host the annual cocktail party in the Del Monte Lodge library. Bing is presented with a sculpture commemorating his famous hole-in-one at the 16th at Cypress Point.\n\nFirst stop was San Francisco, where I shook off the dirt from my spikes and played a few holes with Uncle Bing at his nearby club, the Burlingame Country Club. I dont recall much about the round, except how warm it was in the Bay Area after the winter blizzards in Spokane. Then I trekked on down to Carmel, and settled into Mary Roses spare bedroom for the duration. It was an idyllic time for a 22year old fresh college graduate. Every day was golf from dawn to dusk, hit practice balls, practice putting, then play Pebble Beach or Cypress Point, then come home to a fabulous home cooked meal from a darling Aunt, who took great delight in the copious quantities of food I could ingest.\n\nA couple of days before the pros and celebrities arrived, Uncle Bing showed up in town, and called to see if I wanted to meet him at Cypress for a bit of golf the next day. Of course I was up for that, so we planned to meet at the Pro Shop at 7:30 the next morning. When I got there, Uncle Bing was already sitting on the trunk of his car, changing into his golf shoes. Then he asked the assistant pro if there were any caddies who could play a bit .and he said there were a couple of single digit handicappers back there. So Bing hired the two kids to fill out a foursome, plus two more to carry bags, and away we went. I remember thinking at the time that there were undoubtedly hundreds of the wealthiest, most prominent citizens of Carmel/Pebble Beach who would have loved to be in that foursome with Bing Crosby, and here he goes and hires a couple of caddies. How typical of Bing.\n\n(Howard Crosby, Bings nephew, writing in BING magazine, winter, 2003)\n\nJanuary 28, Tuesday. In Las Vegas to rehearse with Paul Smith, Bing has a walk-on appearance on the Merv Griffin show and receives a standing ovation.\n\nJanuary 29, Wednesday. Bing flies to La Paz, Las Cruces, Los Planes and Guadalajara and has to endure dreadful weather all the way.\n\nFebruary 8, Saturday. Bing writes to Ken Barnes in detail about the forthcoming recording sessions in London.\n\nI got two cassettes with a lot of material on them relating to the songs were to do there in London, and they were very helpful to me. I have a few suggestions which Id like you to relay to Pete Moore.\n\nHe mentioned in the cassettes that he was thinking of doing Heat Wave and I Got Rhythm in the style of the record which you played on the cassette of Johnny Mercer singing Somethings Got To Give.\n\nThis might be all right for I Got Rhythm, but I have a different conception of Heat Wave. I think Heat Wave should open very softly and sneaky. Vamp. And Id like to do the verse, of course, on this.\n\nThe other song, I Got Rhythm, I think should open with just a rim shot or maybe a 16th note chord with the brass, and then start very soft accompaniment underneathfast, very fast rhythm, and the band can build toward the end, something in the style of the arrangement he used for Somethings Got To Give.\n\nI dont believe Id want to use the verse on I Got Rhythm.\n\nHello Dolly should be a gently sweeping type of tempo. Typical stage delivery. Not too much going on underneathjust hold solid chords.\n\nThe repeat endings on some of the songsor what we call the tag over here, are somewhat repetitive. I could change the lyrics in the repeat endings. For instance, like in Just Breezin Along, the second time Id say, Just Wheezin Along although thats not the word eitherbut something like that, and then go back Just Breezin Along and do this with all of them.\n\nI can change the lyrics, of course, but maybe melodically there should be some changes made so that theyre varied and different and not all the same. I think it would be a necessary contrast.\n\nWith regard to Have a Nice Day, I like very much the band accompaniment of John Davidsons record, and I hope you can develop something in that general style.\n\nFrom what Ive heard on the cassettes, it seems to me the whole chore should go along very smoothly, without any problems. The songs are good. I think Pete does wonderful work with the arrangements and youve allotted certainly enough time to do them all.\n\nMaybe after the first session, you might want to do a little more on each session. I just did an album here, and I did six songs quite easily on a three hour session. Of course, it was a small group and wasnt quite as intricate as it would be with a large band.\n\nI note in the schedule you sent me youve omitted Friday, February 21st. Im wondering if theres some reason for this. If the studio is not available, or if its impossible to get the musicians youll require. I certainly dont need a rest or a day off or anything like that, because the more I sing, the easier it is for me.\n\nI say this now, of course, without any knowledge of the engineering set-up you have there in London or what technical problems might be involved. I only know about the schedules that were able to maintain in the United States when recording.\n\nPerhaps we can just see how it goes and if on the first session we find we have time, throw in another one if its ready, and for this purpose, maybe Pete can see that he always has a stand-by number to be knocked off if time allows.\n\nIts quite possible a redubbing session may be necessary on Thursday, February 26th, but I would like to leave London on the 27th, if possible, because I have some things of importance to take care of before the end of the month.\n\nOne further note. I do hope that youll avoid any sort of news release about my being there and that when were recording, the studio will be absolutely clear of everybody except those directly connected with the recording itselfand I include the Control Room. Just you and Pete, the engineer, the band and myself. I find we get a lot more done that way, in a lot less time.\n\nWhen the sessions are concludedmaybe the last day or sowe can have some of the Fan Club people in and play some of the records for them, or Ill sing a couple for them if the band is still there. Maybe at the conclusion of the last session. Its just not possible for me to concentrate and get the work done when there are people watching from all sorts of vantage points.\n\nIve stayed at Claridges quite often, but they always become a bit disturbed when newspaper people bother them with phone calls and come to the lobby and make inquiries about me, so if its possible, I would like to keep it quiet where Im staying. I suppose this will inevitably leak out.\n\nI know I sound like Im a matinee idol or something, but for some reason or other, when Im working there in London, Id just like to be undisturbed.\n\nAll best wishes to you and Pete and your staff,\n\nAs ever, Bing Crosby\n\n(As reproduced in The Crosby Years, pages 42-43)\n\nFebruary 12, Wednesday. Bings brother Larry, age eighty, dies from cancer at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles, and Bing attends his funeral at St. Victors Church, West Hollywood, on February 15.\n\nOn 6 February, I received the following telegram in which Bing confirmed his arrival and flight details.\n\nARRIVE 7.40 AM FEB SEVENTEENTH TWA FLIGHT 760\n\nBING CROSBY\n\nOn 14 February I received a phone call from Bing. Im afraid I wont be coming on the 17th, Ken, he said. I felt a sudden chill on hearing these words. Here was another of Alan Fishers predicted surprises.\n\nAt this point I should explain that, according to the Musicians Union, once a player has been booked for a recording sessioneven though the engagement is purely verbalthat player must be paid whether the session takes place or not. In total the fees for the Crosby sessions would come to something like £5,000 (around 10,000 dollars). Of course, all would not be completely lost because the accompaniments could be recorded and Bing would be able to put his voice on at a later date. But his utter dislike for this manner of recording was well known. He preferred always to record live. I was on the verge of getting rather angry with this man whom I had admired all my life. But I thought: Well, at least he had the decency to phone me. I might as well hear him out. Almost immediately I regretted my anger as Bing explained that his elder brother, Larry, had just died.\n\nThe funerals on Sunday, Bing explained. So I wont be able to fly to London until Monday. But Ill still be able to make the sessions as planned. It just means Ill be arriving a day later than scheduled. If you could meet me at Heathrow Tuesday instead of Monday, Id appreciate it.\n\n(Ken Barnes, The Crosby Years)\n\nFebruary 13, Thursday. CBS air a TV film called Queen of the Stardust Ballroom. Bing watches this and decides to record \"I Love to Dance Like They Used to Dance\" from the score. This is achieved on February 19.\n\nFebruary 15, Saturday. Bing and Kathryn are at St. Victor's Church, West Hollywood for the funeral of Larry Crosby. Gary Crosby is also in attendance.\n\nFebruary 18, Tuesday. Bing arrives at Heathrow airport in London in the early morning to record two albums for United Artists, Thats What Life Is All About and At My Time of Life, which are to be produced by Ken Barnes. He checks in at Claridges at 8:30 a.m. Ken Barnes and Pete Moore pick him up at Claridges at 4:30 p.m. and take him to Chappells where he rehearses songs for the forthcoming albums until 6:30 p.m.\n\nOn February 16th, Bing was sufficiently recovered from his Mexican flights to head on to London for a recording session. From there, he wrote to inform me that he was presently working with a forty-two-man band in an excellent recording facility.\n\nTheyve furnished security, a Rolls, and chauffeurs, he continued. Youd think that Id arrived here to star in a major film.\n\nIm taking long walks daily, and feel fine, except for the lingering cough. A full course of tetracycline afforded no appreciable results, but an inhalant offers temporary relief. Im sure Id sing better without the malady, but the folks at the studio have persisted in being complimentary.\n\nIll be home around the end of the month, after a stop off in New York to see a couple of shows.\n\n(Kathryn Crosby, writing in My Last Years with Bing, page 349)\n\nFebruary 19/20, Wednesday/Thursday. Recording sessions at Chappells, London, with Pete Moore and his Orchestra. Ken Barnes directs the proceedings.\n\nBings back  still stepping out in front\n\nBing Crosby stepped into a London recording studio yesterday and firmly waved away the aids used by pop stars half his age. Instead of going into a protective vocal booth he insisted on standing right out in front with the band. Im a band singer, he said, and I want to sing with them. Thats why I came all this way. His producer Ken Barnes fussed about the strength of his lungs which only a year ago underwent a major operation. Crosby brushed him aside. If the band get louder. he said, I get louder. And he did as he went into his old favourites such as The Best Things In Life Are Free, Breezin' Along with the Breeze and Some Sunny Day. Just as if he did not know what it is to be 73, or to have nearly died under the surgeons knife. He is here to make two LPs. One is to be called Thats What Life Is All About. The other Barnes wanted to call Bing - Back on the Ball. The Old Groaner would not have it. He protested that it was too much like Sinatras Ol Blue Eyes Is Back. Sternly he demanded: What does everyone mean by a comeback? Ive never been away.\n\n(Daily Mirror, February, 20, 1975)\n\nFebruary 22, Saturday. Records five more tracks with Pete Moore and his Orchestra at Chappells. Later, at around 2:20 p.m., appears on Grandstand, a live BBC-TV sports program introduced by Frank Bough, and during this he places a bet on a horse called Uncle Bing which duly wins the 3:00 p.m. race at Kempton Park. He donates his £200 appearance fee to the National Society for Cancer Relief.\n\nFebruary 23, Sunday. Bing presents rosettes at the indoor horse show held at the Priory School of Equitation in Frensham, Surrey.\n\nFebruary 2426, MondayWednesday. More recording sessions at Chappells, London with Pete Moore and his Orchestra. After the recording session on February 26, Bing meets members of the International Crosby Circle in the listening room at Chappells Studio.\n\n. . . Here was a smallish listening-room, equipped with enormous speakers and with plate-glass down one side instead of a wall: as Ken Barnes opened the door there was a flood of high-powered music  with the majestic, so familiar, voice of Bing, so dominant, sounding every bit as great as Ken had assured that it was, with Bing so completely recovered from his severe illness.\n\nAnd as we heard the voice  we saw the man! There was Bing, seen through the plate-glass! Bing singing, in person, at last! At a music-stand, but holding the music in his hands, spread out with that inevitable peaked cap, a cardigan, and a loose-at-the-neck shirt .Bing himself!\n\nBing was two yards to the right of the musical director  Pete Moore, of course  casting a seemingly casual yet knowing and penetrating glance at him every so often musicians in incredible disarray, all fitted with headphones, were at work with the seeming complete ease of the top professionals. By disarray I mean the musicians seemed to be in no coherent pattern as far as brass, reed, strings, piano, harp etc were concerned! The floor was a mass of cables, microphones were everywhere  and yet everyone, especially Bing and Pete, gave the impression everything was fine, everything was going well, everything was going to plan.\n\nWe entered when they were running through the number Yours Sincerely in other words, it wasnt a recording take for Pete Moore was still modifying his arrangement of the song  all arrangements, incidentally, were hand-written specifically for each instrument.\n\nAnd we had some glorious examples, before our very eyes, of the famous ad libbing of which Bing is such a master .\n\nWhat happened to the orchestra? he asked as they came to a thin passage and it seemed the band was deserting Bing!\n\nThats a *** note! complained Bing on another occasion.\n\nThen Bing stood patiently, quizzically, looking from Pete to the musicians while a little discussion went on between them as to how to iron out this *** note.\n\nBut Derek will be playing D sharp while Im playing D natural.\n\nNo, no, says Pete, You come in when Derek has finished  more an overtone . Everybody nodded as if to say: Thats it.\n\nReady now are we? gently says Bing.\n\nOkay Bing, says Pete, will you take it again from the first eight?\n\nSure, says Bing, Ready when you are we double up on tempo then right good! All clear.\n\nArtists of the highest calibre making difficult work look easy: Im sure Ken was delighted in the control-room as we all were in the listening room.\n\nBecause everyone wore headphones they were all in ready, conversational contact with each other, and while Pete discussed points with the strings, say, the rest of the musicians went on playing their own phrases as if making use of the time to perfect things.\n\nI personally could have watched this rehearsing all day, but in a surprisingly short time  not more than half-an-hour  all was ready for a pukka take. This was signalled by an extremely loud bang from the loud-speakers  loud enough indeed, to make one jump from ones chair!\n\nPete Moore held up his hand and got dead silence for about 10 seconds, then gently brought the music to life a short intro from the orchestra, Bing stretched his neck upwards glanced at Pete, an almost indiscernible nod from Pete to Bing and in came Bing, majestic, resonant, full, rich-voiced and straight through to the end. No interruptions, no breaks for discussion a complete and perfect take.\n\nSo absorbing had been the spectacle, that Id barely noticed the other occupants of the listening-room, but with the take safely made, we had time to greet Bob Roberts, our Guinness Book of Records collector, Frank Murphy our former Secretary, inevitably the incredible Leslie Gaylor (I think he must have spent the entire time of Bings visit in London!), Eric Crowder, down from Nottingham post-haste, John Ewens from Essex, and Phil Clarke, up from Southampton. And a tight-fit we were in that listening room. As I explained, recording studios are purely functional!\n\nAfter this full take, the musicians seemed to be taking a break and we saw Bing arrange his scores on his stand and then he began to wend his way through the cables, microphones, instruments and other paraphernalia in our direction\n\nThen he was standing in the doorway:\n\nHullo you folks. Nice of you to come and see me good to see you \n\nI must confess it was rather an overwhelming moment for me. Bing standing there, after all these years, so pleasant looking, so at-ease, so casual (sartorially and otherwise!) In those few fleeting seconds before I stepped forward to shake his hand and bring him the greetings of all ICC members, I found myself thinking, in truly a flash, of all those songs, all those films, Bob Hope, the Andrews Sisters, and goodness knows what else! An incredible experience. What did I say? I cannot be sure but I think I said something to the effect that it was impossible to be original, I knew he had heard it a million times, but it was a tremendous thrill and pleasure to meet him, shake his hand.\n\nYoure very kind, said Bing. Just like that. We shook hands, firmly, warmly.\n\nThen the spell broke: May we have some pictures Bing?\n\nSure, said Bing and soon he was turning this way and that in response to Bing  this way please! Soon he was signing albums, photographs, plaques, drawings chatting easily to Bob, Frank, Les, and the rest of us. Someone presented him with a very artistic plaque  Perhaps, youll send it to me? said Bing, no doubt wondering how he could look after it and preserve it.\n\nThis must have gone on for thirty or forty minutes, then Bing looked up after signing the last autograph: Any more? Everyone appeared satisfied at last. I found this significant because of an incident that happened later.\n\nKen Barnes came in much later, when Bing had gone, and asked for Bob Roberts, Leslie Gaylor, John Bassett and myself to join him in the control-room where he wanted some shots of us with Bing in that sanctum. Making our way through the aforementioned paraphernalia of the studio, we found Bing had been collared by a professional photographer for some publicity shots.\n\nBing stood there, patiently, while I swear this photographer took a hundred shots. The flash was popping incessantly this went on for a good ten minutes, while the four of us stood waiting in the background. At last the photographer signified hed finished. Thank you Mr. Crosby.\n\nBing turned and walked out he had gone to the control room as we discovered when we entered with Ken.\n\nI thought wed have a few shots in here, Bing, with some of your greatest fans, said Ken.\n\nBing stood up, shook his head: Been enough shots for one day, Ken and walked out. And I didnt blame him! Bing had patiently stood and submitted to pictures from us, to signing autographs, until everyone was satisfied. Any more? Bing had asked. And that was his portion of time. Perhaps because he has found it necessary; perhaps on medical orders, I dont know but it seems to me Bing sensibly apportions what he has to do and does it in rotation, patiently, calmly, cheerfully. And when he has done it, HE HAS DONE IT! And eminently sensible, eminently reasonable, I feel. His days would be impossible, I fancy, if it were otherwise.\n\nFor instance, when Bing finally left us  he went straight to a working lunch in the restaurant upstairs. A private restaurant, that is, belonging to the studios, where Bing was to be interviewed  and photographed  for a Sunday Times Colour Supplement. And then he was roped in for the Pete Murray radio show. This gives an idea of just what a hectic time Bing would always have, especially in London and why, in my estimation, he sensibly schedules his day.\n\nNeedless for me to say, in view of the foregoing, that it was a truly momentous day. To meet Bing and to have the added privilege of seeing and hearing him at work was the fulfillment of 40 years unswerving admiration. I am extremely grateful to Ken Barnes for the opportunity afforded.\n\n(Reg Bristo, writing in the March 1975 issue of BING magazine [37])\n\nBing goes on to give an in-depth interview to George Perry of the Sunday Times. The album of Thats What Life Is All About enters the UK album charts in September 1975 and peaks at No. 28 during its 6 weeks in the charts.\n\nBING CROSBY: THATS WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT (United Artists). All right, Bing Crosby's voice isnt as great as it was 20, 30 or whatever years ago. So what? Hes a brilliant stylist and theres plenty of voice left as he demonstrates here on 13 tracks\n\n(Variety, March 24, 1976)\n\nBing CrosbyThats What Life Is All AboutUnited Artists UAG 29730Producer: Ken Barnes.\n\nPleasantly packaged, this album is perfection from start to finish. Backed by press and TV coverage, including Michael Parkinson, it is bound to sell in large quantities. It is also supported by the title track released as a single, already climbing the charts. Best Things in Life Are Free is a well-loved standard, and its good to see the Hoyt Axton composition Have a Nice Day also included. Johnny Mercer joins forces with Crosby for two of the tracks, being the first time they have recorded together for thirty years. A superb album which is bound to be one of the years best-sellers.\n\n(Music Week, September 6, 1975)\n\nBING CROSBY  Thats What Love Is All About (sic), United Artists UA-LA554-G. Pleasant set of easy listening cuts proves highly refreshing in a time dominated by rock. Crosby has lost little of his vocal talents since last recording, and the efforts of the Pete Moore Orchestra and producer Ken Barnes (as well as a guest shot from Johnny Mercer) help make the set rewarding material from Mercer, Barnes, the Bergmans, Hoyt Axton and Berlin. Best cuts: I Love To Dance Like They Used To Dance, Have A Nice Day, Bon Vivant.\n\n(Billboard, March 13, 1976)\n\n...Crosbys voice has lost very little power and presence despite his septuagenarian status and the major lung operation he underwent last year, and, estimably aided by the outstanding arrangements of Pete Moore and the first-class orchestra directed by Moore, this album is another landmark in a uniquely long and distinguished career.\n\n(The Gramophone, November, 1975)\n\nThe arrival for review of At My Time of Life by Bing Crosby coincided with his outstanding triumph at the London Palladium heading a bill shared by members of his family and Rosemary Clooney. The album sets the seal on a memorable visit to these shores by a living legend personifying all that is good, professional and genuinely heartwarming about the world of entertainment, and, in fact, is the third to emanate from Crosbys recording sessions last year with the exception of the title song, which he recorded in Los Angeles.\n\nThat unique and seemingly indestructible Crosby vocal mellowness enhances the entire proceedings once again. All the songs are drawn from the musical theatre over the five decades of Crosbys prominence as a singer and entertainer, ranging from the Rodgers and Hart numbers My heart stood still and Thou swell from the 1927 stage production of Mark Twains A Connecticut Yankee through I got rhythm by the Gershwin brothers from the 1930 Girl Crazy show and the Harburg/Lane opus How are things in Glocca Morra? from the 1947 Finians Rainbow to the Bacharach/David gem of wistful self-pity Ill never fall in love again from the 1968 Promises, Promises and At my time of life by Hal Shaper and Cyril Ornadel from this years musical adaptation of Dickenss Great Expectations .\n\nCrosby brings his special brand of affable authority to all fourteen numbers, aided and embellished by Pete Moores arrangements and orchestrations which incorporate some deft modern touches without jeopardizing the essential nostalgia of much of this material. The sympathetic and totally aware production work of Ken Barnes also asserts itself in a practical but unobtrusive fashion, and this album is a genuine piece of popular music history of inestimable value.\n\n(The Gramophone, August, 1976)\n\nFebruary 27, Thursday. (Starting at 9:25 a.m.) Interviewed on Pete Murrays Open House BBC Radio Two program in Studio B13 in Broadcasting House, London. Bing is paid a nominal £12. Later, at around 1:20 p.m., appears on the BBC-TV program Pebble Mill at One and is interviewed by Donny McCloud.

Bing goes to Decca House on the Albert Embankment in London for a private luncheon with Sir Edward Lewis, Director Bill Townsley, and executive Geoff Milne. While there, he also films a segment for a forthcoming Thames Television program.\n\nI do remember that it was quite a feat to get Bing to come in for luncheon. He originally excused himself by saying that he didnt eat much during the daytime, but when I explained to him the relationship between himself and the English Decca company, a fact that he had not appreciated, and that our chairman, Sir Edward Lewis, had never met him, he agreed. Need I say, he ate a hearty lunch! When Bing and I stepped out of the lift at Decca House on his departure, he was almost mobbed by staff from the building, and hastily ran to his car parked nearby. He explained to me that he was always afraid of being jostled and knocked overI can vouch for this, since he usually walked rather slowly in his later years, as if intent on maintaining his balance.\n\n(Geoff Milne, in a letter published in BING magazine, December 1996)\n\nMarch 1, Saturday.

Just now pulling myself togetherovercoming the jet lag!\n\nJust wanted to get a note off to you to tell you I thought everything went very well on the recordings. I was certainly pleased with the orchestra and the engineering and all the conveniences and amenities that United Artists provided for me while there.\n\nI was playing Glocca Morra and I noticed theres a mistake in the lyric. I dont know if theres anything you can do about itbut in the second eight bars of the chorus where the line occurs, Sad and dreamy there, I sang Sad and dreary there.\n\nThis is probably too short a phrase to permit any deletion and interpolation, but maybe you can. I dont know if it makes any great difference.\n\nGive my very best to Pete Moore. Will be in touch with you later\n\nAll the best,\n\nBing\n\nP.S. Id appreciate it if youd send me three or four of the recordings on cassettelike The Clowns, Bon Vivant, Heart Stood Still, Song In My Heart, Yours Sincerely.\n\nI have a tape machine hereor rather Harry hasbut I cant play it, so even if Martin brings over tapes, it wouldnt help me much.\n\nIf you have time, knock off a cassette for me and send it to me at the house.\n\n(As reproduced in The Crosby Years, page 47)\n\nMarch 11, Tuesday. A compromise agreement over television revenue from Bing's Pro-Am is reached. The PGA Tournament Players Division is to receive 40% instead of the 30% it received in previous years.\n\nAt the start Bing gave 15% to the PGA from the TV revenue, a sum that has been inflated (at the PGAs insistence, not Bings) to 30% by last year. This year says Crosby, we have negotiated a new three-year contract calling for us to give 40%, 45% and 50%, in that order. Originally, the PGA had asked for 70% for 1977, but we cordially replied that if that figure stuck, we would be saying aloha to the Crosby tournament. We have 800 people donating their time. We have a committee that works for nothing. And I work for nothing. Were not putting forth all this effort solely for golfers. We want them to leave a fair share for the charities we support.\n\n(Unidentified Canadian newspaper clipping)\n\nMarch 16, Sunday.

Bing writes to British fan Leslie Gaylor.\n\nThanks for your letter of the 16th of March. Ive been down in Mexico and only came back the other day to find it waiting for me.\n\nI must say, Leslie, that youve done a tremendous job in connection with the London albums and all the plugs and the other contacts and promotions youve arranged and taken care of.\n\nIm deeply grateful to you for this activity, and Im hopeful that if youve gone to any expense, youll let me know about it so we can take care of that too.\n\nI enjoyed having you all at the studio. I didnt think it was much fun for you - just listening to these things over and over, but if it gave you an idea of how records are made and how the engineering department works, Im sure it was a useful visit.\n\nI imagine Ken Barnes and the people have got some promotions lined up for when I come over in June. I think they had something in mind about doing something on the Parkinson Show. Maybe some songs from the album, or something in that direction. Well see what develops.\n\nWe are all fine here at home. The kids are very busy with school and various activities.\n\nIf I come over in June, I plan to bring the two boys with me for a tour of the Scottish golf courses. Theyre both very keen players now and play well enough to take care of themselves. In fact, they beat me.\n\nIve got a copy of the cassette that Ken Barnes sent over, with the first album on it. Sounds pretty good. Its just a question, I think, of whether or not theres a market for this kind of material.\n\nThe arrangements are all right, and I think I sing them pretty well, but then, as I say, who can say what theyre going to pick up and buy in the current market.\n\nTake care of yourself, Leslie. All best wishes to you and your family \n\nAs ever, Bing\n\nApril 12, Saturday.

American troops withdraw from Vietnam. Bings recording of White Christmas was planned to be played over the American forces radio as a signal that the evacuation should begin but at the last moment his recording cannot be found and a recording by Tennessee Ernie Ford is used.

Jimmy Van Heusen receives a Doctor of Letters degree at Gonzaga University. Bing and Kathryn are present.\n\nMay 22, Thursday. Bing writes to Ken Barnes again.\n\nIve been going over the project which you submitted concerning a television program commemorating my 50th Anniversary in show business.\n\nTheres only one thing that I object to very stronglyand that is the fact that this might lead into a tribute or something of that nature. I would like very much to avoid this. It should be more or less the kind of thing Ive done in 50 years.\n\nI dont want any allusion to my being the biggest record seller or the biggest, most important of any period, or the voice that has been heard more places than anywhere in the world. That stuff has been beat to death, and Im afraid somebody might look into it and find out how untrue it is! This, of course, would be embarrassing!\n\nThen, theres the question of payment. A thing like this has considerable value to me and Ive been approached by several organizations here in the United States for just such a program.\n\nIn fact, two or three of them are now in the development stage, and there is also an outfit in England thats doing a grand over-all picture of the last 50 years of popular music, with me just doing a segment.\n\nSo if youre going to do it over there and world rights are involved, Id have to get something very substantial.\n\nId like you to explore this with your people and find out just what theyre prepared to pay.\n\nTheres another thing I want to take up. I think anybody that you interview on film or on tape over here should be paid. If they dont want to take the money, a check should be given to their favorite charity. Just how much is something that would have to be discussed.\n\nIve reached a point where I just dont want people going around interviewing friends and associates of mine and not paying them something for the privilege.\n\nAfter all, the program is going to make money.\n\nIm supposed to make some money out of it, and the people who participate should also be paid.\n\nI further think that they should be contacted before theyre going to be interviewed, to be prepared, and if possible their comments should be confined to something humorous or amusing or interesting and if possible, I hope that they can be restrained from saying anything extravagant about the kind of work I did or the kind of ability I hador was alleged to have had.\n\nAfter youve had an opportunity to study these things discussed in this letter, Id appreciate it if youd get in touch with me either by phone or by letter.\n\nI should be back in Hillsborough about the 1st of June or thereabouts\n\nAll best wishes,\n\n(As reproduced in The Crosby Years, page 63)\n\nMay (undated). Bing is interviewed at his home by Clive Hirschhorn of the London based Sunday Express and as part of this, Bing is asked whether he would make many changes if he had to live his life over again.\n\nNot many, he said. I think Id be more generous to people who came to me for help and whom I was often too busy or too self-absorbed to think about. I regret that now.\n\nSelfishness. Its so easy to be selfish when youre young and riding high. In my private life I was fortunate though. I made many mistakes in my first marriage and didnt spend nearly enough time with my four boys. Too busy. But late in life I married a second time, and this time I learned from my mistakes, and I think I improved as a husband and as a father. . . .\n\nAs for the present, well, Im a family man who works only when he wants to, and not because he has to. If the right movie script came along, Id do itbut basically todays movies dont appeal to me at all. Theyre just too dirtymost of them. Im no prude but some of the things you see are just plain disgusting. Saw a movie a few weeks ago called Shampoo. I couldnt believe my eyes and ears. Every few minutes I thought of leaving, but was intrigued to see what theyd do next. And they did it. Well, thats not for me. With movies like that around, Ill take the golf course every time.\n\n(Clive Hirschhorn, Sunday Express, June 1, 1975)\n\nJune 13, Friday.

Interviewed at his hotel by Jack de Manio for the BBC-Radio4 program Jack de Manio Precisely, which is actually broadcast on Wednesday, July 23 at 3:50 p.m.\n\nJuly 15, Tuesday. (10:00 a.m.1:00 p.m.) Commences recording the A Couple of Song and Dance Men album with Fred Astaire, Pete Moore and his Orchestra, and the Johnny Evans Singers at the Music Centre, Wembley.\n\nThey arrived at the studio about half an hour before the session and there was a brief fifteen minutes of rehearsal after which Bing decided to have a cup of coffee before recording.\n\nIt took us about twenty-five minutes to get a balance on the orchestra and the first two songs were in the can within forty minutes after that. Bing was very relaxed and charming to everyone and while the orchestra took a fifteen-minute break he went to the reception area to make a couple of phone calls.\n\nWhen he returned we resumed the session and as Pete took the orchestra through the third number, Bing wandered into the control room to hear a playback. I remember asking him: Are you happy with everything, Bing?\n\nEverythings dandy, he replied. Ive only got one more number to do, and then I quit for the day. How sweet it is!\n\nHe went back into the studio and joined Fred in the vocal area. Three takes and his final number for that day was over. During the session a Daily Mirror news photographer was taking shots for a feature story on the album that was being written by Charles Thompson. Charles thought it would be a good idea - before Fred started to rehearse his solo number - to get some shots of the two artists at the microphone in the studio. Fred was more interested in rehearsing his song with the orchestra, but Bing responded to Charles suggestion with almost juvenile enthusiasm. He clowned around the studio floor in a variety of hammy poses, doing his best to get Fred into an equally animated attitude - but without much success. The most that Fred would give was a polite smile. It was obvious to Pete Moore and I that Fred wanted to concentrate on his next song and by goofing around and posing for photos with everyone, Bing was cutting into precious studio and working time. Eventually Bings antics subsided and Fred got a chance to run through his solo version of Easy to Remember (a Crosby hit from the thirties. It was planned that Bing would do one of Freds hits as a solo elsewhere in the sessions). As Fred prepared to do a first take on the song, Bing ambled over to the microphone and said: Nice going, Fred. By the way, Im taking the limousine. See you tomorrow. Without waiting for a reaction, Bing simply strolled out of the studio.\n\nAt the end of the session I had to drive Fred back to his hotel.\n\nAnother thing that bothered Fred throughout each session was the amount of ad-libbing that Crosby would invariably indulge in. Bing is the master when it comes to cross-talk and witty asides, said Fred. I cant begin to compete with him. What am I going to do?\n\nSince I had written all the special lyrics and adaptations for the album, I approached Bing to suggest a few lines to him that might be thrown in at odd points during the routines. He said: Fine, Ill make a note of them.\n\nI then went back to Fred with some suggestions that might counteract Bings lines and where he might possibly top the great Crosby in one or two instances. Fred was delighted to have the inside information and the useful retorts. But more often than not, Crosby would be one jump ahead of us and at the crucial point in a routine he would hit Fred with a completely different line. And yet, for some reason, Fred - who claimed to be a poor ad-libber - would rise to the occasion by coming back with an equally funny remark. The result was that most of the ad-libs in that album are absolutely genuine.\n\nThe only time in the album where Bing managed to completely top Fred was in their version of Pick Yourself Up in which I had written a special lyric portraying Fred as a dancing teacher and Bing as a less-than-capable pupil. It was agreed that at the very end of the routine, Bing would simply say to Fred: And now for your singing lesson. But Bing went much further than that with a whole string of funny lines about not being able to fit Fred in for at least a fortnight. We just left the tape running to get all of Crosbys lines and we picked up the laughter of the orchestra too. It was a moment of rare magic. And Fred loved it as much as anyone.\n\n(Ken Barnes, writing in The Crosby Years, pages 51-52)\n\nOne lovely story, regarding another American star, was the day we arrived at the studios to discover we were to provide the vocal backing for two legendary performers who were combining their talents to produce an album - Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. As thrilled as I was to meet and work with these showbiz greats, Joan Baxter, one of the other session singers booked for the recording, was ecstatic. I must ring my Mum during the break for lunch, she said and tell her who we are working with. She is a Bing Crosby fanatic and shell just die. As soon as the midday break was called, Joan phoned and was just about to tell her Mum the news, when who should walk by, at just that moment, but the man himself. Without as much as a by your leave - Joan thrust the phone into his hand and said Bing - say hallo to my Mum - her name is Harriet. Bing, without turning a hair, and in that very recognisable voice of his, spoke into the mouthpiece. Hi, Harriet - this is Bing Crosby. Howya doin. For all the effect it had on Joans mum, it could have been the local butcher. In her broad Yorkshire accent she replied, Ee - is that you Bing? Me arthritis is killing me!\n\nWell honey, replied the crooner dont you worry. You just sit yourself down with a large brandy - no, make that two large brandies - and youll feel much better. Joans mum, the Bing fanatic who we felt would just die at the thought of speaking to her hero, refused even now to show her excitement or, worse still, to admit her personal worship of the man.\n\nOur Joans Dad, she said thought you were wonderful! Bing was unable to say another word for Harriets phlegmatic reply struck a funny bone and he left us to enjoy his lunch, still roaring with laughter at the conversation.\n\n(Maggie Stredder, writing in her book The Girl with the Glasses, pages 68-69)\n\nDuring the evening, Thames Television transmits The Day War Broke Out in which Bing and others give recollections of entertainment during WWII.\n\nJuly 16, Wednesday.

The rapport and mutual esteem between these two splendid troupers are obvious and delightful, although the verbal adlibbing and asides are occasionally overdone and not always intelligible to the listener...This LP recorded in London last year was the first occasion on which the two main participants had worked together since making the film Blue Skies in 1946, and one hopes it will be followed by further collaborations.\n\n(The Gramophone, February, 1976)\n\nJuly 18, Friday. (10:30 - 11:15 a.m.) Interviewed by Michael Aspel on Capital Radio. In the afternoon, tapes another Parkinson television show for BBC, which is shown on August 30. Bing sings several songs on the Parkinson show accompanied by Pete Moore and his Orchestra. Rehearsals start at 2:30 p.m. with the show itself starting at 6:00 p.m. Bings fee is £300, which he takes in cash on August 18.\n\nOne day we received a letter from a man called Leslie Gaylor. He was a fitter for Hovercraft in the Isle of Wight. He said he had the biggest collection in the land of Bing Crosby memorabilia, that Bing was a personal friend of his and if we wanted him on the show he could fix it. We thought he was a nutter. But then why would he say these things if there was not an element of truth in them? So we asked him to come to London and not only did Mr. Gaylor get us Bing Crosby, he was also indirectly responsible for Fred Astaire appearing on the show.\n\nIt is a mark of Crosbys unaffected good nature that he made his first appearance on Parkinson not because Orson Welles had been on the show or he had anything to promote, but out of friendship for Leslie Gaylor. He was the most relaxed and laid back of them all\n\nWhen he arrived at the reception desk at the TV Centre he was carrying a hat box under his arm. He said to the receptionist, Hi, Im Bing Crosby. Can you direct me towards the gal whos going to fix my toop?\n\nHis hairpiece was in the box.\n\nHe told me his favourite song was White Christmas and he never tired of singing it. When he performed it on the show I was astonished to see him reading the words from autocue. He had an effortless style and possessed the greatest gift of all, that of making everyone in the studio believe they wanted to work for him.\n\nThat said he wasnt a pushover. He had very exacting standards and expected everyone else to match them. It is true that, like Sinatra, he didnt care much for rehearsal, which is not the same saying he didnt care about getting it right. Again like Sinatra, when he came into the studio to rehearse he was word perfect and faultless in his delivery. He expected everyone else to be the same.\n\nHe ran through his number twice, the band was happy, it sounded good. Then the director asked if he would mind doing it one more time. Crosby agreed. When he had finished, the director pleaded with Bing for another take.\n\nCrosby asked why.\n\nThe director said, I think I can do it better.\n\nBing smiled and said, I cant.\n\nI did a duet with Crosby, which is a bit like saying I danced with Ginger Rogers or opened the innings with W. G. Grace.\n\nBing said if I was any good he was going to retire and play golf. At the end of our performance, he looked at me and said, Guess Im back on the road again.\n\n(Michael Parkinson, writing in his book Parky, pages 214-216)\n\nHowever, we got to the TV Theatre around 2pm - and on making enquiries at a side-entrance were brusquely informed that only Mr. John Fisher could give permission to enter for the rehearsal. Crestfallen we certainly were, especially as the rain was falling quite heavily when who should appear but Pete Moore, whom Id had the pleasure of meeting previously with Ken Barnes and Leslie Gaylor. This turned things a lot brighter - and especially so when Ken himself arrived and after a short while, we had the necessary permission to enter for the rehearsal - for which our thanks are assuredly due to Ken, Pete Moore and John Fisher. Inside the theatre we met Leslie Gaylor and George OReilly, who you will recall produced the Irish TV show that Bing did around 1968, and several prominent members of the ICC, including Bob Roberts and his wife Vera, and Fred Reynolds, down from Birmingham.\n\nAt 2.30 immense activity broke out on the stage. Pete Moore had assembled the orchestra and they were running thro various tuning up processes. Then Bing walked on stage! He looked really terrific, very tanned, smiling broadly and obviously very happy The producer, his assistants, the technicians were all in earnest, workmanlike, conversations and conferences Parkinson going from one to the other we could hear the technical requirements and details being ironed out, speedily, efficiently, cameras, mikes, control room, a truly fascinating experience.\n\nBing was asked to run thro Play a Simple Melody - and he was in superb voice and form he went on singing chatting to Parkinson, and it was clear they enjoyed each others company young Harry arrived and was soon strumming his guitar and chatting away to Parkinson, too. What with the songs and the re-takes we had a truly marvellous time. Many times, in the rehearsal, there was spontaneous applause from the visitors, the studio technicians and those of us lucky enough to be present - and I noticed that the musicians often led the applause. It was truly amazing - and naturally, a wonderful tribute to Bings superb talents and style.\n\nThe rehearsal ended after about two and a quarter hours  and Bing was still going strong with the show proper still to come!\n\n(Eric Crowder, writing in BING magazine, September 1975 [#39])\n\nThen the show itself; no less than six songs from Bing and a fund of reminiscences and anecdotes. It was noticeable that Parkinson had several pages of script in front of him - necessary no doubt - but that Bing had no notes whatever and spoke spontaneously and completely off-the-cuff, as it were, all the way through. And except for one small slip when he switched from unctuous to urbane when talking about Fred Astaire, he was word-perfect. Quite an astonishing display of virtuosity as regards elan, on-the-spot narration, humour and breadth of knowledge and character.\n\nA highlight was, of course, when Bing launched into his first song, Breezing Along with the Breeze from the forthcoming album. This gave the show an upbeat-tempo from its earliest moments. Among the other songs were Play a Simple Melody, with son Harry, The Pleasure of Your Company with Parkinson. I Like to Dance Like They Used to Dance, Send in the Clowns (this could well be a smash-hit) and we had a fabulous bonus when Bing had to do Thats What Life Is All About twice, after one false start!\n\nThe false-start itself demonstrated Bings completely equable temperament. Pete Moores excellent orchestra was playing a four-bar introduction but Bing misread it and came in late. Signs were made to him to stop and he quizzically enquired; Something wrong?\n\nIts a very short intro Bing, apologised Pete, I dont think it gives you time enough to get from your chair across stage to the microphone Bing was completely alive to the problem and humourously made a series of mock sprints from his seat to the centre of the stage amid much mirth and applause from the audience. These items will not, of course, be screened but they are a lasting memory for us who were lucky enough to be there.\n\nFinally it was decided to make the intro eight-bars and the take went through to the end. But it appeared there were further problems - the orchestra had come in loud and strong for the last chorus and it was felt that Bings voice had been partially drowned, though I must add at this stage he sounded very powerful indeed.\n\nNow came some real Crosbyana: firstly, Bing explained to us what had happened  and typically he blamed himself for asking the orchestra to pump it up. Whether that was so or not, how like him to put everyone at ease by shouldering the blame. Some lightning re-arrangements were by then going on (to the score that is) and while this was being fixed, Bing sat casually astride his stool in the centre of the stage, dexterously juggling the hand-mike - and launched into a little verse in rhyme to the opening bars of the song explaining what had occurred! He was in masterly form and yet it was all done with all the casual aplomb and absolute spontaneity which is Bings hallmark. I hope someone either taped or remembered the words to this little impromptu song - it completely captivated everyone - the audience, orchestra, stagehands, technicians, and received a very big hand. Again, this wont be shown on TV - and what a pity! Bing regarded us with mock concern, shrugged, and said apologetically: Fraid were gonna have to do it again - and this apology brought more well-nigh frantic applause\n\nAll too soon the show was over; it had started at six and now it was seven-thirty. We could have stayed for hours and still have been not satisfied. What a privilege and genuine thrill to have been entertained in person by the greatest showbusiness superstar of them all, of this or any other era.\n\n(John Bignell, writing in BING magazine, September 1975 [#39])\n\nSo glad you liked the Michael Parkinson show. It was fun to do. He is such a generous host. I thought the music sounded pretty good.

(8:009:00 a.m.) Appears on Terry Wogans morning BBC Radio 2 show in London.\n\nWhen younger, Bing Crosby with his deceptively easy singing style and his similar gift on the big screen had been a great favourite of mine. I could never have dreamt of meeting him, as I queued for the one-and-nines, but I did. In the early seventies, he dropped in one morning on my radio show, and we chatted. He, too, was everything I knew he would be: full of bonhomie and good humour, relaxed and generous with his time.\n\nAs I recall [and, as you have noticed, my recollections can be a bit on the misty side], Bing was in London to record an album with Fred Astaire. The word had it that the recording was not going as swimmingly as it might: Astaire was a workaholic, meticulous in everything, as in his dancing: rehearse, refine, rehearse, lets do it one more time. Crosbys style was the antithesis of Astaires: rely on your talent, do it on your toes, wing it, lets go, Ive got a golf date\n\n(Terry Wogan, writing in his book, Is It Me? pages 78/79)\n\nJuly 23, Wednesday.

Bings fee of £200 is paid to United Artists Records in London.\n\nOne final story of the Top of the Pops concerns a Party Political Broadcast from the Prime Minister at that time - Edward Heath. Mr. Heath had arrived at the BBC to record his message and found to his concern that the studio he had been allocated, was next door to TOTPs. It so happens that, on that particular day, the bands appearing were especially loud with the exception of a live appearance from the Old Groaner himself - Bing Crosby and the Director feared a backlash from the politician. On cue, the P.M. entered the studio and in a stern voice demanded to see him in charge. Visualising entombment in the Bloody Tower at least, he approached his prominence in some fear.\n\nAre you in charge here? shouted the great man.\n\nYessir trembled the Director Yes - I am! The Prime Minister leant towards him and asked\n\nAny chance of Bing Crosbys autograph?\n\nThat story, I promise, you is true.\n\n(Maggie Stredder, writing in her book The Girl with the Glasses, page 77)\n\nJuly 24, Thursday.

Meanwhile, Kathryn leaves San Francisco to fly to England to rejoin her husband.\n\nHowever, it was well into the latter part of the show before the actual introduction and appearance of Bing occurred with these words: Over the years there have been many singing highlights in my career, but however great the memory of those times nothing can equal the thrill that I now feel in introducing to you someone that we all love and admire so much. Ladies and gentlemen: Bing Crosby!\n\nAnd Bing strolled on to cheers and. applause which certainly equalled, if not excelled, that of the Parkinson reception. He wore a lounge suit and joined the beaming Verathe Alyn Ainsworth orchestra was playing Where the Blue of the Night in almost two-step time which, after Veras reminder, Bing noted that he remembered very well. Vera thanked Bing for coming and he responded by saying how much he had been looking forward to it. It was at this juncture that Vera expressed the fulfillment of her lifes ambition by singing with Bingit invited the almost inevitable Crosby rejoinder: Oooh, Vera! You must elevate your goals a little! But Vera would have none of it and as the music struck up they went into that presumed first-ever duet, Sing a Song. The opening lines were backed by piano only and the orchestra and chorus (Young Generation) gradually came in to good effect. Both sang out good and strong and gave the likeable Joe Raposo composition the straight and tuneful treatment it deserves. Bing faded a little on a word or twomaybe he leaned back out of mike rangebut he carried the melody while Vera harmonised, reversing their roles towards the conclusion. It was delightfully executed and with both renowned for their rich, clear tones and perfect diction that much was to be expected. The disappointment came in that they sang only the one duet. A lost opportunity! With all respect to the other guests one felt that after such a musical amalgam the producer might have at least treated us to more than this. It was not to be. Still, we did have another live version of Thats What Life Is All About a pleasant variation from the issued version both in words and music that included a little whistle from Bing. We have quite a collection of these live versions nownearly enough for a complete LP! Bing took a full 40 seconds applause after his solo, and was seeming to just settle in comfortably when it was all over (he had appeared just a bit wooden and less buoyant than usual on his entrance).\n\nWhat a pity they couldnt have really made a night of it; but at least posterity has one Bing/Vera duet to relish - something of which I had long given up hope.\n\n(Bert Bishop, writing in BING magazine, December 1975 [#40])\n\nAs far as my memories of Bing are concerned, I could not possibly go into all the days we spent together rehearsing, but the one thing that did stick in my mind was when we had tea, he had a huge piece of fruit cake and a large lump of ice-cream with it! Probably a good combination, but not one we were familiar with\n\n(Vera Lynn, in a letter dated March 27, 2007 to Crosby fan Trevor Wagstaff.)\n\nJuly 28, Monday. Is interviewed by Derek Jones for a BBC Radio 4 program called Sounds Natural and Bing makes various bird calls and discusses other wildlife matters. The program is broadcast on January 26, 1976. Bing is paid £50.\n\nBing was the first singer of whom, when a very small boy in the 1930s, I became aware and I was soon a great admirer of his. My parents had several 78rpm gramophone records of songs he had recorded in those years. Two of them, Home on the Range and The Last Roundup, have been favourites of mine ever since.\n\nSo, having heard in the 1970s that he was very interested in wildlife, it was not surprising that I invited him at that period to participate as a guest in a series of radio programmes called Sounds Natural that I had devised and produced for Radio 4 and which featured celebrities with a keen interest in wildlife.\n\nAn enthusiastic golfer, Bing had become friends with the BBCs golfing commentator, the late Henry Longhurst, who, as it happened, was also very interested in wildlife and had already agreed to participate in one of the Sounds Natural programmes. I mentioned to him that I would like to invite Bing and he informed me that he would shortly be coming to Britain to play golf at St Andrews and to record a couple of albums in London. Henry said that Bing was a very early riser and advised me to telephone him at his St Andrews hotel early in the morning before he went out for a round of golf before breakfast.\n\nIt was with some trepidation at phoning anyone as early as 7am that I picked up the telephone in my office at BH Bristol. I need not have worried, Bing was up and about and very amiable. He said he would be glad to take part in the programme and could fit it in one day when he came down to London. As he couldnt be sure of a possible date at that stage, he told me he would telephone me as soon as he knew. I mentioned that in a few days time I would be lunching with Henry Longhurst in his idyllically situated home on top of the South Downs near Brighton. Nevertheless, it was rather to my surprise that on that day, 16 July 1975, during lunch, the telephone rang and Henrys wife answered it and returned to say, Its Bing Crosby for you, John. And so it was: to tell me that he had hired a house in Londons Holland Park and could meet me there one morning in a week or sos time to record the interview.\n\nThis was duly arranged and the regular Sounds Natural interviewer, the late Derek Jones, a popular West Country broadcaster, and I arrived together with a BBC recording engineer based in London. As soon as we had set up our recording gear ready to go, Bing joined us and quickly made us feel at home. I explained the form that the programme would take. This included the subsequent insertion of sound recordings from the BBCs collection of wildlife sounds to illustrate his anecdotes and memories, plus extracts I had selected from a few of the songs that he had recorded that were appropriate to the programmes theme.\n\nI had previously discovered that he was a very good mimic of those American wild birds with which he was familiar. In discussing these with him, I mentioned that one would be an extract from My Blue Heaven, which refers to the call of the whip-poor-will, a bird related to our nightjar, which also calls at night. Bing said he had sung so many different songs in his lifetime and he couldnt remember them all including that one. So rather self-consciously in the presence of such a famous crooner, I crooned the first couple of lines to him, which sparked his memory and he joined in, quipping at the end, We should have got together sooner, John! Other songs of Bings that I included were Mr Meadowlark, where Bing gives very good imitations of the song of this American bird of fields and meadows, and bobwhite. The bobwhite is a common small American gamebird related to our quail whose name is onomatopoeic: its typical call sounding like a whistled bob-bob-white, also mimicked perfectly by Bing.\n\nTo demonstrate just how good his imitations were, in the final programme as transmitted, I subsequently added actual sound recordings of these birds for comparison.\n\nProvided by me with a series of questions in addition to his own that I knew would launch Bing on a string of his wildlife memories, Derek, a masterly interviewer, evoked a delightfully chatty conversation that pleased me immensely. Bing had been a keen wildfowler, hunting within United States laws, but his concern for the conservation of water birds and other wildlife was sincere.\n\nAfter the interview had finished, Bing, Derek, the recording engineer and I continued to chat for another hour about birds, fishing, colour blindness (from which Bing suffered) and other topics. Derek and I both felt that Bing genuinely enjoyed chatting about his interests in wildlife and its conservation as a change from being asked about his show business career\n\nAltogether, as Derek Jones wrote in his account of the occasion (Microphones and Muddy Boots, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, Devon, 1987), it was two hours of absolute joy.\n\nLike Derek, I am happy that we were able to meet and talk with Bing, a charming man whose distinctive singing voice we had both greatly admired. A couple of years after our meeting, Bing passed away, appropriately enough, on a golf course. To both of us life wasnt the same without him.\n\nA couple of months after the repeat broadcast of the programme in January 1976, I received a very nice personal letter from Bing, saying, among other topics, that he had listened to the tape of the programme I had sent him and was much impressed by it. I still have and treasure the letter.\n\n(John F. Burton, writing in Prospero, the newspaper for BBC pensioners, October 2014)\n\nJuly 30, Wednesday.

He chatted with us for about an hour, exuded charm, and seemed as unaware as we were of the stormy days that awaited him. When we parted, Bing patted Charles on the shoulder, and wished him the best of luck. Suddenly struck by a premonition, the Prince replied, Thanks very much. You know, Im sure Ill need it.\n\n(Kathryn Crosby. My Last Years with Bing, page 355)\n\nAugust 3, Sunday.

He is paid £75 and the program is broadcast on September 7 at 6:15 p.m.\n\nBut have you been a quick learner of songs? Hear it once...\n\nNo. Id say it depends. These songs they are writing now are so intricate that it takes me quite a while to learn them - not so much the melody as the intervals. Songwriters used to write eight bars, eight bars, a middle strain and then eight bars at the finish; that was it. Now there are six-bar phrases, four-bar, no beats in between, or three beats in between, or three-and-a-half. I have to hear it several times before I can get it in my head.\n\nAugust 5, Tuesday. (10:30 a.m.) Golfs at Sunningdale in a charity pro-am event preceding the Colgate European Womens Championship. Bing is interviewed on television. Bob Hope also attends the event.

Bing and his sons fly from London Airport to Holland.\n\nAugust 7, Thursday. Golfs in Hilversum, Holland, in a pro-am and is interviewed by Dutch television and radio.\n\nAnd then Bing arrived with his two sons. I was allowed to be present when Bing and the boys sat down and had a meal  Bing had an egg-salad, a glass of milk and some ice-cream while all the time people were taking a thousand pictures and asking even more questions. He sat very relaxed, answering in kindly fashion the same old questions about his family, his golfing, other artists, etc. Then Bing was away to change, but I asked him again for his autograph and told him once more how I enjoyed his BBC interview  and he recognized me! Since there werent too many people asking for his signature at that particular time I was bold enough to give him two more things to autograph  the BBC ticket and an issue of BING magazine: and guess what he said?\n\nGosh! Youre asking a lot you know you can exchange four of my signatures for one of Sinatras, dont you?\n\nHe should know better  but everyone roared with laughter. Well then, after Bing had changed everybody followed him up to the green. Before he teed off he spoke a few words and sang Wheres My Caddy (I believe) and then I spent a wonderful four and a half hours next to him as he happily went along from hole to hole. He was merrily swinging his clubs and chatting to everyone who wanted to have a chat, including myself.\n\nAnd this time I wasnt so nervous. He really brightened up the whole course in his own special, easy-going manner. And, as far as I can judge, he is such a good golfer.\n\nIt was a tremendously hot day and the golfers stopped every now and then for a drink - water, mainly, which gave me the chance to offer Bing a glass which he heartily accepted.\n\nHalfway round, he did a small interview for the radio and the man who interviewed him was almost as nervous as Id been the first time. When it was broadcast later you could hear him say  can you imagine that! Me standing next to B-b-bing C-c-crosby!\n\nAt the end of the game he did another interview for Dutch TV and one of the TV men asked him if he would sing something - which he did! Bing walked to the mike and everyone was closing in around him in a circle and joining him. Happily, I was right beside him, joining in as he sang Its Tulip Time in Holland, Zing a Little Zong, True Love, Pennies from Heaven every time it rains it rains  then he looked at his watch: Dont you know my plane is leaving for Heaven all to the melody! Wonderful. And then he was about to go, after hed sung White Christmas on a day when everyone was wiping their forehead it was so hot.\n\nI felt I just couldnt let him walk off like that and I went after him to say Goodbye. We shook hands and he asked me to spell out my name so that he wouldnt forget it - and he told me to take good care of my feet and perhaps to buy myself a new pair of shoes! Since it was such a hot day I hadnt put on any stockings that morning. Rather quickly I had five blisters on each foot for the rest of the day onto which Id put some plasters and as Id walked barefoot for the rest of the day on sand and grass you could hardly see my skin and my feet were as black as coal! So my feet were rather conspicuous and with all the plasters, they must have looked much worse than they really were. Certainly Bing was quick to spot them  and very kindly told me to take good care of them.\n\n(Noor Van Heel, writing in BING magazine, June 1977 [#46])\n\nAugust 11, Monday.

Records an International Pro-Celebrity Golf BBC-TV program on the Kings Course, Gleneagles in Scotland, with Val Doonican, Tom Weiskopf, and Peter Oosterhuis. Bing and his partner win easily. The program is shown on BBC2 on January 27, 1976.\n\nThe whole series of Pro-Celebrity Golf is usually played over a couple of weeks, the promoters endeavouring to put two nine-hole matches in the can per day. The pilot drew my attention to a tiny grass airstrip up ahead, or should I say down ahead, a long tidy row of similar aircraft to our own lining either side of it, rather like a guard of honour.\n\nSome black limousines stood by the modest reception building indicating, in fact, that I wasnt the only one arriving at that particular time. In fact as I said hello to one of the representatives from BBC Television, standing by the cars, another plane lightly touched down.\n\nThatll be Mr. Crosby now, I heard somebody behind me say, causing my ears to prick up. One of my great personal ambitions had long been to meet the man I always considered to be the finest pop singer of all time. I felt sure the opportunity was at hand, knowing we were both heading for the same destination.\n\nA minute or two later, I was ushered into one of the waiting cars, and just as I climbed aboard, a voice said, Oh, Val, have you met Bing? I turned, and there entering the car parked alongside was The Man Himself.\n\nHi there, Val, howya doin? He reached out of the car and took my hand. I believe were playin a bit of golf together today. Till that moment of course I had no idea who my playing opponent was to be.\n\nJust as our respective cars were pulling away, he opened his window and called out, Lets have some lunch together before the game. We did just that within the hour and then made our way to the golf course. Bing, as most golfers will know, had been an extremely good amateur golfer, and even while in his early seventies he still played well. It was indeed a day I shall never forget, made even more memorable by the young Scottish lad, who had no idea who the great Mr. Crosby was when he asked for my autograph during the round.\n\n(Val Doonican, writing in Peoples Friend, May 23, 1987)\n\nAugust 21, Thursday.

Bing, Kathryn and the boys are in Yorkshire (near Ripon) for the grouse shooting. They stay with Lord and Lady Swinton at nearby Swinton Park, Masham, North Yorkshire for several days. Bing also calls in at the Drovers Arms, Dallowgill for a drink and sings Happy Holiday for the patrons.\n\nMusic continued to play a significant role in Davids life and was the cause of some entertaining episodes which he loved to relate. One of these took place at Swinton Park, North Yorkshire, in 1975, when David and Susie attended a party where an elderly Bing Crosby was a fellow guest. After dinner, Bing was persuaded to start singing but his son Harry found it difficult to accompany him as he responded to requests, not having the sheet music to hand. Someone suggested that David should play, knowing of his gift of playing by ear. Bing looked askance at the idea of an amateur pianist but soon realised that David was easily capable, and could even ask him what key he required before embarking on the next tune. Bing would reply with a smile Keep it down, Dave, keep it down. Bing found it hard to recall the lyrics, but Susie and a friend were able to whisper them into his ears, and an unforgettable evening followed.\n\n(Obituary of country landowner David Yorke in the Craven Herald & Gazette, August 10, 2017)\n\nAugust (undated). Tapes several items for the long running Yorkshire Television program Stars on Sunday in Leeds. Receives a nominal fee of £250, which he passes on to the playing fields committee at Kirkby Malzeard, near Ripon, North Yorkshire. He has already given £1000 to this cause.\n\nI have mentioned, earlier in this book, how long it can sometimes take between the first approaches being made to an artist and their appearance on the program. The first programme of the winter series on September 14 saw the debut of Bing Crosby in Stars on Sunday. In early August I had heard that Bing Crosby was over here to make a record. I contacted his record producer and it was left that if Mr. Crosby was willing and able to appear on the program he would give me a ring at the Leeds office.\n\nA few days later I was sitting in the canteen at Leeds when one of the secretaries from the office came in looking slightly flushed and walked across to where I was sitting. Im sorry to disturb you, she said, but Ive got a fellow on the telephone who wont leave a message and insists on talking to you personally. Who is it? I asked. She gave a little disbelieving laugh. Well he says hes Bing Crosby, she replied. With that I leaped to my feet and broke the world record for the 100 yard sprint back to my office. I regained my breath, picked up the phone and said in as calm a voice as I could manage, Good afternoon Mr. Crosby, can I do anything for you? The reply was brief but very pleasant to hear Yes, when can we get together and sort out something for this program of yours? And that was it.\n\nThe recording session was being done in studio 2 and from the moment he came on to the set it was packed with studio personnel who had all found a legitimate excuse for being there. We went through the songs and readings without any problems and finished the session close on 12. We went for a pre-lunch drink in the club bar. While we there I mentioned that he had many fans amongst the members of the canteen staff and that they would love to see him for a few moments. Well lets go and see them, he said. So off we went into the canteen where he shook hands with everyone who came up to him. He went along the serving counter meeting all staff from the manager and head chef down to the most junior washer-up and signed many autographs.\n\n(Peter Max-Wilson, writing in the book Stars on Sunday.)\n\nAugust 25, Monday.

(11:00 p.m.12:05 a.m.) Bings taped appearance on the BBC-TV show Parkinson is shown.\n\nThis opening edition, directed by Stanley Appel, produced by Richard Drewett and pegged to Bing Crosbys half-century in show business, was obviously preplanned, tailored and manicured, even by chat show standards.\n\nQuestions had a habit of emerging as cues for songs. Despite all the Hollywood musical brainwashing, with those Lets Do the Show Right Here bits attempting to prove that near-perfection can be attained off the cuff, there was no doubt that Parkinson, Crosby and the team had arranged a pleasant mixture of concert and interview.\n\nBing sang uncannily well for a man of his years, and was as engaging a talker as ever. (Somebodys extreme poverty was indicated by He hadnt change for a match.) And for all the transatlantic colour, he cares about language. Complimenting Fred Astaire on unctuousness; he quickly changed itafter a verbal nudge from Parkinsonto urbanity, realizing that it is kinder to accuse a friend of being suave than oily.\n\n(Shaun Usher, Daily Mail, September 1, 1975)\n\nSeptember 3, Wednesday. In London for a photo session at Decca House at 10:30 a.m. before going to the Argo Studios at 115 Fulham Road with Decca record producer Geoff Milne, where Bing records the first part of the Tom Sawyer album. Bing returns to his rented house at 4:30 p.m.\n\n He also made a three-album box-set for Argo in which he recited the story of Tom Sawyer. Argo wanted to do something to commemorate the American Bicentennial celebrations, and it seemed a good idea to do Tom Sawyer - we all agreed that the only person who could relate the story was Bing Crosby. I approached him with the idea, and he thought just for a moment before saying he would love to do it. The recordings were done in two sessions, one lasting four hours and the other two and one-half hours. It was the first time that he had ever been involved with anything of that nature.\n\nIt was interesting to watch him in the studios. He was on his feet throughout the sessions. And he didnt just read Tom Sawyer, he was actually acting the parts. His voice took on different tones and characters. He put a lot into it and I believe that it comes across in the records. The pity is that he wouldnt allow any cameras into the studios, because it was one of those occasions which was really worth preserving.\n\nBing was a marvellous man to work for, and there arent too many people around who are like that. There were several very young sound engineers working on the Argo sessions and they were completely knocked out by him. They couldnt believe that he had so much control and command of the situation. Another good thing about him was that whenever anything went wrong, he blamed himself. It was never anyone elses fault, and that is what made him such a professional.\n\n(Geoff Milne, as quoted in Womans Realm magazine after Bings death)\n\nSeptember 4, Thursday. The Mike Douglas afternoon television show in the U.S. has Bing and Kathryn plus Mike Preminger and Sandra Harman as the guests, with David Brenner as cohost. The show had been taped before Bings departure for the U.K.\n\nSeptember 5, Friday. Completes the Tom Sawyer album at Argo Studios between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.\n\nHe (Geoff Milne) persuaded Bing to record the Tom Sawyer book and Geoff laughed as he remembered the actual recording sessions spread over three days and Bings occasional fluffs, which he supplemented with colourful language. Most of the sound effects on the album were done by Geoff himself  the sound in the cave for instance was achieved by recording a dripping tap in the Decca washroom and then doctoring the effect appropriately.\n\n(Malcolm Macfarlane, Milne Magic, BING magazine, summer, 2005 [#140])\n\nThis abridged version of a well-loved story is one of the most enjoyable sets to have come my way in recent years. It was a master stroke to get Bing Crosby to read it, for the Old Groaner has a devastatingly charming manner, compounded of a relaxed and sympathetic delivery and a lovely speaking voice. The vocal cords that kept him at the very top in music and musical films for so many years are just as velvety now...Crosbys masterly reading needs little help. Delicate, dry, humourous but never whimsical or condescending, he is one of the most delightful readers Argo has offered us. The quality of the sound is exceptionally fine. Highly recommended.\n\n(Mary Postgate, The Gramophone, May, 1976)\n\nThe exploits of Tom, living with his Aunt Polly in a small town on the Missouri, and his companion Huckleberry Finn are refreshingly recaptured in Crosbys reading. . . . Bings expressive narrative and his dialect voicing of the characters enhance an impressive and entertaining story.\n\n(Fred Reynolds, The Crosby Collection, part five, page 188)\n\nHe then tapes a Disneytime program for BBC-TV, which is shown on December 26. The filming is done in a private house in Chiswick. Bings fee is £250, which he takes in cash.\n\nSeptember 7, Sunday (6:15 - 7:00 p.m.) BBC Radio 4 broadcasts an edition of Wogans World in which Terry Wogan interviews Bing from the sunny lounge of a house somewhere in London. This was the program taped on August 4.\n\nSeptember 8, Monday. Bing arrives back in Hillsborough.\n\nSeptember (undated). Nathaniel Crosby commences his studies at Burlingame High School. He had been offered a place at Bellarmine but has chosen to go to a more local college instead.\n\nSeptember 14, Sunday. Bings taped contribution to the Stars on Sunday program is shown on Yorkshire Television. He sings, Thats What Life Is All About.\n\nSeptember 15, Monday. Bing records the remainder of the Bingo Viejo album with Paul Smith and his Orchestra at United Recorders, Hollywood. The album is released by Anahuac Records in the U.S.A. and by British Decca in the U.K.\n\nBingo Viejo by old Bing Crosby himself is a typically warm Crosbyian salute to south of the border with ten songs sung in English and Spanish which will undoubtedly please his numerous adherents of either tongue. The numbers are mostly familiar ones like Green Eyes, Besame Mucho, Frenesi and The Breeze and I, and the arrangements are less than impressive, particularly the messy accompaniment for Amapola, which almost undermined the Old Groaners customary vocal serenity.\n\n(The Gramophone, April, 1977)\n\nSeptember 21, Sunday. Sings three songs at a benefit at the Getty Museum in Malibu to raise funds for the Hirsch Mental Health Center.\n\nIn his deepest, most mellifluous voice, NBC White House correspondent Tom Brokaw introduced him. Ladies and gentlemenBing. Just as if he were introducing the President of the United States, the Ford whose California visit had brought Brokaw west again. The Bing, as practically everyone, and particularly those attending Community Outreachs An Evening at the Getty knew, was Crosby. And as he stepped out Sunday night from one of the gallery entrances into the spotlight of the Getty Museums inner peristyle, the applause broke out.\n\nBing, trim, insouciant, acting a little subdued as befitted an evening dedicated to raising funds for the support of the Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center, was the same old Bing we all remembered.\n\nRarely seen around Los Angeles these days (he lives with his family in a San Francisco suburb), Bing looked great. Hes trim and relaxed and the voice sounded great as it boomed out around the columned porticos of the peristyle gardens where the tables had been set for dinner and the entertainment. There were just three songs, then a quick exit. The ultimate professional, Bing left them wanting more.\n\nGreat acoustics, said attorney Paul Ziffren, who once played the violin and has a keen ear. Nearby, Marilyn Bergman smiled broadly while Bing sang the theme song from Stardust Ballroom. Joyce Easton, there with Ted Ashley, filled us in. Marilyn and Alan Bergman wrote the lyrics.\n\n(Jody Jacobs, Los Angeles Times, September 23, 1975)\n\nBing goes on to join the Mills Brothers Charity Show at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion celebrating the Mills Brothers fiftieth anniversary in show business. Other guests are Harry Von Zell, Johnny Green and Helen OConnell with an orchestra led by Louis Bellson providing support. Bing sings Out of Nowhere accompanied by Johnny Green and then lipsynchs Thats What Life Is All About as the orchestra does not have an arrangement of the song. The Mills Brothers then join Bing and they sing Dinah together. Bing receives a standing ovation as he leaves the stage.\n\nSeptember 22, Monday. Bing arranges for a check for $100 to be sent to British fan Leslie Gaylor annotated \"publicity\". Daily Variety carries a news item stating:\n\nThe Mark C. Bloome Co. is shying away from a battle with Bing Crosby by pulling radio commercials that employ sound-alike Jack Harris.\n\nSeptember 24, Wednesday. Bings taped appearance on the Vera Lynn BBC-TV show is transmitted.\n\n. . . he looks a little thinner but his voice has lost none of its charm. He still sings with impeccable timing. He, too, knows more than a bit about sentiment. He sang about ups and downs that he said looking us straight in the eye is what life is all about. I am not keen on entertainers who pretend to be philosophers with a message. But the great ones get away with it - and Bing did. As for their voices, Bing cleverly attempts no more than he knows he can achieve. . .\n\n(Evening News, unknown date)\n\nSeptember 26, Friday. Bing writes to (1) Pat Sullivan, President of Club Crosby, and (2) Priscilla Koernig, vice-president of Club Crosby.\n\n(1) Im glad that you liked the album when you finally received it and that you have selected a favorite. I, too, like the one about Dancing The Way They Used To Dance. I used it the other night at a benefit in Beverly Hills and it went very well.\n\nI dont know what the plans are for promoting and releasing the album over here. Its up to United Artists of England. They have"
