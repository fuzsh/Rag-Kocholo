        "text": "Playmobil: The Movie, which stars Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) as the voice of Rex Dasher, has a new United States distribution company.\n\nDeadline Hollywood reported last week that US distribution rights to the animated film have been acquired by STX. Playmobil is scheduled to begin rolling out around the globe in August, but with the distribution switch, a definitive date for its US premiere has not yet been set. We'll keep you posted on that, but we do have an official description for you!\n\n'Playmobil: The Movie' is a comedy adventure where younger brother Charlie (Gabriel Bateman) unexpectedly disappears into a magical animated universe of Playmobil, and unprepared Marla (Taylor Joy) must go on a quest of a lifetime to bring him home, teaming up with some unlikely and heroic new friends along the way.\n\nThere are few things cooler than Warwick Davis (Griphook/Filius Flitwick) chillaxing with Chewbacca. And yes, we can actually prove that. SlashFilm.com provided an early glimpse last week into the upcoming book Making Solo: A Star Wars Story, and one of the preview photos featured Davis kicking back in a folding chair between takes alongside Joonas Suotamo in full Chewbacca regalia. The behind-the-scenes book will hit shelves April 16, but you can preorder your copy now on Amazon.\n\nDavis is also primed and ready to host the much-anticipated Star Wars Celebration panel for the 20th anniversary of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.\n\nThe panel will take center stage Monday at the Chicago festival and is being held this year in anticipation of the December 20 (December 19 in the United Kingdom) release of Star Wars: Episode IX. There's no official word yet on whether Davis is appearing in the film, but considering the number of characters he's brought to life for the saga in the past - the most famous, of course, being Wicket W. Warrick the Ewok - it's a somewhat safe assumption. Domhnall Gleeson (Bill Weasley) is for certain reprising his role as General Armitage Hux in the movie, and the wildly anticipated first trailer for Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker was released today at the Star Wars Celebration!\n\nBefore we head back from the galaxy far, far away, Mark Hamill also shared a touching story last week on Twitter about his initial meeting with Davis on the set of Return of the Jedi.\n\nFans immediately responded with a variety of adorable photos of Davis from that era, and you can view a few of them below.\n\nIn final Davis news, the actor had a few funny stories of his own to share at the opening of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank addition at Warner Bros. Studio Tour London, starting with a slippery situation for Ralph Fiennes in Malfoy Manor.\n\nI remember lying on the floor of Malfoy Manor in a pool of fake blood, and I was watching the great Ralph Fiennes in action through a little crack in my eyes. I watched him striding down with bare feet, and he slipped on the fake blood. It was like he'd slipped on a banana skin in a cartoon. You couldn't help but laugh. He soon got his composure back like the great actor he is and carried on being very bad.\n\nIn keeping with the banana theme, Davis also revealed his son, Harrison, had a high-maintenance-actor moment on the set of the final Potter film. We can hardly blame him, though. A kid's gotta eat!\n\nIn 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2', my wife and children played goblins. My son Harrison was six at the time and said he was hungry and couldn't wait. I had to go and ask if the crew could get Harrison something to eat. They then had to shut down filming for ten minutes so he could eat a banana before resuming. I don't know where he gets that attitude from!\n\nGleeson, meanwhile, was spotted last week in London going full Hux on an unfortunate Land Rover. The road rage was all an act, however, as Gleeson was busy shooting scenes for the Peter Rabbit sequel, in which he'll return as Thomas McGregor, with Rose Byrne, who was filming with him, back as Bea. You can view the photos, published last week by the Daily Mail, below. Peter Rabbit 2 is scheduled for a February 7, 2020, release.\n\nJames and Lucia, a film exploring the final years of acclaimed Irish writer James Joyce's life, has been a long time coming, but Screen International says Sir Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore) signed on to the project this week.\n\nGambon will portray Professor Alfred Vogt, who performed many operations on Joyce as the author descended into blindness. The film will also explore Joyce's fight to save his daughter, Lucia, who was labeled \"mad.\" Aidan Gillen (Littlefinger, Game of Thrones) was previously cast in the role of Joyce. Screen International says the project is aiming to begin production in November, shooting in Brussels and Dublin.\n\nGambon has two other projects in postproduction. Judy, which we told you about last year, the story of the decline of Judy Garland's career, in which Gambon plays London theater manager Bernard Delfont, has a September 27 release date. The film also enlisted the talents of Harry Potter costume designer Jany Temime. Gambon additionally appears as Moses in the psychological thriller Cordelia, and while that movie has no release date as yet, you can view a few stills and behind-the-scenes photos in the gallery below.\n\nRalph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) has reportedly joined Emma Stone in agreeing to star in director Alexander Payne's new project, The Menu.\n\nCollider says Fiennes is tabbed to play the \"twisted chef\" in the dark satirical comedy, which follows a young couple who travel to a remote island to attend an exclusive restaurant event where \"the acclaimed chef has prepared a lavish tasting menu, along with some shocking surprises.\"\n\nFiennes was also featured last week in GQ, opening up to the magazine about a wide variety of topics, including the fact his idea of perfect happiness is \"swimming naked in the sea.\" You can - and should - read the entire interview here and view photos from the accompanying shoot below.\n\nFiennes' nephew, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (11-year-old Tom Riddle), will finally see his first starring effort hit the big screen tonight as the fan fiction–turned-film After premieres at theaters around the country. Fiennes-Tiffin, who plays the Harry Styles–inspired character Hardin Scott, and costar Josephine Langford (Tessa) have been globetrotting for months in support of the movie, speaking with CP24 Breakfast in Canada last week. Fiennes-Tiffin admitted the fervor with which fans are awaiting After came as a bit of a shock, particularly considering he didn't know anything about the fanfic or ensuing novel series prior to being cast.\n\nI must have been living under a rock because everyone else does. Anna kind of warned us of the size of it, and I understood what she was saying, but I don't think I really... I think I slightly underestimated it. But I've been pleasantly surprised with how supportive the fan base are.\n\nYou can view that full interview below as well as another from Screen Rant.\n\nWe can't get over the transformation of the now-21-year-old actor from the child with whom we're familiar, and he told Gulf News this week that he definitely isn't recognized much for that role anymore.\n\nFiennes-Tiffin: I haven't been recognized for it much. I did it at a point where I changed how I looked quite quickly after.\n\nLangford: Puberty.\n\nFiennes-Tiffin: Yeah, that old thing.\n\nIt'll get you every time. Some more favorably than others. Need a few more looks? We don't blame you. Check out the gallery below for shots of Fiennes-Tiffin from the April 8 premiere of After in Los Angeles, courtesy of Just Jared, and also a photo from GQ, which lauded the young actor's choice of a double-breasted Dior suit for a screening of the movie in Paris.\n\nSo what will be coming after After? Deadline Hollywood reports Fiennes-Tiffin has been cast in the upcoming thriller The Silencing, playing Brooks, the troubled younger brother of Sheriff Alice Gustafson. Gustafson and a reformed hunter become involved in a deadly game of cat and mouse when they set out to track a vicious killer who may have kidnapped the hunter's daughter years before.\n\nIt's been a big week for Fiona Shaw (Petunia Dursley), thanks to the Season 2 premiere of the hit BBC America and AMC series Killing Eve, and it got even bigger when a third season was announced.\n\nDeadline Hollywood reports BBC America has approved the show for a Season 3, which will be helmed by a new writer, executive producer, and showrunner: British writer Suzanne Heathcote (Fear the Walking Dead).\n\nMeanwhile, Shaw and her costars, including Jodie Comer (Villanelle) and Sandra Oh (Eve), were out and about celebrating the start of Season 2, appearing at the AMC Network Summit in New York City and a private party at the home of AMC CEO Josh Sapan, where Shaw made a rare public appearance with her wife, Dr. Sonali Deraniyagala. You can see photos from those two events in the gallery below.\n\nShaw was also interviewed last week by Out, which asked her what she termed \"a brilliant question\": \"Do you think Aunt Petunia would watch 'Killing Eve'?\"\n\n[Laughs] That's a crazy question. No, she really wouldn't like it. I don't think she would like it at all. I think she would like to turn the television off.\n\nGary Oldman (Sirius Black) is continuing to film the drama/thriller Dreamland, set for a 2020 premiere, and his wife, Gisele Schmidt, posted a first look at the actor - who'll play Dr. Tyrone Brower - on set with costar Greg Kinnear.\n\nTimothy Spall's (Peter Pettigrew) new film, The Corrupted, is set to premiere May 3. Spall plays Clifford Cullen in the movie, and you can view the first official trailer below.\n\nThe Victim has made its debut on BBC One, and Kelly Macdonald (Helena Ravenclaw) sat down with the Guardian this week to discuss what it was like filming the tense drama, among other, more lighthearted topics. Macdonald says she enjoyed playing the role of grieving mother Anna.\n\nShe felt real: sympathetic at times, unlikable at others. The title is great because you're wondering who the victim is. Reading the script, my allegiances were switching, so I hope it's the same for viewers.\n\nShe also took a moment to rep the blue and bronze when the Guardian revealed to her she was the last actor ever cast for the Harry Potter films.\n\nReally? I knew I was last to film my scenes, so I was pretty much acting on my own - just me, a green screen, and a cardboard cutout of Daniel Radcliffe. It's always a thrill when I go into the 'Harry Potter' shop and see the navy-and-gray scarves. I think, 'That's my house!' I don't support any sports teams, so that's as close as I get. Team Ravenclaw!\n\nYou can read Macdonald's full interview, touching on her roles in Trainspotting, Brave, and more, here.\n\nSince the announcement that three wizarding world alumni have been cast in the impending prequel to Game of Thrones, we've been keeping you up to date on what could be in store for Miranda Richardson (Rita Skeeter), Jamie Campbell Bower (teen Gellert Grindelwald), and Toby Regbo (teen Albus Dumbledore). The prequel, which has been dubbed The Long Night by author George R.R. Martin, has yet to begin filming, but Martin - speaking with the Hollywood Reporter at the New York City premiere of GOT's final season - says, \"They're getting very close to that. They have a great director and an amazing cast.\" Martin also elaborated a bit further on the familiar-yet-new world in which viewers will find themselves.\n\nI've been following along closely. I have my fingers crossed. It's different. It's definitely very different. It's set thousands of years in the past. You're looking at a whole different era of Westeros. No dragons, no Iron Throne, no King's Landing. It will be interesting to see what the fans make of that.\n\nLast week, we gave you a first look and a trailer for Alfred Enoch's (Dean Thomas) upcoming debut on Season 2 of the BBC One series Trust Me, and this week, the actor spoke with the Daily Star about what it's been like to step into an ongoing show previously fronted by Jodie Whittaker (Doctor Who). Enoch told the Star he tends to put pressure on himself with every role he undertakes, but \"taking over from Jodie hasn't directly affected me.\"\n\nI'm playing a completely different part in a different story. I didn't come into this playing Jodie's part. It's a different story, characters, and city. However, that tense thriller element from the first series that made it so successful is still very much there. I like what the producers have done with the angle and the scripts. It makes for a good piece of TV.\n\nTrust Me debuts April 16.\n\nWe let you know in late March that Robert Pattinson's (Cedric Diggory) name had been mentioned in connection with an upcoming blockbuster by director Christopher Nolan, and now it seems Pattinson's involvement has been confirmed. MovieWeb reports the actor says he's read the script, and it's \"unbelievable.\" He can't divulge much more, however, as the project is top-secret.\n\nI got locked in a room to read the script - I don't have it myself. I've been a little wary of doing big movies for years and years, but there's just something about Chris Nolan's stuff. He seems like the only director now who can do what is essentially a very personal, independent movie that has huge scale. I read the script, and it's unreal.\n\nFreddie Stroma (Cormac McLaggen) will be making magic once again in an upcoming NBC comedy. Like Magic currently has a pilot episode in preproduction and will feature Stroma as Jake, the overworked entertainment director of the Magic Palace. Variety says Criss Angel will also be making a guest appearance in the episode as Trent, the leader of the familiarly named Ministry of Magic.\n\nThe workplace comedy follows an optimistic young woman (Jee Young Han, 'City of Dreams') pursuing her dream to be a headlining magician in the eccentric and ego-driven world of the Magic Palace.\n\nNo release date has yet been announced for Like Magic, but we'll keep you posted!\n\nWhile we know and love Brendan Gleeson as the constantly vigilant Mad-Eye Moody, the actor is also a talented musician, and he's lent his voice and fiddle to a song on Irish band Dervish's new album, The Great Irish Songbook. The Irish Examiner says Dervish singer Cathy Jordan was pleased to include Gleeson on the band's recording of \"Rocky Road to Dublin.\"\n\nWe know Brendan through music because he plays in sessions in Boyle. Once, he was on a tour with Mike McGoldrick, and everyone ended up in my house afterwards. We sang until all hours of the morning, so for us, he was always a singer and fiddle player. When it came to 'Rocky Road to Dublin,' we knew it had to be him.\n\nThe album was released today, and you can order yours in several different formats on Amazon.\n\nSean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood) is a really nice guy.\n\nMuggleNet told you last month that the actor - who played Sgt. Donald Odd in the 2016 movie Whisky Galore, filmed in Portsoy, Scotland - was headed back to the site of what he calls one of his favorite film projects to help raise funds for a local boat festival. While in Portsoy, the Press and Journal reports, he took time to officially open a new telescope installed in the city's harbor. Would Oliver Wood use it to spy on nearby rival Quidditch teams' practices? Probably. But Biggerstaff has no such dubious intentions. He was just being a sweetheart.\n\nI've spent many a happy day looking at and from this beautiful harbor front, and this makes it even better.\n\nComicBook.com released a first-look video Thursday of Anna Shaffer (Romilda Vane) in her latest role as Triss Merigold in the television adaptation of The Witcher. The eight-part series is based on the Andrzej Sapkowski book series of the same name and is scheduled to premiere on Netflix this year.\n\nAnna Shaffer as Triss spotted in Ogrodzieniec castle - more footage soon from r/netflixwitcher\n\nIt's apparently been several years since Jim Tavaré (Tom, landlord of the Leaky Cauldron) agreed to let his hair - erm, sideburns - down for I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu, but the April 23 premiere of the film is now imminent, the actor announced this week on Facebook. You can also view a trailer for the movie here.\n\nShowtime's upcoming miniseries The Loudest Voice, a look at the rise and fall of former Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes, has a star-studded cast, and among them is Simon McBurney (voice of Kreacher). The Hollywood Reporter took a look this week at the show and its actors, which also include Russell Crowe, Naomi Watts, Sienna Miller, Seth MacFarlane, and Josh Charles, and you can view the video below. McBurney is set to portray media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The Loudest Voice will premiere June 30.\n\nA song written by the Boss and originally offered to filmmakers for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has finally found a home, 18 years later.\n\nThe Wrap says Bruce Springsteen recorded \"I'll Stand by You Always,\" a tender song sung from the point of view of a man whose child comes crying to him in the night, in 2001, but J.K. Rowling had a stipulation that no commercial music be used in the Harry Potter films. The song will now be featured in the end credits of the upcoming movie Blinded by the Light, based on the memoir Greetings from Bury Park, by Sarfraz Manzoor, in which the Pakistan-born writer discusses his teen years in a small town in England and having his passion for writing fueled by Springsteen songs."
