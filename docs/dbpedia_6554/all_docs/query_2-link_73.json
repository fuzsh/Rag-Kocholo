In 1919 he limped back from the war with two crutches and many medals. He presented himself at the Milan.\n\n\"I have called because you asked me to, sir,\" he said to Sir Edward Rastall, chairman of the directors. \"There is nothing I can do for you, though. A maître d'hôtel on crutches could scarcely get through an hour's work a week.\"\n\nSir Edward took him by the arm and led him across the Court to the Grill Room entrance. It was five o'clock in the afternoon and the place was empty. Louis, who had turned his head away as he had driven up in his taxi to the front entrance of the hotel, looked sorrowfully at that fascinating wilderness of white linen and sparkling glass. Every one of those private corners, vantage places from which one could see and not be seen, and those other more flamboyant tables plumped down in full view of everybody, mostly in demand by the fair sex, brought its own peculiar memories. If he had been alone his eyes would soon have been dim.\n\n\"Louis,\" his companion said, \"do you know why we thought you worth two thousand a year to us before the war?\"\n\n\"Because I was reasonably good at my job, I hope, sir,\" the maître d'hôtel suggested.\n\n\"That, of course, but there are hundreds of others who are good at their jobs. You had what we thought a flair for placing your patrons. You see all those tables? It would take a diplomat to deal with the streams of people you had to deal with, to offend no one and please those who were worth pleasing. You did it, Louis. I have watched you sometimes—the plan in your hand, a speculative look in your eyes, a welcoming smile always there. You never made a mistake. Then, of course, just before the war the other thing came. You began \"to. be a useful man for your adopted country, long before the first shot of the war was fired.\"\n\n\"Strange things have happened here,\" Louis reflected.\n\n\"And stranger things may come,\" Sir Edward commented gravely. \"If you will turn your head you will see that we have done away with that ridiculous little bar and made what seems to be a low pulpit just inside the revolving doors.\"\n\n\"I was wondering what that was for, Sir Edward,\" Louis acknowledged.\n\n\"It is for you, my lad.\"\n\n\"What on earth could I do there?\"\n\n\"Go on earning your two thousand a year, of course,\" was the prompt reply. \"Every day you will have a fresh plan of the room and all correspondence with regard to the ordering of tables will be handed to you. You know the weaknesses of every one of our habitués. You will study them and you will know exactly what clients to encourage and which we are better without. You will sit in your easy chair there, watch the people come in, and seat them at your discretion. They will be satisfied—that is if we want them to be satisfied—and you will continue to draw your two thousand a year. A few more details later on. You start on Monday.\"\n\nSir Edward waved his hand and hurried away to avoid what he hated most in life—thanks. Monday morning found Louis ensconced in the easy chair that later on was to become historic.\n\nI. — \"MARIE LOUISE WILL BE THERE\"\n\nIT WAS José, the maître d'hôtel and supervisor of the tables at my end of the Milan Grill Room, who brought me the little scribbled note from Louis, who was occupying his usual place upon the raised and enclosed dais generally called \"The Pulpit.\" I untwisted the scrap of paper and read:\n\nPlease come to me for a moment.\n\nI had only just sat down—I had not as yet even ordered my luncheon—so I rose at once and went to Louis's desk. He held out his left hand with a little gesture for me to wait whilst he continued his conversation with two young people immediately in front of him. To my surprise he summoned José and calmly directed them to my table.\n\n\"Here, what are you up to, Louis?\" I protested.\n\n\"Isn't José making a mistake?\"\n\n\"Major Lyson,\" he replied, \"I beg you to remain where you are for a moment. You see, I purposely keep my head turned away but I wish you to look carefully at the third table down the main aisle.\"\n\n\"It is occupied,\" I observed, \"by a young man who sits alone.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" Louis assented, his pencil making idle marks upon the paper. \"Do you notice anything unusual about him?\"\n\nI glanced down the room again. The prospective luncher was harmless enough in appearance but in a sense I understood Louis's suggestion. He seemed to belong to an ordinary type of well-born young Englishman, very freckled, fair and good-looking, but just at this moment he appeared to be suffering from the jitters. I passed on my impressions to my companion.\n\n\"Jitters,\" he murmured, \"is not a word with which I am familiar but I will tell you, Major, how he looks to me. You see that his eyes never leave the door. He is watching for someone to come in. Give him your whole attention for one moment. I shall he occupied with this menu.\"\n\nI did as was suggested. I visualized that young man in a few seconds quite differently. He was no longer the harmless, good-looking Englishman awaiting the service of his luncheon. He was like a man who was either in fear of his life or who had designs upon someone else's. His eyes were hard and glacial. He watched the door with an attention that was altogether unnatural. The fingers that held the menu card were shaking. His lips moved—perhaps he was giving an order. It might have been so, for the waiter presently withdrew. The young man's eyes, however, were still fixed upon the door.\n\n\"You are quite right,\" I admitted. \"There is something wrong with that fellow.\"\n\n\"I shall ask you of your kindness,\" Louis said, \"to oblige me. That is why I have given your table away. I want you to make your approach and ask to be allowed to share his.\"\n\nI hesitated. Louis himself knew how unusual such a request would be from a perfect stranger.\n\n\"Supposing he refuses?\"\n\nLouis stroked his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"In that case,\" he decided, \"take the small table on the other side. It is the nearest from which you can observe him. It is promised to Mr. Thomson of the Star Film Company but I will arrange that.\"\n\nIt was a barren overture to one of those little incidents in the famous Milan Grill Room which had developed now and then into full-blown adventures. Nevertheless, I had learned to recognize Louis as the leading spirit in these enterprises and also to understand the wisdom of asking no more questions than necessary. I strolled down the room as though looking for a table and paused at the one occupied by the freckled young man. He started violently when he saw me standing there, shrunk a little away and his hand went into the pocket of his jacket; His eyes were full of dumb terror as he looked up at me.\n\n\"I'm very sorry to intrude,\" I said, smiling at him as though I recognized nothing unusual in his manner. \"The fact is that Louis has unintentionally given away my table. The place is very full, as you can see. I wondered if you would allow me the vacant seat at yours?\"\n\nThe young man's voice might under ordinary conditions have been a pleasant one, but all its natural qualities seemed drawn from it by the fear which was consuming him. I was not particularly enamoured, either, of the shaking hand, the fingers of which were grasping some article in his pocket.\n\n\"The place is already taken,\" was the hoarsely spoken reply. \"I am expecting a guest. Sorry. Please go away.\"\n\nI tried my best to behave as though my request were a usual one and my persistence perfectly natural.\n\n\"Couldn't I sit here for a few minutes?\" I suggested. \"My own table will probably be free then.\"\n\nHe was looking past me towards the door and there were beads of perspiration upon his forehead. The freckles which would have been becoming enough upon a sunburnt skin were ghastly blotches by reason of his unnatural pallor.\n\n\"Go away at once, please,\" he insisted. \"My—my friend is coming.\"\n\nI accepted my defeat, left him with a good-humoured nod and made my way to the small table on the other side of the gangway. There I sat and watched with curiosity the approach of my neighbour's prospective guest. She was coming down the carpeted way—a very small, very young girl, walking with the insolent grace and wearing the clothes of a gamine from the boulevards who had suddenly inherited a fortune. Everything about her was of the latest and the most extreme fashion and she presented without a doubt a striking picture. The young man staggered rather than rose to his feet and grasped the back of his chair with his left hand. She sank into the place opposite him and her black eyes flashed with mingled contempt and amusement. She crossed her legs, leaned back in her chair and summoned a waiter.\n\n\"I starve,\" she announced in a voice which was perfectly audible from where I sat. \"Bring the hors d'oeuvres and an apéritif—Pernod or Dubonnet glacé.\"\n\nThe waiter looked at her in surprise but bowed and hurried away. She leaned forward and patted her companion's hand. It was impossible to hear what she said but I gathered that she was endeavouring to infuse a little courage into his tortured apprehensions, He interrupted her with a fiercely asked question. He spoke in bad but easily comprehended French in a voice which must have carried it good deal farther than my table a few yards off.\n\n\"He will come here, you believe, this loathsome fellow whom I detest?\" he demanded. \"Smile no longer, Marie Louise. You make me furious. He will follow you here? You believe that?\"\n\nShe became a little graver and nodded a good many times. The young man was speechless. She leaned over the table, continued to pat his hand and dropped her voice so that I heard none of their conversation. All the time, though, I could see that right hand moving restlessly in his pocket. Whatever she was saying to him produced no soothing effect. Others besides myself were noticing his abject state. I rose to my feet and strolled back to Louis's desk.\n\n\"Mon ami,\" I warned him, \"there will arrive a tragedy at that table.\"\n\nLouis nodded and waited for me to continue.\n\n\"The young man refused me a place. He was evidently awaiting the arrival of this French flapper from the streets. She seems to be trying to give him courage, but alas I cannot hear their conversation.\"\n\n\"Difficult!\" Louis murmured.\n\n\"Yes, but one thing is certain to happen,\" I declared. \"He has one of those small revolvers in his right-hand pocket and he is twiddling it about with fingers that are shaking all the time. He will either shoot himself or someone else in a few minutes.\"\n\nLouis sighed.\n\n\"Alas,\" he regretted, \"I place you this morning, my dear fellow-confederate—if I may call you so—in an unpleasant situation. I beg you once more to interfere. Explain yourself as one associated with the place. Explain that you have seen the shape of the weapon in his pocket. Insist that he hand it over.\"\n\n\"I will do this,\" I agreed, \"but I shouldn't be at all surprised if I got a knife in my side from that young woman. I have seen some of her type in Marseilles. \"\n\n\"I watched her come in and I, too, am acquainted with the type,\" Louis confessed. \"I do not think that she will attack you. Her companion is not her sort. At any rate, you know my weakness. It is to keep all scandal from my restaurant. No more shall that young English aristocrat be permitted to enter, but I wish to get rid of him before tragedy arrives. That it will arrive before long I do not doubt, but I pray that it be not here.\"\n\n\"You know who he is?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. His name is Cumberley—the Honourable Charles Cumberley.\" .\n\n\"Any connection with our man in Paris?\"\n\nLouis held up his hand.\n\n\"That will do,\" he begged. \"You see how more than necessary it is for us to escape scandal. I myself have the idea that tragedy is very close at hand. Listen, Major. I ask a great deal, I know, but a\n\nmurder in my Grill Room would break my heart. Wait for a few moments, if you will, but if again you see that right hand find its way into his pocket make your intervention. Afterwards you may divest yourself of your official position, resume your scat and behave as you would if you were a normal guest of the restaurant. It is understood?\"\n\nI turned away. It was useless to argue with Louis.\n\n\"It is understood,\" I assured him.\n\nI resumed my seat and gave an order to the waiter. Then I glanced across the aisle as carelessly as I could. The argument between the two was still in progress. The condition of the young man was if anything still more abject. The girl showed signs of losing her temper. Every now and then her companion broke off to watch some newcomer enter through the revolving door, watch always with that strained look of fear in his eyes. Again the time came when his hand sought his pocket and I dared wait no longer. I rose to my feet, crossed the aisle and stood by the side of their table. The girl looked up at me with a half-impudent, half-friendly smile. The man, with difficulty, found courage to be rude.\n\n\"What the devil are you doing here again?\" he demanded. \"I told you this table was engaged.\"\n\n\"And if I am permitted to leave out the expletive,\" I rejoined, \"what are you doing sitting there in a partial state of collapse with your right hand in your coat pocket playing with a weapon of some sort? Be so good as to take your hand out and show me what you have there.\"\n\nI had spoken to him without any pretence at courtesy as I might have spoken to an insubordinate youngster in the drill hall. He stared at me and weakened.\n\n\"What business is it of yours?\" he retorted irritably. \"Get back—\"\n\n\"Don't try that on me,\" I interrupted. \"I have an official position here and no one is allowed in this country to carry loaded firearms. Give me what you have in that pocket.\"\n\nHe withdrew his hand slowly, raised his napkin to cover it and laid a very small revolver of the latest type upon the table. I lifted the edge of the napkin and slipped the safety catch into its place.\n\n\"You have no right to come in here,\" I told him severely, \"with a loaded revolver in your pocket.\"\n\nThe weapon was safely in my possession by this time. The young man leaned back in his chair, folded his arms and looked at me fixedly. For the first time he showed some gleam of spirit in his rescntment.\n\n\"Now that you have taken my only means of protection away,\" he said, \"you had better get back to your table and watch me murdered.\"\n\nI did my best to impart a reasonable amount of sympathy into my tone.\n\n\"I don't think I have done you any harm,\" I assured him. \"If you tried to make use of this weapon with your hand shaking as it was you wouldn't have hit a haystack. Very delicately tempered things, these small revolvers. You might even have injured Mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"I was telling him,\" she said, smiling up at me, \"how foolish he was. There is a man who would kill him if he could. That is nothing. It happens always in my country. But a crowded restaurant like this is the safest hiding-place one could choose. He has given me nothing to eat and I starve. Help me to convince him, Monsieur,\" she begged, \"that here at least he is in no danger.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about the facts of the case, of course,\" I pointed out, \"but the young lady shows common sense. I should think there is no place in London where you would be safer than here at the present moment.\"\n\n\"That is all very well,\" the man, who was really beginning to present a more reasonable appearance, declared, \"but the fact remains that there is a rav-\n\ning lunatic on his way to London who will certainly try to kill me on sight— probably Marie Louise also,\" he added, looking across the table at her.\n\nShe threw herself back in her chair and laughed mockingly.\n\n\"Oh, la la!\" she exclaimed. \"If he comes Von Hutt might pick me up from my chair and carry me away but he would not kill me. Never believe that, my dear Charles! He has the same passion for me as you have.\"\n\n\"Well, if you both place yourselves in my hands,\" I intervened, \"I will promise you safety from this ferocious gentleman.\"\n\nCumberley shook his head helplessly,\n\n\"If he doesn't force his way in here he will be lurking just outside,\" he declared. \"If he is not there he will be hiding in my rooms. There is no safety from a man who hates as this man hates.\"\n\n\"Tu es fou!\" the girl cried, opening her vanity case and taking out her lipstick. \"Why should he hate like that? He has lost me—for a time—but you have paid a great price, dear Charles. He has brains, that one. He will wait his time.\"\n\n\"You don't understand everything,\" Cumberley muttered.\n\nHer eyes flashed as she leaned towards him, the lipstick still held between her fingers. There was doubt in her eyes as well as anger.\n\n\"What is it that I do not understand?\" she demanded.\n\nHe hesitated. Afterwards I felt that if he had spoken at that moment the tragedy might never have happened. He lacked the courage, however.\n\n\"You don't understand how men feel when she-devils like you stir their blood,\" he groaned.\n\nThe doubt passed from the girl's eyes. She leaned back in her chair and laughed. There was music in her laughter, music but also sorcery. She finished with her lipstick and looked towards me.\n\n\"Monsieur has perhaps a proposition?\" she asked. \"Well, here's one for a start. Give this poor starving young lady her luncheon,\" I suggested, touching his shoulder lightly. \"Eat something yourself\n\nand drink a glass or two of wine. You can see everyone who enters, can't you?\"\n\n\"Everyone,\" he admitted'. \"That's why I chose this table.\"\n\n\"And if anyone comes in by the hotel entrance?\" I asked.\n\n\"Mademoiselle will see him,\" he pointed out. \"She knows whom to look for better than I do.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" I continued. \"Eat your lunch and I promise that you have only to make a sign to me and I will stop anyone coming anywhere near your table. When you have finished I will take you to Louis, the famous maître d'hôtel here, who has a small apartment on this floor, and if you care to tell your story we both have influence enough to offer you adequate police protection, or if it is something in which the police cannot interfere we can help you to get into a safer neighbourhood.\"\n\nThe young man was impressed. At her request I repeated what I had said in French to the girl. She clutched my hand with feverish delight.\n\n\"You are a friend!\" she exclaimed. \"You are a wonderful man. Please beckon to that waiter. We will eat. If Charles is in danger of being murdered I am in danger of being starved! You hear, Charles? We eat.\"\n\nIt was the girl who ordered the meal, which she did fluently and adequately. I returned to my table only a yard or two away and proceeded with my own interrupted luncheon.\n\nWhether it was because I was seated at a strange table or because my mind was already fully occupied with watching my two neighbours, I was never quite sure, but it is a fact that not until I lit my cigarette and commenced to sip my coffee did I become aware of a peculiar change in the little company of lunchers by whom I was surrounded. Two men whom I knew well, although we never recognized each other in public, from a certain department of the War Office, were lunching at an adjoining table and at the very next one were three plainclothes officials from Scotland Yard. Then on the other side, within a few yards of young Cumberley and his companion, was a man from the Foreign Office, one of our own ex-King's Messengers, who I knew was in the habit of still taking secret journeys in foreign countries, and a third younger man about whose doings there was also a certain amount of mystery. I realized at once that Louis had probably been justified in forcing me into a somewhat difficult position. There was something in the background concerning these two of infinitely greater importance than I had as yet comprehended. I glanced at my watch. A reasonable time for lunch had elapsed and Louis had already left his desk. I signed my bill and crossed the aisle.\n\n\"If you are ready,\" I said, addressing Cumberley, \"I think I can promise to escort you to a place of safety.\"\n\nThe young man rose slowly to his feet. The girl lit another cigarette and followed his example. The bottle of Burgundy in its cradle was empty, as were also their brandy glasses. The two had evidently lunched well notwithstanding the agitation of which there were still traces in Cumberley's bearing. He looked restlessly up and down the room.\n\n\"Queer lot of people here,\" he muttered.\n\n\"A barrage,\" I assured him lightly.\n\nThe girl glanced up at me and laughed. Her lips were a flaming scarlet but her cheeks remained deathly pale. Her eyes, with their beautiful lashes and extraordinary brilliance, were untouched. She was abnormal in every possible way and I was not altogether at my ease when she clutched my arm and we passed down towards the door. The young man walked so close to me that more than once he trod on my toes. He walked, too, with an unsteadiness for which the Burgundy was not altogether to blame. When we reached the door he made us precede him. From the foyer I led them both into Louis's private room and closed the door. Louis was seated at his desk waiting for us. He swung round and pointed to chairs. He offered no further courtesies to anyone and it was very clear to me, who knew him so well, that he was disturbed.\n\n\"Y ou will forgive my asking a question or two?\" he begged. \"You, young lady, I think are known in Paris by the name of Marie Louise Négrine?\"\n\nThe girl blew out a little volume of smoke from between her lips. She was evidently surprised.\n\n\"Is this a police station?\" she enquired.\n\nLouis replied in her own language.\n\n\"This is my private office,\" he explained, \"and I am only the manager of the Grill Room, but I possess certain privileges. You, sir, I believe are Charles Cumberley, the second son of Lord Cumberley?\"\n\n\"Does it matter who I am?\" the young man asked.\n\n\"To tell you the truth, it does,\" was the dry rejoinder. \" A certain person will be arriving in a few minutes who desires to cross-question you. I offer you a word of advice. Tell the truth.\"\n\nCumberley scowled.\n\n\"Is that meant to be an insult?\" he demanded.\n\n\"It is exceedingly good advice,\" Louis assured him. \"You will do well, sir, to follow it.\"\n\nMademoiselle, who had been gazing into the mirror which she had drawn from her vanity case, added a further splash of colour to her lips and closed the bag with a snap. Of the little company she was without a doubt the only one who was entirely at her ease.\n\n\"For me,\" she declared, \"I tell the truth always. It is a foolish habit but I do it —except to my lovers, of course,\" she added. \"To tell the truth always to them would make life impossible.\"\n\nThe young man looked at her fiercely. She remained indifferent. There was a knock at the door.\n\nA well-known figure entered. I rose to my feet respectfully. The newcomer, my direct Chief, General Fitzhaven, who was head of the little liaison staff between two great institutions, took a seat.\n\nObeying a gesture from Louis I locked the door.\n\n\"So this is the young couple you and I have been discussing, Louis,\" the General remarked. \"Mademoiselle seems pretty well true to type. You appear to have crumbled away a bit, Cumberley, since you made your last century at Lords.\"\n\nThe young man was a little shamefaced.\n\n\"I had fever out East, sir,\" he explained. \"That is why, when my father went to Paris, I was transferred there.\"\n\nFitzhaven sat for a moment in thoughtful silence.\n\n\"So you had an uncomfortable luncheon, I hear,\" he observed abruptly.\n\n\"How did you hear that, sir?\" was the startled reply.\n\n\"Oh, my old friend Louis sends me some peculiar messages now and then,\" the other confided. \"A very observant fellow, Louis. If he had continued in the service I expect he would have been occupying my position by now.\"\n\n\"May I enquire what that position is?\" Cumberley asked.\n\n\"You may enquire,\" was the polite rejoinder. \"I shall not answer your question. It is I who have a few queries to put to you.\"\n\n\"I don't quite see what all this is about,\" Cumberley began.\n\n\"For a young man who was in abject fear of his life a short while ago you are beginning to pick up spirit,\" the General remarked. \"Well, we proceed. I shall begin with you, young lady. It was to you that Charles Cumberley in Paris handed over this amazing document, or was it a map? I must confess that I have not seen it myself but it has been reported to the department of which I am the head that the documents in question were passed over by you to a Captain Von Hutt—a German agent living in Paris.\"\n\nThere was an almost deathlike stillness in the room. The girl was staring at the General in blank and stupefied silence. It was impossible for her to have gone any whiter but in her almost childish face there was a haggard expression. Her small bosom was rising, and falling quickly. She seemed to have lost her breath. The General watched her for a moment with a sardonic smile, then he turned enquiringly to Cumberley but Cumberley was without words.\n\n\"Yours was a terrible story, young man,\" he said sternly.\n\n\"I—I don't understand,\" Cumberley gasped. \"What story?\"\n\n\"The story which in your own handwriting was pinned to the map and handed over to Von Hutt.\"\n\n\"To Von Hutt,\" the listener breathed, and the words seemed to be drawn from his trembling lips by some unseen force.\n\n\"You claimed,\" the General continued in an icy tone, \"that on a certain day in October—the date and hour were given—you were secreted in an ante-room of the British Embassy and overheard a conversation between a prominent Englishman and a certain Frenchman of distinction. The latter confided to the Englishman that a vital portion of one of the world's greatest systems of fortification situated—shall we say?—in France had suffered one of those silent earthquakes which sometimes arise in vicinities where a good deal of subterranean work has been done. What this meant was not dwelt upon. It was not necessary. But the Frenchman had come to beg that at all costs hostilities with any invading country should be postponed until the fortifications were restored, as a certain dangerously vulnerable spot would give an enemy attack an enormous advantage. The information was passed on as desired to London. Whether it had any effect there no one outside Downing Street will ever know.\"\n\nI think we were all a little bewildered. To me the story was amazing. Louis himself was clutching at the sides of his chair. Cumberley was entirely incapable of speech. The General looked thoughtfully at the fire for several moments.\n\n\"That was the story,\" he went on, \"which an imaginary Frenchman was supposed to have told to an imaginary Englishman. A marvellous piece of secret history. Charles Cumberley wrote it down. Tell us again, young man, what did you do with those notes of yours and that roughly sketched map?\"\n\nCumberley glared across the room. He had staggered to his feet. He seemed to be on the brink of lunacy.\n\n\"She knows!\" he muttered, pointing across at the girl.\n\n\"Quite so,\" the General observed calmly. \"You gave them to her. Why?\"\n\n\"Because I was mad!\" Cumberley cried, suddenly raising his voice. \"I cannot see her with your eyes. To you she is a common little thing of the streets with a queer call in her eyes—eyes which call and call to men until they, poor devils, scarcely know whether they are sane or not. To me she was compelling. I would have given my life and soul for her. Those written words of mine and the map were the price she asked—something that would make her famous with the underground world she loved. Curse them all!\"\n\n\"You know what she did with them, I suppose?\" the General asked.\n\n\"Did with them?\" Cumberley shouted, shaking with excitement. \"She sold or gave them to the man she was crazy about—the German, Von Hutt.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" General Fitzhaven agreed sombrely. \"She gave them to Von Hutt. You got what you wanted for them, I suppose?\"\n\n\"What is it worth?\" Cumberley cried fiercely. \"I suppose she played up to her code. What is it worth? She is driving me mad every second I spend with her. Any slut in the street would be as good in your arms as a girl who thinks all the time of nothing but another man!\"\n\nThe General sighed.\n\n\"Dear me,\" he said, \"you don't either of you seem to have got much out of this little transaction. You, Cumberley, although you are still alive with the girl in your keeping—Von Hutt because he is dead.\"\n\nVery slowly the girl turned her head. I remeber that during those few seconds the stillness in the room was an awful thing.\n\n\"C' est pas vrai!\" she cried. \"Captain Von Hutt, he left France without trouble. He is in Berlin to-day.\"\n\nGeneral Fitzhaven shook his head.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" he confided, speaking in her own language, \"you are very much mistaken. Cumberley here seems to have been unnecessarily terrified about this fellow. He has been living in a state of panic, afraid that he might follow him to London and snatch you away. Perhaps he might have done but you see he never had the chance. He was shot the day he got to Berlin.\"\n\nThe girl's shriek was a ghastly sound in the small room. Suddenly it was broken off.\n\n\"Why was he shot?\" she demanded. \"Explain.\"\n\nThis time the General smiled.\n\n\"I thought Frenchwomen of your type were less credulous,\" he confessed. \"Did you really think that Cumberley was telling you the truth, did you really think that that map represented something which had actually occurred? Did you really believe that the conversation he wrote about ever took place? The poor fellow—he was crazy for you, I suppose. It was the only price you would accept, so he set his brain to work and he produced this ingenious concoction of falsehood.\"\n\nShe rose to her feet. All her contemptuous insolence of manner seemed to have gone. She had changed places with Cumberley. It was she now who was trembling from head to foot. She faced her late companion and her eyes were ablaze.\n\n\"Is this true?\" she gasped. \"Did you deceive me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You let him go back to his country with a falsely drawn map and a lie upon his lips?\"\n\n\"Serve him right!\" Cumberley replied savagely. \"I couldn't get you any other way but I didn't think they would tumble to it so quickly.'\"\n\nIt was a queer thing that not one of us, even though the murderous fire was aflame in her eyes and her features were twitching with ferocious passion, not one of us foresaw what might happen. She moved a yard or two towards Cumberley, so slowly that we were not even alarmed. Her final leap was an amazing effort. There was something in her hand—she had been feeling at her knee even before she moved—something bright and glittering. Before we could reach her it was in Cumberley's side and she was gripping his throat, tearing at his face, shouting furious abuse at him in an argot which no one understood. I was the nearest but when I tore her away the affair was finished.\n\nMany hours, even days, passed and there existed between Louis and myself a curious, almost an inexplicable, silence. At last one evening he sent me one of his twisted-up messages and I called in to have a glass of his famous Armagnac after I had finished a lonely dinner. Even then I had smoked a couple of cigarettes and Louis was half-way through his cigar before the harrier was raised. Louis was holding his cigar well away from him and gazing into the fire.\n\n\"Some of your British institutions, Major,\" he began, \"are indeed admirable.\"\n\n\"General Fitzhaven?\"\n\nHe nodded gravely.\n\n\"Consider for a moment the events of the other day,\" he continued. \"You and I were ordered out of our own premises. The General took command. In the morning this room showed no signs of that little visitation. Three lines in various newspapers have recorded the sad death of young Cumberley in a shooting accident on the family estate in Northumberland, where, by the by, he was buried yesterday. As for the girl—\"\n\nLouis seemed to have fears that his cigar might go out. He smoked for a few seconds and then once more removed it from his mouth.\n\n\"The girl?\" I queried softly.\n\n\"Spirited away,\" he went on. \"Somewhere in France—alive but dumb, I believe, as to all that happened. There are hospitals of that sort.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" I ventured after a somewhat prolonged pause, \"I shall always believe that one day, if I walk down the Canebière in Marseilles or pass the Taverne Noire in Montmartre I shall see her lounging there with a cigarette in a long holder between her fingers and that diabolically insolent smile upon her lips.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Louis concluded enigmatically.\n\nII. — THE KIDNAPPING OF MR. PETER JARDINE\n\nI DROVE my car into the members' garage at Woking, handed my clubs to a caddie and, as was my custom, strolled into Dyman's—the professional's—shed. I found him engaged in conversation with one of the quaintest-looking individuals I have ever encountered upon a golf course. Dyman greeted me in his usual respectful fashion.\n\n\"Half-a-dozen Stamford Flyers,\" I ordered. \"And what about a round?\"\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir,\" the professional replied. \"I'm afraid that I'm engaged this morning.\"\n\nThe man's answer was a surprise to me. Tuesday is a very quiet morning at most of the Golf Clubs round London, especially at Woking where the majority of the members are engaged in legal pursuits. Besides, Dyman was in a way engaged to play with me every Tuesday morning unless I telephoned to the contrary.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir,\" he apologized. \"It just happens that something unexpected has turned up. If you would care for a game, this gentleman was asking me to find him one if possible.\"\n\nI turned towards the other occupant of the professional's shop and hesitated.\n\n\"The gentleman's name is Mr. Stavert, sir,\" Dyman continued. \"He came down with a card from Sir William Pollock. This is Major Lyson, sir.\"\n\n\"I shall be happy to play a round with you, Major Lyson,\" the stranger remarked simply.\n\nI'm afraid my reply was not quite as spontaneous as courtesy demanded. Mr. Stavert was pale and thin and possessed a distinct stoop of the shoulders. He was dressed in dark clothes which bore no relation to any game or sport, he wore a stiff collar and a bowler hat. The only thing about him that suggested golf was a pair of black suede shoes with rubber soles. He carried in his hand a most extraordinary brown-leather case of the shape of a fire-extinguisher. His tout ensemble was unlike anything I had ever seen before on any known golf links. However, Pollock was all right so I pulled myself together.\n\n\"I shall be very pleased,\" I agreed. \"Are you ready to start?\"\n\n\"Any time,\" was the polite reply. \"As the morning is warm I will take off my coat. Perhaps Dyman will send it into the dressing room.\"\n\nHe divested himself of the garment in question, under which he wore a plain black sweater. His linen collar and tie remained. He opened the extraordinary leather affair which he was carrying and drew out the shaft of a golf club with no head. The case was fitted with what seemed to be six different-shaped heads belonging to a driver, a brassie, a cleek, a putter; a spoon and a mashie. They were all brilliantly polished and the wooden heads carefully wrapped in woollen mittens. He selected the cleek head and screwed it on.\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" I exclaimed, bending over it. \"You will forgive me but what on earth have you got there?\"\n\n\"This,\" Mr. Stavert replied, \"is my complete golfing outfit. I make a rule, however, to leave the whole paraphernalia in the club house after I have decided which head to use.\"\n\n\"You play with one club all the way round?\" I asked incredulously.\n\n\"That is my custom.\"\n\nI looked at Dyman. Dyman was carefully gazing out of the window.\n\n\"You play with balls, I suppose?\" I enquired idiotically.\n\nMr. Stavert justifiably ignored my remark. He handed two boxes of balls, which he had evidently just selected, and a packet of tees to Dyman.\n\n'Please give these to the caddie,\" he said.\n\n\"You surely won't require two boxes of balls!\" I ventured.\n\nMr. Stavert smiled.\n\n\"I hope not,\" he said. \"As a matter of fact, it is very rarely that I lose a ball, but as you see I have queer golfing habits. I like a new ball on every tee.\"\n\nThere was nothing more to be said about it. I led the way outside to where my boy was waiting and Dyman handed the balls to the other caddie.\n\n\"Is this all I've got to carry?\" the latter asked perplexed.\n\n\"And the tees,\" my opponent put in.\n\nWe started off. Mr. Stavert, to my relief, left his bowler hat behind him. He had very neatly brushed black hair faintly streaked with grey. He carried his single club under his arm.\n\n\"It is a custom of mine,\" he said on the way to the first tee, \"to play for some trifle.\"\n\nI looked at his one club. I glanced at his costume—and I had hard work to refrain from smiling.\n\n\"What is your handicap?\" I asked.\n\nMr. Stavert was slightly embarrassed.\n\n\"I play a great deal,\" he admitted, \"but seldom in competitions. My last registered handicap was fourteen. And yourself, Major Lyson?\"\n\n\"I am six here,\" I told him. \"That means six strokes for you. What do you wish to play for? I would suggest half-a-crown.\"\n\nWe had reached the first tee. Mr. Stavert was swinging his club in somewhat stiff fashion.\n\n\"Will you humour me if I ask for what may appear a Quixotic wager?\" he begged. \"I should like to wager ten pounds to be given to any golfing charity you prefer, if you should happen to win, against a luncheon.\"\n\n\"A luncheon?\" I repeated, somewhat startled. \"The odds don't seem quite even, do they? A luncheon where—here?\"\n\nMr. Stavert shook his head.\n\n\"Oh no,\" he answered. \"If I should by chance win I will ask you to give me lunch at the Milan Grill Room on any day I might select next week.\"\n\nI began to think that I had come across a lunatic.\n\nThen I wondered. The man knew who I was. There might be some method in his peculiar suggestion.\n\n\"As far as I remember,\" I told him, \"I am engaged next week only for Friday. If you will strike out Friday I will play you for lunch with pleasure, but if you will forgive my suggesting it, I think if you really propose to play with only one club you should permit me to offer you a little more in the way of handicap.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\"Mr. Stavert said, \"I am quite satisfied.\"\n\n\"But what about bunkers?\" I asked, glancing at his cleek.\n\n\"I seldom visit a bunker,\" was the calm reply.\n\n\"Your putting, then?\"\n\n\"I putt very well with a cleek. Your honour, Major Lyson.\"\n\nMy caddie teed my ball and after a practice swing with my driver—it was a one-shot hole—I played and sliced it a little but was only a few feet to the right of the green. My companion pointed carelessly to a spot on the tee and watched his ball being placed. He omitted the formality of a practice swing and laid a three- quarter shot within the boundary of the green about ten yards the other side of the hole. I am sorry to say that my expletive savoured a little of rudeness.\n\n\"You really must excuse me,\" I begged as I fell into step with him, \"but that was an extraordinarily good shot for a cleek, especially one manufactured on the premises, as it were. Straight as a die, too.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" Mr. Stavert said. \"I am seldom off the line with my cleek. You had the idea, perhaps, that the screwing on of the heads affects the quality of the club itself. I can assure you that it is not so. I have a driver head which I use on longer courses which possesses as much resilience as any club I can buy. Of course,\" he went on modestly, \"physique makes a difference and I must always be behind the powerfully built man. Otherwise, as far my clubs are concerned I can hold my own.\"\n\n\"But where on earth did you get the idea from?\" I asked. \"I have never heard of anything of the sort. One shaft and six heads.\"\n\n\"I never use more than one head during the match,\" he explained. \"I have to make up my mind which according to the nature of the course. I have found that the concentration entailed and engendered by that method results in a greater amount of accuracy.\"\n\nI lit a cigarette and held my peace. I had yet to make up my mind whether I was playing with a sane man or a lunatic. I chipped on to the green about three feet from the hole. My companion took up an orthodox and completely correct stance, shortened his hold of his club and hit a ball cleanly and sweetly to about the same distance from the hole. It was just my play and to my delight I holed out. My companion gravely took the line of his putt and hit his ball without faltering to the bottom of the tin. There was something to my mind almost fatalistic about that first putt of his. I felt that if there had been a worm-cast in the way or any obstacle of any sort the ball was hit so accurately that it would have ended exactly where it had ended.\n\n\"A half,\" Mr. Stavert observed. \"An excellent commencement.\"\n\nWe walked to the next tee. This, too, unlike the conditions upon most well-known golf courses, was a possible one-shot hole. I laid my ball on the far corner of the green. Mr. Stavert lengthened his swing a little and without the slightest effort placed his ball two yards from the pin. I failed to get dead. Mr. Stavert hit an excellent putt to the edge of the hole. I missed my attempt at a half and we walked on to the third tee. I was one down.\n\nThis is not a golf story and I will be content with saying that my companion displayed a skill in the handling of his one club which was little short of\n\nuncanny. On the few occasions when such a thing was necessary, he laid the face back and lofted as though he were using a mashie. When a longer shot was required from the tee he simply lengthened his swing, followed through to the extreme extent and kept his line with deadly accuracy. Playing as well as I knew how, I was beaten three up and two. A harmless bet—the drinks at the bar—I succeeded in winning. I hurried over my wash and stole a word or two with Dyman before my companion was ready for lunch.\n\n\"What demon of a fellow is this you have picked up, Dyman?\" I asked him. \"Where did he come from? Who is he? Who did he get to make that extraordinary outfit?\"\n\n\"Major,\" the professional said earnestly, \"I know no more about him than you do. I can only tell you this. He was down here one day last week but he didn't play. He talked for a time with the steward and he came out to see me. All that he wanted to know was what day he could be sure of finding you here. We both told him Tuesday. Here he is.\"\n\n\"Do you know that he plays scratch golf?\"\n\nDyman smiled a little incredulously.\n\n\"I saw his first shot, sir,\" he remarked, \"and that was a fine one.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about him?\" I persisted.\n\n\"Not one single thing in the world, sir,\" Dyman assured me, \"except that he came down here with one intention only in his mind and that was to play a round of golf with you.\"\n\nAnd with that I went in to lunch.\n\nI found Mr. Stavert, although not conversational, by no means secretive and in his calm way an inoffensive companion. He was an American, it seemed, born near Pittsburgh. He had studied engineering in every branch and his great hobby in life was the personal manipulation of metals in any shape or form. His education seemed to have been a varied one. He had studied at Harvard, at Heidelberg and taken a degree at Oxford, but he spoke most enthusiastically of the time he had spent at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I gathered that his interests had been chiefly commercial and he was without a doubt a man of means. He appeared to have no remarkable affection for games of any sort but he had invented his curious system of playing golf entirely as a whim, purely—as he described it—the reactionary aversion of a man of common sense against the transport round the golf links of the world of several millions of golf clubs every Saturday and Sunday. He had patented his system but never put it on the market. Apparently few things which he did were attempted in normal fashion. He was driving a car which had no gear box, the secrets of which he would tell to no one. He was absolutely indifferent to money and of what his main occupation in life was he gave me no possible clue. He ate and drank temperately and he bade me farewell immediately the meal was over. He offered me not the slightest explanation of his peculiar wager but when we shook hands at parting he looked at me for a moment keenly.\n\n\"You will find a note from me on Monday morning at the Milan Grill Room, Major Lyson,\" he said. \"It will tell you on which day I shall require the settlement of your debt. I shall avoid Friday. I think that the day will be a week to-day —Tuesday. I have taken the liberty, by arrangement with the steward, of making you my guest for lunch to-day.\"\n\n\"I would like to see your car,\" I told him.\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"You would find nothing remarkable externally,\" he said. \"Internally it is sealed to everyone. Some day, if I need money, you may meet a million of them upon the streets.\"\n\nWith which little prophecy Mr. Stavert took his leave of me and of the Woking Golf Club.\n\nAt one o'clock on Tuesday, which was precisely the hour mentioned in the note which I had received on the previous day, Mr. Stavert entered the Grill Room Lounge and Cocktail Bar. The guest, however, with whom he had threatened me in his hasty note, turned out to my surprise to be a woman. Nothing in Mr. Stavert's conversation during our round of golf or at lunch had suggested any preoccupation with the other. sex. He looked more like a mute at a funeral than ever in his dark clothes, black hat and dark grey suede gloves. His companion, however, who wore magnificent sables and, notwithstanding a slightly bored air, was distinctly attractive, seemed to belong to another world.\n\n\"I have taken the liberty, Major Lyson, of including my daughter in your invitation,\" he said. \"Stella, this is Major Lyson.\"\n\nI shook hands and she favoured me with a languid smile.\n\n\"I hear you played golf with my father,\" she remarked as we strolled towards the entrance of the Grill Room. \"What did you think of his outfit?\"\n\n\"Marvellous,\" I replied. \"So was his game. You know that he beat me?\"\n\n\"He mentioned it.\"\n\n\"I regret it no more,\" I said with a feeble attempt at gallantry, \"since I gained the pleasure of this luncheon.\"\n\n\"Very nicely spoken,\" she acknowledged. \"I hope that you meant it.\"\n\nWe established ourselves at my usual table, which had been slightly enlarged. The girl looked about her with lazy curiosity. Her father's eyes dwelt for some moments upon the manager of the Grill Room's commanding form.\n\n\"So that,\" he reflected, \"is Louis.\"\n\nI had already ordered luncheon, a fact which my guests seemed to appreciate. They preferred vodka with their caviar to cocktails beforehand so we commenced the meal at once. Almost as soon as we had begun Mr. Stavert astonished me.\n\n\"You know who I am, Major Lyson?\" he asked.\n\nI looked at him in surprise.\n\n\"I only know what you tell me and that your name is Stavert,\" I replied. \"I certainly did not know that you were married or that you had such a charming daughter.\"\n\nShe made a little grimace at me. The expression on Stavert's hard face remained changeless.\n\n\"My real name,\" he, said with a glance around, \"is Peter Stavert Jardine.\"\n\n\"Not—\"\n\n\"Yes, Peter Jardine, as I am known by everyone. The richest man in the world! A melancholy inconvenience, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"Very few people would think so.\"\n\n\"Americans would not be so keen,\" he assured me. \"You probably never read American items of news or you might remember that I have been kidnapped three times and the last time narrowly escaped with my life.\"\n\n\"A most unpleasant experience,\" I murmured.\n\n\"I believe Father. rather enjoyed it,\" his daughter observed. \"He came back and ate an enormous supper and by some chicanery or other he avoided paying his ransom.\"\n\nMr. Jardine stroked his chin thoughtfully,\n\n\"I am not sure that that was wise,\" he reflected.\n\n\"The Mulloy gang have got it in for me. Things, I might confess to you, Major Lyson, became very difficult for me in the States. I came over to England as a last resource. I have been staying at the Ritz Hotel with every room on the floor taken up by my own private detectives and a few other little precautions against surprises, with which I will not burden you. Did you notice how many cars there were in the garage at the Golf Club?\"\n\n\"Five beyond my own,\" I said.\n\n\"One of those five was mine, the other four were occupied by my bodyguard. You must have noticed them bobbing up at odd times on the round.\"\n\n\"I should have noticed that more at any other place than Woking,\" I told him. \"There are several rights of way across the course.\"\n\n\"Well, two nights ago the Mulloy gang nearly got me,\" Mr. Jardine continued. \"I gave notice to leave the Ritz. If they got at me once they can get at me twice. I shall come to the Milan.\"\n\nI said nothing. Both Louis and I were on intimate terms with the small board of management and I was not at all sure that the presence of such a client as Mr. Peter Jardine would be welcome.\n\n\"Do you approve of the change, Miss Jardine?\"\n\nI asked her, across the table.\n\n\"I really don't care,\" she replied. \"On the whole, though, I think it would be better to get much farther away if one could.\"\n\n\"What made you choose the Milan?\" I asked her father.\n\n\"'Because during the last few years,\" he explained, \"from what one hears this place has been very well directed. Foreigners are not welcomed here as they are at every other hotel and I am told rhat your head man—Louis—is wonderfully quick at detecting criminals and people of doubtful character. To-day, for the first time, I am enjoying my lunch because I look around and I see no one in the least suspicious. Everyone seems to have affairs of their own and to be looking after them.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" I told him, \"but you would receive no sort of protection here, I am afraid. The number of tables is limited and Louis is a martinet as to overcrowding the place. I doubt whether he would knowingly reserve a table for anyone of your bodyguard, for instance. He wants to keep the place for his regular clients and if there is anything he dreads it is disturbance of any sort in the restaurant.\"\n\n\"They're sorry enough to part with me at the Ritz,\" Mr. Jardine observed. \"Still, we must see what the manager has to say. You lunch here most days yourself, don't you, Major Lyson?\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact I do,\" I admitted, \"but I have no definite connection with the establishment.\"\n\n\"I have heard you are a clever fellow,\" Mr. Jardine said bluntly. \"I will give you a hundred pounds a week to keep an eye on me whilst I am here.\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Couldn't be done, sir,\" I regretted. \"I have already an official post in one of the public services.\"\n\n\"Chuck it, then. I'll double the hundred a week.\"\n\nI shook my head again.\n\n\"I'm afraid money doesn't count in this case,\" I explained. \"You had better make your own arrangements with the management, Mr. Jardine. I will introduce you to Louis, if you like, but I should not say a word about requiring protection.\"\n\nMr. Jardine scowled at me. Stella, who, since she had raised her veil, was recognizable as an exceedingly good-looking young woman, leaned across the table.\n\n\"Why can't you help look after Father?\" she asked. \"It's a man's way of earning money, anyhow, and he is a sportsman all right even though he did bilk that last lot of kidnappers.\"\n\n\"I have, alas, other obligations,\" I told her.\n\n\"Are you married?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nShe smiled at me and I liked the little glint of humour in her eyes.\n\n\"You wouldn't like to marry possibly the richest woman in the world and look after your father-in-law, would you?\"\n\n\"It is an exciting notion,\" I admitted, \"but I should be no good in a battle against thugs.\"\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\"What is more important,\" she murmured, \"is whether you would make a good husband.\"\n\nFor almost the first time her father smiled.\n\n\"Nothing in the world is so selfish,\" he remarked, \"as the modern daughter.\"\n\nAfter that the tension of the conversation seemed somewhat broken. At the conclusion of the meal I introduced Louis, who adopted a very guarded attitude and, although he scoffed at the idea of anyone meeting with harm in his beloved Grill Room, committed himself in no way. Afterwards I accompanied Mr. Jardine and his daughter to the manager's office and left them there. As far as I was concerned the matter was at an end.\n\nRather to my surprise the proposals of Mr. Peter Jardine were enthusiastically received by the management of the hotel. In' a few days Mr. Jardine and his daughter became habitués of the Grill Room, where they were allotted a table in the window some little distance from my own. By degrees we noticed, too, the drifting into the room always to the same places of several strangers, obviously American, all of a certain type—which proved to us the continued existence of Mr. Jardine's bodyguard. Louis heard and passed the information on to me that the gentleman in question had taken the whole of the fourth floor overlooking the Embankment, an enterprise which had never been attempted before by even the wealthiest of Indian Princes. I paid my respects to the two one morning a few days after their appearance at luncheon but although they were pleasant it seemed to me that I was not received with any great enthusiasm. Mr, Jardine, like many wealthy men, objected to having an offer of his declined and the girl herself seemed in some way also to resent it. I left them alone and turned my mind to other matters. Several new habitués of the place were giving us a little trouble and Louis was continually seeking my advice on matters which it seemed to me were of minor importance. Towards the end of the second week after Mr. Peter Jardine's arrival, I lunched at my club with a special purpose in my mind. I found Sir William Pollock there and drew him on one side.\n\n\"Sir William,\" I began, \"you will find yourself in disgrace with the committee at Woking Golf Club, I'm afraid. You have introduced a member there under a false name.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" the distinguished lawyer replied. \"He has a perfect right to use only his first name if he wants to.\"\n\n\"He rather denies his real identity by doing so, doesn't he?\" I argued.\n\n\"Young fellow,\" was the grim rejoinder, \"I hear that you played with the old man and he gave you a beating. No need for you to be sore about it. He told me once that he had spent nearly a million dollars on golf. We can't compete with that, you know.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose he's living over here for?\" I asked.\n\nSir William looked grave.\n\n\"I can only tell you what my staff and a few others know,\" he said. \"The affairs of a client like Jardine are scarcely for discussion. He is afraid of being kidnapped and from what he tells me he certainly would have been before long in the States. Here he is much safer. But if you want to know what he has been here for I can tell you one thing. He has drawn up and carried into effect the most elaborate and ingenious scheme I could ever have conceived for dealing with his estate if they had got hold of him, or if they do in the future. Not one penny is to be paid as ransom under any conditions, none of his enormous holdings in industrials all over the world are to be thrown upon the market, his family and charities are all looked after and yet his daughter will be the richest woman alive. It is beautifully done. He could be kidnapped to-morrow and with the help of his lawyers in New York we could carry on every one of his undertakings without a hitch.\"\n\n\"A Trust Company or something of that sort, I suppose?\"\n\nSir William nodded.\n\n\"A mighty brain, that man,\" he said. \"Pity you didn't get on better with him.\"\n\nI was willing to grant Mr. Jardine the mighty brain but it seemed to me that he was not very much enjoying life considering his position. There was always some gossip floating about concerning his doings. If he went to the theatre he practically booked every box in the place and lined the streets and corridors with plainclothes watchmen. How he managed to keep it all so quiet astonished me, although I was told later on that the sums he spent upon the Press were enormous. He went to no public dinners, he seldom left the hotel after dusk. The strain, however, it seemed to me, was beginning to tell upon him. One day when he didn't arrive for lunch to my surprise José brought me a message. Miss Jardine would be glad if I would take coffee with her at her table.\n\nI made my way there at once.\n\n\"Father has gone off with his army to Sunningdale,\" she announced. \"Why don't you come and see us sometime?\"\n\n\"You never invited me,\" I reminded her. \"Besides, you cannot have much time to spare. I seem to read your name in the paper as having been at one of these big shows or the opera every night.\"\n\n\"I have been going out a good deal,\" she admitted. I have a very competent chaperon and a companion, both chosen from the inner circles of your aristocracy and both terribly dull. I should like to invite you to take me to another sort of party some day.\"\n\n\"Delighted,\" I replied with a reasonable amount of enthusiasm. \"By-the-by, I don't think this place agrees altogether with your father. He doesn't look nearly so well lately and he seems to be losing weight.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"I don't think he's terribly fit,\" she acknowledged. \"Who could be, living his sort of life? I really think he would enjoy being kidnapped and having a game of poker at night with his jailers.\"\n\n\"He has some friends over here, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Very few,\" she answered, \"and those he has he seems to avoid. What would really have done him good would have been if you had taken him on. It might have made things a little livelier for me, too.\"\n\n\"Not my sort of job, alas,\" I told her. \"Extremes always turn my head. I am managing this coffee all right but I cannot see myself inviting the richest girl in the world to have a second cocktail or to do the Lambeth Walk with me.\"\n\nShe laughed light-heartedly. Her chaperon, a Lady Coningsby, arrived soon after and I was presented and took my leave. . . .\n\nAbout a week after that she sent for me again.\n\n\"I am doing a rash thing,\" she confessed. \"Father seems to have settled down into a groove. I am going down to the Riviera with Lady Coningsby for a week or two.\"\n\n\"I think you are very wise,\" I told her. \"You really ought to take your father with you.\"\n\n\"He would not move,\" she answered. \"He wants me to go, though. We are off to-morrow at eleven o'clock.\"\n\nI sent some flowers and once or twice I paused at the table where Mr. Jardine was seated to wish him good-morning. He took very little notice of me, however, and afterwards I left him alone. Then one day, glancing down the room, a sudden idea came to me. I rose from my place and approached the solitary luncher.\n\n\"What about a game of golf to-morrow, Mr. Jardine?\" I suggested.\n\nHe looked up at me and shook his head.\n\n\"Too damp for me,\" he said. \"I will play later on.\"\n\nI stood for a moment without moving and Mr. Jardine vanished behind his newspaper. I turned away with a little grimace of farewell and made my way between the tables where his bodyguard were spread out. A tough-looking crowd they were, though in civilized clothes. One or two were accompanied by young ladies of showy appearance and l noticed that not a single one seemed to be paying the least attention to the table which I had just quitted. I made my way into the hotel and straight to the private office of the managing director, Mr. Simpson. He looked at me in surprise.\n\n\"Sorry, sir,\" I apologized, \"my business is too urgent to wait for an interview.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Peter Jardine,\" I told him, \"has been kidnapped.\"\n\nMr. Simpson sprang to his feet. He was like a man demented. He pressed down a whole row of bells, he shouted through the telephone. Then he called out to me.\n\n\"It is impossible! I was in the Grill Room myself a few minutes ago. He was at his table then and I counted sixteen of his bodyguard lunching within a few yards of him.\"\n\n\"Within a few yards of his double,\" I answered scornfully. \"Heaven knows when it happened. The kidnapping might have taken place a fortnight ago, because I have scarcely spoken to him since. To-day there was something unusual in the way he was reading his newspaper, bending over the table. I went up to him and asked him to play golf with me. Not he! I bet that fellow never handled a golf club in his life. It is a remarkable likeness. He is wearing Jardine's clothes all right but he is no more Peter Jardine than I am. He no sooner saw that look in my face—a gleam of non-recognition, I suppose—than he got up and strolled out through the Grill Room door and not one of his famous bodyguard even turned their heads. He has just driven off in a taxi cab. I shouldn't bother about him. What you want to find out is—where is Peter Jardine?\"\n\nIt was true enough, as they all discovered in a few minutes. By early evening the papers were selling in thousands. The richest man in the world had been kidnapped from the Milan Hotel in the heart of London.\n\nIt was within hearing of the long drawn-out but musical welcome of a lone Mohammedan priest to the rising of the sun from a bank of rose-pink filmy clouds that I met Peter Jardine again. He was dressed in a white silk singlet, white trousers, white shoes and a toupee, and he had grown a beard which, considering it was only four months since he had left London, was a marvellous sight. He was seated on a beautiful white Arab pony, he had a golf club under his arm and a couple of golf balls in his hand. His welcome was not warm.\n\n\"What the hell brought you here?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Curiosity,\" I replied, \"and an offer of a million dollars reward from the Anglo-American Peter Jardine Trust, chairman Sir William Pollock, for any news whatever of Peter Jardine of Pittsburgh.\"\n\nHe grinned.\n\n\"Say, did that old Scotsman offer as much as that?\" he asked incredulously.\n\n\"He did indeed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he meditated, \"I suppose a million dollars is worth a risk, but what put you on the track?\"\n\nI slipped from the saddle and stretched myself. I had been riding since midnight by the light of the moon and countless stars across the ghostly desert and I needed a rest. Mr. Jardine laid his hand upon my shoulder and pointed to the oasis barely a mile distant, to the white buildings in the background and to the hill with its palm trees still farther behind.\n\n\"I have made a new club,\" he confided. \"We will talk about that later, though. You want some breakfast. You had better mount again.\"\n\nWe rode for a mile, my little caravan close in the rear, through the oasis into a far-stretching compound of dazzling white buildings.\n\n\"Behind on the hill is where I sleep at night. At the top you see my observatory with all sorts of telescopes. I watched you come an hour ago. We have guns of every calibre there. We could have blown your little lot to pieces ten miles away but at heart I am a man of peace. I mean to be left in peace.\"\n\nThere was something grim about the sound of those words but I only smiled. In the shadow of the oasis servants brought us canvas chairs, a table, ice pails, coffee and a vast variety of fruits.\n\n\"Will you have your bath first or breakfast?\" my host asked.\n\nThe night had been cool and the smell of coffee was heavenly.\n\n\"Breakfast,\" I decided.\n\nThere was the soft padded stir of a horse's hoofs on the sand, a sound which came from the other side of the oasis. With a little cloud of dust about her a woman in a long white flowing habit, riding side-saddle a beautiful Arab mare, a figure of complete grace and loveliness, galloped to within a few yards of us and sprang lightly to the ground. I scarcely recognized Stella but it was indeed she. She came laughing towards us with outstretched hands.\n\n\"I always said,\" she declared, \"that if anyone found us it would be you.\"\n\n\"It may be his good fortune,\" her father said idly, with already something of Oriental languor in his tone. \"It may not. There is no civilization here, Major Lyson, there is no Scotland Yard, no shadow of authority save the authority of the Sultan from whom I have bought my rights.\"\n\n\"Dad's a sheik or something,\" the girl explained, pointing to his white robe which a servant had wrapped around him.\n\nPeter Jardine was not in the least embarrassed.\n\n\"I have made for myself a place in a strange country,\" he said. \"It is a place of great power and where I dwell I rule. That is nothing. I have learnt one thing at any rate from the desert, and that is the true value of life and the inconsequence of death.\"\n\nAfter breakfast we moved into the shade of a palm tree whose huge waxy leaves were fluttering in the morning breeze. Here the heat was joyous but invigorating. We lay on low couches and smoked. I found myself revelling in the renewed joy of pure Turkish tobacco. The hours passed on. With an escort of armed servants in the floating white robes and with the dusky brown complexion of the Arab we wandered along the wide corridors and into the exquisitely beflowered places of an Oriental palace. We dipped our fingers into the cool waters of the oasis springs. All the strange perfumes of the desert seemed to be floating lazily on the still air. I bathed in the clear waters of a marvellous swimming pool. I replaced my soiled riding kit—we had been a fortnight en route from the banks of the Nile—with white riding clothes of the finest drill. Time passed in a sort of effortless ease. In due course we lunched off strange dishes which reminded me of the tales of the Arabian Nights. To talk of ordinary places outside this dreamy Paradise seemed impossible. One just drifted through the glamour of the day till the desert breeze stole up. The sun with its huge fiery rim passed behind the straight line of the horizon and everything sprang into life. There was the tinkling of musical instruments all around us, delicious cool drinks appeared, there was the sound of falling water as the miniature swimming pools one after the other were filled. Mr. Jardine sat up and talked.\n\n\"You will eat and drink when the lamps are lit, my friend Lyson,\" he said. \"You need no guide on your homeward trek for the Nile calls to everyone who knows the desert. Your head man has filled up with stores and you have water enough for many days. Your beasts we have changed for fresh ones.\"\n\nStella's soft voice complained through the violet stillness.\n\n\"Are you sending him away so soon?\"\n\n\"I must,\" her father answered. \"I have the right to dispose as I will of any intruder here and if I thought he was going back to publish my whereabouts in return for a million dollars he would never leave the shadow of our buildings. What do you say, Lyson?\"\n\nWe had spoken odd words during the day and I confirmed, them.\n\n\"Mr. Jardine is one of the few fortunate men in the world,\" I told Stella. \"He has found a new mode of existence whilst life is still in his veins. There is no fear that I shall disturb it. I left England in secrecy as to my real errand and I shall return after I have finished my journey to Khartoum where I have Government affairs.\"\n\nStella sighed.\n\n\"Y ou are going to leave me to marry one of these lordly young princes who come wooing from mysterious places?\" she asked.\n\nIt was Mr. Jardine who answered.\n\n\"My daughter is free to leave when she will,\" he said. \"I think she will probably stay until the next moon comes and passes but I know that when she goes back to what you call life but I find torture there will be a seal upon her lips as there will be upon yours. It will be a seal of honour . Words are of no value.\"\n\nWe dined off more strange foods, the flesh of many birds, and we drank light yellow wine slightly perfumed in flavour like a Moselle might be from the odour of the grape. I cannot remember that during the whole of the meal or my few remaining hours in the desert Peter Jardine asked me a single question concerning the life he had left. Once and once only I alluded to it and his shiver seemed like the real emotional thrill of horror of a man who was being tortured.\n\nAt ten o'clock we left for our night ride. Mr. Jardine and his daughter accompanied me for the first mile. The former reined in his horse at the top of the sandy ridge which formed the outside line of his marvellously protected home. He leaned over and thrust a piece of paper into my hand.\n\n\"In a strange sort of way,\" he said, \"it is relief to me to know that there is one human being in whom I have faith who knows of my whereabouts. If you feel any kindliness towards me, Lyson, never let me be disturbed. I have lived a dreary life in the crowded places. I have passed into an existence concerning which I have nothing to say which would not sound like sacrilege.\"\n\nI believe, although I am not quite certain, that Peter Jardine and I shook hands. I know that after his departure I lifted Stella's fingers, ghostly white in the moonlight, to my lips.\n\n\"So my knight came and rode away,\" she murmured. \"He had the heart and the courage to leave the captive maiden behind.\"\n\n\"I have become one of your father's disciples,\" I confided. \"I find words useless things.\"\n\nIn the soft radiance of the moonlight she was amazingly beautiful although all the time a little gleam of mockery was in her eyes. I leaned down from the saddle. It seemed to me that something of the mystery of the East was in those soft but glowing eyes, in the fullness of her lips. Behind me as I rode away a few moments later I left a little trail of torn paper. Only once I turned round. Stella was sitting on her white pony at the highest point of the sandy ridge, a marvellously beautiful study of serene immobility. From behind her came the haunting music of the night hymn of the priest drifting up to the star-strewn vault of heaven.\n\nMonths later, under a misty grey sky in the raw cold of a November morning, I was reminded of the last time I had played with a stranger over Woking Golf Links. The secretary came up to me as I entered the club house.\n\n\"Want a game, Lyson?\" he asked. \"Pollock's man has failed him. He's a steady twelve, a trifle slow through the green, perhaps, but he will give you a game.\"\n\n\"I'll play with him with pleasure,\" I replied.\n\nFrom the first tee to the last green we played sober golf and no word of any outside subject passed our lips. When we had finished he drew me into a corner of the bar.\n\n\"Lyson,\" he said, \"you possess a gift everyone in my profession admires—the gift of reticence.\"\n\nI looked at him and waited.\n\n\"I respect that gift so much,\" he went on, \"that although you have not asked me a single question, if there is any particular, thing you want to know about the most extraordinary client I ever had in my life I will answer it.\"\n\n\"The double of Jardine,\" I said. \"How was that arranged?\"\n\n\"My client brought him from the States, where he had been trained to play the part he played for three weeks in London. When all was ready for my client's disappearance he took his place. All was well until you recognized him and went to the hotel manager. That was bound to come. The double went back to his own cubby hole but not one of my client's seventeen bodyguards ever found him. He is living on a farm somewhere in Connecticut, a very contented man.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\n\"You have no more to ask?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you something,\" Pollock concluded after a glance round the empty bar. \"Those torn strips of paper you left on the sands of the desert have materialized in this country. You may escape a gift from a living man but you cannot refuse a legacy which your discretion has earned. Let it remain there, Lyson. You have nothing more to say?\"\n\n\"I think,\" I remarked, \"that a November morning as raw as this might justify another cocktail before lunch.\"\n\nSir William rang the bell.\n\nIII. — THE CALAIS GUN\n\nI FANCY that I must have appeared blankly astonished. There was a queer smile upon the Sub-Commissioner's lips and a puzzled expression in his eyes.\n\n\"Do you mind repeating that, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he assented. \"I was simply expressing my surprise that in your report you should have omitted to add all mention of your act of gallantry towards a lady who is upon our Continental Suspect List, and I should imagine upon yours.\"\n\nI sat up and began to take a great deal of notice. \"You don't mean the lady whose bag I picked up from the floor at luncheon time?\"\n\n\"No other,\" was the terse rejoinder.\n\n\"Who was she?\"\n\nThe Sub-Commissioner looked at me steadily for a moment; then he shrugged his shoulders. We were engaged in one of our weekly conferences in his office at Scotland Yard.\n\n\"Not to know that, Major,\" he said pleasantly enough, but with a faint note of reproof in his tone, \"is to earn the first black mark I have ever had occasion to put against your name.\"\n\n\"For a moment,\" I reflected, \"she reminded me of someone or of a photograph I had seen. It was not striking enough to make a deep impression. She dropped her bag passing my table and I helped to pick up a queer collection of expensive oddments. She was curiously upset, now that I come to think of it.\"\n\n\"Shall I help your memory?\" my vis-à-vis asked. \"I wish you would,\" I answered. \"Louis didn't know her or he would have mentioned her to me.\"\n\n\"She figures on your list, as well as mine, as Yvonne Blount.\"\n\nI was a little incredulous but not greatly interested.\n\n\"She is on my list,\" I admitted, \"photograph and all complete, but Yvonne Blount is hopelessly out of date. This woman had most attractive grey hair, was as slim as one of Madame Renouf's mannequins and whereas Yvonne Blount dealt freely in cosmetics, the lady who stumbled against my table appeared to be innocent even of lip salve.\"\n\nThe Sub-Commissioner smiled.\n\n\"Capital,\" he said. \"Your memory is vindicated.\n\nThe only thing you seem to have ignored is the coiffeur's art and the prevalence of these slimming academies in Paris as well as London. The woman was Yvonne Blount.\"\n\n\"That accounts, I suppose, for Brunton being in the Grill Room,\" I reflected.\n\n\"Precisely. We are keeping an eye upon the lady ourselves but she is more in your line than ours.\"\n\n\"I wonder the department didn't let me know,\" I remarked.\n\n\"I can set your mind at rest even about that mild speculation,\" Colonel Heywood observed. \"Tuesday is the day you don't lunch in the Grill Room of the Milan. You wander off somewhere to play golf. You will find that Brunton rang up but left no name, and by the way if you had known the owner of that bag, the contents of which were scattered at your feet, you would have examined them a little more closely, I expect.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you one extraordinary thing about this affair, sir,\" I confided. \"This morning I did what I don't do once in a dozen times. I came into the Milan Grill Room late and ravenous. I didn't change my clothes and I didn't have my usual shower, because I was not even warm.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"When I got to my room after the little incident we have been speaking of I kicked off my shoes and I found on the sole of one of them a queer little keep-sake from the lady. I thought it worth preserving, even though I never put her down as being of any particular interest.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" the Sub-Commissioner asked curiously.\n\nI opened my pocketbook and drew out what was certainly a rather peculiar object—a visiting card of some gelatinous substance with the letters ACMX in the right-hand corner. Underneath the letters was an utterly illegible signature.\n\n\"Where did you say you found this card?\" Heywood demanded.\n\n\"My rubber-soled shoes must have been damper than I thought,\" I explained, \"and I suppose I put all my weight on my foot stooping down, and this card must have adhered to the sole.\"\n\nColonel Heywood took it between his fingers, held it gingerly by the edges and studied it for a moment in silence. Then he laid it down upon the table.\n\n\"I have always contended,\" he said impressively, \"that whereas in your various adventures you and Louis have met with a great many undoubted successes, you are also the two luckiest men who ever dabbled in our profession.\"\n\n\"Luckiest?\"\n\n\"Precisely. You had not tumbled to the fact that a very dangerous young woman was seated in your immediate neighbourhood, you were not watching her, yet she must drop her bag at your feet and allow you, without the slightest effort or knowledge of what you were doing, to walk away with the one thing all your department and all Scotland Yard would have been looking for if they had known that it was missing.\"\n\n\"That card?\" I asked.\n\n\"That card,\" the Sub-Commissioner repeated a little irritably. \"What did you think it was?\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth,\" I answered, \"I thought it was the somewhat flamboyant attempt to impress her personality and whereabouts adopted by a lady of easy virtue. It made me think of the last time I was in Montmartre when a jet-black lady from Harlem offered me a black visiting card inscribed with red characters.\"\n\nColonel Heywood looked at me for a moment a little sadly, placed the card in an envelope, sealed it and thrust it into the inner pocket of his coat. He rose to his feet.\n\n\"You will have to follow this up, Lyson,\" he said. \"I'Il see you later in the day.\"\n\n\"And meanwhile?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am off to our cipher department,\" he explained.\n\n\"Are we really on to anything?\" I queried curiously.\n\n\"Maybe,\" was the evasive reply.\n\n\"Nothing I could do, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Well, you might call in at M3B2. You know Hubblethorpe, don't you?\"\n\nI nodded. Everyone who was doing our sort of job just then knew Hubblethorpe.\n\n\"Just ask him what time the four-fifteen train to Camberley goes.\"\n\n\"And when I have received that amazing piece of information?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it won't do you much good so long as you don't present the card,\" he admitted, \"but we will talk it over later in the day. Out you go, Major!\"\n\nOut I went—a man thoroughly confused, if ever there was one.\n\nFrom three to five, Louis, manager of the Milan Grill Room, friend of statesmen, cinema magnates, artists and millionaires, sported his oak.* It was very seldom that even I, his partner in many queer enterprises, ventured to disturb him. This afternoon, however, was an exception. He was reading a volume of French memories with a cup of strong tea by his side and smoking a cigar. He put down the book and waved me to a chair.\n\n\"Louis,\" I said, \"why did you give that lady who dropped her bag opposite me the window a seat at a table for one in Gregory's corner?\"\n\n\"Because she asked for that particular table and because I knew Gregory was in Paris,\" Louis answered.\n\n\"Had you no idea who she was?\"\n\nLouis withdrew the cigar from his mouth, knocked off the ash reluctantly and shook his head.\n\n\"It would intrigue me to know, Major,\" he confided. \"I have a medley of memories concerning her. Nothing definite. I allowed her to have that table because I could watch her.\"\n\n\"You remember Yvonne Blount?\"\n\nLouis replaced his cigar between his teeth and smoked thoughtfully for a moment or two. I could tell by the way he was looking into the fire that he was remembering things.\n\n\"Yvonne Blount,\" he murmured. \"Chestnut-coloured hair, the figure of a Dido. I expect you are right, Charles Brunton was there just the other side of the pillar and he was watching her all the time. It is a wonderful transformation. What is she after, I wonder?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"We may hear later on in the day,\" I said. \"They have her marked down.\"\n\n\"Do you know that?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"The Sub was being a little sarcastic with me,\" I confided. \"I saved my bacon by the merest fluke.\"\n\n\"As how?\" Louis enquired.\n\nI told him the incident. There was a slight frown on his fine forehead when I had finished.\n\n\"Brunton,\" he said to himself. \"One of the most trusted men in the department, I should have thought.\"\n\n\"Have you any doubt about it?\" I asked.\n\nLouis glanced around the room. It was purely a mechanical impulse for the apartment was sound-proof and we were alone.\n\n\"I was wondering,\" he confessed, \"whether the card you speak of, in which the Sub-Commissioner was so interested, was enclosed in the envelope which Brunton sent to her.\"\n\n\"Brunton sent to her?\" I repeated incredulously. Louis nodded.\n\n\"Just before she rose to her feet and upset her bag,\" he confided, \"I saw Brunton call José, slip something into an envelope and indicate Gregory's table. José took her the envelope all right. Brunton got up and marched out without a glance in her direction. The card which he had sent her, however, she glanced at for a moment and slipped into her bag. Two minutes afterwards she stumbled against your table on her way out.\"\n\nI was thoughtful for a moment.\n\n\"We had better go slow with this, Louis,\" I said. \"Brunton has been in the service ever since he was wounded twenty-four years ago. He is the most trusted man in his department.\"\n\n\"The incident will perhaps lend itself to explanation,\" Louis observed. \"On the face of it it is strange. If they were friends he would have spoken to her, waved as he left, but we know they were not friends. He was there to watch her.\"\n\n\"The Sub told me that,\" I pointed out.\n\nThere was a knock at the door twice repeated.\n\nLouis nodded so I opened it. The hall porter stood there.\n\n\"Sorry if I have disturbed you, sir,\" he said, \"but there's a lady here who wishes to see you very particularly.\"\n\n\"Did she give her name?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, sir, but she lunched in the Grill Room somewhere near your table.\"\n\nI glanced back at Louis.\n\n\"You had better go and see what she wants,\" he suggested. \"We will have a few words together later on.\n\nI followed the porter out into the hall. The woman who was seated upon the cushioned seat rose to her feet at once. Directly she smiled I recognized her. It was Yvonne Blount without a doubt, her smile as delightful as in the old days and her eyes even more radiant.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she begged, \"but you are the gentleman who helped me with my bag at luncheon time.\"\n\n\"That is so.\"\n\n\"May I speak to you for a moment quite privately?\"\n\n\"You would like to come to my room?\" I proposed. \"I have an apartment here.\"\n\n\"If you would be so kind,\" she begged.\n\nWe entered the lift and mounted in silence. We made our way along the corridor, I opened the door of my rooms, closed it again and offered her my most comfortable chair.\n\n\"What can I do for you, Madam?\" I asked.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" she answered. \"Please do not treat this too lightly. It is for me an important affair. You were very kind in picking up the trifles that fell from my bag as I was passing your table after lunch. There is one slight article which is missing. I have been back to my own table and to the one at which you were seated. The waiters there seem so confident. Nothing else has been found. Yet there is something missing. It seems unimportant but it means a great deal to me.\"\n\n\"But what is it?\" I enquired. \"As far as I remember there was loose money, cigarettes, a most elegant little powder box and a ruby brooch with a broken clasp. I can think of nothing else that I myself collected.\"\n\n\"It is a card,\" she told me, \"a strange-looking card of white ivory. It had some letters upon it and an initialled signature.\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"You have it not?\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"I certainly have not,\" I assured her. \"Nor do I remember seeing it amongst the other articles.\"\n\nShe looked at me steadily for several moments. I think that I must have sounded convincing.\n\n\"Then where can that card be?\" she demanded. \"Only a minute or two before I had taken it from an envelope and placed it in my bag. It has disappeared.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, Madam,\" I said, \"but I can see no way in which I can possibly be of assistance to you. Was the card of any particular value?\"\n\nShe made me no answer. From that moment, however, I believe that she ceased to trust me.\n\n\"You are Major Lyson?\" she asked abruptly.\n\n\"That is my name.\"\n\n\"You are in the British Intelligence Department?\"\n\n\"At one time I was,\" I admitted. \"At present I am practically retired.\"\n\nThen I knew for certain that she suspected me.\n\nShe had the look upon her face of one who listens to statements in which she has no credence.\n\n\"I must trust you,\" she said. \"I have no other alternative. It is my only hope. You have been, or are, connected with the British Intelligence. I have been in the French service all my life, Major Lyson. I served them during the war. I served them with perfect fidelity and a certain amount of success.\"\n\n\"It is a well-known fact, Madam,\" I ventured. \"Your decoration was a well-earned distinction.\"\n\n\"My mission over here is not an official one,\" she insisted firmly.\n\nI made no remark. She watched me as though to see what effect her statement had had.\n\n\"There are many sources of information,\" she continued presently, \"still open to me here. Through one of them I heard not long ago a curious rumour. It was to test the truth of it that I came back to my old profession. I came back on behalf of France but unknown to the authorities. I came to try and find out, if I could, the secret of what is known privately by only a few people and spoken of with bated breath—the Calais Gun.\"\n\nI smiled and played my first card.\n\n\"I think I know to what you refer, Madam,\" I said, \"but curiously enough I have never heard it called by that name.\"\n\nAgain she subjected me to that mercilessly searching gaze. I could tell from her look of disappointment that she learnt nothing.\n\n\"Well,\" she went on, \"I discovered that the fantastic tales which are reaching the French War Office have a basis of truth. There is such a thing as the Calais Gun.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" I begged, \"do not, if you please, allude to it by that name. The authorities whom I serve over here have vigorously protested against its use.\"\n\nShe smiled slightly.\n\n\"I can understand that. England and France are firm allies. It would certainly be disconcerting to our people to discover that England had worked out a great invention and that the machine connected with it had become known as the Calais Gun.\"\n\n\"There is no sense in the name,\" I repeated.\n\n\"There is considerable sense in it,\" she persisted. \"Calais is distant from the Fort of Dover precisely twenty-two miles. This gun has been prepared to do its marvellous work at precisely that range.\"\n\n\"I cannot discuss this matter with you, Madam,\" I regretted. \"I was in the army but I was not a gunner—I was in a cavalry regiment—and I can only repeat that if such an invention as you describe has been made over here there is no earthly reason why it should have been called the Calais Gun.\"\n\n\"We will pass that,\" she said. \"The first serious trial of the machine in question is to be made in the north of Scotland next Sunday. A mere handful of people have been invited to witness it. No French artillery officer has been bidden to join the company.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that, Madam?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"Is it the custom,\" I asked, \"when your country is making experiments with an entirely new invention to invite representatives, even of your allies, to witness them?\"\n\n\"This is something unusual,\" she proceeded doggedly, \"and there remains the fact that the gun has been christened 'The Calais Gun' and its range is precisely twenty-two miles.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" I said, \"you must excuse me but you are wasting your time. The only possible service I could have rendered you I have already offered. I have assured you that the gun has not been christened 'The Calais Gun' and if some misguided individuals have alluded to it in that way it is simply because it must have a name of some sort and the distance happens to coincide.\"\n\n\"With the utmost difficulty,\" she went on, rather as though she had not heard me, \"I procured a card which would have permitted me to witness the trial. It is the card I dropped before your table.\"\n\n\"A woman,\" I told her, \"would never be permitted to witness the trial.\"\n\n\"It is not a woman who would have attempted such a thing,\" she replied. \"It would have been a French artillery officer.\"\n\n\"If France so much wished to have witnessed the trial,\" I said, \"why did she not apply to the British War Office for a permit?\"\n\n\"It would have been beneath her dignity.\"\n\n\"Yet she would have made use of a permission gained—pardon me, Madam—by underground methods. That does not seem to me the likely reaction of the French military staff.\"\n\nThis time Yvonne Blount was angry and took no pains to hide it.\n\n\"We are playing with words,\" she declared. \"I have been very straightforward with you. I have told you the importance of that card. I beg of you to return it to me.\"\n\n\"There is nothing more certain in the world,\" I replied, \"than the fact that I do not possess it.\"\n\n\"You have parted with it already?\"\n\n\"I do not possess it,\" I repeated.\n\n\"That means that the source from which I obtained it will be discovered and the donor of the card—\"\n\n\"Will get what he deserves,\" I interrupted coldly. \"I have to repeat once more, Madam, that you are wasting time. Can you expect me to sympathize with a person who without authority has parted with a permit of such importance to witness the trial of what may turn out to be the greatest inven tion of the century? I am a British official myself. I should regard the action of any Englishman who obtained and passed on to you that card as traitorous.\"\n\n\"You have no pity, no sympathy,\" she murmured.\n\n\"In a case like this, none whatever, Madam,\" I replied.\n\n\"My appeal to you is in vain?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nShe rose to her feet. Her ungloved hands agleam with jewels hung limply by her side. Her eyes sought mine urgently. Although we were so entirely alone her voice became a whisper.\n\n\"I have not ventured,\" she began, \"to tell you what that card would be worth to me.\"\n\n\"The only tolerable part of your attitude in this matter, Madam,\" I rejoined, \"has been that you have refrained from insulting me.\"\n\nShe made her way towards the door. I passed her and held it open.\n\n\"You intend to use my card yourself, perhaps, Major Lyson?\"\n\nI made no reply. I only held the door a little farther open.\n\n\"If I have ruined a friend,\" she said, \"I shall have paid a terrible price. Do not be too sure, however, that the price will have been paid in vain. Do not be too sure that this is the last you will see of me. My room number is sixty-three.\"\n\nI was not to be provoked into questions. She lingered for a moment and then left me.\n\nThere was nothing more to be done for the moment but make a further visit to the Sub-Commissioner. To my surprise I found already in conference with him a very great person indeed, General Fitzhaven—the head of the department in which I held a sort of roving commission. I paused upon the threshold but Heywood summoned me to take the vacant chair at his desk. I saluted the General and did as I was bidden.\n\n\"I have just been telling the General the story of the card that stuck to the rubber sole of your golf shoe,\" the Sub-Commissioner remarked with a twinkle in his eyes. \"Have you had any trouble with Madam?\"\n\n\"I have just left her, sir,\" I told him. \"She is very angry. She believes I have the card and will not give it to her.\"\n\n\"You can make your peace with the lady, then,\" Colonel Heywood said, withdrawing the envelope in which he had placed the ticket from his pocket and handing it over to me. \"There it is. The bearer has to report to General Hubblethorpe and ask him at what time the four-fifteen for Camberley leaves. Stupid sort of password but the answer will tell him how to arrive at the rendezvous. It is rather a long journey, by-the-by.\"\n\n\"I am to give this card to Yvonne Blount?\" I asked in surprise.\n\nThe Colonel nodded. \"That is our idea,\" he said.\n\n\"But what about General Hubblethorpe? Will he expect to have one of these tickets presented by a woman?\"\n\n\"The matter,\" Colonel Heywood replied, \"is unimportant. Just hand it to her. That is if you know where to find her.\"\n\n\"I know where to find her all right,\" I told him, \"because she is staying in the Milan and warned me that she might be coming back.\"\n\nColonel Heywood nodded gravely. \"Just so,\" he said.\n\nHe glanced towards the General who inclined his head in assent.\n\n\"It is quite all right, Major,\" the Sub-Commissioner assured me. \"We have come to the conclusion that the lady cannot do much harm. Good French woman and all that, you know. Did a lot of good work in the war and decorated several times. Furthermore, as you seem to have had a certain amount of trouble to put up with, Lyson,\" he added, \"we are going to send you a card for our little picnic party. I suppose you would like to come?\"\n\n\"Nothing on earth I should like more, sir,\" I confessed with a sigh of relief.\n\nI made my way back to the Milan Court and rang up the number which Yvonne Blount had given me. In less than five minutes she was in my room.\n\n\"You have changed your mind?\" she exclaimed eagerly.\n\n\"I am acting under orders,\" I told her. \"Here is the card.\"\n\n\"A miracle!\" she murmured, clutching the envelope I handed to her.\n\n\"If you will take my advice,\" I said, \"you will get into touch at once with the French artillery officer who will make use of the card. You can tell him exactly—\"\n\n\"I know all about that,\" she interrupted. \"But it is necessary that I get the card for myself. I know what to do. I go to General Hubblethorpe, I ask him a silly question, I get the particulars and pass them on to my friend. He is a General and a man of great distinction.\"\n\n\"They will welcome him at the War Office, I can assure you. Already the question of inviting a French artillery officer—\"\n\n\"No, no, no! The General does not wish to go to your War Office. He is being followed over here. Others besides France are interested. It is better as I say.\"\n\n\"I leave the matter entirely to you, Madam,\" I replied.\n\nShe rose from her place and smiled up at me as she held out her hand.\n\n\"I was not too rude, I hope, Major Lyson?\" she enquired timidly. \"I was in a terrible state when I feared that I had lost this pass. You will forgive me?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I answered. \"One has to go through vicissitudes sometimes for one's country's sake.\"\n\n\"You will perhaps meet my friend?\" she asked, and this time her eyes were seeking for mine eagerly.\n\n\"It may be,\" I admitted. \"I am not an artillery officer, however, so it is very unlikely that there will be a place for me.\"\n\nShe drew a little sigh. It might have been intended as a gesture of regret but to my mind it was very certainly a sigh of relief. I opened the door. She passed out. I sat down and began to wonder again what it was all about.\n\nFour days passed before I was to know. The smooth, even progress of a perfectly balanced northward bound train-deluxe in which I and a score or so of others were distributed was brought suddenly to a standstill. I woke up and looked out of the window. Dawn was breaking and we were somewhere in the midst of the Scotch hills. There were men outside on the permanent way talking together and through the early twilight a blaze of lights on the neighbouring hills. I leaned out of the window and spoke to one of the guards.\n\n\"Where are we?\" I asked. \"What town is that?\"\n\nHe came close up to the side of the carriage.\n\n\"We are not answering questions, sir, but I will tell you this: It's no town at all as you've ever heard of.\"\n\n\"Then what are the lights?\" I demanded.\n\nHe was suddenly deaf and moved off. I washed and put on some clothes. I was sharing a sleeping car with twelve other men but not one of them seemed to be awake. Soon we began to back, then we went forward again and after many jolts I discovered that we were moving along a single track. The train attendant came with some tea and I wiped the mist from the windows and looked out once more.\n\n\"My God!\" I exclaimed. \"What sort of place is this?\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"Looks queer, don't it, sir?\"\n\n\"It looks more like Hollywood than anything else I have ever seen.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"I suppose those people do build up them sort of towns, sir,\" he remarked.\n\nFor that was just what it was - a stucco-built town erected in the loneliest part of Scotland, up in the region where even the heather is stunted and hard and the grim rocks show themselves every few feet jutting out of the hillside. There, spread out to such a degree that looking to the right and to the left one could scarcely measure its extent, was the complete panorama of a town built around a genuine and magnificent ruin of one of the old fastnesses of the country, the tower of which still remained with walls many feet thick and almost intact. While I was staring at it in amazement an attendant came through ringing a bell.\n\n\"Will gentlemen all please descend,\" he announced. \"General Hubblethorpe desires everyone to meet him in ten minutes on the right-hand side of the permanent way.\"\n\nThere was a general scramble. We stood there in all sorts of attire, doing our best to defy the cold of the drifting mists. What seemed to be a conspiracy of silence reigned. No one spoke to anyone else. There were twenty-three human beings in the little crowd and, as it occurred to me afterwards, not a single strange face. Talking to General Hubblethorpe was the man who had been pointed out to me on the platform as the inventor. We were a compact little group but glancing farther afield as the light increased I could see that the rough country all around us was unexpectedly peopled. There were several hundreds of plainclothesmen of army or police type, some carrying heavy sticks and others rifles. They might have been beaters in some sort of a game expedition except that they as well as everyone else seemed out on far more serious business.\n\nGeneral Hubblethorpe held up his hand and spoke.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I have to introduce to you John Marston, the inventor, who will give you a demonstration of what this new instrument, as yet without a name, is capable of doing. The buildings you see are of course not particularly formidable but the centre one is of solid granite and the walls of that tower are built of the same material as the old castles a thousand years ago. He wants you to see the place and to take particular notice of the tower because it is to be the target of his experiment. As soon as you have formed a general idea of the lay-out you will please return to the train.\"\n\nWe made a more or less cursory examination of what was undoubtedly the very ingeniously laid out effigy of a small town. We wandered around for a short time, then the railwayman rang his bell and the General turned to us all.\n\n\"You will please now resume your seats in the train. This collection of buildings, some of which are flimsy, I admit, but one or two of which, as you may have observed, are of different structure, you will examine again during the course of the morning from a different point of view. We shall be starting off at once to a harbour. The name of this I shall not mention, and t"
