Here was\n\na pair in the grand theatre\n\ntradition.\n\nFor younger generations\n\nthey had the added attrac-\n\ntion of youth.\n\nIt is hard to estimate the\n\nvalue of such a partnership to\n\nboth its members.\n\nIn the past year she has\n\nbeen through the disillusion-\n\nment of watching her home\n\nsold, her marriage end in\n\ndivorce, and her husband\n\nmarry young English actress\n\nJoan Plowright.\n\niVeu? husband ?\n\nMeantime, her own name\n\nhas been linked romantically\n\n-there has even been talk of\n\na marriage-with actor John\n\nMerivale.\n\nBearded John Merivale,\n\nwhom Australians will see with\n\nthe Old Vic Company, is a\n\nson of actress Gladys Cooper.\n\nAs I travelled to Elstree\n\nStudios to see Vivien for the\n\nfirst time since all these events,\n\nI wondered how much they\n\nhad changed her.\n\nOnly once before had I\n\nmet her without Sir-Laurence.\n\nThat was in Nottingham for\n\nthe English premiere of\n\n\"Summer of the Seventeenth\n\nDoll.\"\n\nThen, though we talked all\n\nnight of her future plans, she\n\nnever once said \"I.\" It was\n\nalways \"We,\" or \"Larry and\n\nL\" It was the same when we\n\ntalked about a future Austra-\n\nlian tour. She made it clear\n\nthat Sir Laurence was terribly\n\nsorry to miss the Nottingham\n\npremiere, and that only his\n\nWest End run in \"The Enter-\n\ntainer\" kept him away.\n\n(It was in \"The Enter-\n\ntainer\" that he acted for the\n\nfirst time with Joan Plow\n\nright)\n\nSince then I have seen and\n\nmet them many times at mid-\n\nnight charity matinees in sev-\n\neral London theatres.\n\nThere were always excited\n\ncries of \"Here come Viv and\n\nLarry.\"\n\nBut it is \"Viv and Larry\"\n\nno more. It's just \"Viv\" now.\n\nAnd as I walked on to the set\n\nof \"The Roman Spring of\n\nMrs. Stone\" I was apprehen-\n\nsive of. what this would mean\n\nto a woman as truly feminine\n\nas Vivien Leigh.\n\nInstead of her former re-\n\nlaxed and friendly greeting\n\nnone Help\n\nV Sir Laurence and\n\nLady Olivier on his\n\n50th birthday, 1957.\n\nnone Help\n\n.

Vivien Leigh, who loves cats, holds Tabby at\n\nElstree Studios, where Vivien, bewigged and\n\nbejewelled, is making Tennessee Williams'' \"The\n\nRoman Spring of Mrs. Stone.\" Tabby also\n\nappears in the film.\n\nshe gave me a quick formal\n\nsmile. But she was working on\n\na long and difficult- scene and\n\nI felt, and hoped, she was just\n\npreoccupied.\n\nHer blond wig and beadÃ©d\n\nwhite sheath satin dress, which\n\nwas garnished with a wealth of\n\npearl earrings, necklaces, and\n\nbracelets, made her look a\n\nlittle older than when I had\n\nlast seen her.\n\nBut as soon as the shooting\n\nlights picked up the girlish\n\nsmoothness of her perfect skin,\n\nany impression of added years\n\ndisappeared.\n\nAnd as soon as shooting\n\nbegan the star quality was\n\nthere.\n\nOn the set she has her own\n\ncaravan, where she rests be-\n\ntween scenes.

You know\n\n. I've always wanted to go\n\nback. I love it all. The\n\ncountry, the people, the ani-\n\nmals.\"\n\nThen she was silent.\n\nIt took ten minutes of\n\nchatter before I learned that\n\nshe had been very attracted\n\nto Australian painting on her\n\nlast visit in 1948.\n\n\"I have several still. A\n\nBill Constable, a Drysdale,\n\nand a Bill Dobell landscape.\n\nSome are in store, of course.\n\nThey used to be in the coun-\n\ntry-not in the Eaton Square\n\nflat.\"\n\nFor a minute a shadow\n\ncrossed her face at the men-\n\ntion of her old home Nottley\n\nAbbey. Then with a determina-\n\ntion that brooked no argu-\n\nment she changed the subject.\n\nIt was a warning as clear as a\n\nred light. She would have\n\nno talk of the past.\n\nI asked Miss Leigh if she\n\nand Mr. Helpmann were keen\n\non introducing new names\n\non the Old Vic tour, as\n\nMary Home, Alan Webb, and\n\nJohn Merivale, the other fea-\n\nture players, were not well\n\nknown in Australia.\n\n. \"One just tries to get the\n\nbest company one can,\" she\n\nsaid. \"We may be playing to-\n\ngether for two years if we go\n\nto all the places we want to.\n\nNot everyone can plan to be\n\non tour for as long as that. We\n\nfeel we have an excellent\n\ncompany and are very happy\n\nwith it.\"\n\nThe tour\n\nAfter Australia the Old Vic\n\nwill go to Hongkong, Singa-\n\npore, Bangkok, then possibly\n\nback to New Zealand.\n\n\"Then we hope to fit in a\n\nseason in Paris, appear at the\n\nAthens Festival, and play both\n\nNorth and South America.\n\n\"Then we MUST go to\n\nMoscow. I long to go to Mos-\n\ncow. It sounds one of the\n\nmost exciting places in the\n\nworld to play.\"\n\nIt sounded a pretty exhaust-\n\ning couple of years.\n\n\"But I adore touring,\" she\n\nsaid. \"And I love work. And\n\nit will be a much easier trip\n\nthis time. We will have two\n\nweeks' holiday every three\n\nmonths.\"\n\n\"You had less last trip?\" I\n\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes.\" But Miss Leigh\n\nswitched the subject again.\n\nShe seemed to reiax only\n\nwhen the luncheon break was\n\ncalled. I had been warned\n\nthat she never lunched with\n\njournalists, so I prepared to\n\nmake myself scarce.\n\nTo my surprise she said,\n\n\"You will lunch with me,\n\nnone Help\n\n1939\n\n0 While Vivien Leigh is in Australia\n\nthis year starring for the Old Vic on\n\nthe stage, her most famous film, \"Gone\n\nivith the Wind\" will be revived on the\n\nscreen in Australia's cinemas.

On thc under-\n\nstanding you stop work as\n\nmuch as I do while we eat.\"\n\nI promised, and we chatted\n\nabout everything but vhe tour.\n\nBack on the set, her chauf-\n\nfeur and maid Trudi had ar-\n\nrived with a vast carpet-bag\n\nbulging with hand-wrapped\n\npresents which Miss' Leigh\n\nhad chosen herself for every\n\nindividual in the cast and\n\ncrew. It was a task, which\n\nmust have taken her hours.\n\nEvery parcel had its own hand-\n\nwritten note.\n\n\"This ii the greatest fun of\n\ndoing any show,\" she said.\n\nI learned afterwards that\n\nshe has been doing it ever since\n\nshe became a star.\n\nAnd Miss Leigh was a star\n\nat an, unusually young age.\n\nHow great a star all over\n\nthe world is epitomised by the\n\nfact that this month -she was\n\nflown to Atlanta, Georgia, to\n\nbe the guest of honor at a\n\ntraditional Southern Ball,\n\narranged to celebrate the re-\n\nissue of \"Gone with the Wind.\"\n\nIt is also the centenary of\n\nthe American Civil War.\n\nIt is 21 years since the film\n\n?was made, and it has been\n\nsuch a continuous success that\n\nthe studios are now giving it\n\nfresh premieres all over the\n\nworld to celebrate its coming\n\nof-agc.
