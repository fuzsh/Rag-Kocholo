Kierston Wareing who plays Joanne Williams is one of the only actors In this film who is known for being in other productions with some level of success, such as the channel 4 TV series Top Boy and the British film production Rise of the Footsolider. Michael Fassbender who plays Connor O’Reily is the only other actor who is quite well known for other performances in such productions as X-Men: First Class and Steven Spillbergs Band of Brothers. Casting\n\n4. The film Fish Tank is mainly aimed at audiences around the areas in which the film itself was shot (London and Essex). This film is clearly set in London and was also shot on location as the queen Elizabeth bridge can be seen in the background in one of the scenes, and the Tilbury Town railway station was used for one of the scenes. The Location of which the film was shot (Tilbury) is shown to be a large estate which looks quite run down and working class. British people would not be surprised by this as, however some foreign audiences may be surprised for example American audiences as stereotypically London is portrayed as a wealthy city, not a location for underdeveloped areas. Issues raised with national and local audiences\n\n5.
