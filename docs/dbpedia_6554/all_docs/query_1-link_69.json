        "text": "“A WORLD OF PURE IMAGINATION”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nWe all love Gene Wilder, right? His wide-eyed innocence and ability to reach a comic, near-hysterical emotional state (“My name is FRANKENSTEEN!!!”) were trademarks for this gentle, brilliant actor who graced a few classic pictures of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.\n\nRemembering Gene Wilder, a documentary directed by Ron Frank, written by Glenn Kirschbaum, and co-executive produced by Julie Nimoy (Leonard’s daughter, since Wilder and Nimoy were great friends), is now a Blu-ray release from Kino Lorber, but it’s also available on Netflix. The 92-minute picture is a touching, warm, and affectionate look at Wilder’s career, and it hits all the right buttons for a “Gene Wilder-101” crash course in who he is and what he did.\n\nAnd that’s about it.\n\nThe late actor is indeed all over documentary. He appears in many clips from television interviews, his films, and home movies, and his voice-over narrates a lot of it… and there are several talking heads who sing the man’s praises—Mel Brooks (especially), Alan Alda, Carol Kane, Mike Medavoy (Wilder’s manager), Wilder’s fourth wife, Karen Wilder (nee Webb), and several others.\n\nThe film takes us from Wilder’s beginnings, where he grew up as Jerome Silberman in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and decided to become an actor/comedian when his mother developed heart issues. Her doctor advised young Jerry to always attempt to make his mom laugh. He was bitten by the stage bug at an early age and pursued that career from the get-go. After some stage appearances, including a supporting role on Broadway in Mother Courage—which starred Anne Bancroft—he got his big break. Bancroft was married to Mel Brooks. Brooks was looking for an “innocent” and special actor to play Leo Bloom in a picture from an original screenplay Brooks had written entitled Springtime for Hitler. The title was eventually changed to The Producers. The movie got made and was released in 1967 to critical acclaim. Brooks got an Oscar for his script and Wilder was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Just prior to the release of The Producers, Wilder had done a small but very memorable part as a hilarious “hostage” in Bonnie and Clyde (also 1967).\n\nThen came the likes of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), which, although not a box office hit at the time, did a lot to raise Wilder’s stock in the industry (his signature song from the movie, “Pure Imagination,” is quite apt in describing the actor). It was working with Brooks again in 1974 on Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein (which Wilder co-wrote), that solidified the actor as a comic genius. To the end of his life, Wilder would cite Young Frankenstein as his favorite picture.\n\nWilder went on to write and sometimes direct movies—some successes and some not. His collaborations with Richard Pryor in the mid-70s was a high point (Silver Streak, 1976, for example). Wilder quietly gave up acting in the 1990s except for an occasional television or stage appearance, and in the 2000s concentrated on painting and writing stories, novels, and a memoir.\n\nWilder’s much publicized marriage to comedienne/actress Gilda Radner is highlighted, as well as its subsequent tragic ending. But the actor’s later romance and marriage to Karen Webb, a clinician for the New York League of the Hard of Hearing, provides the story with a somewhat happy ending until Wilder’s own battle with Alzheimer’s.\n\nYes, Remembering Gene Wilder is lovingly made, is sweet and funny and something his fans will certainly enjoy… but it feels as if there is a lot missing. There is no mention of Wilder’s first two wives, for example, and there is no critical analysis of the several movies Wilder made toward the end of his career that, well, bombed.\n\nNevertheless, the personality of Gene Wilder does indeed shine through in this journeyman documentary. Those eyes… those wonderful blue eyes that were so expressive dominate the movie in ways that will haunt the viewer long after seeing the picture.\n\nKino Lorber’s Blu-ray presents the film with optional English subtitles and 5.1 surround and 2.0 stereo sound options. Bonus features include extended interviews with Brooks, Kane, Karen Wilder, Harry Connick Jr., Burton Gilliam, Ben Mankiewicz, Peter Ostrum, and Alan Zweibel, plus the theatrical trailer.\n\nFor fans of Gene Wilder, of course, but also for Mel Brooks aficionados.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\n“THE ALTAR OF IGNORANCE”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nThe Pre-Code days of Hollywood (prior to July 1, 1934) sported numerous studio productions that raised eyebrows and caused consternation among the more Puritan segments of America’s population. This eventually led to the Hays Office overseeing Tinsel Town’s self-implemented Production Code that policed content in the motion picture business until the mid-1960s.\n\nBefore the Code—and after—there were also low-budget non-studio independent productions that went even further in exploiting (the key word here) sex, drugs, and violence under the guise of being “educational films.” They were often marketed guerilla style, as if the circus was coming to town, in which distributors would book a theater for a week, bombard the press with “adults only” advertisements, make a killing at the box office, and then move on to the next town. This scheme worked because, after all, prurient subject matter sells.\n\nThe Road to Ruin is one such exploitation film but it’s a bit different. In a way it’s a hybrid of the Hollywood B-movie and an independent production of dubious quality. In contrast to other pictures of its ilk, Road is a step above. There are aspects here that are admirable and worth a look, even if it’s a view backwards into a time and place that today is quaint, sensationalist, and laughable, which is why we enjoy these gems from the past. Therein lies the charm of these movies that have recently been restored and released on Blu-ray as a series called “Forbidden Fruit: The Golden Age of the Exploitation Picture,” from Kino Lorber Classics in association with Something Weird Video.\n\nThere are two versions of the film. First there was the 1928 silent production, directed by Norton S. Parker, written by Willis Kent, and starring a young, pretty blonde named Helen Foster, who had been working in numerous Hollywood silent pictures at the time and developed a name for herself through, at least, the 1930s. The Road to Ruin was a popular hit, so much so that a few years later, it was remade as a talkie in 1934, written and directed by “Mrs. Wallace Reid,” the credited name of Dorothy Davenport. Davenport had indeed been married to the actor Wallace Reid, who had died in 1923 from complications due to drug addiction. Interestingly, the 1934 talkie also stars Helen Foster in the same lead role of the innocent high school girl who becomes corrupted by (in this order) alcohol, drugs, and sex. In the 1928 silent version she is “Sally Canfield”; in the 1934 talkie she is “Ann Dixon.” Foster is quite believable as a 17-year-old in the silent picture… not so much in the talkie (she was 27 when that was made). Nevertheless, Foster’s performances in both versions are the main reason why both movies are notable. She is quite charismatic and not without talent.\n\nThe story in both movies is exactly the same (Davenport based the later screenplay on Willis Kent’s 1928 version). Sally/Ann is friends with Eve, another high school teen who is wilder mainly because her divorcing parents are wealthy and are too busy throwing parties and serving illegal booze (it was the Prohibition era at the time). Sally/Ann and Eve go out with some schoolboys who introduce Sally/Ann to alcohol… and one thing leads to another. Then, one night, dashing older man Don/Ralph spots Sally/Ann in a club and makes his move. Sally/Ann begins seeing him, and of course Don/Ralph offers the drugs and gets her pregnant. The sordid tale then goes into the dangers of unlawful abortion and the catastrophic results. As the tagline of the 1934 picture reads, it’s a movie about “modern youth burned at the altar of ignorance.”\n\nThe movies were meant to be cautionary tales to parents, imploring them to instruct their children in sex education and the ways of the world. Never mind that there are scenes of strip poker in the silent movie and strip dice in the talkie. It’s educational! That said, as opposed to other exploitation movies of the time such as Narcotic (1933) or Marihuana (1936), there is a tonal sincerity of intent by the filmmakers. They likely truly believed that The Road to Ruin, both versions, were not exploitation movies. This is why they might be viewed as a cut above others of the genre.\n\nThe new Kino Blu-ray presents a 4K restoration of the 1934 version and it looks quite good. It comes with an audio commentary by Eric Shaefer, author of Bold! Daring! Shocking! True!: A History of Exploitation Films. The 1928 version does not have the 4K restoration but it still looks marvelous for its age, and it comes with an audio commentary by film historian Anthony Slide and a new musical score by Andrew Earle Simpson.\n\nThe Road to Ruin is for fans of Hollywood history, Pre-Code sensibilities, exploitation films, and the time capsule aspects of American family life in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Art-house pictures, really. He seemed to have taken his cue from the likes of Ingmar Bergman, certainly, but also Federico Fellini and others. To this reviewer, though, Allen’s movies, be they comedies or dramas from Annie Hall (1977) onwards, almost always deal with the fragility of flawed human relationships—the same kinds of pictures made by French director François Truffaut. Truffaut’s films are full of extramarital affairs, love gone wrong, and sometimes the murder of someone who has gotten in the way of a central character’s goals.\n\nNow, Allen’s 50th motion picture, Coup de chance (“Stroke of Luck”), shot in France with a French crew and cast, and with dialogue entirely in French (with English subtitles), demonstrates that the director really has become Truffaut and made his own little European art-house picture like The Soft Skin or The Woman Next Door (two of Truffaut’s dramas). Or is it just another Crimes and Misdemeanors or Match Point or Irrational Man, to name some of Allen’s own dramas that deal with the same subject matter?\n\nEven though much of the new film is very familiar Woody Allen territory, Coup de chance is undoubtedly his most engaging piece since, say, Blue Jasmine. Is it as good? Not really. And it doesn’t touch Match Point, which is easily one of the director’s greatest thrillers, which Coup de chance attempts to be.\n\nFanny (the radiant Lou de Laâge) is married to wealthy Jean (the handsome but appropriately cold Melvil Poupaud). They live in Paris and enjoy an upper-class, privileged life due to Jean’s work as some kind of financier (“He makes rich people richer,” Fanny explains). Fanny works at an auction gallery but is somewhat bored by the couple’s high society social life and especially by Jean’s continual insistence of going to the country to hunt game with his friends. Every so often, Fanny’s mother, the wise but somewhat fussy Camille (Valérie Lemercier), comes to visit for a few days. Camille gets along well with Jean and even enjoys going hunting in the country with him and his pack while Fanny stays at the cottage with a book to read. One day on a city street during her lunch break, Fanny, by happenstance, runs into a former high school acquaintance, Alain (Niels Schneider). Alain, a divorced writer, immediately gushes how he had a crush on her back then and would enjoy taking her to lunch. Fanny agrees. And then she agrees again. Before long, Fanny and Alain are having an affair. Jean, however, is the jealous type. Extremely so.\n\nTo reveal more would spoil the rest of the story, but most viewers of Woody Allen’s films can likely predict how it’s going to go. There is an unusual twist in the third act… and indeed there is a “stroke of luck” that occurs which emphasizes the film’s themes of coincidence, luck, and fate and how these concepts can be intertwined. These were common ideas that Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski imbued in his pictures, too.\n\nAllen’s direction here is top form and he is aided by the editing of Alisa Lepselter. The film moves at a rapid pace with brief vignette-like scenes. The actors are all superb, despite working with roles that unfortunately do not have much depth in such a picture of brevity and briskness. The photography by veteran Vittorio Storaro is gorgeous, and the imagery makes one want to plan an immediate trip to visit Paris.\n\nThe problems are that we’ve been down this road too many times with Woody Allen. Yes, there are a few differences in the structure and storytelling, but the familiarity still nags at the viewer. The novelty of an Allen picture being entirely in French and in Paris does distinguish it from the others… but then there’s the issue of whether or not American audiences will relate to these upper-class French people or care about them at all. (One might have the same argument about Allen’s portrayal of upper-class New Yorkers in previous movies!) Another issue is the overuse of upbeat, lively jazz music (mostly Herbie Hancock’s “Canteloupe Island”), which in some scenes feels highly inappropriate for a thriller, and ultimately becomes tiresome.\n\nThat said, there’s no question that Coup de chance is an improvement over the last few Woody Allen titles, but it likely will not be included among the fifteen to twenty of the filmmaker’s most respected works. But when there are fifty titles from which to choose, landing somewhere in the middle isn’t bad.\n\nWill there be future pictures from Allen, who at the time of writing is 88 years old? Who knows… but if he goes out with Coup de chance then it will be considered an admirable effort.\n\n(The film opens Friday in U.S. theaters.)\n\n“WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BUT OUR FUTURES”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nA genius has to start somewhere.\n\nA very young Stanley Kubrick made his first feature film, Fear and Desire (called The Shape of Fear during production and until it found a distributor), at the age of twenty-two. It was very much a DIY production. In many ways it is the epitome of early independent filmmaking, the kind in which a fellow with a camera goes out to make a movie and then worries about finding a studio to release it. The picture was financed by family and friends, written by a school pal (future Broadway playwright Howard Sackler), and cast with young, struggling New York actors who were willing to work for peanuts. Kubrick produced and directed the movie, but he also photographed and edited it himself, too. It took a year-and-a-half to finish, and then he went about marketing it himself.\n\nThe astonishing thing about all this is that Kubrick was operating on chutzpah. While he had already made two documentary shorts, he was simply “winging it” when it came to making a feature length fiction narrative film. What he had on his side was his cinematographic capabilities. He knew cameras, lighting, and composition like the back of his hand, for he had spent four years after high school working as the youngest staff photographer for Look magazine in New York creating narrative “photo essays,” almost the equivalent of storyboards. Editing a movie, directing actors, and telling a good story was another matter… and something he would eventually learn how to do. Unfortunately, while Fear and Desire looks gorgeous and is indeed a lesson in photographic composition and lighting, it fails on all the other aspects of movie making.\n\nKubrick himself disowned Fear and Desire not long after its release in 1953. In fact, he attempted to acquire all existing prints, including the negative, and burn them. Luckily for film historians and Kubrick aficionados, he was unsuccessful. The copyright in the movie was owned by Kubrick’s uncle, Martin Perveler, a fairly wealthy pharmacy owner in California who put up most of the money and received Associate Producer credit. The feature had disappeared for decades and was sometimes available on poor quality bootleg VHS tapes and DVDs. It was only since Kubrick’s death in 1999 that today’s copyright owners and the Library of Congress made the movie available. In the USA, Kino Lorber distributed excellent quality DVD and Blu-ray editions several years ago. Now, Kino has released new 4K UHD and Blu-ray versions of the film, including the original 70-minute premiere cut that hasn’t been seen since 1953. (After its premiere, Kubrick cut about nine minutes for the theatrical release, limited as that was. It was this 62-minute cut that has been the more familiar one to film buffs.)\n\nAnother remarkable aspect about Fear and Desire is how ambitious it was. Kubrick’s later, more mature works are often extremely existential in theme and tone—they are big budget art films that challenge audiences to actually think about what they’ve seen. Kubrick is big on ambiguity, symbolism, and metaphor in all of his later, more well-known features. Right out of the gate, Kubrick embarked to make an extremely non-commercial art film that deals with the meaning of existence and the futility of war. While he would later succeed with this kind of art house contemplative head scratcher, Fear and Desire unfortunately comes off amateurish, pretentious, and painfully like a student film.\n\nThat said, one who knows Kubrick’s work can see glimpses of the genius underneath this early effort. What he was attempting is quite “Kubrickian,” and there are moments and images that are indeed striking.\n\nThe story is thus… A four-man platoon are fighting an unnamed war in an unnamed country. They are lost in a forest behind enemy lines. The goal is to get back to their side. When enemy combatants are spotted in a structure, the men decide to strike one for the team and kill off the opposition. Weirdly, the enemy general and his sidekick look just like the platoon’s lieutenant and private (they’re played by the same actors). Whoa, profound! And, in typical Kubrickian fashion, one man, another private (played by young Paul Mazursky, who would go on to be a director of note himself) goes mad, nearly rapes a civilian (Virginia Leith), and runs off like a banshee from hell. Will the others make it back to “civilization?” Maybe. Maybe not. As the lieutenant says, “We have nothing to lose but our futures.”\n\nThe same could be applied to Stanley Kubrick’s first endeavor.\n\nBesides Mazursky and Leith, the other actors are Frank Silvera as the sergeant (if anyone is the protagonist here, it’s him), Kenneth Harp as the lieutenant, and Steve Coit as the first private. Silvera would go on to play the villain in Kubrick’s next, also independently made, feature, Killer’s Kiss (1955). Kubrick’s first wife, Toba, has a cameo as a fisherwoman (she and Kubrick had been high school sweethearts). Toba also worked on the crew, but the stress of making a first film with Stanley Kubrick destroyed their already unstable marriage.\n\nKubrick had flown the cast and tiny crew from New York to California in the spring of 1951 and shot the film in the San Gabriel mountains. It then took him over a year to raise the money to do all the post-production (mostly post-sync sound). He submitted the 70-minute cut to the Venice Film Festival in August 1952, where an unofficial premiere took place (he wasn’t present). Only in late 1952 did Kubrick meet the international film distributor Joseph Burstyn, perhaps the important figure of art house cinema in America at that time. Burstyn agreed to release the movie, and it had its official premiere in March 1953. It received mostly negative reviews, which prompted the director to delete nine minutes to tighten the feature. There were, however, a handful of very positive notices from the likes of critics such as James Agee and Mark Van Doren, both of whom recognized that there was undeniable talent buried within this strange, unsettling movie.\n\nKino Lorber’s new 2-disk release of the 4K restoration comes with a UHD disk and a Blu-ray disk of both the 70-minute and 62-minute cuts. The longer cut is accompanied by an audio commentary by film historian Eddy Von Mueller. The shorter cut has an audio commentary by film historian/screenwriter Gary Gerani. Von Mueller’s commentary is quite informative about the tortured history of the film; however he makes several odd mistakes (he says the fisherwoman is Kubrick’s sister, not wife; he says the star of Barry Lyndon is “Patrick” O’Neal; and 2001: a Space Odyssey is from 1966, not 1968). Gerani’s commentary covers much of the same ground with a different perspective. Sadly, neither pinpoints the bits that were actually cut from the longer version of the film. It’s up to us to figure it out (this reviewer finds that some scenes in the first half of the movie were merely shortened… there are no full scenes missing in the theatrical cut).\n\nThe real treasure trove in this release is that for the first time, in the USA, that is, we get Kubrick’s early short documentaries in high definition. Day of the Fight (1951) and Flying Padre (1951) were only available as bootlegs in bad quality. Only The Seafarers (1953) had been released on home video prior. Now we have all of Kubrick’s early work on one gorgeous release.\n\nKino’s new Fear and Desire package is a must-have for Stanley Kubrick fans, because looking past the feature’s shortcomings will reveal what would come from the master filmmaker. It’s a fascinating step back into the auteur’s young mind.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\n“WILFRID THE FOX”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nDirector Billy Wilder was on an incredible streak during the decade of the 1950s. Some of his most notable works were made between 1950-1959, and his 1957 courtroom drama, Witness for the Prosecution, is one of the high points.\n\nBased on the 1953 stage play by Agatha Christie (which, in turn, was based on one of her short stories), Wilder’s film version actually improves a bit on the already engaging theatrical work. (By the way, the stage play is currently enjoying a long and successful run in London at County Hall’s old courthouse and actual courtroom, and this reviewer can attest that it is a magnificent production, definitely worth seeing in those authentic environs.)\n\nTyrone Power received top billing as Leonard Vole, the accused (Power, an American, plays the role as one as well). The fabulous Marlene Dietrich is Christine, the “witness for the prosecution.” But make no mistake—this movie belongs to Charles Laughton, who received third billing. Laughton plays barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who is the senior counsel for Vole. As his private nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester) declares during the trial when Wilfrid makes a slam-dunk move, “Wilfrid the Fox! That’s what they call him, and that’s what he is!”\n\nThe nurse character is something that screenwriters Wilder and Harry Kurnitz (adapted for the screen by Larry Marcus) added to the story, as well as turning Sir Wilfrid’s character to be more of a protagonist. Seeing that Laughton and Lanchester were married in real life, their chemistry and constant bantering together is priceless, providing the film with comedic elements that the play never had.\n\nVole is accused of murdering a wealthy widow that he befriended. She had become besotted with him and made him a beneficiary of her will. Vole is married to German immigrant Christine, who at first provides an alibi for Vole. Sir Wilfrid, despite recovering from a heart attack and is not in the best shape for a highly publicized trial, takes the case of defending Vole. It’s a shock to Wilfrid when the prosecution calls Christine to testify against her husband—because she is actually married to someone else back in East Germany, dodging the law that a wife can’t testify against a spouse. To reveal any more of the twists and turns—and especially the surprise ending—would spoil the fun. (In fact, a voiceover announces at the end of the movie that the “management of this theater” suggests that the secret of the ending not be revealed to friends!)\n\nAll three of the leads are particularly outstanding, and they are strongly supported by not only Lanchester, but also John Williams, Henry Daniell, Torin Thatcher, Una O’Connor, and Ian Wolfe. Wilder’s direction is a lesson in pacing, the rise and fall of tempo and suspense, and his guidance of the actors. Dietrich, in fact, would not agree to do the picture unless Wilder was hired as director.\n\nThe film was popular in 1957. It received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Laughton), Best Supporting Actress (Lanchester), Best Editing, and Best Sound. Curiously, the screenplay wasn’t nominated. Lanchester did receive the Golden Globe award for her stellar performance.\n\nKino Lorber Studio Classics has issued a Special Edition Blu-ray that replaces their earlier 2014 release. The contents are exactly the same except an audio commentary by film historian Joseph McBride (author of Billy Wilder: Dancing on the Edge) has been added. Previous supplements included are a short piece of Wilder discussing the film with director Volker Schlöndorff, and the theatrical trailer. The restoration itself looks marvelous in glorious black and white.\n\nWitness for the Prosecution is a must-have for fans of Billy Wilder, Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Agatha Christie, and courtroom thrillers. Great fun all around.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\n(A previous 50th Anniversary edition of this film was released in 2018 by Kino Lorber and was reviewed on Cinema Retro in 2020. The film has been re-issued on Blu-ray as a “Special Edition” in 2024. Much of the following review is repeated, but updated, from the earlier piece.)\n\nThe late director Norman Jewison, who passed away on January 20, 2024, was on a roll in the late 1960s. After a handful of well-received small romantic comedies, he directed The Cincinnati Kid (1965) featuring Steve McQueen as a Depression-era poker player, followed by the Oscar Best Picture-nominated The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming (1966), and then the brilliant In the Heat of the Night (1967), which did win the Best Picture Oscar and landed Jewison a Director nomination.\n\nHis next project became a heist picture/romance, the story of which was pitched to him by Alan R. Trustman, a lawyer with no screenwriting experience. Jewison was intrigued, so, according to the excellent interview with the director that appears as a supplement on Kino Lorber’s new Blu-ray edition of The Thomas Crown Affair, he gave Trustman a crash course in how to write a movie script. When it was completed, Jewison got the film green-lit.\n\nWhen Jewison’s agent—who also represented Steve McQueen—read the screenplay, he suggested McQueen for the part. Even though the actor and director had gotten along on Cincinnati Kid, Jewison admits that he didn’t think McQueen was right for the role because the actor never wore suits. McQueen then met with the director—wearing a suit—and convinced him that he could be Thomas Crown.\n\nThe Thomas Crown Affair is a stylish, twisty-turny, clever piece of 1968 pizazz. It emphasizes the ultra-cool cosmopolitan and fancy lifestyle of the rich during the Mad Men era when it was actually happening. The flashy camerawork and then-innovative split-screen/multi-screen display of simultaneous action scenes was snappy and unique. The brilliant main title designer, the late Pablo Ferro, is credited for much of this work, and it is this visual technique that gives the movie its pulse.\n\nCrown is a former banker in Boston, a happily wealthy playboy-sportsman who decides to pull off a complicated bank heist simply because he can. He puts together a team of individuals (including getaway driver Jack Weston) who don’t know each other or him, and the gang meets only at the time of the robbery inside the bank. Crown himself isn’t there. The heist is successful, and the mastermind gets away with $2.6 million. Detective Malone (Paul Burke) is determined to catch whoever was responsible, but the crime was too well thought out. No evidence or clues were left behind. An insurance investigator, Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway, in her first role post-Bonnie and Clyde), is brought in and she immediately takes control of the operation, much to Malone’s chagrin. It doesn’t take long for Crown to come under Vicki’s suspicions—so she sets out to entrap him by, well, having an affair with him.\n\nThat’s the plot in a nutshell. While much of it is seemingly improbable, the story is told with conviction and such technical prowess that it’s hard not to go along for the ride. Jewison’s handling of the heist itself and the romantic sequences between the dual eye candy, McQueen and Dunaway, is masterful. Both actors are fine in their roles; McQueen especially continues to exude the 60s cool that was his trademark.\n\nKino Lorber’s brand new 4K restoration looks quite good, and it comes with two audio commentaries—one by Jewison himself, and the other by film historians Lem Dobbs and the late Nick Redman. Supplements include the previously mentioned interview with an aging Jewison, who was still sharp and talkative, an interview with title designer and split-screen maestro Ferro, and a vintage on-the-set featurette from 1967 with the cast and crew. The original theatrical trailer, along with other Kino Lorber releases, complete the disk.\n\nThe Thomas Crown Affair was remade by John McTiernan in 1999 with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. Was it better than the original? Maybe yes, maybe no. Only you can decide; but consider this—the 1968 version has Steve McQueen, a young Faye Dunaway, a variety of really hot and nifty sports cars, and an Oscar-winning title song, “The Windmills of Your Mind” (remember that?)! Recommended.\n\n“A MATTER OF MISCOMMUNICATION”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\n(A previous edition of this Blu-ray title from Kino Lorber was reviewed at Cinema Retro in 2020. This review covers a new edition released in 2024, repeating much of the previous writeup but with new material.)\n\nThe late Carl Reiner received top billing in this magnificent comedy that was released in the middle of the 1960s, when relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were tentative at best. Détente was at play, but there wasn’t much trust between the two countries. Two years after Kubrick’s Cold War black comedy, Dr. Strangelove, Norman Jewison tried his hand at a picture with a similar theme, only it was one that was much lighter in tone.\n\nReiner shares the movie with another acting master who recently left us. Alan Arkin made his feature film debut with his portrayal of a Russian submarine political officer. He and Reiner are joined by a marvelous supporting cast of character actors who all have comedic turns. Penned by Oscar-nominated William Rose (who had written or co-written The Ladykillers and It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, and would win the Oscar the following year for Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner), The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming focuses on the conflict between a group of misplaced Soviet submariners and the panicky townsfolk of a New England island off the coast of Massachusetts after the summer tourists have left. What it’s really about, though, is communication, or rather, the lack of it, and how a series of incidents that are lost in translation might lead to misunderstandings. Director Jewison delivers that message to the audience wrapped neatly in a barrel of laughs.\n\nReiner is Walt Whittaker, a playwright who has spent the summer on the island with his wife (Eva Marie Saint) and two children, and the family is ready to depart. His rented house on the coast happens to be near where the Russians’ submarine accidentally runs aground. The captain (Theodore Bikel) sends Lt. Rozanov (Arkin), officer Alexei Kolchin (John Phillip Law), and seven other men to go find a boat, commandeer it, and bring it back so they can tow the sub away from the island. Things begin promisingly, and then all hell breaks loose as one mishap after another foils the Russians’ scheme. Police Chief Mattocks (Brian Keith), his deputy Norman Jonas (Jonathan Winters), and, ultimately, war veteran and head of the citizens militia, Hawkins (Paul Ford), receive conflicting reports of the “invasion” and set about investigating it in their own misguided ways (although Mattocks is indeed the sensible one). Throw in a sudden romantic attraction between Alexei and the Whittaker’s babysitter, Alison (Andrea Dromm), the antics of phone operator Alice (the splendid Tessie O’Shea), and Luther, a drunk “Paul Revere” who spends the entire film trying to catch his horse (Ben Blue), and you’ve got a recipe for a comedy classic. The climax, however, is surprisingly suspenseful when the Russians and Americans finally reach a standoff at the harbor—until an unrelated crisis occurs that shakes everyone out of the mob mentality.\n\nThe straight man role was something Carl Reiner could do well; he always brought a heightened intensity to his parts that was simultaneously boisterous and believable, and yet amusing, too. Arkin, whose dialogue is 85% authentic Russian throughout the picture, immediately proved to the world what an amazing actor he is (he received an Oscar nomination for his performance and won a Golden Globe). Winters and Ford both provide much of the insane humor. O’Shea is hilarious, especially in the scene in which she and Reiner are gagged and tied together and attempt to escape. Law, a newcomer at the time, is a striking and likeable presence, and he masters the Russian language and the accented English with aplomb.\n\nIt’s all great stuff, punctuated by Johnny Mandel’s score of American patriotic music mixed with Russian folk songs. Along with Arkin’s nomination, The Russians are Coming… was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (Rose), and Best Editing (Hal Ashby was co-editor).\n\nKino Lorber’s high definition restoration looks good enough, despite some washing out of color in some places, as well as blemishes and artifacts that can be seen in many of the images. This new 2024 edition has added an audio commentary by film historians Michael Schlesinger and Mark Evanier, who complement the onscreen action with informed background. The earlier supplements of an informative and entertaining “making of” featurette with an interview with Jewison and the theatrical trailer remain on the disk.\n\nIn short, The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming is grand fun, and it’s a fitting showcase for the late, great Carl Reiner and Alan Arkin.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon.\n\n“A CAPER IN WHITE… AND BLACK”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nThe film noir movement/trend in Hollywood was fading away by the end of the 1950s decade. Orson Welles’ Touch of Evil (1958) is often cited by film historians and film noir aficionados as the “last true film noir.” However, one picture released in 1959 could very well take that honor, for it indeed exhibits many of the traits of pure film noir (black and white photography, gritty realism, cynical and edgy characters, a heist, and an ending that is, well, not a happy one).\n\nOdds Against Tomorrow was set up by actor and musician Harry Belafonte and was made by his production company. Is it the first film noir with a Black protagonist? This reviewer can’t think of another that preceded it. Basing it on a novel by William P. McGivern, Belafonte hired blacklisted Abraham Polonsky to write the screenplay. Polonsky (who had written the great Body and Soul, 1947) had been caught up in the HUAC investigations in Hollywood, refused to testify in the hearings, and was subsequently blacklisted along with many other writers, producers, directors, and actors. Polonsky, working with co-writer Nelson Gidding, wrote the script under a front-pseudonym, John O. Killens, a living Black novelist. It wasn’t until 1996 that the Writers Guild restored Polonsky’s real name to the credits.\n\nBelafonte apparently had wanted to make a movie that was not only a gripping heist drama but also a statement about prejudice. Of the trio of robbers who attempt a bank robbery in the film, one is Black (Belafonte), the other two are White, and one of the latter is terribly racist… a factor that plays into how the caper ultimately plays out.\n\nNew York City. Dave Burke (Ed Begley) is a disgraced former cop who needs money. Earl Slater (Robert Ryan) is an embittered, racist war veteran and ex-con who needs money. Johnny Ingram (Belafonte) is a musician in debt to a gangster because of a gambling addiction, so he needs money, too. Slater lives with needy Lorry (Shelley Winters, in one of her whiny roles) but he has the hots for apartment building neighbor Helen (Gloria Grahame). Johnny is separated from his wife, Ruth (Kim Hamilton) and daughter Edie, but he desperately wants to make good and reunite the family. When Dave learns about an upstate smalltown bank with a vulnerability, he enlists Earl and Johnny in a scheme to steal $150,000, split three ways. Johnny doesn’t want to do it, but the pressure from the mobster and threats to his family force him into it. Earl is not happy that a Black man is part of the plan, and this tension is a major conflict in the heist proceedings. To reveal more would spoil the excitement.\n\nRobert Wise, a filmmaker who seemed to be able to make a great film out of any genre, is at the helm, and he does a terrific job. He had worked with Ryan before in the film noir, The Set-Up (1949). Wise, of course, won Oscars for directing The Sound of Music (1965) and co-directing West Side Story (1961), but also made such diverse classics as The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), The Haunting (1963), and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)!\n\nThis is an intense, engaging picture that generates suspense and has something to say. The script is top-notch, and the performances are heightened just enough to fit firmly into the film noir style. The music, composed by John Lewis and performed by the Modern Jazz Quartet, is phenomenally good, adding another level to the tone and feel of the movie.\n\nKino Lorber Studio Classics’ new Blu-ray presentation is sharp and clean in glorious black and white. There is an accompanying audio commentary by author/film historian Alan K. Rode. Supplements include Post Screening Q&A interviews with Harry Belafonte (in 2009) and Kim Hamilton (in 2007), plus the theatrical trailer for this and other Kino Lorber film noir titles.\n\nOdds Against Tomorrow is for fans of film noir, heist movies, Robert Wise, Harry Belafonte, Robert Ryan, and other members of the sparkling cast.

This reviewer found many of the comic bits and one-liners to be quite funny, and despite their aging personas (especially Crosby), the duo are in good form.\n\nThe series began in 1940 with Road to Singapore and continued through the forties. They were huge successes for Paramount Pictures. The single title made in the fifties (and the only one shot in color), Road to Bali (1952), seemed to be the swan song. It wasn’t until the early sixties that Crosby and Hope decided to do another, this time for United Artists and shot in the UK. Interestingly, fans of the James Bond film series will spot familiar faces and names either on camera or in the credits behind the scenes (Walter Gotell, Syd Cain, Bob Simmons, Maurice Binder, Wally Veevers).\n\nMore significant is that The Road to Hong Kong, directed by Norman Panama, features a spy adventure plot that is not unlike the early 007 pictures, and its release preceded the premiere of Dr. No by a little less than seven months! There is a SPECTRE-like villainous organization (the “Third Echelon”) and a caper involving nuclear weapons and space travel (shades of Dr. No and You Only Live Twice). The villains even operate from an underwater laboratory and control room that resembles that of Dr. No's. (When Bob Hope’s character sees all the men and women in lab coats sitting at terminals and monitors, he quips, “Oh, look, a school for television repairmen!”)\n\nAs usual, Crosby and Hope are conmen, Harry Turner and Chester Babcock, who unwittingly become involved in a MacGuffin plot to steal plans for Russian rocket fuel so that the Third Echelon and their leader (Robert Morley) can launch nuclear missiles at earth from the moon. Echelon agent Diane (Joan Collins) at first works with the villains, but of course the wacky pair of Harry and Chester win her over to their side.\n\nOddly, longtime costar Dorothy Lamour is relegated to helping the boys in a small sequence and musical number near the end of the film. It’s a shocking example of how Hollywood viewed aging female stars. A much younger Collins was cast as the lead this time, with Lamour pushed into what amounts to a glorified cameo. Never mind that both Crosby and Hope are much older than Collins and are Lamour’s contemporaries!\n\nIt's almost impossible in this day and age not to view the film through the lens of cultural misappropriation. Despite the movie mostly taking place in British Hong Kong, there are very few Asian actors to be seen (and they are mostly extras). Too many white men and women are costumed and made up to be “Asian” (and even Harry participates thusly as part of a disguise). This kind of thing occurred in every Road to… picture, from Singapore to Morocco to Bali. But, as classic film aficionados know, one must approach older films within the context of when they were made and released. In 1962, this sort of thing was commonplace.\n\nAn old-school audience will certainly enjoy The Road to Hong Kong. The singing and dancing, the slapstick hijinks, the snappy and silly dialogue, and the references to the previous Roads are enough to delight. Another fun aspect are the many cameos from the likes of Peter Sellers, David Niven, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jerry Colonna, and others.\n\nKino Lorber Studio Classics presents a sharp-looking Blu-ray restoration in glorious black and white (this one surely would have benefited from color). An insightful audio commentary by film historian/filmmaker Michael Schlesinger and archivist/historian Stan Taffel accompanies the feature. Rounding out the disk are theatrical trailers from this movie, other Road titles, and other Kino releases.\n\nThe Road to Hong Kong is for fans of the series, of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and for vintage Hollywood and British films of the early 1960s.

Kolker and Nathan Abrams\n\n(UK: Faber & Faber; ISBN: 978-0571370368; January 2024)\n\n(US: Pegasus Books; ISBN: 978-1639366248; February 2024)\n\n“ANATOMY OF AN ARTIST”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nSeveral biographies of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick have been published, as well as numerous books on the director’s filmography, works on specific movies, and pieces of ephemeral studies. It is said that more has been written about Stanley Kubrick than any other important cinema artist except for Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nNow comes the hefty, superb tome by Robert P. Kolker and Nathan Abrams, Kubrick: An Odyssey. As someone who has been a Kubrick aficionado since the late 1960s, having read nearly all the existing titles about him, been to his estate in England, visited his archives at London’s University of Arts, and currently know members of his family, I can confidently say that Kubrick: An Odyssey is the most outstanding biographical work on this enigmatic and challenging filmmaker to date.\n\nPrevious biographies, while admirable, suffered from the lack of enough material, due to inaccessibility, about Kubrick’s personal life. Granted, Stanley Kubrick was an extremely private individual and he guarded his privacy as if it were a fortress. Most of the books out there are simply examinations and analyses of Kubrick’s films (and many are excellent). The closest we got to an intimately personal look at Stanley Kubrick was the 2012 memoir by his trusted driver and assistant, Emilio D’Alessandro (co-written with Filippo Ulivieri), Stanley Kubrick and Me.\n\nThe new book by Kolker and Abrams changes that. With access to Kubrick’s archives and to family members, the authors have penetrated the mountains of correspondence and the treasure troves of boxes that Kubrick left behind after his sudden passing in March 1999, four-and-a-half months before the premiere of his final feature, Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nIt’s a big book, one that covers every aspect of Kubrick’s life from childhood to death. Thankfully, it is not written in an academic style; Kubrick: An Odyssey is immensely readable, it moves through the years with surprising details that many fans have never seen before. Want to know more about Kubrick’s first two marriages or who he dated in-between them? You can find out here! Additionally, the authors do not fawn over their subject; they are not afraid to uncover the warts, such as his curious battles with co-screenwriters over ownership. And yet, overall, Stanley Kubrick comes off as a human being who was devoted to his family, his home, and above all else, his work. This biography is an anatomy of an artist who insisted on carving a career path according to his own rules, convention be damned.\n\nDevotees of the filmmaker will learn more about Kubrick’s unrealized projects throughout the years. Many of these we knew about, but we perhaps didn’t have insight into how he might have made such possible films as Burning Secret, based on a Stefan Zweig novel about a rich baron who seduces a woman at a hotel spa by befriending her twelve-year-old son. Its themes of jealousy, illicit affairs, and confidences might have been an early take on what much later became Eyes Wide Shut. Kubrick had always had an interest in the subject of marital jealousy and had wanted to create something on that topic as far back as the 1950s.\n\nAnother tantalizing tidbit, first mentioned by biographer John Baxter, is that in 1960, Kubrick may have been speaking to executives at MCA about adapting for television a detective series, Dr. Brilliant, created by none other than Ian Fleming!\n\nThe usual tropes of Kubrick’s perfectionism and obstinate penchant for multiple takes on movie sets are discussed, and many are put to rest as myths. The authors cannily peel back the façade that the press and PR have painted of Kubrick. Underneath is a man of extraordinary intellect who deeply cared about his art. He took great pains—and lengthy amounts of time—to first choose and then come to grips with a project in order to develop the passion he required to invest the energy into seeing them through to fruition. Coupled with this fervor for cinema is Kubrick’s family man persona—once he had settled into his successful third marriage, he was surrounded by women (his wife and three daughters) and an abundance of dogs and cats (he was an animal lover, and that says a lot about Stanley Kubrick’s personality).\n\nFor the films themselves, there is plenty here about the morsels that generated Kubrick’s cult of followers—Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and all the others are discussed in depth.\n\nFor anyone interested in cinema history, exceptional filmmaking, and a director who rightly earned the label of auteur, Kubrick: An Odyssey is an exceptional, thorough biography of one of the most renowned and controversial names in motion pictures.\n\nClick here to pre-order from Amazon USA\n\nClick here to pre-order from Amazon UK\n\n“POWELL’S BIG BANG”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nThe British production, The Edge of the World, was acclaimed director Michael Powell’s first important feature film. Released in 1937, it was well-received in the U.K. and it also made something of a splash in the USA among the more discerning critics and audiences who appreciated non-Hollywood fare.\n\nPowell had been working in cinema in various capacities since the silent days as a still photographer, scriptwriter, and director of short films. Through most of the 1930s, he helmed over twenty pictures that had diverse levels of success, but it wasn’t until 1936-37 that he had the chance to make a truly personal film. This was the “big bang” breakthrough in his movie career.\n\nThe Edge of the World is based on a newspaper article Powell had read that documented how a remote island, St. Kilda in the Scottish Outer Hebrides, was losing its population due to the land’s inability to support the people, and because younger generations were fleeing to Scotland and England for better opportunities. Powell wrote an original script involving two families on such an island and how dramatic circumstances change their lives.\n\nUnable to film on St. Kilda, Powell chose the northern island of Foula in the Shetland Islands group. It was suitably similar in both the landscape and the people’s geo-political issues. With a handful of known actors and by casting many characters from the locals, Powell and cinematographers Monty Berman, Skeets Kelly, Ernest Palmer, and Powell himself, captured (even in black and white) the beauty and awesome grandeur of the cliffs-dominated island.\n\nTwo dominant families on the fictional island of Hirta, the Mansons and the Grays, are united by an upcoming marriage between Andrew Gray (Niall MacGinnis) and Ruth Manson (Belle Chrystall). Ruth’s brother, Robbie (Eric Berry) is Andrew’s best friend. Conflict arises when Robbie announces that he’s leaving the island to go “see the world” because there’s nothing left on Hirta for him. Losing someone like Robbie hurts the economy because there aren’t that many strapping young men to do the fishing and crofting. Andrew attempts to convince Robbie to stay, but Robbie will have none of it. Andrew’s father (Finlay Currie) is somewhat sympathetic to Robbie and believes that the islanders’ way of life is indeed diminishing and that they should all evacuate for the good of their children’s children. Robbie’s father (John Laurie) disagrees and is determined to stay, despite his son’s wishes. Andrew and Robbie challenge each other to an age-old tradition of racing up one of the cliffs to determine if Robbie should stay or not. The results of the contest are tragic… and this deeply affects the futures of the two families and the rest of the story.\n\nMichael Powell appears at the beginning of the film as a yachtsman escorting Andrew Gray back to the island for reminiscing (the rest of the movie is a flashback).\n\nShort and tight (at 75 minutes), The Edge of the World is a slice of life to which few of us today can relate, but it is a well-made, touching depiction of the story that Powell wanted to tell. Perhaps more important than the movie itself is the fact that the picture’s reception enabled Powell to go on to bigger and better projects, such as Thief of Bagdad (1940) and the eventual brilliant partnership with co-director Emeric Pressburger.\n\nIn fact, the making of The Edge of the World meant so much to Powell that he returned to Foula in 1978 with a camera crew and some of the surviving actors to make a short documentary, Return to the Edge of the World. This half hour program is in full color and is a warm reunion between the filmmakers and the people who still reside on the island.\n\nMilestone Film and Video presents a beautifully restored high definition of the feature film (distributed by Kino Lorber) with an audio commentary by Powell’s widow, Oscar-winning editor Thelma Schoonmaker, film historian Ian Christie, and Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis reading from Powell’s book on the making of the film (200,000 Feet on Foula).\n\nSupplements include alternate scenes; the original trailer; the documentary Return to the Edge of the World; Powell’s short 1941 film, An Airman’s Letter to His Mother; and Powell’s home movies shot on Foula, narrated by Schoonmaker.\n\nThe Edge of the World is recommended for fans of Michael Powell, Scotland history, and early British cinema.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\n“THE EDGE OF THE WORLD”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nOne of the more under-seen and underrated films from 1985 is John Boorman’s impressive The Emerald Forest, which gave us an ecological message long before that was much in the public consciousness.\n\nOf a more cinematic significance, this picture is a grand adventure full of action and spectacle, much like Boorman’s Deliverance (1972) or Excalibur (1981) before it. The production values also indicate that this was no easy feat of a movie to make.\n\nThe Emerald Forest was shot in and near São Paolo, Brazil, right smack by the Amazon River and in the rain forest. Native extras populated much of the movie, which possibly for the first time provided to audiences of a mainstream motion picture depictions of how indigenous tribes in the jungle live. The result is fascinating, and the National Geographic lesson is enhanced by an exciting tale of kidnapping, exploration, survival, and human trafficking!\n\nPowers Boothe is Bill, a high-ranking engineer with a corporation that is building a large hydro-electric dam on the edge of the rain forest. He’s moved his family of a wife and two young children—a boy and a girl—to the city. One day while overseeing the work of clearing the area of trees, Bill and his family have a picnic at the edge of the jungle. Little does he know that the “Invisible People,” a tribe that has not had contact with civilization, has dared to get close to what they refer to as “the edge of the world.” When Tommy wanders off, he is kidnapped by the tribe. Bill thus embarks on a long process to search for his son, but to no avail.\n\nTen years later, Tommy (Charley Boorman) has assimilated into the tribe and become one of the Invisible People. His “father” of the tribe (Rui Polanah) loves him like a son, and Tommy loves him back, although he has dreams of “Daddy.” Now Tommy is ready to take a mate, and he chooses young and beautiful Kachiri (Dira Paes). Meanwhile Bill and a photographer embark deep into the jungle to look for Tommy again. They encounter the hostile “Fierce People,” who force Bill to become prey in a hunt through the jungle. Tommy ends up saving Bill, and the real father and son reunite. Tommy, however, refuses to accompany Bill back to his first home. And then the human traffickers enter the story. To say more would spoil the tale!\n\nThere is a lot of “Tarzan movie” aspects to this picture, but without the unintentional racism. There is also a lot of nudity of all the indigenous people on display, which received some criticism when the picture was released (Dira Paes was only fifteen years old). However, this was not exploitation. Boorman and his team took great pains to be accurate and truthful in the depiction of the tribes’ customs and ways. Yes, the Fierce People are portrayed as the villains and the Invisible People are ultimately shown to be good at heart (even though they kidnapped a young white boy). There is indeed some idealism and moral ambiguity going on in The Emerald Forest, especially when it comes to the film’s climactic raid on a human trafficking center in the jungle. Finally, there is the message that indigenous people are being wiped out by the actions of white people who are cutting down rain forests.\n\nPowers Boothe does an admirable job here, but it is Charley Boorman (son of the director) who steals the movie. He was around eighteen when the picture was made, and he manages to speak the indigenous language, perform jungle stunts, and carry on with his native costars as if he were one of them. Boorman’s direction is notable, too, given the locale and the cast with whom he had to work. Philippe Rousselot’s cinematography is also quite commendable.\n\nKino Studio Classics’ new Blu-ray release is a welcome one, and its 1920x1080p presentation is colorful and rich. There is an audio commentary by filmmaker Edgar Pablos and film historian Nathaniel Thompson that sheds light on the production. Supplements include the theatrical trailer and other Kino trailers. There is also reversible sleeve artwork.\n\nThe Emerald Forest is for fans of director John Boorman and of jungle exploration adventures.

Blystone)\n\n(Cohen Film Collection)\n\n“KEATON CLASSICS DOUBLE FEATURE”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nThe availability of Buster Keaton on Blu-ray can be a head-scratcher. Kino Lorber seems to have the monopoly on Keaton’s features and shorts, but the puzzlement comes with more than one release of certain titles in Kino’s catalog of disks for sale. Add to this befuddlement is the Cohen Media Group and their Cohen Film Collection’s ownership of Keaton’s library. Cohen has also released Keaton Blu-ray disks—and they’re distributed by Kino Lorber! (And still others are released by Eureka Entertainment, licensed by Cohen!) Which editions are we supposed to get?\n\nA new Cohen Film Collection release, available from Kino Lorber, is The Buster Keaton Collection, Volume 5, which includes a double bill of the master filmmaker’s 1923 features—Three Ages and Our Hospitality. (Also available from Cohen Film Collection are Volumes 1 – 4, which likewise contain double bills of Keaton’s features from the 1920s.)\n\nHere on the Cinema Retro site, I reviewed the Kino Lorber release of Our Hospitality in 2019. Apparently the Kino versions are different restorations from the Cohen’s restorations. The latter are performed by Cineteca di Bologna as part of Cohen’s “Keaton Project.” Long ago, Cohen Media Group acquired the rights from the Keaton estate, even though other companies have had access to them. I won’t even attempt to sort out the rights issues here. Just know that the Kino Our Hospitality disk had bonus features, whereas the Cohen Film Collection double bill discussed here does not contain any supplements aside from Cohen’s own trailer of Our Hospitality release and other Cohen releases.\n\nThat said, the Cohen restorations by the Keaton Project are likely the best to come about. They look marvelous. Bonus features? Who needs supplements when the feature films are the best quality available?\n\nThree Ages was Buster Keaton’s first feature film (not counting The Saphead, 1920, in which he only starred). Co-directed with Eddie Cline, Keaton presents the “story of love,” i.e., courtship, in three different time periods—the stone age, the Roman age, and modern times (the 1920s, of course). The same cast portrays the same character types in each story, and the film narrative jumps back and forth between these time periods throughout the run of the picture. Keaton stars as the “lesser” man when compared to his more attractive, manly, and wealthier rival played by Wallace Beery. The woman who is the object of both men’s affection is played by Margaret Leahy (the actress made only one film, and this is it). Beery’s character is a bully, and Keaton must overcome the man’s physical strength and social standing with cunning and trickery. There is certainly amusement and clever bits here, but Three Ages could be called baby steps for Keaton as a feature filmmaker when compared to later works. Three Ages was perhaps the Keaton film most in need for preservation, as there are many instances—a few seconds here and there—in which visual elements are deteriorated. The restoration folks have done the best they could, and this is probably the finest you will ever see Three Ages. The lively score for this release is composed and conducted by Rodney Sauer.\n\nOf more importance and interest is Our Hospitality, considered one of Keaton’s greatest works, and it was only his second feature (it is co-directed by John G. Blystone). The story takes place in the early 1800s and draws upon a rural family feud like the Hatfields and McCoys—in this case the McKays and Canfields. When patriarch John McKay is killed by James Canfield (and vice versa), Mrs. McKay flees with little baby Willie McKay (played by Buster’s real-life infant son, Buster Keaton Jr.). Twenty years later, Willie inherits the old family estate in the south and returns to claim it, only vaguely aware of the feud that has existed for decades. On the way he meets Virginia (played by Keaton’s wife at the time, Natalie Talmadge), who happens to be a Canfield. Upon arrival at home, Willie continues to court Virginia, but her brothers won’t have it. The rest of the picture is a cats-and-mouse game of Willie avoiding being killed and at the same time wooing the woman he wants to marry.\n\nThere are many striking aspects about the picture. Keaton’s paid great attention to detail in the design and location shooting. Apparently, he took great pains to create realistic locomotives and tracks that depicted early train development in America (although he played with time period accuracy for the sake of more interesting visuals). The final act contains some spectacular and hair-raising stunt work by the star, including an incident of falling into rapids and almost drowning on camera. Mostly, though, the story is well-constructed, the characters have more depth than in the other silent comedies of the day, and, in the end, Our Hospitality is one of Keaton’s most satisfying movies.\n\nInterestingly, it’s the only Keaton film to feature three generations of Keatons—Buster himself, his previously-mentioned son, and his father, Joe Keaton, as a train engineer.\n\nThe Cohen presentation here is gorgeous and near perfect. Carl Davis supplied the wonderful musical score that accompanies it.\n\nFor Buster Keaton fans, you can’t go wrong with this double bill release (nor with the Cohen Film Collection’s other four volumes). Highly recommended.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\n“WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nThe celebrated filmmaker Elia Kazan’s last picture, The Last Tycoon, was adapted from celebrated writer F. Scott Fitzgerald’s last novel (published unfinished in 1941). Released in 1976, the film features a stellar cast, Oscar-nominated Art Direction, and a respectful, intelligent screenplay by playwright Harold Pinter.\n\nAnd yet, The Last Tycoon is a noble and interesting failure. That is not to say it’s not worth seeing. There is a lot to admire in the movie, especially for audiences interested in Hollywood history.\n\nRobert De Niro plays Monroe Stahr, the production chief and creative head of one of the biggest studios in 1930s Hollywood. Anyone who knows anything about this era of Tinsel Town will realize instantly that the character of Monroe is inspired by Irving Thalberg, the genius producer who held the same jobs at MGM during its golden age. He’s young, handsome, smart, and has some health problems… but he has a way dealing with talent and executives.\n\nRobert Mitchum is the head of the studio, Pat Brady, perhaps something of the Louis B. Mayer of the story. His daughter, Cecilia (the radiant Theresa Russell in her first film) would like nothing more than to be with Monroe, but the moody and melancholic Monroe, a widower, has his eyes and heart set on the enigmatic Kathleen (Ingrid Boulting in her first film), a woman of beauty and mystery who is not part of the Hollywood scene.\n\nThrow in a supporting cast—the likes of Tony Curtis, Jack Nicholson, Jeanne Moreau, Ray Milland, Donald Pleasence, Dana Andrews, Peter Strauss, Jeff Corey, John Carradine, and even a young Anjelica Huston in a small role—and you’ve got classic Hollywood on the screen.\n\nSo what’s the problem? Pinter’s script does a splendid job of emphasizing the themes of the novel and Kazan manages to present a gorgeous-looking canvas of star power and fine acting… but the movie ends up being, well, flat. There’s something missing.\n\nGuess what… the missing element is the source material. Fitzgerald’s unfinished novel is about dreams and ambitions left “unfinished.” Monroe’s “lonely at the top” persona is because his life and work is unfulfilled, just like the house he’s building on the beach—it’s unfinished. It’s not even clear that he wants to finish it.\n\nThe main love story thrust of the movie—that of Monroe pursuing Kathleen—is ultimately unsatisfying, even if what does occur is what naturally should. Once again, the issue is that we are left with threads that are vague, uncertain, and unsettled.\n\nIn a wonderful bit in which a famous novelist played by Donald Pleasence is having difficulty adapting his style of excessive dialogue to the movies, Monroe improvises a scene without characters speaking by describing what a character “sees,” and in turn, what the audience sees. When Monroe stops without completing the scene, Pleasence asks, “What happens next?” And Monroe has made his point that the pictures are a visual medium.\n\nWhat happens next? Exactly.\n\nUnfinished.\n\nThere is an intriguing subplot tease involving the possible formation of a writers union (in which one of those “commie” organizers from New York, played by Nicholson, attempts to come to terms with Monroe), but this, too, is never resolved. The sequence is doubly ironic in that Kazan himself was embroiled in the HUAC Red Scare witch hunts in Hollywood in the 1950s, and there was a large faction in that town who had knives out for the director in later years for his cooperation with the government.\n\nIt was an honorable attempt to bring Fitzgerald’s The Last Tycoon to the screen, though. Revisiting the picture after nearly fifty years, seeing these actors again when they were young and vibrant, and delving into the myths and ambiguities of the Golden Age of Hollywood is still very much worth the time.\n\nKino Classics’ Blu-ray release features a handsome 1920x1080 restoration that shows off Victor J. Kemper’s cinematography and the lush production design by Gene Callahan, Jack T. Collis, and Jerry Wunderlich. There is an audio commentary by film historian Joseph McBride, who shines light on the darkness of this strange piece of cinema. Trailers of other Kino Lorber titles round out the supplements.\n\nThe Last Tycoon is for fans of classic Hollywood, Robert De Niro, Elia Kazan, Harold Pinter, and any of the other actors featured in this unusual presentation.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\n“THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE!”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nIt was hyped to be another film like The Sting (1973)—a clever heist caper in a period setting with charismatic actors, witty dialogue, and a lively, comical tone. Michael Crichton had written a historical novel, The Great Train Robbery (published in 1975), which was based on the true story of the first train robbery in Britain. In 1855, Britain was engaged in the Crimean War and a large amount of gold was shipped monthly from London to pay the troops. A fellow named William Pierce and his accomplice Edward Agar planned the robbery and pulled it off, much to the dismay of the British authorities.\n\nCrichton was keen on getting a film made based on his book, so he went ahead and wrote the screenplay himself. He also changed the character names to Edward Pierce and Robert Agar and added a lot more “fun” to the proceedings for a romp of a cinematic experience. Dino De Laurentiis picked up the film rights and it wasn’t difficult to get the thing financed and distributed by United Artists. Released first in the U.K., the title was changed, oddly, to The First Great Train Robbery. However, in the United States and rest of the world, the picture bore the simpler title from the book, The Great Train Robbery.\n\nPierce (Sean Connery) is a man-about-London with high society connections, but he’s also a con man with his own cadre of pickpockets and small time crooks. Among them is Agar (Donald Sutherland), who is adept at lock-picking and copying keys, and Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down), who has the talent to assume several personas—usually, though, that of sexy bait for unsuspecting victims. The bank manager, Fowler (Malcolm Terris), has loose lips and reveals the secret about the gold’s security on the train—the safes can be opened only with four different keys, each carried by different people. Pierce sets about instigating elaborate schemes to first obtain each individual key, making copies of them, and then to infiltrate the train and snatch the gold. Every step of the way, Agar pronounces, “That’s impossible!” to comical effect, only to follow Pierce’s instructions to the letter, succeed, and move forward to the next challenge. To reveal more would certainly be a spoiler!\n\nThe movie is entertaining and good enough—but it’s not the equal of The Sting. Much of the film’s strength comes from watching Connery in action in a role that is similar to the certain suave operator we all associate with the actor, only he’s been transported to 1855 England. Dressed in the height of fashion for the time, Connery is charming, dapper, and looks marvelous. There are moments, though, in which it seems that Connery isn’t totally comfortable in the role. This might be due to weaknesses in the dialogue and direction, which sadly do not always rise to the occasion. Sutherland is also winning, although his British accent goes in and out throughout the movie. Perhaps the most engaging performer is Down, an extremely attractive and talented actress who unfortunately didn’t retain the early success of her appearances in the late 70s and early 80s.\n\nThe cinematography (by Geoffrey Unsworth), along with the production and costume designs, are all exquisite. However, despite winning an Edgar Allan Poe Award from Mystery Writers of America for the screenplay, it is the dialogue which causes one to wince at its over-the-top instances of risqué innuendo. The direction, too, is of journeyman quality; the picture could have benefited from a Nicholas Meyer or even a Spielberg. That said, Connery allegedly performed the top-of-the-train stunts himself, which, given that revelation, is surprising. While not in the same league as top-of-the-train stunts today (i.e., Skyfall, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning, Part One), for 1978 the stunt work is impressive.\n\nKino Lorber has issued a new Blu-ray disk that looks gorgeous and contains an archival audio commentary by the late writer/director Crichton. The only other supplements are trailers from other Crichton features and Kino Lorber releases.

The latter was also producer and director of the picture, although the production company was the first title made by the newly-formed Marilyn Monroe Productions. The 2011 picture (was it that long ago?), My Week with Marilyn, featuring Michelle Williams and Kenneth Branagh, depicted the stormy relationship between Monroe and Olivier and how Monroe behaved rather, well, erratically and irrationally toward her director/co-star, other actors, the cinematographer, the costumer, and nearly everyone else on the set. The actress even brought something of a “support coach” with her every day in the form of Paula Strasberg, who, with her husband Lee, ran the Actors Studio.\n\nUnless one had actually seen the real movie, The Prince and the Showgirl, one came away from My Week with Marilyn with the impression that Monroe was a mess, that Olivier hated her guts, and that the movie they made was a disaster.\n\nThe Prince and the Showgirl is actually a charming, well-acted, funny, and touching piece of work. This reviewer is happy to say that Marilyn Monroe is marvelous in the role of Elsie Marina, a chorus line showgirl of a musical playing in London’s West End in 1911, when the picture takes place. Monroe displays impressive comic timing and wit, does a pratfall or two with aplomb, and categorially holds her own against the likes of renowned thespian Olivier. He, too, is quite winning, even though his accent as a “Carpathian” prince regent (from the Balkans) sometimes causes one’s eyebrows to rise. But make no mistake—this movie belongs to Monroe, and this reviewer would easily cite her performance here ranked in her top five.\n\nFunny how the bad rep of a movie and its making clouds what one really sees on the screen.\n\nGranted, The Prince and the Showgirl was received with lukewarm praise upon its release. The BAFTAs honored it with several nominations, including Actor, “Foreign” Actress, Screenplay, and British Film. It received no Academy Award nominations. The film did very well in the UK, likely due to Olivier’s presence. Perhaps the picture’s indifferent reception in the USA was due to its rather slow pace, length (a few minutes under two hours), and the fact that the story takes place mostly in static one-room sequences of the Carpathian Embassy. That’s not surprising, because the movie is based on a stage play, The Sleeping Prince, by Terrence Rattigan, who also penned the screenplay. Perhaps Rattigan adhered too closely to the conventions of the stage. All of these things are indeed flaws in the motion picture.\n\nStill… this is a worthwhile romantic comedy on the strength of the two leads, especially Monroe’s luminous performance. Not only does she look fantastic, as always, but she truly does light up the screen with charisma, warmth, and delight. Other standouts in the cast would include Richard Wattis, who nearly steals the movie as the frustrated foreign office suit who is charged with keeping the prince happy during his stay in London, Sybil Thorndike as the prince’s dowdy but often frank mother-in-law, and Jeremy Spenser as the prince’s son, King Nicolas, who to this reviewer resembles what Quentin Tarantino might have looked like at the age of sixteen.\n\nThe Warner Archive has released a region-free, beautifully rendered, restored presentation of the feature film in high definition. That 1950s-era Technicolor pops out, and the costumes are undeniably gorgeous. Unfortunately, the only supplement on the disk is the theatrical trailer.\n\nThe Prince and the Showgirl is enthusiastically recommended for fans of Marilyn Monroe. Fans of Olivier, who does what he can when someone so appealing is sharing the screen with him, will find it interesting. For this reviewer’s money, The Prince and the Showgirl is far more enjoyable than My Week with Marilyn, which now seems to be a rather sordid coda to this romantic comedy bauble.\n\nClick here to order from the Cinema Retro Movie Store.\n\nREVIEW: \"THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI\" (1947) DIRECTED BY ORSON WELLES (UNCREDITED); KINO LORBER BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION\n\n“A MAZE OF MIRRORS”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nPoor Orson Welles. After the critical success but box office failure that was Citizen Kane (1941), it seemed as though the “boy genius” could never again get his ultimate vision on the screen when he was working in Hollywood. The studio butchered his second picture, The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), although the version released is still pretty much a masterpiece and earned an Oscar Best Picture nomination. Still, it didn’t make money. After that, Welles was persona non grata in Hollywood, at least as a director. The studios were happy to have him as an actor.\n\nNevertheless, he continued to squeeze his way in and make more Hollywood pictures. He produced, co-wrote, and acted in Journey Into Fear (1943), and the story goes that he directed some of it uncredited (Norman Foster was the credited director). Welles then made The Stranger (1946) as an attempt to prove he could deliver a movie under budget and on time—and he did. The Stranger is perhaps Welles’ most “conventional” motion picture and it made money. Unfortunately, RKO (the studio that had made his previous three films) still turned its back on Welles.\n\nThe filmmaker’s next title, The Lady from Shanghai (1947), was made for Columbia Pictures. Legend has it that Welles, who in 1946 was producing with Mike Todd a Broadway stage musical based on Around the World in Eighty Days, needed $50,000 to complete the budget so that the musical could open. He called Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia, and offered to write and star in a movie for that amount of money,and direct the picture for free and with no credit. Cohn asked, “What do you have in mind?” It may be an apocryphal story, but Welles, who was calling Cohn from a phone booth, either saw a woman reading a pulp paperback or he spied it on a rack of books. It was called If I Die Before I Wake, a 1938 potboiler by Raymond Sherwood King. Welles, off the cuff, grabbed the book and read the blurb on the back to tell Cohn what the movie was about, but he improvised the title, calling it The Lady from Shanghai. (And, indeed, Welles does not receive a credit for directing—there is no directing credit at all.)\n\nCohn made the deal, but on one condition—it had to star Rita Hayworth, who was at the time Columbia’s biggest star. The problem with that was that Hayworth and Welles were married, but their union was on the rocks. They were estranged from each other.\n\nBut, hey, both Welles and Hayworth were professionals. They could work together. And they did. Welles assembled the cast, wrote the script, and proceeded to film on location (New York, San Francisco, out at sea) so that no one would interfere with the work. Of course, he went over budget and delivered a movie that was three hours long. Cohn went berserk, took the film away from Welles, and cut it down to approximately 90 minutes. Once again, Welles’ “vision” was hijacked.\n\nAnd yet… AND YET… The Lady from Shanghai is a MARVELOUS motion picture! No, it wasn’t well received by the critics or the public in 1948 when it was finally released (it had premiered in France in 1947)… but time is often kind to movies made by Orson Welles, and today The Lady from Shanghai is considered a film noir classic.\n\nFilm noir (not a term used at the time) was big in the late 1940s. Movies like Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Killers, and Out of the Past were coming out fast and furiously. The Lady from Shanghai and The Stranger are Welles’ contributions to that stylistic movement of dark shadows, high contrast lighting, Expressionistic design, cynical and hard-boiled characters, and crime that doesn’t pay.\n\nMichael O’Hara (Welles) is an out of work seaman who meets gorgeous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth) in Central Park one evening. He immediately falls for her, even though she is married to one of the country’s most accomplished defense attorneys, Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane). O’Hara is hired to be a crewman on Bannister’s yacht as the couple sails around North America, through the Panama Canal, from New York to San Francisco. Along the way, Bannister’s sleazy business partner, George Grisby (stage actor Glenn Anders, in an extraordinary, eccentric performance), asks O’Hara to “kill” him in a plot to fake his own death. O’Hara would be paid enough money for he and Elsa to run away together. Ah, but nothing is what it seems. Grisby is, of course, setting up O’Hara for a big fall, and Elsa is, you guessed it, a femme fatale.\n\nThe plot is rather complex and there was much critical lashing at the time of the movie’s release that it was “incomprehensible,” but this is simply not the case. Even though Columbia deleted 1-1/2 hours from Welles’ rough cut, the story still makes sense… and as film noir expert Eddie Muller explains on one of the Blu-ray disk’s supplements, what isn’t explained in the movie can easily be interpreted by audiences who are somewhat intelligent. (He calls it a “film noir poem.”)\n\nThe most memorable sequence is the famed climax that takes place at an abandoned amusement park outside San Francisco. The chase and ultimate shootout in an old fun house made up of a mirror maze has been copied many times in subsequent motion pictures (Enter the Dragon and The Man with the Golden Gun, for example). But the surreal quality of Welles’ direction of this sequence reminds one of the surrealist paintings of Salvador Dalí, and it is masterfully presented. Supposedly the scene was to have lasted nearly twenty minutes. If only we could see what ended up on the cutting room floor!\n\nThe new Blu-ray edition from Kino Lorber looks exquisite. The glorious black and white cinematography (by the credited Charles Lawton Jr., with uncredited work by Rudolph Maté and Joseph Walker) is sharp and clear. There are three different audio commentaries one can choose to accompany the film: one by film historian Imogen Sara Smith, another by novelist and critic Tim Lucas, and another by filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich, who spent a lot of his later career commenting on Welles’ life and work. An additional video supplement is an interview with Bogdanovich about the making of the movie. A video interview with Eddie Muller shines a light on the apocryphal tales of the movie’s production. Finally, the theatrical trailer rounds out the package.\n\nThe Lady from Shanghai is a top-notch gem, and the new Kino Lorber release is a good way to experience it. For fans of film noir, Orson Welles, and Rita Hayworth. Highly recommended.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\nRAYMOND BENSON INTERVIEWED IN CHICAGO TRIBUNE\n\n(Photo: Chicago Tribune)\n\nForgive us for being a bit self-indulgent, but we wanted to draw readers' attention to an article in the prestigious Chicago Tribune about Cinema Retro's very own Raymond Benson, who is riding high with the rave reviews of his new Covid-era mystery-thriller \"The Mad, Mad Murders of Marigold Way.\" Regular readers know that Raymond was once chosen by Ian Fleming's estate to write six official James Bond novels.

He is often called the first “writer-director” who would helm his own screenplays (actually this is untrue, since Charles Chaplin had been doing it since 1914, and Orson Welles was also doing it in the early 40s), but there is no question that Sturges became an auteur of sorts in those glorious five years. His flame burned brightly for that short period, and then it sadly weakened and eventually blew out.\n\nOne of the reasons for the filmmaker’s demise was the unfortunate production of The Great Moment, a biopic of a 19th Century dentist named Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, who is (mostly) credited as discovering the use of ether as an anesthetic for surgery.\n\nSturges, who was known for his acerbic comedies like The Great McGinty (1940), The Lady Eve (1941), and Sullivan’s Travels (1942), was apparently obsessed with Morton’s story and had been working on a script as early as 1939 to be directed by Henry Hathaway. That project was shelved, and then Sturges began his run of directing his own scripts in 1940. He resurrected the Morton biopic on his own in 1942. It was based on the book Triumph Over Pain (1940) by René Fülüp-Miller, and that also became the title of Sturges’ script. The film was shot before the making of The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek and Hail the Conquering Hero! (both released in 1944). But Paramount, Sturges’ studio, didn’t like the Morton biopic Sturges had made, and they took control away from the writer-director, retitled it The Great Moment, and re-edited it. The film was finally released two years after its production in 1944, after Miracle and Conquering Hero. By then, Sturges had already left Paramount in disgust. The Great Moment bombed at the box office and critics hated it. Sturges made a few more films for other studios, but his career never regained the peak of his earlier Paramount successes.\n\nThe Great Moment exhibits how Dr. Morton (Joel McCrea) discovers that ether allows him to successfully pull a tooth from patient Eben Frost (Sturges’ stalwart character actor William Demarest), so he develops a specially shaped bottle from which patients can inhale the ether vapors. History has shown that Morton pulled pieces of his “idea” from other doctors and his mentor, surgeon Professor Warren (Harry Carey), and the story illustrates this. After Morton’s discovery, he endured attacks to his claim, especially when he attempts to patent the process. The medical profession is quick to condemn Morton for what they perceive as “monetizing” the method by patenting it, even though Morton has no intention of making a profit. He simply doesn’t want to reveal the ingredients of what’s in the bottle. Morton and his wife, Elizabeth (Betty Field), withstand hardships as Morton stubbornly pursues his claims in courts and even in a petition to the president of the United States.\n\nDoesn’t sound like a comedy, does it? Well, it isn’t. There are humorous bits and pieces in The Great Moment (mostly from Demarest), but the studio was correct in determining that the film was not in keeping with the previous “Preston Sturges Comedies.” Never mind that Sturges had likely made a good biopic with a message about sacrifice. Paramount deleted scenes, rearranged the narrative flow, and emphasized the few comic bits—and then they marketed the film as if it were a Preston Sturges Comedy. It’s no wonder that audiences were disappointed.\n\nIn viewing The Great Moment today, one can see that it’s not a good film. It really is “anesthesia on celluloid.” It is, as the late filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich calls it in a supplement included on the new Kino Lorber disk, a “mess.” The thing is, Sturges can’t be blamed for it. But for Preston Sturges fans, it is an interesting document. We can see that there are indeed Sturges’ fingerprints all through the picture, and many of the Sturges “stock company” are present (such as Franklin Pangborn, Porter Hall, and others). The irony and bite that is pure Sturges is often there in the dialogue.\n\nIn short, The Great Moment is a great failure, but one that illustrates how Hollywood tended to squash talented auteurs who bucked the system in the 1940s (like Sturges and Welles).\n\nKino Lorber’s new Blu-ray edition looks pristine and sharp in its glorious black and white. The disk includes the previously mentioned supplement, “Triumph Over Pain: A Celebration of Preston Sturges,” which is a three-way Zoom call between Tom Sturges (Preston’s son), Bogdanovich, and film historian Constantine Nasr. This is a lot of fun and very informative (perhaps more entertaining than the feature film!). Also of interest is a lengthy Introduction by Nasr, which goes into the history of the problematic production. The theatrical trailers for this and other Sturges’ releases round out the package.\n\nThe Great Moment is for fans of Preston Sturges, to be sure, but also for historians interested in documentation of Hollywood’s miscalculations and bone-headed decisions when it came to filmmakers who likely knew much more about what they were doing than the studios behind them.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\nREVIEW: DAVID LYNCH'S \"LOST HIGHWAY\" (1997); CRITERION 4K UHD/ BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION\n\n“A FEAR OF FUGUES”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nDavid Lynch’s challenging 1997 feature, Lost Highway, has had a tortured home video release history. After an initial VHS release, and then one on DVD, rights issues and a lack of interest by media companies prevented a Blu-ray release in the USA for many years. Less-than-ideal quality imported Blu-ray editions from various countries were circulated among Lynch fans and collectors. Kino Lorber finally put out a decent Blu-ray in 2019, but it was criticized by home video review sites and by Lynch himself as having inferior quality, as it didn’t go through the stringent approval process to which the director was accustomed. Cinema Retro reviewed that edition, finding it not terrible and certainly adequate enough since it seemed that it was all that we were ever going to get.\n\nNow, however, The Criterion Collection has issued a new, director-approved 4K UHD edition that is an astonishingly gorgeous digital restoration with a new 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack and an alternate one of uncompressed stereo. Criterion’s Lost Highway can be purchased as a 2-disk set containing a 4K UHD disk of the film alone plus a Blu-ray disk of the film and all the supplements, or in a single disk Blu-ray package.\n\nMuch of what this reviewer has to say about the film itself is repeated from the earlier 2019 review.\n\nLost Highway is a disturbing and surreal work of art from Luis Buñuel’s heir apparent, and it’s a doozy. Lynch described the film as a “psychogenic fugue,” which is a fancy term for a dissociative disorder. The story concerns musician Fred Madison (Bill Pullman), who is having marriage trouble with his beautiful wife, Renee (Patricia Arquette). An outside force seems to be watching and harassing the couple by leaving intimate videotapes of themselves on their doorstep. Throw in some nightmares and the appearance of a “mystery man” (the very creepy Robert Blake) with powers that could only exist as dream logic, and Fred eventually loses it. Suddenly he’s arrested for killing his wife. But then—uh oh—while he’s sitting in a jail cell, he becomes… someone else. The cops find Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) in Fred’s place. Puzzled, they let Pete go, since he’s not the man they want. Now there’s a kind of alternate universe thing going on, because Patricia Arquette now plays Alice, the mistress of the cruel Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), who may in truth be a porn producer named Dick Laurent.\n\nConfused? Many audience members were baffled at the time of Lost Highway’s initial release. The picture marked the first in what might be called the “fugue trilogy” (the other parts being Mulholland Drive and INLAND EMPIRE), in which main characters become other people during the flow of the tales. After a second or third viewing and examining Lynch’s narrative conceits in the other movies, one can get a sense of what it’s all about.\n\nAnd this reviewer is not going to tell you. Just know that Lost Highway is about a man who murders his wife, and he is unable to live with himself—or inside his own mind—because of it. The film generates a good amount of dread, and it is pure Lynch. It marks a transition from earlier, more narrative-friendly pictures, to more dreamlike, experimental works of art that defy description—other than that they are “David Lynch Films.”\n\nPeter Deming’s cinematography is fully exploited in Criterion’s new restoration. His use of light and shadow is remarkable, and the bits in which Fred walks into a dark hallway and disappears, and then later reappears from the blackness, are canny metaphors for the themes in the movie.\n\nAs opposed to the earlier Kino disk, Criterion has included some choice supplements. Most notable is the 1997 feature documentary, Pretty as a Picture: The Art of David Lynch, which served as a behind-the-scenes “making of Lost Highway” piece as well as a look at Lynch’s career as an artist (painting/sculpture) and filmmaker. Highway cast members and crew are interviewed along with Lynch himself, and there are clips from earlier films, too. An audio-only excerpt from the audiobook of Lynch and Kristine McKenna’s biography, Room to Dream, covers the period in the mid-90s when Highway was made. Two archival featurettes about the making of the film and interviews with cast/crew are also welcome. The theatrical re-release trailer rounds out the package. The booklet feature interview excerpts from the publication Lynch on Lynch. Note that the feature film does not have chapter breaks, in keeping with other Lynch-approved Blu-ray and DVD releases.\n\nLost Highway has become more mysterious and admirable with age, and Criterion’s new release does the work justice. For fans of David Lynch, dark—very dark—crime dramas, surreal cinema, and bravura filmmaking.\n\nClick here to order from Amazon\n\nREVIEW: \"TAKE OUT\" (2004); CRITERION BLU-RAY SPECIAL EDITION\n\n“RAIN, A BIKE, WALK-UPS, AND THE DELIVERY GUY”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nThe filmmaker Sean Baker, who most recently gave us (along with co-producer Shih-Ching Tsou) such striking independent features as The Florida Project (2017) and Red Rocket (2021), began his career modestly with extremely low-budget indie pictures that take on a cinema verité style (a type of documentary-like filmmaking that is improvisational and attempts to capture “reality” in all of its harsh and spontaneous truths). Baker co-directed with Tsou his second feature film, released in 2004, Take Out, which is a slice of life tale that takes place within the twelve hours of a single day.\n\nMing Ding (Charles Jang) is an undocumented Chinese immigrant living in New York City’s Chinatown. He had come to America in search of a better way of life, leaving his wife and son in China until a later date when he could afford to bring them over legally. Unfortunately, he owes a great deal of money to an unscrupulous loan shark, whose muscle men show up at Ming’s apartment of squalor (where several immigrants also live) and demand that a payment of $800 be made by the end of the day or else Ming’s balance owed will be doubled. They strike Ming in the back with a hammer to emphasize their seriousness. Ming already has $500—his entire savings—so he must find $300 over the next several hours. Ming works as a delivery boy for a take out Chinese restaurant on the Upper West Side. One of his co-workers, Young (Jeng-Hua Yu), gives him $150. Thus begins a frantic, and tension-filled race against the clock for Ming to deliver enough orders to customers in an attempt to make $150 more in tips. Seeing that many customers barely tip anything at all, the task is definitely a challenge.\n\nCompounding the situation is that Mother Nature has decided that this would be a day in which torrential rain must plummet New York all day long. So poor Ming must ride his bicycle in the downpour back and forth from the restaurant to customers’ residences. Sometimes the elevator in high-rise buildings is out of order. Many times he must trek up the stairs to walk-up apartments. Customers run the gamut—some are nice and friendly; more are cranky or racist or cheapskates or all of the above- and, this being New York City, Ming must also be wary of criminals who might target him for the money he’s carrying.\n\nThis is a riveting piece of cinema that is not only suspenseful but also quite revealing. Those of us who have ordered take out Chinese food in the big city perhaps do not appreciate what a difficult job it is for the delivery guy. It is hard, thankless work. We also get to see how a storefront Chinese take-out place (not a sit-down restaurant) works behind the scenes. The manager and counter person, Big Sister (Wang-Thye Lee), is the conduit between the kitchen and the public. She speaks English perhaps better than any of the other employees, but she’s not beyond throwing insults to or cursing out rude customers in Mandarin that the recipients don’t understand.\n\nShih-Ching Tsou, who has collaborated with Baker as a producer on his subsequent pictures, was instrumental in bringing Take Out to life. She not only co-produced the movie, but also co-wrote and co-directed it with Baker, who cannot speak Mandarin or Cantonese. The script was written in English, but Tsou translated it into Chinese for the actors, who were, for the most part, amateurs. Baker did all of the striking camerawork himself along with the editing. Take Out is truly a “homemade” production.\n\nThe acting is remarkably potent. Charles Jang as Ming doesn’t say much in the movie, but his inner turmoil and frustrations are clearly evident in his charismatic demeanor and stoic facial expressions. He rarely reveals his pain, but we know what he’s feeling. Of special note is Wang-Thye Lee as Big Sister, who is in many ways the beating heart of the film. She is a pleasure to watch in action.\n\nThe Criterion Collection’s Blu-ray release presents a new 4K digital restoration, supervised and approved by Baker and Tsou. It has an uncompressed stereo soundtrack and comes with an audio commentary by Baker, Tsou, and Jang. There are new English subtitles, as well as English captioning for the hearing impaired. Supplements include a fascinating new documentary on the film featuring interviews with Baker, Tsou, Jang, Lee, and Yu; a vintage documentary on the making of the film; deleted scenes; Jang’s screen test; and the theatrical trailer. The booklet comes with an essay by filmmaker and author J. J. Murphy.\n\nTake Out is for fans of Sean Baker’s work, New York City locales, and independent filmmaking with a bite.

FIELDS”\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nKino Lorber has been releasing the W. C. Fields catalog in high definition, upgraded from previous releases on DVD, and two more have come to the fore—You’re Telling Me! and Man on the Flying Trapeze, two titles that don’t immediately come to mind when one thinks of top tier, classic Fields pictures, but never fear—they’re hilarious and worth a look.\n\nYou’re Telling Me! preceded The Old Fashioned Way and the brilliant It’s a Gift (both previously reviewed here at Cinema Retro), all three of which appeared in 1934, while Fields (real name—William Claude Dukenfield) still had a working contract with Paramount Pictures. Man on the Flying Trapeze was released in 1935, a return to a “Fields comedy” after the actor took a sidetrack sojourn, courtesy of Paramount, into more high-brow fare (David Copperfield, an Oscar Best Picture nominee, and Mississippi, a musical starring Bing Crosby).\n\nIn Telling Me, Fields is Sam Bisbee, an optometrist and amateur inventor (one of his inventions is a “nose-holder-upper,” which pulls one’s nose up to open the nasal passages when in bed). As usual, he’s married to a shrew of a wife (Louise Carter), who is embarrassed by the family’s social status of living “on the wrong side of the tracks.” Their daughter, Pauline (Joan Marsh), is sweet on Bob Murchison (Larry “Buster” Crabbe), who comes from a wealthy, upper class family. Bob’s snobby mother (Kathleen Howard) will not allow her son to marry Pauline, mainly because of her contempt for “low life” Sam. However, Sam by chance meets Princess Lescaboura (Adrienne Ames) on a train. The princess is a visiting dignitary, and she is impressed by Sam’s woeful story of his troubles. Sam i"
