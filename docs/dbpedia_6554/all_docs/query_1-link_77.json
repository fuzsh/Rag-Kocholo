        "text": "I'm glad the home of a once great television station will be still involved in the media and not turned into something else\n\nThey ought to call the centre 'Anglia' in some way... not that the name will ever die out in the East of England\n\n0\n\nIt's actually located next to a shopping centre built at the same time (and pretty grim) called Anglia Square, so in a way the name does live on but unfortunately associated with a cheap and nasty Chav's shopping centre!\n\nWhich is presumably why they filmed Trisha there - they just needed to pop out into Roys or Poundland for subjects and audience...\n\n0\n\ncromerlad wrote:\n\nAhem, yes, but when Trisha defected to five & producing her shows from Elstree????/somewhere near London.\n\nPresumably she now has a snatch squad based in Watford High St to fill the studio.\n\nActually I'm sure I read in the EDP she still lives in the Norwich area and is still keen to move the production back there, so perhaps the new studios will do the trick.\n\n0\n\nI used to work at Anglia House in the days when Vanessa Feltz still did the show that Trisha eventually took over. That was before the move down to Magdalen Street when the show was actually recorded in Anglia House. On recording days, several coaches from Essex would pull up outside the front of the building, and that's where most of the audience seemed to come from. They were shepherded straight off the bus and into the studio, and I always thought the security guys seemed more on edge at those times! I'm not sure what happened after Magdalen Street became the venue, but I would have thought a quick trawl of the local area would certainly have been in order.\n\nBy the way, I'm not altogether sure I should be showing my deep knowledge of this matter in public, but it's the 99p store which is in Anglia Square - Poundland is in the rather more salubrious surroundings of St Stephens Street in the main shopping area.\n\n0\n\nI stand corrected on Poundland - I only used to see it from the Park and Ride bus to Sprowston when I lived in Norfolk!\n\nWas it the old Anglia House studios that were the old Cattle market which David Niven is allegedly supposed to have called \"19th Century Fox\"?\n\nSuch a shame to see how Norwich has become less important as a tv centre.\n\n0\n\nI did actually think after I went to bed last night that whilst Poundland is located elsewhere, there is a Pound Stretcher in Anglia Square, so that migfht be what wombatofludham was thinking of, although you can't see it from the road. The 99p store is better though!\n\n(oops, maybe giving a bit too much away again there )\n\n0\n\nFred Flintstone wrote:\n\nWhere are Anglia based nowadays?\n\nStill in the original Anglia House (the old Corn Exchange) at the top of Prince of Wales Road. The bit which they expanded into in the 1970s (originally the old Post Office next door) is now being sold off, but Anglia still occupy the original building. There's also a new modern block at the back which is where the news operation is centred, but the actual news studios and a lot of the technical operations remain within the old building.\n\n0\n\nMr Media wrote:\n\nLudham! I used to live there!\n\nDid I read that the plans to convert the old studios down Magdalen Street have had a setback due to funding problems?\n\nI really ought to change my posting name to \"wombatformerlyofludhambutnowfairbourne\" but I doubt it will fit! I moved out of the village in September and moved to Wales!\n\nAccording to the EDP report the project has been given an extra Â£0.8m which is allowing the project to go ahead and courses are now being advertised for next September's academic year.\n\nOh, since I moved Ludham has been hit by flash flooding and a tornado. Nothing personal you understand!\n\n0"
