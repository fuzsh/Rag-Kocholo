        "text": "Granada (1956 – 2000)\n\n3sixtymedia (2000 – 2013)\n\nOld Granada Studios (2014 – 2018)\n\nManchester Studios (from 2019)\n\nVersa Manchester (from 2022)\n\nThe first purpose-built television studios to open in the UK were Granada’s in Manchester. The BBC would have got there before with TV Centre but due to finance problems, construction was put on hold for a few years during the Centre’s development. Granada started broadcasting from its new studios in Quay Street on 3rd May 1956. The company was awarded the franchise eighteen months before going on air. They were thus able to take their time designing a centre that fully met their needs. The two storey building seen in the foreground above was the first to be built, along with studios 2 and 4.\n\nSidney Bernstein, the owner of the company, decided to name the studios in even numbers only so it would appear that he had twice as many. Apparently, the rehearsal rooms in the main office block were also named ‘studios’ and given odd numbers. Which is odd.\n\nThe first few years of Coronation St came from Studio 2. In later years it moved to the slightly larger studio 6 and finally to Stages 1 and 2 in 1990. This studio became the home of Granada Reports – the regional news – as well as some sport and political programmes and a late night magazine show.\n\nStudio 4 was originally a small continuity studio which was only operational for a few years, although it famously hosted the first TV appearance of The Beatles in 1962. It was later converted to become the studios’ reception area.\n\nStudio 6 opened in December 1957. The distinctive eight-storey Granada House opened soon after. Studios 8 & 12 were constructed in 1958, along with a wide corridor for moving scenery and lighting equipment between the studios that became known as the M1. Studio 12 is about 8,000 sq ft and until Rediffusion’s studio 5 opened in 1960 was the biggest in the UK. Studio 8 was not a working studio for many years. It was built at the same time as 12 but was just used for scenery storage until it was equipped with EMI 2005 cameras, probably in 1972.\n\nThe ‘missing’ Studio 10 was in fact the Chelsea Palace Theatre in London – which opened as a TV studio in 1957.\n\nThe next step in 1959 was a linking block which included the canteen. This block also contained a sound dubbing studio, which was turned into a music recording studio in 1979. This much later became a backstage area for the Jeremy Kyle Show but has now been brought back into operation – more on this later. The technical block also opened in 1959. It contained the regional newsroom.\n\nStudios 8 and 12 were roughly the same width with 8 being about two-thirds the length of 12. When originally built, one end of this studio had an area with a low ceiling (8ft 8ins) behind the cyc track. This brought the total length of the studio floor to the same as studio 12.\n\nQuite what this low-ceilinged space was intended for is a bit of a mystery – too low to put any sets in, let alone a lighting rig. However, Chris Whitehead has informed me that it was occasionally used to house a small audience for University Challenge. (The other end of the studio had the Crown Court set semi-permanently in place so space was at a premium.) I suppose at some point someone must have wondered what the point of keeping it was. The space was walled off and turned into three large rooms – a wardrobe area, a costume store and a film vault. In 2018 when I looked round, the shelves in the film vault were full of boxes of videotapes – many brand new. Sadly worthless as they were obsolete formats.\n\nOddly, when I lit a show in studio 8 in 2004, the old studio plan I was given indicated that this area of the studio still existed (that’s how I know the height of the ceiling, which was helpfully marked on the plan).\n\nShows made in studio 8 included Lucky Numbers, The Shane Richie Experience and The Krypton Factor (both the original and the first series of the revised version in 2008).\n\nWhen they opened, the studios were of course equipped with black and white cameras but most of the studios were colourised around 1969. Chris Whitehead has written with an interesting story. It seems that Marconi were given the contract to refurbish studios 2, 4, 6 and 12. Studio 4 was the first to be fitted out – with Marconi Mk VIIs. However, these were so disliked by cameramen and engineers that the subsequent studios were equipped with EMI 2001s – even though Marconi still carried out the work of upgrading the galleries and other equipment. They must have been pretty cheesed off at having to supply cameras made by their arch-rival. Studio 8 was colourised a few years later – with EMI 2005s.\n\nThe studios were well designed for their day but a few shortcomings not surprisingly became clear over the subsequent decades. For example, only one scene dock door for each studio opening onto an internal scenery/props/lighting area with limited access to the outside for deliveries. The shapes and sizes may also not have turned out to be ideal for the range of shows that ended up being made in them. Curiously, despite decades of discovering what worked well and what worked less well, the managers of ITV North decided to advise the developers to almost exactly copy what they had here when they were involved in planning the new studios at MediaCity, rather than improve on them.\n\nIn October 2000, a big change came to the way the business was run. These studios and the BBC’s in Oxford Road were struggling to attract sufficient work and contain their costs. The two organisations decided to create a new company – ‘3sixtymedia’ – that would consolidate their Manchester operation at Granada’s studios. The board of 3sixtymedia was set up with three directors from Granada and two from the BBC with voting rights split 80:20 in favour of Granada. A number of redundancies were made in both companies. As part of the deal, both ITV and the BBC were forbidden from operating any other studios in competition with the new company in the Manchester area. Thus, the BBC’s studio A was closed and its technical equipment sold off or scrapped.\n\n3sixtymedia then offered the following TV studios:\n\nFrom 2005 to 2011 the old BBC studio A was operated by 3sixtymedia and offered for hire, albeit as a 4-waller. 3sixtymedia also had some 4-waller stages on or near the main Quay Street site. These were not equipped as television studios but some had TV lino or resin floors. These other spaces were as follows:\n\nCompared with most London based studios, none of these was particularly busy with some remaining empty for many weeks of the year. The exception was perhaps studio 6, with the Jeremy Kyle Show a popular (with some people) fixture of the ITV daytime schedule. However, Countdown moved from Leeds to Manchester in June 2009, providing a much-needed regular occupant of studio 8. University Challenge was the other user of this studio. These shows now share studio HQ4 at MediaCity, which is about the same size as studio 8. The Kyle show was axed in 2019.\n\nThe threat of closure was hanging over the Quay Street studios for a number of years. Indeed, it was a not very well-kept secret that the studios would be closing around 2011 and the operation would move to three almost identically-sized studios at MediaCity in Salford Quays. However, ITV made a surprise announcement in March 2009. It transpired that the developer, Peel, had ‘dramatically scaled back’ its financial commitment to the ITV element of the project. An ITV spokesman stated that “as a result, ITV will remain at its Quay Street base for the foreseeable future.” Interestingly, the staff were told that the focus would now be on ensuring that the Quay St building was fit for purpose.\n\nHowever, it was thought at the time that the area could not support two studio centres within a few miles of each other, particularly when each had three studios the same size. When the senior managers were replaced following a reshuffle at the top of ITV, the new ones reopened the negotiations with Peel. These lasted through most of 2010 until an announcement was made on 16th December that the move would indeed take place.\n\nThe final edition of Granada Reports came from studio 2 on 22nd March 2013. The last show recorded by ITV in the main studios was an edition of University Challenge made in studio 8 on 17th February 2013. During the summer and autumn of 2013 studio 12 was used as a workshop to construct new sets for Coronation St. Meanwhile, interestingly, I am told that studio 8 was left fully equipped and in standby mode ‘in case there were any problems at MediaCity.’ What could they have meant? This studio was also used to record interviews for the Goodbye to Granadaland documentary.\n\nUntil the building closed, studio 6 was used as the base for Provision – ITV’s lighting and camera hire company. Some of the monopoles from studio 6 were purchased by BBC S&PP and made their way to Elstree stage 9 where they were discovered to be about 4 feet too short. Each therefore had to have a 4-foot drop-arm on it. They didn’t last long. They were very heavy and frankly not terribly safe – I witnessed two collapsing during rigging on a sitcom at Elstree. In the summer of 2014 they were replaced with new ones and the old Granada ones were skipped.\n\nMeanwhile, Coronation St remained for the time being in its old studios. This move was delayed until the end of 2013 due to various problems including the construction of the main production building in Salford which it is said had to be dismantled during its construction and rebuilt. The last episode was made at Quay St on 20th December 2013.\n\nThe office staff moved into the Orange building at MediaCity from the autumn of 2012. As mentioned above, ITV have a block booking of studio HQ4 at dock10 for Countdown, Judge Rinder and University Challenge .\n\nIn August 2012 the press reported that the preferred bidder for the site was ‘Genr8 Developments’, who apparently offered more than £20m for the land. That doesn’t sound very much to me for a prime 13.5 acre site so maybe the press report was not accurate. I also heard that the studios might have been occupied by IKEA. (Make up your own joke here.) However, in September 2013 it was reported that developer Allied London had joined forces with Manchester City Council to acquire the site – they paid a reported £26.5m.\n\nIn January 2014 it was revealed that Allied London had taken a 5 year lease on the studios and associated buildings whilst they ‘worked up’ their plans for redeveloping the site. In the meantime, the buildings and area around became a new arts and cultural destination for Manchester called St John’s. The old Granada studios were renamed… wait for it… ‘Old Granada Studios’.\n\nDuring this period they were used for single camera productions such as Peaky Blinders, To Walk Invisible and the US/UK TV series Snatch, starring Rupert Grint. They were also used to record the 2018 series of Dragons’ Den. The 2019 series of Dragons’ Den used the newly re-opened Stage 1, as it did in 2020.\n\nManchester Studios/Versa Manchester\n\nNow, pay attention as this all gets a bit complicated.\n\nIn July 2018 the new head of the development, Melanie Jones, who clearly combines experience in property with enthusiasm for TV, made some interesting announcements. The studios would be kept on after all! In fact they would receive some new investment – gallery suites would be refitted and lighting rigs refurbished and they would be made available once more to be used as multicamera studios. This was a surprise to many. It had been assumed that the studios were just being made available as 4-wallers until their eventual demolition.\n\nIn an interesting interview in the summer of 2020 she said that when she took on the job she realised that the studios were too valuable an asset to simply demolish and replace with offices. (Where was she when TV Centre and TLS were sold off?!) So she made the case to Allied London and they agreed. She said that the best use of any building is what it was originally designed for. She also said that these studios are superbly designed in a way that would probably not be found in studios built today.\n\nThe studios are part of a redevelopment scheme in the St John’s area called Enterprise City and were initially marketed as ‘Manchester Studios.’ They are owned by All Studios (Allied London) but Versa is the company that is operating them. They were planning to offer studios 2, 6, 8 and 12 as well as Studio 1 (Stage 1) and the Breeze Studio and garden. Stage 2 has also been retained – as a visitor attraction. It is currently the home of ‘The Crystal Maze Experience’ (the show itself is filmed in Bristol.) There are no plans at the moment to make it available as a studio but it is part of the Manchester Studios/Versa Manchester portfolio.\n\nI visited in September 2018 and was astonished to see the floors of studios 8 and 12 covered in equipment. This had all come from TLS, which had closed down earlier in the year. There were dozens of monopoles (telescopes), lights, audience seating units, prop cages, teddy trucks, hoists and loads of other essential studio paraphernalia. No technical kit had been purchased from TLS however – it was all far too old and worn out.\n\nThe demolition of the surrounding buildings began in October. The original office block, designed by celebrated architect Ralph Tubbs, has been retained and turned into a luxury hotel with a restaurant on its roof. Interestingly, when it was originally designed, Bernstein asked for it to be easily adapted into a hotel in case the Granada business folded.\n\nAlongside it is a new building with shops on the ground floor and flats above, with a swimming pool on the roof. The area around will have houses and start-up workspace offices aimed at creative businesses. It’s all very imaginative and clearly demonstrates what could have been done at BBC Television Centre and The London Studios – retaining the original studios within the scheme and developing the buildings and land all around them. Shame on those who took the decision to destroy those invaluable, irreplaceable studios and well done to Allied London, showing how it should have been done.\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that the first two studios would be available for hire from July – these are the 10,200 sq ft Studio 1 and the 1,400 sq ft Breeze Studio and walled garden. Studio 1 has an annex studio of 3,300 sq ft accessed via a dock door (now called studio 2). The studio is sometimes quoted as being 13,000 sq ft but this is the two parts combined.\n\nIn June 2020 Studio 1 was fully fitted out as a 4K multicamera studio. It has been configured for audience shows and now has fully equipped galleries with kit from Sony, Calrec, Grass Valley, Riedel and EVS. There are also refurbished production offices, star dressing rooms, VIP and exec areas and green rooms. This large studio is a welcome addition to the range of facilities available in and around Manchester. Studio 1, previously used for Coronation Street, is in a separate building from the original Granada studios block. It should perhaps be pointed out that this studio has a very basic lighting grid of scaffold bars in the roof. This is far less flexible than the monopole grids found in the original studios in the main block. Early bookings included Dragons’ Den and RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.\n\nIn March 2021 I heard that a show was using studios 8 and 12, controlled via fibre from studio 1’s galleries. Studios 2, 6, 8 & 12 were originally due to be fully available for hire from June 2021. The plan was to have two or three fully equipped gallery suites that could be used flexibly between these studios. A few bookings were indeed carried out in the summer of 2021 but some working on those shows reported that the galleries were not equipped and work on the studios had not been completed. It does look as though perhaps the studios were opened a little too soon. In fact (more on this later) studios 8 and 12 have been fully equipped since the spring of 2024.\n\nAll the TV studios have retained their resin floors of course. Their lighting grids have been refurbished, replacing old scopes with those from TLS. There are also some new dimmers, although Studio 2 (now called studio 5) only has hard power available – the assumption being that LED lights will be used. Dressing rooms, green rooms and other areas have been created from spaces such as old dubbing suites, since the rooms behind studios 8 and 12 are no longer available. A 735 sq ft audio recording studio that has not been used for many years has also been brought back into operation and is now called studio 4.\n\nAs well as these TV studios, Manchester Studios/Versa Manchester are offering an area in the Bonded Warehouse consisting of six small ‘creative content’ studios – one of 535 sq ft and the others of 624 sq ft. These are interconnecting rooms that can be used as separate spaces or merge into a larger studio set-up. These are numbered A-F.\n\nAllied London, the company owning this development, are aware that by returning the TV studios to multicamera work they are unavailable for single camera drama productions so they have opened two acoustically treated new stages at Birchwood Park, just outside Manchester. These are 8,500 and 5,500 sq ft respectively.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that in the autumn of 2020, these studios were being marketed both by ‘All Studios’ and by ‘Versa Studios.’ The websites of both companies offered Manchester Studios, Leeds Studios (film stages converted from a former printworks) and a studio in London – which opened in 2021. This is in Kendal Avenue, Acton. They stated that they were due to open 20 studios/stages in 2021. The Versa website closed down soon afterwards and the home page simply said ‘coming soon’. It still said that in October 2021 so it seemed they were still not quite ready to fully launch all these studios. No doubt the Covid-19 pandemic had affected their plans.\n\nIn February 2022 the website was relaunched and there was a press release in which the following was stated:\n\nExecutive Director of Versa Charlie Ingall, said: “We are thrilled to be realising our ambition of expanding our operations into Manchester. In Manchester City centre, by Summer 2023, VERSA will be operating three fully equipped TV broadcast studios and a further 10 that will cater for a diverse range of production types including non-scripted broadcast TV, scripted film & drama, music, commercials, content creation and gaming. Our spaces will be ideal for a variety of uses including performance and events.\n\nSo along with studio 1, studios 8 and 12 would indeed become fully equipped TV studios – but not it would appear until summer 2023. All these studios are now being marketed as Versa Manchester. The new Versa Manchester website in February 2022 mentioned studio 1 (and studio 1A), the Breeze studio, the six small studios in the Bonded Warehouse and the new ABC studio, built for the BBC’s Morning Live (see below) but not studios 2, 6, 8 or 12.\n\nIn fact, at long last, the fully equipped gallery suites of studios 8 and 12 were opened in the spring of 2024. They can feed any of the on-site studios as well as the nearby new Aviva Studios with its 1,600 seat auditorium and attached performance space consisting of a 1,200 sq ft South Warehouse and 8,000 sq ft North Warehouse. These can all be combined to form an enormous venue. Being able to use the Versa facilities to televise events there is a very useful facility. In fact, the final of Channel 4’s excellent series The Piano used these facilities on April 21st 2024 to great effect – the galleries controlling cameras and sound in the Aviva auditorium.\n\nIt is worth noting that several of the studios were renumbered in 2024. This is now the current list:\n\nStudio 1 – the old Granada stage 1 as used by Coronation St. (this studio has a gallery suite)\n\nStudio 2 – the old Granada stage 1 annexe (1A)\n\nStudio 3 – the old Granada stage 2 annexe (this was originally built in 1986 for a House of Commons set.)\n\nStudio 4 – the original Granada music studio\n\nStudio 5 – the old Granada studio 2 in the main block\n\nStudio 6 – no change\n\nStudio 7 – the old Granada Breeze studio\n\nStudio 8 – no change (this studio has a gallery suite)\n\nStudio 9 – a streaming studio in the ABC building\n\nStudio 10 – the studio used by BBC Morning Live in the ABC building. (this studio has a gallery suite)\n\nStudio 11 – nothing so far!\n\nStudio 12 – no change (this studio has a gallery suite)\n\nStudios A-F – small studios in the Bonded Warehouse.\n\nVersa ABC Studio (studio 10)\n\nAlthough not actually part of the old Granada Studios, this new studio is part of the cluster of studios that Versa Manchester is offering. It opened in February 2022 and is a 1,500 sq ft ‘studio in the sky’ built on the top two floors of the ABC Buildings, a 1960s office block close to the Granada site. With dual aspect city centre views and a large roof terrace this studio has full production galleries, dressing rooms, hair and make up, green rooms and production office. The studio is now the home of BBC Morning Live, but is also available for use by other productions. In 2024 it was numbered studio 10.\n\nThus, who’d have thought it? – as well as the new Coronation St set-up at MediaCity, the only large TV studios still owned by ITV are the old Yorkshire TV ones in Leeds. Of which, see below...\n\nThe Leeds Studios (aka Kirkstall Road, Yorkshire TV) (1968 – present)\n\nAcross the Pennines from Manchester are The Leeds Studios, which are owned by ITV. (Not to be confused with ‘Leeds Studios’, owned by Versa Studios and due to open in 2021.) These ones opened in 1968, when Yorkshire TV began its new franchise for the north-east. The centre was constructed in Kirkstall Road on slum-clearance land and was said to be the first purpose-built colour television production centre in Europe. The building opened with these studios…\n\nstudio 1/1A – two small presentation studios sharing facilities\n\nstudio 2 – 1,225 sq ft\n\nstudio 3 – 4,430 sq ft\n\nThese three original studios were equipped with Marconi Mk VII colour cameras. In 1969 EMI 2001 cameras were purchased for the last studio to open…\n\nstudio 4 – 7,650 sq ft\n\nAround 1976 Philips LDK 25 cameras replaced the Marconis in studio 3.\n\nThe studio centre – still referred to by many people in the industry as ‘Yorkshire TV’ – is the base for the northern transmission area for ITV. Of the original four, only studios 3 and 4 remained in use during the first decade of the 21st century. Studio 3 had been the home of Countdown since 1982 when Channel 4 began broadcasting. Studio 4 had in latter years been mostly used as a 4-waller for dramas including Heartbeat, Where The Heart Is, The Royal, A Touch of Frost, Fat Friends, Bodies and Wire In The Blood, but was also used occasionally for multicamera work with Bruce’s Price is Right (’95 – ’01), My Parents Are Aliens, Question Time, Emmerdale, Bullseye and Win My Wage. In March and April 2006 Mastermind was recorded here as ITV’s Manchester studios were closed due to asbestos contamination. A celebrity edition of the snooker show Pot Black was made for Sport Relief in May 2006.\n\nSadly, The Royal and Heartbeat were axed by ITV in 2008, with A Touch of Frost ending in 2009. Once ITV’s Manchester Studios were fully operational again the old YTV studios had very few bookings during 2008/9 so their long-term future became doubtful. Countdown was the only regular occupant of studio 3, with 4 being empty for much of the time.\n\nAs many had feared, on 4th March 2009 Michael Grade (yes, him again) announced that the main studios would indeed be closing and Countdown would move to Manchester. Emmerdale ‘s production offices, post production work and interior set shooting would continue to be based in the buildings adjoining the centre (with exterior filming continuing at the programme’s purpose built facilities in Harewood) and the local ITV news programme Calendar would also continue to be based in its existing facilities at the site.\n\nIncidentally, I noted that Michael Grade referred to the soap as ‘Emmerdale Farm’ in his interview on Radio 4’s Today programme. It hadn’t been called that since 1989 so I’m sure that will have gone down very well with the production team. One assumes he wasn’t a regular viewer himself. When asked about the Leeds Studios closure Mr Grade dismissed the question by simply replying – “We move on.” With those blunt and rather tactless words he appeared to end 41 years of television from these studios.\n\nITV said that the studios would be ‘mothballed’ although the likelihood of them being brought back into operation by ITV looked slim. For a while there remained a chance that the studios might be run by an independent company with support from Screen Yorkshire and/or Yorkshire Forward, offering facilities to independent production companies. However, in May 2009 Yorkshire Forward announced that they had ruled out making a rescue bid.\n\nThe last edition of Countdown was recorded on 22nd April 2009. The show moved to Manchester’s Granada studios operated by 3sixtymedia and is now made in Peel’s studios in MediaCity.\n\nIn December 2009 there was a dramatic change of fortune for the studios. Rumours that had been circulating for about six months were confirmed. The studios received a £5.2m refit during 2010/2011 which included the latest HD tapeless facilities. The work was completed in summer 2011 and Emmerdale moved its interior sets, post production facilities and production offices into the building. These were previously housed in an old car showroom and were in need of updating.\n\nThe refit was considerable to say the least. The building was radically changed internally and now includes five studios. The two existing studios were completely refurbished and were joined by two converted from service dock areas and one in the former joinery workshop. They were acoustically treated and have TV resin floors and lighting grids. A sixth new studio space was planned for internal shots of police stations and hospitals but has not yet been created. As far as I am aware, these sets currently remain at 102 Kirkstall Rd. Please email me if you know different!\n\nTwo new gallery suites were also constructed along with a number of dressing rooms, prop stores, make-up areas and other facilities. This is all quite a contrast to the bad news announced by Michael Grade.\n\nSo the future of the studios is, after all, secure. At least, for as long as Emmerdale continues to run. (Don’t mention The Bill.)\n\nThus the studios are now as follows:\n\nstudio 1 – a space on the 1st floor intended to be used for the police station and hospital.\n\nstudio 2 – was the scene dock of studio 3\n\nstudio 3 (original) – contains the Woolpack and back rooms\n\nstudio 4 (original) – contains the factory, cafe and Home Farm\n\nstudio 5 – was the scene dock for studio 4\n\nstudio 6 – was the chippies workshop.\n\nStudios 2, 5 and 6 have simple scaffold lighting grids. The two production galleries can control any of the studio spaces. Occasionally the old space in Burley Road has been used for sets shooting PSC."
