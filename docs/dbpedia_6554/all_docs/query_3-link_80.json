        "text": "1950 – 1959 MID-LIFE CHALLENGES\n\nAs the fifties unfolded, Bing was still a top recording artist although the hits were less frequent. Novelty songs and then rock ‘n roll pushed the ballad singers into the background. Also Bing had not been helped by the death of his recording ‘guru’, Jack Kapp, in 1949 as this had resulted in a certain loss of structure and focus in his recording activities. In films Bing was playing older men and his radio audience, despite still being fairly significant, was steadily declining. He continued to avoid personal appearances and live shows. Bing’s voice could no longer hit the higher notes but the deep tones remained mellow and pleasant. Bing was, however, said to be losing confidence in his voice. Health problems troubled him with first an operation to remove his appendix and then two separate operations for kidney problems, laying him low for a while. His wife Dixie Lee died in 1952 and this badly affected Bing both emotionally and financially. A huge tax bill had to be paid following Dixie’s death and then Bing also faced a legal battle following a car crash. His sons started to hit the headlines with various problems and it was not surprising that for a while Bing seemed to be adopting a lower profile, although he continued to make films.\n\nBing had given two very good dramatic performances, first in Little Boy Lost and then The Country Girl for which he was again nominated unsuccessfully for an Academy Award. His film White Christmas was to be a long running success and the 1956 film High Society was to become a classic of its kind. Somewhat reluctantly, Bing had started making television appearances, which were usually filmed in advance. In 1954, his radio show had reduced in status from a major weekly programme to a daily fifteen minute show, but after the success of High Society and hit records such as ‘True Love’ and ‘Around the World’, Bing was tempted to become more heavily involved in television. The big break through came in 1957 with the live, award-winning ‘Edsel Show’. Afterwards, Bing settled into a routine of making at least two TV specials each year.\n\nAfter the death of Dixie Lee, Bing had gone through a lonely spell before being linked with a number of actresses including Grace Kelly, Inger Stevens, Mona Freeman and Kathryn Grant. After a most unusual on-off romance, Bing married Kathryn Grant in 1957. First a son and then, at long last, a daughter were born. Bing admitted that he had found real happiness again. The ‘old’ Bing seemed to re-emerge and entertaining long-playing albums of the time such as ‘Bing With a Beat’ and ‘Fancy Meeting You Here’ appeared to capture this.\n\nBing had safely negotiated some major mid-life challenges.\n\nIn 1950, $100 was worth $525 in 1990 terms.\n\nGo to 195119521953195419551956195719581959\n\n1950\n\nMinute Maid set up a new divisional office in Los Angeles and Bing is named as President of the division.\n\nJan 3 (6:00 to 9:00 p.m.) Bing records two songs in Hollywood with Vic Schoen and his Orchestra.\n\nJan 4/11/18/25 Bing’s Chesterfield shows are broadcast.

In fact, he was probably in constant pain with kidney stone problems. Major surgery\n\nwas necessary in 1962 and in 1963, and even then the problems continued. As always, though, Bing maintained his usual public face and as the years passed his reputation as an elder\n\nstatesman of show business grew. His distinctive speaking voice was often in demand as was his ability as a raconteur. The occasional TV specials continued and drew good audiences. The frequency of Bing’s film work declined, although he enjoyed considerable commercial success with his last ‘Road’ film and some critical acclaim as the drunken doctor in the remake\n\nof ‘Stagecoach’. Recordings became less frequent as well although he did manage to make records each year.\n\nBing gradually reduced his work schedule to about 90 days a year, which gave him plenty of time for his various sporting activities and for his family. He had always felt that he had not given enough time to the children of his first marriage, and he tried to make sure that he did not repeat that mistake with the three children of his second marriage. Whilst his public persona was perpetuated, in his private life it appeared that he had tired of being Bing Crosby and was quietly slipping back into being ordinary Harry Crosby. As a result, it was as hard to track his movements during this period as it was in his early years in Spokane. He travelled constantly and spent much time at his new home in Las Cruces in Baja California.\n\nAfter several years of indifferent health, Bing amazed almost everyone in 1964 when he agreed to appear in a weekly situation comedy series on television. The series was not a success, but Bing then picked up a steady job as one of the regular compéres of the ‘Hollywood Palace’ which gave him very useful exposure. His televised Christmas shows frequently attracted record audiences, but it seemed that Bing was content to gradually fade into retirement. Then in 1974, he became very seriously ill and after a major operation, part of one lung was removed. There were doubts about him ever singing again, and it was probably with some trepidation that he returned to the recording studios to work with British producer Ken Barnes …\n\nEquivalents of $100 in 1990 terms –\n\n1960: $425\n\n1970: $330\n\nGo to 19611962 1963196419651966196719681969197019711972 19731974\n\n1960\n\nJan The winners of the first annual election to the ‘Show Business Hall of Fame’ are Bing and Bob Hope.\n\nJan 10 Bing welcomes Perry Como as he arrives at Los Angeles Airport and drives him to his hotel.\n\nJan 11/12 Tapes ‘The Bing Crosby Show’ with Perry Como.
