        "text": "CHECKMATE!\n\n‘The Prisoner’ is currently being shown on three separate British television channels as of this week (05.08.24); Legend Extra, Rewind TV and London Live. Look out for Peter as Number 2 in ‘Checkmate‘ during the coming weeks.\n\nPETER’S HANDPRINTS IN MELBOURNE’S CITY GALLERY EXHIBITION\n\nWhile Melbourne is a long way away from star-studded Los Angeles, it turns out that our two cities have something in common that not many people know about. Imprinted into the cement footpath of Hollywood Boulevard are countless celebrity handprints – but did you know that Bourke Street had its very own version? If not, now you do.\n\nBut the story behind it isn’t quite as glitzy and glamorous as the action on Hollywood Boulevard – it actually started with a hardware store. Back in the ’70s, a retail chain called McEwans was the go-to shop for Victorians’ DIY needs, before Bunnings swooped in to take over in the 1990s. McEwans had a store on Bourke Street, about a block uphill from the GPO building, but needed some extra publicity to attract shoppers. So what did they do? Following in the (literal) footsteps of Hollywood, they invited celebs to leave handprints and footprints in wet cement out the front of the store.\n\nThe publicity stunt worked a treat, with the lunchtime handprint events attracting visitors and media attention. As well as Peter Wyngarde, other famous names who left their mark included Bert Newton, Lionel Rose, Joan Sutherland, Henry Bolte, Barry Crocker, Colleen Hewett, Jose Feliciano and Evonne Goolagong Cawley, as well as international stars of the day like Sid James, Miriam Karlin and Harry Secombe.\n\nIf you were old enough to remember it (or even alive) back then, you’re one of the lucky few Melburnians to know this rare piece of our city’s history, which lasted from 1972 to 1994. But for the rest of us, the ‘footpath of fame’ is now on display in a new exhibition at the Town Hall’s City Gallery.\n\nGotcha! is a free exhibition open to the public until August 16, curated by Melbourne historian Robyn Annear. It includes 40 of the surviving prints from the McEwans pavement, which are accompanied by stories of the celebrities who made them and newspaper images that capture the mood of the times. To learn more about the exhibition, head to the City of Melbourne website.\n\nClick here to see a PDF of exhibition booklet\n\nICONIC MASK IN AUCTION\n\nThe original mask worn by Peter in the 1980 blockbuster, ‘Flash Gordon’ goes up for sale on Friday 19th July (2024) in Los Angeles.\n\nOne of the most iconic masks in the history of film, it was made in Italy in 1979 from fiberglass and painted in gold with chrome finish. Attached to a poly-blend cowl with beaded gold trim on the hemline.\n\nIt’s expected that the $4,000 – $12,000 estimate will be exceeded by some margin.\n\n‘DEPARTMENT S’ BACK ON TV\n\nRewind – a new satellite channel (Sky 190), is currently screening ‘Department S’, starring Peter as Jason King, Joel Fabiani as Stewart Sullivan and Rosemary Nicols as Annabelle Hurst.\n\nThe Sheffield-based channel has confirmed it’s launch on Sky’s satellite TV on 23rd May (2024), with a appearing on other platform during the coming months.\n\nThe channel promises to offer a range of classic entertainment shows from yesteryear, tapping in to a growing market for screening vintage television from the past century.\n\nRewind’s It’s launch line-up includes late night 1990s comedy from Channel 4, with Drop The Dead Donkey and Clive Anderson’s Whose Line Is It Anyway featuring from 10pm. Earlier in the evening, from 8pm, the channel will screen vintage drama series Return of The Saint and, or course, Department S. And the channel will be screening episodes of the long-running documentary Whicker’s World in its late afternoon schedule.\n\n‘NIGHT OF THE EAGLE’ UK BLURAY & DVD REISSUE\n\nStudiocanal have announced a superb new restoration of Night of the Eagle, as part of the Cult Classics Collection. Dare you believe in the existence of witches in this nerve-shattering, atmospheric horror starring Peter Wyngarde and Janet Blair?\n\nDescribed by The New York Times as “excellently photographed and cunningly directed… a nightmarish hair-curler”, Night of the Eagle is in the same league as classic British chillers including The Haunting, The Innocents and Night of the Demon. As the tagline says, ‘You must watch from the beginning to feel the shock impact of the end!’\n\nThe film is available on BluRay, DVD and Digital from 1st July 2024, with the striking original UK poster artwork featuring on the sleeve. The Blu-ray edition will include four art cards.\n\nExtras:\n\nBurn Witch, Burn: Anna Bogutskaya on Night of the Eagle\n\nArchive Interview with Peter Wyngarde\n\nUS Theatrical Trailer\n\nUK Theatrical Trailer\n\nUS Alternate Opening Credits\n\nAudio Commentary with screenwriter Richard Matheson\n\nBehind the Scenes stills gallery\n\n‘NEW PRISONER NUMBER 2 FIGURE’\n\nWandering Planet Toys are releasing a second wave of their official ‘The Prisoner’ figures, which will include this one of Peter as Number 2 in ‘Checkmate’. The figures launched this month (April 2024) via a kickstarter backer campaign!\n\nWandering Planet Toys is a group of friends working in the arts and entertainment industries in Los Angeles who came together out of a love for movies, cult TV, pop culture, and, of course. The Prisoner figures have been produced with the support of The Unmutual Prisoner website: http://www.theunmutual.co.uk/\n\nIn the memorable episode “Checkmate” featuring the iconic human-chess match, Peter Wyngarde brought a suave and particularly crafty take to his Number 2.

This is because of you. Thank you for joining us and pledging to make these figures… as its been said… It takes a village…\n\nWe’re cruising toward the unlock of some fun Stretch Goal items… we will of course keep you posted about this.\n\nIn the meantime we also wanted to announce that for those of you who may have missed our first Kickstarter Campaign, or for those who would like additional, we have made certain items from our first wave available as ADD ON’s for this campaign.

Wave No2 is happening, and we have all of you to thank for it.\n\nAs we approach the end of the campaign we wanted to offer one more incentive, to spice up your Diorama Display and add even more options for you to display your figures… SO, we came up with a sort of booster pack of mini diorama display pieces to go with the Diorama Display.\n\nThe display is made up of three plastic “floor” tiles, and we have created DIORAMA DISPLAY BONUS BACKDROPS to fit into those tiles. Should this stretch goal be unlocked at 140K all of those going DEGREE ABSOLUTE/ALL IN will automatically have these three additional display backdrops included. And for those who have added the diorama display to their pledges and would like these additional pieces they will be offered as a set for $12.00.\n\nAbove: To the far left – Peter as Number 2 with Patrick McGoohan as Number 6.\n\nFeaturing iconic images from your favorite episodes, these will look sharp on your toy shelf, proudly displaying your figures.

Thank you for your enthusiasm and support! The Prisoner fans are awesome fans!

What exactly constituted “flirting” back in the 1970’s is anyone’s guess. Possibly, males were not expected to make eye contact or even smile at another man in a public convenience at that time. Evidently, the committing of such a ‘crime’ was determined by the arresting police officer. It then became a case of his word against that of the arrested man.\n\nIt is desperately sad that this conviction could not have been disregarded during Peter’s lifetime as, over the ensuing years, it had become a rather nasty stick with which both the press and a misinformed public would use to beat him with for the subsequent 43 years.\n\nThankfully now he can finally rest in peace.\n\nLEGEND RESHOWING ‘THE PRISONER’ IN UK\n\nThe Prisoner is being repeated on Legend (UK only): Sky 148 – Virgin 149 – Freesat 137 – Freeview 41, from Monday, 17th July, 2023.\n\nAbove: Peter as the village administrator, Number 2 in ‘Checkmate’.\n\nLook out for Peter in ‘Checkmate’ which will be shown on Thursday 27th July at 9pm, and again on Friday 28th at 9am.\n\nMORRISSEY TRIBUTE\n\nRock singer, Morrissey, paid tribute to his friend, Peter Wyngarde, during his European tour (2023) by wearing a T-shirt on stage with an image of Peter on the front.\n\nThe two men had been good friends for many years, and Morrissey mentions Peter in his 2013 autobiography.

The site considered a list of 210 movies tagged “horror” on Rotten Tomatoes, filtered for those with at least a 60% audience score, then used Google Trends to compare searches for each movie by subregion between September 2017 and September 2022. Where many films were most popular in the same state, states were matched with the film with the most proportional popularity for that state.\n\nAccording to the survey, the most popular Halloween movies range greatly not only in theme but also in period. Residents of some states prefer the old classics, such as the 1925 version of “The Phantom of the Opera” or “Freaks” from 1932. Others have more modern tastes, favoring movies released in the last year or two, such as “Vengeance” (2022) or “Candyman” (2021). Hawaii, it transpires, has the best taste, choosing ‘The Innocents’\n\nHawaii: The Innocents (1961)\n\n> Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer score: 95%\n\n> Rotten Tomatoes audience score: 86%\n\n> Directed by: Jack Clayton\n\n> Main cast: Deborah Kerr, Peter Wyngarde, Megs Jenkins\n\n> Rank on Rotten Tomatoes Top Halloween Movies list: 41/210\n\nSPECIAL SCREENING OF ‘THE INNOCENTS’ IN AUSTIN, TEXAS\n\nAFS Cinema (Austin Film Society) – 6406 N.

One of the more iconic episodes, Episode 9 sees the prisoners and guards playing life-size chess decades before Harry Potter ever did (then again, if the set has a giant chessboard, it was inevitable at some point people are going to need to play chess).”\n\nSciFiNow has also rated ‘The Innocents’ No.3 in their ‘Top 10 Must See Film of All Time’: “Another haunted house story, The Innocents follows governess Miss Giddens and her downwards spiral into paranoia when she takes a job at Bly country estate, looking after a young pair of siblings. It starts off quite sweetly, with Miss Giddens being taken by Miles and Flora’s charismatic ways, but once she learns that their previous governess, Mary Jessel, died under mysterious circumstances, things go from idyllic to nightmarish. Like The Haunting, The Innocents doesn’t care for jump scares, but it will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.”\n\nPETER’S PORTRAYAL OF PETER QUINT VOTED ONE OF CINEMA’S SCARIEST ‘LIVING DEAD’\n\n“When I first saw it as a kid, I loved Jack Clayton’s spooky 1961 ghost movie The Innocents, adapted by Truman Capote and William Archibald from Henry James’ novel The Turn of the Screw.[1]Admittedly, The Innocents is the kind of movie that could have turned this Catholic school student into a remorseless serial killer – what with child sexuality (young siblings Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin); incest (that’s Stephens and Franklin again); repressed female libido (prim and proper Christian governess, Deborah Kerr; unprim, unproper, and unChristian sex fantasies (that’s Kerr again); and a highly eroticized male ghost (Peter Wyngarde) who possesses the little boy, turning him into a sex animal.\n\nAbove: Peter Wyngarde in ‘The Innocents’: Repressed sex and the single living dead – a ghost who believes that youthful Martin Stephens would be a good receptacle for his sexually charged spirit.\n\nLuckily, The Innocents failed to lead me astray, for my vulnerable youthful psyche had already been debased by another 1960s repressed sex/unrepressed ghost tale, Robert Wise’s The Haunting (1963).\n\nSo, instead of becoming a pathological ax-wielding murderer, I merely developed a pathological fear of the dark that haunts me to this day. Thank you, Peter Wyngarde.Wyngarde, by the way, would become well known for two television series in which he played bestselling author turned sleuth Jason King: Department S (1969–1970) and Jason King (1971–1972). In 1998, he rereleased his 1970 music album Peter Wyngarde, now retitled When Sex Leers Its Inquisitive Head. A.V. Club’s Keith Phipps wrote in 2002: “In the world of music esoterica, there’s the bizarre and there’s the utterly inexplicable. Peter Wyngarde’s When Sex Leers Its Inquisitive Head … falls into the latter category.”That also sums up much of what goes on in the brilliant The Innocents.” Andre Soares.\n\nHALLOWEEN SCREENINGS OF NIGHT OF THE EAGLE\n\nDepartment S & Night of the Eagle 1962 Find out about the flamboyant actor Peter Wyngarde with an episode of the Spy-fi series ‘Department S’.

Then in 1991, the early seeds of The Prince Charles Cinema were planted and from there this mighty little cine-behemoth began to grow.

Flash Gordon’s “moderate violence, language, sex references and discriminatory stereotypes” were cited, along with domestic abuse in Rocky. The BBFC reviews its classifications every four to five years.\n\nBBFC chief executive David Austin said in the body’s annual report: “We talk to over 10,000 people every four-five years… to ensure our policies remain in step with parental expectations and societal standards on an ongoing basis.\n\n“As a result of changing standards in society, it’s not infrequent that a distributor will submit something to us that we have classified in the past, but which we need to take a fresh look at under our current guidelines.”\n\nThe PG rating says a film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or older while 12A recommends children under 12 shouldn’t watch without being accompanied by an adult.\n\nOf the 93 complaints the board received last year, 27 were about 1980 space opera film Flash Gordon.\n\nThe movie’s 40th anniversary re-release was reclassified up to 12A partly due to the inclusion of “discriminatory stereotypes”.\n\nThe BBFC did not say what the stereotypes were. However Flash Gordon’s main villain, Ming the Merciless, was of East Asian appearance but played by Swedish-French actor Max von Sydow.\n\n‘A CELEBRATION OF ITC’\n\nIn November 2018, a special celebration of the unforgettable shows of ITC took place at Elstree Studios. Stars of the screen Ian Ogilvy, Jenny Hanley, Madeline Smith, Annette Andre, Shane Rimmer (his last public appearance), Prentis Hancock, and Georgina Moon were joined by stuntman Paul Weston, director John Hough, crew members Tony Sloman and Derek Wells, and Jamie (son of Gerry) Anderson, for a great evening of chat!\n\nHosted by Rick Davy, with an introduction from Elstree Studio chairman Morris Bright MBE.\n\nThe DVD includes highlights from all the on-stage Q&A sessions, with all guests included.

The comments increased pressure on show bosses to axe him following anger at previous tweets — including one claim about the Manchester Arena bombing which triggered a falling out with pro-partner Robin Johnstone. Fed-up producers are even preparing TV and radio presenter Matt Richardson, 29, as his replacement.\n\nLast night Hound, who missed last weekend’s show and will be absent tonight, tweeted: “I’ve had Covid. Isolated when I knew I’d come into contact with it, tested five days later, am coming to the end of having had it, luckily v mild case.” His rape blunder came in a podcast in which he talked about TV actor Peter Wyngarde’s banned[1] 1970 record, titled When Sex Leers Its Inquisitive Head[2].\n\nWyngarde, who died in 2018 aged 90, played sleuth Jason King, said to be an inspiration for Mike Myers’ Austin Powers character. The album featured a song called ‘Rape’, in which Wyngarde babbled about how sex attacks differ from country to country. The tasteless lyrics include: “Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape! It’s utterly amazing how many different kinds of rape there are!” He goes on: “There’s Italian Rape . . . Look into my eye-a-balls, you will see the fire! “Japanese Rape, of course! In France of course, where fun is greedy, The women are a little more seedy, And rape is hardly ever necessary.\n\nHound said: “Have you heard his album? Oh my s! “It starts with literally a seduction. “And one track, I s*** you not, is his take on how rape works in different countries, doing the different ’70s racist accents of the people committing the rape. “It sounds like I must be making it up in order to make it weirder for you to struggle to make you believe.“It absolutely genuinely exists — and I urge you all to buy it.”\n\nLeft: ‘Rape’ was also released as a single.\n\nHe also joked to comedian Richard Herring on his Leicester Square Theatre Podcast that Hitler killed millions of Jews “as a bet”. At one point he declared: “I’ve just thought of the most racist joke”– prompting host Herring to tell him: “Keep that to yourself.” The Sun on Sunday has already told how Hound, 41, had used terms such as “retard” and “gay lord” in tweets. And we told how another he posted suggested then – PM Theresa May orchestrated the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing to help win the Election.\n\n“In Germany it isn’t always remembered, The rape is synonymous with whips, bunkers and Mauser, Which makes it all comparatively kinky.” He then makes a sick reference to the Holocaust. Critics have called it one of the most disturbingly racist recordings ever made.\n\nINFINITY MAGAZINE – ISSUE 32:\n\nThe latest issue of Infinity magazine hit the shops on 7th January (UK only) – featuring a lengthy article on the ‘Jason King’ series.

UK film censors have added a warning about racial stereotypes to Flash Gordon, saying the character of Ming the Merciless is “dubious, if not outright offensive”.\n\nAbove: Peter as General Klytus with Max Von Sydow as Ming the Merciless\n\nThe British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) said it now has to bear in mind discriminatory depictions that are “no longer acceptable to modern audiences” when older films come in for reclassification. Ming was “coded as an East Asian character due to his hair and make-up” in the 1980 film but was played by the late Swedish actor Max von Sydow, BBFC senior policy officer Matt Tindall spoke about the issue in a podcast looking back at the year in film.\n\n“Flash’s arch nemesis, Ming the Merciless, is sort of coded as an East Asian character due to his hair and make-up,” he said. “But he’s played by a Swedish actor in the film, he’s played by Max von Sydow, which I don’t think is something that would happen if this were a modern production.”\n\nMr Tindall said the BBFC was aware this is something that viewers “may find dubious, if not outright offensive”.\n\nHe continued: “Let’s just say that attitudes towards the acceptability of discriminatory racial stereotypes have moved on considerably since then and rightly so, of course.”\n\nThe organisation has reclassified Flash Gordon as a 12A – stricter than its original A rating, which is roughly equivalent to a PG today – due to scenes of violence “that go beyond what you’d expect in the lower category”, “moderate bad language” and “some verbal sex references” that exceed PG level.\n\nMr Tindall said the presentation of Ming in the film is not a “category defining issue” but that the organisation had added a warning due to the “potential it has to cause offence”.\n\nHe said: “This is something that we have to bear in mind often when we see older films coming in for reclassification, films that might contain discriminatory depictions or stereotypes that are not acceptable to modern audiences, including films where discrimination wasn’t the work’s intent, just a reflection of the period in which it was made.\n\n“And this is an issue that we’re currently planning to explore more through research next year.”\n\nEarlier this year, the 1939 American Civil War epic, Gone With The Wind was temporarily removed by US streaming service HBO Max, later returning with a warning over its “racist depictions” that were “wrong then and are wrong today”.\n\nIn the UK, comedy show Little Britain was removed from some streaming services over the use of blackface in some of its sketches.\n\n‘FLASH GORDON: THE OFFICIAL STORY OF THE FILM’ OUT NOW!\n\nProduct Details\n\nAuthor: John Walsh\n\nHardcover : 192 pages\n\nISBN-10 : 1789095069\n\nISBN-13 : 978-1789095067\n\nDimensions : 26.11 x 2.16 x 33.15 cm\n\nPublisher : Titan Books (27 Nov. 2020)\n\nLanguage: : English\n\nIf I could give this book more than 5 Stars I would.\n\nIt is a masterpiece and a must, not only for Flash fans, but for Sci-Fi purists and general film buffs alike.

And if you don’t mind, I’ve got the grandchildren here, would you mind saying ‘Gordon’s alive’?”\n\nIt is unclear when the Queen made the reported disclosure, but she did appoint Blessed an OBE for services to arts and charity in 2016 .\n\nFLASH GORDON BACK IN CINEMAS\n\nFlash Gordon is now confirmed to play at Picturehouse Central and in select cinemas from July 31st, it will then be released on 4K UHD Collector’s edition, Blu-ray, Steelbook, DVD and digital on August 10th.

Over 500 hours of manual restoration repaired serious damage that included image instability, scratches and intermittent flicker. The sound was scanned from the original track negative and underwent restoration to improve issues ranging from audio drop-outs throughout the feature and during reel changes, digital clicks and optical distortion. The film was colour graded for theatrical, home entertainment and 4K HDR release, using previous digital releases and 35mm prints as a reference. In line with the Director’s vision and the original 35mm cinema release, VFX work was applied to remove the strings in all scenes where visible. This restoration was approved by Director Mike Hodges in May 2020, and will include the first 4K HDR Dolby Vision master of Flash Gordon.”\n\nWhat’s more, a five-disc Ultra HD version is set to be available too, and there’s a hefty list of extra features across the various versions of the film.\n\nThe UHD, DVD and Blu-Ray Disc 1 includes:\n\nThe main feature (1 hr 47)\n\nNew Lost in Space: Nic Roeg’s Flash Gordon (also iTunes extra)\n\nAudio commentary with Mike Hodges\n\nAudio commentary with Brian Blessed\n\nBehind the scenes of Flash Gordon\n\nStills gallery (also iTunes extra)\n\nStoryboards gallery (also iTunes extra)\n\nOriginal theatrical trailer\n\nBlu-Ray Disc 2 includes:\n\nInterview with Mike Hodges\n\nInterview with comic book artist Alex Ross TBC\n\nInterview with screenwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. TBC\n\nEpisode 24 of Flash Gordon (1979-1982): The Survival Game / Gremlin’s Finest Hour\n\nSam Jones’s acting start\n\nEntertainment Earth on Flash Gordon merchandise\n\nBob Lindenmayer discusses deleted scenes and original endings\n\n35thAnniversary Greenroom\n\n35thAnniversary reunion featurette\n\nRenato Casaro extended interview\n\nBrian Blessed anecdotes\n\nMelody’s musings\n\nOn the soundtrack (Brian May & Howard Blake)\n\nEaster Eggs\n\nThe 5 disc Collector’s Edition includes:\n\nThe UHD and 2 Blu-ray discs\n\nBonus Blu-Ray Disc of LIFE AFTER FLASH, the 2017 feature documentary celebrating the film and it’s star, directed by Lisa Downs\n\nOriginal soundtrack by Queen & Howard Blake\n\n32 page booklet\n\n16 page Titan mini book (The Story of Flash Gordon)\n\nReproduced booklet of the first strip of original comic books\n\nPoster of original artwork\n\n4 artcards of various incarnations of Flash film posters across the years\n\n1 sew on ‘Flash patch’\n\nAll versions of the film will be available on August 10th, 2020.\n\nWatch the trailer here\n\nFLASH GORDON: THE OFFICIAL STORY OF THE FILM\n\nAs previously mentioned on this page, Filmmaker and Author, John Walsh, is currently working on a new book which will be the official story of the 1980 Sci-Fi classic, ‘Flash Gordon’ which, it’s hoped, will be published later this year.For anyone interested, he has set up a Facebook page dedicated to the project which can be hound here: https://www.facebook.com/FlashGordonOfficialStoryOfTheFilm/\n\nRRP £35.00\n\nPublication date: October 27th, 2020\n\n13 EPISODES OF ‘JASON KING’ DUBBED INTO GERMAN\n\nHe is extravagant, cheeky and an absolute womanizer: Jason King.

Directed by Mike Hodges and produced by Dino De Laurentiis, the film starred Peter Wyngarde, Sam J. Jones, Melody Anderson, Topol, Max von Sydow, Timothy Dalton, Brian Blessed and Ornella Muti.\n\nWith a camp style similar to the 1960s TV series Batman, in an attempt to appeal to fans of the original comics and serial films. The film is notable for its soundtrack composed, performed and produced by the rock band Queen. The film has since gained a significant cult following.\n\n© Copyright The Hellfire Club: The OFFICIAL PETER WYNGARDE Appreciation Society: https://www.facebook.com/groups/813997125389790/\n\nWords from the heart by Peter’s fans and admirers\n\nI made my own tribute to Peter using archive interviews, clips, trailers, Soundtracks and music from the Films & TV show he’s appeared in. Tony Richards\n\nFor me, Peter Wyngarde was a true star, personifying originality, style and class. He was evocative of an era when stars were people that you looked up to because they possessed special talent, and Peter had that in abundance.\n\nIf I may explain, I have been a long-time admirer of Peter since he first came to my attention through his portrayal of Jason King when I was a teenager in the late 60s and early 70s. In those days of black and white television, and long before the digital versatile disc, his impact upon me was through his celebrity status. All these years later, whilst his celebrity remains firmly intact, I am beginning to truly appreciate the depth of his artistic attributes. Peter’s appeal is inter-generational. My son Lee was born in the post-Jason King 80s yet he shares my admiration. We are still learning about Peter’s illustrious career and this article, which focuses mainly on Department S, is an affectionate tribute from two of his fans. We both regard him as one of the country’s foremost acting talents and a captivating personality.\n\nIn Department S Peter was quite simply THE Star. His distinctive characteristics produced a riveting screen presence, and he dominated the scenes in which he appeared. Peter’s star quality was precisely what differentiated Department S from its contemporaries. In today’s world, where there may be a reticence to recognise genuine stars, I find it instructive to paraphrase Sir Noel Coward on stardom, “… if you’ve worked all those years to become a big star it’s really rather silly to pretend that you are not one” and “…the stage is a place for extraordinary people – not a series of ordinary people”. In the nicest possible way, I feel that these quotations from one of the theatre’s most revered figures serve to endorse Peter’s star status, which he earned through his individuality and peerless talent. This individuality was perfectly illustrated by Peter’s defining performances throughout the Department S run, during which time it became one of the most popular programmes on television.\n\nIn the episode “Soup of The Day” Peter’s tongue-in cheek-humour is evident when Jason tries to initiate a romantic liaison with a lady secretary (Isobel Black) who counters his suggestion by stating that her mother will be chaperoning her that evening. Jason’s retort is to advise her that as his mother is chaperoning him, two chaperoning mothers might become rather confusing! The comic timing and delivery is superb.\n\nIn “The Man from X” Peter’s talent for characterization is showcased when Jason impersonates a New York safe cracker complete with an accent and mannerisms that seem much more authentic than those of the actual New Yorkers we have encountered in the Big Apple.\n\nIn “One of our Aircraft is Empty” Peter’s gift for understated witticism is revealed in an early scene when his colleague Stewart Sullivan (Joel Fabiani) is unimpressed with Jason’s innovative explanation of mysterious events. Jason’s riposte is devastating “…Stewart, when you find that my idea works – a postcard will do!\n\n”In “The Bones of Byrom Blain” Peter effortlessly projects Jason’s bon vivant lifestyle when ordering lunch in a stylish restaurant. The waiter suggests a fish dish as an entrée and Jason elegantly corrects his culinary faux pas with “… yes quite excellent I am sure, but perhaps for the main challenge a venison D’Artagnan with a Volney ’64?” This authoritative panache underscores Jason’s mastery of all social situations and his love of high living. Throughout the episodes of Department S Peter’s stunningly original interpretation of Jason King provides the central theme of the plot lines. Peter simply takes the viewer on an exciting journey every time he appears on screen and never disappoints.\n\nPeter’s consummate versatility as a performer is perfectly illustrated in his portrayal of Baron Gruener in the 1964 production of the Sherlock Holmes story “The Illustrious Client”. This role is the antithesis of Jason King and Peter projects the Baron’s menace with exquisite finesse. Two scenes stand out. Firstly, when the Baron rebukes his fiancée (Jennie Linden) for entering a certain room in his home without his permission he exudes a power and authority which seem absolute. Secondly, when the Baron warns Sherlock Holmes (Douglas Wilmer) of the dangerous consequences of crossing him, there is a palpable sense of the steel fist being barely concealed within the velvet glove. Peter’s incarnation of the Baron could not be further away from the urbanity of Jason King and is a flawless demonstration of his superlative performance range.\n\nThe extent of Peter’s continuing influence was confirmed when Mike Myers based Austin Powers on a combination of Jason King and James Bond. Peter’s portrayal of Jason provided a key inspiration, particularly in the sartorial department. This is a cinematic homage indeed and may have prompted Jason to state “…remind me to sue for copyright”! Continuing on the theme of James Bond, if ever there was a role that was tailor made for Peter then surely that was 007 himself. Ian Fleming’s original depiction of the Bond character combined a world weary, cynical toughness with glamour and sophistication. I feel that Peter would have been perfect for the screen role, combining the charm and wit of Roger Moore and the ruthless edge of Sean Connery. Whilst the Bond movies have been hugely successful with great actors in the role, I still find it fascinating to speculate on what might have been!\n\nThe decade that followed Department S was the golden age of television drama and produced many fine actors. Edward Woodward, Bernard Hepton, Peter Barkworth, James Maxwell and T.P. McKenna are particular favourites of mine. Peter rightfully takes his place amongst this stellar cast list and, for me, is elevated to singular status because his on screen persona makes you feel better about life. As Jason King, he is upbeat, positive and avant garde in his pleasure seeking – someone who is indisputably unburdened with the travails of the ordinary world. Peter’s appeal continues to transcend generations and ephemeral trends. Thank you Peter and long may your star shine with dazzling intensity.\n\nBy Neil Haddow and Lee Haddow – Glasgow\n\nWhen looking at cult icons there are not many who can lay claim to going toe-to-toe with Dick Barton, Alexander the Great, Ben Gunn, Sherlock Holmes, The Baron, The Avengers, The Saint, The Prisoner, The Champions, Flash Gordon, Doctor Who and The Two Ronnies! Peter Wyngarde is a man who can and when he did, he did it in great style!\n\nThe enigmatic Peter Wyngarde transcended every screen and stage he appeared on and as people clambered to find out more about him the mystery of the man grew deeper! As Jason King, Wyngarde captured the souls of a generation. This role which began in the television series “Department S” and later in its spin-off “Jason King” remains as relevant today as it did back in 1969. What makes it even more interesting was Wyngarde revealed to CultFaction.com back in August 2017 that he “didn’t want to commit to a series, but they wore me down and I ended up signing on the dotted line. Actually, it was on a napkin in a restaurant.” It was the guarantee of “carte blanche” to do whatever he liked with the role that lead Wyngarde to developing a character that can comfortably stand next to James Bond, The Saint, The Beatles, and The Avengers in the tapestry of British iconography.\n\nHow far does this influence spread? Well between 1976 and 1979, The Bullet comic – ran a story called “Fireball” where its hero looked a lot like Peter Wyngarde; as did John Byrne’s comic book character Jason Wyngarde (big clue in the name!), leader of The Hell Fire Club in The Uncanny X-Men. Even in recent years, it is clear to see that the character of Mr. Six in Grant Morrison’s The Invisibles is heavily based on Jason King. When asked about the influence King had Wyngarde humbly responded “I just believe he was the right character at the right time. I guess he just brought some colour into people’s lives.”\n\nWyngarde was more than just Jason King though, his turn as John Cartney in The Avengers “A Touch of Brimstone” episode remains one of the shows most discussed episodes, as did his role as Number 2 in The Prisoner episode “Checkmate.” Wyngarde was a man who could make the most out of any role he was given and had the ability to snatch a scene from under the show’s regular stars. It was in fact the challenges he placed on himself as a character actor that led him to taking the role of Klytus in Flash Gordon as he “felt it would be a new challenge in projecting a character from behind a mask,” and project he did.\n\nThe contribution Peter Wyngarde made to popular culture is unquestionable (I haven’t even touched on his music career) and his influences lives on today. Michael Myers has stated on record that without Peter Wyngarde there would be no Austin Powers and his name remains a cool name to drop into conversation be it the Harry Enfield comedy sketch “The Playboys” or Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace noting that Wyngarde “had it all” – the fact remains like all good artists, Wyngarde’s work will be rediscovered and enjoyed for generations to come.\n\nThank you Peter.\n\nBy Brett Summers – The Cult Faction: https://cultfaction.com/\n\nThe Hellfire Club: The OFFICIAL PETER WYNGARDE Appreciation Society: https://www.facebook.com/groups/813997125389790/\n\nBroadcast: Wednesday, 20th March 1957\n\nCharacter: Hovstad\n\nThe story is set in Norway.\n\nAct I: Dr Stockmann’s Living Room.\n\nAct II: Dr. Stockmann’s Living Room.\n\nAct III: The Editorial Office of ‘The People’s Herald’.\n\nAct IV: Large hall at Captain Horster’s house\n\nAct V: Dr Stockmann’s Study.\n\nBackground\n\nOne of the greatest writers of the 19th Century – Henrik Ibsen, provided a tense story for Granada’s Play of the Week on 20th March, 1957.\n\nThis play was of enormous interest because it had been adapted by one of America’s foremost dramatists – Arthur Miller. Granada couldn’t have chosen a more dramatic moment to present Miller’s version of this great work, because it concerned a man’s fight for what he believes to be right.\n\nMiller himself was a champion of what he believed to be right, having refused to reveal the names of fellow writers who took part in extreme Left Wing activities in the late 1940’s, even though this denial brought him before a Congressional Committee and led to him facing trial on charges of contempt of Congress.\n\nNo dramatist was more in harmony with Ibsen than Miller. His work on ‘Enemy of the People’ revealed his understanding of the formers mind and of his craft.\n\nMiller, who was once married to Marilyn Monroe, had written many famous plays, including ‘Death of a Salesman’ and ‘All My Sons’. His thesis of the latter of these works was similar to that of ‘Enemy of the People’. The message implicit in both these plays is that a man’s social responsibilities are above self-interest: he should champion what he believes is right even though it may bring disaster to himself and to his family.\n\nMiller’s adaptation altered nothing of the essence of ‘Enemy of the People’. The great play was there with all its warmth of feeling, its humour and its depth. Though the characters express themselves differently (Miller had substituted language of the 1880’s with that of the 1950’s), the meaning of their words were not altered but sharpened. Every word landed a punch.\n\nThe principal character is Dr Stockmann – general practitioner of a small town, who discovers bacteria infecting the water supplying a newly-opened health spa. He warns the leading men of the town, who refuse to believe him. When he’s inevitably proved to be correct, he exclaims: “Now they’re going to get it with both barrels!”\n\nIbsen was the first dramatist to make his characters behave as they would in real life, his language would be probably be far more choice!\n\nIbsen wrote ‘An Enemy of the people’ in 1882 as a fighting reply to the abuse hurled at him after the publication of ‘Ghosts’ a year earlier. When he was reviled by the public, the press and the intellectuals, he promptly sat down to satirise, in ‘Enemy of the People’: the crassness, hypocrisy and stupidity of the “compact majority”.\n\nDr Stockmann is an irrepressible character; optimistic, fiery and with his own sly humour. “Well, it shows you, that’s all,” he comments on his return from a public meeting with his clothes torn. “A man who goes out to fight for the truth should never wear his best suit.”\n\nStockmann is a typical; “agitator” to be found in every community, and ‘An Enemy of the People’ was full of fun – one of the most exuberant plays Ibsen ever wrote.\n\n“I am descended from peasants and believe in my people!” Hovstad\n\nThe Story\n\nThe play opens in Dr Stockmann’s (John Robinson) living room, where his wife (Jessica Spencer), is welcoming Mr Billing (Tom Criddle) who’s been invited to dinner. No sooner has this gentleman taken his seat at the table when there’s a knock at the door. When Mrs Stockmann answers it, she finds Hovstad (Peter Wyngarde) – Editor of the local left-wing newspaper, ‘The People’s Herald’, standing outside.\n\nMoments after Hovstad’s arrival, there’s a second knock at the door. This time it’s her brother-in-law, Peter Stockmann (Clive Morten) – the town’s Mayor. Hovstad and the Mayor greet each other rigidly, and then begin to discuss the building of the new public baths, which both agree are an excellent addition to the town. However, when Hovstad announces that the baths had originally been Dr Stockmann’s idea, the Mayor appears annoyed.\n\nJust as the Newspaper man takes his seat at the dinner table, the Doctor arrives home, bringing with him his two sons, Eilif (Brian Franklin) and Morten (Anthony Wilson), along with Captain Horster (Edward Forsyth). It’s clear from the off that the Doctor and his brother – the Mayor, are not on the best of terms, since the GP snappily counters each and all of his brother’s observation and opinions, and routinely talks over him.\n\nNevertheless, the Mayor asks his brother what he thinks of an article he’d penned about the new baths for Hovstad’s ’paper. The Doctor replies cryptically that he hopes the piece won’t be printed immediately, as it might turn out to be unfitting. The Mayor becomes agitated at this, since the Doctor plainly doesn’t wish to enlighten him any further on this point. With Stockmann remaining tight-lipped, the Mayor decides to leave.\n\nThe following day, Hovstad and his colleague, Billing, plus Horster and Mrs Stockmann meet at the latter’s home for a chat over a drink and a cigarette. The Editor brings up the difficult relationship between the Mayor and his ‘paper. But before a heated exchange ignites between the two men, the Captain interjects – announcing that he himself is due to sail to America soon. Hovstad and Billing are both stunned to hear this, and remind the sailor that he’d be missing an important election that’s scheduled to take place in the town later that month.\n\nMomentarily, Petra (Jill Dixon) – Dr Stockmann’s daughter and the night school teacher, arrives with a letter for her father, which he’d clearly been eagerly awaiting. He takes the letter with him to his study where it’s read. When he reemerges, Stockmann announces that he’d recently taken samples of the water at the new public baths which he’d subsequently sent to a lab. The result of the tests he’d carried out were contained in the envelope brought by his daughter. The water, he declares, is dangerously polluted.\n\nThe Doctor goes on to tell the gathering that contaminated water from local industries has been seeping into the bath’s pump room, and that if the town’s hierarchy had listened to his advice about the drainage system in the first place, this problem would’ve been avoided.\n\nThose around the table are full of admiration for the Doctor’s prompt action, and praise him for saving the town. The predicament, he maintains, can easily be rectified.\n\nA few days later, Mrs Stockmann hands her husband a newly delivered letter, which is a response from the Mayor to the report from the lab. His reply curtly states that he will speak with Stockmann about it at a later date.\n\nSome days later, the Mayor calls on his brother for the sole purpose, it transpires, of sniggering at the Doctor’s findings – saying that the Town Council would be mad if they were to believe it. Just then Hovstad arrives, and tells the Doctor that he hopes to publish an article about his findings in ‘The People’s Herald’, which he hopes will kindle a campaign against the town’s right-wing leadership since the real contamination, he says, comes from them.\n\nWhilst the Doctor agrees that Right-Wing ideology is not the way forward, he’s still somewhat reluctant to start a concentrated assault on the Town Council which, after all, is led by his own brother.\n\nAslaksen (John Salew), a friend of the Stockmann’s and Chairman of the influential Homeowner’s Association, arrives to offer his support to the Doctor. He suggests that he should organize a peaceful demonstration in an effort to exert pressure on the Council to resolve the issue. The Doctor, however, doesn’t believe that such a protest is necessary, as he’s certain that he can persuade the baths’ Board of Directors to take the required action.\n\nWhen Aslaksen’s departs, Hovstad, who’d been listening intently to the other men’s conversation, dubs the Doctor a weakling for his lack of desire to take on the Council, but Stockmann insists that if the Mayor fails to act with regard to town’s water system, then Hovstad would be welcome to publish the whole of the laboratory’s report in his ‘paper.\n\nIn the Editorial Office of ‘The People’s Herald’ the following afternoon, Hovstad is writing at his desk when Billing arrives with a copy of Dr Stockmann’s findings. The two men deliberate over the persuasiveness of the report, and how they might use it to confront the Council. Hovstad is convinced that if the Doctor’s pitch is officially recognised, then the Mayor would inevitably be confronted by those who invested in the baths and the powerful Homeowners Association.\n\nAt this point Stockmann turns up to disclose to the newspaper men the details concerning the row he’d had with his brother. The three of them agree that this scandal could well result in the downfall of the Council and its leader. When Aslaksen also appears, they each inn turn guarantee the GP that both the left-wing activists of the town, and the regular man on the street, will all back him. Secretly, both Hovstad and Aslaksen agree that the Doctor will be very useful to both of them, even if for different reasons.\n\nWhen Aslaksen vacates the office, Hovstad and Billing – the latter of whom, it emerges, is standing for public office himself (if only to annoy the establishment!), converse about how much they’d like to be rid of him. Unfortunately, they have to rely on him and the powerful Homeowner’s Association whose money enables them to publish their newspaper. They then consider the possibility of the Doctor providing them with financial support.\n\nAs Billing leaves, Petra arrives to translate an English news item for the paper, but on reading it she immediately changes her mind – saying that the content is in direct opposition to everything that she and the ‘paper stands for. Hovstad explains that he thought the piece, which is about how higher ideas (or ‘Free Thinking’) can help guide a person’s actions, would help keep their less gifted readers happy.\n\nAlthough Petra might expect this kind of low calculating from Hovstad, she’s surprised at Billing, with whom she’s involved with romantically. Whilst she still refuses to translate the article, she thanks the Editor for his support of her father.\n\nTo Hovstad’s astonishment, the Mayor now arrives and remarks on what a marvelous set-up the young Editor has. He begins by talking about his brother’s proposition for the baths, to which Hovstad claims to have no knowledge. That’s until the visitor notices a copy of the Doctor’s report lying on the desk.\n\nThe Mayor continues by warning Hovstad that, if Stockmann’s proposals are accepted by the Council, it could prove disastrous for the town. The baths, he explains, would have to close for upwards of two years, and that the costs for all the work would have to come from a civic loan.\n\nOn hearing this, both Hovstad and Billin begin to have second thoughts about backing the Doctor who, at that very moment, is seen walking towards the office. Given that he doesn’t wish to be seen fraternising with newspaper men, the Mayor hides from his brother in an adjoining room.\n\nStockmann wishes to see the first draft of the article about his findings, but Hovstad tells him that it’s not as yet been prepared. While the cheery medic interprets the two journalists caginess as a sign that they might be planning some festivities in his honour, Hovstad attempts to convey how things actually stand.\n\nJust then Mrs Stockmann charges into the office, where she begs her husband not to risk everything by publishing his article. The Doctor smiles and calmly reassures her that he’ll soon have the majority of the townsfolk behind him. He then notices the Mayors traditional hat and cane lying on a chair, and deduces that his brother must be in the office somewhere. He puts the hat on and begins impersonating his sibling, until the Mayor can stand the insult no longer, and shows himself in the doorway of the adjoining room.\n\nSeveral days later, a large room at Captain Horster’s house is full to the rafters with people from the town. Mr Billing has been sent to report on the meeting, whilst Horster is there with Mrs Stockmann and her children.\n\nMeanwhile, Hovstad, Aslaksen and the Mayor arrive and take their places. They’re followed in short order by Dr Stockmann, who’s greeted with a mixture of applause and cat-calls from the assembled crowd.\n\nThe Mayor immediately prevents his brother from addressing the gathering with his report or, indeed, from mentioning the baths at all. Whilst he and Aslaksen work in tandem to influence the people in thinking that the Doctor is merely attempting to damage the interests of the town, Hovstad asserts that his sole concern is for the Doctor and his dependents. A recommendation is passed that the Stockmann’s case should be dismissed.\n\nThe Medic is plainly angry at the betrayal of those who’d sworn to support him. The final straw comes when a drunk (Reginald Marsh) staggers into the meeting room just as the Doctor is about to speak, and demands his right to be heard. Whilst the interloper is quickly dispensed with, Stockmann reminds those assembled that it was initially his idea to build the baths, and that he only ever wanted those facilities to be beneficial to the people of the town.\n\nAlthough Aslaksen attempts to quiet him, the Medic’s parting shot is aimed at the Council, his says that he hadn’t bargained for the immense foolishness of those in power. In this he means the disappointing behaviour of his own brother. But, he adds, they’re not the party most guilty of stupidity. The people themselves must shoulder most of the blame for allowing the power of the majority to lie in the hands of the minority.\n\nHe now rounds on Hovstad and asks if, as a supposed ‘Freethinker’ himself, if he would agree with him. The Editor replies that, nowhere has it ever been said in print that he’s a “Freethinker” adding that, no, he does not agree with Stockmann’s foolish statement. “I am descended from peasants and believe in my people”, the newspaperman retorts.\n\nUndeterred, Stockmann asserts that if the Peoples Herald refuses to publish his report, he will find a newspaper in another town that will.\n\nWith this, Hovstad stands and accuses Stockmann of being “An Enemy of the People”. In his agitated state, the Doctor agrees – stating that he’d be happy to remain so as long as he knows that what he’s doing is right. Meanwhile, as Aslaksen collects the ballot papers from the assembled crowd, Billing tells several of the locals that the Doctor is, in fact, a heavy drinker, and as a result, had recently been deprived of a raise in his salary by the Council.\n\nWhen Aslaksen announces the result of the vote, and Stockmann is affirmed ‘An Enemy of the People’, he leaves with his family – the sound of the masses chanting “Enemy!” ringing in his ears.\n\nThe morning after the meeting, Dr Stockmann is found picking up the stones that had broken every window of his study the evening before. To add insult to injury, the landlord arrives thereafter to serve the family with notice of their impending eviction. In spite of this downturn in his fortunes, the Doctor remains optimistic now that he’s decided to leave for America with his family on Captain Horster’s next boat, where they’re to start a new life.\n\nHis wife is not quite so sure about the plan – proposing that a move to another town in Norway would be more prudent, but the Doctor is resolute; the people will be the same wherever they go in their own country, he maintains. At least in America things might be different.\n\nThe Doctor feels wholly justified in planning the family’s relocation when Petra arrives home to tell her parents that she’s been dismissed from her job after her boss was intimidated for employing her.\n\nWhen Horster arrives, however, the Doctor’s fervor is dealt a blow on learning that the Captain has also lost his position – having been dismissed by the ship’s owner for his continued support of the Stockmann’s.\n\nHot on Horster’s tail is the Mayor, who arrives at his brother’s home to announce that the Doctor has been removed from his position as Medical Officer at the baths, and to request that he leaves town for six months or so. If, after that time, he’s willing to freely withdraw his testimony regarding the polluted water, then the Council would consider giving him his job back.\n\nAs a man of principal, the Medic flatly refuses to cooperate. The Mayor now suggests that the reason his brother feels so assured in his defiance of the Council, is because Morten Kiil – a local tannery owner – has provided for the Doctor and his family in his Will. This comes as a total surprise to the Stockmann, but when the Mayor adds that the elderly businessman might now decide to rewrite his Will in view of the Medic’s recent behaviour. Stockmann reject this, saying that Kiil has no love for the authorities, and that he’d be absolutely delighted to see the Doctor rocking the boat.\n\nOn hearing this, the Mayor accuses his brother of causing trouble in the town merely to ingratiate himself with Kiil, and now that he’s armed with this information, he assures the Doctor that he’ll never get his job back.\n\nWhen Kiil arrives moments later, he brings with him a number of share bonds in the baths. The tannery owner suggests that if the Doctor was to retract his statement, the value of the shares that he’d bought cheaply that very morning would increase substantially, and leave him as the majority shareholder. He’d then be able to start work on the repairs that the GP had originally recommended. He asks the Doctor to consider his proposal, and to let him have his answer that afternoon.\n\nAs Kiil leaves, Aslaksen and Hovstad arrive with their own proposal for Stockmann. They’re aware that Kiil has been buying up blocks of shares, so they offer to give the Doctor full use of ‘The People’s Herald’ as soon as Kiil gains control of the baths so that he can convince the public that the water problem has been solved.\n\nThe two men advise the Doctor that the press have a huge amount of power in a town like theirs; all that they would require is some form of recompense in order to keep the newspaper running. Stockmann retorts sardonically – saying that it would be a travesty for sure if ‘The ‘People’s Herald’ – a real “friend of the people” should fold. However, since he himself has been declared ‘An Enemy of the People’, he really couldn’t care less what happens to the ‘paper! He then chases the two men from the house with his walking cane.\n\nOn hearing the commotion, Mrs Stockmann, Petra and Captain Horster come from the living room to see what’s going on. They find the Doctor writing the word ‘No!’ three times in large letters on a card which he’s ready to send to Morten Kiil. He then announces to his wife that they won’t now be sailing to New York as planned, but will stay put and fight. Given that the family are about to lose their own home, the Captain offers them a place at his house. There, the Doctor would be able to continue running his medical practice for the poorer residents of the town, since the more affluent townsfolk would doubtless refuse to see him.\n\nStockmann gratefully accepts Horster’s generous offer and vows to take on the rats that run the Council. His sole concern, he confesses, is that there might not be a single man in the town who’d be willing to carry on the fight after he’s gone.\n\nWhen Eilif and Morten – Stockmann’s sons arrive having been sent home from school for fighting, the Doctor resolves to establish a school for the poor in the hall where he was declared ‘An Enemy of the People’.\n\nMr Stockmann, though, still has reservations – not least as she believes that the authorities will continue to persecute her husband. He reassures here, however, that he will always be stronger than them, because he stands alone.\n\n© Copyright The Hellfire Club: The OFFICIAL PETER WYNGARDE Appreciation Society: https://www.facebook.com/groups/813997125389790/"
