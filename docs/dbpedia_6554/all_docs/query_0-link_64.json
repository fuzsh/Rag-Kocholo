With an eye toward getting the series shown on US television, the show was now shot using 35mm film instead of being videotaped, leading to an increase in picture quality. This brought The Avengers in line with other contemporary ITV series such as Danger Man (airing in the US as Secret Agent) and The Saint.\n\nActress Elizabeth Shepherd was originally cast as Emma Peel; one complete episode, \"The Town of No Return\", was filmed. Partway through filming of the second episode, \"The Murder Market\", the producers closed down production in order to recast the part. The Shepherd footage has never been televised and is believed to be lost. Canal+ once claimed it had the original footage, and then later retracted this claim. Publicity photos of Elizabeth Shepherd as Mrs. Emma Peel survive.\n\nFor American broadcast, all episodes of the 1965–1966 series included a specially-shot prologue preceding the main credits, showing Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel walking across a giant chessboard while a narrator introduces the characters and the concept of the series. This opening never aired in the UK and wasn't widely seen in the show's home country until the DVD release.\n\nThe closing credits of all episodes of the fourth series credit the production company as \"Associated British Productions Limited\", the name of ABC Weekend's parent company's film production wing in Elstree, but at the very end, the triangular logo of ABC Weekend TV appears with the caption \"ABC production\", as in previous series.\n\n\"The Strange Case of the Missing Corpse\" was filmed in colour on the set of \"Honey for the Prince\" and was, as Brian Clemens originally wrote it, intended to be tagged on to the end of the final b/w episode transmitted in America to advertise the upcoming colour episodes (though the b/w sequence titled \"Preamble for USA\", written by Brian Clemens to introduce the item, which was to have featured Patrick Macnee and Diana Ring explaining/introducing this short colour test film, is either lost or was never filmed). It was also cut down into a trailer for the colour episodes coming soon to ABC Network in America. Just like the prologue to the b/w Macnee/Rigg episodes, it was never meant to be screened anywhere but the US. There is a myth that it was to have originally been a twenty-minute mini-episode, but the version presently available on video is three minutes long and doesn't appear to be missing any substantial narrative content.\n\nSeries 5 (1967)\n\n[edit]\n\nCast: This series featured Patrick Macnee (as John Steed) and Diana Rigg (as Emma Peel). From this series onwards, all episodes were filmed in colour, but as ITV did not begin colour transmissions until November 1969, all were originally broadcast in the UK in black and white.\n\nProduction of this series occurred in two batches. The first 16 episodes were broadcast in both the UK and the US from January to May 1967. The remaining 8 episodes were broadcast in the UK as a continuation of the fifth series from September to November 1967, but in the US they were delayed until January 1968 where they formed the first half of a new season.\n\nJanuary to May\n\n[edit]\n\nNºEpTitleDirected byWritten byGuest castFirst UK broadcast [137]US air date [2][note 4]Prod.\n\ncode [137]US Ep1051\"From Venus with Love\"Robert DayPhilip LeveneBarbara Shelley, Philip Locke, Jon Pertwee, Derek Newark, Jeremy Lloyd, Adrian Ropes, Arthur Cox, Paul Gillard, Kenneth Benda, Michael Lynch9 January 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern14 January, ABC20 January 1967E.66.6.42–1\n\nAstronomers studying the planet Venus are being killed, by what appears to be a death-ray, as Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel investigate reports of an invasion from space.\n\n1062\"The Fear Merchants\"Gordon FlemyngPhilip LevenePatrick Cargill, Brian Wilde, Garfield Morgan, Annette Carell, Andrew Keir, Jeremy Burnham, Edward Burnham, Bernard Horsfall, Ruth Trouncer, Declan Mulholland16 January 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern21 January, ABC27 January 1967E.66.6.12–2\n\nExecutives in the ceramics industry are driven out of their minds with fear at the behest of a competitor, by the application of science.\n\n1073\"Escape in Time\"John KrishPhilip LevenePeter Bowles, Geoffrey Bayldon, Judy Parfitt, Imogen Hassall, Nicholas Smith, Clifford Earl, Edward Caddick23 January 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern28 January, ABC10 February 1967E.66.6.22–4\n\nAn organisation is apparently sending criminals into the past to escape arrest.\n\n1084\"The See-Through Man\"Robert AsherPhilip LeveneWarren Mitchell, Moira Lister, Roy Kinnear, Jonathan Elsom, John Nettleton, Harvey Hall30 January 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern4 February, ABC3 February 1967E.66.6.52–3\n\nA Russian spymaster seemingly purchases the secret of invisibility from an eccentric English scientist, in order to penetrate British security.\n\n1095\"The Bird Who Knew Too Much\"Roy RossottiBrian ClemensRon Moody, Ilona Rodgers, Kenneth Cope, Michael Coles, John Wood, Anthony Valentine, John Lee8 February 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern11 February, ABC10 March 1967E.66.6.32–7\n\nSteed and Emma chase a missing parrot that holds a clue to Soviet espionage activities.\n\n1106\"The Winged Avenger\"Peter Duffell, Gordon FlemyngRichard HarrisNigel Green, Jack MacGowran, Neil Hallett, Colin Jeavons, John Garrie, Donald Pickering, William Fox, Ann Sidney, Roy Patrick15 February 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern18 February, ABC17 February 1967E.66.6.62–5\n\nA comic book character is brought to life to commit murder, killing a number of men in the publishing industry – by walking up walls.\n\n1117\"The Living Dead\"John KrishBrian ClemensJulian Glover, Pamela Ann Davy, Howard Marion-Crawford, Jack Woolgar, Jack Watson, Edward Underdown, John Cater, Vernon Dobtcheff, Alister Williamson22 February 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern25 February, ABC3 March 1967E.66.6.72–6\n\nThe late Duke of Benedict, who perished in a mining disaster, returns to haunt a sleepy English village -- but is he really dead?\n\n1128\"The Hidden Tiger\"Sidney HayersPhilip LeveneRonnie Barker, Lyndon Brook, Gabrielle Drake, John Phillips, Stanley Meadows, Jack Gwillim, Frederick Treves, Reg Pritchard1 March 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern4 March, ABC17 March 1967E.66.6.82–8\n\nMen and animals are being mauled to death in rural England by what seems to be a tiger or puma -- but no one who sees it lives to tell the tale.\n\n1139\"The Correct Way to Kill\"Charles CrichtonBrian ClemensAnna Quayle, Michael Gough, Philip Madoc, Terence Alexander, Peter Barkworth, Graham Armitage, Timothy Bateson, Edwin Apps8 March 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern11 March, ABC24 March 1967E.66.6.92–9\n\nSeeking an organisation of murderous City gents, who are assassinating both British and enemy agents, Steed gets a glamorous but tall Russian partner, and Emma a short-lived one.\n\n11410\"Never, Never Say Die\"Robert DayPhilip LeveneChristopher Lee, Jeremy Young, Patricia English, David Kernan, Christopher Benjamin, John Junkin, Peter Dennis, Arnold Ridley, Alan Chuntz15 March 1967 ( )\n\nSouthern18 March, ABC31 March 1967E.66.6.102–10\n\nA motorist finds that wherever he goes he's involved in yet another traffic accident, repeatedly killing the same pedestrian – Dr. Frank N.

By the time Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell returned, three episodes had been filmed: two 90-minute episodes, named \"Invitation To a Killing\" and \"The Great Great Britain Crime\", as well as a standard-length episode, \"Invasion of the Earthmen\". These were considered to be extremely flawed episodes; they would likely have been scrapped, except that time did not exist in which to film new episodes and still meet the American contract. Hence, \"Invitation To a Killing\" was heavily edited and had several new shots filmed to become \"Have Guns — Will Haggle\", while \"The Great Great Britain Crime\" was heavily edited and had some old footage from previous episodes added, as well as some new footage, to become \"Homicide and Old Lace\". \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" was slightly edited as well. No known copies of the original versions of these episodes exist.[citation needed]\n\nThis series was produced in two batches: seven episodes (mostly without Patrick Newell as \"Mother\", and none with Rhonda Parker as \"Rhonda\") were added to the last eight Diana Rigg episodes for broadcast in the US in the spring of 1968: this made up the third series on ABC in America. On the original American broadcasts, these episodes featured the original 'Shooting Gallery' opening/closing titles featuring Tara in a tight-fitting tan outfit with a short skirt, and gunshots as Steed and Tara are shot at by an unseen gunman, which was filmed by Harry Booth. The seven episodes that aired in the US in the spring of 1968 aired in the following order:\n\n20 March The Forget-Me-Knot\n\n27 March Invasion of the Earthmen\n\n3 April The Curious Case of the Countless Clues\n\n10 April Split!\n\n24 April Get-A-Way\n\n1 May Have Guns — will Haggle\n\n8 May Look- (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers...\"[141]\n\nThese seven episodes were added sporadically into the 26 episodes produced in the next block, and the whole was transmitted in Britain as a single 33-episode run. The standard title sequences, the 'field/suits of armour' opening and 'playing card' ending, were filmed by Robert Fuest, originally for the first US transmission of the final 26 episodes, which made up the fourth series on the ABC network in America. These ones were tacked on to all 33 episodes when broadcast in the UK, apart from \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" which retained the amended Emma Peel opening credits and its original Tara King 'Shooting Gallery' end credit sequence.[citation needed]\n\nBy the time the sixth series came to be broadcast in the UK, ABC Weekend TV had ceased to exist: it had merged with Rediffusion London to become Thames Television. However all episodes of this series were still credited to A.B.C. Television Films as had the previous series.\n\nNotes:\n\nIn the episode \"Killer\", Tara King is only seen departing for and returning from holiday. Steed's fellow agent for this episode is Lady Diana Forbes-Blakeney (played by Jennifer Croxton).\n\nIn the US, the field/suits of armour opening title sequence was re-edited to 23 seconds (the UK sequence runs 49 seconds), to accommodate more commercials.\n\nThe original 1968 German-dubbed episodes of this series had the field/suits of armour opening titles, but the 'Shooting Gallery' end titles.\n\nThe original 1968 French-dubbed episodes of this series featured a variant in the opening title music: a gunshot sound is heard during the shot of Tara King running between two rows of suits of armour toward Steed, and the sound of the sword swipe at the beginning is missing.\n\nThe original title music for the opening 'Shooting Gallery' sequence featured gunshots. The version of the episode \"Split!\"—the only episode featuring this title sequence—that is included in the current DVD release (and aired on TV channel True Entertainment in the UK) nevertheless retains the standard title music, with the opening sword swipe sound effect where the first gunshot should be.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New Avengers\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
