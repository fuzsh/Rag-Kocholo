        "text": "I’ve heard horror stories about this one. Tales of the worst, most overt racism to hit the big screen since the infamous Song of the South. I really, really can’t, you guys.\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit. Any material, including images and/or video footage, are property of their respective companies, unless stated otherwise. The authors’ claim no ownership of this material. The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are capped from my copy of the movie with InstantShot! unless otherwise specified.\n\nAfter a nice stretch of movies that were readily available on Disney+ and often pre-screencapped, we’re back into the land of the obscure. And hoo boy, if you’re one of the people who keeps commenting demanding that I stop pointing out old fashioned Disney racism…. might wanna skip this review because there will be a lot of that here. Also no I will not stop. There’s a reason you probably haven’t heard about this movie. The original novel, The Great Dinosaur Robbery by David Forrest, tells the story of a group of wacky nannies battling Chinese Communists in Cold War Era New York. It’s so astoundingly racist that I am ashamed of having borrowed it from the library, packed full of painful Engrish dialects and references to “Dear Leader” that made me cringe every other page. The authors of the book (actually two men named Robert Forrest Webb and David Eliades) were very disappointed with Disney’s decision to move the setting to post World War I London to avoid having to tackle politics. But they weren’t so afraid of politics that they didn’t cast white men in every Chinese role, plastering them in appalling makeup and making the accents even more incomprehensible. Even from the stills I’m seeing during the research phase, it’s appalling. Like, it makes Song of the South look like a sensitive portrayal of other races, that’s how bad it is.\n\nSo, who’s responsible for a movie? Well, two men who have previously been very good friends to us, now stabbing us brutally in the back. I’ve sung the praises of director Robert Stevenson at length in previous reviews, admiring his sense of whimsy and his ability to elevate asinine premises like self-driving cars and frolicking with leprechauns into really solid movies. His team-ups with writer Bill Walsh have been some of the most well-regarded live action films in the entire Disney catalogue, including the legendary Mary Poppins. And this is the note Bill Walsh goes out on! He passed away from a heart attack several months before this hit theatres! This is not what I want to remember anyone for!\n\nAnd lest we brush this off as ‘different times’, this is the same studio, writer, and director that brought us Mr. Wu from The Love Bug, who was treated as a helpful, reasonable presence and played by a Chinese man. Internationally beloved Chinese superstar Bruce Lee passed away two years before this movie’s release, shortly after wrapping his best known film Enter the Dragon. Chinese advocacy groups like Asians for a Fair Media picketed theatres showing this movie on its initial release, something we haven’t seen since the aforementioned Song of the South. So, you know, it’s not just me. General audiences dismissed this film for other reasons as well. It only garnered $5.5 million, a huge disappointment after Witch Mountain and Apple Dumpling Gang. Critics deemed it unworthy of the Disney name and of the talent in its cast, accusing it of being formulaic and hard to suspend disbelief.\n\nThis is gonna be a tough one, ya’ll. Let’s get this overwith.\n\nSTORY\n\nOur framing device is the elderly version of Lord Edward Southmere regaling us with tales of the great adventures he had in his youth. Tales of vicious warlords (their words, not mine) who ruled the mysterious East… yeah. Right out of the gate you know this is going to be bad. We flash back to Southmere’s younger self, disguised in a very stereotypical Chinese fashion in a very stereotypical village. Two soldiers spot him and take off after him. Cue a daring chase on a hang glider while eating won tons… only to fall into a rice field… only to be rescued by the Yeti. This opening is so much.\n\nEventually he gets on a train back to England, with his prize in hand. What the Chinese soldiers wanted so badly was a small piece of film mysteriously called Lotus X, and now it’s all Southmere’s. He recounts his adventures to his valet, so wrapped up in his victory that he completely fails to notice the valet disappearing. We’re supposed to know the “new driver” is shady because he’s Chinese (ish… the yellowface is real in this movie.), so Southmere questions him a bit and threatens him with the gun hidden in his umbrella. But the car behind them is full of assassins, and Southmere is outnumbered.\n\nSouthmere makes a break for it and takes refuge in the Natural History Museum, where a group of nannies are taking the children they’re watching through the exhibits. The frantic Lord snatches a baby carriage from under their noses and books it. The largest of the assassins, a brute named Fan Choy, tries to do the same, but the nannies aren’t about to fall for that twice so they beat the snot out of him with their handbags. The first escaped carriage scoots around the museum seemingly by itself while security swarms in to try to break up the fight.\n\nThe leader of the Chinese… spies/mafia/I’m really not even sure, the worst caricature of all named Hnup Wan, watches from a passing limo. He sends his second-in-command, another cringeworthy stereotype named Quon, to get things under control. So he calls out his guys and they disguise themselves as travelling acrobats on a cultural exchange program. It’s like they’re going down a checklist of Chinese stereotypes and trying to use every single one. Anyway, for some reason Thumley, the museum’s head of security, buys this, and Hnup Wan and Quon waltz right in. The stolen baby carriage keeps rolling around, and another nanny sends young Lord Richard Castleberry (who’s like 8) and his little brother Truscott to find their actual nanny. We’ll come back to them later.\n\nWith the coast clear, Southmere hops out of the baby carriage and bolts for the Hall of the Dinosaurs. Once inside, he unscrews the tip of his umbrella, pulls out Lotus X, and hides it among the bones of the largest dinosaur skeleton. In his haste, he falls and smacks his head on the concrete floor. Just then, Nanny Hettie runs in to recover her lost baby carriage at last. Turns out, she looked after him when he was a kid! But there’s no time for happy reunions. It’s already a struggle to stay awake. He fights unconsciousness long enough to tell Hettie that he’s hidden Lotus X on the dinosaur, and she needs to find it before the Chinese group does. Before he can tell her what it is or what to do with it when she finds it, he passes out. In the book, he actually dies here and the story follows Hettie, one of the many changes that annoyed the authors.\n\nAnyway, he’s not dead, and conveniently enough a pair of foreign doctors rush over to “help”. Of course, they’re not really doctors but Hnup Wan and Quon in disguise. Hettie’s own second-in-command Nanny Emily protests to letting them examine Southmere because they’re foreign (ugh) but they don’t have much choice but to let them do their thing. The two nannies hurry over to examine the dinosaur, but come up empty because again, Southmere didn’t actually tell them where to look. They don’t get very far before Thumley and the two young boys catch them, and they’re forced to cut their search short.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you’re probably a big Disney fan, which means that you might just recognize the name of the Chinese restaurant that our villains use as a front. It’s called The Reluctant Dragon! And you know, I took issue with a lot of that movie but man, at this point I’d rather be watching that. Hnup Wan is inside auditioning a performer who’s not even bothering with makeup or an accent, which should be a good thing but he’s Chinese because the movie said so which is not a good thing. He gets hired not for his juggling, but for his maitre d’ skills, which Hnup Wan finds more useful anyway. With that done, he hurries downstairs to check on Quon’s interrogation of Southmere. It’s not going well. Even when Hnup Wan takes matters into his own hands, Southmere denies ever being a spy and insists he’s just an ordinary businessman. No one believes him but they’re also not getting anywhere, so Hnup Wan decides to pursue his old nanny instead.\n\nThis goes about as well as you might expect, this being a wacky Disney comedy. Quon tries his best to follow Hettie but ends up falling into dumb slapstick scenario after dumb slapstick scenario, including falling into water, falling into water, getting choked out by a really fake bear arm, and- wait you’ll never believe this- falling into water. Truly the height of hilarity. He completely fails at hearing anything useful, though Hettie and Emily discuss their plans pretty openly after prying Richard away from his books and Truscott away from his pet snake. They make no effort to hide that they’re planning on recruiting a small army of nannies to search the dinosaur for Lotus X. The other nannies arrive, and Hettie and Emily announce the time and place for the heist in broad daylight, but Quon is too frozen in ice from hiding in an ice cream truck to hear.\n\nClosing time at the museum sees a small army of nannies hiding in the mouth of a model blue whale. An entirely pointless scene with some rich Texan trying to buy a dinosaur from the curator holds them up. Once they’re finally gone, the nannies can get to work. With characteristic British efficiency, Hettie assigns each of them a part of the dinosaur to search. They climb all over the skeleton, and shenanigans ensue including Emily almost getting crushed by a dinosaur skeleton. After several hours, they find nothing and it’s time for all of them to leave to make sure their children haven’t been stolen from their beds or anything. Only Hettie, Emily, and Susan, the youngest, extremely excitable nanny remain. Surely there’s time for a nice cup of tea? Oh, wait, nope, Hnup Wan’s men found them.\n\nThe bad guys cart the nannies up to Hnup Wan’s office, and wouldn’t you know it? Hettie knows him! He was the son of the Chinese ambassador, who grew up in close proximity to her own charge back in the day. She shares lots of embarassing stories about his youth, like his old nickname Panda Nose and how long it took him to be potty trained, much to Quon’s delight. To change the subject, Hnup Wan offers the nannies tea, which sparks an argument over the proper way to serve it and who invented it first. This would actually be a really funny bit of social commentary about colonialism if only they had bothered to cast Chinese actors. Sigh. The bowing and scraping at a portrait of their military leader Wu Tsai doesn’t help, either. Double sigh.\n\nThe old stiff upper lip helps the nannies resist Hnup Wan’s interrogation tactics, and they end up in the same cell as Southmere. On the way, they pass by what seems to be a kung fu dojo, except that no one is doing anything resembling any kind of martial arts as they are flailing their limbs and making noises. Like, every time I think this movie has hit some kind of racist zenith, something new pops up. It’s astounding. Anyway, Southmere is thrilled to see Hettie again, but they still haven’t found Lotus X and he still can’t remember where it is. Hnup Wan plays it off like he’s brought him three nurses to refresh his memory, but all those sinister airs disappear when Hettie plays the sweet old lady card and we see just how afraid of her he still is.\n\nSusan, who’s been quietly sitting in the background this entire time, is just thrilled to meet a real spy. Hettie gives the two proper introductions and the way it’s staged made me think that Susan and Southmere were going to end up together because this is a Disney movie and they always pair off their male lead with the first girl who’s vaguely close to his age. But spoiler alert: not this time! Yay! Anyway, all this polite conversation is very nice and all but they need to get out of here. Seeing a kung fu student go flying past the cell gives Susan an idea. She goads the gigantic Fan Choy into showing how big and strong he is by having him karate chop straight through solid brick over and over again. Soon more students get in on the action, and they karate chop the wall full of holes that the nannies can easily escape through. Not Southmere, though. He’s still chained to the wall. Eventually the weakened brick gives in and he yanks himself backwards so hard he falls backwards and knocks himself out cold on the concrete floor again.\n\nGeneral Wu Tsai sends a message from Peking: get Lotus X back like yesterday or else. Hnup Wan suspects that Quon might be trying to usurp him as the head of whatever this is, but he’s not worried. He doesn’t have the brains to plan something like what Hnup Wan has in mind. And what plan could that be? Why, to steal the dinosaur of course! Quon grovels at his boss’s feet, praising him in a bunch of really stereotypical vaguely Chineseish metaphors that just get worse the longer they go on and they go on a while. At least Hnup Wan is satisfied I guess.\n\nThe nannies get stuck supervising a birthday party for one of their kids. The creepy singsong chanting the kids are doing should provide a decent enough cover for the nannies to plot their next move, but Richard refuses to move from the seat beside him where he’s engrossed in a book. After a whole lot of backtalk, he sulks off and leaves the nannies to it. But as it turns out, they don’t really have a next move until Hnup Wan’s men make one first. Susan is stationed at a coffee shop across from the Reluctant Dragon spying on the enemy, waiting for them to do something. And speaking of spying, Richard didn’t join the game at all. He’s spying on his nanny after all.\n\nWith Truscott in tow, Richard follows Hettie and Emily to the coffee shop. Susan hasn’t learned anything yet but that doesn’t last long. Right as the other two nannies arrive, a whole fleet of cars zooms out from behind the Chinese restaurant, flanking a big flatbed truck. Well, that’s suspicious. Hettie creeps around the back of the restaurant, through a random room full of really creepy masks, unaware that Richard and Truscott are close behind her. They put on masks and pretend to be assassins but Hettie scolds what she thinks is mafia men and sasses off. It’s kind of impressive. Meanwhile, Hnup Wan’s men load up the flatbed with crates of soy sauce and Susan and Emily realize they’re going to the museum.\n\nHettie follows the unnecessarily creepy tunnel to the end and pops out right next to the cell where Southmere is still locked up. He’s thrilled to report that the second bump on the head restored his memory, and he knows with complete certainty that he left Lotus X in the nape of the dinosaur’s neck. Actually, Hettie’s way more concerned with getting her former charge out of that cage, but he insists the film is more important so she has no choice but to leave him behind. Her current charges find the cell the second she leaves. Southmere is very nonchalant about seeing two kids in a prison cell and once again is more concerned about Lotus X. All this secrecy instantly convinces Richard and Truscott he’s a spy, though he still refuses to admit it. Then Truscott’s snake scares him because this comedy has been really light on jokes and we’re getting desperate.\n\nAfter reconvening, the three nannies careen through London on Emily’s janky motorcycle, running into everything that gets between them and the Natural History Museum. Hnup Wan still gets there first but Thumley actually does his job as Head of Security and refuses to let them in after hours. At first. A lot of racist gibberish, cajoling, and promises of a diplomatic gift from China finally convinces Thumley to let the bad guys waltz right in to the Hall of the Dinosaurs. Thumley realizes what’s happening too late, and Hnup Wan’s men kidnap him, kung fu fight the security guards, and load the skeleton onto the bed of the truck. The nannies sneak into the truck’s cab, Hnup Wan furiously orders his guys to get into their car, and you’ll never guess what happens next.\n\nHint: it’s a car chase. So novel, I know. This particular car chase gets dumber and dumber the longer it goes on, and it goes on forever. Since pretty much everyone in this movie is a stereotype, the chase passes by a bunch of British stereotypes in varying degrees of shock at seeing a dinosaur skeleton hurtling through the London fog. Highlights (and I use that term loosely) include two Scottish guys thinking it’s Nessie, a giraffe at the zoo falling in love with it, and a game hunter declaring that it would look just smashing over his mantle. Incidentally, that last one is Jon Pertwee, aka the Third Doctor Who. At long, long, looong last, Hnup Wan’s car crashes into his own henchmen, and the nannies pull the truck onto a train to take them and their dinosaur to the safety of the English countryside.\n\nAll of a sudden, out of nowhere, two thirds of the way through the movie, we start following a completely different character we’ve never heard of and have no reason to care about. The museum’s curator, Geoffrey Wilkinson, blusters in babbling about some Yugoslavian butterflies he found and completely ignoring his frantic secretary’s cries that Thumley has gone missing. A reporter enters his office to speak to him and he eagerly agrees. That is, until he realizes they’re not here about his butterflies but a missing dinosaur. Wilkinson doesn’t believe anyone could steal a whole brontosaurus skeleton but when he takes the reporter on a tour of the Hall of the Dinosaurs, sure enough, it’s gone! I know, you’re shocked, it’s not like we just saw 45 years of the theft happening. Really efficient storytelling happening here.\n\nThe theft makes international headlines and Scotland Yard turns up to the museum to investigate. The police inspector fervently hopes his Veruca doesn’t want a dinosaur skeleton because he’s played by Roy Kinnear, and we get more interminable gags about detectives with silly talents. One can smell anything, one can guess what color underwear you’re wearing by looking into your eyes, and it’s way less interesting than I just made it sound. It does, however, add up to some rather astounding police work that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that a group of old ladies conspired with the Chinese mafia to steal the dinosaur.\n\nAfter… that… we return to our actual characters. The nannies find a safe place in the countryside to hide the dinosaur, and Hnup Wan tries to question Southmere again. This time, though, is a little different. He unchains him and serves him a nice cup of tea, which is all much friendlier than last time if not much more informative. Southmere still doesn’t remember anything about Lotus X’s whereabouts and he still denies being a spy. Before Hnup Wan can press the issue, Fan Choy hauls Richard and Truscott into the office, because apparently they snuck back into the restaurant in search of their nanny. Southmere tells them Hettie and a few other nannies stole a dinosaur.\n\nAll ten year old kids love dinosaurs, it’s a scientific fact. So, naturally, Richard wants to know all about the theft. Which dinosaur did they take? And Southmere’s and Hnup Wan’s jaws drop. What do you mean there’s more than one dinosaur??? It’s not like they’ve both been to the Hall of Dinosaurs several times by this point. It’s not like the movie is called One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing and not Our Dinosaur Is Missing. Okay, yeah they don’t know that but come on. It’s not uncommon for Disney to psych us out with long red herrings like this (the middle of Bedknobs and Broomsticks anyone?), but I despise it. And yes, that’s exactly what’s happened here: we’ve spent an hour and a half chasing the wrong dinosaur.\n\nIn their little thicket in the woods, the nannies start to figure out that Lotus X is not, in fact, in the nape of their dinosaur’s neck. This means that they’re not watching the kids, which means they can get real buddy buddy with the Chinese maybe-mafia. Richard’s fancy book learning helps them narrow it down to either the brontosaurus or the diplodocus, and with the brontosaurus missing in action there’s only one place to look. Hnup Wan poses as the kids’ uncle, pays off the replacement security guy, and climbs up the diplodocus. Sure enough, there’s Lotus X, tucked in between the vertebrae of the neck just like Southmere said. He plucks it out just that easily and even pays the boys handsomely for their help because he’s not such a bad guy after all.\n\nWith smug satisfaction, Richard and Truscott return home. Hettie is close behind them, having left Emily and Susan to keep watch while she figures out what to do. And oh my god this next scene cements these two as the single worst Disney Kids we’ve ever seen. Richard smugly sneers that he knows everything, more than Hettie even because she had the wrong dinosaur all along and now that nice Chinese gentleman has his property back. And all this trouble could be avoided if she’d just trusted the kids. She’s more aghast that Richard is being rude than anything because British, but there’s no denying she’s made a serious mistake. Emily and Susan rush back to London, but it’s too late.\n\nAt long last, Hnup Wan fires up the old projector to find out the secrets of Lotus X. Not so fast! Quon bursts in to snatch the microfilm back, revealing that he’s been talking to General Wu Tsai all along and he’s furious that this whole thing has been such a debacle. So, Hnup Wan is out as leader of this assignment, and Quon is in, and he’s way worse than the mostly harmless incompetent. Things just got real, so Hettie and the other nannies rush to cabs in the hopes of getting to the Reluctant Dragon before it’s too late. Richard and Truscott declare that if she doesn’t let them go, he’ll tell the police because he’s a blackmailing little snot, so I guess they’re going too. This. Kid.\n\nWhile Hnup Wan packs for his exile and blathers about how much the General’s mother loved him, Quon orders for Southmere to be brought to his office. Now that they’ve recovered Lotus X, he’s outlived his usefulness, so the General has ordered him executed. Before the protesting ordinary businessman can be carried off by angry mafia henchmen slash martial artists, the nannies bust in to save the day. The bad guys stand there stunned until Quon screams out his orders. So begins a truly bizarre climactic fight between trained martial artists and little old ladies. It’s the kind of absurdity that would have been funny in a better movie but alas, it’s in this. Throughout the whole spectacle, Hnup Wan and Southmere casually enjoy dinner because they’re apparently buds now, and Richard and Truscott throw dumplings at the bad guys. Also the Texan from earlier thinks it’s all a show to impress his girlfriend on her birthday. Americans, amirite? Eventually, Hettie defeats Quon himself by whacking him with an umbrella and a chair and Emily and Susan smash the brontosaurus through a restaurant wall.\n\nWell, all’s well that ends well. The cops get the skeleton back where it belongs. Richard and Truscott enjoy a celebratory meal of Chinese food and apologize for being terrible. Hettie, Emily, Susan, and Southmere enjoy a drink with their new best friend Hnup Wan. All that’s missing is Lotus X, which is a real shame. But wait! Southmere has it! The police just… gave it to him. Offscreen. Sure. And now it’s time to see what was sooo important. And after all that… it’s just a recipe for wonton soup. General Wu Tsai’s mother’s super ultra top secret family recipe, to be exact. Turns out, Southmere was telling the truth all along. He’s not a spy, he really is an ordinary businessman in search of new recipes to bring to the American market.\n\nAt this point I’m not sure if I’m laughing to hide my tears or straight up having a breakdown. But regardless, we bookend the movie with another scene of Old Southmere recounting his adventures. He tells us of the great service he did the world by bringing America wonton soup. And how did he market the stolen recipe? Why, with the help of his best friend and marketing partner, Hnup Wan! We end the movie on a commercial featuring a gleeful, elderly Hnup Wan hucking Madame Wu Tsai’s Wonton Soup. And can I just say canned won ton soup, with won tons suspended in liquid instead of being all crispy, sounds absolutely disgusting? Almost as disgusting as the crumbling old age make up caked over the yellow face. Seriously, the last shot of this movie will haunt my nightmares forever.\n\nYou know what really annoys me about this? I mean apart from the appalling, relentless anti-Asian racism that permeates this whole thing for no discernible reason. Like, come on. Oh, but I’m getting sidetracked. The other thing that really annoys me about how bad this movie was was that the scenes that focused on the nannies had a really dry, distinctly British sense of humor that usually appeals to me greatly. Some of their bits are cut from the same cloth as Monty Python… but like, the frayed, scrappy pieces of cloth that you can’t really do anything with. Racism and wasted potential. My two least favorite things on this journey. Ugh.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nLord Edward Southmere takes the upper class twit stereotype to an extreme. Part of it’s not his fault: not only does he suffer from head trauma but he really doesn’t know anything he’s being interrogated over. But he’s real nonchalant about being kidnapped by the mafia and presumably tortured inasmuch Disney 70s live action allows such a thing. Unfortunately, Derek Nimmo doesn’t have quite the same charm as John Cleese or Terry-Thomas, which makes the character fall flat.\n\nNanny Hettie has all the no-nonsense strictness of another famous Disney nanny directed by Robert Stevenson without any of the charm. You’ll notice a theme here. Okay, some of her lines were good, but for the most part, she too felt like a vague shadow of a better film. It’s a shame to see the legendary Helen Hayes so underused. I liked her much better in Herbie Rides Again.\n\nNanny Emily doesn’t have Susan’s spirit of adventure or Hettie’s leadership skills, but do you really need them when you’re as ride or die as this woman? She’s meek, though even she has her limits like when someone insults English tea, but as she herself puts it, she’s known Hettie for thirty years. It’s admirable. Also, there’s something even I can’t help but like about a little old lady driving a motorcycle. This movie has been likened to a Carry On film for kids, and Joan Sims here has been in all of those. Now, I’ve never heard of those but that has to be intentional.\n\nNanny Susan is the youngest nanny, so young that Hettie doesn’t believe she should be a nanny. There’s not much to her character except that she’s super excited about everything all the time. She does get a very clever moment when she helps the nannies escape the jail, but after that she kinda fades into the background. I’ll take that over forcing her into a chemistry-less romance with Southmere like I was expecting!\n\nHnup Wan… okay, the less I say about Hnup Wan the better. I’ve already said most of what needs to be said anyway. He’s an atrocious caricature and the second I saw him I went “oh no”. And what really sucks is I normally love Peter Ustinov. He was hilarious as Blackbeard and Prince John, so to see him go from that to this is… it’s a big oof. And a pretty painful one.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe credits music of this movie gets off to a really good start, with a deep, mysterious melody played on brass and xylophone. It had a nice, almost jazzy feel to it and I was kind of into it. And then the brass gave way to what I think is a zither and a gong and the smile just… slid off my face. So, like the rest of the movie, I almost kind of enjoyed the score when it was focused on British culture aaaand then they started stereotyping Chinese people again. Other little bits I almost liked were the use of Rockabye Baby as a leitmotif for the nannies and xylophone to represent the dinosaur bones. Little things like that were clever touches from Battle of Britain composer Ron Goodwin. But man, when they’re trying to make fun of Chinese people instead of representing their culture, they make sure you know it.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nOkay, credit where credit is due, there’s a nice touch of whimsy throughout the look of this film. Unsurprising, since whimsy is Robert Stevenson’s bread and butter. Helping him achieve that live action cartoon look is famed cinematographer Paul Beeson, who worked on Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and the Indiana Jones films. He also famously shot the opening “hills are alive” sequence for the Sound of Music from a helicopter. Obviously, this isn’t his best work, but it is colorful, and it’s kinda neat seeing the dinosaur rising above the London fog. And it is London fog… okay, it’s probably a fog machine, but they did film on location in London at Pinewood and Elstree Studios. Other scenes were filmed at hte real Natural History Museum, London Zoo, and the towns of Windsor and Berkshire. Oh, and going back to the dinosaur, he had quite the storied film career: he can be seen in the background of Star Wars: A New Hope when C-3PO and R2D2 walk through Tattooine past the skeleton of a Krayt Dragon.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nIt may surprise some of you, but I don’t like being this person. I do it a lot, but I don’t like it. I just think it’s important to be cognizant that maybe some art from different times may not have been okay them and it’s certainly not okay now. And this is really, really not okay. And even besides all the gross racial stuff, this movie’s just very shoddily made. The first half of the movie doesn’t connect at all to the rest of it, very few of the jokes land, it’s terribly unfocused… I mean, we cut to a completely different set of protagonists halfway through for no payoff! Skip this one. You’ll be happier for it.\n\nFavorite scene: The one and only joke that made me laugh was this exchange between Emily and Hettie during the otherwise-interminable car chase. The deadpan delivery and the look on Emily’s face makes it."
