        "text": "Recently I had to admit to myself that I started two businesses, not one. Up until now, everything has either been CASA Creative Studios, our film-first creative agency or CASA Film Studios our soundproof studio facility for rent. Two sides of the same CASA coin, just different customers, using different amounts of us. It made total sense to me without need for the explanation but unfortunately not to everyone else (or Google). And in practise, they are completely different client bases that share almost no similarities. As a team, at the start of this year, we decided to rebrand the studio rental business to Tooting Film Studios and effectively make it a client of our CASA Creative Studios business. In turn, being our own living case study and for us to experience our own creative and strategic medicine. We often advise clients on tough decisions and help them focus down on the new path. Flipping the tables and being on the receiving end of that advice for ourselves has been illuminating and renews my admiration for all the businesses that have gone down that difficult path. Pivoting away from things you’ve been investing in emotionally and financially is a hard decision. It feels like defeat. And sure, reasonable people will say, \"it’s not a defeat, you’ve learnt something.\" They’re not wrong but that doesn’t make it any easier to make the call. The only thing that will make it easier is knowing that as soon as you’ve agreed on the problem, you pulled the lever to get on with fixing it quickly. Below is a blog I wrote that goes into more detail about the naming choices. I’ll be doing a breakdown video on our creative treatment soon. I won’t be speaking much about our Tooting Film Studios business here, so give us a follow if you’re interested in seeing the content we’re making for it.\n\nFilm Studio Growth in the United States - Establishing State Economic Growth - Film Production Growing in New Jersey The film industry in New Jersey employed more than 8,500 people throughout 2023 – and that number is on the rise. Netflix is investing $1 billion to build its East Coast flagship production studio at Fort Monmouth, creating 1,500 industry jobs. Lionsgate is building a major studio in Newark, and 1888 Studios, the largest ground-up movie studio complex in North America, will soon call Bayonne home. It’s expected that by 2026, the motion picture industry in the state will amount to $1 billion per year and, by 2035, the industry will cross the multi-billion-dollar threshold. In recent years, the state has played host to a number of successful film and TV productions. Read more here - https://lnkd.in/gyMs-R2r\n\nThe bubble burst long ago. Platforms like Tubi, which have amassed 50,000 film and television programmes, and so many like the one I recently made, are licensed for no upfront fee in return for a tiny percentage of the advertising based on who watches. Mine is a documentary that the Guardian voted No17 Best Film in the UK of 2021 out of just over 1,000 new films. Despite all the glowing reviews and a subject not covered before, there was no outlet or distributor willing to pay an advance in North America. Still, I am very pleased they are screening GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER(S), as I made it to be watched, not sit on a shelf, so thank you, Tubi for giving this subject matter an airing. Channel 4 licensed it in the UK, which was very satisfactory, and they screened it twice on Holocaust Remembrance Day 2023 and 2004 without any commercials. Amazon also has it in North America, but it is on the same shared revenue deal. If the cost of living crisis continues, AVOD will soon dwarf standard subscription streamers because it is free to consumers. Given the glut of films, the film industry is in for a very bumpy ride, but no one ever addresses this fact - oversupply. Also, Ireland is becoming slightly more attractive than the UK as producers do not face EU quotas for films. Some people in the film industry actually voted for Brexit.\n\nMarlow Film Studios will “provide significant opportunities for the younger generation to gain the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to support a future career in the creative industries,” according to Buckinghamshire business leaders. In a letter of support, Michael Garvey, Chairman Buckinghamshire Business First, welcomes the proposed £750 million plan which will create more than 4,000 jobs and 300 training places, highlighting that it will add opportunities to “sustain carers over a long period of time, as well as offering training within the Creative Industries for early career and career transition.” He adds that the BBF supports the Marlow Film Studio proposal which, “delivers significant benefits, meets the clear needs for more film and television facilities as the UK continues to be one of Hollywood’s preferred destinations for filming big budget feature films, and further grows a sector which Buckinghamshire leads on both nationally and internationally helping achieve local and national government policy objectives,” and asks that Buckinghamshire Council planners gives it “serious consideration” as it “will add significant value to Buckinghamshire”. Setting the proposal within its wider context, Mr Garvey adds that the proposal’s planned new transport hub will be a major catalyst to making sustainable transport options more accessible for the surrounding communities, who are currently not well supported with public transport. Buckinghamshire Business First (BBF) is recognised by both the Department for Business and Trade (formerly BEIS) and the Department for Levelling up, Housing & Communities (DLUCH) as the Growth Hub for Buckinghamshire. BBF provides businesses in Buckinghamshire with knowledge, support and opportunities for growth. They have also been appointed by the Department for Education as the Employer Representative Body (ERB) for Buckinghamshire and are leading on the development of the Local Skills Improvement Plan. BBF is led by a Board of local business leaders whose organisations operate across a diverse range of sectors, employee numbers and turnover levels. One of the primary objectives of BBF is to promote business growth and to support a thriving economy. BBF amplifies the voice of the business community within Buckinghamshire and currently has over 15,000 businesses (of the 32,000 in the county – over 47%) engaged with its activities. 65.2% of private sector employment in Buckinghamshire is within businesses who are engaged with BBF.
