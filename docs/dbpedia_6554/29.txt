…We’ve gone green! We’re now ‘digest’ size for the summer, perfect for beach bags – and the environment. But don’t fret, it’s still choc-a-bloc with the same amount of gripping articles and fun features. Many thanks to Art in Movement and the talented David Parody for the cover photo. Did you know it is estimated that less than 10% of the money in circulation is now physical cash? Jamie talks blockchain, and Denise highlights the importance of partnerships. We return to the important relatable topic of Roger’s mental health struggles, and touch upon the taboo topic of abortion. Looking back at Gibraltar’s rich history, Mark takes us up the Rock to the Northern Defences, and Reg is back with the fascinating story of Operation Snatch. And lastly, we speak to ghost whisperer Derek Acorah ahead of his return to the Rock. Enjoy the issue!
