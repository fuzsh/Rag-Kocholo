K-Pax III: The Worlds of Prot by Gene Brewer

Prot is back and patient Robert has returned to catatonia at the Manhattan Institute. This visit to EARTH, prot promises, will be his very last and so Dr. Gene Brewer has limited and precious time in which to unravel the mystery of prot and recall Robert to life. But around him excitement turns to hysteria as prot's charm and influence on the other patients and on the world exerts itself. Prot will be taking one hundred beings with him when he leaves, to live on the perfect planet K-PAX, and everybody is clamouring to be chosen. Will prot's true identity be revealed, and will Dr. Gene be left wondering for ever?

Before becoming a novelist, Gene Brewer studied DNA replication and cell division at several major research stations. He is the author of K-PAX and ON A BEAM OF LIGHT, K-PAX II which along with K-PAX III complete the K-PAX trilogy. He lives in New York City.
