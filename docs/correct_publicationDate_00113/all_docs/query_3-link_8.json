        "text": "STAR DREAMS\n\nI was born at 1022 Kirby Avenue in Muncie, Indiana, USA, at precisely four o’clock A.M. on Tuesday, July 4, 1937. No angels sang, but I understand that my mother uttered a shriek or two (she reminded me of the pain I caused her on numerous later occasions). That particular house, still standing, was my birthplace (as well as my parents’ rented apartment) because my mother was afraid of hospitals. This fear came about, at least in part, because her mother, not long before, had checked into one for treatment of uterine cancer. As dread as this affliction was, it wasn’t as bad, in Mom’s surmise, as the radiation therapy. They burnt her up, she told me later, and countless times thereafter, confusing, perhaps, the awful symptoms with the treatment rather than the disease.\n\nBefore my parents were married, Dad worked on a farm. With a new wife and prospective family he tried to get a job in town, but they were scarce—the country was still coming out of the depression. He applied for one at Warner Gear, a division of Borg-Warner Corporation (he had been laid off, after a few months, from Ball Brothers, Inc., makers of Ball dome jars and benefactors of Ball Memorial Hospital and Ball State University). When he made an appearance at the factory and spoke to the manager, his personal application was summarily rejected. He whirled and started running toward the door. The guy shouted, Hey, where you going? I’ve got to find a job! Dad yelled back. He got the job, and stood on the assembly line for 38 years grinding gears for General Motors cars and trucks. Except for a near-fatal eye injury, and a collapsed lung, I don’t believe he ever missed a day of work. Nonetheless, even after all those years, he never rose to the level of foreman.\n\nI nearly died very early on. My mother’s milk was no good (as she put it), so I was given regular cows’ milk at the outset. I couldn’t digest it and was chronically constipated. Dad told me much later that one day my stomach was hard as a rock, and the doctor didn’t expect me to live through the night. When I embarrassed him by being alive the next morning he prescribed a very fat-rich milk, the kind produced by Jerseys or Guernseys, rather than Holsteins.\n\nOther close calls include my mother’s rocking me in her arms in the porch swing, which suddenly collapsed, and she flung me over her head against the wall of the house. And I still have a tiny scar on my forehead from being gouged by an unforgiving doorlatch. Fortunately I don’t remember any of the above.\n\nThe rest of the house on Kirby Avenue was occupied by my 300+-pound Aunt Mag and her husband Mac (for McClellan), thirty years her senior, who were childless (they later adopted a boy, Joe, and girl, Henrietta). My first memory is of going somewhere in an old Model A Ford. I was in the back seat, Mag was driving, and Mom, who was almost nine months pregnant with my sister Nancy, was to my left. We had just pulled into the alley next to the tiny side yard when the car backfired. It didn’t frighten me, but it did get my attention, and I can still see my surroundings, if vaguely, on that night. I was twenty months old.\n\nAfter that memorable incident nothing happened until I was well into my threes. Sometime during that year I burned my finger on the kitchen stove. This would not be noteworthy except that it suggests an early curiosity about my environment, and for my discovery during supper (Hoosier for dinner) that if I held my burnt finger against the fat-rich-milk bottle, the pain went away. At the same time, I could see my father, his back to us, urinating in the tiny bathroom off the kitchen. Somehow, all of that together made a lasting impression.\n\nIn 1941, when I was four, we visited my paternal great-grandmother in Spencer, IN, where I was goaded into standing in a field with my little fingers wrapped around the enormous horn of a bull. I was terrified but did it anyway for fear, I suspect, of being sneered or laughed at, a trait which surfaced at an early age and continues to this day. But I also remember the wonderful aroma of Grandma Ashley’s early-morning biscuits (we slept on the living room floor adjacent to the kitchen). I jumped up and hung around with her until breakfast was ready. Nothing has ever tasted better than those hot biscuits dripping with warm butter and homemade raspberry jam, though the pleasure may have been magnified by the relief I still felt on having escaped from being gored or trampled by a huge bovine the evening before.\n\nJust before Pearl Harbor we moved into a home of our own at 3317 E. 15th Street, very near the southeast corner of town. An alley, ideal for playing and getting around the neighborhood, was in back. There was a heart-shaped tulip bed in the middle of the side yard (which ruined it for ball games), a blackberry bush, weeping willow tree, and sandbox in the back corner, and a few peonies (Mom called them pineys) along the grassy unused driveway. My chief avocation was riding a tricycle around and around the two-bedroom house and yard.\n\nThe only heat came from a coal-burning stove with an isinglass window in the middle of the living room, where my sister and I used to huddle immediately after getting up on frigid winter mornings. Other memorable features were the big Philco radio, an attic stuffed with curtain stretchers, and a spider-webbed basement with a dirt floor and a coal bin, and a shelf of home-canned peaches.\n\nDespite having two small children, Dad volunteered for the army, but was rejected because of flat feet. He seemed to walk normally, and I couldn’t understand why this condition precluded military service. Another thing I didn’t get: since he could write checks for whatever we needed, why did he have to make money?\n\nMom had eleven brothers and sisters, including two stillbirths (twins), and Dad nine. I never knew my maternal grandparents—my grandmother, a farm wife, died before I was born, and my grandfather, a farmer and miller, not long after. Sometime before that he became a one-armed milkman, having lost a limb while loading a muzzle shotgun. He also belonged to the Ku Klux Klan, though, to his credit, dropped out after witnessing a hanging.\n\nMy mother was the youngest of the family, most of whom, including her, had red hair. The only thing I know about Uncle Cliff was that he dropped dead in the grocery store at the age of forty-five. Uncle Oat was insane. Mom told me that once, on the farm, she had asked her mother what the screaming in the barn was about. Oh, that’s just Oatie beating the horses again. Many years later, his wife committed suicide. For months Oat and his son watched each other carefully, until the latter managed to run off and electrocute himself by jumping onto a high-tension power line. My uncle saw the whole thing but was unable to stop him, and shot himself to death immediately afterward.\n\nThe only things I remember about Uncle Frank are that his upper lip seemed to be a double one, and his nose was filled with red hair. He, too, was a farmer and we rarely saw him. Uncle Ab (Albert) appeared only once, when he came to visit very late in his life.\n\nUncle Pete, the youngest boy, was an inventor. He owned several patents, the most famous of which was probably Pound Pup, a toy along which a kid pounded tight-fitting wooden dowels into holes and then turned the dachshund over and pounded them the other way. My favorite uncle, though, was Roy, who was quiet, gentle, and soft-spoken, perhaps because he had a defective heart valve, and couldn’t exert himself. And a boisterous wife, Aunt Katherine, whose laugh sounded like a car trying to start on a winter morning.\n\nThere were four girls: Maggie, Angie, Mae, and my mother, Osie. I didn’t get to know Angie until she was elderly. I liked her. But it was Aunt Mae who had the strongest influence on my life. She lived on a farm way out in the country, and I loved to visit her and Uncle Lester. A World War I veteran—he enlisted at fourteen—Lester worked off and on for a vegetable canning company in Redkey (Mae peeled tomatoes there in the summers). He was a big fan of the St. Louis Cardinals, and he enjoyed listening to their radio broadcasts, an empty two-pound Folger’s coffee can standing beside his squeaky rocker for his well-aimed tobacco spit. To get a fair image of Aunt Mae and Uncle Lester, think of Aunt Loweezy and Snuffy Smith. Or, perhaps, Ma and Pa Kettle.\n\nLester disliked my father, probably because of his incessant chatter, which sometimes drowned out his ball game. Dad was also a know-it-all (even when he knew nothing), which further annoyed my uncle. After I had gone off to college he finally ordered Dad to get the hell out of the living room. The visits became far fewer after that.\n\nAunt Mae was a wonderful cook of the old-fashioned, country kind, and whenever we visited there was always an enormous platter of fried chicken (killed the same day by wringing their necks by hand), huge bowls of mashed potatoes and gravy, wonderful-tasting green beans fresh from the garden (in summer), her own canned pickles and beets, and two or three different kinds of pie. This was all cooked on a wood-burning stove, an appliance I adore to this day. The most poignant memory of all this, however, is that she never sat down until everyone else was almost finished, but hovered around making sure everyone had what he or she wanted, filling milk glasses and coffee mugs. Her selflessness made an enormous impact on me at a young age and, while I have never been able to match it, she is still the model I try to emulate.\n\nAlmost as memorable was the old pump organ in the corner of the living room. It smelled musty and didn’t sound quite right, but to my pre-adolescent and teenage sensibilities it was a complex and beautiful instrument. I would often play gibberish on it, dreaming of the day I would know how to do it right. To my great amazement Mom could sit down at the organ (or a piano) and play a hymn or a popular song by ear. That, too, made a big impression on me: how did she do that?\n\nMae and Lester moved a lot, but it was always to somewhere out in the country. One of these places had a big sugar pear tree (the fruit was exquisitely sweet) out front. It was here that I sometimes discovered cousin Patty Ann and her boyfriend Walter necking in the kitchen (they’ve been married now for more than half a century). Pat’s younger brother, cousin Dick, was a year older than I. When he talked or sang he sounded like Gene Pitney, still my favorite country singer.\n\nThere was also a field with a cow named Cherry, whose huge eyes, rough tongue, and sweet breath seemed like the essence of life itself. I used to offer her grass through the fence (I was afraid to climb over), until Dick traded her for a friendly pony called Roany.\n\nTheir favorite place, I think, before infirmity drove them into the nearby town of Portland, was a big brick house, surrounded by alfalfa and cornfields, near New Mount Pleasant. This was always referred to as the brick (as in: When we lived in the brick…). Besides the inevitable chickens, there was another cow or two and an outhouse well-supplied with Sears catalogues, as well as chamber pots in the upstairs bedrooms. It was there that Mom and Aunt Mae lanced the boils I was afflicted with during puberty. Though I couldn’t see them (they were always on my tush), I still get the shivers when I remember their cheerfully reporting that when they pushed or pulled on one, matter would ooze from another several inches away.\n\nDespite this minor trauma, I, too, loved the brick. You came in through the laundry room (with a sink, tub, and washboard), which somehow imparted a fresh, soapy fragrance to the rest of the house. On a kitchen counter stood a bucket of cold water, recently pumped from the well just outside, which tasted faintly of iron. A dipper hung nearby. A drink of water like that always takes me back to Aunt Mae’s kitchen.\n\nMy mother was just a housewife (as she described herself), who claimed she was born at 11:00 A.M. on 11/11/11. In all the years I knew her she wore print dresses exclusively—except later in life to church on Sundays—never slacks and certainly never shorts, or even a skirt. She was a creature of unvarying routine: Monday was washday (on the stove bubbled a huge pot of Great Northern beans with a couple of hambones); sprinkling and ironing came on Tuesday; mending and darning on Wednesday or until everything was repaired; cooking and cleaning every day.\n\nDespite her adeptness at the keyboard, Mom may have been retarded. When we went to a movie she would ask me to count the change and make sure it was right. We entered the theater whenever we got there. At some point she would ask us, Is this where we came in? and we would reluctantly shuffle through the Necco Wafers wrappers and Milk Duds boxes to the aisle and stagger uphill to the exit, looking over our shoulders at the screen. If she hadn’t paid enough attention, we got to see whole stretches of the film twice.\n\nShe didn’t drive because it was too complicated and she was too nervous. She could no more balance a checkbook than she could fly around the block, and didn’t know the difference between a city and a state. She could never pronounce certain words. And she was uncommonly superstitious: we weren’t allowed to rock an empty rocking chair, for example, as it signified that someone was about to die.\n\nI attributed her mental insufficiency to brain damage incurred during a near-death experience resulting from her choking on an apple peel, a story she related countless times, beginning when I was five or six. She turned blue, she colorfully reminded me, while the world turned black. The only reason she was alive, she reckoned, was that her mother stuck her finger down her throat and forced her to throw it up. In order to understand what that might have been like, I held my breath as long as I could. It felt terrible; I wanted no part of death or even near-death. I wasn’t able to eat an apple, or tomato, or anything else with a skin on it, for years. (I would clandestinely peel these fruits with my teeth and deposit the skins in a comic book I was reading or hiding behind. When the fossils were discovered, sometimes much later, they would elicit outraged laughter.)\n\nOnce in particular I remember walking home from school for lunch (though I usually carried a little container with a lunchmeat sandwich, potato chips, milk, and Twinkies or a little packaged pie inside) and finding a plate of Great Northern beans waiting for me on the kitchen table. Because they were enclosed in chokeable skins, I couldn’t eat them. Nor could I tell her why without broaching the subject of my phobia, and being sucked back into the same black hole I was trying to escape from. Of course she was worried about me, thinking I must be sick. For my part, I was both terrified and profoundly saddened by the whole episode because she had prepared what she thought was a nice lunch for me and I wouldn’t touch it.\n\nIt was about this time that I suffered my first genuine panic attack. Everyone in the school was taken to the big room at the center of the building, a chairless auditorium with a stage at the end, where we were shown a film on tuberculosis. In those days TB was far more prevalent than it is now (though it’s making a comeback), and the authorities thought we should know all about it in detail. I remember sitting on the floor staring wide-eyed at the germs, depicted as large, multi-legged creatures with eyes, as they were transferred from one person to another by a shared spoon or drinking glass. The crawly black bugs multiplied in the victim’s lungs, which eventually resulted in blood being coughed up into the victim’s handkerchief. That was more than I could take, and I dissociated myself from the terror, as well as everything else around me. I could barely hear the sound of the film, if at all. Not only was I certain that TB was my fate (I had eaten or drunk after my mother or sister many times), I could already feel the vile organisms wriggling around in my lungs. I hyperventilated, felt increasingly lightheaded, became totally withdrawn somewhere inside myself, and avoided passing out only by strength of will. It was an experience that was to repeat itself many times in those early years and well into adulthood.\n\nI finally returned to reality when the lights came back on, but now, sixty years later, the memory of that ordeal remains crystal clear in my mind. Again, I was afraid to tell anyone about the experience, perhaps because I sensed that there was nothing anyone could do to help, least of all my seemingly ineffectual parents. I knew I would have to learn to deal with this underlying fear on my own, then and for the rest of my (horrifyingly short, I presumed) life.\n\nAnother phobia she managed to instill in me was that of German shepherds. Before my first professional haircut we passed one of the breed on the way to the barber shop. If you cry, I’m going to let that dog get you, she threatened. I had no intention of crying—I thought of it as an adventure—but I was very much afraid to leave the shop afterward (fortunately, the dog was gone).\n\nIt was probably the latter incident that precipitated a persistent childhood dream. A pack of wolves, or similar toothy animals, was in pursuit. I tried to get to the steps leading up to the back porch, but my feet were treading something like molasses. I struggled hard but the beasts (German shepherds?) were catching up with me. Fortunately, I always woke up before their fangs sunk in.\n\nMom suffered all her days from an implacable fear of the elements. Terrified of thunderstorms, she would unplug every lamp and appliance in the house and refuse to answer the phone at the first rumble of distant thunder. She worried ceaselessly about the prospect of tornadoes. If we encountered a snowstorm or slippery road while driving, she became rigid, started to wail, and made Dad pull over until it stopped snowing, or slow to a crawl on the tiniest patch of ice.\n\nAs if that weren’t enough, she also harbored a severe social anxiety. The curtains and drapes were usually kept closed. When a car came up the driveway she would peek through the blinds and, if it was a stranger, admonish us to be quiet and pretend nobody was home. If she was forced into a social situation she smiled and nodded, but was otherwise tongue-tied. She was comfortable only with her immediate family and among familiar objects.\n\nBut if Mom taught me fear and anxiety, she also exerted a profoundly positive influence on my life. One afternoon, when I stepped on a sidewalk ant, she informed me (with tongue in cheek, perhaps—she herself killed flies without mercy) that the dead insect might have been somebody’s mother. Whatever her motive, it was an epiphany for me, and led me to think about the other creatures inhabiting the Earth and whether they had lives and feelings, and perhaps to examine more carefully other preconceived notions I held about everyday existence. Not long after that we went to see Bambi, which reinforced and expanded my sense of empathy toward the fate of wild, as well as domestic, animals. Having no apparent alternative, I nevertheless continued to eat the meat provided at every meal, and stifled my concern about how the animals in the refrigerator had died and the families they left behind.\n\nAnother determinant was her tale (repeated many times) of a railroad worker who ate his lunch way down the tracks from everybody else. Someone sneaked up behind him once to see what was in his paper bag. It was orange peelings—that was all he had to eat. From that time on, the word eat itself made me sad—it conjured up images of people who didn’t have anything—and I still dislike eating in front of anyone who isn’t sharing the meal, at a sidewalk café, for instance, where hungry people might be walking by.\n\nAlthough she would never admit or even understand it, Mom was firmly prejudiced (so was Dad, but more subtly). She was disgusted with the Catholics, who can do anything they want to on Saturday night as long as they confess the next day. Never mind that this strategy essentially applied to Protestants as well. She informed me once, with absolute conviction, that the colored high school players stunk to high heaven after a basketball game (how she obtained this information was a mystery to me). Probably her favorite story, reiterated at least twice a year, was about a fat old colored woman who came into a hardware store looking for a washtub because, according to Mom, I splattuh so. And there was a well-known black policeman in Muncie who had, in fact, been a basketball star at Muncie Central, Jack Mann. Mom resented the way he directed traffic with confident authority. Look at him. Ain’t he briggy (cocky)?\n\nIn addition to her word creations, there were many homilies of unknown origin. If one of us was crying about something, she would remind us that The more you cry, the less you’ll pee. He don’t buy me no peanuts, was reserved for those to whom she owed nothing, but who nevertheless wanted something from her. When she was annoyed by someone, she would advise him to Go flip sand up a rathole. If we misbehaved, she was prepared to jerk a knot in our tails. And she delighted in posing the following conundrum: Would you rather climb a ladder of knives or swim a river of snot?\n\nMy father’s family was vastly different. Grandpa was a glassblower at Ball Brothers and elsewhere around the state. According to Dad, he once won a citation from the governor of Kansas (his family came from there) for figuring out how high the water in a bucket would rise when a ball of a certain size was tossed into it. I only knew him when he was old and, with his stiff white hair, looked even older. Worn out, I surmised. My paternal grandmother was one of those stern, no-nonsense matriarchs who raised her ten children without allowing any guff.\n\nWhen I was growing up, Uncles Bob and Don, as well as Aunts Diana and Orpha, still lived at home, a crumbling yellow brick house in an old neighborhood not far from the center of town. I rarely saw the not-so-young women in anything other than a bathrobe.\n\nA favorite family picture is of Bob and Don in their army uniforms, both smiling and handsome. Bob came out of the war an abusive alcoholic married to a French woman; Don a neurotic disaster. Aunt Mary’s boyfriend never came back at all.\n\nOther than Uncle Don, I never got to know my aunts and uncles very well (they almost never visited us), but most seemed a little nutty to me. Uncle Bill, for example, turned virtually his entire backyard into a get-rich scheme—a pit for growing fishing worms—that quickly failed. (His younger son, after being routinely dressed as a girl by his mother, actually ended up in a mental institution.) Much later, when Aunt Diana died, she left 26 dogs and cats behind. And I once watched my Aunt Orpha freak out because she thought she had swallowed a fly. Such is the nature of my paternal genes.\n\nDad was the most boring person I ever knew. On the street, whenever we met someone he knew, he would talk and talk and talk, primarily about himself, while both his victim (as I thought of him) and I shuffled our feet and desperately sought a chance to get away. He had no real friends, no one he would, or could, socialize with.\n\nI vowed at an early age never to talk about myself except when someone asked me something specific, and then to answer succinctly. Instead, I made it a point to listen to what other people had to say and to encourage them to speak about their own lives, which, I discovered, most people very much like to do. I became popular (well-liked, one teacher wrote) as a result of this program. Not because of any natural gregariousness or interest in other people, but because I tried hard to divert attention away from myself. I never sought popularity; I just didn’t want to be thought of as dull, like my father. At home, on the other hand, I was a little shit, pushing my siblings around, making demands. I suppose I just couldn’t maintain the nice façade twenty-four hours a day, needed a pressure relief valve.\n\nAs a bonus, listening to others probably forced me to notice facial expression, mannerism, body language, and all the rest, and equate these with feelings. On the downside, however, I found it difficult, with so little speaking experience, to organize and elaborate my thoughts in such a way as to present them in an orderly manner.\n\nTo his family Dad was cold and unsympathetic. I don’t recall ever getting a kiss or a hug or even a pat on the back from him until he was old and sick, or even a simple expression of gratitude if we brought him something (except for a distorted \"Thank you, sir,\" or the like). It was as if it embarrassed him to engage in any kind of normal interaction.\n\nEmpathy was a foreign concept to him. If we were sick or hurt he would seem more angry than concerned. His view of accidents was that there weren’t any. If we broke something, his response would be an angry or disbelieving, \"Now why did you do that?\" The verbal abuse led to a fear of committing an error and, eventually, I learned to hide mistakes and stifle my emotions, so as not to anger or upset him. He seemed almost a father manqué, as though he became a parent because he thought he was supposed to, or it came with the sex act, but he didn’t know how to follow it up.\n\nPraise from Dad was rare and precious. Even when I did something right, I could never please him enough. I felt a need to accomplish more than was possible in order to satisfy the desire for approval, but no matter how much I got I wanted more. It became almost impossible even to please myself.\n\nHe also displayed a number of hang-ups which I never understood and still don’t (Dad might lecture you for an hour, but you didn’t discuss anything with him). For example, he was violently opposed to the consumption of alcohol, invariably referring to taverns and bars as beer joints. He never mentioned sex, and I never saw him undressed, or even his knees. Rightly or wrongly, the possibility occurred to me later in life that his father, the glassblowing math whiz (or someone else) might have been an alcoholic and/or abused him.\n\nDad had a terrible temper and sometimes kicked inanimate objects. When he was frustrated about some little job he was doing he would whine, Why doesn’t anything ever go right? On the other hand he rarely swore, and even then his vocabulary was limited to two words: Damnation! and damnable, as in You damnable thing! Never a goddamn, or even a damn, or anything else. (My mother, on the other hand, was particularly fond of the word shit, or sometimes, in frustration, Shitawiggle! And she occasionally called us boys Fuzznuts.)\n\nAnd he could be incredibly stubborn. When he was going into the eighth grade, my grandparents moved to a different town and, for some reason, he was mistakenly put back into the seventh. Rather than explain the situation, he pouted in the back row and refused to speak. So, assuming he was an idiot, the teacher kept him there another year. He finally got promoted, but finally left school in the tenth grade to go to work on a farm (my mother didn’t get past the eighth).\n\nA blue-collar worker if there ever was one, and a strong believer in unions, Dad nevertheless remained a Republican until the day he died (Mom never voted at all). On election day in 1944, when I was in the second grade, the bigger kids roamed the playground demanding to know whether we small ones were Republicans or Democrats. After a couple of punches and arm twists, I changed my vote to Democrat. I didn’t make the same mistake in 1948 (in neither case did I have a clue as to what the difference between the two parties might be).\n\nBut if my father was difficult, unloving, embarrassing, and maybe a little crazy, he was also endowed with certain redeeming features. I don’t think he ever told a lie, and I simply never learned, from him or Mom, how to be devious or disingenuous. He once saved cousin Dick’s foot from amputation by insisting that Lester take him to a doctor (on a Sunday) when it became gangrenous after a farm accident. And if I inherited a scientific bent from anyone, it was Dad. He knew things like the speeds of light and sound, and explained that the moon revolved around the Earth, and the planets around the sun, which was really just a star like all the millions in the firmament. Whenever I looked up into the night sky I was filled with wonder. Where did all of this come from? Had my parents been religious I might have turned to theology, as did some of my numerous cousins. But God was rarely mentioned in our house, and there was no praying at meals or at bedtime. Without that countervailing impetus, I was certain, from my earliest years, that I would become a scientist.\n\nAt the same time, his plodding interest in the nuts and bolts of mechanical objects turned me off entirely from that aspect of the sciences, perhaps because it made them into something mundane and—yes, boring—in his rough, oil-stained hands, whose nails were perpetually tattooed with little blue-black crescents where they had been hammered by tools and gears. To this day I wonder if current science popularizers are on the wrong track by focusing, as they tend to do, on everyday objects, and things you can do in your own backyard. That approach would have distanced me completely from the wonders of it all. When I actually became a scientist I loved to plan experiments, carry them out, and wait impatiently for the results, but was bored to the point of nausea by the mechanics of the instruments I had to use, undoubtedly to my detriment.\n\nSaturday night was bath and Grand Ole Opry night. For years we listened to the big Philco as we paraded into the bathroom and then to bed, our hair reeking of vinegar. Later, on a cold and intensely exciting February evening, the whole family went to the Masonic Temple for a live stage show featuring Roy Acuff, Little Jimmy Dickens, and Minnie Pearl, among others. I was thrilled: it was the first time I had ever seen anyone famous. It was there that the enthusiastic audience may have planted the seeds which later germinated into a craving for wide attention and appreciation in order to obtain the approval from others that I didn’t get from my father.\n\nAs far as I could see, the biggest difference between the war and post-war years was that after it was over we could get bubble gum. It meant standing in a long line, but for a penny a kid could get a sweet, rubbery ball (it was round then) of Fleers wrapped in colorful paper and a tiny cartoon. I’d never tasted it before—it was delicious. Since supplies were so limited Nan and I kept ours going for days or weeks, parking it on the bedpost at night. It was gray and tasteless and rock-hard in the morning, but we could still soften it up enough to blow bubbles with it.\n\nThere was a girl in the first grade, Nancy McDonald, whom I admired from a distance. She had pale, blonde, curly hair and blue-grey eyes, which, with her polka-dotted dresses, gave her quite a striking appearance. My infatuation ended abruptly when she threw up in class. Vomiting, closely associated with choking to death in my mind, was something I simply couldn’t cope with.\n\nA Popsicle machine stood outside the lunchroom. Sometimes, when I had a nickel knotted in my handkerchief, I would buy one. Despite my innate desire to share, I learned to get to a far corner of the auditorium or playground to eat it before one of the big boys would yell Dibs, and chomp out a huge bite, if not consume the whole thing. Where eating was concerned, taking was somehow different from not having.\n\nMost of the boys wore clodhoppers with metal plates nailed to the heels, which made hundreds of snappy clicks when we clomped out through the auditorium for recess. On the playground we could choose from baseball or basketball (boys), kickball (mostly girls), and marbles (boys). When you knocked another marble out of a circle drawn in the dirt, you could keep shooting until you missed. I had a beautiful sky-blue shooter, layered inside with white clouds, that I loved. I lost it one day and never found one that could begin to replace it. I’m still looking.\n\nWe rode the city bus everywhere (except to the west side—there was nothing there but rich people, the hospital, and Ball State Teachers College). My sister Nancy and I sometimes went shopping in town with Mom. I loved to pull the string to signal the driver we wanted to get off. Later on, I created an amazingly satisfying fantasy in which, using a pie pan as a steering wheel, I would walk around the empty field to the west of the neighbors’ house, pretending to be a bus driver. Somehow this caught on, and other kids would wait for me to pick them up. I would stop and open the door (psssst), then close it (psssst) and drive on. Sometimes there would be several passengers trailing along behind me. When I got to college I wrote an essay about it for English 101.\n\nOne day the manager of the Rivoli Theater announced that the first twenty people to buy tickets for the upcoming The Yearling would receive a free phonograph. On the designated day I was first in line, and waited hours for the doors to open. The free gift turned out to be a photograph. I hid my dejection, of course, which was thoroughly exacerbated by the movie itself, surely one of the saddest in film history.\n\nBy the time I was eight I was allowed to ride the bus and go to movies by myself. On Saturdays I watched Frank Buck Bring ’Em Back Alive at the YMCA or Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Lash LaRue or Hopalong Cassidy capture the bad guys at the Wysor Grande, which also featured serials like Superman and Buck Rogers.\n\nOn the way home one day I got off the bus at Aunt Mag’s house (ten twenty-TWO, Kirby AveNUE). I vividly remember two images from the visit: one was watching her iron shirts with something called, appropriately, a mangle. I dearly wanted to try this hellish machine. Fortunately I repressed the urge, or maybe I couldn’t figure out how to turn it back on after she left the room. (A couple of years later I got my hand caught in the washer wringer and it pulled my arm clear up to the pit before Mom could rescue me.)\n\nThe other clear memory was of being put to bed that night, Aunt Mag kneeling at my bedside to pray for me. She trucked only with colored preachers, who had the fire, and was the only white person in the congregation. Her humble supplication seemed strange and made me very uncomfortable (our family didn’t pray), especially since it seemed to go on interminably.\n\nMy brother Bob was born (on Kirby Avenue, where Aunt Mag could again act as nurse/midwife) in 1942, and Larry (same place) in 1945. Mag died of a stroke, at age forty-five, not long after Larry’s birth and my only solo visit. It was my first direct experience with the nightmare of death. During the funeral my intense curiosity overcame my anxiety, and I left the front pew for a closer look at the body. I stood next to the casket, hyperventilating and feeling faint, checking her over for signs of breathing. There weren’t any. Her eyes seemed to be glued shut, and I knew they would never re-open. Though I well understood she was dead, her physical presence itself jolted me far more than the abstract concept of mortality. I tried to imagine the whole process from her point of view (what was it like to have died?). Unfortunately, I probably succeeded.\n\nGrades 4 and 5 were combined in one room under Mrs. Armstrong. In 1946 (fourth grade), Uncle Bob and his wife Yvonne came to the school to tell us something about France. When they arrived I was asked, without warning, to introduce them. I had no idea how people were introduced, or even that they were introduced. Breathlessly, my stomach churning, I came up with the unmemorable: This is my Uncle Bob. When he was in the war he married a French girl. That’s her. This was followed by much laughter, which embarrassed me even more. Nevertheless, my lovely Aunt Yvonne redeemed my awkwardness and made a gracious presentation. She taught us some French words and songs, and was a big hit with everyone.\n\nIn the fifth grade Mrs. Armstrong decided that Cynthia McAllister and I would write a play about the Pilgrims. She asked us if we knew how to use a typewriter. Cynthia said she did. So we sat in the back of the room and wrote it (I learned to type with one finger),"
