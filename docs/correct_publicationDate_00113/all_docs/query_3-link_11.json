The first book is tantalisingly ambiguous; the two sequels are just muddled extensions that spoil the original.\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\nI don't understand why there's a third book in the series. I'm not happy. I'd have stopped with the second book had I known what to expect in this third one.\n\n2.5 stars rounded up.\n\nWARNING: if you haven't read K-PAX nor On a Beam of Light, this review'll come with SPOILERS.\n\nFrom the start, I found a drag on the story and I wasn't that much thrilled to see Robert's story evolving that way. I'm no sucker for happy ending but I liked the end of the second book. I didn't think it was necessary to go any further.\n\nThis third book is not useful to the story, safe for the last chapter and the epilogue, although I've found the epilogue too open.\n\nJuly 31, 2023\n\nI have seen the movie and read this book kPax III, I can connect the dots. This story has been succesful to make a great impact on thecpopular culture. You can hear it in formal settings (documentaries, science books...) where the expression K-Pax predator still resonates in my memory.\n\nIn this sequel, we get to know the explanations according to how psychoanalysis sees it.\n\nQuiye enjoyable, quite a read.\n\nApril 25, 2020\n\nA satisfying enough end to the trilogy. Interesting albeit slightly stretched storyline, but with some valid points about the human kind on Earth.\n\nRead\n\nNovember 27, 2012\n\nK-PAX III: The Worlds of Prot by Gene Brewer completes the trilogy of prot–an alter identity of Robert Porter–who has relapsed after his remarkable recovery in On a Beam of Light. Unfortunately, K-PAX III seems to have been written only to fill out the trilogy. In fact, there’s very little story to be found.\n\nAs readers of the first two novels, we already know the fairly complex story of how prot came to be, and about Robert Porter’s tragic life. What’s not known completely, is whether prot is truly another life form, inhabiting Robert’s body, or–as Dr. Gene Brewer believes–another personality within Robert’s fragmented mind. In K-PAX III, the answer is revealed vaguely, but brings the series to a fairly satisfactory close. Readers will learn the truth about Robert, and the mystery of his traumatic upbringing, through the sometimes redundant work of Dr. Brewer.\n\nOverall, however, the book falls flat where it could have been marvelously entertaining. Instead of being charming and likable, prot is rather annoying and obnoxious. Dr. Brewer seems to realize this, too, since he becomes quite angry and agitated several times through the text.\n\nAnother problem in this volume is it tries too hard to carry a message. Gene Brewer seems to be trying to tell his readers that the world could be a better place if we all tried to make it one. While the message is a good one, and worthwhile exploring, the method used in K-PAX III becomes tiresome and preachy.\n\nDespite the bad, the plot picks up well, and climaxes satisfactorily, though the departure of prot–a huge event in the previous books–is a bit lackluster here. An epilogue fills us in on the events after prot’s final departure, and how it affects everyone he’s had contact with.\n\nK-PAX III didn’t live up to expectations set by the previous to books in the series. It seemed to have been written just to make a trilogy, not because it was entirely necessary to the story. The approach Brewer uses to narrate the story is rather confusing, considering he is not, in actuality, a psychiatrist. Readers will probably begin to wonder where the reality ends, and the story begins. Overall, it’s a disappointing outing from a promising author.\n\nFebruary 19, 2023\n\n3.5/5\n\nOnce again Brewer used the same plot device to close the book (prot leaving Earth for the last time), which at times felt like a rushed wrap up but I definitely enjoyed this installment more than the 2nd!\n\nThe whole K-Pax trilogy is a very easy read beginning to end so if you've got the time and the interest read the trilogy . Though I still think the first book could stand alone.\n\nOctober 10, 2023\n\nThis is the disappointing third entry to the K-PAX series. The title is also deceiving. I expected more 'worlds' than were presented.\n\nJuly 18, 2016\n\nIn comparison with previous books\n\n- prot converted from an alien to arrogant ecologist, atheist, anty-capitalist\n\n- dr gene became an ignorant\n\nAugust 15, 2023\n\nThere were a lot quips and one-liners that I found funny, original and heart-warming. When those popped up, I found myself happy to continue on. There were a lot of side characters to keep up with, but the patient's unique disorders, personalities, quirks and apparent recoveries were my favorite part of all three books. Knowing they were given endearingly, I liked the nicknames given in lieu of simply changing the names for privacy.\n\nI really enjoyed the transcript format and the banter was pronounced during those portions.\n\nComplicated ideas and themes were over-simplified but I think that was the point and I often find myself feeling the same way. We often over-complicate simple things so...\n\nI liked prot and dr. b better in the previous volumes. prot's confident mischievousness turned arrogant and condescending and dr. b's selfless approach turned into desperate, borderline sadistic techniques. dr. b also came across sort of clueless, grasping and impatient, the only redeemer being he admitted it most of the time.\n\nprot being anti-religion made me question his messiah parallel and I'm having a hard time getting over the last word of the epilogue being \"God\". We flipped between MPD or alien the entire time and I was happy with the science theme and leanings; I didn't want to be left with something akin to \"this could all be God's plan\".\n\nLike many others are saying, I think a stand alone book would've been better since the recapping became a nuisance. FYI - this was supposed to be an end to a trilogy but there are books IV and V. Is it possible to be dreadful and curious at the same time?\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nI trzeci tom również trzyma poziom dwóch poprzednich (lub też jest wtórny - jak kto woli ;) faktycznie to w zasadzie mogłaby być jedna długa książka, tym niemniej to niezła książka byłaby w całości). Jednoznacznego rozwiązania nie dostajemy na tacy nadal. I książka nadal daje do myślenia...\n\nNiektórzy krytykują opis wydawcy ale on jest, moim zdaniem, wcale nie taki zły ;) Prot jest jedną z wielokrotnych osobowości Roberta, chyba nie można temu zaprzeczyć... co wcale nie wyklucza tego, że jest kosmitą z K-Pax :D Jeśli nawet mnie udało się autorowi do tego przekonać, to dokonał czegoś niezwykłego :D\n\nCiekawym elementem książki jest raport Prota zamieszczony na końcu... Ale chyba mam inne co do niego wnioski niż inni czytelnicy ;) Bo gdzieśtam widziałem opinię, że raport jest zabawny... Naprawdę? Ironiczny? Eee... naprawdę myślicie, że ze wzrostem liczby ludności nie wiążą się żadne zagrożenia lub przynajmniej utrudnienia? ;)\n\n(czytana/słuchana: 3-4.04.2024)\n\n5/5 [8/10]\n\nAugust 26, 2023\n\nI liked this book. It read like non-fiction, but I know that prot doesn’t rally exist, nor does the planet K-PAX. What does exist is the reality that our planet is dying, and we all need to work together to heal it. All people matter, and should be treated with kindness and empathy. Religion does more to divide us, than bring us together. The wealthy will always have more than the rest of us, and will rarely share that wealth. Those are the beliefs this book reinforced in me.\n\nDecember 30, 2018\n\nBasically the same as the first two, however the ending was different. Hence being the final in the trilogy.\n\nJanuary 18, 2019\n\nAlthough the sequels spoiled the mystery of Prot being a real alien I loved the books and the back ground to the characters.\n\nApril 17, 2021\n\nAs a series, this is really a case of deminishing returns. In truth, this is a great idea repeated in each novel.\n\nMay 11, 2020\n\nK-PAX III: The Worlds of Prot (K-PAX #3) by Gene Brewer (Bloomsbury Publishing 2002) (Fiction - Science Fiction). Prot has returned to the Manhattan Institute of Psychiatry, and Robert has returned to his catatonic state. Prot avers that this will be his final visit to earth. Dr. Brewer is trying everything in an attempt to unravel the mysteries of this strange patient. Hysteria is the order of the day when Prot announces that he will be taking one hundred subjects with him when he returns to his distant planet K-PAX. The trouble is that all of the patients want to go with him. This is a remarkable conclusion to a wonderfully imaginative tale. My rating: 8/10, finished 2005.\n\nOctober 14, 2011\n\nI agree to some extent that this book was completely unnecessary. Usually I don't give spoilers, but in this case it's needed. The fact that Brewer chose to resolve the question of whether prot was \"really\" from K-PAX was weak and unnecessary. Also, to add on yet another level of Robert's pain seemed to be unnecessary and almost grasping. Finally, Brewer really beats you over the head with prot's philosophy in this one. Not that he didn't in the first two, Gene we get it okay?\n\nStill, I love the characters and I enjoyed the book. But I would have enjoyed the series more if there'd have just been the first two.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 22, 2014\n\nI did enjoy this novel, however it just felt a bit more rushed than the other two and didn't quite hold my attention as well. There were also a few loose ends - actions whose consequences were never revealed. Still an enjoyable novel though, but I think this is the end of the road for me when it comes to K-PAX novels as I've heard that the fourth book is not worth my time.\n\nFebruary 28, 2015\n\nConclusion de la trilogie K-Paxienne magnifique, toute en beauté, on joue encore sur l'ambiguité avec le personnage de Prot/Robert pour un adieu en douceur, bourré d'intrigues, de réflexions passionnantes. Vraiment triste que la suite de K-Pax n'ait jamais été traduite car cette trilogie vaut vraiment le détour et est, à mes yeux, de la très très bonne science fiction. A dévorer !\n\nSeptember 23, 2010\n\nI read the other two books quite a while ago but found this on my bookshelves whilst I was tidying them so thought I ought to read it.\n\nnot bad but not as good as the other two. Noticed there is a 4th out so will see if I can find a copy of that to read.\n\nJanuary 8, 2010\n\nWaste of time. Just read the first book and leave it at that.\n\nJune 20, 2010\n\nyou might not like the story BUT FOR THE PLANETARY MESSAGE everybody has to read these books\n\nNovember 25, 2012\n\nMy opinion of the second in the series is that the question was best left unanswered. This entry in the series did not change my opinion of that book.\n\nRead K-PAX and stop there.\n\nAugust 29, 2014\n\nI read the trilogy, but I have to say the third book didn't bring much more to the story.. I enjoyed the first 2 of the sequel..."
