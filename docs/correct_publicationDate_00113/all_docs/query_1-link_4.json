        "text": "May 6, 2021\n\n\"—Muy bien. Dígame, señor… disculpe, prot, ¿sabe por qué está aquí?\n\n—Naturalmente. Creen que estoy loco.\n\n—Yo prefiero el término «enfermo». ¿Cree que está enfermo?\n\n—Tal vez sienta un poco de nostalgia. Echo de menos mi hogar.\n\n—¿Y dónde está su hogar?\n\n—En K-PAX\n\nEntonces sonrió al darse cuenta de que yo ya sabía que creía proceder de otro mundo. Pero dijo simplemente:\n\n—K-PAX es un PLANETA. Pero no se preocupe; no voy a comérmelo\"\n\n\"La mayoría de los pacientes que tienen delirios se sienten tan confusos que balbucean o tartamudean cuando intentan responder a las preguntas complejas con coherencia. Pero éste además de conocer una serie de temas misteriosos tenía la confianza suficiente para exponer lo que sabía de un modo convincente(...)\n\nme he encontrado con muchos pacientes que han sido capaces de hacer cosas sorprendentes que no podían hacer antes de caer enfermos. Y ahora aparece un hombre que cree proceder de un planeta en el que la gente es más sensible a la luz que nosotros. En momentos como ése uno se pregunta dónde están los límites de la mente humana\"\n\nUna hermosa historia, sumamente emocional y que te pone a volar la imaginación. Maravillosamente narrada y construida. Con un protagonista totalmente carismático y entrañable.\n\nMi primer acercamiento con esta historia fue a través de su adaptación cinematográfica, hace varios años. la cual me encanto, y ahora tras leer la novela original, antecesora, debo decir que es bastante fiel, Aunque por obvias razones la novela indaga mas en diversos aspectos.\n\n*Ojala fuésemos todos un poco k-paxianos y nuestra sociedad y paradigmas se asemejaran un poco con los de K-PAX\n\nJuly 17, 2016\n\nI remember seeing the movie version of this book some years ago, and while reading I could easily picture Kevin Spacey as prot (rhymes with goat). The book was quick to read, very compelling, with interesting and realistic characters. I thought the details of the planet K-PAX were fascinating, and I was left hoping that there really is such a place. Sorry to be so short here, but I am in a hurry to get back to the sequel, On a Beam of Light. Must find out what happens next!\n\nApril 22, 2019\n\nWhat a delightful read!\n\nThere is a clever beauty about this book that deals with belief, or rather suspension of disbelief, because the way it is written, the reader must pass judgement on 2 levels:\n\n1) The book is written in non-fiction style, as if this was a true case history from a professional psychiatrist. Is it, or is it a work of fiction?\n\n2) If fiction, is the the character Prot really a visitor from the planet K-PAX? (actually his name is prot, because names are not capitalized on K-Pax, except for celestial things like PLANETS and STARS)\n\nBoth of these questions operate throughout most of the book, although one question is resolved towards the end (not saying anything more - you'll have to read it to find the answer!) Of course if you've seen the film (DON'T IF YOU HAVEN'T YET AND YOU PLAN TO READ THE BOOK) then you know already. But do you know, really? Is prot a corporeal being, or some other metaphysical entity?\n\nObviously, I read the book, but I admit that I still don't know the answer to that question.\n\nYou decide.\n\nAugust 8, 2016\n\nA superb book. Combines typical SF elements brewed with mainstream Psychology and Psychiatry.\n\nThe book made me realize that as much as we can at several times put our psyche to be responsible for various things, there is eventually still a limit to understanding the psychology of a human being by a human being. IT GOES WAY BEYOND, ... UNDOUBTEDLY !!\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nMay 28, 2015\n\nI saw the movie before reading the book. I didn't know the book existed at first. Anyway, I would go to the theater down from where I lived. I saw the movie four times! I went to the theater to see it the last three times by myself!\n\nAlas, this isn't a movie review...\n\nThen I came across the book in the bookstore (of all places), and read it. I read the book a second time (I love rereading books or rewatching movies). I'm rereading it for the third time. I recommend that if you have it, read it! If you don't have it, then you should obviously get it!\n\nFebruary 15, 2019\n\nI really enjoyed this. I'm still not certain, however, if Prot really was a visitor from another world or not (I'm leaning towards \"yes\").\n\nOctober 19, 2012\n\nPsychiatrist Gene Brewer begins therapy with a new patient named Prot. During therapy, Prot makes a convincing argument that he is an alien from the plant K-PAX. Can it be so simple that Prot is an alien? Or is there something more to the story? What follows is a suspenseful journey to discover Prot's true identity.\n\nThis would have been a good book if it had not been for a few strikes that I have against it. The first strike is that I saw the movie based on this book a long time ago, so I already knew what was going to happen, who Prot really was, and therefore found nary a suspenseful moment in the book.\n\nThe second strike against this book is that I have recently read, \"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,\" which is a book very similar to \"K-PAX\" in plot, except that \"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,\" is a superior book in every possible way.\n\nThe psychiatrist, Gene, in \"K-PAX\" is boring, and makes no insightful comments. In fact, Gene's background, family life, and deepest feelings are often related to the reader all throughout the book, even though such information is not in any way interesting. Gene is just not interesting.\n\nThe dialogue between therapist and patient is not sharp and clever, filled with occasionally brilliant moments like it was in, \"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,\" but instead, it was lumbering and dull.\n\nThe mental health details in the book appear to have been hastily researched, and though there was an opportunity for the book's author to get inside of the head of Prot and show the reader the mind of a mental patient (as was so brilliantly done in, \"I never Promised You a Rose Garden,\") the author dropped the ball. I know nothing about the workings of Prot's mind, even though I did read what was supposedly hours of his therapy.\n\nThe quality of the book's writing is grade B, the dialogue is dull and the characters are not well rounded or interesting. This book is a quick read, and what keeps the pages turning is the question of who Prot really is--which is why once you do know who Prot is the book ceases to be interesting. It was still a fun read though. Although if I had to recommend a book about mentally ill patients working with their therapists to resolve mental health issues, I would totally suggest, \"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.\"\n\nSeptember 3, 2016\n\nDelicioso. Tierno. Entrañable.\n\nAgotados los calificativos “moñas” que demuestran que soy más tierno que el día de la madre, deciros que este libro se puede leer en cualquier momento para que esos tres calificativos nos impacten de lleno.\n\nEl protagonista de la novela, “prot” se llama, es un loco o un extraterrestre. Eso no lo sabréis –si llegáis a saberlo, no hago ni ese spoiler- hasta el final de la novela. Y en el psiquiátrico le trata un psiquiatra comprensivo.\n\n¿Os suena a algo el rollito paciente guay versus psiquiatra guay?. A mí, desde el comienzo, me sonaba a Los renglones torcidos de Dios, de Torcuato Luca de Tena. Y yo diría que tiene muchas, muchas semejanzas. Si leísteis ese último y os gustó seguro que este de K-PAX también os va a gustar.\n\nLos dos personajes principales (prot y su psiquiatra) están muy logrados e incluso los secundarios (resto de locos del lugar) tb tiene su interés. Hechos a pinceladas, pero bonitas pinceladas.\n\nUn placer leer este libro. 8,75/10, y como pasa del 8 pues le caen las 5 estrellas. Hale.\n\nMarch 14, 2015\n\nI was torn about how to rate this one so I left it for a while. Now, a week on, I barely remember most of the details, which I think shows that it wasn't amazing, although it was definitely a fast-paced and interesting read.\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of Gene Brewer, a psychiatrist at a hospital in New York, who encounters prot - a man who insists that he is an alien from the distant planet K-PAX. Despite the fact that prot displays a range of unusual abilities and knowledge, Gene knows that he can't actually be an alien and so goes about trying to trace his past. In the mean time, prot begins to affect the mood of the other residents in the hospital by promising them that he will take one of them back with him when he returns to the utopia of K-PAX.\n\nI'd seen the film of the book with Kevin Spacey ages ago and really enjoyed it. I read the book because it came highly recommended and usually books give more depth than films, however, I felt that the book didn't offer much more than the film in terms of the depth of the characters or the richness of the plot and setting. It was interesting all the way through and contained some entertaining digressions about scientific topics (neurology, astronomy, psychology, etc) that might have been obscure at the time the book was written 20 years ago but are now well understood even by non-scientists.\n\nI think I would recommend it as a good 'beach read', easy to read an entertaining, but not hugely memorable.\n\nFebruary 1, 2015\n\nThe first book of the year for UK IT book club and what a cracker! I was a little bit dubious (as I always am) when it comes to sci-fi, but this is a great story. Set in a Manhattan psychiatric institute, it's based round a character called prot, who claims to be from the far distant planet of K-PAX. Where everything is better than it is on Earth. Doctor Brewer does his utmost to be to the bottom of prot's story. But does he fathom it out by the time prot is scheduled to return home? Well written, nice pace, a worthy 5* book imho.\n\nJune 12, 2019\n\n2.5 maybe. Easy read, but mostly naive. I wanted sci-fi and got psych-fi... Oh well.\n\n+ Environmental protection aspects\n\n+ Interesting premise\n\n- The psychiatrist sounds like he just finished his undergrad degree and has been practising for maybe a year, not 30.\n\n- Acupuncture bit...\n\n- Simplistic/Lay approach to mental health\n\nAugust 28, 2015\n\nSecond reading and still as entertaining. Well polished writing and solid plot balanced with a well-written protagonist. The psychological content is also well-executed. Nothing literary about this book, but by far one of the much better entertainment fictions out there.\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nprot is the most likeable character. Everyone likes him in the book and you would too and so do I!\n\nI loved the movie and couldn't depart from Kevin Spacey as the looks of prot but other than that, the book is better in many regards.\n\nThe question of whether prot is really from K-PAX or deserves his place in the psych hospital is thrilling. The choice made to write the story as the sessions makes it somehow slow to read and its the only negative point I've to report.\n\nI'm utterly curious to see why there's a second book and why it is actually a series 🤔\n\nApril 25, 2014\n\nprot (lower case ‘p’) insists that he’s from the planet K-PAX in the constellation of Lyra. As you might expect, prot is locked up in a New York Psychiatric hospital, and it falls to Dr Gene Brewer (the author, in other words) to solve the mystery of prot’s identity.\n\n‘No-one believes I’m an alien’ (apart from the fact that it would be a fab title for a Jerry Springer show, and it’s a shame Dr Brewer never worked this into the book) or ‘the alien in human form’ is a staple SF device which, although handled competently here breaks very little new ground.\n\nDr Brewer, of course, considers prot to be a delusional amnesiac, and goes into partnership with a reporter in attempt to discover prot’s true identity before his planned return to K-PAX on August 17 at 3.31 am on a beam of light.\n\nIt’s a lightweight easy read, but suffers in that the reader is inevitably convinced throughout that prot is telling the truth. He demonstrates, for instance, knowledge of the area of space from which he comes which the doctor is assured he could not possibly know. In the course of the book he manages to cure several of the hospital’s patients, translates whale-song into English and Hamlet into pax-o (the language of K-PAX), and is proved to be able to see light in the ultra-violet range.\n\nThis may not sway the sceptical Dr Brewer, but it convinced me.\n\nIt would have been a far better novel if the true nature of prot were ambivalent and less obvious. There’s some decent characterisation here and there, but many people come across as two-dimensional in a severely linear story which holds few surprises.\n\nThere was a film starring Kevin Spacey, which didn't set the cinema world alight, and there’s a sequel or two which I’m not, I confess, straining at the leash to buy copies of.\n\nDerivative pap.\n\nJuly 24, 2019\n\nAs always, the book is much better, more detailed than the movie. If you liked the movie, you have to read the book too!\n\nMarch 27, 2018\n\nDamn, that ending! Now I'm looking up theories and explanations for it because [don't read the spoiler if you plan to read this book]I'm on the wall, unable to decide whether prot is an alien or just a human who has a psychological condition like Multiple Personality Disorder as a result of trauma.\n\nRTC.\n\nApril 15, 2023\n\nI gave this 4 stars, which is an emotional rather than a literary endorsement. I loved the book, shades of Stranger in a Strange Land (etc), loved the idea, loved the magic but… I’m a psychotherapist. Nuff said.\n\nDecember 28, 2023\n\nI think just about everyone in our family has read this now. It has universal appeal! It was a good book. Easy to read, engaging and keeps you guessing all the way through. I still don't know the answer but maybe vol 2 and 3 will help!\n\nSeptember 23, 2015\n\nK-PAX: Finally, A Science Fiction Masterpiece That “Could Happen”\n\n“He calls himself prot (rhymes with goat). Is he man, alien or savior?”\n\nFirst of all, let me say what a truly suspenseful and awesome beach read this is! Wow! I saw the movie poster at the theater in 2001 when the film came out. My dad rented it on VHS, and rented Dune—Frank Herbert’s science fiction masterpiece—a little later on, also on VHS. My dad was always a big fan of horror-type sci-fi (called SF for short). He liked movies like the Alien series of horror films … you remember, Sigourney Weaver fighting aliens with acid blood that exploded out of peoples’ stomachs.\n\nEwe.\n\nAnd he liked Predator—you remember that one, Arnold Schwarzenegger fights a humanoid alien in the jungles of South America, and wins.\n\nSince then they have combined both series having the two creatures fight each other … just like on the hit video games.\n\nYuck.\n\nBut I never did share my dad’s interests wholly—except with K-PAX and Dune. (See my review for Frank Herbert’s book if that’s what you want; this review will focus on Gene Brewer’s wonderful little book). While most sci-fi concentrates on the “hard” sciences like physics or astronomy, K-PAX concentrates on the lighter “softer” sciences like sociology and psychology.\n\nThe movie poster shows a man wearing sunglasses and looking thoughtfully upward. The glasses have become a symbol for the story, like the weapon of the lightsaber in the Star Wars art.\n\nLet me say that K-PAX is more than a bestseller … it’s a phenomenon! Able to stand alone in spite of four sequels, the book works in nearly every level. It is a psychological thriller, a love story much like Starman, and a great sci-fi novel. I should say at the outset that I have not read the sequels, but I will be soon checking out On a Beam of Light, also by Brewer. Unlike authors like Ludlum and Clancy, Gene Brewer writes all his own books solely on his own, no collaboration. And what a good book it is!\n\nK-PAX concerns a perfectly reasonable man arrested by Manhattan police after giving “daffy” answers to the station interview questions. So they book him in a psych ward with a dozen other mental cases. Only he maintains his bizarre delusion (a fixed false belief) that he is from the planet K-PAX in the constellation Lyra. And he convinces all his fellow patients that he is really from outer space—and he is taking one of them back with him when he goes “home”!\n\nHis doctor, incidentally named Gene Brewer—probably to lend the story an autobiography-realistic-like feel—works diligently with him but finds himself more and more changed by this mysterious man who says he is from another world.\n\nK-PAX is a great deal like the concept of Heaven, except there’s no God there to commune with—only plenty of aliens. No government. No sex. No crying. No pain. No more war. No vice or sin of any kind. And it’s twilight all the time. Sounds nice, right? Well, Brewer makes a detailed thesis that there may really be a K-PAX paradise somewhere out there. He even includes an extensive glossary (!) and prot’s report to K-PAX(!)—this last can be found in the annotated screenplay available online, (I haven’t yet read it).\n\nBut I bought the movie starring Jeff Bridges as Gene’s character (remember him in Starman?) and Kevin Spacey (American Beauty) as prot—the mystery man. The movie is very good, though I will say some aspects of prot’s message change from the book. There’s even an allusion to Data from The Next Generation TV show (Star Trek). The soundtrack (see my review) also was very good presenting a very New Age relaxation feel that fit in with the themes of the book. The concepts of human failures, law failures, religion and governmental failures. People still hurt and clutch at straws. People still go to war. Why?\n\nWell, K-PAX proposes a very detailed and plausible answer. Thus this story—a man with a delusional thought that just won’t go away— could conceivably really happen. But reality would have to be stretched a little so stuff like having every possible mental illness manifested all in one hospital. And prot’s keen eyesight ability to see ultraviolet light and have a virtual encyclopedic knowledge of space all in his head.\n\nAnyway, the book is a very good beach read and one you’ll definitely not want to miss. I’m not going to spoil the ending but you will probably be either pleased, sad, or even angry. So I wholeheartedly encourage you to get out your Kindle and download this book. Or if you’re like me, go and buy a hard copy to read. You won’t be sorry you did.\n\nSo pleasant reading to you and yours. And thanks for stopping by!\n\n(Stay tuned as I track down the whole series and blast my way through).\n\nNovember 2, 2022\n\nMe platicaron mucho sobre la película, pero quise adentrarme con el libro antes de verla. Considero que está escrita de una forma muy ligera para su rápida lectura.\n\nMe gusta cómo se desarrolla el personaje de prot, la verdad toda la historia permite adentrarse en el mundo de K-PAX, sin embargo ese giro final me dejó muchas dudas, no todo es lo que parece según se dice, y en este caso me quedó más que claro.\n\nQuiero saber más de la historia, cuando vuelve prot qué sucederá?\n\nOctober 25, 2015\n\nEste libro puede resumirse en dos líneas: ¿y si existiera K-PAX? y aprovecha el momento.\n\nprot es un ser de otro planeta que acude en auxilio de su amigo Robert a lo largo de su vida, pero un día es internado y conoce a un doctor que trata de ayudarle mientras descubre poco a poco cosas sobre K-PAX sobre un mundo diferente… mejor.\n\nLa obra nos narra esas sesiones en las que nos hace dudar si prot es un alienígena o un enfermo mental… En el transcurso que le queda para su partida prot ayudará a los pacientes del centro, y al propio doctor a entender que la vida es demasiado preciosa para desaprovecharla. Siempre nos quedará esa duda de si prot es un kapaxiano...\n\nUn libro MUY recomendable.\n\nAugust 28, 2014\n\nI've wanted to read the book for years, to see what kind of novel (novela, really) could inspire such a magnificent film.\n\nNever got round to it. Until now.\n\nAnd wow! Beautiful. Poignant. So moving and subtle I wanted to believe!\n\nNot much else I can say, except that I cried when Howie saw the Bluebird of happiness!\n\nFebruary 20, 2019\n\nI read three of the now four stories in 2008:\n\nK-PAX I, which I gave 5*, my review here.\n\nK-PAX II, which I gave 3*, my review here.\n\nK-PAX III, which I gave 2*, my review here.\n\nApril 7, 2019\n\nFor once I preferred the movie.\n\nOctober 3, 2019\n\nThe story is told from the point of view of a psychiatrist at a hospital who is treating a patient who says he's from another planet. The patient describes a utopian world (of a sort that daily life involves little technology and the inhabitants just kind of wander through their days.) Wikipedia describes the book as science fiction. In this book (the first in a series), that is not clear. There are suggestive bits in the book which could mean the patient isn't merely delusional. However, in this book, the psychiatrist never concludes he's really an alien, there is no climax at which his alien nature is made definite, and the reader never sees another world except in statements made by the patient. At the end, the patient's body remains, but is different.\n\nA synopsis of the second book in the series says the alien(?) returns. But for review readers to understand, I must explain. At the end of K-PAX, it is found that a \"friend\" the patient has mentioned seems to be the patient (or at least that body.) When the patient disappears (with a number of items) from his room, the body is found in another room - in a catatonic state. The \"return\" is the body being no longer catatonic and once more saying he's an alien. In so far as we don't attribute this to delusion or multiple personalities, the \"science fiction\" seems to be a mind traveling between planets and entering someone else's body. But the patient has never suggested he doesn't travel in his own body. I don't find it any more satisfying that we're told that interstellar travel is done by tachyons - and has something to do with a flashlight and mirror.\n\nReaders who want logical consistency may find issues. For instance, the patient tells the doctor he arrived on Earth in Africa because Africa happened to be the part of Earth facing his planet at the time of arrival. While the patient was in the hospital, his body belonged to a man from Montana who had not been in Africa. So, are we to believe an alien arrived as a bodiless mind capable of wandering the Earth in that form - and then later somehow inhabited this body? And then using a flashlight and mirror helps the mind leave that body and travel to another planet?\n\nMarch 7, 2020\n\nI really enjoyed the movie K-PAX, and have rewatched it many times since it came out in 2001. I knew it was based on a book, but never had much interest in checking it out until now. I was afraid I wouldn't like it.\n\nBut it turns out, the book is pretty good, too! And the movie is a surprisingly faithful adaptation. Even the movie's minor characters are mostly all found in the book.\n\nMy only complaint is that Kevin Spacey's interpretation of Prot is far better than the audiobook narrator's in the audio production.\n\nAll in all, a compelling a thought-provoking exploration of possible extraterrestrials, and probably schizophrenia, with great social commentary and philosophy along the way.\n\nJune 3, 2019\n\nWeirdly took a long time for me to read it. At first I was hooked and then I didn't care. Strong resemblance to the movie, which I really enjoyed. While I want to know how it all ends, I don't want to read 4 more books, so I'll be giving the rest of them a pass."
