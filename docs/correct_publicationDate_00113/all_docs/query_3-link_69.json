        "text": "Gene Luen Yang is an American comic artist and writer whose graphic novel American Born Chinese was a 2006 finalist for the National Book Award in the young people's literature category,[1] the first graphic novel to be nominated for a National Book Award,[2] and was awarded the 2007 Members' Choice Award from the Asian American Literary Awards. It has also won the 2007 Michael L. Printz Award for young-adult literature,[3] a first for a graphic novel.[4]\n\nYang authored the first five graphic novel trilogies based on Avatar: The Last Airbender, in addition to \"Rebound\", Shells\", and \"Sisters\", which were written for Free Comic Book Day. The North and South trilogy was his last work for the Avatar: The Last Airbender graphic novels, after which his position as writer for the graphic novels was filled by Faith Erin Hicks.[5] He later returned to the franchise as artist for \"Sokka's Poem\", a short story released as part of the comic anthology Team Avatar Tales.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender works[]\n\nArtist[]\n\n\"Sokka's Poem\" (2019)\n\nWriter[]\n\nNorth and South (2016)\n\nSmoke and Shadow (2015)\n\n\"Sisters\" (2015)\n\n\"Shells\" (2014)\n\nThe Rift (2014)\n\n\"Rebound\" (2013)\n\nThe Search (2013)\n\nThe Promise (2012)\n\nAvatar: Braving the Elements credits[]\n\nGuest[]\n\n41. \"\"The Siege of the North, Part 2\" with Gene Leun Yang\"\n\nSelected other credits[]\n\nGraphic novels[]\n\nNew Superman (2016-2018)\n\nSuperman (2015-2016)\n\nThe Shadow Hero (2014)\n\nBoxers (2013)\n\nSaints (2013)\n\nLevel Up (2011)\n\nPrime Baby (2010)\n\nThe Eternal Smile (2009)\n\nAmerican Born Chinese (2006)\n\nAnimal Crackers (2004)\n\nBiographical information[]\n\nYang's drawings are created with what Scott McCloud refers to as a \"cheap tool bravado\", using everything from brushes to Sharpie markers to Pigma Micron pens to ballpoint pens.[6] His artwork has been shown in San Francisco's Cartoon Art Museum.[7] Following American Born Chinese, Yang wrote The Eternal Smile, a collection of three short stories in comics, done in collaboration with Derek Kirk Kim. His latest book is Prime Baby, originally serialized in The New York Times Magazine.[8] In 2011, Yang released Level Up, with art by Thien Pham.\n\nYang currently lives with his family in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he taught computer science at Bishop O'Dowd High School.[9] His father is an electrical engineer from Taiwan and his mother a programmer who grew up in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nYang's favorite character was originally Zuko,[10] but due to his work on The Rift trilogy, Toph Beifong became his new favorite.[11]\n\nYang is a huge fan of Faith Erin Hicks[12] and, following his decision to step down as writer on the Avatar graphic novels, encouraged her to take the job as his replacement.[13]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Jeff Yang (October 25, 2006).
