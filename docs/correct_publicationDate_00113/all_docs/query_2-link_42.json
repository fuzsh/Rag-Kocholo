        "meta_description": "Who is this man known only as Prot (Kevin Spacey)? Highly respected New York psychiatrist Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) asks himself this question after examining Prot, who claims to be from the planet K-Pax where residents can travel from planet to planet faster than the speed of light. Unable to solve the puzzle or diagnose his brilliant patient's mental status, the doctor calls in astro-physicists who are astounded by Prot's knowledge of astronomy. Meanwhile, Prot bonds with other patients and promises to take one of them with him when he returns to K-Pax. K-PAX will satisfy sci-fi and mystery fans as well as those who appreciate an imaginative story. Except for a disappointing ending, it could be a worthwhile movie experience for teenagers and adults.",

        "text": "According to Prot, there are no families on planet K-Pax and reproducing is a painful, unpleasant process void of any sexual desire. Workaholic Mark begins to see how bleak life would be without his wife and children. Prot seems to understand the loneliness and fears of his fellow patients, and draws them out of their mental isolation. A brief scene of a grisly murder and a violent reaction to a water sprinkler provide clues to Protâ€™s background. Hypnosis as a diagnostic tool results in tragic consequences. Free of sexual content and nudity, K-PAX disappoints only in its use of 11 obscenities. However, parents should also be aware that the subject of mental illness may not be appropriate for young viewers."
