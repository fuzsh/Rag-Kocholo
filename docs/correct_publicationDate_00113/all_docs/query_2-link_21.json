Prot with his alternative approach to the world; even has great success helping a few patients ease anxieties, give up delusions, relax anger, quit fears or drop obsessions so they can get nearer to discharge dates. Prot's true identity as a missing person \"Robert Porter\" of New Mexico is proven by a Sheriff. Robert Porter is unable to maintain his imagined identity and world as Prot, so he eventually collapses into a catatonic state.\n\nDiscussion of why people can be happier with delusions, but how they cant always be maintained and why the truth and reality must be found. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcbshzkvUs"
