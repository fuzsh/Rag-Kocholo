        "text": "In November, 2001, I was sued, along with almost everyone else connected with the film version of my novel K-PAX, for plagiarizing an Argentinean movie called Man Facing Southeast (the suit was later dismissed). At about the same time, dozens of letters arrived from fans asking where the ideas for the book/film originated. Together, these developments led me to ponder how my difficult life had led me to become a writer, and how I came to write K-PAX in particular. The resulting memoir includes excerpts from unpublished work, and ends with a chapter of advice for other would-be novelists.\n\nGene Brewer was born and raised in Muncie, Indiana. He obtained a B.A. (chemistry) from DePauw University and a Ph.D. (biochemistry) from the University of Wisconsin, and studied DNA replication and cell division at UW, St. Jude Children Research Hospital, and Case Western Reserve University. Dr. Brewer is the author of the acclaimed K-PAX trilogy; the memoir Creating K-PAX; a mystery novel, Murder on Spruce Island; a courtroom drama, Wrongful Death; an illustrated novel, Ben and I; and a mainstream novel, Watsonâ€™s God. K-PAX IV was published in 2007, and the final episode of the saga, K-PAX V, is due in 2014. He lives with his wife and mixed-breed dog in Vermont and New Brunswick. Hobbies include cosmology, jogging, music, and reading."
