        "text": "I knew K-pax was a sci-fi movie within the first minute. There were two clues. First, in New York, where there are like 500 homicides for every cop on the beat, not one, but two cops appear seconds after a petty thief steals a woman’s purse. Second, a non-violent, calm, articulate man who actually helped the lady is gathered together and sent off to a psychiatric hospital by these cops simply because he claims to be an alien. This, I realized, is an alternate universe movie where there are more cops than crime in Manhattan, and all constitutional protections have been removed, allowing cops to randomly commit people to psychiatric care on a whim. Also, the public health care system is suspiciously well funded.\n\nYes, Kevin Spacey outs himself as an alien. He’s not shy about it either. Quite matter of fact about it, confident that the Earthlings will place him in a cushy asylum instead of packing him off to Area 51 to be dissected. He gives copious amounts of information about space, abducts and then returns a patient or two and sends the head shrink on a wild goose chase in search of his true Earth identity.\n\nThere are strains of One Flew over the Cuckoo’s nest here and there, but there is not much depth to it. Kevin Spacey plays an alien in human skin reasonably well. He eats a banana with the skin on, so I guess he earned his salary.\n\nGood movies of this kind are ones that even at the end, make us wonder at what the truth is. “The man from Earth” gets it almost correct though it botches it at the literal last minute.\n\nK-pax doesn’t even try. Spacey has knowledge about … space … that clearly indicates something out of the ordinary (as in – he’s an alien) and Spacey and his gang routinely vanish and reappear from the fairly secure psychiatric hospital. It’s for this reason that K-Pax’s late breaking attempt to insert some doubt into the plot, suggesting that Spacey may not be an alien, but rather a rather down-to-Earth psychiatric patient, is laughable.\n\nIt’s like The man from Earth, but in reverse: K-Pax spends the bulk of the movie not caring about hiding things that clearly point to extra-dimensional, alien shenanigans, but then at the literal last minute says “Hey, hey, wait we are INTELLECTUAL! Look at the seeds of doubt we are expertly sowing”.\n\nI’m not saying it’s a bad movie. Spacey does quite well and the others aren’t bad, but it seems odd to me that the plot would show such a stark lack of self-confidence right at the end.\n\n3 hand a half stars out of 5"
