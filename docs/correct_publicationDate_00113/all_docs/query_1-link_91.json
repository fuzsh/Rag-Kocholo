        "text": "When a man who claims to be from outer space is brought into the Manhattan Institute, the mental ward seems to be just the place for him. However, this patient is unlike anyone psychiatrist Dr. Gene Brewer has met before. Clever, inscrutable and utterly charismatic, Robert Porter calls himself 'prot' and has no traceable background - but he claims that he is an inhabitant of the planet K-PAX, a perfect world without wars, government or religion, and where every being co-exists in harmony. It's not long before the other patients are hanging on prot's every word. And even Dr Brewer starts to find himself convinced... This omnibus edition contains all three of the K-PAX novels, plus a bonus story, prot's report, and is as witty, quirky and enlightening as we have come to expect of Brewer's wonderful characters."
