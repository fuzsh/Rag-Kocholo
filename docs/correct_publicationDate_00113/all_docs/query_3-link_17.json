        "text": "Dr. Gene Brewer recently attended the American Psychological Association (APA) Convention in Chicago. While at the conference he presented research from Memory & Attention Control Laboratory investigating the affect of acute pain on attention. For those who missed the talk or were unable to attend the conference, here is a copy of the talk.\n\nThank you to the APA for giving us an opportunity to discuss our research, and thank you as well to those who were in attendance.\n\nWith the closing of another great academic year we want to take a moment to say congratulations and highlight some of our graduating honor students. The three students we seek to honor are Aaron Cohen (second from left), Mohitha Obulasetty (right), and Krysten Sullivan (second from right).\n\nAaron’s honors thesis examined how motivation influences problem solving accuracy and metacognitive monitoring and control processes during problem solving.\n\nMohitha’s honors thesis examined how binaural beats augment sustained attention. Mohitha’s thesis was the first preregistered honors thesis from the MACLab!\n\nKrysten’s honors thesis examined how different confidence scales impacts recognition memory decision-making using signal detection parameters d’ and c.\n\nLast week local evening news reporter and weather anchor Kristy Siefkin visited the Memory and Attention Control Laboratory to talk with Gene Brewer about the Mandela Effect.\n\nThis post will be updated with the video segment after it airs, but in the meantime here are Kristy and Brian Kae of Fox 10 news wearing our new 256-electrode EGI caps.\n\nUpdate 7/27/2017: The segment aired on 7/24/2017 and here is a link to view the segment and write-up.\n\nThis video is a bit late to the party, but after much trial and error we have a product we would like to distribute.\n\nOnce a year Arizona State University hosts Night of the Open Door. This event is setup as a public outreach event that allows people to tour the campus and see the various projects that researchers, students, and staff are working on.\n\nThis is our second time participating in the event and we wanted to come up with a way to teach people about memory research. After some brain storming we thought a fun way to do so would be to show off virtual reality based research and do a real-time graphing demonstration.\n\nThe video will explain some of the details of the event and the task used. It will also explain how we created the graphs and captured the video. Ultimately, this video may be updated over time but we wanted to share it with everyone before the opportunity passed.\n\nA big thanks to our RAs Thomas Poniatowski, Shuangting Li, Jen Jondac, Wen Yu, Nowed Patwary, and Alex Pruneda. A special thanks to Kimberly Wingert for organizing setup and breakdown. A big tip of the hat to Derek Ellis for his technical support and work on the video. Lastly, a thanks to ASU for hosting the event and allowing us to take part.\n\nThis coming weekend members of the MAClab will be attending and presenting at Cognitive Neuroscience Society’s (2016) Annual Meeting in New York. Presenters will be Chris Blais (Research Faculty) and Blake Elliott (Undergraduate and future Fall 2016 graduate student). Gene Brewer, Director of the MAClab, will also be in attendance, so make sure to swing by and check out their posters. For those who cannot attend the posters they will be presenting are attached below.\n\nBlais: CNS_Poster1\n\nElliott: CNS_Poster2"
