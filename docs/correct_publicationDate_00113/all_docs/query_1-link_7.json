        "text": "Success for Stage Adaptation of K-PAX by Gene Brewer '59\n\nMarch 10, 2004\n\nMarch 10, 2004, Greencastle, Ind. - The stage adaptation of the novel, K-PAX, which was written by 1959 DePauw University graduate Gene Brewer, has just wrapped up its world premiere at the Lion and Unicorn Theatre in London, England. There are plans to stage the production at the Edinburgh Stage Festival in August of this year. K-PAX was made into a highly successful major motion picture, which starred Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges and opened #1 at the box office in October 2001.\n\nIndiana's Muncie Star Press (Brewer grew up in Muncie) writes of the play, and notes Brewer's DePauw degree (read the story here).\n\nIn a May 2, 2002 speech to the DePauw student chapter of the American Chemical Society, Gene Brewer credited DePauw with preparing him for a career as a scientist and for planting the seed that led him to writing. He told the students, \"I'm here to tell you that you can do anything and be anything you want to be. It really is true.\"\n\nRead more about his visit to campus in this previous story."
