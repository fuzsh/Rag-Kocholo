        "text": "Just read this and *wow*\n\nIt's a sci-fi book about a guy admitted to a mental asylum who claims to be an alien, has no traceable background on earth and can back up his 'alien' story with pertinent *provable* facts about the planet he was born on, which is utterly different from earth in terms of sex, government, work....\n\nIt's incredibly thought provoking covering philosophy, psychiatry, perception of mental illness, what 'civilisation' is - even if you don't like sci-fi, it's soooo worth reading. Love to know if anyone else has read it and if so, what you got out of it."
