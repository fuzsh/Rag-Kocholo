        "text": "Description\n\nReviews\n\nDescription\n\nWhen a man who claims to be from outer space is brought into the Manhattan Institute, the mental ward seems to be just the place for him. However this patient is unlike anyone psychiatrist Dr. Gene Brewer has had under his care before. Calling himself 'prot', he has no traceable background but says that he is an inhabitant of the planet K-PAX, a perfect world without wars, government or religion, and where every being coexists in harmony. Setting a departure date - August 17th at 3.31am - on which he plans to return home on a beam of light, 'prot' keeps us guessing right up until the end.\n\nIS HE REALLY EXTRETERRESTRIAL? OR IS HE JUST ON ANOTHER PLANET? The cult-hit novel K-PAX, now a film from Universal starring Kevin Spacey as prot. 'K-PAX is a gloriously off-beat comedy that reads like a combination of STARMAN, Oliver Sacks and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST' ESQUIRE\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBefore becoming a novelist, Gene Brewer studied DNA replication and cell division at several major research stations. He is the author of ON A BEAM OF LIGHT, K-PAX II and the forthcoming K-PAX III, published in summer 2002, which will complete the K-PAX trilogy. He lives in New York City.\n\nReviews\n\nA man is brought into the mental ward of the Manhattan Institute after claiming to come from outer space.
