Schutzumschlag weisen unter Umständen starke Gebrauchsspuren auf. / Describes a book or dust jacket that has the complete text pages (including those with maps or plates) but may lack endpapers, half-title, etc. (which must be noted). Binding, dust jacket (if any), etc may also be worn.\n\nPaperback. Condition: Used; Very Good. **SHIPPED FROM UK** We believe you will be completely satisfied with our quick and reliable service. All orders are dispatched as swiftly as possible! Buy with confidence! Greener Books.\n\nOctavo softcover (VG): all our specials have minimal description to keep listing them viable. They are at least reading copies, complete and in reasonable condition, but usually secondhand; frequently they are superior examples. Ordering more than one book will reduce your overall postage cost.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Near Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Fine. 1st Edition. This was the first book in what became a K-PAX trilogy, with \"On a Beam of Light\" coming in 2001, and \"K-PAX III: The Worlds of Prot\" in 2002. The story became better known after the 2001 film adaptation with Keven Spacey and Jeff Bridges. (In Dr Gene Brewer's book, the psychiatrist is called Dr Gene Brewer. In the film, the Jeff Bridges character is changed to Dr Mark Powell.) Interesting dust jacket here. It's supposed to be one of those \"magic eye\" stereogram thingys with a hidden 3D image. I can't see it! There is a rubber stamp on the front endpaper, but a near fine copy in a fine dust jacket."
