        "text": "deep story\n\namazing novel, better than the movie, most of the time reading a book before the movie is better, but I will say watching the movie first, did help me with the novel, it made it much easier for me to understand the story and think deeper about it without having to listen again and again, and I found myself more interested trying to find the differences between the novel and movie of which there are many. beautiful story, can't wait for the next one\n\nGood for Multiple Audiences\n\nTake the book whatever way you want, many different audiences should be able to find something they like about this book. You can look at it as the story of a psychotic or as the story of an alien from another world. The author leaves this very much open to interpretation by the reader. The narrator does a good job of sounding very much like the psychologist he is supposed to be.\n\nWe should all visit K-PAX\n\nThis was a wonderful story and brilliantly narrated. I love this story both the book and the film. We can only hope Prot one day returns."
