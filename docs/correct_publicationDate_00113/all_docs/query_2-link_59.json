        "text": "Is there life on other planets? A good question to debate (see some of the answers provided below). Personally, I like to think that a creative God can place life on planets elsewhere in the universe. But who knows? Only God.\n\nI truly enjoy captivating stories of the Science Fiction genre. I grew up reading Tom Swift, Jr. and watching “Star Trek”. Trekkies are always looking for an M-class planet (or what K-PAXIANS’ refer to as a Class BA-5) somewhere. here’s some stuff to consider as we think outside the box. A planet cannot support life unless it is orbiting a bachelor star. Our sun is the only one in the universe that has been observed. The orbit of a bachelor star is unique in that it is not affected by the orbit of other surrounding stars. it’s planets then are never pulled out of orbit either. This scientific fact (that you will not hear from most evolutionist) is absolutely necessary as the first ingredient for life. There are other miracles—like the Earth’s tilt, it’s distance from the sun, it’s speed, etc. that help define our Divine distinctive. The serious thought of life elsewhere has helped to ground me firmly in the Biblical truth of God’s creation. I have witnessed to those that hold other humanistic views. Many have opened their eyes to the truth just by contemplating the logical consideration of a bachelor star.\n\nOur visitor in this story claims to come from K-PAX. His planet has two suns (impossible) and nine purple moons (how interesting). “K-PAX” is the story about this visitor that appears out of nowhere (in a cloud of lint) at Grand Central Station. He unpacks his story at a Manhattan psychiatric hospital. Prot (pronounced Proat, played by Kevin Spacey) finds himself there after giving unusual explanations to one of NY’s Finest (you have to be there). His quietly insistent manner quickly catches the attention of Dr. Mark Powel (Jeff Bridges… this time the shoe is on the other foot as Jeff played an alien in the 1984 movie “Starman”). Writer Charles Leavitt tells a convincing story of a man that can see ultraviolet light and astound astrophysicist with his knowledge. Prot tells about a world without family, marriage, and politically Hilary-Clinton-correct society (AKA “It Takes a Village to Raise a Child”). While Prot reveals his world—Dr. Powell begins to discover his own. His professional world has evolved into brief moments with his own family and a son in college, whom he rarely sees. Dr. Powell faces his own humanity and neglected values. Prot loves his fruit (skin and all). He keeps an unusual journal and looks forward to his trip back home. Bridges does an outstanding job as our guide through this mystery. Our visitor also seems to be a version of Patch Adams and gives helpful advice to many of the other patients. Spacey turns in a plausible performance as someone from another world. I don’t want to be a scene spoiler, so I will stop. To even make comparisons might give too much of the plot away.\n\nThe film is mild for a “PG-13” rating. There is very little profanity and it mostly comes from characters that seem crazy. There is very little sex, but there is a scene that depicts rape in veiled-style flashbacks. These scenes are enough to use caution when considering children under age 13. I would suggest that parents just simply observe the rating. There are places in the film where scripture is read in a respectful manner and Prot tells Dr. Powell that our society should have listened to Jesus Christ (and Buddha).\n\nWith the above reservations, the film is well written and the ending will give you plenty to think about. Is Prot a stranger or just a strange man? I also like the uplifting journey that Dr. Powell leads us on. It is never too early to reach out to your family and give them much needed love and support."
