        "text": "Here's what I've found asked to Roger Ebert on his Movie Answer Man column:\n\nQ. I am obsessing over this new film, ''K-PAX.'' Do you remember the 1986\n\nfilm, ''Man Facing Southeast?'' It was an Argentinean film, but, as I\n\nrecall, based on a short story by Philip K. Dick. Apparently, ''K-PAX'' is\n\nbased on a novel of the early '90s, by Gene Brewer. How can this be? The\n\nstories seem identical.\n\nKaylie Jones, Southampton College, Long Island University\n\nA. I won't see ''K-PAX,'' starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges, until\n\nTuesday. But many similar messages have come to the Answer Man, and Meinert\n\nHansen of Montreal writes, ''The trailer for 'K-PAX' even has scenes\n\nidentical to 'Man Facing Southeast.' ''\n\nThis is from Peter Henne's interview with Iain Softley, the director of\n\n''K-PAX,'' in Film Journal International: ''Told that the basic plot of\n\n'K-PAX' repeats the Argentine film 'Man Facing Southeast,' directed by\n\nEliseo Subiela, and recalls that of Terry Gilliam's 'The Fisher King,'\n\nSoftley isn't fazed. The fact that Bridges plays a man filled with\n\ncompassion for another who is ostensibly, but not certainly, delusional in\n\nboth films makes the resemblance especially strong. 'I don't think there are\n\nenough films like ''The Fisher King,'' Softley counters. 'If it's similar to\n\nthat genre, it's kind of an indication how unique it is. How many cop films,\n\nfor example, are like each other, or gangster films, or romantic comedies?\n\nIt seems to be the same kind of story. I don't think there are enough films\n\nof what could be classed as a modern fable, such as this.' ''\n\n''K-PAX'' is based on a novel by Gene Brewer, published in 1995. Subiela's\n\nscreenplay for ''Man Facing Southwest'' lists no sources, but Eric M. Van of\n\nHarvard notes on the Internet Movie Database that it is ''clearly influenced\n\nby Philip K. Dick's autobiographical last novels VALIS and The\n\nTransmigration of Timothy Archer, and Subiela makes this explicit by naming\n\nthe lead female character 'Beatriz Dick.' ''\n\nOf course Philip K. Dick himself toyed with the theory that we are all\n\nliving in about 40 A.D. and imagining everything else, which was why one of\n\nhis short stories turned out to contain the names of people he met later,\n\nand to be a detailed parallel of the Book of Acts, which he had never read\n\n(this story is told in Richard Linklater's new film ''Waking Life'').\n\n--\n\nSteve Richer\n\nhttp://www3.sympatico.ca/sricher/\n\nClown of presidential scale\n\n\"Baron Wolfgang von Schreck\" <ra...@pipeline.com> wrote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni thought fisher king was a rather weak film,\n\nactually. though i'm not a huge fan of man facing\n\nsoutheast, either, it is a considerably more\n\naccomplished effort than gilliam's flick.\n\nit seems to me that by bringing up FK, the\n\ndirector has essentially redirected the question\n\nand therefore not answered it. sure, thematically\n\nthe two films are similar (a man filled with\n\ncompassion for another who is ostensibly, but not\n\ncertainly, delusional)--but i think fans of MFSE\n\nare not implying a similarity on that level, but\n\non a much more surface level. the imdb gives the\n\ndescription of k-pax as \"Prot is a patient at a\n\nmental hospital who claims to be from a far away\n\nplanet. His psychiatrist tries to help him, only\n\nto begin to doubt his own explanations.\" this,\n\nwith the exception of the character name, is\n\nEXACTLY what man facing southeast is about, if i\n\nremember correctly.\n\nthe two films are not similar on vague level, but\n\non a specific level.\n\n\n\nIn article <9rch1t$6mc$1...@neptunium.btinternet.com>,\n\n\"Aron\" <a.dal...@btinternet.com> wrote:\n\n>\n\n> The story of the madman who might or might not be right goes back to Harvey\n\n> or even more further back.\n\nJust saw K-Pax this afternoon &, derivative or not, enjoyed it a whole\n\nlot. I always like Jeff Bridges when he plays the introspective Everyman\n\nin extraordinary circumstances. Fisher King comes to mind, as does\n\nFearless. His choices of roles are usually pretty solid.\n\nBy the way, can someone gove me a little info about the very first\n\ncouple of minutes of K-Pax? The projection was fucked up at the start of\n\nthe film & I went out to try & find someone who get it fixed, and I\n\nmissed exactly what happens at the start. I came in as kevin Spacey was\n\nbeing bundled into an ambulance -- how, why & where does he get\n\napprehended?\n\nIn article <9rch1t$6mc$1...@neptunium.btinternet.com>\n\n\"Aron\" <a.dal...@btinternet.com> writes:\n\n> > So this begs the question: Is \"K-Pax\" an official remake or simply a\n\n> > rip-off? Anyone got a clue?\n\n> >\n\n> > Just Wondering,\n\n>\n\n> The story of the madman who might or might not be right goes back to Harvey\n\n> or even more further back.\n\nIt's not an official re-make; it's based on a novel (which I haven't\n\nread) that post-dates MFSE.\n\nBut it's much more... um... coincidental, maybe? than just 'a madman\n\nwho might be right.' In both, the 'madman' is convinced he's an alien\n\ncome to earth to help secure earth's salvation, starting with the\n\nmental health worker who's assigned to cure him of his delusion (after\n\nhe allows himself to be incarcerated). Said mental health worker, over\n\nthe course of the story, comes to believe that delusion (sic) more and\n\nmore, and a somewhat less than abiguus ending seems to indicate that he\n\nwas, after all, exactly who he claimed to be.\n\nIt might be worth checking to see if K-Pax's source novel was inspired\n\nby MFSE (I don't kknow if that was an original-for-the-screen or based\n\non a novel, but if the latter, the novel was most likely in Spanish).\n\nOr, it might not be. This is ground that's been covered before; a film\n\ncalled Mr. Frost is virtually exactly the same story, only instead of\n\nthe mental patient being Christ-like, Jeff Goldblum plays a an who\n\nclaims to be none other than Satan himself, with the goal of convincing\n\nhis shrink of that fact.\n\n--\n\nLife Continues, Despite\n\nEvidence to the Contrary\n\nSteven\n\n> By the way, can someone gove me a little info about the very first\n\n> couple of minutes of K-Pax?

Prot \"materializes\" in a shaft\n\nof brilliant sunlight. This is noticed by a panhandler (but nobody else\n\nseems to have seen this).\n\nSuddenly, a woman in the station is assaulted and her luggage is stolen.\n\nShe is knocked to the floor by two assailants who run away into the\n\ncrowd. Prot tries to help the woman to her feet. The police arrive at\n\nthe same time and assume that Prot was the person who attacked the\n\nwoman. The panhandler tries to explain to the police that Prot was\n\nhelping the lady up from the floor.\n\nThe policewoman asks Prot if he is traveling, and he says that he has\n\njust arrived. They ask him where his luggage is, and he says he doesn't\n\nhave any, and that he has no identification, and that he's from the\n\nplanet K-PAX. The policewoman decides that he's mentally ill and radios\n\nfor a car to take him away.\n\nOutside the train station the policewoman who arrested Prot asks the\n\npanhandler (whom she seems to be on a first-name basis with) about Prot,\n\nand again the panhandler tries to convince her that he was trying to\n\nhelp."
