        "text": "A Wrinkle in Time\n\nBy Madeleine L'Engle,\n\nFrom my list on fill your world with wonder and transformation.\n\nBy A. Remlov Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI enjoy thrillers of all kinds. Creating a good thriller for a middle-grade or young-adult audience is challenging and fun. These stories offer opportunities for unexpected situations, making for an action-packed page-turner full of twists and turns. Creating characters that are full of surprises and promise, with obstacles that unleash mayhem–whether in dreams or reality–the task is to create wonder for the reader. There is plenty to amaze and ways to fill a mind with wonder. Plus, every good narrative includes some educational aspects–about extraordinary things–all of which serve to change the lives or expand the horizons of everyone involved. Here are several stories that did that for me.\n\nA.'s book list on fill your world with wonder and transformation\n\nWhy did A. love this book?\n\nI love books that can take me to places I have never been and where good can overcome evil. This story follows several mythical creatures who call upon Meg to face her lack of self-confidence and venture into a quest to save her father (a scientist experimenting with time travel).\n\nThey tell her he is caught in a realm of unbelievable beauty and ambiguity on a distant planet. However, there is a real risk of never returning home, as the evil entities that are holding her father captive also jeopardize the entire universe with the threat of total obliteration.\n\nAnother reason that I liked this book is the invented mythology of several characters and the universe mixed with mathematical theory to weave a story of unconditional love and unwavering courage.\n\nBy Madeleine L'Engle,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n15 authors picked A Wrinkle in Time as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPuffin Classics: the definitive collection of timeless stories, for every child.\n\nWe can't take any credit for our talents. It's how we use them that counts.\n\nWhen Charles and Meg Murry go searching through a 'wrinkle in time' for their lost father, they find themselves on an evil planet where all life is enslaved by a huge pulsating brain known as 'It'.\n\nMeg, Charles and their friend Calvin embark on a cosmic journey helped by the funny and mysterious trio of guardian angels, Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which. Together they must find the weapon that will defeat It.…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Giver\n\nBy Lois Lowry,\n\nFrom my list on fiction books that capture the meaning of simply being human.\n\nBy Jesse Maas Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am passionate about writing books that put good into the world and highlight meaningful and inspiring themes, which, in turn, means I am also passionate about reading books that do the same. I love to write and read books that leave the reader feeling like there is still good in the world, even when it seems to be very dark around us. If people read my books or any on this list, I sincerely hope they feel encouraged and inspired and enjoy them as much as I do.\n\nJesse's book list on fiction books that capture the meaning of simply being human\n\nWhy did Jesse love this book?\n\nWhile I don’t always love mainstream classics, The Giver is a classic for a reason, and, in my opinion, it rightfully deserves its place on the shelf.\n\nI love the emotional draw of this book and the invitation to think deeper about the meaning of life and the burden it can take on us. I love books that challenge us to think about the bigger concepts of life and all they entail: the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nBy Lois Lowry,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n21 authors picked The Giver as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

He was so busy traveling all over the world with his job that our time watching Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock was precious to me. I loved it so much that I built my own Enterprise models and sewed a boxful of tribbles. More importantly, that show led me to reading tons of science fiction - everything from Isaac Asimov to Douglas Adams - and, of course, watching every Star Trek sequel ever made. Live long and prosper.\n\nCat's book list on with aliens that are not science fiction\n\nWhy did Cat love this book?\n\nThis is a big sprawling story. Do you love books like that or hate them? I love them because they feel like giant puzzles: you kind of lose yourself in them and enjoy the constant twists and turns. DeLillo is a postmodern master so you can trust that he has it all under control. In this book, Billy, a teen mathematician prodigy, wins the Nobel Prize in Mathematics and is spirited away to help decipher a mysterious message from aliens. It’s been compared to Alice in Wonderland for its down-the-rabbit-hole and through-the-looking-glass aspects of plot twists and characters. What makes this satire accessible, however, is the comedy. Billy is us, the readers, and he takes us on a philosophical journey while being surrounded by the strangest of characters.\n\nBy Don DeLillo,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Ratner's Star as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen Billy Twillig, a genius adolescent, wins the first Nobel Prize ever to be given in mathematics, he is recruited to live and work in the company of thirty Nobel laureates in obscurity underground. There, away from the rest of the world, this panel of estranged, demented and lovable scientists work together on a secret scientific project: deciphering a mysterious transmission received from outer space, from just near Ratner's Star.\n\nWritten in Don DeLillo's characteristically mesmerizing prose, Ratner's Star is a brilliantly observed, funny and deeply thought-provoking novel which explores the mysterious, mind-blowing, mathematical world of the future.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Sparrow\n\nBy Mary Doria Russell,\n\nFrom my list on strong emotion, excellent plotting, and vivid descriptions that put me securely in time and place.\n\nBy Karen Lynne Klink Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a child sexual abuse survivor who struggled for years with the help of therapy to become the person I am today. My sister, my mother, and I suffered years of emotional abuse by my father. When I was a child, my best friend (who also suffered abuse by her brother) and I made up stories that helped us navigate the situations in our families. I read, hiked, backpacked, and traveled alone for years in order to take risks and develop strength before attempting to write at age sixty-one. I love books that put me solidly in time and place and deeply empathize with characters who struggle and grow to become their genuine selves.\n\nKaren's book list on strong emotion, excellent plotting, and vivid descriptions that put me securely in time and place\n\nWhy did Karen love this book?\n\nI love this book because I became deeply involved with every one of the characters and how they were changed by their interactions with one another and by the results of their first experience with another salient species. The book involves the age-old questions of faith, God, religion, and humanity. Beautiful and haunting.\n\nBy Mary Doria Russell,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n5 authors picked The Sparrow as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'The Sparrow is one of my favourite science fiction novels and it destroyed me in the best way when I read it. It is so beautifully written and the construction of the narrative is masterful.'\n\nEmma Newman, acclaimed author of Planetfall\n\nSet in the 21st century - a number of decades from now - The Sparrow is the story of a charismatic Jesuit priest and talented linguist, Emilio Sandoz, who - in response to a remarkable radio signal from the depths of space - leads a scientific mission to make first contact with an extraterrestrial culture.\n\nIn the true tradition…\n\nPreview\n\nHis to Claim\n\nBy Taylor Vaughn, Eve Vaughn, Theodora Taylor\n\nFrom my list on alien romances featuring heroines of color.\n\nBy Elizabeth Stephens Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a woman of color, impassioned reader, and author to boot, I'm always advocating for inclusion in my romance reads. All of my romances feature a lead or leads of color and I'm particularly drawn to books where I can identify myself in the heroines. I like to provide other readers of color with the same experience through my books, while writing compelling romances that can be enjoyed by anyone. I have published 12 novels, with 4+ coming out in 2022. I've hit the bestseller charts on Amazon in SciFi romances and multicultural romances with every new release. You can expect my Xiveri Mates series in audio, French, and German as early as March 2022.\n\nElizabeth's book list on alien romances featuring heroines of color\n\nWhy did Elizabeth love this book?\n\nHis to Claim pushes the reader through a wide spectrum of emotions. One interesting point is that you see a possessive hero in a romance novel work to embrace emotions. A dark romance novel it features a bride hunt trope that lands our main characters into a variety of cultural understandings which give insights into how we handle our own misunderstandings.\n\nBy Taylor Vaughn, Eve Vaughn, Theodora Taylor\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked His to Claim as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMy alien overlord is huge, all-powerful, and determined to claim me. Every human girl growing up on New Terrhan knows one thing … that she will be taken by one or several Xalthurian males when she turns twenty-one. The Xalthurians are rough, domineering, and huge all over, but this is the deal our leaders struck so that they would provide our human colony with desperately needed supplies. If the baby born from our taking is a girl, we will be allowed to keep it. If the baby is a boy, it will be taken away, never to be seen again.…\n\nPreview\n\nCetaganda\n\nBy Lois McMaster Bujold,\n\nFrom my list on science fiction political intrigue and adventure.\n\nBy Markus McDowell Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have enjoyed science fiction, speculative fiction, and fantasy all my life—especially when the plot includes a ‘David and Goliath’ theme, as these books do. My science teacher introduced me to science fiction in fifth grade, and I have read these genres constantly since then. Not surprisingly, most of my novels and short stories deal with these same themes and genres. They entertain me, they are creative, and they make me think.\n\nMarkus' book list on science fiction political intrigue and adventure\n\nWhy did Markus love this book?\n\nI love science fiction which incorporates skilled protagonists against larger forces—the David/Goliath theme. Part of a space opera series about a political and military family from two different planets, there is political intrigue, battles, and an epic story.\n\nThough technology and space play a role, the character development and portrayal are excellent: complex, realistic, and relatable. The protagonist, Miles, is brilliant but physically flawed. Much of the story is a well-written mystery as Miles, on an ambassadorial visit to a foreign planet, tries to uncover the culprit and purpose of a murder and the politics behind it. At the same time, he must try not to get caught by his hosts or punished by his own government, since he is only there as a representative. Highly recommended!\n\nBy Lois McMaster Bujold,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Cetaganda as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen the Cetagandan empress dies, Miles Vorkosigan and his cousin Ivan are sent to Cetaganda for her funeral as diplomatic representatives of Barrayar.

Miles tries to play detective in a strange, complicated, and deceptively alien culture, while lascivious Ivan manages to get himself involved with several noble females at the same time, a diplomatic no-no of the first order. As the plot thickens, it…\n\nPreview\n\nA Maze of Death\n\nBy Philip K Dick,\n\nWhy did Mike love this book?\n\nThis story imagines a human colony on an alien world that is both terrifying and surreal.\n\nOne by one the colonists meet strange fates or murder each other, until they all wake up to discover the entire sequence of events was a virtual reality—a diversion designed to occupy them while awaiting an unlikely rescue from otherwise certain doom. However, elements from the virtual reality escape into the waking world, leading to salvation for at least one of the voyagers.\n\nThis book will keep you guessing right up to the end, and beyond, making the reader consider what is real, what is religion, and what do we want most out of life.\n\nBy Philip K Dick,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Maze of Death as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom Hugo Award–winning author Philip K.

Deities can be spoken to directly via a series of prayer amplifiers and transmitters, but they may not be happy about it.\n\nAnd the…\n\nPreview\n\nAmmonite\n\nBy Nicola Griffith,\n\nWhy did Tristan love this book?\n\nAmmonite starts in space and lands on an alien world but brings plenty of Earth’s history along with it.

Ammonite’s new world shows us how our world might have looked if different paths were taken.\n\nBy Nicola Griffith,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Ammonite as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWinner of the Lambda and Tiptree Awards • “A knockout . . .

W. Pasulka,\n\nFrom my list on young love confronting cosmic forces like UFOs and life after death.\n\nBy Darren Campo Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love people who are totally lost because they are on the brink of their greatest discovery–their true nature. Even as a little boy I remember seeing that everyone has a purpose in life, but that is hidden to them. I have always felt that every step of the way, life seems to be a little off-track. But through authentic stories, I came to an understanding that right now, everyone is doing great things with their lives, even if they can’t see it.\n\nDarren's book list on young love confronting cosmic forces like UFOs and life after death\n\nWhy did Darren love this book?\n\nThis is the real-life account of a professor who gets caught up in “The Phenomena,” a term used to describe the appearance and interaction with extraterrestrial activity and encounters.\n\nDiana Pasulka is a professor of religious studies who is researching the similarities between encounters with angels and demons, which are very similar in description to encounters with aliens and UFOs. Professor Pasulka is blindfolded and driven by a NASA scientist to a desert in New Mexico, where she is shown a secret “UFO crash site.” She doesn’t believe any of it. She says the ground is covered for miles by deteriorating aluminum cans that the government placed there over fifty years ago to obscure the UFO crash site and hide it. Later, her friend, Dr. Gary Nolan, a Stanford University scientist, verifies the objects from the crash site are not from this “universe.”\n\nI love this book because it is…\n\nBy D. W. Pasulka,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked American Cosmic as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMore than half of American adults and more than seventy-five percent of young Americans believe in intelligent extraterrestrial life. This level of belief rivals that of belief in God. American Cosmic examines the mechanisms at work behind the thriving belief system in extraterrestrial life, a system that is changing and even supplanting traditional religions.\n\nOver the course of a six-year ethnographic study, D.W. Pasulka interviewed successful and influential scientists, professionals, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who believe in extraterrestrial intelligence, thereby disproving the common misconception that only fringe members of society believe in UFOs. She argues that widespread belief in aliens…\n\nPreview"
