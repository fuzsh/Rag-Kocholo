If you would like to submit your own work or nominate someone else’s, please send an email to GenesToGenomes@genetics-gsa.org with “GSA-Art” in the subject line.\n\nI have been in love with DNA for as long as I can remember. I’ve also been in love with sewing for the same “forever”. About 20 years ago it finally dawned on me that I could combine the two and satisfy my artistic side by making art quilts with a scientific content.\n\nThere are quilts for the wall—not for the bed, although I have made those as well. I’ve designed quilts with fanciful images of replicating DNA molecules, gels, chromosomes, pedigrees, tissue sections and yeast cells. There is a limited market for such quilts, so I make them mostly for myself and more recently for students as they graduate from the lab. My two sisters, my mother, aunts and grandmother were/are all quilters. I wonder if there is a gene for that?\n\nWhen I’m not quilting I study DNA replication in yeast. Two years ago, for the FASEB yeast chromosome meeting and the GSA Yeast Genetics Meeting, I made the ultimate art/science fusion by quilting my poster. The GSA needs to start a new poster category award for art posters!"
