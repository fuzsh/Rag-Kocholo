        "text": "While only eight-chapter long as of this review, this story has gone off to an awesome start. From the very get go, it keeps the suspension strong and the situation of the main character interesting and a constant struggle, yet without feeling \"rushed\".\n\nLove the MC character so far, he's likable and has what feels like believable reactions to his situations based on his character forced in a hard position, not a pushover and yet not a \"nothing-can-affect-me-I'm-a-morally-devoid-badass\".\n\nThere is a bit much melancholy at times, and a lot of recollections of past events, and some thoughts that feel a bit repetitive. But so far it feels they have served a good purpose.\n\nHonestly, my biggest criticism so far is this:\n\nThe GameLit part revealed in chapter six, it just doesn't feel necessary. I was actually extremely happy with it just being a \"strait-forward\" low-dark-fantasy tale until then that reminded me abit of Connan the Barbarian, with no \"numbers\", \"skills\" or \"levels\" to justify things or his abilities.\n\nIt's fine in some stories that build around the concept, but I always feel it can often remove a lot of the tension and/or creates artificial tension as the story progresses, when it just isn't necessary.\n\nFor example if the character has a high level, all of a sudden \"normal\" peoplecan no longer touch him/her, or when he/she meets a big high level monster/character, there is just no way to \"win\" without \"cheating\" (based on the system used, obviously). I think the text itself should explain that, not two stacks of numbers.\n\nHonestly, the numbers can still be there in the background, I just don't see the reason to show them to the reader, at least not in this story where the GameLit elements (so far) do not feel like a central point to the narrative.\n\nWith that said, I still look forward to whatever direction this story takes, as its nothing that will prevent me from continue reading it.\n\nGreat work, and keep it going!\n\nI just need to say how much that I am loving this story.\n\nThe leveling is unique, and a little creepy, but that fits with the more survival horror style of the story. The monsters are legit monsters, not magical animals with a magic core, but horrors with creepy gems, it's somehow similar enough to other stories to be easily understood, but still totally the author's own thing at the same time.\n\nHis powers are awesome, I like the crafting/Brewing parts of the story, but I love even more that it's so useful.\n\nThe story uses many of the Tropes of iseki/reincarnation stories, but most importantly to me, each is used in a fairly unique way.\n\nAll of the different, awesome elements of the story came together in this chapter: Action, Drama, unknowable horror, Brewing alcohol, guns, reaction shots to MC greatness, and more. So I felt compelled to write a review.\n\nhmm, tecnically i wanted to check it out for the litrpg part, but like the tags says it's reeallllyyyyy a game \"lit\", so i was kinda of dissapointed , there are no characters attributes, niether levelling skills, only gaining levels, through killing and maybe gaining new abilities , which considering what his class, it's not really exciting...\n\ni mean he is f.cking brewer. this is a case where difference doesn't necessarily mean better, usually you never see such classes, and maybe you'd think it 'd be cool, but it's actually not.\n\nbonus :\n\ndark and gritty: i like this\n\nmc is not a pus.sy\n\naction, blood.\n\nif you want a cool isekai in a dark gritty world. i suggest it.\n\nif you are in this only for the gamelit tag, then it's not suggested.\n\nA story about a brewer. The world built is realistic and has real high stakes. Be warned though story isn't about just brewery. There is a lot of fighting, surviving and brewing.\n\nThere are dangerous monsters and leveling isn't easy. There is a brewery as the name suggests though after chapter 15. Obviously he has to survive and know his surrounding before starting brewing.\n\nMC is a strong point of this story. He is not good at everything, stupid or super smart but an average person. He is empathetic but still practical. Side characters are wellwritten too. MC has survived till now because of his knowledge and supplies from Earth. He didn't get everything from luck and also lost many opportunities because of being alone and in dangerous world where people will take your supplies to survive.\n\nTill now, MC has explored not much but the small area he has is how a world full of monsters should feel.\n\nThough you have to ignore a little detail that MC had more supplies than normal at start. He is luck that way you can say. But it doesn't stick out too much because of the way the personality of MC is written.\n\nIt isn't explain yet how he gets transported to another world nor it will be I think. But that isn't the focus of story anyway. Maybe there will be an explanation in future.\n\nIf you are looking for something to read, try it. You will definitely enjoy it.\n\nThere have been many stories written about warriors, fighters of unmatched prowess to defeat their enemies. Even more stories have been written about magicians; exploratory essays on novel magic systems wrapped up in an easy to read story format. If stories are written about professions and the people who pursue them they are most likely talking about a blacksmith, a strong individual capable of forging unique armor and weapons to transform themselves into the heroic warrior when needed. Stories about other professions are rather rare, even with a certain inkeeper showing what a good writer can manage.\n\nThe Brewer King is one of those rare exceptions a story whose purported purpose is to portray the adventures of Sanjay King. A brewer from Seattle who finds himself in a new world after the loss of his family with his main advantage the ability to brew drinks and imbue them with magic.\n\nThe setting does a good job of establishing itself quickly and providing a realistic world for the main character to explore. Challenges appear around every corner, not just monsters to be overcome, but social, political and personal problems that force Sanjay to use every aspect of his abilities and help to flesh him out as a three dimensional character.\n\nSanjay is not the onlycharacter that is brought to life, and as the story progresses a caste of interesting presonalities is introduced. Some of the supporting personalities feel a little two dimensional in their characteristics, but it is only noticeable in comparison with the main characters.\n\nThe writing is practiced and flows smoothly. There are a few small grammatical errors and misspelled words, but the text as a whole is readable and clear. I perosnally would prefer if the word 'said' was used less often, but that is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.\n\nLets get down to brass tacks:\n\nThere is nothing that breaks my consentration or immerson, no grammer or spelling flaws that have me re-read the same sentance twice, and no scenarios, dialoge or characters that make me cringe.\n\nIt's worth the read just for that.\n\nThe monsters are wayyy more interesting than normal, the lore has me intregued and the way the main character levels up or begomes physically better is much grittier than arbitrary 'exp' gain for slaying a monster.\n\nThat makes the read much more enjoyable than a whole lot on this website\n\nI have completely succombed to this novel.\n\nThe MC is isekaied after in a fantasy world.\n\nFirst the world. This a dark one with monster war and horror at any corner. Peaple are cruel and easily put there greed before the life of others. Even dark to the extreme this is not a caricature. Everything seems realist and logical. In this hard world peaple are hard. Also impressive in only 12 chapters we learn and experience different cultures, philosophy and part of the World. Impressive world building.\n\nNow the characters. They are extremely well made. They have there goal, there cultures, there friends and habits. The MC is just a passager in there lives. Loves it.\n\nThe MC is a wise men, ready to die and do the right thing. Without spoiler I can only say so. His personality is well crafted from the start and has he slowly understand the world he finds his place. He is strong put as much as any adventurer.\n\nGrammar and style is top tier. You are kidnapped by his word, and soon you could not stop yourself.\n\nThe only reason this story is not on top 20 of RR is it's lack of chapter. But with time it will arrive there.\n\nThank you Psycho for this wonderful novel.\n\nSo, let's start off with what this isn't. This isn't about a story about a MC who goes around, killing monsters, gaining experience, and gets excited when his mana missle spell does 2 points more damage.\n\nThis is a story about a seriously depressed man, whose wife and kids died about 6 months prior to the beginning. He gets portaled into a rather dark world, with a civil war in a far off kingdom leading to lawlessness in outlying areas. Humans are often jerks, but not always.\n\nGrammar isn't bad, but there are some weird errors, more like autocorrect fails than anything else. No big deal.\n\nThe author writes like he knows what he's talking about regarding brewing and distilling, although there's a heck of a lot of things that go into opening your own brewery/distillery besides just making the product. It would make more sense, maybe, if he was a home brewer and distiller as a hobby, and it might provide a character hook since home distilling is illegal anywhere in the US.\n\nTo sum up: characters that seem human, and that I care enough about to wonder who is going to die. Decent writing, with only a few mistakes. Interesting worldbuilding. Unique monsters. Things might be darker than some people would want, but otherwise check it out."
