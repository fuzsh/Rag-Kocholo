        "text": "NBC’s Crunch Time has found its cast.\n\nCraig Ferguson has been tapped to star in the game show/comedy hybrid pilot, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Also cast in the pilot are My Boys alums Kyle Howard and Kellee Stewart, who will reunite with series creator Betsy Thomas on the project.\n\nDescribed as a hybrid game show/comedy, Crunch Time intercuts between a real game show and the scripted workplace that centers on an up-and-coming producer trying to wrangle the volatile host.\n\nFerguson will take on the role of Toby, the host of the game show within the show, and a successful stand-up comedian. His career as an actor stalled and he’s turning to the game show to take his career to the next level. A nice guy on-camera, he struggles off-camera with feeling too good for his job and not good enough at it.\n\nHoward will take on the role of Jake, the game show’s head writer who’s also a hipster playwright who does the gig for the money and his friendship with Emily (the uncast showrunner of “Crunch Time”). However, he can’t stand Toby.\n\nStewart is set as Marcelle, Emily’s best friend and confidant who is head of the game show contestants and always discovering the next great contestant.\n\nThis marks the second year in a row that Ferguson, former host of The Late Late Show, has booked a broadcast pilot. Last season, he starred in ABC comedy King of 7B, which did not move forward. Ferguson, who has had a voice role in the How to Train Your Dragon feature film franchise, is currently hosting History’s Join or Die With Craig Ferguson and syndicated Celebrity Name Game. He is repped by WME and Gang Tyre.\n\nHoward, who starred on TBS comedy My Boys as Bobby Newman, also starred on TBS comedy Your Family or Mine. His credits include Royal Pains and features Made for Each Other and Orange County. He is with UTA.\n\nStewart portrayed Stephanie on My Boys and counts TV Land’s The Soul Man among her credits. She is with Domain Talent.\n\nMy Boys creator Thomas will pen the script and executive produce the Universal Television comedy alongside Phil Gurin and David Janollari. Gurin created the concept for the game show/multicamera entry."
