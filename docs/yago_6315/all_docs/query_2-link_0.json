        "text": "Scottish and American television host, comedian, author, and actor\n\nFor the hockey player, see Craig Ferguson (ice hockey).\n\nCraig Ferguson (born 17 May 1962) is a Scottish and American comedian, actor, writer, and television host. He is best known for hosting the CBS late-night talk show The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (2005–2014), for which he won a Peabody Award for his interview with South African archbishop Desmond Tutu in 2009.\n\nAfter leaving The Late Late Show in December 2014, he hosted the syndicated game show Celebrity Name Game (2014–2017), for which he won two Daytime Emmy Awards, and Join or Die with Craig Ferguson (2016) on History.[2] In 2017, he released a six-episode web show with his wife, Megan Wallace Cunningham, titled Couple Thinkers.[3][4] In 2021, he hosted The Hustler, television game show that aired on ABC from 4 January to 23 September 2021.\n\nAfter starting his career in the UK with music, comedy, and theatre, Ferguson moved to the US, where he appeared in the role of Nigel Wick on the ABC sitcom The Drew Carey Show (1996–2004). Ferguson has written three books: Between the Bridge and the River, a novel; American on Purpose (2009), a memoir; and Riding the Elephant: A Memoir of Altercations, Humiliations, Hallucinations & Observations (2019). He holds both British and American citizenship.\n\nHe has written and starred in three films, directing one of them, and has appeared in several others. In animated film, he had provided the voices of Gobber in the How to Train Your Dragon film series (2010–2019), Owl in Winnie the Pooh (2011), and Lord Macintosh in Brave (2012).\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nFerguson was born on 17 May 1962 in Stobhill Hospital in the Springburn community district of Glasgow, to Robert (1930 – 2006),[5] a post office worker and Scottish Nationalist[6] and Janet Ferguson (1933 – 2008),[7] a primary school teacher[8][9][10] When he was 6 months old, he and his family moved from their Springburn flat to a Development Corporation house in the nearby New Town of Cumbernauld, where he grew up \"chubby and bullied\".[11] They lived there as Cumbernauld was rehousing many Glaswegians away from the poor housing conditions and damage to the city from World War II. Ferguson attended Muirfield Primary School[13] and Cumbernauld High School. At age 16, Ferguson left high school and began an apprenticeship to be an electronics technician at a local factory of American company Burroughs Corporation. Ferguson has two sisters (one older and one younger) and one older brother.[16] His younger sister, Lynn Ferguson Tweddle, is also a comedian, presenter and actress, who voiced Mac in the 2000 stop-motion animation film Chicken Run. She was a writer on The Late Late Show until July 2011.[17]\n\nHis first visit to the United States was in 1975, when he was 13, to visit an uncle who lived on Long Island, near New York City.[18] When he moved to New York City in 1983, he worked in construction in Harlem.[19] He was later a bouncer at the nightclub Save the Robots before returning to the United Kingdom.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nUK career\n\n[edit]\n\nFerguson's entertainment career began as a teenager, drumming for Glasgow punk bands such as the Night Creatures and Exposure. He then had a brief stint as a drummer for the post-punk band Ana Hausen, which released a single for Human Records in 1981.[22] Following that, he joined punk band The Bastards from Hell, later renamed the Dreamboys, and fronted by vocalist and future actor Peter Capaldi. They performed regularly in Glasgow from 1980 to 1982.[23] Ferguson credits Capaldi for inspiring him to try comedy.[11] When Ferguson was 18, he worked as a session musician and performed as a drummer for Nico during a few gigs when she toured Scotland.[22]\n\nAfter a nerve-wracking first comedy appearance, he decided to create a character he described as a \"parody of all the über-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland,\"[11] using the name \"Bing Hitler\" borrowed from Peter Capaldi.[23] Ferguson first performed as the character in Glasgow, and was subsequently a hit at the 1986 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. However, by the end of the year, Ferguson was already discussing his intention to retire Bing. At the press launch for an alternative pantomime of Sleeping Beauty (which he co-wrote with Capaldi),[24] he said, \"You can't write for just one character forever.\"[25] A recording of his act as Bing Hitler was made at Glasgow's Tron Theatre and released in the 1980s;[26] a Bing Hitler monologue (\"A Lecture for Burns Night\") appears on the compilation cassette Honey at the Core.[27]\n\nAfter enjoying success at the Edinburgh Festival,[28] Ferguson appeared on television as 'Confidence' in Red Dwarf, on STV's Hogmanay Shows,[29] and on the 1993 One Foot in the Grave Christmas special One Foot in the Algarve. In 1990, a pilot of The Craig Ferguson Show, a one-off comedy pilot for Granada Television, was broadcast, co-starring Paul Whitehouse and Helen Atkinson-Wood.[30] In 1991, Channel 4 asked him to host Friday at the Dome, a 75-minute live music show.[31] In 1992, he was given his own BBC Scotland show, 2000 Not Out.[32] In 1993, he presented a six-part archaeology TV series, The Dirt Detective, for STV,[33][34] and was given a six-part TV series on BBC One, The Ferguson Theory, a mix of stand-up and sketches recorded the day before transmission.[35][36]\n\nFerguson also found success in musical theatre. Beginning in 1991, he appeared on stage as Brad Majors in the London production of The Rocky Horror Show.[37] In 1994, he played Father MacLean in production of Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom at the Union Chapel in London. That year he appeared again at the Edinburgh Fringe, as Oscar Madison in The Odd Couple.[38]\n\nAfter living and working in the US for many years, in 2017, it was announced that he would return to UK television for the first time in 25 years[39] in a guest role in BBC Scotland's comedy Still Game, to be shown in 2018.[40]\n\nIn 2022, an adaptation of Ferguson's film Saving Grace (2000) was announced as a stage musical aimed for a 2023 run in West End, in which Ferguson will portray a \"villainous banker\". It was adapted by April De Angelis from Ferguson's and Mark Crowdy's screenplay, with music by KT Tunstall.[41]\n\nUS career\n\n[edit]\n\nFerguson moved to Los Angeles in November 1994, after his soon-to-be agent Rick Siegel had seen Ferguson during the Edinburgh Festival and suggested that he come to America. His first US role was as baker Logan McDonough on the short-lived 1995 ABC comedy Maybe This Time, which starred Betty White and Marie Osmond.\n\nHis breakthrough in the US came when he was cast on The Drew Carey Show as the title character's boss, Mr. Wick, a role he played from 1996 to 2003. He played the role with an over-the-top posh English accent, explaining it was \"to make up for generations of English actors doing crap Scottish accents.\"[43] In his comedy special \"A Wee Bit o' Revolution\", he specifically identified James Doohan's portrayal of Montgomery Scott on Star Trek as the foundation of his \"revenge\". (At the end of one episode, though, Ferguson broke the fourth wall and began talking to the audience at home in his regular Scottish accent.) His character was memorable for his unique methods of laying employees off, almost always \"firing Johnson\", the most common last name of the to-be-fired workers.[43] Even after leaving the show in 2003, he remained a recurring character on the series for the last two seasons, and was part of the two-part series finale in 2004.\n\nDuring the production of The Drew Carey Show, Ferguson devoted his off-time as a cast member to writing, working in his trailer on set in between shooting his scenes. He wrote and starred in three films: The Big Tease, Saving Grace, and I'll Be There; he also directed the latter, for which he won the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas, and Valencia film festivals. He was named Best New Director at the Napa Valley Film Festival. These were among other scripts that, \"in the great tradition of the movie business, about half a dozen that I got paid a fortune for but never got made.\"[44]\n\nHis other acting credits in films include Niagara Motel, Lenny the Wonder Dog, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, Chain of Fools, Born Romantic, The Ugly Truth, Kick-Ass, and, as a voice-over actor, How to Train Your Dragon, How to Train Your Dragon 2, Brave, and Winnie the Pooh.[45]\n\nFerguson has been touring the United States and Canada with a comedy show since the late 2000s, including a performance at Carnegie Hall on 23 October 2010 and a performance at Radio City Music Hall on 6 October 2012. He has performed two stand-up television specials on Comedy Central, both released on DVD: A Wee Bit o' Revolution in 2009 and Does This Need to Be Said? in 2011. His third comedy special, I'm Here to Help, was released on Netflix in 2013, garnering positive reviews of 4 out of 5 stars on Netflix and peaking at number 6 on Billboard top comedy albums.[46][47] It also received a 2014 Grammy Award nomination for Best Comedy Album.[48]\n\nFerguson was awarded the Peter Ustinov Comedy Award by the Banff World Media Festival on 11 June 2013.[49]\n\nThe Late Late Show\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2004, it was announced that Ferguson would succeed Craig Kilborn on CBS's The Late Late Show. His first show as the regular host aired on 3 January 2005. The show was unique in that it had no \"human\" sidekicks such as Ed McMahon on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson or Conan O'Brien's Andy Richter. He had a remotely operated robot skeleton named Geoff Peterson and two silent performers in a pantomime horse costume that were added in 2010. His monologues were conducted within a few feet of the camera versus the long distance Johnny Carson kept from the camera and audience.[50]\n\nThe Late Late Show averaged 2.0 million viewers in its 2007 season, compared with 2.5 million for Late Night with Conan O'Brien.[51] In April 2008, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson beat Late Night with Conan O'Brien for weekly ratings (1.88 million to 1.77 million) for the first time since the two shows went head-to-head with their respective hosts.[52]\n\nIn March 2009, Craig Ferguson topped Jimmy Fallon in the ratings with Ferguson getting a 1.8 rating and Fallon receiving a 1.6 rating.[53] By 2014, Ferguson's ratings had faltered, trailing those of Late Night with Seth Meyers with an average of 1.35 million viewers versus 2.02 million.[54]\n\nOn 28 April 2014, Ferguson announced he would leave The Late Late Show at the end of 2014,[55] with the final episode airing on 19 December.[56] His contract was set to expire in June 2014, but a six-month extension was agreed on to provide a more graceful exit and give CBS more time to find a replacement host.[57][58] He reportedly received US$5 million as part of his contract because he was not selected as the replacement for David Letterman's Late Show.[59] Ferguson made the decision prior to Letterman's announcement but agreed to delay making his own decision public until the reaction to Letterman's decision (announced 3 April) had died down.[58] CBS Entertainment Chair Nina Tassler said, following the announcement, that in his decade as host Ferguson had \"infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television.\"[60] CBS continued the franchise with James Corden as the new host.[61]\n\nPost–Late Late Show\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that Ferguson would host the syndicated game show Celebrity Name Game, produced by Coquette Productions, beginning in late 2014.[62] Ferguson's involvement in the project dates back to 2011, when it was originally pitched and piloted as a CBS primetime series.[63][64] As of April 2014 , the series had an initial order of 180 episodes.[59] The syndicated series began airing on 22 September 2014. Ferguson won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game Show Host for Celebrity Name Game in 2015[65] and 2016.[66] On 2 December 2016, it was announced that the series would end after three seasons.[67]\n\nFerguson signed in 2015 to play Prentiss Porter in The King of 7B, a comedy pilot for ABC.[68] The show was not picked up.[69]\n\nOn 18 February 2016, Ferguson began to host a historical talk show on History titled Join or Die with Craig Ferguson. The title is a reference to a Benjamin Franklin political cartoon published in the Pennsylvania Gazette on 9 May 1754, which Ferguson had tattooed on his forearm after becoming an American citizen.[70] Ferguson and a three-guest panel of comedians and historians conduct a humorous discussion of a different topic on each episode, such as the most doomed presidential campaign, greatest Founding Father and greatest invention, with viewers invited to share their opinions via Twitter.[69]\n\nBetween January 2021 and April 2022, Ferguson hosted the American game show The Hustler, which aired on ABC. The show followed five contestants who collaborate to build up a cash prize by answering a series of trivia questions presented by Ferguson, while one of the contestants is secretly designated as the Hustler beforehand and given the answers to all the questions. By the end of the game, two of the honest contestants have been eliminated; the other two must correctly choose the Hustler in order to stop the Hustler from winning the entire prize. The series premiered on 4 January 2021, before moving to its regular timeslot on 7 January 2021, airing on Thursdays at 10 p.m. In April 2022, it was reported that the series was cancelled, having aired 19 episodes across two seasons.[72]\n\nOther television work\n\n[edit]\n\nCraig Ferguson has made guest appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Rachael Ray, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, The Howard Stern Show, The Daily Show, The View, Loveline, Real Time with Bill Maher, The Soup, The Talk, The Price Is Right, Kevin Pollak's Chat Show, The Dennis Miller Show and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Ferguson hosted the 32nd annual People's Choice Awards on 10 January 2006.[73] TV Guide magazine printed a \"Cheers\" (Cheers and Jeers section) for appearing on his own show that same evening.[citation needed] From 2007 to 2010, Ferguson hosted the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on 4 July, broadcast nationally by CBS. Ferguson was the featured entertainer at 26 April 2008 White House Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington, DC.[74]\n\nFerguson co-presented the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama with Brooke Shields in 2008.

The show reunited him with former co-star and frequent Late Late Show guest Betty White. Ferguson reprised the role for several episodes when the show returned in March 2014.\n\nIn January 2023, Sony Pictures Television (SPT) announced a new, half-hour syndicated late night talk show with Craig Ferguson as host. Channel Surf with Craig Ferguson will be produced by Whisper North and will be distributed by SPT. A pilot for Channel Surf with Craig Ferguson was shot in the UK this month at Dock10 studios, and SPT will take the show out to potential buyers in Los Angeles.\n\nRadio\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 27 February 2017, Ferguson launched The Craig Ferguson Show, a two-hour talk radio show on the Comedy Greats channel and Faction Talk on SiriusXM Satellite Radio.[77][78] His last new show aired 11 May 2018.\n\nLiterature\n\n[edit]\n\nFerguson's novel Between the Bridge and the River was published on 10 April 2006. He appeared at the Los Angeles Festival of Books, as well as other author literary events. \"This book could scare them[who?]\", he said. \"The sex, the violence, the dream sequences and the iconoclasm. I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with that. I understand that. It was very uncomfortable to write some of it.\"[79] The novel is dedicated to his elder son, Milo, and to his grandfather, Adam. He revealed in an interview that he is writing a sequel to the book, to be titled The Sphynx of the Mississippi.[80] He also stated in a 2006 interview with David Letterman that he intends the book to be the first in a trilogy.[81] As of February 2019, Ferguson has produced no further novels, although he has published non-fiction.\n\nFerguson signed a deal with HarperCollins to publish his memoirs.[82] The book, entitled American on Purpose: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot, focuses on \"how and why [he] became an American\" and covers his years as a punk rocker, dancer, bouncer and construction worker as well as the rise of his career in Hollywood as an actor and comic.
