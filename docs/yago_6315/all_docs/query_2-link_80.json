        "text": "The first few times you get an email from a publicist, it’s very affirming! It makes you feel like less of an imposter. “These people who are paid to promote their products think that I am worthy of promoting their products!” It’s not long, however, before 95 percent of your emails come from publicists and you spend 15 percent of your day clicking “delete, delete, delete.”\n\nEveryone in this racket gets an enormous number of trailer announcements, and if you are a site that really only posts trailers and the occasional review (ahem, First Showing), I suppose it makes your job easier. For me, it’s mostly a fun reminder that a lot of actors are still in the game. For instance, I love to see that Craig Ferguson is still acting, although I’m not as keen to find out that it’s in a movie with Kathie Lee Gifford, who is also still acting. Here’s the trailer for Then Came You.\n\nMeanwhile, I actually liked this trailer for Dating Amber, about two gay teenagers acting as each other’s beard. Sharon Horgan is in it, which was enough to entice me into at least watching the trailer.\n\nThe subject line for a movie called Henchmen was intriguing because of all the talent involved: Thomas Middleditch, James Marsden, Rosario Dawson, Alfred Molina, Will Sasso, Nathan Fillion, Rob Riggle, Jane Krakowski, Craig Robinson. And then, we open it up only to see that it’s an animated film, and not a very good looking one, at that. The entertainment threshold for kids is very low, but I don’t think that this would meet it.\n\nThe trailer for The Devil Has a Name looks OK, and it has a strong cast — David Strathairn, Kate Bosworth, Edward James Olmos, Katie Aselton, Haley Joel Osment with Alfred Molina and Martin Sheen — but I’m not entirely sure why the publicist wanted us to know that Hispanic heritage month is from September 15 - October 15. Also, they left Pablo Schreiber out of the cast list. If there is an opportunity to mention Pablo Schreiber, you mention Pablo Schreiber!\n\nJimmy O. Yang, Cedric The Entertainer, Alex Moffat, and Neal Brennan star in The Opening Act, which comes from Vince Vaugh and his best friend, Peter Billinsgley (Ralphie from Christmas Story). You know what? I’ll actually watch this one. Thanks, Publicist!\n\nThe subject in this email was “Official New Trailer! DO NOT REPLY” and my first thought was, “Why in God’s name would I reply to this?” Turns out, “Do Not Reply is the name of the movie. It’s a horror film. It does not look particularly good.\n\nI like Mark Webber, who wrote, directed, and starred in The Place of No Words, which also stars his wife, Teresa Palmer. Webber was pretty crusty about losing his role to Jake Johnson in the Stumptown recasting last year. Pretty weird trailer: Looks like Where the Wild Things Are crossed with The Vikings.\n\nHere’s the trailer for Woody Allen’s next films starring Timothée Chalamet, Elle Fanning, Selena Gomez, Jude Law, Diego Luna and Liev Schreiber … actually, you know what? Nevermind. Why does legit talent continue to take roles in Woody Allen films?\n\nHere is the trailer for The Wolf of Snow Hall, which features the late Academy Award-nominee Robert Forster (Breaking Bad), in his final feature role. RIP, Mr. Forster."
