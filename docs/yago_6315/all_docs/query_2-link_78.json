        "text": "Well Ferguson is a very Protestant name, so I would guess towards Rangers.\n\nI don't know why people feel they can't wear their colours with pride, so to say. Any football fan worth his season ticket can tell who someone supports if they're given enough time, especially when it comes to big rivalries like the Old Firm. I mean Rangers and Celtic fans can work out friend from foe incredibly quickly, maybe its some deep rooted caveman instinct?\n\nWelshCelt, you have to understand that in the US, we perceive hooliganism differently than you do. And since they'd just been talking about the sectarian aspect of the rivalry, it was probably best for Ferguson to duck out of the conversation rather than explain that, for example, HE supported Rangers, but didn't like the chants recounting 300 year old battles, etc. That wouldn't do the sport or Ferguson any favors.\n\nYou and I understand that it's a minority everywhere, ranging from small to miniscule. But US audiences don't get that.\n\nAh, fair point. So your average US viewer has heard of the Old Firm then? Thats nice to know.\n\nAnd as for the Old Firm, I wouldn't call it a minority. The hatred is very real and very present. In varying degree's almost all Celtic or Rangers fans genuine venom for the other, and it often hits fever pitch. I certainly hate Rangers and their fans collectively (although usually not individually), and I love it.\n\nI doubt it. IIRC, Drew was talking about how passionate fans are about the sport around the world, how much he digs that, and briefly explained the Celtic-Rangers rivalry. And since Craig is Scottish....\n\nAs for it being a majority...it's one thing for the majority of fans to well and truly hate each other. The Duke-UNC rivalry, and many other college rivalries, approach that. But is there regular violence?\n\nFor a couple of years, ANY fight ANYwhere in the world, even a 2nd division Croatian league match, would make my local paper as the one little soccer story in the daily roundup of minor sports coverage. There's a significant number of people who are ignorant or assholes or both who try really hard to spread the notion that going to a soccer match is slightly less dangerous than wearing red in Crip territory. Ferguson was probably somewhat aware of that and just wanted to get out of the discussion."
