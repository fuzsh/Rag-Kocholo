        "text": "This week, America said goodbye to a groundbreaking late-night talk show host. His brand of comedy was unique, and he used the enormous creative freedom bestowed upon him to push the envelope night after night. No matter how long he had been at the job, he brought an inexhaustible energy every time he appeared on camera, masterfully using comedy to tackle the darkest of subjects. He is one of the truest patriots to ever pledge allegiance to the United States of America.\n\nI am talking, of course, about Craig Ferguson.\n\nOther late-night hosts are funny. They are charming. They can often be “eccentric”. If they are lucky, their comedy is labeled “edgy”. Each and every night, Ferguson achieved levels of transcendent batshittery that left the rest in the dust.\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Scotsman swooped into America’s homes from his 12.35am perch on CBS’ The Late Late Show and proceeded to bombard them with 40-plus minutes of often unscripted insanity. On Friday night, he signed off for the last time, before James Corden takes over in 2015.\n\nThe whole gang was there to say goodbye, including his “horse”, Secretariat, and Geoff, the pervy robot who served as his announcer/foil/partner in crime. An appreciation video featured too many celebrities to count. “Bill Cosby” phoned in as part of a very line-walking bit. Oh, and Jay Leno, who knows a thing or two about goodbyes, was there as well.\n\nThough The Late Late Show was notorious for being all over the place, Ferguson’s shows followed a rough formula. Episodes often opened with the camera filming a barren set. You could hear the audience giggling nervously. If you were really lucky, a small, fluffy stuffed animal would appear innocently at the bottom of the screen. And before you could ask yourself “What the —?” it would start lip-syncing Britney Spears’ Oops I Did It Again alongside a crocodile, a horse and a bespectacled guy in S&M gear.\n\nWhen the show came back from commercial, Ferguson would lunge into the shot, slap the camera like it was his old pal, like you at home watching on TV were his best mate, declare “It’s a great day for America everybody!” – to him, it was always a great day for America, even when that day had been genuinely shit – and then begin to rattle off whatever was on his mind.\n\nThere would be sketches with godawful production values, madcap interviews with whatever celebrity, segments with Ferguson reading viewers’ letters and tweets before dismissively hurling them from his desk.\n\nBut despite the silliness, Ferguson was capable of enormous empathy. When other late-night hosts elbowed each other out of the way in the race to make the harshest jokes about Britney Spears’ 2007 meltdown, he devoted his opening monologue to a sobering lesson on addiction and offered his support to the troubled singer. It was a rare moment of humility and self-awareness in a profession in which ego and entitlement run amok.\n\nHe used other monologues to eulogize his parents; the show won a 2009 Peabody Award for his interview with Desmond Tutu. Ferguson spoke frankly about his struggles with alcohol and his ruined marriages. An unabashed lover of America, when he finally became a US citizen, he took a camera crew along and documented the process – and made us all fall in love with our country again.\n\nHe allowed himself to be genuine human in front of us. For decades, millions of Americans have been inviting these men in suits into their homes late at night. But Ferguson is the one who truly felt like a friend.\n\n“The people that made this show … came to a show that was, let’s be honest, a bit of a fixer-upper, and it kind of stayed that way,” Ferguson told viewers at the top of his final show.\n\n“But what I hope we’ve done is … maybe ‘art’ is a very grand word, but what I was trying to do here, and what I think that we’ve managed to do here, was make something here that wasn’t here before.”\n\nFerguson certainly accomplished that. What he forgot to say – or was too self-deprecating to say – is that he managed to make something the likes of which will never be seen again."
