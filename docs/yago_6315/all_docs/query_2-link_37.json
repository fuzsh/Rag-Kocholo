I have to say, this seemed like a strange request, since I live on the opposite side of the country from the guy, and it's not like we hang out together or anything. But, maybe this wasn't such a crazy request, because I did give him a copy tonight, when he was signing books after the book reading. \n\t\n\t<b>Me</b>: I wanted to give you this DVD. My friend wrote and directed this movie.\n\t<b>Craig</b>: Is it a zombie movie?\n\t<b>Me</b>: It is.\n\t<b>Craig</b>: I love zombie movies!\n\t<b>Me</b>: I know! And apparently you had someone on the show and you were talking about zombie poop...\n\t<b>Craig</b>: About whether zombies poop?\n\t<b>Me</b>: Yes! And this movie has zombie poop in it!\n\t<b>Craig</b>: Well thank you for that. And thank you for culturally elevating the evening.\n\t\n\tThen he smiled like he was kind of teasing me, but he also seemed sincerely pleased about it. I don't even remember what I said next. I hope I said &quot;I hope you enjoy it&quot; or &quot;You're welcome&quot; but I probably said something kind of nonsensical like &quot;thank you.&quot; I was so nervous I forgot to tell him I think he's hilarious!",
