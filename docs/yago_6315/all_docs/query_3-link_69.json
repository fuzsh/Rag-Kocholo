        "text": "Tickets are now on sale to see Craig Ferguson at 8 p.m. Aug. 29 at the Rialto Square Theatre in Joliet.\n\nFerguson is a Peabody and Emmy Award-winning actor, writer, producer, director and comedian who has had a diverse career that encompasses film, TV and stage. He is a New York Times bestselling author and has recorded numerous standup specials for Netflix, Epix, Comedy Central and Amazon.\n\n“The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson” ran on CBS for 10 years and remains a cult favorite on YouTube, racking up millions of views every year on fan-posted bootleg clips.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Scotland, Ferguson got his start in the entertainment industry as a drummer for some of the worst punk bands in the United Kingdom. After his musical stint, he began bartending in a local pub in Glasgow, where he was introduced to Sir Michael Boyd, the artistic director of The Tron Theatre in Glasgow, who persuaded Ferguson to try acting.\n\nAfter several low-paying acting gigs, Ferguson discovered he had a knack for comedy and was soon the star of his own BBC TV show, “The Ferguson Theory.”\n\nAfter several stints in the U.K. comedy circuit, Ferguson brought his act to America in 1995 to star with Betty White and Marie Osmond in the short-lived ABC comedy “Maybe This Time.” After the show ended, ABC decided to add the talented Scotsman to “The Drew Carey Show,” playing Drew Carey’s boss, Nigel Wick, from 1996 to 2003.\n\nIn 2016, Ferguson debuted his original History Channel show, “Join or Die,” which featured him and his celebrity friends debating provocative topics with history experts. He also hosted “Celebrity Name Game” in syndication, winning the Emmy for best host two years in a row, and “The Hustler” for ABC/Disney.\n\nFerguson has written the feature films “The Big Tease” and “Saving Grace.” In 2003, he made his directorial debut with “I’ll Be There,” which he also wrote and starred in. “I’ll Be There” went on to receive the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas and Valencia film festivals.\n\nFerguson also was named Best New Director at the Napa Valley Film Festival. Ferguson’s other film credits include “Niagra Motel,” “Lenny the Wonder Dog,” “Prendimi l’anima,” “Life Without Dick,” “Chain of Fools” and “Born Romantic.”\n\nIn 2011, Ferguson portrayed “Owl” in the Disney classic “Winnie the Pooh,” and in 2012, he portrayed “Lord Macintosh” in Disney’s Oscar-winning animated feature “Brave.” He also voices Gobber in the hugely successful “How To Train Your Dragon” movies."
