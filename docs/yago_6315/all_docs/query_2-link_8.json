Ferguson was raised Scottish Presbyterian When he was six months old, he and his family moved from their Springburg apartment to a council house in Cumberland. They lived there as Glasgow was re-housing many people following damage to the city from World War II. Ferguson attended Murifeld Primary School and Cumberland High School.

Ferguson credits Capaldi for inspiring him to do comedy.\n\nAfter a nerve-wracking first appearance, Ferguson decided to create a character that was a \"parody of all the uber-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland\" the character \"Bing Hitler\" (actually coined by Capaldi as Ferguson started under the name \"Nico Fulton\" but admittedly later stole the name for his \"own nefarious ends\") premiered in Glasgow and subsequently became a hit at the 1986 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

His first U.S. role was as baker Long McDonough on the short-lived 1995-96 ABC sitcom Maybe This Time which stared Betty White and Marie Osmond.\n\nHis breakthrough in the U.S. came when he was cast on The Drew Carey Show as the title character's boss Mr. Wick, a role that he played from 1996 until 2003. Ferguson played the role of an over-the-top posh English accent \"to make up for generations of English actors doing crap Scottish accents\" in his comedy special \"A Wee Bit O' Revolution\", he specifically identified James Doohan's portrayal of Montgomery Scott from Star Trek as the foundation of his \"revenge\". (At the end of one episode, though, Ferguson broke the fourth wall and began talking to the audience at home in his regular Scottish accent) His character was memorable for his unique methods of laying employees off, almost always \"firing Johnson\", the most common last name of the to-be-fired workers.

His first show as the regular show aired on 3 January 2005. By May 2008, Ben Alba, an American television historian and an authority on U.S. talk shows said Ferguson \"has already made his mark, taking the TV monologue to new levels with an underlying story. But he is just only starting... He is making up his own rules; it's the immigrant experience.\"\n\nThe show is unique in that it has no \"human\" sidekicks such as Ed McMahon on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson or Conan O'Brien's Andy Richter. Ferguson has a remotely operated skeleton named Geoff Peterson and two silent performers in a horse costume. Ferguson's monologues are conducted within a few feet of the camera versus the long distance that Johnny Carson kept from the camera and audience.

Ferguson's contract was set to expire in June 2014, but a six-month extension was agreed in order to provide a more graceful exit and give CBS more time to find a replacement host. He will reportedly receive US$5 million as part of his contract because he was not selected as the replacement for Letterman's Late Show. Ferguson made the decision prior to Letterman's announcement but agreed to delay making his own decision public until the reaction to Letterman's decision has died down. CBS Entertainment Chair Nina Tassler said following the announcement, that in his decade as host Ferguson had \"infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television\", CBS intends to continue the franchise with James Corden as the new host.\n\nTelevision and appearances[]\n\nFerguson has made guest appearances on: The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Rachael Ray, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, The Howard Stern Show, The Daily Show, The View, Loveline, Real Time with Bill Maher, The Soup, The Talk, The Price is Right, Kevin Pollak's Chat Show and The Dennis Miller Show.
