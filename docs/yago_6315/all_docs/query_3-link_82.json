        "text": "Craig Ferguson is damned funny.\n\nAnd it’s not just his Scottish burr (although that helps). He’s simply got one of those endlessly inventive minds, and he’s powered by a chipper energy.\n\nHe might be best-known for hosting “The Late, Late Show” from 2005 to 2014, but his career is wide-ranging. He has done everything from pen three books to voice characters in movies ranging from “How to Train Your Dragon” to “Brave.”\n\nHere’s one thing that surprised me about Ferguson’s career trajectory when it happened in 2020: he co-starred in a romantic comedy with Kathie Lee Gifford, who also wrote the movie, titled “Then Came You.”\n\nWhen promoting that film, he said on the Today show: \"We are great friends ... we kind of have nothing in common except that we adore each other and we're friends.”\n\nFerguson is out on his Fancy Rascal Tour (he is even comically adept at devising tour titles), and he’s coming to Foxwoods on Friday."
