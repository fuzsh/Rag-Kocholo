        "text": "Ferguson stated, \"CBS and I are not getting divorced, we are ‘consciously uncoupling,’ but we will still spend holidays together and share custody of the fake horse and robot skeleton, both of whom we love very much.\"\n\n“During his 10 years as host, Craig has elevated CBS to new creative and competitive heights at 12:30,” said Nina Tassler, chairman, CBS Entertainment, in a statement. “He infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television.”\n\nAdded Tassler, “Craig’s versatile talents as a writer, producer, actor and comedian speak to his great days ahead. While we’ll miss Craig and can't thank him enough for his contributions to both the show and the Network, we respect his decision to move on, and we look forward to celebrating his final broadcasts during the next eight months.”\n\nFerguson has several projects in the works, including hosting “Celebrity Name Game,” a syndicated game show beginning fall 2014, as well as developing television projects via his Green Mountain West production company.\n\n\"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" debuted on CBS in 2005."
