        "text": "Emmy winners Kathie Lee Gifford and Craig Ferguson will team up for the upcoming feature film Love Me to Death. Shooting begins in Scotland on June 4, with acclaimed novelist Adriana Trigiani serving as director and Reynoldo Villalobos serving as director of photography.\n\nGifford, who penned the screenplay, will star as Annabelle, a lonely widow who plans a trip around the world, with her husband's ashes in tow, to visit the places they loved in the movies. When she arrives at the Inn in Loch Lomond, run by a curmudgeonly Scotsman (Ferguson), the first stop on the journey changes her life forever. The film is produced by Matthew T. Weiner and executive-produced by George Shinn for Whiskey and Wine Ltd.\n\nFerguson served as the host of CBS's The Late Late Show for a decade, and received two Daytime Emmys for hosting the game show Celebrity Name Game. Gifford is the Emmy-winning cohost of the fourth hour of NBC's Today, as well as the coauthor of the musicals Scandalous and Under the Bridge."
