        "text": "Host Craig Ferguson delves into various topics ranging from financial planning with Facet Wealth to avocados and Netflix. Ferguson is joined by Josh Robert Thompson and Joseph Bolter, his former colleagues from The Late Late Show, as they share memories of their time on the show and discuss their current endeavors. They also touch upon Tom Selleck's reverse mortgage commercial and a potential new podcast titled \"Man, Robot, Horse,\" which would feature the hosts without guests.\n\nBobcat Goldthwait, who once directed Jimmy Kimmel's show and now resides in the woods with cats, is mentioned alongside discussions about past Super Bowl experiences and sports preferences. Ferguson, who previously hosted a late-night show, expresses that he does not miss it and has gained a different perspective on the experience.\n\nThe conversation shifts to behind-the-scenes stories from The Late Late Show, including producer Peter LaSalle and his animated show \"Johnny Carton.\" The challenges of dealing with social media and tabloid websites are discussed, as well as the idea of reviving a character named Jeff through advanced technology. The speakers reminisce about stand-up comedy experiences and touring with comedian Ferguson, where incorporating jokes about him led to success on stage.\n\nThey recall having their own plane and a little person dressed as a leprechaun performing before shows. The discussion extends to other characters from the show, such as Fiona the Scottish stalker, and how the show transitioned away from sketches and remote segments due to the effort required. The current podcast, Man Robot Horse, aims to include more spontaneous moments, and the speakers reflect on missing Larry King and a time when celebrities voiced Jeff's character while one of them was filming insurance commercials in South Africa.\n\nJosh Robert Thompson and Joseph Bolter reminisce about working on a show called \"Disaster,\" which initially went unnoticed by executives but later gained popularity for its use of bad magicians and cheap props. They discuss the changes that came with moving to a bigger studio, including a stable for a puppet horse named Secretariat, and remember colleagues like producer Michael Madis and puppeteers Matt Coogler and Ryan McGowan.\n\nThe history of The Late Late Show is explored, noting that Alex Burnett was one of the original hosts before Ferguson took over. The speakers also share anecdotes from their time on SiriusXM's \"Trucker Radio\" and their attempts to secure sponsorship from Gant clothing company. Kato Kaelin, who once lived in Ferguson's garden shed, is now hosting a podcast.\n\nNicole's family joins the conversation, discussing Mark McGrath's appearance and considering a German accent for their show. They reflect on trips to Scotland and Paris, acknowledging that they may not have fully appreciated those moments at the time. Ferguson, Thompson, and Bolter talk about the challenges of filming in different locations and the importance of a strong team, noting that the best moments often occurred off-script. They express frustration with the current state of TV and social media, where outrage seems to be valued over genuine content.\n\nThe changing landscape of comedy and entertainment is addressed, particularly the impact of social media and online content. The speakers reminisce about the pre-viral video era and the difficulties of pitching ideas in Hollywood. They end with a discussion on censorship and how comedians like George Carlin and Richard Pryor faced backlash for pushing boundaries.\n\nCensorship and outrage culture in comedy are further examined, with instances of offended audiences trying to stop comedians from performing certain jokes. The decline of late-night television viewership is contrasted with the higher ratings their show used to enjoy, and the success of Taylor Tomlinson's new panel show on CBS is acknowledged.\n\nThe pressures of being in the public eye are discussed, with the hosts finding solace in each other as coworkers. They recount receiving odd gifts from their boss, including a pastrami sandwich and $10,000 in used bills. Other lighthearted topics include using a shoebox instead of an ATM, the origin of the name \"Janik\" for one speaker's son, and a humorous encounter with Paul McCartney at the Grammys.\n\nNegative reviews from the New York Post and the LA Times are mentioned, along with the refusal to say certain jokes and learning from performance mistakes. The podcast concludes with plans for a future podcast focused on historical empires, produced by Thomas Zacopala, whose name interestingly means \"undertaker\" in Czech. This ties back to an episode featuring an actual undertaker as a guest."
