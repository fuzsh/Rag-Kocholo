Craig Ferguson

Craig Ferguson is an Emmy Award-winning actor, writer and comedian with a diverse career that encompasses film, television and the stage. On February 21 st , Ferguson returns to the big screen as his reprised character ‘Gobber’ in the highly anticipated third installment in the animated feature “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.” Ferguson will be releasing his third book, Riding the Elephant: A Memoir of Altercations, Humiliations, Hallucinations, and Observations, on May 7th, 2019 with Blue Rider Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House. This past summer, Ferguson completed filming the feature film “Love Me to Death” in his native Scotland alongside Kathie Lee Gifford, who wrote the film.

Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Ferguson got his start in the entertainment industry as a drummer for some of the worst punk bands in the U.K. Following his musical stint, he began bartending in a local pub in Glasgow where he was introduced to Michael Boyd, the artistic director of The Tron Theatre in Glasgow, who persuaded Ferguson to try acting. After several low paying acting gigs, Ferguson discovered he had a knack for comedy and was soon the star of his own BBC television show, “The Ferguson Theory.” After several stints on the English comedy circuit, Ferguson brought his act to America in 1995 to star with Betty White and Marie Osmond in the short-lived ABC comedy, “Maybe This Time.” After the show ended, ABC decided to add the talented Scotsman to “The Drew Carey Show,” playing Drew Carey's boss, ‘Nigel Wick,’ from 1996-2003. In 2016, Ferguson debuted his original History Channel show, “Join or Die,” which featured him and his celebrity friends debating provocative topics with history experts.
