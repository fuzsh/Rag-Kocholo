        "text": "The Index of Economic Freedom focuses on four key aspects of the economic and entrepreneurial environment:\n\nRule of law,\n\nGovernment size,\n\nRegulatory efficiency, and\n\nMarket openness.\n\nIn assessing conditions in these four categories, the Index measures 12 specific components of economic freedom, each of which is graded on a scale from 0 to 100. Scores on these 12 components of economic freedom are calculated from a number of sub-variables and then equally weighted and averaged to produce an overall economic freedom score for each economy.\n\nThe following sections explain the formulas and methodology used to compute the scores for each of the 12 components of economic freedom.\n\nRule of Law\n\nProperty Rights\n\nThe property rights component assesses the extent to which a country’s legal framework allows individuals to acquire, hold, and utilize private property and the extent to which these rights are secured by applicable laws that the government enforces effectively. Relying on a mix of survey data and independent assessments, it provides a quantifiable measure of the degree to which a country’s laws protect private property rights and the extent to which those laws are respected. It also assesses the level of state expropriation of private property. The more effective the legal protection of property is, the higher a country’s score will be, and the greater the chances of government expropriation of property are, the lower a country’s score will be.\n\nThe score for this component is derived by averaging scores for three equally weighted sub-factors:\n\nRisk of expropriation,\n\nRespect for intellectual property rights, and\n\nQuality of contract enforcement, property rights, and law enforcement.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent available versions of the following sources in assessing property rights: Credendo, Country Risk and Insights; U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Global Innovation Policy Center, International IP Index; and World Bank, Worldwide Governance Indicators.\n\nJudicial Effectiveness\n\nProperly functioning legal frameworks are essential for protecting the rights of all citizens against unlawful acts by others, including governments and powerful private parties. Judicial effectiveness requires efficient and fair judicial systems to ensure that laws are fully respected and appropriate legal actions are taken against violations.\n\nThe score for the judicial effectiveness component is derived by averaging scores for three equally weighted sub-factors:\n\nJudicial independence,\n\nQuality of the judicial process, and\n\nPerceptions of the quality of public services and the independence of the civil service.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent available versions of the following sources in assessing judicial effectiveness: Freedom House, Freedom in the World, and World Bank, Worldwide Governance Indicators.\n\nGovernment Integrity\n\nCorruption erodes economic freedom by introducing insecurity and coercion into economic relations. Of greatest concern is the systemic corruption of government institutions and decision-making by such practices as bribery, extortion, nepotism, cronyism, patronage, embezzlement, and graft. The lack of government integrity that such practices cause reduces public trust and economic vitality by increasing the costs of economic activity.\n\nThe score for this component is derived by averaging scores for three equally weighted sub-factors:\n\nPerceptions of corruption,\n\nBribery risk, and\n\nControl of corruption including “capture” of the state by elites and private interests.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent versions of the following sources in assessing government integrity: Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index; TRACE International, Trace Bribery Risk Matrix®; and World Bank, Worldwide Governance Indicators.\n\nGovernment Size\n\nTax Burden\n\nTax burden is a composite measure that reflects marginal tax rates on both personal and corporate income and the overall level of taxation (including direct and indirect taxes imposed by all levels of government) as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe component score is derived from three equally weighted quantitative sub-factors:\n\nThe top marginal tax rate on individual income,\n\nThe top marginal tax rate on corporate income, and\n\nThe total tax burden as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe equal weighting of these numerical variables allows a country to achieve a score as high as 67 based on two of the sub-factors even if it receives a score of zero on the third.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent available data from the following sources for information on tax rates, in order of priority: KPMG International; Deloitte, Tax Guides and Highlights; International Monetary Fund, Staff Country Report, “Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix,” and Staff Country Report, “Article IV Consultation”; PricewaterhouseCoopers, Worldwide Tax Summaries; countries’ investment agencies; and other government authorities (embassy confirmations and/or the country’s treasury or tax authority).\n\nFor information on the tax burden as a percentage of GDP, the primary sources are World Bank, World Development Indicators; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data; Eurostat, Government Finance Statistics; African Development Bank Group, African Economic Outlook; International Monetary Fund, Government Finance Statistics (GFS) database, Staff Country Report, “Selected Issues,” and Staff Country Report, “Article IV Consultation”; Asian Development Bank, Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific; and United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nGovernment Spending\n\nThe government spending component captures the burden imposed by government expenditures, which includes consumption by the state and all transfer payments related to various entitlement programs.\n\nThe Index does not identify an optimal level of government spending. The ideal level will vary from country to country, depending on factors that range from culture to geography to level of economic development. At some point, however, government spending becomes an unavoidable burden as growth in the public sector’s size and scope leads inevitably to misallocation of resources and loss of economic efficiency. As volumes of research have shown, excessive government spending that causes chronic budget deficits and the accumulation of public debt is one of the most serious drags on economic dynamism.\n\nThe Index methodology treats zero government spending as the benchmark. As a result, underdeveloped countries—especially those with little government capacity—may receive artificially high scores. However, such governments can provide few if any public goods and will probably receive low scores on some of the other components of economic freedom (such as property rights, financial freedom, and investment freedom) that measure aspects of government effectiveness.\n\nGovernment spending has a major impact on economic freedom, but it is just one of many important components. The scale for scoring government spending is nonlinear, which means that spending that is close to zero is lightly penalized and spending that exceeds 30 percent of GDP leads to much worse scores in a quadratic fashion (for example, twice as much spending yields four times less freedom). Only extraordinarily high levels of government spending (for example, more than 58 percent of GDP) receive a score of zero.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent versions of the following sources for information on government intervention in the economy, in order of priority: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data; Eurostat data; African Development Bank Group, African Economic Outlook; International Monetary Fund, Staff Country Report, “Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix,” Staff Country Report, “Article IV Consultation,” and World Economic Outlook database; Asian Development Bank, Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific; African Development Bank, AfDB Statistics Pocketbook; official government publications of each country; and United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nFiscal Health\n\nWidening deficits and a growing debt burden, both of which are caused by poor government budget management, lead to the erosion of a country’s overall fiscal health, and deteriorating fiscal health is associated with macroeconomic instability and economic uncertainty.\n\nDebt is an accumulation of budget deficits over time. In theory, debt financing of public spending could contribute to productive investment and ultimately to economic growth. However, mounting public debt driven by persistent budget deficits—and especially by spending that merely boosts government consumption or transfer payments—often undermines overall productivity growth and leads ultimately to economic stagnation rather than growth.\n\nThe score for the fiscal health component is based on two sub-factors, which are weighted as follows in calculating the overall component score:\n\nAverage deficits as a percentage of GDP for the most recent three years (80 percent of score)3 and\n\nDebt as a percentage of GDP (20 percent of score).\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent available versions of the following sources for information on government intervention in the economy, in order of priority: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook database, Staff Country Report, “Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix,” and Staff Country Report, “Article IV Consultation”; Asian Development Bank, Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific; African Development Bank, AfDB Statistics Pocketbook; and official government publications of each country.\n\nRegulatory Efficiency\n\nBusiness Freedom\n\nThe business freedom component measures the extent to which a country’s regulatory and infrastructure environments constrain the efficient operation of businesses. The quantitative score is derived from an array of factors that affect the ease of starting, operating, and closing a business.\n\nThe business freedom score for each country is a number between 0 and 100, with 100 indicating the freest business environment, and is based on four equally weighted sub-factors:\n\nAccess to electricity,\n\nBusiness environment risk,\n\nRegulatory quality, and\n\nWomen’s economic inclusion.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent available versions of the following sources in determining business freedom scores: World Bank, Worldwide Governance Indicators; World Bank, World Development Indicators; Credendo, Country Risk and Insights; and World Bank, Women, Business and the Law.\n\nLabor Freedom\n\nThe labor freedom component is a quantitative measure that considers various aspects of the legal and regulatory framework of a country’s labor market, including regulations concerning minimum wages, associational rights, laws inhibiting layoffs, severance requirements, and measurable regulatory restraints on hiring and hours worked, in addition to the labor force participation rate and labor productivity as an indicative measure of employment opportunities in the labor market.\n\nThe score for the labor freedom component is based on nine equally weighted sub-factors:\n\nMinimum wage,\n\nAssociational right,\n\nPaid annual leave,\n\nNotice period for redundancy dismissal,\n\nSeverance pay for redundancy dismissal,\n\nLabor productivity,\n\nLabor force participation rate,\n\nRestrictions on overtime work, and\n\nRedundancy dismissal permitted by law.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent data available from the following sources for data on labor freedom: World Bank, Worldwide Governance Indicators; World Bank, World Development Indicators; Freedom House, Freedom in the World; International Labour Organization, statistics and databases; and World Bank, Employing Workers project.\n\nMonetary Freedom\n\nMonetary freedom combines a measure of inflation with an assessment of various government activities that distort prices. Price stability without microeconomic intervention is the ideal state for the free market.\n\nThe score for the monetary freedom component is based on two sub-factors:\n\nThe weighted average rate of inflation for the most recent three years and\n\nA qualitative judgement about the extent of government manipulation of prices through direct controls or subsidies.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent versions of the following sources for data on monetary policy, in order of priority: International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics Online; International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook database and Staff Country Report, “Article IV Consultation”; various World Bank country reports; various news and magazine articles; and official government publications of each country.\n\nOpen Markets\n\nTrade Freedom\n\nTrade freedom is a composite measure of the extent of tariff and nontariff barriers that affect imports and exports of goods and services. The trade freedom score is based on two inputs:\n\nThe trade-weighted average tariff rate and\n\nA qualitative evaluation of nontariff barriers (NTBs).\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent versions of the following sources in determining scores for trade policy, in order of priority: World Trade Organization, World Tariff Profiles; World Bank, World Development Indicators; World Trade Organization, Trade Policy Review; Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers; U.S. Department of Commerce, Country Commercial Guide; and official government publications of each country.\n\nInvestment Freedom\n\nIn an economically free country, there would be no constraints on the flow of investment capital. Individuals and firms would be able to move their resources into and out of specific activities, both internally and across the country’s borders, without restriction. Such an ideal country would receive a score of 100 on the Index’s investment freedom component.\n\nIn practice, however, most countries impose a variety of restrictions on investment. Some have different rules for foreign and domestic investment. Some restrict access to foreign exchange. Some impose restrictions on payments, transfers, and capital transactions. In some, certain industries are closed to foreign investment.\n\nThe Index evaluates a variety of regulatory restrictions that typically are imposed on investment. Points, as indicated below, are deducted from the ideal score of 100 for each of the restrictions in a country’s investment regime. It is not necessary for a government to impose all of the listed restrictions at the maximum level to eliminate investment freedom. The scores for the few governments that impose so many restrictions that they total more than 100 points in deductions are set at zero.\n\nInvestment Restrictions\n\nNational treatment of foreign investment\n\nNo national treatment; investment prescreened 25 points deducted\n\nSome national treatment and some prescreening 15 points deducted\n\nSome national treatment or prescreening 5 points deducted\n\nForeign investment code\n\nBurdensome bureaucracy and no transparency 20 points deducted\n\nInefficient policy implementation and bureaucracy 10 points deducted\n\nSome investment laws and practices nontransparent or inefficiently implemented 5 points deducted\n\nRestrictions on land ownership\n\nAll real estate purchases restricted 15 points deducted\n\nNo foreign purchases of real estate 10 points deducted\n\nSome restrictions on purchases of real estate 5 points deducted\n\nSectoral investment restrictions\n\nMultiple sectors restricted 20 points deducted\n\nFew sectors restricted 10 points deducted\n\nOne or two sectors restricted 5 points deducted\n\nExpropriation of investments without fair compensation\n\nCommon with no legal recourse 25 points deducted\n\nCommon with some legal recourse 15 points deducted\n\nUncommon but does occur 5 points deducted\n\nForeign exchange controls\n\nNo access by foreigners or residents 25 points deducted\n\nAccess available but heavily restricted 15 points deducted\n\nAccess available with few restrictions 5 points deducted\n\nCapital controls\n\nNo repatriation of profits; all transactions require government approval 25 points deducted\n\nInward and outward capital movements require approval and are subject to some restrictions 15 points deducted\n\nMost transfers approved with some restrictions 5 points deducted\n\nAs many as 20 additional points may be deducted for security problems, a lack of basic investment infrastructure, or other government policies that inject a considerable degree of uncertainty and indirectly burden the investment process and limit investment freedom.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent versions of the following sources for data on capital flows and foreign investment, in order of priority: official government publications of each country; U.S. Department of State, Investment Climate Statements; Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers; World Bank, Investing Across Borders; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Services Trade Restrictiveness Index; and U.S. Department of Commerce, Country Commercial Guide.\n\nFinancial Freedom\n\nFinancial freedom is both an indicator of banking efficiency and a measure of independence from government control and interference in the financial sector. State ownership of banks and other financial institutions such as insurers and capital markets reduces competition and generally lowers the level of access to credit.\n\nIn an ideal banking and financing environment characterized by a minimum level of government interference, independent central bank supervision and regulation of financial institutions are limited to enforcing contractual obligations and preventing fraud; credit is allocated on market terms; the government does not own financial institutions; financial institutions provide various types of financial services to individuals and companies; banks are free to extend credit, accept deposits, and conduct operations in foreign currencies; and foreign financial institutions operate freely and are treated the same as domestic institutions.\n\nTo assess the overall level of financial freedom that ensures easy and effective access to financing opportunities for people and businesses in a country’s economy, the Index takes account of five broad areas:\n\nThe extent of government regulation of financial services,\n\nThe degree of state intervention in banks and other financial firms through direct and indirect ownership,\n\nGovernment influence on the allocation of credit,\n\nThe extent of financial and capital market development, and\n\nOpenness to foreign competition.\n\nBased on this assessment, an economy receives an overall financial freedom score on a scale of 0 to 100 according to the following criteria:\n\n100—No government interference. Government oversight is limited solely to the enforcement of contractual obligations and prevention of fraud.\n\n90—Minimal government interference. Regulation of financial institutions is minimal but may extend beyond the enforcement of contractual obligations and prevention of fraud to capitalization or reserve requirements.\n\n80—Nominal government interference. Government ownership of financial institutions represents a small share of overall sector assets. Financial institutions face almost no restrictions on their ability to offer financial services.\n\n70—Limited government interference. The government influences the allocation of credit, but private allocation of credit is subject to almost no restrictions. Government ownership of financial institutions is sizeable. Foreign financial institutions are subject to few restrictions.\n\n60—Moderate government interference. Banking and financial regulations are somewhat burdensome. The government exercises ownership and control of financial institutions with a significant share of overall sector assets. The ability of financial institutions to offer financial services is subject to some restrictions.\n\n50—Considerable government interference. The government significantly influences the allocation of credit, and private allocation of credit faces significant barriers. The ability of financial institutions to offer financial services is subject to significant restrictions. Foreign financial institutions are subject to some restrictions.\n\n40—Strong government interference. The central bank is subject to government influence, its supervision of financial institutions is heavy-handed, and its ability to enforce contracts and prevent fraud is weak. The government exercises active ownership and control of financial institutions with a large minority share of overall sector assets.\n\n30—Extensive government interference. The government influences the allocation of credit extensively. The government owns or controls a majority of financial institutions or is in a dominant position. Financial institutions are heavily restricted, and bank formation faces significant barriers. Foreign financial institutions are subject to significant restrictions.\n\n20—Heavy government interference. The central bank is not independent, and its supervision of financial institutions is repressive. Foreign financial institutions are discouraged or highly constrained.\n\n10—Near-repressive. The government controls the allocation of credit. Bank formation is restricted. Foreign financial institutions are prohibited.\n\n0—Repressive. Supervision and regulation are designed to prevent private financial institutions from functioning. Private financial institutions are nonexistent.\n\nSources: The Index relies on the most recent versions of the following sources for data on banking and finance, in order of priority: International Monetary Fund, Staff Country Report, “Selected Issues,” and Staff Country Report, “Article IV Consultation”; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Economic Surveys; official government publications of each country; U.S. Department of Commerce, Country Commercial Guide; Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers; U.S. Department of State, Investment Climate Statements; World Bank, World Development Indicators; and various news and magazine articles on banking and finance.\n\nGeneral Methodological Parameters\n\nPeriod of Study. Scores for the 2024 Index of Economic Freedom are generally based on data for the period covering the second half of 2022 through the first half of 2023. To the extent possible, the information considered for each variable was current as of June 30, 2023. It should be noted, however, that some component scores are based on historical information. For example, the monetary freedom component uses a three-year weighted average rate of inflation from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2022.\n\nEqual Weight. In the Index of Economic Freedom, the 12 components of economic freedom are weighted equally so that the overall score will not be biased in favor of any one component or policy direction. The 12 economic freedoms obviously interact, but the exact mechanisms of this interaction are not clearly definable: Is a minimum threshold for each one essential? Is it possible for one to maximize if others are minimized? Are they dependent or exclusive, complementary or supplementary?\n\nThese questions, while valid, are beyond the scope of our fundamental mission. The Index of Economic Freedom is designed to reflect the economic and entrepreneurial environment in every country studied in as balanced a way as possible, not specifically to explain economic growth or any other dependent variable; that is ably done by researchers elsewhere. The raw data for each component are provided so that others can study, weight, and integrate as they see fit.\n\nMost Recent Available Information. By analyzing economic freedom annually, the Index can include the most recent information as it becomes available country by country. Using a data cutoff date ensures that all countries are treated fairly. As described above, each year’s Index considers all information as of the last day of June of the previous year (in this case, June 30, 2023). Any new legislative changes or policy actions that take effect after that date have no positive or negative impact on scores or rankings.6\n\nDefining the Country Pages “Quick Facts”\n\nThe “Quick Facts” section of each country page is a statistical profile that includes the country’s principal economic and demographic indicators. To facilitate comparisons among countries, the GDP and GDP per capita figures in the “Quick Facts” section are adjusted to reflect purchasing power parity (PPP). Caution should be used in interpreting changes in these figures over time because PPP conversion rates are subject to regular revision by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. To provide accurate estimates of annual and five-year GDP growth rates, these figures have been calculated using constant U.S. dollars for the most recent available years.\n\nExact definitions and sources for each category of data reported are as follows:\n\nPopulation: 2022 data from World Bank, World Development Indicators database midyear estimates, which count all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship. In some cases, other sources include the country’s statistical agency and/or central bank.\n\nGDP: Gross domestic product (total production of goods and services) adjusted to reflect PPP. The primary source is International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook database, October 2023. Other sources include a country’s statistical agency and/or central bank.\n\nGDP growth rate: Annual percentage growth rate of real GDP derived from constant currency units. Annual percentage changes are year over year. The primary source is International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook database, October 2023. Secondary sources include U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, The World Factbook 2022, and a country’s statistical agency and/or central bank.\n\nGDP five-year average annual growth: Average growth rate measured over a specified period of time. The five-year annual growth rate is measured using data from 2018 through 2022 based on real GDP growth rates. The primary source is International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook database, October 2023. Secondary sources are U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, The World Factbook 2022, and a country’s statistical agency and/or central bank.\n\nGDP per capita: Gross domestic product (adjusted for PPP) divided by total population. The sources for these data are International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook database, October 2023; U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, The World Factbook 2023; and a country’s statistical agency and/or central bank.\n\nUnemployment rate: A measure of the portion of the workforce that is not employed but is actively seeking work. Data are from International Labour Organization, World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2023.\n\nInflation: Annual percentage change in consumer prices as measured for 2022 (or the most recent available year). The primary source for 2022 data is International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook database, October 2023. The secondary source is a country’s statistical agency and/or central bank.\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) inward flow: Total annual inward flow of FDI in current 2020 U.S. dollars, reported in millions. FDI flows are defined as investments that acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in a local enterprise by an investor operating in another country. Such investment is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments and both short-term and long-term international loans. Data are from United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, World Investment Report 2023: International Tax Reforms and Sustainable Investment.\n\nPublic debt: Gross government debt as a percentage of GDP, which indicates the cumulative total of all government borrowings less repayments that are denominated in a country’s currency. Public debt is different from external debt, which reflects the foreign currency liabilities of both the private and public sectors and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings. The primary sources for 2022 data are the International Monetary Fund and the IMF DataMapper.\n\nCommonly Used Abbreviations"
