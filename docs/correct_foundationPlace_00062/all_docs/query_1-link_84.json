        "text": "Did You Know...\n\nBefore They Were Justices â€” Ensign John Paul Stevens\n\nA native of Chicago, John Paul Stevens graduated from the University of Chicago in 1941. The Phi Beta Kappa scholar then took a correspondence course in cryptography and joined the U.S. Navy. Stevens spent the majority of his service in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where he worked as a watch officer analyzing intercepted Japanese communications, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star. Thirty years after the end of World War II, Stevens joined the Court, serving 35 years before retiring in 2010. Justice Stevens died on July 16, 2019, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
