We were never a publicly traded company which I personally liked because there was no fear of a hostile takeover by the likes of Oracle or IBM.\n\nThank you for using Focal Point!\n\nChuck Wolff - Focal Point Moderator\n\nWebFOCUS 7x and 8x, Windows, Linux All output Formats\n\nVirtuoso\n\nHide Post\n\nI'll agree with the privately-owned observation. I started with a privately-owned company (IBI) in 1998 and have been with several ever since, and I don't miss my prior publicly-owned companies one bit. A much steadier hand on the wheel in private companies.\n\nBeing purchased by TIBCO actually means being purchased by Vista Equity Partners, an \"American investement firm\" that invests in software companies. Here's hoping they have an interest in keeping WebFOCUS' installed base up and running in the future.\n\nVirtuoso\n\nHide Post\n\nThis was just posted on myibi by Rob Fosnaugh the Sr. Manager Enterprise Information from Brotherhood Mutual Insurance.\n\nWe utilize Scribe to get data out of Microsoft Dynamics. Scribesoft was recently acquired by TIBCO and it was a very seamless process to the point that Scribe is a better platform, the price remained the same, we have more functionality, training, and tools, and most importantly the employees of the company are even happier with their jobs and future. If I didn’t see the TIBCO logo alongside the Scribe log and the excitement of the employees I wouldn’t have known anything changed. From my standpoint if any company were to acquire ibi that TIBCO is one of the best fits. They appear to find standout companies and allow them to do what they do best and at the same time integrate from the TIBCO stack to bring efficiencies and synergies. Others may have differing opinions and it may play out differently over time, but this has been the direction ibi has been heading for the past 5 or so years and I see this as a positive move compared to other options.\n\nThank you for using Focal Point!\n\nChuck Wolff - Focal Point Moderator\n\nWebFOCUS 7x and 8x, Windows, Linux All output Formats\n\nPlatinum Member\n\nHide Post\n\nSeems like I'm in the minority, but I don't mind at all if they do away with the FOCUS language. Its so problematic. Yes we've spent years learning and acquiring skills for it, but does anyone think this is a GOOD programming language? Like, I've learned to use it and I've had success with it, but I'll take Tableau or Cognos (haven't tried Spotfire, but I'll GLADLY try it) over this product anytime.\n\nI have to think that you folks who don't want it to go, are simply dreading the fact of losing some skills or knowledge. Is that what it is?\n\nWebFOCUS 8201, SP 0.1, Windows 7, HTML"
