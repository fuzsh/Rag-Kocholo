        "text": "NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Feb 24, 2014) - HIMSS Show Floor -- Today at the 2014 HIMSS Annual Conference and Expo, Information Builders, a leader in business intelligence (BI) and analytics, information integrity, and integration solutions, announced that healthcare providers are increasingly leveraging its solutions, WebFOCUS and iWay, to drive operational efficiencies and improve patient care.\n\nWith new business models emerging, new mandates for coordinated care, and new measures of accountability in place, healthcare providers are looking at BI, analytics, and data management as a foundation for unified information and evidence-based decision-making for business and clinical initiatives. In addition to building and maintaining complete patient records, a robust BI and analytics platform provides operational and strategic benefits, such as ensuring optimum patient care, better population health management, greater labor productivity, reduced costs and waste, improved financial management, and measurable compliance risk. Information Builders has numerous healthcare customers who use its solutions to achieve these and other benefits. These customers include:\n\nQuinte Health Care is a provider of high-quality healthcare services for 160,000 people throughout four hospitals in Ontario, Canada. The company includes 1,600 total members of staff who attend to 255 inpatient beds, four emergency departments, operating rooms at three sites, a rehabilitation day hospital, a children's treatment center, ambulatory care clinics, community mental health programs, and a range of diagnostic services. With all this to manage, Quinte Health Care needed a BI tool that delivered accessible, timely, and meaningful reports that effectively integrated information from numerous disparate sources. Prior to working with Information Builders, Quinte relied on a combination of independent software platforms to address its BI and reporting needs, which resulted in a complex system that failed to deliver, share, and analyze information in an effective and timely manner. To streamline these processes, the company implemented Information Builders' WebFOCUS and DataMigrator solutions, which enabled improved dissemination, analysis, and integration of data sets. Standardizing with Information Builders also enabled basic users to quickly develop complex reports and analytics, which greatly freed up resources and helped expedite and streamline business processes.\n\nMemorial Health System is a community-based non-profit corporation dedicated to patient care, education, and research. Thanks to its 5,900 staff members, partnering approved upon physicians and hundreds of volunteers, the organization is able to deliver health services to hundreds of thousands of area residents. Confronted with mountains of data, Memorial Health System needed to build a data warehouse with reporting capabilities that satisfied government regulations and provided more accurate information to the organization. The health system struggled with two key obstacles: the inability to access multiple types of data and an effective means of addressing data quality concerns, both requirements for an Enterprise Master Patient Index (EMPI). To address these challenges, Memorial Health System turned to Information Builders' WebFOCUS and Omni-Patientâ„¢ solutions. By implementing the technology, the organization was able to streamline data access, reporting, and analysis across numerous sources and ensure the accuracy of the data, which helped Memorial meet EMPI requirements and better manage patient data across departments.\n\nCasenet LCC is a leading provider of healthcare management software products whose flagship solution, TruCare, delivers a care management system for healthcare payers. Casenet needed a straightforward way to create standard interfaces for inbound and outbound transactions to and from its care management system. It also needed the ability to easily connect to numerous and diverse clinical systems located both in-house and outside of the organization. To address these requirements, Casenet selected Information Builders' iWay Integration Suite, which enabled the company to create reusable interfaces that can be easily built, deployed, and maintained. Whether invoked as web services or through other interfaces, these reusable components streamline the process of connecting TruCare with customers' applications and databases, which improves customer service, simplifies business processes, and frees up additional resources.\n\n\"Today's healthcare organizations process astounding amounts of data collected from numerous disparate systems every single day, which means analytics is no longer just a 'nice-to-have.' Effective data sharing and robust, easy-to-use analytics are critical to navigating the new healthcare landscape, and in many cases they can shape future success,\" said Gerald Cohen, president and CEO of Information Builders. \"Healthcare providers must be able to easily access and process all the data they receive -- regardless of source -- to ensure their patients' health and safety as well as the accuracy of core systems, like HR and finance. Information Builders is proud to equip our healthcare customers with the technology needed to not only streamline business processes and meet new demands, but also ensure a safe environment for patients and employees alike.\"\n\nVisit Information Builders at booth 4983 on the HIMSS show floor to learn how Information Builders' customers use BI, data integrity, and data integration solutions to improve processes and enhance care across their organizations. Attendees can also learn how Information Builders and its partner eco-system can help organizations stay agile and quickly adapt to the changing landscape using cutting edge technology. Information Builders partners with leading software and services organizations that best leverage WebFOCUS, iWay, and Omni software within the nuances of the healthcare industry. The company's more than 30 partners include Kronos, Press Ganey, NetApp, Presidio, SPi Healthcare, Axiom EPM, Beacon Partners, and Edgewater.\n\nFor partnership information, visit informationbuilders.com/partners, or email partners@ibi.com."
