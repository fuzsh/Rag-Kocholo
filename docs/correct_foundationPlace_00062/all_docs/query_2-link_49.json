        "text": "1 Calculation based on production data for Builders FirstSource READY-FRAME® precut framing packages and roof and floor trusses since January 1, 2019. An independent third-party study found that the lumber reduction from homes built with READY-FRAME®, compared to traditional stick-framed homes, equals approximately 7.8 trees per the average size US home of approximately 2,300 sq. ft. We calculate the number of homes supplied with READY-FRAME® using our average board footage processed per house, which is based on our 2019 READY-FRAME® saw production data and our 2019 data of actual homes produced with READY-FRAME®.The structural building components association (SBCA) study \"Framing the American Dream\" (sbcindustry.com/fad) found that stick-framed structures use 25% more lumber than manufactured components. We calculate the number of trees saved for homes using our roof and floor trusses using a 25% savings on total board footage production.\n\nPlease read more about our investments in sustainability and our CSR standards here."
