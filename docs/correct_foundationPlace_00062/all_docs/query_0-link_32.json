        "text": "Better data and evidence can help identify disparities in student success by race, ethnicity, and income and strengthen efforts to eliminate those disparities while also protecting student privacy and security. We support efforts to improve educational and workforce data systems so those systems count all students and their educational outcomesâ€”and so educators and policymakers can implement evidence-based practices that support more equitable outcomes. Students and their families can also benefit more directly by having access to data that help them make informed choices, especially as they navigate the transition from high school to postsecondary education, where most of them will take on debt.\n\nOur education system faces significant challenges in collecting, reporting, and using key data about student progress and outcomes, from early learning through K-12 and postsecondary education and into the workforce. These challenges hamper efforts to serve all students well, especially students of color and students from low-income backgrounds, whose outcomes are obscured when data are not disaggregated by race, income, and other key factors. They also prevent us from better understanding what is working to improve outcomes and why.\n\nStates and the federal government have made progress toward better connecting education and workforce data systems to count all students and their outcomes, so schools and institutions can use data to drive better and more equitable outcomes while protecting privacy and security. But critical gaps remain.\n\nWe want educators and policymakers to be empowered with the information they need to implement evidence-based practices that will support more equitable student outcomes. Students and their families should also have access to information, to help them make informed choices, especially as they navigate the transition from high school to postsecondary education, where most students will take on debt that impacts their futures. All students and families deserve to understand the return on their investment of time and resources.\n\nWe support the development of strong, aligned data systems at the national, state, and local levels that will serve as exemplars and support more equitable educational outcomes. We also support efforts and tools that use data to identify ways to serve all students more effectively and eliminate disparities in student success by race, ethnicity, and income."
