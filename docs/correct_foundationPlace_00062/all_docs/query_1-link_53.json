McCain III National Center for Environmental Conflict Resolution (National Center or NCECR). To learn more about our work, read our Quarterly Stories.\n\nThe Udall Foundation was established by the U.S. Congress in 1992 as an independent executive branch agency to honor Morris K. Udall's lasting impact on this nation's environment, public lands, and natural resources, and his support of the rights and self-governance of American Indians and Alaska Natives. The 1998 Environmental Policy and Conflict Resolution Act created the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, now called the John S. McCain III National Center for Environmental Conflict Resolution, as a program of the Udall Foundation to assist parties in resolving environmental, public lands, and natural resources conflicts nationwide that involve federal agencies or interests, and to provide training and capacity-building in collaboration, multiparty problem solving, and conflict resolution. In 2009, Congress enacted legislation to honor Stewart L. Udall and add his name to the Udall Foundation.\n\nMeet Our Board\n\nThe Board of Trustees supervises and directs the activities of the Udall Foundation. > MORE\n\nMeet Our Staff\n\nFind contact information for Udall Foundation staff. > MORE\n\nQuarterly Stories\n\nLearn about the Udall Foundation from the people we serve. > MORE\n\nAbout Morris Udall and Stewart Udall"
