        "text": "Given the global competition between cities, the Global Power City Index (GPCI) evaluates and ranks the major cities of the world according to their âmagnetism,â or their comprehensive power to attract people, capital, and enterprises from around the world. It does so through measuring 6 functionsâEconomy, Research and Development, Cultural Interaction, Livability, Environment, and Accessibilityâproviding a multidimensional ranking. The GPCI is able to grasp the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges of global cities in a continuously changing world not only through a ranking, but also through analyzing that rankingâs specific components.\n\nDownload the latest GPCI-2023 report\n\nLondon\n\nLondon, #1 position in the comprehensive ranking, increased its score for the first time in past three years. Londonâs strengths are driven by its cultural attractions and international airline network, with #1 position in the Cultural Interaction and #4 position in Accessibility. This city also maintains high rankings in other functions, with its lowest ranking in the Environment is #11, indicating that its strengths are wellbalanced.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York was trailed by London in the comprehensive ranking score this year. While New York is ranked #1 in Economy and R&D as in previous years, it has dropped to #28 in Environment, and has not improved its ranking in Livability function, which is ranked #38, the lowest of the six functions. It is characteristic of New York that there is such a large difference between its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTokyo\n\nTokyo, which has been closely trailed by #4 Paris since last year, maintained its #3 position in the comprehensive ranking by a narrow margin. This year Tokyo improved in the Livability by increasing its âCost of Livingâ score as well as the total score in the Cultural Interaction. However, in the Economy, it fell to #10, and it shows a clear division between growth and decline in the different functions.\n\nRelated Research\n\nGPCI-2023 Financial Centers\n\nThe Global Power City Index - Financial Centers (GPCI-Financial Centers), we evaluate the competitiveness of cities as international financial centers from a multifaceted perspective by adding âFinanceâ function to the six functions of the Global Power City Index (Economy, Research and Development, Cultural Interaction, Livability, Environment, and Accessibility). This allows us to uncover the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of each city as a financial center within the global financial system and rank them.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nFor more information about the Global Power City Index, please see the Summary or order the YEARBOOK. You can download the PDF version of the Summary below. The YEARBOOK provides specific details on the methods of research, definition of indicators, lists of data sources, and scores and ranking analysis of each city."
