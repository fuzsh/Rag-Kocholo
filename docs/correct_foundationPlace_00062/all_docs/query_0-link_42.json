This requires attention to policies and practices that exclude people and communities from participating.\n\nHow healthy is your community?\n\nSearch by State, County, or ZIP Code (e.g. New Mexico, Los Alamos, 87544)\n\nExplore the factors that influence health\n\nMany factors influence how well and how long we live, from our access to affordable housing or well-paying jobs to opportunities for a good education for our kids. The County Health Rankings model shows us how these factors work together and illustrates where we can take action to improve health and eliminate unjust barriers to opportunity.\n\nExplore the data. Review a strategy. Create change.\n\nCreating connected communities\n\nSee what's new from CHR&R"
