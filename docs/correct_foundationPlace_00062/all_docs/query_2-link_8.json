We engage with our part­ners in these pri­ma­ry impact areas:\n\nOur partners are at the center of our work.\n\nWe believe that those clos­est to the prob­lem are the ones best equipped to solve it. They are the thinkers and doers. Their work is at the cen­ter of our vision because they have the his­to­ry, rela­tion­ships, know-how, per­spec­tives, and expe­ri­ence to make change possible.\n\nHow We Give Working Together to Shift Markets and Minds for Good\n\nWe use a vari­ety of tools, includ­ing grant­mak­ing and impact invest­ing, to unlock and scale long-term pos­i­tive change. That means we work with entre­pre­neurs build­ing impact-dri­ven com­pa­nies and those financ­ing social inno­va­tion. But we know cap­i­tal­ism is imper­fect and not always able to deliv­er every solu­tion, so we work just as close­ly with advo­cates and non-prof­it orga­ni­za­tions seek­ing to change think­ing and pro­vide sus­tain­able, more equi­table ser­vices in our communities."
