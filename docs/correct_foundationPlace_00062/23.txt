Our office building

The foundation is committed to helping our community and offers meeting spaces free of charge on a first-come, first-served basis to nonprofit organizations. Note: We do not permit the space to be used for fundraising or political events.

Built in 2002, our building was the first in California and the fifth in the country to receive a gold-level certification under the U.S. Green Building Councilâ€™s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system.

Grantees and members of the public can submit comments anonymously through a third-party website. Responses are collected and relayed back to the foundation without any identifying information.
