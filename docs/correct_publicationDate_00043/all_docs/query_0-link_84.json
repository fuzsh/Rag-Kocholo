With the exception of two novels, a short novel with Ryk Spoor, and a few short stories I've written over the years for various anthologies, all my work fits into one broader setting or another. I'm an author who much prefers to work in big series. It's just the way my scribbler's mind works.\n\nI've listed the novels and stories in the order in which they should be read, insofar as possible. I say \"insofar as possible\" because in the case of two of these series—the 1632 series and the Joe's World series—there is no definite chronological order to the stories. The stories in the 1632 series frequently run parallel to each other, in chronological terms, and the chronological relationship between the various stories is the Joe's World series is . . . complex. The first three novels in the series form something of a circular narrative, with The Philosophical Strangler being both the first and third book in the series.\n\nStandalone stories:\n\nMother of Demons (1997)\n\nSlow Train to Arcturus, with Dave Freer (2008)\n\n\"The Thief and the Roller Derby Queen,\" published in The Chick is in the Mail, (2000), ed.
