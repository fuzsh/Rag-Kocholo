Nokia Qt’s biggest news this year is the transition of Qt to what is now a pure open governance model. Now known as the ‘Qt Project’, development of Qt will be driven through the qt-project.org website. The company says that this will provide the same “infrastructure and processes” for every programmer who wants to contribute to Qt. Some of the company’s developers seem to want to take community spirit into their own hands. “The Qt Project is a welcome development in the evolution of Qt. This move should allow for participation in the project from a broad set of developers based on the quality of their code. This is certainly a welcome change," said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation.
