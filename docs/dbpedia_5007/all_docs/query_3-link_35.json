        "text": "Starting Qt Creator¶\n\nStarting Qt Creator can be done from the Start-menu on Windows and from the application launcher on Mac OS X. When Qt Creator has been launched the main windows is shown in Fig. 6.\n\nOn the left side of the window, 2 toolbars are shown. The top toolbar controls the main program modes of Qt Creator. The lower toolbar is the project build toolbar, which controls how the projects are built and run.\n\nCreating a Fortran project¶\n\nTo use Qt Creator as a development environment for Fortran, a project has to be created. A project defines, which files that are required for building the program as well as any required settings. By default Qt Creator uses its own custom project format, but can also handle CMake based project, which is also what the installed Fortran plugins use.\n\nTo create a new project, select File/New file or project…* from the menu. This brings up the project/file creation window as shown in Fig. 7.\n\nNext, select Non-Qt Project and select the Plain Fortran application and click the Choose… Button as shown in Fig. 8.\n\nEnter a name and directory for your Fortran application and click Next. Next select the build system, CMake, in the next step shown in Fig. 9.\n\nClick Next to continue. In the next step we need to select which compiler toolchain to use. In Qt Creator a toolchain is called a kit. Select one of the presented kits as shown in Fig. 10.\n\nClick Next to continue. In the next step a versioning system can be selected, but this can be skipped, see Fig. 11.\n\nClick Finish to finish the project creation. If all worked a new CMake Fortran project should have been created as shown in Fig. 12"
