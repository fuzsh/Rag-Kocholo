Second, you have to choose the language to implement the application logic: C++, JavaScript, or Python.\n\nWhen you set up a new project in Qt Creator, a wizard guides you step-by-step through the process. The wizard templates prompt you to enter the settings that you need for that particular type of project and create the necessary files for you.\n\nYou can add your own custom wizards to standardize the way of adding subprojects and classes to a project. In the New Project and New File dialogs you can see an icon (1), a display name (2), and a description (3) of the wizard.\n\nIn most project wizards, you can choose the build system to use for building the project: qmake, CMake, Qbs, and possibly others, depending on which plugins you have installed. If you do not get to choose, the project usually uses CMake as the build system.\n\nYou can use wizards also to create plain C or C++ projects that use qmake, Qbs, or CMake, but do not use the Qt library.\n\nIn addition, you can import projects as generic projects that do not use qmake, Qbs, or CMake. Use Qt Creator as a code editor and fully control the steps and commands used to build the project."
