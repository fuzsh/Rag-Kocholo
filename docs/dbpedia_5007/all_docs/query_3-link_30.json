The IDE is available on all major desktop platforms, e.g. Windows/Mac/Linux. We have already seen customers using Qt Creator on an embedded device. Qt Creator has a lean efficient user interface and it really shines in making the developer productive. Qt Creator can be used to run your Qt Quick user interface but also to compile c++ code and this for your host system or for another device using a cross-compiler."
