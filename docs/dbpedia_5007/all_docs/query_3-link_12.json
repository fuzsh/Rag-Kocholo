While you can use CMake to target Qt (if you do, you should read more about the Visual Studio support for CMake), Qt also provides its own Qt-optimized build system called qmake.\n\nIf your project is using qmake, this article covers the high-level steps to follow to import your projects into Visual Studio. You can read about other C++ project types in the guide for Bringing your C++ code to Visual Studio.\n\nStep 1. Install the QT Visual Studio Extension. From the Marketplace, install the Qt Visual Studio Tools extension.\n\nStep 2. Import your .pro projects into Visual Studio. To do that, select the Qt VS Tools > Open Qt Project File (.pro) to let the extension create a VS solution and project from your existing Qt .pro file. More information on this is available in the Qt docs covering Qt project management in Visual Studio.\n\nWhatâ€™s next"
