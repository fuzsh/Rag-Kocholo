Among these 700 developers, 100 are the core developers of the open source project Qt.\n\nNokia is the main sponsor of the open source project Qt. According to Mirko Boehm, the core Qt team has around 100 people, this means that Nokia fires the whole Qt team.\n\nHe criticized Nokia's decision, he thought that a responsible CEO should persuade the team to move to other platforms.\n\nQt team is experienced, they are respectful in C++ development, there should be no problem for them to move to a new platform. But Nokia decides to fire the current team and hire a group of new developers.\n\nNokia made many mistakes in recent years.\n\nThey refused to join the Android camp and later they were defeated by Android.\n\nThey still adhere to the unacceptable Symbian platform.\n\nThey continue to release crap.\n\n...\n\nOk, now one more mistake: fire the Qt team.\n\nReference : http://blog.jobbole.com/22252/"
