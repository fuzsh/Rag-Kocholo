        "text": "Carlos Smith\n\nHuh, I'd wondered at the dropoff of traffic. I'd assumed people were using the forums more. I must have missed the announcement of the new mailing list.\n\nSo, thanks for sending this mail to remind us!\n\nCarlos\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: qt-interest-bounces+csmith=***@qt.nokia.com [mailto:qt-interest-bounces+csmith=***@qt.nokia.com] On Behalf Of K. Frank\n\nSent: Monday, February 13, 2012 9:12 AM\n\nTo: ***@qt-project.org; Qt-interest\n\nSubject: [Qt-interest] [Interest] [Qt-Interest] A request to shut down the qt-***@qt.nokia.com (\"Qt-Interest\") mailing list\n\nTo The List Administrators!\n\nI would like to respectfully request the administrators of the old \"Qt-Interest\"\n\nmailing list (qt-***@qt.nokia.com) to shut it down, preferably after a clear announcement to that effect, and possibly after a transition period.\n\nThis follows the discussion I cross-posted in the following threads:\n\n(old list)\n\nhttp://lists.qt.nokia.com/pipermail/qt-interest/2012-February/037263.html\n\n(new list)\n\nhttp://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/interest/2012-February/000741.html\n\n(Of course, anyone can run any mailing list he wants, so this is only a request. Also, if the Qt-Interest administrators do decide to shut that list down, how they proceed is up to them.)\n\nThe reasons for this request are as follows: Having two similar lists fragments the traffic, and it's a minor nuisance following two lists, remembering where to post, and searching the list archives. Also, no one has expressed a desire to keep the old Qt-Interest list going, or suggested a benefit to having two lists (e.g., a different emphasis or different topics covered).\n\nThanks, and Happy Listing!\n\nK. Frank\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nQt-interest mailing list\n\nQt-***@qt.nokia.com\n\nhttp://lists.qt.nokia.com/mailman/listinfo/qt-interest\n\nThis electronic message is intended only for the use of the individual or entity named above and may contain information which is privileged and/or confidential.
