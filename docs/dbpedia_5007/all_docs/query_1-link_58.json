        "text": "The KDE Free Qt Foundation is an organization with the purpose of securing the availability of the Qt toolkit\n\nfor the development of Free Software and\n\nin particular for the development of KDE software.\n\nThe Foundation has license agreements with Qt Group, Digia and Nokia. The agreements ensure that the Qt will continue to be available as Free Software. Should Qt Group discontinue the development of the Qt Free Edition under the required licenses, then the Foundation has the right to release Qt under a BSD-style license or under other open source licenses. The agreements stay valid in case of a buy-out, a merger or bankruptcy.\n\nLicenses and Platforms\n\nThe most recent agreement covers all releases of all Qt versions for the following platforms:\n\nCore Platforms: X11 (i.e. Desktop Linux) and Android â support cannot be dropped.\n\nAdditional Platforms: Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows Phone, Apple MacOS and Apple iOS â as long as they are supported at all by Qt Group.\n\nThe Foundation has the right to update to supported successor platforms (e.g. from X11 to Wayland) without additional negotiations with Qt Group.\n\nThe following license terms are required:\n\nAll parts of Qt are available under the GPLv3 or under a compatible license. Most parts are also available under the LGPLv3 and under the GPLv2.\n\nThe core libraries of Qt (Essentials) and all existing LGPL-licensed Qt add-ons must continue to be available under the LGPLv3.\n\nGPLv2-compatibility must kept for all existing GPLv2-licensed Qt code and for the core part of Qt (Essentials) and for the Qt applications. Future versions of the GPL are supported âif approved by the KDE Free Qt Foundationâ.\n\nApplications included in Qt (e.g. Qt Creator) must be licensed under GPLv2 and GPLv3. Two GPL exceptions clarify:\n\ngenerated code is not license-restricted, and\n\nbridges to third party applications are still possible.\n\nNew add-ons for Qt must use GPLv3 and may optionally also offer GPLv2 and/or LGPLv3. The stricter rules above continue to apply if existing functionality is replaced by new modules.\n\nIf these license terms are not yet present at the time of the Qt release, then they must be applied within a timeframe of not more than 12 months.\n\nThe agreement also protects the free license of all publicly developed code â even when it has not yet been included in a Qt release.\n\nBoard Members\n\nThe board of the Foundation consists of two members for Qt Group and two members for KDE e.V. Decisions of the Foundation are taken by vote of the board members. In case of a tie the votes of the KDE representatives decide.\n\nThe KDE e.V. appointed as board members of the KDE Free Qt Foundation the following people:\n\nAlbert Astals Cid\n\nOlaf Schmidt-WischhÃ¶fer\n\nThe current voting members for Qt Group are:\n\nJuhapekka Niemi\n\nTuukka Turunen\n\nThe Trolltech founders are advising members without voting right:\n\nEirik Eng\n\nHaavard Nord\n\nStatutes\n\nStatutes of the KDE Free Qt Foundation (72 KiB)\n\nOrganizaton Number\n\nThe KDE Free Qt Foundation has organization number 995147629 in the Norwegian Foundation Registry\n\nHistory\n\nThe Foundation was originally founded by Trolltech and the KDE e.V. in 1998. After Nokia bought Trolltech, the statutes were updated accordingly. In May 2004, a first update to the agreement was made. This agreement addressed the purpose in a more precise and complete way. The intention and basic content however, were not changed. In July 2009, the agreement was again updated to respond both to the relicensing of Qt to the LGPL license and to the merger of Trolltech into Nokia. In November 2009, the statutes of the Foundation where also updated to better fit the new situation.\n\nIn October 2011, Nokia launched the Qt Project, allowing both companies and individuals to contribute to the development of Qt under open governance terms. To ensure the fairness of the contribution terms to individual developers, two lawyers were contracted by the KDE Free Qt Foundation. Nokia took their feedback into account and made is thus possible for the KDE Free Qt Foundation to support both the launch of the Qt Project and the wording improvements in the Qt Contribution License Agreement 1.1: âWe fully support the work being done with the Qt Project. An openly governed Qt is in the best interests of all Qt developers. The Open Governance structure of the Qt Project empowers developers to influence the direction and the pace of Qt development. Stakeholders in the future of Qt, such as KDE, can now contribute according to their own priorities and take ownership over areas of Qt that are of particular importance to them.â (Olaf Schmidt-WischhÃ¶fer and Martin Konold, the two board members from KDE)\n\nIn September 2012, Digia bought Qt from Nokia and signed a letter of commitment to be bound by any and all terms of agreement, and then continued to sign a revised agreement with the foundation. Later Digia founded The Qt Company, which signed a similar letter of commitment and negotiated an update to the agreement. Today it is known as Qt Group, with the original agreements remaining in force.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nThe foundation has signed a new agreement with Qt Group (11 MiB; as text 301 KiB).\n\nBelow is the Notification Letter signed by The Qt Company on March 23, 2015:\n\nNotification Letter about Qt Asset Transfer 2015 (345 KiB).\n\nIn April 2013, an agreement between the foundation and Digia (1.5 Mi B) was signed.\n\nBelow is the Letter of Commitment signed by Digia on September 17, 2012:\n\nDigiaâs Letter of Commitment (2.6 MiB)\n\nBelow is a list of the pages of the document containing the agreement between the KDE Free Qt Foundation and Nokia from 2009:\n\nSoftware License Agreement: page 1 page 2 page 3 page 4 page 5\n\nBSD License (Exhibit A): page 6\n\nOpen Source Definition (Exhibit B): page 7 page 8\n\nNokia Qt LGPL Exception (Exhibit C): page 9\n\nBelow is a list of the pages of the document containing the second agreement between the KDE Free Qt Foundation and Trolltech from May 2004:\n\nThe Agreement: page 1, page 2, page 3, page 4\n\nBSD-style License (Exhibit A)\n\nThe Open Source Definition (Exhibit B): page 1, page 2\n\nOriginal Agreement (1998)\n\nBelow is a list of the pages of the document containing the original agreement between the KDE Free Qt Foundation and Trolltech from June 1998:\n\nTitle page\n\nThe Agreement: page 1, page 2\n\nQt Free Edition license (Exhibit 1): page 3, page 4\n\nOriginal KDE Free Qt Foundation Statutes (Exhibit 2): page 5, page 6\n\nBSD-style License (Exhibit 3)\n\nContribution License Agreement 1.1 (2010)"
