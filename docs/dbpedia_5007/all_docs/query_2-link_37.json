One day, it started hanging on clicking \"File--->Open a New File or Project\".\n\nI have reinstalled QT 5.6.1 multiple times, but it still hangs on that. I tried the same for QT OpenSource 4.9.2 and 5.3.0, but they also show the same issue.\n\nHave attached the screenshot on which QT hangs whenever I click on \"Open a File or Project\"\n\nPlease help\n\nThanks\n\nUPDATE: It also hangs on \"File->Open File With ...\"\n\nFurther, it shows no issue on \"File->New Project\"\n\nHowever, when I choose, say, Widgets---->OK---->Browse for project folder location, it stucks there also.\n\nSo, basically anything related to opening my filesystem from QT causes hangs without even opening a new window for opening file/project\n\nNo other menu option click has any such issues"
