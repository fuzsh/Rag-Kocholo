        "text": "I'm just, well, sad... I was happy to see that Nokia is about to find it's right path again, making better and better Symbian, and developint MeeGo. And now all my dreams about to break... Maybe it's a little to dramatic, but I really feel like this now. I would hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid I'm not. :(\n\n(oh and ecosystem is just another word to bull's.hit...)\n\nAs I posted in the Qt Ambassador Group:\n\nI am kind of disappointed by Nokia today I must say. The Announcement of a kind-of full shift to Windows Phone, without really mentioning any promising plans for Qt or MeeGo, makes me sad.\n\nYou have earned a lot of respect in the Linux- and Developerscene with your envolvment for Qt.\n\nThis is now all at stake, what is the Future of Qt with Nokia?\n\nQt at its own will survive for sure, as its a competitive Framework ready to hit the market.\n\nBut what Part will Nokia play?\n\nWhat will happen to Projects like Qt Creator now?\n\nAlso, imho, don’t expect that the devs shift now to WP7, as its a different ecosystem.\n\nThe promise that you gave last fall, that Qt is the one and only software platform is already kind of broken by now.\n\nI still have faith in Qt. Qt has a bright future,\n\nDon't be so down on Qt. It's just as great today as it was yesterday.\n\nThere are still many people and companies using Qt. I was pleased to see how quickly Intel was able to announce their continued support for meego. There are many companies using Qt on the desktop, and in their devices, it is still the right choice.\n\nYes, I would have liked to see Qt on WinMo, but frankly, as good as that would have been for us, it would have fragmented the WinMo ecosystem.\n\nDon't assume that no news is bad news, Yes, WinMo is going to take the limelight position, and we don't know where Qt winds up within Nokia. Nokia has been good for Qt. Give Nokia management time to work their plans.\n\nQt has a bright future...\n\nIf Nokia choose to continue to support Qt, its because they have interest in it moving forward, -even if they can't publicly say what that interest is.\n\nIf Nokia has no interest in Qt, it still has value and they will sell it.\n\nIf for some reason, Qt got dropped on the floor, there is still the LGPL. I know of many companies will come together to support the LGPL version.\n\nQt has a bright future....\n\nPeter Winston\n\nOh, this hurts my heart.\n\nI just posted this on the QML-interest thread, re-posting here, because of how serious I believe this issue to be.\n\nWith Nokia backing Windows Phone 7, and (implied) abandonment of MeeGo, ... that really puts QML into question.\n\nIMHO, all the world is moving to \"declarative property exposure\" separating the business logic from the interface, and hands down Qt/QML was the BEST platform I've ever seen -- and defined the best-of-breed among today's declarative property interface development paradigms.\n\nThis Nokia abandonment hurts my heart. Nokia screwed up royally here -- I can no longer recommend that our company pursue QML commercial development seriously now. Microsoft will win big (they needed attention on WinPhone7), and they kill the strongest competitor possible (Qt/QML/MeeGo). Nokia will be screwed when they wake up one morning in the not-distant future, realizing their developers have left them, they have mediocre tools and platform, and no longer control their own operating system.\n\nQuite seriously, the new Nokia CEO from Microsoft seems to still be working for Microsoft. This will inevitably become the developer equivalent stupidity to the \"New Coke\" introduction, and the \"AOL/Times Warner\" merger.\n\nSo sad.\n\nUmmm why don't we just take Qt and start something new we don't need Meego or Symbian or even Nokia Devices.\n\nWe could create a new mobile platform.\n\nFor the Operating System you have:\n\n1. Cross Linux From Scratch\n\n2. OpenEmbedded\n\nToolset:\n\nQt SDK and Qt Mobility libraries and Qt Creator IDE\n\navailable under LGPL\n\nLegal Representation:\n\nhttp://www.softwarefreedom.org/\n\nFor the Hardware:\n\nhttp://www.liquidware.com/\n\nhttp://pandaboard.org/\n\nhttp://beagleboard.org/\n\nhttp://www.gumstix.com/\n\nhttp://www.arduino.cc/\n\nhttp://www.sparkfun.com/\n\nhttp://www.magictouch.com/\n\nAnd a about a million manufactures in china willing to do\n\ncustom oem work with no minimum purchase.\n\nAnd as far as Meego goes in my opinion they are still utilizing to much of gtk. Designing a new Desktop Environment would not he all that difficulty.\n\nFinancial Backing:\n\nUbuntu is ready for Qt.\n\nOperating System Developers:\n\nOpenSuse was also just sold down the river.\n\nCustomers:\n\nLol just about every linux user on the planet.\n\nJust an idea. I know one thing as of today I am going to start keeping my own repos. Just in case Nokia decides to axe Qt on use all-together.\n\nNokia say that Windows Phone will be the primary smartphone strategy, implying there will be others - but it's unclear what form that will take?\n\nThey say a Meego device will still be released this year - perhaps they still intend to keep Meego for tablets?\n\nThe mention of 150 million more Symbian devices carries the clear implication that it will come to an end, and will be phased out to be replaced by WP.\n\nI think it's a shame that they won't do Symbian for the low end. A great thing about Symbian is its lower system requirements, and as phone technology advances, I wonder if lower end phones could run it (you can already get Symbian phones like the Nokia 5230 for under £70). It would compete better than Android here, and wipe the floor with similarly priced \"feature phone\" OSs.\n\nClearly Nokia aren't going to ditch their low end phones (which sell an awful lot). But it seems sad to me if they phase out Symbian, whilst keeping S40 around!\n\nBad news indeed, but by no means disruptive news for Qt as a whole. Apart from having been on the track of becoming one of the big 3 dev plattforms for mobile apps and yesterday been pulled off this track, Qt is still the best generall application framework around. That will not change in the near future.\n\nFor desktop app devs nothing really changes. I don't think Qt will be unmaintained and neglegted. Maybe some features not related to mobile apps will get more attention?\n\nIf you have put all your hopes and business in the mobile market, then you have to jump on another framework. Mobile apps are all about \"ecosystems\" (I hate this word ...). That part is really the problem there, as an ecosystem needs a huge company's effort. But for you as a developer: Not a problem. If you have been smart enough to learn Qt, you can learn Java, obj-c or C# with ease. No braincell committed to Qt is wasted! C# as a language doesn't seem to be too bad ... uuups, did I just write or only think this? :-)\n\nSo, heads up! Qt might have just lost the prospect of becoming the greatest from being great. But that takes nothing away from still being great!\n\nIndeed. Betrayal of the Qt devs is what comes to my mind. In october putting up a whole charade, claiming that Qt would be the platform for all Nokia's. That they were betting the company on it. A few short months later, the certificates from the exams taken there not even in the mail yet(!), Nokia practically dumps Qt. It is a knife in the back.\n\nIn my opinion, it seems Nokia wasted way too much time with first building Meamo, and then starting all over with Meego, and first setting Symbian apart, and then pulling it back into the company again. How long will this WP7 adventure last? Untill the company is really drowned?\n\nSymbian/Meego with Qt was an unbeatable platform.\n\nSymbian sales are still increasing rapidly (faster than iOS sales). There were an extra 10 million Symbian devices sold this year compared to last year. For iOS, 8 million.\n\nIn the last 2 months of 2010, 5 million Symbian^3 handsets were sold. WP7? 2 million.\n\nA massive 100 million Symbian handsets sold last year. More than all iOS and Android handsets combined. It broke a world record.\n\nYou can't expect the marketshare to remain above 30%, however, with all these new competitors in the market that weren't there before.\n\nWhat happens when you have a monopoly and it turns in to a duopoly, now an oligopoly. Yes, marketshare obviously falls. Nokia had a massive marketshare but for them to maintain this means the other players are doing something very wrong. They aren't. That Symbian is still increasing in sales in 2011 shows that the platform is not dying at all.\n\nNokia doing a deal with Microsoft isn't a bad thing. They should have shared ecosystems. That is, Microsoft Office/Live/Zune/Xbox in exchange for free Navteq map data and using Bing search and ads on their device.\n\nThrow in Qt support for Visual Studio and WP7 which benefits both parties.\n\nBut to adopt WP7 is just wrong in every single way. Two years before they transition? Did they really think Symbian/Meego/Qt would take longer than this to clean up and mature? Imagine what Qt would have looked like in 2 years with the leaps and bounds it has been making.\n\nIn the Q & A talk I watched as I tried to understand Elop's grand plan I heard Elop explain that he will release a single Meego tablet so that he may \"learn\" from it. That is, an experiment. Sounds like Maemo all over again.\n\nThe thing that scares me is that someone from the Guardian asks:\n\nGuardian: \"But who would buy a Meego device if it's going to be dead ...?\"\n\nElop: \"Well, I think you're answering your own question. If in fact something is dead, then it's best not to ship it.\"\n\nWow, even 2 days didn't past since new Nokia strategic declaration and you have already buried Nokia and Qt. Who you think you are? Prophets? Say me, please, when the UFO eventually come to Earth I need to be ready.\n\nSeriously, nothing bad has been happened. I really like Nokia phones, I really like MS products and enjoy with Qt framework development. Nokia will have a great profit from this connection as well as Microsoft will. And I'm sure Qt will have a great future too. Just be patient. At the moment NOTHING DISASTROUS HAPPENED.\n\n\"This post\":http://blog.qt.nokia.com/2011/02/12/nokia-new-strategic-direction-what-is-the-future-for-qt/ explains something but there are again too many crying children in the comments. It seems they don't read anything and don't think about anything except mythical betrayal of them by Nokia. It is a business baby(c).\n\nI don't want to make prediction but my opinion is that this union will give great phones in the market and Qt will be growing not slower than it did for past 2 years.\n\nMen just do not cry around. You are programmer or what?"
