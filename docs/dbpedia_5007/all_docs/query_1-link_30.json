While a fee hasn't been mentioned, it's reportedly a \"fraction\" of the $150 million that Nokia originally paid when purchasing Trolltech in 2008 -- which probably won't improve matters on the handset maker's balance sheet.\n\nShow full PR text\n\nDigia to Acquire Qt from Nokia\n\nFurther extends the cross-platform availability of Qt on mobile, embedded and desktop\n\nHELSINKI & SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Digia, the software powerhouse listed on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki exchange (DIG1V), today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Qt software technologies and Qt business from Nokia. Following the acquisition Digia becomes responsible for all the Qt activities formerly carried out by Nokia. These include product development, as well as the commercial and open source licensing and service business. Following the acquisition, Digia plans to quickly enable Qt on Android, iOS and Windows 8 platforms.\n\nOne of Digia's key objectives with this acquisition is to improve its position within the Qt ecosystem by further strengthening Qt's R&D capabilities and expanding its reach on many more platforms than ever before. Since Digia acquired the Qt Commercial licensing business from Nokia in March 2011, the operation has continued to be successful and has grown substantially. Digia forecasts the acquisition's impact on its 2012 revenues to be positive. In the following years, Digia forecasts the Qt business to grow. As part of the transaction, a maximum of 125 Qt people from Nokia will transfer to Digia, mostly based in Oslo, Norway and Berlin, Germany. This business transaction will significantly strengthen Digia's product business and supports Digia's strategic objective to grow internationally.\n\nDigia encourages all current ecosystem members to continue working on improving Qt with full confidence in Digia's continued investment to make Qt the leading cross-platform development framework. Digia will work with ecosystem members to secure a successful release of Qt5 and is committed to continuing the Qt Project in order to maintain Qt's availability under both open source and commercial licenses.\n\n\"We are looking forward to welcoming the Qt team to Digia. By adding this world class organization to our existing team we plan to build the next generation leading cross-platform development environment,\" said Tommi Laitinen, SVP, International Products, Digia. \"Now is a good time for everyone to revisit their perception of Qt. Digia's targeted R&D investments will bring back focus on Qt's desktop and embedded platform support, while widening the support for mobile operating systems.\"\n\n\"Nokia is proud of the contributions we've made to Qt over the past four years. We are pleased that we've been able to work with Digia to secure continued development of Qt by the current core team,\" said Sebastian Nystr√∂m, head of Nokia Strategy. \"Digia's plans to acquire Qt mean that it can continue as a successful open source project and also offer continuing employment for many people in the community.\"\n\nQt has been used by over 450,000 developers and thousands of leading companies worldwide in over 70 industries to power the most innovative, mission-critical and renowned applications and UIs. Qt Commercial is a leader in a number key market segments including automotive, medical, advanced visualization & animation, industrial automation and aerospace & defense. In the future, Digia expects that Qt will have a key role bringing world-class user experience and user interfaces to embedded systems and consumer electronics.\n\nMore information will be available shortly on qt.digia.com and qt-project.org which will be the main information-sharing sites for Qt."
