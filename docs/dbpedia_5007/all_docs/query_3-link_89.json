Complete your UI design through quick iterations using Live Preview. Tweak everything, like colors, animations, geometries, or text. and verify the changes instantly. Build a responsive UI from a single design. Target different screen resolution and sizes with flexible layouts. Enjoy flexibility that only a native application can provide: Access full operating system APIs, utilize all CPU and GPU cores, connect to any peripheral. Slint compiles your UI design to machine code. Achieve low footprint and minimal resource consumption. The Slint runtime fits in less than 300KiB RAM, features a reactive property system, and is built with Rust. Deliver a smooth user experience. Slint uses the optimal graphics rendering method: GPU accelerated, DMA2D, Framebuffer, or Linebuffer. Continue using your favourite IDE. Choose between our generic language server and VS Code extension: Enjoy code completion, live-preview, code navigation, diagnostics, and syntax highlighting.",

The HMI scales to 15-inch and 32-inch touch displays that are installed on the EV chargers and provides additional business opportunities for charging station operators.\n\nWe're proud to share that the HMI is #MadeWithSlint.\n\nDescribe the UI in a language akin to HTML/CSS allowing a separation between the presentation layer and business logic.\n\nDesigning the UI independently speeds up the design process."
