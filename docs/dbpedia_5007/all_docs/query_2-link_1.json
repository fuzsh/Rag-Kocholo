        "text": "\"In the summer of 1990 Haavard [Nord] and Eirik [Chambe-Eng] were working together on a C++ database application for ultrasound images. The system needed to be able to run with a GUI on Unix, Macintosh, and Windows. One day that summer, Haavard and Eirik went outside to enjoy the sunshine, and as they sat on a park bench, Haavard said, \"We need an object-oriented display system.\" The resulting discussion laid the intellectual foundation for the object-oriented cross-platform GUI framework they would soon go on to build.\"[1]\n\nTimeline\n\n1990 Qt conceived by Haavard Nord and Eirik Chambe-Eng on a park bench in Trondheim, Norway.\n\n1995 Troll Tech 1st public release on 20 May.
