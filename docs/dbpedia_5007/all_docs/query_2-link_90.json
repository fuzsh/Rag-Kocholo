        "text": "The inner pot of the cooker (the stainless steel cooking pot), the sealing ring, the lid, and the steam rack are all dishwasher safe—yet another way in which your cooker makes cooking and cleanup extremely easy. Here is an overview of how best to care for and clean your Instant Pot®.\n\nPrior to cleaning, ensure the cooker is unplugged and has cooled down.\n\nCooker Base and Heating Element\n\nThe cooker base is home to the microprocessor and the heating element essential to cooking.\n\nDo Not Place in the Dishwasher! If the cooker base gets wet, allow it to dry completely. Contact the Customer Care team.\n\nClean the exterior of the cooker base with a damp cloth. You can use a slightly damp cloth to clean the inside of the cooker. It is however, important that the cooker be kept dry.\n\nIf you need to clean the area around the lip of the cooker, use a damp cloth or an old toothbrush to clean the edges.\n\nStainless Steel Inner Pot & Steam Rack\n\nThe inner pot and the steam rack are made of sturdy, food-grade stainless steel (304 – 18/8) and are entirelydishwasher safe. For the most part, you can keep the inner pot cleaned just as you would clean any stainless steelpot—by hand washing or the dishwasher.\n\nShould the inner pot develop harmless water stains, non-abrasive scouring cleanser, made especially for cookingpots, brings back the original shine.\n\nYou can also periodically clean the inner pot by placing 1 cup of white vinegar in the bottom of the inner pot. Allow it to rest for 5 minutes, and then pour out the vinegar and rinse.\n\nRemoving Bluish Marks from Your Stainless Steel Inner Pot\n\nInstant Pot’s inner pot (cooking pot) is stainless steel, food grade 304 (18/8) with no chemical coating. It is durable and will retain its appearance for years to come with proper care.\n\nWith stainless steel cookware it is not uncommon for a bluish or “rainbow” discoloration to appear on the inside of the pot, and Instant Pot’s inner pot is no exception. Minerals or salt in the food and water are the cause forthis discoloration. It may be easily removed by using a non-abrasive stainless steel cleaner, which will not only remove the marks it will help to retain the original brightness.\n\nAnother option is to cover the bottom with white vinegar. Allow the vinegar to sit for 5 minutes, remove, andrinse the inner pot. The discoloration marks should be removed completely.\n\nFor “White Hard Water” stains, they can be removed with a damp sponge soaked in vinegar or lemon.\n\nWe recommend avoiding steel wool, as it will scratch the surface. For additional information, verify “ eHow” or “British Stainless Steel Association”.\n\nThe images illustrate an Instant Pot® inner pot after an 8-month period of regular use and the results after using white vinegar to clean the stains.\n\nLid\n\nThe lid is top-rack dishwasher safe. It is best to remove the sealing ring and the anti-block shield so that the lid may be thoroughly cleaned. One way to prevent the lid from retaining odors is to place it upside down on the pot until it has completely dried or you are ready to use it. Verify the steam release valve and float valve, and make sure there is no food or other debris that would block them, and prevent your cooker from coming to pressure\n\nAnti-block Shield\n\nThe anti-block shield underneath the lid should be removed and cleaned after each use, especially following the preparation of foods that may splatter.\n\nTo remove, using your thumb, push the side of the anti-block shield towards the lid rim and lift up. It may take a little effort, but the anti-block shield should pop out.\n\nYou can now wash the shield with warm, soapy water. Rinse, wipe dry with a soft cloth, and place back in position when dry. To position the anti-block shield in place, push down.\n\nSealing Ring\n\nThe sealing ring is made of high-quality, heat-resistant silicone. It can be hand-washed with soapy water or placed in the dishwasher. Allow the ring to dry completely before inserting back into the lid. Ensure the sealing ring is positioned in the lid after every wash, and that it is securely in place before you start cooking.\n\nThe sealing ring is critical in the functioning of your cooker. Inspect it carefully after it is washed. Any sign of cracking or other damage, replace the sealing ring. Replace only with Genuine Instant Pot® sealing rings, using other brands may void your Instant Pot® Warranty.\n\nAs silicone may pick-up food odors during cooking you may wish to have one sealing ring for savory and another for sweet foods.\n\nUnder normal conditions it should be fine for 18 – 24 months. If you notice cracks, leaking or deformation in the sealing ring, it should be replaced immediately. However, the sealing ring is porous and may absorb odors and become discolored. To avoid discoloration and odors, you may wish to change the sealing ring every 6 – 12months.\n\nCondensation Collector\n\nThe condensation collector is to be removed and hand washed periodically. Allow to dry before replacing.\n\nTo Summarize\n\nAll parts of the Instant Pot® with the exception of the cooker base are dishwasher safe. This includes the stainless steel inner pot, the lid, the sealing ring, and the steam rack. The cooker base must be kept dry, and canbe wiped down with a damp cloth when necessary. The anti-block shield should be washed after each use and re-installed.\n\n5-5-5 or 6-6-6: A method used to prepare eggs in your Instant Pot®. It refers to 5 minutes on high pressure, 5 minutes natural release and 5 minutes ice-bath prior to peeling.\n\nAnti-Block Shield: The round metal part with 5 holes underneath the lid. It is designed to prevent food particles from interfering with the steam release valve. It should be removed and cleaned after each use, especially following the preparation of foods that may splatter. To remove using your thumb, push the side of the anti-block shield towards the lid rim and lift up. It may take a little effort, but the anti-block shield will pop out.\n\nBurn: There may be insufficient water/broth in the inner pot, or food may be too close or stuck to the bottom of the inner pot with all the liquid on top.\n\nCondensation Collector: The cup positioned at the rear of your Instant Pot®. It is used to capture any condensation that develops during cooking. Note: The Lux series does not include a condensation collector.\n\nCooker Base: Contains the microprocessor and the heating element. Never place anything on the inside of the cooker base without the stainless steel inner pot in position. The cooker base and lid must be kept away from external heat source, as it will damage the base and the lid.\n\nDelay Start or Timer (older models): Sets the time delay before a cooking program starts.\n\nDual Pressure: The cooker includes both pressure settings low and high\n\nEPC: Electric Pressure Cooker\n\nFloat Valve (Pin): The silver or red pin beside the steam valve, when it is up, your cooker is fully pressurized; when it drops it is no longer pressurized and you can open the cooker.\n\nHP: High Pressure mode\n\nLP: Low Pressure mode\n\nManual or Pressure Cook (newer models): Use Manual/Pressure Cook program to set custom time and/or pressure level when you pressure cook.\n\nNatural Release (NR or NPR): Allow the cooker to cool down naturally until the float valve drops down. This may take 10 to 40 minutes, or even longer, depending on the amount of food in the cooker. After the cooking process is completed, the cooker will go into the “Keep Warm” mode if it has been turned ON.\n\nPC: Pressure Cooker\n\nPIP: Pot-in-Pot, refers to placing another pot inside your stainless steel inner pot to prepare a dish.\n\nQuick Release (QR or QPR): Turn the Steam Release handle or press the Quick Release Button to the “Venting” position to let out steam until the float valve drops down. QR is not suitable for food with large liquid volume or high starch content such as: oatmeal, porridge, beans, sticky liquids, starchy soup, etc. as food content may splatter out, use Natural Release (NR) instead.\n\nSealing Ring: The silicone ring positioned underneath the lid. The sealing ring must be in position for the pressure cooker to come to pressure. Made of high-quality, heat-resistant silicone. The sealing ring is critical to the proper functioning of your Instant Pot®, it must always be positioned properly on the underside of the lid. Only use Genuine Instant Pot® sealing rings, other brands will void your warranty.\n\nSling: Used for PIP to easily remove the pot from the inner pot. Slings can be in silicone or aluminum foil.\n\nStainless Steel Inner Pot: The inner pot that is positioned inside the cooker base, where the food and liquid are placed. Made from food grade 304 (18/8) stainless steel, 3-ply bottom for even heat distribution, no chemical coating, compliant with FDA food safety standards. Dishwasher safe.\n\nSteam Rack (Trivet): The steam rack is positioned inside the stainless steel inner pot. It is used to elevate food or your dish above the water in the bottom of the inner pot while you pressure cook.\n\nSteam Release handle or Quick Release Button (Ultra): The valve that seals in or releases steam when you pressure cook. Ensure the valve is in the “Sealing” position. This is how the pressure cooker will come up to pressure. It is normal while building pressure for small amounts of steam to release through the knob. Turning the knob to “Venting” will release the pressure. The steam release handle does not lock tightly it will fit loosely on the lid.\n\nWater Test (Initial Test Run): To help you become familiar with your Instant Pot® and to ensure the cooker is functioning properly.\n\nPRESSURE COOK/MANUAL – This is the setting you’re likely to use the most. The temperature, pressure levels, and cooking times can be controlled through the operation keys on the control panel. Here, press the Pressure Level key to adjust the pressure level and the +/- keys to change the cooking time\n\nSOUP/BROTH – Brings soups to a slow simmer, and results in a clear broth. For meatless soups, use the Less mode; for soups with meat, use the Normal mode; for soups that requires longer cook times, such as rich bone broth, use the More mode.\n\nMEAT/STEW – Best for cooking large cuts of meat at high pressure.

Use the Less mode to pasteurize dairy products; use the Normal mode for low pressure sterilization and canning of acidic fruits and vegetables; use the More mode for high pressure sterilization and canning of acidic fruits and vegetables\n\nYOGURT – The Less mode is designed for Jiu Niang, a sweet fermented rice dish; the Normal mode is for fermenting milk when making yogurt, while the More mode is for pasteurizing milk\n\nKEEP WARM – 3 temperatures to maintain food at different serving temperatures\n\n***************IP-LUX and IP-DUO models are NOT affected*******************\n\nDear Instant Pot SMART Owner,\n\nLast night we found out about a manufacturing issue with “Instant Pot SMART” (the new Bluetooth enabled model, sold only in the US and Canada). After extensive use this issue may lead to electrical leakage from the thermal probe (the shiny, elevated component in the middle of the heating element). As a result, this may cause an electrical shock. This problem is estimated to occur in only about 3~4 in a thousand units.\n\nOther Instant Pot models (IP-DUO, IP-LUX and IP-CSG) are NOT affected.\n\n“IP” stands for “Instant Pot”, “50” or “60” relates to the size, ie 5 or 6 quart/liter. ONLY the “Smart-60” model with a Datecode between 1410 and 1503, purchased before June 1, 2015, is affected.\n\nTo avoid any risk, please stop using your Instant Pot SMART. Please RETAIN your unit until further instructions.\n\nWe are very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause you. Your Instant Pot SMART will be replaced at no cost to you. On the bright side, this will upgrade the firmware in your Instant Pot SMART. This recall is applicable for IP-Smart purchased before June 1, 2015.\n\nWe will contact you again via email about the replacement process. If you didn’t receive the recall email, please contact our support team at support@instantpot.com.
