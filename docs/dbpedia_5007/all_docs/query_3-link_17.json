        "text": "This QT project for beginners aims to develop a media player application, capable of playing the audio and video files. It will enable participants to implement a stable player which will perform:\n\nMedia list creation on UI\n\nPlaying the next track when current track ends\n\nCreation of play, pause, next and previous buttons with respective functionalities\n\nTracking current track’s play time along with the overall time\n\nUpdate current track information in title.\n\nBy the end of this project participant will be able to build an application for a cross-platform that includes desktop and embedded target like Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe goal of this QT project for beginners is to provide participants a real-time hands-on exposure in creating a car digital dashboard. Given that automotive are getting smarter this project will help you to understand exporting all critical data to the user so that effective decisions can be made. It will help you to create compact, reliable and effective solution for digital car dashboard. This involves car sensor simulator and graphical live status. Using Qt control window all possible car environment will be simulated. Graphic live status must update real time status and should be independent to integrate with real sensor input easily.\n\nThe goal of this QT project for beginners is to build a local/internet based video chatting tool that enables users to join real time streaming video chat rooms, where users can share their video with multiple users. It’s a server/client based application, client request for a connection and server accept the connections and keeps all the database. Adding and deleting of members and multiple user video conferencing is possible here. By the end of this project you will gain significant knowledge on TCP/IP network and developing a network based application."
