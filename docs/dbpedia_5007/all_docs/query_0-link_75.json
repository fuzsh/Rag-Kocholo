        "text": "Nokia Qt Labs announced the alpha release of Qt 5 C++ application development framework, which focuses on the delivery of Qt Essential modules for Qt 5.\n\nThis new version of Qt goal is to bring the focus to a model, although native Qt using C++ would still be used to implement modular backend functionality for Qt Quick. The developers explains that this module is working nicely on Qt for embedded system where UIs are full screen, but more work is needed on the desktop, and it will only be fully implemented in Qt 5.1 or 5.2.\n\nQt developers make 4 big architectural changes to Qt internal architecture:\n\nBase all Qt ports on Qt Platform Abstraction layer (QPA) to make it easier to port Qt to other windowing systems and devices.\n\nRe-architect Qt graphics stack using a a Scenegraph on top of OpenGL to increase performance versus Qt 4, using Qt Quick and OpenGL (ES) 2.0\n\nModular repository structure for increased flexibility and to meet the merge of desktop and mobile which allows to add /remove user specific modules as needed and a full integration of the Qt mobility APIs\n\nSeparate all QWidget related functionality into its own library\n\nQt 5.0 alpha release also brings new functionalities in different part of Qt:\n\nQt Core\n\nQStandardPaths class which provides the standard locations for things such as media and documents on your platform.\n\nJSON parser and speed optimized binary format for JSON.\n\nMimetype recognition support, both on extension and file content.\n\nCompile time checked signal/slot connection syntax as well as a new Perl compatible regular expression engine.\n\nMany data structures have been rewritten and optimized for better performance.\n\nC++11 support, although Qt can still be compiled and work with a C++98 compliant compiler.\n\nQt Gui\n\nQtWidgets library for all QWidget based classes.\n\nQtGui support for top level surfaces through the QWindow class\n\nBuilt-in OpenGL support.\n\nQt Network\n\nDNS lookups support\n\nRemoval of QHttp and QFtp classes (which are available standalone for those that need them).\n\nMany smaller improvements.\n\nQt Widgets: Ported over to the new QPA architecture\n\nQt Quick\n\nQt Quick 1 module is available (same as the Qt Quick from Qt 4.x), but wonâ€™t be developed any further.\n\nAdded new Qt Quick and Qt Qml modules.\n\nSeparation of the graphical parts of Qt Quick from the QML and JS language into separate modules.\n\nJS classes (QJSEngine and QJSValue) are now using Googleâ€™s V8 engine for much better JavaScript performance\n\nPerformance improvement to the QML engine\n\nThe Qt Quick module contains the OpenGL based Scenegraph and all the basic items that are known from Qt Quick in Qt 4.x.\n\nAdded support for GL based shader effects, particles and many other things.\n\nQt 3D and Qt Location: Qt 3D (for 3d content), Qt Location (GPS access, maps, etcâ€¦) have been added to Qt Essentials.\n\nQt WebKit\n\nWebKit C++ APIs remain unchanged since Qt 4.x\n\nQt Webkit has been updated to a newer version from webkit.org providing many improvements and better HTML 5 compliance.\n\nWebkit wonâ€™t build on Windows for this alpha release, but will be enabled for the beta.\n\nFull details on Qt 5 Features are available on Qt Project Wiki.\n\nYou can watch the short demo below using Qt5 with Qt Quick 2.0 and demonstrating distance field OpenGL shaders to render smoothly low-resolution pixmaps with excellent performance both in a computer and a mobile phone (Nokia N950).\n\nIf you already have written applications running on Qt 4.x, the new Qt 5 API may break your code and you should follow the porting instructions to make sure your code will build and run properly.\n\nHowever, Qt developers insist that there is no rush to port apps to Qt 5 immediately, as Qt 4.8 is still there, although ultimately they believe that Qt 5 will offer enough benefits to consider moving.\n\nQt 5 alpha can be downloaded at http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt-5-Alpha. Qt 5 Alpha is a source code release and no binaries are provided, so youâ€™d have to to build it following the instructions found at http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt-5-Alpha-building-instructions.\n\nIf you find any bugs you can report them to Qt Labs bug tracking system and you can provide your feedback on the qt development list (development at qt-project.org). Patches and bug fixes can be submitted to codereview.qt-project.org."
