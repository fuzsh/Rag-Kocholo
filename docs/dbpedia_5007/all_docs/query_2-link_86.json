First I'm starting with GNOME environment.\n\nI found that I need to access APIs provided by nautilus, for example for icon overlay, I need to use the API - nautilus_file_info_add_emblem() which is part of nautilus-file-info\n\nLink - https://developer.gnome.org/libnautilus-extension/stable/libnautilus-extension-nautilus-file-info.html\n\nHow do I access the nautilus file managers' headers in my Qt/C++ project ?\n\nThank you."
