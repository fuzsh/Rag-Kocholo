        "text": "There is a comprehensive list of books over at Qt Developer Network.\n\nAnd the documentation for Qt is quite good, with several tutorials as a great place to start.\n\nThe link you are directing to above is referring to an old version of Qt, I would guess. The page at least seems to be dated back to 2004. Qt has gone a long way since then, especially when it comes to tools.\n\nUsing Qt Creator is probably the best way to start working with Qt applications, as it handles most of the setup needed to get started with a Qt project without having to resort too often to the command line (unless that is how you prefer to do it, of course.)\n\nFor Nokia phones you should check out the QML framework for any GUI you're making. Qt Creator has a simple designer for QML and you'll probably find some good help in the QML Getting Started tutorial.\n\nIt is easily connected to anything you make in C++, but gives you more ease and freedom in making user interfaces. But if you prefer to do everything in C++, all the things you can do in QML can be done using only C++ end as well."
