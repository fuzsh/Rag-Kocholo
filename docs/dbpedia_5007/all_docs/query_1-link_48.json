        "text": "Nokia announced the release of Qt SDK 1.1, which it said offers an integrated development environment for the creation of consumer applications for its Symbian OS handset platform and desktop apps for Windows 7, Mac OSX and Linux. It said that by using the Qt SDK, developers have a “complete, easy-to-use tool” which cuts app creation time for Nokia’s touch-screen devices in half. Within the release is Qt Quick, a new user interface creation kit which is said to benefit “both graphic designers and application developers,” enabling them to create “fluid, animated user interfaces with complete project and code editing support,” for developers to implement into an app.\n\nQt was Nokia’s chosen tool to enable developers to address both Symbian OS and MeeGo devices, when these two platforms were its chosen path to address mid-tier and high-end smartphones respectively. However, with these two abandoned in favour of Microsoft’s Windows Phone, this has made Qt something of an evolutionary dead-end for mobile app developers – no official Qt runtime for Windows Phone is planned.\n\nIn order to promote the Qt SDK 1.1, Nokia reiterated that it intends to sell 150 million future Symbian smartphones alongside the 100 million already in circulation.\n\nFeatures of Qt SDK 1.1 include map and navigation features, imaging features for camera and photo gallery access, notification API plug-ins and “other enhancements that enable developers to provide access to user content on the device.” QT Quick includes support for QML, a CSS and JavaScript-like language which is said to make UI development for touch screens “much easier to implement.”"
