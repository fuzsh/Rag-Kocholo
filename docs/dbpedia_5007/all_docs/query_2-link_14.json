        "text": "4.1. Installing QtCreatorï\n\nQt Creator is available on all major platforms and can be downloaded from https://www.qt.io/download (Go the open source route). The installation procedure depends on your platform.\n\nIf you are running a Unix-like platform, you can use the command line, eg on Debian:\n\nsudo apt install qtcreator qtcreator-doc\n\nAfter installing you should find it in your menu.\n\n4.2. Setting up your projectï\n\nWe assume you have already got a local QGIS clone containing the source code, and have installed all needed build dependencies etc. There are detailed instructions for git access and dependency requirements.\n\nOn our system we have checked out the code into $HOME/dev/cpp/QGIS and the rest of the article is written assuming that. You should update these paths as appropriate for your local system.\n\nAfter launching QtCreator do File âº Open File or Project\n\nThen use the resulting file selection dialog to browse to and open this file:\n\n$HOME/dev/cpp/QGIS/CMakeLists.txt\n\nQtCreator will parse the project and you will be prompted for a build location and options in the Configure Project dialog.\n\nSince we want QGIS to have debugging capabilities we will only enable the debug entry and fill it with our build location:\n\nCheck Select all kits enabling the Desktop entry\n\nUncheck all but the Debug sub item\n\nFill the path with the build directory. For our purpose, we create a specific build dir for QtCreator:\n\n$HOME/dev/cpp/QGIS/build-master-qtcreator\n\nItâs probably a good idea to create separate build directories for different branches if you can afford the disk space.\n\nThatâs the basics of it. Press the Configure Project button and QtCreator will start scanning the source tree for autocompletion support and do some other housekeeping stuff in the background.\n\nWe want to tweak a few things before we start to build.\n\n4.3. Setting up your build environmentï\n\nClick on the Projects icon on the left of the QtCreator window.\n\nSelect the Build settings tab (normally active by default).\n\nThe dialog shows the Debug build configuration and allows you to edit settings under the CMake section. While the default configuration should be enough for a first pass, depending on your needs, you may want to enable more features such as:\n\nWITH_3D = ON for 3D rendering\n\nWITH_CUSTOM_WIDGETS = ON to add QGIS custom widgets for interface design\n\nPress Apply Configuration Changes.\n\nYou are now ready to build. Press the Build button at the left bottom of the dialog (or Ctrl+B) to launch the project build! Qt Creator will begin compiling and this may take some time the first time, depending on your device.\n\nAt the end of the compilation, you can run QGIS by pressing the Run button.\n\nThe compilation of QGIS also generates binaries in the build directory. Hence you can execute QGIS from the command line using:\n\ncd$HOME/dev/cpp/QGIS/build-master-qtcreator ./output/bin/qgis\n\nSometimes you may want to install QGIS as an executable, outside the build directory.\n\nSet the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to somewhere you have write access to (we use $HOME/apps). This would avoid overwriting an existing QGIS installs (by your package manager for example).\n\nPress Apply Configuration Changes to update the settings\n\nPress the button\n\nWhen the build is complete, youâll find the qgis executable in the $HOME/apps/bin folder."
