        "text": "This page contains information on how to resolve common problems with Qt Creator projects. Consider searching this page using Ctrl+F (Command+F on Mac) to jump quickly to the text matching the error message or issue you are having. You may also want to check the Guide to Common Build/Run/Debug problems if for issues compiling or running your program.\n\nInstallation woes\n\nI installed Qt Creator previously. Must I reinstall or can I use my existing installation?\n\nYou should install the latest. Our projects are written to work with the latest version and the most recent fixes. Uninstall your existing Qt, and follow the steps in our Qt install instructions.\n\nWhen I open a new project, the \"Configure Project\" options are empty. Error: No kits available.\n\nA \"kit\" is a C++ compiler. If no kits are available, your Qt installation may be missing essential components. When installing Qt, you must select the appropriate component (e.g. MinGW or macOS) for your platform, as specified in our installation instructions. If you fail/forget to select this component, the observed symptom is \"no kits available\". To fix this, you'll need to reinstall Qt Creator. Delete your existing Qt folder and repeat the steps in our Qt install instructions.\n\nWhen I open a new project, the \"Configure Project\" options are all grayed out. Error: No suitable kits found.\n\nOn MacOS, be sure you have followed the steps in our Qt install guide to install the Xcode command-line tools.\n\nOpening a project\n\nI double-click a .cpp file to open it in Qt Creator and the \"Build\" and \"Run\" buttons are grayed out.\n\nDouble-clicking a .cpp file opens only that single file. You instead want to open the entire project by double-clicking the .pro file.\n\nI can't tell which file is the .pro file because Windows File Explorer is not displaying filename extensions.\n\nIf your File Explorer is set to hide extensions, the file Welcome.pro will display the name Welcome. You can configure for extensions to be displayed in File Explorer by choosing menu item File->Options, select the \"View\" tab and under âAdvanced settingsâ, uncheck \"Hide extensions for known file types\". Click \"Apply\" button.\n\nThe names of my files are grayed out and I cannot build. Error: Rename project directory to remove disallowed characters.\n\nThe name of your project directory contains a disallowed character. Qt Creator is confused by most punctuation and international characters. Look in the General Messages or Compiler Output tab for the longer message which reports which character is problematic. Rename your directory to remove that character.\n\n*** ERROR: The name of your project directory has disallowed characters. *** The allowed characters are letters, numbers, and simple punctuation. *** Your directory is named Assignment#1 which contains the *** disallowed characters: # *** Please rename to a simple name such as Assignment_1 that contains *** no disallowed characters.\n\nPermission problems\n\nAlerts on MacOS. Qt requesting \"access to Desktop or Downloads folder\". Should I allow it?\n\nYes. Recent releases of MacOS have have tightened restrictions for programs to access to certain folders.\n\nIf your project folder is stored in Desktop or Downloads folder, you must explicitly grant file privileges to the Qt Creator IDE and the debugger. Click agree when you get an alert such as this one: You can also go to \"System Preferences\" -> \"Security & Privacy\" -> \"Privacy\" tab -> \"Files and Folders\" to review and change what access has been granted to individual applications.\n\nA good way to avoid the nuisance requests is to simply not store your project folders in a directory that is restricted. Create a CS106B folder and store your projects there. Downloading a starter project will default to adding your Downloads folder, get into the habit of immediately moving each starter project out of Downloads and into your CS106B folder, where you can freely use it.\n\nWhat else?\n\nThe error with my Qt project is not listed in this FAQ. What else can I try?\n\nAbout 90% of random Qt Creator issues we've seen can be resolved by \"re-initializing\" your project. Follow the re-initialize steps.\n\nHelp! It still doesn't work!\n\nIf you had read through the list of known fixes and were not able to resolve your issue, we will try our best to help you figure it out. Come by Lair and show us the problem or make an Ed post to ask for help. In your post, be sure to include the following information:\n\nYour operating system and version number (Windows 10, Mac OS X 10.15, etc.)\n\nThe Qt version information from \"About Qt Creator\"\n\nWhich step in the process has failed (be specific)\n\nSpecific error message\n\nPlease include the exact text via copy/paste and/or a screenshot.\n\nFor a build error, also copy the detailed information from the Compile Output tab.\n\nThanks, and good luck! You can do it!"
