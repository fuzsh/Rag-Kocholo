        "text": "YOU'RE NOT ON NICKTOONS ANYMORE!\n\nSome TMNT stuff really isn't for little kids.\n\nParts of this article were transwikied from Wikipedia. Necessary changes will have to be done to fit in on TMNTPedia.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a 2014 American action-adventure film based on the Mirage Studios characters of the same name, produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Platinum Dunes, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is the fifth film of the live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films and is also a reboot that features the main characters, portrayed by a new cast and the first in the reboot series. The film was directed by Jonathan Liebesman, written by Josh Appelbaum, André Nemec and Evan Daugherty, lead produced by Michael Bayand co-produced by Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Galen Walker, Scott Mednick and Ian Bryce, and stars Megan Fox, Will Arnett, William Fichtner, Minae Noji, Whoopi Goldberg, Abby Elliott, Tohoru Masamune and more, and featuring the voices of Johnny Knoxville, Alan Ritchson, Noel Fisher, Jeremy Howard and Tony Shalhoub. The film was announced shortly before the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' co-creator Peter Laird sold the rights to the characters to Nickelodeon in October 2009.\n\nThe film was released on August 8, 2014.[1] The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but was a box office success, earning $493.3 million on a $150 million budget and it became the highest-grossing film in the series. The film won the Worst Supporting Actress award at the 35th Golden Raspberry Awards in 2015 for Fox's performance as April O'Neil and also received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. Conversely, it was also nominated at the 28th Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Movie, Favorite Movie Actor and Favorite Movie Actress. A sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, was released on June 3, 2016.[2][3]\n\nCast[]\n\nJohnny Knoxville - Leonardo (voice)\n\nPete Ploszek - Leonardo (motion capture)\n\nAlan Ritchson - Raphael\n\nNoel Fisher - Michelangelo\n\nJeremy Howard - Donatello\n\nMegan Fox - April O'Neil\n\nMalina Weissman - Young April\n\nTony Shalhoub - Splinter (voice)\n\nDanny Woodburn - Splinter (motion capture)\n\nWill Arnett - Vernon Fenwick[4]\n\nTohoru Masamune - Unmasked Shredder (credited as Shredder), The Shredder (Voice) (Uncredited)\n\nWilliam Fichtner - Eric Sacks[5][6], The Shredder (Voiceless Portrayal Only) (Uncredited)\n\nWhoopi Goldberg - Bernadette Thompson\n\nMinae Noji - Karai\n\nAbby Elliott - Taylor\n\nK. Todd Freeman - Baxter Stockman\n\nTaran Killam - McNaughton\n\nPaul Fitzgerald - Doctor O'Neil\n\nPlot[]\n\nSpoiler warning: Plot or ending details follow.\n\nApril O'Neil, a reporter for Channel 6 news in New York City, has been watching a mysterious organization called the Foot Clan terrorizing New York. She stumbles upon a robbery they are committing one night and notices a strange looking figure having foiled it. She tries reporting back to Channel 6 about her findings, but no one believes her.\n\nThe Foot Clan then terrorizes a subway next. She goes to the scene again in an attempt to find the vigilante and find evidence towards his existence. She sees four vigilantes this time, as they all fight off the clan and then disappear. She manages to spot them climbing atop the rooftop however, and tries to take a picture of them with her camera to prove to her co-workers they are real. They discover her and delete the camera images however, and tell her not to tell anyone of their existence or they will personally find her. She asks them who they are before they leave, and claim to be \"Ninja Mutant Turtle Teenagers\".\n\nShe returns to her apartment and finds a July 1999 footage in her camera of a laboratory she was a part of when she was a little girl. She notices that the turtles she took care of from the laboratory 15 years earlier seem similar to the mutant turtles she had seen on the rooftop. She also remembers that her father was testing a type of Mutagen in the laboratory. She continues doing more research and eventually pieces together that the Ninja Turtles were the same ones from the laboratory.\n\nShe tries again to explain to her boss at Channel 6 news about the existence of the Ninja Turtles and that they are fighting secretly against the Foot Clan, but her boss now is so infuriated that she fires April. April thus tries explaining to her co-worker, Vernon Fenwick, whom also has strong romantic feelings towards her, about her findings, but he also does not believe her. He does agree to take her to the old laboratory where she first owned the Turtles, however, and she finds her father's lab associate there, Eric Sacks.\n\nApril discusses the Ninja Turtles and how she believes they are fighting against the Foot Clan and shows an image to him of them. Sacks explains to her the history of their experiments with the mutagens, and that he and her now deceased father were planning on using them for healing properties. He realizes what must have happened and that the mutagen must have somehow affected the turtles when the laboratory was exploding and caused them to mutate into human like beings.\n\nMeanwhile in the sewers, the Ninja Turtles tell their master, Splinter the truth about April having spotted them. Splinter orders they find April and bring her to their lair, as she is now in great danger from the Foot Clan since she made contact with the Turtles.\n\nThe Turtles find April and put a sack on her head so she will be unaware of their lair's location. They take her to their master Splinter, who explains to her how she saved their lives from the laboratory by saving them from the fire and releasing them into the sewers. She tells them that she told her father's associate Eric Sacks about them, and was unaware that Sacks was actually allied with the Foot Clan's leader, the Shredder, whom Sacks then relayed the information to. Now that Shredder knew of their existence, he and his Foot Clan minions go into the sewer to capture them so they can use their mutagen to spread a deadly virus throughout New York. Splinter and the Turtles fight against them, but are ultimately defeated and their home destroyed. Shredder kidnaps three of the Turtles, Leonardo, Donatello and Michelangelo and leaves Splinter greatly injured. Raphael is not captured because the Foot Clan believed he was already killed in the battle.\n\nApril managed to hide from the Foot Clan during the fight, and attempts to tend to Splinter's wounds. Raphael is then found and discovered to be alive. Splinter instructs Raphael and April to save the other three Turtles before Shredder can extract the mutagen from them that he plans to use to poison New York. April calls Vern to give them a ride to the laboratory where the other three Turtles are being held hostage.\n\nWhen the trio arrives, April frees the other three Turtles while Raphael fights the Shredder. After they are freed, they join Raphael in fighting them. Shredder escapes after defeating them again however, and April leaves with the Turtles and Vernon to return to the Turtles' lair for a new plan. During the escape, they are pursued by Shredder's Foot Clan in trucks but eventually manage to defeat them.\n\nAt their lair in the sewers, the Turtles plan they will attempt to hold off against the Shredder on the rooftop of Sacks' building before he is able to finish extracting the mutagen he had acquired from them when he kidnapped them, while April and Vern attempt to gather the mutagen from inside the building. April eventually manages to acquire it and heads onto the rooftop to give it to the Turtles. While the Turtles hang from the rooftop, they manage to give April the momentum she needs to kick him off the building, finally defeating him as he falls onto the ground greatly injured and taken into authorities.\n\nThe film ends with Vernon attempting again to catch April's heart with a new car he had just bought, but the Turtles arrive in a new car they had just built and accidentally destroy it when Michelangelo presses the missile button. Vern begins getting very upset, As police respond to the explosion, the Turtles offer her a ride in the new car, which she kindly rejects. The Turtles leave, but not before Mikey tries to serenade April with \"Happy Together\" by the band The Turtles, much to his brothers' annoyance and April's joy.\n\nProduction[]\n\nAccording to Deadline, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon have brought Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes partners Brad Fuller and Andrew Form on to produce Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the live-action film that reboots the film series launched by New Line in 1990. Bay, Fuller and Form will produce with Galen Walker and Scott Mednick.[7] The studio originally hired Matt Holloway and Art Marcum to write the film for close to $1 million but they left the project.[8] The Studio hired Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol writers Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec to write the script for the film.[9] According to Variety, Jonathan Liebesman is in talks to direct the film.[10] Deadline reports that Paramount has a Christmas 2013 release date set for the film.[11]\n\nMichael Bay revealed at the 2012 Nickeloden Upfront on March 14, 2012 that the film will be titled \"Ninja Turtles\" [12] and that the Turtles will no longer be mutants, but instead be members of an alien race.[13] However, considering that Bay is not part of the creative process of the film, this remains to be seen. News of Bay's creative change was met with negative criticism from within the fan community.[14] In response to the announcement, actor Robbie Rist who voiced Michelangelo the first three films, wrote to Bay accusing him of \"sodomizing\" the franchise. Rist later remarked that he could have been out of line since Bay makes more money than he does.[15] In response to the feedback, Bay issued a statement asking fans to calm down since a script had not been revealed, his team was working closely with the creators, and would include all the elements that made them fans to begin with.[16] Both Brian Tochi, who voiced Leonardo in the first three films, and Judith Hoag, who played April O'Neal in first film, have voiced their support towards the creative change.[17] Co-creator and former rights holder Peter Laird expressed his thoughts on the change asking fans to take Bay's advice and wait until more of Bay's plan is made available. Laird also stated that he felt the \"ill-conceived plan\" was a \"genius notion\", as it would allow fans to have the multitude of bipedal anamorphic turtles that they have been asking for. He would point out that while the concept of a turtle planet back story made for a great run of the mill science fiction story, but it had no real place in the Ninja Turtles universe.[18] Co-creator Kevin Eastman stated that he had been invited behind the scenes of the film, and concluded that he was official on board with the project and that, although he couldn't say much, he believes it to be \"awesome\".[19] Via Twitter, Corey Feldman, who voiced Donatello in the first and third films, voiced his support for the film saying that he loves Bay's remakes and he is eager to reprise his role.[20] In response to the backlash, Liebesman stated that he was glad to hear about the fan's response, since he and Eastman had been locked in a room working on ideas that, from his own perspective as a fan, everybody will love. If anything storywise were to be expanded upon, it would fit in perfectly with mythos.[21] While he wouldn't confirm whether or not Bay's comment did represent the film's premise, he did stress on the ooze itself and its background in the original comic, reminding that the ooze was the product of alien technology. In regards to how the Turtles would be rendered, Liebesman would not say exactly what visual direction would be taken, but he did state that he did enjoy Weta Digital's work in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. He also pointed out that the film would not be exclusively about action but will also focus on brotherhood, friendship, and responsibility.[22]\n\nIn late March Michael Bay posted on his website explaining the title change and stressing that nothing had changed regarding the Turtles. He stated the reason the title was shorten was at a request by Paramount to make the title \"simple\". He continued that the Turtle were the same as fans remember and regardless of the title change they still act like teenagers. He urged everyone to give everybody who was involved a chance, as they had the fans interest at top priority and would not let anybody down.[23]\n\nEastman told Geekscape that the oozes are from an alien origin.[24]\n\nAn April Fools' Day joke from Screen Rant that Taylor Lautner is cast as Leonardo in the film http://peterlairdstmntblog.blogspot.com/2012/08/blast-from-past-579-may-28-2002-re.html#comment-form[25] Hip-Hop artist Kid Cudi was rumored for a role in the film.[26][27][28] Fans of Community's Donald Glover wants the actor to play Donatello [29]\n\nOn June 12, Eastman went on a live chat with The One Ring.net reveals some of the things for the film will includes, April will not be a sixteen year old like in the 2012 series, he thinks Ken Watanabe would make a great Shredder, he'd like to bring Ernie Reyes, Jr. back as a Foot lieutenant, and martial arts wise they are looking at Fist of Legend and The Raid: Redemption.[30]\n\nThree days later, it was reported that production for this project has been shut down. While the release date has been pushed back five months, the work stoppage for the film was said to be \"indefinite\".[31] However, other sources say that the film will be released on May 16, 2014 due to problems in that script that need to be corrected.[32][33]\n\nLatino-Review looked at an early draft of the script for the film and revealed that Krang, The Technodrome, BEBOP and ROCKSTEADY & Dimension X were going to appear in the film.[34][35][36]\n\nEastman talk with MTV about film saying that Easily The Best Turtle Movie Yet.[37]\n\nActress Jessica Biel told Collider that she would like to play April O’Neil in the film.[38]\n\nKevin Eastman mentioned to Comic Book Resources that the movie is creating its own story but has to be true to the source material or else they will get \"f***ing murdered\".[39]\n\nAn early version of the script was leaked online, dated 1/30/12, titled \"The Blue Door\", and written by Appelbaum & Nemec, it features major changes to the origins, such as, the turtles are from an alien planet in Dimension X that consists of turtle warriors, Splinter is an alien from the same planet as well, Shredder is now \"Colonel Schrader\", a government agent who is secretly an alien who can grow blades from his body, \"The Foot Clan\" is now just \"The Foot\", a secret government agency led by Col. Schrader, Casey is an 18 year old security guard/amateur hockey player that finds the Turtles and is the focus of the movie, April is also 18 and is having relationship troubles with Casey because she's moving to New York City due to an internship at CBS, Raphael is now the comic relief instead of Mikey, Mikey falls in love with a turtle woman from his home planet.[5][6][7] A cease and desist order was sent by Paramount Pictures to a website that was hosting the script.[8] Peter Laird read the script and commented on his blog that \"all true TMNT fans should be grateful to the new \"powers that be\" that they did not allow this wretched thing to go any further\"[9]\n\nPeter Laird suggested that it might be CGI Turtles with live-action actors there was the idea of having Chris Evans and Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise their roles as Casey Jones and April O'Neil, but this was before Nickelodeon bought the rights to TMNT.\n\nOn February 21, 2013, Michael Bay revealed that Megan Fox will be in the cast, playing April O' Neal.[40] On March 21, actor Alan Ritchson is cast as Raphael. That same month, Pete Ploszek, Jeremy Howard and Noel Fisher are cast as Leonardo, Donatello and Michelangelo.[41][42] On April 2, 2013, Will Arnett is cast in a role that was being kept secret,[43] but it was later revealed that he would be playing Vernon Fenwick.[44]\n\nThe release date was pushed back again for a June 6, 2014 release date and reports surfaced that Evan Daugherty was brought on board to re-write the script.[45] On April 15, actor Danny Woodburn has been cast as Master Splinter.[46] On April 20, 2013, the film was renamed as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[47] On April 29, 2013, Michael Bay retracted comments that the turtles will be aliens.[48]\n\nOn May 9, 2013, William Fichtner is cast in the film as a lead with iconic stature in the Turtles’ mythology and it was revealed that he's playing The Shredder.[49][50]\n\nOn August 15, 2013, Paramount postponed the release date to August 8, 2014 to avoid competition from other family-friendly films released in June 2014 as well as one of Paramount's other releases, Transformers 4.[51]\n\nFilming wrapped on August 3, 2013.[52]\n\nIn October 2013, William Fichtner confirmed that Bebop and Rocksteady would not be in the film.[53]\n\nIn November 2013, a source very close to the production revealed that Casey Jones would not be appearing in the film either.[54]\n\nAdditional filming occurred in January and April 2014.[55][56][57]\n\nIn February 2014, producer Walker posted on his Facebook page that the trailer of the film will be shown with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. [58] The trailer was released on March 27, 2014.[59] That same day, it was revealed that Abby Elliott would be playing April O'Neil's roommate.[60] Elliot later revealed that her character is a revamped version of Irma, but her name is Taylor.[61] On April 3, 2014, Johnny Knoxville and Tony Shalhoub joined the film as the voices Leonardo and Splinter respectively.[62]\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nSongs[]\n\n\"Dat Boom\"\n\nWritten by Brian Tyler\n\nPerformed by Madsonik\n\nCourtesy of Madsonik Music\n\n\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Theme (Original Animated Series)\"\n\nWritten by Chuck Lorre and Dennis C.

The people being casted were ordinary people on the street.\n\nThe filmmakers chose Weta Digital to do the VFX based on their work on Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nThe filmmakers cite the martial arts films Fist of Legend and The Raid: Redemption as an influence on the action.\n\nThe release date of the film was changed to 2014, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original comic book series, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles saga.\n\nOne of Michael Bay's earlier films, Armageddon, featured a brief appearance by Judith Hoag, who played April O'Neil in \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\".\n\nBrett Ratner had been in talks to direct prior to Jonathan Liebesman being hired.\n\nJane Levy, Anna Kendrick, and Elizabeth Olsen tested for the part of April O'Neil.\n\nApril is seen to wear a yellow jacket. This pays homage to her appearance in \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", where she prominently had on a yellow jumpsuit.\n\nErnie Reyes Jr., who starred in \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze\" (and acted as a stunt double for Donatello in 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), pitched a stunt video to Michael Bay so that he could be martial arts consultant on this film.\n\nFor the first time in the franchise the Turtles' shells are bulletproof.\n\nMichelangelo hits on April, much like the first two live-action films.\n\nThe Turtles and Splinter were created inside a laboratory, much like in the IDW comics. Furthermore, the concept of the mutagen having almost limitless curative effects seems to be from those comics as well.\n\nThis time the Foot Soldiers use guns as their primary weapons, much like the Foot Soldiers from the 1987 TV series and their laser blasters.\n\nThe Turtle Assault Van's horn is the beginning of the 1987 series theme song.\n\nWhen Splinter is telling April about how he raised the turtles there's a scene in his flashback where Leonardo appears slicing pizza in the air for his family and one of the pieces hits Splinter in the head is a reference to the 1990 film, where the same thing happens.\n\nEric Sacks says they considered using rabbits instead of Turtles for the Mutagen experiences, it can be interpreted as a reference to either Usagi Yojimbo or The Tortoise and the Hare tale.\n\nThe movie begins with a black and white comic book style montage as a reference to the original Mirage comics, but it gets a few colors making it look similar to the 2012 TV series' flashbacks.\n\nSplinter and the Turtles were laboratory experiments, much like in the IDW comics origin story.\n\nThe younger version of April says the mutagen came from outer space as a hint to the Utroms.\n\nApril was the one who introduced pizza to the Turtles.\n\nThe scene where Raphael is walking disguised on the streets with April was cut off the final version, but it was a reference to the way the Turtles used to disguise themselves in the Mirage comics, 1987 series, Archie's comics, 1990 film and 2003 TV series.\n\nMichelangelo mentions a \"Hip Hop Christmas Album\" as a reference to the We Wish You a Turtle Christmas special.\n\nAt the end of the movie Michelangelo sings \"Happy Together\" to April, a song by a band called \"The Turtles\".\n\nVern refers to the Turtles as \"heroes in a half shell\", which's a reference to the 1987 TV series theme song.\n\nThe \"Cat Playing Keyboard with Chopsticks\" video was based on a real internet hit video known as The Keyboard Cat.\n\nThis film marks the first appearances of Vern Fenwick, Karai, and Baxter Stockman in a live action theatrical film.\n\nDuring one of April's video tape reviews one of the turtles' tanks is labeled \"Michaelangelo\" a nod to the Turtle's name original spelling in the Mirage Comics.\n\nDonatello's glasses have tortoise shell frames.\n\nWhen April calls Vern, the song playing in Vern's apartment is \"Careless Whisper\" by Wham!.\n\nIn the film, Donatello stated that a pizza with 99 different types of cheese would be impossible. Johnny di Francesco, an Australian pizza maker and owner of the 400 Gradi pizzeria, took the challenge and created a 99 cheese pizza after the film.\n\nThe Japanese spoken by the Shredder during his sparring scene with the Foot is 「はじめ！」, \"Hajime!\", 「かったるい 。」, \"Kattarui.\", 「 負けて当然だ。」, \"Makete tōzen da.\",「お前はその訓練してはずだ。」, \"Omae wa sono kuren shite hazu da.\"\n\nThe Japanese spoken by the Shredder to Sacks is「なぜここにいるですよ？」, \"Naze koko ni iru desu yo?\",「フットだのパワー無限大になりお前は大金を手にする。」, \"Futto da no pawā mugendai ni nari omae wa taikin o te ni suru.\", 「探せ。」, \"Sagase.\",「晩飯はタートルスープでな。」, \"Banmeshi wa tātoru sūpu de na.\"\n\nErrors[]\n\nWhen the Turtles are sneaking into the lair they say they've been to the surface twice, but when April is trying to convince Thompson about their existence she is showing several pictures of crime scenes, where the Foot got their plans frustrated, with the Turtles tag \"family\", it proves the turtles have been to the surface a few more times than they said they did.\n\nIn the scene where Foot Soldiers began shooting at Vern, April, and Raph, the Foot Solders shot a bunch of times on the front window, but when the car crashed the second door, the glass was normal.\n\nWhen the van crashed through the second door, it wasn't damaged from the first impact.\n\nThe time-stamp on the footage of the un-mutated turtles in the lab says 1999, which matches the chronology of the film. When we are shown the young April taking this footage in a flashback, she is taking the footage on a Bluetooth-enabled digital camcorder, which would not have been available then. The camcorder is also a MicroMV camcorder. MicroMV was not invented until 2001. A MiniDV, Digital8, or even an analog camcorder would have been more period-accurate.\n\nWhen April uses her phone to make a Skype video call to the dock worker (indicated by the Skype logo on the screen) the worker asks April how she got his number. Skype video chat uses screen-names, not phone numbers.\n\nLeonardo's NYC button and the strap it is attached to continuously switches back and forth from left to right throughout the film, sometimes as quickly as a camera angle change.\n\nIn the final showdown with Shredder, Leonardo throws one of his katana at Shredder, which falls to the ground with Shredder. However, throughout the rest of the scene Leo still has two katana on his back.\n\nNear the beginning when April interviews the fitness trainer and is jumping on the trampoline she is wearing a pink shirt and a black coat. When she walks back to the news van she is wearing a gray shirt with a burgundy coat.\n\nDuring the stasis scene three of the turtles are in stasis chambers having their blood removed for the mutagen but there are four tubes filling with blood flowing to the container.\n\nWhen April arrives at the shipping yard at night and finds the Foot are there, it begins to rain, then stops, then rains again, then stops again, then rains again heavy, then stops again.\n\nDuring the elevator scene when the Turtles begin to beat box together, the control panel is lit up for floor 36, then jumps straight to floor 54.\n\nDuring the snow scene Michelangelo's rocket skateboard randomly appears and disappears. In fact, he didn't even appear to have it when the Turtles were taken from the sewer, but had it when on the mountain.\n\nAt the end of the movie when Michelangelo accidentally blows up Vern's new car he fires the missile at the rear of the car. The car flips end over end forward, but when it lands the rear end of the car is still facing them. Note the tail lights and open trunk.\n\nAt the start of the snow hill scene, when the semi-truck spins its wheels after being hit by a rocket, the truck only has one drive axle. In every other shot the truck has two drive axles.\n\nAfter April is contacted by the Turtles and meets them on the rooftop she is wearing a black shirt. When she is taken down to the sewers by the turtles she is wearing a gray shirt.\n\nWhen April is calling Vern to ask for a ride to Sack's mansion, Vern sees April's phone number show on the caller ID before answering. But April is calling from a payphone.\n\nSacks refers to the Turtles as box turtles. Box turtles are a terrestrial species of turtle. The turtles shown in the film are red-eared sliders, which are a semi-aquatic species.\n\nAt one point, NYPD officers wearing vests saying \"SWAT\" are shown. The NYPD refers to its tactical team as the Emergency Services Unit. The vests should have read ESU.\n\nThe credits list \"Music Preperation\" [sic]. The correct spelling is \"preparation.\"\n\nIf the mutagen in the turtles' blood was so precious that the Foot needed to take three turtles, why not take Splinter too? After all, his blood has mutagen in it too, and taking three turtles rather than one suggests every ounce of mutagen is valuable.\n\nWhen April is on the docks after the initial attack the Turtles make and thwart the Foot Soldiers - April takes a photo of the \"family\" insignia on the container with her phone and for a brief moment during the camera angle change you can see that the forward-facing camera is in fact on, thus making it a \"selfie\".\n\nWhen Shredder assaults the Turtles hideout where Raphael is leaning over Splinter, the scar on Raphael's lip changes from left to right, as does the hole in his sunglasses changes from right to left lens, indicating that this shot was reversed.\n\nIn one of the scenes with the turtles in the stasis tanks Leonardo is shown in a reverse shot where his shoulder strap is over his left shoulder instead of his right shoulder. Interestingly, though, the animators did digitally reverse the NYC button on the strap so that it was not reversed.\n\nA cameraman's head is briefly visible (at around 51 mins).\n\nAt the end of the movie during the beginning of the fight scene atop the Sacks tower you can clearly see that One World Trade Center is just a few blocks away but then during the remaining of the fight we see that the Sacks Tower is back in midtown and One World Trade can be seen way in the distance.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie April is doing a story about how to stay fit as it is the first day of Spring yet at the end of the movie the Sachs antenna with the toxin inside falls and destroys the Times Square New Year's Eve ball and 2014 sign. It can't be the first day of Spring yet if the New Year's Eve ball is still on display.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)/Gallery\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)/Animations\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)/Videos\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)/Quotes\n\nTranscript[]\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)/Transcript\n\n[]\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) on IMDB\n\nTMNTMovie on nick.com\n\nReferences[]"
