        "text": "WRITERâ€™S NOTE: This edition of â€˜What You Should Knowâ€™ is coming rather late, due to personal reasons. Nonetheless, I am putting this out for readers who have yet to see the movie. Some elements of this article have been edited and updated to reflect current numbers and statistics.\n\nâ€˜What You Should Knowâ€™ is a Rotoscopers series that gives you a detailed and (somewhat) objective rundown of this yearâ€™s animated films, right before or on the day they hit theaters. That way, you can make a decision on whether or not to see the movie based on the information provided.\n\nMOVIE: Ratchet & Clank\n\nDIRECTED BY: Kevin Munroe (co-directed by Jericca Cleland)\n\nWRITTEN BY: Kevin Munroe, T.J. Fixman, and Gerry Swallow\n\nSTARRING: James Arnold Taylor (Ratchet), David Kaye (Clank), Jim Ward (Captain Qwark), Paul Giamatti (Chairman Drek), John Goodman (Grimroth Razz), Bella Thorne (Cora), Rosario Dawson (Elaris), Sylvester Stallone (Victor Von Ion), with Armin Shimerman (Doctor Nefarious), and Vincent Tong as Brax.\n\nMUSIC BY: Evan Wise\n\nSTUDIO: Gramercy Pictures/Focus Features\n\nPRODUCTION COMPANIES: Blockade Entertainment, Playstation Originals/Sony Interactive, and Rainmaker Entertainment.\n\nPRODUCTION BUDGET: $20 million\n\nBASED ON: A video game franchise developed by Insomniac Games.\n\nWHATâ€™S IT ABOUT?:\n\nRatchet & Clank is a retelling of the first gameâ€™s story, serving as an origin tale about how Ratchet and Clank first met. The filmâ€™s story utilizes elements from other R&C games, such as the inclusion of Doctor Nefarious and the Galactic Rangers.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY:\n\nRatchet and Clank came together with help from Blockade Entertainment, a new company specifically for developing film projects based on video game properties. Once an animation studio (Rainmaker) and distributor (Gramercy/Focus) were secured, production was underway.\n\nThe film was originally set for a 2015 release, but the need for extended production time moved it up to 2016.\n\nIMPORTANT STUFF TO KNOW:\n\nSeries developer Insomniac Games was involved in every part of the filmâ€™s production process. How deeply were they involved? Beyond having three of the original voice casters and series writer T.J Fixman on the screenplay, key personal from Insomniac were also in the room during recording sessions, as to make sure that the gameâ€™s colorful dialogue was translated naturally to the film.\n\nThey were so deeply involved in the movie that they even allowed the filmâ€™s animators access to assets from the original games to be used in the film.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe film has (or had) the added benefit of being promoted via a new video game that came out on April 12. That in itself is a surefire way of getting the hardcore fans locked in for the movie. It also might be a potential draw for younger audiences (duh), particularly with young boys with parents looking for a kid-friendly, post-Guardians of the Galaxy compliment to the big summer blockbusters.\n\nCONS:\n\nWarner Brosâ€™ Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Disneyâ€™s The Jungle Book have both succeeded in giving the summer blockbuster season an early start. Now, itâ€™s up to Ratchet & Clank to ride that wave into the official start of the season, which will be hard to do given that Captain America: Civil War is around the corner (as youâ€™ll see later, it was).\n\nPlus, the film will have the challenge of trying to convince the general audienceâ€”not all of whom are that big into video gamesâ€”of seeing this film (as youâ€™ll see later, it kinda failed on that front).\n\nBOX-OFFICE PROSPECTS:\n\nUnfortunately, early tracking wasnâ€™t that great for the film. Early projections showed that, at best, the film would be able to gross somewhere between $8-$10 million at the box office. Thatâ€™s far below other newcomers like Keanu and Motherâ€™s Day.\n\nBut as of recent, the film hasnâ€™t even made it to those numbers. On Sunday alone, the film only grossed about $4 million total, putting it in 7th place and sadly cementing the filmâ€™s status as a box office disappointment.\n\nWHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING:\n\nWhile Ratchet & Clank may be the first decent-to-good video game movie in a long time, critics werenâ€™t as kind. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film sits at a 19% Rotten rating. Audiences were more kind, with a 58% approval rating (which is still Rotten).\n\nIt would seem that, even in animation, video game movies are a tough puzzle to crack.\n\nFINAL OBSERVATION:\n\nWhile Ratchet & Clank wonâ€™t give audiences anything new (visually or narratively), it does give us something we havenâ€™t seen in a while: a video game movie adaptation thatâ€™s actually watchable.\n\nIf this article has you interested in seeing Ratchet & Clank, buy your tickets here on Fandango\n\nThank you for reading this installment of What You Should Know!\n\nWhat do you think? If you havenâ€™t seen Ratchet & Clank, are you interested now? A question for the gamers: should we see this or wait â€™till The Angry Birds Movie and/or Warcraft? ðŸ˜‰\n\nEdited by: Kelly Conley"
