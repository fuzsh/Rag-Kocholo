        "text": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem made franchise history with the unveiling of its Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\nThe Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg-produced passion project thrust the Turtles back into the spotlight after more than seven years away from theaters, doing so in dazzling fashion.\n\nThe animated epic has earned rave reviews, getting compliments for its \"dazzling\" visuals and \"radical goofiness\" that made so many people fall in love with the franchise years ago.\n\nAnd with such glowing praise, Paramount has been quick to jump on the positive momentum, greenlighting a sequel to the Jeff Rowe-directed blockbuster, as well as two seasons of an animated TV series set in the Mutant Mayhem world.\n\nMutant Mayhem Makes TMNT Movie History\n\nThe latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) film, Mutant Mayhem, has smashed a franchise record on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nMutant Mayhem now holds the crown for the best-reviewed theatrically released Turtles movie on the platform, currently sitting at a 95% Tomatometer score.\n\nIt was not a hard bar for Mutant Mayhem to jump over, beating out 1990's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which holds a dismal 42% score.\n\nThus far, the Ninja Turtles franchise hasn't had the best of luck on the big screen, with the previous six movies averaging just 31.6%. Including Mutant Mayhem's stellar score into that average brings the number up a whole four points to 40.7%.\n\nThe full list of theatrically released TMNT films and their Rotten Tomatoes scores can be seen below:\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem - 95%\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) - 42%\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016) - 37%\n\nTMNT (2007) - 36%\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Secret of the Ooze (1991)- 35%\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) - 21%\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) - 19%\n\nIt is worth noting that these numbers do not account for two straight-to-video/streaming Ninja Turtles movies in Batman Vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the Netflix-released Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie.\n\nWhat Does Mutant Mayhem's Success Mean?\n\nWhile it remains to be seen just how long the box office legs for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem will be, all this critical success can only mean one thing... this iteration of the Turtles is not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nMutant Mayhem feels like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in a lot of ways (only one of them being their innovative art styles. What Into the Spider-Verse hit theaters back in December 2018, it did not light the world on fire - at least from a financial standpoint.\n\nHowever, it did earn rave reviews (currently sitting at 97% on Rotten Tomatoes) and built a bit of a cult following as time went on. The further out from Spider-Verse's debut the more evangelists it seemed to procure.\n\nThen, when the sequel, Across the Spider-Verse, was ready, the film was released and was both a critical darling and a smash box office hit.\n\nWith a sequel to Mutant Mayhem already greenlit, Paramount's Heroes in a Half-Shell could very well follow in Spider-Verse's steps, with that next film being the true coming-out party amongst the mainstream after fans of the first film had spent the last few years singing its praises from the roof."
