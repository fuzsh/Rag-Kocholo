        "text": "Cowabunga! We’re ranking the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies, starting with the original! The story of Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo, and their sensei Splinter was a hit back in 1990, as audiences were drawn to the movie’s relatively gritty and realistic ninjitsu-practicing half-shelled heroes, in line with the Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird comic book. One year after, at the height of Turtle mania, came sequel Secret of the Ooze, which replaced April O’Neil with a new actress, brought back Shredder, and went to great lengths to tone down the weapon-based violence. One more sequel in 1993 sent the Turtles back in time, a box office under-performer that closed the book on the original movie trilogy.\n\nBut the franchise stuck around, through video games, comics, action figures, and numerous television series. Seems like there’s always a market for brash, active reptiles for young people to latch onto. This has led to film revivals throughout the years, including an animated film in 2007, and a Michael Bay-produced reboot in 2014.\n\nThe 2D animated movies have seen way more success with critics, like the Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and their crossover with Batman.\n\nIn 2023, Seth Rogen creatively steered the series into its first Certified Fresh film: Mutant Mayhem, emphasizing the teenage in TMNT with a Spider-Verse-inspired art style and brash, loud energy.\n\nNow, we’re ranking all the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies by Tomatometer, with Certified Fresh films first! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 109213%\n\nCritics Consensus: With its unique visual style and a story that captures the essence of the franchise's appeal, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is an animated treat for the whole family.\n\nSynopsis: After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtle brothers set out to win the hearts of New...

Good for the young at heart, irritating for everyone else.\n\nSynopsis: In New York, mysterious radioactive ooze has mutated four sewer turtles into talking, upright-walking, crime-fighting ninjas. The intrepid heroes --... [More]\n\nDirected By: Steve Barron\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 45854%\n\nCritics Consensus: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is a slight improvement over its predecessor, but still lacks the wit or anarchic energy of the comics that birthed the franchise.\n\nSynopsis: The turtles face a new challenge when Shredder escapes from custody and joins forces with Baxter Stockman, a mad scientist... [More]\n\nDirected By: Dave Green\n\n#6\n\nTMNT (2007) 36%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 40384%\n\nCritics Consensus: TMNT's art direction is splendid, but the plot is non-existent and the dialogue lacks the irony and goofy wit of the earlier Ninja Turtles movies.\n\nSynopsis: Splinter, the rat sensei, senses something amiss in New York City. His disciples, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelangelo have grown... [More]\n\nDirected By: Kevin Munroe\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 39180%\n\nCritics Consensus: Not only is the movie's juvenile dialogue unbearable for adults, but the turtles' dopey and casual attitude towards physical violence makes them poor kids' role models.\n\nSynopsis: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mark Caso, Michelan Sisti, Leif Tilden, Kenn Troum) again battle their archenemy, the rogue ninja...
