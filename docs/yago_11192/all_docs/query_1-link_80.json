        "text": "Booyakasha, dudes! Uncanny Fox here, continuing my review of all of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies with the 2007 animated gem, TMNT. We’ve finally reached my personal favorite of the Ninja Turtles films, one that gets the tone and characterizations of the Heroes in a Half-Shell just right. And ironically enough, the first one of these that I’ve watched, even though it’s technically the fourth in the series.\n\nAfter the critical panning of Turtles In Time, New Line Cinema decided to switch gears from live-action film-making to the then-revolutionary medium of CGI animation, with acclaimed director John Woo (Face-Off) to headline such a movie for a 2000 release. However, nothing came of that particular project, and Woo moved on with his life. Enter writer/director Kevin Munroe (he would go on to direct Dylan Dog: Dead of Night and the Ratchet & Clank movie), who took over heading the film in 2004, as rights to the Ninja Turtles movie franchise shifted from New Line and Golden Harvest to Warner Bros, The Weinstein Company (yes, the one that was owned by that Weinstein. Yes, what he did was beyond wrong. No, I’m not going to hold that against the movie, it’s not like he actually made it himself) and Imagi Animation Studios.\n\nMonroe sought to downplay the more comedic tone the movies and the franchise in general had taken at that time (“less Cowabunga” was the words he used to describe his intentions), instead seeking a balance between the humor of the 80’s cartoon and the darker story-lines of the original comics not unlike the 1990 film. Speaking of, it’s not entirely certain if this movie is in continuity with the previous ones; Monroe says it is, Peter Laird says it isn’t, and the Turtles Forever TV special (which was a crossover between the ’87 and ’03 Turtles, and featured a look into the various other adaptations and alternate universes in the franchise) seemed to agree with the latter. Regardless, all parties concur that the events of the previous films did happen before this one, so I’m going to count it as such.\n\nWith all that in mind, let’s dive into TMNT, an animated film that in my mind needs more love. It’s better than the one that came before it and the one that came after, at the very least.\n\nThe movie begins with the Turtles running across the rooftops at night while Lawrence Fishburne (you’ll know him from my Dawn Of Justice review, here and here) narrates their backstory. Something weird here is how he explains how they got their names: “Named after the great Renaissance masters.” It makes it sound like DaVinci and company were famous martial artists instead of painters and the like. That would be an awesome graphic novel… Also, the fact that they gave Lawrence Fishburne semi-top billing for this movie, but he’s only in this one little scene at the beginning. I don’t mind though, it’s Lawrence Fishburne.\n\nMorpheus explains that the Turtles defeated the Shredder, but now a greater threat is on the horizon. One born 3000 years ago (which apparently looks just like the film 300), as an ancient king named Yoatl led a group of generals on a crusade to conquer the world. We see an epic battle between the group and a massive army as Morpheus narrates that nothing could stand in Yoatl’s way. One cool thing about the switch to animation in this movie is how the creators where able to get literally hundreds of characters on screen at once, as opposed to the small groups of enemies that could be mustered in the earlier films. It really ups the scope and brings the feeling that this is a literal army at work here.\n\nEventually, Yoatl learned of the Stars of Kikan, a legendary constellation that aligned every 3000 years, opening a portal to another world of unspeakable power. Yoatl used this power to become immortal, but there was a catch (as there usually is, you don’t get to live forever for free in the world of fantasy): in doing so, his generals were turned to stone, and 13 monsters were unleashed on Earth who proceeded to wreck ancient civilization. Hence, Yoatl was cursed to wonder the earth, forced to remember his terrible deeds for all eternity. And those 13 monsters? They’re still around…\n\nWe then cut to a village in Central America, where a local warlord is shaking down the people for ransom. He gloats about how he “protects” the villagers, pigging out on an apple and stealing a necklace from a woman. He and his cronies then drive off, hooting about “monsters in the jungle” as the lady’s son runs over to her to see if she’s okay. At this point, I’m ready for Black Panther to jump in and start busting heads.\n\nThe goons drive through the jungle, eventually swerving to a stop at a log someone placed on the middle of the road. One of the cronies moves to pull it out of the way with their wench, only to get snatched from the other side. Another gets pulled up from a tree, causing the others to start freaking out about “The Ghost of the Jungle,” a local myth that punishes evil-doers who prey on the villagers. Like them…\n\nSoon, a body drops and the last flunkie remembers that he left the stove on. Now, it’s just the boss, who demands that whoever’s picking off his guys reveal himself, bragging all the while about how he’s the biggest dog in the yard or whatnot. He gets spooked by a pair of inhuman eyes and takes off running, eventually tripping and rolling downhill.\n\nA nasty surprise waits for him down at the bottom: the Ghost of the Jungle, who looks exactly like a certain sword-wielding Turtle. The Ghost readies his katana, the warlord charges at him, and the camera cuts to the trees above as the baddie’s dying scream echoes through the jungle. Looks like someone’s added another head to his collection.\n\nNot to mention that this PG-rated cartoon movie just hinted that its main protagonist killed a man. Although, the Ninja Turtles never really had a hard-and-fast rule against killing like Batman. It’s more of a “only do it in self defense, against an enemy that’s truly a threat to you or the people you care about.” It’s not that different from how the Jedi approach that sort of thing, which makes since once you realize that the Jedi teachings were partially based on Japanese Bushido, which is what the Turtles follow. But I’m getting off track here…\n\nBack at the village, the warlord’s jeep pulls in carrying all the stuff he took from the locals, including the mother’s necklace. The boy from before looks up to the trees to see a hooded figure looking on. The Ghost of the Jungle.\n\nThe scene fades to a few days later, as the boy is pointing what he saw out to April, who’s out looking for the Ghost. She’s voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar, aka Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Daphne from the live-action Scooby-Doo movies, the Seventh Sister from Star Wars: Rebels, and the girl late 90’s era teenage boys everywhere had hung up on their ceilings. Don’t lie, you know who you are. When the boy asks if she knows him, she replies that he wasn’t always a ghost. She heads out into the jungle, cutting her way through the vines until she reaches the log in the road. She looks around for a bit, until she falls through a trap pit.\n\nLuckily, she’s caught by Leo, who, as you probably guessed by now, is the Ghost of the Jungle. His voice is done by James Arnold Taylor, better known as the voice of Prequel-Era Obi-Wan Kenobi in too many cartoons and video games to mention, as well as Harry Osborn in The Spectacular Spider-Man and Ratchet from the Ratchet And Clank series. The two friends sit down in front of a fire as April explains that she was already in the country on business looking for some ancient statutes on behalf of “some tycoon with too much money on his hands” when she heard of the local legend and pieced two and two together.\n\nShe then points out that things haven’t been the same since Leo left home about a couple of years or so ago, looking to find some kind of enlightenment. Leo asks how everyone is doing, and we cut to Donnie running a call-in tech support (the funniest scene in the movie, where poor Don has to deal with someone who doesn’t even have their computer plugged in, a guy who thinks he’s calling some kind of phone-sex service and a lady he mistakes for a dude. You can tell he’s miserable), Mikey entertaining at children’s parties (i.e. wearing a mascot turtle head and getting beaten to near-death by sugar-fueled kids with Nerf bats), and Raph patrolling the streets as a masked vigilante named “The Nightwatcher,” though all April and the others know is that he goes out at night after sleeping all day.\n\nSpeaking of Raph, he just so happens to be voiced in this movie by Nolan North, who you might know as… *inhales*\n\nNathan Drake from Uncharted, Deadpool in most Marvel video games, Cyclops in Wolverine and the X-Men, Giant-Man in the Ultimate Avengers movies, Penguin in the Batman: Arkham series of games, Superboy and Superman from Young Justice, Desmond Miles in Assassin’s Creed, Smokescreen in Transformers: Prime, the Nolan North voice option in Saints Row IV (he’s in so many games that they’ve actually started acknowledging it), and most relevant to this review, the Kranng in the 2012 Ninja Turtles series. I’m missing a few…\n\nOh, he was also Goldar in that Power Rangers game from a while back. And on the live-action side of things, he was on Pretty Little Liars as somebody’s dad.\n\nWe cut to one such outing, where the Nightwatcher is chasing down some armed crooks robbing a store (one guy steals a toaster, prompting the leader to sarcastically note that his work ethic is an inspiration to them all). As the goons try to make their getaway, a metal chain slings out and trips two of them, dragging them into the shadows to be knocked senseless. The others turn around to the sight of a black-clad Turtle kicking them into next week. Soon, all that’s left is the toaster guy, who has a handgun but lacks the nerve to use it. All it takes is one quick “boo” to send him running for the hills.\n\nNightwatcher follows him on his motorbike, declaring that he “loves it when they play hard to get” as he has the goon in his headlights. The scene then transitions to a pair of police officers arriving at the scene of the crime to find the thugs all chained up and hanging from a fire escape. The lead cop knows that it was the Nightwatcher “doing their job for them.” Give it a couple more months and they’ll be working with him directly. Isn’t that right, Gordon?\n\nWe then cut back to April, who points out that whatever training period Leo went on ended a year ago, and that Splinter says he doesn’t write anymore. Leo insists that Splinter sent him there to become a better leader, something he apparently hasn’t achieved yet, and that the people of the villages need him more than the other Turtles do. April tells him that if Splinter were there, he would ask Leo what his heart is telling him. Leo can’t answer that question, and he says that something is missing. April tries one more time to convince him to come back, but by the time she looks up he’s already gone. So, he’s both Black Panther and Batman, got it.\n\nWe then cut to New York the next day, as a van for “Cowabunga Carl” (Mikey’s party persona) rolls into an alley and pulls into a secret passage. Mikey deflates the balloon head on top, parks the van, and slides into the manhole below for a fast-paced and fun-to-watch skateboard ride home. It really does a good job of showing just how at home Mikey is in the sewer, and how his primary objective in life is to have fun. He grinds his away to the lair, nearly hitting a fan before dropping inside the lair.\n\nBut when he gets in, he finds nobody there to greet him. Dejected by the lack of company, he plops down in front of the TV, clicking on a news report of the Nightwatcher’s latest bust. He gets a kick out of being reminded of the good ol’ days fighting crime, bragging about their guns were no much for his “guns.”\n\nDonnie walks in behind him and points out that the glory days are over, saying that Mikey would be better off focusing on his job rather than fantasizing about yesterday. Raph steps out from his room to call Donnie a “has been,” prompting the purple one to joke about his brother’s weird sleeping habits. He musses that Raph supports the Nightwatcher’s actions, and Raph says that it’s better than doing nothing while criminals run free. Donnie points out that he and Mikey have jobs while Raph just sleeps all day, leading Raph to deflect with snark and threats of violence.\n\nSplinter steps in before Raph can punch Donnie, telling him to knock it off. The wise old rat is voiced by the legendary Mako Iwamatsu, known for playing the equally wise Uncle Iroh in Avatar: The Last Airbender. And his voice is just perfect here. Sadly, Mako passed away from esophageal cancer during production, making this his final role. There’s actually a dedication to him in the end credits, just as there is in the last Avatar episode he lent his voice to, Book 2’s “The Tales of Ba Sing Se.”\n\nRaph simply heads back to his room, leaving Splinter to lament that since Leo was sent away, their home has become an empty shell. He tells Donnie that each one of them has strengths and weaknesses, and that they need to stick together if their family is to survive. He then sighs with worry that it may already be too late.\n\nLater that night, a cargo ship drops off a crate from April’s expedition. April calls Casey, wondering where he is. Turns out, he overslept. And he’s voiced by Chris Evans, who you should know immediately from his role as Captain America in the MCU, as well as his turn as the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four movies of the mid ’00’s and Lucas Lee in Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, another personal favorite of mine. Dude’s no stranger to comic book adaptations.\n\nHe gets chewed out by April, who’s standing on the dock with a priceless statue and no delivery truck, which he was supposed to be driving. Casey tries fishing for an excuse, saying that his alarm clock is broken (smashing it while he does so), but April’s not buying it. She goes on about how it’s bad enough that he spends his nights doing vigilante stuff, but now they’re going to miss their deadline to deliver the statue. Casey then asks about the message that she left saying she found Leo, but April tells him that he’s not coming back.\n\nI gotta level here, Casey’s the one character design in this movie that I’m not too crazy about. I just can never adjust to how long and pointy his chin is.\n\nCasey and April head over to their client, a corporate CEO named Max Winters, voiced by Sir Patrick Motherfreakin’ Stuart! That’s right, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and Professor X himself. You’re probably starting to notice that everyone in this movie is awesome.\n\nApril explains to Casey that his company, Winterscorp, is a major player in the fields of real estate, technology, pharmaceuticals, and even hair gel. Ironic when the boss is Patrick Stuart. She tells Casey not to touch anything in the building, so of course he bumps into a display, knocking a priceless vase over and triggering a security measure that puts the place into lock-down.\n\nWe then go over to the man in charge of this place himself standing in his private high-rise office overlooking the city. Winters welcomes April and Casey as they bring him the statue, accidentally calling the latter “Kenny” before asking the former about her trip. As it turns out, the statues he’s having her collect are of the generals from the opening narration, and Winters explains the proper pronunciation of the latest one to be found before waxing poetic about how they are like “family” to him. You might be starting to suspect something about this guy…\n\nApril and Casey head off, leaving Winters alone as a mysterious hooded figure emerges from upstairs. Winters snarks that if she’s come to kill him, she’d best make it fast. He’s got a shareholder’s meeting that day that he’d rather miss. But this masked lady isn’t here to kill him; she’s Karai – the adoptive daughter of the Shredder who’s more often than not in a love/hate relationship with Leo (think Rey and Kylo Ren, but with the genders reversed), and she’s brought a squad of Foot Ninja with her to accept an offer he made, a money for protection type of deal. Wait, did he, like, put out an ad on Craig’s List or something? “Insanely Rich Businessman Voiced By Awesome Actor Seeking Ninjas.” Come to think of it, that might be how all evil corporate heads recruit their minions…\n\nShe warns that they don’t come cheap, but money’s clearly not a concern to a guy with a fancy high-rise and all manner of ancient artifacts about the place. Winters explains that he needs Karai and her forces to be his eyes and ears – he has friends coming to town, and he wants them brought to him.\n\nLater that night, the camera pans along a couple of pigeons roosting on a gargoyle atop a tower, only for one of them to be eaten by another gargoyle, one of the 13 monsters. It’s either that, or we’re about to get a Gargoyles/TMNT crossover, which would be epic…\n\nMeanwhile, the lead crook from Nightwatcher’s bust is at it again, mugging up a convenience store. And just like clockwork, Nightwatcher yanks him up to the rooftops with his chains and knocks him against a wall. Casey interrupts him before he can inflict any further punishment, offering to lend his baseball bat to any crime-fighting festivities. Nightwatcher declines, knocking the robber out from behind Batman-style and readying his chain for a potential throw down.\n\nCasey insists on helping, saying that he could use a “sidekick” before correctly guessing that it’s Raph under the Nightwatcher’s helmet. After all, he looks like a big, metal Turtle. The two then double-team the feeling criminal, arguing all the while about which one of them is the “sidekick.” My money’s on Casey. Casey’s always the sidekick to Raph.\n\nAfter stringing the goon up from a traffic light, Raph explains to Casey that he couldn’t just sit around waiting for Leo to come back, saying that the criminals of New York won’t take a break, so neither will he. He then rants for a bit about Leo, saying out loud that he hopes his brother never comes back. Casey tells him to lay off it, getting Raph to admit that he’d probably leave the city if he could too. But he can’t. He can’t even sleep without hearing the subway over his head. Casey goes on to tell Raph about his problems at home with April and how she wants to “settle down” with him, but he’s not sure if he can handle that. Unfortunately, Raph falls asleep in the middle of it. All-night vigilante work takes its toll, after all.\n\nAt Winters’s HQ, the billionaire finally has all four of his generals gathered and is ready to bring them back to life now that the Stars of Kikan have aligned. He puts an ancient device on the lead warrior, which thaws him and the others out in a glowing red light.\n\nIt turns out Leo has decided to come home after all, hitching a ride on the landing gear of a commercial flight. He jumps off as the plane approaches the city, glides for a bit, then makes a landing in the water to swim the rest of the way. American Ninja Warrior would be so jealous.\n\nBy the time he makes it make to the lair, everyone else is fast asleep in front of the TV. Leo watches them briefly, then heads to Splinter’s room to greet his sensei. The old rat welcomes his oldest back warmly, assuring him that he did not fail in his mission to become a better leader. He gives Leo a medal while Raph watches from the door. Splinter then tells Leo to talk to Raph, since he took his absence the hardest, and declares that he and his brothers are forbidden to fight until everyone’s on the same page.\n\nThe two then notice Raph, who awkwardly welcomes Leo home before stepping out and waking the others up for the good news. They take the news much better, with Donnie getting a noogie from his big brother and Mikey even giving him a hug and telling him about his birthday party nightmares. This is a pretty nice scene, as it shows how much the two younger Turtles look up to Leo as the leader and the cool older brother.\n\nThe boys waste no time getting back to training on the rooftops, where Leo explains that he’s troubled by the Nightwatcher’s activities. Raph jumps to his own defense, saying that the Nightwatcher has only picked up the slack left by Leo leaving. After Mikey asks why he can’t have a jet-pack (he hears the Nightwatcher has one, to which Donnie hilariously retorts that he doesn’t even trust Mikey with a Driver’s license), the guys hear a roaring sound. Raph rushes in to check it out despite Leo reminding him how Splinter told them not to fight yet, forcing the rest of the group to follow after him.\n\nThey parkour their way to a nearby construction site, where the Foot are trying (and failing) to subdue one of the monsters, a large brute named “Bigfoot.” Despite the fun of seeing a bunch of Foot getting their cans handed to them, Donnie wisely points out that the monster is going to run out of bodies soon, and Raph isn’t in the mood to sit around and watch a fight he’s not involved in.\n\nSo they run in to join the skirmish, but their blows have no effect on the massive beast. Karai sees Leo, remembers him and his brothers as the guys who more or less killed her adoptive father a couple of movies ago, and attacks him. Leo insists that they’re not here to fight, but Karai’s not hearing it. Eventually, she orders her minions to retreat, leaving the Turtles alone with Bigfoot while Leo calls out to her asking who she’s working for.\n\nBut he has more pressing matters at the moment, namely the giant rampaging monster attacking his brothers. He joins in the fight, but it doesn’t help by much. Leo tries grabbing the creature by the ears, causing it to roll over the ledge and fall crashing to ground level. There, it advances toward the Turtles, threatening to drive them to the edge, and the jagged metal spikes laying around just waiting for a work accident.\n\nThankfully, the ceiling above gives way, creating a nice little barrier between the Turtles (including Mikey, who freaks out and climbs on top of Donnie) and Bigfoot. The monster doesn’t have time to worry though, as the four Stone Generals arrive to take it prisoner. We finally get a good look at them here, with their cool stony appearance and red under-glow. I dig it.\n\nThey quickly make short work of the beast, and by the time the Turtles pick themselves up and hurry to the scene, everyone’s gone. The cops then arrive, forcing the brothers to make a hasty getaway back to the sewer. Raph gets a glimpse of the truck the Generals rode in, but has to hurry after the others before he can think anything further of it.\n\nOver at Winters’s tower, Karai confronts the mysterious CEO about the monster that they weren’t told about beforehand, as they were just hired to patrol the city and report anything out of the ordinary. She’s so mad at him that she draws her sword to his throat, but Winters just points out that they still made a deal as his General friends gather up behind him, even playing to Karai’s sense of honor. He then turns his attention to the captured Bigfoot, playfully asking the creature what its name is and only getting a roar of an answer.\n\nHe asks his lead General (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, who would actually go on to play the Shredder in the Nick series, using pretty much the same voice he does here) to keep an eye on the Foot despite Karai’s objections, saying that the Generals will help ensure the remaining 12 monsters are captured, and his birthright fulfilled…\n\nThe next morning, Mikey is having pizza for breakfast (of course) and the others are still reeling from the fight with Bigfoot and the resurgent Foot Clan. Mikey tries to make a “your Mom” joke to Donnie, only for him to make a great comeback that it would make her Mikey’s mom too. It’s not every day you see somebody play himself so cheerfully. Also, I love Donnie’s nonchalant tone when he corrects him, like he’s totally used to it at this point.\n\nRaph and Leo start arguing again about how Raph couldn’t follow orders and Leo just being back for a single night and bossing everyone around like he never left. But they have to cut it short once Splinter walks into the room, and the boys try their best to act all innocent while he pours his morning tea and sings an old Japanese lullaby to himself. It’s as hilariously awkward as you’d expect. He asks how their night was and goes on about how great it is to see them together again, before setting himself down to watch his “stories,” aka Gilmore Girls. Apparently, Cody is going to break up with Donna, or at least Splinter seems to think so. He doesn’t find out though, as there’s a news report on about the incident at the construction site. He knows immediately who to chew out for this…\n\nAnd chew the Turtles out he does, especially Leo, who is the eldest and therefore the one who should have known better than to pick a fight on the surface with his team still in disarray. Splinter reiterates that they cannot fight evil if they continue to fight each other. Raph wants to go out and find the person behind this latest threat to the city, and decides to head out for some air.\n\nMeanwhile, the truck rolls out at Winterscorp, and the Foot Ninja take to the rooftops in search of the other monsters. They find another one, a Cyclopes-looking creature, in an old warehouse. The Lead General takes it down after the Foot fail, dragging it back to his truck. Another creature is found atop a subway, and another over a bridge. They are all felled by the Generals and taken back to Winters’ tower, where they are locked inside metal prisons and stored away in a strange circle-like device. Soon, there are only three left…\n\nOver at April and Casey’s apartment, the former is practicing with a wooden sword as a news report plays of the construction yard fight. Casey is reading an article about the Nightwatcher when Raph calls to him to join him up on the roof, even throwing a quick jab at him by asking if he knows where the roof is. Casey sneaks out throw the window while April’s report shows some shaky-cam footage of the Lead General walking across a rooftop. April recognizes it from somewhere, but by the time she asks Casey about it, he’s gone. She knows exactly what he’s doing though…\n\nUp on the roof, Raph tells Casey that they have bigger things to worry about than criminals now. Namely the bat-like monster flying over their heads. The crime-fighters give chase after it, parkouring their way to the edge of the neighborhood. But by the time they get there, the Foot have already gone to work trying to catch it, dragging it down to street level with grappling hooks and tranquilizer darts.\n\nThe monster puts up one heck of a fight though, and the Generals have to step in. Raph and Casey can do little else but watch as they subdue the creature and load it onto their truck. Casey starts to recognize the Generals as the ones he and April were delivering for Winters, but he accidentally knocks off a chuck of roof, giving his position away. The Foot fire their tranquilizer darts at the pair in an attempt to silence them, hitting Raph before he and Casey are forced to flee from the beast-like General giving chase after them. Raph tries to escape with a smoke pellet, but Casey ruins the effect by not running at the right time, forcing Raph to grab him as he hides in a shed.\n\nThe General catches up to them, smashing Casey’s dropped mask (the second one this week) on the ground as he searches for them. In the shed, Raph starts succumbing to the poison, nearly passing out before getting jolted back to life by the General banging on the door. He and Casey struggle in vain to keep the door closed, but General Beastman is just too strong. Luckily a police chopper arrives on the scene, forcing the General to fall back for now. Having just evaded certain death and dismemberment, Raph picks that moment to pass out from the tranquilizer, forcing poor Casey to haul him all the way home.\n\nAt the lair, the Turtles and Splinter have just finished dinner (with Mikey giving a compliment to the chief in the form of a burp) when they get a call from April explaining that Raph is hurt. The boys head over to the apartment, where April and Casey are pleasantly surprised by Leo’s return before Donnie sees to Raph. He spots a half-broken throwing star lodged in Raph’s shell, one that has a South American symbol engraved on the front.\n\nApril inspects the star as Casey tells her about the how the statues Winters was collecting tried to kill him and Raph. April is reminded of the legend of Yoatl, explaining to the others what the narrator covered at the beginning of the movie. She deduces that Winters is in fact Yoatl, living for centuries as various important historical figures (visualized by busts of him in his pad) as he tried to find a way to revive his fallen comrades.\n\nDonnie notes that the tranquilizer dart used on Raph was made by Winters (it literally has his name written all over it). Raph comes to and asks where to find Winters and his “stone jokers,” but Leo insists they get Splinter’s blessing. This triggers yet another argument with Raph, who calls Leo out on quoting a rule-book he hasn’t followed in a year, eventually announcing that he’s quitting the team. As he storms off, Casey tells him to just take a breather and thing about what he’s doing before something he regrets happens (something Raph taught him back in the first movie), but he only gets a “whatever” back as Raph climbs out the window in a huff.\n\nOver at Winters’s place, the ancient-warrior-turned-corporate-head sits in front of a fireplace and toasts his recent success as the Lead General reports that only two of the monsters remain. Winters tells him to get them captured and end their curse once and for all, but Leader points out that their immortality would be lost as well. Winters reminds him who is in command here, but the General’s growl gives off a different vibe…\n\nBack at the lair, Mikey is skateboarding and Casey is playing video games while Donnie and April figure out that the ancient portal in the legend is set to open again at Winters’s tower in about 24 hours. And when that happens, it will only be a matter of weeks before the world is overrun by monsters from the other dimension. Mikey finally says something smart by point out that the Stars of Kikan are like Haley’s Comet except monsters come out, before wiping out on his board with a loud offscreen crash. So close to a win there…\n\nLeo starts venting about Raph (despite nobody really talking about him), saying that it’s always his temper that jeopardizes their missions. Splinter tells him that their team is incomplete, and Leo realizes that the only way they’ll win this coming fight is at full strength, which means finding Raph and knocking some sense into him. He heads out to do exactly that… or at the very least, confront the Nightwatcher, who’s still out there.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stone Generals set the bat monster into the doomsday machine when the Leader walks in, telling them that Winters plans on betraying them and decreeing that the 13th monster must not be found.\n\nOver at a local diner, the best two scenes in the movie are about to take place as the cook (voiced by nerd icon Kevin Smith of Silent Bob fame) notices a strange noise coming from his kitchen. He walks over to the freezer, where he gets a nasty surprise.\n\nHis scream echoes over to the rooftops, where the Nightwatcher overhears a police report of the attack at the diner (I guess he’s got a police scanner in his helmet). He heads over there, where the cook is now cowering in a corner and muttering about his “happy place” as the black-clad biker Turtle walks by. Nightwatcher steps into the kitchen to confront the monster, a scrappy little facehugger thing called “the Jersey Devil” that is currently pigging out on the inventory.\n\nWhat happens next is pure fun as the little monster attacks Raph to the tune of a remake of “Black Betty.” Nightwatcher tosses the thing through the door out into the dining area, collects his thoughts, then gets jumped by the little bugger looking for Round 2. They thoroughly wreck the kitchen before Raph ends the fight by tossing a few smoke pellets into the creature’s mouth, causing it to take off running into the streets outside. Everything about this scene is near-prefect: the music, the frantic pace of the fight and Raph’s constant muttering about how crazy this all is.\n\nNightwatcher then checks up on the cook, who panics and thinks he’s there to rob the place. Raph laments in frustration about this, crying out “why doesn’t anybody believe I’m the good guy.” Jeez, I dunno Raph, maybe it’s because you’re always acting like a massive jerk, you’re wearing a creepy black helmet and you just trashed the guy’s kitchen.\n\nHe’s interrupted by a kunai hitting the cash register in his hand from the rooftops outside. A challenge. He looks up to see Leo standing on the rooftops, looking for a fight with the vigilante. Nightwatcher takes off and tries to escape, but Leo remains hot on his tail. Raph tries jumping on top of cars and Leo swings over the streets like Spider-Man until he knocks him into a neon sign and up to the rooftops.\n\nAfter some more chasing, they eventually reach a dead end. Leo tells the Nightwatcher that while he appreciates the vigilante’s intentions, he can’t stand by his actions. Raph mutters to himself about how Leo’s lecturing him again, while the lead Turtle gives him one chance to walk away.\n\nNaturally, Nightwatcher declines, and what has got to be the best fight in the movie ensues. The moves are so fluid, both Turtles’ fighting styles are on full display (Raph swings wildly while Leo skillfully dodges him, waiting for his enemy to tire out before making a strike) and to top it all off this is done in the rain, which is really hard to render in CG. Leo taunts the Nightwatcher, which is a refreshing change of pace from his usual stoicism. See Rise, you can have a snarky Leonardo who’s also true to the character.\n\nEventually, Raph drops the chains and engages Leo in hand-to-hand combat, which he doesn’t fare much better at. Leo tells the Nightwatcher that anger will only consume him if he lets it, before giving him an uppercut that knocks him to the ground. And more importantly, his helmet off his head…\n\nLeo sees that it’s Raph he’s been fighting this whole time, and is outraged that his brother would risk exposing their family if he got caught doing this stuff. Raph counters by accusing Leo of thinking that the world revolves around him, that he can just leave and return with everyone falling in line. Leo defends his decision to leave, saying that he was training to be a better leader. Raph fires back by saying he doesn’t need a leader, causing Leo to go off on him that he’s not ready to fight on his own, that he’s impatient and hot-tempered, and more importantly that Leo’s better than him. I love how Leo goes off on this rant, then quickly calms himself before the last line. It’s like he got so upset that he forgot his “always stay in control” philosophy for a moment, before suddenly remembering.\n\nRaph doesn’t take this last part well, and pulls out his sais in an attempt to prove Leo wrong. Leo reluctantly draws his swords, and the fight resumes more bitter and personal than before. Raph eventually grabs Leo’s swords with his sais and breaks them, then knocks him to the ground and stabs at his face, just missing by mere inches. Leo and Raph look at each other in shock at how far the latter was willing to go, and Raph runs off in shame. He realizes just now how far his anger took him, and he’s horrified at what he’s become.\n\nBut as Leo watches his brother run away, he gets hit with a tranquilizer dart, and struggles not to pass out as the Generals and Foot gather around him. He tries to put up a fight, but he’s no match for the Generals in his current condition, and is quickly subdued. The Lead General assures the others that while Leo isn’t the last monster they need for the ritual, Yoatl won’t know the difference.\n\nRaph hears Leo’s cry for help and runs to save him, but he’s too late. The Generals’ truck makes a clean getaway, and all Raph can do is let out a Big No as he watches his brother get taken off to certain death.\n\nDisgruntled, Raph heads back to the lair and worryingly confesses to Splinter that he let Leo get taken. He goes on to say that he now knows why Splinter chose Leo to be the leader, why he’s the better ninja and the better son. Splinter assures him that his drive to face the world’s problems is a great quality to have, and that while he isn’t the rat’s favorite student, that doesn’t mean that he’s his least-favorite son. He goes on to say that Raph’s strength and passion can only work when paired with compassion and humility, and that with those things he could be a great leader too. It’s a nice scene that shows how Splinter sees the good in all of his sons, and that Raph lets his insecurity over Leo being ahead of him erupt into anger. More importantly, Raph learns that anger in itself isn’t bad, if aimed toward the right reasons, it can drive you to do good.\n\nBut the time for hugging and learning is over. Now Splinter and the Turtles have to get back to the surface and rescue Leo. They gather with April and Casey to come up with a battle plan to do that and save the city from the monster apocalypse.\n\nOver at April’s apartment, Casey gears up while rocking out to Cute Is What We Aim For (guess he was really the punker after all). April slips on a skin-tight (of course), yellow (of course) ninja outfit she picked up on her last trip to Japan, before presenting him with a new, metal mask to go “trick-or-treating” with. Funny side note, both April as a ninja and Casey with a metal mask happened again in the 2012 series. Also, now I’m getting a mental picture of Casey going door-to-door asking for candy, only to flip out when he gets a rock.\n\nAt Winters’s tower, the ritual is starting to get underway, with the clouds swirling around in a vortex above as the sunroof and the floor open up and the portal machine rises into place, the canisters holding the 12 monsters plus Leo forming in a circle. Karai leads her entire Foot army in front of the tower, telling them that no one gets inside, interferes or bears witness to what is about to happen. She gestures to them to hide (half the ninjas go to one side of the screen, half go to the other), then opens the front gate to find… Casey in the Cowabunga Carl mask. Of course, it’s just a distraction so the others can sneak into the grounds.\n\nInside, Winters oversees the ritual, all decked out in his ancient warrior armor. We pan out to space to see the Stars of Kikan aligning perfectly and firing a beam down to Earth. It touches down in the middle of Winters’s machine, opening the portal to the other world. That’s weird, in most superhero movies the sky beam that opens the portal is shooting up, not down. Way to mix the formula up, guys.\n\nBut something’s wrong. The cell holding Leo starts to malfunction, and Winters finds out that his Generals have betrayed him. Winters pleads with them that he only wants to send the monsters back, to make up for his actions in the past, but the Generals want to unleash more creatures and conquer the Earth.\n\nLet’s see… corporate billionaire, deals with ancient artifacts and magic, wears a cool suit of armor, revives a group of stone warriors that were delivered to him only for them to turn on him later on, and is voiced by a Star Trek: The Next Generation actor. Hmm…\n\nWe then cut to an impressive panning shot of the fight between the Turtles and the Foot, set to P.O.D.’s “Lights Out.” The heroes tear through the ninja army as they fight their way to the tower, even running atop the Foot’s heads for a bit. It’s a really stunning visual that shows off how easily the Turtles can handle the Foot now, having battled them for two movies beforehand. And the music really adds to the fun of it, too. The Turtles always had that sort of Hip-Hop feel to them, at least in the era that this movie was made.\n\nThey finally make it inside with the Foot hot on their tails. Casey closes the door by triggering the security system from before, leaving the good guys alone with the monster portal. They look around the cages for Leo, with Raph finally finding him and letting him out. He and Leo then patch things up, with Raph giving him his swords and telling him that he’s going to need them to lead the Turtles out of there, and Leo replying that he’s going to need him. And Splinter watches proudly in the back, to help drive home the heartwarming nature of it all.\n\nBut the time for hugging and learning is over, again, as Winters is tossed from his balcony by the Generals. After Mikey makes a lame pun about Winter and Fall (apparently he and Donnie had a talk about that), Winters wakes up to the sight of four giant turtles and the lady he hired to bring him his statues standing in front of him defiantly. The Foot break through the door as Winters explains his true motives of sending the monsters back and ending his immortality.\n\nThe Generals step in, bragging about how Winters is too late to stop them from taking over the world. The Leader turns his attention to the Foot and offers to let them join, but Karai points out that it was Winters who hired them, therefore the Foot follows him. Sorry guys, they don’t take orders unless you’re writing checks. She orders her army to head out into the city to find the last monster, with April and Casey coming along to help.\n\nEveryone else engages with the Generals, with Splinter and Winters standing guard at the portal and knocking any invading monsters back in. The Turtles hold their own reasonably well, one standout moment in the fight being Leo getting kicked into a display of swords, only to rise up carrying them all and quipping “Come to Daddy.” Just badass. All in all, they’re buying time for Casey, April and Karai to come back with the 13th monster…\n\nMeanwhile, they are riding in the Party Van, getting chased by a giant Stegosaurus-looking thing, with April and Casey arguing the whole time about the fastest way back while Karai snarks to her Foot Ninja buddy from the backseat. What kills me is how this feared villain and her lackey are basically the kids in the back asking “are we there yet?” while the parents are trying to find their way through rush hour traffic.\n\nBack at the tower, the portal worsens as the Turtles move to force the Generals inside it. They get the bad guys all lined up in a row, then unleash a flying group kick that sends them back where they came from. But the Generals just come right back out, bragging about how they are immortal and can’t be stopped without the 13th monster.\n\nRight on cue, the Party Van and the giant beast chasing it come crashing through the place. The beast rams into the Generals, sending itself and them through and breaking the curse. Inside the vortex, the Generals revert back to human form as they are send careening toward the other dimension, a fitting punishment for all the trouble they caused.\n\nThe portal closes and the Turtles celebrate their latest win. Casey and April climb out of the wrecked van and share a kiss. Karai complements the Turtles for their skills in battle, leaving them with a vague hint that the Shredder is still alive in a set-up for a sequel that was sadly not to be.\n\nBehind them, Winters laughs at the fact that the curse is finally lifted. He thanks April and the Turtles for helping him atone for his past and “making a very old man very happy.” He then dissolves in a flash of light and dust, finally finding the peace he’s wanted for centuries. Kinda like Luke Skywalker. Mikey lightens the mood by freaking out about how Winters’s remains have gotten in his nose and mouth, and everyone goes home.\n\nBack at the lair, Splinter sets Winters’s helmet down in the collection with all the other souvenirs from the Turtles’ adventures: including the Shedder’s helmet, the ooze canister and the Time Scepter. Nice little Easter Eggs to verify that the other movies did happen as far as this one is concerned. Raph arrives and sets his Nightwatcher helmet down as well, deciding that he’s done with the alter-ego. Then Mikey shows up with his Cowabunga Carl mask, wanting to get rid of that too.\n\nThe movie ends with the Turtles running together on the rooftops, with Raph narrating about how they’ll always be there for each other, finishing with the classic line “I love being a Turtle.” End Credits to a rap song by Gym Class Heroes called “Shell Shock,” which ends with the band trading “your mom” jokes in the recording booth.\n\nSo, now that we’ve finished talking about the story, on to Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n\nGreat animation for the time, especially since this isn’t a Pixar or Dreamworks film.\n\nThe voice cast fits the characters to a T.\n\nThe fight between Leo and Raph on the roof.\n\nCons:\n\nWhile their personalities are spot on here, Donnie and Mikey are kind of pushed to the side.\n\nLeo going after the Nightwatcher at the time the city is facing its big monster problem seemed kind of random. It did lead us to the rooftop battle, so I’ll let it slide.\n\nCasey’s pointy chin. I know you were going for a stylized look, and for the most part it works, but with Casey you went a smidge too far.\n\nThis is without a doubt my favorite Ninja Turtles movie. The characters are near perfect, the humor is funny, and the action is fast-paced and fun. I’ll admit the plot is a little standard (bad guy opens a portal to another world, unleashing an army of monsters/aliens) but the action and character interactions carry it through. There’s a great message about family, and how a real family is one that fights from time to time, but ultimately has each others backs in the end. I definitely would have liked to see a sequel to this one, especially with Karai’s zinger at the end.\n\nBut it was not to be. Due to mixed reviews and Nickelodeon’s 2009 buyout of the franchise, the planed sequel (which would have been in live action, with Sara Michelle Gellar and Chris Evans reprising their roles – though I think he would have been a little busy at that time…) was scrapped, and Paramount Pictures decided to reboot the series under the direction of Michael Bay. And next week, we’ll take a look at the results with the first half of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014). ‘Till then, I’ve been The Uncanny Fox. Live long, stay gold, and remember: Never use a “your mom” joke on your sibling. That should just be common sense."
