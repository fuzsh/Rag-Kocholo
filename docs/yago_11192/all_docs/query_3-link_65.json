        "text": "The Renaissance terrapins are back.\n\nThat would be Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael - the four wisecracking, crime-fighting, pizza-scarfing reptiles created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in the 1984 comic book that spawned a live-action feature (and two sequels), an animated TV series, and a merchandising bonanza for toy companies and T-shirt manufacturers worldwide.\n\nTMNT, which comes by way of Warner Bros. and the Weinstein Co., opens in theaters Friday. It's computer-animated, but in a style that evokes the original comics, Japanese anime, and vintage Hollywood noir. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Patrick Stewart, Laurence Fishburne, and Asian superstar Zhang Ziyi are among the voice talent. And The Matrix and The Third Man are among its influences.\n\n\"I feel like people in animation don't know how to push their own medium, at times,\" says TMNT writer-director Kevin Munroe. \"They get stuck in a rut, accustomed to thinking that this is the way animated films should look.\n\n\"I had a production designer come from live action. He had worked on The Matrix, Judge Dredd, The Crow - a lot of really cool genre things. He said, 'But I've never done animation.'\n\n\"And I said, 'Exactly, that's the whole point.' \"\n\nMunroe, a Canadian, was 12 when he purchased his first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic, about a year after the indie series was launched. Twenty years later, he found himself making the trip from his new base in Los Angeles to Northampton, Mass., where co-creator Laird lives. Munroe had the idea of reviving the franchise with a new TMNT feature - a little darker, a little edgier - something that could tap into the original generation of Turtle fans, and also strike a chord with their kids.\n\n\"I brought that comic with me,\" Munroe says, on the phone from L.A. \"I figured if I don't get the job, at least I'll get it signed.\n\n\"And so, we walked around all day in this small town in Massachusetts, and then he signed it for me. On the way back to the airport I opened it up. He had written 'Dear Kevin, make a good movie - or else!'\n\n\"That's how I found out I had the job.\"\n\nMultiple shots. On Friday, Mark Wahlberg hits theaters with Shooter, the made-in-Philly (well, some of it) thriller about an ex-Marine sniper framed by the feds for an assassination attempt. It's based on a best-seller, Point of Impact, from Stephen Hunter, and directed by Antoine Fuqua, of Training Day.\n\nAnd any similarity to The Shooter is purely coincidental.\n\nThat movie stars Wesley Snipes as an ex-CIA agent and ace sniper who's asked to take out a terrorist - and not for dinner and a movie. Only after he's made the hit does he realize he's been set up by his former employer. The film was co-scripted by two-time Oscar nominee Robert Getchell, and directed by Josef Rusnak, of the trippy alt-reality thriller The Thirteenth Floor.\n\nWith Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo in 300) and Charles Dance costarring, The Shooter is slated for straight-to-video release by Sony Home Entertainment, so the confusion won't happen until both titles are in video stores and on your Netflix queue.\n\nHunter, who in addition to being a best-selling novelist holds down a day job as movie critic for the Washington Post, is mildly amused by The Shooter's existence. \"I've been aware of it,\" he cracked in an e-mail the other day, \"and it's ruined my pathetic little dreams of glory.\""
