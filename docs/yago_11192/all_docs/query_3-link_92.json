        "text": "An Animated Account of Battling Colorectal Cancer\n\nThis is just my story.\n\nIf there is one thing this entire process has taught me (other than the million other things), it’s that everyone’s journey is their own.\n\nThat’s not meant to sound super-hippie, but it’s the thing you should remember when you listen to anyone else’s experience like this. Appreciate it as you want to, or don’t, but definitely don’t judge yours by it.\n\nAnd just to temper expectations, I’m not one of these super-informed cancer patients who uses all the proper terms and knows all the medicines, regimes and all that.\n\nI’m just a guy who doodles and writes and just happened to go through this craziness. Writing honestly just made me feel better about it all. And if it ends up making anyone else feel a tiny bit better, or makes any of this stupid disease a tiny bit less of a mystery as a result, then awesome.\n\nSo take this as a story — my story — and please not as advice. Please. I’m still half-convinced stress and depression caused my cancer, which is simply ridiculous, but also a great example of why I’m not qualified outside of anything but relaying my own perspective and experiences.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2020 — THE STANDIN’ UP DESKS & LAYIN’ DOWN BLUES\n\nMy name is Kevin Munroe. I’m 49 years old and a husband of 11 years with four children and a grandson between my wife Mignonne and I.\n\nAnd so far – knock on wood – I’m a Stage IIIb colorectal cancer survivor, warrior, and self-proclaimed Jedi.\n\nWe live in Ventura, California after spending the better part of the last decade working on location between LA, San Francisco, Vancouver and Montreal. I write, produce and direct stuff for the movies and whatnot. Mostly animated projects. Some have done pretty well, while the majority of those that didn’t probably taught me the most. I love what I do and I love who I get to do it with. And I would have said it before all this too, but I’m a lucky guy.\n\nIt all uncomfortably-but-quietly started around August 2020. I had finally gotten a standing desk and was excited to begin working as such from home. Writing a script while standing just seemed like an awesome humblebrag. It had been almost a year of the sofa-as-office working during Covid and I was creatively jazzed about the physical change of pace. Coincidentally, my butt had been kind of sore lately… which I just attributed to way too much sitting at the time, and a sign I needed to stand up more.\n\nAfter a couple of days crushing it like the LeBron of stand-up typing, I suddenly began having pain “downstairs” while standing. That was back when all those medical references had cute self-conscious nicknames like “downstairs” and “output”. We are absurdly to the point now when it comes to conversational medical terms.\n\n“Morning. How’s that rectum?”\n\n“Didn’t crap my pants last night. Thanks for checking in, babe. Coffee?”\n\nIt soon hurt to stand for too long and I was convinced that I was somehow making things worse with the standing desk. That was the core of my problem, I thought. I dunno, it made sense at the time, and as a reminder, I’m a passable director, but a worse doctor.\n\nBut then even sitting began to hurt. It soon felt like I was smuggling an iron golf ball down there… even tho there wasn’t anything chambered up, so to speak. So all I could do was lay down most of the days hoping it’d get better.\n\nMy humblebrag about writing-while-standing turned to writing-scripts-on-an-iPhone. And now my thumbs hurt too, tho unrelated to the cancer inside me.\n\nI started losing some weight, without trying very hard. The irony was that the year and a half before I made a very conscious decision to get eating and exercise under control again. I basically didn’t overeat my calories and moved a bit each day for a year and dropped a little over 50 pounds. I felt fantastic. I stayed at that weight for about a year, then suddenly started unintentionally dropping a couple of pounds here and there.\n\nWe were coming off summer 2020 with our younger boys, which is usually a spring break-like blur of video games, burgers, pizza and Doritos, so I remember I was trying to just make healthier choices again. We all were. I felt pretty good with the first pounds, water weight, I figured. Then I dropped about 10 pounds in a couple of weeks.\n\nIt was sort of your classic slow-boiling frog scenario. You rationalize discomfort. You can easily put off a copay or a test you don’t want to pay for. You can (literally) flush anything away that scares you and pretend it’s not real. Lose yourself and your sanity in Google. I did it all for as long as I could — about a month or so — and then had to go to a GP.\n\nScratch that.\n\nI had to actually find a GP for the first time — because I could not be a more stereotypical middle-aged man — then make the actual appointment.\n\nSeptember and October 2020 brought a few GP visits. A couple of virtual ones to start because of Covid and my massive inability to take self-care seriously. The horrible timing of all this really couldn’t have been funnier nor more poignant. It was like needing treatment for a sunburn in a hospital that’s on fire.\n\nThe consensus was that I had inflamed something or had a hemorrhoid… even tho i had never had one before in my life. So we did the “it’s probably just hemorrhoids” dance that all discomforts in that area are required to perform as a first response. A genius Preparation H racket? Possibly. I tried over the counter treatments, but nothing changed.\n\nBy mid-October, I was laying down for most of the days. I couldn’t stray far from a bathroom and wasn’t sleeping for more than an hour at a time. Couldn’t drive or really walk much at all. I was obsessively Kindle reading both decadent rock n roll biographies and self-help therapy books through the insomnia and was slowly losing my mind.\n\nI was trying to make nightly gratitude lists at the same time as I was googling to find just one medical story that matched mine. Even if it was a grisly one, it’d at least be a starting point.\n\nMy diet vacillated with every new theory between high and low fiber, to eventually not wanting to eat anything as it was just too uncomfortable to go to the bathroom altogether. I stopped a long and formidable drinking habit like an atheist finding God on the battlefield, not wanting to add to my issues. My only pain management turned to hot baths, a heating pad, and admittedly too many Tylenol. 650 mg calliber, cause that’s how we roll baby.\n\nNote: in addition to not being a doctor, I’m definitely not a role model either.\n\nOn October 20th, I had finally typed “prostatitis” in my notes from one of my late-night-paranoid-Google-search-self-diagnosis black holes. The first of many. But despite the numerous notes I made, I never allowed myself to think it could be cancer for some reason.\n\nWhy prostatitis, you may ask? Excellent question. Well, at least it wasn’t “cancer”, right? It would be bad, but not too bad, I negotiated in my mind. A solid bad-but-not-horrible illness. Like the B-minus of middle-aged men diseases. I could live with that limp if I had to. Delusions aside tho, it was definitely becoming clear that this wasn’t a back problem or a hemorrhoid.\n\nAnd if I was being honest, I probably knew it wasn’t prostatitis either.\n\nThe pain never left and soon I started having blood in my stool. Now there’s the normal type (apparently?) that can occur in the most normal of systems every now and again. Then there is the “dude, this probably shouldn’t be happening” type of blood in your stool. And if you’re curious, yes, it’s pretty easy to know the difference if you’re being honest with yourself.\n\nI say this only because it’s something no one else sees but you. It’s like world’s biggest secret between you and what’s in your toilet bowl. You created this dead body. And now you can also completely dispose of all the evidence and no one will ever know. It really is the perfect crime. Just against yourself, I guess. But use and communicate that information wisely, and you stand a shot at living longer and better. Case in point, early Colorectal Cancer detection. (turns to camera and winks with a ding)\n\nSidenote — this also began what I call the “Dark Folder” era on my iPhone, filled with way too many unedited photos of my toilet, scars, and the body parts that I couldn’t see to track how things were progressing over the next year. Or regressing.\n\nBefore all this I used to worry about someone hacking my phone. Now I just pity the poor soul who does.\n\nBack to my point, when it comes to CRC (short for “Colorectal Cancer” to all the cool cancer kids), you quickly realize the system is set up to avoid the cancer discussion. So much so that they’ll tell you it’s hemorrhoids or your diet because the real truth is that no one wants you to have cancer, all callous business interests aside. You can see it in their eyes, even with a Covid mask. I know that’s obvious to say, but the theory explains a lot for me. And explains even more why no one likes to talk about cancer, or even entertain the notion of it existing.\n\nAnd when you’re under 50 and asking your insurance for a colonoscopy (the 45-year-old rule wasn’t set then), they’re not exactly making it rain with scans for youngsters who should otherwise be healthy. In the end, you’re the only one who can advocate for your own health and I was just about to learn that the hard way.\n\nBy the time I had my scan on Dec. 29th, 2020, it had been six weeks after it was first requested. For all the discomfort and the mystery of that time, I still look back at it as a sweet, innocent period — I had no idea of the insane year that was about to begin.\n\nNor the tumor that had apparently been living inside me for over five years…"
