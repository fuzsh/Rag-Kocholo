        "text": "On January 9, 2007, IGN attended a set visit for the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie (officially dubbed TMNT by distributor Warner Bros.). While our memories on the drive to the project's Sherman Oaks production offices wandered back to the halcyon days of pea-green muscle suits, Corey Feldman and, of course, Vanilla Ice (\"Ninja Rap\" y'all!), we were pleased to see that director Kevin Munroe and producer Tom Gray decided to cast off the shell of the series' former self in lieu of something more streamlined -- as it turns out, exclusively in CGI.\n\nThe first stop on our tour of the facility was a screening room where Munroe and Gray hosted a five-minute clip reel from the film. Following a voiceover introduction by Splinter, voiced by venerated character actor Mako (The Sand Pebbles, Memoirs Of A Geisha), the Turtles inflict some hardcore damage on a number of opponents and, in turn, are admonished that the presence of an opponent cannot be the only reason for the four of them to come together. Raphael, eldest of the group, has disappeared for a personal sabbatical, in which time the remaining turtles have cultivated their independence from one another.\n\nAcross a montage of fight sequences easily as dynamic as anything we've seen in previous Turtle adventures, the broad strokes of the story emerge: The foursome must come back together and fight as a team, even as their individual goals -- and a few new enemies -- threaten to disrupt their reunion. Culminating in a showdown between Raphael and Leonardo, the clip ends with a coda from Splinter.\n\nMunroe and Gray met up with us again in a nearby conference room to answer our burning questions about the film. In addition to talking about the basic details of TMNT, including the running time and rating, the pair offered up their opinions as to why properties like this one are so in demand, and suggested what will differentiate their project from other superhero-themed action movies.\n\nIGN Movies: Why do you think we are bringing back all these properties from the '80s like the Turtles and The Transformers?\n\nKevin Munroe: We had a couple of designers working with us who are working with the Wachowskis on Speed Racer, and stuff like that is fun to me. I know it comes off as sort of whore-y to some people, but I think as long as it's inspired and it feels cool, and if it taps into that energy of what it felt like back then, [it's cool]. I'm not gonna pimp Gatchaman, but it's like that: When you sit back and look at it now, it just doesn't hold up. But, when you sit back and remember how fun it was to build those ships out of Legosâ€¦ I think there's a lot there. You can't just go and update suits and stick a generic story in there. So to me it's a lot about how you create a vibe. We talk about that with the Turtles, too. There's a lot of stuff that happens in between panels that you don't see, but for some reason you get an overall impression as you're reading the comic book of all of that action, and that's what this is about -- that sort of energy matched with the energy that the alumni had when they watched it the first time through. I think that if that is the intention, that makes these movies more inspired than half the ones that are probably in development around town that just sort of get born out of, you know, A plus B equals C.\n\nTom Gray: I also think that the mindset of the studios is so \"play it safe.\" You know, Superman was around 30, 40 years before they made a picture. I was on Rocky when I was at United Artists, and [today you've got] Rocky 6! They're taking Dukes of Hazzard and all of these things that people perceive and put new stars in them and [go], \"We'll jack it up and make it for $150 million and people will buy it and we'll just blow it out there on a $75 million marketing campaign and everybody will show up. We're going 6,500 prints; we'll get our money back and we'll flip it on the DVD and we've got our pay cable in there.\" If they flash it through the formula and it comes out profit, greenlight. I think this is why we are seeing in the cinema business, so many of these recent [updates], and Turtles included, that are not 40 years old or something like that. It's truncating in because the ideas are more... you're in a revenue stream, you aren't in the film business anymore. We have seven decisions to make one decision. Every one of those guys that head that revenue stream has an input into your moviemaking process: merchandising, pay cable, foreign, every one of these things that are entering into the decision making process. I'm not sure that this is the way to go. I think [that is] why the company has gone the other way by taking not American projects, but we're going to make Astro Boy, we're going to make Gatchaman, because these were iconic things back in a period that were overseas. All culture, it's coming out of two experiences: out of the Asian, Japanese, Korean paradigm and out of the black culture and to a certain degree Latino culture, because it's different, it's unusual. And so this was just the beginning of what we wanted to do and the only connection is when I joined this company, I happened to produce the first three, so if I never was involved with them, we would have never made this movie, but it was the way to go. And then, our owner, who is 29 years old, grew up with Gatchaman and Astro Boy, and artists like Kevin who've had a great appreciation for this and said, \"You know what, let's not do the happy talking [animal] pictures anymore.\" Cat Tail is a picture about cats and dogs and we said, \"Next!\" We had 10 million on the movie and we put it on the shelf because there is too many of them. So we thought with the superhero [story], if we really execute well we have a better chance at success.\n\nIGN: This Turtles film is not a reboot, correct? Do the existing movies exist in this storyline? Does the animated series?\n\nMurnoe: I'd say this is more [part of] the movies if you had to place it. We acknowledge the adventures that they've been on. I think, if you just look at the three movies, just knowing they've been on those adventures pretty much encompasses anything that the animated series could do when you go from mutants to the whole TCR stuff to the traveling in time. It's a reworked story, yeah, because we didn't have any interest in doing a reboot of it and retelling the origin story. Everybody knows it. That's pretty much the same reason why Shredder isn't in it -- in this first one, at least. The idea of having them reborn as a family, how do you tell an origin story without telling an origin story? The idea is that they've been through all these adventures and Splinter as a worried father is concerned that having a common foe is the only thing that binds them together as a family. That's not the right thing that binds you together as a family. So the family is sort of falling apart at the beginning of the movie, and it's about them coming together as a team and as a family. So at the end you sort of end with this world that you want to go back to and revisit, and it doesn't feel like we're treading in the same water all over again.\n\nIGN: You just said \"not in the first one.\" Does that mean you have stories set up for more movies?\n\nMunroe: Uh, we're talking about it [laughs].\n\nGray: Uh, you know -- sure! I think March 23rd, the weekend seems interesting, and if it's not a turkey, then sure. I think we have to look at it.\n\nIGN: Is this a PG-13 movie or PG?\n\nMunroe: It's close. It's going to be PG, but it's tightâ€¦ but our biggest enemy is intensity. I mean, it's not because we want to be graphic with any of the violence or blood or language, but just sort of that feeling that we want people to feel real peril. That's sort of the benefit of the Spider-Mans and Batmans -- it makes you feel like those characters are going to die. So how can you push that without pushing too far, so you push until you get hit, and then you pull it back. We never intended it to be a, sort of, very G-friendly sort of movie; we knew we'd go too far for that.\n\nGray: We would love to do it rated PG-13, but you can't really. I mean, when we first started setting this up, we went to the studio they said there's no way you can do PG-13 because everybody lives in the quadrants -- the seven to 11 and then the older one -- so we tried to get a compromise where we could shove it up a little bit and get close to it without getting a PG-13. We had to pull back on several items that are really taboo, which are the throwing stars, the shurikens, to a certain degree nunchucks. They, certainly in the U.K. and Scandanavia, are forbidden -- and those are the toys of the Turtles! But it's one of those things where we would love to graduate, maybe, if this thing is successful, take to another level of PG-13 because personally, for me, when we had an early discussion, we said, \"I don't care about the little kids; I want to satisfy the alums which were with us back in the day in the '90s.\" I said, \"If we can make them happy, then I don't care.\" The little ones are going to get it off the television and they run around and they're looking at the toys, but those alumni that really made this happen in the beginning, those are the ones you've really got to [satisfy].\n\nWhen I bought it in June of 1988, I wasn't completely sold on the concept myself. I was coming from a company that made all of the kung fu movies in Hong Kong with Jackie Chan and Jet Li and earlier, Bruce Lee movies. I said, \"If we could take the Ninja Turtles and throw them in some suits, put our stunt guys in them and put Phoebe Cates in it, we'd get our money back in Japan.\" I have that letter at home, which I wrote to Raymond Chow saying we could make this for three million bucks in our studio in Hong Kong. That became the origin of why we originally decided to greenlight the project. I always thought it would make money, but I never thought it would be as big as it was. This time coming around, it wasn't easy to set up because the wisdom was there's X-Men, there's Spider-Man, there's other superheroes now, and the Turtles don't really have any fantastic things that they do. They don't fly or do any of those things. It was out of the belief from Warner Bros. and The Weinstein Company [that this film got made]. I remember Harvey [Weinstein] was in Hong Kong and we showed him a trailer and he said, \"I missed it the first time. I've got to have this now!\" He said, \"I want this movie.\" So there's never... it's not an easy project because it was post-Howard the Duck in the beginning, when everybody said, \"If George Lucas can't make money on a comic book, how can you?\" And I said, \"Well, George Lucas never had toys and he was never in syndication.\" It's oftentimes what happens in this business -- people that are in the business don't see it for whatever it is. They don't listen to their research departments, who could tell you that this thing was really sitting on the shelf.\n\nWhen Kevin and I were schlepping around town trying to make presentations, what really sold the people was that he cut a really phenomenal trailer, which was very crude in the beginning. But once they could see how these Turtles would look, then it started to become a reality. And the price that we were making this film at, everybody said, \"How bad can it really be?\" I don't know. I've lived large off of this for a long time and I think that it's not so much me, it was the fact that I always felt there was an audience that was with us, is still going to be with us and then we have the new group. So, if we execute in a halfway decent fashion, we should make some money.\n\nIGN: Are we also going to see a new comic book series to go along with the film?\n\nMunroe: I think Mirage is doing like five prequels. It's funny because when we developed the story we had a lot of sort of origin stories of where everyone had been leading up to the events in the film, and so they actually took some of those ideas that we talked about, like where's April before the film started, where Raph was, and they are actually doing prequel comics. I forget when they are releasing; it's pretty soon. I think there's one per character plus April. I think they also have a comic book version of the movie. [But] there's definitely stuff there to play with.\n\nIGN: With what you storyboarded, what ended up being the toughest thing for you to bring to life?\n\nMunroe: The Leo-Raph fight was really hard because you're sort of tempted right away to make it about these two guys beating on each other with weapons, and it has to be such a character-driven performance. It's the apex of the movie; everything culminates in that moment where the two of them just sort of go head-to-head. It's got to have so much subtext in the fighting, and it can't just be about them trying to kill each other. It's got to be [about] why are they fighting each other. It was a lot of action and a lot of acting, and plus just technically it was a pain in the ass with all of the rain. We wanted everything to sort of interact differently - when the rain hit his helmet versus his sword.\n\nIGN: How challenging was it to add rain to the movie?\n\nMunroe: There's a reason a lot of people don't do it, and we sort of learned that a lot on this. To add wetdown and reflective surfaces and stuff doesn't stop us, but we get there and Hong Kong politely asks us, \"Could you maybe not kill us this month? It would be really nice if we had some of our artists still alive at the end of the month.\" So we'd figure a way around it and we'd shoot it and we'd do what we can, but you never try to compromise before you see if it can actually work. That was one of those ones that even in the first draft it always took place in the rain and it always looked like that.\n\nIGN: What is the running time of the film?\n\nGray: 81 minutes not counting the credits.\n\nIGN: What are we going to hear in the film music-wise? Is Vanilla Ice coming back?\n\nGray: Vanilla back? No [laughs]. We got Atlantic Records, a lot of their artists. We're still sorting through that now for certain scenes. Klaus Badelt will score the movie; he did Constantine, so there will be themes, but I don't know if there is really a classic Turtle theme so to speak. The Fred Wolf, I think legally it was a little [tough]; there's a lot of people involved.\n\nIGN: Besides just getting this made, what has been your biggest challenge?\n\nMunroe: That is the challenge [laughs]. I'm trying to think if there's anything else other than that. Um, coming into work this morning [laughs]. No, I think setting up the studio in Hong Kong, that was a really big challenge -- other than getting it made, but that's the first thing that comes to mind. The fact that we have like 400 people in Hong Kong, and half of them this is like their first job. It was half art school, half movie production, so it was a lot of communication and a lot of back and forth. It's amazing because I'm constantly surprised by stuff, like there's like 80 animators over there and only a handful speak English, and the idea that there is so much subtext to a lot of the animation and a lot of the acting and it's just being interpreted by our Hong Kong-born animation director, who just goes in and acts it out in Cantonese for these guys. And the same thing with the action; they just push all of their desks aside and it looks like Fight Club when you're walking through. In the West, animators grow up with a healthy dose of Chuck Jones and Disney and those kinds of animation, but they grew up with a pedigree of Hong Kong cinema and that kind of background, so much of this comes naturally -- on top of the fact that I think over half of them have trained in martial arts, too. So it was really neat to just say, set up the camera here and just kind of go, \"Go nuts.\" We talked about getting a choreographer at the beginning, and while it looks cool for the DVD to show us doing this, it's really more of a side step."
