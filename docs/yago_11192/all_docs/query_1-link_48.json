        "text": "1. Ratchet & Clank is the second film I’ve done with James Arnold Taylor voicing a lead character. The other was TNMT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) in 2007. We have a great shorthand.\n\n2. David Kaye’s Clank character has a distinctive laugh that has been dubbed by Insomniac Games as “the Scooby laugh”.\n\n3. There are Easter-egg references in the film to Sony PlayStation franchises Sly Cooper, and Jak and Daxter.\n\n4. Head of story Tom Tanaka and animation producer Oliver Wade both coincidentally worked on the first Ratchet and Clank game in 2002. Oliver the animator director for the game, and Tom created some of the first development visuals of the Ratchet and Clank characters.\n\n5. There is a reference to the movie Rambo: First Blood Part II in our film, a movie that starred the actor who voices our character Victor Von Ion, Sylvester Stallone. Coincidentally, there was a lighting artist working on the film, Rambo Snyder, whose parents named him after Stallone’s iconic character.\n\n6. In a Galactic Rangers commercial within the film, every shot is an homage to the opening credits of classic TV shows, including T.J. Hooker, The A-Team, and CHiPs.\n\n7. The video game that Elaris is playing in the film is an actual level from a Ratchet and Clank video game.\n\n8. The voice of Ratchet in the first game was actually voiced by Mikey Kelly, coincidentally the voice of Michelangelo in Munroe’s TMNT (2007).\n\n9. An original alphabet was created for the film – which can be read, if you know how to decipher it!\n\n10. Andrew Cownden, voice of Zed, performed all his own beat-boxing in the film.\n\n11. While the film shows the creation of Ratchet’s sidekick Clank, fans will recognize the bigger picture nod to his origin story from the game. Hint: The Zoni.\n\n12. Ollie, the super-fanboy in the film, got his name as a nod to animation producer Oliver Wade.\n\n13. Every weapon in the film was derived from the game series.\n\n14. The cell phones in the film were designed to be from the same era of the first Ratchet and Clank game (circa 2002).\n\n15. The hostile and dimwitted Blarg in the film differ from those in the game in one major way – they have pupils.\n\n16. The movie is the first “organic” version of the robotic Dr. Nefarious the franchise has ever seen. But, as always, the voice of Dr. Nefarious would be provided by Armin Shimerman in his traditional portrayal of the villlain.\n\n17. Rainmaker Entertainment’s actual production schedule for the movie can be seen on Elaris’ bulletin board.\n\n18. Originally there was to be a fifth Galactic Ranger named Stig who was going to be Elaris’ love interest. While Stig remained in the script for a long time, he eventually got cut as the movie was too long. There is a reference to her crush somewhere in Elaris’ basement office.\n\n19. The name Clank comes to pass when Ratchet decides that calling this robot by his serial number is not going to work out. Instead, he calls him by the sound the little robot makes when falling over because of a damaged knee."
