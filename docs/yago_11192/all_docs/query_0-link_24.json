Sure, the overall plot is cliched (when the stars align, monsters, blahblahblah), but seriously, Turtles 3 seems to get more love. TMNT has some really good substance in there and should've gotten the sequel it left itself open for instead of this Michael Bay garbage.\n\n*sigh* I feel like a lonely turtle fan, longing for a sequel that will never be, drifting along in a sea of people who don't give a ****.\n\nSeriously though, Leo and Raph's fight in the rain? Probably the best turtle moment in any of the films. Come at me, bro.\n\nI like this movie better than I liked the live action movies. I have the Blu ray of this movie where as I have none on the live action movies on DVD or Blu ray. The highlight of the movie (Kevin Munroe) is the set up and pay off of the Leo and Raph fight which for me had more tension and weight than all the live movies put together. I LOVED this movie.\n\nAll the turtle love on this board and yet, this film seems all but forgotten. Am I the only one who really enjoyed it?

Probably the best turtle moment in any of the films. Come at me, bro.\n\nThe fight between Leo and Raph was so bad ass. I gasped when Raph broke Leo's katanna.\n\nTMNT doesn't get nearly enough respect. It was a great movie when you consider it was really a loose continuation of the live action films, which meant Shredder was out as a villain (and yet Kurai and hinting at Shredder's return was a beautiful set up for a sequel). And yes, it's a loose continuation of the trilogy. You see shredder's helmet, the TCRI canister, and the time scepter on the trophy shelf.\n\nAs long as it had been, though, I think perhaps people were actually looking for a reboot, get back to the roots and hopefully be a little gritty. Personally, I like TMNT as my second favorite of the four films in the series after the original, better than Secret of the Ooze.\n\nIf TMNT had been a multi-part episode of a cartoon series, it would have been accepted with open arms by most fans, I'd wager. But it seems like it felt more like a turtles adventure and not quite the scope of what some wanted from a feature film in theaters.\n\nPersonally, I'm disappointed it didn't get a sequel, and still really anxious about the upcoming reboot.\n\nI have.\n\nAnd you still think TMNT 07 is the second best ? Honestly,the only thing I hear people talk about is the fight between Leo and Raph. The storyline kinda sucked ( the turtles playing ghostbusters/pokemon catchers throuh out new york ?) And I'm not too keen on CGI Toonz, but the Nick turtle designs are better than Monroe's ( their limbs looked too long and skinny, they looked more like lizards with shells and no tails than turtles.)"
