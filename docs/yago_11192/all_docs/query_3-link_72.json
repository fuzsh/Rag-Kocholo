        "text": "Death Ray and Maya Partner are teaming up to bring the Dark Horse Comic El Zombo to the big screen. As previously reported here at Bloody-Disgusting, Kevin Munroe (TMNT) will write and direct with Chris Patton and Robert Sanchez producing. Beyond the break you can read the official press release, check out the early teaser art being used for the adaptation and read our exclusive interview with Munroe, who talks a but about his plans for the project.\n\nHollywood, CA. Jan. 26 – Death Ray Films and Maya Entertainment team up to bring the acclaimed Dark Horse comic book El Zombo Fantasma to the big screen.\n\nEl Zombo Fantasma, published by Dark Horse Comics in 2005, created by David Wilkins and Kevin Munroe, will be produced under the Death Ray Films banner recently formed by Chris Patton, Kevin Munroe and Robert Sanchez who are currently in production on War Monkeys.\n\nThe story follows the mysterious murder of the world’s most notorious Mexican wrestler who bargains his way out of an eternity of fiery damnation by returning to Los Angeles to play guardian angel to a troublesome teen, Belisa Montoya. He soon discovers that the teen is not what she seems and that their fates have been intertwined for centuries.\n\nDeath Ray Films and Maya Entertainment will bring tales of the undead masked wrestler to multiple mediums starting with the live action feature followed by a new animated series.\n\nKevin Munroe will write and direct with Chris Patton and Robert Sanchez producing. Wilkins and Munroe will co-produce. Mike Richardson will executive produce for Dark Horse Entertainment.\n\nJose Martinez and Kellvin Chavez will produce along with Academy Award nominee Moctesuma Esparza who will executive produce for Maya Entertainment.\n\n“Zombo started years ago as just a geeky idea between two friends who worked at the same video game company,” says Munroe. “But Dave and I always knew that the property had a broader appeal than just its publishing roots, and now we’ll see it finally reach an entirely new audience. I’m thrilled to be a part of creating this new breed of superhero for the big screen.”\n\n“As a Cuban-American in this industry, I see El Zombo as a unique property that will not only showcase Latinos but also appeal to all audiences. It has action, romance, redemption and wrestling, it’s a Latin Hellboy,” says Robert Sanchez. “It’s the prefect date movie!”\n\n“El Zombo is an extremely cool superhero and it’s tremendous, pile-driving fun,” says Kellvin Chavez. “As a fan of wrestling, I used to watch ‘Santo, el Enmascarado de Plata’ one of the most famous Mexican free wrestlers, so I was excited by this project.”\n\nKevin Munroe Talks El Zombo with B-D!\n\nDavid Wilkins and Kevin Munroe’s EL ZOMBO FANTASMA is coming to the big screen in a new live action feature from Death Ray Films and Maya Entertainment. Munroe will write and direct the project while Chris Patton and Robert Sanchez will produce. The live action feature will be followed by an animated series.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Dark Horse Comic, the story is about a famous Mexican wrestler mysteriously murdered and and sent into purgatory. He makes a bargain to avoid damnation by returning to Los Angeles as the guardian to a troubled teen, but the girl holds a key secret the luchador will soon discover.\n\nBloody-Disgusting spoke exclusively with Munroe today to shed some light on the newly announced EL ZOMBO movie.\n\nBloody-Disgusting: Tell me a little background on how this project came together, from the comic to these new live action and animated projects.\n\nKevin Munroe: I worked at Midway games in San Diego. Dave Wilkins was another artist there and we became friends. We started goofing around about doing a comic together and he had this drawing of Zombo. We started bouncing around ideas about this guy becoming a guardian angel and we kind of liked it. This was 2001 or 2002. We met with Mike Richardson and he loved it and he said, “Let’s do it.” His only note was to change him from green to purple because green looks like THE MASK.\n\nWe did the three-part mini and it was really well received. We tried to get [a movie] set up at that point. Some people got it and some people didn’t. Then just recently, after Robert and Chris and I started Death Ray, one of our first meetings with Maya we were talking about all the projects we wanted to do and El Zombo came up and they flipped out about it. They really wanted a franchise and their heart was in the right place. We started talking about it and now here we are.\n\nBD: How daunting a task is it to picture transitioning EL ZOMBO from the page to live action?\n\nKM: It’s not for me so much because I created it with Dave. This is always what I had seen. The comic book was always the best that we could get on paper to do it. To me now it’s basically trying to put movement and staging and going to the next world with that. It’s a little bit of a tricky project because you either will make it so realistic that it loses all of its spark or it could be done so goofy that no one will ever take it seriously. I guess you could say it’s the HELLBOY treatment that once you’ve established that reality specific to that world, that’s when you can start introducing all these supernatural elements and the idea of whether or not Zombo is just going to be a really big guy or a wrestler or somebody in an augmented suit. People will buy that if you’ve done it right and that’s something that Guillermo [del Toro] does so perfectly.\n\nBD: I know it’s early to talk casting, but you must have an idea of who the perfect person is for Zombo. If you are looking for someone that you don’t have to augment with a suit or makeup or CG, your choices are pretty limited.\n\nKM: I know, it’s rough. CG’s not bad. I’m kind of interested in CG, but because of DEAD OF NIGHT pro-prosthetic right now. There’s something about it right now that’s so cool and convincing. You look at the winged creature in HELLBOY II and that thing is near perfection. I would love to do a test. And ther are a handful of guys that could probably pull off that role.\n\nBD: The Rock?\n\nKM: Yeah, The Rock is the first one right. But then it’s like, is The Rock ever going to do a wrestling movie? Probably not. There are guys Baptista in the WWE or something. He’s a big guy and he looks really cool. It’s funny, because we’re talking to a couple of the wrestlers now for DEAD OF NIGHT and I’ve done a few projects with the WWE and I’ve found that those guys are some of the best performers. They probably run circles around half the actors that pop up on the big screen. They go on stage every night in front of thousands of people and they play on that stage.\n\nBD: Aside from Zombo, any ideas of who your dream cast would be?\n\nKM: A little bit, but it’s probably premature to say because I’ll jinx it. I’m still writing the script, so we’ll do that and budget it out and see where we stand and go from there.\n\nBD: What would your involvement be on the animated series?\n\nKM: I would love to be as involved as possible because it’s a big part of my background. I would love for Dave Wilkins to get in there and be involved artistically because he’s kind of the Mike Mignola of that world. We’re talking about that and direct-to-DVD animated stuff as well. It’s fun and I’d like to be involved as much as possible."
