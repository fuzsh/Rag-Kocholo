        "text": "Hey Jack! I'm back, and with me is another Speed-Art, this one of Leonardo from TMNT 1990. So I uploaded The Evolution of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to my channel last weekend, and for it I watched and re-watched all live-action Turtles media way too much. So I wanted to get all my thoughts about all the live-action suits and Turtles out of my mind, so without any further jibber-jabber, let’s jump into it!\n\nIn last place is the Turtles from the Turtle Tunes series, a sorta spin-off of the Coming Out Of Their Shells Tour. This is a straight to VHS series that featured the Turtles singing public domain songs with often changed lyrics to relate to the Ninja Turtles or something they like doing. Think songs like “I’ve Been Working On The Railroad” altered into “ I Like To Skate Around The Fountain”. On top of this these suits are super undetailed, their Turtle shells look like they’;re peeling off their chest, the colour of green is super unnatural, their bandanas are way too long, and their feet are super tiny for Turtles of the Mutant variety. Of course these Turtles had no budget to work with, or at least not a movie budget so there was bound to be some concessions made, but most of the choices they made were pretty awful.\n\n9. Coming Out Of Thier Shells Turtles\n\nNumber eight goes to the Next Mutation Turtles. They have less detailed skin, coloured padding, white wrapping, sashes across their chest with initials, and always sleepy-looking eyes and long pupils. Venus had to have a braided mask and a different look to show her different upbringing, but what are the odds that she was also trained in Ninja stuff? Their personalities on the show start to blend together and they don’t have a villain as memorable as Shredder to take on, instead relying on campy Power Ranger-like villains to fill that void.\n\n7. Operation Blue Line Turtles\n\nOperation Blue Line was a straight to VHS tie in to promote the new LA light rail system and it used suits that were made to appear like the Playmates toys, these same suits would make their rounds at conventions as well in the early 90s. They’re a little silly-looking and cartoony but for what they are they work well and almost appear like the 1987 animated versions brought to life. Although it’s hard to rank them compared to the other versions, so let’s move on.\n\n6. TMNT 3 Turtles\n\nTMNT 3 was a big whiff in general, especially with the Turtle designs. With their paler skin, darker spots, shinier weaponry, and animatronics that lack the finesse of the first two films, especially with the dead eyes and lip-syncing that barely matches what they’re saying. They also wear Japanese armour which looks better, especially since it covers up a lot of their suits, but these Turtles just look bad, like sickly bad. The turtles lack any difference between their faces and the seam of their neck is much more noticeable. While the creators of the Turtles felt like this was a step in the right direction and a return to the darker first films themes, which is sorta true, but these Turtles seem even more childish and the way the whole film is lit makes them seem somehow more kid-friendly...\n\n5. Coming Out Of Their Shells Back Stage Turtles\n\nThe fake documentary following the concert tour featured less sickly Turtles, and they have their shells back and no jackets. Although their shells seem to be super low down on their back. I don’t know why these weren’t used for the actual tour, but I assume they were too bulky to move in so they had to modify them, although I don’t know why they modified their heads and skin so much, I’m sure there was some reason. Either way, these suits look pretty good for a fake documentary made as a tie-in to the tour. Are they movie-star good? No, not really, but they’re pretty good-looking for what they are.\n\n4. TMNT 2014 Turtles\n\nThe 2014 film featured more monstrous, craggy skin, way more clothed, with much more armour Turtles. They have more human faces that lack their beaks. While they’re more brooding like Batman of the time, they’re also a little campy like Batman of the 60s, which is a strange juxtaposition. They’re also basically bulletproof and can not only survive giant falls and extreme damage, but it seems to be hardly a problem for them. Unlike the first film where they seem like they might get taken down, these Turtles seem more invincible, which results in them hardly ever doing ninja stuff and instead just punching and running their way through issues. Although it’s not all bad, as I do feel like the mo-cap actors did a great job and the CGI actually looks pretty great and looks even better than the budget would imply. I also like how the turtles are much easier to tell apart by their height and build, which is something that would carry over into some of the animated versions later on. So overall it’s a mixed bag but I can’t deny the artistry on display.\n\n3. TMNT: Out of the Shadows Turtles\n\nJust a little higher up is their portrayal in the sequel, Out of the Shadows. It mostly brightens their designs, softens their skin, and steam-lined their looks to make them a little less cluttered. Although it’s kinda like how do you dress-up a pig? Yeah these designs are better, but they’re still very close to the first movie designs which were already pretty poorly received for the most parts, but these fixes do make them a little easier on the eyes and the effects and mo-cap are still quite well done.\n\n2. Secret of the Ooze Turtles\n\nIn second is the slightly brighter more spotted TMNT 2 suits. Their eyes are bigger and their heads are rounder and less distinct than the original. And their bandanas are now brighter too. You basically have to think of these Turtles as live-action versions of the 1987 Cartoon series, and think of the first film as an adaption of the comics because of their change in tone. With that, the Turtles are much more juvenile in this film, with some of the voice actors being swapped as well. But for the most part, these changes work pretty well, it creates a more disposable film, but still good for a watch every few years to hit that little nostalgia button. And Jim Henson’s company was still making the suits for the Turtles, and they can really do no wrong.\n\n1. TMNT 1990 Turtles\n\nBut in first place is the original Turtles from their live-action debut in 1990. Perfectly moulded with details that aren’t too spotted but have perfect details that make them feel real. Their faces are more distinct looking and their animatronic components are amazingly life-like, with their best lip-syncing and facial work onscreen. The film itself is darkly lit with some darker themes conveyed throughout, and each of the Turtles feels like their own character. Plus, this movie is the first film to make realistic Turtle suits on such a scale and on such a low budget. Obviously made in the wake of 1989’s Batman when movies were allowed to be made darker even if kids might be the target audience, it’s the perfect marriage between the comic versions of the characters and the cartoon TV series.\n\nSo what do you think, should they continue make another TMNT live-action movie or TV show? Until next time, I'll tell you something later!"
