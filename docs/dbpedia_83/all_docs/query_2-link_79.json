MacArthur Foundation.\n\nHelping to build a more just world.\n\nAnd additional funding from the Park Foundation.\n\nCommitted to raising public awareness.\n\n>> Today, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It is the war that defined a presidency... >> A trauma like 9/11 clears the stage.\n\n>> NARRATOR: ...and a plan to respond... >> We've got to see how we could bring Saddam Hussein into this.\n\n>> NARRATOR: ...that became a war about a war.\n\n>> The president asked Rumsfeld, \"What war plans do you have for Iraq?\"\n\n>> If we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today, does it make any sense for the world to wait?\n\n>> NARRATOR: Tonight, the inside story of those epic battles.\n\n>> The tensions were really high.\n\n>> The whole government turned into two camps.\n\n>> He said, \"Iraq is like a piece of crystal.\n\nYou're going to shatter it.\"\n\n>> Rumsfeld understood information is power.\n\nHe intended to keep it to himself.\n\n>> When somebody hijacks the system, just like a hijacked airplane, very often no good comes out of it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The first night of a special two-part FRONTLINE series... >> My fellow citizens, events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision.\n\n>> NARRATOR: \"Bush's War.\"\n\n( phone ringing ) >> Police operator.\n\nWhere is the emergency?\n\n>> ( screaming ) >> Please stay calm.\n\nMa'am?\n\n>> Help!\n\n>> Fire Department 408.\n\nWhere's the fire?\n\n>> This is another call in regards to the World Trade Center.\n\n>> So we turned on the television and actually saw the second plane hit.\n\n>> I'm going to die, aren't I?\n\n>> No, no, no, no, no!\n\n>> I'm going to die... >> Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, say your prayers.\n\n>> ( unintelligible ) We're not ready to die, but it's getting bad!\n\nOh, God!\n\nOh!\n\n>> My Secret Service agents came in and said, \"Sir, we have to leave immediately,\" and grabbed me and hoisted me up and moved me very rapidly down into an underground facility under the White House.\n\n>> It's so difficult at the moment in all this confusion to sort out... >> NARRATOR: While they waited for secure communications to come on line, the vice-president was in lockdown watching the news.\n\n>> From Long Boat Key, Florida... >> ...the president, first from Florida, stopped in a military installation in Louisiana.\n\nHe was briefed... >> NARRATOR: The Secret Service kept the president in continuous motion.\n\n>> ...Louisiana to Nebraska... >> The president, as we have reported, is now on a military installation in the Midwest.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In Washington, Dick Cheney was in charge.\n\n>> Condi Rice sat next to him at this table, and they watched the World Trade Center collapse on the television down there.\n\nAnd there was this horrible moment.\n\nThere was silence.\n\n>> NARRATOR: A number of unidentified airplanes were still in the sky over the Capitol.\n\n>> The Secret Service had received a report that an airplane was headed for the White House.\n\n>> Oh, my goodness!\n\nThere is smoke pouring out of the Pentagon!\n\n>> Within short order, we had word the Pentagon's been hit.\n\nWe had report that there were six airplanes that might have been hijacked.\n\nAnd that's what we started working off of, was that list of six.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They scrambled the Air Force.\n\nThe vice-president said he was authorized to order them to shoot down commercial airliners.\n\nRichard Clarke was in the bunkers.\n\n>> He had recommended that we use force to shoot down passenger aircraft if those passenger aircraft were hijacked and if it looked like they were about to take out a significant target, like the White House or the Capitol.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Not far away, one plane looked particularly threatening.\n\n>> And Cheney gave an order to shoot it down, and they didn't know what had happened.\n\nIt disappeared from the radar screen.\n\nAnd they thought perhaps they had shot it down.\n\nAnd then they got word that there was a plane down in this field in Pennsylvania, and there was this horror that went through the room because they thought, \"Oh, my God, they'd shot the plane down.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: It was United Airlines Flight 93.\n\nCheney mistakenly believed he was responsible for shooting it down.\n\n>> Please, everybody, come on.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The White House was evacuated.\n\nWashington was in chaos.\n\n>> This is just not the place to be.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Over at the State Department, they thought they were next.\n\n>> We got a phone call saying, \"State's going to be a target.\n\nThere is another plane up there.\"\n\n>> A car bomb has exploded outside the State Department.\n\n>> But apparently we've gotten a report that now a car bomb has exploded outside... >> And just at that moment, there was loud noise out in the streets, and CNN started reporting there had been a car bomb outside the State Department.\n\nIt turned out all to be false.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The Secretary of State was out of the country.\n\n>> I was in Lima, Peru, and suddenly my assistant came in and handed me a note.\n\nAnd the note said that a plane had gone into the World Trade Center.\n\nI immediately turned and said, \"Get the plane.\n\nWe've got to go home.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: John Bolton was an Undersecretary of State.\n\n>> I spent the day at the State Department in the Operations Center.\n\nWe were trying to get Secretary Powell back from Peru.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Powell was completely out of the loop.\n\nIt would take hours to get back to Washington.\n\n>> Powell had very little information, and they just couldn't get through.\n\nEverything was jammed.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Powell's second in command, Richard Armitage, was in charge of the State Department.\n\n>> It was another day at the office for me.\n\nI'd done six years in Vietnam, and this was a problem.\n\nIt just had to be resolved.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In Langley, Virginia, even the CIA was evacuated.\n\nThose who remained were already preparing the counterattack.\n\n>> There were, like, 30 of us standing around, and as soon as the second aircraft smashed into the second tower, everyone said, \"Bin Laden.\n\nIt was bin Laden.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: At the CIA, revenge was in the air.\n\n>> We were fighting these guys, and they won a huge victory on that day, and it was a huge defeat for us.\n\n>> NARRATOR: George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, spread the word: It was Osama Bin Laden's al Qaeda.\n\n>> Everybody assumed that it was al Qaeda because the operation looked like al Qaeda, quacked like al Qaeda, seemed like al Qaeda.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Condoleezza Rice was the National Security Advisor.\n\nMuch of the communication traffic flowed through her.\n\nIn the early afternoon, she talked to the British ambassador.\n\n>> By then.\n\nI think it was fairly obvious it was al Qaeda, and she said as much over the phone.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But Rice was also picking up on another idea already moving through back channels, something the ambassador hadn't considered.\n\n>> She said, \"Well, one thing we need to look into is to see whether Iraq's had anything to do with this.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: In fact, blaming Saddam Hussein for the attacks already had powerful advocates at the Pentagon.\n\n>> On the afternoon of September 11, the Pentagon is still smoking.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld dictates to one of his aides, \"We've got to see, somehow, how we could bring Saddam Hussein into this.\"\n\n>> \"Judge whether hit SH, Saddam Hussein, at the same time, not only UBL, Usama bin Laden.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Later, Rumsfeld's deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, on a conference call with the vice-president, suggested a retaliatory attack on Iraq.\n\n>> A trauma like 9/11 clears the stage.\n\nAnd because the neo-conservatives had their vision already sketched out, you know, they seized... they seized the center.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And on the telephone with the president, Cheney and Rumsfeld argued for retaliation against nations that may have helped al Qaeda, nations like Iraq.\n\n>> Mr. Wolfowitz, Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Cheney all cut their teeth in the Cold War, in the contest between nation states.\n\nThey're not comfortable with thinking that the world's greatest power can be threatened by a couple of Arabs with long beards squatting around a desert campfire in Afghanistan.\n\nIt doesn't register.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Also that afternoon, Defense Policy Advisor Richard Perle made a call to White House speech writer David Frum.\n\n>> He and I had a long conversation about what things the president might want to say in his speech to the nation over the coming days.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Perle pushed Frum to include language that would allow action against Iraq.\n\n>> I said that we are not going to deal effectively with global terrorism if states can support and sponsor and harbor terrorists without penalty.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Perle had one state sponsor in mind: Iraq.\n\n>> When Bush finally got back to the White House at about 7:00 that night, there was a draft of the speech available.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The speech included Perle's line about targeting state sponsors.\n\n>> The president had a short meeting that included Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Advisor.\n\nAnd she said to him, \"Do you want to say this tonight?\"\n\nAnd he said to her, \"What do you think?\"\n\nShe said, \"First moments matter most.\n\nI think we ought to keep it in.\"\n\n>> Good evening.\n\nToday, our very freedom came under attack.\n\nWe will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.\n\n>> The president made what I think is probably the most important statement in all the statements that have been made by him and others, and that was that we would not distinguish between the terrorists and the countries that harbor them.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At that moment, the group that would be known publicly as the neo-cons had been given enough to mount a campaign.\n\n>> When he laid down those principles, I don't know whether he foresaw all of their implications; how far they would take him.\n\nI don't know if he understood fully and foresaw fully the true radicalism of what he had just said.\n\n>> We go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.\n\nThank you.\n\nGood night.\n\nAnd God bless America.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At dusk, Secretary of State Colin Powell finally arrived in Washington.\n\n>> As they flew into Washington, they circled around, could see all the smoke coming from the Pentagon.\n\n>> I had all that time to think about what had happened and what it was going to mean.\n\nClearly, America was under assault, serious assault.\n\n>> He came right to the department just to swing by to have a quick word with me.\n\nI went downstairs and saw him outside the department in the evening.\n\nThe streets were completely deserted.\n\nThe only lights you saw at all were police cars.\n\nAnd then he rushed over for the meeting with the president.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Powell missed the president's speech, but did make it in time for the first meeting of the war cabinet.\n\n>> I suggested to the president and my other colleagues that this was an opportunity to begin pulling together a worldwide coalition.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But building coalitions wasn't on Donald Rumsfeld's mind.\n\nHe raised the idea of invading Iraq.\n\n>> The night of 9/11, at a small group meeting of the principals, Rumsfeld actually puts Iraq on the table and says, \"Part of our response maybe should be attacking Iraq.\n\nIt's an opportunity.\"\n\n>> As far as Powell was concerned, the enemy was al Qaeda, and as he said at the time, \"We know where they live.\n\nWe know where Osama bin Laden lives.\"\n\nAnd that was the attack that had to be organized.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The next morning, Powell began pushing the president to build a coalition.\n\nHis first call was to Tony Blair.\n\n>> Good morning, Tony.\n\nHow are you?\n\n>> NARRATOR: The British were worried about how the new president would react.\n\n>> I think the concern in London, the initial concern in London was there should be no sort of knee-jerk, cowboy instant reaction to this without a bit of forethought about what ought to be done.\n\n>> My customary habit is to check in with my friend in Great Britain, so I'm glad... >> I remember he was very calm in the conversation.\n\nHe said immediately, \"There is no point \"in some instant response that means nothing.\n\n\"So we've got to think this thing through \"and make sure that we go after these people \"in a way that's going to be effective and that is going to eradicate them.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Blair signed on.\n\n>> There was going to be no sort of wild overreaction; that this was going to take some thought and the proper thing to do would be done after due deliberation.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And at CIA headquarters that night, that's exactly what they were doing.\n\n>> We had been working on this for years.\n\nWhere everybody else is looking for their maps on Afghanistan, we're ready to rock, ready to roll.\n\nAnd it really took momentum.\n\nAnd George Tenet said, \"Okay, update the plan and have it ready by tomorrow.\"\n\n>> They come blazing forward with a fully architected plan.\n\n\"We are going to spread this over 80 countries.\n\nWe are going to go at it with this eight-pronged attack.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cofer Black ran the CIA's Counterterrorism Center.\n\n>> Cofer Black, who was an evangelical on the war on terror as it was defined by the president, and he wasn't going to let anybody stand in his way.\n\nAnd, actually, either was George Tenet.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Tenet and Cofer Black vividly delivered the message.\n\n>> Cofer Black, who was the Chief of CTC, said, you know, \"We're going to put their heads on pikes, and we want flies crossing, you know, crawling across their dead eyes,\" and that kind of... kind of headquarters hero talk.\n\n>> You know, the president loves operational guys.\n\nBlack does a great presentation.\n\nYou know, Black has been waiting his whole life for this, basically.\n\nHe's very theatrical.\n\n>> This is serious business.\n\nWe've been attacked.\n\nThis is war.\n\nPeople are going to die, and my guys are going to die.\n\n>> He can talk the talk of bloodlust.\n\nYou know, he's very vivid.\n\nThe president loves this.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But Tenet had a competitor in the room; Dick Cheney deeply distrusted the CIA.\n\nHe wanted his oldest political ally, Don Rumsfeld, and the Pentagon to take the lead.\n\n>> You haven't had that kind of strong relationship between a vice-president and a Secretary of Defense.\n\nWe've never had a vice-president as powerful as Dick Cheney, and we've never had a Secretary of Defense who probably is feared as much as Donald Rumsfeld.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Once, nearly 40 years ago, Cheney had worked for Rumsfeld.\n\nThey would be closely linked for more than three decades as formidable bureaucratic in-fighters.\n\n>> The difference between these two people, Rumsfeld and Cheney: Rumsfeld, he'll come right at you-- there's nothing indirect about him; Cheney tends to be very low-keyed.\n\nIt's just a difference in style between the two guys.\n\nPolitically, they're really... their views of the world and their views of government are very similar.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cheney wanted Rumsfeld to come up with a plan for attacking al Qaeda in Afghanistan, but the military was caught flat-footed.\n\n>> We had no plan.\n\nI mean, to be honest, you have operational plans for different parts of the world.\n\nThere was none for Afghanistan.\n\n>> The regular U.S. military looks at Afghanistan and all it sees is the Soviet experience-- this is where super powers go to be humiliated-- and so probably feels there's been a bit of foot-dragging there.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld was angry.\n\nHe wanted quick action with a small force, and he didn't mince words with the lead general, Tommy Franks, about it.\n\n>> The tensions were really high, and Franks was not getting any more sleep than I was.\n\nAnd, by the way, he drinks maybe 15 cups of coffee a day, smokes two packs of cigarettes, cigars, and chews.\n\nSo he's running on adrenaline and caffeine and nicotine.\n\nAnd so it doesn't take much to scratch that line, and he and Rumsfeld went at it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld scrambled, but Tenet and his counterterror teams were way ahead of him.\n\n>> So George Tenet, for a while, gets the upper hand, and I think that bothers Rumsfeld a lot.\n\n>> President Bush today met with his national security advisors... >> President Bush will spend today at Camp David with his... >> Today, President Bush will focus on military strategy in meetings with his national... >> NARRATOR: That first weekend, as Rumsfeld and his generals were struggling to put together a plan... >> ...whatever it takes to win the war against those responsible... >> NARRATOR: The war cabinet gathered at Camp David.\n\n>> By the time the meeting took place on Saturday morning at Camp David, where we assembled to look at military options and exactly what we were going to do as we moved forward, it had all begun to sink in, the extent of this problem.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Colin Powell was unaware that attacking Iraq was on the minds of many in this room.\n\n>> I've asked the highest levels of our government to come to discuss the current tragedy that has so deeply affected our nation.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The CIA offered its plan to take on al Qaeda in Afghanistan, but then Paul Wolfowitz spoke.\n\n>> There was discussion of Iraq and whether Iraq was behind this and whether Iraq should be included in any targeting.\n\n>> They made Saddam Hussein out to be the greatest threat to the United States and the source of all evil, if not in the world, then certainly in the Middle East.\n\n>> And Paul put a case forward that, ultimately, Iraq would have to be dealt with.\n\n>> That discussion went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.\n\nThe Agency argued that that was not appropriate, not the right conclusion to draw at this point.\n\n>> Powell's reaction was that Wolfowitz was fixated on Iraq, that they were looking for kind of any excuse to bring Iraq into this.\n\n>> Thank you.\n\nThank you all.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n>> At the end of all this deliberation, the president says, \"Thank you all very much.\n\nThis has been a very good discussion.\n\nI'm going to think about all of this on Sunday, and I will call you together Monday and tell you what I've concluded.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: As the president returned to the White House, it was clear to insiders that Afghanistan would have to be job one.\n\nThe lingering question was, who would take the lead, the Pentagon or the CIA?\n\nThe stakes for Cheney and Rumsfeld were high.\n\nIf the CIA prevailed, they could lose control of how and where the war on terror would be fought, and Iraq would most certainly not be a high priority.\n\n>> And Monday, we all assembled in the cabinet room.\n\nAnd the president lays down about 12 decisions, just like that, machine gun fashion.\n\n>> What did he say?\n\n>> Well, of course, the thing that stands out in my memory, because it hit me vividly, was, he said, \"I want CIA in there first.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: It was a body blow to Cheney and Rumsfeld.\n\nRumsfeld's military machine would be taking a back seat to the CIA and George Tenet.\n\n>> And I think that's a bitter pill for the Pentagon, this great historical moment.\n\nThey are public servants, after all.\n\nIn some ways, they wait their whole life to be called to duty at a moment like this.\n\nAnd the Pentagon is largely on the sidelines, watching-- and watching, of all people, the CIA.\n\nWhoa.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But the vice- president was already focusing on a different dimension of the war on terror.\n\nHe wanted to push the intelligence agencies to fight from the shadows, from a place he called \"the dark side.\"\n\n>> We also have to work, though, sort of the dark side, if you will.\n\nWe've got to spend time in the shadows, in the intelligence world.\n\nA lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies, if we're going to be successful.\n\n>> The United States is in hot pursuit of those who planned the suicide attacks on New York City and Washington.\n\n>> The massive investigation into last week's attacks continues to widen.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The intelligence agencies responded in kind, ramping up their rhetoric.\n\n>> This is a very highly classified area, but I have to say that all you need to know is that there was a before 9/11 and there was an after 9/11.\n\nAfter 9/11, the gloves come off.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Taking the gloves off meant they would have to do things they hadn't done in decades.\n\n>> The dark side after 9/11 has to do with finding and killing or capturing people.\n\nAnd then you have to question them, and then you have to keep them, and they had nothing set up with that in mind.\n\n>> NARRATOR: From that first morning in the bunker, Cheney understood he would have to start the process to provide the president unprecedented legal authority to go to the dark side.\n\nHis lawyer, David Addington, set the wheels in motion.\n\n>> So, on the very morning of 9/11, Dick Cheney is turning to his lawyer and saying, \"What extraordinary powers is the president going to need to meet this threat?\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Addington called the Justice Department.\n\nHe reached John Yoo, a 34-year-old lawyer at the Office of Legal Counsel, the OLC.\n\n>> John Yoo very quickly begins to be the go-to guy at Justice who is willing to say yes to everything that the vice-president and Addington are asking him to do.\n\n>> He had views about legal issues that they found congenial, and he was very, very knowledgeable and he was very fast.\n\nSo, I think he was a very important player.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At the OLC, John Yoo, with the input of Addington and the White House counsel's office, drafted his first piece of legislation.\n\n>> It's an extremely broad statute.\n\nI mean, it says use all necessary means to stop future terrorist attacks and to, you know, find those responsible for the past attacks.\n\n>> This has to be a disappointment for the Bush administration, and it's providing fuel to administration critics.\n\n>> A Pakistani newspaper reported... >> NARRATOR: On Friday, September 14, with John Yoo's proposed legislation in hand, the administration asked Congress to approve the measure.\n\n>> The White House tries to see if they can get Congress to go along with giving them complete power to wage the war on terror globally against anybody that they deem to be a terrorist.\n\n>> And the key area that they want is that the president can use wartime authority, very, very broadly constructed, in the United States.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But the Democrats weren't disposed to grant such sweeping presidential authority... and they controlled the Senate.\n\n>> And Congress rejects this and says, \"No, we're not going to go quite that far.\"\n\n>> No one disputes the difficulty... >> And so Cheney and Addington and others sit down after that and say, \"Well, we shouldn't have to go to them.\n\nWe're in a state of emergency.\n\nWe need to do what's needed.\"\n\nThe White House then secretly asked the Justice Department for another legal memo.\n\n>> The Justice Department had long thought that Congress cannot limit the commander-in-chief power, that Congress cannot tell the president how to exercise his judgment as commander-in-chief.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The secret memo was officially signed by John Yoo 11 days later.\n\n\"The president has broad constitutional power to use military force.\"\n\n>> The laws were written and the Constitution that we have gives the president a lot of power in wartime.\n\nThe president is the commander-in-chief.\n\n>> \"These decisions, under our Constitution, are for the President alone to make.\"\n\n>> The truly remarkable thing about the opinion, it went beyond the idea that the president didn't need Congress' authorization and said that there was nothing the Congress could do to stop the president from doing these things.\n\nThat was the remarkable part of the opinion.\n\n>> So what Congress took away, the Justice Department gave.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The president was told he now had the authority to use virtually any means necessary, anywhere, against any enemy, as long as the nation was at war.\n\n>> If you were president of the United States, I think you personally would want to make certain that you had done everything you could to prevent another catastrophic act of terrorism.\n\n>> NARRATOR: That view was certainly held by the top civilians at the Pentagon.\n\nThe president's statement on the night of 9/11 was now being used publicly to make the case for war against Saddam Hussein.\n\n>> I think the president's words are pretty good, so let me say it's not just simply a matter of capturing people and holding them accountable, but removing the sanctuaries, removing the support systems, ending states who sponsor terrorism.\n\nAnd that's why it has to be a broad and sustained campaign.\n\nIt's not... >> And that was taken by everybody to be a sign that he felt that, at this point, we should go after Iraq.\n\nAnd it alarmed Powell and the people in the State Department, who again felt it was inflaming the situation, taking their eye off the real ball, which was to go after al Qaeda and Afghanistan.\n\n>> Are we really after ending regimes or are we simply going to try to change... >> We're after ending terrorism.\n\nAnd if there are states and regimes, nations that support terrorism, we hope to persuade them that it is in their interest to stop doing that.\n\nBut I think ending terrorism is where I would like to leave it, and let Mr. Wolfowitz speak for himself.\n\n>> Mr. Secretary, Mr. Secretary!\n\n>> NARRATOR: This was not the first time Powell and the Pentagon had found themselves at odds.\n\nFor many insiders, the argument began the first day of the Bush administration.\n\n>> Bush wants to send out a message to the country.\n\nIt's a message of national unity-- you know, \"the Florida dispute... the election is over.\n\nLet's all come together.\"\n\n>> We must conduct our foreign policy in the spirit of national unity and bipartisanship.\n\n>> His way of doing that is to announce his first Cabinet appointment, Colin Powell as Secretary Of State.\n\n>> Today, it is my privilege to ask him to become the 65th Secretary of State of the United States of America.\n\n( applause ) >> People are saying, \"Wow!\n\nColin Powell is going to be huge in this administration.\"\n\nHere's a guy who has been a National Security Advisor, a four-star general, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, knows all the players, and now he is Secretary of State.\n\nAnd his approval rating is higher than the president's.\n\nThis is a guy Americans know and think they love.\n\n>> It is absolutely a given... >> Powell has a very expansive press conference.\n\n>> ...America will remain very much engaged in the Middle East.\n\nWe will defend our interests from a position of strength... >> He talks about all kinds of things.\n\nHe also mentions defense issues.\n\n>> Our armed forces are stretched rather thin, and there is a limit to how many of these deployments we can sustain.\n\n>> And the more he talks, he begins to create concern that he is not only going to be the Secretary of State, that he will have considerable influence over the Pentagon, too.\n\n>> And I think a national missile defense is an essential part of our overall strategic force posture... >> After all, this is a Secretary of State who has been chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who knows military issues well.\n\n>> Thank you all for having us.\n\nGod bless.\n\n( applause ) >> NARRATOR: But appearances can be deceiving.\n\nPowell made the president's conservative supporters uneasy, and there had always been friction with Vice President Cheney.\n\n>> And you begin to get a very quiet groundswell.\n\nWe need a strong Secretary of Defense who will keep Colin Powell in check and make sure he's not running the Pentagon as well as the State Department.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cheney had in mind Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense, a 68-year-old veteran of the Republican ideological wars.\n\n>> Today, it is my honor to announce... >> NARRATOR: The president agreed.\n\n>> ...that I am submitting the name of Donald Rumsfeld to be Secretary of Defense.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Now, the hawks had their man.\n\n>> I think these guys have rubbed each other wrong for a long time.\n\n>> His record of service to the country is extraordinary.\n\n>> It's a different outlook, a different history, just a different approach.\n\n>> Powell's vision of the world was not, as we see, the one shared by the other alpha males in the Cabinet.\n\nAnd there are a group of them that are really formidable: George Tenet, Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld.\n\nThey're all such dominant characters.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Inside the administration, Powell was isolated, but he did have a powerful ally in Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nIn late September, Blair came to Washington.\n\n>> We arrived at the White House in time for supper before the speech the president was going to deliver.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Blair wanted to meet with the president in person.\n\nHe was worried Bush was gunning for Saddam Hussein.\n\nPrivately, the president told Blair Afghanistan was his top priority.\n\nHe had tabled Iraq.\n\n>> The president had himself taken that decision over the weekend, that whatever might follow, the primary target was al Qaeda.\n\nSo, by the time Blair came to Washington to have his talks with the president, he found himself pushing at an open door.\n\n>> Mr. Speaker, the president of the United States.\n\n( cheers and applause ) >> NARRATOR: That evening, Blair was the president's honored guest.\n\n>> America has no truer friend than Great Britain.\n\n( applause ) >> I felt that sometimes that the Number Ten team found it exhilarating, almost intoxicating, to find themselves in a situation where, with the president of the world's only superpower, they could actually shift the pieces to change the international geopolitic, if you like.\n\nSo all this was intoxicating brew, an intoxicating brew.\n\n>> And tonight, the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban: deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land.\n\n( applause ) >> NARRATOR: The war with Afghanistan was now in motion.\n\nThe president had been fine-tuning the CIA war plan for days.\n\n>> When we put the map out on the table and you look at the map and you look at Afghanistan and you look where it is, and I think the color kind of drained from everybody's faces.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But the plan was fresh and daring, an unconventional force with paramilitary officers linking up with anti-Taliban guerillas.\n\n>> My team of... there were seven officers, including myself and three air crew, flew in on the 26th of September.\n\nWhen I began to distribute money-- $200,000 here, $250,000 for this-- I think that the Afghans were convinced that we were sincere.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It would be a new kind of war against an invisible enemy.\n\n>> You read the stories about what these people did on the ground in Afghanistan, and it is like you could make movies out of it, it's so fantastic.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The plan was all about size and speed and using just the right CIA officers.\n\n>> And they had to be guys that we knew that we could trust.\n\nCofer Black told me, \"One-third of your men will die.\n\nBe prepared for that.\n\nI accept it, you need to accept it.\n\nProceed aggressively.\n\nI want you killing the enemy in 48 hours.\n\nFind them and destroy them.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: They would spend millions to buy the support of the Northern Alliance, ragtag fighters led by brutal warlords.\n\n>> It's going to be a multi-prong threat attack where we work with locals.\n\nWe compromised enemies, we used cash, we provided humanitarian aid.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But once the covert side of the CIA plan was finished in late September, they needed the U. S. military, Don Rumsfeld's military.\n\nBut they didn't come.\n\nThe CIA would wait and wait for almost a month.\n\n>> We were there for just about a month by ourselves in the valley.\n\nWe were the only Americans in country for almost a month.\n\n>> Leader of the ruling Taliban again refused to hand over bin Laden... >> NARRATOR: There was a fiery National Security Council meeting.\n\nThe CIA complained Rumsfeld was dragging his feet in Afghanistan.\n\nRumsfeld didn't like taking orders from the CIA.\n\n>> We're briefing the president about Afghanistan operations, and Mr. Tenet briefed and Mr. Rumsfeld briefed.\n\nAnd the president saw me looking a little quizzical and said, \"What's the matter, Rich?\n\nWhat's... what's your problem?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Mr. President, this sounds FUBAR to me.\"\n\nAnd he said... he was a little annoyed.\n\nAnd he said, \"Really?\n\nWhat?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"I don't know who's in charge here.\n\nAnd it's not... you got to have someone in charge.\"\n\n>> There was a lot of jealousy that Tenet had a leg up and Rumsfeld was about three yards back.\n\n>> Rumsfeld went to the president and said, \"The CIA has to work for me or this isn't going to work.\"\n\n>> I've got a lot of respect for Rumsfeld as a bureaucratic in-fighter.\n\nHe never loses a battle, because if he loses a battle, he'll re-fight the next morning.\n\n>> Later, Mr. Bush told Dr.Rice, the National Security Advisor, that Armitage was right.\n\n\"Fix this, get somebody in charge.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld would now be in charge.\n\n>> That's what happened.\n\nThe CIA works for Rumsfeld.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The CIA had waited a month.\n\nSoon, Army special ops teams were airlifted to Afghanistan, and the military side of Operation Jawbreaker could begin in earnest.\n\n>> And it wasn't until the night of the 19th of October or the morning of the 20th that the first Special Forces A-Team came in.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The Northern Alliance on horseback, the special ops teams with global positioning devices calling in air strikes made short work of the Taliban forces.\n\nIt didn't take long for the capital, Kabul, to fall.\n\n>> And I was absolutely convinced that that would happen and that the Taliban would break quickly.\n\nThat could have happened in October, early October.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld's push for control of the war in Afghanistan had worked.\n\nNow, he was the public face of the war.\n\n>> All together now, \"Quagmire!\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: And his popularity soared.\n\n>> You'll have to excuse me.\n\nI'm a little nervous being in the presence of a TV star this morning.\n\n>> Come on, now!\n\nDon't give me that stuff!\n\n>> He proves that he's just a great public spokesman.\n\nI mean, he manages to take the Defense Department podium, and he's the center of it.\n\n>> Nothing in the defense establishment, nothing you own in your homes is perfect.\n\nYour cars aren't perfect, your bikes aren't perfect, our eyeglasses aren't perfect.\n\nFirst of all, you're... you're beginning with an illogical premise and proceeding perfectly logically to an illogical conclusion.\n\n>> Nothing succeeds like success, and the American military was succeeding remarkably well in Afghanistan.\n\nAnd a lot of people knew that Don Rumsfeld had a lot to do with that.\n\n>> NARRATOR: That wasn't the way the CIA saw it.\n\nIt was their view that they had been responsible for the success in Afghanistan.\n\n>> We like the survivors of 9/11 to know that those of us in the business consider it the CIA's finest hour.\n\nWe went in to kick ass, and we did.\n\n>> NARRATOR: There was unfinished business in Afghanistan.\n\nOsama bin Laden was still on the run.\n\n>> I'm looking for bin Laden right away.\n\nI want to start killing him and his people immediately.\n\n>> We had intelligence that continued to develop that bin Laden and Zawahiri were in Afghanistan, probably in the eastern areas, hiding out there.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The CIA tried to put together a team to chase bin Laden.\n\nIt wasn't easy.\n\n>> I asked army special forces if they'll send people in.\n\nThey say, \"No, we're not going down there.\n\nIt's not stable.\n\nYou don't have a reliable ally.\"\n\n>> The conditions for al Qaeda's retreat were quite favorable, and the United States did not do the one thing that the Pentagon had within its power to do, which was to move regular U. S. troops into a blocking position behind these mountains.\n\n>> We had come from the north, west and south, but we couldn't block the east.\n\nIt's rugged, rugged terrain, and we didn't have enough U.S. troops.\n\n>> How do you block this entire mountain line?\n\nIt's like blocking the border of New Mexico from Mexico and hoping you can keep people from going both ways, with tunnels underneath, hundreds of them.\n\n>> We could all feel it slipping away, as week after week after week went by, and the U. S. had no military units on the ground except a few special forces.\n\n>> NARRATOR: So on his own, and without the permission of the Defense Department, CIA officer Berntsen sent a small group to Nangahar province.\n\n>> Based on intelligence that we have that bin Laden has fallen back with about a thousand people.\n\nAnd then we come upon his camp at Melowah.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The CIA urgently called the Pentagon.\n\nThey were given air support, but not the Army Rangers.\n\n>> And then four guys, two CIA officers and two JSOC, with about ten Afghan guards, call in the first 56 hours of air strikes against the mother load of al Qaeda down below them.\n\n( blasts heard ) It was a nice beginning to what would be about a 16-day battle.\n\n>> We actually, I'm convinced, wounded him.\n\nHe was there at Tora Bora.\n\nI don't think there's any question now that bin Laden was at Tora Bora and was wounded in some way.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the end, the United States military would not or could not close the border to Pakistan.\n\nBin Laden escaped.\n\n>> Anti-Taliban forces are now believed to hold thousands of prisoners.\n\n>> There are 2,000 men and women jailed here.\n\n>> Large numbers of Taliban prisoners still held in an Afghan jail.\n\n>> ...evidence of six detainees died in American custody.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Meanwhile, a new problem: handling the thousands of prisoners that had been taken off the battlefields.\n\n>> We started thinking about, well, what happens when we catch other al Qaeda members?\n\nWhat happens?\n\nDo we try them?\n\nDo we detain them?\n\nWhere can we detain them?\n\n>> You can't kill him, you can't let him go because he's far too dangerous and potentially far too valuable as a source of intelligence, and you can't try him in the ordinary civilian court system.\n\nSo what do you do with this person?\n\n>> NARRATOR: The vice-president had a plan.\n\nAt their weekly lunch on November 13, 2001, in a small dining room just off the Oval Office, he delivered a four-page document to the president.\n\n>> We know from witnesses that Cheney walks in the room with the document.\n\nWe know he carries it back out with him afterward.\n\nWe know that it then changes hands four times around the West Wing of the White House.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Within an hour, the document was ready for the president's signature.\n\n>> What I remember is standing in the Staff Secretary's office in the West Wing with Stuart Bowen, with final copies of the military order for the president to sign, and being aware that was about to leave the West Wing for some trip.\n\nIn fact, I think we could hear the helicopter landing on the lawn as we approached the Oval Office.\n\n>> And Bowen says, \"That's not the way it works around here.\n\nThe way it works around here is that every single person with the rank of assistant to the president, every one of them gets to look at this thing first, make their comments, sign off.\n\nThen it goes to the president.\"\n\nBowen gets told, \"This can't wait; this is urgent.\n\nThis is secret, this... the president's waiting for it.\n\nHe already knows it's coming.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The document was an authorization that would keep detainees out of civilian courts and allow military trials under special rules set by Donald Rumsfeld.\n\n>> They basically thought that the military commissions were a way for the president to both bring the charges, and do the trial and then sentence the person, all... do every single aspect of it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At the State Department, there were almost two dozen lawyers who had been studying the issue for weeks.\n\nColin Powell's War Crimes Ambassador, Pierre-Richard Prosper, led the group.\n\n>> I put the problem on the table.\n\nHow are we going to deal with them?\n\nHow can we prosecute them?\n\nWhat can we prosecute them for?\n\nAnd, ultimately, where will they be detained?\n\n>> NARRATOR: But Powell and Prosper did not know about the vice-president's secret plan, which was delivered to the president by White House lawyer Brad Berensen.\n\n>> The people involved in this did not want to wait for the president to get back from whatever one- or two-day trip he was going on.\n\nThey felt it was important that the authority to create these commissions exist immediately.\n\nAnd so Stuart and I went into the Oval Office, brought the order to the president.\n\nHe quickly reviewed it and put his signature on it, and then headed off down the hallway with Andy Card and a couple of others to get on the helicopter.\n\n>> President Bush has signed an order approving the use of a special military tribunal.\n\n>> And it was only the latest of a series of dramatic changes.\n\n>> The White House is defending President Bush's... >> It's really to end-run this process.\n\nThey don't even tell the lawyer from the National Security staff, John Bellinger.\n\nHe finds out about it after the president has signed the document.\n\nAnd Bellinger comes bursting into Gonzales' office, saying, \"What is this?\n\nI mean, you didn't even tell me about an essential document of... that's really going to govern national security strategy after 9/11.\"\n\n>> President Bush signed an order to allow special military tribunals to try... >> The news breaks on cable television.\n\nColin Powell happens to be watching.\n\nHe's astonished by what he's just seen.\n\nHe picks up the phone to Prosper, and he says, \"What the hell just happened?\"\n\n>> We did have a conversation, and I let him know I...\n\nI was in the dark.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Secretary of State Colin Powell, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and their lawyers had been kept out of the loop.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban was broken, al Qaeda was hiding in the mountains, and the military had lots of prisoners on their hands.\n\n>> In Afghanistan, the al Qaeda who refused to surrender have been killed.\n\nThe hunt is on.\n\nNearly 3,000 al Qaeda and their supporters have been arrested or detained.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Afghan warlords were paid tens of thousands of dollars to deliver prisoners to the Americans.\n\nOnce they were turned over, the gloves were definitely off.\n\n>> Local commanders were making their own decisions about where to draw lines based on a general atmosphere that \"We're taking off the gloves.\"\n\nAnd I've talked to members of some of these teams, and they made sure that the person got roughed up pretty well in the course of the capture.\n\n>> NARRATOR: A few of them were called HVTs, high-value terrorists.\n\nOne HVT was Ibn al Sheik al Libi.\n\n>> Ibn al Sheikh al Libi was the head of the Khaldun terrorist training camp in Afghanistan.\n\nHe was one of the earliest al Qaeda figures to be given into the U.S. custody.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The FBI wanted to interrogate al Libi and bring him to justice in the United States.\n\n>> Al Libi is identified as a pretty good target because he's an emir.\n\nHe's a leader of a training camp.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The FBI had al Libi, but the CIA, determined to gather as much battlefield intelligence as quickly as possible, took him away.\n\n>> They duct-taped him.\n\nThey deny putting him in a box in the back of a truck.\n\nMy guys that were there saw what they did.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Al Libi was one of dozens of HVTs whisked from one foreign country to another in a policy that was known as extraordinary rendition.\n\n>> He's carried off to Egypt to torture him.\n\nAnd we know that he's going to be tortured.\n\nAnyone who's worked on Egypt, has worked on other countries in the Middle East, knows that.\n\nEgyptians torture him, and he provides a lot of information.\n\n>> NARRATOR: For the next 14 months, the information extracted from al Libi would quietly move through the American intelligence network.\n\n>> President Bush is about to hold a news conference on the latest developments in the war against terrorism.\n\n>> The president will speak to Americans, as well as people listening and watching around the world.\n\n>> Let's go to President Bush right now.\n\n>> Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In mid-October, the president held his first prime-time news conference.\n\nHis approval ratings were at an astonishing 90%, and Iraq was put back on the table.\n\n>> We understand you have advisors who are urging you to go after Iraq.\n\nDo you really think that the American people will tolerate you widening the war beyond Afghanistan?\n\n>> NARRATOR: Washington insiders listened very closely as the president considered his answer.\n\n>> As I mentioned, Helen, this is a long war against terrorist activity.\n\nThere's no question that the leader of Iraq is an evil man.\n\nAfter all, he gassed his own people.\n\nWe know he's been developing weapons of mass destruction.\n\n>> NARRATOR: A carefully crafted phrase had just made its debut.\n\n>> And so we're watching him very carefully.\n\nWe're watching him carefully.\n\n>> NARRATOR: That answer seemed to be a signal.\n\n>> Condi Rice describes it almost as a light bulb going off inside the president's head: \"Oh, Iraq-- now it's time to turn back to Iraq.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The president and his inner circle had been subjected to an intense behind-closed-doors campaign from Paul Wolfowitz and his ally, the Iraqi exile, Ahmed Chalibi.\n\n>> Well, I did.\n\nI worked very hard because I came to the conclusion very early on that if the U.S. is not heavily involved in helping the Iraqi people get rid of Saddam, Saddam is going to stay and his sons are going to come after.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The issue of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and the argument that there was a link between al Qaeda and the Iraqi government was first raised by Chalibi and the Iraqi National Congress, INC. >> It was clear that two hot button issues were terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWe have consistently talked about Saddam's support for terrorism.\n\nWe have consistently linked him to Osama bin Laden for years.\n\n>> At that time, we had INC constantly shoving crap at us.\n\nYou know, they were providing information that they thought that we wanted to hear.\n\nThey were feeding the beast.\n\n>> The Defense Department was paying millions of dollars a month to the INC to collect intelligence.\n\nOf course, the INC itself was an advocacy organization that advocated the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and its replacement by a government in which they would play a major part.\n\n>> You have strong evidence that there's links between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein?\n\n>> Yes.\n\nYou see, the point is that U.S... U.S... >> Where are these... where is... where is this evidence, though?\n\n>> In U.S. hands.\n\nWe gave the names of the people.\n\nThere were visits of al Qaeda here, and there was money that changed hands.\n\n>> Do you have any documentary evidence of any kind?\n\n>> Yes, there is such a document.\n\n>> And that is a document that you could show us?\n\n>> Well, I've seen it, but I don't have it in my possession.\n\nThey could show it to you, I think.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The document was never revealed.\n\nAs much as the Defense Department supported Chalibi and the INC, the CIA felt otherwise.\n\nThey distrusted Chalibi personally, and did not believe his evidence.\n\n>> We said in that timeframe that we had no evidence linking Iraq to al Qaeda and to those attacks.\n\n>> NARRATOR: George Tenet had even ordered a massive agency search for any connection.\n\n>> Tenet, to his credit, had us go back ten years in the Agency's records and look and see what we knew about Iraq and al Qaeda.\n\nAnd I was available at the time, and I led the effort.\n\nAnd we went back ten years.\n\nWe examined about 20,000 documents, probably something along the line of 75,000 pages of information, and there was no connection between Iraq and Saddam.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Tenet delivered the message to the president.\n\n>> He saw it as his job, and he told the president, \"Here's what I think.\"\n\nAnd the president didn't like it, fine.\n\nBut I never saw him hold back on what I knew.\n\nHe told him... everything that I knew, he told the president.\n\n>> Like what?\n\n>> Things that were going on.\n\nHere's... it's the al Qaeda in Afghanistan-- it's not the Iraqis, it's not the Iranians.\n\nIf they do have something to do with it, it'll be a side issue, but that's not the main issue now.\n\nBoom, just like that.\n\n>> So, from the very beginning, he was saying it's al Qaeda.\n\n>> It's al Qaeda in Afghanistan.\n\n>> And Bush is hearing that.\n\n>> Yep.\n\n>> He was hearing that?\n\n>> Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick.\n\nI mean, that... here it is.\n\nYeah.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But one member of the inner circle disagreed.\n\nHis opinion mattered because everyone knew, after Tenet left his morning presidential briefing, Dick Cheney would still be there.\n\n>> Dick Cheney is the Moby Dick of the Bush administration.\n\nAnd it's all very mysterious and it only occurs between him and President Bush.\n\nBut you get the sense that, as soon as the meeting's over, he sits down with the president and says, \"Okay, here's what you need to take away from this.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: For decades, the vice-president had been wary of the CIA's intelligence.\n\n>> I think there's one thing that influences him, at least in my conversations.\n\nHe remembered as clearly as I remembered how wrong intelligence had been in 1991.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It started back in the 1980s, when Congressman Dick Cheney had been frustrated to learn the CIA had been wrong about the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Iranian revolution.\n\n>> I must admit to a certain amount of ambivalence to all of these proceedings.\n\n>> NARRATOR: After he became Secretary Of Defense, he would see firsthand the CIA's failure to predict Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, and then something he would never forget.\n\n>> There was a massive nuclear program in Iraq, nuclear weapons development program, that was probably nine to 18 months away from having its first nuclear weapon detonation, and that CIA had totally missed it.\n\nWe had bombed everything we could bomb in Iraq, but missed an enormous nuclear weapons development facility; didn't know it was there, never dropped one bomb on it.\n\n>> That's at the forefront, at least in my conversations with him, about Iraq.\n\nYou know, \"they were wrong before.\n\nThey didn't get the evidence.\n\nHow do we know what they know now?\"\n\n>> There's no doubt that Dick Cheney comes back into office, eight years later, nine years later, has that, as one of the things burnt into his memory, that Iraq wants a nuclear weapon, Iraq was that close to getting a nuclear weapon, and CIA hadn't a clue.\n\n>> NARRATOR: So, during regular CIA briefings, Cheney was skeptical.\n\n>> Every morning, the Presidential Daily Brief, the PDB, would be given.\n\nIt would be given both to the president and the vice-president.\n\nAnd Cheney complained numerous times that the information coming from the CIA was not very good.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cheney was looking for information that linked Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.\n\n>> But they weren't getting that information from the CIA.\n\nAnd so he put pressure, I think, on Rumsfeld and on the Pentagon to come up with their own estimates.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld saw an opportunity for the civilians in the Department of Defense to finally get in the intelligence business.\n\nInside the Pentagon bureaucracy, he could easily and quietly grow a nearly invisible operation.\n\n>> They needed an office that would produce the intelligence that the CIA wouldn't produce.\n\nRumsfeld said, \"I can solve your problem,\" and he put Douglas Feith on that issue, and they created the Office of Special Plans.\n\n>> So, they're going to do their own analysis.\n\nThey're going to show what the CIA's been missing all along about the true relationship between Saddam and al Qaeda.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They needed people with experience in the world of intelligence, but they hired politically connected policy analysts.\n\n>> I got a phone call.\n\nThe next thing I know, I'm being detailed on over to Doug Feith's office, and that I would be joined by Dave Wurmser, who today works in the office of the vice-president.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They worked in a vault deep inside the Pentagon.\n\nThey had what is known as \"all source clearances,\" total access to intelligence information.\n\n>> I went into the system, our classified system, to see what did we know about terrorist groups and the relationships, as well as their connection, associations with, not only al Qaeda, but also with state sponsors.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The system yielded what appeared to be a bombshell.\n\nIt came from Ibin Sheik al Libi, the man the CIA sent to Egypt and who had provided the information after being tortured.\n\n>> And it says that Saddam Hussein provided training in chemical weapons to al Qaeda.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the Pentagon's secret intelligence shop, the information was just what they were looking for.\n\n>> Well, that information turned out to be correct.\n\nI heard it not only from al Libi, but we heard it from some people from the INC, the Iraqi National Congress.\n\nAnd then we'd take their information and put it back into the intelligence systems.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It was moved directly to the Secretary of Defense and the vice-president himself.\n\n>> A lot of that information is funneled in the form of intelligence reports to the vice-president, to the Secretary of Defense; in fact, to the entire administration.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Then, another revelation: the Pentagon intelligence group heard that the 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had met with an Iraqi agent in Prague-- proof, they said, of a Saddam/Osama connection.\n\n>> We were looking for connections, and that was one of them.\n\nAnd then sub... and then I did some additional research in talking to people who were in touch with the Czechs.\n\n>> NARRATOR: As usual, they sent it up to the vice-president's office.\n\n>> It's been pretty well confirmed that he did go to Prague and he did meet with senior officials of the Iraqi Intelligence Service.\n\n>> We came to a different conclusion.\n\nWe went over that every which way from Sunday.\n\nI mean, we looked at it from every conceivable angle.\n\nWe peeled open the source and examined the chain of acquisition.\n\nWe looked at photographs.\n\nWe looked at timetables.\n\nWe looked at who was where, when.\n\n>> I believe something did occur, for two reasons.\n\nNumber one, I think it's the prime minister who has always refuted the allegation that it was made up.\n\n>> Very early on, both CIA and FBI knew it wasn't true because the FBI had Atta in Florida at the time.\n\n>> And number two, I'm told there was a photograph of the meeting.\n\n>> NARRATOR: No photograph of such a meeting has ever been discovered.\n\n>> I want to be very careful about how I say this... >> NARRATOR: And despite the CIA's conclusion that the story wasn't true... >> ...Mohammed Atta, who was the lead hijacker... >> NARRATOR: ...the vice-president continued to tell it.\n\n>> ...did apparently travel to Prague... >> NARRATOR: He would repeat it regularly for the next two years.\n\n>> The Czechs alleged that Mohammed Atta, the lead attacker, met in Prague with a senior Iraqi intelligence official five months before the attack, but we've never been able to develop anymore of that yet, either.\n\n>> I remember vividly in the driveway outside of the West Wing, Scooter Libby grabbing me-- from the vice-president's office-- and saying, \"I hear you don't believe this report that Mohammed Atta was talking to Iraqi people in Prague.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"I don't believe it because it's not true.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"You're wrong.\n\nYou know you're wrong.\n\nGo back and find out.\n\nLook at the rest of the reports and find out that you're wrong.\"\n\nAnd I understood what he was saying, which was, \"This is a report that we want to believe, and stop saying it's not true.\n\nIt's a real problem for the vice-president's office that you, the counterterrorism coordinator, are walking around saying that this isn't a true report.\n\nShut up!\"\n\nThat's what I was being told.\n\n>> NARRATOR: War had broken out between the competing intelligence operations.\n\nThe Pentagon was pushing information up the chain to Cheney; the CIA was back-filling with the president.\n\nIt was inevitable that there would finally be a showdown between Tenet and Rumsfeld.\n\n>> I've been in meetings where the two of them were engaged in some animated discussions.\n\nYou know, Secretary Rumsfeld is a very formidable interlocutor on a lot of these issues and will make his feelings known.\n\nAnd he is a very smart individual.\n\nBut George was willing to, you know, to sort of stand up and go toe-to-toe at times.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the high stakes bureaucratic knife fights, Tenet often needed an ally.\n\nColin Powell was made to order, and Richard Armitage was a close friend of Tenet's.\n\n>> I talked to George Tenet all the time, as he would tell you, and we're friends as well.\n\nAnd I'm proud of it.\n\n>> They're under attack from Cheney's office and from Rumsfeld, and all the people that work for Rumsfeld.\n\n>> Every time he'd come up and say, \"No, I can't connect the dots there,\" there'd be some static in the system from the vice-president or from certain parts of the Pentagon who were running their own intelligence-gathering operation trying to connect dots which were unconnectable.\n\n>> NARRATOR: For George Tenet, it soon got worse.\n\nThe CIA's newly won resources to fight al Qaeda began to disappear.\n\nThey first saw it on the ground in Afghanistan.\n\n>> Well, you could see changes being made in the U.S. military staffing in Afghanistan, that the Green Beret units, the Fifth Special Forces group, for the most of it, were being pulled out to refit and get ready for Iraq.\n\nAnd it was clear that the kind of guys that I think a lot of us believed were essential U.S. military personnel with special operations capabilities were being pulled away.\n\n>> It was almost taken for granted that we were going to go to war with Iraq.\n\nIt was a nightmare, and I know Tenet was briefed repeatedly by the head of the bin Laden department that any invasion of Iraq would break the back of our counterterrorism program.\n\n>> Among some-- not all, but many al Qaeda specialists was a sense of dismay.\n\n\"Wait a second, this isn't the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is over here.\n\nSaddam may be a bad guy, but that's not who attacked us on September 11, and we're not done getting after these guys.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The struggle with the vice-president and Secretary of Defense left many in the CIA wondering what was going to happen to George Tenet.\n\nHe could fight the White House, he could join them, or he could retire.\n\n>> I think it was a very personal and pensive time for George.\n\nI think he asked himself whether or not he wanted to continue on that road and to be part of it.\n\nSo, I think he had some sort of long nights.\n\n>> Tenet had an opportunity after the Afghan war to declare victory and go home.\n\nHe didn't take that opportunity.\n\nI would imagine that he regrets it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Tenet and the president met nearly every morning, Tenet personally delivering the presidential daily brief, the PDB.\n\nThey had become friends.\n\n>> He's a very gregarious, enjoyable friend to have.\n\nHe wraps his hand around you, chewing on an unlit cigar.\n\nHe loves to talk sports.\n\nHe's a man's man.\n\n>> It's very easy to see how Tenet and George W. Bush would have gotten along well.\n\nThey're both men who aren't going to spend a lot of time pulling apart nuances of international relations.\n\nThey're interested in short, sharp facts, a clear sense of direction.\n\nTenet, like the president, is casual in his demeanor.\n\nIt's easy to imagine, at these briefings, that two men who didn't know each other at all discovered that they were similar personalities.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Some worried that Tenet had become just a little too close to the president.\n\n>> It's a Faustian bargain.\n\nBecause, ultimately, anyone who heads an intelligence agency has got to speak, if he's serving the interest, truth to power.\n\n>> You're committed.\n\nYou're committed.\n\nAnd every day that you go, you're committed more.\n\nI think you have to be independent enough and distant enough that you can say, \"Mr. President, that's not the way we see it,\" or \"Mr.\n\nVice-President or Mr. Secretary, that's not our view of it,\" and then follow up with why that's not our view.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the end, Tenet decided not to resign.\n\nBut over the next few months, the agency would carefully watch what he would say.\n\nOver at the State Department, Colin Powell was involved in his own battle.\n\nIt began over the Geneva Conventions.\n\n>> Powell goes off on a trip to Pakistan and India.\n\nWhile he's gone, Will Taft calls him up and says, \"You won't believe what's happened.\"\n\n>> We were told that the president had been advised that the Geneva Conventions did not apply.\n\n>> Powell gets on the phone, calls Condi Rice, says, \"You can't do this.\n\nYou cannot just write off the Geneva Conventions.\n\nDon't you understand we have allies?\n\nDon't you understand we have obligations under international treaties?\n\nI want to see the president when I come back.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The decision was delayed long enough for Powell to get back to Washington.\n\nHe had been cut out of the military commissions decision.\n\nThis time, he was determined to weigh in.\n\nThe Secretary made his arguments to the president.\n\n>> Secretary Powell's view was that if we were to depart from the Geneva Conventions, we would be exposing our troops-- perhaps in this conflict, but perhaps in future conflicts-- to the possibility that they would be deprived of the benefits of the Convention if they were captured by the enemy, and we had never done that.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But that weekend, as Powell waited for his meeting with the president, a surprise.\n\n>> Powell wakes up to see on the front page of the \"Washington Times,\" a memo from Gonzales that actually had been written by David Addington, Cheney's counsel, dismissing all of his arguments.\n\n>> \"Administration sources last night expressed anger at Mr. Powell, whom they accused of bowing to pressure from the political left.\"\n\n>> This was written explicitly with the intention of heading off Colin Powell at the pass, because Powell is about to come to the White House and to tell the president it's a big mistake.\n\nAddington writes this memo that tells the president, \"You said this was going to be a new kind of war.\n\nThere are people going to come to you with old thinking and to tell you you have to apply a law that was written decades ago for a very different kind of war.\"\n\nAnd he describes famously the Geneva Conventions as \"quaint.\"\n\n>> Powell was furious, felt like this had been done just to undercut him before there was a meeting where these issues could be aired.\n\nThey go into the meeting.\n\nHe makes his argument.\n\nBush says he'll think about it.\n\nAnd then, of course, not very long afterwards, Bush makes a public decision-- we'll sort of halfway respect the Geneva Conventions.\n\nThis was written about at the time as a victory, at least a half victory for Powell, but he knew very well it wasn't a victory at all.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Once again, Powell had lost.\n\nIn the aftermath, Secretary Rumsfeld acted.\n\nThe scene was Afghanistan; the issue, those detainees.\n\nEarly on, the CIA had taken away the high-value terrorists.\n\nRumsfeld wanted the military to take the rest and get what intelligence they could.\n\n>> The president has, as you know, now determined that the Geneva Convention does not apply to the conflict with al Qaeda, whether in Afghanistan or elsewhere.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Secretary Rumsfeld called the prisoners he held \"the worst of the worst.\"\n\nThey would no longer be protected by the Geneva Conventions, they could be subjected to military commissions, and Rumsfeld would decide where their interrogations would take place.\n\nThey would be held far away from the battlefield, on the backwater naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nOfficially, it was G-T-M-O, \"Gitmo\" for short.\n\n>> Guantanamo Bay appeared to be the ideal place.\n\nCuba had no control over it.\n\nYou would not be subject to a local government's interference, nor would you be subject to the federal courts' interference.\n\n>> NARRATOR: On January 11, 2002, the first planeload was sent to Gitmo.\n\nThe prisoners were strapped to the floor of a C-17 for 20 hours.\n\nShackled and handcuffed, they wore goggles covered with black tape and ear cups.\n\nThe military called it \"packaging.\"\n\n>> It would be a very excruciating situation.\n\nMany of them thought they were going to their deaths before they got here and were very thankful that they were not killed when they got off the airplane.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They were taken from the airport into the heart of the base, to a place called Camp X-Ray.\n\n>> In the early days, they got put into what, essentially, are dog cages or dog runs.\n\nThey were these sort of open, chain-linked fences that have concrete floors.\n\n>> First thing you notice is the smell.\n\nYou're not talking about closed toilets.\n\nYou're talking about a lot of human smells.\n\nIt's raw human beings down there.\n\n>> Guantanamo Bay's climate is different than Afghanistan.\n\nTo be in an eight-by-eight cell in beautiful, sunny Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is not an inhumane treatment.\n\n>> Camp X-Ray didn't have any internal facilities at all-- no bathrooms, no source of water.\n\nSo, any of the detainees kept at X-Ray had to be given everything to them.\n\nAnd if they wanted to go to the bathroom, the MPs were required to go in and shackle them, and then move them to a port-a-john to have them go to the bathroom, and take them back again.\n\nSo it was a very manpower-intensive situation.\n\n>> NARRATOR: From the beginning, it did not go well at Camp X-Ray.\n\nJust the logistics of interrogation proved difficult.\n\nThe MPs first shackled, then rolled the detainees down this path to these interrogation buildings.\n\n>> It was a very intensive process to carry detainees from the cell block into the interrogation rooms, bring them back, and so on.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And once they arrived, the young and inexperienced interrogators had trouble extracting any information.\n\n>> The interrogators were a combination of active duty reservists, people who, you know, were trained in the bare bones of interrogation, didn't have any experience because we hadn't been in this kind of a situation since 1991 from the Gulf war.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They did not get the actionable intelligence Rumsfeld wanted.\n\nWhen the word filtered to the White House that things weren't working out at Gitmo, Condoleezza Rice got involved.\n\nShe initiated an investigation, but Rumsfeld refused to cooperate.\n\nRice had never had much success dealing with any of the heavy hitters in the inner circle.\n\n>> She saw herself, as National Security Advisor, as a super-duper staff member.\n\nAnd the problems she had was that she was in charge of coordinating the elephants in the room.\n\n>> She came to this position with a remarkably strong outside group of leaders-- Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, Vice-President Cheney.\n\nI don't think there have been many National Security Advisors in recent memory who had so many countervailing leading forces.\n\n>> Then you combine the fact that the vice-president is really personally close to the Secretary of Defense, that they've been working together, playing together for decades.\n\nAnd you have the Secretary of Defense ignoring the National Security Advisor-- not taking advice, not taking suggestions-- because he talks to the White House at a higher level.\n\nThat made it difficult for Dr. Rice, too.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Insiders say Rumsfeld didn't respect her.\n\n>> Well, he viewed her as a glorified Russian Studies graduate student.\n\nHe was condescending to almost everyone.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And to hear them tell it, he took on the staff, too.\n\n>> Oh, just kind of pissing on the hydrants and making sure that everybody knows that he's who he is, et cetera-- just a way to intimidate folks.\n\nIt was unnecessary.\n\nAnd I thought it was seen... in my own view, it was a rather laughable and kind of a bullying technique.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The skirmishes were often about matters of grave consequence.\n\n>> Defense Secretary Rumsfeld understood information is power.\n\nHe intended to keep it to himself.\n\nThere's an episode once where Defense Secretary Rumsfeld told Frank Miller, the top defense staffer on the National Security Council, not to take notes.\n\n>> It was Rumsfeld who really was withholding major war planning information.\n\nCondi Rice is the National Security Advisor of the United States, and she had to basically employ spies on her staff to go over and ferret information out of the Pentagon.\n\nYou know, one of her staff members would put on his military uniform and go over and pretend to be visiting friends and... to pull out information she needed on troop strength.\n\n>> NARRATOR: It was closely guarded information and had been since a meeting at the White House between Rumsfeld and Bush months earlier.\n\n>> The president, after a routine NSC meeting, took Rumsfeld aside and they went into a little cubbyhole off the Situation Room.\n\nAnd the president closed the door and asked Rumsfeld, \"What war plans do you have for Iraq?\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld believed all the Pentagon's war plans were cumbersome and outdated.\n\n>> The president said, well, he wanted to examine those, specifically for Iraq, and that Rumsfeld was not to talk to anyone else, including the CIA director.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld knew the Army would resist designing new and innovative war plans.\n\nHe forcefully ordered them anyway.\n\nThe responsibility fell to four-star general Tommy Franks.\n\n>> General Franks likes margaritas, and I've got a margarita recipe that... of course, I'm a tequila connoisseur.\n\nAnd so we sat down and had some margaritas and tequila and walked through \"Is this the right thing to do for us, for the country?\n\nCan we look our troops in the eyes and say, 'You're going to die tomorrow, and here's why?'\"\n\nAnd the answer was, \"Yes.\"\n\nSo, after that, no misgivings whatsoever.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Franks, very much a believer in the doctrine of overwhelming force, and Rumsfeld, the champion of light and nimble warfare, went at it.\n\nThe existing Iraq war plan, based on the success of Desert Storm, called for weeks of heavy air bombardment and seven months advance warning.\n\n>> Rumsfeld initially proposed something like 75,000 U.S. troops for the invasion force.\n\nThe Army had in mind something closer to 400,000.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And the more the generals dug in, the harder Rumsfeld pushed.\n\n>> I've heard stories again and again of Rumsfeld actually crossing off individual units from deployment plans, saying, \"You really don't need this.\n\nYou don't need this.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Finally, after a few months, Rumsfeld's persistence began to pay off.\n\nFranks was wearing down.\n\n>> The Army looks upon this process, I think, with a little bit of horror during that period of war plan formation.\n\nI remember one day, the general said to me, \"Tommy's drunk the Kool-Aid.\"\n\nAnd that meant, \"Yeah, Franks had gone over to kind of the belief in a smaller, narrower force.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: But Rumsfeld had also modified his position in the back-and-forth.\n\nSo, after ten months in development, the new Iraq war plan called for 140,000 men, a rolling start in Kuwait, rapid deployment to Baghdad.\n\nIt was neither Rumsfeld's plan nor the Army's.\n\n>> It was a hybrid.\n\nIt was a lot of the old and some of the new, probably more of the old than Rumsfeld would like to acknowledge.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At the same time he was fighting with his generals over plans for the war, Rumsfeld and Colin Powell were at odds over planning for the aftermath of the war.\n\n>> We've organized the Future of Iraq project to draw upon both independent Iraqis and representatives of political groups... >> NARRATOR: The State Department invited Iraqi exiles to think through postwar problems: law and order; basic issues of food, fuel and infrastructure.\n\n>> It involved an awful lot of very bright people, many of whom have the credentials in economics and banking and agriculture, and so on... >> This was a real effort... >> This was a real effort to... >> ...to plan.\n\n>> Right, to be there on the ground the day after, and ready to go.\n\n>> Everybody agreed that Saddam should go.\n\nEverybody would like to have democracy afterwards.\n\nNobody had a clue what the challenges are ahead.\n\nSo for the State Department to have started to gather Iraqis, 200 of them in 15 working groups, was a good step.\n\n>> You're going to have to go... >> NARRATOR: But some Iraqi exiles, especially supporters of Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress, the INC, were less enthusiastic.\n\n>> The State Department wanted to talk about how best we can collect garbage in the streets the day after liberation, or how can we recruit a thousand health workers to go to this or that area the day after.\n\nAnd I said I didn't have anything to contribute to such questions.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At the Department of Defense, they had a different idea about how things would go.\n\nThey expected quick decapitation of Saddam's regime, and then a handoff to the INC's Ahmed Chalabi.\n\n>> It was primarily Wolfowitz who was in charge of the INC and Chalabi.\n\nTheir idea was that Chalabi would go in and set up an interim government for Iraq.\n\nIn fact, Wolfowitz had gone over to Crystal City, which is a suburb on the other side of the river from Washington, and set up an alternative Iraqi government with people in offices, ministers appointed, doing work planning for the new Iraq.\n\n>> NARRATOR: At the State Department, they did not share Wolfowitz' enthusiasm for Chalabi.\n\n>> When I got into the Department of State and I saw that we were required by congressional action to actually fund the INC, I started to look into his activities.\n\nI looked into trying to get some receipts, as a steward of the national funds, from him-- not down to the penny, not down to the dollar, not even down to the hundredth dollar.\n\nI just wanted to an idea of where the money was going.\n\nAnd when I couldn't get it, I couldn't get any receipts from him and he seemed upset about this, I no longer had the State Department fund him.\n\nThe funding went to the Department of Defense.\n\nSo, it didn't take me long to come to the belief that Mr. Chalabi was a charlatan.\n\n>> But he had real believers over in the Defense Department.\n\n>> Yes, he certainly did, and in the vice-president's office.\n\n>> Why?\n\n>> I don't... well, he was very charming and smart ...this is one smart cookie.\n\n>> And he just convinced them that this was the answer they wanted to hear, I gather?\n\n>> Well, perhaps, when you're telling people what they want to hear, and that you'll recognize Israel and you can have bases in Iraq and this will be the new democratic bastion in the Middle East, which can change the whole picture of the Middle East, maybe there's a bit of a siren song there.\n\n>> Powell thought this was craziness, that these people did not represent anybody inside Iraq.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The clash over Chalabi then became bitter.\n\n>> It was both a policy dispute, and it became, unfortunately, quite personal.\n\n>> In what sense?\n\n>> Well, friendships were dashed, et cetera.\n\nI mean, long standing, 20-year, 25-year friendships.\n\n>> You and who?\n\n>> Me and Wolfowitz, for instance.\n\nWe'd worked together handsomely for years and years, and unfortunately our friendship has soured over this.\n\n>> The whole government turned into two camps.\n\nOne of them is totally opposed to Chalabi, and the other one was so pro-Chalabi.\n\n>> What should they have been thinking about?\n\n>> Iraq!\n\n>> So much time has been wasted over who to support, Chalabi or not Chalabi.\n\n>> That's quite right.\n\nThere's been a debilitating and I think wasteful and damaging quarrel over Ahmad Chalabi.\n\n>> So why have you clung to Ahmad Chalabi?\n\nWhy not just find somebody else that's acceptable to both sides?\n\n>> No one else has been proposed who's acceptable to both sides, and the arguments against Chalabi have been without substance.\n\nHe is far and away the most effective individual that we could have hoped would emerge in Iraq.\n\n>> This schism within the US government, a lot of it's centered on you, rightly or wrongly.\n\nYet a lot of it came down to people's evaluation of you.\n\nThe CIA and State, after '96 and onwards, reviled you.\n\n>> Yes.\n\n>> And this became all-consuming.\n\n>> Yes, but, you see, this is a very curious situation.\n\nI believe that the people who did not want to do anything against Saddam took up... took me up as the bete noir of this, thinking that I was an easy target to discredit the entire policy.\n\n>> You became an extremely divisive character.\n\n>> Yes.\n\nWell, they made me so, not I.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The struggle between the State Department and the Pentagon for control of postwar Iraq was settled in the Oval Office when Rumsfeld had a meeting with the president.\n\n>> This is typical Don Rumsfeld.\n\nHe said, \"You can hold me 100% accountable for this, but you have to give me 100% of the responsibility, as well.\n\nLet me run the thing, and you can hold me completely accountable.\"\n\nAnd I think the president likes that kind of a stand-up guy.\n\n>> With more than 5,000 U.S. troops still committed to the war in Afghanistan, the Pentagon is already beginning to reposition its forces.\n\n>> The U.S. military could be ready to invade Iraq within 90 days... >> NARRATOR: As the public debate about the war began building in Washington, the vice-president began to make a new argument for taking down Saddam Hussein.\n\n>> The evidence is overwhelming, and one of the things... >> NARRATOR: Weapons of mass destruction.\n\n>> ...he continues to aggressively pursue the development of a nuclear weapon.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Cheney's newest justification for war seemed to resonate.\n\n>> One of the things we need do is to make the case, lay it out there-- this is the evidence... >> NARRATOR: The case for war was gaining momentum.\n\n>> ...the United States to our friends around the world... >> NARRATOR: Colin Powell didn't seem to believe war was on the horizon.\n\n>> I think Powell was a little bit later than some people to come to this realization.\n\nThere were people in the State Department, people who worked for him, who came to him and said... in the summer of 2002, and said, \"Look, they're thinking really of doing this.\"\n\n>> This is a man of great evil.\n\nHe knows we're deadly serious.\n\nOur friends and allies in the region know we're deadly serious and that we do need to find a way to address this problem.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair was beginning to be concerned about whether the U.S. was preparing for war.\n\nSir Richard Dearlove, Blair's Director of Intelligence, attended meetings with senior officials, including George Tenet.\n\n>> George Tenet puts a fine edge on it by explaining the political realities in Washington to Sir Richard Dearlove.\n\n>> And went back to brief his prime minister and told his prime minister exactly what was taking place in the U.S., and that was that the plan for the United States was to wrap the intelligence around the policy, which is the complete reverse of the way you're supposed to do it in the intelligence community.\n\n>> \"Military action was now seen as inevitable.\"\n\n\"The intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Tony Blair now knew the administration was headed for war in Iraq, and as the summer of 2002 wore on, Colin Powell also finally began to realize what was happening.\n\n>> Powell felt, as Armitage kept telling him, that Rumsfeld had access to the president that he didn't have.\n\nPowell really blamed Rice for this, that she did not do what the first duty he felt of a National Security Advisor would be, which is to make sure that the president gets a wide range of views from his Cabinet.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In August, the war over the war heated up.\n\nThe foreign policy moderates that had surrounded the president's father started to speak out.\n\nBrent Scowcroft, his father's national security advisor, wrote an op-ed piece in \"The Washington Post.\"\n\n>> The Scowcroft article suddenly created a kind of momentum behind those who were saying, \"We don't understand where you're going, and you look like you're going without having made a case, and you look like you're going on your own.\n\nWhere's the international support?\"\n\nAnd suddenly, the administration was on the defensive.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Powell seized the moment.\n\nHoping to get a meeting with the president, he called Rice.\n\n>> He says, \"I need to see the president.\"\n\nAnd she says, \"I think that's a good idea.\"\n\nObviously, the depressing thing for Powell is that he has to call the National Security Advisor to get an appointment with the president.\n\nHe's Secretary of State-- you'd think he could call himself, but that's not how it worked in the first term for him.\n\nAnd so, she says, \"Come by.\"\n\nAnd they all... they have dinner.\n\n>> I think he wanted to take the temperature of the president, find out, you know, were the war drums beating faster than we thought they should?\n\n>> NARRATOR: They met for dinner at the White House, just Bush, Powell and Rice.\n\n>> His essential argument got down to what he called the \"Pottery Barn rule\"-- you invade, you break it, you own it.\n\n>> He said, \"Iraq is like a piece of crystal.\n\nYou're going to shatter it, and it's going to be in pieces all over the place, and you're going to have to put it back together.\n\nAnd you're going to need help to do that.\"\n\nBush said, \"Well, what do you recommend?\n\nWhat do you think I should do?\"\n\nAnd Powell said, \"Take it to the United Nations.\n\nYou've got to go to the United Nations.\"\n\n>> There were others in the administration who didn't want to do that, fearful that it would allow Saddam Hussein off the hook if he took us up on our offer.\n\nAnd Secretary Powell was very clear with the president on that, that if inspectors were allowed back in, if Saddam Hussein did everything we wanted, this would mean no war.\n\n>> Well, Powell left the meeting feeling quite pleased with himself, feeling like he'd made points, that Bush had listened, and that he'd gained some headway.\n\nCondi Rice called him the next morning and said, \"Really good, you made your points.\n\nI think you really made an impression on the president.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: But it wouldn't last.\n\nThe vice-president was bitterly opposed to Powell's idea of a new U.N. resolution and said so.\n\n>> All of a sudden, the end of August, Cheney gets up and makes a speech in front of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\n>> Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.\n\n>> He says that there's no point in having weapons inspectors go back to Iraq because they're not going to find anything-- Saddam Hussein has lied before and he will lie again.\n\n>> Saddam has perfected the game of cheat and retreat and is very skilled in the art of denial.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Powell was furious.\n\nCheney's speech sounded like an official declaration of war.\n\n>> We will not simply look away, hope for the best, and leave the matter for some future administration to resolve.\n\n>> NARRATOR: In September 2002, the War Cabinet gathered at Camp David.\n\nThe matter of whether to ask for a new U.N. resolution still had not been settled.\n\nColin Powell was pushing hard, and now he had an ally.\n\nTony Blair joined the debate.\n\n>> Blair came to Camp David to try to nail the president down to go through the U.N., and so to announce in his speech at the opening of the U.N. General Assembly a few days later.\n\n>> When Blair went in to meet with Bush alone, Cheney was there, which sort of surprised him.\n\nThey were kind of flummoxed by the role of the vice-president.\n\n>> That finally revealed the full extent of the man's influence on the planning for Iraq.\n\nAnd from that moment onwards, we marked him and his staff very, very closely indeed.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Bush listened to Blair make his case, but then he asked for something in exchange, a pledge that if diplomacy failed, Blair would nevertheless join the U.S. in war.\n\n>> Of course, the corollary was, \"If we exhaust the U.N. process and it didn't work, you're going to be with me, aren't you, Tony, when we go to war?\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: In the end, Blair agreed to stand by the president, but some on Blair's staff believed he had just blundered badly.\n\n>> If you say to the United States, \"Whatever you choose to do, I'm with you,\" in a flash, your leverage is gone.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Powell thought he had won, but Cheney wasn't done yet.\n\nOn a visit to the office of the vice-president at the old Executive Office Building, the British ambassador met Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby.\n\n>> I went to see Scooter, and I said, \"Well, you know, what do you think of the resolution, the draft resolution?\"\n\nAnd he was absolutely plain.\n\nHe said, \"I don't... we don't think there should be another resolution at all.\n\nHow many more resolutions do you want on Iraq?\n\nWe've already had 14, 15, 16 or whatever it is, since 1991.\n\nDo we really need another resolution to demonstrate that Saddam Hussein is a bad man who should be removed?\"\n\nSo he wasn't even into discussing, and I said to him, \"What do you think of this text?\"\n\nAnd he said, \"I haven't looked at this text.\n\nWhy do I want to look at this text?\n\nThis whole thing is a waste of time.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: As Bush left for the U.N., two teams were still writing his speech.\n\nThe Defense Department took Cheney's view, State pushed Powell and Blair's position.\n\nEven on the day the president arrived at the U.N., the speech was still in flux.\n\nIf the president called for a U.N. resolution, Powell and Blair would know they had won.\n\n>> The secretary called me on his cell phone and said, \"I'm here with the president, and it's in.\n\nThe line is in the speech.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"That's wonderful news.\"\n\nThe president says, \"Who's on the phone, Colin?\"\n\nAnd he says, \"Well, it's Rich.\"\n\nAnd the president, I heard him in the background yell, \"Hey, Tiny.\"\n\nI told the Secretary, \"Tell the president good luck,\" and then I hung up and I watched the speech.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The president made the decision to ask for a resolution at the last minute, so late that the words had not been loaded into the president's teleprompter.\n\n>> My nation will work with the U.N. Security Council to meet our common challenge.\n\nIf Iraq's regime defies us again...\" >> And the president went past the place in the speech where the line had been inserted.\n\nThe president, realizing that he'd gone past it and not inserted it, then ad-libbed it, and you can tell in the speech where he did.\n\n>> We will work with the U.N. Security Council for the necessary resolutions, but the purposes of the United States should not be doubted.\n\n>> And when I picked myself up off the floor, I was mightily relieved.\n\n( applause ) >> NARRATOR: The pundits and press believed the president asking for a resolution represented a victory for Powell.\n\nThe neo-cons didn't think so.\n\n>> I think Powell wins a lot of tactical arguments because he's the one who talks to all the allies, and you've got to care about those if you're president of the United States.\n\nBut I would still say it's ultimately Powell's tactics in the service of Bush's and Cheney's and Rumsfeld's and Wolfowitz's ends.\n\n>> The whereabouts of Osama bin Laden himself remain unclear.\n\n>> Bin Laden is more than likely still alive.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Osama bin Laden had begun to send out videotapes challenging his enemies and rallying supporters.\n\n>> Information about the whereabouts of bin Laden and other al Qaeda members... >> NARRATOR: Meanwhile, hundreds of his foot soldiers captured in Afghanistan were still imprisoned in Cuba, at Gitmo.\n\nOne detainee in particular would get the treatment.\n\nHis prison ID number was 063.\n\nThe insiders called him \"the 20th hijacker.\"\n\nHis name was Mohammed al Qahtani.\n\n>> He had to urinate on himself.\n\nHe was deprived of sleep for days on end.\n\nHe was deprived of food.\n\n>> NARRATOR: They brought in a dog to terrorize him.\n\nHe was forced to wear a woman's bra and had a thong placed on his head.\n\nThey put on a dog leash and made him do animal tricks.\n\nHe was called a homosexual, and a female interrogator straddled him.\n\n>> We know now that they ended up using women interrogators to try to use sexual innuendo and touching and... to make a devout Muslim feel ashamed of himself.\n\nI remember speaking to a Pentagon official who said, you know, \"Yeah, we had to give... we gave them latitude.\"\n\nYou know, \"We wanted them to be creative.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld had been increasingly unhappy about the lack of actionable intelligence from Gitmo.\n\n>> They weren't getting any intelligence, and so it all added up to taking a lot of detainees, putting them on Guantanamo, and nothing was working right.\n\n>> The feedback that I was getting was that the information initially wasn't as valuable as it could be, and we just had to get better organized for that.\n\n>> These are among the most dangerous, best trained, vicious killers on the face of the Earth.\n\n>> He's in it daily.\n\nThey're meeting on this every day.\n\nHe's directly involved in it.\n\nHe's very hands-on.\n\nHe's not one to not make it very clear to people that he is unhappy.\n\n>> NARRATOR: There was a new facility.\n\nCamp X-Ray had given way to Camp Delta.\n\n1,400 military police and intelligence officers were handling 625 inmates.\n\n>> We were discovering that more individuals were trained to resist interrogation, that they were specifically trained how to deal with American approaches to interrogation.\n\n>> NARRATOR: So Secretary Rumsfeld authorized much tougher interrogation techniques, the harshest techniques ever authorized for use by American soldiers.\n\n>> This whole process is taking place completely in the dark, outside of the view of the American public.\n\nSo, there are several months here in which there are just extremely coercive methods being used on detainees in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nBut nobody really knew that.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Now, they could legally use isolation facilities, deprivation of light, 20-hour interrogations.\n\nThey could remove religious items and clothing; exploit detainees' individual phobias, such as the fear of dogs; stress positions, like standing for a maximum of four hours.\n\n>> One of the things he authorizes is shackling in stress positions for up to four hours a day.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Rumsfeld works at a standing desk.\n\n>> And Secretary Rumsfeld writes in his own hand, \"I stand eight to ten hours a day.\n\nWhy only four?\"\n\n>> When you read the documents, the Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, was involved very personally in approving procedures that went beyond the line of what is allowed in military law, and for that matter, in civilian law, when it comes to what can be done to prisoners.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The tough new interrogation techniques had been approved by the lawyers-- Cheney's lawyer, Addington, Bush's lawyer, Gonzalez, and the Justice Department's John Yoo.\n\n>> A delegation from the CIA and the military and a few other agencies bring in John Yoo to the White House.\n\nAnd Addington is there and Gonzales is there.\n\nAnd the question is, what are going to be the limits, legally, on interrogation in this new kind of war that the president has declared?\n\n>> It's the CIA who was asking, because they're the ones who have high-value detainees, you know, people like Abu Zubaida and... you know, who's the number-three person in al Qaeda.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The new definition of torture was so narrow that it was almost impossible to commit the crime.\n\n>> What that memo did was it defined torture down, so that the only thing that really winds up being torture is inflicting pain on someone of an order that would be equivalent to organ failure.\n\nAnd it has to be the intentional infliction of pain, because you could always argue, \"Oh, I didn't really mean for it to be so painful.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The document, known as the Bybee memo, said the president could authorize whatever techniques were necessary to fight the war on terror.\n\nThe president went looking for congressional authorization to wage war in Iraq.\n\n>> Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\n>> NARRATOR: Much of what Congress knew came from Cheney on television.\n\n>> ... Perhaps within a year of acquiring such a weapon.\n\n>> NARRATOR: To find out what the administration really knew, they brought in George Tenet.\n\n>> We had a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a closed meeting, with Director Tenet.\n\nAnd several of us ask him, \"What did the National Intelligence Estimate say about this issue?\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The National Intelligence Estimate, the NIE, is the highest-level document generated by the intelligence agencies.\n\n>> A National Intelligence Estimate becomes the truth accepted by the United States government.\n\nThey hold this thing up, the NIE, and they say, \"On page six, it says so and so, and that is an irrefutable truth.\"\n\n>> The answer that we got from Director Tenet is, \"We've never done a National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, including its weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nStunning.\n\nWe do these on almost every significant activity, much less significant than getting ready to go to war.\n\nWe were flying blind.\n\n>> The fact of the matter is, the CIA didn't want to produce one.\n\nThe White House didn't want one because they didn't want to allow any venting of whatever opposition there was to what they wanted to be the conventional wisdom on weapons of mass destruction.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And Tenet said the CIA was too busy fighting al Qaeda.\n\n>> There were a lot of things on George's plate, and he was working, you know, from sun-up to sun-down and past that, seven days a week.\n\n>> We said, \"We don't care.\n\nThis is the most important decision that we, as members of Congress, and that the people of America are likely to make in the foreseeable future.\n\nWe want to have the best understanding of what it is we're about to get involved with.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: Tenet had to provide a tough-minded analysis of the WMD allegations in a hurry.\n\nA process that ordinarily takes months or years would be reduced to just over two weeks.\n\n>> I know some of the people who did that, and it's, you know, a mind-boggling task to have to put together an NIE in that amount of time, and particularly in those kinds of very charged circumstances.\n\n>> NARRATOR: To some in the CIA, it looked like the vice-president himself was determined to control the content of the NIE.\n\nBoth Cheney and Scooter Libby had made about ten trips to CIA headquarters, where they personally questioned analysts.\n\n>> I was at the CIA for 24 years.\n\nThe only time a vice-president came to the CIA building was for a ceremony, to cut a ribbon, to stand on the stage, but not to harangue analysts about finished intelligence.\n\n>> Many, many of them have told me they were pressured.\n\nAnd there are a lot of ways.\n\nPressure takes a lot of forms.\n\n>> Questions every morning, the tasks, the requests to look into this angle one more time, turn over that rock again.\n\nIf you didn't find anything last week, look again to see if there's something there for that... about that connection.\n\n>> So you start looking very hard for anything at all that will support the answer that the vice-president wants, that the Defense Department wants.\n\n>> From NBC News in Washington, this is \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n>> Today on \"Face the Nation,\" Condoleezza Rice on Iraq and Iran and... >> From Washington, \"This Week... >> NARRATOR: The administration would also use the media to promote its case.\n\nSeptember 8, 2002, was the kickoff.\n\nIt began with a \"New York Times\" story.\n\n>> \"Iraq has sought to buy thousands of specially designed aluminum tubes, which American officials believe were intended as components of centrifuges to enrich uranium.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The source of the story had been the administration itself.\n\n>> We now know that you had people on the vice-president's staff talking to key reporters doing these stories for the \"Times.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The same day the story broke in the newspaper, the vice-president and others referenced it on television.\n\n>> ...Iraq, for instance, of aluminum tubes... >> Those stories would appear, and then they would reference the very material that they'd given them, and say, \"See, this is coming from 'The New York Times,' not just us.\"\n\n>> ...specifically aluminum tubes.\n\nThere's a story in \"The New York Times\" this morning... this is... and I want to attribute it to the \"Times\", I don't want to talk about, obviously... >> It had an echo effect.\n\nIt had an echo effect that the administration was conscious of and employed.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The allegation that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear program would become a part of the public debate.\n\n>> We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\n\n>> \"Smoking gun\" is an interesting phrase.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The media blitz, the visits by the vice-president and his chief of staff-- some in the CIA say it was all a kind of subtle arm-twisting.\n\nLater, a divided Senate commission would say that it did not constitute undue pressure.\n\nBut at the CIA, some said it did.\n\n>> Politicization, real politicization, rarely works that way.\n\nThat is to say, you know, blatant, crude, arm-twisting.\n\nIt's always far more subtle.\n\n>> NARRATOR: And so, under intense political pressure both from the Congress and the administration, the CIA developed the NIE.\n\nIn early October, Tenet delivered it.\n\nMuch of it was outdated, from the 1990s.\n\nThere were four or five new allegations-- the aluminum tubes; mobile biological, chemical and nuclear programs-- but buried inside the documents' footnotes were the State Department's doubts.\n\n>> If you read the footnotes closely, we said, \"You don't have the evidence for that.\n\nIt may be true, but if it is, there ought to be a way to show that that's the truth.\n\nAnd based on what you've shown us, we don't buy it.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: A case in point: one footnote was about uranium \"yellowcake.\"\n\n>> \"A foreign government service reported that, as of early 2001, Niger planned to send several tons of pure uranium, probably yellowcake, to Iraq.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: The State Department called it highly dubious, and so did some at the CIA.\n\n>> No one is endorsing it.\n\nEveryone is saying it really does sound implausible.\n\n>> We never took it seriously.\n\nI mean, we looked at it, but there was never any real substance to it.\n\n>> NARRATOR: But the vice-president had received a defense intelligence agency report about yellowcake.\n\n>> He said, \"This is important.\n\nThis is interesting to me.\n\nTell me about it.\"\n\n>> I was briefed that an allegation had reached the Office of the Vice President, and the Office of the Vice President had asked the CIA to look into it.\n\nI knew a lot about uranium mining.\n\nI knew a lot about Niger.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The CIA sent Wilson to Niger.\n\nHe found no evidence of a yellowcake sale and reported that to the CIA.\n\nYet, somehow, the discredited story was put in the NIE.\n\nSome at the CIA blame the vice-president.\n\n>> The CIA's assessment was sheep-herded by a national intelligence officer who works very closely with the vice-president's office.\n\nIt's a flawed... fatally flawed document, and it should never have seen the light of day.\n\n>> NARRATOR: The secret NIE was kept in a locked room where Congress could read it, but few did.\n\nGeorge Tenet had tried to walk a line between the White House and the Congress.\n\nIn the end, some thought he had harmed his own reputation.\n\n>> Well, I thought that this wasn't a man who was strong enough to stand up to the president of the United States and say, \"Mr. President, you are about to make a very serious mistake.\"\n\n>> NARRATOR: But one week later, Tenet surprised his critics by standing up to the White House.\n\nThe occasion was a presidential speech in Cincinnati.\n\n>> Ladies and gentlem"
