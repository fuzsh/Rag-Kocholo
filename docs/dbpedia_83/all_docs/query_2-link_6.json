        "text": "A few years after his controversial retirement in 2003 as chief of staff of the Army, Gen. Eric Shinseki — President-elect Barack Obama’s choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs — visited a prosthetics lab at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and called Lt. Gen. Jerry Sinn, then the Army’s top budget official, to vent.\n\n“We need to take a look at how we’re funding this facility,” Sinn recalled Shinseki saying as he criticized the technology available to soldiers who had lost limbs in combat. “What we’re doing here now is almost medieval.”\n\nIf confirmed, Shinseki, who lost part of his right foot in the Vietnam War and earned two Purple Hearts, will have a prime opportunity to address his concerns at the vast agency that handles health care for servicemen and women after they leave the military.\n\nChanging the VA’s health care system during a crushing economic crisis will be nearly insurmountable, said Shad Meshad, president of the National Veterans Foundation, which fields hundreds of calls a day from frustrated veterans about the waits caused by an 850,000-case backlog.\n\nAn additional challenge for Shinseki may be facing a culture that is quite different from the military.\n\n“The instinct in the Army is to always support the chief,” said Page Hoeper, the Army’s top weapons buyer under Shinseki. “That’s not going to be the case at the VA.”\n\nBut Hoeper and others described Shinseki as a quiet visionary who is a master at working the government bureaucracy and whose controversial, against-the-grain remark before Congress that “several hundred thousand” U.S. troops would be needed to secure Iraq has been validated.\n\nThough he resigned on schedule in 2003, Shinseki’s candid troop comments earned him a public rebuke from then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. But he became a folk hero for speaking his mind to the powers that be.\n\nLike Obama, Shinseki grew up in Hawaii. He rose to become the nation’s first Japanese-American four-star general. President Bill Clinton named Shinseki the Army’s top general. While in that post, he launched programs to rebuild an Army that many considered stuck in the past.\n\nShinseki’s views on Iraq were not the only ones at odds with the Bush administration. He also butted heads with the White House over the size of the Army, how it should be organized and the fate of weapons systems.\n\nShinseki summed up his philosophy of leadership in his 2003 Army farewell speech: “You must love those you lead before you can be an effective leader. You can certainly command without that sense of commitment, but you cannot lead without it.”"
