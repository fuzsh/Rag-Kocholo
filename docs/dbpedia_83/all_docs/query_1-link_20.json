        "text": "THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\n\nJanuary 8, 2013\n\nGuest:\n\nRACHEL MADDOW, HOST: Good evening, Ed. A spectacular show tonight.\n\nSCHULTZ: Thank you.\n\nMADDOW: Thanks.\n\nThanks to you at home --\n\nSCHULTZ: You have them every night. I`m just trying to get there.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMADDOW: You have very kind.\n\nAll right. Thanks to you at home as well for joining us this hour.\n\nThis is Eric Shinseki. Eric Shinseki went to West Point. He\n\ngraduated June 1965. Before that year was out, by December of that same\n\nyear, Second Lieutenant Eric Shinseki was on the ground in Vietnam. He was\n\non a one-year combat tour, but he did not make to it the end of that combat\n\ntour before he got shipped home.\n\nThe first time he was wounded was in April. He had gotten there in\n\nDecember. By April, he was wounded for the first time. Shrapnel from a\n\nmortar round hit him in the shoulder and in the chest. Those injuries not\n\nsevere enough to have him flown out of Vietnam yet. He stayed on after\n\nearning that first Purple Heart.\n\nThen, it was not until five months later in September of that year\n\nthat he got wounded again. And this time it was bad enough for them to\n\nhave to send him home. He was in a helicopter crash. It left him with a\n\nbroken jaw and a broken arm. That`s on top of the shrapnel he had already\n\ntaken in the shoulder and in the chest.\n\nThey flew him home to Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii to\n\nrecuperate. That was in 1966. By 1970, he was on his way back to the war.\n\nHe volunteered for another combat tour in Vietnam, despite his earlier\n\ninjuries. When he went back in 1970, he ended up stepping on a land mine\n\nthat blew off part of his right foot.\n\nThe Army wanted Eric Shinseki to retire at that point, but he\n\nrefused. Before he was done in Vietnam, Eric Shinseki would earn two\n\nPurple Hearts and three Bronze Stars.\n\nThis is John Kerry, who started his service in Vietnam on board this\n\nrather large ship. It`s a guided missile cruiser called the USS Gridley.\n\nHe then applied to transfer from the Gridley to a much tinier ship. He\n\napplied to transfer to duty on one of these little patrol boats.\n\nThat form of duty started for him in mid-November 1968. By the start\n\nof December, he had been awarded his first Purple Heart. By mid-February,\n\nhe had been awarded his second Purple Heart. By the end of February, he\n\nwas involved in a river battle for which he was awarded the Silver Star.\n\nLess than two weeks after that, it was another river battle for which he\n\nwas awarded the Bronze Star and his third Purple Heart.\n\nThis man is Chuck Hagel. Chuck Hagel enlisted in the army in 1967.\n\nHe was a sergeant in the infantry. In 1968 -- and this is an anomaly.\n\nThis is not true of very many other people, if any other people at all.\n\nChuck Hagel served in the same small patrol in the infantry as his brother.\n\nHe was 21 at the time. His brother Tom was 19.\n\nIn March 1968, Sergeant Hagel was on patrol when he was hit by\n\nshrapnel from a mine. He still carries some of that shrapnel in his chest\n\ntoday.\n\nBut that day in 1968, it was his younger brother Tom who tore his\n\nshirt open and wrapped the bandages around Chuck Hagel`s chest to stop the\n\nbleeding. His brother saved him. His younger brother Tom had also been\n\nhit by shrapnel in that same attack.\n\nThe two brothers spent time together recovering in a field hospital\n\nafter that incident. They didn`t stay in the hospital long, though,\n\nbecause the following month, in April 1968, the two of them were back out\n\ntogether. They were riding in the same armored personnel carrier when it\n\nalso was hit by a mine in an ambush.\n\nQuoting from the book \"Long Time Passing\" here, \"Chuck -- instantly\n\naflame, his left side burning, his face a mass of bubbles, concussed with\n\nblood running from his ears, frantically tugged and pull turret gunner out\n\nof his steel cage death trap. Quote, `With all the ammunition we had, it\n\nwould just blow,` remembers Chuck.\"\n\nNow, the turret gunner who he`s trying to pull off that armored\n\npersonnel carrier was his younger brother.\n\nHe says, \"I grabbed Tom and he was dead weight, blood pouring out of\n\nhis ears. I thought for sure he was dead.\"\n\n\"Chuck shoved Tom off of the APC and then fell on top of him to\n\nprotect him as the Vietcong opened fire. Flames from the burning vehicle\n\nshielded him until the trucks up front turned back to save them.\"\n\nChuck Hagel, of course, went on to become a Republican senator from\n\nNebraska. He is now President Obama`s nominee to be secretary of defense.\n\nJohn Kerry, of course, went on to become a Democratic senator from\n\nMassachusetts. He is now President Obama`s nominee to be secretary of\n\nstate.\n\nEric Shinseki went on to become an Army lifer. He went on to become\n\na four-star general. He was appointed secretary of Veterans Affairs by\n\nPresident Obama, in President Obama`s first term. General Shinseki is\n\nexpected to stay on at Veterans Affairs in the second term.\n\nIf Senator Kerry and Senator Hagel are confirmed in the two positions\n\nfor which they are nominated, which especially in the case of Senator Hagel\n\nis no sure bet, but if they are all confirm, this will be the first time\n\nthat there are three Vietnam combat veterans in the cabinet.\n\nThe expiration of Vietnam as an American political issue -- and the\n\nexpiration of the issue of Vietnam service for American political leaders,\n\nthat expiration date has been prematurely proclaimed for decades now.\n\nWhen Bill Clinton in 1992 won the presidency, despite having not\n\nserved in Vietnam, and his opponents trying to use that against him, it was\n\nsaid at the time that the Vietnam era in American politics was finally\n\nover. That, of course, came as news 12 years later when George W. Bush was\n\nrunning against John Kerry in his reelection effort, and it was clear that\n\nthe Vietnam era was definitely not over.\n\nIn 2008, when we had a Vietnam prisoner of war hero running against a\n\nDemocrat who was too young to have served in Vietnam, even if he had wanted\n\nto, we once again heard that the era of Vietnam and Vietnam`s relationship\n\nto American political leadership was something that was over.\n\nHey, it`s not over. And we shouldn`t expect it to be over. And\n\nthat`s important right now for two reasons. The first reason is specific\n\nto Vietnam. The first reason is about the unfinished business from that\n\nera, which for a president who was too young to have served in that war,\n\nnevertheless seems to be very close to his heart.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So here today it must\n\nbe said, you have earned your place among the greatest generations. At\n\nthis time I would ask all our Vietnam veterans, those of you who can stand\n\nto please stand. All those already standing, raise your hands as we say\n\nthose simple words which always greet our troops when they come home from\n\nhere on out -- welcome home!\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWelcome home! Welcome home! Thank you! We appreciate you. Welcome\n\nhome.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: President Obama speaking to Vietnam veterans last May. The\n\npresident there reflecting on the fact that it took this country more than\n\na decade to finally say welcome home to Vietnam veterans after they came\n\nhome from serving in that war.\n\nLack of respect and appreciation shown to Vietnam veterans by\n\ncivilians during the war and after that war is a mistake that the country I\n\nthink now is fairly unified in trying not to repeat.\n\nBut Vietnam is not so far in the past, though, that you can just fix\n\nthat problem by promising never to do it again and by promising to do it\n\nbetter the next time. We`ve got long and unpopular wars under way like we\n\ndo now.\n\nIt is also a contemporaneous sign of respect for Vietnam service,\n\nthat veterans of that war are holding positions of leadership, and that\n\ntheir combat experience is being heralded as part of what makes them\n\nqualified as leaders and trustworthy as public servants. It`s not just\n\nabout not making that mistake again, it`s about trying to rectify that\n\nmistake that stands in the lives of these people who lived through it,\n\nright?\n\nBut the second reason -- this is a really interesting dynamic right\n\nnow in our politics -- is that having an unprecedented number of Vietnam\n\ncombat veterans in the cabinet, again, if these two nominations do get\n\nconfirmed. One of the interesting things about it is not just what\n\nhappened back then and the treatment of Vietnam veterans after they came\n\nhome, but about what is happening right now in Washington.\n\nToday on a conference call with reporters, the White House deputy\n\nnational security adviser Ben Rhodes said for the first time that at the\n\nend of next year, the number of troops that we might be dropping down to in\n\nAfghanistan might very well be zero.\n\nQuoting from an \"Associated Press\" account, \"Asked in a conference\n\ncall with reporters whether zero troops in Afghanistan was now an option,\n\nRhodes said, `That would be an option we would consider.`\"\n\nThe 66,000 Americans in Afghanistan right now, the White House, this\n\nnew administration is currently preparing to negotiate with the Afghan\n\nPresident Hamid Karzai. And among itself, right, decide internally, not\n\nonly how many Americans might be in Afghanistan on some indefinite\n\ntimetable after the end of the war at the end of next year, but\n\nimportantly, how many Americans are going to be there fighting between now\n\nand then. In other words, how big is this war going to continue to be?\n\nAfter Osama bin Laden was killed last May, Chuck Hagel, who might\n\nvery well be the next secretary of defense, Chuck Hagel told his hometown\n\nnewspaper in Nebraska that he thought the killing of bin Laden meant that\n\nit was time to head for the exits in Afghanistan.\n\nChuck Hagel said also four months after that, in the fall of 2011, he\n\nsaid that the Defense Department is, quote, \"bloated.\" He said the\n\nPentagon needs to be pared down.\n\nSenator Hagel also endorsed a report by the group Global Zero that\n\ncalled for cutting the U.S. weapons arsenal by 80 percent. The overall\n\ngoal of Global Zero, as its name implies, Global Zero, is global zero\n\nnuclear weapons. But this 80 percent cut in our arsenal is a way to get\n\nthere is something that Chuck Hagel has supported.\n\nWhat`s the new face of the American military going to be after the\n\nend of the longest war in American history, which is Afghanistan?\n\nThe second longest war in American history is Vietnam. To have three\n\nVietnam veterans in the cabinet running veterans, running state, running\n\ndefense is a remarkable milestone for veterans of that war, just as a\n\npopulation group, and one that didn`t necessarily get treated right by this\n\ncountry when their time at war ended.\n\nBut for all of us, for all of us, no matter how old we are -- for all\n\nof us, whether or not we had any connection to the Vietnam politics the\n\nfirst time around, for all of us, there is the question now of whether the\n\npresident`s decision to turn to these three Vietnam combat veterans for\n\nthese big, important, big ticket national security posts at this time in\n\nMr. Obama`s presidency -- does that tell us something about what this\n\npresident wants in terms of policy, and what he thinks are the right\n\nlessons from our previous lives during wartime, for this particular life\n\nduring wartime that we are all in together?\n\nJoining us now is Colonel Jack Jacobs. He is an MSNBC military\n\nanalyst. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his service in Vietnam.\n\nColonel Jacobs, thanks for being here.\n\nCOLONEL JACK JACOBS, MSNBC MILITARY ANALYST: Thanks for having me.\n\nMADDOW: So, there is two questions here there is the policy question\n\nwhich I want to get to. But there is also this question of whether a\n\ncabinet with three wounded Vietnam veterans in it, is it important\n\nmilestone to veterans themselves? Is it significant together?\n\nJACOBS: I think it is important to veterans. I`m not a fan of\n\nsingle factor analysis. So, there are lots and lots of things going on\n\nhere.\n\nPart of it is a veneer. There is a certain amount of public\n\nrelations involved in having three combat veterans from that era, from my\n\nera now in positions of tremendous authority and responsibility, working\n\nfor a president who, as you said, was too young to go into the service even\n\nif he wanted. So there is a bit of public relations here.\n\nThe second thing that`s of significance is that there is a huge bulge\n\nin the American population among my age group, Shinseki`s age group,\n\nHagel`s age group, an enormous bulge. Lots and lots of people are of our\n\nage, and larger than our percentage, this percentage of us in the country\n\nimplies. And I think that`s significant, too, having these people in\n\npositions of great authority.\n\nMADDOW: So they`re at the age when they should be getting the\n\nbiggest jobs?\n\nJACOBS: That`s right. They`re 70 years old and they should be\n\ngetting the biggest jobs. As a matter of fact, I`ll tell you, and maybe a\n\nlot of people, including you, would argue, it`s long overdue.\n\nI think people with that kind of responsibility and authority and\n\ncapability of doing that kind of job have been ignored for a long, long\n\ntime in favor of other people who did not serve, and at least partially\n\nbecause they served.\n\nWe had a very different view of service back then. I think all the\n\ntime about how we think about people who are currently serving in the armed\n\nforces. We love the troops. We adore the troops. Everybody loves them.\n\nOne of the reasons we love the troops, because we don`t have to be\n\nthe troops.\n\nMADDOW: Right.\n\nJACOBS: We have no draft.\n\nAnd when I was in the army, when I first came into the Army, there\n\nwas a draft. We were fighting an unpopular war then. We fought in the all\n\nvolunteer era, two and a half unpopular wars.\n\nTrust me, if we had a draft during that period of time, there would\n\nbe riots in the streets, same as there was during Vietnam. And we`ve had\n\nthe luxury of being able to operate without a draft. And as a result we\n\nfeel very much differently about people who served than we did when these\n\nthree men were young and serving.\n\nSo, a lot of it has to do with the change in politics and how we do\n\nbusiness.\n\nMADDOW: The reason we don`t have a draft is after Vietnam when the\n\nArmy restructured itself, (INAUDIBLE), that the Army decided you know what?\n\nHaving a draft is not in our interest in terms of the kind of professional\n\nforce we want to be after this very long war.\n\nAnd it certainly keeps coming up as a political issue. But it`s not\n\nnecessarily something that the military has favored. I have always been\n\nstruck by what the long-term political and security consequences were of\n\nthat decision that was made in the defense context after that long war.\n\nDo you feel like there are other really important decisions like that\n\nthat are going to have to be made by the secretary of defense as\n\nAfghanistan ends?\n\nJACOBS: Well, yes. And I think that the idea that we`re actually\n\ngoing to go down to zero or near zero, I think that`s accurate. I think\n\nthat`s what the president wants. I think that`s what the Congress wants to\n\ndo. There is a lot of money that has to be saved and so on.\n\nAnd we frankly don`t have the people to scatter around the world of\n\nthe country, 310 million, 320 million people trying to defend it with a\n\nvery small number of people we can`t have a significant numbers of them in\n\na place like Afghanistan.\n\nNow, this argument is strenuously not that we`re spread too thinly,\n\nbut that we have an insufficient number of people in order to satisfy the\n\nrequirements that we have of a country like ours that has worldwide\n\nobligations. And that goes back to the whole question, the draft and\n\nwhether or not we`ve got enough people. And how do we get them in an\n\nenvironment in which nobody wants to serve and we have a hard time making\n\nnational security decisions about what to do and make them honestly and\n\nintelligently.\n\nWe`ve had a pretty lousy record of making intelligent decisions about\n\nnational security in the last few years.\n\nMADDOW: I just think it`s fascinating that we`re now in a position\n\nwhere we need to be transitioning from being a military that is making all\n\nof its decisions about dwell time and how much time you got between\n\ndeployments and who is going to deploy where and when to instead thinking\n\nabout a mill they`re is not at war, that needs to decide what its strength\n\nis going to be, what its training requirements are going to be, what its\n\nweapons systems are going to be. And the last time we did this really was\n\nafter Vietnam and we`ve got all these Vietnam guys.\n\nJACOBS: You`re absolutely right. If you talk to a guy like Marty\n\nDempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and you get him against the\n\ncorner and we`re inside the cone of silence and he`ll tell you honestly\n\nwhat he believes, he will tell you that one of the major tasks of the\n\nmilitary establishment today is figure out how it fits in this national\n\nsecurity environment.\n\nMADDOW: Yes.\n\nJACOBS: When you have very few people, you have precision guided\n\nmunitions, you have responsibilities around the world, you have threats\n\nthat you haven`t figured how to satisfy, it`s a really big problem.\n\nAnd Hagel`s got a lot on his plate. I`m not certain that he is\n\nnecessarily the guy to do it, but I do think he is going to get confirmed.\n\nMADDOW: I think the confirmation hearings are going to be\n\nfascinating for this reason and for a million others.\n\nAll right. Colonel Jack Jacobs, Medal of Honor recipient, MSNBC\n\nmilitary analyst, it is always an honor to have you, sir.\n\nJACOBS: Thanks for having me on the program. I appreciate it.\n\nMADDOW: Appreciate it.\n\nAll right. We got a best new thing in the world on tap. We`ve got\n\nthe first clarion call from new Senator Elizabeth Warren today on Capitol\n\nHill. This is a big news today. There`s lots ahead.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: Richard Mourdock wanted very badly to become a member of the\n\nUnited States Senate. He beat out longtime incumbent Indiana Republican\n\nSenator Dick Lugar to become the Republican Senate nominee in Indiana. He\n\ngot himself a Democratic opponent that everybody seemed to think that he\n\nwould beat handily.\n\nAnd then Richard Mourdock said this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRICHARD MOURDOCK (R-IN), FORMER SENATE CANDIDATE: Life is that gift\n\nfrom god, and I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of\n\nrape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: If you become pregnant from being raped, that is something\n\nGod intended to happen. That was sort of the end of Richard Mourdock. He\n\nwent on the lose a Senate race that he really should have one. And now,\n\nthe new senator from Indiana is a Democrat, Joe Donnelly.\n\nRichard Mourdock`s view that the government should force rape victims\n\nto give birth to their rapist child because God intervenes not to stop\n\nrapes, but to make sure that certain rapes resulted in force impregnating\n\nof the rape victim, that particular phantasmagoric bio theology was in the\n\nend too much for the residents of Indiana to accept.\n\nThere was also Todd Akin. Todd Akin was a Republican from the great\n\nstate of Missouri who was chosen by Republicans in his state to take on\n\nDemocratic incumbent Senator Claire McCaskill. Claire McCaskill was\n\nthought to be sort of easy picks for Republicans this past year. They\n\nthought that was a seat for sure they could pick up. They picked\n\nRepublican congressman Todd Akin to go up against her.\n\nAnd then, and then, Todd Akin said this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTODD AKIN (R), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: If it`s a legitimate rape,\n\nthe female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: If it`s a legitimate rape, as opposed to all those\n\nillegitimate rapes, the female body can prevent a pregnancy from happening.\n\nTake it from me, Todd Akin. And that was pretty much the end of old Todd\n\nAkin.\n\nClaire McCaskill went on the trounce him and held on to a seat that\n\nDemocrats had all but accept they`d were going to lose in Missouri. Todd\n\nAkin`s view that you can`t get pregnant from a legitimate rape, and\n\ntherefore if you do get pregnant, you obviously wanted it, so the\n\ngovernment should force all victims of illegitimate rape to give birth to\n\ntheir illegitimate rapist child, in the end that also did not fly with the\n\nresidents of Missouri.\n\nThe thing about Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock, though, is that they\n\nwere not alone in the Republican Party in holding these views. The vice\n\npresidential nominee of the Republican Party in fact shared their policy\n\nviews of what the federal government should force rape victims to do. The\n\ngovernment should monitor the pregnancies of rape victims to force them to\n\nmake sure that those pregnancies have the government`s chosen outcome, even\n\nif it is against the rape victim`s will.\n\nPart of the way that the White House was able to stack up an 11-point\n\nlead among women voters nationwide and thereby beat Mitt Romney and Paul\n\nRyan in the race for the White House was by making a very big deal about\n\ninsensitive and alienating comments like these and policy positions like\n\nthese from Republican politicians famous and infamous. And that is one of\n\nthe reasons that it is of great political awkwardness right now, that the\n\nlatest high profile cabinet nominee from President Obama is somebody who\n\nholds distinctly Akin and Mourdock-esque positions on this particular\n\nissue.\n\nToday, Andrew Kaczynski at the Web site BuzzFeed on defense secretary\n\nnominee Chuck Hagel`s record on the issue of abortion form when he was a\n\nmember of the U.S. Senate. As a Senate candidate back in 1996, Chuck Hagel\n\nsaid he, quote, \"tightened his position on abortion after he discovered\n\nthat abortion in cases of rape and incest are, quote, `rare`.\" Well, it\n\nnever happens, so therefore we should ban it.\n\nEven in the rare cases where a woman gets pregnant as a result of\n\nrape, she should be forced by the government to give birth to that child,\n\nso says Chuck Hagel.\n\nIn terms of the exceptions that the law allows for cases involving\n\nrape or incest, Chuck Hagel offered this, quote, \"I don`t think those two\n\nexceptions are relevant.\"\n\nChuck Hagel is currently up for job of defense secretary, right? He\n\nis not up for secretary of women`s health. We generally think of the\n\nsecretary of defense job adds being the kind of job that is uninflected by\n\nsocial conservative hot button political issues.\n\nI mean, running the Pentagon is about troop deployments and training\n\nregimens and weapons procurement and strategic thing about things like\n\nintercontinental ballistic missiles, right? It`s generally about guns.\n\nBut we don`t think about it having to do with God and gays, except it\n\nreally kind of does.\n\nThe last two things that President Obama signed into law at the New\n\nYear were the fiscal cliff thing and the Pentagon bill. And the Pentagon\n\nfunding bill includes a big new hard-fought provision over whether women\n\nwho are in the military who are raped can have access to abortion. This is\n\na live policy issue being debated and hanged as a matter of policy right\n\nnow. In the defense bill that was just signed by President Obama, female\n\ntroops can now receive medical coverage for abortions that are the result\n\nof rape.\n\nThat is a change in policy. That is brand-new. Previously, the only\n\nabortions that were covered for our military servicewomen were in cases\n\nwhere her life was in danger. Not anymore.\n\nAnd this is a huge deal in the U.S. military, because it turns out\n\nthis is a huge problem in the U.S. military. In 2011, a little more than\n\n2,000 cases of sexual assault were reported by female service members. The\n\nactual number when you include cases that go unreported is estimated by the\n\nPentagon to be more like 19,000 -- 19,000 cases of rape and sexual assault\n\nin the military every year. And now, these women will have access to\n\nabortion under their insurance coverage in the military.\n\nThe current Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has made rape and sexual\n\nassault one of his major issues as defense secretary. Last year, he told\n\nNBC News, quote, \"This is an issue that I as secretary of defense am\n\ncommitted to making sure we confront.\"\n\nWhere does defense secretary nominee Chuck Hagel stand on this issue\n\nthat Leon Panetta thinks is so important? As a senator, Hagel repeatedly\n\nvoted against amendments to allow servicewomen even to pay for abortion\n\nservices at military hospitals out of their own pockets.\n\nSo not only will your insurance not be allowed to cover it, according\n\nto Chuck Hagel, you shouldn`t even have access to it in military hospitals.\n\nWhat, go find a local service provider, deployed servicewoman?\n\nSo, again, on the surface, a nominee`s sensitivity and politics on\n\nissues like sexual assault and abortion would seem quite irrelevant to a\n\njob like secretary of defense. But it is right in the middle of the kinds\n\nof things the secretary of defense has to deal with now -- so too the issue\n\nof respect for gay people.\n\nPart of the consternation over Chuck Hagel`s anti-gay comments about\n\nan ambassadorial nominee in 1998 was because he made very overt anti-gay\n\ncomments about somebody as late as 1998. But part of the consternation as\n\nvoiced by OutServe, the group that currently represents serving LGBT\n\nmembers of the military, is that whoever the next secretary of defense is,\n\nthat person is going to be the first one taking office after the full\n\nrepeal of \"don`t ask, don`t tell.\" And there is very live, very sensitive\n\nvery contested policy decisions that have to be made about how openly guy\n\nservice members are going to be allowed to serve.\n\nAnd specifically, how their family members are or are not going to be\n\nrecognized by a Defense Department that recognizes the family members of\n\nstraight service members.\n\nIf the Defense of Marriage Act fails at the Supreme Court, for\n\nexample, yes, that`s going to affect whether there are same-sex marriage\n\nrights in various states all around the country, right? But one of the\n\nvery first things it`s going to affect is day to day life for members of\n\nthe military there is a whole list of very specific things that other\n\nfamily members get in the military that family members of gay service\n\nmembers right now are banned from getting specifically because of the\n\nDefense of Marriage Act.\n\nSo if the Supreme Court strikes down the Defense of Marriage Act\n\nthat`s banning these policies, it may very well be Chuck Hagel deciding the\n\nvery sensitive issue of whether a gay service member`s family gets this\n\nkind of equal treatment that he or she would never have had before.\n\nSo Chuck Hagel`s position on gay rights, which on the surface would\n\nseem totally irrelevant to a job running the military, actually could not\n\nbe more central to the most sensitive things that he might have to make a\n\ndecision on personally right away if he gets this gig.\n\nI`m telling you, these confirmation hearings are going to be amazing.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: There is a place in California called Dana Point. It`s a\n\nvery, very pretty part of that state, and there is a very swanky resort\n\nthere called the St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort. See what, with the fancy\n\ngolf course? It`s very fancy, very pricey.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, the St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort was chosen as\n\nthe executive retreat for the top execs at a ginormous insurance company\n\ncalled AIG. Remember AIG?\n\nIn the process of just about sinking the American economy with its\n\nexponentially risky behavior, AIG also just about sunk itself. And as part\n\nof trying to save the economy, AIG got a mammoth bailout from U.S.\n\ntaxpayers. Eighty-five billion dollars into that bailout, it was revealed\n\nthat AIG spent more than $440,000 on this retreat at the golf place, its\n\nreward for executives who had sunk the largest economy on earth, 23 large\n\non spa treatments alone. Yes, cue the justifiable national outrage.\n\nWell, today there were headlines about AIG that brought all that old\n\noutrage right back to the surface. Today, AIG got back into the headlines\n\nfor something that had people rummaging around in the attic, looking for\n\nthe old torches and pitchforks that they hadn`t used in the streets since\n\nthe last time a story like this broke about AIG back in 2008.\n\nThe difference today is that today, there was a brand-newly minted\n\nUnited States senator on Capitol Hill enunciating our national disgust for\n\nthat company in a way that was not only satisfying, but powerful. Can you\n\nguess which new senator I`m talking about? Would it help if I told you her\n\ninitials were Elizabeth Warren? That`s coming up.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: It was two years ago today that then-Congresswoman Gabrielle\n\nGiffords was shot and very nearly killed outside a grocery store at a Meet\n\nYour Congresswoman event in Tucson, Arizona. Today, on the two-year\n\nanniversary of the assassination attempt that nearly did kill her and that\n\ndid kill six other people and that wounded 12 other people, today, Gabby\n\nGiffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, launched a new political\n\naction committee. It`s called Americans for Responsible Solutions.\n\nThey say their goal is to, quote, \"encourage elected officials to\n\nstand up for solutions that will prevent gun violence.\" It`s a new\n\npolitical pressure group, in other words.\n\nCongresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband launched this today in a\n\nhigh profile well done media blitz. They sat through a moving interview\n\nwith Diane Sawyer. They published a joint op-ed in \"USA Today\", where they\n\ndemanded change from Washington. But they also pointed to their own unique\n\nrole in this fight, not just with the former congresswoman as a victim of\n\ngun violence, but with her having been a member of Congress who was a\n\nstaunch supporter of the Second Amendment.\n\nGabby Giffords was a very pro-gun rights Democratic member of\n\nCongress. She and her husband are not commie, liberal, pinkos coming to\n\nconfiscate yours guns. They are both gun owners themselves.\n\nThey said today in the op-ed, quote, \"Forget the boogie man of big\n\nbad government coming to dispose you of your firearms. As a Western woman\n\nand Persian Gulf War combat veteran who have exercised her Second Amendment\n\nrights, we do not want to take away your guns any more than we want to give\n\nup the two guns that we have locked in safe at home. What we do want is\n\nwhat the majority of NRA members and other Americans want, responsible\n\nchanges in our laws to require responsible gun ownership and reduce gun\n\nviolence.\"\n\nTaking the argument beyond gun owners versus non-gun owner, taking\n\nthe argument beyond absolutist gun anarchy versus a complete gun ban, this\n\nturn away from that kind of binary nonsense is the kind of turn in the\n\nconversation that typically signifies that there might be movement ahead,\n\nthat people are getting real about maybe actually getting something done.\n\nAt the same time on the same day, on the same anniversary, another\n\noverture today from Roxanna Green. She`s the mother of 9-year-old\n\nChristina Taylor Green who was killed in the Tucson shooting two years ago.\n\nShe appears in an ad that appeared in seven cities today including\n\nWashington, D.C., and in Tucson.\n\nThis ad which I`m going to show you in a second, it`s paid for by the\n\nMayors Against Illegal Guns group, which is co-chaired by New York City\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nBut the thing about it that I find striking about it is that it is\n\nnot just an issue ad to try to get people riled up or even just to get\n\npeople thinking about this as an issue area, as a subject, this is a\n\ncampaign ad.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROXANNA GREEN, TUCSON, AZ: Twenty heartbroken families lost a child\n\nin the Sandy Hook School shooting. I know how much it hurts. My 9-year-\n\nold daughter was murdered in the Tucson shooting.\n\nI have one question for our political leaders. When will you find\n\nthe courage to stand up to the gun lobby? Whose child has to die next?\n\nTo every mother, we cannot wait. We have to demand a plan.\n\nGo to demandaplan.org and add your name.\n\nANNOUNCER: Mayors Against Illegal Guns Action Fund is responsible\n\nfor the content in this advertising.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: We have to demand a plan, concrete action. That message\n\ntoday from the mother of the youngest victim of the Tucson mass shooting,\n\nwhich was two years ago today.\n\nThis is kind of an amazing detail about this. That ad was scheduled\n\nto air today in Tucson at precisely 10:10 local time, to coincide exactly\n\nwith the exact time that the shooter in that incident opened fire two years\n\nago.\n\nThis is serious political pressure. This is not just about raising\n\nawareness or something, or seeking donations for groups that will work on\n\nthis in a generic way. This is about using awareness and concern that\n\nreally already exists to make some kind of concrete public policy change in\n\nthe short-term.\n\nPresident Obama last month tapped Vice President Biden to lead an\n\neffort to put together national proposals for public policy reforms that\n\ncould curb mass violence in the United States, including potentially\n\nreforming gun laws and regulations.\n\nAnd this week, the vice president is getting started. Tomorrow, he\n\nwill meet with gun control groups and groups for victims of gun violence.\n\nBut then the next day, on Thursday, he is going to be meeting with gun\n\nowners groups, including the National Rifle Association.\n\nAnd that one detail about the NRA being invited to meet with the vice\n\npresident and RSVP-ing that they would attend the meeting, that is sucking\n\nup all of the Beltway`s attention on this effort so far. It`s not\n\nsurprising given that the NRA has already offered that their solution to\n\nthe gun violence problem in this country is more guns in more places where\n\nwe don`t have them already. And that is not really where we expect the\n\nWhite House effort to be headed.\n\nBut what is more interesting this time, what is more interesting\n\nabout this effort is how many other people besides the NRA are at the table\n\nwith some political weight behind them. The kind of political capital that\n\nthey have and are bringing to bear to compete with the gun lobby whose\n\npolitical power has long been feared, but who this year, frankly, has\n\ndevolved into a nationally reviled political punch line.\n\nJoining us now is my pal Steve Schmidt. He is a Republican political\n\nstrategist, senior strategist from the McCain/Palin ticket in `08, and an\n\nMSNBC contributor.\n\nSteve, thank you for being here. It`s nice to see you.\n\nSTEVE SCHMIDT, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Good to see you, Rachel. Happy\n\nNew Year.\n\nMADDOW: You too.\n\nI know you are a supporter of gun rights, Steve. I know you are also\n\na political realist.\n\nHow do you assess the strength of the effort to try to come up with\n\nsome form of reform agenda after Newtown and after Tucson?\n\nSCHMIDT: Look, I think that the ad that you showed is obviously\n\nenormously compelling. It`s emotional. The whole country was traumatized\n\nby this unspeakable tragedy that took place in Newtown, and the tragedies\n\nthat took place before it. And sadly, the tragedies that are going to take\n\nplace next. And we don`t know where those will be.\n\nBut the NRA is a fearsome political lobby. Members particularly in\n\nthe Republican Party are terrified of being primaried. This issue is often\n\ncovered through a partisan prism when it should be looked at through a\n\nregional prism.\n\nIf you talk about Democrats in the South, in the Mountain West, and\n\nplaces like North Dakota, and you saw the new Senator Heidi Heitkamp come\n\nout and say that she thinks that some of the proposals that are coming out,\n\nat least preliminary out of the White House are way too extreme for her.\n\nSo, you`ll have Republican senators like Mark Kirk in Illinois who have\n\nbeen open in the past on issues like assault weapons bans, and you`ll have\n\nDemocrats in the West, the Mountain West and the rural South that will be\n\nabsolutely opposed to it.\n\nAnd as you said earlier, though it is nonsense, and I`m certainly a\n\nperson who believes that you can be a Second Amendment supporter, and also\n\nhave sensible regulations on guns, but this issue plays out on the\n\nextremes, on the absurd binary choice that has defined the issue for so\n\nlong.\n\nMADDOW: And that -- and that analysis, what you said there at the\n\nend, that we`ve spent so much time fighting about extreme positions that\n\nnobody is actually trying to advance, that we`ve left the -- we`ve left the\n\nwhole middle ground of responsible, reasonable, respectful reform\n\nessentially untilled politically, that argument which you`re getting from\n\npeople like Gabby Giffords, which you`re getting in some cases from other\n\nvictims, gun violence victims groups, I think potentially is new grounds.\n\nLet me give you a hypothetical. Let`s pick a hypothetical reform\n\nthat even a pro-gun rights Republican like you might see as wise and\n\ncompatible of the Second Amendment. Something like strengthening the\n\nbackground check system so nobody can buy a gun if they`re on the terrorist\n\nwatch list, right?\n\nIf you hypothetically wanted to put together a political effort to\n\ntry to get just something narrow like that passed, how would you do it?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, you`d have to obviously put together a bipartisan\n\ncoalition of Republicans and Democrats. And it would be made up of the\n\nmiddle ideologically of the Congress. But it would also be\n\ndisproportionately heavy Republican in the Northeast. Democrats obviously\n\nin the Northeast and urban areas will have one sensibility.\n\nYou know, it is a -- it is a very tough issue. It`s an issue where\n\non something like this, the chances of it being -- even something that is\n\ncommon sense as that, making it all the way through the process and having\n\nit be presented to the president as cleanly as you said, I think is a very\n\ndifficult thing to envision, as absurd as that sounds.\n\nBecause the -- on the right, you have people who say that any type of\n\nregulation, any attempt to regulate is a step towards confiscation. And\n\nthen on the left, you have, for example, the Gawker Web site today\n\npublishing the names of all the gun owners in New York. And actions like\n\nthat seem to a lot of people evidence of the confiscation argument.\n\nSo, it`s a -- it`s a discussion that is held captive by the extremes\n\non both sides. And it`s an issue where when members of Congress get ready\n\nfor elections, they know the NRA is potent, that it`s been potent in the\n\npast.\n\nAnd the NRA is organized for the long haul on this fight. These\n\nother groups that there might be new energy behind it, there might be new\n\npassion behind it, but they don`t have the resources that the NRA does.\n\nAnd it will be interesting to see over the next six months to a year\n\nare they able to build resources? Are they able to project political\n\npower, are they able to take this issue and to beat people on the wrong\n\nside of the issue in swing districts? And until they do that, it`s going\n\nto be tough to move forward.\n\nMADDOW: Seeing them try to move all the political capital they`ve\n\ngot right now, all the sort of aspirational capital they have right now\n\ninto really resource-driven political muscle I think is going to be the\n\nreal test here, too.\n\nSteve Schmidt, former McCain/Palin senior strategist, MSNBC\n\ncontributor, I miss seeing you. I`m looking forward to spending more time\n\nwith you again in the New Year, Steve.\n\nSCHMIDT: Good to see you, Rachel.\n\nMADDOW: Thanks.\n\nAll right. Best new thing in the world today features some poll\n\nresults that are way outside the margin of error of awesomeness. That`s\n\ncoming up.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We`re now leaner and focused on what we do\n\nbest.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have repaid every dollar America lent us.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything, plus a profit of more than $22\n\nbillion.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For the American people --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: AIG, we turned it around.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, America.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, America.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you, America, for the freedom to ensure a\n\nbrighter future.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: No, thank you.\n\nThat`s the insurance company, AIG, thanking America for the taxpayer-\n\nfunded $182 billion bailout, in an ad that it started running on New Year`s\n\nDay, after the Treasury sold off its final stake in the insurance company\n\nlast month.\n\nThank you, America. That ad has been running during college football\n\ngames, during NFL playoff games, on news networks, presumably including\n\nthis one.\n\nThe company says it has even bought air time during this upcoming\n\nweekend`s Golden Globe Awards. It`s a two-week TV campaign for the\n\ninsurance giant to not only show gratitude but maybe rebuild their image a\n\nbit, after one of the biggest and most wildly unpopular bailouts of all\n\ntime.\n\nSo how is it going so far?\n\nWell, half way into AIG`s big public relations effort to assure the\n\ncountry that they`re back on track and indebted to us all for saving them\n\nfrom financial ruin, well, this is how it is going.\n\nThank you, America -- now we might sue you to try to squeeze some\n\nmore cash out of you. The board of AIG planning to meet tomorrow to\n\ndecided whether to join a lawsuit being brought by its former CEO on behalf\n\nof shareholders. The lawsuit contends the taxpayers` rescue of the company\n\ncheated shareholders and violated their rights.\n\nIn a statement today, AIG said the board will make a decision in the\n\nnext several weeks. The White House so far is declining to comment on the\n\nissue, saying that the lawsuit is still pending.\n\nBut we do have this. We do have a comment from the person President\n\nObama tasked with inventing an entirely new government agency to protect us\n\nall from predators and negligent companies in the financial sector, outside\n\nwho last week became a United States senator.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren today issuing a statement saying, quote,\n\n\"Beginning in 2008, the federal government poured billions into AIG to save\n\nit from bankruptcy. AIG`s reckless bets nearly crashed our entire economy.\n\nTaxpayers across the country saved AIG from ruin, and it would be\n\noutrageous for this company to turn around and sue the federal government\n\nbecause they think the deal wasn`t generous enough. Even today, the\n\ngovernment an ongoing stealth bailout, propping up AIG with special tax\n\nbreaks -- tax breaks that Congress should stop. AIG should thank American\n\ntaxpayers for their help, not biting the hand that fed them for helping out\n\nin a crisis.\"\n\nRight. As satisfying as Senator Warren`s statement is for its\n\nsmackdown nature, it is even better as a reminder that the AIG bailout and\n\nthe financial crisis as a whole didn`t just happen because of some act of\n\nGod. The meltdown was caused by the recklessness of AIG and all other\n\ncompanies on Wall Street that played fast and loose with the rules, and\n\nthat nevertheless now would prefer even fewer rules to regulate their\n\nactions, because their actions are always so responsible.\n\nSenator Warren`s opponent in the recent election was Scott Brown, who\n\nwas the top beneficiary of Wall Street political donations in the Senate.\n\nBut Scott Brown lost, and he lost to Elizabeth Warren. And so, today it\n\nwas Elizabeth Warren and not Scott Brown, opening up her new little local\n\noffice in western Massachusetts, in Springfield. A new senator who\n\nrepresents the state of Massachusetts, who is not Wall Street`s favorite\n\nsenator, like Scott Brown was, and who has a seat on the Senate Banking\n\nCommittee, a perch from which she can offer the other side of the argument\n\nthat the titans of the American financial colossus would probably rather\n\nmake unopposed.\n\nElections, consequences. Tada!\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: Best new thing in the world today, the 2012 presidential\n\nelection was notoriously tough on pollsters, but the Democratic leaning\n\nfirm, Public Policy Polling, did better than most. PPP correctly\n\npredicting the presidential outcome in all 50 states.\n\nSo, one important thing to know about PPP is that they are accurate.\n\nWe know that from experience.\n\nBut the other important thing to know about PPP is that they are the\n\nonly sound political polling firm in America that regularly are laugh out\n\nloud funny. Por ejemplo, PPP once asked Pennsylvanians, do you have enough\n\nSantorum in your life or not? They once asked Michigan voters, do you\n\nthink the trees are high enough here in Michigan?\n\nAnd their first national poll after the 2012 election, PPP asked, do\n\nyou think that Barack Obama legitimately won the presidential election this\n\nyear, or do you think that ACORN stole it for him? Forty-nine percent said\n\nACORN stole the election -- ACORN which does not exist anymore.\n\nFor Presidents Day last year, PPP asked for favorability ratings for\n\nall 44 U.S. presidents, including the ones almost nobody who`s not on\n\njeopardy remembers. Millard Fillmore`s approval numbers topping out at 7\n\npercent, less than half of Zachary Taylor`s approval rating.\n\nWhy is that? Who knows? But they proved it.\n\nIn July 2011, a PPP national poll turned from questions about\n\nCongress to this. Quote, \"If God exists, do you approve or disapprove of\n\nits performance\"? It turns out god`s approval rating is not that bad, 52\n\npercent of people approve of God`s godliness.\n\nSo, whatever reason, PPP clearly loves their job and they are good at\n\nit. And that combination of being willing to ask weird, funny questions\n\nand doing it in a scientifically sound way, led today to PPP`s latest\n\nnational poll, testing the favorability rating of Congress.\n\nBut because they are PPP, they didn`t just asked getting the\n\nabstract, they asked people to rate Congress alongside 26 other things,\n\nCongress versus cockroaches, cockroaches won.\n\nHead lice -- head lice won big against Congress.\n\nThey tested Congress against gonorrhea. Gonorrhea turns out to be\n\nless popular Congress. Good job, Congress.\n\nAlso telemarketers, they are less popular than Congress is.\n\nCongress is almost as popular as Brussels sprouts, which I love,\n\nwhich I love.\n\nPPP tested Congress against root canals, against being stuck in\n\ntraffic. They tested Congress against carnies. Carnies are more popular\n\nthan Congress.\n\nThey also tested Congress against the Canadian rock band, Nickelback.\n\nWhat does all of this tell us about Congress? Exactly what you think\n\nit tell us. But having scientifically sound polling from a firm that loves\n\nits job and have to do its job this way, is the best new thing in the world\n\ntoday.\n\nNow, it`s time for \"THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL\". Thanks\n\nfor being with us tonight. Have a good one.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY\n\nBE UPDATED.\n\nEND\n\nCopyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
