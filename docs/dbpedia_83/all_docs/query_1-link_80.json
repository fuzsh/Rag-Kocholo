        "text": "WASHINGTON — When J. Scott Gration, a decorated fighter pilot with close ties to President Obama, abruptly resigned last week as ambassador to Kenya, he joined the ranks of a frustrated fraternity: former military commanders who lost their footing when appointed to senior civilian posts in the Obama administration.\n\nA retired Navy admiral, Dennis C. Blair, and a onetime Marine Corps commandant, Gen. James L. Jones, are among those who have stumbled in important political or diplomatic jobs, clashing with colleagues, alienating those who work for them and ultimately losing the commander in chief’s confidence.\n\nMr. Gration, a retired Air Force major general who had served as Mr. Obama’s special envoy to Sudan, announced his resignation on Friday before the release of an internal audit highly critical of his management. The State Department report, according to people familiar with it, describes Mr. Gration as a brusque, imperious figure who intimidated subordinates and had odd habits like working in a restroom to avoid the scrutiny of the embassy staff.\n\nThe State Department issued a three-sentence statement wishing Mr. Gration well as he “moves into private life,” while the White House said nothing. But officials there privately voiced regret at the messy departure of a man they came to like during the 2008 race, when he campaigned energetically for Mr. Obama and was, in the words of one senior official, “a very strong military validator.”\n\nBenjamin J. Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, said he had not read the State Department report and would not comment on it. But he acknowledged that Mr. Gration has a strong personality. “He’s a very direct and candid person,” Mr. Rhodes said. “He speaks his mind, publicly and privately. Clearly, people respond to that in different ways.”\n\nAs a Democrat worried about his relatively modest national security credentials, Mr. Obama may have been particularly eager for “validators” to serve in his administration. But critics say Mr. Gration’s travails demonstrate that the skills honed in the military do not easily transfer to civilian settings, particularly diplomatic ones, where an ambassador must manage a large staff, negotiate with a foreign government and avoid statements that can land one in trouble. Surviving in the White House, with its frantic pace and political crosscurrents, can be even harder.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
