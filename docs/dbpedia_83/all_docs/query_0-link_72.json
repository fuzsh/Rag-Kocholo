        "text": "The Veterans Affairs secretary built a reputation during the Bush administration for standing on principle at great personal cost, but it’s difficult to discern what principle Eric Shinseki is standing on today.\n\nThe embattled leader of the nation’s largest integrated health care system has done little to instill confidence that he can get to the bottom of a scandal shaking the Veterans Health Administration to its foundation.\n\nThe VA’s inspector general is looking into allegations by a former clinic director in Phoenix that up to 40 veterans died while waiting for treatment at a VA hospital while staffers disguised the wait times that patients faced. Since those revelations were reported, similar allegations have emerged from five other facilities.\n\nThe general’s passive response to the revelations — during congressional testimony last week he refused to acknowledge a systemic problem even exits — only fuels the outrage.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is notoriously loyal to members of his Cabinet, but improved care of the nation’s military veterans was supposed to be a centerpiece of his administration’s legacy.\n\nEven a whiff of a scandal sets of a partisan feeding frenzy in Washington, but the emotions around these revelations are both genuine and justified. Charges of bureaucratic blundering in the VA are not exactly new, making the general’s bunker mentality all the more inexplicable.\n\nShinseki’s service to country is indisputable. Twice wounded in Vietnam, the general served as Army chief of staff in George W. Bush’s administration, where found himself odds with superiors after stating that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed in postwar Iraq. He understandably has support among many veterans and elected members of both major parties.\n\nThe secretary’s now infamous “mad as hell” response to the scandal, however, isn’t going to cut it. This is a national disgrace, and American citizens and veterans should expect a quick, decisive response.\n\nANOTHER VIEW\n\nThe latest horrific problems with the\n\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nare hardly surprising.\n\nAnd that, by itself, is reason enough for VA Secretary\n\nEric Shinseki\n\nto be replaced.\n\nWe’ve been hearing the horror stories for far too long, both in Florida and nationally, involving veterans who face problems getting health care or disability benefits. Our veterans — including 1.5 million in Florida — deserve better, and there is little indication that Shinseki has the management skills needed to get the problems under control."
