        "text": "Joseph L. Pierce\n\nPvt. Joseph L. Pierce was 21 years old when he enlisted in the 14th Connecticut Infantry in August 1862. Pierce’s regiment participated in the Battle of Antietam, Maryland, Sept. 17, 1862. He suffered some sickness during his time around Washington and was in the hospital. He was assigned to the Quartermaster Department for a short while and rejoined the 14th in time for the Battle of Chancellorsville, Virginia in May 1863.\n\nThe 14th had a distinguished role in the Gettysburg campaign. It fought on the north part of Cemetery Ridge, July 2, 1863, and was one of the units that helped repel Pickett’s Charge. The 14th was primarily responsible for turning back Brig. Gen. James Pettigrew’s North Carolina division. Contrary to the 14th’s regimental history, Pierce was not the only Soldier of Chinese descent on the battlefield.\n\nJose B. Nisperos\n\nFilipino Army Pvt. Jose B. Nisperos earned the Medal of Honor for heroism in Philippines, Sept. 24, 1911. Nisperos became the first person of Asian heritage to be awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nNisperos served in the 34th Company, Philippine Scouts. In 1913, having been badly wounded — his left arm broken and lacerated and with several spear wounds preventing him from standing — Nisperos continued to fire his rifle with one hand until the enemy was repulsed, thereby aiding materially in preventing the annihilation of his party.\n\nThe Bataan Death March\n\nThe Battle of Bataan ended, April 9, 1942, when U.S. Gen. Edward P. King surrendered to Japanese Gen. Masaharu Homma. At that point, 75,000 Soldiers became prisoners of war: about 12,000 Americans and 63,000 Filipinos. What followed was one of the worst atrocities in modern wartime history — the Bataan Death March. During the Battle of Bataan, the American Soldiers and Filipino soldiers of U.S. Army Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s U.S. Army Forces in the Far East, or USAFFE, had held out for four months against the Imperial Japanese Army, while every other island and nation in the Pacific and Southeast Asia fell to the Japanese. By March 1942, Japan controlled all of the Western Pacific except the Philippines.\n\nStarving, surrounded and unable to get reinforcements due to the Japanese blockade, the Allied forces could not hold. Once the surrender went into effect, the Japanese rounded up the American and Filipino soldiers on the only paved road that ran down the Bataan peninsula and they began marching them north toward Camp O’Donnell in Tarlac province, 65 miles away. As the emaciated men proceeded north up the highway in the blistering heat, the Japanese guards summarily shot or bayoneted any man who fell, attempted to escape, or stopped to quench his thirst at a roadside spigot or puddle. The Japanese guards killed between 7,000-10,000 men during the death march as they kept no records and no one knows the exact number.\n\n442nd receives presidential distinguished unit citation\n\nThe 442nd “Go for Broke” Regimental Combat Team receiveed the Presidential Distinguished Unit citation from President Truman in Washington, July 15. The unit was the most decorated for its size and length of service in U.S. military history. The 100th Infantry Battalion, which was later incorporated into the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, was made up of predominantly Nisei members of the Hawaii Provisional Infantry Battalion. Combined, the 100th Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team received 7 Presidential Unit Citations, 21 Medals of Honor, 29 Distinguished Service Crosses, 560 Silver Stars, 4,000 Bronze Stars, 22 Legion of Merit Medals, 15 Soldier’s Medal and over 4,000 Purple Hearts.\n\nDaniel K. Inouye elected to Congress\n\nWorld War II hero Capt. Daniel K. Inouye became the first Japanese American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and later became a U.S. senator. Daniel K. Inouye was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Sept. 7, 1924, received his undergraduate degree from the University of Hawaii, and his law degree from George Washington University. During World War II, Inouye served in the U.S. Army’s 442nd Regimental Combat Team. For his combat heroism, which cost him his right arm, Inouye was awarded the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart with Cluster.\n\nFollowing the war, Inouye practiced law in Hawaii before entering territorial politics in 1954. When Hawaii became the 50th state, Inouye became one of its first representatives in the U.S. Congress. In 1962 he won election to the U.S. Senate. Senator Inouye gained national distinction in the 1970s as a member of the Senate Watergate Committee and, in 1987, as chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra Committee. He was a longtime member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which he chaired from 2009 to 2012, and also served as the Senate’s president pro tempore from 2010 until his death in 2012. In 2013 Senator Inouye was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, becoming the first — and to date, only — senator to receive both the Medal of Freedom and the Medal of Honor.\n\nElmelindo R. Smith\n\nArmy Platoon Sgt. Elmelindo R. Smith served in the 1st Platoon, Company C, 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor Feb. 16, 1967, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nDuring a reconnaissance patrol, his platoon was suddenly engaged by intense machine-gun fire. With complete disregard for his safety, Smith moved through the deadly fire along the defensive line, positioning soldiers, distributing ammunition and encouraging his men to repel the enemy attack. Repeatedly struck by enemy fire, Smith perished. The valorous acts and heroic leadership of this outstanding Soldier inspired those remaining members of his platoon to beat back the enemy assaults.\n\nRodney James Tadashi Yano\n\nOn Jan. 1, 1969, then-Staff Sgt. Rodney Yano was the acting crew chief and one of two door gunners on his company’s command-and-control helicopter as it fought an enemy entrenched in the dense Vietnamese jungle near Bien Hao. While in position as a gunner, he was also able to toss grenades that emitted white phosphorous smoke at their positions so his troop commander could accurately fire artillery at their entrenchments.\n\nUnfortunately, one of those grenades exploded too early, covering Yano in the burning chemical and causing severe burns. White smoke filled the chopper, and the pilots weren’t able to see to maintain control of the aircraft. Yano refused to give up. The initial grenade explosion partially blinded him and left him with the use of only one arm, but he jumped into action, kicking and throwing the blazing ammunition from the helicopter until the flaming pieces were gone and the smoke filtered out.\n\nOne man on the helicopter was killed, and Yano didn’t survive his many injuries. But his courage and concern for his comrades’ survival kept the chopper from going down, averting more loss of life. For that, Yano was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor and promoted to the rank of sergeant first class.\n\nHerbert Choy becomes first Asian American federal court judge\n\nNewly graduated from Harvard, Choy’s life forever changed on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor. The next day, he enlisted in the Army. As a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps, he entered the Army as a lieutenant and left as a captain. He served in both Japan and Korea, part of the time as a member of the Army Reserve’s Judge Advocate General’s Corps. Choy later retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1946. In 1971 he was nominated and appointed as a judge to the ninth circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nJohn Liu Fugh becomes first Asian American general\n\nBorn in Beijing, China in 1934, John Liu Fugh came to the United States as a teenager in 1949. After graduating from law school he joined the Judge Advocate General’s Corps in 1960. For the next thirty-two years, Fugh soldiered as a judge advocate and made history in 1984 as the first American of Chinese ancestry to reach flag rank. When Maj. Gen. Fugh retired from active duty in 1993, he was the top lawyer in the Army and one of only two Chinese-Americans to reach two-star rank.\n\nRoy Matsumoto inducted into U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Fame\n\nLike many Japanese Americans, Master Sgt. Roy Matsumoto was interned during America’s entry into World War II. While at the Jerome Relocation Center in Arkansas, he volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army’s Military Intelligence Service. He went on to fight in Burma with the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), popularly known as Merrill’s Marauders. Matsumoto was assigned to the Blue Combat Team of the 2nd Battalion.\n\nIn March 1944, near Walawbum, Burma, then-Sgt. Matsumoto discovered and tapped a Japanese phone line. He determined the location of an enemy ammunition dump. The coordinates were relayed his headquarters and the ammunition dump was destroyed. In another intercept the same day, Matsumoto located a large Japanese force moving in the direction of the road block. Forewarned, the 2nd Battalion was able to evacuate in time to avoid confrontation with a nominally superior enemy force. For these two intelligence accomplishments a promoted Staff Sgt. Matsumoto was awarded the Legion of Merit.\n\nAfter the Marauders were disbanded on August 10, 1944, Matsumoto served with the 475th Infantry Regiment (Long Range Penetration, Special) and later in China and Japan as an interpreter supporting war crimes trials. Matsumoto retired from active duty in 1963, attaining the rank of master sergeant. The 475th and Merrill’s Marauders are lineage units to today’s 75th Ranger Regiment. In 1993, Matsumoto was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame for his outstanding contributions.\n\nEric Shinseki becomes the Army's 34th chief of staff\n\nGen. Eric Shinseki was sworn in as the the Army’s 34th chief of staff, June 22. Born in 1942 on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, Shinseki graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in 1965. He served two combat tours and was wounded in action in Vietnam. He served with distinction in Europe, the Pacific and stateside, eventually becoming the Army’s senior leader from June 1999 to June 2003. Shinseki’s military decorations include three Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts.\n\nAs chief of staff, Shinseki initiated the Army Transformation campaign to address both the emerging strategic challenges of the early twenty-first century and the need for cultural and technological change in the Army. Shinseki would retire from active duty in 2003. Shinseki had previously served as the U.S. Army’s 28th vice chief of staff, from 1998 to 1999.\n\nTammy Duckworth becomes first Thai American elected to Congress\n\nTammy Duckworth is the first Thai American woman, one of the first female combat veterans and the first disabled woman to be elected to the U.S. Congress. In 2004, then-Maj. Duckworth was deployed to Iraq as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot for the Illinois Army National Guard. She was one of the first Army women to fly combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom until her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade on Nov. 12, 2004. Duckworth lost her legs and partial use of her right arm in the explosion and was awarded a Purple Heart for her combat injuries.\n\nDuckworth spent the next year recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. As one of the highest-ranking patients, she quickly became an advocate for her fellow Soldiers and testified before Congress about caring for our Veterans and wounded warriors. In 2009, President Obama appointed Duckworth to be assistant secretary of veterans affairs. Duckworth served as the representative for Illinois’ 8th congressional district from 2013 to 2017 and has served as one of Illinois’ senators since 2017."
