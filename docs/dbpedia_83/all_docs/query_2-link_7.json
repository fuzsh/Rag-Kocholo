        "text": "WASHINGTON — President Obama stopped short of dressing down his veterans affairs secretary, Eric Shinseki, during a blunt hourlong talk in the Oval Office on Wednesday. But the commander in chief made clear that a growing health care scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs had put the future of Mr. Shinseki — a retired four-star general and no stranger to Washington political uproars — once again on the line.\n\n“I said it to him today: I want to see what the results of these reports are, and there is going to be accountability,” Mr. Obama told reporters in the White House briefing room immediately afterward, referring to internal inquiries, as Mr. Shinseki quietly left the West Wing through a side door.\n\nThe president called Mr. Shinseki a “good soldier” who had put his “heart and soul” into the care of veterans, and said that “we’re going to work with him to solve the problem.” But, he repeated, “I am going to make sure there is accountability.”\n\nIt was a grim moment for the 71-year-old Mr. Shinseki, whose own disability — he lost part of his right foot after tripping on a land mine when he was a young soldier in Vietnam — makes him a client of the sprawling agency he oversees. A former Army chief of staff who famously fought with the White House of President George W. Bush over the war in Iraq, he is facing another dramatic turn in a career that has been filled with them.\n\nAllegations that veterans hospitals manipulated waiting lists in order to hide long delays that many patients faced have created a political storm for the Obama White House. They have also prompted condemnations on Capitol Hill, where many Republicans — and as of Wednesday, two House Democrats, both from Georgia — are calling for Mr. Shinseki to resign.\n\n“I respect his sacrifice, I respect what he did, but it’s under his watch that we are in this situation,” one of those Democrats, Representative David Scott, said Wednesday in an impassioned speech on the House floor. “Mr. President, we need urgency!”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
