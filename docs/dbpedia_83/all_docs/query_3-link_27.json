        "text": "WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 Â— Senator John Kerry sharpened his criticism of President Bush today over the costs of the war in Iraq, but the president quickly responded that the Americans who died there would be properly honored only by \"completing the mission.\"\n\nMr. Kerry, who trails Mr. Bush in opinion polls as the last stretch of the presidential election campaign begins, has lately stepped up efforts to shift the debate from terrorism and his Vietnam War service to problems with Iraq and the American economy. In a speech in Cincinnati today, he combined those themes in a way meant to show that Americans were suffering doubly from what Mr. Kerry said was Mr. Bush's wrong-headed approach to Iraq.\n\nThe senator asserted that because of poor administration planning, the war had cost American taxpayers $200 billion that could have been spent on important needs at home like fighting crime, improving health care and better educating the poor.\n\nPaying tribute to the more than 1,000 Americans who died in Iraq, Mr. Kerry said that they represented \"the most incalculable loss of all.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts senator did not explicitly suggest that American lives had been lost through misplanning. But he said the president had ignored \"the best advice of America's own military.\"\n\nMr. Kerry also asserted that Mr. Bush \"even fired the Army chief of staff\" because \"he didn't like what he was hearing.\" The former Army chief, Gen. Eric Shinseki, faced heavy criticism from within the administration after suggesting that an invasion force needed to be several hundred thousand strong to pacify Iraq properly. But General Shinseki retired, and was not fired, although it is unclear whether he acted under pressure.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
