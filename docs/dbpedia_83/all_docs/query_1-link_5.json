        "text": "Allegations that dozens of veterans have died without receiving care have generated the largest scandal in the tenure of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki — and his response last week might not be sufficient for him to keep his job.\n\nShinseki made his pitch last week to stay, telling lawmakers he was “mad as hell” and accepting the resignation of his top health deputy. But the allegations facing the VA are so damaging that lawmakers, pundits and newspapers are pressuring the retired four-star Army general to finally step down from the top post at the troubled agency.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Dole defends Shinseki)\n\n“You’ve got a crisis here: a crisis of confidence, a crisis of leadership and a crisis of the direction of the VA in the 21st century,” Anthony Principi, President George W. Bush’s first VA secretary, told POLITICO.\n\nDeciding which Cabinet members survive a scandal and which do not is more art than science. Attorney General Eric Holder remains in office despite Republican votes to hold him in contempt, while former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stepped down several months after the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov and General Services Administrator Martha Johnson quickly resigned during the fallout from a lavish GSA conference in Las Vegas.\n\nBut the VA creates an especially emotional situation. The stories out of Phoenix and other facilities of veterans dying while waiting for health care — as officials hid their names on secret waiting lists — have resonated in ways that issues like even the disability claims backlog did not.\n\nMany veterans groups and former officials have found Shinseki’s response simply insufficient.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Top VA health official resigns)\n\n“If this happened on my watch, and lots of bad things happen under a secretary’s watch, I would have been all over it, quite honestly,” said Principi, who stopped short of calling for Shinseki’s resignation. “Why this bunker mentality?”\n\nMaking matters worse were Shinseki’s efforts last week. At a Senate hearing, Shinseki maintained that the allegations in Phoenix were isolated and not necessarily part of a wider problem, and he wouldn’t go into details about who might have been fired over falsified wait lists, leaving lawmakers dissatisfied.\n\nA day later, the VA announced that Undersecretary for Health Robert Petzel was resigning — but he had already announced he’d be retiring and his replacement has been named. One veterans group still backing Shinseki called the move a “token resignation,” while House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) called the VA’s announcement “the pinnacle of disingenuous political doublespeak.”\n\n( Also on POLITICO: McDonough: Obama ‘madder than hell’ on VA scandal)\n\nSunday, the scandal appeared to spread to Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to Daily Beast reporting, and Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) says his office has already received whistleblower complaints.\n\nStill, Shinseki has the support of many administration officials and lawmakers — and he has faced a political firestorm before. When he was Army chief of staff during the George W. Bush administration, Shinseki was ostracized for saying that hundreds of thousands of soldiers would be needed in postwar Iraq, putting him at odds with then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nBefore he retired, Shinseki was effectively made into a lame duck by Rumsfeld, who was fired by President Bush in 2006.\n\n“I think the fact that he was such a hero then [to Iraq War opponents] had a lot to do with him getting the job in the first place. Here’s a guy that stood up for principle,” said Larry Korb, a defense analyst at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress. “If you push him out, then whatever his standing was — based upon standing up for the truth and turning out to be right — gets somewhat tarnished.”\n\nThe White House says it still has confidence in the VA secretary.\n\n“Gen. Shinseki continues to work this every single day, you saw him up there, he testified for three hours [Thursday], sat and listened to the veterans service organizations after he finished, went out after that and talked to the press again, and he will continue to work these issues until they’re fixed,” White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nShinseki himself has said he has no intention of quietly stepping down. “I intend to continue this mission until we’ve satisfied either that goal, or I’m told by the commander in chief that my time has been served,” he told the Senate panel last week.\n\nIt may be too soon to say what fate awaits Shinseki. Many in Washington say it depends largely on how he responds to the allegations of health care failures, including secret lists that concealed how long veterans actually had to wait for appointments, at multiple VA facilities.\n\nShinseki has ordered an internal VA review and said he fully supports the VA inspector general investigation into the falsified schedules, which is expected to be finished in August. Those investigations could help him show that he is able to hold those responsible accountable, defense analysts say.\n\n“As soon as the IG report comes out, then he’s got to move forcefully,” Korb said.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Shinseki will have to dig into this issue. “If there’s one bureaucracy in Washington that’s more intractable than the Department of Defense, it’s VA,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” earlier this month. “My own view is that the problem is below the secretary. And I think it’s really important for him to delve into this. And then if there are real problems, then to hold people accountable.”\n\nBut the August due date is an eternity in Washington, and Republican lawmakers are demanding accountability now. Things aren’t likely to get easier for Shinseki this week, as the House is set to vote on legislation — opposed by the VA — that would make it easier for the VA secretary to fire his senior executives.\n\nBut Shinseki may benefit from the hesitation of some lawmakers and veterans groups to push for resignation.\n\n“I hate making somebody’s head roll at this point and time,” Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) told POLITICO after the Shinseki hearing. “It’s not the right result, the right result is to get all the answers first and then whatever is appropriate should happen.”\n\nJoe Davis, public affairs director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, cautioned against a rush to judgment before the IG investigation is complete. “People are calling for the secretary’s head,” he said. “But the thing is, if you fire the leader, now who takes his place? How’s anything going to be fixed if you fire the leader?”"
