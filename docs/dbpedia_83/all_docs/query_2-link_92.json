        "text": "Chicago: US President-elect Barack Obama has selected retired general Eric Shinseki to be the next secretary of veterans affairs.\n\nObama's announcement was made in a television interview taped on Saturday that is to be aired in full on Sunday.\n\nShinseki clashed with the administration of President George W. Bush over how many troops would be needed to stabilise Iraq after the US-led invasion.\n\nShinseki served in the Army for 38 years and lost part of his right foot during one of two combat tours in Vietnam. He was Chief of Staff of the Army from 1999 to 2003."
