        "text": "Putting the VA scandal into perspective\n\nThe scandal involving military veterans waiting for months before being seen by doctors at Veterans Health Administration hospitals is horrible, and it tugs at our heartstrings.\n\nCongress is furious. President Obama is panicked because the whole thing blew up in his face, and Americans are disgusted. Although Eric Shinseki has resigned as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the crisis is so deep that it will take many years to fix.\n\nBut the scandal is not something new that has just burst onto the national scene. And the problems are not confined to veterans hospitals. The problems are going to spread to civilian hospitals and clinics.\n\nMore than a year ago, I wrote that we needed to pay attention to the shortage of doctors in the United States. The shortage was not a secret then, and the problem hasn't gone away.\n\nThe Minneapolis Star Tribune reported recently that many health care experts foresee a shortage of doctors over the next decade as the population ages and the Affordable Care Act increases the number of Americans with health insurance. \"By one estimate, the nation will be short 90,000 physicians in the next decade,\" the newspaper said.\n\nA New York Times story, \"Doctor shortage is cited in delays at VA hospitals,\" said: \"With too few doctors to handle a swelling patient population of veterans, hospital officials were under pressure to excel in the annual performance reviews used to determine raises, an inspector general's report found.\"\n\nReally?! I raised the question a year ago of how the Affordable Care Act plans to cope with up to 50 million uninsured Americans suddenly eligible for health care when there are not enough doctors.\n\nWhat would this do to access by all of us to our doctors? The answer is clear: There will be long waits before we can get in to see our health care providers, no matter how good our insurance plan, no matter how good our doctors. It's called \"input overload.\"\n\nNow politicians are exploiting the current VA issue. In particular, Republicans are pinning the blame on Obama and Shinseki, as if this whole disgrace had started with them.\n\nHere is what I wrote in the Washington Post regarding the scandal: \"The Democrats seem to be too timid to take the offense on this and make the case that budget cuts and 'sequestration' made worse an already huge problem. When President George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney fought two wars off budget, they also fought these wars 'off the VA medical support budget.' Now we are harvesting the bitter crop of this denial of reality.\"\n\nI believe that we need to start recruiting kids in grade school to become interested in medicine, give them an awesome curriculum that will excite and prepare them, expand the numbers admitted to medical school, and roll out a lot of cash so medical schools can handle the bigger load.\n\nThen we need to make sure that doctors and other health care providers such as nurse practitioners are compensated at a level that will attract and keep folks in those professions.\n\nToday, being a nurse or doctor is becoming less and less attractive because of the huge cost of medical education and the burdensome debt, often a quarter-million dollars for a physician. That, combined with pay freezes and liability risks for malpractice, makes it less and less attractive to become a doctor.\n\nWe can sit back and complain about the VA hospital scandal. We can do nothing in the face of an avalanche of new patients hitting an already overloaded health care system and then bitterly complain about waiting days or weeks before we can see a doctor.\n\nOr we can make a lot of noise, raise some hell and demand action. I prefer the latter. Let's fix this mess.\n\nTHE AUTHOR:\n\nSTEFFEN SCHMIDT is a professor of political science at Iowa State University. He writes blogs for The Des Moines Register and WNYC radio.
