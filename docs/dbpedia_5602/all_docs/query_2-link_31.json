        "text": "Citing personal health conditions and the need to put \"family first,\" Robert P. Wise, the longtime president and CEO of Hunterdon Healthcare System announced Thursday that he is retiring at the end of June.\n\nUnder Wise's leadership over the past three decades, the Raritan Township-based healthcare system has grown exponentially, adding to the services it offers Hunterdon County residents while also expanding its footprint into neighboring Central Jersey communities.\n\nBut that growth also has impacted Wise personally.\n\nIn an open letter Wise wrote to his Board of Trustees, medical staff, employees and volunteers, he wrote, “It has been argued that the long-term stress and demands of my position are now real contributing factors and that my chronic health condition places me at greater risk of an untimely event. Over the past few days I have spent many hours talking to my wife and family members. They reminded me how fortunate I was 16 years ago. It is time for me to practice what I have preached — ‘Family First’.”\n\nWise took the reign of leadership of Hunterdon Healthcare System in 1990. He also serves as president and CEO for the system’s member organizations which include Hunterdon Medical Center, Hunterdon Healthcare Foundation, MidJersey Health Corporation and Hunterdon Regional Community Health.\n\nDuring a period when other hospitals merged because of economic pressures, Wise has been able to make the Hunterdon Healthcare System a profitable community resource through joint business ventures that brought advanced technology and comprehensive services to Hunterdon County and surrounding communities. Since 1991, he saw the organization’s revenues increase by 70 percent to more than $250 million with more than 2,500 employees.\n\nEARLIER: 2017 was another good year for Hunterdon Healthcare\n\nDuring his annual report to the community a few weeks ago, Wise noted that in 2017, Hunterdon was the only hospital out of 84 in New Jersey not to be penalized by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid for the number of patient readmissions.\n\n\"You can't get more reliable than that,\" Wise said the audience.\n\nIn a national report, Hunterdon also has consistently been ranked as one of the top healthiest counties in New Jersey. Hunterdon was able in 2017 to keep its title as the healthiest county in New Jersey, though it slipped to second in 2018.\n\nREAD: Safety grades for Central Jersey hospitals\n\nUnder his leadership, the Hunterdon Healthcare System entered into an affiliation with Fox Chase Cancer Center, which culminated in the opening of the Hunterdon Regional Cancer Center. Wise has also led the way in the expansion of Hunterdon Medical Center’s Maternity & Newborn Care Unit, Emergency Department and Operating Rooms.\n\nHe also opened two Hunterdon Health and Wellness Centers in Clinton Township and Whitehouse Station, and the Norman and Denise Guilloud Cardiovascular Center, while expanding primary and specialty care practices in Hunterdon, Somerset, Warren and Mercer counties.\n\n“In his many years of service on the New Jersey Hospital Association Board of Trustees — including serving as Board Chairman in 2000-2001 — Bob has been a thoughtful leader who challenges his colleagues to think broadly and creatively about the very best ways to deliver healthcare to our patients and communities,” said Cathy Bennett, the association’s president and CEO. “Thanks to Bob for making his community a healthier place!”\n\nWhile leading the Hunterdon Healthcare System, Wise also has been a key collaborator in a number of community organizations in the county and beyond. He is a member of the Flemington Rotary and chairman of the Board of Trustees for Raritan Valley Community College, which serves Hunterdon and Somerset counties. He has won numerous awards including the Flemington Business Association’s Business Man of the Year, Edward J. Ill Excellence in Medicine Award for Outstanding Medical Executive, New Jersey Hospital Association Executive Leadership Services Award, Elks Distinguished Citizenship Award and the Distinguished Citizen Award, Patriots’ Path Council Boy Scouts of America.\n\n\"Bob Wise was a visionary in healthcare,\" said Steve Kalafer, chairman of the Flemington Car and Truck Country Family of Brands. \"He took a rural community hospital and transformed it into an integrated health system serving beyond its county limits. He re-imagined what it could be and it can now chart its future course on its own terms. He will be missed in his role in our community.\"\n\nWise served as a past chair of the Hunterdon County Chamber of Commerce, and led numerous initiatives that have had a positive impact on the business community and the Hunterdon County economy, said Christopher J. Phelan, chamber president.\n\n“He has been a tremendous leader in our community and has advanced the expansion of our healthcare system which has benefited generations of individuals,” Phelan said. “I admire and thank Bob for his leadership, vision, service and dedication in making Hunterdon County such a wonderful and healthy place to live, work and visit. I and the entire chamber wish him all the best as he enters this new chapter, spending well deserved time with family and friends.”\n\nWise will remain on the board of Raritan Valley Community College, something college President Michael J. McDonough is very glad to know.\n\n\"I am delighted that Robert Wise will be staying,\" McDonoughh said. \"His contributions to the college are so significant. I rely on Robert's judgment and expertise. He has been a wonderful collaborator and supporter.\"\n\nWise’s last day with Hunterdon Healthcare System will be June 30. In the interim, he will be working on a transition plan for all current activities at the Health System, according to the hospital news release. As chairman of the Hunterdon Healthcare System Board of Trustees, Robert Cody, M.D. will assume the role of acting president and CEO.\n\nREAD: Hunterdon woman is spirit of cancer awareness\n\nCody is a retired cardiologist. He has been a cardiovascular executive in the pharmaceutical/medical device industries, and in academic and community health systems. He is a recognized expert with an established career in cardiovascular research, particularly heart failure. His approaches to research have extended to the identification and support of new technologies and emerging companies.\n\nHe has received several honors and, just last month, he received the Edward Bradley Award from the Medical Alumni Association of Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia for a career of service, research and critical care. He and his wife of 39 years live in Hunterdon County."
