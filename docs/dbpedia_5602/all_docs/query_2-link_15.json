In the process of looking for a job, he found one at RKO as a sound and music editor working for Orson Welles and directing for Val Lewton ( Garry, 39). This is where he long span of career began. At RKO, he was hired by Val Lewton as a manual laborer (Gehring, 3). He however grew on to become a sound and music editor before later expanding his career to become a director. When he ventured in directing of movies, he began by directing horror films and he felt that was his area of interest. He directed horror movies like The Body Snatcher. His works in the horror films were however not celebrated (Gehring, 6).\n\nHe later ventured in satirical comedy alongside Benchley where he became more innovative and his works were noticed (Gehring, 8). Through hard work, Robert Wise became known in the industry. He came to work hard until 1950s at RKO (Gehring, 31) . He directed over twenty of his forty films during this period.\n\nStyles\n\nIn his career, Robert Wise applied a number of styles while directing his films. He had a great combination of techniques that brought a sharp focus both on the fore ground and the background of the film. His versatility in the use of different styles made his films to appeal across different spheres. Robert Wise changed his styles and techniques to venture in different films as a response to the requirement of the film.\n\nFor instance, he used psychological horror technique in his film, The Haunting. He brings scenes that are that combine both horror and psychological fiction that provokes the mind with an intent to disturb and create fear. Additionally, he became familiar with the use of making a film using the optical printer techniques. This was evident when he was directing the film Citizen Kane. The other form of style that was also common in his films was the conventional auteurists expectations. The films directed by Robert wise were slow and the cameras too, though mobile, didi not move either physically or even through zooms like in The Haunting. ( Busch,4).Robert Wise employed these styles if naturalistic or expressionist refrained from using a particular style. The political or moral aspects of the film were expressed physically not just through pacing.\n\nCommon Subject Matter in Robert Wise Films\n\nRobert Wise directed over forty movies. His films covered a number of subject areas. In his Film, Born To Kill, he focuses on the theme of murder.

Through the use of these techniques the new way of developing motion pictures was born. Two or more film projectors are linked to produce the best of the pictures. Furthermore, the use of still pictures is also another techniques that Robert Wise had perfected that has assisted the national cinema members develop better films.\n\nThe ability to make an audience come out with value is something that director Robert Wise also perfected.
