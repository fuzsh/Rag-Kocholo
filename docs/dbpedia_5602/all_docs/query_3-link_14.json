        "text": "This glossary contains a number of recurrent terms found on the present site which may not be clear to all readers, especially when employed within the context of an art historical discussion. Some terms, signaled by an icon of the Vermeer's monogram, are examined as they relate specifically to Vermeer's art. Each of the four sections of the glossary can be accessed from the menu top located on the top of the page.\n\nThe terms in this glossary are cross-linked or externally linked only the first time they appear in the same entry.\n\nDammar Varnish\n\nDammar is a type of tree sap from Malaysia, Borneo, Java or Sumatra. This varnish retains its colorless appearance longer than any other common varnish. It is generally composed of a single resin, such as Dammar or a synthetic type. Dammar contains a high percentage of turps or mineral spirits. This means that it does not form a thick layer like normal varnishes and is therefore used for bringing out the full wet appearance of the oil paint on a dry ground before resuming to paint. Dammar varnish does yellow and crack, as all varnishes do, but less so than others. The addition of Dammar to a paint medium adds brilliance and luminosity to color.\n\nDead-color (Dutch: dood-verf)\n\nDead-color (in Dutch, dood-verf), which is the equivalent of today's term \"underpainting,\" is a more or less monochrome version of the final painting that gives volume, suggests substance, substantiates the principal compositional elements and distributes darks and lights. The lack of color used in the term probably explains the word \"dead.\" In the seventeenth century, dead-coloring appears in various forms.\n\nDead-coloring was so important in the painting process that it was mandatory in the early days of Flemish painting. In 1546, one of the 's Hertogenbosch guild rules states, \"7. item. All painters will be bound to work with good paints, and they will not make any paintings than on good dry oak planks or wainscot, being each color first dead-colored and this on a double ground…\"\n\nIt was not uncommon in the busier seventeenth-century studios that assistants worked up numbers of paintings to the dead-coloring stage that only needed to be finished by the master. Maintaining an abundant stock of images on spec may have been an expedient to entice prospective buyers.\n\nClick here for more information on dead color.\n\nAs far as it is possible to understand, Vermeer used the dead-coloring methods common among Northern painters.\n\nIn the Woman Holding a Balance, the brown (raw umber and/or black) dead-color filled two functions: the broader areas of dark brown paint represented the masses of shadows with the light buff color of the ground serving as the lights. In the early Diana and her Companions, a carefully brushed underdrawing was followed by a monochrome dead-coloring in order to determine the essential forms of the composition. Some of the dead-coloring can be made out here and there through abraded paint layers.\n\nIt has been remarked that more than one passage in The Geographer appears unfinished and that this allows us to have a glimpse at Vermeer's underpainting although it is not out of the question that early restoration may be partially responsible for the loss of the uppermost paint layers. The massive wooden window frame and the deeply shadowed area of the carpet correspond rather closely to our idea of Vermeer's underpainting method. Neither of these two areas is defined according to the artist's habitual standard of finish. The darkest parts are all painted with the same semi-transparent dark gray pigment, most likely a mixture of raw umber and black. Here and there on the carpet's fore side we may observe the initial accents of local color. Some of the decorative features have been painted with medium blue paint over the monochrome ground, most likely a mixture of natural ultramarine blue and a touch of lead white. It is probable that the blue areas would have been subsequently glazed with the same ultramarine, this time in a dense, transparent medium in order to deepen and enrich their color. Other parts of the decorative patterns have been brought up with a medium-toned earth color, which compared to the darkest underpaint seems to be a medium-dark yellow ochre. The upper folds of the carpet which catch the incoming light have been depicted with light-toned paint, here with the addition of ochre and there with ultramarine.\n\nDecorative Arts\n\nThe decorative arts are arts or crafts concerned with the design and manufacture of beautiful objects that are also functional. It includes interior design, but not usually architecture. The decorative arts are often categorized in opposition to the \"fine arts,\" namely, painting, drawing, photography and sculpture, which generally are thought to have no function other than to be seen. The distinction between the decorative and the fine arts arose from the post-Renaissance art of the West but is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most highly regarded works—or even all works—include those in decorative media.\n\nThe promotion of the fine arts over the decorative in European thought can largely be traced to the Renaissance, when Italian theorists such as Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) promoted artistic values, exemplified by the artists of the High Renaissance who placed little value on the cost of materials or the amount of skilled work required to produce a work, but instead valued artistic imagination and the individual touch of the hand of a supremely gifted master such as Michelangelo (1475–1564), Raphael (1483–1520) or Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), reviving to some extent the approach of antiquity. Most European art prior to this period had been produced under a very different set of values, where both expensive materials and virtuoso displays in difficult techniques were highly valued.\n\nDecorum\n\nDecorum (from the Latin: \"right, proper\") was a principle of classical rhetoric, poetry and theatrical theory that was about the fitness or otherwise of a style to a theatrical subject. The concept of decorum is also applied to prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within set situations and suitability of subject matter and style in painting. Decorum also determined that a pictorial or sculptural subject was suitable for an architectural setting, such as Vulcan's forge over a fireplace, or that kinds of buildings are fitting in urban or rural contexts or appropriate for persons of certain status. Liturgical functions influenced by decorum dictate the placement of paintings, mosaics and sculpture in religious buildings.\n\nOriginally a literary term, it was first used in relation to the visual arts in the Renaissance in the writings of Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519). According to da Vinci's theory of Decorum, the gestures which a figure makes must not only demonstrate feelings but must be appropriate to age, rank and position. So must also be dress, the setting in which the subject moves and all the other details of the composition. Such thinking greatly influenced academic art, in particular history painting, from the Renaissance through to the nineteenth century. According to his detractors, the cardinal sin of Caravaggio (1571–1610), who refused to study either ancient sculpture or Raphael's (1483–1520) paintings, was the lack of decorum in subject matter and his supposed unfiltered imitation of nature.\n\nSuch an unselective imitation became a leitmotif of seventeenth-century art criticism, and Giovanni Pietro Bellori (1613–1696) was its most vocal exponent. In his influential essay \"L'ldea\" (1664), published as the preface to his Lives of Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects, Caravaggio was compared to Demetrius for being \"too natural,\" painting men as they appear, with all their defects and individual peculiarities. In his influential Het Groot Schilderboek (The Great Book of Painting) the Dutch painter and art theoretician Gérard de Lairesse (1641–1711) faulted the art of his fellowmen for its too often vulgar subject matter, its lack of decorum in dressing classical figures in contemporary clothes, its lack of composition and sober painting handling, believing that only correct theory could produce good art.\n\nDepth/Deep (color)\n\nA color is deep or has depth when it has low lightness and strong saturation. Opposite to deep colors in both value and saturation are pale colors, such as lead-tin yellow, and white. Some paints are inherently deep, such as natural ultramarine and alizarin crimson.\n\nDendrochronology\n\nDendrochronology (or tree-ring dating) is the scientific method of dating tree rings (also called growth rings) to the exact year they were formed in order to analyze atmospheric conditions during different periods in history. Dendrochronology is useful for determining the timing of events and rates of change in the environment (most prominently climate) and also in works of art and architecture, such as old panel paintings on wood, buildings, etc. It is also used in radiocarbon dating to calibrate radiocarbon ages. Dendrochronology has become an important tool for dating panel paintings. However, unlike analysis of samples from buildings, which are typically sent to a laboratory, wooden supports for paintings usually have to be measured in a museum conservation department, which places limitations on the techniques that can be used.\n\nIn addition to dating, dendrochronology can also provide information as to the source of the panel. Many Early Netherlandish paintings have turned out to be painted on panels of \"Baltic oak\" shipped from the Vistula region via ports of the Hanseatic League. Oak panels were used in a number of northern countries such as England, France and Germany. Wooden supports other than oak were rarely used by Netherlandish painters.\n\nThe support of Vermeer's Girl with a Flute is a single, vertically grained oak panel with beveled edges on the back. Dendrochronology gives a tree felling date in the early 1650s.\n\nDepth of Field\n\nIn photography, the distance between the nearest point and the farthest point in the subject that is perceived as acceptably sharp along a common image plane. For most subjects, it extends one-third of the distance in front of and two-thirds of the distance behind the point focused on.\n\nAlthough the human eye makes use of a convex lens there is no perception of depth of field because the lens continually changes its shape in order to bring whatever it is looking at into perfect focus. In traditional forms of visual representation, even those which encompass expansive landscapes where the depth of field is very noticeable with a modern camera, there is no true depth of field. However, by the Renaissance, painters began to systematically soften the contours and modeling of objects seen at great distances as a means of enhancing the illusion of depth.\n\nArt historians have made much of what seems to be a deliberate variation in focus in the paintings of Vermeer, presumably because the artist used an optical device called the camera obscura, which makes use of a single convex lens. It is presumed by some that by observing certain aspects of the camera's image, whose field of depth is exceptionally restricted, the artist was inspired and emulated such effects in paintings such as The Art of Painting and The Lacemaker, where the foreground objects are so blurred that they are barely recognizable.\n\nDesign\n\nThe words \"composition\" and \"design\" when applied to the visual arts are often used as if they were interchangeable, but each connotes something rather different. Composition is an arranging or pushing-about of the various parts of a picture—of the items, whether they be figures, architectural features or man-made props, of main interest and of secondary and tertiary interest—in such manner that the narrative picture explains itself and tells a given story. Design, instead is the arranging of an agreeable or significant pattern, a formal framework that complements the composition and its story. Among many other elements of design, is the disposing of the dark masses so that they will balance agreeably with the light masses. In modern commercial art, as is well known, the designer makes great care of to properly relate the dark masses of his poster or advertising placard properly related to the light masses. Strictly speaking, while the function of composition is narrative, that of design is aesthetic.\n\nfrom Philips Hale, Vermeer, Boston: Small, Maynard, 1937, pp. 80–81.\n\nThe design—the pattern, so to say—of certain of Vermeer's works is superlatively beautiful. Such excellence is the more remarkable as it is a quality that does not appear in the work of most of the other Dutch painters. Their pictures are often admirably composed; they convey their motive and their story. They are sometimes composed subtly and elusively. Yet the ablest of these painters were uninterested, as a rule, in the underlying pattern of their compositions.\n\nAn exception among them, in this regard, was Carel Fabritius (1622–1654), Vermeer's fellow townsman; and this circumstance gives one reason for supposing that Fabritius may have been intimate with Vermeer. The methods of the two men as designers, however, were not closely alike, and Vermeer excelled in both composition and design. As his subjects were usually of the simplest nature, his compositional problems were not particularly intricate. Whatever story there was to tell, this was of the shortest and simplest; the intrigue required no elaborate working out. The design, on the other hand, of a Vermeer, is often subtle, highly original, and, in his best works, very beautiful. For their qualities of design, one thinks especially of The Music Lesson, formerly in Windsor Castle, the National Gallery Lady at the Virginals, the Pearl Necklace, Berlin Gallery, the Woman at the Casement, Metropolitan Museum, the Reader, Amsterdam Gallery, and the Girl Reading a Letter, Dresden Gallery.\n\nSome of Vermeer's works, withal, which contain his best painting, are not remarkable in design. Thus, the weakly patterned Studio of the Czernin Collection seems to have been painted for the sheer pleasure of the painting. As Vermeer's design and composition are so original and personal, it is strange that his work was ever mistaken for that of other me—Gerrit ter Borch's (1617–1681), Pieter de Hooch (1629–1684), and Gabriel Metsu (1629–1667), for instance, each of whom had his own mode of composition. Ter Borch, as a rule, employed his background merely as a foil for the human figure. He made wonderful little figures which are the whole thing in his pictures; to them the background is entirely subsidiary, delightful as it may be in its manner of staying back. In planning a composition, Ter Borch apparently at first arranged his mannikins agreeably and then bethought himself of a fitting background. De Hooch's plan of composing was quite different from Ter Borch's. A picture presented itself to his mind as an interior composed of beautiful lines and chiaroscuro. His figures look like afterthoughts, as in the one—Dutch Interior with Soldiers—at the National Gallery, London, in which lines of the background can be seen showing through one of the principal figures. De Hooch, in point of fact, did not do the figure at all well. He is a painter of interiors, par excellence.\n\nDetail\n\nA detail is an individual or minute part of an item or particular. The etymology of the word involves cutting, as in nouns like \"tailor\" and \"retail.\"\n\nIn modern art history, the study of detail is not just a specialty investigative tool, but a fundamental part of the discipline. \"Just as a mycologist looks at spores, or an ornithologist at the markings on birds' breasts, or a dermatologist at tiny suspicious spots, so an art historian looks at details.\"Elkins, James. \"On the Impossibility of Close Reading: The Case of Alexander Marshack.\" Current Anthropology 37, no. 2 (April 1996): 185. Accordingly, art historians who concentrate on detail \"are only doing what scientists are…doing: they are systematically dissecting or disassembling their objects into component parts...\" in order to more fully understand their innermost workings. In the opinion of the art historian James Elkins, this model may also betray art history's desire to \"become scientific, a desire that has long infected the humanities.\"\n\nArt historians generally work with two types of details. The first regards the details of a painting's narrative, that is, of specific illusory objects or parts of objects which are represented in the pictured scene. Often, such details occupy only a minimum area of the painting's surface, but for the inquiring art historian they have great consequence on the final reading of the work as a whole. For example, a tiny, barely noticeable floor tile with a Cupid scribbled upon it in Vermeer's Milkmaid, a picture which has been traditionally interpreted as a hymn to domestic virtue, may, according to one analysis, suggest covert amorous undertones. In this case, the amorous reading would be presumably strengthened by the nearby footwarmer which, according to one art historian, was at times associated with a lover's desire for constancy and caring but may likewise have carried sexual implication since most Dutchman would have known that the warmth of the coals moved under the skirt upwards towards the lady's private parts.\n\nThe second kind of detail regards an isolated area of the painting where the object of attention is not so much an illusory object but the manner or means by which it is depicted. The most frequently analyzed details of this kind are brush handling, peculiar paint or surface qualities and stylistic components which might distinguish the technique of one painter from that of another. Various art historians have argued that \"the fragment played a central role in Romantic aesthetics; it was taken to possess a greater immediacy than the whole, as well as a privileged relation to truth. Artworks were understood to have been muted by systems of academic conventions and skills, and by concepts such as balance, symmetry, composition and especially decorum. Details were thought to be outside such systems\"Elkins, James. 1996. and thus capable of revealing the artist's innermost nature.\n\nPortrait of Giovanni Morell\n\nFranz von Lenbach\n\n1886\n\nOil on canvas, 125.5 x 90.2 cm.\n\nAccademia Carrara\n\nGiovanni Morelli (1816–1891) was an Italian art critic and political figure who developed the technique of scholarship, identifying through minor details that, revealed artists' scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying. The Morellian method is based on clues offered by negligible details rather than identities of composition and subject matter or other broad treatments that are more likely to be seized upon by students, copyists and imitators. Morelli's method has its nearest roots in his own discipline of medicine, with its identification of disease through numerous symptoms, each of which may be apparently trivial in itself. Adopting Morelli's approach, one scholar has recently argued that the authorship or Vermeer's early Diana and her Companions and Christ in the House of Martha and Mary is strengthened by the fact that the toes of two females figures are painted in a similar manner. The Morellian method of finding essence and hidden meaning in details not only influenced the course of art history but also had a much wider cultural influence. There are references to his work in the Sherlock Holmes novels by Arthur Conan Doyle and in the works of Sigmund Freud.\n\nSome art historians object to the dangers of considering detail as the key, or \"the last word\" \"that is capable of unlocking and exhausting all the meaning of all that is painted around it.\"Didi-Huberma, Georges. \"The art of not describing: Vermeer—the detail and the patch.\" History of the Human Sciences 2 (1989): 137. Jenkins postulates that the modern-day \"fascination with the detail can be nothing more or less than an attempt, sometimes not fully articulated, to escape the potentially rigid grip of iconographic interpretation\"' The French philosopher and art historian Georges Didi-Huberman opines that the painting \"is always considered to be a ciphered text, and the cipher, like a treasure chest, or a skeleton hidden in a cupboard, is always there waiting to be found, somehow behind the painting, not enclosed within the material density of the paint: it will be the 'solution' to the enigma posed by the picture, its 'motive', or the 'admission' of its secret meaning. In most cases it will be an emblem, a portrait, or some allusion to the 'events' of narrative history; in short, what the historian will have the duty of making the painted work 'confess' or give up will be a symbol or a referent. This means acting as though the painted work had committed a crime, a single crime (when the fact is that the painted work, pretty as a picture and good as gold, has either committed no crime at all, or, by cunningly exploiting the black magic of sight, is getting away with hundreds of unseen ones).\"Didi-Huberma, Georges. 1989: 137.\n\nDiagonal Line\n\nSee also, line.\n\nLine, along with color, is considered the most basic elements of drawing. Different lines have different psychological impacts depending on variations in their length, direction and weight.\n\nDiagonal lines suggest a feeling of movement or direction. Diagonal lines create a sensation of instability in relation to gravity, being neither vertical nor horizontal, but also because they are not related in a static way to the edges of the artist's paper or canvas. They seem to tip in space. Since the periphery of the eye is sensitive to movement or to any diagonal, its calls for complete attention from the viewer which is why traffic signs designed to warn of hazards are diamond-shaped use diagonals.\n\nIn a two-dimensional composition, diagonal lines are also used to indicate depth, an illusion of perspective that pulls the viewer into the picture, creating an illusion of a space that one could move about within. Thus, if a feeling of movement or speed is desired, or a feeling of activity, diagonal lines can be used. Baroque artists in particular made use of the diagonal line to introduce energy and movement in their works.\n\nAlthough Vermeer's designs are generally thought of as predominantly rectilinear, the artist made continual use of strong, clear diagonals in order to introduce a visual dynamism and confer the sensation of ongoing narrative development. One of the most effective uses of diagonal lines can be found in the Woman Writing a Letter with her Maid. In this picture, a series of three implied diagonal lines superimpose themselves over the rectilinear compositional structure invigorating the narrative tension, wherein the mistress has cast aside a letter she has just received (see the letter and red wax seal on the floor in front of the table) and hastily writes as her maid patiently waits to deliver the letter as soon as it is finished.\n\nDilettante\n\nOriginally, an admirer or lover of the arts, a connoisseur. Or, a dabbler in an art or a field of knowledge; an amateur. Today, \"dilettante\" is more likely to be used in the latter sense, and taken by many—by the listener, even if not by the speaker—as an insult. It was more innocent in its original uses, as derived from the Italian word \"dilettare,\" meaning \"to delight.\" In the 18th century, a dilettante was simply a person who delighted in the arts. Later, the term came to refer to an amateur—someone who cultivates an art as a pastime without pursuing it professionally. From this meaning developed the pejorative sense the word carries now: a person who dabbles in an art\n\nbut is not truly devoted to it.\n\nDisegno vs. Colorito (\"drawing vs. color\" debate)\n\nIn Florence, disegno (\"drawing\" or \"design\") was viewed as the sine qua non of the artistic endeavor, the primary means for making painting approximate nature. Disegno was fundamental for all areas of art in the Renaissance: painting, sculpture and architecture. Although it is believed that the notion of drawing as the foundation for the art of painting and sculpture had been expressed at least as early as Petrarch,Williams, Robert. Art, Theory, and Culture in Sixteenth-Century Italy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997) 16. the art historical concept of disegno \"originated partly in the workshop of sculptors and had direct reference to the plastic quality of a work. Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574), the foremost art critic of the Renaissance, gave the concept its universal form by lumping together all the visual arts as arti del disegno and by initiating the foundation of the Academy of Design (Accademia del Disegno) in Florence in 1562. In Vasari's usage disegno points to the regular form or idea of things in artist's mind, that is, disegno is understood primarily as the right proportion of the whole to its parts and of the parts to one another.\"Undusk, Rein. \"Disegno e colore: Art Historical Reflections on the Structuring of Space.\" Accessed [access date if known]. http://www.eki.ee/km/place/pdf/kp5_03_undusk.pdf. Thus, disegno was considered the key to the entire imaginative process, the medium of the painter's thought and its concrete expression.\n\nOn the other hand, in Venice, colorito, \"coloring\" was not only color but the fundamental means by which painted images could be charged with the look of life. Florentine color was frequently more vivid than the palette used in Venetian paintings; typically Venetian, however, was the process of layering and blending colors to achieve a glowing, natural richness. Rather than beginning with careful drawings where contours are fixed with meticulous certainty, Venetian painters often worked out compositions directly on the canvas, using layered patches of colors and visible brushwork, rather than line, to evoke the sense of space and form. Venetian painters paid much closer attention to the effects of light than the Florentines and used this knowledge to create both movement and volume in composition.\n\nThis debate, which raged throughout the Early Renaissance (c.1400–1490) and the High Renaissance (c.1490–1530) was argued over by many of the leading exponents of academic art, up until the nineteenth century. The debate between the two positions involved theorists as well as artists and regional rivalries as well as aesthetic concerns.\n\nRoger De Piles (1635–1709), a French art critic who gave an important contribution to aesthetics in his Dialogue sur le coloris (\"Dialogue on colours\"), broke with tradition and argued strenuously that color was not simply accidental ornamentation, but the main condition of an object's visibility. Thus color, to de Piles, was part of the natural order of painting.\n\nIt is an attempt to assess the achievement of the major artists since Raphael (1483–1520), De Piles awarded marks out of twenty for each composition, design or drawing, color and expression, De Piles' evaluations have been denigrated after the decline of Classicism, and his ranking is now considered his \"most notorious contribution to criticism\" even though his \"decomposition of the overall quality of the work into four properties was revolutionary and ambitious at the time.\" After an examination of the historical correlation (1736–1960) between prices achieved by their works at auction and the De Pile's evaluation of a list of fifty-six major painters in his own time (with whose work he had acquainted himself as a connoisseur during his travels) the professor of economics Kathryn Graddy concluded that the critic's \"ratings have held up very well,\" better than those of other critics or \"random judgments.\" In sum, \"His [De Piles'] higher-rated artists achieved a greater return than his lower-rated artists.\"Graddy, Kathryn. \"The Extraordinary Art Critic Roger de Piles (1635–1709): An Empirical Analysis of his Rankings and Sale Prices.\" Dissertation, Brandeis University, 2012: 7.\n\nDe Piles' table of artists is reported below. Each painter was given marks from \"0\" to \"18\" in composition, drawing, color and expression which was intended to provide an overview of aesthetic appreciation that hinges upon the balance between color and design. The highest marks went to Raphael, with a slight bias on color for Rubens, a slight bias on drawing for Raphael. Painters who scored very badly in anything but color were Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione (c. 1477/8–1510) and remarkably Caravaggio with \"16\" on color and \"0\" (zero) on expression. Painters who fell far behind Rubens and Raphael but whose balance between color and design was perfect were Lucas van Leyden (1494–1533), Sebastian Bourdon (1616–1671), Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Rembrandt (1606–1669), who is today considered one of the world's greatest draughtsmen, was given a desultory \"6.\"\n\nPainter\n\nComposition\n\nDrawing\n\nColor\n\nExpression\n\nAndrea del Sarto 12 16 9 8 Federico Barocci 14 15 6 10 Jacopo Bassano 6 8 17 0 Giovanni Bellini 4 6 14 0 Sebastian Bourdon 10 8 8 4 Charles Le Brun 16 16 8 16 I Carracci 15 17 13 13 Cavalier D'Arpino 10 10 6 2 Correggio 13 13 15 12 Daniele da Volterra 12 15 5 8 Abraham van Diepenbeeck 11 10 14 6 Il Domenichino 15 17 9 17 Albrecht Dürer 8 10 10 8 Giorgione 8 9 18 4 Giovanni da Udine 10 8 16 3 Giulio Romano 15 16 4 14 Guercino 18 10 10 4 Guido Reni x 13 9 12 Holbein 9 10 16 3 Jacob Jordaens 10 8 16 6 Lucas Jordaens 13 12 9 6 Giovanni Lanfranco 14 13 10 5 Leonardo da Vinci 15 16 4 14 Lucas van Leyden 8 6 6 4 Michelangelo 8 17 4 8 Caravaggio 6 6 16 O Murillo 6 8 15 4 Otho Venius 13 14 10 10 Palma il Vecchio 5 6 16 0 Palma il Giovane 12 9 14 6 Il Parmigianino 10 15 6 6 Gianfrancesco Penni O 15 8 0 Perin del Vaga 15 16 7 6 Sebastiano del Piombo 8 13 16 7 Primaticcio 15 14 7 10 Raphael 17 18 12 18 Rembrandt 15 6 17 12 Rubens 18 13 17 17 Francesco Salviati 13 15 8 8 Eustache Le Sueur 15 15 4 15 Teniers 15 12 13 6 Pietro Testa 11 15 0 6 Tintoretto 15 14 16 4 Titian 12 15 18 6 Van Dyck 15 10 17 13 Vanius 15 15 12 13 Veronese 15 10 16 3 Taddeo Zuccari 13 14 10 9 Federico Zuccari 10 10 8 8\n\nDisks of Confusion/Halations\n\nSee also camera obscura and pointillés.\n\nIn optics, a disk of confusion (also referred to as halation, blur circle, circle of confusion and circle of indistinctness) refers to the effect of non-converging, unfocused light rays that have entered a lens. When light waves don't converge after passing through a lens, they produce a larger optical spot, instead of coming together at a single point, as in the case of a specular highlight.\n\nUnder normal conditions, disks of confusion are not seen with the human eye because \"it quickly shifts focus to the object being momentarily considered so that most persons are unaware that the...eye is focused on a single plane at any given instant. If the eye did not shift focus as quickly as it does one might be able to notice circles of confusion forming on the retina, but experimentation shows that the out-of-focus image formed on the retina is useless for picture-making purposes even if one is aware of its existence.\"Fink, Daniel A. \"Vermeer's Use of the Camera Obscura: A Comparative Study.\" The Art Bulletin 53 (1971): 495.\n\nArt historians have equated certain globular highlights of light-toned paint found in many of Vermeer's paintings with circles of confusion that the artist presumably observed through a camera obscura. These painterly interpretations are called \"pointillés.\" Vermeer made extensive use of pointillés in The Milkmaid although they appear, somewhat rudimental, for the first time scattered in the hair of Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, on the satin bodice and the knobby surface of the foreground Turkish carpet. The View of Delft also presents a profusion of pointillés, many of which, however, would not have registered by a real camera obscura in natural conditions, above all, those that occur within deep shadows such as the undersides of the boats moored on the scene's quay. Pointillés are also very noticeable in the late Lacemaker where they shimmer on the foreground still life. It must be assumed that once Vermeer had understood how the disks of confusion are produced by the camera obscura and how to imitate them with paint, he employed them with considerable artistic license to enhance the effect of light as it plays upon natural surfaces.\n\nAlthough Dutch painters experimented with a number of techniques to represent highlights, which are key to creating the illusion of light conditions (usually intense), on shiny surface textures, only Vermeer adopted circular highlight in a methodical manner. Perhaps the only other instances of such highlights in Dutch painting are those on a pair of slippers in the foreground of Gabriel Metsu's (1629–1667) Woman Reading a Letter, a picture that was likely inspired by Vermeer himself.\n\nThis highly peculiar optical phenomenon in Vermeer's painting was systematically investigated Charles Seymour (\"Dark Chamber and Light-Filled Room: Vermeer and the Camera Obscura,\" Art Bulletin 46, 1964) and Daniel A. Fink (\"Vermeer's Use of the Camera Obscura: A Comparative Study,\" The Art Bulletin 53, 1971). Both writers experimented with actual camera obscuras focused on mock-Vermeer still lifes in attempts to replicate the effects seen in Vermeer's paintings.\n\n\"Dissolute\" Self Portraits by Dutch and Flemish Artists\n\ndrawn from the abstract of:\n\nIngred Cartwright, \"Hoe schilder hoe wilder: Dissolute self-portraits in seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish Art,\" dissertation, University of Maryland, 2007. http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/7720/1/umi-umd-4997.pdf\n\nIn the seventeenth century, Dutch and Flemish artists presented a strange new face to the public in their self portraits. Rather than assuming the traditional guise of the learned gentleman artist that was fostered by renaissance topoi, many painters presented themselves in a more unseemly light. Dropping the noble robes of the pictor doctus, they smoked, drank and chased women. Dutch and Flemish artists explored a new mode of self-expression in dissolute self-portraits, embracing the many behaviors that art theorists and the culture at large disparaged.\n\nDissolute self portraits stand apart from what was expected of a conventional self portrait, yet they were nonetheless appreciated and valued in Dutch culture and in the art market.\n\nDissolute self portraits also reflect and respond to a larger trend regarding artistic identity in the seventeenth century, notably, the stereotype \"hoe schilder hoe wilder\"[\"the more of a painter, the wilder he is,\" a reference that reappears throughout the century, both in print and in paint] that posited Dutch and Flemish artists as intrinsically unruly characters prone to prodigality and dissolution. Artists embraced this special identity, which in turn granted them certain freedoms from social norms and a license to misbehave. In self portraits, artists emphasized their dissolute nature by associating themselves with themes like the Five Senses and the Prodigal Son in the tavern.\n\nDoorkijkje (see-through door)\n\nView of an Interior, or The Slippers (traditional title, given in the 19th century)\n\nSamuel van Hoogstraten\n\nBetween 1654 and 1662\n\nOil on canvas, 103 x 70 cm.\n\nLouvre, Paris\n\nOne of the most effective manners for seventeenth-century Dutch painters for achieving pictorial depth within domestic settings was the so-called doorkijkje, or \"see-through\" doorway which permits the spectator to view something outside the pictured room, whether it be another room, a series of rooms, a hallway, a street, a canal, a courtyard or a garden. The doorkijkje offers the painter an opportunity to create a more complicated architectural space and contemporarily expand narrative.\n\nNicolaes Maes (1634–1693) painted six versions of an idle servant eavesdropping or an encounter between a man and a maidservant glimpsed through an open door. Other examples of the doorkijkje device can be found in Emmanuel De Witte's Interior with a Woman at the Virginals (c. 1660) and Samuel van Hoogstraten's (1627–1678) View of a Corridor (1662) and The Slippers by the same.\n\nHowever, no Dutch artist made use of this device more than Pieter de Hooch (1629–1684) in both interior and exterior scenes. In the Courtyard of a House in Delft, we see it in the sequence of full light on the foreground bricks, contrasting the quieter shade of the covered tiled passageway, and the open door to the sunlit street beyond. The art historian Martha Hollander found that among more than 160 paintings attributed to De Hooch, only twelve do not exhibit this technique of a doorkijkje revealing secondary and tertiary views to other rooms, courtyards or the street beyond.Hollander, Martha. An Entrance for the Eyes: Space and Meaning in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Art ( Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2002) 153.\n\nIt has been pointed out that in the twentieth century, the Italian film director Luchino Visconti, somewhat as seventeenth-century Dutch painters were centuries before, was particularly fond of framing his actors through doorways doors in art and film or, on the contrary, by blocking our view onto another character we would like to see; so deliberately withholding information.Blom, Ivo. \"Frame, space narrative. Doors, windows, and mobile framing in the work of Luchino Visconti.\" Acta Universitatis Sapientiae, series Film & Media Studies 2 (2010): 91–106. http://www.acta.sapientia.ro/acta-film/C2/film2-5.pdf.\n\nIn all, Vermeer painted three doorkijkje motifs: the early A Maid Asleep, The Love Letter and lost work described in a 1696 auction catalogue as \"In which a gentleman is washing his hands in a perspectival room with figures, artful and rare...\" The picture fetched 95 guilders, making it one of the highest-priced works of the auction.\n\nIt is generally believed that Vermeer drew directly from doorkijkje paintings of Nicolaes Maes for his A Maid Asleep while the complicated compositional structure of his late Love Letter can be traced to Van Hoogstraten's The Slippers or Pieter de Hooch's Couple with a Parrot. Although there is obviously no way to envision the lost doorkijkje, after A Maid Asleep Vermeer never again opened a view on another room beyond that in which the scene is set.\n\nDoorsien\n\nDoorsien is a Dutch word that literally means \"plunge through.\" Dutch painters were particularly interested in views into the distance, which they called doorsien. Doorsiens not only enhance the sense of depth in a picture but also helped the artist structure complex scenes with large numbers of figures, convincingly situating them on different planes. The Dutch painter and art theorist Karel van Mander (1548–1606) even criticized Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel because it was lacking in sufficient depth. In his influential Schilder-boeck (Painter book) of 1604, Van Mander wrote:\n\nOur composition should enjoy a fine quality, for the delight of our sense, if we there allow a view [insien] or vista [doorsien] with small background figures and a distant landscape, into which the eyes can plunge. We should take care sometimes to place our figures in the middle of the foreground, and let one see over them for many miles.\n\n\"Although Van Mander used the term doorsien to refer to vistas or views in general, he uses perspect to indicate the more specific context of an architectural setting in which, for example, a receding passageway or colonnade is viewed through an archway. He distinguishes perspecten from the natural opening provided by rocks and trees in landscapes but notes that they have the same effect.\"\n\nMartha Hollander, An Entrance for the Eyes: Space and Meaning in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Art (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2002), 9\n\nDouble Shadow\n\nIn various interiors by Vermeer, evidence exists of another optical phenomenon that reveals the artist's keen interest in capturing the activity of light: the so-called double shadow. These complex shadows are cast on back wall by objects close to it and caused by the light which enters simultaneously from two windows. For example, in The Music Lesson the wider shadow to the right of the black-framed mirror is caused by the near raking light entering from the window closest the background wall. But it is partially weakened—and here the double shadow appears—because light from the second window closer to the spectator enters the room at a less oblique angle and invades the most external part of the wider shadow. In the same picture, the lid of the opened virginal also creates a double shadow. Double shadows are also present in The Concert and A Lady Standing at a Virginal, The Guitar Player and, although more tentatively defined, in some of the artist's earlier interiors. By obscuring one of the two windows all double shadows are avoided.\n\nCuriously, the London architect and Vermeer/camera obscura expert Philip Steadman noted that the widths and angles of the double shadow of the mirror in The Music Lesson are not coherent with the angle of the mirror as it appears in the painting. Since the top of the mirror leans a considerable distance out from the wall, the shadows would have been much wider and more angled and would have appeared as they now do only if the mirror had laid flat against the wall. According to Steadman, the artist evidently wanted to show both the reflection of his own vantage point in the mirror (the painter's easel and canvas can be seen in the reflection) and have the mirror appear to hang in a more normal, near-vertical position, requirements that are obviously incompatible in reality (although they are made to look compatible in the painting).\n\nThe double shadow which descends downward from the window sill in A Lady Standing at a Virginal, however, is not caused by the light of two different windows. Although difficult to understand, the profile of the outermost shadow may have been caused by a building outside Vermeer's studio which blocked some of the light entering the studio. The innermost profile is caused by the light of the sky which descends from a higher angle, blocked by the thickness of the wall above the window frame.\n\nIn Dutch painting double shadows were avoided as much as possible because they tend to create compositions that seem restless and confused. \"It is an evil against which the art experts of Vermeer's time and later were always warning artists. Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627–1678) writes about this in his Inleyding tot de hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst and Gérard de Lairesse (1641–1711) devotes a whole chapter to: 'Van de lichten binnenskamers' (Of Indoor Lighting), which he illustrates with a few examples.\" Other than those of Vermeer, one of the very few careful portrayals of double shadows in Dutch interior painting can be found in Gabriel Metsu's A Man and a Woman Seated by a Virginal (c. 1665), which, however, is a composite of certain aspects of Vermeer's The Music Lesson and The Concert.\n\nDrapery\n\nJudging from the paucity of period art treaties and modern art historical literature that address the topic, one would never think that the representation of drapery has been one of the primary preoccupations in Western art from Classical time onward. In fact, until 1904, it had not been the exclusive subject of any published work.\n\nFor the painter, the movement of drapery is nearly inexhaustible in its variety and capacity to suggest things other than itself. Drapery can be stretched softly to suggest peace, relaxation or the flow of nature, or taut, to suggest tension or alarm. Folded upon itself, drapery may convey shades of passion, confusion, wealth or sensuality. Vertical folds may convey strength while horizontal may convey repose and diagonal folds, movement. Sometimes, drapery seems able to move by its own will. The high number of Renaissance and Baroque figure drawings that show the lavish attention bestowed to the actions of drapery but only a scarce few lines to define the anatomical features which emerge from them attest to the wealth of aesthetic solutions which helped the painter develop narrative and mood. It is impossible to imagine the splendor of color in European easel painting without drapery. The character of painted drapery is strongly linked to both the age in which it is painted and the individual artist who treats it.\n\nBut one of the main attractions of drapery for the painter was technical. In all but the most meticulous forms or realism, the representation of drapery allows freedom in paint handling that other motifs do not, and after the High Renaissance drapery is often painted in a looser stylistic register than that of the figure to which it belongs, without, however, disrupting illusionist verisimilitude. Drapery is, perhaps, more easily imitated with the brush and paint than any other motif. In collaboration with the shape of the brush and the natural flow of paint, the anatomical articulations of the body favor easy, rhythmic back-and-forth movements of the arms and wrist that are particularly adapted for describing the sweeping curves and angular character of drapery's folds and flat planes. For artists who followed Titian's (c. 1488/1490–1576) revolutionary painterly style, drapery provided an opportunity to explore the one-to-one relationship between brush strokes and the thing represented, but it likewise exposed them to the dangers of empty virtuosity.\n\nMembers of the French Academy believed that the depictions of different kinds of fabrics could potentially distract from the essence of painting, some praising the sober manner in which Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665) and Charles Le Brun (1619–1690) had depicted drapery. Velvet, satin or taffeta should be avoided in favor of more generic, non-reflective fabrics. Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), who continued to defend the \"grand style\" of history painting well into the eighteenth century, wrote, \"as the historical painter never enters into the details of colors, so neither does he debase his conceptions with minute attention to the discriminations of drapery. It is the inferior style that marks the variety of stuffs. With him the clothing is neither woolen nor linen, nor silk, satin, nor velvet—it is drapery; it is nothing more.\"\n\nDrapery was a fundamental part of Vermeer's art. He employed colorful costumes to create mood and define the social standing of his sitters. He hung tapestries in the foreground to force spatial depth and energize his compositions. Anonymous tablecloths bridge differently shaped objects and conceal compositional distractions. Richly patterned imported carpets were thrown over tables to create compositional structures, sometimes geometrically shaped, but more frequently sculpted by deep valleys and tortuous folds to evoke the psychological states of his sitters. Their rich reds vibrate against the cool grays and pure blues which dominate the artist's palette. Marieke de Winkel, an expert in seventeenth-century Dutch fashion, published an interesting study regarding the identity and function of the costumes portrayed in Vermeer's scenes.\n\nIt has been long debated if the outward flare of the fur-trimmed morning jackets that appear various times in the interiors of Vermeer is the result of pregnancy or fashion because this would have pivotal importance in assigning meaning to the pictures in which they occur. Some critics have described the colors of Vermeer's costumes, especially those painted with natural ultramarine, and a few have noted how the realistic folds of the works of the 1660s gradually succumb to the heavy stylization of the late works.\n\nDrawing\n\nDrawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surfaces. Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint).\n\nA drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas and board, have been used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard. Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas. The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.\n\nIn addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman\n\nIt seems somewhat surprising that not even a single preparatory or finished drawing by Vermeer has survived. One would expect that such meticulously balanced compositions and problematic perspectives could be most efficiently resolved through preparatory drawings which would allow the artist to easily correct any errors. There were many ways to transfer drawings efficiently and accurately to canvas.\n\nOnly scant traces have remained of the initial drawing methods on Vermeer's canvases although evidence seems to suggest that it was deliberate and controlled.\n\nIt was once thought that Vermeer revealed some of his own working procedures, including his drawing methods, in The Art of Painting. On a toned canvas the artist represented in Vermeer's picture has laid in the contours of the model in white paint or chalk and has begun to paint in various shades of blue the laurel leaves. However, there exist many discrepancies between real working habits seen in representations of painters' studios of the seventeenth century and those illustrated in The Art of Painting. While some of the indications given by The Art of Painting of the painter's technique may be factual, others may have a more symbolic function and, in any case, they do not seem to correspond closely to what were most likely Vermeer's own methods.\n\nDrying Cracks\n\nCurved and wide cracks that occur during the drying stage of the color layers that are a result of the chemical processes and/or physical influences; in the paint layer only. This is one of the major cracks in the paint layer. Also called \"alligatoring.\"\n\nDrying Oil\n\nA drying oil is an oil that hardens to a tough, solid film after a period of exposure to air. The oil hardens through a chemical reaction in which the components crosslink (and hence, polymerize) by the action of oxygen (not through the evaporation of water, turpentine or other solvents). Drying oils are a key component of oil paint and some varnishes. The more drying oil is introduced into paint, the more the paint becomes transparent and glossy. Some commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, poppy seed oil and walnut oil. Each oil has distinct mixing and drying properties and each creates a different type of film when it dries. The use of drying oils has somewhat declined over the past several decades, as they have been replaced by alkyd resins. Nondrying oils are mineral oils and vegetable oils, such as peanut oil and cottonseed oil that resemble animal fats and, because they do not oxidize naturally and harden, are unsuitable as a binder for paint.\n\nDummy Board\n\nSee also trompe l'oeil.\n\nDummy boards (the actual term is a nineteenth-century invention) are life-size flat figures painted on wooden panels and shaped in outline to resemble figures of servants, soldiers, children and animals. On the other side, dummy boards are fitted with a wood support that allows them to stand upright in corners, doorways and on stairways to surprise visitors. The taste for illusionistic painted figures as a form of house decoration probably originated in the trompe-l'œil, or life-like interior scenes painted by Dutch artists in the early seventeenth century. Dummy boards continued to be produced well into the nineteenth century. Many later dummy boards were made by professional sign painters.\n\nDummy boards belong to a wide range of trompe-l'œil devices that were immensely popular in the seventeenth-century Netherlands. A number or artists tried their hands at these \"eye foolers\" (oogenbedriegers), and their works were also in great demand abroad. Cornelius Gijsbrechts (c. 1630–c. 1675), who would become one of the most innovative trompe-l'œil painters in Europe moved to Stockholm in 1672, where he lived for a few years, and then went on to seek his fortune again in Germany. In 1675 he probably resided in Breslau (presently Wroclaw in Poland). The painter and art writer Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627–1678) is noted to have kept many such eye foolers strewn around his house. According to Arnold Houbraken (1660–1719), another Dutch art writer, one could find them practically every where one looked:Brusati, Di Celeste. Artifice and Illusion: The Art and Writing of Samuel Van Hoogstraten. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995) 152.\n\nHere an apple, pear or lemon in a dish rack, three a slipper in the corner of the room or under a chair. There were also dried, salted fish on a nail behind the door, and these were so deceptively painted that one could easily mistake them for the dried plaice.\n\nHoubraken credited Cornelius Bisschop (1630–1674) with being \"the first, if not the best, to paint all manners of images on wood in life-like colors and then cut them out so that they would be placed in a corner or doorway. Houbraken thought that Bisschop's were \"the most natural and witty and inventive examples\" and he claims to have \"seen some that, when in position, deceive the eye and cause people to greet them as though they were real.\" The esteemed portrait painter Johannes Verspronck (between 1600 and 1603–1662) also painted one of the first dummy boards, Boy in his Highchair which is both signed and dated (1654).\n\nDummy boards are a good resource for understanding costume.\n\nDynamic Range\n\nDynamic range describes the ratio between the maximum and minimum measurable light intensities (white and black, respectively). In the real world, one never encounters true white or black—only varying degrees of light source intensity and subject reflectivity. But we can interpret dynamic range as the measurement between the whitest whites and the blackest blacks of an image as captured by a camera, a scanner, a print, a computer display, a painting or the subject itself. Any image created by a device can only record so much detail between the darkest shadows of a scene and the brightest highlights, and eventually will render tones at the end of this scale as an effective black or white simply because there is not enough detail available. Each medium has its own dynamic range, and often the goal is to extend the range of tones in between the maximum and minimum values to create a more full-feeling image, similar to the gradient that runs from pure black to pure white.\n\nAlthough brightness is typically measured in units called candelas per square meter (cd/m2), one of the most functional units is the so-called f-stop, a dimensionless number that refers to the ratio between the diameter of the aperture in the lens and the focal length of the lens. What is important to know, however, is that with each added f-stop the amount of light that passes through the aperture into the camera is doubled, and with each subtracted f-stop, it is halved.\n\nThe human sense of sight is incredibly sensitive to light. It can see objects in bright sunlight or in starlight, even though on a moonless night objects receive 1/1,000,000,000 of the illumination they would on a bright sunny day. Some sources claim that the overall range of brightness that the human eye can see (static range) is equivalent to 20 f-stops while others 24 or even 30, the brightness ratio being roughly 1,000,000:1. In any case, the eyes cannot perform this feat of perception at both extremes of the scale at the same time. They must constantly adapt to higher and lower lighting conditions, altering their sensitivity in order to be responsive at different levels of illumination.\n\nThe range of brightness that the eye can see in a given moment and circumstance is called the dynamic range because, unlike the static range, it is always changing. This adaptation, which is highly localized, is so efficient and so rapid that we are rarely aware of it. One of the most important factors in the process of adaption is the pupil, which regulates the amount of light that enters the eye by widening its diameter (to let more light in) or narrowing it (to protect the eye from too much light). For example, when one looks at a bright sky the pupil becomes very small but it instantaneously opens as we shift our gaze down to a group of shadowed trees below allowing us to make out details of contrast in both points of view. However, to adapt from complete darkness to the very strongest light it takes considerable time for the eyes to adjust, as we all know when we are suddenly woken up after a night's sleep to an open window on a sunny morning.\n\nAlthough the eye can accommodate about 24 f-stops of light over all, it can accommodate only a range of about 1,000:1 at any given moment (i.e., its dynamic range) usually given to be between 10 to 14 f-stops. This range can be calculated when one looks at only one region within a field of view, letting the eyes adjust and not looking anywhere else so that the opening of the eye's pupil remains unchanged. A typical compact digital camera has a dynamic range of about 5 to 7 f-stops while a high-end DSLR camera (Nikon D800) has a dynamic range of about 14.4 f-stops.\n\nAny amateur photographer who has looked at his vacation shots as photographs rather than souvenirs is very familiar with the issue of dynamic range. He finds that in most of his snapshots taken in strong light either the shadowed areas are legible and the lights look washed out, or the contrary, the lights are properly detailed and the shadows are disappointing black splotches. It is usually only by chance the all the objects in his pictures are uniformly detailed in both the lights and shadows. This is not the amateur's fault, it's the camera's. For while the eyes constantly adapt and so give the viewer the experience of being able to perceive nature's full range of brightness, the camera can bracket only a much smaller range of brightness at one moment, that is, its dynamic range. To get a photograph to look approximately like the scene that the photographer actually perceived, he would either have to purchase a sturdy tripod and HDRI software or become a very good painter. For example, the Italianate Landscape (1650–1683) by Nicolaes Beechen (1620–1683) exhibits tonal variety detail in both the lights and the shadows even though the outdoors scene must have had an enormously large range of brightness. Everything looks utterly natural as if we were standing next to the painter immersed in the deep shade of the soaring hillside looking out towards the distant horizon and a wondrously luminous blue sky tainted only with a few fluffy clouds. To approximate the effect of Berchem's landscape in photography it would be necessary to take multiple photographs from Berchem's viewpoint with varying shutter speed/aperture combinations in order to produce a set of images with varying luminosity and depth of field—and then process them with HDRI software.\n\nIn any case, one can easily intuit the difficulties faced by a painter who wishes to accommodate the range of natural luminosity in his painting when we think that the dynamic range of a room like that in Vermeer's Music Lesson may be approximately 12 f-stops while that of his paints are only about 5 f-stops. Notwithstanding the limits of their \"poor\" paints, artists have been able to produce convincing illusions of almost any light found in nature, except for the sun.\n\nEarth Colors\n\nEarth colors are pigments that are obtained by mining; usually metal oxides. Earth colors do not show up on the color wheel. Some earth colors can be created by mixing two complementary colors or combining a pure color with white, black, or gray, but naturally occurring earth pigments produce paints that have specific, highly desirable handling and coloring characteristics that mixtures of bright colors do not. Earth colors are also easy to come by, relatively easy to prepare and thus, inexpensive. Earth colors include yellow ochre, raw sienna, raw umber, green earth, Cassel earth, Van Dyck brown, various shades of black and even blue ochre (Vivianite). When some earth colors are heated appropriately they produce different and highly useful and unmixable colors such as burnt, sienna, burnt umber and red ochre.\n\nWhile most earth colors can be produced synthetically, naturally occurring iron oxide pigments generally preferred by artists because they are inherently more translucent and offer some warm, rich qualities. Because they are natural they are variable in composition and physical properties, which can result in significant color variances. While this natural modulation is of great allure to artists, natural variability can cause paint makers some concern.\n\nEasel & Easel Painting\n\nAn easel is an upright frame for displaying or supporting a canvas while the painter is at work. Easels are made of wood and have various designs. The most common in Vermeer's time was the tripod easel which had three legs. Variations include crossbars to make the easel more stable. The height of the movable front crossbar could be adjusted by means of pegs inserted in regularly staggered hole along the two front legs. This feature allowed the painter to work comfortably with both small and large canvases while seated or standing. Most paintings that represent artists in their studios show them working while seated. In an early painting by Rembrandt (1606–1669) of an artist at work, perhaps a self portrait, the lower, fixed support bar bears two indentations where the artist presumably rests his feet while working. Typically, the tripod easel is fully adjustable to accommodate for different angles. Furthermore, when they are collapsed, this type of easel becomes very slim and can be fit in small spaces around the studio.\n\nIt is only around 1600 that the Dutch word ezel, meaning donkey, begins to appear in written sources used in the secondary sense of a stand for supporting paintings. By mid-century, English and German had adopted this use of the Dutch word as well, and the easel painting was well on its way to becoming the quintessential modern work of art.Powell, Amy. \"Painting as Blur: Landscapes in Paintings of the Dutch Interior.\" Oxford Art Journal 33.2 (2010): 146.\n\nAn easel painting is a painting that is small enough to be comfortably executed on an easel. Easel painting became pre-eminent in the sixteenth century and has remained so. It is likely that easel paintings were known to the ancient Egyptians, and the first-century-AD Roman scholar Pliny the Elder refers to a large panel placed on an easel; it was not until the thirteenth century, however, that easel paintings became relatively common, finally superseding in popularity the mural or wall painting. The term implies not only physical aspects but also inherent concepts that are very different from those associated with wall paintings or those intended for a fixed position or an architectural scheme.\n\nEasel painting is therefore associated with the increased secular use of art from the sixteenth century and with the identification of paintings as objects of worth in their own right. The rise of easel painting involved a subtle assertion of the independence of the art of painting and the profession of the painter. The status afforded to painting in the writings of, for example, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519)and Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) reflects these developments and anticipates the increased social and intellectual status of the individual artist. Being highly transportable, easel paintings were easy to buy and sell, easel painting facilitated the growth of the art market.\n\n\"Almost all our knowledge about the ownership of easel paintings in the seventeenth-century Netherlands comes from information gathered upon death or in anticipation of death in probate inventories. As far as those inventories are concerned, one painting is pretty much like the next and one painting's front is pretty much like its back. That is to say, in the inventories of all but the wealthiest seventeenth-century Dutch collectors, paintings are usually listed without reference even to subject matter—simply as 'a panel', 'a painting', 'two paintings with ebony frames', as if the notary were looking at them from behind. Sometimes minimal indications of genre are given, such as 'a portrait', 'a landscape', or 'a pot of flowers', but attributions to specific artists are very rare.' Work by the dozen [dosijn werk]' is the expression used to designate paintings of especially poor quality. And many of these inventoried paintings were indeed sold by the dozen, i.e., in lots on the auction block.\"Powell, Amy. 2010: 153–154.\n\nEkphrasis\n\n\"One particular kind of visual description is also the oldest type of writing about art in the West. Called ekphrasis, it was created by the Greeks. The goal of this literary form is to make the reader envision the thing described as if it were physically present. In many cases, however, the subject never actually existed, making the ekphrastic description a demonstration of both the creative imagination and the skill of the writer. For most readers of famous Greek and Latin texts, it did not matter whether the subject was actual or imagined. The texts were studied to form habits of thinking and writing, not as art historical evidence.\n\n\"In the second half of the eighteenth century, ekphrastic writing suddenly appeared in a new context. Travelers and would-be travelers provided a growing public eager for vivid descriptions of works of art. Without any way of publishing accurate reproductions, appearances had to be conveyed through words alone. William Hazlitt, John Ruskin, and Walter Pater, to name three great nineteenth-century writers in English, published grand set-pieces of ekphrasis about older as well as contemporary art. For them, the fact that the object existed mattered a great deal. The goal of these Victorian writers was to make the reader feel like a participant in the visual experience. The more convincingly this was done, the more effective the writing was judged to be.\"Munsterberg, Marjorie. \"Ekphrasis.\" Writing About Art. http://writingaboutart.org/pages/ekphrasis.html.\n\nEll\n\nThe length represented by the Dutch ell was the distance of the inside of the arm (i.e. the distance from the armpit to the tip of the fingers), an easy way to measure length. The Dutch \"ell,\" which varied from town to town (55–75 cm.), was somewhat shorter than the English ell (114.3 cm). A section of measurements is given below:\n\none Hague ell or standard ell (Haagse of gewone el) = 69.425 cm.\n\none Amsterdam ell (Amsterdamse el) = 68.78 cm.\n\none Brabant ell (Brabantse el) = 69.2 cm. or 16 tailles\n\none Delft ell (Delfsche el) = 68.2 cm.\n\none Goes ell (Goesche el) = 69 cm.\n\none Twente ell (Twentse el) = 58.7 cm.\n\nIn 1725 the Hague ell was fixed as the national standard for tax purposes and from 1816 to 1869, the word el was used in the Netherlands to refer to the meter. In 1869 the word meter was adopted and the ell disappeared both as a word and as a unit of measurement.\n\nEmblem/Emblematic Literature\n\nA picture associated with a motto, usually moralizing in tone. An example is a popular print showing King Midas, unable to eat because his touch turns everything to gold, accompanied by the words \"both rich and poor.\" For the new subject matter of seventeenth-century realism—landscape, still life and genre—an established metaphorical tradition such as the Bible and classical literature used in history painting was lacking. \"To make up for it, artists started to make use of the popular emblematical literature. The first emblems were published in Italy in the early sixteenth century. Their composition was a literary genre among humanists: by finding apt combinations of image and text they could show off their metaphorical inventiveness and wit. The genre spread quickly and became immensely popular. In Holland, it was soon employed by Calvinist moralists like Johan de Brune who realized the didactic value of a concrete image explained by concise text.\"Fuchs, R. H. Dutch Painting. London: W W Norton & C, 1976: 38.\n\nThe Dutch were exceptionally literate and religious and moral commitment was central to their literature. It is said that the works of the didactic poet Jacob Cats were in every Dutch home, alongside the Bible. Essentially, the aim of the emblem was to make morality more attractive. Emblematic meaning,s as well as motifs derived from emblem books, frequently appear in Dutch paintings. However, it must be remembered that even though connections between emblem books and painting are generally accepted, there exist no texts of the period which specifically associates paintings with didactic intention.\n\nThe Emblem Project Utrecht website currently includes 27 Dutch love emblem books, religious as well as profane. Each book has a full transcriptions, page facsimiles, indexes and extended search options. Links to sources and parallels, translations and annotation are being added.\n\nScholars have related various paintings of Vermeer to existing prints in contemporary emblem books which were accompanied by mottoes. While much knowledge has been gained by investigating these associations, important questions remain unanswered. One example of the difficulty in interpreting emblematic meaning may be seen in the Woman Standing at a Virginal. In 1967, Eddy de Jongh (\"On Balance\" in Vermeer Studies, 1998) proposed an interpretation of the picture in relation to one such emblem with the motto \"A lover ought to love only one\" in Otto van Veen's emblem book of 1608, Amorum Emblemata. In Vermeer's picture, a painting representing a Cupid holds aloft a card can be closely related to Van Veen's print. However, in Van Veen's print, the Cupid stands with one foot on another card with multiple numbers that are missing in Vermeer's representation. De Jongh wrote: \"Although the card of the painted amor is blank and the card with the other ciphers is missing is itself missing, there can be no doubt that Vermeer had been inspired by the very same notion when he painted the woman at the virginal.\" However, about 20 years later De Jongh readdressed the issue: \"I restate the hypothesis that Vermeer was thinking of Van Veen's meaning when he conceived his painting. This hypothesis, however, does not solve very much. For even if the emblematic meaning of any passage may be correctly identified, the crucial question is: how did the painter intend the inserted moral to function?\"Gaskell, Ivan. Vermeer's Wager (Essays in Art and Culture) ( London: Reaktion Books, 2000) 44.\n\nEmphasis\n\nEmphasis is any forcefulness that gives importance or dominance (weight) to some feature or features of an artwork; something singled out, stressed, or drawn attention to by means of contrast, anomaly, or counterpoint for aesthetic impact. A way of combining elements to stress the differences between those elements and to create one or more centers of interest in a work. Often, emphasized elements are used to direct and focus attention on the most important parts of a composition—its focal point. Emphasis is one of the principles of design. A design lacking emphasis may result in monotony.\n\nEmulation & Imitation\n\n\"The familiar premium that contemporary Western society places on artistic originality is actually a fairly recent phenomenon. Among the concepts renaissance artists most valued were imitation and emulation. Although Renaissance artists did develop unique, recognizable styles, convention, in terms of both subject matter and representational practices, predominated.\"Gardner, Di Helen, Kleiner, Fred S., and Mamiya, Christin J. Gardner's Art Through The Ages: The Western Perspective, 12th edition. (Belmont California: Cengage Learning, 2006) 431. Imitation and emulation, (Latin; imitatio and aemulatio) both abandoned in modern studio practices, were key concepts in artistic training. Only when the artist had learned to imitate, then emulate, could he finally invent.\n\nUntil the mid-eighteenth century, imitation was considered the first, and absolutely indispensable step to becoming a fully developed artist. Imitation was largely based on the concept of classical rhetoric. By imitating (copying) prints, drawings and paintings of the great Italian masters of the Cinquecento (exceedingly little painting had survived from the Greek and Roman times) fledging artists contemporarily stored up knowledge and trained the mind and hand. Emulation was also known to the ancients, Virgil had supposedly emulated Homer \"in the race of honour.\"\n\nEven the greatest artists copied and imitated the work of their colleagues. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) filled his sketchbooks with of well-known sculptures and frescoes while Michelangelo spent days sketching artworks in churches around Florence and Rome. Philip IV gave Rubens (1577–1640) extraordinary permission to make scale copies of Titian (c. 1488/1490–1576) paintings in the Royal collection that had to be taken off the walls and brought to a temporary studio set up for Rubens.\n\nThe limits of imitation were often debated. The Dutch art theorist Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627–1678) raccounts that \"Rubens was once reproached for borrowing whole figures from the Italians to which he even sent draftsmen to Italy to bring back examples. Rubens supposedly responded to this criticism by saying, 'They are free to do the same, if they see any advantage in it', thereby suggesting that not everyone was capable of benefiting from imitation.\"Sluijter, Eric Jan. Rembrandt and the Female Nude ( Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2006:) 263.\n\nThe Dutch referred to imitation, both in the sense of stealing and benign borrowing with the same term, rapen. Good rapen consisted in borrowing from various sources—Seneca's oft-quoted phrase recommended artists to draw from numerous sources as bees take honey from a host of flowers—the fusing them together with one's own genius in a manner that none of the borrowings were evident. Karel van Mander (1548–1606), playing upon the double meaning of the word rapen as both \"borrowing\" and \"turnip,\" wrote that \"what is stolen must be welded, molded in the mind as though it were stewed in a pot, and prepared and served with the sauce of ingenuity if it is to prove flavourful.\"Sluijter, Eric Jan. 2006: 253.\n\nOnce the artist in training had acquired sufficient technical means through imitation, he could move on to emulation which was considered improving on the works of established and recognized masters. It was firmly believed that only by knowing the strengths of the previous masters could a painter successfully complete and surpass them. Emulation, therefore, was not the mere slavish imitation of exemplary work of past masters: the artist must strive to emulate their powers of invention. Thus, emulation was considered a key to artistic process progress.\n\n\"Tiepolo, for example, was known as a great emulator of Veronese—as was his Venetian predecessor Sebastiano Ricci 1659–1734). What did that mean in terms of his own \"original\" artistic production? Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (1696–1770) never copied Paolo Veronese (1528–1588) per se, but many compositions of his depend on Veronese for narrative structure, figure types, color, etc. What made him a great emulator, someone never accused of being a mere imitator as was Ricci, was that Veronese was a point of departure, a creative spark that Tiepolo fanned with his own manner and energy. He needed Veronese, in a way, as a place to begin, but it was never where he ended.\"Mayernik, David. \"All Art is Derivative.\" Emulation website, 12 January 2010. http://emulatio.blogspot.it/2010/01/all-art-is-derivative.html.\n\nHowever, there was less agreement as to whether one might emulate only one or more masters. \"Having first practiced drawing for a while…' Cennino Cellini (c. 1370–1440) recommended young artists to …\" take pains and pleasure in constantly copying the best things which you can find done by the hands of the great masters. And if you are in a place where many good masters have been, so much the better for you. But I give you this advice; take the best one every time, and the one who has the greatest reputation.\" Cennini, however, warned against imitating more than one master because the practitioner's mind would become \"distracted\"and \"you would not get either right.\"\n\nToday, cutting-edge art institutions discourage both imitation and emulation. Students rarely make copies whether they be by past or contemporary masters. On the other hand, since modern (ambitious) figurative painters, who work in relative isolation, are rarely concerned with complex narratives or compositions, they tend to emulate only the technical features of great artists of the past. The most frequently emulated artists range from John Singer Sargeant (1856–1925), to William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825–1905), Diego Velázquez (1599–1660) and at times, Rembrandt (1606–1669).\n\nEngraving & Etching\n\nWoodcut, engraving and etching were the principal methods of making prints before the invention of photography. To make an engraving, a plate, usually of copper, is cut with a burin (a sharp gouging tool). The plate is put in a press and ink rolled onto it. The ink is retained in the cuts and transferred to the paper.\n\nSome of the paintings, such as the Netherlandish landscape, are connected with specific engravings by other artists.\n\nThe advantage of etching over engraving is that the lines can be made with something of the freedom of drawing.\n\nNot even a single engraving, etching or even drawing by Vermeer's hand has survived nor does there exist any historical evidence that they had ever existed.\n\nEn Plein Air\n\nfrom Wikipedia:\n\nEn plein air (Fr.: outdoors) is the act of painting outdoors. This method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules that might create a predetermined look.\n\nArtists had to some extent painted outdoors, but in the mid-nineteenth century, working in natural light became particularly important to the Barbizon school, Hudson River School, and Impressionists. The Newlyn School in England is considered another major proponent of the technique in the later nineteenth century. The popularity of painting en plein air increased in the 1840s with the introduction of paints in tubes (like those for toothpaste). Previously, painters made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil.\n\nThe act of outdoor painting from observation has been continually popular well into twenty-first century. It was during the mid-nineteenth century that the box easel, typically known as the French box easel or field easel, was invented. It is uncertain who developed it, but these highly portable easels with telescopic legs and built-in paint box and palette made it easier to go into the forest and up the hillsides. Still made today, they remain a popular choice (even for home use) since they fold up to the size of a brief case and thus are easy to store.\n\nThe Pochade Box is a compact box that allows the artist to keep all of their supplies and palette within the box and have the work on the inside of the lid. Some designs allow for a larger canvas which can be held by clamps built into the lid. There are designs that can also hold a few wet painting canvases or panels within the lid. These boxes have a rising popularity as while they are mainly used for plein air painting, can also be used in the studio, home, or classroom. Since pochade boxes are mainly used for painting on location, the canvas or work surface may be small, usually not more than 20 inches (50 cm.)\n\nChallenges include the type of paint used to paint outdoors, animals, bugs, onlookers and environmental conditions such as weather. Acrylic paint may harden and dry quickly in warm, sunny weather and it cannot be reused. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the challenge of painting in moist or damp conditions with precipitation. The advent of plein air painting predated the invention of acrylics. The traditional and well-established method of painting en plein air incorporates the use of oil paint.\n\n\"Every painter paints himself\"\n\nItalian - \"Ogni pittore dipinge sè\"\n\nDutch - \"zoo de man was, was zyn werk\"\n\n\"Ogni pittore dipinge sè\" is a Tuscan proverb that can be found for the first time in Italian literature between 1477 and 1479. The proverb does not seem to have existed in the Middle Ages although Marsilio Ficino, Thomas Aquinas and Cicero have all addressed the issue of the artist's reflection in his work. In reference to \"every painter paints himself\" modern scholars employ the term \"automimesis.\"\n\n\"Every painter paints himself\" refers not to deliberate self-portraiture but to the artist who creates himself involuntarily in his work. At least from the middle of the sixteenth century onwards, it was associated with natural inclination or inborn talent and had implications that were generally positive. The specific proverb is attributed to various figures including Michelangelo and Gerolamo Savonarola. Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) may well have taken it quite literally, as his portrait of Emperor Maximilian I is said to bear the artist's superimposed features.Campbell, Lorne. Renaissance Portraits: European Portrait Painting in the 14th, 15th and 16th Centuries ( New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1990) 14–16. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), however, was the most articulate in addressing this proverb: \"the soul,\" wrote Leonardo, \"predetermines for the artist's hand the shape of a man on canvas.\"Jahosky, Michael Thomas. \"Some marvelous thing: Leonardo, Caterina, and the Madonna of the rocks\" (2010). Graduate School Theses and Dissertations. http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1666.\n\nSavonarola commented:\n\nAnd one says that every painter paints himself. He does not indeed paint himself as man because he produces images of lions, horses, men and women which are not identical with himself, but he paints himself as painter, that is according to his concept (concetto). And although there are different fantasies and figures of the painters who are painting, they are nevertheless all [done] according to his concept.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the equivalent phrase \"zoo de man was, was zyn werk\" appears, again, as a positive statement about the artist's natural abilities and is found in the writings of leading Dutch biographers and theorists including Karel van Mander (1548–1606) and Cornelis de Bie (1627–1715). Draughtsman and engraver Jan de Bisschop (1628–1671) echoed the idea when he stated that \"each man often times paints his own manners and activities.\"Cartwright, Ingred. \"Hoe schilder hoe wilder: Dissolute self-portraits in seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish Art.\" Dissertation, University of Maryland, 2007: 66. http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/7720/1/umi-umd-4997.pdf.\n\nLikewise, the Dutch Renaissance man and art lover Constantijn Huygens (1596–1687) wrote that a portrait was \"a summary of the whole man, of his body as well as his spirit.\"The concept was even applied to the brushstrokes used to create portraits, something that poet Jan Vos (1610–1667) noted when he wrote of one painter: \"But to my distress, as loose as your painting are you.\"Westermann, Mariët. \"Steen's Comic Fictions.\" In exh. cat. Jan Steen: Painter and Storyteller (Washington: National Gallery of Art, 1996) 61.\n\nArt historians have long remarked that Vermeer is one of the most self-effacing painters of all times. The artist-art historian Lawrence Gowing summarized the problem of comprehending the Vermeer and his work when he wrote: \"What kind of man was Vermeer? Here is the ambiguity. We may examine the pictures from corner to corner and still be uncertain. It seems as if he was of a god-like detachment, more balanced, more civilized, more accomplished, and more immune from the infection of his time than any painter before or since\"\n\nExhibition/Art Exhibition\n\nSee also, Blockbuster Exhibition and Exhibition Catalogue\n\nAn art exhibition is the space in which art objects meet an audience, universally understood to be for a temporary period, making it fundamentally different from an art collection. In American English, exhibitions may be called \"exhibit,\" \"exposition\" (the French word) or \"show.\" In UK English, they are always called \"exhibitions\" or \"shows\" and an individual item in the show is an \"exhibit.\" Art expositions may present pictures, drawings, video, sound, installation, performance, interactive art, new media art or sculptures by individual artists, groups of artists or collections of a specific form of art.\n\nThe artworks may be presented in museums, art halls, art clubs or private art galleries, or at some place the principal business of which is not the display or sale of art, such as a coffeehouse. An important distinction is noted between those exhibits where some or all of the works are for sale, normally in private art galleries, and those where they are not, such as public museums. Sometimes the event is organized on a specific occasion, like a birthday, anniversary or commemoration, but often important exhibitions are almost always organized around a historic period, geographical location, artist, group of artists, art movement, theme or a combination of these features. Sometimes exhibitions are simply works from drawn from a private collection or public institution.\n\nExhibitions often present the occasion to assemble works together that are dispersed throughout the globe and have never been shown together, allowing curators and the public to make more meaningful comparisons between them. Interpretive exhibitions require carefully managed context. They are often accompanied by explanatory panels, illustrated catalogues and, occasionally, interactive displays to aid the visitor's understanding of background and concepts. Major exhibitions are overseen by a curator who, along with other specialists, write illustrated exhibition catalogues, both of which may require considerable expense and years of research and planning.\n\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, it is known that artists exhibited their works prior to being installed in public buildings, although the works shown were considered offerings to deities rather than for public enjoyment or education. Later, in the Middle Ages the situation remained the same but by the seventeenth century, artists began to stage rudimentary exhibitions in artistic capitals such as Rome, Venice and Florence in conjunction with\n\nreligious celebrations, and it was during this time that artists realized they could use these exhibitions to help establish their own reputations. However, the art exhibition as we know it began to play a crucial part in the market for new art since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nL'Acadèmie de Peinture et de Sculpture in Paris was responsible for the state's educational program in the fine arts held its first exhibition in 1667 for the court society only, but by 1725 the exhibition moved to the Louvre and was open to the general public where it became known simply as the Salon, It rapidly became the key factor in determining the reputation, and so the price, of the works of French artists. The Royal Academy of London soon established a similar influence on the market, and in both countries artists strove to produce artworks that would meet approval, often changing the direction of their style to meet popular or critical taste. The British Institution was added to the London scene in 1805, holding two annual exhibitions, one of new British art for sale. These exhibitions received lengthy and detailed reviews in the press, which were the main vehicle for the art criticism of the day. Among the most important exhibitions are; Paris Salon, 1824, The Salon des Refusés, 1863, The first \"Impressionists\" show, 1874, The first Salon d'Automne, 1903, the Armory Show, 1913, Degenerate Art, 1937 and The 9th Street Art Exhibition, 1951.\n\nFollowing Vermeer's rediscovery in the mid-1850s over 320 exhibitions have been staged with one or more of his paintings, the earliest recorded being 1838. Most of these exhibitions featured works of other painters although a few only works by Vermeer. The 1995–1996 exhibit in Washington/The Hague (see image above-left) with 21 paintings by Vermeer remains among the most ambitious—it is highly probable that even during Vermeer's lifetime so many paintings were never on view in the same environment—and visited art exhibitions ever staged (attendance, 327,551). The exhibition drew extraordinary crowds, and free passes were required for admission at all times. Lines for daily passes grew longer each morning. Beginning on November 24, hours were extended until 7 p.m. every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and from February 1, until 9 p.m. each night.\n\nFor a complete list of exhibitions that featured one or more paintings by Vermeer, click here.\n\nFor a list of exhibitions by individual pictures, click here.\n\nExhibition Catalogue\n\nSee also, Blockbuster Exhibition and Exhibition/Art Exhibition\n\nAn exhibition catalogue documents the contents of an art exhibition, ideally providing a forum for critical dialogue between curators, artists and critics. The notion of a separate catalogue of text and labels dates back to nineteenth-century French Salons. Today, exhibition catalogues printed by major art institutions can be far more detailed than the catalogues of their permanent collections and take the form of substantial books, with hundreds of illustrations and pages becoming comprehensive sources for even rather large subject areas.\n\nCatalogues may range in scale from a single printed sheet to a lavish hardcover \"coffee table books.\" The advent of more economical color printing in the 1960s spawned large-scale catalogues. The largest were produced were in the 1970s, with some that contained over a thousand pages. This trend was led in Britain, and in the United States by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Such catalogues typically require years of research and planning to produce and are often written by more than one art specialist, each one covering different areas of research.\n\nDue to the economic downturns, the fortune of the exhibition catalogue has been seriously redimensioned. For example, rather than a traditional printed catalogue, the Philadelphia Museum of Art posted a digital \"gallery guide\" for its exhibition Picasso and the Avant-Garde in Paris, allowing online visitors to visit the exhibition remotely. Other museums opted for mini-catalogues, generally for smaller exhibitions. Production costs of a 250–300 page catalogue ranged from $150,000 to $250,000. Thus, while the museums that stage the exhibitions would prefer e-books to traditional paper catalogues for economical reasons, those who lend artworks frequently demand a catalogue and reproduction rights for their pictures—the holders of copyright are reluctant to give permission for digital publishing for fear of high-resolution images being pirated. It is often held that the value of works prominently featured in grand exhibition catalogues may increase their economic value.\n\nFalse Attachment\n\nFalse attachment is a term that describes an optical phenomenon whereby a part of one object is juxtaposed near a second object in such a manner that the lines, shapes or tones of the separate objects seem to join up with the result that they appear to occupy the same plane, thereby creating spatial ambiguity. The false attachment is a popular trick practiced by the amateur photographer who manipulates the pose of his friend in his camera's viewfinder so that he will appear to engage an unlikely object in the distant background, such as a Ferris wheel or another large object. But architects and painters are always taught to avoid them because they corrupt three-dimensional spatial reading.\n\nFalse attachments are found abundantly dispersed throughout Vermeer's oeuvre. Some of the most striking are those found in the Woman with a Lute, Young Woman Holding a Pitcher, The Love Letter and The Art of Painting. There are used with such insistence that they must have been rationally determined so we can reasonably presume that the artist was indeed interested in how flat shapes relate to one another on the picture plane, a consideration that was not a part of a seventeenth-century composition.\n\nAlthough false attachments appear from time to time in the work of other interior painters, most seem to be casual occurrences. A few, perhaps, were influenced by Vermeer, such as those in Gabriel Metsu's (1629–1667) Man Writing a Letter (c. 1664–1666) and Sick Child (c. 1664–1666), both pictures which have been traditionally linked to Vermeer's single figured works of the 1660s for their evident affinities in compositional organization and light. Another work, Sentimental Conversation (early 1660s) by Quirijn van Brekelenkam ( (1622/29–1669/79), features a carefully composed domestic interior in which the lower corner of a large ebony-framed landscape fits snugly against the gentleman's right-hand profile just as one might have expected from Vermeer.\n\nFame\n\nGreat reputation and recognition; renown. Fame is known to sometimes be a mixed blessing and can be confused with notoriety or clever marketing. Fame has always been considered as one of the fundamental motivations for artists of all types. Since classical times it was understood that great artists brought fame not only to themselves but to their native city and country. Renaissance artists strove to achieve the fame and memory of the great artists of antiquity by creating works that would be admired for their religious piety, classical erudition, beauty and naturalism.\n\nArtistic fame generally suggests being valued in one's own lifetime as well as leaving a significant trace of their art for posterity. Immanuel Kant gave three standards for great art that stand the test of time: 1) originality (the first of its kind in a certain style), 2) exemplarity (others will want to imitate that style) and 3) inimitability (the art is so unique that others won't really be able to imitate it). Sometimes, perhaps more so in modern times, fame has to do as much with the quality of one's artistic production as with the persona of the artist. To offer a notable example, Pablo Picasso (1881–1973).\n\nfrom the National Gallery website:\n\nThe role artists played in enhancing the fame of their homeland and their native city was profoundly appreciated in the Netherlands. This concept, one of the subthemes of Giorgio Vasari' s(1511–1574) influential Lives of the Artists, was given a northern flavor by Karel van Mander (1548–1606) in his Het Schilderboeck (The Book of Painting) of 1604. It also figured in the individual histories of Dutch cities published during the seventeenth century, including Dirck van Bleyswijck's Beschryvinge der Stadt Delft (Description of the City of Delft), published in 1667, the very year that Vermeer executed The Art of Painting painting. It is appropriate that Clio holds her trumpet, a symbol of fame, directly beneath a view of the Hof in The Hague, the seat of government. It is also telling that the artist has begun his painting by depicting Clio's laurel wreath, a symbol of honor and glory.\n\nBleyswijck commented that artists bring glory and distinction to their respective cities, but he lamented that too often fame comes to them only after death. Bound by convention to limit his praise to artists already deceased, Bleyswijck listed Vermeer only as one of the artists active in Delft; he did not include one word about Vermeer's work. To the reader of this history of Delft, Vermeer remains as indistinguishable from his contemporaries as the artist in this painting. Indeed, while Vermeer probably depicted his artist from the rear to assert the universality of his allegory, he may also have done so to emphasize the anonymity experienced by the artist during his lifetime even as he brings fame and glory to his homeland.\n\nFaux\n\nfrom Art Glossary of Terms: The Art History Archive:\n\nFrench for false, artificial, fake. English speakers say \"faux\" to give a high-toned quality to what is often an imitation of a natural material—leather, fur, metal, or stone for example. Although faux materials are usually less expensive than the real thing, there can be other advantages to them: durability, uniformity, weight, color and availability perhaps. There can be allegorical advantages too (falsity can have its purposes!) particularly when juxtaposed with opulence. Faux finishes are painted simulations of other materials—the look of their colors and textures. Examples include stones (marble, granite, sandstone, malachite, porphyry, serpentine, lapis, etc.), wood (also called faux bois—false wood), masonry, and metal (gold, silver and bronze, along with all of their potential patinas). A faux marble might be a substitute like terrazzo or scagliola, each of which employs marble dust in a plaster binder to result in a hard material that will take a polish. See the article on \"marbling\" for a discussion of marbling papers as well as faux-marbling as a painting technique.\n\nVarious faux finishes appear in Vermeer's paintings, including the black ebony frames—the Dutch were particularly adept at imitating exotic imported woods—and the marble slabs of the virginals of his A Lady Standing at a Virginal and A Lady Seated at a Virginal.

A small number were well known in their native Holland or (Flanders, although they never enjoyed international distinction. These artists include such figures as genre/portrait painter Judith Leyster (1609 –1660) and watercolorist Margaretha de Heer. An even smaller group, including still life specialists Maria van Oosterwyck (1630–1693)and Rachel Ruysch (1664–1750), won international artistic recognition. Their accomplishments were discussed in the major biographies of Netherlandish painters by Arnold Houbraken (1660–1719) and Johan van Gool, and their work attracted the patronage of European nobility.\n\nUnlike Italy, France and Spain, where artwork was almost exclusively made-to-order for the very wealthy, in seventeenth-century Holland, art became a portable commodity affordable to the middle class. This development encouraged a diversity of subjects and techniques, and consequentl,y Dutch painters were the first Europeans to develop fully the genres of still life, seascape, townscape, landscape and scenes from everyday life.\n\nWomen artists, how"
