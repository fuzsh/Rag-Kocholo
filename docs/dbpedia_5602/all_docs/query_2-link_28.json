        "text": "Carolyn Giardina, contributing tech editor for The Hollywood Reporter and editor of THR‘s Behind the Screen blog, will receive the Robert Wise Award at the American Cinema Editors’ 65th ACE Eddie Awards on Jan. 30 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The award is presented to a journalist, who in the judgment of the ACE board of directors, has elevated public consciousness to the crucial role of editing in the filmmaking process.\n\nACE, the honorary society of motion picture editors founded in 1950, also announced today that it will honor veteran editors Diane Adler and Jerry Greenberg with Lifetime Career Achievement Awards. As previously announced, producer Frank Marshall has been tapped to receive the ACE Golden Eddie Filmmaker of the Year Award.\n\n“Diane Adler, Jerry Greenberg and Carolyn Giardina represent the best in their fields,” the ACE board of directors said in making the announcement. “It’s not only their tremendous contributions to film, television and journalism that warrant recognition, it is their tireless dedication to their craft — the tenacity each of them has shown is the kind of energy and dedication that our organization thrives on and delights in recognizing in these outstanding and deserving honorees.”\n\nRead more Frank Marshall to Receive American Cinema Editors’ Golden Eddie Award\n\nAs a member of the Hollywood Post Alliance board, Giardina is co-founder of the Hollywood Post Alliance Awards. She is co-author of Exploring 3-D, which examines the use of depth in storytelling, and a winner of the 2011 International Cinematographers Guild’s Technicolor William A. Fraker Award. Since 2013, she also has served as editorial consultant for ACE’s in-house publication, CinemaEditor.\n\nAdler has worked as an editor on such classic TV series as The Rockford Files, Spencer: For Hire and Kojack and has held various leadership roles within ACE and the Motion Picture Editors Guild. Adler, who retired in 1990, also worked on such series as Bret Maverick, Riptide, Hunter and The Rousters and such features as The Presidio."
