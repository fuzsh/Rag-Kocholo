When Dharun Ravi was told by his roommate that he\n\nwanted their dorm room for himself for a few hours so that he could\n\nhave relations, Ravi’s reaction was “yeah”.\n\nRavi soon decided to allegedly become the roommate from hell. Ravi\n\nleft behind a webcam connected as he exited the room, claim police. He\n\nended to another Rutgers room. There he remotely accessed the webcam,\n\nput Tyler online via live streaming video, captured pictures, posted\n\nthe pictures, activated a chat room for discussed, and tried to\n\npromote his endeavors via social networking on Twitter, claim police.\n\nRutgers Pictures: Tyler Clemente Case\n\nRutgers Photo 1\n\nRutgers Photo 2\n\nRutgers Photo 3\n\nWhat roommate would do such a thing?\n\nAfter the Ravi was released last Wednesday, Clementi headed to the\n\nGeorge Washington Bridge. At 8:50 pm, Clementi was spotted standing on\n\nthe south walk of the bridge; his car, cellphone, and computer were\n\nreportedly close by. New York news is reporting that Tyler Clementi\n\njumped to his death. His body has yet to be recovered.\n\nBashing of students by fellow students is dominating our society. In\n\ntwenty four hours, LALATE has reported four teen students, as young as\n\n13 and as old as 18, taking their lives this school year because of\n\nridicule.\n\nCNN’s Anderson Cooper last night addressed the subject. He invited\n\nAndrew Shirvell who defended his “Chris Armstrong Watch”. Chris\n\nArmstrong is a student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor campus.\n\nShirvell is a member of Michigan’s attorney general’s office, and a\n\nperson obligated to prosecute wrongful conduct in the State of\n\nMichigan. While Armstrong has been able to brush off Shirvell’s\n\nridicule, Shirvell took to national news last night to name call\n\nArmstrong.\n\n“I’m a Christian citizen exercising my First Amendment rights. I have\n\nno problem that Chris is homosexual. I have a problem that he’s\n\nadvancing a very radical agenda.” When asked if he was bigot, Shirvell\n\nthen called Chris Armstrong a “bigot”. “The real bigot here is Chris\n\nArmstrong, I don’t have any hate in my body at all”\n\nFor more the Clementi death on LALATE, click here:\n\nhttp://news.lalate.com/category/new-york/\n\nGroups: Prosecute Rutgers case as hate crime\n\nNew Jersey law among strictest in country; federal charges unlikely\n\nVideo\n\nGay rights groups say Rutgers suicide a hate crime\n\nNBC News and news services NBC News and news services\n\nupdated 2 hours 18 minutes ago\n\nSome gay rights groups are urging that New Jersey’s hate crime law be\n\nused in the case of the Rutgers student who committed suicide after an\n\nintimate encounter with another student was shown on the Internet.\n\nThe state’s hate crime law is among the strictest in the nation, and\n\nit works as most of them do. It’s not an offense charged on its own.\n\nInstead, it’s invoked at sentencing to seek a harsher penalty. The\n\ncriminal charges filed so far in the case — invasion of privacy —\n\nwould qualify for a hate crime enhancement, say legal experts in the\n\nstate.\n\nTechnolog: Internet was help — and hell — for Rutgers freshman\n\nAccording to the Middlesex County prosecutor, New Jersey’s invasion of\n\nprivacy statutes make it a crime “to collect or view images depicting\n\nnudity or sexual contact involving another individual without that\n\nperson’s consent.” It’s a separate crime to transmit or distribute\n\nthose images. The penalty can include a prison term of up to five\n\nyears.\n\nIf the hate crime enhancement were applied, it would raise the maximum\n\npenalty to 10 years.\n\nTyler Clementi, 18, jumped off New York City’s George Washington\n\nBridge into the Hudson River last week. His body was identified on\n\nThursday after being found in the river a day before.\n\nMost popular Was Rutgers suicide case a hate crime?\n\nUpdated 119 minutes ago Outrage on campus after sex-video suicide\n\nGay rights groups say Rutgers suicide a hate crime\n\nClementi’s roommate, Dharun Ravi, and fellow Rutgers freshman Molly\n\nWei, both 18, have been charged with invading Clementi’s privacy.\n\nProsecutors say that they used a webcam to surreptitiously transmit a\n\nlive image of Clementi having sex Sept. 19 and that Ravi tried to\n\nwebcast a second encounter on Sept. 21, the day before Clementi’s\n\nsuicide.\n\nAs for possible federal charges, a Justice Department official says\n\nthat’s not likely at this point. The federal hate crime law would not\n\napply, the official says, because it requires proof of an intent to\n\ncause violence to the victim.\n\nYouTube channel offers hope to gay teens\n\nSteven Goldstein, chairman of New Jersey-based Garden State Equality,\n\nsaid in a statement that his group considers Clementi’s death a hate\n\ncrime.\n\n“We are heartbroken over the tragic loss of a young man who, by all\n\naccounts, was brilliant, talented and kind,” Goldstein said. “And we\n\nare sickened that anyone in our society, such as the students\n\nallegedly responsible for making the surreptitious video, might\n\nconsider destroying others’ lives as a sport.”\n\nFormer assistant Essex County prosecutor Luanne Peterpaul, who is vice\n\nchairwoman of Garden State Equality, said in order to apply the hate\n\ncrime law prosecutors would need to establish that the defendants were\n\nmotivated to act because they perceived Clementi as gay. But that can\n\nbe hard to prove, she said.\n\nStory: Outrage on campus over student’s suicide after sex is broadcast\n\nonline\n\nGay rights groups say Clementi’s death is the latest example of a long-\n\nstanding problem: young people who kill themselves because they’re\n\nbullied about being gay — regardless of whether they are.\n\nIn response to Clementi’s death and others, the group Parents,\n\nFamilies & Friends of Lesbians and Gays said it would issue a “call to\n\naction” on the topic.\n\nLast week, Dan Savage, a columnist at the Seattle weekly newspaper The\n\nStranger, launched the It Gets Better Project, a YouTube channel where\n\ngay, lesbian and bisexual adults share the turmoil they experienced\n\nwhen they were younger — and show how their lives have gotten better.\n\nNBC News Justice Correspondent Pete Williams and The Associated Press\n\ncontributed to this report\n\nObama signs hate crimes bill into law\n\nOctober 28, 2009 7:39 p.m. EDT\n\nPresident Obama signs the $680 billion defense spending bill that\n\nincludes the hate crimes law.\n\nSTORY HIGHLIGHTS\n\nLaw is attached to $680 billion defense authorization bill\n\nIt is named for Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr., both killed in\n\n1998\n\nShepard was gay, Byrd was African-American\n\nFormer President Bush had threatened to veto a similar measure\n\nWashington (CNN) — President Obama on Wednesday signed a law that\n\nmakes it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or\n\nher sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe expanded federal hate crimes law, hailed by supporters as the\n\nfirst major federal gay rights legislation, was added to a $680\n\nbillion defense authorization bill that Obama signed at a packed White\n\nHouse ceremony.\n\nThe hate crimes measure was named for Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming\n\nteenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October\n\n1998, and James Byrd Jr., an African-American man dragged to death in\n\nTexas the same year.\n\nShepard’s mother, Judy, was among those at the ceremony that also\n\nincluded Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates,\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder and leading members of Congress and the\n\nPentagon, who were on hand for the appropriations bill signing.\n\nTo loud applause, Obama hailed the hate crimes measure in the bill as\n\na step toward change to “help protect our citizens from violence based\n\non what they look like, who they love, how they pray.”\n\nVideo: Obama signs hate crime bill\n\nRELATED TOPICS\n\nHate Crimes\n\nMilitary and Defense Policy\n\nBarack Obama\n\nHe cited the work of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and\n\nothers “to make this day possible.”\n\nLater Wednesday, Obama stood with Shepard’s parents and relatives of\n\nByrd at a separate White House event honoring passage of the expanded\n\nhate crimes law.\n\nNoting reports of 12,000 crimes based on sexual orientation over the\n\npast 10 years, Obama called the bill another step in the continuing\n\nstruggle for protecting human rights.\n\n“Because of the efforts of the folks in this room, particularly those\n\nfamily members standing behind me, the bell rings even louder now,”\n\nObama said. When he finished his remarks, he hugged the weeping\n\nrelatives as the audience applauded.\n\nSeveral religious groups have expressed concern that a hate crimes law\n\ncould be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects\n\nsuch as abortion or homosexuality. However, Holder has said that any\n\nfederal hate-crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts\n\nbased on bias, not to prosecute speech based on controversial racial\n\nor religious beliefs.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush had threatened to veto a similar\n\nmeasure, but Obama brought a reversal of that policy to the White\n\nHouse.\n\nWhen the bill won final congressional approval last week, Human Rights\n\nCampaign president Joe Solmonese called the hate crimes measure “our\n\nnation’s first major piece of civil rights legislation for lesbian,\n\ngay, bisexual and transgender people.”\n\nEarlier this month, Obama told the Human Rights Campaign, the\n\ncountry’s largest gay rights group, that the nation still needs to\n\nmake significant changes to ensure equal rights for gays and lesbians.\n\n“Despite the progress we’ve made, there are still laws to change and\n\nhearts to open,” he said in an address at the group’s annual dinner.\n\n“This fight continues now and I’m here with the simple message: I’m\n\nhere with you in that fight.”\n\nAmong other things, Obama has called for the repeal of the ban on gays\n\nserving openly in the military — the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.\n\nHe also has urged Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and\n\npass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act.\n\nThe Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage, for federal purposes, as\n\na legal union between a man and a woman. It allows states to refuse to\n\nrecognize same-sex marriages. The Domestic Partners Benefit and\n\nObligations Act would extend family benefits now available to\n\nheterosexual federal employees to gay and lesbian federal workers.\n\nHowever, some advocates for stronger rights for the lesbian-gay-\n\nbisexual-transgender community have complained that Obama’s\n\nadministration is moving too slowly on his legislative promises.\n\nOpponents of the expanded hate crimes bill challenged the need to\n\nspecify one particular community in federal legislation. They\n\ncontended that existing federal hate crimes laws were sufficient to\n\nprotect the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender\n\nidentity.\n\nMore than 77,000 hate-crime incidents were reported by the FBI between\n\n1998 and 2007, or “nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day\n\nover the span of a decade,” Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nin June.\n\nAt Wednesday’s signing, Obama also praised what he called a bipartisan\n\neffort to start changing the culture of military spending through the\n\nannual appropriations bill.

By description he was a quiet student,\n\nnot well known by others in his dorm, though hundreds turned out for a\n\nmemorial vigil on campus last night. His college career had only just\n\nbegun, and I keep putting myself in the shoes of his parents, who had\n\njust dropped their child off for the start of a new adventure, then, a\n\nfew weeks later, received word that every parent dreads.\n\nI also keep thinking of the parents of the roommate, Dharun Ravi, who\n\nwas probably matched with Celmenti by a random computer program, and\n\nMolly Wei, the classmate charged with helping Mr. Ravi with the prank.\n\nAnd a prank is what they seem to have thought it was. They would not\n\nbe the first to think so. Back when I was in college, a couple of\n\nyoung men found themselves a video camera, climbed onto a dumpster\n\noutside a dorm window, and taped a friend having sex. Then they showed\n\nthe film at a party and everyone laughed — everyone but the girl who\n\nhad no idea the the encounter had been filmed. No charges were ever\n\nfiled.\n\nSeems the students got their idea from the movie MASH, when a\n\nmicrophone is placed under a cot, broadcasting a tryst between Frank\n\nBurns and Margaret Houlihan to the entire camp. Everyone laughed then,\n\ntoo.\n\nBut while the idea may not be new, the technology is. You can violate\n\nsomeone nowadays with the touch of a button and in front of the entire\n\nworld. I am betting that Ravi and Wei never thought for a moment that\n\nby outing Clementi on the Internet he would leave a note online saying\n\nhe had headed for the George Washington Bridge and that his body would\n\nbe found in the Hudson River. After all, it was a joke. Wasn’t it?\n\nAnd I would guess that Ravi and Wei’s parents are searching through\n\nstored memories, too. Were there other “jokes” over the years that no\n\none stopped? Was there a tolerance of antigay slurs from time to time?\n\nThey are anguished, I am sure. Confused, perhaps, at how their\n\nchildren could be so stupid. Or maybe they feel like victims of a\n\nwireless world in which every misstep is magnified and cached forever.\n\nIn that way, they have an awful lot in common with the Clementis.\n\nTyler Clementi’s death was announced just as Rutgers kicked off a two-\n\nyear, campuswide project to teach the importance of civility, with\n\nspecial attention to the use and abuse of new technology. Excellent\n\nsubject. But it’s one that parent’s should be teaching in the 18 years\n\nbefore their children even get to campus.\n\n“It’s only funny until someone loses an eye,” the saying goes.\n\nNo, it isn’t funny in the first place.\n\n.85 Readers’ Comments\n\n1.alw tucsonSeptember 30th, 201012:58 pm\n\nThis story is so incredibly heartbreaking.

Does it deserve 5 years in prison or any prison time at all? No\n\nI just do not believe that incident alone led to this young man’s\n\nsuicide. I also don’t believe it came out of no where for his\n\nparent’s. Having had 2 friends who committed suicide it never comes\n\nout of nowhere for anyone that is paying the least bit of attention.\n\nIt is tragic that paths aligned for this to happen. What if… what if\n\nhe had a more tolerant roomate, or one less adept with technology or…\n\nor… with that said one future has been ruined.

Furthermore,\n\nreports of the messages left on the live broadcast (over iChat)\n\nsuggest they are acutely homophobic in nature.\n\nThis is more than an “ordinary” tease, as with the video recordings of\n\nstraight couples you mention, because it invited homophobic elements\n\nof the campus to express their disgust. There is a question as to\n\nwhether this was intentional, but Clementi appears to have thought so,\n\nand there is such clear and obvious inevitability that this would\n\ninvite a scree of gay hating that it is hard to see the act as\n\nanything other than a severe, malign and tragic case of outright\n\nhomophobic bullying.\n\nRecommended by 42 Readers\n\n.7.In Awe San Francisco, CASeptember 30th, 20101:15 pm\n\nThis is so incredibly sad.

No, it wasn’t “stupid,”\n\nand, no, it wasn’t a “prank” or a “joke.”\n\nIt was a premeditated, long-planned, calculated act of sadism. It was\n\nevil.\n\nIt was also a hate crime against a gay man.\n\nMany have said, “Oh, they probably would’ve done the same thing with a\n\nheterosexual incident.” Possibly — and unless it emerges that they’d\n\ndone so in the past, we’ll never know — but if the encounter had been\n\nheterosexual, it would’ve played out very differently in the culture,\n\nthe perpetrators would’ve known very well about that difference in\n\nadvance, and therefore the act would’ve been committed with a\n\ndifferent intent.\n\nIf it had been a straight encounter, the intended victim most likely\n\nwould’ve been the woman, and it would’ve likely constituted a hate\n\ncrime against women. The man in the encounter would’ve had his privacy\n\ninvaded, yes, but he typically would’ve been slapped on the back and\n\ncongratulated.\n\nThe infamous “Junior/Senior” night incident Ms Belkin recalls from her\n\ncollege days was similarly a hate crime against women. Most people on\n\ncampus were unwilling to recognize it as such at the time, and Ms.\n\nBelkin still doesn’t seem to have “gotten” it.\n\nLast, this latest incident was a predatory crime that preyed on\n\nsomeone perceived as vulnerable — in this case because the person was\n\nreportedly shy and socially inhibited.\n\nIt *might* even have been a hate crime against “nerds” — i.e.,\n\nstudents whose intelligence, academic abilities and/or talents are\n\nstrong, but whose social skills are weak — but based on what’s been\n\nreported so far I don’t think we can distinguish whether it was an act\n\nof hate toward a group, or merely the primitive and ugly part of human\n\nnature that can’t resist the impulse to prey on the weak.\n\nPlease let’s not trivialize the sadism and evil involved in\n\ncyberbullying. Phoebe Prince, Megan Meier, several other gay suicides\n\nin the past few weeks — these incidents are piling up so fast it’s\n\nbecoming difficult to keep up.

If\n\nit hadn’t been this it would have been something else.\n\nThat said, it does not make what Ravi and Wei did ok. Quite to the\n\ncontrary it was cruel and immature. However, before we ruin two more\n\nlives and send them to jail, stop and think about all the dumb things\n\nyou did in college. Although I never did anything hurtful to others, I\n\ncertainly did stuff that was technically illegal (underage drinking\n\nanyone?) and which certainly could have gotten me sent to jail. My\n\nhusband and I have talked many times about how horrible it would have\n\nbeen to be young and stupid in the age of the cell phone camera. For\n\nthe record, I was an A student who never once got in trouble either\n\nwith the law or the university but I am not going to be arrogant\n\nenough to say I never did anything I regret.\n\nFurther, the accusation that this was a hate crime is far fetched at\n\nbest. Ravi’s comment that his roommate was “making out with a dude”\n\nwas simply an observation of what was occurring and the article says\n\nthat Mr. Clementi’s facebook post was a “favorite quote.” As for an\n\ninvasion of privacy, given that it was a shared room and Mr. Clementi\n\nprobably knew of Ravi’s webcam, it’s going to be awfully hard for the\n\nprosecution to argue that Mr. Clementi had any expectation of privacy.\n\nHow any of this adds up to a hate crime is beyond me.

It’s not a wonder that our\n\nchildren are being bullied to death–adults are engaging in the exact\n\nsame behavior, and then, their adult peers condone their behavior by\n\nsaying that they shouldn’t serve jail time. I personally believe that\n\nthey have to make an example of these two students who did this.\n\nThey were intolerant of Tyler’s right to be free and unbothered in his\n\nsexuality.

As a Rutgers student who was deeply saddened by the recent\n\nevents, I went to the rally in hopes that there would be some evidence\n\nof remembrance for Mr. Clementi, but was instead greatly disturbed by\n\nwhat appeared to be the manipulation of the young man’s death for\n\npolitical gains.\n\nThere is, however, a memorial scheduled for Friday, in front of Brower\n\nCommons on the College Avenue campus, if anyone is interested in\n\ngoing.\n\nThat being said, I do feel as though this article speaks with a\n\nrefreshing amount of compassion. While I am very angry that the\n\naccused would act as they did (if they did – I do not wish to jump to\n\nconclusions), I also pity them for their lack of discretion in the\n\nmatter. I have read many discussion groups where people are\n\nbloodthirstily calling for extreme punishment of the accused, and I do\n\nnot feel as though this is a good reaction. Rather than responding\n\nwith more aggression, I feel as though we should at least be\n\ncompassionate in our treatment of the accused, so that they may learn\n\nfrom their grave wrongdoings. Responding with more aggression only\n\nfuels the ignorance that leads to these tragic occurrences in the\n\nfirst place. In grieving instead of protesting, and in presenting the\n\naccused with this grief rather than with hatred, we can perhaps allow\n\nthere to be some progress made in the matter – for Mr. Clementi’s\n\ndeath was, after all, evidence of a profound lack of compassion that\n\nexists in our society.\n\nRecommended by 6 Readers\n\n55.redd141Northern New JerseySeptember 30th, 20107:12 pm\n\nWho are you kidding here?

Clementi might have been the target of bullies in high\n\nschool as well; his sense of hopelessness and despair might have been\n\ncumulative. That doesn’t give anyone a free pass to treat him as Ravi\n\nand Wei did. When I was a child, the rule was “go pick on someone your\n\nown size.”\n\nMy daughter, after completing primary school in a class blessedly free\n\nof bullying, had her first day of lower secondary (grade 5) in a new\n\nschool less than three weeks ago. We went out early to the bus stop,\n\nwhere a mother and son had already arrived. The boy looked barely old\n\nenough to be in this grade and was so shy he never looked at my\n\ndaughter or spoke to her. I talked with the mother and found out he\n\nwas going to be in my daughter’s class. I’ll call him Peter here.\n\nFast forward to the Parents’ Evening this past Wednesday, where we sat\n\nin a circle and met the teachers. One father asked if there was any\n\nadult supervision on the (rather small) play area, because his son\n\nhad, twice, been surrounded during recess by a group of much older\n\nboys who closed a circle around him and didn’t let him out. This was\n\nPeter’s dad. The next day I mentioned this to my daughter, without\n\nsaying the boy’s name. She guessed that it was Peter, because, she\n\nsaid, he was the only boy in the class who was shy.\n\nMy child would not have the spine (and maybe not the level of empathy\n\neither) to stand up to Peter’s tormentors, and it might be unsafe for\n\nher to do so anyway, but I’m trying to convince her of the importance\n\nof seeking out a teacher immediately if she sees this or something\n\nlike it happening again. The homeroom teacher seems to take bullying\n\nseriously, so I hope the problem will be dealt with successfully.\n\nI also sympathize with the parents of all three students involved. The\n\nRoom for Debate blog focused mainly on the legal, social, and cultural\n\nissues, so I’m glad, Lisa, that you’re presenting the story from a\n\nparent’s perspective.

Its so-called bias intimidation law allows prosecutors to\n\nlodge separate charges and seek greater penalties against anyone who\n\ncommits a crime against someone because of the victim’s sexual\n\norientation. The law does not specify that the crime be violent.\n\nThe Middlesex County prosecutor, Bruce J. Kaplan, said Thursday that\n\nhis office was considering whether to press hate-crime charges against\n\nMr. Clementi’s roommate, Dharun Ravi of Plainsboro, N.J., and Molly\n\nWei of West Windsor, N.J. As of Friday, no additional charges had been\n\nfiled and a court hearing date had not been set.\n\nBut on talk shows and blogs, people outraged by the suicide of Mr.\n\nClementi, an accomplished violinist from Ridgewood, N.J., demanded\n\nthat the defendants face stiff penalties.\n\nIn a statement released through a lawyer, Mr. Clementi’s parents, Jane\n\nand Joe Clementi, said: “We understand that our family’s personal\n\ntragedy presents important legal issues for the country as well as for\n\nus. Regardless of our legal outcomes, our hope is that our family’s\n\npersonal tragedy will serve as a call for compassion, empathy and\n\nhuman dignity.”\n\nOn Sept. 19, Mr. Ravi messaged his Twitter followers that he had gone\n\nto Ms. Wei’s dormitory room and activated a webcam in his own room,\n\nshowing Mr. Clementi as he was “making out with a dude.” Prosecutors\n\nsaid the images were streamed live on the Internet.\n\nOn Sept. 21, the authorities said, Mr. Ravi tried to stream more video\n\nand invited friends to watch. But Mr. Clementi apparently discovered\n\nthe camera and complained to school officials. The next day, he jumped\n\nfrom the George Washington Bridge.\n\n“It is crystal clear that the motive was to intimidate and harass that\n\nyoung man based on his sexual orientation, whether actual or\n\nperceived,” said Steven Goldstein, chairman of Garden State Equality,\n\na gay rights group.\n\nMalcolm Lazin, a former federal prosecutor who is executive director\n\nof Equality Forum, a national gay rights advocacy group, called on\n\nprosecutors to charge the two students with reckless manslaughter.\n\n“Clearly, what they did was premeditated,” Mr. Lazin said. “This was\n\nnot a visceral response. This was something that was well thought out,\n\nexecuted and then put on the worldwide Internet.”\n\nBut several lawyers said it was hard to imagine that prosecutors could\n\nmake a case for manslaughter, which would require them to show that\n\nMr. Ravi and Ms. Wei foresaw that their actions would lead to a\n\ndeath.\n\n“I think it would be hard to show that their conduct reached a level\n\nof recklessness that caused Tyler Clementi to commit suicide,” said\n\nJay V. Surgent, a criminal defense lawyer in Lyndhurst, N.J.\n\nInstead, these lawyers said, it was more likely that prosecutors would\n\npursue bias charges.\n\nRobert A. Mintz, a criminal defense lawyer in Newark and a former\n\nfederal prosecutor, said, “What prosecutors will be looking at is\n\nwhether this is a prank that had gone horribly wrong, or whether this\n\nwas an orchestrated scheme to intimidate the victim based on his\n\nsexual orientation.”\n\nMr. Mintz said that prosecutors would likely review the students’ e-\n\nmail and Twitter messages, read any essays or blog entries, and\n\ninterview friends about what they might have said. “If there’s an\n\naccumulation of circumstantial evidence, that can be very powerful,”\n\nhe said.\n\nIf the students are charged and convicted of a hate crime, they could\n\nface up to 10 years in prison, instead of 5 years for the privacy\n\ncharge alone. State Senator Shirley K. Turner has proposed legislation\n\nto raise the top sentence for invasion of privacy to 10 years.\n\nStudent vigils are planned over the weekend for Mr. Clementi.\n\nNate Schweber contributed reporting.\n\n.Not Every Tragedy Should Lead to Prison\n\nUpdated October 1, 2010, 06:35 PM\n\nPaul Butler, a former federal prosecutor, is an associate dean and the\n\nCarville Dickinson Benson Research Professor of Law at George\n\nWashington University. He is the author of “Let’s Get Free: A Hip-Hop\n\nTheory of Justice.”\n\nWe don’t need any new criminal laws. We have more than enough right\n\nnow — 4,000 federal crimes, and many times that number of state\n\ncrimes. If prosecutors can’t find anything to charge a particular\n\ncyberbully with, that bully has not committed a crime. If simply being\n\na jerk was a criminal offense, we would need many more prisons than\n\nthe hundreds we already have.\n\nA national conversation about civility would be a more effective\n\ntribute to Tyler Clementi than creating more criminal laws. .Suicide\n\nis a tragic response to bullying. It is also a rare response. Of the\n\nmillions of children who suffer bullying, few take their own lives.\n\nBullies “cause” suicides in the same way that a man “causes” the\n\nsuicide of a lover he spurns. The criminal law typically does not hold\n\npeople responsible for outcomes that are idiosyncratic or\n\nunpredictable.\n\nIt is possible to deeply mourn the deaths of Tyler Clementi and Phoebe\n\nPrince, and also to acknowledge that their suicides are evidence of\n\ndeeper problems than bullying. In Clementi’s case, societal homophobia\n\nprobably played a big role as well. A straight college kid might be\n\noutraged if his roommate broadcast his sexual activity, but for a\n\ncloseted gay man, the revelation of his orientation — to the whole\n\nworld — might be even more disturbing than the public display of his\n\ngenitals. Clementi’s bullies cruelly exploited that social prejudice,\n\nbut they did not cause it.\n\nEvery tragedy doesn’t have to result in somebody going to jail. When\n\npeople are punished, it should be for the harm that they intend to do.\n\nIf a bully crosses the line between freedom of speech, and invasion of\n\nprivacy, or harassment, those are the crimes he should be charged\n\nwith, as is happening in the cases currently in the news.\n\nIf the only tool you have is prison, then every problem looks like a\n\ncrime. There are better ways to address cyberbullying, including the\n\npublic education campaign now underway at Rutgers. A national\n\nconversation about the importance of civility and respect would be a\n\nmore effective tribute to Tyler Clementi than trying to prosecute his\n\nbullies for manslaughter. They acted meanly, and possibly even\n\ncriminally, but not homicidally.\n\nUpdated | Read Paul Butler’s response to reader comments.\n\nTopics: Internet, Law, Technology\n\nPrevious Contributor\n\nA Human Rights Issue\n\nBernard James Next Contributor\n\nMore Insidious Harassment\n\nMarlene Sandstrom ..Comments are no longer being accepted.\n\n162 Readers’ Comments\n\n.1.

If the man that videotaped Mr. Clementi videotaped a teen\n\ngirl having sex would your reaction be different?\n\nAs a lawyer, I would hope for better logical reasoning and\n\nunderstanding of the law from a law professor.\n\nRecommended by 123 Readers\n\n.9. cindy\n\nTX\n\nSeptember 30th, 2010 7:25 pm\n\nI reluctantly agree with Paul Butler because this nation has gone\n\nprison crazy and it is often counter-productive. However, I find\n\nmyself to be utterly outraged at the action of this malicious person\n\nwho posted the video online. What he did was so very wrong, so very\n\ncruel and insensitive, so very shameful.\n\nRecommended by 35 Readers\n\n.10. Ron Bannon\n\nNewark, NJ\n\nSeptember 30th, 2010 7:28 pm\n\nThey are kids! All of them. Why is this being elevated to this level?\n\nYes, it’s wrong to bully, but it also wrong to bully the bully. Show a\n\nlittle respect for reason, and stop jumping to conclusions about the\n\nabsolute nature of evil.\n\nRecommended by 45 Readers\n\n.11. Le Gra\n\nPrinceton, NJ\n\nSeptember 30th, 2010 7:29 pmIndeed the crime committed by criminals\n\nRiva & Wei was premeditated as the Riva criminal set up two ichats for\n\nthe purpose of berating and pure violation of the most sacred privacy\n\nthat being one’s intimacies. Both Riva & Wei are well aware of the\n\nfederal violations imposed by recording without the mutual consent.\n\nFurther, why was Riva given a bail of $25,000.00 and the other\n\ncriminal Wei released on her own recognizant? Perhaps because Riva has\n\na past criminal record he had to post or his Father had too post the\n\nbail. A punishment fitting for this kind of crime is necessary. It\n\nshould be crafted so neither criminal Riva or criminal Wei can ever\n\nenter a US college and pay Rutgers back the costs to conduct the\n\nUniversity wide training for life. Further the scholarships they\n\nreceived be rescinded after they are expelled and given to two\n\nstudents at Rutgers who exhibit attributes such as “non-judgmental &\n\npure human kindness”! In summary ten (10) years in prison to life\n\nwould be fair that being five years each for each event. This would\n\ngive a message to all that life is a precious gift and sacred!\n\nRecommended by 18 Readers\n\n.12. Mac\n\nIllinois\n\nSeptember 30th, 2010 7:30 pm\n\nI think this could be more suicide than hate crime. The posting of the\n\nvideo was likely a catalyst, but I think we need to know more about\n\nthe case. Would the people calling for life imprisonment for the\n\nposters of the video feel the same if it were revealed that the father\n\nof the deceased were a virulent homophobe? Likely they would. What if\n\nit were the tenth suicide attempt for the boy? Likely they would. I\n\nalso agree that the public humiliation could have happened if the boy\n\nwere straight, too, so this isn’t on the surface a definite hate\n\ncrime. Let’s let the facts come into focus before we turn on the\n\noutrage fully…\n\nRecommended by 24 Readers\n\n.13.

Based on what you’ve seen on the\n\nnews? I’d suggest that your rush to judgment is as premature as that\n\nof the torch-and-pitchfork crowd who want to toss these two young\n\npeople in the dungeon.\n\nI hope your decisions about federal prosecutions were more carefully\n\nconsidered. I never thought I’d be urging a lawyer to let the criminal\n\njustice system do its own work.\n\nThis is a time to console the family and to withhold our own judgment\n\non this awful tragedy. I’ve not yet read the other contributions to\n\nthis “debate”, but I’m afraid their opinions will be just as hasty.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s what it takes to get media time.\n\nRecommended by 23 Readers\n\n.14. RadioKev\n\nMontpelier, VT\n\nSeptember 30th, 2010 7:34 pm\n\nI agree that the bulliers should face the consequences of current law.\n\nThis is not a hate crime, it does not have the same intent of a hate\n\ncrime. He did invade his privacy, and he should go to prison to the\n\nextent of the law, but murder and hate crimes are too much for his\n\nactions.\n\nAs this writer suggests, perhaps society is to blame that this student\n\ntook his life. Being homosexual isn’t wrong, and it shouldn’t be\n\nhidden. It is deeply personal, and it’s his right to do with his\n\nprivate affairs as he likes, but the extreme act of suicide only shows\n\nthat he was an unstable person. Embarrassment? Not worth taking your\n\nlife.\n\nThere are deeper issues that shouldn’t be slammed upon the defendant\n\nhere.\n\nRecommended by 22 Readers\n\n.15. blasmaic\n\nWashington DC\n\nSeptember 30th, 2010 7:31 pm\n\nMost people would agree that suicide is not an appropriate response to\n\nbullying.\n\nThis opens a door to the question of who the bigger bully is, since\n\nthe room-mate and his accomplice are now on the recieving end of a lot\n\nof anger and hate which they did not intend to stir, but which\n\nClementi knew would be sent their way. When there is so much outreach,\n\nacceptance, empowerment, and support for gays and lesbians, how can it\n\nbe that a person’s only available response to bullying is a dramatic\n\nsuicide?\n\nIf suicide was his best solution, what else could have already\n\ntranspired between he and his dorm-mates? Why not apply that old rule\n\nabout the referees never seeing the first punch thrown (I cite Title\n\nIX when using sports analogies), and trace the sequence of events from\n\nthe beginning?\n\nOr maybe university leaders would like “Good-bye, Cruel World” to\n\nbecome the standard, normal response to room-mate conflict.\n\nRecommended by 19 Readers\n\n.16. Ladislav Nemec’\n\nbig bear, ca\n\nSeptember 30th, 2010 7:35 pm\n\nIt is technically impossible to stop disseminating (in real time) of\n\nvideo stuff no matter what the content is.\n\nThere should be, however, very severe consequencies to acts like this\n\n‘student duo’. I am not familiar with the current laws but they should\n\nbe made much more severe on a FEDERAL level – dissemination of the\n\nstuff is surely not limited to one state (actually, not even one\n\ncountry).\n\nPeople should have a freedom of expression – censorship of ‘live’\n\nstuff is impossible in any case – but they should have to pay the\n\nprice. Expulsion from a university should be the first step, followed\n\nby prison (obviously, not for life as #1 suggests) and/or a hefty\n\nfine. Also by ban to participate in these strange ‘public’ networks\n\nlike Twitter and Facebook (they are actually more, I guess). Basically\n\nto be blacklisted.\n\nAn unnecessary tragedy. Growing up gay in a friendly family and\n\ncommunity perhaps gave this young man a false sense of security. There\n\nis not such thing in a country where bible is quoted all the time even\n\nif Leviticus 20 is not that popular nowadays (in publc, that is).\n\nRecommended by 11 Readers\n\n.17. miss the sixties\n\nsarasota fl\n\nSeptember 30th, 2010 7:37 pm\n\nThis is no meaner than the acts of malicious people in previous\n\ngenerations; it is simply that the current technology offers worldwide\n\ndissemination in seconds. The suicide was not the result of the\n\nbullying, but the result of a deeper problem – the other party filmed\n\ndid not kill himself. The story would not have received any press at\n\nall except for the orientation of the victim. Public vilification and\n\nexpulsion from Rutgers should be adequate punishment for the accused;\n\nI fail to see where this is a criminal act that requires legal action,\n\nother than possibly a civil suit.\n\nRecommended by 22 Readers\n\n.18.

I think the public education at Rutgers is proof that it’s too\n\nlittle too late. Rutgers needs to take ACTION. Immediately. This is\n\noutrageous, unnacceptable behavior–it’s that simple. There is hard\n\nproof that the information was posted by this student; why hasn’t he\n\nbeen expelled already? He’s NOT innocent–that’s already been proven.\n\nWhat happened to ZERO TOLERANCE? Elementary school kids are being\n\nsuspended for carrying seemingly innocent items in knapsacks, but this\n\nkid is still enrolled at RU? There is NO logical explanation for that.\n\nThe education needs to start in kindergarten, in my opinion. It’s\n\nobviously too late for the current crop of college freshman to learn\n\nhow dangerous a ‘simple’ prank like this is.\n\nI hope the former roommate rots in jail for the rest of his life, but\n\nif he doesn’t, the nice news is that any potential employer or date\n\njust has to Google his name to find out all about him.
