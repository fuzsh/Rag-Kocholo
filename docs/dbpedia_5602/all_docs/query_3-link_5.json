Membership, which is by invitation only, is based on distinctive achievements in one of the branches of film production recognized by the academy and includes actors, writers, directors, producers, art directors, cinematographers, film editors, sound technicians, visual-effects artists, musicians, makers of short films and animated features, executives, and public relations experts.\n\nThe academy was created in 1927 by 36 film industry leaders after Louis B. Mayer, the head of the powerful Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, actor Conrad Nagel, director Fred Niblo, and producer Fred Beetson had the idea for a new industry organization for handling labour disputes, promoting harmony among the different branches of film production (the academyâ€™s original branches represented actors, writers, directors, producers, and technicians), improving the public image of the film industry, and providing a common ground for the discussion of new production procedures and technologies. Never an effective arbiter, the academy abandoned labour negotiations by 1937, and its focus became cultural and educational.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
