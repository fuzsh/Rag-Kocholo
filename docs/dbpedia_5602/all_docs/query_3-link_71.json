It has a proven track record of developing the change-makers of the future as evidenced by the achievements of its alumni. The VCA today offers a unique range of programs across the visual arts, performing arts and media, taught by staff who are experts in their fields.\n\nThe VCA is co-located with the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music on the University of Melbourne’s Southbank campus in the heart of Melbourne’s Arts Precinct. We respectfully acknowledge the people of the Boonwurrung and the Woi Wurrung, who have danced their dances, sung their songs and lived their culture on this land for tens of thousands of years."
