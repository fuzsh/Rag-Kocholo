        "text": "The Boston College Computer Science Society is dedicated to helping students interested in technology and entrepreneurship achieve their goals. Throughout the school year, they host guest lectures, workshops, hackathons, collaborative projects, and more. CSS works closely with the Computer Science Department at BC to create a better environment for students to learn and find new opportunities. They also collaborate with many departments and clubs in the Carroll School of Management to encourage entrepreneurship and promote collaboration between business and computer science students.\n\nThe Computer Science Society is the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery and is very active. ACM is the professional organization for Computer and Information Scientists. There are many benefits of student membership.\n\nMIG is a community of driven undergraduate students at Boston College who are passionate about artificial intelligence. We hold weekly lectures and tri-weekly workshops on various topics in machine intelligence that are open to all with the hopes of lowering the barriers of entry in artificial intelligence. Our core group does research and works on complex, real-world AI/ML problems. We also compete in and host various machine intelligence competitions throughout the academic year. We encourage those that are interested to come to weekly meetings and check out demos of our ongoing projects."
