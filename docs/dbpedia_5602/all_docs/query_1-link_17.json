        "text": "ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. – Orange County students go back to school on Monday, and 53,000 are signed up to ride the school bus.\n\nIn order to keep track of students getting on the bus, Orange County Public Schools is now implementing new technology.\n\nMost students have already received brand new ID cards that they will use to swipe on a scanner when they get on the bus. Their name and student ID number will pop up on a tablet next to the driver, letting them know that they are on the correct bus.\n\nPamela Johnson has been a bus driver with Orange County for 31 years. She told News 6 that parents should discuss the new changes with their child, along with reviewing expected behavior when riding the bus.\n\nShe is looking forward to the new school bus student tracking system technology.\n\n“You can track the kids better because little Johnny may have been supposed to have got on 225, but he came to my bus. When he swipes his card, it’s going to tell me that he does not belong here,” Johnson said.\n\nIn October, parents will be getting access to an app that will allow parents to be notified that their child has gotten on the bus.\n\nThe school district is looking to fill a hundred bus driver positions. Click here to learn more.\n\nSeminole and Osceola schools also use this technology, as well as many others across the country."
