Congratulations to Michael C Hall, who is likely basking in the glow of his and partner Morgan Macgregor's wedding right about now.

The couple tied the knot on Monday (February 29) at City Hall in New York City, his spokesperson confirmed to Digital Spy.

This is the third marriage for Hall, who was previously wed to Broadway veteran Amy Spanger and Dexter co-star Jennifer Carpenter.

His separation from Carpenter was so amicable that the pair went on working together on Dexter for two years after their split.

Hall is currently starring on the off-Broadway stage in the musical Lazarus.

Lazarus was among the final work completed by the late David Bowie, who created the musical as a sequel to his cult movie The Man Who Fell to Earth.
