        "text": "I have been working towards my goal of qualifying for AEC for quite some time now. I made the switch from hunters to eventing about eight years ago because I loved the adrenaline rush of cross-country. Although my family wasn’t able to buy a horse that had “been there, done that,” they have shown so much support for me in this dream. We bought a green off-the-track Thoroughbred, which then showed me a whole new passion for retraining OTTBs.\n\nMy first horse, Trick, was the one that taught me most everything I know. From sitting a buck, bolt, or rear to learning patience and how to be in tune with your horse, I quickly fell in love with him, and we grew together. We went from running out at cross rails to soaring through a 3’ course. We then had a freak accident, causing me to fracture my back in two places and get a concussion, putting me out for a couple months, but all I could think about was getting back to riding.\n\nWhen I was able to, I hopped right back on and went back to work. After a couple years with Trick, we soon realized he didn't want to be an eventer. That's when I made the most difficult decision I've had to make: to sell him. He is now happily competing in the hunter ring. It was the right thing to do, and I know that now, but it was something that I struggled with for a long time.\n\nIn 2020, I started riding one of my trainer’s client’s horses, who I adored, Toby. I had finally been successful, and it felt so rewarding after struggling for so long. After my first three shows on him, we qualified for AEC that year. I had finally reached my dreams, and I was so excited. I then found out it had been cancelled because of COVID, and I was heartbroken. Something I had been working towards for so long was taken away from me. Since then, all I have thought about is getting back to that spot.\n\nI then became a working student for my trainer for a year, which was hard work but such a learning experience. I learned so much about horse care and horse health. I also got to ride so many different horses and started focusing on my newest horse, Sami, who was lightly off-track when I got him. Although it was a struggle at first in the show ring, after about a year, we finally started to make progress. My last show on him we finished with two clear rounds and a ribbon, and it felt amazing. Shortly after, we found an old track injury that could cause him issues in the future. I made the difficult decision to retire him from the show ring to be cautious. Although it was a hard thing to do, I knew I wouldn't forgive myself if I pushed him and ended up with a lame horse, I just wanted him happy and healthy. I made the decision to stop competing because I didn’t want to sell my beloved Sami. He became my best friend and my “play pony,” as I call him.\n\nI moved Sami to a friend's place. For a whole year, I just rode for pleasure before realizing just how much I loved competing. I figured out a way to be able to afford to own two horses, so with the help of some friends and family, I found my next partner, Classic Greeley (Greeleys Galaxy x Classic Ide), who was a war horse off the track, meaning he's raced over 50 times.\n\nI got him from a wonderful woman, Kristina Hobbs, with Reciprocity Thoroughbreds, who did such an incredible job starting him off the track. It didn't take me long to realize he has the biggest heart. He has been such a blessing to bring along; he is one of the boldest horses I’ve ever sat on, and I have so much trust in the fact that he will keep me safe on every ride. I’ve had him for about a year and a half, and he’s honestly changed my life. After five shows, we qualified for the AEC this year at Beginner Novice. I finally get to compete, and it is so surreal.\n\nI’m so incredibly grateful to my family and friends for all their support, and of course to my trainers Vanessa and Kaitlyn Conner, who have shown me so much love these past eight years. My trainer's husband, Patrick, passed away in 2021, and it really affected a lot of people. He was one of my biggest supporters and someone who always fought for me. My trainers have always been so supportive, even while going through something so horrific—losing a husband and father. I couldn’t be more grateful for my support system.\n\nAre you planning on attending the AEC this year and have a cool story?
