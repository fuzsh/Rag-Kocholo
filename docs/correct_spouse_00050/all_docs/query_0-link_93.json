        "text": "Michael C Hall has claimed that he’s ‘not all the way heterosexual’.\n\nThe Dexter actor has been married three times, all to women, but he admits that he is on a ‘spectrum’ when it comes to his sexuality.\n\nThe 47-year-old told The Daily Beast: ‘ I’m heterosexual. But if there was a percentage, I would say I was not all the way heterosexual.\n\n‘I think playing the emcee [in Cabaret] required me to fling a bunch of doors wide open because that character I imagined as pansexual. Yeah, like I made out with Michael Stuhlbarg every night doing that show. I think I have always leaned into any fluidity in terms of my sexuality.’\n\nHowever, Hall added that he’s never had an intimate relationship with a man, and said: ‘I mean, I was attracted to John Cameron Mitchell when I saw Hedwig. But no, as a rule I am heterosexual.’\n\nThe star married wife Morgan Macgregor in 2016 after four years of dating.\n\nHe was previously married to actress Amy Spanger from 2002 until 2006, and his Dexter co-star Jennifer Carpenter – yes, the woman who played his sister – from 2008 until 2010.\n\nMichael has played a number of gay or queer characters throughout his career, most famously David Fisher in Six Feet Under and Hedwig in Hedwig And The Angry Inch.\n\nAnd while he thinks that straight people can play LGBTQ+ characters, he said: ‘When I was in Six Feet Under I was aware that I was a heterosexual man playing a gay role that was unique in the TV landscape.\n\n‘I was also aware that given the way things are and maybe still are to a degree that not many gay actors were pursuing the role. It would expose them in a way. That irony wasn’t lost on me.’\n\nMORE : ‘No one is 100% enough for anyone’: Nico Tortorella explains how a polyamorous marriage works for them"
