        "text": "Michael C. Hall cannot escape death. Maybe he doesn’t want to.\n\nHall now steps into some grim and self-reflective shoes as Thom in Will Eno’s one-person play Thom Pain (based on nothing) at The Signature Theatre, called \"a small masterpiece\" by the New York Times. A 70-minute journey of abstract delight, strangeness, hilarity, and penetrating observations on life and death, it's a play that has the unique ability to at one moment devastate and in the next make you break out into nervous giggles. The Golden Globe-winning actor inhabits Thom with mysterious ease as he saunters around the vast empty stage, scans the crowd for a \"volunteer\" and at times makes his way into the audience to find a scene partner to tell stories to and play with. Hall’s energy is inviting, with a glimmer in his eye that keeps us on the edge of our seats puzzling over his next move. His gifts as an actor allow him to escape entirely into any role, but it’s difficult not to reflect on his most iconic television characters. The theme of mortality is present in Thom Pain’s stories, and one can’t help but wonder if Hall gravitates towards characters whose primary fascination is death. He captivated audiences as David Fisher, the undertaker's son in Six Feet Under, and then as Dexter Morgan, a vigilante serial killer on Dexter.\n\nI spoke to Hall on his decision to take on this project, what attracted him to Eno’s work and how his past roles have led up to helping him prepare for this.\n\nRisa Sarachan: This is your second time working on a Will Eno play. What is it about Will’s words and your working dynamic that makes you want to delve into the worlds of his plays?\n\nMichael C. Hall: Well, I think Will is a singular genius with language. I love saying his words. I love the chance to embody his sentences and his thoughts, the way they simultaneously fold in on themselves and blossom. You know he’s just, he’s a wizard, and he’s also a great person and I just like being in a room with him in that way as well.\n\nSarachan: Since Thom Pain (based on nothing) is a monologue, is the process of rehearsing and performing it more rigorous than the process was for The Realistic Jones, in which you had a team of brilliant actors to play off of? Does it ever get lonely doing a one-person show?\n\nHall: Maybe a little. I think basically it was Oliver Butler, Will Eno and me in the room along with a stage management team. So it was always a triangulated conversation, so it wasn’t as if it was a one-on-one back and forth, which I think was good for everybody. Certainly, the experience of rehearsing is more ridiculous in a way, there’s no one to turn to, no one to pass the baton. If you let go of the baton, it just falls on the floor. So, our rehearsal days were probably a bit shorter than they would have been because there’s only that much sustained focus you can give when you’re the only one up there. But I really enjoyed the rehearsal process. I enjoy Will and Oliver a lot as people. We laughed a lot, we usually would start every day just throwing a ball around the rehearsal room. It’s become a thing.\n\nSarachan: Thom Pain stumbles into gorgeous and profound experiences as he interacts with the audience. Meaning is generated, lost, and regenerated throughout the show. How do you understand this structure in relation to life generally or to the current moment?\n\nHall: In terms of the current moment, I don’t think this show speaks directly to it. It’s perhaps an antidote to it or transcends it. I like that about it, I like that it’s not preoccupied with the current moment, we’re so up the current moment's ass right now. So I’m happy about that. I think I find Thom Pain the piece and Thom Pain the character to be something that, in spite of its initial intention, is life-affirming in a way that feels hard won, you know? I know it’s a very mysterious piece and one that I’m disinclined to answer questions about definitely. Even for myself. I go out there every night and just allow whatever day that I’ve lived and that the audience has collectively lived to go a long way to inform whatever the experience of the words might be that night. Does Thom exist beyond the world of the theatre? Does he live in a basement apartment somewhere? Does he live in the park? Is he from outer space? Who knows? What is his assignment? Has someone told him to prepare this piece? Is it something he’s initiated? What’s his motivation? And from night to night I just play with different ideas of what that might be in a way that you probably wouldn’t be as wise to do in a more traditional piece. I think it’s good for some element of the unknown and mystery to exist but in this, I feel like that room is a lot bigger.\n\nSarachan: What draws you to Thom? In what ways do you connect with him?\n\nHall: I’m drawn to the way he expresses himself. I’m drawn to the way he thinks. I’m drawn to his very idiosyncratic version of what I think he experiences as linear thoughts even though it feels on the page like he’s all over the place. I think, actually, his arrow is moving towards a target. He just does it in surprising and unconventional ways. I love the idea that he comes out there with a plan that seems to get hijacked by, I don’t know, he’s telling one story, and then he’s telling another and then they’re intersecting. I think he comes out there on stage with a controlled sense of what he’s up to and then as things spiral out of control, he gets to a place that he never planned on going or anticipated going, and it’s just, I love allowing the language to just live through me every night. It’s an amazing meditation in a way.\n\nSarachan: I’m noticing some of the projects you’re best known for share some… sanguinary themes. What do you think it is about the investigation of death that makes for such riveting art? What draws you to these works?\n\nHall: Well, there’s nothing we more have in common than the face of our common mortality, so anything that more rather than less directly grapples with that is something that I think I do find inherently compelling. It’s not a part of any kind of mission statement that I made for myself, that I only work on things where death is a pre-occupation but I can’t deny the themes. I don’t think life is beautiful or sublime or any of those things in spite of the fact that we’re all going to die but because of it.\n\nSarachan: You’ve said in the past that an actor can fall into old habits by playing the same character for too long. How does performing the same words night after night in theatre compare to playing the same character year after year on TV? How do you strive to keep your work fresh in either medium?\n\nHall: Yeah it’s different because you’re moving through different material on a TV show, you know? And then you shot it and then it’s gone, and you’re on to the next episode and but you may well be playing scenes of moments that feel quite similar to ones you’ve played in previous scenes or in previous episodes. Whereas if you’re doing something on stage, you’re doing the same material night after night in the hope that you are, in terms of your own experience and in terms of the experience that you engender in an audience, you’re hoping you’re doing something new and new. So they’re sort of polar opposites in that way. But I don’t know, I feel like this piece is rich enough that it’s something that will sustain my interest for the time of the run and maybe beyond. I think that because there’s a different room full of people who aren’t only watching it but who are my not just primary but exclusive partner, you know, make it sort of its own thing each time and keep it fresh.\n\nSarachan: Sometimes actors’ names become synonymous with a certain iconic character they’ve portrayed. For you, I’m guessing this role is Dexter Morgan. Is there something about the anonymity of the theatre that has allowed you freedom away from always being associated with that character?\n\nHall: Yeah, I think so. Definitely, I’m associated with that character obviously and yeah, the chance to mix it up and do different things and create a body of work that’s about a body of work, not just one role is...yeah, I mean it’s something that I cherish. Playing parts for a long time can be really challenging and rewarding in its way, and I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of doing it again, but you know, going from thing to thing has been a lot of fun.\n\nThom Pain (based on nothing) is playing an extended run through December 2nd at The Signature Theatre www.signaturetheatre.org"
