        "text": "Most are familiar with actor Michael C. Hall from his well-known role as the lead character on the hugely successful, long-running tv series Dexter. Although the popular series ended in 2013, Hall has since been enjoying a prosperous career in TV, film, and on stage.\n\nHowever, the multi-talented actor's personal life has been a point of interest possibly even more than his work has lately. Even though Hall is currently married to Morgan MacGregor, some recent comments he's made regarding his sexuality have caused rumors to swirl about the actor's romantic life. In addition, Hall and MacGregor seem to like keeping things pretty low-key so their relationship has been fairly private.\n\nSo who is Michael C. Hall's wife and what do we know about their relationship? Here are some details about Morgan MacGregor and her secretive relationship with the successful actor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Hall and MacGregor married in 2016.\n\nPhoto: Daily Mail\n\nHall has been married to MacGregor for over two years now. The couple dated for four years prior to getting married. The union came as a shock to fans, who didn't even know that the actor was even dating anyone. The only other information known about the ceremony was that they were married in New York City Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. MacGregor is a successful writer.\n\nShe's a writer and book critic for the Los Angeles Review Of Books. MacGregor is also working on writing her own novel and planning to open her own bookstore. Her success is believed to have earned her a current net worth of $2 million.\n\n3. They keep their relationship extremely private.\n\nHall and MacGregor aren't the kind of couple you'll find taking selfies and sharing sweet sentiments through social media. They keep their relationship on the down-low.\n\nHall himself has stated that he doesn't like to talk about the relationship because he believes that it's a part of his life that \"doesn't belong to anyone else.\" However, the actor did open up a little bit about his wife in a recent interview. \"She’s just an incredible friend and is a remarkable combination of intelligence and kindness, and she’s able to tell me the truth that in a way that I can actually stomach.” Hall also said that he values her input on his career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also revealed that the couple has thought about adding to their family. “It’s no news to anyone but it’s a crazy world, and bringing somebody into that world for a front-row seat is something that gives me pause. But it’s also something we talk and think about.”\n\n4. It's Hall's third marriage.\n\nThe actor married twice before his relationship with MacGregor. His first marriage was to actress Amy Spanger, who he was married to from 2002-2006. She appeared on the HBO series Six Feet Under with Hall, who had a starring role.\n\nThen, in 2008, the actor married his Dexter co-star Jennifer Carpenter. They separated in 2010. Carpenter spoke out about the relationship a few years after the couple got divorced. \"Our marriage didn't look like anyone else's, and our divorce didn't either, so…I said it before, just because the marriage ended doesn't mean the love did,\" Carpenter said in an interview. \"I'm crying. It's an awkward thing to talk about your personal life in front of a bunch of strangers, but there's nothing but love and respect [between us]. Nothing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHall also commented on being able to have a working relationship with Carpenter even after they separated. \"I would say the fact that Jennifer and I worked through whatever was going on with us personally the way we did and maintained telling the story was never in question,\" he explained. \"It was always what we needed or wanted to do.\"\n\n5. Is Hall gay?\n\nSome of the actor's most prominent roles have been as gay men. Hall has commented before on how these roles have impacted his career. \"If it weren’t for the invitation on the part of gay writers, composers, and directors, I probably wouldn’t have my career!\" When he was asked why he's drawn to these types of roles, Hall said, \"I don’t know. I feel like I choose roles, and I also feel like roles choose me at times. I think I gravitate toward characters who are defined by some sense of conflict or secret keeping.\"\n\nHe explained further about his choice to play these characters, sating, \"There is something about people, for one reason or the other, who are marginalized by their circumstance that is compelling to me. That has manifested itself into me playing a few, or more than a few, characters who are gay.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor recently opened up about his own sexuality, remarking that it's \"fluid.\" “I think there’s a spectrum. I am on it. I’m heterosexual. But if there was a percentage, I would say I was not all the way heterosexual. I think playing the emcee required me to fling a bunch of doors wide open because that character I imagined as pansexual,\" he said. “Yeah, like I made out with Michael Stuhlbarg every night doing that show. I think I have always leaned into any fluidity in terms of my sexuality.”\n\nWhen Hall was asked if he's attracted to men, he responded, \"No. I mean, I was attracted to John Cameron Mitchell when I saw Hedwig. But no, as a rule I am heterosexual.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSloane Solomon is a YourTango editor and writer who covers pop culture, lifestyle topics, and love and relationships."
