        "text": "\"National Enquirer (May 23, 2011) seems to want to do a gay story on Michael C. Hall, so it settles for saying he's \"now hanging out with his gay buddies\" in order to be assisted in finding a new girlfriend:\n\n\"'Michael has a ton of gay friends and he's having a blast hanging with them until he meets Ms. Right,'said a close source.\"\n\nThey include a note that Hall was seen partying at The Abbey gay bar in WeHo.\"\n\nBut none of you ever saw Michael C. Hall at The Abbey?\n\nI got this private message because I posted on IMDB that I think Michael C. Hall is gay. Actually I got the same message three times...\n\n\"Maybe he's gay. That's not the point. I don't care if he's gay or not but since he claims that he isn't gay, that is obviosly the way he wants it.\n\nThe point is, he wants people to beleive that he is straight. As a fan of him you should respect that.\n\nIf he's gay, then let him be the one to come out with it.\"\n\nWhat kind of person post something like this? I simply said I'm a fan and I think he's gay.\n\nTo send it to me once, is one thing but to send the message three times (for no reason), it makes me a little angry.\n\nHis marriage broke up because of his affair with a guest actress on Dexter. Then even before his divorce was complete he was with some (female) makeup artist on set.\n\nThe fraus on gossip sites went insane with rage at how his wife (Jennifer Carpenter)had stood by him through his cancer and the first thing he did, as soon as he was physically able, was to cheat on her at her place of work. It was an utter shit storm considering hes just a cable TV actor.\n\nSo yeah, I'ld bet my limbs that he is a gay-friendly, straight slut.\n\nI wasn't going to post this almost two years ago when the thread started, but now, since no one will see it because everyone hates the God-damned old-thread-bump troll, I'll just say that I love the way the head of his cock gets really engorged and red when he's getting close. I suck it very gently until he's going crazy (He loves edging) and the head just keeps getting bigger and bigger, like it's going to explode. He pants really fast, and his lisp becomes noticeable (Those fat lips start working with, \"O fuck yeah O fuck yeah\"). Beads of sweat form on that beautiful forehead of his and he starts shaking. Then he gets demanding. \"Make it cum! Suck that cum out!\" I know it's time to finish, because otherwise he gets rough, jabbing his fat cock down my throat and laughing when I gag. So I run my tongue up and down the shaft, and he starts to spurt, and right away I pop the glans into my mouth and just let him pump and pump and pump. By then he's moaning and whining - it's really cute - and the big man is gone and he's like a guy with his first time. He really feels it. I can tell every nerve ending is alive and crazed with electrical charges. Red-heads are like that. They're more sensitive. And then I clean him up, which he likes. He's quiet, and starting to come down, back to the \"straight actor dicking the chicks\" again. But I know better. I've cum in my shorts without even touching myself. And then our respective lunch breaks are over and we go our separate ways, but I know he'll be back with his not-so-subtle call: \"You hungry?\" And I'll say, \"I could eat a horse\" and in 15 minutes he's here.\n\nFuck off, r24. I never even consided him gay or straight when he played David but when I saw him as Dexter I thought he really pinged. I mean he is gayer than gay...so take your stupid PR shit some where else.\n\nTo be frank, when I saw him with Jennifer Carpenter I just thought, lesbian and gay man helping each other out. It didn't bother me but then that ridiculous story that he was banging Stiles...they were not even hot together on the show.\n\nSome here say he used to love chorus boys when he was on Broadway. Also when I mentioned he was in the play Corpus Christi, someone else said, \"if he was in Corpus Christi, he's gay.\" I've never seen Corpus Christi.\n\nI guess he plays gay well and has played a few gay characters. But an actor should be able to play different roles well...so, that's not the reason I think he's gay. I really just think he is gay because he pings and it's true I have seen supposedly straight men who ping even more then Hall but they weren't actors. I do feel really puzzled about men who ping but apparently live their whole life as straight. I mean, you can't ask them about it but you KNOW when they were young, they were abused by their peers.\n\nI had never heard that Amy Spanger walked in on him having sex with another guy, but his marriage to her was VERY brief, and it happened right around the time he was starting to get the star push (before \"Dexter\") I always assumed that she was bearding for him.\n\nThe first time I ever saw him onstage, years before \"Dexter,\" I thought to myself, \"This guy is good-looking in a kind of odd way, but he'll never have a career because he's so obviously gay.\" And it wasn't a gay role; it was that production of MACBETH with Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett.\n\nDidn't I read somewhere that Hall himself has said he's \"bisexual?\" Who knows what the truth is? I personally don't care, because I'm not a fan of his acting."
