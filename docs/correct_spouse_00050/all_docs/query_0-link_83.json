        "text": "Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Lazarus star Michael C Hall got married to his girlfriend Morgan Macgregor on monday.\n\nMichael C. Hall and Macgregor tied the knot on Monday, at New York City Hall. Details about the wedding are scarce\n\nThis marks Michael C.Hall was previously married to Amy Spanger and Jennifer Carpenter.\n\nHall is best known for his role as the serial killer vigilante Dexter on the hit Showtime series of the same name.\n\nCurrently, Hall is starring off-Broadway in David Bowie’s Lazarus. Following Bowie’s death, Hall released a statement saying, (via Billboard):\n\n\"I woke up on a Monday morning and had many texts and found out and was really gratified and humbled by the fact that we had actually scheduled to record the album that day.\n\n\"So we all went into the studio as we had planned and we're really thankful that we were able to get together and honor him. ... It's really one of the most special and humbling experiences I've had as an actor, to play that role and to take part in telling that story and helping to create something that was in the final chapter of Bowie's artistic output. It was really incredible.\"\n\n© 2024 Classicalite All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission."
