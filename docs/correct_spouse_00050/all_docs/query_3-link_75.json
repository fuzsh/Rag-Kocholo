        "text": "The wedding was super simple and no fuss, with Michael and Morgan saying their “I Do’s” at New York City Hall in a civil ceremony. They’ve dated since 2012, when they made their first public appearance together at that year’s Emmy Awards ceremony. Michael also found himself someone who has all goods because not only is Morgan stunningly beautiful, she’s a smart one as well, being a Los Angeles-based book reviewer and novelist who has also worked as an associate editor at the Los Angeles Review of Books.\n\nMichael started dating Morgan less than a year after his marriage to his TV sister on Dexter, Jennifer Carpenter, came to a sad end. Jen was there by his side as the Golden Globe winner fought a successful battle against Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2010, and they remained civil after their 2011 divorce, continuing on the Showtime series until it ended in 2013. Do you miss Dexter? If so click here to pick up the complete series!\n\nThe former Six Feet Under star’s first marriage was to fellow actress wed to actress Amy Spangler from 2002 to 2007. The couple met while working on the Broadway production of the musical Chicago, but split after five years."
