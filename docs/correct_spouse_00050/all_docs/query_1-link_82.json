        "text": "The United States Eventing Association (USEA) is pleased to announce the extension of its partnership with Horse & Country (H&C), the leading international sports network, to provide exclusive streaming and video coverage of the 2024 USEA American Eventing Championships (AEC) presented by Nutrena Feeds. H&C will also be joining forces with the USEA as a Platinum Level Sponsor of the AEC.\n\nThe AEC is the only national eventing championship of this size in all of North America and this year’s event will take place at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky, from Aug. 27- Sept. 1.\n\nThis year’s coverage will be better than ever, with some exciting enhancements for 2024 prompted by member feedback. Along with improved live streaming experience, riders will be able to purchase cross-country videos that include every fence on course, through a partnership with Equireel.\n\nThe AEC serves as the pinnacle annual championship for eventing, encompassing every level from Starter to the prestigious $60,000 Adequan USEA Advanced Final. Building on last year's success, H&C will globally broadcast live coverage of all three phases of the $60,000 Adequan USEA Advanced Final, alongside selected coverage from all other divisions throughout the duration of the event.\n\nThe livestream will be available for free to all USEA members and fans, via a 7-day free trial to Horse & Country’s streaming service, H&C+. Viewers can also enjoy on-demand access to all the action through H&C+ memberships or pay-per-view passes, with clips available for purchase. H&C+ Gold members can enjoy unlimited clip streaming and download as part of their subscription. For a detailed streaming schedule, visit www.horseandcountry.tv.\n\n“The opportunity to provide full coverage of the cross-country phase at every level of the AEC is extremely exciting,” said H&C Director of Content Jonathan Rippon. “The AEC is a premier event on H&C’s U.S. Eventing Channel and can be enjoyed by our entire worldwide audience. Offering the clipping service for every round and every competitor through our partnership with Equireel is an incredible added value as well.”\n\nWhat to Expect for 2024\n\nOne of the most exciting advancements for the livestream for the 2024 AEC is that it will be available at no charge during the week of the event via a 7-day free trial of H&C+ for all viewers. On-demand coverage will be accessible post-event through the H&C website and app and a 15% discount will be available for all USEA AEC competitors.\n\nThe livestream schedule for 2024 will be as follows:\n\nTuesday, Aug. 27: All dressage from one ring (Ring TBD)\n\nWednesday, Aug. 28: Advanced Dressage and all cross-country\n\nThursday, Aug. 29: All cross-country and all show jumping\n\nFriday, Aug. 30: All cross-country and all show jumping\n\nSaturday, Aug. 31: All cross-country and all show jumping\n\nSunday, Sept. 1: All show jumping\n\nIn addition, H&C has partnered with Equireel to offer complete fence-by-fence coverage of every cross-country round across each division. These videos will be made available for purchase to competitors same-day and pricing is as follows:\n\nCross-Country full round: $169\n\nShow jumping full round: $25\n\nDressage full round: $25\n\nComplete package of all three phases: $199\n\nThere will be approximately 35 cameras placed on course by Equireel for competitor video purchasing, so that riders may have videos of their full courses this year. The livestream coverage will be slightly different, and will feature about five cameras strategically placed to cover as much of each cross-country course as possible for the live viewership. The live stream will also utilize picture-in-picture coverage to represent more than one rider at a time.\n\n\"We are genuinely excited to see improvements in the livestream, and personal competition videos made available to our members and followers this year,\" said SEA CEO Rob Burk. \"H&C is a leader in the market, and we continue to value them as a partner.”\n\nAs a part of their Platinum level sponsorship, H&C has elected to sponsor both Starter divisions in their inaugural year at the AEC. These divisions will be named the Horse & Country USEA Open Starter Division and the Horse & Country Junior Starter Division.\n\nStay tuned for further updates on how to access the livestream for the 2024 USEA AEC.
