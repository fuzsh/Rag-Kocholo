        "text": "Dexter star Michael C. Hall reveals he's not 'all the way heterosexual' as he talks about his 'fluid' sexuality.\n\nThe married actor has admitted that he does not have a conventional attitude towards sex.\n\nThe 47-year-old told The Daily Beast: \"I think there's a spectrum. I am on it. I'm heterosexual. But if there was a percentage, I would say I was not all the way heterosexual.\"\n\nAnd the talented performer explained that playing the emcee in Sam Mendes' 1999 Broadway revival of Cabaret, required him to, 'fling a bunch of doors open,' adding he has, 'always leaned into any fluidity in terms of my sexuality.'\n\nHall has been married to his third wife Morgan McGregor since February 2016, after marriages to his Dexter co-star Jennifer Carpenter from 2008 to 2011 and Amy Spanger from 2002 to 2006.\n\nAnd he appears to prefer intimate relationships with women rather than men although he has a 'craving for an emotional intimacy with a man.'\n\n\"I had an appetite to have emotional connections with men beyond beer, sports, and fist pumping that were considered gay,\" Hall added.\n\nThe star believes that these desires could have been sparked by the fact that his father passed away from cancer when he was only 11-years-old.\n\n\"I don't mean to suggest that an emotional relationship between a father and son is any way homoerotic,\" he added.\n\n\"I mean an emotional intimacy or connection that at least in the milieu I grew up in was considered fey.\"\n\nAfter playing the emcee in Cabaret, Hall played iconic gay TV character David Fisher on Six Feet Under."
