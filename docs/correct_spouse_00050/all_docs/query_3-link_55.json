        "text": "Dexter stars and real-life husband-and-wife Michael C Hall and Jennifer Carpenter have announced their divorce just days after the drama wrapped up its fifth season.\n\nThe twosome were married on December 31, 2008, after meeting on the set of Dexter in 2006. Their reps revealed the actors have been separated for some time, though the split was \"amicable\".\n\nBut here's the juicy gossip: apparently everyone on the Dexter set knew they were totally getting a divorce because Jennifer's been \"going around... talking about the couple's problems during the course of the show’s production\". Now everyone's worried about how Michael and Jennifer — who play brother-and-sister Dexter and Deb — are going to work together during the show's recently announced sixth season.\n\nDoes this mean Deb is going to die?"
