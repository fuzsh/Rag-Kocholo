        "text": "Amy Spanger and Michael Hall at the Once on This Island benefit concert May 12\n\nPhoto by Aubrey Reuben\n\n\"Six Feet Under\" star Michael C. Hall will join the Broadway company of Chicago on July 30.\n\nHall, who portrays the uptight gay brother on the acclaimed HBO series \"Six Feet Under,\" will star as Billy Flynn in Kander and Ebb's Chicago, which is currently in its sixth year on The Great White Way. A week later, Hall will be joined by his new wife, actress Amy Spanger, who starred as Bianca in the Tony-winning revival of Kiss Me, Kate. Spanger will be the newest Roxie Hart — a role she played in the musical's national tour — beginning Aug. 6. She is heard on the cast album of tick, tick...BOOM! Hall is expected to stay with the Broadway production through mid-September, when he will return to California to begin shooting the new season of \"Six Feet Under,\" the hour-long Sunday drama about a dysfunctional family that runs a funeral parlor. Hall was last on Broadway in another revival, when he replaced Alan Cumming as the Emcee in Cabaret. His other New York theatre credits include Macbeth, Cymbeline, Timon of Athens, The English Teachers and Corpus Christi.\n\nMexico City's Bianca Marroquin stars as Roxie through July 7; Belle Calaway will return to the role on July 9. Others in the current cast include Stephanie Pope as Velma Kelly, P.J. Benjamin as Amos Hart (Rob Bartlett takes over the role of Amos on July 9), George Hamilton as Billy Flynn, Alix Korey as Matron Mama Morton (Roz Ryan assumes the role of Mama Morton on July 30) and R. Bean as Mary Sunshine."
