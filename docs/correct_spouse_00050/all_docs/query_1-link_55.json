        "text": "At peace with God on Tuesday, July 2nd, 2024.\n\nIt is with extreme sadness the family of Elizabeth Hall announce her passing on July 2nd, 2024 at the age of 50. Elizabeth was the beloved wife of Phillip Hall; adoring mother of Evan Hall and Aiden Hall; cherished daughter of Pat Futhey (nee Quinlan) and the late Dale Futhey; loving sister of Michael (Chris) Futhey, Daniel (Cyndy) Futhey, Joseph Futhey, Therese Futhey, Amy (the late Ric) Bischoff, Megan (Chris) Issitt, Timothy Futhey, James Futhey, and the late Kevin Futhey, Matthew Futhey, and Kathleen Futhey; a dear aunt, cousin, Godmother, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law, and friend.\n\nElizabeth was an alum of Webster Groves High School where she graduated in 1992. However, later in life she found her home in the Affton community, helping in her kids’ classrooms, at book fairs, in her neighborhood and anywhere else that she could. Elizabeth had a unique and tremendous talent in finding the beauty in just about anything. She found beauty in the many places she traveled and in the outdoors, especially hiking with her family in the mountains. She was an artist in every way. Her drawings were masterpieces. Her photography captured the beauty in people’s biggest moments; as well as the beauty in the scenery that others might overlook. She was able to take any piece of furniture that others discarded as trash and turn it into something magnificent. She could take tiny trinkets, and pictures and transform a room into the grandest, most comforting place. She did this so well that her home became a safe, welcoming place for multiple generations of kids both in and out of her family.\n\nElizabeth loved hard, and showed that in many ways. She was a protector, and an advocate for everyone that she cared about. She was there to listen, and to help her family and friends come up with a plan whenever needed. She celebrated the people she cared about, in ways that were unique and special to them. And she challenged the people she loved to be the best versions of themselves. Though her presence will be missed greatly by all who were ever blessed by it, her love is still here showing in many ways.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider making a contribution to financially support Phil and his children by clicking the link below.\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/assist-phil-and-the-kids-in-their-time-of-need?utm_source=copy_link&utm_medium=customer&utm_campaign=man_sharesheet_ft&attribution_id=sl:9a0ccfd2-634d-45f1-997f-80b4c683b58a"
