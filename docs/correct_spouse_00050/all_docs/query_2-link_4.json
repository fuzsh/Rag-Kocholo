        "text": "Hall and Carpenter met when Dexter began filming in 2006. Playing a brother and (foster) sister who both work for the Miami Metro Police Department - Hall as Dexter Morgan and Carpenter as Deb - the actors spent a lot of time together on the set.\n\nThe close relationship between the siblings on screen continued behind the scenes, and Carpenter says the two shared a connection as actors and became good friends. \"I know that if I asked him for something that I needed to try something a certain way that he would see me and hear me and that he could do the same with me,\" she said in a 2013 interview.\n\nHall divorced Amy Spanger not long after Dexter began filming and was newly single. The relationship between Carpenter and Hall turned romantic a few months later, but both actors wanted to keep the details private and have not publicly spoken much about it. \"It’s sacred for an actor to keep their personal life personal,\" Carpenter said.\n\nHall and Carpenter dated for a year and a half while filming Dexter. They kept their relationship a secret the entire time.\n\nThough the public may not have known what was going on between the actors, it was obvious that they held one another in high regard. Both Hall and Carpenter praised each other in interviews. Hall went so far as to say:\n\nI've never had a better scene partner than Jennifer. Her generosity, volatility of her performance, sense of danger she brings to the dynamic, commitment, sense of investment, I'm astonished watching her.\n\nIn return, Carpenter praised Hall by noting, \"Michael sets the tone for the entire show.\"\n\nAfter a year and a half of dating secretly, Hall and Carpenter decided to tie the knot. They kept this decision a secret as well, eloping on New Year's Eve 2008.\n\nAccording to Hall's representative, the couple married in Big Sur during an outdoor ceremony, and Carpenter carried white roses in a bouquet that held the wedding band of her grandfather. The two made their first public appearance as a couple a few days later at the 2009 Golden Globes. As Carpenter and Hall walked the red carpet, they posed together for photographers, who now saw their pairing in a new light.\n\nLuckily, being a married couple who work together didn't cause them any stress. \"Sometimes we eat lunch together but that's about as crazy as it gets for us as a couple on set,\" Carpenter later said.\n\nWhen Hall was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010, he kept it a secret from Dexter's cast and crew. \"He kept it from us until the very end, because he didn’t want anyone to feel sorry for him,\" remembers executive producer Sara Colleton. \"He didn't want us to stop production. He never wavered, particularly as the episodes progressed toward the end of the season, and it was physically grueling.\"\n\nHall eventually made the news public at the Golden Globes that year by wearing a knit cap on the red carpet.\n\nCarpenter stuck by his side throughout his treatment and recovery, and described the intense experience as \"an 11\" on a scale of one to 10. She recalled:\n\nTo have life come at you in such a big way, from the second Michael was diagnosed until we finally heard the doctors say he's going to be okay, was beyond anything I've ever experienced.\n\nBut Carpenter also found some positivity in the experience, saying it made the couple appreciate each other even more than before. \"In a strange way, his illness was the best thing that ever happened to us,\" she remarked.\n\nTwo years after they married, rumors began to circulate that Hall and Carpenter were having difficulty working together on the set. At the finale party for Dexter's fifth season, Carpenter reportedly appeared alone. One day later, a spokesperson for the couple confirmed, \"Having been separated for some time, Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall have filed for divorce.\"\n\nDespite their personal problems with each other, both actors claimed their separation would not affect the show. In a statement, Carpenter said:\n\nI would like to reassure all Dexter fans that the show is and always has been paramount. We've always done a nice job of protecting it and each other. We play important roles in each other's lives and always will.\n\nAfter they broke up during Dexter's Season 5, Hall and Carpenter remained coworkers for three more seasons. For many people, this sounds like it would be awful, but the couple made it work.\n\n\"We certainly pride ourselves in being professionals,\" Hall said. \"We work on the same show but we're not in every scene together. We don't see each other on set as often as you'd think.\"\n\nCarpenter felt the same way and noted, \"There's nothing but love and respect [between us]. Nothing.\"\n\nProfessionalism at their craft helped the couple focus on the show rather than themselves. Hall said maintaining a sharp distinction between their personal and professional lives was \"never in question\" for the two."
