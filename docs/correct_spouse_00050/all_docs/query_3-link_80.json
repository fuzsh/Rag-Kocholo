        "text": "Dexter And His Sister Are Getting A Divorce\n\nMark December 13th as the day that true love jumped in a casket and closed the door! First we find out that Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens' completely authentic love is over and now they're telling us that Dexter's Michael C. Hall and his TV sister Jennifer Carpenter are legally quitting each other?! Who the hell is next?! Rojo Caliente and Cynthia Nixon?! If that happens, we can stick our Match.com profiles in the compost bin and stick with finding ten-second dick on Grindr, because that will be a confirmation that love is not a real thing!\n\nEntertainment Weekly reports that Jennifer and Michael filed for divorce after only 2 years of marriage. During that time, Jennifer supported Michael as he battled Hodgkin’s lymphoma. They issued this joint statement:\n\n“Having been separated for some time, Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall have filed for divorce.”\n\nAccess Hollywood's sources say that Michael and Jennifer have been fighting on the set of Dexter for months and she's been telling the crew about their problems. The cast and crew is apparently worried about next season since it looks like Michael and Jennifer hate each other the same way I hate b*tches who don't say \"thank you\" when I open the door for them (I HATE THAT!).\n\nYou know, I should've started this post with the words SPOILER ALERT since we all know who's character is getting killed off next season. Freshen up that resume, Jennifer.\n\ndlisted\n\nDexter Moves Fast\n\nIf the #1 item on your cum bucket list is to hump on Michael C. Hall, then all you have to do is join the cast of Dexter and there's a really good chance you'll be able to scratch it off your list with the fake blood you used as lube to give him a handjob. Michael's marriage to his TV sister is about to be snuffed out and there are several reports alleging that the bullet came from Julia Stiles' vagina.\n\nMichael and Jennifer Carpenter announced they were getting a divorce on Monday, but apparently he's been getting on Julia, who plays his love interest on Dexter, since at least October. That's what this semi-blind item from Lainey Gossip is whispering anyway:\n\nI mentioned yesterday that there are a few more details about one of the recent splits announced in Hollywood this week. Turns out there was someone else: his love interest this season on his tv show. Their chemistry was so crazy and so evident to everyone that writer and producers, seeing it play out on set, actually cranked up their sex scenes to capture it for show. Her career has seen a resurgence since.\n\nEventually the two fell in love. They were together, very close, at a Halloween party in New York this fall hosted by a famously controversial writer (this isn’t a super important detail) and those who observed them that night are not surprised now that he’s ended it with his wife.\n\nA source also tells Showbiz Spy that Michael and Julia hung out this week and he was caught kissing her nalgas with his eyes, “Michael was checking out Julia’s butt. He seemed fine though. You would never tell his marriage had just collapsed.”\n\nDamn. When Dexter gets messy, he gets seriously messy. One minute he's fuc*ing his co-star in his trailer, and the next minute he's doing a scene with his estranged wife who plays his sister. And I bet Dexter didn't even bother spraying Binaca in his mouth to hide the scent of Julia's chocha on his breath! A new meaning to awkward.\n\ndlisted\n\nJulia Stiles Says She Had 'Absolutely Nothing to Do' with Michael C. Hall Split\n\nWith paperwork officially being filed in the Michael C. Hall/ Jennifer Carpenter divorce, Julia Stiles says she had nothing to do with the break-up. Julia, who played Michael's onscreen love interest in the fifth season of Dexter, issued a statement on the matter after rumors swirled yesterday that she broke up the couple's marriage.\n\nMichael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter appeared together at the Primetime Emmy Awards on August 29, 20 days after they separated, according to court documents. (Pacific Coast News)\n\n\"I have absolutely nothing to do with the split between Michael and Jennifer. We are good friends and enjoyed working together,\" Stiles said in the statement.\n\n\"This is a personal matter between them, and we should respect their privacy. Although I too prefer to keep my private life private, I felt compelled to dispel the rumors I was somehow the cause for this matter.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Michael and Jennifer confirmed the split on Monday, and according to court documents obtained by TMZ they've been separated since August 9. That's 20 days before they appeared on the red carpet at the Emmys together. It's also two months before rumors place Michael and Julia together at a Halloween party in New York. So it's possible that if Juila is or ever was seeing Michael, it could have started after he separated from Jennifer.\n\nLooks like the dust hasn't quite settled on the matter yet.\n\nzimbio"
