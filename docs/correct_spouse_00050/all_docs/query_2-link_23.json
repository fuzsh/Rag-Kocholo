        "text": "Dexter stars Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter made the show even more interesting due to their relationship. While filming for the series, they met on the set, fell in love, got married, and divorced. Still, they had to work together and be professional about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHall and Carpenter played brother and sister in the show, with the former being the titular psychopath character and the latter being the cop. Their dynamics as siblings in the show were great, but of course, they did not have that kind of chemistry. Still, the actors found it difficult to resist that blossoming romance between them.\n\nRELATED: “It’s like having love affairs after a marriage”: Michael C. Hall Had a Unique Experience Playing Another Killer Despite Getting ‘Boxed in’ as Dexter for Life\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDexter Co-Stars Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter Continued Working Together Even After Divorce\n\nMichael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter announced that they were officially dating in 2007, a year after they met on the set of Dexter. The following year, they decided to tie the knot in a secret ceremony. Because it was an elopement, their families were not present during the big day. Hall confirmed this via The Guardian:\n\n“In the strictest term, I think it means that you go off and get married on your own, with whatever parties are necessary to make it legitimate and legal – perhaps to some exotic location, but that’s not necessary.”\n\nThe pair continued working on Dexter after their marriage. Later in 2009, Hall revealed he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The actor was able to survive the illness through intense treatment, but a year later, his marriage with Carpenter was over. Even though they have separated ways, they still had a special bond.\n\nRELATED: “I said ‘no’”: John Lithgow Originally Refused Dexter – 6 Stars Who Could’ve Been Just as Good as Trinity Killer in an Alternate Timeline\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ex-couple did not let their divorce affect their jobs. At a Farewell to Dexter event in Los Angeles, they were asked how they managed to continue working with each other. Hall and Carpenter responded:\n\n“It was gratifying. It was what we needed and wanted to do. Our marriage didn’t look like anyone else’s, and our divorce didn’t either. Just because our marriage ended doesn’t mean the love did.”\n\nThey remain civil towards each other and even joke about things on the set of Dexter: New Blood. Their previous marriage did not become a hindrance to getting along at work.\n\nRELATED: “I’m actively working on this”: Showtime CEO Confirms More Dexter Projects in the Works After Conclusive New Blood Storyline\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho Is Michael C. Hall’s Current Partner?\n\nMichael C. Hall is currently married to Morgan Macgregor, a book reviewer and fiction writer, while Jennifer Carpenter is with musician Seth Avett.\n\nFans were surprised when they found out Hall married again in 2016 because his partner takes her privacy very seriously. They dated for four years before tying the knot. This is Hall’s third marriage as he was previously wedded to Amy Spanger in 2002.\n\nMeanwhile, Carpenter gave birth to a son in 2015. Hall currently has no children with Macgregor or from any of his previous marriages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite leading different lives, the ex-couple had no problems working on the set of Dexter. Even their co-stars noticed how they were very cool with each other that nobody would guess anything had happened in the past between the pair."
