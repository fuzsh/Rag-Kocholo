        "text": "MICHAEL C Hall has tied the knot for the third time.\n\nThe Dexter star, 45, was spotted at City Hall in New York City on Monday morning, where witnesses said he was getting married to Morgan Macgregor, a book critic working in Los Angeles, The New York Post reports.\n\nGetting hitched on February 29 means they won’t celebrate their first wedding anniversary until the next leap year: 2020.\n\nHall and Macgregor have dated since 2012, first appearing together publicly at the Emmy Awards that year.\n\nHall, who has reportedly listed his LA home for $US4.85 million ($6.8 million), has been married twice before.\n\nHe split from his then-wife and Dexter co-star Jennifer Carpenter in 2011. The separation made headlines when Hall’s then-co-star Julia Stiles issued a statement denying reports she was to blame for the end of his marriage.\n\nHall was previously wed to Amy Spanger.\n\nHall will next appear in Christine about the late anchorwoman Christine Chubbuck with Rebecca Hall. The flick played at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.\n\nMost recently, he starred in David Bowie’s musical Lazarus."
