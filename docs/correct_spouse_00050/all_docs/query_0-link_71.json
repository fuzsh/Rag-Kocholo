        "text": "What could be more awkward than being married to your TV sister? Why, being divorced from her. \"Dexter\" co-stars Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter, siblings onscreen, have filed for divorce after less than two years of marriage, Entertainment Weekly reports.\n\nA joint statement from the reps says that they split up some time back, and that, of course, the split is amicable. The couple met on the set of Showtime's \"Dexter,\" in which Hall (\"Six Feet Under\") plays a blood splatter expert and serial killer with a unique code of ethics, and Carpenter plays his detective sister. Hall, who was previously married to Broadway star Amy Spanger (\"Elf,\" \"Rock of Ages\") was treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma earlier this year."
