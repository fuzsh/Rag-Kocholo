        "text": "“Dexter” star Michael C. Hall got candid about his sexuality in a new interview with the Daily Beast.\n\n“I think there’s a spectrum. I am on it. I’m heterosexual. But if there was a percentage, I would say I was not all the way heterosexual,” Hall, 47, says.\n\nHall has portrayed a few LGBT characters during his career including Broadway roles as the emcee in “Cabaret” and Hedwig in “Hedwig and the Angry Itch.” He also played David on the TV series “Six Feet Under.”\n\n“I think playing the emcee required me to fling a bunch of doors wide open because that character I imagined as pansexual,” Hall continued. “Yeah, like I made out with Michael Stuhlbarg every night doing that show. I think I have always leaned into any fluidity in terms of my sexuality.”\n\nHall, who is married to his third wife Morgan Macgregor, says he has “never had an intimate relationship with a man.” However, he believes it’s because of the death of his father who passed away when he just 11 years old.\n\n“I think, maybe because of an absent father, there has definitely been a craving for an emotional intimacy with a man,” Hall says. “I don’t mean to suggest that an emotional relationship between a father and son is any way homoerotic. I mean an emotional intimacy or connection that at least in the milieu I grew up in was considered fey. I had an appetite to have emotional connections with men beyond beer, sports, and fist-pumping that were considered ‘gay.’ ”\n\nHall married MacGregor in 2016. Previously, he was also married to his “Dexter” co-star Jennifer Carpenter from 2008-2011 and actress Amy Spanger from 2002-2007.\n\nFriday, July 19\n\n“Center Aging Friday Tea Time” will be at 2 p.m. on Zoom.

And then May brought the unexpected death of his beloved Vizsla hound Mabel, named for the heroine in Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Pirates of Penzance.”\n\nSo, for much of 2024, Smith had been spending time healing at his farmhouse in Ellicott City, Md. Until now. Currently, he’s back on the boards at Olney Theatre Center playing record producer Don Kirshner in “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical,” a fun juke box musical about the early career years of singer/songwriter King from her Brooklyn roots to writing hits from an office in Times Square with her lyricist husband Gerry Goffin and on to Los Angeles solo-stardom.\n\nWASHINGTON BLADE: Hey Bobby, you’ve been through a lot since we last spoke.\n\nBOBBY SMITH: It’s been a whole lot. I spent the last seven or eight months either at home or going to doctor visits.\n\nBLADE: How is it being back on stage?\n\nSMITH: To be honest, it’s like learning to walk again.\n\nBLADE: And playing the famously deadpan Don Kirshner?\n\nSMITH: It’s good. I don’t do an imitation. Instead, I’ve created a character who’s not over the top; otherwise, it would become the Don Kirshner show and we don’t want that.\n\nBut because there’s not a lot of drama with Carole King, she’s a really kind, nice person, Don serves as a sort of catalyst. He pushes the story forward. He prods Carole to write more songs, to try different things. He doesn’t like her boyfriend. Don the character doesn’t sing much but he’s always barking at people.\n\nBLADE: Sometimes you forget just how many familiar songs King wrote: “Take Good Care of My Baby,” “Up On the Roof,” and “Will You (Still) Love Me Tomorrow” for acts like the Shirelles and The Drifters. And later songs like “It’s Too Late,” “You’ve Got a Friend,” “(You Make Me Feel) Like a Natural Woman,” and of course “Beautiful.”\n\nSMITH: Yeah, it feels like she wrote every song known to mankind; the show tells you that, and we sing most of them.\n\nBLADE: You experienced a highpoint during the rough times. In May, you won a Helen Hayes Award for playing Bruce, the complicated, manic depressive, closeted father in Studio’s production of Alison Bechdel’s “Fun Home.”\n\nSMITH: I did, but unfortunately, I couldn’t make it to the ceremony.\n\nBruce is a sympathetic but difficult character. Ever since being born, people of a certain age, have had to fight our way into the struggle of being gay. It’s not so much a struggle anymore, or I should say not as much as it used to be, but now there are a whole lot more signposts that didn’t exist when I was growing up.\n\nOver the years, people have randomly attacked me for not talking more about my sexuality. I’m not closeted but I don’t feel I have to tell everyone. I don’t share it with my land lady. I don’t need to say “I’m here and I’m queer. Here’s your rent.”\n\nBLADE: You have been in show biz for decades now. What keeps you going?\n\nSMITH: I’m not sure, sometimes I ask myself what was I thinking when I decided to be a professional actor? I feel like I’m making a bigger contribution teaching at Catholic University than I did my entire acting career.\n\nNow that I’ve taken over the tap department, I’m full time at Catholic. I’m also teaching Acting the Text, Directing for Musical Theatre, and in the fall, I’ll add Musical Interpretation.\n\nBLADE: In this summer of so many theatrical choices, why see “Beautiful”?\n\nSMITH: Well, if you don’t already know Natalie Weiss who plays Carole, you should. She’s an amazing compelling, vocalist with one of the healthiest singing voices you’ll ever hear, no straining, perfect placement.\n\nAlso, there’s nothing about “Beautiful” that’s going to make you feel bad, or put you in a place where you might think you need to talk to your therapist. That’s not going to happen. And it’s because Carole King is a positive human being; from an actor’s perspective, you feel great by the end of the show, and the audience gets that. The happiness is infectious.\n\nThe Television Academy has honored dozens of queer creators and queer-themed TV shows in the nominations for the 76th annual Emmy Awards, announced Tuesday in a broadcast hosted by actors Tony Hale and Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph and Tony Hale, along with Academy Chair Cris Abrego, announced the nominees for the 76th Emmy Awards on July 17, 2024.
