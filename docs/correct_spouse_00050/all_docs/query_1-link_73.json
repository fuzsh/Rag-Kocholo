        "text": "From 2001 to 2013, actor Michael C. Hall starred in two of cable television’s most acclaimed series, portraying funeral director David Fisher throughout five seasons of HBO’s Six Feet Under and blood spatter analyst/serial killer Dexter Morgan during an eight season run of Showtime’s Dexter.\n\nFollowing that Golden Globe award winning turn, it was back to his roots. Hall began his career on Broadway, cast in his first major role in 1999 by acclaimed film and stage director Sam Mendes during a Cabaret revival, and headed back to the stage in 2014 for productions of both The Realistic Joneses and rock musical Hedwig and The Angry Inch. New York and London stagings of David Bowie’s Lazarus took him into 2017.\n\nIn Hedwig, Hall took on the role of singer Hedwig Robinson, fronting fictional rock group The Angry Inch, meeting Peter Yanowitz, who portrayed drummer Schlatko, and musical director Matt Katz-Bohen along the way.\n\nYanowitz and Katz-Bohen had worked together outside the production on instrumental tracks, a process which eventually saw Hall chip in on vocals and later lyrics, an organic process that led to the trio’s coming together as Princess Goes To The Butterfly Museum, a band name coined by Katz-Bohen’s young daughter.\n\nYanowitz was the original drummer of 90s alternative hitmakers The Wallflowers, later forming alt rock group Morningwood, and Katz-Bohen has recorded and toured with Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Blondie. Princess Goes To The Butterfly Museum ties together all of it, with David Bowie as a vital collective lynchpin.\n\nThe beauty of their forthcoming debut album Thanks For Coming (now available for pre-order prior to its February 12 release) is in the way it ties together sounds ranging anywhere from synth pop and rock to post punk and disco alongside electronic elements, crafting an identity that’s impossible to pigeonhole.\n\nFor Hall, maintaining that eclecticism was crucial.\n\n“Based on how the record sounds, it seems like it was very important. I think we definitely, as we started to mix it, didn’t want to feel bound by anything,” said the actor and singer, crediting artists like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen as a few favorite lyricists. “We found that we had a lot of musical sensibilities and instincts and we didn’t want to feel like any of them weren’t allowed or couldn’t fit within the sound of the overall museum. We definitely didn’t shy away from creating something that was pretty eclectic.”\n\nI spoke with Michael C. Hall, Peter Yanowitz and Matt Katz-Bohen about Thanks For Coming, the influence of David Bowie and Hall’s mindset as he reapproaches the Dexter Morgan character for a Showtime reboot of Dexter set to begin filming in 2021. A transcript of our video chat, edited for length and clarity, follows below.\n\nSo I read the story of the band kind of coming together while you were all working together on Broadway. For you personally, Michael, moving from almost nonstop TV for more than a decade, what was it like to get back to your Broadway roots?\n\nMICHAEL C. HALL: It was great. The stage was my first experience with acting. And it always feels like coming home. I really did a concentrated amount of it after Dexter ended. And Hedwig was rock and roll fantasy. Along with everything else that job entailed, I got to front a band. And I think that got really good to me. And it sort of led to Lazarus - which, in a way, all of that led to this. So I’m thankful for that show.\n\nWas there a particular moment where it felt like more than just working on songs together and more like a band?\n\nPETER YANOWITZ: The project had such an organic start that it took us a minute to be like, “Wait, what’s happening here?” Usually, at least in my experience, it’s like, “Hey, let’s start a band…” And you get your friends together and go, “OK. Let’s be like this band…” It’s pretty thought out. This one, we had to sort of catch up to what we were doing. It was taking on its own energy.\n\nWe were making instrumental music. And then when Mike came in and actually kind of finished our musical sentences on three or four songs, we were sort of like, “Whatever this is, let’s keep doing it.” And all of the sudden we had ten songs. And then it was like, “I guess we have a set here. We should probably do a show.” It had a very organic start.\n\nMichael, what went through your head as you heard those instrumental tracks for the first time?\n\nMICHAEL: That it made its own sort of sense and that it sounded unlike anything I had quite heard - in terms of maybe the way the musical sensibility and the instrumentation were from different worlds. I just thought it was really compelling and casually said, “If you ever want somebody to sing on this…” Because I thought it would be fun.\n\nWhat was the reaction there early on as you guys started to realize that Michael doesn’t just sound great singing your songs but he’s also contributing to the songwriting process, he’s coming up with these lyrics too? What was it like for you guys seeing that side of him?\n\nPETER: The first time he came over, we went through the song “Love American Style,” which is on our EP. And it was just effortless to complete what we had started. It came out all at once. We didn’t know what we had but when I edited it together after and sent it, I had a “holy sh-t” moment. That happened three or four times in a row where Matt and I went, “This is something…”\n\nMATT KATZ-BOHEN: I thought what Peter and I had was cool and I was really into it. And then I heard what Mike put on top of it. And it elevated it to a whole other level. But I didn’t know what it was. I was like, “What is this? What genre is this? I don’t know. I can’t really describe it or put my finger on it. But I want to hear more…” So I think that was a good jumping off point.\n\nI know that about half of these songs were written during early shelter-in-place orders. Whether it was the benefit of time from suddenly freed up schedules or anything else, what impact did the state of the world have on the songs you guys were creating at that point?\n\nPETER: We instinctively just knew, “OK. Nobody’s going to be playing live for awhile.” I think it was self preservation but we just started sending each other ideas - whether it was ideas that had been around, or maybe didn’t come to anything at another time, and then give them a second look or rearrange things. We weren’t thinking we were going to make a record until it all started to come together more.\n\nIn the beginning, we were just trying to keep each other from losing our minds - because it was such a weird, scary time. A lot of the songs just came out of, “Hey, I sent you an instrumental track…” And then Matt would send it back with something from his studio. Mike would sing upstate or in New York city into his cell phone. And we were just pulling things together. It was cool. Because I don’t think we had one certain way of creating. So the pandemic was an excuse to even explore more ways to create.\n\nIt was interesting to have no rules and see what trouble we could get in by sending each other stuff. Then we’d come back down to the city and record it together. We kept each other in the bubble this year.\n\nObviously David Bowie is a name that has come up in regards to both Princess Goes To The Butterfly Museum and the new album. When I think of Bowie, I think of the fact that every album was approached as a true artistic endeavor. It wasn’t just a collection of songs. There were themes. The videos tied in. It was really all-encompassing. Even at the end, Blackstar probably perfectly encapsulates that. How does the idea of Bowie the artist, not just the musician, inform the whole of what you guys do together in the band?\n\nPETER: Yeah, he had so many sides to him, right? His music, his persona - so that’s inspiring in itself. To feel like you can change gears and not beat down to one definition of who you are. And he could express so many different things with his voice. I think actually that’s one thing that’s amazing about Michael. When I met Michael, he was the singer of Hedwig and I was the drummer. And so I met him as a singer. And then the more I find out, “Oh, you started in choir. And then got into theater. And that led to TV.” But it’s kind of an amazing thing on your resume for the lead singer to be able to embody different emotions. I mean, it feels like a no-brainer that most frontmen in bands should have. But it was really cool to see it play out in how we do vocals and how different Michael’s range can lend itself to our music. It’s pretty cool.\n\nMICHAEL: Yeah, I think Bowie is someone who definitely would characterize himself in different ways over the course of his career. And never felt creatively bound by any precedent he had set. Even within songs he’ll sing in multiple voices, you know? And I always loved that. I think I try to do that too.\n\nMATT: The Hunky Dory album. A song like “The Bewlay Brothers,” where it was like, “Where does that monster voice come from? What the heck?” And then that also has like country sounding rock on it. But “Life On Mars” is orchestral. So that’s just sort of a touchstone. You can really do anything and it doesn’t have to be limited by a genre or a sound or whatever.\n\nMichael, you had the opportunity to work pretty closely with David. Looking back on Lazarus now, what do you think you were able to take from that experience that was applicable to this band?\n\nMICHAEL: I’m sure there are all kinds of unconscious, subliminal things that inform whatever I’m up to or whatever we’re up to. But, consciously, I think the thing, maybe above all others, that wowed me about David was his genuine kindness. And enthusiasm. And an almost childlike sense of glee at being able to collaborate and make things, you know? And for someone of his stature to have that enthusiasm, and also have that sense of decency and humanity that didn’t put people off or keep them at an arm’s length or lord over his iconic status - he just had such a way of putting people at ease. Which is a great quality generally but especially if you’re a rock god.\n\nI think that as much as anything is what echoes from the experience with him.\n\nMichael, you’ve spoken about the time it took to remove yourself from the Dexter Morgan character when Dexter wrapped its initial run. What has it been like preparing yourself to head back into the mindset of that character?\n\nMICHAEL: It’s hard to say because we haven’t actually started shooting it yet. But we will start very soon. I don’t know. That’s a part of what’s exciting about it. I have no idea what it will feel like to return to that character. Not with this much time in between, but I’ve gone back to things on stage and performed shows - but not something where I’m imagining that the character has lived as much life as the time that’s passed would warrant. So I don’t know. It’s going to be a trip. But I’m looking forward to going back and, not just for fans of the show but for myself as well, going back and finding out what the hell happened to that guy.\n\nPETER: I’m excited to see what kind of lyrics he writes after stepping back into that. To see what kind of artistic stuff we can mine from Mike’s experiences this year. I think that will be fun to see what happens."
