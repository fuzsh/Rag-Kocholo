Hall has tied the knot again.\n\nThe “Dexter” star was spotted at City Hall on Monday morning, where witnesses said he was getting married to Morgan Macgregor, a book critic working in Los Angeles.\n\nHall and Macgregor have dated since 2012, first appearing together publicly at the Emmy Awards that year.\n\nHall, who has reportedly listed his LA home for $4.85 million, has been married twice before. He split from his then-wife and “Dexter” co-star Jennifer Carpenter in 2011, and was previously wed to Amy Spanger.\n\nHall will next appear in “Christine,” about the late anchorwoman Christine Chubbuck, with Rebecca Hall. The flick played at this year’s Sundance Film Festival."
