He played the title character, serial killer and blood spatter analyst Dexter Morgan, in the Showtime series DEXTER. In 2021-2022, Hall reprised his role as Dexter in Dexter: New Blood, a ten-episode special event series..\n\nAppearances[]\n\nDexter (show) 2006 -2013\n\nAll 96 Episodes of Eight Seasons\n\nDexter: New Blood - Season One (2021 - 2022)\n\n“Cold Snap” (2021)\n\n“Storm of Fuck” (2021)\n\n“Smoke Signals” (2021)\n\n“H Is for Hero” (2021)\n\n“Runaway” (2021)\n\n“Too Many Tuna Sandwiches” (2021)\n\n\"“Skin of Her Teeth” (2021)\n\n“Unfair Game (2021)\n\n“The Family Business” (2022)\n\n“Sins of the Father” (2022)\n\nDirector[]\n\nSeason Eight:\n\n\"Every Silver Lining...\"\n\nProducer[]\n\nSeason Three\n\nHall was made co-executive producer of DEXTER.\n\nAwards[]\n\nDexter: For his work on Dexter, Hall was nominated for five Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The show itself was also nominated for Emmy citations in the Drama Series category in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.

In addition, he shared in the Screen Actors Guild nomination for best ensemble cast all five years that the show was in production, winning the award in 2003 and 2004.\n\nQuote[]\n\nIn a 2006 interview, Hall discussed his approach to the character of Dexter Morgan, saying:\n\n\"I think Dexter is a man who... a part of himself is very much frozen, or arrested in a place that is pre-memory, pre-conscious, pre-verbal. Something very traumatic happened to him, he doesn’t know what that is. And I think on some level he wants to know. He denies his humanity, he describes himself as someone who is without feeling, and yet I think that he maybe suspects -- in a way that maybe isn’t even conscious yet when we first meet him -- that he is in fact a human being. Dexter's a unique killer in that his father saw his dark impulses, shined a light on them, and told Dexter that he saw them, he accepted them, that Dexter is good and that he is worthy of love. And I think that's what enables him to focus his energies in this unique way.\" [1]\n\nCareer[]\n\nTheatre\n\nHall's acting career began in the theater.

When he was 11, his father died of cancer, and in a 2004 interview he recalled, \"Certainly, for a young boy, there's no good age, but I think I was on the cusp of a time in my life where I was starting to reach puberty, to relate to my father. To have him... Something gets frozen. As you revisit it for the rest of your life, it's sort of this slow but hopefully sure crawling-out of that frozen moment.\" [2]\n\nHall graduated from Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, in 1993. He later attended New York University's Master of Fine Arts program in New York City.\n\nMarriages\n\nIn 2002, he married actress Amy Spanger; he played Billy Flynn opposite her Roxie Hart in the Broadway musical Chicago the summer after their wedding. The couple separated and divorced in 2006.\n\nOn 31 December 2008, he married Jennifer Carpenter, who played the character of Dexter Morgan's foster sister, Debra Morgan. They dated for a year and a half before eloping on New Year's Eve in 2008. And then in the summer of 2010, Jennifer petitioned for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. The marriage was officially over that December.\n\nIn September 2012, Hall began dating Morgan Macgregor who was an associate editor at the Los Angeles Review of Books, and they married on 29 February 2016. They live in the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City.\n\nSexuality\n\nIn a 2018 interview with the Daily Beast, Hall stated, \"I think there's a spectrum. I am on it. I'm heterosexual, but if there was a percentage, I would say I was not all the way heterosexual.\" Despite this, Hall says he's never been attracted to another man. However, he stated he sometimes desires emotional connections with other men that he feels would be considered gay.\n\nCancer\n\nOn 13 January 2010, his agent and spokesman confirmed that Hall was undergoing treatment for a treatable form of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Hall received his diagnosis while Season Four was still being shot, and he kept it a secret until shooting wrapped, beginning his treatment the next day. Many cast mates and friends made their concerns known to the media, some admitting they had no idea Hall was battling cancer because he never showed any signs of the disease. Hall expressed anxiety, mostly because he had avoided doctors since a childhood hernia operation. Hall accepted his Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award in 2010 while wearing a knitted cap over his bald head, having lost his hair to chemotherapy. On 25 April 2010, his wife, Jennifer Carpenter, announced that Hall was fully cured and was set to get back to work for a new season of Dexter. During Season Five of Dexter, Hall wore a human hair wig due to his loss of hair. The cancer is currently in remission.\n\nCharity[]\n\nHall is the face of the Somalia Aid Society's Feed The People campaign. He has also worked with Kiehl's to promote a limited-edition skin care line that benefits the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental nonprofit that works toward clean and safe water worldwide. In 2011, Hall was the celebrity spokesperson for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's \"Light the Night Walk\" fundraising campaign.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nTo get in shape for his role as Dexter, Michael C Hall hired celebrity trainer Gregory Joujon-Roche. who charged $5,000 per week and came with a support team. Hall had access to a fitness trainer, masseuse, nutritionist, martial arts instructor, yoga instructor, and core trainer. His workouts included running, weightlifting, abs exercise, and practicing hand-to-hand combat.\n\nHe is a vegan.\n\nMichael C. Hall (Dexter Morgan) has described the wig he wears in flashback scenes as \"Surfer/Prince Valiant\".\n\nGallery[]"
