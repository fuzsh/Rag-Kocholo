We take a look at how that’s going.\n\nWhen you realize that help is not on the way, what do you do next?\n\nTurkeys, chickens, geese, ducks, fowl of all kinds—real and imagined—and their mysterious hold over us.\n\nThings our dads taught us, whether they intended to or not.\n\nWhat happens when you realize the people in charge don’t have the answers.\n\nWhy does it often take an outsider to see things about you that are obvious?\n\nPeople who have a good, long time to think about what they’re doing, look hard at what’s ahead of them, and decide to keep moving forward anyway.\n\nSpots we’re avoiding in our private maps of the world.\n\nFriends and ex-friends finally talk about the one thing between them they've been avoiding.\n\nOne call to a very unusual hotline, and everything that followed.\n\nPeople who—whether they want to or not—find themselves face-to-face with the rest of their stories.\n\nNadia's family is split between Russia and Ukraine, and when Russia invaded Ukraine, it sparked family conflict, too.\n\nPeople on the verge of a big change, not wanting to let go. And the people who give them the final push.\n\nRon DeSantis says he'll do for America what he's done for Florida. So what's it like in Florida?\n\nPatients at a fertility clinic experience excruciating, unexpected pain. For months the reason for that pain remains hidden. Then they get a letter from the clinic.\n\nHumans encounter non-human intelligences of various kinds and try to make sense of them.\n\nIra's own father, Barry Glass, co-hosts this special Father's Day show.\n\nThe one animal we can’t seem to live without, even when we really, really want to.\n\nFive years after the #MeToo explosion, what’s happened in the lives of the women who went public with their stories?\n\nLooping thoughts about people you barely know, or don't know at all.\n\nPeople trying to leave some moment in their life behind, which can be hard.\n\nIt's funny the things that go through your head during a disaster.\n\nSummoning up stuff that’s usually hidden down deep.\n\nWe talk to people who wanted abortions right when the laws were changing in their states.\n\nPeople ​so close to each other, ​in ​extremely intimate situations​,​ who are also a million miles apart.\n\nThe ghosts that visit us, the ghosts that never do, and the ghosts that walk among us.\n\nPeople staring down that hardest of questions: Is now the time? To leave?\n\nWhen it comes to finding love, there seems to be two schools of thought on the best way to go about it.\n\nSometimes you raise your hand. Other times you’re just the only one left."
