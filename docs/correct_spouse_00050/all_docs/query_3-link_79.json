        "text": "Dexter's latest victim? His marriage. According to Entertainment Weekly, the show's stars, Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter, have filed for divorce.\n\nThe on-screen siblings and off-screen couple announced their divorce after nearly two years of marriage, having eloped on New Year's Eve, 2008 (they dated for a year and a half before marrying). The couple's representatives issued a joint statement to EW saying, \"Having been separated for some time, Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall have filed for divorce.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least there was no bloodshed -- each star's rep said that the split was amicable.\n\nHall announced in January that he was receiving treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma; he claimed his Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama while wearing a knit cap over his then-bald head. Carpenter announced in April that Hall had fully recovered from the disease.\n\nThe couple met on the set of the Showtime drama, which features Hall as the titular Dexter, a blood spatter analyst that moonlights as a vengeful serial killer. Carpenter plays his adopted sister and detective in the same Miami homicide unit.\n\nThe fifth season of 'Dexter' wrapped on Sunday night; it has already been renewed for a sixth season. Hall has been nominated the past three years for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series."
