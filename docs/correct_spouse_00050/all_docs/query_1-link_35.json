        "text": "Michael C. Hall said he identifies as “not all the way heterosexual” in a candid new interview about his sexuality.\n\nThe Golden Globe–winning actor, who starred on the HBO series “Six Feet Under” as gay mortician David Fisher, has been drawn to playing LGBTQ characters throughout his career on stage and screen.\n\nSpeaking with The Daily Beast, Hall reflected on discovering his sexual fluidity in relation to some of his best-known roles, despite never having an “intimate” relationship with a man.\n\n“I think there’s a spectrum. I am on it. I’m heterosexual,” he explained. “But if there was a percentage, I would say I was not all the way heterosexual.”\n\nPlaying the gender nonconforming emcee in “Cabaret,” Hall said, allowed him to “fling a bunch of doors wide open” in terms of his own sexuality, as he locked lips his co-star Michael Stuhlbarg every night.\n\n“I think I have always leaned into any fluidity in terms of my sexuality,” he added.\n\nHall has wed three times. He married actress Amy Spanger, who starred opposite him in the Broadway musical “Chicago” in 2002. He famously tied the knot with his “Dexter” co-star Jennifer Carpenter in 2008, but they divorced two years later. In 2016 he married longtime girlfriend Morgan Macgregor, a book critic and writer.\n\nHall chalks up some of that fluidity to a “craving for an emotional intimacy with a man” due to a fraught relationship with his father, who died when the actor was 11 years old.\n\n“I don’t mean to suggest that an emotional relationship between a father and son is any way homoerotic,” he said. “I mean an emotional intimacy or connection that at least in the milieu I grew up in was considered fey. I had an appetite to have emotional connections with men beyond beer, sports, and fist pumping that were considered ‘gay.’”\n\nAnd while Hall doesn’t consider himself entirely heterosexual, he does note the sensitivity surrounding LGBTQ representation on screen and the recent public conversations about straight actors playing gay roles.\n\n“I was playing this aspirationally iconic gay role as a straight man,” he said of his role in “Six Feet Under. “I felt all the more charged to do it justice. I certainly understand anyone who takes issue with the phenomenon.”\n\nR41, we saw Michael C Hall, Darren Chris, and John Cameron Mitchell during its Broadway run. I would like to have seen Neil P Harris to compare. Hall was fantastic; strong and sexy. He has an impressive singing voice and a powerful presence that fills the stage. He also fills out a pair of tight shorts nicely. JC Mitchell, naturally, taught a master class on how to be Hedwig. For that performance, we had front row seats. We shook hands with him during the show and he engaged us in conversation during his monologues. It was awesome. Darren Chris was decent, but we felt like he kinda' phoned it in. His body was great, especially his legs, but his performance was a bit flat. We were supposed to see the studly Euan Morton one night in a touring company production, but the understudy - a very feminine, thin, wisp of a kid - played that show and gave a rather disappointing, high school drama dept. type of performance. I had hoped that Adam Lambert would play Hedwig on Broadway, who I think would have been amazing, but I read that he didn't want to deal with so much make-up every night (he has skin problems).\n\nCount me as another queen lucky enough to have seen Michael C Hall in the front row for both Hedwig and Lazarus. That man oozes sex. His Hedwig left me breathless, laughing and crying and cumming all at the same time (Mary!). HIs singing in Lazarus was a literal religious experience.\n\nHe was fantastic as the much older, pervy, jealous ex-lover/professor of Lucien Carr in that beat poet movie \"Kill Your Darlings.\" The one with Daniel Radcliff as Alan Ginsberg.\n\nI always hoped, being the artiste that he is, that he'd be more experimental in his personal life. (Daddy issues...that's a recipe for hot, hot sex and a lil' neediness thrown in the mix for good measure.) But keeps marrying women! Why with all the marriage? Sounds like he comes from a conservative family or something?"
