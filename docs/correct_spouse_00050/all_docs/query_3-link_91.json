I'm interested in this subject :)\n\nI think a big part of it is how the marriage ends, for mine we realized it wasn't a good idea to be married, we tried to make it work and before we destroyed each other or got much further into it we ended it.\n\n(no subject) - beatlesluv Expand\n\n(no subject) - guzzlemuzzle Expand\n\n(no subject) - beatlesluv Expand\n\n(no subject) - guzzlemuzzle Expand\n\n(no subject) - beatlesluv Expand\n\ndidnt he cheat on her with julia stiles\n\nshe's a bigger person than i could ever be t b q h\n\nNo, that was a rumour.\n\nRumor that probably isn't true.\n\nIt was a rumor without any proof.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\n(no subject) - hello_samm\n\nSeaon 4 is MINDBLOWING.\n\nseconded\n\nJust wait until you get to season four; it'll change your life.\n\nlike everyone else said, season 4 is so good! i suggest you avoid dexter posts because you never know when people will post spoilers!!\n\nHe's still hitting that.\n\nAnd need Conrad Murray post, Prosecution is fucking him hard in final statements.\n\nIf he gets anything but guilty, fuck this world.\n\nwhat channel is the trail on??\n\nDunno I've been watching it on TMZ, wont be bac on for about an hour yet though. Prosecution has finished except for closing statements but they absolutely destroyed every defense evidence.\n\nsometimes her face though.\n\nMost of the time her face though\n\nis perfect and unique.\n\nLOL my bf and I argue over this all the time. I think she is so stunning and he would never consider it.\n\nIt's awkwardly asymmetrical so she has really bad angles sometimes. /: Idk, I don't like her character much, but she seems like a nice enough person.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - ohifonly_x Expand\n\n(no subject) - roguewave3 Expand\n\n(no subject) - ilouboutin Expand\n\n(no subject) - spankmypirate Expand\n\n(no subject) - flyingpigs_live Expand\n\n(no subject) - ilouboutin Expand\n\n(no subject) - banabee Expand\n\n(no subject) - ky02121 Expand\n\n(no subject) - hotelmirana Expand\n\n(no subject) - spankmypirate Expand\n\n(no subject) - hotelmirana Expand\n\n(no subject) - nene718 Expand\n\nI feel like I'm the only person who thinks she's stunningly gorgeous\n\n(no subject) - scarletsherlock Expand\n\n(no subject) - foureyedgirl Expand\n\n(no subject) - hautexmaglia Expand\n\nI thought she was so fug when I started the show, but her looks have really grown on me just like the character has.

And her nose has like no definition.\n\ni love her, and Deb is my queen ♥\n\nthis post has a different vibe than the one below it\n\nI believe it and I need to catch up on this season of Dexter. I've only watched the first episode.\n\nthis season of dexter feels weird to me.\n\nI agree! It's not really sinking in in this weird way?\n\ni have the same feel, it's a bit repetitive too..idk tho i like Deb this season\n\n(no subject) - hello_samm\n\ni'm liking deb more this season\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\ni must quote >:(\n\ni completely believe it\n\ni feel like if you marry a co-star you should be prepared for the aftermath if it doesn't work out, you know? like you should go in kind of having a backup plan\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nit looks like her face is melting off tbh\n\nreally? i noticed that they have a ton together actually\n\nI finished watching seasons 1-5 recently and the only person I can talk with is my bf since we watched it together but I just wanted to know people's general opinions on Rita? I liked her but my bf hated her so there's not much discussion there lol\n\nI loved Rita and was kinda shattered after she was killed off, but I got over it pretty quickly. Most of the hate she got was pretty ridiculous though (and sexist)\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nThissssss. Just like Joyce Summers.\n\nI didn't really like her. My boyfriend's mom hated her because she raised four kids alone and was all \"HOW CAN SHE NOT HANDLE TWO OLDER KIDS AND A BABY?! WHY IS SHE SO DEPENDENT ON DEXTER?!\"\n\n(no subject) - dementedevoted Expand\n\nBoth my mum and I loved her. lol my mum wanted to send hate mail to the writers for killing her off (she wasn't serious haha), so she definitely adored Rita.\n\nidk, I can't understand how people can hate her; she was such a positive presence for Dex :(\n\nI don't really have a strong opinion on Rita. I didn't like her but I didn't hate her either. I am glad they killed her off though. I didn't like 'family man Dexter'.\n\n(no subject) - my_cat_is_grey Expand\n\nWelllll, on the one hand, I never really like hearing people on TV yell at others (except that's pretty much all Breaking Bad is and I love that so idk) and it's easy to get annoyed at Rita for it because, you know, you're rooting for Dexter since he's the main character, but on the other hand, she'd been in a seriously abusive relationship with a drug addict who beat her and raped her (and then came back into her life to fuck it up some more), she had two (then three) kids to think of, Dexter flaked about a LOT of things and would drop off the face of the earth so no shit she'd get upset, she thought he was a recovering drug addict (yeesh, bad memories for her or what?!), he hooked up with Lila after he and Rita hadn't been broken up that long and Lila ended up abducting and trying to murder Rita's kids, he kept a secret apartment from her, etc. If you think about it, it's actually pretty impressive that she didn't flip out on him more often... I was speechless at the end of season 4's finale :'(\n\ni loved her. i never understood the hate\n\ni liked her a lot. there were times she annoyed me but every single character on this show has. Rita was a lot tougher than she looked, and I actually felt bad that she loved Dexter so much, but he never really truly returned her emotions (because he was just \"pretending\")\n\nI actually started watching the show for Julie Benz, since I loved her as Darla on BTVS/Angel. I liked her character a lot initially, but in her last season they made her such a bitch, I just couldn't stand it. Honestly a friend of mine and I used to bitch about her after each episode. She was at home all day and yet couldn't seem to manage two older kids and a new baby after she managed the two eldest when they were babies with a psychopath abusive husband? On top of that, Dexter treated her so much better than her ex, but she had such an attitude with him.\n\nTHAT SAID...Dex was obviously not the best partner either, and she forgave him a lot of things.\n\nAnyway, hated her and then they killed her and I FELT SO BAD haha ... I was like oh god, she just had a baby and I judged her so bad and then it's dex's fault she died....arghhhh!!!\n\n/long story\n\nI only started watching the show last summer and so I knew she was gonna die before I saw anything, so that probably colored my opinion. I liked her--I loved how loyal she was to Dexter (when she thought he was addicted to drugs, her first response was to get him help, not just to dump him) but at the same time she didn't put up with his shit (she kicked him to the curb when she found out he slept with Lila, etc). And I thought she was a good mom. Even though I knew it was coming I still felt literally sick towards the end of the S4 finale. D: D:\n\ni didn't like her in season 4 but i feel like the writers did that on purpose so that when she died, then you were like \"omg!\"\n\nseeing her first date with dexter in season 5 was really sweet though\n\n(no subject) - ohifonly_x Expand\n\nI loved Rita and was seriously like \"........\" days after the Season 4 finale. I don't ever think a tv death has gotten me like that before. All the hate I see for Rita is always ridiculous. Because she shouldn't be angry with Dexter after he cheated, constantly lies and disappears without a word for hours at a time?\n\nI liked her a lot."
