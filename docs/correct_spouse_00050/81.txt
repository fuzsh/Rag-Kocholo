Michael C. Hall has married in secret. The 'Dexter' actor and long-term girlfriend Morgan Macgregor reportedly exchanged vows at New York City Hall yesterday (29.02.16) in a private ceremony. Though a spokesperson for the 45-year-old actor has confirmed the happy news, no further details have been made available. Michael and Morgan - a book reviewer and novelist - have been together almost four years and made their first public appearance together at the 2012 Emmy Awards. This is the third marriage for the actor, who was married to actress Amy Spanger from 2002 to 2007, and his 'Dexter' co-star Jennifer Carpenter, whom he divorced in 2011 after three years of marriage. Michael was most recently seen in stage production 'Lazarus', which featured songs written by the late David Bowie. And he recently revealed the iconic singer - who died of cancer in January - sent him a "very, very amazing gift and note" on opening night for the play, which was staged at The New York Theater Workshop. He added: "Out of respect for his intense privacy I'll just say that it was an artifact from his past that he had passed on to me. "And it will be a talisman to me for the rest of my life."
