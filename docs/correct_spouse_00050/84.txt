Michael C. Hall is once again a married man.

A rep for Hall confirmed to USA TODAY that the Dexter star and theater veteran married his longtime girlfriend, writer Morgan Macgregor, in a Leap Day ceremony Monday at New York's City Hall.

Hall, 45, was previous married to actresses Amy Spanger and Jennifer Carpenter, who played his sister on Dexter.

He recently finished a theatrical stint in the off-Broadway play Lazarus, based on David Bowie's final album, Blackstar.
