        "text": "Princess Beatrice – the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah ‘Fergie’ Ferguson, Duchess of York – likes to keep her fairytale romance with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi rather private.\n\nHowever, over the years, the couple have shared glimpses into their relationship with royal enthusiasts through various public engagements and the occasional Instagram post.\n\nRead on to find out everything you need to know about Princess Beatrice and husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi’s relationship, and to see their sweetest moments!\n\nHow long did Princess Beatrice date her husband?\n\nIt’s not known when or how Beatrice met Edoardo, although it’s rumoured they began dating in September 2018.\n\nThey made their public debut as a couple in March 2019, attending a fundraising event at London’s National Portrait Gallery together.\n\nIn September 2019, Beatrice and Edoardo got engaged and after the pandemic forced them to postpone their wedding from the originally planned date (May 29, 2020), the couple tied the knot on July 17, 2020.\n\nBecause it’s not known exactly when Beatrice and Edoardo started dating, we can’t put an exact time frame on how long they dated for before getting married. But we estimate it was roughly 16 to 22 months.\n\nIs Princess Beatrice still with her husband?\n\nYes! As of 2024, Beatrice and Edoardo are still happily married. The couple also share one child together, Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi, who was born on September 18, 2021.\n\nWhat does Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi do for a living?\n\nEdoardo is the founder and chief executive of Banda Property, a property development and interior design company. He is the son of British-Italian Olympic alpine skier Alex Mapelli-Mozzi and a descendant of the Italian nobility.\n\nWho is Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi’s ex wife?\n\nPrior to his relationship with Princess Beatrice, Edoardo was engaged to architect Dara Huang but they broke up in 2018 before getting married – meaning Edoardo doesn’t have an ‘ex-wife’.\n\nEdoardo and Dara do share one child though; Christopher Woolf, who was born in 2016."
