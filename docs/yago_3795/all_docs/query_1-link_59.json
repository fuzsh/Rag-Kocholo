        "text": "The British Royal Family is facing a delicate situation due to the health of several of its most prominent members and is having to draft in replacements to continue their busy schedule.\n\nKing Charles has been forced to reduce his public appearances after announcing the start of his treatment for prostate cancer. And his daughter-in-law, the Princess of Wales Kate Middleton, announced she is facing the same situation in March.\n\nHowever, not even ill health can interrupt the Royals' busy schedule, which is packed with activities to help disadvantaged people around the world.\n\nThis has meant that other members of the family, such as Prince William, have had to increase their presence at institutional events, while simultaneously accompanying his wife through her medical treatment.\n\nBut William is not the only one and other family members have had to step up their activities, with Camilla - the Queen Consort - even requesting a break after appearing at several official events.\n\nReports in the UK suggest that the King has appointed his niece, Princess Beatrice of York, to replace Kate, as the Princess of Wales has been away from official events since December.\n\nBeatrice is the daughter of Prince Andrew, who has been banned from the royal family following a series of sex scandals. The 35-year-old had a royal wedding when she got married to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2022, and the couple have one son.\n\nThe Royal Family health crisis explained\n\nKate Middleton officially announced in March that she is suffering from cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy, which is why she is staying away from public activities.\n\nIn the case of the monarch, Queen Camilla has been very happy to see her husband, King Charles, gradually recovering and carrying out his activities in the midst of his cancer treatment, something the King had hoped to do when he announced his treatment."
