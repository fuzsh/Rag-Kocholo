But in early May, Beatrice, 31, postponed the royal wedding amid the pandemic, a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly said at the time.\n\nBeatrice got engaged to Mozzi, CEO of architecture/design studio Banda Property, in September while on vacation in Italy.\n\nAfter their engagement announcement, the property tycoon, 37, posted photos on his Instagram account with a sweet caption: \"You will never be alone my love, my heart is your home. Hand in hand, today, tomorrow and forever.\"\n\nMozzi is father to a young son, Wolfie, from a previous relationship with American architect and designer Dara Huang.\n\nBeatrice's sister, Princess Eugenie, married to her long-time boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank, in October 2018. Their wedding was just five months after Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan wed.\n\nContributing: Anika Reed, USA TODAY\n\nMore: Prince Harry addresses institutional racism on what would have been Princess Diana's 59th birthday"
