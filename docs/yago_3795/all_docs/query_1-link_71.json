        "text": "When Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi first announced their engagement in September, they were on track to have a relatively modest wedding. Within weeks, the simmering controversy over her father, Prince Andrew, and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein became a full conflagration, and by the end of November, he stepped down from his public duties. The pair began to plan a much quieter affair than their family had seen in years, away from many of the usual trappings of a royal wedding. When they exchange vows on May 29, the ceremony will take place in the Chapel Royal, which can seat only 150 guests, and the couple will eschew a public carriage processional.\n\nOver the weekend, the Mail on Sunday noticed one way that the wedding will be very traditional: Edoardo belongs to the Italian royal House of Savoy, so the marriage will unite two of the continent’s oldest dynasties. The newspaper caught up with Edoardo’s father, Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi, a ski jumper, real estate executive, and descendant of the deposed Italian royal family. According to Alessandro, Beatrice will become a countess upon marriage and their children will be entitled to titles of nobility.\n\n“Edoardo is the only male descendent taking the family into the next generation,” Alessandro said. “He is a count—his wife will be a countess automatically and any of their children will be counts or nobile donna.” Edoardo will also inherit the family seat, Villa Mapelli Mozzi, a 19-bedroom neoclassical mansion in Casatenovo, Italy.\n\nBecause the Italian monarchy was dissolved in 1946, these are only courtesy titles, and not legally active in Britain. When new members marry into the family, Queen Elizabeth occasionally creates a new royal title for the couple to share. Since Beatrice’s sister Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank did not receive one when they wed in October 2018, it seems unlikely that the pair will get an active title come May. Ultimately, it might be a bit like Prince Philip, who isn’t a prince of the U.K., only a duke, though nobody really wants to push the issue.\n\nSo while the wedding will have some ancient significance to the monarchy, many of the couple’s other plans for the wedding are decidedly nontraditional. Edoardo already has a three-year-old son from a previous relationship, named Christopher Woolf Mapelli Mozzi but often called Wolfie. The Mail’s Richard Kay reported Saturday that Edoardo had already chosen his son as his best man. The decision was met with a bit of confusion at the palace. One courtier asked, “Surely, he won't be expected to make a speech at Buckingham Palace?”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— How a teenager uncovered Belgium’s royal scandal\n\n— Oscars 2020: All the best-dressed stars on the red carpet\n\n— The dangers of flying rich and flying private\n\n— What this year’s nominees wore to their first Oscars\n\n— Harry and Meghan are lying low—but not for long\n\n— Can Princess Beatrice’s wedding solve the royal family crisis?\n\n— From the Archive: The women of Palm Beach"
