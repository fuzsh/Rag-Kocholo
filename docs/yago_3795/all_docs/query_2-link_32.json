        "text": "Princess Beatrice is a married woman.\n\nPrince Andrew’s daughter tied the knot with Italian real estate developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi Friday morning in a private ceremony in Windsor — after the couple canceled their May nuptials amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe smaller scale wedding, which was not announced in advance, was held at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge and attended by the Queen and Prince Philip, as well as close family members, BBC News reported.\n\nThe ceremony took place in accordance with government guidelines in place for coronavirus.\n\nIt’s believed that Beatrice’s wedding is the first time Prince Andrew and the Queen and Prince have gotten together since the arrest of his longtime pal Ghislaine Maxwell earlier this month, The Telegraph reported.\n\n1 of 3\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Duke of York’s website was quietly scrubbed from the internet amid the sex abuse scandal.\n\nAndrew’s alleged ties to Maxwell and dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein caused him to skip his daughter’s star-studded engagement party in December.\n\nBeatrice, 31, and Mozzi, 37, the son of France-based Count Alessandro “Alex” Mapelli-Mozzi, got engaged during a trip to the Italian island of Capri last September."
