        "text": "Princess Beatrice, who is the oldest daughter of Prince Andrew and granddaughter to Queen Elizabeth, has known Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, English property developer, and his family for quite some time. Still, the two reportedly didn't start dating until about 2018, when they quickly took their relationship to the next level. Beatrice and Edoardo will be celebrating their first wedding anniversary this summer, and the couple recently made the exciting announcement that they're expecting a child together.\n\nAlthough Beatrice and Edoardo are extremely private and keep their relationship quiet, there are some things we know about the royal couple. Here's a look at their relationship, from when they first began dating to today.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi started dating in the fall of 2018 after knowing each other for a few years.\n\nThe two attended their first royal wedding together in the spring of 2019.\n\nThe couple got engaged in Italy in September 2019.\n\nThey wed in a private ceremony on July 17, 2020.\n\n2011: First Recorded Time Together\n\nIt's unclear exactly when Beatrice and Edoardo met, but according to People, their families have been close for a very long time. Edoardo is the stepson of Christoper Shale, who died at the Glastonbury rock festival in 2011. Shale was a close friend of Beatrice's parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, meaning the two must have known each other for years. Beatrice attended Shale's funeral in 2011 along with her parents.\n\nNovember 2018: Dating Rumors Begin\n\nIn November of 2018, The Daily Mail reported that Beatrice and Edoardo were dating after Beatrice supposedly introduced Edoardo as her boyfriend at an exclusive London party thrown by Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal. At that point, sources claimed that Beatrice and Edoardo were already talking about getting married in 2019.\n\nMarch 2019: First Public Appearance\n\nIt wasn't until the spring of 2019 that the couple made their first public appearance together, per Town and Country. They attended a gala held at the National Portrait Gallery in London, which fellow royal Kate Middleton also attended.\n\nLater that month, the new couple was photographed holding hands while strolling through New York City. According to People, they wore coordinating outfits in blue and grey, and Edoardo carried some shopping bags.\n\nApril 2019: Family Outing\n\nThe two showed that they were serious by publicly getting together with family. In early April, People reported that they attended VIP day at the Bahrain Grand Prix for the Formula One Championship race alongside Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew.\n\nLater in the month, Beatrice and Edoardo went to St. James' Palace to support an event for Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace campaign. It was one of Edoardo's first royal events, and the couple was photographed chatting with other guests throughout the night.\n\nThe night before the event, People also reported that Beatrice and Edoardo went out for a double date night with Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank.\n\nMay 2019: First Royal Wedding\n\nFor their first royal wedding together, Beatrice and Edoardo went to the wedding of Beatrice's second cousin once removed, Lady Gabriella Windsor. According to Town and Country, Beatrice wore a navy blue lace dress by Self Portrait and a white hat.\n\nSeptember 26, 2019: Italian Engagement\n\nAfter about a year of dating, Edoardo proposed to Beatrice while on vacation in Italy. In an official statement on Twitter, the Duke of York wrote, \"The Duke and Duchess of York are delighted to announce the engagement of Princess Beatrice to Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\"\n\nIn their own statement, Beatrice and Edoardo added, \"We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement. We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can’t wait to be married. We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.”\n\nEdoardo shared some sweet photos of the two on his Instagram account, with the caption, \"You will never be alone my love, my heart is your home. Hand in hand, today, tomorrow and forever.\"\n\nEdoardo worked with British jeweler Shaun Lane to create Beatrice's engagement ring, which features a round center cut diamond in a platinum setting with an Art Deco-inspired look.\n\nApril 2020: Change In Wedding Plans\n\nIn February 2020, a statement had confirmed that Beatrice and Edoardo would be getting married on May 29, 2020 at The Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace, followed by a private reception given by The Queen in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.\n\nBut just a month later, in March, an official statement announced that the two would be canceling that planned ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic. The statement read, \"Beatrice and Mr Mapelli Mozzi are very much looking forward to getting married but are equally aware of the need to avoid undertaking any unnecessary risks in the current circumstances.\"\n\nJuly 17, 2020: Private Wedding\n\nIn July, Beatrice and Edoardo surprised everyone when they got married in a small private ceremony at Windsor Castle. Beatrice wore an ivory hand-me-down dress from Queen Elizabeth II, made from peau de soie taffeta and trimmed with ivory duchesse satin, featuring organza sleeves, diamenté adornments, and a checkered bodice. She added the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara, which is the same one Queen Elizabeth wore at her wedding to Prince Philip in 1947.\n\nAfterward, about 14 of the guests, who were close friends of the couple, stayed to attend a party at a pop-up pub set up at the Royal Lodge. Later, Beatrice and Edoardo spent their wedding night in a glamping pod.\n\nEdoardo shared some photos from the wedding on his Instagram page with a caption featuring a romantic poem by E.E. Cummings, which began, \"I carry your heart with me (i carry it in my heart) i am never without it (anywhere i go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling) i fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) i want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true) and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you.\"\n\nMay 19, 2021: Pregnancy Announcement\n\nLess than a year after the wedding, a pregnancy announcement was made. The Royal Family released a statement that said, \"Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice and Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi are very pleased to announce that they are expecting a baby in autumn of this year. The Queen has been informed and both families are delighted with the news.\"\n\nThis will be the couple's first child together. Edoardo is already the father of a son named Christopher Wolfe, who he had with former fiancée Dara Huang in 2016."
