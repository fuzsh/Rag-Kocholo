        "text": "In December 2019, the soon to-be husband and wife threw a lavish engagement party at trendy London hotspot the Chiltern Firehouse. The event boasted an A-list guest list including names like Pippa Middleton, James Middleton, Ellie Goulding and James Blunt.\n\nHowever Princess Beatrice’s father Prince Andrew skipped the event as it was in the aftermath of his disastrous Newsnight interview.\n\nSadly in March, Bea and Edo announced they’d be postponing their wedding due to the risk of coronavirus.\n\n“Princess Beatrice and Mr Mapelli Mozzi are very much looking forward to getting married but are equally aware of the need to avoid undertaking any unnecessary risks in the current circumstances. In line with Government advice for the UK and beyond, the couple are reviewing their arrangements for 29th May. They are particularly conscious of Government advice in relation to both the wellbeing of older family members and large gatherings of people. Therefore, the planned reception in the Buckingham Palace Gardens will not take place,” a spokesperson said at the time.\n\nIn July, the couple surprised the world by tying the knot in secret!\n\nIn a romantic tribute, Edo posted this behind-the-scenes snap with his new wife accompanied with the couple’s favourite poem I Carry Your Heart by E. E. Cummings, which was read out at their wedding.\n\n“I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart) I am never without it (anywhere I go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling) I fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true) and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you here is the deepest secret nobody knows (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide) and this is the wonder that’s keeping the stars apart I carry your heart (I carry it in my heart).”\n\nEdoardo penned a special message to his wife for their first wedding anniversary in July, a few short months before they became parents. He wrote: “I can’t believe it has been 1 year. Every second of every day since has been so full of joy, happiness, laughter and love. You are the kindest, loveliest and most beautiful person in the world. Thank you my darling for every second. ❤️👰💍”\n\nOn September 18, 2021, Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi welcomed their first child together – a healthy baby girl.\n\nSharing the news on her Twitter account, Beatrice wrote: “So delighted to share the news of the safe arrival of our daughter on Saturday 18th September 2021, at 23.42, at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. Thank you to the Midwife team and everyone at the hospital for their wonderful care.”"
