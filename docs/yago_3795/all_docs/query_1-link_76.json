        "text": "Princess Beatrice has finally married Italian property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in secret at Windsor Castle.\n\nThe couple were due to tie the knot at the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace at the end of May but were forced to cancel the nuptials due to the Coronavirus pandemic. A reception was planned to take place in Beatrice’s grandmother Queen Elizabeth’s gardens at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAt the time of announcing the cancelation, the couple did not provide a new date for their ceremony, presumably to keep it as low-key an affair as possible.\n\nThe Daily Mail’s royal correspondent Rebecca English tweeted on Friday July 17 that the pair exchanged vows at All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park in an intimate ceremony, ‘with strict social distancing measures in place’.\n\n‘We spotted the Queen and Prince Philip being driven on the estate this morning. What a lovely day for a wedding!’ she added.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi's wedding day:\n\nThe ring\n\nPrincess Beatrice broke away from royal tradition and opted to have a wedding ring designed by British jeweller Shaun Leane.\n\nThe ring was made in a platinum and diamond design and fits perfectly with Beatrice’s engagement ring, also designed by Leane.\n\nThe design is a break with tradition as royal brides in recent years have chosen to have gold wedding bans. The Queen, Princess Diana, the Duchess of Cornwall, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and Princess Eugenie all have royal weddings bands made of pure Welsh gold from the Clogau mine.\n\n‘I am thrilled for the happy couple, it warms my heart to see two wonderful people unite in love as much as Edoardo and Beatrice do,’ the jeweller revealed in press statement.\n\n‘I feel very honoured to have been a part of their journey and to have been involved in the very special moments of designing and creating the engagement ring and wedding ring. I wish them a lifetime of love and happiness together.’\n\nThe dress\n\nBeatrice opted for a vintage, second-hand wedding dress for her big day, borrowed from her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAccording to a Buckingham Palace press release, the gown was originally designed by Norman Hartnell, who also designed the Queen’s wedding and coronation dress.\n\nRoyal dresser Angela Kelly and designer Stewart Parvin remodelled the dress to make it suitable for Beatrice’s wedding day.\n\nWhen the Queen first wore the dress to a state dinner in Rome in 1961, it had embellished shoulder straps. However, Kelly and Parvin updated the design with puffed organza sleeves.\n\nThe ivory-hued gown is made from Peau De Soie taffeta and trimmed with ivory Duchess satin. It features diamanté adornments and a checkered, geometric bodice.\n\nThe queen has worn the dress at least three times over the years, such as for the premiere of Lawrence of Arabia at the Odeon in Leicester Square, London, in 1962. For the occasion, she accessorised her look with the Queen Mary's Girls of Great Britain and Ireland tiara and elbow-length white evening gloves.\n\nShe wore the dress again at the State Opening of Parliament in 1966, in addition to the Imperial State Crown and the velvet ceremonial robe.\n\nBeatrice’s remodelled dress also looked similar to her mother’s Sarah Ferguson’s on her wedding day to Prince Andrew in 1986.\n\nBoth brides opted for ivory Duchess satin wedding dress with partial sleeves and accessorised their looks with veils.\n\nThe shoes\n\nSustainability appeared to be an important factor for the bride on her wedding day, if her accessories are anything to go by.\n\nIn addition to the Norman Hartwell gown she borrowed from the Queen, the bride also chose to rewear a pair of shoes she once wore to another royal wedding.\n\nOn her big day, Princess Beatrice was seen wearing a pair of sparkly champagne-hued Valentino pumps that she first wore to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011. The bride also wore them to Prince Amedeo's royal wedding in 2014.\n\nThe shoes featured diamanté embellishments and a front V-shape design.\n\nThe tiara\n\nPrincess Beatrice opted to wear a very important tiara owned by the Queen.\n\nThe bride chose to wear the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara for her wedding day which Her Majesty also wore to her wedding to Prince Philip in 1947.\n\nThe tiara was made specially for Queen Mary by Garrard and Co. The diamonds were used from a necklace that Queen Victoria had gifted Mary on her wedding day to George V, Victoria’s grandson, in 1893. The diamonds were originally owned by George III and his wife Queen Charlotte.\n\nAccording to the Queen, when she wore the tiara on her wedding day to Prince Philip, she suffered quite the fashion mishap.\n\nRecalling the moment the frame of the tiara broken on her wedding day to the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, the Queen said: ‘The catch, which I didn’t know existed, it suddenly went [gesturing with her hands].’\n\nFortunately, a crown jeweller was close by to repair the tiara immediately. ‘I think they taped up the spring,’ she added.\n\nThe photographer\n\nBuckingham Palace released two pictures taken by Oxfordshire-based photographer Benjamin Wheeler the day after the wedding.\n\nIn a statement, the couple said they were so 'touched by the warm wishes they have received since their wedding' they decided to share two more photographs from their 'happy day' on Sunday July 19.\n\n'I was so incredibly honoured to photograph their wedding day, a certain milestone of my career,' Wheeler stated on his Instagram account.\n\nThe guests\n\nIn accordance with government guideline during the pandemic, the couple enjoyed a small wedding.\n\nGuests on the day included Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, the couple’s parents and siblings, including Princess Eugenie, and Mapelli Mozzi three-year-old son, Wolfie, who was best man and pageboy.\n\n'The bride was walked down the aisle by her father,' the palace confirmed.\n\nSarah, Duchess of York, and the groom’s mother, Nikki Williams-Ellis, read 'two of the couple’s favourite poems' – I carry you in my heart by E. E. Cummings and Sonnet 116 by William Shakespeare.\n\nThe royal family's extended relatives such as Kate Middleton, Prince William, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were not in attendance.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge shared a sweet message on Kensington Palace's Instagram Stories to congratulate Beatrice and Edoardo on their wedding.\n\nSharing one of the official wedding pictures along with a ‘Just Married’ banner the post’s message read: ‘Congratulations to HRH Princess Beatrice and Mr Edorado Mapelli Mozzi who were married in a small private ceremony at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor on Friday!’\n\nThe couple announced their engagement in September last year after less than a year of dating. Mapelli Mozzi is father to a two-year-old son from a previous relationship.\n\nAfter news of their engagement hit the headlines, Beatrice’s sister, Princess Eugenie, wrote on Instagram: ‘I'm so happy for you my dearest big sissy and dear Edo. It's been a long time coming and you two are meant to be.’\n\nIn November, Beatrice’s father, Prince Andrew, stepped back from his royal duties following increasing reports in the media focusing on his affiliations to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe reception\n\nThe couple’s wedding reception took place in the grounds of Royal Lodge where the bride’s parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, reside.\n\nThe ceremony was believed to have been attended by approximately 20 people but the reception's guest list featured ‘closer to around 30 people’, according to People.\n\nThe publication reports the reception had a floral design, similar to the wedding, and the coupe played music from an iPhone as live music is currently banned due to Covid-19.\n\nThe honeymoon\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi are enjoying a mini break in France following their wedding, reports People.\n\nAccording to the publication, the couple are planning a second honeymoon in the next few weeks but, given the unpredictability of travel during Covid-19, it’s likely the couple are being cautious over where they decide to celebrate their newlywed status.\n\nHELLO! reports the couple plan to visit Lamu Island, near Kenya, where Edoardo's family owns a home.\n\nLike this article?
