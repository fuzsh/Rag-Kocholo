        "text": "Post by Admin on\n\nPrincess Beatrice, who is eighth in line to the throne, is said to be dating multi-millionaire property devloper Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 34, after meeting through a mutual friend.\n\nAnd things have been going so well for Mr Mozzi and the 30-year-old royal that a friend suggested the pair could even tie the knot next year. Beatrice has already introduced Mr Mozzi, a divorcee with a two-year-old son, to her parents Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew, according to the friend.\n\nThe pair has already enjoyed a string of dates and Beatrice reportedly introduced her new boyfriend to her friends last week a party thrown by Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal Diwali in London.\n\nA friend told The Sun on Sunday: “Beatrice and Edo have the same circle of friends and were introduced through a mutual chum.\n\n“They’ve been on holiday together and Beatrice introduced him to Fergie and her dad.\n\n“Things are moving very quickly and it wouldn’t surprise anyone if they got engaged within a short period of time.\n\n“They could even be tying the knot in 2019 — it’s already been discussed by her friends.”\n\nPost by Admin on\n\nEdo and his family are old friends of Beatrice’s parents, the Duke and Duchess of York. The 34-year-old is the stepson of Christopher Shale, who was closely associated with former Prime Minister David Cameron before his death in 2011.\n\nMr Cameron was friends with Beatrice’s parents, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew and for this reason, it’s certain the two lovebirds have crossed paths many times. Royal author Robert Jobson revealed to Express.co.uk an engagement could be close.\n\nSpeaking of an engagement in the near future he said: “I’m sure it’s on the cards. “They have known each other a very long time. They are very close.” Another source told The Sun: “Things are moving very quickly and it wouldn’t surprise anyone if they got engaged within a short period of time. “They could even be tying the knot in 2019 — it’s already been discussed by her friends.”\n\nPost by Admin on\n\nYou might think that Princess Beatrice of York has nothing better to do than shop for fabulous hats all day and go on dates with her multi-millionaire property developer boyfriend, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, every night, but believe it or not, the 30-year-old actually is more than just a socialite. Yes, Beatrice may attend garden parties and the annual Trooping the Color (and she may regularly go on vacations with her celebrity pals, like Karlie Kloss and Ellie Goulding), but unlike her cousins Prince William and Prince Harry, Beatrice and her younger sister Eugenie aren't 'working royals,' which means their calendars aren't filled with obligatory engagements from the queen.\n\nUnfortunately for them, this also means they're not supported by the Sovereign Grant, also known as the revenue from the Crown Estate, which includes the royal palaces and other properties. This tax-funded salary is given annually to fund the queen and other royals in their official duties, including the girls' father, Prince Andrew. However, we think the sisters are doing okay money-wise. It is made clear on Prince Andrew's website that he helps his daughters out with rent, stating that he \"supports both of his daughters financially from his private income.\"\n\nThe sisters also have enormous trust funds to help support them (according to The Telegraph, £1.4 million of their mom Sarah Ferguson's £3 million divorce settlement was set up a trust for the princesses, not to mention the money they'll eventually come into from the queen). But even if she doesn't necessarily need the money, what does Beatrice do all day if she's not shaking hands and attending events?"
