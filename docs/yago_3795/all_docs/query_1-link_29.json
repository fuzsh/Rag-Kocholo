Have an account? .\n\nPrincess Beatrice is one of Queen Elizabeth II's eight grandchildren.\n\nShe \"works full time in business,\" according to the royal family.\n\nShe married businessman Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2020. They welcomed their first child on Saturday, September 18.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrincess Beatrice is the daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York.\n\nShe's Queen Elizabeth's fifth grandchild.\n\nThat makes her 10th in line to the throne.\n\nShe's the third woman in the line of succession. Princess Charlotte is the first, followed by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's daughter, Lilibet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeatrice can usually be spotted along with other members of the royal family at ceremonial events like Trooping the Colour.\n\nPrincess Beatrice is pictured attending Trooping the Colour, a celebration of the Queen's birthday, in 2018.\n\nShe is the older sister of Princess Eugenie. They're cousins with Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nBeatrice is 19 months older than her sister, Eugenie. They're pictured with their cousins in Klosters, Switzerland, in January 1995.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was Head Girl at St. George's School in Ascot.\n\nPrincess Beatrice posed on her first day of school at St. George's in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter studying history, she graduated from the University of London in 2011.\n\nShe studied history and the history of ideas at Goldsmiths College, achieving a 2:1, before starting internships, according to the BBC.\n\nHer first job was \"a research analyst at a boutique private wealth firm,\" according to her current employer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer bio on the royal family's official website says that she now \"works full time in business.\"\n\nShe's been described as a \"business matchmaker\" connecting startups with potential investors in her work with Afiniti, an American software company, where she is vice president of partnerships and strategy.\n\nThe company's website says she \"is responsible for the management of the strategic Afiniti partnerships as well as company growth through unique initiatives and client development.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast speculated in 2017 that she was working more as a brand ambassador since the company had declined to further explain her involvement. The Duke of York's office has simply said that she's \"continuing to work in business.\"\n\nShe's also patron of a number of charities focused on improving the lives of young people.\n\nShe supports Children in Crisis and Teenage Cancer Trust, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also meets renowned changemakers through her charity programs.\n\nPrincess Beatrice met Malala Yousafzai and her father, Ziauddin, during a reception for Youth, Education and the Commonwealth at Buckingham Palace in 2013.\n\nOK! magazine previously reported that Beatrice and her sister were worth an estimated $4.6 million.\n\nThat fortune, which the magazine estimated in 2018, reportedly comes from royal trust funds as well as from accounts set up after Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson divorced in 1996.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrincess Beatrice is friends with Karlie Kloss and other celebrities, and she has accompanied them on glamorous vacations.\n\nOn a 2018 vacation in Jordan's Wadi Rum Desert, Princess Beatrice was joined by Victoria's Secret supermodel Karlie Kloss, singer Ellie Goulding, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, and Joshua Kushner — Jared Kushner 's brother and Kloss' husband.\n\nShe even attended Kloss and Kushner's second wedding in Wyoming in June 2019, according to Kloss' Instagram.\n\nShe combines her fashion sense with her charity work on occasion.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and her mother Sarah Ferguson walked down the catwalk at the Fashion Relief Show during London Fashion Week in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe attended the 2018 Met Gala in a regal purple dress with embellished neck and shoulder pieces.\n\nThe theme of the gala was \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.\"\n\nHer Philip Treacy fascinator at Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding was another memorable style moment.\n\nThe hat was later auctioned off for charity for $109,435, according to Marie Claire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut she's worn eye-catching fascinators at many royal engagements.\n\nThey match her outfits perfectly.\n\nSome are more ornate than others.\n\nShe wore an elaborate butterfly fascinator to the wedding of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's the first member of the royal family to ever complete the London Marathon.\n\nPrincess Beatrice ran the London Marathon in 2010 as part of a 34-person human caterpillar to raise money for charity.\n\nShe may or may not have a secret Instagram.\n\nPrincess Beatrice was tagged in a group photo that included Karlie Kloss at a birthday party in LA as @beayork. It's a private account, so there's no way to know for sure if it's hers. Her sister, Princess Eugenie, has a public Instagram account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe had been living in St James's Palace with her sister Eugenie, but reportedly moved out when Eugenie got married.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, Princess Beatrice and Eugenie lived together in St James's Palace in central London for 10 years. But apparently only full-time royals get to live on palace grounds for free. Their father, Prince Andrew, had reportedly been paying upwards of $26,000 per year in rent. Since Eugenie's wedding in 2018, Beatrice splits her time between London and New York City.\n\nSt James's Palace is one of many properties owned by the royal family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe broke up with Uber executive Dave Clark after nearly 10 years and began dating businessman Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2018.\n\nBeatrice and Clark dated for almost 10 years after Prince William introduced them at a birthday party, according to People. They split in 2016, and Clark got engaged to Lynn Anderson less than a year later, tying the knot in 2017.\n\nPrincess Beatrice began dating Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in September 2018 after Mozzi split from Dara Huang, his fiancée and the mother of his child. Mozzi has some royal lineage himself — his father is an Italian count.\n\nThe couple made their first public appearance in March 2019 and attended other events like the royal wedding of Ella Windsor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrincess Beatrice got engaged to Mozzi in 2019 with a ring he designed worth an estimated $100,000.\n\nMozzi designed the 3.5-carat ring with tapered baguettes in collaboration with designer Shaun Leane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple tied the knot in a private ceremony at Windsor Castle on July 17, 2020.\n\nTheir original wedding plans involved a ceremony at Chapel Royal in St James's Palace and a wedding reception at Buckingham Palace in May, but they had to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInstead of a lavish royal wedding, they held a secret ceremony in The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge in Windsor Castle attended by Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, and close family members.\n\nBeatrice borrowed a gown from the Queen that Norman Hartnell designed in the 1960s, and reworked it by adding triple organza sleeves and embroidered vintage diamantés.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nRoyal Family\n\nAdvertisement"
