        "text": "Princess Beatrice married millionaire property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi on Friday at a ceremony in All Saints Chapel in Windsor.\n\nOnly the couple’s parents and siblings, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and Edoardo’s three-year-old son were present for the service, in line with UK coronavirus restrictions.\n\nBut despite widespread celebrations, many have have been left wondering who is the British-Italian aristocrat, now the royal family’s newest member?\n\nAdding to this intrigue is the couple got engaged after having dated for less than a year, after linking up soon after the 35-year-old ended things with his former fiancee, Dara Huang.\n\nThe pair were engaged for three-and-a-half years and shared a two-year-old son Christopher ‘Wolfie’ Woolf, who lives between their London homes.\n\nBeatrice’s well-connected husband\n\nEdo, as he’s known to pals, has known the princess and her parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson since childhood—largely through his family’s movements in high society circles.\n\nHe is the CEO of real estate firm Banda which he founded in 2007.\n\nThe mini mogul was born to Alex Mapelli-Mozzi, an Italian count, who competed in the 1972 Winter Olympics as an alpine skier and his ex-wife Nikki Williams-Ellis.\n\nThey each paid tribute to the spouses-to-be’s longstanding friendship after their engagement news broke, saying they were ‘truly delighted’ by the news.\n\n“Our family has known Beatrice for most of her life. Edo and Beatrice are made for each other, and their happiness and love for each other is there for all to see,” they said.\n\n“[The couple] share an incredibly strong and united bond, their marriage will only strengthen what is already a wonderful relationship.”\n\nRoyal’s whirlwind romance\n\nAlthough it’s unclear when exactly Beatrice and Edo met, she was pictured attending his step-father Christopher Shale’s funeral in 2011 alongside her mother and sister, Princess Eugenie.\n\nMr Shale had collapsed and died at Glastonbury Festival, 18 hours before he was found in a cubicle in the VIP area.\n\nYears later, Edo would name his and Dara’s son after his beloved step-father—with the youngster born less than two years before his parents’ split.\n\nBut despite no longer being together, the duo’s relationship is said to be amicable with Edo telling The Telegraph last year how they co-parent the tot.\n\n“I take [Christopher] to school a couple of mornings a week and finish in time to put him in bed three or four evenings,” he said.\n\nBeatrice and Edo were first pictured together for the first time after Eugenie’s October 2018 wedding, but made their public debut as a couple at a National Portrait Gallery gala in March 2019.\n\nIt’s unclear how long they’d been dating, but reports of the couple first surfaced in October 2018. They had reportedly lived together at St. James’ Palace for some time.\n\nBeatrice is ninth in line to the throne, the Queen’s sixth youngest grandchild and Andrew and Fergie’s oldest child. Beatrice’s younger sister, Eugenie, 29, wed her partner Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle in October 2018."
