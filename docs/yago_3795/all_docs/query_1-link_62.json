        "text": "Even if you're not familiar with Princess Beatrice, you might've already seen her around, perhaps mingling with your favorite royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony (or wearing those hats with Princess Eugenie at the 2011 royal wedding). Royal fans can likely expect to see her and Eugenie make an appearance at the upcoming May 6 coronation of King Charles II and Queen Camilla.\n\nAhead, everything you need to know about the princess.\n\nShe's the older daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York.\n\nBeatrice, 34, is the firstborn of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and Duchess Sarah (also known as Sarah Ferguson or \"Fergie\"). She's the older sibling of Princess Eugenie, 33, who married Jack Brooksbank in a royal wedding at Windsor Castle in October 2018.\n\nShe's also the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, making her first cousins with Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nA young Beatrice, William, and Harry gather in Windsor for Prince Edward’s wedding in 1999.\n\nShe's ninth in line for the throne.\n\nBeatrice follows her father, Prince Andrew, in the line of succession for the British crown, though neither of them are expected to reign.\n\nAt the time of writing, the order of succession stands as: Prince William, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Prince Harry, Prince Archie, Princess Lilibet, Prince Andrew, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, and so on.\n\nPrincess Beatrice (back row, second from the left) joins other royals including the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for Trooping the Colour 2018.\n\nHer full title is Her Royal Highness, Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary of York.\n\nIt's a mouthful, but her sister calls her \"Bea\" or \"Beabea\" for short.\n\nShe has a full-time job.\n\nBeatrice and Eugenie aren't \"working royals\" like their cousin William and his wife, Princess Kate, who regularly attend scheduled public engagements on behalf of the sovereign. Instead, they've built careers of their own. Beatrice \"works full time in business,\" according to the Duke of York's website.\n\nShe's the Vice President of Partnerships and Strategy at Afiniti, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to better connect customers with customer service agents, according to TechCrunch. Per the company's website, Beatrice is in charge of \"the management of the strategic Afiniti partnerships as well as company growth through unique initiatives and client development.\"\n\nBeatrice speaks at Women4Tech panel in February 2019.\n\nBeatrice \"began her career as a research analyst at a boutique private wealth firm,\" her company bio says. She went on to work as a business development associate at Sony pictures television, then an associate at Sandbridge Capital, a small private equity firm.\n\nThe princess is also a global ambassador of Street Child, a charity founded by her mom that supports women's and children's education in vulnerable countries; she co-founded The Big Change Charitable Trust with a group of friends to support projects helping young people; and she's a patron for a number of organizations and charities like the Teenage Cancer Trust, the Oscar’s Book Prize, Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre, Northwood African Education Foundation, and more.\n\nShe went to college in London.\n\nThe princess started at Upton House School in Berkshire, followed by Coworth Park School, then St. George’s School in Ascot from 2000, also according to her father's website. In 2011, she graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London, where she studied History and History of Ideas.\n\nBeatrice outside Goldsmiths College in September 2008.\n\nHer famous friends include Karlie Kloss and Ellie Goulding.\n\nThe trio even went on vacation together, along with designer Misha Nonoo (one of Meghan Markle's friends), at Wadi Rum desert in Jordan in April 2018.\n\nKloss and the princess have been friends for years. They attended a wedding together in Antibes, France in 2016, which Kloss then shared on her Instagram. They're so close that the model told Beatrice about her engagement to Joshua Kushner last year over FaceTime, to which the royal reacted with pure surprise. Kloss shared a screenshot of that conversation to her Instagram Story in July 2018 and tagged Beatrice, accidentally revealing to the world that the royal has a secret account on the app. In June, Beatrice, Goulding, and other A-listers attended Kloss and Kushner's second wedding in Wyoming.\n\nAlthough Goulding is known to be close with Eugenie (who reportedly set up the singer and her now-husband), she's friends with Beatrice, too. The princess and her now-husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, attended Goulding's wedding to Caspar Jopling in August."
