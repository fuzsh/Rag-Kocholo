After they divorced in 1996, Sarah became a prolific author, television personality, entrepreneur, and public figure.\n\nEarly life and wedding to Prince Andrew\n\nA descendant of British royalty, Ferguson was the second daughter of parents who divorced when she was an adolescent. Her father, Ronald, was a military veteran and worked for some years as the polo manager for Prince Charles (later Charles III). Her mother, Susan, went on to marry professional Argentine polo player Hector Barrantes in 1975 and settled in Argentina. Although Ferguson was a commoner, her family was wealthy, and she grew up as part of the upper class and connected to royal circles.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nPrince William and Catherine Middleton: The Royal Wedding of 2011: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson\n\nAfter attending a boarding school where she excelled in sports and underperformed in academics, Ferguson enrolled in a secretarial school. She then worked a series of jobs in public relations as well as at an art gallery and a graphic design firm. In 1981 Ferguson was invited to the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer (later Diana, Princess of Wales), whom she had known growing up. Over the ensuing years she and Diana reconnected. In 1985 Diana’s invitation to the Royal Ascot, the annual horse race attended by the ruling monarch, led Ferguson to become acquainted with Prince Andrew, a Royal Navy officer and the eldest of Charles’s two younger brothers. Ferguson was engaged to Andrew within months, and on July 23, 1986, they were married in Westminster Abbey, London. Upon their wedding, they were given the titles Duke and Duchess of York.\n\nMarriage\n\nThroughout her marriage, Sarah, Duchess of York, was the subject of intense scrutiny by the British press. Early on, many in the British public found her to be “a breath of fresh air,” with her open manner and modern lifestyle. She was, however, soon compared unfavourably to her sister-in-law. The media depicted them as opposites: Diana being quiet, elegant, and thin while Sarah was spunky, dowdy, and overweight.\n\nThe couple had two daughters: Princess Beatrice, born August 8, 1988, and Princess Eugenie, born March 23, 1990, before they separated in 1992. Ferguson attributed the split to the pressure of the tabloids and the difficulties of being a member of the royal household. The divorce was finalized in 1996, though the former husband and wife remained friendly. Sarah also retained her title.\n\nTelevision and charities\n\nAt the time of the divorce, Sarah was known to be in debt, and she spent several years working in American media to pay off her expenses. She was employed as a correspondent for NBC’s Today morning program and, perhaps most famously, as a spokesperson for Weight Watchers, for which she also published several books. In addition, she continued working for the charities she had supported during her marriage and founded a number of new ones, notably Children in Crisis (1993).\n\nPublications\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nEven before the end of her marriage, Sarah had begun publishing books, including a children’s story about a freckled helicopter named Budgie (1989), which soon became a series. By the 2020s she had dozens of volumes to her name, spanning genres including middle-grade fiction, historical fiction, nonfiction, and others. Additional children’s books include the Little Red series, about a red-haired little girl, and the Helping Hand series, which addresses difficult situations children may encounter, such as bullying or the separation of parents. She also wrote The Royal Switch and Bright Lights (both 1996) for young adults, a two-book series about an English princess and an American who look alike; a nonfiction series about Queen Victoria; and historical fiction for adults, including Her Heart for a Compass (2021) and A Most Intriguing Lady (2023). Her published memoirs include My Story (1996) and Finding Sarah: A Duchess’s Journey to Find Herself (2011), the latter of which was a companion to a six-part television show of the same name, which aired on Oprah Winfrey’s network.\n\nRelationship with ex-husband\n\nWhen she was in the United Kingdom, Sarah lived with her ex-husband and their daughters, and the arrangement continued into the 2020s. She often proclaimed that she and Andrew are the “happiest divorced couple in the world.” She maintained that Andrew was “a good, kind man,” even as he attracted controversy for his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier who became a convicted sex offender in 2008 and was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges when he committed suicide in 2019. A woman named Virginia Giuffre claimed that in 2001, while underage, she was forced by Epstein to have sex with the prince. Andrew denied the allegations, but he soon announced that he was stepping back from his public duties and gave up his military titles and royal patronages.\n\nControversies\n\nSarah’s life was often punctuated with controversies. Among the earliest, but perhaps the most notorious, were photos that appeared on the cover of tabloids in 1992, soon after she announced her separation from Andrew. One photo showed her sunbathing topless, with her toes in the mouth of Texas millionaire John Bryan. In 2010 she became the subject of another scandal when she was caught openly selling access to Andrew. Ferguson denied that the prince knew anything about the situation and apologized. About that time, her American lifestyle company, Hartmoor, folded, and she was sued for failure to repay debts to a firm of London solicitors. It was also rumoured she would be the first royal to declare bankruptcy. The royal family took steps to distance itself from Ferguson and her scandals, and in 2011 the media noted that she had been snubbed from the wedding of Prince William (later William, Prince of Wales to Catherine Middleton (later Catherine, Princess of Wales).\n\nLater life\n\nBy 2015, however, Ferguson’s tense relationship with the royal family had been eased, and she appeared publicly with Elizabeth II, her former mother-in-law, at the Royal Ascot. She was also invited to the wedding of Prince Harry (later Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex) to Meghan Markle (later Meghan, Duchess of Sussex) in 2018 and adopted two of Elizabeth’s corgis after the queen’s death in 2022. Sarah has maintained her open public persona, including sharing her diagnosis, surgery, and recovery from breast cancer in 2023. She also opened a new charity named Sarah’s Trust in 2021, which has focused on pandemic relief and helping Ukrainian refugees.\n\nRebecca M. Kulik"
