        "text": "As the niece of King Charles III, Princess Beatrice is ninth in line to the throne. She was born in 1988 and is the first born daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York and the older sister of Princess Eugenie.\n\nPrincess Beatrice wedding to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\n\nWeddings took a funny turn in 2020, but despite their original plans, royal couple Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi forged ahead and got married in July with a beautiful and intimate wedding day.\n\nWhile the pair have been friends since childhood through their families, Beatrice and Edoardo officially got together in 2018. The couple got engaged during a trip to Italy and they announced the happy news to the world on 26 September 2019.\n\nEdoardo was previously engaged to Dara Huang, an American architect. They have a son together, Christopher Woolf who was born in 2016.\n\nLike her sister Princess Eugenie, a lavish affair was planned for Princess Beatrice's wedding, due to take place at the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace on May 29, 2020. The big day however was postponed following the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInstead, Princess Beatrice and Edoardo went ahead with a much more private wedding on 17 July 2020 at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park.\n\nWho attended Princess Beatrice's wedding?\n\nWhile very little details have been shared about Princess Beatrice's wedding, we know that key members of the royal family including Queen Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip attended the wedding of around 20 guests also including Beatrice's parents Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.\n\nPrincess Eugenie wrote on her Instagram following the wedding: \"What a complete joy and privilege to watch you, my beautiful big sister, walk down the aisle to dear Edo. I am so proud of you and I'm so excited to support you in the next chapter of your life. We are going to have so much fun together. ⁣Happy wedding day to you both xxxx\"\n\nIt is believed that around 30 people joined the wedding reception which is said to have followed the same floral design and theme as the wedding.\n\nPrincess Beatrice wedding dress\n\nA wedding dress is a big part of any wedding, especially when it's a royal wedding.\n\nBeatrice paid homage to her late Grandmother, The Queen by not only wearing the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara which was worn when Queen Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947 but also Her Majesty's vintage dress by designer Norman Hartnell, with a few changes.\n\nBuckingham Palace provided more detail on Princess Beatrice's wedding dress: \"The dress is made from Peau De Soie taffeta in shades of ivory, trimmed with ivory Duchess satin, with organza sleeves. It is encrusted with diamanté and has a geometric checkered bodice. It was remodelled and fitted by Miss Angela Kelly and Mr Stewart Parvin.\"\n\nThe Queen had previously worn the dress to the premiere of Lawrence of Arabia in 1962 as well as a state dinner in Rome in 1961.\n\nHow wonderful do the Bride and Groom look?\n\nPrincess Beatrice of the United Kingdom\n\nAs a senior member of the Royal Family, Princess Beatrice became a Cousellor of State following the passing of her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. This is a senior position held by members of the royal family limited to the first four in the line of succession over the age of 21 and the sovereign's consort.\n\nAs well as working as a senior royal, she works closely with a number of charitable organisations and has previously worked at Sony Pictures and in software.\n\nPrincess Beatrice children\n\nPrincess Beatrice has also been busy growing future members of the royal family too. Following her wedding in 2020 to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, Beatrice gave birth to their daughter Sienna Elizabeth who was born on September 18, 2021.\n\nShe also has a stepson, Christopher Woolf, from her husband's relationship with architect Dara Huang.\n\nDoes Princess Beatrice have instagram?\n\nAlthough Princess Beatrice does have an Instagram account under @beayork, she keeps her Instagram private so the general public can't see it. Princess Eugenie however does have a public Instagram account under, and she often shares pictures of herself with her family.\n\nOther close family members who have Instagram accounts are Beatrice's husband, who you can find on Instagram as @edomapellimozzi. He regularly shares pictures of his wife Beatrice and their life. Her mum, Sarah Ferguson is also on Instagram as @sarahferguson15 and she tends to be very active on social media.\n\nPrincess Beatrice dyslexia\n\nBoth Princess Beatrice and Edoardo have dyslexia and she was diagnosed at the age of 7. Speaking as a patron of the Helen Arkell Dyslexia Charity, she mentioned how the Harry Potter books helped her to improve her reading skills. ‘The second story came out, I couldn’t put it down. Now I read so much quicker, so much better and I studied history at university which involved a lot of reading.’\n\nFeatures & Reviews Editor Emily Gilbert has been a journalist since 2016 and has worked across a variety of specialist and lifestyle brands both in print and online.
