        "text": "Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Theodora of the United Kingdom (1857-1944) is the youngest of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's nine children.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nBeatrice was praised for her long, golden hair in her youth. Like most of her siblings, she had blue eyes and pale skin.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBeatrice liked to impersonate her mother and her courtiers and had a good sense of humour. She was very loyal to her mother and served as her secretary and companion for her entire life.\n\nHistory[]\n\nChildhood[]\n\nBeatrice was born in 1857 as the youngest of the nine royal children. She was born shortly before her elder sister Vicky married.\n\nWhen she was four years old, her father died and her mother was consumed by grief. She replaced her father as her mother's closest confidente . Despite being the youngest of nine, she grew up quite lonely.\n\nThe sibling closest to her in age, Leo, was kept apart because of his haemophilia and raised along with their brother Arthur, mainly abroad, making her closest sibling in age Louise, who was nine years older. Her eldest sisters were already married by the time she became a teenager.\n\nBeatrice assisted her mother in everyday life until her death in 1901.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nVictoria lost her elder daughters (Vicky and Alice) to foreign husbands and therefore didn't want to lose any other children to foreign politics, especially Beatrice \"Baby\".\n\nBeatrice secretly got engaged to Henry Mountbatten, a military from Germany. Victoria didn't talk to her daughter for a year because of the secret engagement. Baby was eventually forgiven and married Henry in 1885. They had four children:\n\nAlexander Albert (1886)\n\nVictoria Eugenie Julia Ena (1887)\n\nLeopold Arthur Louis (1889)\n\nMaurice Victor Donald (1891)\n\nHenry tragically died in 1896 in Sierra Leone when their son was just 4, the same age Beatrice had been when losing her father. She lost her two youngest sons at an early age due to haemophilia and in the First World War.\n\nWhen her mother died, Beatrice edited all of her diaries and published them, while destroying most of it. She wasn't well-liked by her brother, the King, because she reminded him of their mother.\n\nTrivia[]"
