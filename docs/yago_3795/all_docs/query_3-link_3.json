        "text": "I can't find much about what happened to the rest of the Battenburgs. Most of what's out there has to do with Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Beatrice marrying Prince Louis (?) of Battenburg and their children in England, changing their name to Mountbatten, etc. What happened to the rest of them in Germany? The reason I ask is because my great-great-great-grandfather was married to Anna Catherina Battenburg, and other than birth/death dates and places I can't find out anything about her. Can anybody help me?\n\nThanks for your help! There was no mention of her in any of the info. Maybe ACB was illegitimate, or because of her marriage she was disowned and all mention of her removed? I don't know how that works. I just remember my grandmother showing me a postcard of the Crown Regalia of England once and saying we were erlated to them. My mom loved to talk family genealogy with my grandfather, but my grandmother would always leave the room, at which point my granfather would make a comment like \"Be careful when looking into family history. You might find something you didn't want to know.\" All I know is she was born (1792) and died (1852) in Olberade, Hessen, Germany.\n\nRubyPrincess168 said:\n\nI just remember my grandmother showing me a postcard of the Crown Regalia of England once and saying we were erlated to them... All I know is she was born (1792) and died (1852) in Olberade, Hessen, Germany.\n\nYour ancestor may well have been descended from the Hesse-Darmstadts, but the Battenberg title created for the the wife of Prince Alexander of Hesse did not come into being until they married in 1851, a year before your ancestor died.\n\nThe Hesse-Darmstadts were allied to the British Royal Family in 1862 when Queen Victoria's daughter Alice married Ludwig IV, later Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nThe Battenberg family-British Royal Family connection doesn't come until 1884 when Prince Louis of Battenberg married Alice and Ludwigs' daughter Princess Victoria. She was a first cousin once removed as her father was the son of Prince Alexander's brother Karl.\n\nA more immediate family connection took place in 1885 when Prince Henry of Battenberg married Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Beatrice.\n\nLudwig II - Karl - Ludwig IV - Victoria\n\nLudwig II - Alexander - Louis\n\nLudwig II - Alexander - Henry\n\nVictoria - Alice - Victoria\n\nVictoria - Beatrice\n\nRubyPrincess168 said:\n\nThanks for your help!

Thus, nowadays, it's a different name. There are several places in Germany called Battenberg. There is a commoner family of Battenburg/Battenberg (spelling of family names varied over the centuries) which originally came from the Rhineland (Duesseldorf area) and there were two noble families of this name (one from Hesse, one form the Rhineland) but their lines respectively stopped before 1700.\n\nBut the name of Battenberg which is used today by relatives of the BRF was a new creation for Julia Freiin von Hauke on her marriage to prince Alexander of Hesse. The extinct title of Battenberg (note: title, not family name) was recreated for her children. Thus, the list of relations should be clear as it's a rather recent creation."
