        "text": "\"You will never be alone my love, my heart is your home. Hand in hand, today, tomorrow and forever.\"\n\nThese were the words chosen by Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in his Instagram post, announcing his engagement to Princess Beatrice in September last year.\n\nThe couple have now married at a private ceremony in Windsor - after their wedding plans were disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSo who is Beatrice's new husband?\n\nKnown as Edo, the 36-year-old millionaire property tycoon is descended from Italian aristocracy, according to AFP news agency.\n\nHe has a young son called Wolfie with Dara Huang, his ex-fiancee, meaning Princess Beatrice is now a stepmother.\n\nEdoardo's father - Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi - is a count and former alpine skier who competed for Great Britain in the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan.\n\nHis mother is Nikki Williams-Ellis, who is married to the sculptor David Williams-Ellis.\n\nShe was previously married to Christopher Shale, a senior Tory and close friend of former prime minister David Cameron.\n\nMr Shale died from heart disease at Glastonbury Festival in 2011.\n\nMrs Williams-Ellis was appointed MBE in 2016, after being put forward by Mr Cameron on his resignation honours list.\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi is the director of Banda, a property development firm, according to Companies House.\n\nOn its website, Banda says its mission is to create \"exceptional homes\", and Mr Mapelli Mozzi's Instagram feed is filled with photographs of luxurious houses in London and New York which the company has been involved with.\n\nHis former flat - which he was selling in 2017 - is equally as stylish.\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn page, Mr Mapelli Mozzi - an alumnus of the University of Edinburgh - had developed more than 400,000 sq ft of London property with an estimated value of £700m by the time he was 30.\n\nHe also co-founded the charity Cricket Builds Hope. His stepfather came up with the idea but died before he could take if further.\n\nThe organisation coaches people to play cricket in Rwanda \"as a tool for positive social change\".\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi's Twitter account is dominated with discussion about property, but he has previously expressed support for campaigns against plastic pollution in the oceans and whaling in Japan.\n\nFurther back, the account has posted messages about gun control in the US, following the Florida school shooting, and also used the hashtag \"I'mWithHer\" on the night of the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nHe also used Twitter to criticise politicians Andrea Leadsom and Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIn 2016, ahead of the London mayoral election, he wrote a piece for Property Week saying there were \"simply not enough homes being built\" and the future mayor must be more forceful in pushing through redevelopment projects in central London.\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi has been a friend of Beatrice's family for some time.\n\nThe couple are said to have started a relationship after meeting again at Beatrice's sister Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018.\n\nThey had only been seen together in public a handful of times before their engagement.\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi designed the engagement ring himself, with the help of British jeweller Shaun Leane.\n\nThe large round brilliant cut central solitaire is set on a band of tapered diamond baguettes.\n\nIt is not known how much the ring cost, but the non-bespoke rings listed on Mr Leane's website are priced from £5,200 to £16,700.\n\nTheir wedding had been planned for 29 May but was rearranged because of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nThe new date had not been announced in advance and Buckingham Palace said the ceremony, held at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, was \"small\"."
