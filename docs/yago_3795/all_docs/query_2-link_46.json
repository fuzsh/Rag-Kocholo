        "text": "PRINCESS Beatrice had a tumultuous love life before she settled down with her property developer beau Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\n\nThe eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson has lived a fairly \"normal\" life for a royal - including ups and downs with spouses and heartbreak.\n\nBefore deciding to marry now-husband Edoardo and having two kids, Beatrice found herself at the centre of many scandals due to her pick in men.\n\nAt just 17 years old, the royal met her first love Paolo Liuzzo.\n\nLiuzzo and Beatrice’s relationship was revealed after he was invited on her family’s ski holiday in Verbier, Switzerland, in February 2006.\n\nFour years earlier he had been charged with the manslaughter of a student during a drunken brawl in Massachusetts.\n\nThe charge had later been downgraded to assault and battery, and Liuzzo only served a 100-hour community service sentence.\n\nRegardless, Fergie gave the couple’s relationship the thumbs up, saying: “We all have our own journeys and have to learn our way but Beatrice is a sensible girl, soon to be 18, with many friends including Paolo.”\n\nBut the publicity surrounding his royal romance led to him being hauled back to the US for flouting the conditions of his probation, since he was only allowed to travel abroad for work.\n\nHe had his three-year probation extended by six months as punishment and Beatrice publicly ended the romance.\n\nPaolo later said: “It was a stupid fist fight and if I had gone to trial, my lawyers were certain I’d have been found innocent.\n\n“But if it came out that me and Bea were dating, it wouldn’t be good for her image or Sarah’s so everyone was trying to keep our relationship a secret.”\n\nPaolo has since passed away due to a drug overdose.\n\nHis shock death in a Miami hotel came as insiders said he’d struggled with drugs and racked up debts with loan sharks over his gambling.\n\nBeatrice was told the news just weeks after her mum Sarah Ferguson was diagnosed with skin cancer.\n\nThe Sun exclusively revealed Paolo's body was flown back to his native Long Island, New York, for a funeral on February 16.\n\nAfter Beatrice's split from Liuzzo, she spent most of her 20s dating Virgin Galactic executive Dave Clark.\n\nFergie issued her approval for their coupling, saying: “I call him Mr Smiley because he smiles and he’s happy. I love Dave.”\n\nBeatrice enrolled on a finance course in San Francisco to be close to her boyfriend after he got a job at Uber.\n\nDespite whispers of wedding bells marriage never happened and they split by mutual agreement after ten years, in 2016.\n\nSingle Bea was then pictured with fitness trainer James Williams and CNBC host Wilfred Frost, son of journalist David Frost.\n\nBut each time suggestions of romance were shot down.\n\nIn 2018 she was confirmed to be dating Edo Mapelli Mozzi, a property developer and member of the Italian nobility.\n\nEdo, who had a son from a former relationship, swept Beatrice off her feet and proposed marriage.\n\nThe pandemic meant they cancelled plans for a wedding at St James’s Palace, in May 2020.\n\nInstead, they enjoyed an intimate Covid-safe wedding in July 2020, witnessed by only a handful of guests including the late Queen and Prince Philip at All Saints Chapel, Windsor."
