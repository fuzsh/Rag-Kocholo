        "text": "News | Royals\n\nWho is Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi? Meet Princess Beatrice’s new husband and real estate mogul\n\nThe pair were married this morning in Windsor\n\nMegan Hills|Stephanie Takyi17 July 2020\n\nPrincess Beatrice and real estate mogul Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi were married this morning in Windsor, where Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip and other members of the Royal Family watched them tie the knot in a socially distanced ceremony.\n\nFollowing repeated delays to their wedding, which was originally set to be on May 29 in London, the newlyweds held a ceremony at All Saints Chapel in Windsor where Princess Beatrice's father Prince Andrew gave the bride away.\n\nThe newlyweds announced their engagement last September, revealing the news and massive ring via the Duke of York’s official Twitter account. Seen smiling and embracing in photographs, the couple said that they were “extremely happy”.\n\nRichard Young/Shutterstock\n\nAfter Princess Beatrice and Mozzi were seen at high profile events together last year - including an invitation to Buckingham Palace for Mozzi and the Portrait Gala - it was believed that the pair were getting very serious. At the time, royal commentator and editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine Ingrid Seward claimed, “They’re going to get married – I was told by a member of the family. I think a wedding as early as next spring or summer is likely.”\n\nTheir relationship was serious for Mozzi to apparently not only meet the family but go on holiday with them. Mozzi was photographed at the Grand Prix in Bahrain with Princess Beatrice and Sarah Ferguson, in what appeared to be a VIP area. While Beatrice’s father Prince Andrew wasn’t pictured with them at the time, the royal was on official business in the city and most likely met up with the group at some point on the trip. Besides holidaying in Bahrain with the Yorks, the Daily Mail also reports that Fergie, Mozzi and Beatrice were also seen clubbing at Annabel’s just a few days earlier.\n\nGetty Images\n\nCompared to the high profile romances of her cousins, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Prince William and Kate Middleton, Princess Beatrice and Mozzi have kept things relatively low-key.\n\nBut who exactly is her husband? From his enthusiasm for interior design to his role as a leading luxury real estate developer, here’s everything you to know about Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\n\nDave Benett/Getty Images\n\nWho is Princess Beatrice’s husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi?\n\nGetty Images\n\nBeatrice is dating Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (\"Edo\" to his friends), an Italian businessman who has a young son from a previous relationship with architect and designer Dara Huang. In 2016, they welcomed a son, Christopher Woolf \"Wolfie\" Mapelli Mozzi.\n\nIn 2007 Mozzi founded property development company Banda, which promises to discreetly find clients multi-million pound homes.\n\nRead More\n\nJeremy Clarkson raises concern about his health after Kaleb Cooper spots issue\n\nTransfer news LIVE!

Clark later married new girlfriend, Lynn Anderson.\n\n“Beatrice and Edo have the same circle of friends and were introduced through a mutual chum,\" a source told The Sun. “They hit it off instantly and have a real laugh together. They’ve been on holiday together and Beatrice introduced him to Fergie and her dad...Everyone is thrilled that Bea is so happy and in such a good place right now\".\n\nAnother insider revealed to People that actually the pair go way back. A source said “they have known each other for years” - it turns out Mozzi's parents and hers are family friends. His late stepfather, Christopher Shale, was “an old friend of Beatrice’s parents”.\n\nSadly Shale passed away while at Glastonbury in 2011 and Princess Beatrice reportedly attended his funeral with her parents.\n\nWhat does he do for a living?\n\nMozzi is the founder and CEO of a property development agency and interior design company called Banda, specialising in finding and creating exceptional homes.\n\nThe company was founded in 2007 and Banda’s website describes Mozzi him as “one of the most sought after developers in London”.\n\nMozzi is the founder of a charity called Cricket Builds Hope, which uses the sport as a “tool for social change in Rwanda”. It aims to promote reconciliation and tackle gender inequality and has created partnerships with other groups focused around female empowerment.\n\nHow old is Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi?\n\nEdoardo is 37 years old.\n\nDoes he have an Instagram account?\n\nEdoardo does use Instagram and goes by the handle @edomapellimozzi, calling himself ‘Edo’ in his profile. You’re not likely to find pictures of him and Princess Beatrice together there, however - in fact, there aren't many pictures of Edo himself.\n\nInstead, his Instagram feed is a Pinterest-lovers dream, focused on gorgeous homes and interior design - fitting since it coincides with his \"passion for high end design”, as his website describes.\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
