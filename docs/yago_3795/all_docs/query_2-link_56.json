The royal couple tied the knot at a low-key ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic. They first began dating in 2018.\n\nEdoardo took to Instagram this morning (September 6) to reveal to his followers that his half-brother is the next to get married.\n\n‘Your engagement news fills my heart with so much happiness’\n\nSharing the exciting news with his 137,000 followers, Edoardo posted a snapshot of his half-brother, Alby, and his fiancée, Chelsea. The couple posed in front of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York and flashed radiant smiles.\n\n“So happy for my little bro Alby and Chelsea!” Edoardo began his caption. “Finding that special someone is truly the greatest blessing in life. Your engagement news fills my heart with so much happiness.”\n\nHe continued: “Wishing you both a lifetime of love, laughter, and endless adventures!”\n\nIn the space of nine hours, Edoardo’s post racked up more than 4,200 likes and over 30 comments, proving to have made an impact on his followers.\n\nFans send their congratulations\n\nReacting to the news, fans took to the comments section to wish the happy couple congratulations.\n\n“Congrats to them! They look so happy. I recognised this spot immediately… It’s my neighborhood!” one user wrote. “Congratulations to both Alby and Chelsea! How very exciting!” another person shared. “Congratulations to both. Health, happiness and love today and always,” a third user remarked.\n\n“Brothers love is one of the best things in the world. You’re lucky to have such blessing,” a fourth follower commented.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Edoardo’s family life\n\nIn September 2021, Beatrice and Edoardo welcomed a daughter, Sienna. While this was Beatrice’s first child, Edoardo already had a son, Wolfie, seven, with ex-fiancée Dara Haung.\n\nBeatrice’s mother, Sarah Ferguson, revealed on her podcast, Tea Talks, that the couple successfully co-parent with no issues.\n\n“The most exciting thing is that Sienna is very very strong. She’s 18 months, something like that, and Wolfie, her brother is seven, so she’s really strong – she has to be,” she said.\n\nSarah described their bond, explaining: “Wolfie says: ‘Come on Sienna!’ and off they go, and they’re very close and have a great relationship.”\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Edoardo’s wedding anniversary\n\nTo honor their third wedding anniversary, Edoardo shared a touching Instagram post with a heartfelt message.\n\n“Happy wedding anniversary to the most beautiful wife in the world. I am so grateful for every moment we have shared, every challenge we have overcome, and every dream we have pursued together,” he wrote.\n\n“I love you more than words can say, and I can’t wait to celebrate many more anniversaries with you,” Edoardo continued.\n\nRead more: Sarah Ferguson urges people to ‘not believe everything you read’ as she gushes over ‘family unit’ with Andrew and daughters"
