We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can't wait to be married.\n\n\"We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.\"\n\nIn a rare tweet from Princess Beatrice, she shared the statement and said: \"I'm so excited to announce my engagement to Edo.\"\n\nPrincess Beatrice's parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, said in a statement: \"We are thrilled that Beatrice and Edoardo have got engaged, having watched their relationship develop with pride.\n\n\"We are the lucky parents of a wonderful daughter who has found her love and companion in a completely devoted friend and loyal young man. We send them every good wish for a wonderful family future.\"\n\nSarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, tweeted: \"I know what a mother feels so I have tears of joy. I am so proud of this sensational news.\n\n\"Andrew and I are just the luckiest people ever to have two great sons in law.\"\n\nThe Duchess shared a number of photos of the couple, which show them loved-up and happy.\n\nPrincess Eugenie, 31, shared a photo shoot she did with the couple on her Instagram account, and said: \"Beabea - wow!\n\n\"I'm so happy for you my dearest big sissy and dear Edo. It's been a long time coming and you two are meant to be. [Photos] by me!!\"\n\nThe ring, which was designed by Mr Mapelli Mozzi, is thought to be worth around £60,000, according to jewellers 77 Diamonds.\n\nPrincess Beatrice's husband-to-be, who is also known as Edo, is a businessman and property tycoon, and was reportedly a friend of the family before they began their relationship in the autumn of 2018.\n\nThe parents of Mr Mapelli Mozzi, Nikki Williams-Ellis and Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi, said: \"We are truly delighted about Edoardo and Beatrice's engagement.\n\n\"Our family has known Beatrice for most of her life. Edo and Beatrice are made for each other, and their happiness and love for each other is there for all to see.\n\n\"They share an incredibly strong and united bond, their marriage will only strengthen what is already a wonderful relationship.\"\n\nIt will be the fourth royal wedding in recent years, following the marriage of Lady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston earlier this year, and the nuptials of Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank and Harry and Meghan in 2018.\n\n:: Listen to the Behind the Headlines podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\n\nWho is Princess Beatrice's fiancé, Edo Mapelli Mozzi?\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi, 34, and Princess Beatrice reportedly kept their relationship secret for about a month before it became public in November.\n\nThey got together after Beatrice split from her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, whom she had been with for 10 years.\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi and Princess Beatrice's first public appearance together wasn't until March, when they attended the National Portrait Gallery Gala together.\n\nIn May they went to Ella Windsor's wedding together, at Windsor Castle.\n\nAnnouncing their engagement on his Instagram, Mr Mapelli Mozzi wrote: \"You will never be alone my love, my heart is your home. Hand in hand, today, tomorrow and forever.\"\n\nPictures he shared include Princess Beatrice's playful side, with her fingers behind his head in a bunny ears pose.\n\nHis Instagram bio says: \"UK real estate specialist. Creating value through acquisitions, asset management, planning and development.\"\n\nHis profile on the site is mostly home related, with beautiful interiors as well as occasional appreciation of architecture.\n\nIn June, he attended the D-Day commemorations in Normandy and shared pictures of the new monument at the British Normandy Memorial which included shots of Theresa May with Jean Claude Juncker.\n\nAccording to Town and Country Mag, Mr Mapelli Mozzi's stepfather was Christopher Shale, a close friend of David Cameron, who died at the Glastonbury festival in 2011.\n\nBeatrice, as well as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, attended his funeral.\n\nMr Mozzi was nominated for an MBE by David Cameron in 2016, when he left office.\n\nHe is the co-founder of a charity, which was inspired by his late stepfather. Called Cricket Builds Hope, it aims to use sport to tackle \"deep-seated social issues like gender inequality\".\n\nHe is said to be a multi-millionaire.\n\nHe has a toddler son called Wolfie, from a previous relationship."
