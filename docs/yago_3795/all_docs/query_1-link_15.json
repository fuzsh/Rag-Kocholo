        "text": "Princess Beatrice has married property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi at a private ceremony in Windsor.\n\nThe wedding took place on Friday morning at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge. It was attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, along with other close relatives.\n\nBeatrice was initially due to marry in May but coronavirus delayed the plans.\n\nThe new date had not been announced in advance and Buckingham Palace said the ceremony was \"small\".\n\nThe wedding took place at 11:00 BST in accordance with all relevant government guidelines, the palace said in a statement.\n\nWhen the coronavirus lockdown began on 23 March, weddings in England were banned under almost all circumstances. However, since 4 July, ceremonies of up to 30 people have been allowed to take place.\n\nThe Queen, 94, and Philip, 99, have been isolating at Windsor since March and the ceremony is believed to be the first time the pair have attended a family gathering since lockdown began.\n\nLater on Friday, she was pictured knighting Captain Sir Tom Moore, the 100-year-old who raised more than Â£32m for NHS charities - her first official engagement in person since lockdown.\n\nAfter the investiture, the Queen told the veteran fundraiser: \"My granddaughter got married this morning. Both Philip and I managed to get there - very nice.\"\n\nThe princess, 31, and Mr Mapelli Mozzi, 35, had originally planned to marry on 29 May at the Chapel Royal, St James Palace, in London.\n\nThe new venue of Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park - a short drive from Windsor Castle - is Beatrice's childhood home. Her parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, still live at the property and also attended the ceremony.\n\nIt was held at the chapel regularly used by the Queen as her place of worship when she is staying at Windsor.\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi - known as Edo - and Beatrice began dating in autumn 2018. They got engaged during a weekend trip to Italy last September.\n\nTheir families have known one another for many years. The couple are said to have started a relationship after meeting again at Beatrice's sister Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank.\n\nThe wedding at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in October 2018 was attended by 850 guests, while 1,200 people chosen by ballot followed proceedings from the grounds.\n\nBeatrice, who is ninth in line to the throne, is not a full-time working royal but works for Afiniti, an artificial intelligence software firm, where she is vice president of partnerships and strategy.\n\nMr Mapelli Mozzi is the son of former Olympic skier Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi and Nikki Williams-Ellis and is a count himself."
