        "text": "Summary\n\nThis subject is presumably Princes Beatrice Mary Victori Feodor, fifth daughter of Queen Victoria. Stocker records a bronze statuette of Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice executed by Boehm in 1872 and in the Royal Collection at Windsor. The purpose of the present model is unknown.\n\nBoehm (1834-1890) was an English sculptor and medallist born in Austrian, as the youngest son of Joseph Daniel Boehm (1794â1865), a court medallist and director of the Imperial Mint at Vienna. From 1848 to 1851 Joseph Edgar attended Leighâs art academy (later Heatherleyâs) in London and drew the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum. On his return to Vienna he enrolled at the Akademie der Bildenden KÃ¼nste. Around 1858â9 he visited Italy, where he developed a lasting admiration for early Renaissance sculpture. From 1859 to 1862 he worked in Paris and was influenced by the work of Paul Gayrard (1807â1855). Boehm settled in London in 1862 where he befriended John Leech and John Everett Millais, both of whom he portrayed in statuettes in 1863. A statuette of William Makepeace Thackeray (1864) led to an edition of 70 plaster casts. Boehm frequently worked in terracotta, a material common in French sculpture but less familiar in English. Queen Victoriaâs admiration of Boehmâs statuettes led to an association with the royal family that lasted from 1869 until his death. Most of Boehmâs works are portrait busts. Boehm was immensely prolific: some 360 different works are documented. He was a highly consistent sculptor, rarely deviating from his brand of realism. He was modest about his immense popularity and aware of his imaginative shortcomings (cit.: M. Stocker: 'Boehm, Joseph Edgar').\n\nBibliographic references\n\nList of Objects in the Art Division South Kensington Museum acquired during the Year 1892.
