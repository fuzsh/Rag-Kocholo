        "text": "With the recent news that Princess Beatrice is engaged to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, we are taking a look at Beatrice’s fiancé.\n\nEdoardo Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi was born on 19 November 1983 to British-Italian Count Alessandro “Alex” Mapelli-Mozzi and Nikki Williams-Ellis. His father is from an Italian noble family giving him the style of ‘Count’ which he does not use in the United Kingdom, and his mother was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2016 by Her Majesty The Queen as part of Prime Minister David Cameron’s parting honours list. Edoardo has one older sister, Natalia Alice Yeomans (b. 1981) and a younger maternal half-brother, Alby Shale (b. 1991). His stepfather was the late Conservative politician, Christopher Shale.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nHis well-connected family has been friends with the Yorks for decades, and as such, he has known Princess Beatrice since they were children.\n\nEdoardo, or Edo as he more commonly known, studied at Radley College and the University of Edinburgh before working in property development and founding Banda – an interior design and property development company.\n\nThe future grandson-in-law of The Queen is also known for his charity work and co-founded the “Cricket Builds Hope” charity which uses the sport of cricket in Rwanda to enact positive social change. The charity was the brainchild of his stepfather who died before he could make the charity a reality.\n\nMr Mozzi had been in a relationship with American architect and designer, Dara Huang, with whom he had a son, Christopher Woolf “Wolfie” Mapelli Mozzi (b. 2016). The couple were engaged but broke up in 2018. A few months later, he began dating Princess Beatrice, and they appeared at several events together including the wedding of Lady Gabriella Windsor to Thomas Kingston in May 2019.\n\nIn Italy in September 2019, Mozzi proposed to Beatrice with a diamond ring he designed himself with the help of jeweller Shaun Leane. Their engagement was announced on 26 September 2019 with a wedding set sometime in 2020.\n\nAnnouncing the engagement, the couple said, “We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement. We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can’t wait to be married. We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.”\n\nFurther details regarding the wedding will be announced in due course."
