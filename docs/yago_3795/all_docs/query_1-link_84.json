        "text": "Princess Eugenie Full Name\n\nBeatrice Elizabeth Mary Mountbatten-Windsor Mapelli Mozzi Birth\n\nAugust 8, 1988 (age 36)\n\nLondon's Portland Hospital, London Spouse\n\nEdoardo Mapelli Mozzi (m. 2020) Issue\n\nSienna Mapelli Mozzi Parents\n\nPrince Andrew, Duke of York\n\nSarah, Duchess of York House\n\nWindsor\n\nPrincess Beatrice, Mrs. Mapelli Mozzi (Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, born August 8, 1988) is a member of british royal family. She eldest daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Sarah, Duchess of York. She is 9th in Line of succession to british throne.\n\nShe has a younger sister Princess Eugenie (b.1990).\n\nIn 2020, She married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, an english property developer and italian noble. They have a daughter Sienna (b.2021) who is 10th in Line of succession. She has a stepson Christopher \"Wolfie\" Mapelli Mozzi (b.2016) from Edoardo's previous relationship.\n\nUpon death of Queen Elizabeth II and accession of King Charles III, Princess Beatrice became a Counsellor of State, a senior position within the royal family limited to the first four in the Line of succession over the age of 21 and the sovereign's consort.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nPrince Beatrice was born on August 8, 1988 at Portland Hospital in London. On August 23, 1988, Her name, Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, was announced by The Duke and Duchess of York. Her name honors Queen Victoria's fifth child, Princess Helena, her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II and George V's wife, Mary of Teck.\n\nBeatrice's parents divorced amicably when she was seven years old. The Duke and Duchess of York had agreed to joint custody of their two children. After the divorce, the Queen provided her parents with £1.4 million to set up a trust fund for her and Eugenie. Beatrice and her sister frequently travelled abroad with one or both of their parents\n\nEducation[]\n\nBeatrice began her early education at the independent Upton House School in Windsor, in 1991. From there, she and her sister both attended the independent Coworth Park School (now Coworth Flexlands School) from 1995. Beatrice continued her education at the independent St George's School in Ascot, where she was a pupil from 2000 to 2007.\n\nShe was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of seven and went public with the diagnosis in 2005. She delayed sitting her GCSE exams for one year. She remained at St George's to take her A-Levels, earning an 'A' in drama, a 'B' in history, and a 'B' in film studies. She was elected Head Girl in her final year, and was a member of the school choir. Beatrice celebrated her 18th birthday with a masked ball at Windsor Castle in July 2006. Nikolai von Bismarck took her official birthday portrait.\n\nIn September 2008, Beatrice started a three-year course studying for a BA in history and history of ideas at Goldsmiths, University of London. She graduated in 2011 with a 2:1 degree.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nn March 2019, Beatrice attended a fundraising event at the National Portrait Gallery, London, accompanied by property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the son of Alex Mapelli-Mozzi, a British-Italian Olympic alpine skier and descendant of the Italian nobility; the BBC describes Edoardo as \"also a count\", like his father; however, that title is not officially recognised in Italy or the UK. The couple are believed to have begun dating in September 2018. Together, they attended the May 2019 wedding of Lady Gabriella Windsor, Beatrice's second cousin once removed.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Mozzi became engaged in Italy in September 2019, with their engagement formally announced by the Duke of York's Office on 26 September.\n\nThe wedding was scheduled to take place on 29 May 2020 at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace, followed by a private reception in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, but first the reception and then the wedding itself were postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The wedding was eventually held in private on 17 July 2020, at the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Royal Lodge, Windsor, and was not publicly announced in advance. Her father’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier and convicted sex offender who was charged with sex trafficking of minors and killed himself in prison, greatly impacted her wedding plans. After Prince Andrew’s subsequent BBC interview, he was retired from royal duties and her wedding arrangements were scaled down; he walked her down the aisle, but he did not appear in the official wedding portraits released by Buckingham Palace. Her wedding dress was a remodelled Norman Hartnell dress that was lent by the Queen, and she wore the Queen Mary Fringe Tiara that was also worn by the Queen at her own wedding.\n\nPrincess Beatrice has a stepson, Christopher Woolf (born 2016), her husband's child from a relationship with architect Dara Huang. She gave birth to a daughter, Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi, on 18 September 2021 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Chelsea, London. At birth, Sienna was eleventh in line to the throne, and following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022, she became tenth in line.\n\nSienna was christened at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace, on 29 April 2022. Beatrice and her husband lived at first in a four-bedroom apartment at St James's Palace, but reportedly moved to a manor home in the Cotswolds in late 2022\n\nTitles and succession[]\n\nAugust 8, 1988 - July 17, 2020: Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary of York\n\nJuly 17, 2020 - present: Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, Mrs. Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\n\nAs a male-line grandchild of the sovereign, Beatrice was known as \"Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York\", at birth, with the territorial designation coming from her father's title, Duke of York. Since her marriage, she has been styled \"Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice, Mrs Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\" in the Court Circular.\n\nAlthough her children might not hold the title of the Prince/Princess like her mother, Beatrice's husband Edoardo descends from Italian aristocracy. This meant that when Beatrice married him in 2020, they became an Italian \"Contessa\" and \"Nobile Donna.\""
