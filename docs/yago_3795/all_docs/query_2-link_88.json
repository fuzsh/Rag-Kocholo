        "text": "Poor Princess Beatrice. Two years ago, her younger sister, Princess Eugenie, celebrated her nuptials to Casamigos ambassador Jack Brooksbank in a blowout fairy-tale wedding at Windsor Castle. Less than a year later, Beatrice debuted her extremely rich boyfriend, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. She and the “multimillionaire property tycoon” were soon engaged, and scheduled their nuptials for May 2020.\n\nIt looked like Beatrice was all set for her own royal wedding, but then came the coronavirus pandemic, and in mid-March Buckingham Palace announced that the nuptials would be canceled. “The couple will carefully consider government advice before deciding whether a private marriage might take place amongst a small group of family and friends,” the statement said. According to People, Beatrice had already changed her wedding plans twice due to her father, Prince Andrew’s, ever-evolving ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. As you may recall, in the months leading up to Beatrice’s wedding, a disastrous interview with the BBC — the one in which he described his friendship with the alleged sex trafficker as “useful,” if also “unbecoming” — led to Andrew’s effective excommunication from the royal family.\n\nAll was quiet until last week , when it was announced that Beatrice and Mapelli Mozzi had finally been wed in a small, socially-distanced ceremony on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Photos were released this morning, and show the the princess in a vintage gown and diamond tiara loaned to her by Queen Elizabeth, the latter of which was worn by the monarch herself on her own 1947 wedding day. Images reveal that the Queen and Prince Philip were present at the nuptials (one photograph shows them standing six feet apart from the newlyweds) and CNN reports that Prince Andrew walked Beatrice down the aisle, although he is not in any of the public photographs. Mapelli Mozzi’s young son, Wolfie, reportedly served as the best man and page boy."
