        "text": "Princess Beatrice and her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi marked their fourth wedding anniversary yesterday. In honor of the occasion, Edoardo, better known as Edo, shared a sweet, never-before-seen snap from their big day to his Instagram.\n\n\"Happy 4th wedding anniversary my love. üíç. Every day is so special with you. I love you so much,\" he wrote in the caption for the image, which features himself and Beatrice kissing under the trees in Windsor, done up in their wedding attire.\n\nThe couple married at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at the Royal Lodge in Windsor on July 17, 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. They had originally planned to wed that May in a more elaborate ceremony, similar to the wedding of Beatrice's sister, Princess Eugenie, two years before, but due to safety concerns, the couple pared back their celebrations to a private affair attended by a few close family members including Beatrice's grandparents, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nFamily connections were at the forefront of the day, when Beatrice wore a vintage gown by designer Norman Hartnell, which she borrowed from Elizabeth's collection‚Äîthe Queen had previously worn the dress in 1962 to the premiere of Lawrence of Arabia at the Odeon theater in Leicester Square, and to a 1961 state dinner in Rome. Beatrice also donned the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara, which Queen Elizabeth wore to her own wedding to Prince Philip on November 20, 1947.\n\nIn the four years since their wedding, Beatrice and Edo have marked a number of milestones, including the birth of their first child, a little girl named Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi. The couple also share Edo's son from a previous relationship, Christopher Woolf Mapelli Mozzi, aka \"Woflie,\" who Beatrice has referred to has her \"bonus son.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like"
