        "text": "Rumors about Beatrice's relationship with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, whom she calls \"Edo,\" broke back in November 2018, but the couple went public with their relationship at the National Portrait Gallery's annual gala in March 2019. Before that, Beatrice had apparently been single since 2016, following a split from longterm boyfriend Dave Clark, whom she dated for almost ten years.\n\nThe couple officially wed in a secret ceremony in Windsor on July 17, 2020, less than a year after the couple first announced their engagement.\n\nHere's what we know about the latest spouse to join the royal family.\n\nHe gushes about his wife in interviews.\n\nBeatrice's new husband is most definitely smitten with the royal. In an interview with Financial Times in October 2020, Mapelli Mozzi romantically revealed, \"An object I would never part with is my wedding ring.\"\n\nHe also opened up about the suit he wore to his wedding to Beatrice, and revealed, \"The last item of clothing I added to my wardrobe was the Huntsman morning suit I wore for my wedding. I worked with a brilliant cutter and creative director called Campbell Carey. It was a wonderful process and for the rest of my life, every time I put on that suit I’ll feel happy.\"\n\nMapelli Mozzi \"commissioned\" a special gift for Beatrice.\n\nDuring his interview with Financial Times, Mapelli Mozzi shared details about the present he gave to Princess Beatrice in 2019. \"The best gift I’ve ever given is a bronze figurative sculpture, which I commissioned from my stepfather, the sculptor David Williams-Ellis, for my wife’s birthday last year,\" he explained. \"His studio is next to my mother’s house so we’d see him in there every day covered in clay. It’s so special for us to have a piece of his work in our home.\"\n\nThey've known each other for a long time.\n\nIn the couple's engagement announcement, Mozzi's parents, Nikki Williams-Ellis and Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi, said \"Our family has known Beatrice for most of her life. Edo and Beatrice are made for each other, and their happiness and love for each other is there for all to see. They share an incredibly strong and united bond, their marriage will only strengthen what is already a wonderful relationship.\"\n\nPeople reported in November that Beatrice moved in the same circles as Mozzi for years, and because their families are friends, the new couple \"didn’t need to go through a formal introduction to each other’s parents.\"\n\nMozzi's late stepfather, Christopher Shale, was close friends with Prince Andrew and Duchess Sarah, according to the Evening Standard. He was also close friends with former British Prime Minister David Cameron, per The Telegraph, and died of a heart attack while at Glastonbury music festival in 2011.\n\nThey made their first public appearance together in March 2019.\n\nMozzi and the princess officially went public with a joint appearance at a gala at London’s National Portrait Gallery on March 12, 2019.\n\nPrincess Beatrice was seen wearing a deep red velvet dress with tights and platform heels, while her man looked dapper in a tux and bow tie.\n\nHe's a successful multimillionaire who started his own business.\n\nPeople reports that Mozzi's a \"multi-millionaire property tycoon,\" and according to his Instagram account, he describes himself as a \"UK real estate specialist\" who \"[creates] value through acquisitions, asset management, planning and development.\" He's CEO of Banda Property, a property development company.\n\nAccording to Private Air magazine, in Mozzi's business, \"one-time nightclubs are transformed into ultra-luxury dwellings,\" which sounds like an exceedingly useful skill to have.\n\nBeatrice and his friends call him \"Edo.\"\n\nIs Edo the best nickname of all time? Quite possibly.\n\nHe has a son called Wolfie.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Mozzi young son named Wolfie with Dara Huang, an American architect and designer with whom he was previously in a relationship. Prior to the wedding, there were reports that Mozzi asked the three-year-old to be his best man.\n\nBeatrice and Mozzi have made several high-profile and low-key appearances together.\n\nMozzi and Beatrice attended Lady Gabriella Windsor's wedding together in May 2019 and Prince Andrew's annual Pitch@Palace event at St. James Palace in June 2019. They even went on a double date with Eugenie and Brooksbank.\n\nBeatrice and Mozzi attend Lady Gabriella Windsor’s wedding at Windsor Castle on May 18.\n\nMozzi and Beatrice got engaged in Italy.\n\nMozzi popped the question during a weekend trip with Beatrice in his home country in September 2019.\n\nIn a joint statement, the couple said of their engagement, \"We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can't wait to be married. We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.\"\n\nHe announced his engagement on Instagram.\n\n\"You will never be alone my love, my heart is your home. Hand in hand, today, tomorrow and forever,\" he wrote.\n\nHe designed Beatrice's engagement ring with London-based jewelry designer Shaun Leane.\n\nPrincess Beatrice’s engagement ring.\n\nMozzi worked with British designer Shaune Leane to craft Beatrice's Victorian- and Art Deco-inspired diamond ring. \"Being able to incorporate both Edoardo and Princess Beatrice's characters into the design has resulted in a unique ring that represents their love and lives entwining,\" Leane said in a statement.\n\nHe and Beatrice secretly married.\n\nTheir royal wedding was originally scheduled for May 29, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, the couple canceled their big, flourishing ceremony. However, they quietly tied the knot months later on July 17 at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge in Windsor. Only about 20 people were in attendance, and the guests were mostly close family including the queen, Prince Philip, and the bride's parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York."
