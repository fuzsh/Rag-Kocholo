        "text": "LONDON — Princess Beatrice, the eldest daughter of Britain's Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, was married in a small ceremony Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed.\n\nThe red-haired royal married property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in the private ceremony at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at the Royal Lodge in Windsor.\n\nThe bride's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh and close family attended, Buckingham Palace said in a statement, and the ceremony took place in accordance with all relevant government guidelines.\n\nAs a result, it was a scaled-down affair due to the social restrictions in place across the country to tackle the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBeatrice became engaged to Mozzi in September 2019, while they were on a weekend trip to Italy.\n\nThe couple had planned to marry in May at the Chapel Royal inLondon's St James’s Palace, where Queen Victoria wed Prince Albert in 1840. The reception was due to be held in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.\n\nBut like thousands of Britons have experienced, the COVID-19 crisis scuppered their nuptial plans.\n\nOfficial government guidelines limit wedding ceremonies in England to around 30 people, who must also adhere to social distancing rules. Large reception parties are curtailed with music and food limited and the bride and groom encouraged to wash their hands before exchanging rings.\n\nThe measures have ruled out all large-scale celebrations and forced thousands of couples in England to postpone or delay their ceremonies.\n\n\"We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together,\" the couple said in a joint statement when they got engaged last year. \"We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.\""
