In his latest post, he wrote a loving message for the royal and revealed two previously unseen snaps.\n\nWho’s sitting in the Wimbledon Royal Box this year?\n\nRead More\n\n‘I am so grateful for every moment we have shared, every challenge we have overcome, and every dream we have pursued together. I love you more than words can say, and I can't wait to celebrate many more anniversaries with you.’\n\nProperty developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the son of Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi, a former British Olympian and Italian nobleman, proposed to Princess Beatrice, the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, in September 2019. They were long-time family friends but started dating in October 2018.\n\nOn Friday 17 July 2020, the couple married at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in an intimate family ceremony attended by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

The elegant gown was made from Peau De Soie taffeta in shades of ivory, trimmed with ivory Duchess satin and with organza sleeves. Encrusted with diamanté and with a geometric chequered bodice, it was remodelled and fitted for the princess by Angela Kelly, the Queen’s Dresser, and Stewart Parvin.\n\nPrincess Beatrice also wore Queen Mary’s diamond fringe tiara, on loan from her grandmother, which was worn by the Queen on her own wedding day in 1947. The exquisite piece was originally made for Queen Mary by Garrard and Co. in 1919, from a diamond necklace that was a wedding day gift from Queen Victoria. The groom, meanwhile, looked distinguished in a morning suit. Princess Beatrice’s ring was designed by Shaun Leane, while Edo’s vintage gold band was designed by Josh Collins.\n\nRead More\n\nA radiant First Lady: Sir Keir Starmer is Britain's new Prime Minister and his wife Victoria is emerging from her north London cocoon into the global limelight.
