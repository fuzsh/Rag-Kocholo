        "text": "Princess Beatrice, 31, was first rumoured to be going out with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 37, in October 2018, when sources claimed that he had already met her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York. Princess Beatrice’s ex Dave Clark had already tied the knot with his partner of two years, Lynn Anderson, earlier that year in July, so it was about time for Princess Beatrice to move on romantically.\n\nFast forward to now; on September 26 2019, Princess Eugenie announced the engagement of her sister and Mozzi on Instagram with photographs taken herself. ‘I'm so happy for you my dearest big sissy and dear Edo,’ she captioned the images, that were taken in Italy earlier that month.\n\nPrincess Beatrice is engaged to Italian millionaire Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\n\nRead More\n\nMozzi, who is five years Beatrice's senior, is CEO of a property development and interior design company, Banda Property, which he founded in 2007. The company specialises in sourcing high-end, luxury London properties; its website attests that the houses are 'meticulously tailored to the individual needs' of its discerning, wealthy clients, attaining such success as to have ‘made Banda one of the most sought after developers in London’.\n\nBanda's prosperity is thought to have made Mozzi a multi-millionaire, yet the 36-year-old is not all mercenary ambition; he is also the co-founder of a charity, Cricket Builds Hope, an organisation that teaches cricket in Rwanda.\n\nMozzi is believed to have been engaged once before, to Dara Huang. Huang is a Chinese-American architect and designer who divides her time between London and Hong Kong and is the founder of an architecture and interior design studio, Design Haus Liberty. The former couple have a child together, a two-year-old son named Christopher Woolf – affectionately nicknamed ‘Wolfie’. It is thought he will serve as a pageboy at their upcoming nuptials.\n\nWhile some potential partners may find a princess's royal pedigree somewhat intimidating, Mozzi is thought to have some aristocratic roots of his own, with members of the Italian nobility amongst his ancestors. He also comes with sporting pedigree; his father is a former alpine skier, Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi. Now 68, the elder Mozzi represented Great Britain in three events at the 1972 Winter Olympics. Recently, the Count revealed that Beatrice will be able to style herself as an Italian Contessa when she marries his son, and that they will also both inherit his glamorous palazzo, Villa Mapelli Mozzi, just outside of Milan.\n\nMozzi’s parents separated when he was a child, and he was thought to be close to his stepfather, the British businessman and Conservative politician Christopher Shale, who died in 2011. Indeed Beatrice herself was present at the funeral, on account of having been family friends with Mozzi for some years before the couple became romantically involved; despite his Italian heritage, Mozzi is fully integrated into British society, having attended Radley College in Oxfordshire and Edinburgh University.\n\nSince his first official appearance with Beatrice in March at the National Gallery’s Portrait Gala event and the Bahrain Grand Prix soon after, Mozzi has become a fixture at numerous events alongside the princess.\n\nPredictions of an engagement had been echoing around society in the months leading up to the proposal. In July, bookies suspended betting on whether the announcement would be made after a dramatic increase in bets sparked suspicion of inside knowledge. While the Duchess of Cornwall and, more recently, the Duchess of Sussex have broken down the stigma towards divorced individuals marrying into the royal family, Beatrice will be the first of the young royals to accumulate a stepchild through her marriage."
