        "text": "Britain's Princess Beatrice tied the knot with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a private ceremony at Windsor Castle on Friday.\n\nThe couple got married at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge on the Windsor grounds in a small ceremony \"attended by The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh and close family,\" according to a statement released by the palace.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, 94, and her husband Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, have been self-isolating at Windsor Castle since March.\n\nThe bride wore a vintage dress by the late British designer Norman Hartnell, paired with the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara. Both belonged to her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and the tiara was the queen's chosen headpiece on her wedding day in 1947, according to the palace.\n\nIn a heartwarming message, Princess Eugenie said she was so proud of her \"beautiful big sister.\"\n\n\"I'm so excited to support you in the next chapter of your life. We are going to have so much fun together,\" she added.\n\nPrincess Beatrice, the daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, the Duchess of York, was originally set to get married in May in London, but she and her fianc√© were forced to postpone their nuptials due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOngoing lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom currently limit weddings and civil partnership ceremonies to 30 guests. According to the palace, \"the wedding took place in accordance with all relevant government guidelines.\"\n\nThe couple got engaged in September 2019, when 35-year-old Mapelli Mozzi proposed to the 31-year-old princess during a weekend getaway in Italy."
