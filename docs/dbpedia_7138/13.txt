Burning Heart Records is an independent record label based in Ã–rebro, Sweden. It has a close affiliation with Californian label Epitaph Records, who own the rights to distribute Burning Heart's output in North America. It also started a German office in Berlin in the end of 2003.

Burning Heart has proved extremely successful in launching European (especially Swedish) bands to a global audience. Their successes have included The Hives, Turbonegro, The (International) Noise Conspiracy, Millencolin, No Fun At All and Refused.

The label has a reputation for garage punk bands, but has released albums ranging from grindcore and experimental hardcore to alternative pop and ska as well as some rap in recent years over its ten-year history.
