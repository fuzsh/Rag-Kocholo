        "text": "<strong>Editorial</strong> Matthew Moore Editor Three issues into Northern Blaze now and still the most commonly asked question I get is why I only cover Irish bands. Now seeing as these people tend to have not given the time to appreciate Irish <strong>Metal</strong>, or tend to dismiss all local bands out of hand I can see why Northern Blaze’s parochial focus might be mistaken for mindless scene-patriotism. Well I would like to take this opportunity to assure the cynics that it is not. I’ve never really understood praising a band simply because of a shared nationality- that is not what Northern Blaze is about. Take Terrorizer UK’s recent feature on the current wave of British Death(core)- I really think some sort of misplaced pride must have been at work over real conviction when the magazine suggested that Trigger The Bloodshed and Annotations Of An Autopsy’s record sales constitute a scene in greater health than British death was in the early 90’s with Napalm Death and Carcass, or in the early 00’s with Gorerotted and Akercocke. I honestly hope these journos don’t actually believe that such passable material being lapped up by a transient audience who will in all likelihood move onto pretending to love Black <strong>Metal</strong> when this teen-angsty film adaptation of Lords Of Chaos comes out makes a stronger scene than the UK had when bands with real integrity and great material like Cancer and Benediction were kicking about. I will concede that a lot of these bands are technically gifted and they probably do believe in what they are doing but I think I speak for a lot of Death <strong>Metal</strong> fans when I say they are yet to convince me. Conventional musical talent does have a place in Death <strong>Metal</strong>, but is not an essential component; passion, honesty and yes, an image or aura that says “we live, breathe and shit Death <strong>Metal</strong>” are however. And then there is that certain je ne sais quoi that makes great Death <strong>Metal</strong> truly outstanding. These are what I see as lacking in the current UK scene as well as the USA and elsewhere, but I can say honestly that I can spot these qualities in abundance here in <strong>Ireland</strong>. Our longest running bands (Abaddon Incarnate, Putrefy and Morphosis) have battled lineup struggles and general international indifference to unleash their strongest material yet that is more than capable of standing up alongside more renowned acts while younger acts like Warpath and Skewered are proving that bringing a bucketload of gore to the equation doesn’t mean your music has to sound terrible. The likes of Condemned and Slave Zero are managing to create Death <strong>Metal</strong> with a real individual flair whilst Overoth and Existing Threat are revelling in their old school to the bone approach which is ironically twice as compelling than most of the modern junk. Lastly Lesshelp and I’ll Eat Your Face are bringing a touch of fun in these dark times that Death <strong>Metal</strong> needs much more than Trigger The Bloodshed’s adolescent lyrical repackaging of the 6 o’clock news. I’m not saying that everybody has to agree with me or that you can’t listen to these bands if you really want to; this is a fanzine after all- it’s just one guy’s opinion. But the optimum word there is “fan”. I don’t praise any band in these pages that I don’t believe are completely deserving of it; this is Irish Death <strong>Metal</strong> and I honestly believe it has the potential to stand up on the international scale."
