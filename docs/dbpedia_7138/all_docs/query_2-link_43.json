        "text": "In the Mouth of Madness\n\nScorching the Retinas – Special Edition\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness (a collaboration piece)\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness\n\nWritten by Michael de Luca\n\nDirected by John Carpenter\n\nRuntime – 95 minutes\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nShout Factory\n\nThis article sees the sites first collaboration with an artist and a special presentation of their work. In this case Nick – Mr. Sarcophagus (the mind behind and sole proprietor of Drainbow) approached me and asked if I would have interest in featuring a track based on the theme from John Carpenter’s “In the Mouth of Madness”. I jumped at the chance, actually I’m honored to be part of something this huge. Having just reviewed the latest Drainbow album (“Tower of Flints”) I knew I was about to be treated with some quality audio which I couldn’t wait to share.\n\nIt has been twenty-five years since the film was originally released, this has to count for something, right? Obviously, I’d have to reacquaint myself with the movie and perhaps scribble a little nonsense upon it to accompany a “reworking” of the original theme.\n\nWithout further ado a few words from the authors of the audio featured below, Dreambow, who currently consists of;\n\nMr. Sarcophagus (who appears courtesy of Drainbow)\n\ndb (appears courtesy of Dreamhaunt) With an extra special guest appearance by Uncle Abe (who appears courtesy of Revered and Reviled Above Others)\n\n“The 90s were a dark and silly time, and no film embodies that better than John Carpenter’s muddled messianic mess, “In the Mouth of Madness”! Starring the inimitable Sam Neil as a hapless insurance investigator thrown into a story stranger than fiction, this film occupies an interesting space in John Carpenter’s pantheon as his highest budgeted film and one of his least appreciated.\n\nIn these Strange and Unholy times of the Whimpering 20s, we revisit this classic theme and wonder how much brighter our impending and brief future might look if only Sutter Cane had written it!!\n\nDreambow presents: Theme from John Carpenter’s “In the Mouth of Madness”!\n\nhttps://drainbow1.bandcamp.com/\n\nI can’t seriously leave this here without a few words on John Carpenter. His is a name synonymous with horror, be it with his conducting genius or direction. Responsible for such titles as “Halloween” (and a number of subsequent follow ups), “The Fog”, “The Thing”, “They Live”, “Christine” and “Prince of Darkness” as well a handful of films which have made Kurt Russell (“The Thing” included) a household name, his mark upon the genre paved the way for an immeasurable cavalcade of filmmakers to emulate, his influence is palpable and a number of his films have transcended the genre to become a staple of Pop Culture itself.\n\nWho would’ve thought that a William Shatner mask (be it from “Star Trek” or “The Devils Rain” I’m not entirely sure) would be terrorizing Jaime Lee Curtis for the majority of her acting career?\n\nWithout further ado and sans making this an article on the priceless brilliance that is John Carpenter’s work (perhaps another time eh?) May I present my thoughts on…\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness (the title, what a fantastic way to start) commences with an enraged Sam o’ Neill (“Jurassic Park”, “The Omen”) being escorted into a padded room. He struggles, screaming. He flails about and strikes out. “Sorry about the balls”.\n\nThe Head of the same facility is none other than the instantly dislikable weasel (though I’m sure he’s a nice chap in person) Saperstein, John Glover, known for his roles in “Gremlins 2”, “Tales from the Crypt”, “Robocop 2” and “Payback”. It gets better Mr. O’Neil is forced to listen to The Carpenters as he acquaints himself with his dull surroundings. This is, I’m sure, many people’s version of Hell. Dark humor is strong within this.\n\nOminous tones and diabolical brain searing madness shines neon bright early on as Sam (I should probably use his character’s name at this juncture, it’s John Trent) receives a visitor. “This is a rotten way to end it!”\n\nA shadowy figure replies with a chilling “You haven’t even read it yet”.\n\nStandout characters to jog the celluloid memory make appearances as the film rolls onward. David Warner (of “Time Bandits” fame) visits John commenting on his proficiency with a black felt marker and his chances of leaving the institution if he so chooses. John refuses. And is happy to take a seat to recount how his recent movements led him to the predicament he’s in. The disappearance of Sutter Cane and his investigation as to why starts his narrative.\n\nIt all starts with a bang. Literally. A madman with a crazed visage encroaches upon Johns mid-morning meeting with a client, brandishing an ax leading the way. The words “Do you read Sutter Cane” an inkling, perhaps, as to his current state and level of determination.\n\nCharlton Heston (yes, the fellow in “Soilent Green” among many other classics you’d have to …”pry from my cold dead hands”) is the kingpin of the publishing firm responsible for Sutter’s printed work. John soon learns it was Sutter’s agent who tried to remove his limbs earlier as he was sipping his latte. “A guy who outsells King you’d imagine he could pick a better agent?”\n\nHeston is not amused and (John) Trent is still not convinced. Is this merely a dramatic ploy/a publicity stunt to sell more books, are the media also in on it? News coverage depicts a number of stores in which riots are caused due to the book not being in stock when it was promised.\n\nHowever, Cane remains a mystery. His whereabouts are unknown and his productivity is erratic; his newest isn’t in stocks because it hasn’t been finished. Yet. His deadlines aren’t being met and rumors persist that his writing is more than merely fiction or so he’s said to have stated. There’s certainly something going on. People are acting strange, distracted, driven by…something. John, being the curious type (and somewhat of a sleazeball if truth be known) decides to lay eye upon some of Sutter’s work.\n\nAgainst his better judgements and assumption, he admits the style has a flair, a quality which makes it more appealing to that which surrounds it within the same genre. John is somewhat taken aback, but even more so because, it appears, the words have also had an effect on his psyche. He’s starting to have reoccurring dreams (nightmares) in which the details change, transform into a more sinister cloth. An early standout scene is much like an iconic scene from “An American Werewolf in London” but I won’t supply the reasoning as to why that might be the case or ruin the experience.\n\nJohn Trent is shaken, determined to solve the riddle, and manages to somehow fashion a map which he thinks is cute and makes quite the novel contest, perhaps to win an item as limited as say a lunchbox? The map lines up with New Hampshire but the place isn’t mentioned on any map, printed in the last couple of hundred years or so. The proposition (there is one someplace in there amidst a little needling and claims of Publicity related BS) intrigues his employers and he’s soon sent on his merry way to explore his theory.\n\nOn the way John has a companion, the publishing companies most valued editor; Linda Styles (played by Julie Carmen of “Fright Night” part two fame) and some sage advice…”never, never, never throw chips at a driver.” But they are both lost, Hobbs End is nowhere to be found. In between switching off driver duties fatigue sets in. With her vision impaired by tiredness Julie witnesses a young cyclist, this of course isn’t strange other than the fact that it’s pitch-black and then she sees him again, and then again, aged considerably. Hoping for a closer look she runs him down only then to discover he isn’t injured in the slightest and that he has a penchant for wanting to leave. A desire someone has control over, or so his words would attest.\n\nThe driving continues, long into the night. The scenery abruptly changes as too the hour. The pair have found themselves in a strange, alternate, reality. What are our two intrepid heroes going to find in Hobbs End? Is it all just an elaborate hoax to boost sales? What is up with hotelier? Is Sutter Cane slumming it in the Black Church? Questions, queries and mysteries abound.\n\nMy pondering is going to stop here. Rather than deliver a blow by blow (“…down goes Frazier”) I’ll direct my scribbling towards the creation, direction and flow of the movie itself.\n\nBear with me, this might get messy.\n\nAs with many of Carpenter’s films the direction is top-notch with attention given to detail. And plentiful shots where the background is where the attention should be given rather than the focus of the shot itself. The soundtrack adds to the tension applaudably and as with most of Carpenter’s works this is an element which shines contributing depth when required, adding a certain uniqueness which many will instantly recognize as his.\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness is comprised of many elements, factors which may have many thinking upon another of Carpenter’s classics, “The Thing”, based on the otherworldly creature effects incorporated. “Society” by Band and Yuzna is another which depicts transformations akin to that witnessed here, and again the thin veneer of normality and the horrors lurking beneath. Other features may well pop up as one thinks upon the film. “Groundhog Day” for example (for reasons I won’t spill), “Snowflake” a film in which an author controls characters movement as well “Misery” and “The Dark Half” for reasons pertaining to the author themselves and obsession fueled by their prose and imagination.\n\nNaturally this film relies upon that which is rife within the horror realm, that which lies dormant, ever-present and ready to take its rightful place among the ‘ants’. Age old evil and forces unfathomable to the mortal coil as interpreted by Lovecraft have obviously been tackled before, both in music, print and film, and In the Mouth of Madness takes the premise and runs with it utilizing an author whose works have apparently managed, that which most hope for (in part), mind numbing fear, prose which leaves an indelible imprint and obsession to the point of possession. Hopefully, most do not create, akin to Sutter Cane, based on their reality featuring otherworldly forces dictating the nature of the work itself. And for that I’m thankful. In this case however Sutter does and it makes for quite the viewing experience. Honestly one only a few could pull off with quite the same impact. Madness, paranoia, hallucinations and obsession. It’s all here and all wrapped in an Ouroborean package with a tight crimson bow fashioned from the entrails of those who neither read nor consume Sutter Cane’s output.\n\n“Do you read Sutter Cane?”\n\nThe end is coming.\n\nCult\n\nAll proceeds from digital sales on Drainbow’s Bandcamp Friday 11/6 sales will go to benefit Nuci’s Space- an organization dedicated to suicide prevention and providing access to mental healthcare for working musicians- www.nuci.org\n\nAbrasive Audio – Part Thirty -One\n\nLike an ever-flowing stream the onslaught of metal flows ever onward, caressing the ears, delighting the senses and making even the shittiest of day that much better. Did I mention I’m drowning in promos?\n\nForget it. I don’t need your pity, though a helping hand would certainly be appreciated at this point (reach out if you’ve a dark sense of humor, a disdain for politics and have ever felt the urge to compose).\n\nOnward,\n\nEctoplasma- White-Eyed Trance\n\n(Greece)\n\nRelease – October/31/2019\n\nMemento Mori/Repulsive Echo/Caligari Records\n\nhttps://caligarirecords.bandcamp.com/album/white-eyed-trance\n\nARTWORK – 79\n\nIf you go out into the woods tonight (…”you’re in for a big surprise”. Wait wha-!) take a flashlight, a knife and a hooded cloak then, and only then (perhaps), can you join the party. I hear there’s plenty of fun to he had; ritual sacrifice, an orgy with a plethora of enthusiastic octogenarian kultists, a petting zoo (of sorts), Kool-Aid and cookies…with chocolate chips (yum).\n\nFIRST TRACK – 76\n\nA topically themed introduction that comes complete with cawing crows and howling winds quickly transforms into a riotous avalanche of sound; chaotic drums and riffing. An old school aura with groove and a vocal style which will please most with brutal death penchants.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 79\n\nGroove, atmosphere and brutality combine to forge an album draped in familiarity. A death/doom affair, emphasis on death, which overflows with chuggery, melody, riffs which will incite instantaneous grins and an impressive ominous nature rather than all-out brutality. A fantastic introduction to another band who deserve attention within a genre overcrowded with a lack of originality.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Pyschomanteum Immolation, White-Eyed Trance: Choronzonic Covenant, The Oak Spewed Foul Whispers, White-Eyed Trance: Ensnared in Devilry, Souls of Sacrifice (Devastation cover)\n\nFFO; Deicide, Morgoth, Pestilence, Vomitory, Benediction, Asphyx.\n\nHot Breath s/t\n\n(Sweden)\n\nThe Sign Records\n\nRelease – October/18/2019\n\nDewar PR\n\nhttps://hotbreathofficial.bandcamp.com/album/hot-breath\n\nARTWORK – 72\n\nThis screams retro, a photo of what I can only assume is the band, and could well have embellished the cover of an album from thirty years previous.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 92\n\nA whirlwind of synth clears the air for a guitar salvo with an unmistakable air of retro about it. And I’m sold! This is definite rock n roll 70’s worship and as a fan of a plethora of NWOBHM acts the grin plastered across my chops couldn’t possibly be any wider.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 90\n\nHailing from Sweden one might initially think of the HM -2 sound rather than traditional rock n’ roll (thanks to Entombed, Carnage and the like) but all that might be about to change. This is an obvious palette cleanser for those whose interests primarily reside in the extreme but for those who dip their senses in metals roots this delivers all that one could wish. Powerful attitude-laden vocals complement galloping melodies and riffs which harken to an age where denim was king and tassels were an addition one could not be without (Insert memories of finding my parents jackets in the closet when I was but a young lad).\n\nHardly a copycat act this collective are slated to bear the standard of the revival into an age where more of the same (seemingly on repeat) needs to be eradicated at all costs. For most this might qualify as a guilty pleasure, in my case however, I’m proud to support and praise an act who’s worthy of such. Give this a listen but be warned, it’s dangerously and instantaneously addictive.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Still not Dead, Maniac, What you Reap.\n\nFFO; AC/DC, White Spirit, Girlschool, Heart, Screamer, Di’anno fronted Iron Maiden, Jet.\n\nAn impromptu Interruption to take a peek at an official single premiere\n\nBeing of Entropy -Thumos\n\n(Cyprus)\n\nRelease -October/24/2019\n\nhttps://beingofentropy.bandcamp.com/\n\nThoughts –\n\nThe art depicting a heart fashioned from a myriad of twisting serpents leaves me inquisitive. Heavily drenched in Djent, Slam and Deathcore vibes (from the get go), “Thumos” is also undeniably shrouded in atmosphere. Progressive elements appear as if out if nowhere (showcasing a softer vocal approach) and weave in and around the dripping barrage of bludgeoning riffs. As the track progresses mid-tempo riffs become faster, shifting into hyper speed then back again. A background howling vocal effect becomes part of the background and adds an undeniable aura to (what many might consider) typical deathcore elements towards the track’s finale making for a climax which leaves me curious, especially since I normally don’t traverse genre waters of this type too often, and eager for any surprises an upcoming full-length might provide.\n\n79\n\nBack to the Regularly Scheduled Programming\n\nGévaudan – ITER\n\n(United Kingdom)\n\nRelease – October/4/2019\n\nIndependent\n\nhttps://gevaudan.bandcamp.com/album/iter\n\nARTWORK – 74\n\nBlack and white imagery depicts a two-headed bird against a stark full moon. A closer look, however, and one can see the bird has a certain duality about it; half flesh and half bone. A clever touch which only makes me ponder upon the nature of the music itself.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 92\n\nHypnotic, traditional, acoustic melodies ease the listener into the album. Combined with a soothing vocal approach the effect is mesmerizing. Even when the style suddenly shifts (drenched in distortion and ominous qualities) the tracks allure strangely remains captivating. The lyrics (as well their delivery) combined with the coalescing mood, spanning various doom landscapes, make for an experience one will want to explore again and again.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 95\n\nMuch like the fabled French beast the band has named themselves after this also has the inane ability the consume. In this case however, it’s the listener, and not the unfortunate who has stumbled upon the beasts hunting grounds, and they aren’t cowering in fear but rather in absolute awe as the audio here washes over their unprepared senses. Channeling a myriad of styles from as far afield as stoner rock, folk and Gothic rock with a varied landscape of doom in-between Gévaudan have meticulously crafted a collection of songs boasting undeniable fluidity which possess the power to cast a spell, a unfathomably huge web of appeal, upon all who choose to lay ears upon it. Whether your listening habits lay in retro 70’s doom or the more update showcasing a mixture of death and doom or the melancholic and/or atmospheric this holds a vast trove of treasures to be excited about. Soaring, sweeping, riffs, a plethora of textures to whisk the listener away, distorted soundscapes, a narrative which warrants opening the lyric booklet alongside a spot of research and a diverse vocal delivery which hits then obliterates ‘the spot’. This about has it all and I can’t for the life of me wonder why it isn’t spoken about often and loudly, perhaps the end of year lists will change that. Mine will!\n\nFavorite Tracks; This is another example of an album with zero filler. This dominates the attention from start to finish with its utter unmitigated brilliance.\n\nFFO; My Dying Bride, Spirit Adrift, Candlemass, Black Sabbath, Lord Weird Slough Feg.\n\nVultur – Drowned in Gangrenous Blood\n\n(Greece)\n\nRelease – October/31/2019\n\nMemento Mori\n\nhttps://vultur.bandcamp.com/ (note; this isn’t the release under scrutiny, as of this publication I could not locate it on Bandcamp)\n\nARTWORK – 74\n\nIt’s not the sharks you have to keep an eye for in this body of water…It’s the bodies!\n\nFIRST TRACK – 75\n\nA surging bulldozer approach sporting dirge quality, old school leanings, groove passages and atmosphere. A good start to get the attention.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 73\n\nOne would only have to look at the track titles to get an idea of what they’re about to jump into. And this presumption isn’t that far off; this channels Cannibal Corpse qualities throughout. Rhythms are pummeling, bludgeoning, even at times mischievous and the overall quality doesn’t disappoint for those demanding ‘more of the same’. For those yearning audio that’s draped in technical and progressive elements this is a location offering sparse elements of each but for those needing something between melody and brutality this will hit the spot.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Drowned in Gangrenous Blood, Crushing the Ribcage, Postmortem Lividity.\n\nFFO; Deeds of Flesh, Malevolent Creation, Cannibal Corpse.\n\nInterrupting the Flow of the regular Broadcast to take a Peek at a “Split”\n\nTreasonist/ Y-Incision (Split) – Mechanical Perdition\n\nHorror Pain Gore Death Productions\n\nRelease – November/22/2019\n\nClawhammer PR\n\nhttps://y-incision1.bandcamp.com/\n\nARTWORK – 81\n\nAn intricate black and white image (old school European thrash in aura) vividly depicts the suffering that most post-a-selfie-a-minute millennials are worthy.\n\nTreasonist (USA) – (tracks 7 – 13)\n\nhttps://treasonistgrind.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nPunishing grindcore sensibilities are accentuated by ever-evolving and amorphic, technical, brutal death, rhythm passages. The vocal approach is varied and successfully tops off an assault which fans of Napalm Death, Misery Index and Terrorizer are sure to salivate over.\n\n82\n\nFavorite Tracks; Chemically Silenced, Spiteful Tongues Condemn, A Moment is the Most you can Expect from Perfection.\n\nY-Incision (USA) – (tracks 1 – 6)\n\nhttps://y-incision1.bandcamp.com/album/disasturbator\n\nThe sense of humor is undeniable here as too a style which incorporates all manner of extreme “cores” (thankfully not death, emo or math) in their titles starting with Grind with the addition of other elements to keep the listener at odds with what to mention as influence. Frenetic and frenzied leaving barely a second to catch a breather this is stylistically chaotic though tighter than a Nuns nether region. Sure, to place a smile on the face of fans whose penchants are firmly rooted in audio which is akin to watching television at a considerably faster pace than is normal and/or recommended.\n\n76\n\nFavorite Tracks; Lunaticus; A Vitruvian’s Tale Signifying Nothing, Snowflake Tears as Lube, Leech of Pity.\n\nOverall – 79\n\nNote: a spin on the traditional split. Each band here does a cover of one of the others tracks not heard here.\n\nBack to the Regular Broadcast…\n\nTemple ov Perversion s/t (EP)\n\n(Switzerland)\n\nRelease – October/18/2019\n\nClavis Secretorvm\n\nhttps://clavisecretorvm.bandcamp.com/album/temple-ov-perversion-temple-ov-perversion\n\nARTWORK – 73\n\nThanks fellas, now I have what many might consider the first pornographic image on the site. Although jaded this boasts certain vintage qualities, as well underworld qualities (as seen by the imps in attendance and creatures which warrant closer inspection to define). And the fact that I’ve just noticed that the one ‘impaled’ is sans arms and that the perpetrators face is malformed means that my attention is juvenile and drawn to the obvious before all else.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 71\n\nThe introduction is an instrumental which more than hints at an album draped in a myriad of styles. A traditional heavy metal vibe here is strong as well elements of thrash/speed and an underlying dark atmosphere with a medieval vibe.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 76\n\nThis is not what I’d expected based on the introduction, admittedly it’s closer to the albums accompanying art. Herein is a style which is draped in rhythm (damn catchy rhythms at that, sporting surprising groove passages) albeit slathered in black values. Accompanied by a vocal style which is decidedly black in tone (traditional) the whole affair is draped in a menacing aura and atmosphere occasionally shot through with shrieks and howls (which hint at Avant Garde influence). Riff breaks, far from the normal unrelenting assault, are a welcome addition and show an act who aren’t afraid to stray from the traditional genre template. Black metal with elements of speed metal, although to be sure it’s fast enough as it is, the occasional nod to tradition metal with moments of dramatic vocal gymnastics this is far from the norm but is wholly consumable without complaint. Surprise your senses and toss this between the ears it’s a damn sight more impressive than you might think.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Arrival ov the Horns, Temple ov Perversion.\n\nFFO; My apologies, I’m at a loss for whom to mention here. Step outside of the comfort zone and give this a listen, dammit!\n\nHour of Penance – Misotheism\n\n(Italy)\n\nRelease – October/25/2019\n\nAgonia Records\n\nhttps://agoniarecords.bandcamp.com/album/misotheism\n\nARTWORK – 90\n\nThis is dark, Gothic and ominous indeed. Great colors and details. Are there tendrils/tentacles surging from the cathedral? Are the amassed crowds drenched in offal and crimson? Something is certainly stirring in the distance above the monstrous construct. Best grab a brolly, and best not to forget the tank. Prepare to put that bitch into four-wheel drive we be about to trample some unfortunates!\n\nFIRST TRACK – 90\n\nTechnical, yet not overly so, unrelenting yet not so much as to be suffocating and accompanied by an inhuman drum salvo. This is a fantastic combination; did I mention the vocals are top notch? Nope, they are and this is an ultra-impressive commencement.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 92\n\nUnmerciful in its approach and unrelenting in its salvo; this is what death metal is all about (there are all manner of sub genres, the list expands by the day, but I believe this to be the purist strain). Boasting zero progressive passages and sporting unerring brutality; intricate in its composition from start to finish. Drenched in speed, but not merely for speeds sake, and an atmosphere complemented by undeniable majesty which places it perilously close to the darker side of the metal spectrum. I can honestly say this grabbed me from the get-go and caressed the space between my ears with loving punishment whilst creating a visage splitting smirk from ear to ear (I could probably star as the next Joker if I didn’t suffer from the curse of being absolute crap at most everything I try my hands at) until its finale.\n\nI hate to admit that this is the first Hour of Penance album to really grab me. With that in mind I’m sure there are others and with the quality of this in mind I’ll make it a point of exploring their discography until I can decide I should probably go back to work, or family duties. I’ve heard word that most are excellent, perhaps I just wasn’t in the right mood at the time? Don’t be like me, give this a listen and dwell in absolute audio brilliance. Add this to your collection and support an act who are worthy of such. Suffice it to say this delivers and demands praise, here’s hoping I’m helping it along that path.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Blight and Conquer, Lamb of the Seven Sins, Flames of Merciless Gods, Iudex,\n\nFFO; Origin, Suffocation, Nile, Deeds of Flesh, Abysmal Dawn, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Hideous Divinity.\n\nTime for an Old Favorite; “RECC’d by”\n\nRecc’d by RYCHUSSYN @gregorywjkelly on Twitter\n\nPaladin – Purification du Mal\n\n(Canada)\n\nRelease – September/20/2019 (note: the Bandcamp page mentions both July/20 and September/20)\n\nPRC Music\n\nhttps://prcmusic.bandcamp.com/album/paladin-purification-du-mal-cd\n\nThoughts –\n\nWith art which depicts Seraphim obliterating serpents I’m left wondering what manner of audio I’m about to lay my ears upon. Is this power metal, epic or otherwise? Does it have religious connotations? Only one way to find out…\n\nFor starters, this certainly isn’t power, epic or even close to traditional heavy metal and I don’t believe it has anything to do with religion (one-way or another) though I could be mistaken, this is in a language I’m unfamiliar with much to the chagrin of my high school French teacher. It is however, mired in a gutter nature, catacomb values and an old school influence so cloying you can virtually smell it. Not to be confused with the Prosthetic act with the same name this Quebecian (am I saying that correctly?) collective stray far from thrash waters, also progressive and technical landscapes, much preferring to camp out in a terrain which is unmistakably treacherous and drenched in an ominous aura. Theirs is a style whose influence is familiar yet varied, from past (the old school here is strong young Padawan) and from more recent acts who have chosen to resurrect that which is tried and true and have added their own flair for an unarguable degree of success and acclaim. The pace showcased here is sluggish, and only occasionally treads into faster currents. The groove permeates throughout, is wickedly strong and one wouldn’t be remiss in wanting to prance around like one possessed whilst this slithers its way through the brain. Surprising are moments when the vocalist adds grunts and enunciation perhaps in homage to Celtic Frost. But, hey, it works and although one might be left scrambling for acts who sound like this (I know I am, my memory is schiite at the best of times) there’s no doubt that Paladin know how to compose to grab the attention of those yearning for a spot of putrid old school with a fresh twist. Check this out and support an act who more than worthy of your attention.\n\nRecc’d by Void @voidhanger2 on Twitter\n\nVerdugo – Altar Del Rencor\n\n(Chile)\n\nRelease – July/16/2017\n\nNo Mercy Reks\n\nhttps://verdugometal.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nThoughts –\n\nRecently my knowledgeable pal Void tossed me a Recc which I couldn’t find in its entirety, so I chose to tackle an earlier release by the same band instead. Much to my surprise and excitement the original Recc is now up and in full. With the quality of the last in mind I couldn’t wait to take the plunge so without further preamble…\n\nFirst off, I must mention that this sports some of the finest black and white art I’ve seen in recent months. The stone altar, the skulls, the details on all of which are superb. And the depth of texture to the surrounding walls. Just brilliance.\n\nThe music itself is raw. But don’t let this fool you. It lends an edge to the style, as in this case I believe polished would feel out if place. The order of the day here is thrash, not just that but undeniable blackened values too. And it works! The concoction is criminally infectious in fact. Combined with vocals which sound as if they were recorded in a cavernous surrounding the effect is one which drips venom (not the band, nor ‘Spidey’s’ most infamous of foe), an air of underworld which the word macabre doesn’t quite touch. Naturally, lyrics sang in the bands native tongue help the music’s archaic qualities and the composition certainly aids in the same regard. Mischievous and galloping melodies are often part of the assault and serve to break up the unrelenting speed laden salvos. Bearing a decidedly South American aggressive thrash aura set against darkened values this is an album fans of the scene need to make time for. Toss them a few bucks in support to ensure they can continue to delight the senses; I’ve heard rumor something new is in the works. Fingers crossed.\n\nWell, that’s about it for this shorter than normal installment, I’ve attempted to make this more diverse than most on account of its length hoping there was something for most everyone. Until our audio paths of interest cross again, don’t fear discovery of that which would normally be foreign to the senses.\n\nCult\n\nAbrasive Audio (Part twenty – eight)\n\nThe juggernaut of metal rolls on, unstoppable, crushing everything and everyone in its path. In other news my Inbox is overflowing and I’ve just returned from a vacation. I guess it’s about time to don the suggested attire in order that I dive right back in. Damn, this suit is tight! I’m guessing gaining weight and vacations go hand in hand. Sans further, obvious, observations which have very little to do with the audio under scrutiny…\n\nTorpor – Rhetoric of the Image\n\n(UK)\n\nRelease – September/20/2019\n\nTruthseeker Music/Sludgelord Records/ Moment of Collapse Records/Smith’s Food Group/Medusa Crush Recordings\n\nDewar PR\n\nhttps://thesludgelord.bandcamp.com/album/rhetoric-of-the-image\n\nARTWORK – 72\n\nUnless one had knowledge of what this image is or what it may mean they might be confused, I am. But after learning of a Japanese art which restores beauty to the broken through a process which includes materials one might not expect one might have an idea of where the music might lead. Or one can only assume. Hitting play…\n\nFIRST TRACK – 82\n\nHere’s one hell of an opener! Both brutally crushing yet shot through with passages of undeniable beauty. An audio journey which drags the listener from mammoth distortion saturated riff sludge laden depths through cinematic plains drenched in minimalistic tones and then back under again. An epic trip to say the least. Wholly unpredictable and quite unlike what one might initially expect. I’m impressed and eager for more!\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 83\n\nAmbient, nuanced and soundtrack-esque in scope though utterly absorbing and captivating this is hardly what one could/would or should consider ‘run-of-the-mill’ but rather an immersive experience. A bass driven doom/sludge hybrid, a temperamental beast against a dystopian, apocalyptic soundscape which demands respect and attention. Suffocating in times, harsh in others, yet wholly enveloping throughout this runs varied depths of sparked emotion leaving the listener dazed, enlightened, bludgeoned and overwhelmed but yet strangely, in moments, oddly relaxed. Dive in and discover for yourself why this album is not to be missed!\n\nFavorite Tracks; Benign Circle, Enigmatic Demand, Mourning the Real.\n\nFFO; Nuerosis, Isis, Boris, The Ocean.\n\nProfanation – Into Cascades of Blood and Burning Soil\n\n(Germany)\n\nRelease -April/26/2019\n\nHostile Media\n\nhttps://profanation.bandcamp.com/album/into-cascades-of-blood-and-burning-soil\n\nAgainst PR\n\nARTWORK – 84\n\nThe Pope, “Jesus” with a demonical look upon his visage (who yields a hatchet rather than a fish), a sacrificial offering, demons in the smoke and a city burning to the ground, is that Hitler in the background? Awesome art which leaves little to the imagination regarding what to expect. There’s no sparkles and unicorns to be found here folks!\n\nFIRST TRACK – 80\n\nA spoken word introduction alongside ominous, powerful, riffs open the scene. A prophecy talking of an Apocalypse and rebirth. Fading to black this is replaced by a Cannibal Corpse-esque approach (hints of technicality) and tone aided by a wicked thrash aura the stage is set for an album which should invoke a few grins, incite impressive ‘pit’ activity and snap a fair few necks as it plays out (if this is any indication of what’s to follow).\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 75\n\nShowcasing breakdowns, groove, galloping thrash pacing and an approach hinting at technical leaning and influence the nine tracks here show definite promise and a delicate balance which works well. Undeniable is that Profanation are an act who know how to compose and create tracks with a proven formula and an air of familiarity to garner interest. My only qualms are that a few tracks could be shorter, for much the same effect, and that although commendable and pleasing to most, this unfortunately isn’t a style which breaks any new ground.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Into Cascades of Blood and Burning Soil, Bloodbath in Heaven, Unholy Brutality Unleashed, A Place to Pray.\n\nFFO; Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation.\n\nByzanthian Neckbeard – Extinction (EP)\n\n(Guernsey)\n\nRelease – September/27/2019\n\nIndependent\n\nDewar PR\n\nhttps://byzanthianneckbeard.bandcamp.com/album/extinction\n\nARTWORK – 60\n\nPrimitive yet blunt and to the point. An image which showcases what I can only assume to be a large mass/rock (?) colliding with ‘something’ resulting in obvious devastating effect.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 73\n\nDoom with considerable pace and weight complemented by growling vox and significant groove. I could move to this!\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 73\n\nNothing here in the way of technical rhythms or anything complex in the slightest but these tunes are so seductively addictive that one cares not one iota. Death/doom, groove/doom call this what you will, but there’s no doubt whatsoever that this is infectious audio. Three tracks are way too short; this only leave me wanting more (which thankfully comes by way of “Minator” on November/1st and it can’t come fast enough!)\n\nFavorite Tracks; Coffin Bomb, Extinction.\n\nFFO; Mid-era Pungent Stench, Doom with undeniable groove qualities with a darker than normal vocal accompaniment.\n\nXoth – Interdimensional Invocations\n\n(USA)\n\nRelease – October/18/2019\n\nSelf-Released\n\nClawhammer PR\n\nhttps://xoth.bandcamp.com/\n\nARTWORK – 91\n\n“I asked for extra meat on my pizza, but a small city will suffice”. Seriously, who do I tip for this amount of generosity. Humans are delicious!”\n\nHumor and Sci-fi elements collide in this comic book-esque imagery. If the audio is as impressive the listener is in for a treat!\n\nFIRST TRACK – 89\n\nThrashy death with technical and progressive elements draped in maniacal values. An injection of well-executed Lovecraftian horror and sci-fi result in this holding the attention throughout.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 91\n\nInfectious melodies, technical intricacies and progressive passages combine with a soundscape that’s part brutal death, part technical and slightly traditional metal in tone add to this lyrical content slathered in cosmic elements and a little levity and the result is a release which (if there’s any justice) should garner a great deal of attention. The shredding quotient in this is damn impressive the style dynamic yet diverse, suffice to say this releases appeal has the potential to turn a great many heads. With this quality in offer I’m surprised this is the first I’ve heard of Xoth (I expect that to change very soon). Highly recommended and did I mention criminally addictive?\n\nFavorite Tracks; Exceptional quality throughout, I refuse to pick a few to mention.\n\nFFO; Death, Pestilence, Abysmal Dawn, Aborted.\n\nA Break in the Regular Schedule for “Something Completely Different”\n\nWitchwood – Litanies from the Woods\n\n(Italy)\n\nRelease – May/4/2015\n\nJolly Roger Records\n\nhttps://jolly-roger-records.bandcamp.com/album/litanies-from-the-woods\n\nARTWORK – 79\n\nOne might have immediate assumptions based on the music with this image in mind, it’s dangerously close to what one might expect to find on an atmospheric doom-laden black release. I’ll ruin it, because I’ve perused the promotional materials, this isn’t in any way extreme audio. I’m intrigued, let’s move on.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 80\n\nSouthern ‘easy’ groove with a decidedly Cosmic tinged edged introduction leads into ‘Zeppelin’ esque melodies with ‘Skynard’ and vintage ‘Priest’ undertones. Toss in alternate instruments, keyboards and a definite seventies feel and you have a track which exhibits a myriad of influence. This isn’t what I normally place betwix the ears but I’m finding it difficult not to appreciate the audio on offer.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 86\n\nSoulful, passionate, laden with folk elements, remarkable presence (by way of acoustic brilliance and melodies which bring to mind times of yore and banquets in a forest setting featuring an eye-popping cleavage motif) and huge seventies rock influence this offers epic soundscapes to lose yourself within and a vocalist whose range and skill are a fantastic accompaniment. Certainly, far from what I usually lay my thoughts upon this offers audio which an open mind can easily embrace especially when there’s a little smoke in the air and in the system (if you catch my drift. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge). Fans of early prog rock, hard rock and alternate (vintage) heavy metal will most probably grin as the acts undeniable talent works its way through the senses. As a huge fan of vintage Rainbow this hits the spot whilst also offering enough rhythmic and stylistic variety to entice discovery of similar releases from around the same time (with the same label attached) which I’ve yet to give the time of day to. Naturally this isn’t for everyone but for those whose tastes run to the acts mentioned below this will serve to lighten the mood and spark interest in an act who are more than worthy of the attention.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Shade of Grey, Farewell to the Ocean Boulevard, A Place for the Sun, Golden King\n\nFFO; Jethro Tull, Lord Weird Slough Feg, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Allman Bros Band, Dio fronted Rainbow.\n\nGhost:Hello – Sound of Color in Space\n\n(USA)\n\nRelease – September/20/2019\n\nSelf-Released\n\nDewar PR\n\nhttps://ghosthello.bandcamp.com/album/the-sound-of-color-in-space\n\nARTWORK – 80\n\nEither that Octopus is emitting fumes or those astronauts have been dining at a dubious intergalactic establishment and are experiencing the unprecedented after-effects. Is that a ‘space taco’ in the foreground? Who else is thinking Douglas Adams and/or “Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy”?\n\nFIRST TRACK – 70\n\nCosmic bells introduce the album and the stoner rock infused with definite psychedelia undertones which follow. Synth blanketing melodic stoner rock/doom sans vocals at this time.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – n/a\n\nIf the track listing alone isn’t enough to inform you that you’re about to enter into surreals-ville then perhaps the album’s title or art will. This album is (to put it bluntly) an exercise in how much diversity one can handle in an album. Tracks dipped in angst are side by side with others undeniably the opposite. Spoken word soundbite affairs drenched in synth accompanied by a drum beat percussion and others displaying more a Marilyn Manson aura with crawling pace. A Cosmic vibe permeates the whole affair, varied vocal aesthetics and experimental effects are commonplace resulting in a listening experience for the brave, those with a taste for the off the beaten path, an album, to be blunt, many might not be able to fully consume. An eclectic taste for sure much like cinematic output which begs to be dissected and discussed. To be honest this isn’t suited to my tastes though I can understand how it might appeal to those who yearn for more in their sensorial consumption.\n\nFavorite Tracks; The Mouth of the Gift Horse, Poison Swan.\n\nFFO; The more theatrical rather than audio which delivers instant gratification.\n\nAnd, Returning to the Regular Broadcast\n\nNetherbird – Into the Vast Uncharted\n\n(Sweden)\n\nRelease – September/27/2019\n\nEisenwold\n\nCarcosa PR\n\nhttps://netherbird.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-vast-uncharted\n\nARTWORK – 80\n\nClassic imagery (known as “Älvalek” to those in ‘art circles’) depicting a tranquil landscape at dusk. A ‘familiar’ setting yet not so much in this light, this is otherworldly showcasing a parade of spirits frolicking, cavorting, in a realm many might consider they have an intimate knowledge of. Perhaps this isn’t the case at all. This leaves me curious as to the audio itself.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 87\n\nA thunderous mix of melody and blacked death with unexpected passages bringing to mind stylistic elements one might not expect additions which elevate this far above the jostling genre hordes. A fantastic introduction to the band and a unique spin on a genre which is fast becoming overcrowded\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 88\n\nRather than rely upon symphonic accompaniment Netherbird accentuate their audio with, among other things, sweeping, passionate, melodies. An element far removed from what one might expect in a traditional melodic death outing; a pigeonhole in which this act doesn’t comfortably reside. It is this touch which shrouds the release at just the right moment in exquisite emotion. A stunning companion to the other stylistic elements found throughout resulting in an album which instantly makes an impression and only grows the more it’s allowed to caress the senses. A remarkable invocation of the blackened death style crafted with precision showcasing passionate guitar leads, acoustic brilliance and sweeping evocative melodies. A veil of doom, a definite well-executed presence, accentuates the palpable emotion throughout making for a release one will only want to experience again and again.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Harvest the Stars, Eventide Evangel, Obsidian White, Nexus of Unlight.\n\nFFO; Dissection, Stortregn, Vagrant, October’s Tide, Be’lakor, Swallow the Sun.\n\nUnfathomable Ruination – Enraged and Unbound\n\n(United Kingdom)\n\nRelease – November/22/2019\n\nWillowtip Records\n\nClawhammer PR\n\nhttps://unfathomableruination.bandcamp.com/album/enraged-unbound\n\nARTWORK – 90\n\nA tad reminiscent of Cannibal Corpse’s “The Bleeding” this image showcases manifested demons resulting from all manner of emotion. A rendition which is certainly striking.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 88\n\nWicked adrenaline spiking rhythms, plentiful timing changes, groove and a vocal style which will place a grin on any genre fans face and all within a package which incorporates Slam, technical brutal death and grindcore elements. I wasn’t expecting audio of this caliber to be honest, it’s difficult not to be suitably impressed.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 85\n\nRegardless of whether one believes these guys to be Britain’s answer to (Americas) Misery Index or (Frances) Benighted there’s little doubt that they play with blazing intent, exhibit stunning talent and know how to strike a chord (pun) with fans and new listeners alike (it’s my first time. Be gentle and please don’t put it ‘there’). Track structures, although longer than most in the same genre, are infectiously contagious showcasing abrupt pace transformations, frenzied and maniacal moments and technicality the likes of which precariously straddles the fence between technical death and grindcore arenas, occasional Slam and infrequently progressive realms, though rarely dwells for too long in one forum. In short, this audio depicts an act who have no desire to fuck around. It’s straight down to business and these guys are bringing all the requisite ingredients to make a lasting impression, albeit one which will leave a mark whose after effects will require meds and most probably a trip to the ER. Limber up before this one folks!\n\nFavorite Tracks; An Obsidian Perception, Enraged and Unbound, Maniacal Disillusion, Protoplasmic Imprisonment.\n\nFFO; Misery Index, Dying Fetus, Ingested, Benighted.\n\nAggressive Perfector – Havoc at the Midnight Hour\n\n(UK)\n\nRelease – November/22/2019\n\nDying Victims Productions\n\nhttps://dyingvictimsproductions.bandcamp.com/album/aggressive-perfector-havoc-at-the-midnight-hour\n\nARTWORK – 82\n\nThis screams adoration of cult European genre celluloid. Guts worn as neck adornment, a wild-eyed man of the cloth wielding an ax, a barely dressed maiden witnessing a mansion go up in flames (as if it’s an everyday event) and front and center a visage engulfed in an undeniable possessed motif. Be it Fulci, D’Amato or Bava there’s undeniable similarities afoot which have grabbed my attention.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 77\n\nDraped in a style plucked screaming from the early eighties (metal scene) this is neither speed, thrash nor anything instantly appearing to fit comfortably in any extreme genre by today’s standards, but it is an intriguing concoction complete with a vocal style that makes an impression which is neither traditional nor harsh (think death, black metal and grindcore) for those who need an act for comparison think a more melodic Venom for it nears a similar raw tone and style.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 75\n\nThe similarities to a (bonus) Slayer track end at the title alone, this is decidedly more heavy metal in tone with complementing sides of diabolical speed and blackened values. Channeling melodies of a ‘Maiden’ and Blitzkrieg ilk and unarguable NWOBHM stylings this is certainly not for everyone. But for those with a penchant for the acts mentioned this is a great album harkening to the ground-breakers within the scene (whose influence is still heavily commented upon even in today’s heavy hitters) yet charged with attitude and a vocal style closer to that sported by Cronos (Venom).\n\nFavorite Tracks; Chains of Black Wrath, Into the Nightmare, Vengeful One,\n\nFFO; Raven, Venom, Judas Priest, Exciter, Dokken, early Bathory.\n\nZarraza (meaning “infection” or “unbearable person” in Russian) – Rotten Remains\n\n(Kazakhstan)\n\nRelease – November/29/2019\n\nSelf-Released\n\nDewar PR\n\nhttps://zarraza.bandcamp.com/\n\nARTWORK – 72\n\nAn undead type (which appears to be a Mummy of one type or another in this instance) doused in glow in the dark green nuclear liquid (complete with fallout mask) although this has been done many a time before I’m left, nevertheless, curious as to what audio lies within.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 73\n\nDriving rhythms, shifting tempos and gruff vocals, a style which is perilously close to brutal death territories though remains firmly attached to the extreme thrash arena. An intriguing style which incorporates familiar influences, the origins of which I haven’t quite figured out just yet.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 73\n\nHuge props first off to the band who’ve persevered through various difficulties and the hardships their geographical location affords them in order that this might grace our ears. Obviously, when one discusses metal (in any way, shape or form) the location of Kazakhstan rarely, if ever, appears in the same sentence, unless of course Sasha Cohen has donned another disguise if only to cover an unlikely track under the moniker of “Borat” (this might not be so strange seems as goats, I’ve heard they are commonplace in the area are associated largely with a specific genre of extreme audio) This however, might soon change. This is dynamic audio, multi genre styled and angst ridden, familiar yet refreshing but better yet delightfully more polished than what one might expect. If you enjoy audio from any of the bands listed (below) in the FFO section by all means give this a listen your interest will be perked just in time for fresh material which (fingers crossed) should be released in the near future.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Grudge, Chaos, wRRong Song.\n\nFFO; Hatebreed, modern Sepultura, Pantera, Machine Head.\n\nBody Harvest – Parasitic Slavery\n\n(United Kingdom)\n\nRelease – May/3/2019\n\nComatose Music\n\nImperative PR\n\nhttps://comatosemusic.bandcamp.com/album/parasitic-slavery\n\nARTWORK – 81\n\nRabid, werewolf/alien hybrid in appearance, alien’s intent on cosmic domination by way of putting people in pods and draining their life force (or something along those lines). I have the feeling this has been done before, under many guises. But I’m diggin’ it. Hitting play.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 82\n\nUnrelenting and straight for the throat audio. Diabolical and unmerciful this is a tsunami of sound which is menacing, Sci- fi laden and all-consuming in its intensity. Do I have your interest yet? I should, this is quality stuff.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 85\n\nDevoid of frilly bits, progressive interludes and moments of reflection this is primal death metal shrouded in technical prowess sporting an intensity which is palpable. Utilizing an all-out approach (for the most part) Body Harvest have somehow managed to create an album which is mesmerizing in its undeniable brutality. A rare feat far removed from ‘harsh noise’ realms the audio herein boasts maniacal values, diabolical surges, pummeling salvos and moments of ear screeching (controlled) chaos (excellently placed to provide added atmosphere and depth) as well apocalyptic heights. A fantastic combination which somehow flows exquisitely and is all bathed in delicious dirge qualities fellow countrymen Bolt Thrower would be jealous of (if they were still “grinding”) Funfact; this is from Bristol, not Birmingham. Void states (for the record; his metal knowledge is far superior than anyone else’s I know of) that this is Morbid Angel worship taken to the extreme and mentions the band Eskhaton also.\n\nIntrigued? I’d be surprised if you weren’t. This audio floored me with its stellar caliber and though it’s a little off-center from what I normally place between the ears I’ll admit it floored me. Highly Recommended!\n\nFavorite Tracks; Hierarchy of Grief, Consumed by Tyrants, Darkness Descends, Apocalyptic Abomination.\n\nFFO; Nile, Hate Eternal, Krisiun, Immolation, Vader, Eskhaton.\n\nThe Flaying – Angry, Undead\n\n(Canada)\n\nRelease – March/2019\n\nPRC Music\n\nAsher PR\n\nhttps://theflaying.bandcamp.com/album/angry-undead\n\nARTWORK – 78\n\nChaos, carnage, crimson and the marauding undead what more could you ask for upon a metal release, seriously?\n\nFIRST TRACK – 83\n\nAudio from what could well be a torture porn opus kicks this album off and it quickly transforms into go-for-the-throat riffage a mix of black and technical death complemented by a vocal style which most every fan of the scene will instantly be able to appreciate. Just me, or does anyone else hear slight Nuclear Assault (“Handle with Care” era) and or Xentrix (“For Whose Advantage”) riffage here. This isn’t in anyway a complaint, not in the slightest, merely an observation. A great start. Hold my calls!\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 82\n\nThis release about has it all! There are progressive passages (bringing to mind, in instances, Atheist and Cynic) technical prowess (with enough bass presence to leave fans of the instrument salivating), enough breakdowns to please the Slam crowd, groove to keep those limbs a flailing. Also, brutality and melody in equal measure, a delicate balance. More exciting yet is that the production is top-notch and the compositions are intricately curated with zero moments which appear ‘out of place’ or awkward in their place and setting. The bass is accentuated more than is usually heard within the genre adding considerable weight to the rhythms and drive to the tracks structure. Overall, for a debut this is stunning offering considerably more than any debut is expected to.\n\nThe horizon looks bright indeed if this is any indication of what’s to follow.\n\nHighly recommended and deserved of a nomination for Quebec GAMIQ (“Gala alternatif de la musique indépendante du Québec”) Awards “Metal Album of The Year” and “Artist of The Year”.\n\nFavorite Tracks – Disloque, Genuflect, Elegy of Emptiness, Angry, Undead.\n\nFFO; Benighted, The Black Dahlia Murder, Suffocation, Archspire, Pestilence, Alterbeast, Ingested.\n\nAtomic Cretins – Spiritual Cancer\n\n(USA)\n\nRelease – October/26/2019\n\nSuicide Bong Tapes\n\nQabar PR\n\nhttps://atomiccretins.bandcamp.com/album/spiritual-cancer\n\nARTWORK – 76\n\nThere’s a fire in the Basilica and corpse painted musicians from Norway are nowhere in sight. Is this an alternate reality, or is there mutiny amongst the upper echelon of the holy?\n\nFIRST TRACK – 77\n\nRaunchy audio, groove (think early Exodus in a blender with crust anarchists Disrupt) and blackened rasped vocals are introduced by introductory instrumental passages (by way of old school crossover thrash) and soundbites which state that which everyone should already know.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 79\n\nMid-tempo old-school thrash values and plentiful groove collide with crust and extreme punk attitude resulting in a filthy listening experience which is surprisingly infectious. This isn’t what I was expecting but it woke me up and put considerable oomph/get-up-and-get-em’ in my morning.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Out of the Coffin, Spiritual Cancer.\n\nFFO; Hellripper, Wraith, Bastardizer, Disrupt.\n\nA brief look at singles and/or ‘Official track premieres’\n\nInfected Dead -The Rache\n\n(United Kingdom)\n\nRelease – September/27/2019\n\nHostile Media\n\nFuture PR\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw4-5mkqVdA\n\nThoughts –\n\nWithin the last couple of years, I’ve been fortunate to be able to review this act’s last release. It actually featured on my ‘best of’ year-end list in account of its fluidity and all-round eye-opening brilliance. But then, nothing. I honestly it could be the end, but I was hoping it wasn’t. I needed more. Then from out of the blue, an email, a summons, a spark of hope. Infected Dead are back! They had a single and wanted me to share my thoughts upon it. I pondered for a moment, then went on vacation, then went back to my day job then remembered that I couldn’t forget. And now here I am sharing the video (above) in support of the new audio.\n\nFor those who need an introduction here’s a link to their eye-opening full length\n\nhttps://hostilemedia.bandcamp.com/album/archaic-malevolence\n\nThe first thing to strike the senses is that this has rhythm, riffs with instant effect (this far in I’m glad to report that the act haven’t lost any of their previous brilliance) and atmosphere. The vocals do naught but complement the percussion. And then, part way through, technicality and progressive elements yank control away from the infectious, inciteful, rhythms. This isn’t at all a complaint as it works alongside the atmosphere (which isn’t at all overpowering but rather only makes itself known in the most opportune of instances to add weight) and serves to add depth and presence to a track which already has the full attention. As “Rache” comes to a climax the symphonic shroud is ramped up to take on more of a darker tone and dominance. A fantastic conclusion to a track which again introduces Lovecraftian elements to the listener and only leaves me salivating, rather than hoping, for a future full length. And if it’s to be anything near the quality of the last, “Archaic Malevolence”, then I can foresee myself travelling to the nearest peak to shout its praise.\n\nSuffice it to say I am suitably impressed and ecstatic that this band are back.\n\n#BestofBritishMetal\n\nAnd… the Reccd’ segment is back (it’s about time!)\n\nReccd by He11fir3\n\n1349 – Hellfire\n\n(Norway)\n\nRelease – October/2005\n\nCandlelight Records\n\nhttps://candlelightrecordsuk.bandcamp.com/album/hellfire\n\nThoughts –\n\nIn recent weeks I’ve started to tackle laying thoughts upon singles and/or ‘official track premiers’ naturally the inclusion all depends on whether I can find the time to do so. Of the very first ones I laid to the site 1349 was one of the acts featured. Following a brief discussion, I was directed to their past output (I was pleased to discover they have quite the impressive history, discography and undeniable imprint on the scene itself no matter how diluted and fractured it might seem in recent years) and I decided, why the hell not? I’m game!\n\nFrom its opening, abruptly barked, “I am fire” this captivates. With a blazing melting the face off approach which incorporates black metal in many of its forms this doesn’t sport a dull moment but rather instances of jaw dropping intensity, musicians in full on beast mode and a myriad enstumblement (huh, I just invented a word!) of thoughts such as “how is it that it’s not until now that I’ve discover 1349?” Truth be told I’m not normally a black metal fan, though recently I’ve warmed to the black flame this could well be what my curiosity has been hankering for. A full submergence of that which the genre offers from an act who are undeniably masters of the craft and aren’t afraid of tinkering with their representation of it. If you have yet to discover 1349 this is most probably a great place to start, I only say ‘most probably’ as this is my introduction to them and I am contemplating taking another vacation in order that I can dive into their discography and give it the attention it deserves. #ScrewThosePeskyBills\n\nReccd by Void\n\nVerdugo – Perversión y Destrucción\n\n(Chile – not the similar titled act from Spain)\n\nRelease – January/2010\n\nhttps://verdugometal.bandcamp.com/album/perversi-n-y-destrucci-n\n\nThoughts –\n\n(Before I start, I’d like to point out that this isn’t what Void Reccd. *Insert howls of disappointment here. But it is from the same band. My reasoning is that I couldn’t find but two tracks from the album he pointed me towards. So rather than do a half assed job I’d rather tackle a full release, in this instance a four-track introduction of sorts.)\n\nWell, if you aren’t intrigued by the primitive artwork alone, I’m not sure what to say. A dungeon, an executor and an “attached” lithe female who appears to wearing part of a Nuns habit. But one can’t forget the goat looking gent in the corner who’s probably more than aroused at the sight, or alternatively the sharpened ax in the hooded fellows grasp. I must mention he looks like he appears to have a genius level sense of balance too what with the activities taking place and his considerable ‘girth’.\n\nIn regards to the music on offer there’s no denying that this is old school thrash with a decidedly wicked jaded edge (and to answer a query from Void; Yes. This is, “right up my alley”) Apart from the fact that it’s old school it’s also catchy as a vintage baseball mitt and offers twice the enjoyment (no matter how soft that gloves ’embrace’ might be). The drum salvo has the effect of making the limbs twitch with uncontrollable spastic movements, the rhythms and pace are enough to sate even the most discerning of fan and the vocals enough to raise goose flesh. Odd that the language is one I’m not native to but it matters not the while effect is one to send a fan into a frenzy. This might be raw; it might not sport the production qualities one desires but there’s no doubt it fits perfectly. In short, this contains four tracks any speed freak with old school leanings which warrant attention.\n\nIn regards to that which Void Reccd “Altar Del Rencor” if I can find a full-length copy, I’d be happier to review it also (if Verdugo is reading this. I’m up for it. Hint, hint.)\n\nFor those of you who are still intrigued this is the link that Void originally sent https://verdugometal.bandcamp.com/album/altar-del-rencor\n\nIt contains a teasing two tracks, which only leaves one wanting more.\n\nWell that’s about it for this installment, my apologies for the wait, I only hope this was worth it and will suffice until the next entry (whenever that might be). Until our paths of audio interest meet again, don’t fear discovery of that which is normally foreign to the senses.\n\nCult\n\nAbrasive Audio…to Soothe the Senses (Part 26)\n\nTumbling downwards into the ever-yawning abyss. Constantly changing form, ever evolving. Will I be able to dig myself free from the onslaught and unrelenting barrage of promo material, probably not. Truth be told, I don’t even make a dent, but I will strive to make an impression.\n\nOnward…\n\nSlutvomit – Copulation of Cloven Hooves\n\n(USA)\n\nRelease – October/4/2019\n\nInvictus Productions\n\nhttps://invictusproductions666.bandcamp.com/album/copulation-of-cloven-hooves\n\nARTWORK – 78\n\nA scythe, fire in full blaze and a couple of hoodlums (I jest!) And I betting this is all taking place as part of some secluded wooded area shenanigans. Don’t get lost fellas, here’s hoping you packed a flare with the corpse paint and the rusted farmyard equipment.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 85\n\nTolling bells and chilling melodic riffs start this album off. This might sound like a vintage Slayer unreleased ‘B side’. But hold on… a whirlwind demonical maniacal element soon gains supremacy, an eye-opening space of time interrupted by a blackened speed infernal assault and rasped vocals. I’m all ears, and you should be too. I’m not sure what I was expecting, it wasn’t this. Color me impressed!\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 87\n\nInitially I though this is “Altars of Madness” madness but at played at vintage Vader speed. However, other stylistic elements join in the fray to make this more than simply an album caked in filth, infernal nature and frenetic diabolical mischievous riffs aplenty. Rare is that the band play all out, the passion for the scene and what they do is all too obvious and that shows in every lethal intent laden riff and dizzying rhythm transformation. Add to the above-mentioned influence vintage Slayer, a splash of levity by way of Witchery and pitch darkness ala Mayhem and you have an album that drips black sensibilities though is weighted in speed tropes, maniacal values, instantly appreciateable raunchiness and, naturally, wickedness.\n\nIn short this is quite the experience for both the listener and the speaker set up. In fact, certain passages would make an excellent accompaniment to cult celluloid affairs on account of their atmosphere and palpable ominous presence.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Endless Graves, Scythe of Mass Damnation, Copulation of Cloven Hooves, Evil Commands You, Acolyte of Deaths Destruction.\n\nFFO; Vintage Slayer, Mayhem, Morbid Angel, Witchery, early Bathory.\n\nWarcrab – Damned in Endless Night\n\n(UK)\n\nRelease – August/30/2019\n\nTranscending Obscurity Records\n\nhttps://warcrabuk.bandcamp.com/album/damned-in-endless-night-death-sludge-metal\n\nARTWORK – 79\n\nMedieval in tone, gloomy, dark and ominous. Is that a plague bearer, or an acolyte or someone who’s merely lost? Why is he guarding that wall? Was it a castle, keep, or a building of some importance at one point or another? There’s not much left now, should someone tell the poor bloke?\n\nFIRST TRACK – 77\n\nUndeniable Carcass vocal inflections. Groove within a sludge nature and a hypnotizing mid paced bludgeoning aura. This is death encased doom with undeniable nods to Bolt Thrower but it’s different.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 76\n\nStylistically this encompasses a hybrid of genres though cannot be placed comfortably in just one. It has atmosphere, melancholic moments and a plethora of passages akin to old school death drenched in dirge doom undertones suffice it to say there’s plenty of groove here too. Nods to Bolt Thrower are unmistakable, there’s a track centered on a Chaos god (Khorne – The God of War) originating from the Games Workshop fantasy gaming universe whom BT were associated with in their early career (“War Master” and/or “Realm of Chaos” anyone?) Atmosphere is plentiful also with a myriad of tracks incorporating rhythms which are repetitive though hypnotic in their effect.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Halo of Flies, Abyssal Mausoleum, Damnation.\n\nFFO; Bolt Thrower, Carcass, Cathedral, vintage Katatonia, vintage Paradise Lost.\n\nA Break in our Regularly Scheduled Programming to peek at an Official Track Premier\n\nHideous Divinity – The Embalmer\n\nOfficial Track Premier taken from November/8/2019 full- length entitled “Simulacrum”\n\nCentury Media Records\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlnqtDP6Kzs\n\nArtwork (album) – 90\n\nFrom out of the crimson murk a form arises. It’s evolving and pissed! Amazing color play and details adorn this image making it a must have piece of merchandise (be it shirt, tapestry or patch) to support an act who have yet to disappoint in my opinion.\n\nInitial Listen – 91\n\nBefore I move onto my thoughts upon the track, I’d like to lay a few down upon the video (above). It’s as though Nacho Cerda (if you’re into extreme horror celluloid his should be a name you recognize. His works include Genesis and Aftermath) has stepped into musical video territories. This is a little strange if I’m to be honest, a tad artsy and most probably the realization of a fantastical dream (based on a lifelong career?) The imagery is stark, vivid and disturbing and nods to Godlike aspirations (malleable human bodies carved from clay) and fetish behaviors. The effects are grisly, gruesome and outstanding. And there’s little doubt that it is of top-tier quality, an amazing accompaniment to the extreme audio on offer. In regard to the music. The staggeringly swift, precise, unrelenting drum salvo is probably the first one notices, that and the epic atmospheric aura. Symphonic elements are somewhat hidden in the background adding just the right amount of nuance when required. Rhythms are technical and tempos are pleasingly diverse. Divided between hyper speed aggressive passages and reflective breakdowns the track has a certain depth draped in menacing tones with just the right amount of diabolic elements tossed in to keep this at elevated heights.\n\nThere’s no doubt Hideous Divinity know how to carve a track to make one sit up and take note, this is no exception. If you’re anything like me this only makes you more excited for their next full-length.\n\nNovember eighth can’t come fast enough!\n\nFFO; Nile, Origin, Misery Index.\n\nAnd now, Back to Regularly Scheduled Programming…\n\nAbythic – Conjuring the Obscure\n\n(Germany)\n\nRelease – September/11/2019\n\nXtreem Music\n\nhttps://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/conjuring-the-obscure\n\nARTWORK – 84\n\nMummy looks pissed. Did someone steal an egg?\n\nFIRST TRACK – 76\n\nCrunchy riffs, an ominous nature, mid- tempo death/doom melodies and the occult. Toss in German language soundbites and the intrigue level goes through the roof.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 79\n\nIt took my youthful, insensitive, juvenile sense of humor a while to get over a cursory glance at the track list and in particular “Order of the Gash”. With the abrupt spell of uncontrollable laughter out of the way I hit play.\n\nAtmosphere aplenty here amidst a steamroller riff approach. The occasional passages are undeniably Bolt Thrower in tone whereas a mid-tempo approach permeates the remainder of the album ala Benediction and Morgoth. Groove elements add to the albums allure alongside an undeniable menacing/ominous aura\n\nFavorite Tracks; Order of the Gash, Drifting Among Shadows, Shadows of Becoming Might, Let the Purge Begin.\n\nFFO; Morgoth, Abysmal Dawn, Benediction.\n\nSölicitör – s/t EP\n\n(USA)\n\nRelease – October/25/2019\n\nGates of Hell Records\n\nClawhammer PR\n\nhttps://solicitor-speedmetal.bandcamp.com/album/solicitor-ep-2019\n\n(the original release from May minus the demo tracks)\n\nARTWORK – 74\n\nPrimitive black and white imagery. A Mad Max bike, a mushroom cloud, skulls, whips and chains. Count me in! I have only the one question; is that lady wearing corpse paint?\n\nFIRST TRACK – 81\n\nA chilling introduction (ala early Slayer) with ominous qualities leads into a technical speed metal assault complemented by production values which toss me back to the late eighties and a vocal approach which is passionate (including crooning elements which put me in mind of Messiah Marcolin though others say a mixture of Halford and Bobby “Blitz” Ellsworth; Overkill which I can also hear) though a little different than what might have been expected. A great start.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 80\n\nA fantastic mash up of speed metal and traditional heavy metal this sports a delicious pace throughout, wicked leads and melodies you can lose yourself in. it might take a few listens to get used to the vocal approach (for me anyway) but once that’s settled there’s little to not instantly appreciate. This is infectious, addictive and will leave fans of the earliest forms of speed metal excited and eager for more, perhaps a full length to be released early next year. Stay tuned.\n\nSix tracks in all; four and two demo versions of the first two featured (“Nightstalker” and “Speed Tyrant”). It’s intriguing to discover how a band’s sound has progressed through different stages of development and this is no exception.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Nightstalker, Vulture Command, Execution Squad.\n\nFFO; Exciter, Whiplash, Chastain, Blitzkrieg, Overkill.\n\nStench of Profit – Human Discount (EP)\n\n(Italy)\n\nRelease – May/20/2019\n\nLethal Scissors\n\nImperative PR\n\nhttps://lethalscissor.bandcamp.com/album/human-discount-ep\n\nARTWORK – 72\n\nWhoa! Hey, you have a little something. Here let me grab at it with my greasy, untrained, paws.\n\nOuch! Although that’s a baby hammer it still looks like it hurts like a bitch!\n\nFIRST TRACK – 81\n\nNoise, but discernable rhythms, shifts in tempo, breakdowns, angst and groove aplenty I’m digging this!\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 78\n\nFour tracks and seven minutes in length there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind what manner of audio this is! I’m happy to report that this beast delivers. Grinding percussion, a supreme diverse abrasive vocal assault (harsh, screaming and grunts) and melodies you can break every bone in the body too. Seriously what else do you need? Answer; best no to think about it, easier to let this drive your form to frenetic, spastic, jerking movements your spouse might wonder upon your state of mind if witnessing.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Leaches, What’s Left.\n\nFFO; Nasum, Brutal Truth, Napalm Death, Misery Index.\n\nVagrant – The Rise of Norn\n\n(Germany)\n\nRelease – July/26/2019\n\nBlack Lion Records\n\nQabar PR\n\nhttps://vagrantblacklion.bandcamp.com/album/the-rise-of-norn\n\nARTWORK – 82\n\nThe sun breaks through threatening skies bring a ray of hope. All might seem saved but for the beckoning vortex which has opened in the body of water. Great colors and a classic nature make this image pop.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 84\n\nMelodic death in overall appearance and feel yet has an undeniable folk edge and a menacing blackened vibe. Plenty of excellent atmosphere and powerful symphonic presence bode well for what’s to follow.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 87\n\nWeaving a masterful combination of melodies and atmosphere with lyrics based around warriors, folklore, fate and superstition Vagrant have managed to create an album which flows exquisitely. Acoustic passages are a great touch and pair brilliantly with masterful symphonic touches. The rhythms intertwine with galloping and heavy riffs forging a release which is far from the run of the mill melodic death or even blackened death album. There’s a lot to take in stylistically here but it’s melded with care and executed with precision. A great touch is that the album goes full circle. Highly recommended!\n\nOffering symphonic death, melodic death exquisite acoustic elements, doom, folk and Viking metal this has the potential to appeal to a wide audience.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Blinded by Destiny, Deceptive Similarity, Spirit of Valor.\n\nFFO; (vintage) Arch Enemy, Amon Amarth, At the Gates, Hyperion, Rotting Christ, Unleashed, early Katatonia.\n\nSingularity -Place of Chains\n\n(USA)\n\nRelease – October/11/2019\n\nThe Artisan Era\n\nMind Eraser PR\n\nhttps://singularityaz.bandcamp.com/album/place-of-chains\n\nARTWORK – 80\n\nThis could well be a still from a movie where an alien force is holding humanity captive for one reason or another. Is this the soundtrack to said movie? Hitting play…\n\nFIRST TRACK – 90\n\nWhat starts out as a symphonic possibly power metal opus soon transforms when the riffs and the million miles an hour precision drum assault kicks in. Then there’s the vocals, progressive leads, melodies, stunning atmosphere and the fretboard frenetic spider work. Damn impressive opener which stays this side of overboard insane guitar wizardry madness to please any fan of technical brutality.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 93\n\nInferi technicality with a splash of Gothic aura (ala Cradle of Filth) wrapped in a maniacal grin carving delectable shell. Delicious rhythms, chasing melodies, galloping riffs, technically cavorting with progressive brilliance. Seriously, what more could you ask for? And this flows seamlessly like a river, albeit a tempestuous temperamental flow. Sci fi element? Check! Feast your ears on this and you will not be disappointed!! Stunning melodic technical death from the desert. The Artisan Era bring it again!!\n\nTop of the heap audio here!\n\nFavorite Tracks; Victory or Death, Sisyphean Cycle, Consume and Assume. Dead Receptors.\n\nFFO; Inferi, Inanimate Existence, Necrophagist, Cradle of Filth, Equipoise, Fleshgod Apocalypse, Alterbeast.\n\nAnd Now for “Something Completely Different”\n\nThe Neptune Power Federation – Memoirs of a Rat Queen\n\n(Australia)\n\nRelease – September/27/2019\n\nCruz Del Sur Music\n\nClawhammer PR\n\nhttps://theneptunepowerfederation.bandcamp.com/album/memoirs-of-a-rat-queen\n\nARTWORK – 74\n\nThere’s most definitely something going on here. A priestess of sorts (with horns) sitting on a throne atop a pile of vanquished foes. Let’s just say I’m intrigued.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 72\n\nThis bears an unmistakable Cosmic narrative vibe as well a rock n roll aura straight from the 70/80’s. Like Heart meets Hawkwind with considerable fuzz and relaxed beat. This is most definitely not extreme audio, that much is clear even from the tracks first opening bars so those hoping for words something akin to that might want to skip to musings upon the next act for all others whose thoughts drip with intrigue and minds are drenched in curiosity read on…\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 76\n\nHeart meets Girlschool meets Muse meets Hawkwind meets Deep Purple with a splash of Motorhead and then some. In short, this album is diverse, passionate, boasts a concept narrative aura, is set in a late 70/early 80’s alternate musical landscape and has a great deal to offer for those who are willing to let it. Open those minds and be prepared to explore something far from the usual beaten track folks and you’ll have fun with what this offers. Admittedly it took a few spins to appreciate and I had to approach listens in ‘certain’ moods but it’s nice to leave the familiar occasionally and explore that which is strange, unfamiliar and unusual. Sure, this has passages which are galaxies removed from my usual listening arenas though for those are willing to explore this is an intriguing step away from the safe, the “normal”, predictable waters. Hard to categorize this is easier to place in the love it or leave it folder. It’s far from horrid or unlistenable, it’s “experimental” bordering on Avant Garde spanning a great many familiar genres and incorporating each in its own way. Obviously, this type of audio doesn’t appeal to everyone, usually only the brave. Jump in blind with zero assumptions!\n\nFavorite Tracks; Watch our Masters Bleed, Bound for Hell, The Reaper Comes for Thee.\n\nFFO; Queen, Motorhead, Hawkwind, Muse, Heart, Rush, Girlschool.\n\nWell. That about brings things to a close for this week.\n\nUntil our paths of audio interest cross again, don’t be afraid to explore that which you normally might not.\n\nCult\n\nAbrasive Audio Part Twenty – Five\n\nA quarter of a century and still ticking. The world of metal is ever giving, what can I say? Prepare for an international array of diverse audio offerings in this installment. Without further ado let’s get this under way, shall we? As always, I’ve included Bandcamp links (or links from another format if not available) so that one might be able to listen as the atrocious grammar which flows from my fingertips washes before the retinas. Onward…\n\nAlcoholocaust – Necro Apocalipse Bestial\n\n(Portugal)\n\nRelease – September/5/2019\n\nHellDProd\n\nAgainst PR\n\nhttps://brigadantiposers.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nARTWORK – 81\n\nA possessed bulldozer on the rampage in glorious black and white. Lovin’ the primitive vibe.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 82\n\nA somewhat diabolical introduction transforms into wicked riffage and addictive galloping riffs. Heavily accented vocals add a blackened edge and I’m eager for more.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 85\n\nAggressive speed metal with the occasional splash of punk accompanied by maniacal and archaic heavily accented vocals (lyrics are in Portuguese mostly and the tracks titles are strangely a 50-50 split) This could well be the foreign long-lost twin to Whiplash’s “Power and Pain” release. It’s obviously nothing ground-breaking but it is criminally addictive and requires limbering up before hitting the play button. Prepare to have this reside in your audio equipment for an extended duration of time.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Solucao Abysmal, Bulldozer Infernal, Necro Ritual, Patrulha Thrash, Assalto Metalico.\n\nFFO; Whiplash, Exciter, Hellripper, Bastardizer, vintage Slayer.\n\nThrashfire – Into the Armageddon\n\n(Turkey)\n\nRelease – October/10/2019\n\nXtreem Music\n\nhttps://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-armageddon\n\nARTWORK – 80\n\nA crimson shrouded sky in an altogether menacing comic book-esque image.\n\nA dastardly looking fellow complete with a Reapers scythe appears to be collecting the souls of the children within the immediate radius. I can hear the teachers chant in jubilation “At last, a day off!”\n\nFIRST TRACK – 80\n\nOpens with an Arraya- esque scream, frantic, maniacal, guitar riffs and a style which is part early Slayer and part later Exodus accompany this for an adrenaline-fueled start to the proceedings which leaves me sweaty, sore and very much intrigued.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 82\n\nTakes a little while to get going but once it does, shit…you might wanna’ add badass metal talent to the list of things Turkey is known for (other than being named after a delicious flightless bird which has the odd effect if making he/she who eats it tired, an odd defense mechanism that!) Bordering on thrash/death this boasts rarely a boring non- nuclear fueled moment. A South American styled vocal assault adds significant “black” to the albums tone. Slayer nods are frequent enough to be noticed. Overall a fantastic introduction to an act who demand respect with a release which will garner the attention of a significant number of ears for good reason.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Katacomb (The Kingdom of Resurrection), Supreme Command. Through the Crimson Darkness, Post-Apocalyptic Holy Terror.\n\nFFO; Vintage Slayer, Nuclear Assault, Exodus, Malevolent Creation, Toxic Holocaust.\n\nStortregn – Evocation of Light\n\n(Switzerland)\n\n(Re)release -September/20/2019 on a vinyl format (originally released in 2013)\n\nNon Serviam Records\n\nhttps://non-serviam-records.bandcamp.com/album/evocation-of-light\n\nARTWORK – 85\n\nSomething foreboding is on the horizon (has the sun turned it a blender?) The mountains care not as they are timeless. Humanity on the other hand could well be fuked!\n\nFIRST TRACK – 85\n\nA Dissection esque symphonic backdrop bursting with classical Gothic elements against a Stockholm melodic death assault add to that exquisite blackened touches rasped vocals, the occasional “Storm of the Lights Bane” nod, an excellent flow and you have a fantastic start.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 87\n\nChanneling the nature of early Dissection and adding to it with varied yet somewhat stylistic similar influences (Amon Amarth, Necrophobic and Emperor) Stortregn have fashioned an album which is able to be appreciated immediately. Classical acoustic, melancholic, interludes add depth and serve to break up the album nicely. Some may find the similarities to the above-mentioned album at times over-powering. However, I’m of the other collective who believes this is a solid slab of melodic blackened metal showcasing an act who are finding their path whilst giving obvious homage to those who have laid the groundwork, making waves in the scene while doing so.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Epitaph; An Evocation of Light, So Much Dust, Throughfares, The Call.\n\nFFO; Dissection, Emperor, At the Gates, Necrophobic.\n\nlllvilja -Livet\n\n(Sweden)\n\nRelease – August/2019\n\nHalvfabrikat Records, Phobia Records, Dark Elk Vinyl\n\nhttps://phobiarecords.bandcamp.com/album/illvilja-livet-lp\n\nARTWORK – 72\n\nBlunt and primitive with no frills there’s no doubt who this album is by and what it’s entitled.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 94\n\nCommences with a Bolt Thrower vibe circa the “IVth Crusade” (spoken words and all) then the beat kicks in and is more than successful in knocking one on their arse. Infectious and inciteful of that there’s no doubt but the star however is the vocalist, his pipes the quality of his approach and the level of angst which is through the Fn’ roof.\n\nI am most definitely awake!\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 91\n\nAlthough all the lyrics are in a foreign tongue (to me anyway) they sound, at times, almost oddly familiar. The fact that I can’t understand a bloody word doesn’t take me out of the album’s enjoyment at all, but rather, adds to its allure. A primitive, mysterious, spice to heat up that which is already incendiary, both in its nature and infectiousness. Touches of stylistic diversity, and appreciative breaks from the same old, same old (which could well be expected based on this albums categorization, hailed as “Dbeat/Blackened-Crust”) propel this to refreshing heights making this a release set to be the bar which others in the genre will struggle to reach.\n\nThis came out of nowhere to catapult me to the nearest medical facility on account of my abrupt skyrocketing excitement levels.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Krossa Spegeln, Offerbalet, Svet,\n\nFFO; Disrupt.\n\nA Break in our Regularly Scheduled Programming to peek at a few “Singles”/Official Track Releases\n\nGoddess of Fate – Orchard Gardener\n\n(India)\n\nRelease – October/26/2019\n\nSelf-Release\n\nhttps://goddessoffate.bandcamp.com/\n\nDewar PR\n\nARTWORK – 72\n\nWhoa, this takes a moment to fully (attempt to) digest. There’s a baby in there, a devil, a giving hand, a smiling face, a maze and something which might or might not represent recycling. And it’s all in black and white. Hardly traditional but it does grab the attention and demands closer investigation, and for reason I say that it succeeds.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 76\n\nWhat starts out as tight percussion ala early Iron Maiden although with a splash of folk soon transforms into technical progressive territories with a touch of Avant Garde’. Later, after a brief tumble into groove laden death metal realms (think later Death material though with a more abrasive vocal approach) it slides into dreamy realms leaving the listener all the while wondering where this may head in the next moment. It certainly boasts enough rhythm shifts and tempo changes to keep the most discerning amongst us intrigued though seems to subtly revolve around and return to its initial riff structure as the track reaches its climax. The transitions here are seamless and showcase folk, progressive, traditional heavy metal, groove and death cavorting and frolicking amongst themselves for superiority within an epic arena which gives each their time and never wallows for too long in any one realm. If this is any indication of what’s to be represented upon an upcoming full-length one can expect a wide variety of styles embodied, diversity personified and impressive musicianship. Keep an ear to the ground and an eye out for this creative collective as with quality like this I can well expect their name to grace the pages of respected genre tabloids across the globe soon enough.\n\nFFO; Dream Theater, Atheist, Between the Buried and Me, Opeth.\n\nObscure – Curse of my Race\n\nTaken from upcoming full-length “Darkness must Prevail” with a tentative release date of November/5/2019\n\n(Spain)\n\nXtreem Music\n\nhttps://xtreemmusic.bandcamp.com/album/darkness-must-prevail\n\nARTWORK (album) – 83\n\nThis image reminds me of the slow progress of ‘uncle Frank’ from the first Hellraiser film (from a franchise which is about to run into double digits). Bones, sinew and musculature and a look as if to say “see, I can do it. Whatcha’ think?”\n\nIts unique tonal effect gives the impression that its origin is a place with minimal light. A great touch rather than the crimson most would expect to see on a cover from this genre.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 81\n\nInitial choppy riffs develop into a rhythm which is part Bolt Thrower (dirgey in tone), and part Jungle Rot in feel with a splash of Cannibal Corpse in the vocal department. The track continues breaking down slightly into a slower tempo with a European doom/death edge. The intensity builds both in pace and ferocious nature towards the tracks climax. Rather than rely on straightforward speed or brutality Obscure have chosen to incorporate a style which embodies a myriad of pace and a slight old school feel making for a track with a decidedly death/doom aura which boasts depth and somewhat of a narrative texture. It works and this is a fantastic teaser for what’s to follow.\n\nFFO; Morgoth, Bolt Thrower, Jungle Rot, Abysmal Dawn.\n\n1349 -Striding the Chasm\n\nTaken from the upcoming full-length “The Infernal Pathway” with a tentative release date of October/18/2019\n\n(Norway)\n\nSeason of Mist Records\n\nhttps://1349som.bandcamp.com/album/the-infernal-pathway\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFu2sWn987s\n\nARTWORK (album) – 82\n\nA decapitated head within a pentagram of sorts with gold inlay hints at mysticism and rather sinister activities. A fantastic image draped in detail and symbology.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 87\n\nBetter limber up before hitting play on this one. It’s blazing fast both in the riffage and skin pounding departments and takes very little time to get to where it’s headed. Rhythms incite movement and it bears an infectious nature which is damn near criminal. The rasped vocal approach adds a menacing edge which elevates the package to addictive realms to put a smile on any blackened speed demon’s visage. This is the type of no-nonsense blackened death I can subscribe to, suffice it to say I’m awaiting the full length watching the seconds tick by.\n\nFFO; Rotting Christ, early Septic Flesh.\n\nBack to Regularly Scheduled Programming\n\nFateful Finality – Executor\n\n(Germany)\n\nRelease – October/11/2019\n\nFastball Music\n\nhttps://fastball-music.bandcamp.com/album/fire-and-brimstone\n\nAgainst PR\n\nARTWORK – 77\n\nA comic book-esque representation of the seven deadly sins with a “Reaper” character amongst the Sinners contemplating on whom to “collect” next.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 88\n\nHuge impact with the first riff! Aggressive thrash with South American influence. The high-octane approach does not let up and I’m headbanging like one possessed.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 82\n\nA pleasing mixture of styles incorporating a slew of genre trademarks, a smidgen of crossover a sprinkle of djent and aggression from start to finish. Vocal styles are varied pulling from hardcore arenas and traditional thrash realms. The bonus track (Moonchild) seems odd at first but the ‘hidden track’ (Overkill) more than makes up for it. Overall an album fans of early The Haunted material will most likely salivate over. This is my introduction of the band and if this is any indication of their past or future audio theirs is a discography which needs paying close attention to.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Fire and Brimstone, The Raid, Wreckage of the Flesh, Venomous.\n\nFFO; The Haunted, Killswitch Engaged, Lamb of God, Kreator.\n\nConsecration – Fragilium\n\n(United Kingdom)\n\nRelease – June/28/2019\n\nSolitude Productions\n\nImperative PR\n\nGrand Sounds PR\n\nhttps://consecration666.bandcamp.com/album/fragilium-album-2019\n\nARTWORK – 91\n\nA beatific form arching towards the light as a myriad of tendrils/hands attempt to pull “her” back into the earth. A stunning play on good and evil on the forces they play upon everyday life as one strives to rise above. An intricate, delicate, black and white image which seethes with emotion.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 85\n\nA melancholic though passionate instrumental which overflows with depth and a deep sense of mourning. A wonderful start which places the listener in a state of readiness for what’s to follow, or one could only assume.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 84\n\nTraditional yet unfamiliar. This seethes with a myriad of styles one might not initially expect whilst still holding firm to doom foundations one would. Funeral doom cavorts with rhythms that nod to 90’s Gothic rock and the earliest incarnation of doom with heavy metal undertones, even at times showcasing an aura which hints at experimental black metal realms. Accompanied by vocals and often rhythms which tell of definite old school influence and occasional moments of an Avant Garde nature this certainly makes for a listening experience which is familiar, yet pleasingly different. Go into this with an open mind and no assumptions and you’ll find yourself sinking into the unhurried epic nature (long intros included so be warned!) of the audio on offer. Recommended with a side of “green” (if you catch my drift).\n\nFavorite Tracks; A Sentinel for the Fragile, An Elegy for the Departed, To Welcome the Grey.\n\nFFO; Anathema, My Dying Bride, Mourning Beloveth, early Paradise Lost\n\nByzanthian Neckbeard – Minaton\n\n(Guernsey/Channel Islands/United Kingdom)\n\nRelease – November/29/2019\n\nIndependent\n\nDewar PR\n\nhttps://byzanthianneckbeard.bandcamp.com/\n\nARTWORK – 82\n\nWhy does this remind me of that scene in Time Bandits with a young Sean Connery? Ah yes, it’s the Minotaur’s head dripping in crimson. I’m of the mind that the audio herein is going to also drip in mythological elements, though I have no clue as to the style which will support it. Here goes nothing…\n\nFIRST TRACK – 91\n\nA chilling and poetic Brothers Grimm fairy tale esque narrative drenched in mythology and dipped in a Cradle of Filth Gothic sauce. I’m hooked already, hold my calls!\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 90\n\nI doubt that many amongst us have even heard of Guernsey. I have, but that’s only because I originally hail from the South West of England. All that, however, is about to change. This collective pound out a style which is heavily doom/sludge infused though tainted with an undeniable thrash/death aura courtesy of the blackened vocal approach. But let us not forget the mythology lyric base. Minotaurs, Were-spiders, Devil worms and an occult Gothic vibe which binds the whole together. Blanket the package in irresistible groove, a bluesy black and roll passion and you have a winner. An introduction to the band (for me anyway) which only warrants dropping everything in order to dive into their past work. Forget the recent connotations which come with the term ‘neckbeard’ and jump in. But be warned, you might not want to leave the catacombs anytime soon. Bring a snack!\n\n(If you’re reading this guys, next time I’m in town (England) I’ll be looking you up in hopes to catch a show. Guernsey is only a ferry and a short road trip away.)\n\nFavorite Tracks; The Tale of Raymond, The Were-spider, Devil Worms, Minaton, Necron 5, Out of the Deep.\n\nFFO; Candlemass, Pungent Stench and mid-tempo death/doom output which bears significant groove.\n\nShadow Limb – Burn Scar\n\n(USA)\n\nRelease – October/11/2019\n\nSeeing Red Records\n\nhttps://shadowlimb.bandcamp.com/\n\nARTWORK – 93\n\nIs that a superhero of some kind tangling with a mystical shapeshifting pachyderm? Or is it a muscled gent in a tight-fitting leotard “tripping balls” at a local zoo? Regardless, the art is eye opening, original, wickedly visualized and far from the everyday album adornment. It only leaves me pondering upon what manner of audio is encapsulated within.\n\nFIRST TRACK – 84\n\nA delicate mixture of styles. Doom, sludge cavorting with progressive elements and aggressive angst-ridden vocals paired with melodic spoken word passages make for an interesting opener which is rather hard to describe if truth be told but leaves an impression, nevertheless.\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 91\n\nStoner rock, doom, sludge, progressive and yet there’s so much more on offer. These cats deliver and execute a smorgasbord of styles which combine to form a mesmerizing audio tapestry, a tableau which is familiar while at the same time intriguingly unique. An audio landscape which is unpredictable and exhilarating though on the other hand is also soothing and hypnotic. A contradiction in terms which exemplifies excellence in musical creativity resulting in a release which might well take a few spins to fully soak up though is well worth the investment. Go into this with an open mind and leave with the knowledge that their name is one you will be hearing a great deal of in the future.\n\nFavorite Tracks; Asger Arisen, Watered Down Alby, Cleanse the Ire, Line of Descent.\n\nFFO; early Mastodon, Kyuss, Nuerosis, Acid Bath, Void King.\n\nDeathensemble – (3 track) 2019 DEMO\n\n(USA)\n\nRelease – July/13/2019\n\nSelf-Released\n\nhttps://deathensemble.bandcamp.com/\n\nOccasionally an act will reach out with hopes that I will ‘cover’ their material. Unfortunately, in most instances it’s difficult to do so. In between a job which demands my exhaustive attention and more than full-time hours, raising an infant and all the random duties associated with owning (whoever really owns…) a house and being part of a loving family unit, I find it hard sometimes to post anything on a regular basis. Thank the Dark Lord I have a supportive wife who understands this is my passion (which I don’t get paid for). In this instance however I’ve found a few moments and it also helps that there’s only three tracks here which don’t run into epic lengths, that and these guys asked so nicely and the fact that this was released on my birthday doesn’t hurt either (hint hint). Onward…\n\nINITIAL LISTEN – 75\n\nThis release starts with riffage which is somewhat Dissection in tone. The feel soon transforms into a South American aggressive thrash flavor and then back again. A great opener dripping with blackened thrash values and a rhythm which is head-noddingly infectious. The vocals lean more towards hardcore arenas, a fast-flowing pace, though strangely fit the percussion. The second track flows well, has a doom-esque atmospheric breakdown, bears a Lovecraftian vibe though appears a little rushed. However, it’s still very much palatable with an aura which hints at undeniable crossover influence (M.O.D, D.R.I). The final track bursts with a thrashin’ madness vibe (putting me in mind of earlier Exodus material) boasting riffs which are somewhat repetitive, simplistic though do a fantastic job of hitting the spot. Overall, a solid effort in the going straight for the jugular thrash arena presented by a somewhat raw production (more pronounced in the final track) that doesn’t hinder the music’s effects any. The three tracks on offer are somewhat diverse in tone, show a willingness to explore surrounding genres and creativity in incorporating the research. Ranging from blackened thrash to hardcore/crossover this bodes well for a future effort with a little tightening up.\n\nGive these guys a listen and support the scene.\n\nFavorite Tracks; The Entity Returned.\n\nFFO; Kreator, Dissection, Exodus.\n\nUntil our paths of audio interest meet again, don’t be afraid to discover that which may be foreign to your usual listening habits,\n\nCult"
