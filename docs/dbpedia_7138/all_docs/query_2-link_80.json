To the authors' knowledge, itinerant chest pain has not been reported as sign or symptom of PE. A 41-year-old woman presenting with left chest pain, no hemoptysis, or breathing difficulties. The chest pain was more severe on deep inspiration. Chest computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound imaging showed left pleural effusion. After antibiotic treatment, the left chest pain was alleviated, but a similar pain appeared in the right chest. Electrocardiogram, blood gas analysis, echocardiography, and D-dimer levels were unremarkable. Chest CT showed right pleural effusion. A CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) unexpectedly revealed a PE in the right pulmonary artery. The patient was administered anticoagulant therapy and made a complete recovery. The use of CTPA to investigate the possible presence of PE in patients with unexplained migratory pleural effusion complaining of itinerant chest pain is important. Lessons should be learned from the early use of CTPA to investigate the possible presence of PE in patients.\n\n[Chest pain units or chest pain algorithm?].\n\nPubMed\n\nChrist, M; Dormann, H; Enk, R; Popp, S; Singler, K; MÃ¼ller, C; Mang, H\n\n2014-10-01\n\nA large number of patients present to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of acute chest pain. About 10-15% are caused by acute myocardial infarction (MI), and over 50% of cases are due to noncardiac reasons. Further improvement for chest pain evaluation appears necessary. What are current options to improve chest pain evaluation in Germany? A selective literature search was performed using the following terms: \"chest pain\", \"emergency department\", \"acute coronary syndrome\" and \"chest pain evaluation\". A working group of the German Society of Cardiology published recommendations for infrastructure, equipment and organisation of chest pain units in Germany, which should be separated from the ED of hospitals and be under the leadership of a cardiologist. A symptom-based decision for acute care would be preferable if all differential diagnoses of diseases could be managed by one medical specialty: However, all four main symptoms of patients with acute MI (chest pain, acute dyspnea, abdominal pain, dizziness) are also caused by diseases of different specialties. Evaluation and treatment of acute chest pain by representatives of one specialty would lead to over- or undertreatment of affected patients. Therefore we suggest a multidisciplinary evaluation of patients with acute chest pain including representatives of emergency and critical care physicians, cardiologists, internists, geriatricians, family physicians, premedics and emergency nurses. Definition of key indicators of performance and institutionalized feedback will help to further improve quality of care.\n\nA Case Report of Cannabis Induced Hemoptysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHashmi, Hafiz Rizwan Talib; Duncalf, Richard; Khaja, Misbahuddin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract As the principal route of marijuana use is by inhalation, potential harmful consequences on pulmonary structure and function can be anticipated. Here, we present a case of hemoptysis attributed to smoking cannabis in a 38-year-old man. The patient experienced an episode of hemoptysis and shortness of breath immediately after smoking marijuana. Chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest showed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities. A fiber optic bronchoscopy confirmed bilateral diffuse bleeding from respiratory tract. Additional evaluation of hemoptysis indicated no infection or immunological responses. Urine toxicology was positive for cannabis. Chronic marijuana smoking causes visible and microscopic injury to the larger airways responsible for symptoms or chronic bronchitis. We review the beneficial and deleterious effects of marijuana and describe a case of significant hemoptysis attributed to smoking marijuana. In addition to other respiratory complications of marijuana use, physicians should educate their patients about this potentially lethal effect of marijuana smoking in the form of hemoptysis.

The association is twice as frequent in primary care as in emergency admissions. This article provides an overview of the most important musculoskeletal causes of chest pain and on the diagnostics and therapy. A selective search and analysis of the literature related to the topic of musculoskeletal causes of chest pain were carried out. Non-inflammatory diseases, such as costochondritis and fibromyalgia are frequent causes of chest pain. Inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are much less common but are more severe conditions and therefore have to be diagnosed and treated. The diagnostics and treatment often necessitate interdisciplinary approaches. Chest pain caused by musculoskeletal diseases always represents a diagnosis by exclusion of other severe diseases of the heart, lungs and stomach. Physiotherapeutic and physical treatment measures are particularly important, including manual therapy, transcutaneous electrical stimulation and stabilization exercises, especially for functional myofascial disorders.\n\nNon-Cardiac Chest Pain\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

The prevalence of NCCP is up to 70% and may be detected in this order at all levels of the medical health care system (general practitioner, emergency department, chest pain unit, coronary care).

Â© 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.\n\nA Review of Esophageal Chest Pain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCoss-Adame, Enrique\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNoncardiac chest pain is a term that encompasses all causes of chest pain after a cardiac source has been excluded. This article focuses on esophageal sources for chest pain. Esophageal chest pain (ECP) is common, affects quality of life, and carries a substantial health care burden. The lack of a systematic approach toward the diagnosis and treatment of ECP has led to significant disability and increased health care costs for this condition. Identifying the underlying cause(s) or mechanism(s) for chest pain is key for its successful management. Common etiologies include gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal hypersensitivity, dysmotility, and psychological conditions, including panic disorder and anxiety. However, the pathophysiology of this condition is not yet fully understood. Randomized controlled trials have shown that proton pump inhibitor therapy (either omeprazole, lansoprazole, or rabeprazole) can be effective. Evidence for the use of antidepressants and the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline is fair. Psychological treatments, notably cognitive behavioral therapy, may be useful in select patients. Surgery is not recommended. There remains a large unmet need for identifying the phenotype and prevalence of pathophysiologic mechanisms of ECP as well as for well-designed multicenter clinical trials of current and novel therapies.

The literature was searched using the following databases for the years 1975 forward: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; CINAHL; PubMed (MEDLINE); and SportDiscus. The general search used the keywords chest pain and athletes. The search was revised to include subject headings and subheadings, including chest pain and prevalence and athletes. Cross-referencing published articles from the databases searched discovered additional articles. No dissertations, theses, or meeting proceedings were reviewed. The authors discuss the scope of this complex problem and the diagnostic dilemma chest pain in athletes can provide. Next, the authors delve into the vast differential and attempt to simplify this process for the sports medicine physician by dividing potential etiologies into cardiac and noncardiac conditions. Life-threatening causes of chest pain in athletes may be cardiac or noncardiac in origin, which highlights the need for the sports medicine physician to consider pathology in multiple organ systems simultaneously. This article emphasizes the importance of ruling out immediately life threatening diagnoses, while acknowledging the most common causes of noncardiac chest pain in young athletes are benign. The authors propose a practical algorithm the sports medicine physician can use as a guide for the assessment and diagnostic work-up of the athlete with chest pain designed to help the physician arrive at the correct diagnosis in a clinically efficient and cost-effective manner.\n\nChest pain in daily practice: occurrence, causes and management.\n\nPubMed\n\nVerdon, FranÃ§ois; Herzig, Lilli; Burnand, Bernard; Bischoff, Thomas; PÃ©coud, Alain; Junod, Michel; MÃ¼hlemann, Nicole; Favrat, Bernard\n\n2008-06-14\n\nWe assessed the occurrence and aetiology of chest pain in primary care practice. These features differ between primary and emergency care settings, where most previous studies have been performed. 59 GPs in western Switzerland recorded all consecutive cases presenting with chest pain. Clinical characteristics, laboratory tests and other investigations as well as the diagnoses remaining after 12 months of follow-up were systematically registered. Among 24,620 patients examined during a total duration of 300 weeks of observation, 672 (2.7%) presented with chest pain (52% female, mean age 55 +/- 19(SD)). Most cases, 442 (1.8%), presented new symptoms and in 356 (1.4%) it was the reason for consulting. Over 40 ailments were diagnosed: musculoskeletal chest pain (including chest wall syndrome) (49%), cardiovascular (16%), psychogenic (11%), respiratory (10%), digestive (8%), miscellaneous (2%) and without diagnosis (3%). The three most prevalent diseases were: chest wall syndrome (43%), coronary artery disease (12%) and anxiety (7%). Unstable angina (6), myocardial infarction (4) and pulmonary embolism (2) were uncommon (1.8%). Potentially serious conditions including cardiac, respiratory and neoplasic diseases accounted for 20% of cases. A large number of laboratory tests (42%), referral to a specialist (16%) or hospitalisation (5%) were performed. Twentyfive patients died during follow-up, of which twelve were for a reason directly associated with thoracic pain [cancer (7) and cardiac causes (5)]. Thoracic pain was present in 2.7% of primary care consultations. Chest wall syndrome pain was the main aetiology. Cardio - vascular emergencies were uncommon. However chest pain deserves full consideration because of the occurrence of potentially serious conditions.\n\nPsychiatric Characteristics of the Cardiac Outpatients with Chest Pain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Jea-Geun; Kim, Song-Yi; Kim, Ki-Seok; Joo, Seung-Jae\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground and Objectives A cardiologist's evaluation of psychiatric symptoms in patients with chest pain is rare. This study aimed to determine the psychiatric characteristics of patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD) and explore their relationship with the intensity of chest pain. Subjects and Methods Out of 139 consecutive patients referred to the cardiology outpatient department, 31 with atypical chest pain (heartburn, acid regurgitation, dyspnea, and palpitation) were excluded and 108 were enrolled for the present study. The enrolled patients underwent complete numerical rating scale of chest pain and the symptom checklist for minor psychiatric disorders at the time of first outpatient visit. The non-CAD group consisted of patients with a normal stress test, coronary computed tomography angiogram, or coronary angiogram, and the CAD group included those with an abnormal coronary angiogram. Results Nineteen patients (17.6%) were diagnosed with CAD. No differences in the psychiatric characteristics were observed between the groups. \"Feeling tense\", \"self-reproach\", and \"trouble falling asleep\" were more frequently observed in the non-CAD (p=0.007; p=0.046; p=0.044) group. In a multiple linear regression analysis with a stepwise selection, somatization without chest pain in the non-CAD group and hypochondriasis in the CAD group were linearly associated with the intensity of chest pain (Î²=0.108, R2=0.092, p=0.004; Î²= -0.525, R2=0.290, p=0.010). Conclusion No differences in psychiatric characteristics were observed between the groups. The intensity of chest pain was linearly associated with somatization without chest pain in the non-CAD group and inversely linearly associated with hypochondriasis in the CAD group.

Most cases are minor and treatable or self-limited. In many cases a cause is never determined. Massive hemoptysis is an occasional occurrence that must be assessed and managed swiftly. The initial approach is no different than that for any bleeding or respiratory or hemodynamically unstable patient. The emergency physician must stabilize, localize, and stop bleeding, and include required specialists to achieve that purpose. The management suggestions presented in this article are simplistic. The emergence of improved CT technology and new bronchoscopic and angiographic techniques has provided safe and effective alternatives to surgery for many causes of hemoptysis. Surgery, however, continues to be the treatment of choice for some. Being familiar with the broad list of causes is imperative to keeping an approach organized.\n\nChest Pain: First Aid\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... condition. Seek emergency medical help immediately.

This strategy was developed to ensure excellent patient care in a setting of diminished inpatient bed availability and increasing ED congestion. It focuses on rapid risk stratification, using history, electrocardiogram, physical examination and 3 new point-of-care cardiac markers: myoglobin, CK-MB mass, and cardiac troponin I. Following the introduction of the CPS in 1997, TBRH realized significant ($500 000/yr) institutional resource savings through a 60% decrease in the admission rate of non-myocardial infarction, non-unstable angina chest pain patients, a 30% decrease in ED chest pain evaluation time, and improved ED availability of monitored stretchers. The CPS has allowed TBRH to simultaneously decrease costs and improve patient care.\n\nMisdiagnosed Chest Pain: Spontaneous Esophageal Rupture\n\nPubMed Central\n\nInci, Sinan; Gundogdu, Fuat; Gungor, Hasan; Arslan, Sakir; Turkyilmaz, Atila; Eroglu, Atila\n\n2013-01-01\n\nChest pain is one of themost common complaints expressed by patients presenting to the emergency department, and any initial evaluation should always consider life-threatening causes.

In the present study, possible interrelationships between aortic function, collagen turnover and exercise-induced chest pain in patients with arterial hypertension and angiographically normal coronary arteries were investigated. Ninety-seven patients with arterial hypertension, angiographically normal coronary arteries and no evidence of myocardial ischemia on nuclear cardiac imaging during exercise test were studied. Of these, 43 developed chest pain during exercise (chest pain group) while 54 did not (no chest pain group). Carotid femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWVc-f) was used to assess the elastic properties of the aorta. Amino-terminal pro-peptides of pro-collagen type I, (PINP, reflecting collagen synthesis), serum telopeptides of collagen type I (CITP, reflecting collagen degradation), pro-metalloproteinase 1 (ProMMP-1), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1, related to collagen turnover) were measured in plasma by immunoassay. The chest pain group had higher PWVc-f, higher and /CITP ratio, and lower proMMP-1/ TIMP-1 ratio compared to the no chest pain group. PWVc-f (t=2.53, p=0.02) and PINP (t=2.42, p=0.02) were independently associated with the presence of chest pain in multiple regression analysis. Patients with arterial hypertension, exercise-induced chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries, without evidence of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, had a stiffer aorta compared to those without chest pain. Alterations in collagen type I turnover that favor collagen accumulation in the aortic wall may contribute to aortic stiffening and chest pain in these patients.\n\nThe approach to patients with possible cardiac chest pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nParsonage, William A; Cullen, Louise; Younger, John F\n\n2013-07-08\n\nChest pain is a common reason for presentation in hospital emergency departments and general practice. Some patients presenting with chest pain to emergency departments and, to a lesser extent, general practice will be found to have a life-threatening cause, but most will not. The challenge is to identify those who do in a safe, timely and cost-effective manner. An acute coronary syndrome cannot be excluded on clinical grounds alone. In patients with ongoing symptoms of chest pain, without an obvious other cause, ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction should be excluded with a 12-lead electrocardiogram at the first available opportunity. Significant recent advances in the clinical approach to patients with acute chest pain, including better understanding of risk stratification, increasingly sensitive cardiac biomarkers and new non-invasive tests for coronary disease, can help clinicians minimise the risk of unexpected short-term adverse cardiac events. An approach that integrates these advances is needed to deliver the best outcomes for patients with chest pain. All hospital emergency departments should adopt such a strategic approach, and general practitioners should be aware of when and how to access these facilities.\n\nCPDX (Chest Pain Diagnostic Program) - A Decision Support System for the Management of Acute Chest Pain (User’s Manual)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1988-02-25\n\nchest pain and/or dyspnea are present. a.

Little is known about the need for additional evaluation in these patients who do not have evidence of myocardial infarction after the initial emergency department evaluation. We herein describe our experience with these patients in a chest pain unit (CPU) and the rate of cardiac-related chest pain in this group. Retrospective analysis of patients evaluated in our CPU from January 1, 2000 to December 16, 2004 with a history of chest pain. Patients who had a positive urine toxicologic screen for methamphetamine or cocaine were included. No patients had ECG or cardiac injury marker evidence of myocardial infarction or ischemia during the initial emergency department evaluation. A diagnosis of cardiac-related chest pain was based upon positive diagnostic testing (exercise stress testing, nuclear perfusion imaging, stress echocardiography, or coronary artery stenosis >70%). During the study period, 4568 patients were evaluated in the CPU. A total of 1690 (37%) of patients admitted to the CPU underwent urine toxicologic testing. The result of urine toxicologic test was positive for cocaine or methamphetamine in 224 (5%). In the 2871 patients who underwent diagnostic testing for coronary artery disease (CAD), 401 (14%) were found to have positive results. There was no difference in the prevalence of CAD between those with positive result for toxicology screens (26/156, 17%) and those without (375/2715, 13%, RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.7). These findings suggest a relatively high rate of CAD in patients with methamphetamine and cocaine use evaluated in a CPU.\n\nThe effect of cold application on pain due to chest tube removal.\n\nPubMed\n\nErtuÄ, Nurcan; Ulker, Saadet\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe aim of the research is to determine the effect of cold application on the pain owing to chest tube removal for patients with single pleural chest tube. Removal of chest tubes causes patients to feel pain and interventions used for reducing the pain owing to the removal of chest tubes are not sufficient. Controlled clinical trial with repeated measures. This study was conducted with 140 patients, of whom 70 patients were in the experimental group and 70 patients were in the control group, in a thoracic hospital in Turkey. Data were collected using a data collection form consisting of patients' demographic and health history and Visual Analogue Scale. Cold was applied to patients in the experimental group prior to chest tube removal. In the experimental group, skin temperature and pain intensity was measured for each patient at four time points. In the control group, pain intensity was evaluated for each patient at three time points. Data were evaluated using Chi-square and Repeated Measurements two-way anova tests. The Visual Analogue Scale score was measured immediately after the chest tube removal in the experimental group was 3Â·85, compared with 5Â·60 in the control group. There were significant differences on pain with cold application between the two groups prior and after the intervention. Age, gender, the number of days the chest tube was inserted and the chest tube insertion indication had no effect on the pain owing to chest tube removal. Cold application is effective in reducing the pain owing to chest tube removal. Cold application was recommended prior to chest tube removal to reduce the pain owing to removal of chest tube.

Noel Bairey\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAnginal chest pain is one of the most common complaints in the outpatient setting. While much of the focus has been on identifying obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) as the cause of anginal chest pain, it is clear that microvascular coronary dysfunction (MCD) can also cause anginal chest pain as a manifestation of ischemic heart disease (IHD), and carries an increased cardiovascular risk. Epicardial coronary vasospasm, aortic stenosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, congenital coronary anomalies, mitral valve prolapse and abnormal cardiac nociception can also present as angina of cardiac origin. For non-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) stable chest pain, exercise treadmill testing (ETT) remains the primary tool for diagnosis of ischemia and cardiac risk stratification; however, in certain subsets of patients, such as women, ETT has a lower sensitivity and specificity for identifying obstructive CAD. When combined with an imaging modality, such as nuclear perfusion or echocardiography testing, the sensitivity and specificity of stress testing for detection of obstructive CAD improves significantly. Advancements in stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables detection of perfusion abnormalities in a specific coronary artery territory, as well as subendocardial ischemia associated with MCD. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) enables visual assessment of obstructive CAD, albeit with a higher radiation dose. Invasive coronary angiography (CA) remains the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment of obstructive lesions that cause medically refractory stable angina. Furthermore, in patients with normal coronary angiograms, the addition of coronary reactivity testing (CRT) can help diagnose endothelial dependent and independent microvascular dysfunction. Life-style modification and pharmacologic intervention remains the cornerstone of therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with stable angina.

Unnecessary medicalization can increase morbidity. A sensitivity to the behavioural factors contributing to symptoms and disability may reduce both. The purpose of this paper is to provide physicians with a cognitive-behavioural perspective of the nature of morbidity and disability associated with chronic chest discomfort; some strategies for detecting heretofore unsuspected disability associated with chronic chest pain and related discomfort in patients with organic findings (both cardiac and non-cardiac), as well those with no identifiable disease process or organic cause; and some simple behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapeutic techniques for treating and preventing such problems.

This study developed a predictive model of chest wall pain incorporating radiobiologic effects, using clinical data from four distinct SBRT fractionation schemes. Methods and Materials: 102 SBRT patients were treated with four different fractionations: 60 Gy in three fractions, 50 Gy in five fractions, 48 Gy in four fractions, and 50 Gy in 10 fractions. To account for radiobiologic effects, a modified equivalent uniform dose (mEUD) model calculatedmoreÂ Â» the dose to the chest wall with volume weighting. For comparison, V30 and maximum point dose were also reported. Using univariable logistic regression, the association of radiation dose and clinical variables with chest wall pain was assessed by uncertainty coefficient (U) and C statistic (C) of receiver operator curve. The significant associations from the univariable model were verified with a multivariable model. Results: 106 lesions in 102 patients with a mean age of 72 were included, with a mean of 25.5 (range, 12-55) months of follow-up. Twenty patients reported chest wall pain at a mean time of 8.1 (95% confidence interval, 6.3-9.8) months after treatment. The mEUD models, V30, and maximum point dose were significant predictors of chest wall pain (p < 0.0005). mEUD improved prediction of chest wall pain compared with V30 (C = 0.79 vs. 0.77 and U = 0.16 vs. 0.11). The mEUD with moderate weighting (a = 5) better predicted chest wall pain than did mEUD without weighting (a = 1) (C = 0.79 vs. 0.77 and U = 0.16 vs. 0.14). Body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with chest wall pain (p = 0.008). On multivariable analysis, mEUD and BMI remained significant predictors of chest wall pain (p = 0.0003 and 0.03, respectively). Conclusion: mEUD with moderate weighting better predicted chest wall pain\n\nSexual, Physical, Verbal/Emotional Abuse and Unexplained Chest Pain\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEslick, Guy D.; Koloski, Natasha A.; Talley, Nicholas J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjectives: Approximately one third of patients with non cardiac chest pain (NCCP) report a history of abuse, however no data exists on the prevalence of abuse among people with unexplained chest pain in the general population.

Hospital and 90-day course were prospectively studied in 585 consecutive low-moderate risk acute chest pain patients, of whom 304 were investigated in a designated chest pain center using a pre-specified accelerated diagnostic protocol, while 281 underwent routine care in an internal medicine ward. Hospitalization was longer in the routine care compared with the accelerated diagnostic protocol group (p<0.001). During hospitalization, 298 accelerated diagnostic protocol patients (98%) vs. 57 (20%) routine care patients underwent non-invasive testing, (p<0.001). Throughout the 90-day follow-up, diagnostic imaging testing was performed in 125 (44%) and 26 (9%) patients in the routine care and accelerated diagnostic protocol patients, respectively (p<0.001). Ultimately, most patients in both groups had non-invasive imaging testing. Accelerated diagnostic protocol patients compared with those receiving routine care was associated with a lower incidence of readmissions for chest pain [8 (3%) vs. 24 (9%), p<0.01], and acute coronary syndromes [1 (0.3%) vs. 9 (3.2%), p<0.01], during the follow-up period. The accelerated diagnostic protocol remained a predictor of lower acute coronary syndromes and readmissions after propensity score analysis [OR = 0.28 (CI 95% 0.14-0.59)]. Cost per patient was similar in both groups [($2510 vs. $2703 for the accelerated diagnostic protocol and routine care group, respectively, (p = 0.9)]. An accelerated diagnostic protocol is clinically superior and as cost effective as routine in acute chest pain patients, and may save time and resources.\n\nClinical Outcomes and Cost Effectiveness of Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol in a Chest Pain Center Compared with Routine Care of Patients with Chest Pain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAsher, Elad; Reuveni, Haim; Shlomo, Nir; Gerber, Yariv; Beigel, Roy; Narodetski, Michael; Eldar, Michael; Or, Jacob; Hod, Hanoch; Shamiss, Arie; Matetzky, Shlomi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAims The aim of this study was to compare in patients presenting with acute chest pain the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of an accelerated diagnostic protocol utilizing contemporary technology in a chest pain unit versus routine care in an internal medicine department.

Of the fields in which the potential of cardiac CT has raised more interest is chest pain in acute settings. In fact, the possibility to exclude with high reliability obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients at low-to-intermediate risk is of great interest both from the clinical standpoint and from the management standpoint. Several other modalities, with or without imaging, have been used during the past decades in the settings of new onset chest pain or in acute chest pain for both diagnostic and prognostic assessment of CAD. Each one has advantages and disadvantages. Most imaging modalities also focus on inducible ischaemia to guide referral to invasive coronary angiography. The advent of cardiac CT has introduced a new practice diagnostic paradigm, being the most accurate non-invasive method for identification and exclusion of CAD. Furthermore, the detection of subclinical CAD and plaque imaging offer the opportunity to improve risk stratification. Moreover, recent advances of the latest generation CT scanners allow combining both anatomical and functional imaging by stress myocardial perfusion. The role of cardiac CT in acute settings is already important and will become progressively more important in the coming years.

Medical charts of patients presenting 1995-2008, audited for quality assurance, were chosen at random by data managers. Patients with mesothelioma, lung cancer, and angina were excluded. Rigorous attempts had been taken by the authors to exclude other causes of chest pain. There were 167 patients who were medicolegal referrals (Group 1) and 115 clinical referrals (Group 2). Although the patients in Group 1 had more severe disease generally than Group 2, the proportion with pain was not significantly different (45.5% and 55.7%, mean duration 4.8 years, range 1-22 years). Group 1 had more severe disease as a rule. However, the proportion with pain in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, was as follows: diffuse pleural thickening (50.8% and 67.6%, P=0.072), pleural plaques (47.0% and 59.7%, P=0.076), folded atelectasis (70.6% and 83.3%, P=1.000), and asbestosis (43.6% and 53.3%, P=0.346). Of all those with folded atelectasis, 73.9% had pain. Chest pain appears to be much more common in patients with benign asbestos diseases than is currently recognized, particularly in those with folded atelectasis and is not restricted to litigants. Improved recognition of this entity is needed along with practical management guidelines for the general practitioner. Further studies are envisaged by the authors.

Pathways for patients with non-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) chest pain are not optimal. An advanced cardiology nurse-led chest pain service was commenced to address this. The aim of the study was to assess the outcomes of non-ACS patients discharged from ED to an advanced cardiology nurse-led chest pain clinic and compare by referral type (nurse or ED physician). The service consisted of advanced cardiology nurse or ED physician consultation in the ED and discharge to advanced nurse-led chest pain clinic review less than 72 hours after discharge. Referrals were by the advanced nurses during consult hours and out-of-hours were by the ED physicians. Data were extracted from case notes. This was a 1-site cross-sectional study of patients attending the chest pain clinic over 2 years. Confirmed coronary disease was diagnosed in 24% of patients. Of the 1041 patients, 45% were referred by the advanced nurses, who referred significantly more patients who were older (56.5 years/52.3 years), had positive exercise stress test results (21%/12%), and were diagnosed with stable coronary artery disease (19%/11%) and less patients with musculoskeletal diagnosis (5%/13%) and other noncardiac pain (36%/45%). The study fills a gap in the literature on the follow up of non-ACS patients who present to ED and used advanced cardiology nursing expertise in the ED and chest pain clinic. The advanced nurse referred more patients who were diagnosed with coronary disease, reflecting the expertise, experience, and efficiency of the advanced cardiology nurse-led service.\n\nHow to Diagnose and Treat Functional Chest Pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nRemes-Troche, Jose M\n\n2016-12-01\n\nChest pain that is not explained by reflux disease or cardiac, musculoskeletal, mucosal, or motor esophageal abnormalities is classified as functional chest pain (FCP). Although several mechanisms are involved, esophageal hypersensitivity plays a major role and it could be considered a biomarker for FCP. Psychologic comorbidity such as anxiety, neuroticism, depression, and somatization is common. When the diagnosis of FCP is suspected, patients should undergo evaluation with esophageal motility testing, endoscopy, 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, and in some cases, sensory tests. Once the diagnosis of FCP has been established, treatment options rely on controlling patients' symptoms. Medical treatment has focused predominantly on medications that target pain, such as antidepressants and other pain neuromodulators. Non-pharmacologic interventions with complementary behavioral treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and hypnosis, have recently been recognized as useful in FCP patients. The latest findings on the evaluation and treatment of FCP are outlined herein.\n\nResource reduction in pediatric chest pain: Standardized clinical assessment and management plan.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaleeb, Susan F; McLaughlin, Sarah R; Graham, Dionne A; Friedman, Kevin G; Fulton, David R\n\n2018-01-01\n\nUsing a Standardized Clinical Assessment and Management Plan (SCAMP) for pediatric patients presenting to clinic with chest pain, we evaluated the cost impact associated with implementation of the care algorithm. Prior to introduction of the SCAMP, we analyzed charges for 406 patients with chest pain, seen in 2009, and predicted 21% reduction of overall charges had the SCAMP methodology been used. The SCAMP recommended an echocardiogram for history, examination, or ECG findings suggestive of a cardiac etiology for chest pain. Resource utilization was reviewed for 1517 patients (7-21 years) enrolled in the SCAMP from July 2010 to April 2014. Compared to the 2009 historic cohort, patients evaluated by the SCAMP had higher rates of exertional chest pain (45% vs 37%) and positive family history (5% vs 1%). The SCAMP cohort had fewer abnormal physical examination findings (1% vs 6%) and abnormal electrocardiograms (3% vs 5%). Echocardiogram use increased in the SCAMP cohort compared to the 2009 historic cohort (45% vs 41%), whereas all other ancillary testing was reduced: exercise stress testing (4% SCAMP vs 28% historic), Holter (4% vs 7%), event monitors (3% vs 10%), and MRI (1% vs 2%). Total charges were reduced by 22% ($822Â 625) by use of the Chest Pain SCAMP, despite a higher percentage of patients for whom echocardiogram was recommended compared to the historic cohort. The Chest Pain SCAMP effectively streamlines cardiac testing and reduces resource utilization. Further reductions can be made by algorithm refinement regarding echocardiograms for exertional symptoms.

Ultrasound-assisted evaluation can potentially be used to rapidly and accurately arrive at the correct diagnosis. We propose an organized, ultrasound assisted evaluation of the patient with chest pain using a combination of ultrasound, echocardiography and clinical parameters. Basic echo techniques which can be mastered by residents in a short time are used plus standardized clinical questions and examination. Information is kept on a checklist. We hypothesize that this will result in a quicker, more accurate evaluation of chest pain in the ED leading to timely treatment and disposition of the patient, less provider anxiety, a reduction in the number of diagnostic errors, and the removal of false assumptions from the diagnostic process.

Negative affect (NA) has been associated with increased pain reporting and positive affect (PA) with decreased pain reporting, but these psychological factors have not been examined within the context of myocardial ischemia. This study evaluated the associations between PA, NA, and chest pain reporting in patients with and without ischemia during exercise testing. A total of 246 patients referred for myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography exercise stress testing completed the positive and negative affect schedule-expanded version, a measure of PA and NA. Presence of chest pain and myocardial ischemia were evaluated using standardized protocols. Logistic regression analyses revealed that for every 1-point increase in NA, there was a 13% higher chance for ischemic patients (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02 to 1.26) and an 11% higher chance in nonischemic patients (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.19) to report chest pain. A significant interaction of PA and NA on chest pain reporting (Î² = 0.02; 95% CI = 0.002 to 0.031) was also observed; nonischemic patients with high NA and PA reported more chest pain (57%) versus patients with low NA and low PA (13%), with high NA and low PA (17%), and with high PA and low NA (7%). Patients who experience higher NA are more likely to report experiencing chest pain. In patients without ischemia, high NA and PA was also associated with a higher likelihood of reporting chest pain. Results suggest that high levels of PA as well as NA may increase the experience and/or reporting of chest pain.\n\nChest pain emergency centers: improving acute myocardial infarction care.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrnato, J P\n\n1999-08-01\n\nUncertainty and delay are common in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In the last 20 years, the need for faster, more accurate, and more cost-effective diagnosis gave rise to the concept of specialized treatment of patients with chest pain in emergency departments (EDs). The original strategy dedicated a separate section of the ED and a nursing staff to the task of rapid intervention in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and triage of low-risk patients. Chest pain centers grew quickly in popularity but evolved with a variety of goals, staffing plans, diagnostic resources, and levels of commitment. There existing centers--the University of Cincinnati Heart ER, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and the Medical College of Virginia--have implemented chest pain strategies with the common aims of (1) screening for the entire spectrum of coronary artery disease, (2) avoiding unnecessary admissions, and (3) using multiple diagnostic modalities. Yet, they differ in the specifics of their approaches and diagnostic methods (e.g., echocardiography vs. treadmill vs. myocardial perfusion imaging). The safety and cost effectiveness of these centers are discussed.\n\nUse of medical care for chest pain: differences between blacks and whites.\n\nPubMed\n\nStrogatz, D S\n\n1990-03-01\n\nData from a 1980, community-based survey of adult residents of Edgecombe County, North Carolina were analyzed to examine differences between Blacks and Whites in the reported use of medical care after experiencing chest pain. Of all adults (N = 302) with chest pain in the year prior to interview, 49 percent of Blacks and 27 percent of Whites did not see a physician following the chest pain (difference = 22%, 95% CI = 12, 33). A multivariable analysis found that although the association between race and utilization was reduced at poverty levels of income, it was not explained by differences in demographic characteristics, health status or other dimensions of access to care.\n\nApproach to chest pain and acute myocardial infarction.\n\nPubMed\n\nPandie, S; Hellenberg, D; Hellig, F; Ntsekhe, M\n\n2016-03-01\n\nPatient history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac biomarkers are key components of an effective chest pain assessment. The first priority is excluding serious chest pain syndromes, namely acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax. On history, the mnemonic SOCRATES (Site Onset Character Radiation Association Time Exacerbating/relieving factor and Severity) helps differentiate cardiac from non-cardiac pain. On examination, evaluation of vital signs, evidence of murmurs, rubs, heart failure, tension pneumothoraces and chest infections are important. A 12-lead ECG should be interpreted within 10 minutes of first medical contact, specifically to identify ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). High-sensitivity troponins improve the rapid rule-out of myocardial infarction (MI) and confirmation of non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). ACS (STEMI and NSTEMI/unstable anginapectoris (UAP)) result from acute destabilisation of coronary atheroma with resultant complete (STEMI) or subtotal (NSTEMI/UAP) thrombotic coronary occlusion. The management of STEMI patients includes providing urgent reperfusion: primary percutaneous coronary intervention(PPCI) if available, deliverable within 60 - 120 minutes, and fibrinolysis if PPCI is not available. Essential adjunctive therapies include antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors), anticoagulation (heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin) and cardiac monitoring.\n\nUse of medical care for chest pain: differences between blacks and whites.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStrogatz, D S\n\n1990-01-01\n\nData from a 1980, community-based survey of adult residents of Edgecombe County, North Carolina were analyzed to examine differences between Blacks and Whites in the reported use of medical care after experiencing chest pain.

We sought to examine psychological symptoms in youngsters with medically unexplained chest pain. We hypothesized that children and adolescents with medically unexplained chest pain would have high rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms. We assessed 65 youngsters with noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) and 45 comparison youngsters with benign heart murmurs using self-report measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms and anxiety sensitivity. Compared with the asymptomatic benign-murmur group, youngsters with NCCP had higher levels of some anxiety symptoms and anxiety sensitivity. Differences on depressive symptoms were not significant. Though preliminary, results suggest that youngsters with chest pain may experience increased levels of some psychological symptoms. Future studies of noncardiac chest pain in youngsters should include larger samples and comprehensive diagnostic assessments as well as long-term follow-up evaluations.\n\nChest pain, panic disorder and coronary artery disease: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoares-Filho, GastÃ£o L F; Arias-CarriÃ³n, Oscar; Santulli, Gaetano; Silva, Adriana C; Machado, Sergio; Valenca, Alexandre M; Nardi, Antonio E\n\n2014-01-01\n\nChest pain may be due benign diseases but often suggests an association with coronary artery disease, which justifies a quick search for medical care. However, some people have anxiety disorder with symptoms that resemble clearly an acute coronary syndrome. More specifically, during a panic attack an abrupt feeling of fear accompanied by symptoms such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, makes patients believe they have a heart attack and confuse physicians about the diagnosis. The association between panic disorder and coronary artery disease has been extensively studied in recent years and, although some studies have shown anxiety disorders coexisting or increasing the risk of heart disease, one causal hypothesis is still missing. The aim of this systematic review is to present the various ways in which the scientific community has been investigating the relation between chest pain, panic disorder and coronary artery disease.\n\nDevelopment of quality metrics for ambulatory pediatric cardiology: Chest pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Jimmy C; Bansal, Manish; Behera, Sarina K; Boris, Jeffrey R; Cardis, Brian; Hokanson, John S; Kakavand, Bahram; Jedeikin, Roy\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAs part of the American College of Cardiology Adult Congenital and Pediatric Cardiology Section effort to develop quality metrics (QMs) for ambulatory pediatric practice, the chest pain subcommittee aimed to develop QMs for evaluation of chest pain. A group of 8 pediatric cardiologists formulated candidate QMs in the areas of history, physical examination, and testing. Consensus candidate QMs were submitted to an expert panel for scoring by the RAND-UCLA modified Delphi process. Recommended QMs were then available for open comments from all members. These QMs are intended for use in patients 5-18 years old, referred for initial evaluation of chest pain in an ambulatory pediatric cardiology clinic, with no known history of pediatric or congenital heart disease. A total of 10 candidate QMs were submitted; 2 were rejected by the expert panel, and 5 were removed after the open comment period. The 3 approved QMs included: (1) documentation of family history of cardiomyopathy, early coronary artery disease or sudden death, (2) performance of electrocardiogram in all patients, and (3) performance of an echocardiogram to evaluate coronary arteries in patients with exertional chest pain. Despite practice variation and limited prospective data, 3 QMs were approved, with measurable data points which may be extracted from the medical record. However, further prospective studies are necessary to define practice guidelines and to develop appropriate use criteria in this population.

All patients were sent a postal questionnaire for symptom evaluation. All patients in western Sweden on the waiting list in September 1990 who had been referred for coronary angiography or coronary revascularisation (n = 904). 88% of the patients reported chest pain symptoms that limited their daily activities to a greater or lesser degree. Various psychological symptoms including anxiety and depression were strongly associated with the severity of pain (P < 0.001), as were sleep disturbances (P < 0.001), and dyspnoea and various psychosomatic symptoms (P < 0.001). Nevertheless only 44% of the patients reported chest pain as the major disruptive symptom, whereas the remaining 56% reported uncertainty about the future, fear, or unspecified symptoms as being the most disturbing. In a consecutive series of patients on the waiting list for possible coronary revascularisation, half the participants reported that uncertainty and fear were more disturbing than chest pain.\n\nStress Tests for Chest Pain: When You Need an Imaging Test -- and When You Don't\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

The HEART score is designed for rapid risk stratification of ED chest pain patients using the following criteria: history, electrocardiogram, age, risk factors, and troponin. It has been shown to be superior in identifying patients with low (HEART score 0-3) and high (7-10) risk of major adverse cardiac events, who can then be rapidly discharged or admitted for intervention. This retrospective review and assessment sought to evaluate the efficacy of implementation of a Chest Pain Center (CPC) at a predominantly Asian-based community hospital in the United States. Additionally, this assessment sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a HEART protocol in the first 4 months after its adoption. The facility implemented the CPC, an observation unit, in October 2016. ED physicians risk stratified patients using the HEART score. The guidelines allow ED physicians to stratify patients into 3 categories: to discharge low-risk patients, observe moderate-risk patients in the CPC, and admit high-risk patients. Patients in the CPC received additional diagnostic work-up under the care of ED physicians and cardiologists for less than 24 hours. In addition, CPC patients were followed-up 2 and 30 days after discharge. A total of 172 patients presented at the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain. The majority of the patients were classified into the moderate-risk group (n = 101). Low-risk patients spent significantly less hours in the hospital than the moderate- and high-risk groups, and the high-risk group spent more time in the hospital than the moderate-risk group. The staff followed-up with 74 CPC patients through telephone calls to assess if patients were still experiencing chest pain and if they had followed-up with a cardiologist or primary care physician.

Because of the increased number of patients with hemoptysis in certain periods of the year, we aimed to investigate whether atmospheric changes have an effect on the development of hemoptysis with or without a secondary cause. The data of patients presenting with hemoptysis between January 2006 and December 2011 were analyzed. Data on the daily atmospheric pressure (hectopascal, hPa), relative humidity (%), and temperature ((o) C) during that time were obtained. A total of 232 patients with hemoptysis, 145 male (62.5%) and 87 female (37.5%) with an average age of 48.1(Â±17.6), were admitted to our hospital between 2006 and 2011. The highest admission rates were in the spring season, the highest in May (n=37, 15.9%), and the lowest admission rates were in December (n=10, 4.3%). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the number of hemoptysis cases and mean atmospheric pressure but no relative humidity or outdoor temperature. Hemoptysis is very much influenced by weather factors; in particular, low atmospheric pressures significantly affect the development of hemoptysis. Fluctuations in atmospheric pressure may also play a role in hemoptysis.\n\nPrognosis of undiagnosed chest pain: linked electronic health record cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nJordan, Kelvin P; Timmis, Adam; Croft, Peter; van der Windt, Danielle A; Denaxas, Spiros; GonzÃ¡lez-Izquierdo, Arturo; Hayward, Richard A; Perel, Pablo; Hemingway, Harry\n\n2017-04-03\n\nObjective Â To ascertain long term cardiovascular outcomes in patients whose chest pain remained undiagnosed six months after first presentation. Design Â Cohort study. Setting Â UK electronic health record database (CALIBER) linking primary care, secondary care, coronary registry, and death registry information. Participants Â 172â180 adults aged â¥18 from 223 general practices presenting with a first episode of recorded chest pain, classified from medical records as diagnosed (non-coronary condition or angina) or undiagnosed (cause unattributed) at first consultation between 2002 and 2009 and with no previous record of cardiovascular disease. Main outcome measures Â Fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events over 5.5 years' follow-up. Adjustments were made for age, sex, deprivation, body mass index, smoking status, year of index presentation, and previous records of diabetes or hypertension or previous prescriptions for lipid lowering drugs. Results Â At the index presentation, 72.4% of patients (124â688) did not have a cause attributed for their chest pain; 118â687 (95.2%) of these did not receive any type of cardiovascular diagnosis over the next six months. Only a minority of patients in all three groups (non-coronary 2.0% (769 of 39â232); unattributed 11.7% (14â582 of 124â688); angina 31.5% (2606 of 8260)) had a recorded cardiac diagnostic investigation in the first six months after presentation. The long term incidence of cardiovascular events was higher in those whose chest pain remained unattributed after six months (5126 of 109â628; 4.7%) compared with patients with an initial diagnosis of non-coronary pain (1073 of 36â097; 3.0%) (adjusted hazard ratios for 0.5-1 year after presentation: 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.66 to 2.31; for 1-3 years: 1.35, 1.23 to 1.48); for 3-5.5 years: 1.21, 1.08 to 1.37).

These lesions can be a source of chronic, often disabling with daily discomfort resulting limitation of some activities. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of this phenomenon in order to improve the quality of early care. Through an observational retrospective cohort study on a number of 41Â patients supported and monitored for traumatic rib fractures at the Military Hospital of Meknes during the period from October 2010 to March 2016. The circumstances of the accident were dominated by accidents of public roads (86%) and concerned the young adult male. Radiographs have enumerated 165Â fracture lines with an average of 4Â rib fractures per patient. These were unilateral fractures in 88% of cases, and concerned the means arc in 46% of cases. The rib fracture was undisplaced fracture in 39% of patients, whereas in 2Â patients, a flail chest was present. Post-traumatic hemothorax (63% of cases) were the thoracic lesions most commonly associated with rib fractures. The initial management consisted in the use of analgesics systemically in all patients. The retrospective evaluation of pain by the verbal scale was possible in 30Â patients. The persistent pain was noted in 60% of cases. This pain was triggered by a simple effort to moderate in 55% of cases, and hard effort in 28% of cases. In 17% of patients, even at rest, the pain occurred intermittently. The impact in terms of disability was mild to moderate in 28% of cases and important in 17%. The neuropathic pain was found in 3Â patients. Therapeutically, the first and second levels of analgesics were sufficient to relieve pain. The neuroleptics were required for 2Â patients. Our study confirms the persistence of chronic painful, sometimes lasting several years after the initial chest trauma. This pain is responsible of disability triggered most often after exercise.

Often a life threatening emergency, it mandates prompt assessment and intervention. Various investigations and management protocols are proposed globally, to advocate a standardized approach towards patients presenting with hemoptysis. It is the etiology, however, that has been known to influence clinical outcome and prognosis. With marked contrast in geographical patterns of pulmonary pathologies, etiological agents for hemoptysis vary over the world. Studies in West, usually demonstrate neoplastic and non-granulomatous causes to be the leading agents for hemoptysis. The diagnostic accuracy of various investigations and efficacy of management alternatives has been established there. Developing nations differ in their burden of diseases of lung. Lack of health resources and initiative often prevent quality research in critical areas. This is a retrospective observational study with a cross-sectional design in which charts of all patients admitted with the presentation of haemoptysis in the past ten years will be reviewed, at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. A series of variables, based on previous literature on haemoptysis related to the objectives of present study, will be determined in the study. Demographics, co-morbids and etiology will be determined. Findings of various investigation modalities and their accuracy in localizing the bleeding site will be determined. Efficacy of different management strategies will also be observed. Also observed will be any complications and follow-up. Pakistan is a third world nation of over 150 million, established as highly endemic for pulmonary tuberculosis. To date no study has been generated to look into hemoptysis patterns, in this nation. Lack of evidence based medicine poses a major hindrance towards confident decision-making in the approach towards a patient presenting with hemoptysis in this country.

METHODS We studied individuals who were consecutively admitted to our Chest Pain Unit. At admission, investigators performed a standardized interview and recorded 14 chest pain features. Based on these features, a cardiologist who was blind to other clinical characteristics made unstructured judgment of CAD probability, both numerically and categorically. As the reference standard for testing the accuracy of gestalt, angiography was required to rule-in CAD, while either angiography or non-invasive test could be used to rule-out. In order to assess reproducibility, a second cardiologist did the same procedure. RESULTS In a sample of 330 patients, the prevalence of obstructive CAD was 48%. Gestaltâs numerical probability was associated with CAD, but the area under the curve of 0.61 (95%CI: 0.55-0.67) indicated low level of accuracy. Accordingly, categorical definition of typical chest pain had a sensitivity of 48% (95%CI: 40%-55%) and specificity of 66% (95%CI: 59%-73%), yielding a negligible positive likelihood ratio of 1.4 (95%CI: 0.65-2.0) and negative likelihood ratio of 0.79 (95%CI: 0.62-1.02). Agreement between the two cardiologists was poor in the numerical classification (95% limits of agreement = -71% to 51%) and categorical definition of typical pain (Kappa = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.21-0.37). CONCLUSION Clinical judgment based on a combination of chest pain features is neither accurate nor reproducible in predicting obstructive CAD in the acute setting.

This study investigates the association between chest pain (specified, unspecified or musculoskeletal) and prodromes (dyspepsia, fatigue or dyspnoea), with first-ever acute CAD, and increased longer term cardiovascular risk. Cohort study. Anonymised clinical data recorded electronically by general practitioners from 140 primary care surgeries in London (UK) between April 2008 and April 2013. Data were extracted for all patients aged 30â years and over at the beginning of the study period, registered in the surgeries. Clinical data included chest pain, dyspepsia, dyspnoea and fatigue, first-ever CAD and long-term cardiovascular risk (QRisk2). Regression models were used to analyse the association between chest pain together with prodromes and CAD and QRisk2â¥20%. 354,052 patients were included in the study. 4842 patients had first-ever CAD of which 270 reported chest pain in the year before the acute event. 257,019 patients had QRisk2 estimations. Chest pain was associated with a higher risk of CAD. HRs: 21.12 (16.68 to 26.76), p<0.001; 7.51 (6.49 to 8.68), p<0.001; and 1.84 (1.14 to 3.00), p<0.001 for specified, unspecified and musculoskeletal chest pain. Dyspepsia, dyspnoea or fatigue was also associated with a higher risk of CAD. Chest pain of all subtypes, dyspepsia and dyspnoea were also associated with an increased 10-year cardiovascular risk of 20% or more. All patients with chest pain, including those with atypical symptoms, require careful assessment for acute and longer term cardiovascular risk. Prodromes may have independent diagnostic value in the estimation of cardiovascular disease risk. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of biofeedback in the treatment of patients with functional esophageal disorders. In this prospective study, patients with typical/atypical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease underwent upper endoscopy and 24-h pH monitoring. All patients filled out gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Symptom, Hospital Anxiety and Depression, and Symptom Stress Rating questionnaires. Patients with functional heartburn and those with functional chest pain were offered biofeedback treatment. A global assessment questionnaire was filled out at the end of treatment and then 2.8 (range 1-4) years later. From January 2006 to December 2009, 22 patients with functional esophageal diseases were included in the study. Thirteen had functional heartburn and nine had functional chest pain. Six patients from each group received biofeedback treatment. After treatment for 1-4 years, patients with functional chest pain showed significant improvements in symptoms compared with those who were not treated. Patients with functional heartburn showed no improvement. Patients with functional chest pain had a longer time of esophageal acid exposure than those with functional heartburn. Patients with functional chest pain have different central and intraesophageal factors associated with symptom generation in comparison with patients with functional heartburn. Biofeedback is a useful tool in the treatment of patients with functional chest pain, but not for those with functional heartburn.\n\nIneffective and prolonged apical contraction is associated with chest pain and ischaemia in apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nStephenson, Edward; Monney, Pierre; Pugliese, Francesca; Malcolmson, James; Petersen, Steffen E; Knight, Charles; Mills, Peter; Wragg, Andrew; O'Mahony, Constantinos; Sekhri, Neha; Mohiddin, Saidi A\n\n2018-01-15\n\nTo investigate the hypothesis that persistence of apical contraction into diastole is linked to reduced myocardial perfusion and chest pain. Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy predominantly of the apex. Hyperdynamic contractility resulting in obliteration of the apical cavity is often present. Apical HCM can lead to drug-refractory chest pain. We retrospectively studied 126 subjects; 76 with apical HCM and 50 controls (31 with asymmetrical septal hypertrophy (ASH) and 19 with non-cardiac chest pain and culprit free angiograms and structurally normal hearts). Perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) scans were assessed for myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRi), late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), LV volumes (muscle and cavity) and regional contractile persistence (apex, mid and basal LV). In apical HCM, apical MPRi was lower than in normal and ASH controls (p<0.05). In apical HCM, duration of contractile persistence was associated with lower MPRi (p<0.01) and chest pain (p<0.05). In multivariate regression, contractile persistence was independently associated with chest pain (p<0.01) and reduced MPRi (p<0.001). In apical HCM, regional contractile persistence is associated with impaired myocardial perfusion and chest pain. As apical myocardium makes limited contributions to stroke volume, apical contractility is also largely ineffective. Interventions to reduce apical contraction and/or muscle mass are potential therapies for improving symptoms without reducing cardiac output. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The relationship between air pollution and exacerbation of respiratory diseases is well established. Nevertheless, its association with hemoptysis has been poorly investigated. This paper describes the relationship of air pollutants with severe hemoptysis. Methods. All consecutive subjects with severe hemoptysis during a 5-year period were included. The relationship between the contamination measurements and the frequency of embolizations was analyzed using Poisson regressions. In these regressions, the dependent variable was the monthly number of embolizations in a given month and the independent variable was either the concentration of an air contaminant during the same month, the concentration of the air contaminant during the previous month, or the difference between the two. Results. A higher total number of embolizations per month were observed over the months with increases in the concentration of NO. The number of embolizations was 2.0 in the 33 months with no increases in the concentration of NO, 2.1 in the 12 months with small increases, 2.2 in the 5 months with moderate increases, 2.5 in the 4 months with large increases, and 4.0 in the 5 months with very large increases. Conclusion. There is association between hemoptysis and increases in the concentration of atmospheric NO in Badalona (Spain).

The different possibilities for using mechanical, electrical, thermal and chemical methods in visceral pain research are discussed with emphasis of combinations (e.g., the multimodal approach). The methods have been used widely in assessment of pain mechanisms in the esophagus and have contributed to our understanding of the symptoms reported in these patients. Hence abnormal activation and plastic changes of central pain pathways seem to play a major role in the symptoms in some patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease and in patients with functional chest pain of esophageal origin. These findings may lead to an alternative approach for treatment in patients that does not respond to conventional medical or surgical therapy. PMID:16718803\n\nA closer look at the relationships between panic attacks, emergency department visits and non-cardiac chest pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nFoldes-Busque, Guillaume; Denis, Isabelle; Poitras, Julien; Fleet, Richard P; Archambault, Patrick; Dionne, Clermont E\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis study examined the prevalence of emergency department visits prompted by panic attacks in patients with non-cardiac chest pain. A validated structured telephone interview was used to assess panic attacks and their association with the emergency department consultation in 1327 emergency department patients with non-cardiac chest pain. Patients reported at least one panic attack in the past 6âmonths in 34.5âper cent (95% confidence interval: 32.0%-37.1%) of cases, and 77.1âper cent (95% confidence interval: 73.0%-80.7%) of patients who reported panic attacks had visited the emergency department with non-cardiac chest pain following a panic attack. These results indicate that panic attacks may explain a significant proportion of emergency department visits for non-cardiac chest pain.\n\nA community intervention by firefighters to increase 911 calls and aspirin use for chest pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeischke, Hendrika; Diehr, Paula; Rowe, Sharon; Cagle, Anthony; Eisenberg, Mickey\n\n2006-04-01\n\nTo test the effectiveness of an intervention, delivered face-to-face by local firefighters, designed to increase utilization of 911 and self-administration of aspirin for seniors experiencing chest pain. King County, Washington was divided into 126 geographically distinct areas that were randomized to intervention and control areas. A mailing list identified households of seniors within these areas. More than 20,000 homes in the intervention areas were contacted by local firefighters. Data on all 911 calls for chest pain and self-administration of aspirin were collected from the medical incident report form (MIRF). The unit of analysis was the area. Firefighters delivered a heart attack survival kit (that included an aspirin) and counseled participants on the importance of aspirin and 911 use for chest pain. Main outcome measures were 911 calls for chest pain and aspirin ingestion for a chest pain event, obtained from the MIRFs that are collected by emergency medical services personnel for 2 years after the intervention. There were significantly more calls (16%) among seniors on the mailing list in the intervention than control areas in the first year after the intervention. Among the seniors who were not on the mailing list, there was little difference in the intervention and control areas. The results were somewhat sensitive to the analytical model used and to an outlier in the treatment group. A community-based firefighter intervention can be effective in increasing appropriate response to symptoms of a heart attack among elders.\n\nInflammation and Rupture of a Congenital Pericardial Cyst Manifesting Itself as an Acute Chest Pain Syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nAertker, Robert A; Cheong, Benjamin Y C; Lufschanowski, Roberto\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe present the case of a 63-year-old woman with a remote history of supraventricular tachycardia and hyperlipidemia, who presented with recurrent episodes of acute-onset chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of acute coronary syndrome. A chest radiograph revealed a prominent right-sided heart border. A suspected congenital pericardial cyst was identified on a computed tomographic chest scan, and stranding was noted around the cyst.
