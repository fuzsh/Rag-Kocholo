Born in Switzerland in 1944, Dieter Moebius has had numerous collaborative projects, such as Kluster with Conrad Schnitzler (renamed Cluster after Schnitzler left) and Harmonia with Michael Rother (both projects also featured Hans-Joachim Roedelius.) Asmus Tietchens – born in Germany in 1947 – has mainly worked solo, starting with musique concrète and later specializing in abstract sound collages. This is the first collaboration between the two men in 32 years, and it’s clear that they haven’t lost their talent for creating obtuse mechanical worlds. One of the shortest tracks – the two-and-a-half minute “Cremon” – kicks the album off with an intimidating atmosphere, sounding like the score for a massive, sprawling, abandoned factory wasteland. It transitions into the nearly 10-minute “Kattrepel,” primarily composed of ever-chugging bass punctuated by an extremely high-frequency tone. Later in the album, ten-and-a-half-minute “Lange Reihe” sounds like a bicycle ride with several alien insects dropping by. “Grimm” is one of my favorites for its busy atmosphere of multi-colored darkness, with buzzes and a fractured melody built on the infectious beat.\n\n[Reviewer: Mark]\n\nOMBRE Believe You Me\n\n(Asthmatic Kitty)\n\nAlready established for their solo work, duo Helado Negro and Julianna Barwick have only known each other since 2009, but they already know how to create a wide-open sound that, at the very least, combines elements of Latin music and dream pop. On their debut together, Barwick’s harmonious, multi-layered vocals create the perfect ethereal ambience alongside Negro’s psych-folk instrumentation. A great demonstration of this is the first single “Cara Falsa,” which uses a tribal-sounding drum pattern, vibrantly warm synth and angelic vocals to sound like an endless sky over a peaceful desert. The two-part “Noche Brilla” opens and closes the album, with the first part using a guitar and horn to underscore Barwick’s heavenly vocals, while the second part is a straightforward acoustic ballad with the same voice – still ethereal – singing poetically romantic lyrics. One unique track, “Weight Those Words” relies on a tight, cozy acoustic sound with vocals from both: Negro’s traditional, down-to-earth Latin singing with Barwick’s distant “ahhh” voice chiming from above. Her circling voice also helps the piano-loop-based “Sense” come into fruition as pure otherworldly beauty.\n\n[Reviewer: Mark]\n\nAs ever, if you’re viewing from a non-drivable distance please check what we have for sale (these titles and more) at http://www.discogs.com/seller/Redscroll.\n\n28th of December 2012 Update of New and Key Restocked Items + Reviews\n\nat Redscroll Records\n\nLPs & 12″s\n\n______________________\n\nAbductee S.D. “Won’t Stand Down”\n\nAcid Problem “Acid Problem”\n\nAltars “Live On Pure Hate”\n\nAnD “Features / Vol 3”\n\nAtkins, Juan “Ohh La La / Electric Jungle / Impulse”\n\nAus-Rotten “The Rotten Agenda”\n\nAutarkeia “Autarkeia”\n\nBalance Of Terror “A Better Tomorrow”\n\nBand Name “Breakfast”\n\nBestial Warlust “Satan’s Fist: Demo ’96”\n\nBible Thumper “Decimation”\n\nBig Fiction “Big Fiction”\n\nBrain F=/= (Brain Flannel) “Sleep Rough”\n\nBrain Tumors “Brain Tumors”\n\nBurial “Truant / Rough Sleeper”\n\nCloud Rat / The Oily Menace / Wolbachia “Cloud Rat / The Oily Menace / Wolbachia”\n\nCloud Rat / Xtra Vomit “Cloud Rat / Xtra Vomit”\n\nCocerell, Joe “Commerce Above All Else / Foundation / Poptones”\n\nDeep Sleep “Turn Me Off”\n\nDistal Ft.

The most crucial elements of their wistful Candyland-on-acid atmosphere are the lush, colorful walls of synth paired with lead vocalist Tobacco’s lush, moody vocoder voice: both are omnipresent here yet again. Tracks such as opener “Windshield Smasher” and “Hairspray Heart” surprised me by setting a groovy rock-and-roll foundation, while “Psychic Love Damage” expresses light-headed romance with delicate strums gliding in a way that reminds me a bit of “Free Bird.” Sweetly textured songs such as “Like a Sundae” and “Dreamsicle Bomb” feel closer to the original, more synth-driven sound that feels like exploring lands made out of totally edible sweets. Closing track “Spraypaint” demonstrates the most resonant expression of love, emphasizing that “I can’t be without you” as the backing synth flourishes like sunlight filling a room.\n\n[Reviewer: Mark]\n\nPAWS Cokefloat!\n\n(Fat Cat)\n\nThis Glasgow, Scotland-based trio’s debut full-length excellently captures their sunny, fittingly lo-fi garage rock. Right from the beginning, lead singer Phillip Taylor sings a catchy, reminiscent tribute to his mother whom he lost to cancer: though he’d “trade anything” to hear her voice again, he finds solace by repeating the sentiment that “life goes on.” The hard-rocking “Bloodline” explores the same theme by recalling that she stays alive because, along with advice, she gave him her nose and eyes. “Homecoming” uses cathartic sarcasm to thank someone ten years after high school, complete with revenge by means of a lead pipe to the teeth. These kinds of tracks let out sadness with youthful, fist-pumping energy; it’s much better than dwelling too much on trying to gain uncomfortable sympathy from others. Taylor, of course, is no stranger to realistic, relatable mood changes: for example, he ladles out slow-simmering angst on the acoustic ballad “Get Bent,” angrily directed toward a thoughtless, destructive father who just can’t seem to listen. He gets the most aggressive on the heavy, to-the-point “Winners Don’t Bleed,” primarily screaming to get someone to shut up.\n\n[Reviewer: Mark]\n\nAs ever, if you’re viewing from a non-drivable distance please check what we have for sale (these titles and more) at http://www.discogs.com/seller/Redscroll.\n\n7th of December 2012 Update of New and Key Restocked Items + Reviews\n\nat Redscroll Records\n\nLPs & 12″s\n\n______________________\n\nAgainst Me! “Reinventing Axl Rose”\n\nApollo Brown / Guilty Simpson “Dice Game” (2LP)\n\nAtoms For Peace “Default”\n\nBig Kitty “Florence” (+ D/L)\n\nBlack Angels, The “Directions To See A Ghost” (3LP)\n\nBlack Kites “Songs Written While Things Were Changing”\n\nBlack Lips “Live At Third Man Records 6-11-2012”\n\nBlissed Out Fatalists “Blissed Out Fatalists: Deranged, Forgotten, Mid-80s LA Pop-Noise Classic!” (Remastered)\n\nBlitz The Ambassador “Stereotype”\n\nBranes “Perfection Condition”\n\nCheap Girls “Giant Orange” (+ D/L)\n\nCTRLS “Centrally Processed Unity E.P.”\n\nD’Angelo “Voodoo” (2LP 180 Gram Ltd.

Mostly known for their folksy/ indie vibe they have switched it up this time. They are now expressing more of an electronic/pop sound that is even more dreamlike and haunting. Their inspirations for this album can include James Blake, Nicolas Jaar, and Apparat. While listening to the dreamlike album I felt myself swaying back and forth to their electronically calming beats. Their beautiful vocals are quiet, yet captivating. Their vocals are like whispers that can be heard in a dreamland. Their lyrics are deep and melancholy. They tell tales of lost love and despair. The album seems to have its ups and downs of emotion throughout. Their lyrics are contradicting; expressing moments of clarity and then moments of cloudiness and despair. All in all, this new album is definitely a new step in a different direction for the duo. Leaving their indie ways behind and starting a whole new feel to their music. So far I can dig it, so let’s see what they come up with next.\n\n[Reviewer: Kacie]\n\nJello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine Shock-U-Py! EP\n\n[Buy Online From RSR]\n\n(Alternative Tentacles)\n\nEver since the Dead Kennedys broke up in 1986 (later reforming in 2001 without him,) Biafra has continued to prove that his fiery, very cool-voiced political observations remain alive through both spoken-word and musical projects. This EP with his latest band is the latter, having released their debut album in 2009. Even though the mainstream media now considers Occupy Wall Street to be unprofitable “old news,” Biafra stands firmly by the still-ongoing movement, saying that it “won’t go away until the problems are fixed.” He, of course, expresses his support for the movement, kicking off with the uptempo 7-minute-and-a-half-minute title track comparing modern-day demands to those of Great Depression victims petitioning FDR. He’s not afraid of impending controversy for criticizing “Barackstar O’Bummer” either, by expressing angry disappointment that it’s “Bush-ness as usual again” with the current president receiving money from banks through “that coin slot on his head.” The record closes with a remix of Biafra’s D.O.A. collaboration “We Occupy,” using a surprisingly bouncy, ska-type sound to encourage the public to fight to “take what’s ours.”\n\n[Reviewer: Mark]\n\nParallel Thought ‎The Art Of Sound\n\n[Buy Online From RSR]\n\n(Parallel Thought Ltd.)\n\nConsidering the new wave of instrumental hip-hop that has been catching on in the hip-hop scene this album is able to fit right in. This album has an electric/ electric hip-hop fusion feel to it. Parallel thought is a very dynamic producer and uses many different genres in his music such as jazz, American Indian flutes, and of course hip-hop instrumentals. This album is full of hip hop beats over funky sounding beats and static vinyl sounds that give it an old school vibe. “Suspended Animation” is my favorite track on the album. On this track Parallel uses flutes over a static hip-hop beat that give an enchanting feeling to the song. This album is a nonstop head mover. If you happen to be a fan of Flying Lotus then you would love Parallel Thought. Along with Flying Lotus, Parallel thought is a beginning to instrumental and experimental hip-hop. With the new technology we are receiving everyday this type of hip-hop is only going to get more explosive. This new album is totally spacey and tropical at the same time. Many of the songs make me feel like I’m floating in space as well as walking through a very trippy tropical forest in the dark of the night. That description might be a little out there for some of you however, play this album and then tell me how you feel.\n\n[Reviewer: Kacie]\n\n30th of November 2012 Update of New and Key Restocked Items + Reviews\n\nat Redscroll Records\n\nLPs & 12″s\n\n______________________\n\nAddison Groove “I Go Boom – DJ Rasad & Doc Daneeka Remixes”\n\nBen, Jorge “Forca Bruta” (180 Gram)\n\nBlakey, Art “Art Blakey And The Jazz Messengers: Moanin'”\n\nBlkout “Total Depravity”\n\nCaspian “You Are The Conductor”\n\nClouds “Tannhauser Acid Works I”\n\nCommodo “Buckwild / Axis”\n\nContainer “LP (2)”\n\nCrushed Butler “Uncrushed” (Fan Club)\n\nDavis, Miles “Live-Evil”\n\nDeal With It “Eyiafjallalokill”\n\nDirty Projectors “About To Die”\n\nDixon, Jack “E / Find Shelter”\n\nDown “Threefold Live: Diary Of A Mad Band” (Trifold Gatefold\n\nDrake, Nick “Demo Collection” Volume 2 (fan club)\n\nDrake, Nick “Demo Collection” Volume 1 (fan club)\n\nEfterklang “Magic Chairs” (+ D/L)\n\nFactory Floor “Remix Series 2”\n\nFlaming Lips, The “Oh My Gawd!!!…” (Clear Vinyl Ltd.

Their charismatic duality beams throughout their upbeat music, with Matt Johnson optimism-filled voice and keyboard backed by Kim Schifino’s energetic drumming. Their fourth album Lightning is another great addition to their catalogue, particularly for demonstrating their versatility with so few instruments. Johnson kicks it off by singing about feeling free to say whatever he wants on the starry-eyed opener “Let’s Go.” The high-speed chiptune-esque “Overexposed” is another excellent standout, with a reference to screaming and shouting, even if the world doesn’t listen. “Tonight” is another favorite as well, focusing on living for the moment without wasting time worrying about what tomorrow brings.\n\n[Reviewer: Mark]\n\nEvangelista In Animal Tongue\n\n(Constellation)\n\nBorn in New York City and currently based in Los Angeles, vocalist-guitarist-composer Carla Bozulich has been recording music since 1982. On the latest album from her Evangelista project, she creates a particularly dark experiment of guitar strumming, uncompromising sampler sounds and, most memorably, her uniquely emphatic voice.\n\nHer complex imagery sets the mood for opener “Artificial Lamb,” which is primarily backed by Sam Mickens’ spacey guitar strumming. The foreboding title track is certainly another standout, with a sound that rises like smoke amidst eerie references to feral life and religion. On “Die Alone” – the only track with every sound created by Bozulich – she creates a creepy, minimalist sound with her mournful voice backed by little more than shimmering, punctuated percussion and ghostly electronic sounds. It feels like being lost in some sort of surreal forest at night, particularly with “Tunnel To The Stars” using doubled-up vocals and a swirling, dissonant multi-string foundation, and the unpredictable “Hatching” going all out with a particularly frightening atmosphere comprised of many layers of very loosely-structured, varied instrument noises and tweaks.\n\n[Reviewer: Mark]\n\n16th Of November 2012 Update of New and Key Restocked Items + Reviews\n\nat Redscroll Records\n\nLPs & 12″s\n\n______________________\n\nAdult “Resuscitation” (Classic 2001 Collection First Time On Vinyl + D/L With Bonus Tracks)\n\nAlexander, Amir “Gutter Flex EP”\n\nAmerican Steel “Rogue’s March”\n\nAndrew Jackson Jihad “Candy Cigarettes Capguns Issue Problems And Such”\n\nAndrew Jackson Jihad “People Who Eat People Are the Luckiest People In The World”\n\nApollo Brown + OC “Trophies” (2LP Gold Vinyl)\n\nAvett Brothers, The “Four Thieves Gone: The Robbinsville Sessions” (3LP 180 Gram + D/L)\n\nBad Brains “Into The Future”\n\nBasement “Colourmeinkindness” (Ltd.

He expresses those melancholy themes in a soft-spoken way by primarily using a delicate piano, acoustic guitar and synth to paint his emotions. For example, the beautiful-sounding piano-and-synth opener “AWOL Marine” was inspired by a homemade adult film featuring a man who admitted he was just doing it to pay for his wife’s medication. Hadreas also sings about how he’s grown weary from loneliness on “Take Me Home” and, judging by his desire for “love with no hiding” on the title track, he takes the nature of his romance very seriously. Other tracks poetically touch on similarly personal subject matter, such as a gay teen using a suicide letter to ask for everything to be taken away (“17.”) Also, in a moving, deeply-layered synth lament, Hadreas contemplates the reality that he and his boyfriend will only be able to embrace in public hesitation-free when “All Waters” are still (he’s still dealing with the issue, as Youtube didn’t allow the “Hood” music video to be used for a 16-second preview ad because of the non-“family safe” seconds-long image him and another man embracing in just underwear.) Overall, he uses this record to clearly demonstrate emotions straight from the heart, and even if people disagree, he just wants them to listen.\n\n[Reviewer: Mark]\n\nYva Las Vegass I Was Born In A Place of Sunshine and The Smell of Ripe Mangoes\n\n(Moniker)\n\n“Passionate” is the key word here: unapologetically referring to herself as a “motherfucker,” Vegass uses just her voice (which she uses to sing, yell and rant) and energetic cuatro-strumming techniques to express her powerful opinions. Born in Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela in 1963, her teenage rebelliousness eventually led her to Seattle, where she and a friend became street performers. Eventually, she got a gig singing at Krist Novoselic’s birthday party, and after Kurt Cobain’s suicide, the two formed the indie/alt-rock band Sweet 75. Despite opening for acts such as Dinosaur Jr. and L7, they didn’t find much success and officially disbanded in 2000 due to “creative differences.” Currently Brooklyn-based, Vegass is back to playing a purely acoustic Latin style, strongly weighing artistic expression over commercialism. Almost the entire record, unsurprisingly, is in Spanish: the exceptions being her questioning why buying crack for white friends earns her the label of a “Crack Whore,” and, on “Pussy In Your Eye,” admitting that she still feels like a loner, just like in fourth grade. She retains a raw, outspoken and genuine sound throughout, especially after years of rough experiences (homelessness, drug addiction, brawling, etc.)\n\n[Reviewer: Mark] [This one should be in within a week.]"
