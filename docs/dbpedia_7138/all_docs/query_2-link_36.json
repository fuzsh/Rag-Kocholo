        "text": "Written By Christy Lee & Atrocifer\n\nThe growls are back!!! Swedish progressive death metal band Opeth’s heavy new song reveals a sound that harkens back to their heavier material. The song, “§1”(Radio Edit) is reminiscent of the old days boasting their signature progressive sound. The guitar riffs feature a tone that resembles their more proggy side but with a heavier dose of gain while the keyboards sweep chromatically, shifting between the chords to create a dissonance thats pleasing to the ear. Drummer Waltteri Väyrynen delivers a syncopated onslaught that blends seamlessly with the music. And to everyone’s delight, Mikael Åkerfeldt’s gutteral vocals are in top form. The fans have been dripping with sweat and anticipation for this day to come.\n\nIt’s invigorating to revisit the greatest death metal vocals ever recorded. After a few listens, it becomes clear that what I truly yearned for from Newpeth was not the growls but rather the eerie, atmospheric essence of the Oldpeth. “Damnation” lacks the growls but retains the haunting quality reminiscent of “Blackwater Park,” while this new material, despite its growls, occasionally feels like an entirely different band.\n\nI’ve cherished “Heritage” since its release. Even without growls, it exudes a sinister aura. It faced unwarranted criticism for its perceived lack of heaviness. I’m delighted to hear the growls reappear in this new track but it’s reassuring to confirm that they alone aren’t the missing ingredient for those craving the essence of old-school Opeth.\n\nI’m enthusiastic about all iterations of Opeth and eagerly anticipate what the forthcoming album will bring. To me, “Watershed” stands as the inaugural Newpeth album, even with its heavy opening tracks. The rest of the album leans into the Newpeth-style prog rock, featuring the Frederik and Axenrot lineup. The album, aptly named “Watershed,” seems to signify not just a division but the very line itself.\n\nThis new song delivers riffs that are much heavier than the last four records, however, the evolution isn’t necessarily a drawback. Reverting to 2008’s sound would have been a missed opportunity. They’ve learned from previous albums and are now blending their influences creatively. Expect a notably dark and intricate journey on this record.\n\n“Last Will and Testament” is a concept album set in the aftermath of WWI steeped with intrigue and shadow. It chronicles the haunting moment when a families late wealthy patriarch’s last will and testament is revealed to his survivors unearthing dark secrets that unravel the lives of his twin children. Amidst this unraveling, a mysterious, polio-stricken orphan girl enters the scene. Her presence adds a chilling layer to the tale.\n\nOpeth is set for a busy summer with European festival appearances before heading to the US. The band has long been known for blending progressive elements into their death metal routine. They have just finished recording their fourteenth studio album, Last Will and Testament, and have released a new track called “§1” (aka ‘Paragraph 1‘), a radio edit with an October 11th release on Reigning Phoenix Music. The the follow-up to 2019’s In Cauda Venenum. The effort was produced by Mikael Åkerfeldt, the vocalist and guitarist of the prog rock/death metal outfit, with additional help from Stefan Boman.\n\nÅkerfeldt also shared some details for the record, offering:\n\n“I have become quite interested in family, and the idea that blood is not always thicker than water. I became interested in how family members can turn on each other. I saw an interview with this guy whose family had all turned against him, over the inheritance, so I wrote a song about that on the last record. The idea stuck with me, and then along came the TV show ‘Succession‘, and I loved that series. That was in the back of my head too. It felt like an interesting topic that you could twist and turn a little bit.”\n\nHe continued:\n\n“‘The Last Will And Testament‘ is a concept record of sorts. A restless musical journey in a way mirroring my own relationship with music as a consumer of it. I pick up something here, dismiss something there. I worship and I hate music at the same time. This ambivalence leads me down some type of creative path of my own and then, all of a sudden, a collection of songs has been written. Best-case scenario, these songs are good enough to impress the band. Good enough for the ‘powers that be’ in terms of the industry. Good enough for ‘you’?!”\n\n“I love this record. I have to say it (write it). Maybe I’m proud, even? There are some familiar ingredients in there, I suppose. Most of our music has sprung from the same source, so I guess it’s not much of a shocker if it’s going to sound like ‘us’.\n\nI’m a bit in awe of what we did with ‘The Last Will And Testament‘. It feels like a dream. There is some coherence and songwriting skills I hope, but what do I know? I tend to favor the strange over the obvious, but I feel like I’m in the minority, and that’s fine. So…fair warning! Don’t expect an instant rush (as per usual), but if you do get it (have you got it yet?) right away, that’s okay too!”\n\nPreorder Last Will And Testament Here:\n\nThe album has guest appearances from Jethro Tull vocalist Ian Anderson, Europe frontman and fellow Swede Joey Tempest and Åkerfeldt‘s teenage daughter Mirjam\n\n“The Last Will And Testament” track listing:\n\n01 – “§1”\n\n02 – “§2”\n\n03 – “§3”\n\n04 – “§4”\n\n05 – “§5”\n\n06 – “§6”\n\n07 – “§7”\n\n08 – “A Story Never Told”\n\nOpeth will headline Bloodstock on Friday, August 9, and continue their European festival tour throughout the summer.

A very grand program of opera and ballet.\n\nOriginating in Ancient Greece with deep roots in Italy, operas are a musical art form that tell stories through singing and can include many different types of operas, such as comedies, romances, and tragedies. Tragedies often end with the death of the protagonist(s), and operas can build to these deaths in many musical ways.\n\nFounded in 2007 in Italy, Fleshgod Apocalypse swiftly rose to prominence in the symphonic death metal genre. They have released five highly praised albums and toured extensively across the globe.\n\nFleshgod Apocalypse’s new album Opera is dripping in decadent opulence. Listening to Opera, makes me feel like the Monopoly man sporting a top hat and monocle while grooving to each track. Let’s dive into this album review before I start planning my next move on Boardwalk.\n\nVeronica Bordacchini’s operatic vocals bring a theater of emotions to every chapter of the album, offering diverse perspectives on Francesco Paoli’s story both musically and lyrically. Her voice masterfully conveys a range of emotions—love, drama, and tragedy. By integrating her vocals into their music, Fleshgod Apocalypse has broken new ground in death metal, pioneering a genre they’ve dubbed “opera metal.”\n\nI must confess I had my doubts about what this album would sound like, but as soon as the first track, “Ode to Art” (De’ Sepolcri), began, I was captivated by Francesco Ferrini’s beautiful piano composition, his impressive string arrangements and orchestral effects. A theme repeated throughout the album. The song also features Veronica’s haunting vocals, which set the stage for the arrival of Paoli’s ferocious death metal growls and dramatic symphonic music. My excitement built as I eagerly anticipated the next track, “I Can Never Die.” I was not disappointed. Paoli’s vocals and lyrics conveyed an intense emotional depth that kept me hooked.\n\nThe third installment on this album, “Pendulum,” kicks off with a blistering guitar solo by Fabio Bartoletti that instantly grabs your attention. His technical skills and explosive riffs set the tone for an electrifying track, making it clear that this album is packed with standout moments.\n\n“Bloodclock” initiates with a captivating blend of classical and folk influences, creating a rich, atmospheric introduction. This intriguing beginning seamlessly transitions into the band’s signature death metal style, combining intricate melodic elements with their trademark intensity and aggression.\n\nAs “At War With My Soul” commences, it evokes an operatic version of “Ave Satani” from The Omen, resembling a Satanic twist on a Gregorian chant with intense black mass vibes. Just 27 seconds in, you’re hit with a nuclear blast of hardcore, face-melting death metal as Paoli’s beastly roar blasts right through you. The effect is like being plunged into a dark, foreboding forest, where every shadow feels menacing and you’re gripped by an overwhelming sense of dread.\n\nThe song “Morphine Waltz” is aptly named, as its content is straightforwardly reflected in its title. The track hits you with a rapid tempo and intense energy. Fabio Bartoletti’s guitar work combines modern classical and progressive elements, resulting in a complex composition. This is further amplified by a symphony of chaos created by the dynamic dual vocals of Paoli and Bordacchini.\n\n“Matricide” is a remarkably progressive track that starts with a dramatic, Phantom of the Opera-inspired flair. It then transitions smoothly through various genres, evolving into symphonic metal before diving into intense death metal. The song effortlessly cycles back to operatic elements, showcasing a masterful blend of styles that keeps listeners engaged and captivated throughout.\n\n“Per Aspera Ad Astra” takes you on a tumultuous journey, with a roller coaster of emotions clearly conveyed through the band’s music. As the heaviest track on the album, it showcases the band’s signature death metal and operatic themes to their fullest extent. The song’s sheer power is undeniable, making it a standout moment on the record.\n\n“Till Death Do Us Part” embarks on an epic journey through life-changing events and painful revelations. This powerful, masculine and feminine anthem is the kind of song that makes you want to hold up your lighter and sway with the audience, fully immersing yourself in its emotional intensity.\n\n“I must highlight the talents of Eugene Ryabchenko, who throughout the album is the heartbeat of the band. His precise drumming and emphatic rhythms drive the entire album forward, much like a finely crafted timepiece.”\n\n“As the final curtain call approaches, the lights dim. A figure in a hooded cloak crosses the stage and takes a seat at the piano. As he begins to play, the melody of the album’s title track, ‘Opera,’ unfolds with delicate notes that transition to a poignant conclusion. The performance conveys a deep sense of melancholy. As the song draws to a close, the man rises and removes his hood revealing Francesco Ferrini. The rest of the band join him and they take a bow. The crowd erupts in applause as the drapery falls.”\n\n“This album exudes sophistication and cultured sound. The blend of brutal gutturals with operatic arias works remarkably well. It showcases the musical style we love about Fleshgod Apocalypse, while introducing something distinctly new. Paoli is raw, unapologetic, and vulnerable in this album, channeling his pain and fear into his art. In my opinion, it’s the band’s magnum opus.”\n\n“The band is planning a tour to support this album. I highly recommend preordering the album and securing tickets to their live performance—it will definitely be worth it!”\n\nOut August 23rd 2024! Preorder Opera Here:\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nOde to Art (De’ Sepolcri)\n\nI Can Never Die Pendulum Bloodclock\n\nAt War With My Soul Morphine Waltz\n\nMatricide\n\nPer Aspera Ad Astra\n\nTill Death Do Us Part\n\nOpera\n\nFLESHGOD APOCALYPSE, renowned Italian symphonic death metal pioneers, return with their highly anticipated sixth album titled “Opera”. This new release, set to debut on August 23 via Nuclear Blast Records, is deeply influenced by a tragic mountain-climbing incident involving their frontman Francesco Paoli in 2021.\n\n“Opera” is structured like a 10-act theatrical piece, aligning with Italy’s rich classical music theater tradition while infusing the intense brutality of death and symphonic metal that defines their signature sound. Produced, mixed, and mastered by Grammy-nominated Jacob Hansen (known for his work with VOLBEAT, EPICA, ARCH ENEMY), the album signifies a significant progression for the band. It incorporates fresh elements into their distinctive blend, characterized by intense aggression, grand orchestrations, and soaring melodies.\n\nThe album’s artwork is equally ambitious, created by emerging Italian talents Felicita Fiorini and Francesco Esposito, drawing inspiration from baroque painters such as Caravaggio and Artemisia Gentileschi. The cover art portrays Veronica as Music, a transcendent force that combats the societal and artistic decay of the modern era.\n\nWhile the world was realing at the onset of a worldwide pandemic in 2021 Fleshgod Apocalypse frontman Francesco Paoli rocked the metal community as we learned of his near fatal tragedy involving a mountain climbing accident. Uncertainty lingered as to what the future held for Fleshgod Apocalypse as Paoli underwent surgery, healing and years of painful physical rehabilitation.\n\nIn 2023, the band emerged back full-force once again commanding audiences on tours throughout Europe, with eyes set on their sixth and brand new album titled “Opera,” to be released this August 2024 and what can be described as their crowning achievement.\n\nPaoli writes:\n\n“The best stories always come from pain, it’s a bitter truth yet undeniable” says Francesco.\n\n“That’s why human struggles have always been an unending source of inspiration for artists throughout history. But one thing is creating art that gives voice to someone else’s tribulations, another is accepting to bare your soul to the world and reveal your weaknesses and frailties, while attempting to turn them into new resources for your own creativity. It’s a dangerous game, since we never know what our twisted mind has in store for us, but it’s a game you must play if you really want to bring your art to the highest level and leave a trace that has a deeper meaning, not just mere entertainment for distracted people.\n\nAfter my fall while mountain climbing, I woke up in a hospital, underwent several surgeries, constantly getting terrible news and spending many months not knowing if I would ever be able to play an instrument again. I felt condemned. Fear, painkillers, wheelchairs have been daily food for my frustration. Retracing what happened that day, as well as the days, months, years after, has been such an exhausting and frightening journey, in which I had to face my demons once again and deal with memories I hoped I had left behind.\n\nWas all this worth it? Let the others tell. All I can say is that, although it was clear that this was the right thing to do, we could not even remotely imagine how strongly this process would have affected our songwriting, igniting our creativity and reinvigorating our attitude after years of deep coma due to the pandemic. We managed to turn one of the worst things in life into a work of art, that embodies our personal and artistic growth and takes the listeners on a rollercoaster of emotions, where they can experience what I’ve been through hand in hand with me. It’s a waking nightmare but that’s how life is sometimes, just scary.”\n\nFrancesco adds:\n\n“In my visionary representation of this journey, that begins with my near death experience and culminates in a much desired physical and psychological rebirth, I wanted to frame every single step of my calvary, as if they were acts of an “Opera Lirica”, with dialogues or even confessions to imaginary characters, who have been constant presences throughout my whole (mis)adventure.\n\nDeath, Life, Hope are among these entities, masterfully interpreted by Veronica, that from time to time assist or prevent me from digging deeper in my memory and personality, examining objectively my emotional states and behaviors and finding a sense to all this.\n\nThis album tosses you in a vortex of discomfort and uncontrollable feelings, where you can experience pain, fear, desperation, anger, frustration, but also resolve, courage, hope and a profound desire for redemption.\n\nIn fact, besides being grateful for the privilege of sharing my personal experience through Fleshgod Apocalypse art, I strongly believe that this album is a solid manifest of resilience, and I hope that my story will inspire people who got “lost” for whatever reason. Since the accident I’ve been posting on socials about my rehab and received hundreds of messages of appreciation for that. People need motivation, need examples that can make them restart believing in themselves. And for me, this is part of the game, this is the best way I can give them something back after all these years of loving support.\n\nLife is a wonderful thing, even when everything around us seems to be falling apart we must find a meaning for existing and, unexpectedly, sometimes second chances can be way more exciting than the first ones.”\n\nBand Lineup:\n\nLine up:\n\nFrancesco Paoli | Vocals, Bass\n\nVeronica Bordacchini | Vocals\n\nFrancesco Ferrini | Piano\n\nFabio Bartoletti | Guitar\n\nEugene Ryabchenko | Drums\n\nVoraath – L-R – Tylor Kohl – Guitar, Paul McBride – Bass, Joshua Ward – Drums, Keys, Vocals, Studio Guitars, Chelsea Marrow – Vocals, Daniel Presnell – Guitar\n\nVol 1: The Hymn of the Hunters Album Review\n\nWritten By Tristan Cardinelli\n\nVoraath, hailing from Asheville, North Carolina, emerges as a force in extreme metal with their debut album, “Vol 1: The Hymn of the Hunters,” out now!\n\nThis album converges the talents of members from Xael, Visitant, Rapheumets Well, Implosive Disgorgence, and Sweet Blood, forging a sound that melds native folk tones with crushing metal riffs. The members collectively are the perfect ingredients forming a recipe destined for success. Joshua Ward’s methodical drumming establishes an otherworldly and demonic pace. Tylor Kohl, Paul McBride, and Daniel Presnell unite as a formidable string section, displaying a savage talent equipt with speed, and agility that harmoniously complements the quintet.\n\nUpon first hearing this album, it’s striking how Chelsea Morrow’s blistering vocals flow like an erupting volcano, challenging any preconceived notions about female-fronted bands. Her powerful voice embodies extreme metal with such force, showcasing an undeniable prowess in a traditionally male-dominated industry.\n\nThe album is about a dystopian world shaped by 80s sci-fi, game lore, and folklore. From the haunting intro of “Into Perdition,” Voraath plunges listeners into the desolate Appalachian landscapes, setting the stage for a narrative-driven chronicle through survival and betrayal. Tracks like “The Road to Samm Hill” and “Waypoint Orion” deepen the saga, each riff and rhythm echoing the perilous quests and ethereal encounters with our protagonists. Chelsea Morrow’s ferocious vocals in “Dreadborn” and the haunting melodies of “The Leviathan’s Keep” showcase Voraath’s ability to weave an intricate account of brutal musicality, creating a cohesive universe that spans dimensions.\n\nThe album’s apex arrives with “The God-Killer Saga,” a grand confrontation that epitomizes Voraath’s prowess in spinning a tale in metal driven story telling. Inspired by Trevor Henderson’s creations, “Sirenhead” adds a chilling horror element, while “Pyrrhic” closes with melancholic introspection, reflecting the trauma endured throughout the hunters’ journey.\n\nVoraath’s “Vol 1: The Hymn of the Hunters” isn’t just an album; it’s a meticulously crafted portal into a nightmarish realm where each track unfolds a new chapter of struggle and revelation. With their blend of brutal aggression and melodic nuance, Voraath sets a new standard in storytelling, promising listeners an immersive experience that transcends genres and challenges the boundaries of a musical literary experience.

With their distinct sound and fiercely provocative lyrics, Rotting Christ’s newest opus is sure to ruffle feathers. Yet, amidst the dissent, black metal enthusiasts are bound to embrace it wholeheartedly.\n\n“Pro Xristou” sees the band continuing their trajectory, embracing clean, melodic baritone vocals infused with their distinctive signature Greek dialect, Benedictine chants, and a plethora of pinch harmonics. If you’ve found resonance in Rotting Christ’s later works like “Rituals” and “The Heretics,” this album will undoubtedly captivate you. The journey begins with the slow, atmospheric title track, setting the stage for what’s to come.\n\n“The Apostate” follows suit, blending melody with choral elements and spoken word passages by Sakis Tolis, creating a breathtaking sonic experience.\n\n“Like Father, Like Son” elevates the majesty further, transporting listeners to the breathtaking vistas of ancient Greece, while tracks like “The Sixth Day” provoke contemplation with their blend of beauty and religious critique.\n\nAs the album progresses, darker tones emerge with tracks like “La Lettera Del Diavolo” and “The Farewell,” taking listeners on an emotional rollercoaster. However, it’s “Pix Lax Dax” that stands out, with its subtle time changes, haunting squeal technique, and captivating chorus.\n\n“Pro Xristou” solidifies Rotting Christ’s place in the metal pantheon, showcasing a renewed energy and confidence. Bonus tracks like “Saoirse,” “Primal Resurrection,” and “All for One” add further depth to an already impressive offering.\n\nDespite their extensive discography and decades-long career, Rotting Christ remains at the top of their game by stretching limits and defying expectations.\n\nPro Xristou is steeped in fervent dissent against conventional religious dogma, echoing with subversive undertones and incisive critiques of established faith.\n\nSakis Tolis, the vocalist and guitarist, who has been one of the primary songwriters and driving forces behind the group, has propelled their career over decades.\n\n“Pro Xristou” may not reinvent the wheel, but it’s a testament to the band’s enduring legacy and unwavering dedication to their craft. Whether you’re a longtime fan or new to their music, Rotting Christ’s “Pro Xristou” is a captivating journey into the heart of Greek black metal. And remember, if you ever get the chance, experiencing Rotting Christ live is an absolute must.\n\nPro Xristou is out now! Friday May 24th, on Season of Mist.\n\nListen to Pro Xristou:\n\nPre-order\n\nhttps://redirect.season-of-mist.com/RottingChristProXristou\n\nPre-save\n\nhttps://orcd.co/proxtristoupresave\n\nTrack-list\n\n1.

Sakis Tholis and his brother Themis started this band together back in 1987. In the three decades since, these Greek titans have left their blackened imprint all over the metal world. They’ve released 13 studio albums and played more than 1,300 concerts around the globe. Underneath all this hard work, Rotting Christ have but one vision – an urge to not only push the boundaries of extreme metal, but to keep reinventing themselves along the way.\n\nRotting Christ’s evolution has unfolded across several distinct chapters. After starting out closer to the barely controlled chaos of grindcore, they went on to establish the iconic sound of Hellenic black metal. Their albums often embrace refined gothic soundscapes, only to plunge back into the depths of blasphemous fervour. Each chapter marked another, further exploration, and an unwavering commitment to push boundaries.\n\nBut the real turning point came in 2007, when Rotting Christ signed a pact with Season of Mist. They unleashed a series of albums for the French label that defied any and all expectations. From the piercing Theogonia and the symphonic grandeur of Aelo to the ritualistic intensity of Κατά Τον Δαίμονα Εαυτού, the cinematic experiences created by Rotting Christ became a spectacle of bombastic atmospheres, mesmerizing choirs, and neo-classical arrangements. The unexpected is their modus operandi, with the use of various languages (Latin, Arabic, Greek, English) as well as the extensive use of famous poetry woven into their music, like Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘The Raven’ on The Heretics.\n\nIn 2019, Rotting Christ’s epic journey continued with The Apocryphal Spell compilation, which offers fans an intimate glimpse into unreleased and rare material. This allowed them to gather strength, preparing for the release of their next, highly anticipated, 14th full-length studio album: Pro Xristou.\n\nPro Xristou (‘Before Christ’ in Greek), serves as a fervent tribute to the last Pagan kings who resisted the onslaught of Christianity, guarding their ancient values and knowledge. In this thematic odyssey, intricately woven through tracks such as ‘The Apostate’ and ‘Ygdrassil’, Rotting Christ delves into the legacies of historical figures such as Flavius Claudius Julianus and Nordic mythological kings, embodying the might of Pagan wisdom in the face of Christian adversity. The album encapsulates the essence of Rotting Christ’s signature style – melodic, yet harsh at times – reinventing themselves yet again, while remaining rooted in their 35-year legacy.\n\nLine-up\n\nSakis Tolis – Guitar, Vocals\n\nThemis Tolis – Drums\n\nKostas “Spades” Heliotis – Bass\n\nKostis Fouk – Guitar\n\nGuest Musicians\n\nAmdroniki Skoula – Vocals (on ‘La Letra Del Diavolo’)\n\nNikos Kerkiras – Keyboard\n\nChristina Alexiou – Choir\n\nMaria Tsironi – Choir\n\nAlexandros Loyziotis – Choir\n\nVasilis Karatzas – Choir\n\nAndrew Liles – Narration (on ‘The Apostate’, ‘Pretty World, Pretty Dies’)\n\nKim Diaz Holm – Narration (on ‘Ygdrassil’)\n\nRecording Studio\n\nDeva Sounds Studios (Athens, Greece)\n\nProducer\n\nSakis TolisSound Engineer\n\nFotis Bernando\n\nAggelos Karatzas\n\nMixing\n\nJens Borgen at Fascination Street Studios (Örebro, Sweden)\n\nMastering\n\nTony Lidgren at Fascination Street Studios (Örebro, Sweden)\n\nArtwork Artists\n\nThomas Cole – Artwork\n\nAdrien Bousson – Digital Processing\n\nBiography\n\nSébastien J.

We know what to expect and can find solace in homogeneity. This often applies to the music we listen to, something that follows a distinct style or sound that can make one feel gratification. Originality and personality can be and usually will be sacrificed for an indifferent but pleasing sound to feed this appetite.\n\nBelgium’s Aborted have always been a band that were “style over substance” as in whilst offering nothing new to the death metal spectrum, do add a direct-on-target sound that utilizes the influences from Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse & Carcass that quenches that grim death metal thirst. I very much doubt Sven ever set out to redirect or reinterpret the genre but to just play brutal and intransigent music which has been accomplished album after album.\n\n“Vault of Horrors” is an album comprised of drummer driven death metal. It is as fast paced and as frantic as any other current death metal sound. I am in no shape or form calling Aborted generic, but the riffs presented here are formulaic. Lots of tritone power chords & tremolo littered with syncopated chugging that draws a good amount of influence from the current deathcore sound sprinkled in with technical showmanship and the typical melodies used in most extreme metal. Not riff devoid by any means, however it is very paint-by-numbers in terms of songwriting and with the clean and very modern production does not help with differentiation from other similar acts. This is not a critique but more so an observation of the current extreme music scene what with bands using the same instrument brands, tunings and amp pre-sets. It all has a great sound however leaves a lot more to be desired in originality or ingenuity.\n\nOne of the main selling points for this release was that all 10 tracks (not including the bonus song) feature a well-known guest vocalist. I have always found that the most unique feature of Aborted’s music was frontman Sven’s vocals. He, alongside other belching greats Frank Mullens and George “Corpsegrinder” Fisher, have very distinct styles & sounds. I have heard songs he has guested on without knowing and was able to pick that it is him which should display my reverence for his voice. Kicking the thesaurus aside and just stating it – he’s an awesome vocalist. Everyone else is great too. However, hearken back to my point on the production and writing, these songs could have been written by the guests bands themselves. Eric from Despised Icon does his vocals over a slam riff and isn’t too different sounding from his own band, same with Oliver from Archspire, his section could be either Aborted or Archspire and this echoes for a good portion of the guest spots here (Fleshgod & Cryptopsy are exceptions to the rule). Despite this, it is understandable that the album would have these features as all these bands are touring brothers, and it would help bring in new fans.\n\nIn short, this album is a solid slab of death metal; did you really come in expecting more than that? Songs like “The Shape of Hate”, “Death Cult” & the grindy “Insect Politics” still batter your ear drums effortlessly. Solid but not stellar, safe but not stagnant.\n\nORDER VAULT OF HORRORS HERE:\n\n1.Dreadbringer (feat. Shadow Of Intent)\n\n2.Condemned To Rot (feat. Francesco Paoli)\n\n3.Brotherhood Of Sleep (feat.

Yes Poland, Sweden & Germany are top contenders HOWEVER it cannot be overstated how high quality and quantity the Czech scene truly is. With festivals like Obscene Extreme, Thirst For Grind, Groove & Stinky, Metalgate Czech Death etc and bands like Alienation Mental, Melancholy Pessimism, Jig-Ai, Lykathea Aflame etc Czechia has cemented itself the home base for extreme metal and punk.\n\nNeedful Things are a 20+ years veteran status grind band with a 15 split & 3 full length album discography. The band’s chosen style is fast-paced metallic grind with a hefty death metal groove. Picture post-Earache era Napalm Death, “Murderer” era Rotten Sound and the entire Nasum catalogue. This style of grindcore is great because even at its most unoriginal form, will still provide an aesthetically pleasing sound. It’s that freight-train, “no holds barred/stop for no bitch” adrenaline pumping grind that gets your fist pumping and your legs running in a circular fashion. The riffs are a solid take on death metal forward grind and the aforementioned death metal grooves which still contain a frantic persona due to the incredibly adequate and supersonic drumming. Songs like the album title, “Constricted” & “Fallen Into Darkness” flow together effortlessly compiling of aggressive 2000’s era grindcore riffs that both punch and grab you, no time for powerviolence/hardcore/sludge metal breakdowns or brutal slams, just fast tremolo and chorded riffs, with the intro of “Party of Killers…” having the slowest groove on the entire album. Once again I have to commend the drummer for his technique and skill, the drums are very much so the spine for all present songs.\n\nOne thing that definitely requires highlighting is the recording & production. It sits perfectly within the boundaries of a crisp, clear yet bass heavy production with all instruments shining brightly, yet still sounds organic and like an actual live band. You could tell me that the album was recorded live or layered and I would believe it. This gives the listeners an easy-to-digest production whilst also giving of an authentic feel. I would put this album as having one of the better productions in the grind genre, it’s that good! Now former vocalist Tomas has a pretty rambunctious vocabulary. His style alternates between the echoed screams (not unlike JR of Pig Destroyer) and your more typical death bellows which, whilst don’t go too deep or guttural, are a fit for the unrelenting barrage of blasting discourse. Of course the lyrics take swings at despotic dictatorships and (dis)organised religion which I’m all for, despite no lines really catching my fancy (PD’s “the chameleon is my favourite animal” is one to remember).\n\nGrindcore is a genre not too well known for being overtly original, this applies to Needful Things who are very much in the same vein of their influences, as both debut “Dead Point” and the more recent “Deception” are in a similar key, however I will say “Tentacles of Influence” takes this sound and perfects it, with genuine song-writing and top-notch production to boot. I don’t consider this to be a landmark album but it is a personal favourite for what the genre can offer.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NpZpehCekHk?si=XoCsk5GNM8aHRKuM\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.Intro – Tentacles of Influence\n\n2.Constricted\n\n3.Fallen In Darkness\n\n4.Deprogrammed\n\n5.Predator\n\n6.Worshipper Of God\n\n7.Money In God´s Hands\n\n8.Collateral Existence\n\n9.Narrator\n\n10.Corrupted\n\n11.Decision Points\n\n12.Party For Killers / Massive Killing\n\n13.End Of Your Life\n\n14.Remains Of Life\n\n15.DNA Freak Number\n\n16.One Day Hero\n\n17.Mask Of Arrogance\n\n18.Firewall\n\n19.The Mass\n\nBest tracks:\n\nFirst 3 opening tracks, “Worshipper of God”, “Party of Killers…” & “One Day Hero”.\n\nNeedful Things Online\n\nFACEBOOK INSTAGRAM BANDCAMP SPOTIFY YOUTUBE WEBSITE\n\nWritten By Sebastian Melmoth\n\nIn the vast landscape of heavy metal, there have been bands that have left an indelible mark such as as Iron Maiden. Emerging in the late 1970s, Iron Maiden quickly rose to prominence with their electrifying blend of galloping riffs, operatic vocals, and intricate storytelling. Led by the iconic Bruce Dickinson, the band became synonymous with the New Wave of the British Heavy Metal movement, captivating audiences around the world with their unparalleled energy and stage presence.\n\nAs Iron Maiden conquered arenas and cemented their status as metal legends, Bruce Dickinson’s soaring vocals and charismatic persona became the heart and soul of the band. Yet, amidst the thunderous applause and adoration of millions, Bruce embarked on a personal journey—one that would ultimately lead him to explore new musical horizons beyond the confines of Iron Maiden.\n\nDriven by an insatiable hunger for creative expression, Bruce ventured into the realm of solo projects, each a testament to his boundless talent and artistic vision. And thus, the Mandrake Project was born—a bold exploration of sound and storytelling that pushes the boundaries of what metal can be.\n\nRooted in the legacy of Iron Maiden yet unafraid to chart its own course, the Mandrake Project represents the culmination of Bruce Dickinson’s musical evolution—a testament to his unwavering dedication to the craft and his relentless pursuit of musical innovation. So join us as we embark on this epic journey, where the spirit of Iron Maiden lives on, and Bruce Dickinson continues to push the boundaries of metal and beyond.\n\nStep into the electrifying world of Bruce’s latest musical expedition, “The Mandrake Project,” where each track is a journey through the depths of metal mastery and experimentation.\n\nDive headfirst into the abyss with the haunting opener, “Afterglow of Ragnarok,” a metal symphony that will send shivers down your spine. From there, buckle up for the wild ride through “Many Doors to Hell,” a hard-rock anthem that channels the spirit of legends like Deep Purple and Iron Maiden.\n\nBut hold on tight as the tempo shifts with “Rain on the Graves,” a theatrical masterpiece inspired by the immortal words of William Blake. Witness Bruce’s vocal acrobatics as he effortlessly transitions from rap to operatic delivery, leaving you spellbound.\n\nAs the album unfolds, each track unveils a new layer of Bruce’s musical evolution. From the haunting melodies of “Resurrection Men” to the Middle Eastern-infused “Fingers in the Wounds,” prepare to be captivated at every turn.\n\nAnd just when you think you’ve seen it all, Bruce delivers the gut-wrenching “Eternity HAS Failed,” a poignant reminder of his indomitable spirit in the face of adversity.\n\nBut it’s not all darkness and despair. Get ready to headbang with “Mistress of Mercy,” a high-octane anthem that will leave you craving more. And as the final notes of “Sonata (Immortal Beloved)” fade into the night, you’ll be left breathless, yearning for just one more ride on this aural rollercoaster.\n\nThe beauty of Bruce’s bold experimentation in a world saturated with imitation, “The Mandrake Project” stands as a beacon of creativity and innovation.\n\nStrap on your protective head gear because Bruce isn’t just here to show us how it’s done—he’s here to redefine the very essence of metal itself. And at 65 years young, there’s no stopping him now.\n\nDickinson offered: “So, everybody, everybody on the planet who’s been going, ‘Oh my god. What’s this solo thing gonna be all about when it finally happens?’ Well, it’s finally happening. It’s called The Mandrake Project, and’ of course, it’s music. But, it’s also much, much, more. More than that, I’m not gonna reveal for now, ’cause it will become self-explanatory and self-evident as we go through and reveal more layers of the onion for you all.”\n\nHe continued: “We’ve been working on this since 2014, when it wasn’t called The Mandrake Project. And it’s had time to grow and mature. And, oh my God, has it ever. I think you will be really, really excited. And, I hope you love everything that we’ve created for you.”\n\n“The Mandrake Project” track listing:\n\n01. Afterglow Of Ragnarok (05:45)\n\n02. Many Doors To Hell (04:48)\n\n03.

Undoubtedly the heaviest track on the album, it showcases a remarkable evolution in Final Coil’s sonic palette. Drawing parallels to Killing Joke, Philip Stiles astutely captures the nuanced influences that shape this powerful piece.\n\nFrom their earliest roots, Final Coil has been a purveyor of music with substance, seamlessly blending inspired musical imagination with profound lyrical depth. “Chemtrails” exemplifies the band’s ability to craft compositions that resonate with deep wells of thought and emotion. As a sonic edifice, each release from Final Coil serves as a testament to their unwavering commitment to musical artistry.\n\nHailing from Leicester, United Kingdom, Final Coil positions themselves as an alternative, hard rock force. Their new album, “The World We Inherited,” not only delivers the heaviest track in “Chemtrails” but also showcases the band’s versatility and variety. Ideal for both new listeners and longtime fans, the album unveils a rich tapestry of sounds, firmly establishing Final Coil as a band capable of navigating diverse musical landscapes with finesse.\n\nAt long last, the concluding, climactic chapter of Final Coil’s magnificent Persistence Trilogy is here. Six years after the story began with debut album Persistence Of Memory, four years since the groundbreaking The World We Left Behind For Others challenged our preconceptions of genre and form, Final Coil have once more reached new heights with every aspect of their uniquely brilliant music. The World We Inherited is a breathtaking affirmation of everything Final Coil have ever stood for – musically, creatively, intellectually – a remarkable conclusion to an exceptional beginning and an enticing gateway to an exciting and unpredictable future.\n\nAs it heralds the future for Final Coil, The World We Inherited also gazes into the future of human society, drawing listeners into a dark and frightening world of conspiracy theories, vicious authoritarianism and isolation. Inspired in part by a long, night-time conversation between song writer and lyricist Phil Stiles and Killing Joke’s Jaz Coleman, in part by the dystopian fiction of George Orwell and in part by simple observation of our relentless tumble into collective madness, The World We Inherited is an all-encompassing listening experience.\n\nSpeaking about the bleak reflections that run through the new album Phil Stiles said:“We live in an era of unprecedented threat. Flashing headlines, endless conflicts both inter and intra-civilisational in nature, and the swirling voices of social media have coalesced to create a cold and unforgiving world. We heard freedom’s call, but we failed to keep it within our grasp.”\n\nMusically, The World We Inherited is every bit as profound, enthralling and affecting as it is lyrically. The unmistakeable blend of grunge, prog rock and post metal that characterises the Final Coil sound has been sculpted and caressed into even more bewitching and surprising forms. Each song is a beautifully textured, multifaceted gem – exquisitely crafted and emotionally charged. From the grinding power of ‘Chemtrails’, via the aching fragility of ‘By Starlight’, to the sonic splendour of ‘End Of History’, these songs, without exception, represent new peaks in the Final Coil canon and will stay with you for years to come.\n\nRecorded at Parlour Studios with the globally renowned producer Russ Russell (Amorphis, The Wildhearts, Napalm Death etc.), who also mixed and mastered the album, The World We Inherited sounds spectacular. And in keeping with the preceding chapters of the trilogy it comes adorned in the artwork of Andy Pilkington of Very Metal Art (Flotsam And Jetsam, Rock Goddess, Mordred, etc). Everything is in place, including a new deal with international label SlipTrick Records, who will release The World We Inherited on January 16th.Be ready for the return of Final Coil!\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1.The World We Inherited\n\n2.Wires 04:26\n\n3.Chemtrails\n\n4.By Starlight\n\n5.The Growing Shadows\n\n6.Stay With Me\n\n7.Purify\n\n8.Out Of Sorts\n\n9.Humanity\n\n10.End Of History\n\nPREORDER THE WORLD WE INHERITED HERE\n\nVisit the Final Coil website here\n\nFind out more about Final Coil and The World We Inherited here\n\nDigital pre-orders for The World We Inherited are open here\n\nVisit Final Coil on Facebook\n\nVisit Final Coil on Instagram\n\nVisit the on-line home of SlipTrick Records here\n\nFINAL COIL ONLINE:\n\nFACEBOOK X INSTAGRAM YOUTUBE WEBSITE BANDCAMP SPOTIFY SOUNDCLOUD DISCOGS SLIPTRICK RECORDS\n\nColourMind Are:\n\nJimmy Watson – Vocals/Guitar Jonny Essiech – Backing Vocals/Guitar\n\nTristan Chopping -Backing Vocals/Bass\n\nMatt Wenke – Drums\n\nPerth’s ColourMind is set to drop their highly anticipated album, “Perfecting Failure,” in October 2023, and they’ve unveiled their latest track, “Endless.” The band’s music is an explosion of melodious intensity, igniting with colossal riffs and thunderous percussion. The vocals emanate a sound that’s truly captivating. ColourMind’s music is a visceral manifestation of unadulterated authenticity, delving deep into the realm of relentless metal fervency.\n\nMuch like the anthems “Trust” and “Fight For My Life,” their latest single, “Endless,” keeps the fires of rock and pop-punk burning brightly within the band’s repertoire.\n\n“Endless” showcases the quartet’s ability to craft yet another irresistibly contagious musical gem. The track boasts the quintessential components of rock, featuring vigorous drumming that resonates with every heartbeat.\n\nThis song also carries the unmistakable essence of pop-punk, with lyrics that are both catchy and anthemic, practically begging to be sung and shouted at the top of one’s lungs.\n\nThe accompanying video for “Endless” is a whimsical and captivating experience, weaving elements of magic and mystical rituals, ultimately culminating in a riveting live performance by the band. Its sure to entertain!\n\nWith each listen, ColourMind’s allure deepens, leaving an indelible mark on the listener’s musical consciousness.\n\nDespite the weighty themes explored throughout the album, ColourMind’s music remains infused with an unwavering sense of hope and positivity. The band’s unwavering commitment lies in sharing their profound message and music with the widest possible audience.\n\nPerfecting Failure, the debut album from alternative Aussies ColourMind, has been a long time in the making. Jonny first started writing and composing the songs on the album when he was just a young teenager and the band has been working tirelessly to bring these songs to life in the studio. The album was recorded by Jay Huxtable at Oracle Sound in Perth and is set to be released in October 2023.\n\nThe album tackles a range of important themes, including social and political issues that are close to the hearts of the band members. The album’s title, Perfecting Failure, refers to the human race’s tendency to make mistakes and cause destruction, particularly through the actions of corrupt politicians and greedy bankers who prioritize their own interests over the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.\n\nDespite the heavy themes addressed on the album, ColourMind’s music is infused with hope and positivity. The band’s focus is on sharing their message and music with as many people as possible, and they are excited to get their music heard as well as played on radio stations, reaching a wider audience. With their catchy melodies, powerful lyrics, and energetic performance, ColourMind is sure to make a lasting impact on the pop punk and metal music scenes.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Ouroboros\n\n02.
