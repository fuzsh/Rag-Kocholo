        "text": "Below is a quick tour of a collection I bought from a guy in the UK. I included a list of everything contained at the end of this post.\n\nA collector contacted me a few months ago and sent me a list of everything they had for sale. To determine the price, they sent me a list of the titles and a few example photos that were somewhat deceptive to represent the grading of the CDs. I’m sharing more on this below.\n\nPricing / Shipping Method\n\nWe agreed on a price ($3200 + shipping costs) and had to figure out a shipping method from the UK. Typically, shipping from Europe via FedEx or UPS is the least expensive. DHL is the best choice for shipping from England, though prices have risen quite a bit for their already costly service. The value of the Euro to the dollar is less lopsided than it used to be, with the exchange rate hovering near 1 for 1 now, making it a buyer’s market if you are in the US.\n\nI sent the money via PayPal, and the seller shipped the collection out the next day.\n\nIssues\n\nSadly, when the collection arrived, it became clear that the example photos of the CDs did not represent the vast majority of the collection. 70% came covered in mold and quite scratched. I contacted the seller, but they seemed uninterested in fixing the problem. I considered disputing through PayPal because this sale is covered by buyer protection. Ultimately, I did not dispute it once it was put for sale because I saw I could make a decent return. Luckily, the record grading was better than described.\n\nHighlights From This Collection\n\nListed below are some of the highlights from this collection.\n\nMonstrosity – In Dark Purity LP\n\nMonstrosity – In Dark Purity LP 1999 The Plague – plague011 – The most expensive piece in this collection comes from Monstrosity and arrived in excellent condition. This album features Jason Avery on vocals, not Corpsegrider on vocals, but it is still very rare and sought after.\n\nValue $400\n\nMonstrosity – Imperial Doom LP\n\nMonstrosity – Imperial Doom LP 1992 Nuclear Blast ‎– NB 055 VG+/VG+ [1ST PRESS] – This is the first album from Monstrosity, featuring Corpsegrinder (Cannibal Corpse) on vocals. The CD of this release goes for over $100.\n\nValue $250\n\nDying Fetus – Grotesque Impalement LP\n\nDying Fetus – Grotesque Impalement LP 2000 Revenge Productions RVP 6 VG+/EX *DE – Very rare numbered first pressing strictly limited to 1003 copies.\n\nValue $230\n\nEntombed – Clandestine LP\n\nEntombed – Clandestine LP 1992 Earache – MOSH 37 [1st PRESS EMBOSSED] VG+/VG+ UK – Limited embossed first pressing on Earache records, limited to 1000 copies and very rare.\n\nValue $160\n\nDying Fetus – Destroy The Opposition LP\n\nDying Fetus – Destroy The Opposition LP 2000 Good Life – GL 075 [Blue] EX/EX *BE – This is a limited first pressing of Good Life Records, that later got pick up by Relapse Records.\n\nValue $160\n\nMotörhead ‎– No Remorse LP\n\nMotörhead ‎– No Remorse LP 1984 Bronze ‎– 90236-1L [Leather Jacket] VG+/VG+ UK – Limited pressing of this classic Motorhead 2 LP compilation comes in excellent high-quality biker leather!\n\nValue $150\n\nTerrorizer – World Downfall LP\n\nTerrorizer – World Downfall LP 1989 Earache – MOSH 16 VG+/VG+ UK – This proto-grindcore / death metal LP features half of the members of Morbid Angel and holds up to this day musically.\n\nValue $150\n\nSintury – Disgorging The Dead CD\n\nSintury – Disgorging The Dead CD 1998 Corpse Gristle Records – CGR-001 [Rare] – Very rare death metal on the now-defunct Corpse Gristle records.\n\nValue $150\n\nDevourment ‎– Molesting The Decapitated CD\n\nDevourment ‎– Molesting The Decapitated CD 1999 United Guttural – UGR 005 – Limited to 1000 copies, first pressings of this CD is very sought after. I don’t think anything is unique about the music; most people probably want it for the cover.\n\nValue $100\n\nHave A Collection Like This To Sell?\n\nI am always buying.

It was released on the one-off “Loud N Local Music Group.” Gutted was a legendary band that released sadly too few recordings.\n\nPrice $139.95\n\n3) Enslaved – Vikingligr Veldi CD\n\nEnslaved – Vikingligr Veldi CD 1994 Deathlike Silence – Anti Mosh 008 [EARLY] – The first press from this Norwegian death metal band has no white space on the back cover, which is about the same size as a bar code. The subsequent repress has this. Regardless of which version you have, they are both worth a ton. Enslaved is still active, tours, and is releasing new material.\n\nPrice $149.95\n\n2) Dawn – Nær Solen Gar Niþer For Evogher CD\n\nDawn – Nær Solen Gar Niþer For Evogher CD 1994 Necropolis – NR 006 ORIGINAL – All of the 90s albums, Sweedish melodic-death metal band Dawn, are extremely expensive. Even the reissues cost quite a bit and sell out immediately. If you have never listened to Dawn, I highly recommend you do.\n\nPrice $159.95\n\n1) Weakling – Dead As Dreams CD\n\nWeakling – Dead As Dreams CD 2000 tUMULt – tm 17 – American Black Metallers Weakling released only one studio album besides a rehearsal recording. Weakling became quite popular posthumously due to their early 2000s breakup. This CD is a cult classic and is damn near impossible to find.\n\nPrice $169.95\n\nDo You Have Rare Metal CDs Like This You Would Like To Sell?\n\nI am always looking for heavy metal CDs and record collections to buy. Hit me up if you want to get top dollar for them.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis article is a continuation of my 2020 blog post detailing the most expensive metal CDs we have first-hand experience with from buying many heavy metal CDs. For the 2021 update, I have expanded the list to 25 because we’ve grown considerably as a business. The values assigned to each are based on amounts we have sold them for and are not an aggregate. All CDS from the 2020 blog post have also been excluded from this list, but you can view the archive here.\n\nNew update – see the 2023 list of most expensive CDs here.\n\n1. Krabathor – Cool Mortification CD 1993 Monitor – 010174-2331 Czech Republic\n\nKrabathor – Cool Mortification CD 1993 Monitor – 010174-2331 (Czech Republic) – This CD is rare and HEAVILY counterfeited — there are very few real ones floating around.

Morpheus Descends – Ritual Of Infinity CD 1992 JL America – 3815-41012-2\n\nMorpheus Descends – Ritual Of Infinity CD 1992 JL America – 3815-41012-2 – This is another heavily bootlegged CD, but the 1992 first press with this runout Matrix / Runout (Variant 1): W.O.# E35739-1 *MANUFACTURED BY AMERICAN HELIX* CD 0400313815-41012-2 is worth a mint.\n\nSOLD 8/1/2021 – $149.95\n\n3.

Iron Maiden – Tailgunner CD Single 1990 Epic – ESK 2233 PROMO\n\nIron Maiden – Tailgunner CD Single 1990 Epic – ESK 2233 PROMO – With no cover art (comes as disc only), the mega-rare Iron Maiden radio promo is worth a pretty penny.\n\nSold 8/8/2021 – $99.95\n\n5.

Nasty Habit – Rock Hard CD 1991 American Records – 1439-2\n\nNasty Habit – Rock Hard CD 1991 American Records – 1439-2 – I have no idea why this CD is so expensive, but it didn’t sit on the shelf long.\n\nSOLD 8/8/2021 – $99.95\n\n7. Accidental Suicide – Deceased CD 1992 Grind Core – 89811-2\n\nAccidental Suicide – Deceased CD 1992 Grind Core – 89811-2 – Very rare self-release grindcore.

Death – Scream Bloody Gore CD 1987 Combat – 88561-8146-2 (FIRST PRESS)\n\nDeath – Scream Bloody Gore CD 1987 Combat – 88561-8146-2 – The first press and the repress if this album has the same catalog number. The first pressing lists all of the song titles straight in a row. The repress says “Side A / Side B” on the rear card.\n\nSOLD 4/4.2021 – $98.69\n\n9. Gutted – Gutted CD 1997 Loud N Local Music Group – LNLMG9701-2\n\nGutted – Gutted CD 1997 Loud N Local Music Group – LNLMG9701-2 – The original indie release is the one that’s worth big money.

Hit me up if you have one to sell — I pay top dollar!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis list is compiled from CDs acquired while buying metal CD collections in the year 2020. It is by no means a comprehensive list of every metal CD out there; these are just ones we have first-hand experience with. The values we had assigned are based on what we have sold them for and are not an aggregate.\n\n1. Urn ‎– 666 Megatons CD 2006 No Sign Of Life ‎– NSOL001\n\nUrn ‎– 666 Megatons CD 2006 No Sign Of Life ‎– NSOL00 – the special edition from this Finish thrash/black metal band that includes the DVD is RARE. Urn was a cool proto-Black Metal sound similar to “Show NoMercy” era Slayer – the full edition, which includes a live DVD, is almost impossible to find and goes for north of 100 bucks on a regular basis.\n\nSold 10/1 $159.00\n\n2. The Black ‎– The Priest Of Satan CD 1994 Necropolis Records ‎NR 003\n\nThe Black ‎– The Priest Of Satan CD 1994 Necropolis Records ‎NR 003 – This CD has been re-issued several times, including more recently on Osmose Productions – if you can find the original on Necropolis Records, it can be worth a pretty penny.\n\nSold 9/11 $99.95\n\n3. Swans ‎– Swans Are Dead CD 1998 Young God Records ‎– YG03\n\nSwans ‎– Swans Are Dead CD 1998 Young God Records ‎– YG03 – Although The Swans are not technically a metal band, it is quite common to see their brand of gothic rock turning up in the collections we buy. The original pressing of their CDs is very hard to come by, and reissues aren’t that common either, making almost every CD in their catalog quite valuable.\n\nSold 8/8 – $79.95\n\n4. Ingested – The Surreption CD 2012 Siege of Amida Records\n\nIngested – The Surreption CD 2012 Siege of Amida Records – I will be honest: when I first saw this one, I thought it might be a fluke, but upon some investigation, copies of those are really scarce and sell for north of $100 on Discogs on a monthly basis. It is also worth noting that Ingested sounds like a $99 per CD band; they play some ridiculously tight technical death metal and are one of my new favorites.\n\nSold 12/29 – $99.95\n\n5. Xibalba – Ah Dzam Poop Ek CD 2005 Guttural Records ‎– CDGR002\n\nXibalba – Ah Dzam Poop Ek CD 2005 Guttural Records ‎– CDGR002 Mexico – the original pricing from Mexico only lists eight tracks; there are later reissues, but if you can find the first one, it is quite valuable.\n\nSold 7/11 – $74.99\n\n6.

Devourment ‎– Molesting The Decapitated CD 1999 United Guttural UGR 005\n\nDevourment ‎– Molesting The Decapitated CD 1999 United Guttural UGR 005 – I was actually surprised that this one didn’t sell for more; this is the original version of this death metal classic from this brutal Texas-based outfit.

Suffocation – Effigy of the Forgotten/Pierced from Within CD 2003 Roadrunner\n\nSuffocation – Effigy of the Forgotten/Pierced from Within 2x CD 2003 Roadrunner (2 From The Vault Series) – almost all of the CDs from Roadrunner’s discontinued “2 From The Vault” series fetch a pretty penny.

Ancient Wisdom – For Snow Covered The Northland CD 1996 Avantgarde Music\n\nAncient Wisdom – For Snow Covered The Northland CD 1996 Avantgarde Music – This CD from an obscure but extremely talented Italian progressive black metal band is extremely hard to find, not to mention the music is amazing.

Amebix – No Sanctuary: The Spiderleg Recordings CD 2008 Revolver USA\n\nAmebix – No Sanctuary: The Spiderleg Recordings CD [Digipak] 2008 Revolver USA – Although this one might fall more into the crust punk genre, Ambix is still quite popular among the metal crown.
