        "text": "Record Store Day\n\nListen to Sunny Day Real Estate’s “Lipton Witch”\n\nSunny Day Real Estate haven’t released any new music in 14 years, but that changed this past Saturday with the release of their split EP with Circa Survive.\n\nThe split featured Sunny Day’s new track, “Lipton Witch” the first new song since 2000’s The Rising Tide. Though they had announced plans to release new material in 2011 with the band’s original line-up, the first time since 1995’s LP2 recording, it ended up getting shelved.\n\nAt the beginning of March, both Circa Survive and Sunny Day had announced their plan for the Record Store Day release as well as the track list and the album art which can be seen as the background in the video below.\n\nMaybe the fact that the Record Store Day EP will help Sunny Day finally release that shelved album; it’s never too late for them to come back.\n\nStream fun.’s Record Store Day Contribution\n\nWith less than 24 hours before Record Store Day is slated to begin, one of the special records is currently streaming. Fun. had revealed that their contribution for the yearly event would be Point and Light which went on to become 2009’s Aim and Ignite.\n\nThe songs on the Record Store Day EP are the demo versions of the tracks that would go on to become their debut album. Currently, the full EP is being streamed and can be heard below, but for those looking for a physical copy of the five song record, all you need to do is head on over to your local independent record store tomorrow and see if the album is being sold.\n\nGive it a listen.\n\nWhile the Record Store Day EP is a nice gift, don’t count on fun. hitting the touring circuit anytime soon. The band have been busy taking a break from their three-year tour in support of their break out album, Some Nights. According to a recent interview with Rolling Stones after performing at the NCAA March Madness Festival, frontman Nate Ruess revealed that he is currently writing for what might become their next album and even admitted that when the band got back together for the NCAA show, it made him happy.\n\nAs for the other members of fun., it was recently revealed that Jack Antonoff has formed another musical group named Bleachers after he tried to keep it a secret. Bleachers would be his second “side project” band, his first being Steel Train.\n\nJack White to Head Out on “Lazaretto” Tour\n\nJust a week after announcing that he will be releasing a new album, Jack White has now announced that he will be hitting the road to tour in support of it.\n\nThe Lazaretto tour is slated to begin on April 19th, Record Store Day for those not familiar, at White’s Third Man Records in Nashville. After that, the tour will pick up on May 29 in Tulsa, OK at Cain’s Ballroom and continue throughout the United States for some solo and festival stops as well as a few key days in Europe. The tour will wrap up on August 3 after a three-day stop in Montreal for the Osheaga Music & Arts Festival.\n\nJoining him for the Summer tour as openers will include fellow Third Man Record artist, Kelley Stoltz and singer-songwriter Benjamin Booker.\n\nFull tour dates for the Lazaretto Tour can be seen here.\n\nJACK WHITE’S SUMMER LAZARETTO TOUR:\n\nApril 19: Nashville – Third Man Records\n\nMay 29: Tulsa, Okla. – Cain’s Ballroom\n\nMay 30: Lubbock, Texas – Wild West\n\nMay 31/June 1: Houston – Free Press Summer Festival\n\nJune 2: Shreveport, La. – Municipal Auditorium\n\nJune 3: New Orleans – Saenger Theatre\n\nJune 5: Charlotte, N.C. – The Fillmore Charlotte\n\nJune 7: New York City – Governors Ball\n\nJune 12/13/14/15: Manchester, Tenn. – Bonnaroo\n\nJune 25/26/27/28/29: Somerset, England – Glastonbury\n\nJune 26: Dublin, Ireland – Royal Hospital Kilmainham\n\nJune 29/30: Paris -L’Olympia\n\nJuly 3: Amsterdam – Heineken Music Hall\n\nJuly 4: Gdynia, Poland – Open’er Festival\n\nJuly 5: London – Eventim Apollo\n\nJuly 19: Louisville, Ky. – Forecastle Festival\n\nJuly 20: St. Louis, Mo. – Fox Theatre\n\nJuly 21: Milwaukee, Wis. – Eagles Ballroom\n\nJuly 23: Chicago – Chicago Theatre\n\nJuly 24: Chicago – Auditorium Theatre\n\nJuly 27: Pittsburgh, Pa. – Stage AE Outdoors\n\nJuly 28: Detroit – Fox Theatre\n\nJuly 30: Detroit – Masonic Temple Theatre\n\nJuly 31: Toronto – Air Canada Centre\n\nAug. 1/2/3: Montreal – Osheaga Music & Arts Festival\n\nLazaretto is due out on June 10 and is currently available for digital pre-order worldwide on iTunes.

The White Stripes frontman released a cover of Loretta Lynn’s 1970 country hit song, “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” It might not be that much of a stretch that White chose to cover Lynn since he talks about how much he admires her and even helped produce her 2004 album, Van Lear Rose.\n\nOn his Third Man blog, the frontman notes that he covered the song “so you can hear the warm analog fidelity that radiates out of this booth,” which will “soon be a permanent fixture in [Third Man’s] Novelties Lounge.”\n\nWho’s ready to go visit Third Man Records in Nashville? I’m down.\n\nCheck out White’s cover below.\n\nJimmy Eat World Perform In-Store for Record Store Day\n\nRecord Store Day is one of the biggest days for music lover having artists contribute one of a kind songs and rare tracks that will never be found elsewhere.\n\nAs part of yesterday’s festivities, Jimmy Eat World performed at Fingerprints in Long Beach. The band had released a Record Store Day 7-inch which included a brand new song as well as a Radiohead cover.\n\nThanks to a fans and their love of technology, there is video of the band performing their recently released single, “I Will Steal You Back” as well as the song that launched them to Top 100 fame, “The Middle.”\n\nThe first video is of high quality but only features the band performing “I Will Steal You Back” while the second is of low quality, but is the full set.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n(High Quality)\n\n(Low Quality)\n\nRecord Store Day Releases\n\nRecord Store Day isn’t until April 20, but here’s a full guide of some of the music that can be found at those special record stores participating during this event. Believe me, it’s a long list, but well worth it if you are looking for something specifically.\n\nCASSETTE RELEASES (COPIED FROM http://new-vinyl.blogspot.com):\n\n§ Kill Rock Stars The Compilations(limited 3 cassette box set) (400 copies)\n\nTRACKLISTING\n\nTape 1, Side a:\n\nGirl Germs 1:45 Bratmobile\n\nLoch Ness 2:17 Some Velvet Sidewalk\n\nDon’t Mix The Colors 1:48 Courtney Love\n\nN.O.U.
