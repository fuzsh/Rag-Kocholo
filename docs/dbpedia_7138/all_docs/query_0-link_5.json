        "text": "Hi everyone! I am very excited and happy to inform you about my first solo album. Last summer I entered Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg to record something that would eventually turn out as an album. Together with Henrik Wind (the Peepshows), Thomas Falk (Bombshell Rocks), Mieszko Talarczyk (Nasum) and some other friends and musicians, I recorded 13 songs, of which 11 will be on the album. Soundwise, the material ranges from Boogie-Woogie to Country and Folkrock. I think the word love is mentioned in each and every song, so If there is a \"Theme of the album\", itÂ´s definitely LOVE. Otherwise I would say that the songs are quite different to each other and a lot different to what IÂ´ve done with Millencolin. I hope you will check it out!"
