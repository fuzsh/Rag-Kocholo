I immediately thought of NAUSEA, NUCLEAR DEATH TERROR and FLEAS AND LICE. All the lyrics are fiercely political and aren’t just rehashed war formula staples. They tackle the integrity of the crust scene and comment on the recent global upheavals and question work life that starts every unsatisfying day with the blip of an alarm clock. The mix and recording are perfect. I love when well written songs are preserved properly. Ever buy something from a good band that you just can’t listen to? Not this one! Top notch from start to finish! Another staller release from Maloka. (Jake) (PE)\n\nMaloka\n\n10\n\nA.D.T.\n\nAttack Disarm Takeover\n\nWith members of Attitude Adjustement, Deathtoll, Strychnine!

The song structure is similar to that of say \"DESTROY!\" with distorted, growled vocals. Full-on, raging political crust with enough variety and anger to really make it interesting. The band's self-proclaimed influences are DISCHARGE, DOOM, and EXTREME NOISE TERROR. Throw in some NAPALM DEATH and ACCION MUTANTE is what you get. The regular LP version include also a poster.\n\nPower It Up\n\n11\n\nACCUSED\n\nThe Archives Tapes\n\n2xlp! A musical time machine documenting their rise to ambiguity, providing insight on their influence and underground status as forefathers of early 80's 'crossover'. The ACCUSED's 34 Song Archives 2xLP reveals early teen-punk roots, including early demo tracks of vintage 'Splatter Rock' and the creeping metal-influence! Humbling outtakes! Candid rehearsal sessions! Live 'bootlegs' and extensive liner notes. Comes in a nice gatefold cover. Splatterheads beware!!!\n\nUnrest\n\n16\n\nACCUSED\n\nBaked Tapes\n\nHere is a 16 track LP including rare outtakes of 'Blood-Soaked Splatter Rock' from 1986-'91!

For the entire length of the CD's 14 classic Splatter-Drenched songs, The ACCUSED prove the crown still fits. Founding member and guitarist, Tommy Niemeyer says, \"Oh, Martha! is easily one of the top 2 albums we've done. It was intentionally written with the knowledge that we raised the bar for ourselves over 10 years earlier. If we were gonna do a 'comeback', the last thing we wanted to hear was 'now, go back away!' cuz our album sucked, ya know? So I said, let's f@*king kick this album's ass!..and we did. Now it can put a boot in yours.\"\n\nUnrest\n\n11\n\nACCUSED\n\nNasty Cuts - Best Of The Nasty Mix Years 1990-1993\n\nFourteen blood-soaked songs selectively chosen from the \"Grinning Like An Undertaker\" LP, the \"Straight Razor\" 12\" EP, and the \"Splatter Rock\" LP sessions. Exhumed from the graves of 1990-1993, this compilation of nail-pounding, metal-edged splatterrock will serve as a collection of works from the Nasty Mix era!! Artwork was kill-ustrated by the King of Splatter himself, Tommy Niemeyer...in murderous head-splitting fashion!! Limited colour wax available for Unrest mail order only!!\n\nUnrest\n\n11\n\nACEPHALIX\n\nInterminable Night\n\nNamedropping is not necessary because this release ROARS!! Acephalix from San Francisco are the prototype of the hard working band, started in 2008 they have evolved their sound from it’s crust roots after a demo and a 7” and an Lp on Prank Records. Then a couple of self-released tapes sealed the evolution: pure brutality! What you’ll hear is a devastating death metal outburst raised on their crust past, early 90’s US death metal is what comes first to mind but indulging more on power rather than speed. Those two demos finally see the light again on vinyl. \"Interminable night\" has been originally released august 2010 and \"Flesh torn in twilight\" in January 2011. Devastation is drawing nearer! 1000 copies press, limited edition comes in 150 copies with colored vinyl and limited poster. Cd version on Southern Lord. Euro tour in September.\n\nAgipunk\n\n10\n\nACID SPEECH / PESTICIDE\n\nSplit\n\nPESTICIDE is new raw Brazilian Thrash (bordering on Death/Thrash) horde featuring Pedro of VIOLATOR etc. Great stuff that should appeal to fans MUTILATOR, SLAUGHTER LORD or very old SACRIFICE(CAN). ACID SPEECH is more in the vein of the new true 80s Thrash-wave; VIOLATOR, GUILLOTINE, BYWAR – and they do it with style! Anyone into South America Thrash should own this split\n\nFloga\n\n10\n\nACROSS TUNDRAS\n\nWestern Sky Ride\n\nAcross Tundras both crush and soothe with expertly conjured sonic doses of ambient doom, vintage psychedelic rock and haunted folk. For fans of Black Sabbath, My Bloody Valentine, Hawkwind, Earth, Neil Young, Neurosis, and Pink Floyd.\n\nReleased on CD by Saw Her Ghost Records in 2008, this master piece is finally available on vinyl, a gatefold 2xLP for a 500 copies press\n\nMusicfearsatan\n\n15\n\nACTIVE MINDS\n\nFree To Be Chained\n\nTheir second lp, this is classic anarcho-punk with always interesting lyrics, not to be missed\n\nLoony Tunes\n\n10\n\nACTIVE MINDS\n\nIt's Perfectly Obvious That This System Doesn't Work\n\nTheir third and most recent output, they are still active and still interesting, recomended!!!\n\nLoony Tunes\n\n10\n\nADACTA / JONESTOWN\n\nSplit\n\nPrague crust core horde sounds like old good Dread 101 vs. Slovakian bestial hardcore / crust like old Wolfpack / Wolfbrigade.\n\nPhobia\n\n11\n\nADELITAS\n\nLlama Viva De La Rabia\n\nEnergetic, melodic, and rage-filled anarchopunk from Portland with dual male/female vocals sung in Spanish influenced by Latin American revolutionary music. The name Adelitas comes from a popular Mexican folk song and refers to the women who organized and took up arms during the Mexican Revolution. In this spirit the lyrics have focused on struggles around the border, immigration, and popular social movements that threaten the status quo. Que viva el punk revolucionario! Recorded 2012 at Buzz or Howl Studios by Stan Wright and mastered at Audiosiege by Brad Boatright in Portland, OR.\n\nAborted Society\n\n11\n\nAESAHAETTR\n\nS/T\n\nWe’re glad to introduce this unholy project coming from the frostbitten lands of Canada. Formed in 2008 by sole member Mike Kirkenbrannsar, Æsahættr’s only recording effort to date was accomplished over two consecutive Winters, using the isolation and beauty of the harsh Canadian season to influence and shape the ultimate realization of the Æsahættr sound. Lyrically, this effort is largely based around the trilogy of novels His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman, touching on the themes of Gnosticism, Atheism, and blacksmithing polar bears prevalent throughout the books. Cold, dark, epic black metal combining the rawness of Ulver’s Nattens Madrigal with some crusty changes of rhythm and atmospheric moments too. Æsahættr’s music will sweep your dark thoughts away & hide them in a cave to chew on your bones. The vocals are living demons, swirling around in a black hole spitting out pure bloodlust. These shrill screams of beautiful agony will have you under their spell. Musically, Æsahættr constructs songs that take the form of endless sonic diseases that someday will infect the whole world so that humanity as we know it will exist no more. While chaos & mayhem can be found in the songs that this band manifests, it’s the rivers of slow-moving sorrow that wash over you before allowing you to fly away and greet emotions that you did not know existed in your noir heart. I’m so into the way the Æsahættr builds on layers of tension to actually create serenity… I have seen the majesty of the nordic wilderness & thought to myself, what battles happened on this hallowed ground? While listening to Æsahættr, I can visualize those exact thoughts again... In order to perform live Æsahættr will be collaborating with the members of Thantifaxath, mysterious cowled wizards of black metal blasphemy hailing from the nearby forest of Toronto.\n\nIconoclast\n\n10\n\nAFGANISTAN YEYE'S\n\nNo Es Que La Fama...\n\nFast Hardcore Punk from Spain featuring ex-members of Budellam, Anti/Dogmatikss and Scavenge\n\nCarnus\n\n4\n\nAFGRUND\n\nVid Helvetets Grindar\n\n15 attacks of pure swedish bonecrushing grindcore without any compromisses between Necrony and Nasum\n\nlimited to 500 copies only (200 red/300 black). This comes in red vinyl\n\nFDA\n\n8\n\nAFTER THE LAST SKY\n\nAnd This Is Progress?\n\nAfter The Last Sky are the UK's blackcore pioneers on this epic five track LP. Totally black metal inspired grind with epic doom and sludge parts! Genuinely raging music.\n\nCrucificados\n\n5\n\nAFTERMATH\n\nWhen Will You Die? Demos '86/87\n\nAmerican Thrash-core demos of the '80s for the first time on vinyl, remastered from the best quality sources existing for a never heard before audio quality. If you're looking for mind blowing FAST Thrash a la Wehrmacht/Soothsayer with a touch of Hardcore reminescent of Attitude Adjustment and Accüsed, this is absolutely a top notch pick. This record includes the \"Sentenced to death\" demo 1986, \"Killing the future\" demo 1987 and songs from their first show even recorded in 1986, 14 songs in total leaving you completely breathless. Tracks like \"War For Freedom\" & \"When Will You Die\" were both featured on the British ‘Metal Forces’ magazine compilation LP ‘Demolition: Scream Your Brains Out’ in 1988 Metal Forces. The LP featured tracks from Leviathan (Chris Barnes (Cannibal Corpse/Six Feet Under) on vocals), Hobbs' Angel Of Death, Anacrusis & Atrophy. The appearance on the Metal Forces' compilation further expanded the band's international appeal\n\nFOAD\n\n12\n\nAFTERMATH\n\nWhen Will You Die? Demos '89/90\n\nThis LP includes their \"Words that echo fear\" Demo 1989, Roadrace Demo 1990 and a handful of live tracks from 1988. The record shows the band's natural development from blistering restless Thrashcore to a solid, controlled assault of pure THRASH with a progressive vibe, think of late '80s Voivod, Coroner crossovered with AFTERMATH's peculiar way to Thrash portrayed so greatly on the previous \"Killing the future\" Demo. Both demos landed them in all of the top metal magazines around the world, including: Kerrang, Metal Hammer, RIP, RAW and Metal Forces. \"Words that Echo Fear\" demo was picked by music journalist Don Kaye as on of the Ten Best Demos of the Year. In 1990, based on the huge international success of the Words that Echo Fear demo, the metal label RoadRacer Records (a subsidiary of Roadrunner Records) approached the band for a demo deal, which resulted in the four track demo featuring the songs ‘Eyes of Tomorrow’, ‘Afraid Of Time’, ‘The Act Of Unspoken Wisdom’ and 'Reflecting Pictures\", appearing on this LP entirely remastered to the best sounding quality you can think of\n\nFOAD\n\n12\n\nAGATHA\n\nGoatness\n\nEight heavy and doomy songs, a mix of sludge, noise, doom, punk played by just one distorted bass and powerful drums from this all-girls band. On this record Agatha's sound takes a heavier direction, with growl voices, screams and big bass chords. The LP comes out with a beautiful shaped watercolor artwork, painted by acclaimed italian tattoo artist Pietro Sedda and photo shots by ELena Buscemi.\n\nBasement City\n\n6\n\nAGATHOCLES\n\nThe LP's 1989-1991\n\nRe-release on vinyl of their 2 first LPs, the split with Lunatic Invasion and \"Suppose it was you\"... Essential pieces of grind noise!!! I can confess that the early Agathocles recordings are my favorites. This LP contains all their early hits (their early hits are all-time hits!) with this special \"rehearsal\" sounding really not \"clean\" at all and great! The good old times of real grindcore! The second part has a lot of live tracks, and contrary to \"Razor sharp dagger\" & \"Black clouds determinate\" live bonus tracks, this live material is not boring, without a big cheezy sound, just what grind needz: detuned guitars, blasting drums and simply grunt-roared or screamed vocals: what do you want more? Judge by the track listing, there are only great tracks! \"Fog\", \"The accident\" or \"Big one\": cult! cult! cult! The vinyl re- issue comes with lyrics and liner notes.\n\nPower It Up\n\n11\n\nAGATHOCLES\n\nThis is Not A Threat, It's A Promise\n\nPure old school, raw, mince-core blast!! new 12\", available in a sweet gatefold (first time for AxGx)!!\n\nGoatgrind\n\n10\n\nAGATHOCLES\n\nFull On Nippon\n\nLimited to 435 handnumbered copies. Includes an insert with tracklist, credits, lyrics and discography. This album was recorded at the \"Asakusa Extreme Festival\" in Asakusa Kurawood, Tokyo, Japan on the 27th or May 2011.\n\nBringer of Gore\n\n10\n\nAGATHOCLES\n\nAbrir Las Puertas\n\nSpecial AGATHOCLES release recorded in a studio during their 2007's South American tour. \"Abrir Las Puertas\" features a lot of the more recent songs by Agathocles, mixed with some classics on each side. So you can find modern tunes like Only Friction, Bang Bang, Axe The Tax, O.S.L. or Porcelain A mixed with some of the best songs we used to play at beach singalongs late on a summer night, like Razor Sharp Daggers, Splattered Brains or Mutilated Regurgitator. If you love the Belgian godfathers of grindcore, mince-core, good ol’ extreme music or socially aware stuff, you’ll love this record. The mixing is very clear and, surprisingly, very professionally done, with each instrument clearly recognizable and well balanced. 21 songs of mincing old school grind terrorism at its finest form.\n\nBringer of Gore\n\n9\n\nAGE OF COLLAPSE\n\nBurden Of Beast\n\nWhile undeniably melodic crust at it’s core, Burden of Beast, the first LP from San Diego based hardcore outfit, AGE OF COLLAPSE, traverses a very thin genre line occasionally teetering into the realms of related punk, metal, doom and more. Harsh vocals backed by crushing distortion give way to atmospheric, reverb laden interludes, which personify the bands complex, almost schizophrenic songwriting. Contempt for humanity and it’s deconstruction of the natural world gives life to a tragic landscape that plays out as the main theme of this powerful and inventive record. Recorded at Big Fish Studios by Dan Maier and mastered at Mammoth Sound by Dan Randall.\n\nAborted Society\n\n11\n\nAGHAST\n\nDeformities\n\nAghast are back on Agipunk after their first 7\"! raw wall of noise d-beat from the States, think about Confuse, Disclose, Eu's Arse, Gloom... 110% distortion! out in time for their euro tour summer 2007. 200 copies limited edition on yellow splattered vinyl\n\nAgipunk\n\n8\n\nAGNOSTIC FRONT\n\nVictim In Pain\n\nOne of the greatest genre-defining hardcore bands of all time, Agnostic Front, has changed the face of music throughout their 25-year-long career. The two records that started it all, United Blood and Victim in Pain, are legendary NYHC releases and some of the most sought after pieces of music for fans and collectors. Finally, these two releases are coming back to life via Bridge Nine Records. Agnostic Front�s second release, Victim In Pain, was recorded 1984. These album was a blast of pure New York hardcore that confirmed AF�s status as leaders of the NYHC movement alongside precursors the Cro-Mags and Murphy�s Law.\n\nBridge Nine\n\n13\n\nAGRIMONIA\n\nS/T\n\nAs Kleister wrote: \" ...Their \"demo\" cd hit me by surprise and I really couldn´t refuse to put this out! These folks come from Gothenburg in lovely Sweden and deliver the goods! The demo (minus 1 song though) that you´ll find on this black piece of vinyl hold 4 times thundering death and black metal soaked doom, with hints of crust, as well as atmospheric and epic darkness. The guitars range from devastating heaviness to gloomy acoustic sections, with piercing leads that flash through the darkness every now and then. If you´ve ever wanted to know exactly how your favourite metal, crust, and doom bands would have sounded like if they were one band this is where you should turn. I won´t namedrop anything, just ask you to take me on my word that you really need to check this out if you´ve been even the slightest intrigued with what´s written above. Even though I could drop many influential names, as well as list several of your favourite Swedish crustcore bands in the \"members of\" department. First 1100 copies comes in a nicely done gatefold....\" - i simply cannot say it better! This is by far one of the best and most grabbing releases i heard this year and it will be hard for everyone to top this for me.\n\nSkuld\n\n9\n\nAGRIMONIA\n\nHost Of The Winged\n\nThe wait was long, but now it´s ready! A dignified follow-up of their first album! An intense Dolp from this dark crust band from Gothenburg. I haven´t really enough words to describe this brutal yet twisted attack on my eardrums. Eight songs in just over 72 minutes(!) of death and blackmetal gloom with a healthy dose of crust punk influences leaving me speechless. The Double Lp comes in a beautiful gatefold with a foldout insert. CD version is being released in US by Profane Existence and should be available in the next update here as well. If you have the chance to see them on their US-West coast tour go ahead!!\n\nSkuld\n\n14\n\nAHNA / CETASCEAN\n\nSplit\n\nBoth are from Canada, with Ahna coming from the west coast and Cetascean hailing from Winnipeg (central Canada). The Ahna side has more in the way of Death metal influence, and is a little slower. The Cetascean side is a little more aggressive. This is a good combination of crust, black metal, death metal and sludge in reasonable doses. Great records by the way!\n\nProfane Existence\n\n11\n\nALASKAN\n\nDespair, Erosion, Loss\n\nDespair, Erosion, Loss is a brutal as fuck masterpiece that runs for a brisk 33 minutes or so. But don�t let the brief running time put you off. Alaskan are masters of writing intricate Sludge Metal Riffs that will destroy your world and leave you an emotional wreck. Alaskan have always been one of the loudest Sludge/Post-Metal bands around but nothing can prepare you for this. Alaskan have delivered a defining statement on the world around them. There are no easy answers on this album. Gary and Cory are immense on vocals breathing life into every note they shout their hearts out to. If you thought the last Neurosis album and masterpiece was angry, wait till you hear this.\n\nAlerta Antifascista\n\n12\n\nALEHAMMER\n\nBarmageddon\n\nThird output for Alehammer after the picture 10” and the split Lp with Tyrant from Sweden, as always on Agipunk. People coming from Prophecy of Doom, Doom, Impulse Manslaughter, Vallenfyre, Extinction of Mankind teaming up for the usual ale-fueled crust/metal attack. This new release is probably their most brutal and primitive ever, bulldozing riffs and vocals coming directly from the depths of hell, totally speakers-blowing!\n\nAgipunk\n\n10\n\nALMAX / MISTKAFER\n\nSplit\n\nFirst recording of this two bands, Almax, is basically “Karnvappen Attack” lineup and “Holocaust In Your Head”´s singer, adding a new guitar player and playing fast crustcore with slightly DISORDER undertone. kick ass! On the flipside we have “Mistkafer” that is a young all female promising band playing raw crust punk and kicking in quite some ass here. If you get the urge for the Barcelona / Espania Crust-Punk than you probably will discover two really promising bands on this slap o vinyl.\n\nMala Raza\n\n3\n\nALTERCADO\n\nEl Ruido Y La Rabia\n\nThe latest stuff fromt his great Chilean anarcho raw punk band, a bit more developed since the previous LP, and really fucking good\n\nLes Nains Aussi\n\n4\n\nAMEN 81\n\nCorpus Christi\n\n2xLP! Those 13 \"new\" songs are a good follow up to their last amazing Lp \"Zuruek aus Tasmanien\". They have made another step forward. Less dischargy sound this time more nasty Punk fucking Rock, better production, but still with enough anger and speed!!!\n\nSkuld\n\n7\n\nANATOMI 71\n\nFran Primat Till Reptil\n\nTen new songs of total fury. Harcore crust as it was meant to be. Ripping, intense, pulverizing! Anatomi-71 are back with the humor intact. A resolute rejection of all that human egocentrism and the reptilian brain-based self-interest means. Fans of Totalitar, No Security and Discharge won�t be disappointed!!!\n\nUnrest\n\n11\n\nANCIENT CHINESE SECRET\n\nCaveat Emptor\n\nFor a label that normally puts out either blazing power-violence or ultra-torturing sludge-core, Ancient Chinese Secret is a definite stand-out for Slap-a-Ham's entire back catalog. There are a couple reasons for this: for one, the minimal line-up consists of Spazz's Chris Dodge on bass, his wife Lydia on vocals and a drummer completing the line up, that's it. Second of all, there's not once ounce of metal or a trace of heaviness for that matter. Rather, ACS has more of an off-beat, quirky but non-threatening appeal to them. This is in part thanks to the lack of distortion and Lydia's ability to talk loudly into the mic rather than scream at the top of her lungs. Not to say that Caveat Emptor is bad or anything; on top of all this, the occasional tape loop samples -with the last track mixing a slew of cartoon sound effects-and speed metal drumming give this album it's own uniqueness. Playful, but not to the point of being wholesome family entertainment. ~ Mike DaRonco\n\nSlap A Ham\n\n8\n\nANGER BURNING\n\nWhen\n\nHailing from Sweden, Anger Burning deliver us an overdose of d-beat raw punk (kang) in the vein of Discharge and Anti Cimex. This is a full blast that wil make your ears bleed!\n\nRawmantic Disasters\n\n11\n\nANGER BURNING / EARTH CRUST DISPLACEMENT\n\nSplit\n\nAnger Burning with 7 older Tracks from 2010. Again perfect played D-Beat Hardcore Punk in the vein of Anti Cimex, Shitlickers and of course Discharge! Earth Crust Displacement from Berlin with 6 tracks and a cover (Dismachine) blistering Raw Dis-Noise Terror!!!\n\nRawmantic Disasters\n\n11\n\nANIHILATED\n\nPath To Destruction\n\nAnother quality reissue on Agipunk. Ipswich/UK Anihilated formed in 1980 as Prospex and deeply involved in the anarcho-punk scene. They soon started to add metal to their music, the first in UK playing this kind of crossover along with Onslaught, Sacrilege and Concrete Sox. This 12\" EP has been originally released in 1986 and for the first time is re-released on vinyl. A true gem that you need to own next to \"Behind the realms of madness and \"Power from hell\". Original cover artwork drawn back in the days by Mid/Deviated Instinct. Comes with original insert plus a new insert with a lot of never seen pictures, commentaries and lyrics. 1,000 copies press, 100 on dark blue vinyl + poster + obi, 50 of them come with exclusive t-shirt. colored vinyl 12 eur, with shirt 20 euro\n\nAgipunk\n\n10\n\nor20\n\nANTI-PASTI\n\nThe Last Call\n\nOfficial reissue of the legendary first record originally released by Rondelet Records in 1981. Catchy and powerful UK82 punk rock in the vein of early Exploited, Special Duties and Blitz.\n\nRadiation\n\n12\n\nANTI-PLAYAX\n\nValència Marca Registrada\n\nDebut release. Political, pissed, cynical, no-distorsion-just-agression hardcore punk. Some times fast as fuck less-than-one-minute songs, other times combining mid tempo drumming with sing-a-long tunes. Hardcore punk sung in catalan against human stupidity, tourist assholism, environmental problems, the police, social injustices and all those fucking clichés, yes, fuck us\n\nTrabuc\n\n4\n\nANTI YOU\n\nBlank Stares\n\nFor the first time on Agipunk, Anti You from Rome are gonna release their second LP. After a bunch of great 7�es and the amazing �Two-Bit Schemes And Cold War Dreams� first full length, this long time hardcore veterans scream again their rage with 16 tracks of fast and unbelievably catchy hardcore tunes. Old school as hell, they seem to be coming straight out of the �This Is Boston Not L.A.� legendary compilation.\n\nAgipunk\n\n10\n\nANTIDOTUM\n\nTestowane Na Ludziach\n\nLike Post Regiment, new band from Poland, great!!!\n\nSkuld\n\n6\n\nANTIGAMA\n\nDiscomfort\n\nHere is the second effort of the highly acclaimed Polish powerhouse now signed on Relapse. \"Discomfort\" delivers twelve discordant and chaotic shots full of mind-bending speed, technicality and savagery. It proves that vast grindcore made by ANTIGAMA is unparalleled. Punishing, shredding super-heavy modern-day sonic blast with most brutal and sickest vocals, powerful, precise guitar work and unbelievably fast and tight drumming stand out from most of the nowadays grind and metal bands. This greatly talented, unique quartet is the undisputed herald of a grind-squad assassination\n\nSelfmadegod\n\n6\n\nANTIGAMA\n\nStop The Chaos\n\nANTIGAMA return after 3 years of silence with the strongest line-up in the band's career! Featuring six tracks of the band's monolithic crushing power and cutting-edge grindcore tactics, \"Stop The Chaos\" is the most mature ANTIGAMA's material to date! This 12� EP is pretty much a nonstop aural assault completely hell bent on making the brain vomit. LIMITED TO 250 COPIES CLEAR RED VINYL + INSERT + A2 POSTER!!!\n\nSelfmadegod\n\n10\n\nANTIPRODUCT\n\nThe Deafening Silence\n\nAfter two outstanding 7\", they finally got their shit together to record this awesome piece of vinyl. 8 songs of powerful, raging Anarcho-Punk with Emo-HC influences & female / male vocals - the galloping basic Punk-Rock aspect in their music is gone. The production is heavy & way better than their previous efforts.\n\nSkuld\n\n9\n\nAPARTMENT 213\n\nCleveland Power Violence\n\nSince their inception over 20 years ago in Cleveland, Ohio- APARTMENT 213 has represented embodiment of inbred brutality and all things wrong. Stompy, metallic hardcore that has been distilled to satisfy the finest standards. This is unforgiving, confronting, fighting music- the end of the road. Album includes collaborations with LOCKWELD and BASTARD NOISE.\n\nFuck Yoga\n\n12\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nMoney Is Not My Currency\n\nGreat HC-Punk from Finland from 1983 including the mega rare \"HuoRa\" EP. Comes with a full colors poster insert!\n\nHohnie\n\n12\n\nARCHAGATHUS / WOJTYLA\n\nSplit\n\nBreslau thrash/grind/crust band with female vocals Wojtyla presenting 6 songs from the same session as split EP with Unholy Grave. Against Archagathus - raw Canadian mincecore in vein of Agathocles, Rot or Malignant Tumour. 11 short songs recorded in 2009. Known from tons of splits, tapes all over the world!!! Press: 400 copies on black vinyl\n\nZaraza\n\n7\n\nARCHAGATHUS\n\nCoffee Grinder\n\nThe Canadian mince core kings with their new LP, 14 new mince tunes recorded between 2008 and 2011. Awesome material. Limited press.\n\nBringer of Gore\n\n10\n\nARCTIC FLOWERS\n\nReveries\n\nPortland's Arctic Flowers are totally into british anarcho post-punk and everything that was great about Corpus Christi collective, but yet, their songs seem incredibly fresh and not cliche. The band features punk veteran Stan (ex-Signal Lost) on guitar, Defect Defect's drummer and some crusties from Bog People \\ Vivid Sekt. Fans of Rubella Ballet, La Fraction, Hagar The Womb and the likes, will love this record!\n\nTrujaca Fala\n\n11\n\nARCTIC FLOWERS\n\nWeaver\n\nPortland�s Arctic Flowers with their long-awaited second LP! After last year�s excellent \"Procession\" EP, an EP that showcased the Flowers� talent for combining the tradition of anarcho/peace punk with a postpunk sensibility, the new \"Weaver\" LP continues in much the same vein. The first side kicks off with the energetic track \"Magdalene\" and the pace doesn�t let up too much from there, culminating in the barnstorming track \"Anamnesis\", which employs a riff that reminds me of a Rudimentary Peni track (specifically, \"The Evil Clergyman\" off RP's \"Cacophony\"). But it's Side 2 that contains my favorite tracks off this new release. The second side kicks off with the memorable track �Byzantine�, guitarist Stan Wright lays down a chunky, Killing Joke-esque riff (think of that band�s song \"Tension\" mixed with \"The Wait\"), complemented by frontwoman Alex's vocals, which recall the classic goth-punk of bands like Rubella Ballet and Lost Cherrees. The following title track, \"Weaver\" is another winner � just a great mid-tempo punk rocker that, in true Arctic Flowers fashion, blurs the boundaries between classic punk, postpunk, and early gothic rock. Indeed, in an interview I did with Arctic Flowers almost two years ago, founder and guitarist Stan Wright stated, \"Our sound is a mix of punk, deathrock, post punk, and goth. Aggressive but at times danceable and melodic.\"\n\nSabotage\n\n12\n\nARMAGEDOM\n\nSem Esperancas\n\nBrazilian hardcore legends playing since 1984 recorded new album. 15 thrashcore songs with typical Brazilian 80�s old school sound. Remastered by Bri / Doom at 1 in 12 club.\n\nInsane Society\n\n10\n\nARMAGEDOM\n\nDez Mil Anos De Terror\n\nImpressive new full length by this long time Brazilian hardcore punk thrash veterans. They started in the early eighties and still have lots of things to say and to play. This record is simply a pleasant torture for your ears. Put together old school Brazilian punk hardcore with a good dose of crust and an amazing touch of old school Brazilian death/thrash metal (you know what I�m talking about�). Shake it up and you�ll have the best cocktails ever!\n\nInsane Society\n\n11\n\nARMISTICE\n\nFluff Anff\n\nThis is an early discography from this long running Southern California political peacepunk band. 16 songs from way out of print compilations, the split 7\" ep with Flux of Disorder, the s/t ep, and a few unreleased versions. In the vein of Final Conflict, Crucifix, and Discharge. Armistice are among the best peace punk / crust bands going in Southern California. This LP collects together all of their early compilation tracks, EP and split EP (with Flux of Disordder) tracks, and even some unreleased material. This is an important collection of songs that have otherwise been unavailable for several years now. (Slug And Lettuce)\n\nDespotic\n\n4\n\nARPHAXAT\n\nLoudun La Maudite\n\nThe long awaited full-length album from the mighty ARPHAXAT now awaits! Truly Necro & Morbid Blasphemous hymns, NOT for open-minded idiots who have no idea what true primitive Black Metal is about! Consists of Shaxul (ex-HIRILORN, ex-founding DEATHSPELL OMEGA member, SABBAT (Jpn) session member, etc). and DRAKEN (ex-Putrefactor). \"Loudun la Maudite\" forges even more holocaustic and obscurity, inspired by their majestic and mysterious myths of Pictavia. Those possessed by their 2003 demo tape easily know what to expect from this obscure album.\n\nHell's Headbangers\n\n11\n\nARTYMUS PYLE\n\nCivil Dead\n\nLoud, hurtful and heavy-as-fuck downtuned crunch and blinding hardcore fury from the re-tooled members of FUCKFACE. As hyperactive and mean as ever, but with added elements of dark and heavy. It's on Prank so you know you're going to get an earful.\n\nPrank\n\n11\n\nASSHAMMER / SUFFERING MIND\n\nSplit\n\nMembers of Capitalist Casualties, Catheter and Skarp playing old school grindcore. Same gos for the polish fellow mates\n\nZaraza\n\n6\n\nATAVIST / NADJA\n\nSplit\n\nATAVIST (UK) and NADJA (Canada) represent an abstract detraction from both of the bands previous works. The feel of the album is one of blissful escapism presented through harmonious audio manipulation, intricate melody and polarizing heaviness. This release sees Atavist / Nadja placing the listener into an dreamlike environment throughout the albums two expansive tracks by using an innovative array of layered sounds, abstract guitar work, subsonic bass levels and delicate electronics to give a desolate, yet warm full length album. It's not a split album, rather a collaborate effort between Atavist & Nadja with each artist bringing their own components to the whole.\n\nKreation\n\n10\n\nATENTADO\n\nAntagonist\n\nAtentado started in the end of 1991 in the suburbs of Lisbon as the follow-up of Grind/Crust pioneers Atrofiados. But it was a short lived experience and the band ended, without even playing any live shows, the day they were entering the studio to record for a split LP with Finnish friends Selfish, this ended up beeing the Doom/Selfish Split LP. Twenty years after, bass player Pedro do Vale\"Pitchi\" resurrected the band and \"Paradox\" was released in 2011. Some line up changes, right after the release of the debut album, put the band in a short hiatus to return stronger than ever for some great live shows and the recording of their new Antagonist\" lp, which contains 11 tracks of loud and uncompromising metal influenced HC/Punk in 25 minutes. Recorded and mixed by Fernando Matias at The Pentagon Audio Manufacturers and Mastered by Brad Boatright at AUDIOSIEGE (Tragedy, Nails�). What you can hear is a great mix of Motorhead influenced crust (like later Anti Cimex) with a great Celtic Frost/Venom Discharged edge!\n\nAgipunk\n\n10\n\nATMAN\n\nNo Recordaren A La Mort\n\nLast opus from Darshan & Damastor (EMPTY). A step beyond for the band. Malefic and obscure Black Metal\n\nIshtadeva\n\n11\n\nAUSTRASIAN GOAT, The\n\nStains Of Resignation\n\nOriginally started since 4 years and after a bunch of Eps, splits an compilations records, here's finally the second full lenght by THE AUSTRASIAN GOAT, one-man band project leaded by Julien Louvet. After one year of work, this record is built by 9 various tracks, between furious black metal, atmoshperic funeral doom and folk ballads, surely his best and mature work ever. There are also a lot of guest appearances on this album like JARBOE on « Voice of Aenima ».\n\nMusicfearsatan\n\n15\n\nAUSTRASIAN GOAT, The\n\nPaved Intentions\n\nFinally a new full length by the goat ! and he said, this is the first record he's done that he's 100% happy with... the austrasian goat in his black metal or doom songs always creates a special dark mood , an atmosphere that only the austrasian goat is able to put into music. on this here album he slows down a lot and takes a step back from metal ; those new songs have a touch of bands like swans or horseback, or even the neurosis sideprojects ( scott kelly , steve von till ); this album has more atmosphere than his previous releases, it will take you on a trip down to your deepest emotions...\n\nVendetta\n\n15\n\nAUTISTIC YOUTH\n\nIdle Minds\n\nLong awaited 2nd album from hardworking PDX youngsters, following up their classic “Landmine Beach” LP, as well as singles on Black Water, Rock Bottom, Taken By Surprise, and more. Driving, melodic punk/hardcore (but NOT “melodic hardcore” if ya get the distinction) with dark, swirling undercurrents. Catcy but not at all vapid. Sounding like a cross between Portland, Southern California, and Copenhagen, you could compare this to bands like Observers/Red Dons, No Hope For The Kids, Articles Of Faith, Reagan Youth, The Wipers, Adolecscents, etc etc.\n\nBlack water\n\n10\n\nAUXILIO\n\nS/T\n\nDebut release from this D-beat Crust band with members of Maldito Pais and Derrota, among others, with10 tracks (plus an Anticimex cover) filled with anger and hate from the human wasteland that is Valencia. Short and simple lyrics (spitting hate never needed much ornaments) complemented with some text in the insert. 3-way partnership in the artwork (Front, back and insert) that looks solid nevertheless.\n\nTrabuc\n\n11\n\nAVSKUM\n\nPunkista\n\nCharged and furious, classic Swedish Punk carved out of D-Beat and DISCHARGE, blasting with Hoarse vocals and a wall of guitars. This is the third LP by Swedish legend's AVSKUM, who have existed on and off the Swedish hardcore punk scene since the early 1980's. This LP is marked with unqiue twists and turns that challenge and defy the formula while satisfying both fans of the bands old dirgy style \"Ingen Manniska Ar Illegal\" and full on DISCHARGE style attack \"Children of war\". Vital and powerful, Punkista was recorded at Sunlight Studios (entombed) in 2002.\n\nPrank\n\n12\n\nAVSKUM\n\nUppror Underifran\n\nBlasting an unrelenting wall of D-beat hardcore, Resonating with vitality, \"Uppror Underifran\" (translated loosely \"Uproar from the Underground\") by Swedish Legends AVSKUM is stunningly, their most severe record in the band's 26 year history. An overkill attack of smashing drums and guitar riffage, This Fourth Lp hearkens back to their 1982 origins , with a heavy DISCHARGE bent ala' ANTI-CIMEX mired with the incomprehensibily raw, blunt and brutal song structures found in the original era of Swedish hardcore punk. The MOTORHEAD-ish rock overdrive of their previous Prank LP's is still cranked with the curt economy of masters at the top of their game, capped with AVSKUM's inventive song structures and always great, trademark harsh vocals, all captured in a exceptional recording from Gothenburg's EVIL GRILL studio and slapped in a cool sleeve by Swedish artist CRASH MANGE. Taking a four year break since their last LP,\"Punkista\", the band took time writing \"Uppror Underifran\" to deliver 16 incredibly rock solid tracks that transition from their previous recordings to now have largely entirely Swedish lyrics, but still take relevant aim at U.S. War Policy, Capitalism and Mass consumption. Stunningly one of the band's best outings to date.\n\nPrank\n\n12\n\nAWAKENING\n\nEternal Blizzard\n\nThe Awakening pummeled the midest for two straight years. They found their voice from the environmental devestation of south-eastern Ohio, and the shifting paradigm of post-911. Dennis' post-apocalyptic lyrics were on par with 80's era metal, and their guitar riffs are soaked with palm muted gallops. The Awakening utilized the complexity of metal compositions, paired with the rawness of Japanese and Swedish punk. This discography LP featured their 3 7” releases + 6 unreleased track\n\nLife under one Tree\n\n3\n\nAXE BATTLER\n\nThe Wrath Of My Steel\n\nChilean Heavy Metal!! Total 80s Metal worship!! Black Vinyl, Sticker, Poster, 4-Paged Inlay, Band Picture +3 Bonus Tracks!!\n\nHeavy Forces\n\n11\n\nAXEGRESSOR\n\nCommand\n\nAXEGRESSOR are simply, shall we say, playing thrash fucking metal. Yes, the adverb ‘fucking’ DOES matter here. And it will to you too once you’ll find yourself all dizzy and knocked down on the floor, wondering what the fuck happened. And then you’ll remember you simply put your ‘Command’ LP on. No wonder they have a fucking tank on the cover… To put it simply, ‘Command’ is a ten tracker, thirty-eight minutes long album of thrash fucking metal, falling somewhere in between SODOM, DESASTER and one heavy shrapnel rain. Enough said!\n\nDoomentia\n\n8\n\nAXEGRINDER\n\nGrind The Enemy\n\nAxegrinder are usually remembered for their “Rise of the serpent men” Lp released by Peaceville Records in 1989, a metal/punk hybrid masterpiece alongside Deviated Instinct, Prophecy of Doom, Bolt Thrower, Genital Deformities... But before that Lp there has been a demo released in 1987, this is “Grind the enemy”, showing an even stronger later Amebix influence, probably Axegrinder’s biggest source of inspiration. One of those tapes able to shake the underground now is finally issued on vinyl.\n\nPelvic alee\n\n10\n\nAXXION\n\nS/T\n\nFrom The Dephts Of True 80s Metal Sound, Axxion Rocks The World With Their First Output. This Release Unleashes The Spirit\n\nFrom The Past And Hits You Like Thunder With 6 Tracks Of Iron Glory (Including A Bonus Song).\n\nHeavy Forces\n\n11\n\nBACKLASH\n\nRealities Of Life\n\nNew Finnish band, burning spirit hardcore in the best Japanese tradition!!\n\nSelf\n\n10\n\nBAD BRAINS\n\nRock For Light\n\n�Rock for Light� is the second official full-length album by hardcore punk pioneers Bad Brains. It was produced by Rick Ocasek of The Cars. The album contains a number of re-recorded songs from the band's first album, released the previous year, as well as a number of new HC, Punk and Reggae tracks. It was the last Bad Brains album to feature only these two styles of music, as the band eventually experimented with Funk, Soul and Heavy Metal.\n\nFan Club\n\n11\n\nBANxTHIS!\n\nS/T\n\nItalian young kids coming from Bologna. 110% unadulterated 80's California hc in the vein of Black Flag or Adolescents with a touch of 70's rock a-là Black Sabbath! Intense lyrics as well, unmissable! 666 copies press, 166 on white vinyl available only through mailorder\n\nAgipunk\n\n6\n\nBARBED WIRE\n\nThe Age That Didn't Care\n\nOriginally out on the highly collectable OI! Records label (run by Oppressed's frontman and S.H.A.R.P. ideologist Roddy Moreno) in 1986, The Age That Didn't Care was the only full length by Scottish punks/skinheads Barbed Wire who split in 1988. Top notch pissed off UK82 punk hardcore!\n\nRadiation\n\n12\n\nBATILLUS / WHITEHORSE\n\nSplit\n\nTwo heavyweights team up for one record, australia's whitehorse deliever one long track of their brutal corrupted influenced sludge / doom, filled with strange noises ; batillus do 2 tracks of their cold post-metal influenced doom, filled with synthnoises and ultra brutal vocals ; both sides were mastered by james plotkin\n\nVendetta\n\n10\n\nBATILLUS\n\nFurnace\n\nA Storm of Light members. \"Big on atmosphere, big on time and big on tone, the first album from Brooklyn doomers Batillus is a bleak, oppressive six-song outing that’s bound to ring their name out among the underground converted. Doom heads, be aware. The band, which formed as an instrumental trio and later added be-dreadlocked vocalist Fade Kainer (Inswarm, Jarboe, occasionally Man’s Gin), have unleashed a monster in Furnace. With one guitar, one bass, one set of drums, one vocalist and a host of effects and synths, they set up posts along a range of heavy-footed doomscape managing to incorporate some of post-metal’s progressive ideology while almost completely avoiding the now-clichéd traps of that genre. Fans of Suma, Unearthly Trance, Ufomammut and other drone-conscious neo-doomers will want to take note of the four-piece’s methodology, impressive and punishing in equal measure as it is.\"\n\nVendetta\n\n8\n\nBESTHOVEN\n\nDis Means War\n\nFinally a new Lp for the brazilian one man d-beat army! pure d-beat, equally influenced by Anti Cimex/Shitlickers as well as Discharge, and spiced with brazilian 80's brazilian hardcore. Out for their euro tour august/september 2011, 1000 copies, 100 of them on colored vinyl. All the copies come with silver-foil stamped logo\n\nAgipunk\n\n10\n\nBI-MARKS\n\nThe Golden Years\n\nMembers of NERVESKADE and BOG PEOPLE come together from the demise of both groups to play ripping hardcore rock-n-roll along the lines of ADOLESCENTS, ZERO BOYS, SICK PLEASURE, WILLFUL NEGLECT, MOTORHEAD, ANNIHILATION TIME, and even a touch of BLACK SABBATH. This is seriously a raging album and probably the perfect 'get this party started' soundtrack.\n\nStatic Shock\n\n11\n\nBICKLE'S CAB\n\nForests Of Grey\n\nFurious crust punk from UK with harsh vocals\n\nPain of Mind\n\n3\n\nBIG BOYS\n\nWreck Collection\n\nIf you are of the opinion that the Big Boys can do no wrong, then this anthology (compiled by celebrated hardcore producer Spot) runs the gamut from grubby-sounding demos to slick selected outtakes. Fairly coherent, this set does little to elevate The Boys' reputation, but is as strong an historical overview as is likely to ever be released.\n\nGern Blandsten\n\n20\n\nBIG BOYS\n\nLullabies / No Matter\n\nDOUBLE-LP re-issue of BOTH classic first 2 albums by the Texas-Punk legends BIG BOYS, originally released in 1983 resp. 1984! Packed in a gatefold-cover, featuring all the original artwork, plus inserts with lyrics and photos!\n\nX-Mist\n\n20\n\nBLACK BLOOD WORLD / ESKATOL\n\nSplit\n\n15 tracks of raging hardcore punk, mixed with everything from grind to punk. Even though the bands are quite new, the people involved has history from bands such as Summon The Crows, Amok and others. Norway attacks!\n\nBombs Away\n\n5\n\nBLACK CRUCIFIXION\n\nPromethean Gift\n\nB.C. started in 1991 in Finland sharing members with Beherit, and this is their first official output from 1993 reissued with 4 bonus tracks (demo + live), old school black/dark metal, a must!\n\nSoulseller\n\n11\n\nBLACK CRUCIFIXION\n\nThe Fallen One Of Flames\n\nDemo '92 reissue!! This band was one of the pioneers of Finnish Black Metal in the early '90's along with their brother band Beherit. This particular release is not far removed from Beherit's \"Drawing Down the Moon\" album. This re-release will feature a different layout and re-mastered, all by the band personally.\n\nSoulseller\n\n11\n\nBLACK CRUCIFIXION\n\nHope Of Retaliation\n\nBlack Crucifixion is an archetypal representation of an outfit whose career spans over a period that mocks the scope of an elephant’s long-term memory while still bearing little resemblance to anything you would call active, let alone prolific. Twenty years, a fistful of demo material, one EP, a lonesome full-length, a stray over-the-top live recording plus a smattering of gigs: That sporadic output would probably inspire the devil’s advocates and other whistle-blowers to grumble about a lengthy-yet unproductive career not worth fawning upon, but these one-time Laplanders beg to differ. Namely, Hope of Retaliation, their most recent offering, presents four new tunes (well, three actual songs and one interlude) and five live tracks that run the gamut of their whole discography with their sole purpose to celebrate the band’s twentieth anniversary. While the aforementioned hallucinatory polemicists might make a rather convincing case, HoR simply renders the charges null and void through sheer quality.\n\nSoulseller\n\n11\n\nBLACK FREIGHTER\n\nGraves And Monuments\n\nBlack Freighter's sound is dirty ; downtuned guitars , lots of feedback ; brutal and aggressive vocals ; you can hear influences from eye hate god to godflesh to coalesce and his hero is gone ; a perfect mix of sludge / industrial / hardcore\n\nVendetta\n\n9\n\nBLACK HOLE OF CALCUTTA\n\nS/T\n\nNew full lenght LP for this band w/Makai members from California, 12 tracks of fast grind-core darkness.\n\nAlready several split w/ Gatt, Wojczech, Bloody Phoenix, Lycanthrophy, Human Error and an European tour in 2009.\n\nI Feel Good\n\n9\n\nBLACK JESUS\n\nBlack Jesus Saves\n\nOnly 300 copies pressed, 150 Red Vinyl, 150 Black Vinyl. Comes with a lyrics sheet printed on textured red cardstock.\n\nOriginally recorded in gritty analog in 2010 and released earlier this year on CD by TRENCH HELL's The Coffins Slave label, BLACK JESUS' debut Black Jesus Saves demo is being damned to black gold - 12\" vinyl, that is! Much like their Australian forebears, BLACK JESUS favor the filthy 'n' headbanging side of heavy metal, but also nod to '80s gods like REPULSION, AUTOPSY & NIHILIST: get in, get out, desecrate! Black Jesus Saves is unholy, grinding Metal of Death from the grave which only the Australian outback can create - welcome your salvation, down on your knees!\n\nHells Headbangers\n\n11\n\nBLACK PANDA\n\nA La Caza Del U-666\n\nA Coru�a�s Thrash-Punk-R�n�R guerrilla is back!! 6 years after their debut LP �Tanque de 98 Octanos� and their following Splits with both AUKTION and HOLOCAUST IN YOUR HEAD, BLACK PANDA is back with more of their greasy bend of Thrash, Punk and Rock�n�Roll, perfect soundtrack for their bizarre stories of dope-heads, concrete pirates, junkies, freaks and other beloved local low-lifes. Eight new tracks plus a re-recorded song from their first album and a surprise hidden-track. Artwork was again in �lvaro L�ped hands, as in all their other records.\n\nTrabuc\n\n11\n\nBLACK SEPTEMBER\n\nThe Forbidden Gates Beyond\n\nChicago's metal punks has put out a new record of pure black metal with a touch of crust, it sounds furious, violent and powerful. They have been working hard on building up their own sound, i just love the way how it sound this full lenght and the voice of the girl, definitly some of the best stuff from chicago right now. Higly Recommended.\n\nShaman\n\n13\n\nBLACK SHAPE OF NEXUS\n\nS/T\n\n3 songs ( about 45 minutes ) of massive doom, think khanate meets corrupted, mastered by JAMES PLOTKIN ( old lady drivers, khanate, phantomsmasher )\n\nVendetta\n\n11\n\nBLACK SHAPE OF NEXUS / LAZAROUS BLACKSTAR\n\nSplit\n\nFor this eagerly-awaited Split LP, the North-West of England meths the North-West of German as two storming merchants of doom crash headlong into each other for half-an-hour of immersive Sturm und Drang. From an early pressurized melting pot where Bradford and Liverpool�s Lazarus Blackstar crust-coated doom and blackened death-drone brews inside a morphing structure, the record steadily winds up the tempo until Mannheim sexted Black Shape Of Nexus take over and begin to introduce experimental layers of feedback and replace grit with groove. It all adds up to a wonderfully wretched experience that aims to bury you deep beneath six-feet of stinking, blackened soil. Setting off through the sludge and buzz-heavy riffing of Lazarus Blackstar�s �Command and Control�, Mik Hell�s growl and dissonant rage pitch us downwards until they find their spiritual nadir in a ponderous hole where two sets of layered vocals tear lumps out of each other upon a bedrock of whining drone. From here they dust themselves off and settle into the patchwork quilt of sections that form �Whispering Through Broken Teeth�. Reminiscent of St. Vitus and, to a point, Eyehategod there is also a moment where, disconcertingly, it all begins to sound a bit like a slowed-down Iron Maiden tape. Walking you through, we�ve got an introductory riff that cuts abrasively into a rumbling verse, before heading down to half-time for the chorus and then out into a displaced, yet memorably upbeat riff. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum. Experimenting with much more success, B.SON tug at their Neurosis chain and flush out a tongue-in-cheek offering to the Gods of doom. The 11-minute �Honor Found In Delay�, littered with psychedelic hits of feedback and noisy electronica, gets you deep in the gut with a thunderous, soul-shaking series of chords. The construction is much more organic here and stands in direct opposition to Lazarus Blackstar�s harsh segues. When they find their chug-friendly two-note doom boots they stomp about in them like pigs in muck with Malte Seidel screaming blue murder from, what sounds like, the other side of the street. Best of all, closer �Always And Only� spends its entire 9-minute length revelling in the joys that a simple-spined, steadily evolving, quality tongue-and-groove doom song can supply. And who better than George Orwell to provide the LP�s morbid epitaph? His soundbite taken from the BBC Series �The Life Of Orwell� plays this intriguingly miserablist LP out � �If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face� forever�.\n\nAlerta Antifascista\n\n12\n\nBLACKOUT\n\nS/T\n\nFrom the storms of Minneapolis' sub-zero winters hails BLACKOUT with their debut. Drawing on equal parts hardcore, punk, blues, and metal, this is ten tracks of raw, unabided Midwest madness. Recorded by Jon Greenslit at the House of Misery Studios in 2006, this is the alcoholic soundtrack for the apocalypse - a heavy influential doseage of Motorhead and Poison Idea while retaining a strong DIY punk sensibility. Impeccably catchy riffs and bluesy guitar solos wind their way through songs of drinking and rogue debauchery. Includes current and ex-members of Provoked, Scorned, Stillborn, Assrash, and Phalanx, among others.\"\n\nAborted Society\n\n5\n\nBLITZ\n\nTime Bomb\n\nA pure shot of abrasive punk/rock 'n' roll with a hint of working class Oi!, Blitz were among the most influential punk bands ever.\"All Out Attack EP\", \"Never Surrender/Razors In The Night EP\", \"Warriors EP\",\"New Age EP\" together their very first recording session from 1980, the legendary 'Timebomb' demos, and 4 cuts from the \"Voice Of A Generation\" demos Are all compiled in this awesome release!\n\nRadiation\n\n12\n\nBLOOD I BLEED\n\nHigh Octane Thrash\n\nFounded in 2002 by former members of well-known violent hardcore/grindcore outfit My Minds Mine, high quality music with an enormous potential for success in the underground community is what you can expect from Holland's Blood I Bleed. Essentially a logical continuation of what the Dutchmen have been doing for years, yet a new approach to the overall expression based on and inspired by renown acts like Heresy, Intense Degree or S.O.B\n\nTVG\n\n4\n\nBLOOD I BLEED\n\nGod's Out Of Monsters\n\nThe long-awaited first full length by the Dutch high-speed maniacs BLOOD I BLEED is here. The guys, whose members made up 3/4 of the legendary MY MINDS MINE line-up, deliver unrelenting hyper-fastcore/grind that is raw as a crusty snot stain on a filthy flannel shirt. Capturing the rage and speed in the studio was obviously more important to these veterans of grind than getting a clean, polished performance, and that makes \"Gods Out of Monsters\" so much the better. There isn't a whole lot of variation here; they've just focused on intensity and lots of it. The album contains 23 songs and even features an ENEMY SOIL cover to boot. It's all go, no slow! If you dig HELLNATION, HERESY and INTENSE DEGREE then this is for you. Don't let it get away!!!\n\nFast'n'Furious\n\n8\n\nBLOODY PHOENIX\n\nOde To Death\n\nBxPx are back again, billowing out barrels of grind that will pollute your mind like a 6-ft bong hit. As with their debut LP (now sold out), BxPx continue the tradition of no-thrills grindcore, keeping it direct and burtal not unlike their earlier band EXCRUCIATING TERROR.\n\n625Thrash\n\n11\n\nBLOWBACK\n\nLiving Vibration\n\nThe finest Nigata hardcore-punk, BLOWBACK 's new work after an interval of 2 years from previous one! \"living vibration\" contains 11 tracks of Japanese hardcore-punk with skills, tension, and individuality. This includes 7 new songs and a couple re-recorded tracks from their previous releases.\n\nBlack Water\n\n11\n\nBLOWN TO BITS / DEATHTOLL\n\nSplit\n\nDeathtoll and Blown To Bits are both from the Bay Area in California. Deathtoll bring on a thick guitar sound drawn from scandi-influenced writing and vocals that punish your eardrums. Contains ex-members of Attitude Adjustment and Deface. Blown To Bits are total crustpunk full of dbeats and clever guitar hooks.\n\nDespotic\n\n3\n\nBLUNT / NAGASAKI NIGHTMARE\n\nSplit\n\nItaly vs Spain, dark-emo crust influenced by Madame Germen, Ekkaia, From Ashed Rise...\n\nBe Part\n\n6\n\nBOMBS AWAY\n\n10 Songs EP\n\nA repressing of their \"DISTORTED THRASH PROTESTATION\" 12\" from 2001. Aggressive Portland Hardcore punk similar to Talk Is Poison or Deathreat. Comes kn a hand screened cover complete with new layout.\n\nself\n\n6\n\nBOMBSTRIKE / REIGN OF BOMBS\n\nSplit\n\nSwedish mangel! d-beat attack, Bombstrike are well known, Reign of Bombs have a rock feeling, crushing anyway!!\n\nWasted Sounds/Yellow Dog\n\n3\n\nBONEBLACK\n\nS/T\n\nLimited pressing of 500 copies\n\nRelentless Vegan Anarchist Dark Crust / Dbeat with crushing Breakdowns, Primarly Female Vocals with \"The Baron\" type Male backup vocals. Recently went on a 5 week tour accross canada and usa and sold half the pressing!\n\nMercy of Slumber\n\n11\n\nBORIS\n\nDemo Vol. 3\n\nMore centered around the doom aspects of the band with the original four-member lineup. The songs are fine examples of the beginnings of this completely unpredictable band. These songs can be distinguished completely from previous performances as much as much as could be compared. Experimental and raw, you could find amusement at the strenuously manic vocals, or even miss the static wails of later-Wata's screaming solos, but here is a different band evident not by missing elements of other notable releases, but portrayals of other nuances filling the spaces in the air.\n\nNo Label\n\n12\n\nBOXED IN\n\nS/T\n\nAfter singles on Crime Scene and Busted Head Records comes the full length from this bunch of longstanding UK punks. Thirteen songs in just 18 minutes. No ballads here, just full speed ahead thrashing-punk.\n\nCrime Scene\n\n3\n\nBRAINBOMBS\n\nS/T\n\nSecond part of their singles collection. This double LP features their �Macht / B.L.E.E.D.� EP (1998), �Stigma Of The Ripper / Street Cleaner� EP (2003), �The Grinder / Mommy Said� EP (2004), �I Need Speed� EP (2006), �Stinking Memory / Insects� (2007) and the �Live Action At Rock All, Oslo� (1994). For those who are not confident on Brainombs, this notorious Swedish fuck-ups deliver open-sore rock damage, played simple, ugly and for maximum effect. A total car wreck, with guts spread all over the highway. Bee-yootiful!!!\n\nArmageddon\n\n17\n\nBREMEN\n\nS/T\n\nSpace/Krautrock with members form Brainbombs. Gatefold double LP. 500 copies made.\n\nSkrammel\n\n17\n\nBRISTLES\n\nBigger Than Punk\n\nBrand new album for the swedish punk legends!!!\n\nNoise of Sweden\n\n11\n\nBROKEN BONES\n\nFuck You And All You Stand For\n\nLatest release by the mighty metal punk band from UK. This is a total dive in the past with great songs that could have easily been recorded back in 1984!\n\nRodent Popsicle\n\n11\n\nBRUTAL KNIGHTS\n\nFeast Of Shame\n\nTime was when Brutal Knights were more of a funny band whose shenanigans made you giggle and whose music functioned as a soundtrack to their public debauchery. Well, Brutal Knights are still a funny band but Feast of Shame is a whole lot more than aural wallpaper to Friday night�s shit fest. An ass-walloping 14 songs in 18 minutes, the band demonstrate a clever sense of humour on songs like \"We Have A Website� (chorus: \"Brutal Knights dot fucking com�) but from the beginning of fiery opener \"The Perfect Buffet� the band manage to meld insane energy, catchy barked vocals and an instrumental backing that recalls the outright aggression of Hardcore 81. Nick Flanagan, the group�s vocalist, does his best to play dumb, but this just affords him the opportunity to take the piss out of any and all of his chosen targets.\n\nP.Trash\n\n11\n\nBRUTAL TRUTH\n\nEvolution In One Take: For Gindfreaks Only Vol. 2\n\nThe title says it all� The band needs no introduction� So what can I say? 19 tracks professional recorded live at Mark-It-Zero Studios in New Jersey. IT�S TIME TO GRIND!\n\nRelapse\n\n11\n\nBURMESE / POTOP\n\nSplit\n\nBURMESE offer 8 ugly tracks of noise; ranging from damaged rock to primitive grind bursts, sadistic power electronics and cold, haunting drones; a claustrophobic amalgamation of frequencies akin to MAN IS THE BASTARD, BRAINBOMBS and WHITEHOUSE. Tectonic grooves, blackened guitars and hellish screams make for POTOP’s side. Primitive and crippled doom metal, been compared to BURNING WITCH, KHANATE and power violence without the fast parts. Heavy stuff for real. 17 minutes from each band, pressing of 500 hand numbered copies\n\nFuck Yoga\n\n7\n\nBUSH\n\nNew American Century\n\nAfter their debut 7\" on 625 and two split 7\"s with Dick Cheney and Bruce Banner finally B.U.S.H.s debut full length is out. These guys play furious and energetic skatepunk like in the good 80s. If you like Cirkle Jerks, Black Flaf or JFA you will love them! The lp has 14 tracks of hardcore punk spiced with 60s garage and post-punk influences, a very cool recording and even much better creafted songs than their earlier material.\n\nThrashbastard\n\n5\n\nCAMPUS STERMINII\n\nLife Is A Nightmarish Struggle\n\nAfter their split LP with Disgusting Lies, the split 7\" with Nulla Osta and a small hiatus, Campus Sterminii are back stronger than ever. The songwriting has improved, we are still into the realms of crust but with a wider range of influences going from Driller Killer to Hellshock, from Amebix to State Fear. Prepare for an original record that fears no competition! Cover artwork By Stiv of War. Limited to 500 copies, 100 on purple-stained clear vinyl!\n\nAgipunk\n\n8\n\nCANNABIS CORPSE / GHOUL\n\nSplit\n\nSplatterhash, the new split EP from Cannabis Corpse & Ghoul, is such a great combination of artists. Kicking things off with weed-themed death metal group Cannabis Corpse gets you into a super chilled out death metal state of mind and then Ghoul comes in and beat the shit out of you for trying to relax while listening to heavy music. The beauty of the split is that while they're both playing fairly different styles of music, it's similar enough to flow as a cohesive unit without getting muddy at the break between artists.\n\nTank Crimes\n\n14\n\nCAPITALIST CASUALTIES / HELLNATION\n\nSplit\n\n11 years in the making, a monument to all out melt down thrash!!!! 9 political hardcore blasts from C.C (first recording in 9 years) on the Iraq war, environmental destruction and a fish!!! 12 brand new carpet bombing detonations from Kentucky bastards HN: annihilating, catchy and relentlessly pissed off!\n\nSix Weeks\n\n10\n\nCARCASS\n\nReek Of Putrefaction\n\nReissue of the first legendary record by the mighty UK band. Originally released back in 1988 by Earache Records, this unofficial reissue comes in a limited number with a crazy clear yellow and red splattered vinyl. This definitely is one of the most influential grind records of all times.\n\nNot On Label\n\n13\n\nCARNIST\n\nUnlearn\n\nWhat happens when a group of close friends who are bonded by a deep friendship, a highly socially-aware anger and an interwoven web of strong progressive beliefs decide to play loud, angry, abrasive and blown out hardcore punk as a vessel for the expression of radical and extreme vegan, pro-animal rights, feminist, anti-patriarchy, anti-religion, anti-misogyny, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia and anti-speciesism ideals? Well, what happens is that in seconds you end up enveloped in a shit storm of rage that has seemingly no end, nor shows any kind of willingness to loosen it�s vicious, mauling attack on your sorry throat at any time, and that will stop in front of nothing in order to get its message across. And that�s what CARNIST�s music is all about. Being pissed to no end about a multitude of social matters, and therefore being pissed in an exponential kind of way, in a million different directions. End up in this album�s path and the only choice you have to stay alive is to embrace its message, otherwise get the fuck out of its way or the damn thing will flatten you like a worm under a steam roller. Carnist are a highly political hardcore band haling from London, who feature members of Shels, Plague Mass, Unquiet Grave, Momentum, Light Bearer and Fall of Efrafa. Their music is a hardcore attack that has neither mercy nor pity, and aims to rip through your fucking face with the force of a tomahawk launched straight at your head from four fucking feet away. It will get its message through any thick head, whether you want it or not, because to them, this shit is REAL, and you can feel that in every note and scream of the album. �Carnism� is the �invisible belief system, or ideology, that conditions people to eat animals�. On the other hand the title of their debut album, which is called Unlearn and that you can stream herein, deals with the concept of �unlearning societal norms and cultural traits which are contrary to our nature � be that our attitude towards non human animals or indeed humans who do not fall in line with stifling, archaic and claustrophobic ideas of what it is to be human.� Needless to say, the music just fucking overboils with anger and destruction, and the whole work is just and endless stuffing of blistering and mauling shards of pissed off socially aware hardcore belligerence that second after second pours out of the speakers with the force of a full blown fucking riot. Dropdead, Trial, Propagandhi, Infest, Siege, Void, Crass, Conflict,Protestant, Slapshot etc. are all influences � so you get the idea � and the album also features Guest Vocals by Matthew and Lee (Light bearer), Jasmine (Neocons/No Babies), Anna (Amber) Michele (Gottesmorder), Oskar and Erik (Monachus), etc.\n\nAlerta Antifascista\n\n12\n\nCASKETS OPEN\n\nBut You Rule\n\n\"But you rule\" the is one of those doom full-length's of the year! At least it is the freshest injection to the genre for a long time. Helsinkis CASKETS OPEN develop further the amazing demo and distill their own distinctive blend of cold, extremely violent but still subtle warm sound on this debut LP. Razorsharp edges in sound and morbid, social aware lyrics. A clicheless mix of drunken, anti-clerical and sleazy doom with a hint of post-punk, imagine JOY DIVISION fucking roughly with ST. VITUS in a dark night on a graveyard. LP comes with a superb gatefold on 350gr and a poster; 658 copies in all!\n\nStreaks\n\n10\n\nCATHARSIS\n\nSplit LP's\n\nCatharsis was an influential American hardcore punk band from Chapel Hill, North Carolina that was active from 1994 to 2002. Catharsis were known for writing extremely lengthy songs (sometimes broken into multiple parts) with complex title names and unusual time signatures. They were related to anarchist collective CrimethInc.. This anthology consists of the 2 split lp�s from 1998 and 2001 (respectively with Gehenna and Newborn) put together on a single record. Fans of Integrity, Neurosis, His Hero Is Gone, Amebix, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, GISM and Refused will love this reissue.\n\nFan Club\n\n11\n\nCATHETER / F.U.B.A.R.\n\nSplit\n\nDouble old school grindcore assault from Denver and Holland. For those who still think grindcore comes straight from hardcore punk and not from death metal!\n\nCivilisation\n\n11\n\nCATHETER\n\nSouthwest Doom Violence\n\nBACK IN STOCK!! After years of angst-ridden anticipation from a ravenous fanbase, Denver's grindcore gargantuans CATHETER unleash their first full-length album since 2005, celebrating 15 years of perpetuating their brutal 303-style grind. The follow-up to their 2005-released sophomore album, \"Dimension 303\", amidst an incredible arsenal of split releases, EPs and demos over the years, CATHETER's new opus is so obliteratingly heavy that upon first listen you'll quickly forgive them for the delay since the last album, and immediately tear your own head off in utter joy.\n\nDropout\n\n11\n\nCATHOLIC GUILT / INU\n\nSplit\n\nSplit 12? from these two European bands. Inu are from Spain and play burly, Japanese-style burning spirits guitar with a distinctly Spanish flavor. The riffs are big and meaty like Death Side and there are some Maiden-esque leads, but the unique lilt of the Spanish language means it can�t help bud recall old Spanish stuff as well. As for Catholic Guilt, they�re from Austria and play dense, discordant hardcore in the Die Kreuzen tradition. With the Die Kreuzen-esque riffs and chorus-ed guitar this really does sound quite a lot like Sickoids, perhaps mixed with some Polish hardcore like Dezerter. A band well-worth checking out! This is also housed in a really swank-looking 2-color silk-screened jacket.\n\nSymphony Of Destruction\n\n11\n\nCATHOLIC SPIT\n\nA Pact With The Devil\n\nDebut 12\" from this California punk / death rock band. I almost hesitate to hit them with the \"death rock\" tag because so many bands are doing that style with such a range of different approaches and competency levels, but it's somewhat appropriate even if Catholic Spit are way more punk than most bands in this vein. There's the omni-present chorus pedal and lady vox, of course, but these songs are almost all played at nearly-hardcore tempos and pack way more of a wallop than just about anyone else I can think of in this style. If your idea of goth leans more toward peak-period Damned and TSOL, check this LP out... it's a ripper.\n\nCrapoulet\n\n11\n\nCHAIN REACTION\n\nRottura Totale\n\nFinally reissued, \"Gabbie\" 7\" was one of the greatest records of italian 80's hardcore, furious as fuck and with some of the most pissed off vocals ever, here comes again together with new tunes recorded in 2010\n\nGonna Puke\n\n10\n\nCHANNEL 3\n\nS/T\n\nFor an Orange County band that released its records on the legendary U.K. punk label No Future (Posh Boy in the U.S.), it's a shame that it isn't as fondly remembered as O.C. peers like Social Distortion, the Adolescents, and Agent Orange. In Mike Magrann, Channel 3 had an extremely talented songwriter, capable of making punk sound and feel as emotional as it was supposed to be. With his partner in crime Kim Gardner on second guitar and backing vocals, Channel 3 churned out some of the most exciting punk records imaginable, taking power and fury and adding melody and subtle flair. Imagine Agent Orange with a few extra chords borrowed from the Monkees. This compilation is a reissue of 3 of their EP�s plus a track taken from a compilation CD. Mandatory!\n\nRadiation\n\n11\n\nCHAOS UK\n\nS/T\n\nOfficial repress of this U.K. punk hardcore classic. Together with their fellows Disorder, here is where all the ultra distorted raw noise punk comes from.\n\nPapagajuv Hlasatel\n\n12\n\nCHAOS UK\n\nThe Chipping Sodbury Bonfire Tapes\n\n1989 album officially re-released\n\nRadiation\n\n11\n\nCHOOSE YOUR POISON\n\nCrawl To Nothing\n\nBrutal slow doom blasts lead into head pounding thrashcore. Picking up speed to blast into a high energy thrash/crossover hardcore. This combines a few crucial elements from doom, hardcore, and tharshcore. Bang your head, smoke your weed, and worship nothing. These folks are shredding basements, venues, and the rest of the world with a hard crushing blend of music.\n\nActive Rebellion\n\n6\n\nCHURCH OF MISERY\n\nVolume 1\n\nOriginally recorded in 1996 but without getting an official vinyl release till 2007 on Japan’s now extinct Leaf Hound Records, it is finally getting a legitimate vinyl release 15 years later on Emetic Records.\n\nEmetic\n\n18\n\nCITIZENS PATROL\n\nS/T\n\nFinest Dutch HC Thrash Punk combo! This record is impossible to dislike. If you�re into old school HC, you'll love it, if you�re not, you�ll get into it!\n\nWay Back When\n\n10\n\nCLUSTER BOMB UNIT\n\nDie Stationen von Cluster Bomb Unit\n\nHOLY FUCKING SHIT this blasted my nuts off!!! 20 Extreme thrash/ D-beat/crust tunes !!!! There's certainly that \"crust\" touch to this band, what with their leanings towards a driving tempo extremely reminiscent of \"Victim Of A Bomb Raid\" era ANTI-CIMEX and just a touch of a more serious side of SORE THROAT and faster/thrashier EXTREME NOISE TERRORisms...now you know something, another high quality crust /d-beat release.\n\nPower It Up\n\n11\n\nCOCK SPARRER\n\nGuilty as charged\n\nRemixed and remastered to bring out the energy in this perhaps under-appreciated release, the new \"Guilty As Charged\" LP allows the music to shine as it should. Amidst all the craziness in the punk rock world in 1994, this was Cock Sparrer's answer... a tip of the hat and two fingers in the air letting everyone know that what all the kids were suddenly making money selling, they'd been doing for over twenty years... because they loved it. They weren't going to stop having fun and doing things their way, as can be witnessed all over this record. Limited edition of 400 copies.\n\nCaptain Oi!\n\n13\n\nCOCK SPARRER\n\nRunning Riot In '84\n\nOriginally released by Syndicate Records in 1984 and reissued in a different sleeve four years later by Link Records, this was the second studio album by the mighty Sparrer. Whilst not as immediate as �Shock Troops� it has some great tunes � �The Sun Says� and �Price Too High To Pay� for example. 180 grams vinyl.\n\nCaptain Oi!\n\n12\n\nCOFFIN TEXTS\n\nTomb Of Infinite Ritual\n\nTomb of Infinite Ritual', the 2nd album by this legendary trio from Los Angeles, California. Founded by Roberto Cradenas and Richard Gonzales back in 1995 after the break-up of cult gore grind band ENTITY. Coffin Texts has been roaming the California Death Metal underground since their initiation. Sharing members with cult bands such as SADISTIC INTENT, POSSESSED, INFAMY, ENTITY and other bands in which the members are active. Roberto Cardenas is also playing in the great renowned power-metal band AGENT STEEL. Developing their own unique style and sound they released their debut CD in 2000, titled 'Gods of Creation, Death & Afterlife' which was released in US/Canada, South America and Europe on CD and vinyl format. Celebrated in the underground, this is a well hidden gem and high-class, true Death Metal with its roots in the ancient Californian Death Metal style. After several studio mishaps and hard-drive crashes, the band just recently managed to finalize the mixing process. 'Tomb of Infinite Ritual' shows COFFIN TEXTS at their very best. While the musicians themselves have developed and perfected their skills, the same spirit and approach to Death Metal remains true and intact!\n\nBlood Harvest\n\n12\n\nCOFFINS / XXX MANIAK\n\nSplit\n\nUsual Autopsy/Celtic Frost on Xanax holocaust from Japan vs US grindgore with members of Rumpeltstiltskin Grinder\n\nHaunted Hotel\n\n9\n\nCOFFINS\n\nSewage Sludgecore Treatment\n\n100% cover songs, from Sludge to the core!!!

For those of you not familiar with Coldbringer, they feature members of From Ashes Rise, Hellshock, Call The Police, the Del Toros, and Talk Is Poison. They play a style of melodic hardcore that draws from influences like Naked Raygun, Leatherface, Husker Du and the Wipers, but is all their own at the same time.\"\n\nSabotage\n\n4\n\nCOLONNA INFAME\n\nDalla Nostra Parte\n\nHeroes of oi!-core propaganda since 1996, from Rome.

This band's innocent looking demo kicked Six Weeks' fucking ass for the last three months, but this new material is hands down one of the meanest, nastiest thrash records to come from Japan in a while. Originally destined to be released by Slap-A-Ham Records (now defunct), Six Weeks has been hand picked to be the only label on the planet worthy of releasing this monster hardcore disc. Along with the god-like chaotic noise of this band (members include a cadre of secret Japanese scenesters) you get full color Japanese anime-styled artwork and a 12 page booklet that totally amazes the eye. If out-of-controlJapanese thrash is your game, start the pit with this crazed mayhem!!!\n\nSix Weeks\n\n10\n\nCONTRASTO\n\nStatico Senso\n\n110% fast hc 20 track to of stop and go! one of the best italian political hc band!\n\nAgipunk\n\n7\n\nCONTRASTO / NAGASAKI NIGHTMARE\n\nSplit\n\nItalian political fastcore masters vs bari neo-crust, italy back on the map!\n\nmany labels\n\n5\n\nCONTRASTO\n\nTornare Ai Resti\n\nNew full-lenght for those italian political hardcorers.

Contravene is a band from Phoenix, AZ that formed in the fall of 1999. They were an anarcho/peacepunk band with metal influences and political lyrics. They shared strong beliefs about equality, animal rights and (still are) strongly anti-racist/anti-homophobic.\n\nTribal War\n\n10\n\nCORROSIONE/ CATTIVERIA\n\nSplit\n\nOne of the first Agipunk releases. Corrosione are a killer old school vs Cattiveria grind and crust\n\nboth political\n\nAgipunk\n\n6\n\nCOUNCIL OF RATS\n\nIll Weathers\n\nCouncil Of Rats is a four piece band from Milan, Italy who formed in April of 2012. Council Of Rats features members of Seesaw and La Crisi. Council Of Rats play a scathing, unhinged, and venomous style of hardcore. Council Of Rats can loosely be compared to bands such as Glasses, Jungbluth, No Statik, and Punch. After releasing a stellar six song EP in April of 2013, Council Of Rats have returned with their debut ten song LP. Ill Weathers features ten songs of blistering no-frills hardcore that is impressive as hell. Seriously, Ill Weathers is completely off the hook and will definitely scratch your hardcore itch. Ill Weathers was released via Adagio 830 records on June 2nd, 2014. As always this label does not disappoint. Highly recommended! Enjoy!\n\nAdagio 830\n\n11\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO ARMAGEDDON\n\nEater Of Worlds\n\nFive years since their s/t 7” on Aborted Society, COUNTDOWN TO ARMAGEDDON return with their first full-length release, Eater of Worlds. Based in Seattle, WA, CTA took a long hiatus following West Coast and US tours, and returned in 2008 to write new material. Dark, atmospheric crust with heavy post-punk/darkwave undertones, this is an 8-song 45RPM 12” vinyl release with a free download card for MP3 versions. Influences on Eater of Worlds range from TOTALITÄR to KILLING JOKE, while remaining unique and cohesive. Members of current and former projects such as: MEISCE, BOOK OF BLACK EARTH, CITY OF DUST, PHALANX, CLUSTERFUX, THE FACET. Recorded by Stan Wright at Buzz or Howl Studios in Portland, OR. 500 copies on red vinyl.\n\nAborted Society\n\n10\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO ARMAGEDDON\n\nThrough The Wires\n\nThis is the second full-length release from COUNTDOWN TO ARMAGEDDON, a 3-piece based in Seattle, WA whose sound originated in apocalyptic crust and inevitably progressed into more melodic, post-punk territories over the past eight years of their tenure. Thick layers of reverb and chorus-effected darkwave riffs, sometimes reminiscent of early KILLING JOKE or CHRISTIAN DEATH, weave in and out of the lines between punk, hardcore, and d-beat crust, while retaining a unique identity in each of the eight tracks on the album.\n\nSkuld\n\n10\n\nCOUNTERBLAST\n\nNothingness\n\n2xLP! FInally a new full length by this swedish slow dark crust heroes! Monumental crust from Sweden with a very unique style that blends elements of crust, metal and somewhat ambient, eerie and tribal sounding music together. You can hear some influences from other bands such as Amebix, Dystopia and Neurosis in parts, but Counterblast's is something truly unique that must be experienced to understand how amazing this is.\n\nAlerta Antifascista\n\n16\n\nCRASH BOX\n\nNel Cuore\n\nTheir 1984 7” EP is a classic, after a first metal-oriented LP this is the band’s final epitaph back to the hardcore roots of the early days, 100% hardcore! Some of their best songs ever here. Released in 1989.

The \"Monuments\" LP, their side of the split 10\" with Doom + the \"From Violence To Consumerism\" 7\" + 20 something minutes of unreleased songs! - - Soundwise you have to take the infamous old-school anarcho-punk 1-2-1-2 drum tempo and chanted hard-hitting slogans and fuse it to the modern D.I.Y. punk sound (metal Èinnit?) and you have Cress - Slow, heavy and menacing mayhem riding along the lines of ANTISECT, FLUX OF PINK INDIANS with a punch of KILLING JOKE, dark tripped-out sound effects and keyboard, loads of anger aimed at the desecrators of our earth. Punk! Lyrics that are trully heartfelt and well thought out, straightforward and sincere, I can feel the compassion and conviction of the punk community when I hear these songs. This is the kind of stuff that keeps me going! Comes with poster and lyric booklet with lots of graphics!!\n\nSkuld\n\n15\n\nCROSS LAWS\n\nNothing Is Waiting For You When You Die\n\nNorth Carolina's Cross Laws are back with farewell release of ferocious hardcore. Yeah, they're fast and mean as fuck, but the riffs are complex and melodic, bringing to mind Totalitar, Poison Idea and occasionally even Articles of Faith.

The Lp contains their \"Can´t Sleep\" Demo, the tour CD, Behind The Curve EP, Ancient Rites EP and 3 unreleased trax! 24 trax in total!!\n\nAbuse\n\n4\n\nCROSS LAWS\n\nNothing Is Waiting For You When You Die\n\nLimited edition on colored vinyl and different cover, 200 copies.

Cross Stitched Eyes deep and abstract sounds are works of pummeling sonics. Following in the tradition of anarchist punk and death rock (Rudimentary Peni, Cortex, and Killing Joke), the album's noises embrace the many irrational and visceral shades of music's darkest corners. Decomposition decidedly rejects traditional copy-and-paste guidelines of musical conformity with a puncturing attitude. The harsher side of CSE's musical work relates to underground art forms because of its close association of the band's artistic influences and it's deconstructed presentation as a whole. Decomposition's leadoff track \"We Follow\" evokes reactions to seemingly (un)changing lifestyles and vitriolic diatribes. Other songs like \"Animated Corpse\" and \"Scars Of Past\" contain a lyrical depth seldom heard these days. At times benign, at others aggressive, Cross Stitched Eyes demonstrate the complicated relationship between dark and light that artists continue to examine. Repeated spins of Decomposition are unavoidable. Cross Stitched Eyes features members of Zygote, Alaric, U.K.Subs, Smart Pills, Anger Of Bacteria and Endrophobia. Don't judge them by their other activities because they all bring a special component to this multi-national collective. Tim Shapland has produced all of band's recordings with a technique that captures the urgency of their sound. Jason Willer drives the beat and his vocals shape the songs, leading with the direction of an intuitive scavenger on the hunt. Steve Daniel anchors the low-end rhythmic components with an industrious attitude that is uniquely his own. Together as Cross Stitched Eyes, they have created an infectious LP that will capture and enrapture.\n\nSkuld\n\n10\n\nCROWSKIN\n\nBlack Lava\n\nAfter various split releases ( with BLACK SHAPE OF NEXUS and BLACK FREIGHTER ) and compilation appearances, CROWSKIN come up with their first full length album, once again exploring the depths of slow, heavy and brutal sludge doom. The record delivers four lenghthy tracks that pend from super-sick slo-mo brutality to bulldozer grooves, from vast melancholic elegies to weird noise freak outs and even some thrash outbursts displaying the hardcore background of these doom punkers. Enjoy the feeling of being buried by a slow flooding, yet unstoppable lava of thick, black sound!\n\nVendetta\n\n10\n\nCRUCIFIED MORTALS\n\nS/T\n\nGet ready to be hit in the face with an iron fist of thrash metal insanity... after ten years of several EP and demo outputs, CRUCIFIED MORTALS release their first full-length album. Comprised of eleven horror tales transcribed into metallic hymns the album continues the bands' own appalling sound with arguably their best material to date. A truly unique style of well-played and evil fucking thrash with hints of death metal that showcases a diverse range sure to satisfy the ear's craving for speed, heavy and memorable riffing complimented with harsh angry vocals and pounding drums. Hammer the nails & thrash 'til fucking death! RECOMMENDED FOR DIE HARDS OF: Hobbs' Angel Of Death, Rigor Mortis (Texas), Deceased & Carnivore.\n\nHells Headbangers\n\n12\n\nCRUCIFIX\n\nDehumanization\n\nReissue of the classic 1984 masterpiece by one of the best U.S. hc acts of all times. Crucifix combines the political spirit of crass & conflict with the Discharge school of music. along with Discharge - 'hear nothing', Antisect's - 'in darkness' and Amebix - 'monolith' this is one of the most important anarchopunk releases of the 1980s. \"prejudice\", \"no limbs\" and \"see through their lies\" are highlights. Sothira's vocals are very powerful & unique for this style.\n\nFan Club\n\n11\n\nCRUDE\n\n1999\n\n''1999'' is just as good as the 2000 ''attitude'' LP, some say even better... Expect hardcore punk the Japanese way, ''burning spirits'' style rocking energy, a hell of a lot of beautiful guitar work, and a powerful, sturby rhythm section filled with neat melodic bass lines....masterpiece!!! The records have been repressed (thankfully!) by the kind mr. Yannick of FERAL WARD recs. Be inspired by the powerhouse called CRUDE!\n\nFeral Ward\n\n12\n\nCRUDE B.E./RADIO SCHIZO\n\nSplit\n\nCrude B.E. are tornado grind from potsdam/vs german punk!\n\nMerciless\n\n4\n\nCRUDE SS\n\nKilling For Nothing\n\nVinyl compilation of rare and previously unreleased tracks (taken from EP's, comps and demo's) by these influential Swedish '80s HC-legends.\n\nDistortion\n\n12\n\nCRUTCHES\n\nLurad\n\nPolitical D-Beat punk at it's finest, courtesy of Sweden's CRUTCHES. They just released an LP that will have you putting on your cone-studded vest and starting a pit in your bedroom. Total crust anarchy. For fans of Discharge, GBH etc etc...\n\nPhobia\n\n11\n\nCULO\n\nLife Is Vile� And So Are We\n\nPure fuggin� godhead hardcore punk rock! No metal, no pop, just straight-up hardcore punk. Four anthems of checking out of society and not giving a fuck who cares. This stuff sounds legit and not some part time pose. Fast, pissed, and catchier than hell.\n\nDeranged\n\n13\n\nCULO\n\nMy Life Sucks And I Could Care Less\n\nThe first proper LP from Chicago, IL's Culo after plenty of EPs is a non-stop rager of blazing hardcore punk whose faster, harder moments are reminiscent of Out Cold and Poison Idea while they have tossed in more melodic jams. LP includes digital download.\n\nDeranged\n\n13\n\nCURSED\n\nThe Rest\n\nUnofficial reissue of the band�s first 3 ep�s + the Demo. Monumental and granitic as usual!\n\nFan Club\n\n11\n\nCURSED\n\nTwo\n\nSecond album for the mighty Canadian hardcore punks. This record seemed a fid for the proggy metalcore crowd (word to Mastodons of all sizes), while the first seemed like stripped-down Converge, which kinda defeats the point of Converge, but whatever-metalcore could use a little less Zappa and everyone knows it. No wonder it�s their strongest album.\n\nFan Club\n\n11\n\nCWILL\n\nTrotz Allem\n\nSwiss dark and heavy hardcore crust with violin which is not just a copy of Remains of the Day or From Ashes Rise\n\nSkuld\n\n10\n\nCYNESS\n\nLoony Planet / Industreality\n\nThe Germans are so damn efficient at everything they do Cyness conveniently included the words �grindcore� underneath their logo to avoid any confusion on debut long player Looney Planet/Industreality, a 20 minute tutorial in lock tight Napalm Death with a drafting degree grind. And like that band, Cyness set these 22 songs to tape during two sessions between 2001 and 2003 with all the requisite line up instability.\n\nInstitut Fur Mental Hygiene\n\n11\n\nCZOSNEK\n\nSometimes\n\nTime passes... That's 4th album by garlic (= czosnek) crew. First one with a female singer. Raging mix of punk and hard core without falling into one genre.\n\nNikt Nic Nie Wie\n\n5\n\nD.D.I./STALKER\n\nSplit\n\nDDI last recording vs a power violence legend from germany!\n\nThough Crime\n\n7\n\nD.I.S.\n\nCritical Failure\n\nA crushing powerhouse of Swedish influenced D-Beat mixed with ripping metal and thrash, backed by traditionally aggressive punk vocals. This is D.I.S. Bringing together a combined total of over 75 years experience and dedication to the underground through various bands, DIS is an unstoppable bulldozer of heaviness and ferocity.\n\nPower It Up\n\n10\n\nD.S. 13\n\nKilled By The Kids\n\nClassic swedish hc reissue, unmissable\n\nHavoc\n\n10\n\nDAG NASTY\n\nWig Out At Denkos\n\nWashington, DC based punk rock band originally affiliated with Dischord Records and featuring ex. members of Minor Threat & Bloody Mannequin Orchestra. This is an official repress of their second record originally released in 1987. Innovative, melodic but still powerful U.S. hardcore punk!\n\nDischord\n\n14\n\nDAYGLO ABORTIONS\n\nOut Of The Womb\n\nBack in print due to popular demand and it's extreme rarity, this early 80's punk classic is now being re-issued.

Even though the music takes a first step into metal territories, the formula is still powerful, fast, pissed and�great! This absolutely is a must have for every Dayglo fan!\n\nUnrest\n\n11\n\nDAYGLO ABORTIONS\n\nLittle Man In The Canoe\n\nThis Dayglo album was a bit of a return to form for the band. It sounds more like something between the Feed Us a Fetus and Here Today� . They ditched a lot of the adolescent metal baggage that plagued them on the album before this and it turned out to work for them as it�s a pretty solid album overall. Of all the �newer� Dayglow Abortions albums, this is easily the one you want to own\n\nUnrest\n\n11\n\nDAYGLO ABORTIONS\n\nCorporate Whores\n\nCorporate Whores has more of a feel of the '80s Day Glo Abortions than the more updated products. For somebody looking to discover some classic-sounding material from the group, this is a good place to look! In this absolutely �necessary� reissue, you will see how the metal riffs and the outlandish humor keep things consistent on this entertaining metalcore opus from the Candian court jesters of the genre.\n\nUnrest\n\n11\n\nDAYGLO ABORTIONS\n\nHoly Shiite!!\n\nLast record by this old Canadian punk/metal heroes\n\nUnrest\n\n11\n\nDEAD\n\nFor Lovers Of The New Bizarre\n\nThe very inofficial “Dead” debut album released in 1994 by Poserslaughter rec as a split cd with Regurgitate now coming back to life for the first time on exclusive 12” vinyl!!!! be sleazy or be dead!!!!

DEATHLESS BASTARDS released a demo in 2012 which kind of passed under my radar but I heard good things from those who picked it up. 3 brand new tracks here from them and this is their first vinyl release. Dark, brooding and downright dirty Dis-Motor-Punk that'll make you go \"URGHH!\" Great and suitably grim artwork by Halsey Swain tops off the sweet packaging on this 12\" that contains an OBI strip and large poster.\n\nSymphony Of Destruction\n\n11\n\nDEATHRAID\n\nAll Life Ends\n\nSecond full-lenght out for their european tour, hailing from Seattle they feature ex-Disrupt, State of Fear and Consume members.

These yougsters deliver some amazing Death Metal. Imagine a mix of GROTESQUE with a hint of AUTOPSY.\n\nBlood Harvest\n\n12\n\nDEFECATION\n\nPurity Diluition\n\nInspired by their desire to conquer the underground, Mitch and Mick wrote and recorded an entire album worth of material within a two-week period. The result was raw and in your face! It was released on Nuclear Blast Records in 1989. \"Purity Dilution\" was one of the early successes for the company and soon became a milestone classic album, gaining cult status. Defecation became a major influence in the explosion of the grindcore underground scene.

The \"filth/grace\" LP represent the earliest incarnation of DEPRESSOR, originally available as two home-dubbed cassettes- \"filth\" and \"grace\" (1995 and 1997, respectively)- available only in underground tape-trading circuits.

Available in 500 copies only!!\n\nFuck Yoga\n\n14\n\nDERIDE\n\nS/T\n\nThrashy Japanese hardcore with a lightfooted speed and rousing grit rarely found among their stateside brethren. For fans of whirlwind Japanese rock like OAC, GISM, Assfort…\n\nMad at the World\n\n4\n\nDERROTA\n\nAsko Infinito\n\nNew LP of these tireless punks, which in a way summarizes and condenses the 5 years of existance and its evolution as a band. With a crust influenced punk-rock base, they mix elements from death-rock or post-punk making the whole sound very solid, original and outstanding. Political nihilism and social rancour on their lyrics, filthily beautiful artwork. Alltoghether, a fine work of modern punk.Inlcudes a 20 pages booklet-fanzine with translations into english, french, and german and a Larsen cover.\n\nTrabuc\n\n4\n\nDESASTRE\n\nPesadelo Real\n\nApocalyptic D-Beat from Brazil!!\n\nUndislessed\n\n4\n\nDESCENT TO HELL\n\nOur Cross To Bear\n\nDescent to hell feature members of Fleas and Lice and Makiladoras.
