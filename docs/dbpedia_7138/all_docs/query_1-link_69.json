        "text": "Shirt Killer is an independently owned and operated online retailer that manages online stores for our roster of bands and artists. All of the garments and related merchandise available on the site are under exclusive license from the bands/artists to Shirt Killer.\n\nIn simpler terms, Shirt Killer runs and manages the official online stores for the bands on our roster and also sells select exclusive designs from bands who may have their main online stores elsewhere. You are directly supporting the bands by buying from Shirt Killer. We do not sell any bootleg products, all of the artists on Shirt Killer's roster receive royalties for each shirt sold.\n\nShirt Killer is based in Louisville, Kentucky, and is owned and operated by artist and musician Ryan Patterson. Patterson makes music as Fotocrime, is the creator of Cat Magic Punks, and was known for his role as the founding member of the band Coliseum. He has designed countless record covers and shirts for bands across the globe, including many on the Shirt Killer roster. Through Patterson’s experiences touring and creating imagery for bands and labels, he was fortunate enough to earn the friendship and trust of many great musicians and others involved in the worldwide punk/hardcore/indie community. These relationships led to Shirt Killer’s initial roster of bands: Baroness, Coliseum, Kylesa, Torche, and Young Widows. From there, the roster continued to grow and expands to this day, ranging from newer, up-and-comers to legendary, genre-defining artists.\n\nShirt Killer warehouses and ships from both United States coasts and Eastern Europe, thus ensuring fast and affordable shipping worldwide."
