        "text": "Nasum (pronounced 'nay-sum') was a Swedish grindcore band from Örebro formed in 1992. The band released four studio albums, developed into \"one of that country's premier metal acts\"[1] and disbanded after the December 2004 tsunami killed the band's frontman, Mieszko Talarczyk. The band took their name from the film Flesh for Frankenstein, in which Baron Frankenstein (played by Udo Kier) is searching for the perfect Serbian nasum to create a new master race (you can hear the right pronunciation [Naz-um] at the beginning of the song “Blind World”, as they used an excerpt of that film for the intro).\n\nIn 2012, Nasum reunited with Rotten Sound frontman Keijo Niinimaa taking the place of Talarczyk, for a one-off tour to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary.\n\nBiography[]\n\nNasum was formed in 1992 by Anders Jakobson (guitar) and Rickard Alriksson (drums/vocals), two former members of the band Necrony. The record label of Necrony offered Nasum a slot on a split 7\". After Mieszko Talarczyk joined the band as a guitarist in 1993, the band was featured on Blind World split EP with Agathocles. After several more splits, Nasum released an MCD (mini compact disc) of their own with Poserslaughter Records in 1995.[1]\n\nAs the band started touring, Alriksson departed from Nasum. Guitarist Jakobson moved into the drummer's position and Talarczyk handled guitars and vocals. More EPs and splits followed over 1996 and 1997; and in 1998 Nasum released their first full-length album, Inhale/Exhale, on Relapse Records. As the band expanded their audience and touring, they recruited a full-time bassist, Jesper Liveröd (from Burst) in early 1999. The second album, Human 2.0, was released in April 2000 and followed by two years of touring and performing in support of the work, including a stop in Japan.[1]\n\nThe third album, Helvete, was released in 2003, featured Napalm Death's Shane Embury, was well received, and led to even more high-profile appearances, especially on the European festival circuit.[1][2] At that time, Nasum were joined by second guitarist Urban Skytt and bassist Jon Lindqvist, who replaced the departing member Liveröd. In 2004, Nasum released Shift and continued with touring.[1]\n\nTalarczyk went on vacation to Thailand shortly before the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. His death was officially confirmed on February 17, 2005, and Nasum disbanded. A compilation, Grind Finale was released in 2006 and a live album featuring a 2004 show from Osaka, entitled Doombringer, was released in early 2008.[1]\n\nIn October 2011, Nasum announced a special one-off tour to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary the following year. Filling in for late singer Talarczyk was Rotten Sound frontman Keijo Niinimaa.[3]\n\nMembers[]\n\nAnders Jakobson – guitars (1992–1995), drums (1995–2005, 2011–2012)\n\nRickard Alriksson – drums, vocals (1992–1995)\n\nMieszko Talarczyk – guitars (1993–2004), vocals (1995–2004)\n\nJesper Liveröd – bass (1999–2003, 2011–2012)\n\nJon Lindqvist – bass (2003–2005), guitars (2011–2012)\n\nUrban Skytt – guitars (2003–2005, 2011–2012)\n\nTouring musicians\n\nPer Karlsson – drums (1995)\n\nKeijo Niinimaa – vocals (2011–2012)\n\nDiscography[]\n\nStudio albums[]\n\nInhale/Exhale (1998)\n\nHuman 2.0 (2000)\n\nHelvete (2003)\n\nShift (2004)\n\nCompilation[]\n\nGrind Finale (2006)\n\nLive album[]\n\nDoombringer (2008)\n\nEPs[]\n\nBlind World – split w/ Agathocles (7\", 1993)\n\nGrindwork – split w/ Retaliation, Clotted Symmetric Sexual Organ and Vivisection (3\" CD, 1994)\n\nIndustrislaven (12\", 1995)\n\nSmile When You're Dead – split w/ Psycho (7\", 1996)\n\nWorld in Turmoil (7\", 1997)\n\nThe Black Illusions – split w/ Abstain (7\", 1998)\n\nUntitled bonus 7\" EP that came with the Inhale/Exhale LP (7\", 1998)\n\nThe Nasum/Warhate Campaign – split w/ Warhate (7\", 1999)\n\nSplit w/ Asterisk (7\", Busted Heads Records, 2000)\n\nSplit w/ Skitsystem (7\", 2002)\n\nDemo[]\n\nDomedagen (1994)\n\nCompilation appearances[]\n\nReally Fast Vol. 9 (1993)\n\nRegressive Hostility (1997)\n\nIn Defence of Our Future – A Tribute to Discharge (song \"Visions of War\") (1997)\n\nThe Bloodbath Is Coming 2x7\" (song \"The Bloodbath Is Coming\") (1999)\n\nRequiems of Revulsion: A Tribute to Carcass (song \"Tools of the Trade\") (2000)\n\nPolar Grinder (2001)\n\nGrind Your Mind – A History Of Grindcore (2008)\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website\n\nFacebook\n\nMyspace\n\nBandcamp"
