        "text": "For the longest time, I thought I hated power metal. Then in 2006, I discovered Twisted Tower Dire’s Crest of the Martyrs. At the time I was living in Simi Valley, CA and on a day off from interning for Metal Blade Records, I stumbled across a used CD/DVD shop who’s name escapes me. Their metal selection wasn’t the greatest, but I did manage to find a few gems and among them was Crest of the Martyrs. I knew absolutely nothing about Twisted Tower Dire at the time, but if memory serves I decided to grab the album because they had a cool sounding name and crazy-ass cover art. Every once in a while ya gotta roll the dice on a blind buy and boy oh boy did this one pay off.\n\nI remember popping the album into my CD player not having a clue what to expect and was totally blown away by what I heard. Yes it was power metal without a doubt, but it was completely free of all the cheesiness that made me dislike the genre. Indeed, Twisted Tower Dire had more in common with the trad metal stylings of Maiden and Priest, as opposed to the frilly shirt-wearing, rainbows and unicorns nonsense that Euro power metal bands like Rhapsody were peddling. Sure, the sound of Crest of the Martyrs was polished, but there was a grittiness to tracks like “At Night” “Infinitum” and “Transfixed” that set the band apart from anything else I’d ever heard from the genre. It was as if Twisted Tower Dire were making power metal for people who didn’t like power metal, and in the eyes of this power metal hater they more than succeeded.\n\nAs I listened through the album I knew that I liked it, but when I got to track number eight, “By My Hand” is when like turned to love. To this day it remains a perfect power metal song; heavy and catchy with incredible vocal performance from the dearly departed Tony Taylor. Goddamn, did that guy have a voice or what? As amazing as the riffs are on “By My Hand,” and throughout Crest of the Martyrs, for that matter, it is Taylor’s performance that ultimately makes the album an instant classic. His voice soars across the sonic landscape like a screaming eagle, driving those choruses deep into skull and leaving them there for days at a time, or in the case of “By My Hand” for me, for the past sixteen years.\n\nProduced, mixed and mastered by Iron Savior guitarist/vocalist Piet Sielk who had previously worked with power metal royalty such as Blind Guardian and Gamma Ray, Crest of the Martyrs sounds absolutely massive. Twisted Tower Dire’s songwriting acumen on the album is already second to none, but the production scheme elevates their work to an even higher level, if such a thing is possible. The term “epic” is among the most overused descriptors in metal, but I honestly can’t think of a better word to describe the sound of Crest of the Martyrs thanks to Sielk’s masterful work.\n\nI don’t listen to anywhere near enough power metal to say whether or not Crest of the Martyrs is a genre-defining album, bet it’s certainly a defining album for me. Over a decade and a half after I discovered it by way of sheer blind luck, it remains my go-to when I’m in the rare mood for power metal, and serves as a wonderful reminder that every style of metal has something to offer if you’re willing to open yourself up to it.\n\nFor those who wish to dig even further into Crest of the Martyrs, Nameless Grave Records recently unearthed the demo tracks for the album, which you can listen to and purchase in various formats via Bandcamp.\n\nRead other entries in THKD’s Top 100 Metal Albums.\n\nOver the course of an EP, a split and debut full length Feathers Fall to Flames, Phoenix, AZ’s Savage Necromancy have blazed a path of bestial black/death metal devastation that shows no signs of letting up or slowing down. The band recently re-released Feathers Fall to Flames via the venerable 20 Buck Spin and after just a few years of existence are already poised to take the metal scene at large by storm with their knack for crafting songs that are catchy and memorable without forsaking any of the crushing ultraviolence the genre is known for. In honor of the re-release, I caught up with guitarist/songwriter Conjurer of Putrid Desecrations via email to discuss Savage Necromancy’s plans for world domination.\n\nTHKD: For readers that might not be familiar, tell us about the formation of Savage Necromancy. How did the band come to be and what goals did you have in mind when starting out?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: The Grand Marshall of Hell and myself started this band just with the intention of making heavy straight-forward war metal songs. We had absolutely no goals besides working on being tight before playing shows and to put out a demo.\n\nTHKD: You released your debut album Feathers Fall to Flames last year. What was your mindset going into the writing and recording of the album and what did you hope to accomplish?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: My mindset in writing was to create very intense and razor-sharp black metal and to solidify us as a more serious band than what was previously shown on our demo and split. It was intentional to start adding more variation to our black metal with SE Asian/Brazil and black/thrash influences.\n\nTHKD: What is the songwriting process like for Savage Necromancy? Is there a single primary writer or do you work on the songs as a band?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: For the most part I write all the songs (the intro track was written by Grand Marshall of Hell). When I am satisfied with a song being complete we practice it. Lyrics don’t really come into play until we record. I would say I write the majority of the lyrics on the new album and GMOH arranges and structures the vocal patterns. Lately for our other band we have been writing and demoing the songs on a DAW before practicing them as a band so we might do the same for the remainder of the full-length tracks.\n\nTHKD: One thing that immediately impressed me about Feathers Fall to Flames is that it is violent and brutal but still manages to be very catchy and riff-driven. Was this intentional or just a natural evolution of the band’s approach to songwriting?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: It’s intentional. We want to be razor-sharp and have strong memorable songs including more influence from other styles of bestial black metal. I see a few comments saying this is not war metal because we are not chaotic enough and that’s fine, this is our evolution of where we want our black metal to go.\n\nTHKD: Feathers Fall to Flames is being reissued by 20 Buck Spin. How did you come in contact with the label? Will you be releasing any other material through them?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: Yes, we were currently writing the next full-length for 20 Buck Spin! I believe what happened was Nate from Spirit Adrift told Dave [Adelson, owner of 20 Buck Spin] about us and Dave was interested, and Rippy (our friend who recorded this album) relayed the message to us. We contacted Dave and it was a very smooth process and we are extremely happy to be on the label.\n\nTHKD: You released your debut ep in 2019, followed by the split with Genocidal Sodomy in 2020 and Feathers Fall to Flames in 2021. Are you currently working on any new material and if so when can fans expect to hear it?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: Yes as mentioned before writing another full-length for 20 Buck Spin, we are maybe 2-3 songs deep into it so far. I imagine this will take a while so hopefully by Fall/Winter of next year.\n\nTHKD: What does the rest of 2022 have in store for Savage Necromancy? Are there any live shows/tours in the works to support the reissue of Feathers Fall to Flames?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: As of writing this I can’t give exact details yet, but yes there are plans for all of these!\n\nTHKD: Savage Necromancy hails from Phoenix, Arizona. How would you describe the metal scene in your home city/state? What new bands from the area should readers be on the lookout for?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: Be on the lookout for Moribund Dawn, mystical & imperial Swedish style Black Metal praising Vinterland, Dawn, & Dissection!\n\nTHKD: It seems as though in recent years there has been a proliferation of war metal or bestial black/death metal bands coming out of the US and Canada. Why do you think this is? Do you consider Savage Necromancy to be part of that movement?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: I don’t know honestly, and history will tell!\n\nTHKD: I often see Savage Necromancy being compared favorably to Archgoat online. Do you consider them to be a primary influence? What other bands have inspired you?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: Archgoat has for sure been a primary influence on this band and we don’t hide it. In Feathers Fall To Flames further in writing the album I was being more influenced by bands like Impiety and Nifelheim and I see our progression going more towards this sort of bestial black/thrash influenced path.\n\nTHKD: What are you currently listening to and what are your favorite releases of 2022 so far? Do you have any recommendations for THKD’s readers?\n\nConjurer of Putrid Desecrations: I’m currently listening to the same Chemlab song on repeat. Very much been on an industrial and old-school EBM kick lately. I’m in full-on riff writing mode now and I don’t like listening to adjacent stuff to what I’m making (especially if it’s recent)\n\nTHKD: Are there any final thoughts you’d like to add?\n\nBlack Metal Victory!!\n\nSpecial thanks to Earsplit PR for arranging this interview.\n\nOn February 13th, 1970, Black Sabbath released their self-titled debut album, inventing heavy metal in the process. But in September of that same year, they unleashed the genre’s bible. While Black Sabbath saw the quartet still working to fully define their musical path, Paranoid was the sound of a band that had tapped into the source from which all metal has flowed for the last fifty-plus years.\n\nBlack Sabbath wasn’t the first metal band I heard; that honor falls to Metallica. But I was lucky enough to hear them during my formative years, and while hearing “Black Sabbath” for the first time on a good set of headphones gave me the chills, it was the entirety of Paranoid that made me understand why Sabbath was the one true heavy metal godhead.\n\nThat’s because Paranoid is a murderer’s row of incredible songs, starting with “War Pigs.” Catchy without being conventional, progressive without disappearing up its own ass and heavy as hell, “War Pigs” is one of Sabbath’s greatest achievements, a deep, dark and tension-filled rumination on the evils of warfare. When one considers that the world was only a few years removed from the Vietnam War’s bloodiest period, the song takes on even more meaning. According to Wikipedia, bassist Geezer Butler has been quoted as saying that the song is “totally against the Vietnam War, about how these rich politicians and rich people start all the wars for their benefit and get all the poor people to die for them.” The image of corrupt politicians being put to judgment for their corruption remains a powerful one, especially in the post-Trump era.\n\nKicking off your album with one of the greatest metal tracks of all time would be a ridiculously bold move for just about any other band, but Sabbath’s songwriting throughout Paranoid is so excellent throughout that it doesn’t that album doesn’t feel front-loaded. “War Pigs” is followed by the urgent title track, a short, sharp shock of a song that almost feels like proto-punk and then into the ultra-trippy “Planet Caravan.” “Paranoid” was written in the studio as a filler track, but if there’s one to be learned here it’s that a throwaway Sabbath track from this era of band blows roughly 99.9% of other heavy band’s best songs out of the goddamn water and as such it ended up becoming one of the band’s signature songs. “Planet Caravan” on the other hand is one of the Sabs’ most underrated tracks, a musical trip to the far reaches of space that sounds great when you’re sober but even better with the assistance of a dimly lit room and some primo weed.\n\n“Iron Man” closes out side A of Paranoid and I’m not sure what more can be said about this track other than it is heavy metal personified. From Tony Iommi’s monstrous, world-beating guitar-work, to Ozzy’s maniacal vocals, to the mind-blowing outro that shows why Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are the best metal rhythm section of all time, “Iron Man” is yet another stunning achievement in the Sabbath canon and contains what is quite simply one of the greatest riffs ever written. “Iron Man” is also the track that most folks associate with Black Sabbath and with good reason.\n\nOf course, as amazing as side A of Paranoid is, side B is certainly no slouch, beginning with the devastating duo of “Electric Funeral” and “Hand of Doom.” Taken together, these songs are the songwriting blueprints for pretty much every stoner doom band ever. “Electric Funeral,” begins with a creepy main riff and haunting vocals, becomes frantic around the two-minute mark and then settles back down into a dying man’s crawl before fading back into the abyss from whence it came. “Hand of Doom” on the other, uh, hand, is an atmospheric doom workout that makes excellent use of dynamics and is one my favorite songs from the Sab four. The way the different sections of the song flow into each other is nothing short of masterful, emphasizing yet again the band’s masterful songwriting and musicianship.\n\nWhereas the the first thirty-five minutes and forty-five seconds of Paranoid are serious as a heart attack, the final six minutes and fifteen seconds showcase Black Sabbath at their most playful. “Fairies Wear Boots” is a tale of coming home late at night (presumably after one hell of a bender) to see “a fairy with boots on dancin’ with a dwarf.” The song sees Iommi and Co. returning to their bluesy roots with a shuffling rhythm and a lead-heavy central riff to finish out the album, perfectly capping off eight tracks of absolute metal mastery.\n\nMore than any other Black Sabbath album, Paranoid is the one that blew my young mind and in revisiting the album to write this piece, it’s pretty easy to see why. This is the goddamn urtext, nothing more, nothing less, ’nuff said, true believer!\n\nRead other entries in THKD’s Top 100 Metal Albums.\n\nAUTHOR’S NOTE: I conducted the following interview with Voivod’s Daniel “Chewy” Mongrain for the ill-fated Backlit zine back in 2013. I recently discovered that I still have access to the old Google drive for the zine and given that I was incredibly honored to interview one the greatest bands in the multiverse, it seemed like a damn shame to leave it to rot down in the vaults. Below is the interview exactly as it originally appeared in Backlit #1.\n\nIf there is one band that epitomizes what Backlit is all about, it is surely Voivod. The forward-thinking Quebecois quartet has been on the cutting edge of heavy music since day one, cranking out post-apocalyptic, punk-tinged thrash metal that often sounded like it was being beamed in directly from the far future. Unfortunately, Voivod’s future came to an abrupt, heart-breaking halt when guitarist Denis “Piggy” D’Amour passed away due to cancer in 2005, but in a show of great bravery and resolve, the band decided to carry on, bringing veteran six-stringer Daniel Mongrain (Martyr, ex-Gorguts, ex-Capharnaum) into the fold. It isn’t every day that a musician gets to join his favorite band, but that’s exactly what happened when Mongrain was invited to play with Voivod; his enthusiasm and passion are downright infectious. I caught up with the guitarist via e-mail to grill him about Voivod’s scorching new album Target Earth, and what it’s like to write, record and tour with your boyhood heroes.\n\nJH: First, tell us a little about how you came to join Voivod after Piggy’s passing. Were you at all nervous to be joining such a legendary band? Was it a difficult decision to join, given the circumstances?\n\nDaniel Mongrain: Well, I met Blacky in 2002, we became good friends. I ran into Snake and Away a couple times. Went to Piggy’s memorial…In 2006, my band Martyr (Canada) covered “Brainscan” (from 1988’s Dimension Hatross) on Feeding the Abscess (2006). Then at some point in 2007, Blacky and I ended up playing a medley of Voivod for the 25th anniversary of metal in Montreal as a tribute to Piggy. His family was there, as well as Snake and Away. Later, I wrote to Away and told him that if at some point they would do something special with the Voivod entity, in any context, I would be very honored–as a fan–to play even a note or a song with them. Because I was a fan since I was 11-12 years old, I knew the repertoire…Couple of months later; I got a call from him asking me to join Voivod onstage for the biggest metal festival in Montreal (Heavy Mtl) featuring Iron Maiden and Motley Crue. It was supposed to be just that one show…Then we opened for Ozzy in Calgary and we went to Japan with Testament and Forbidden…It’s been 5 years now, and a new album\n\nis about to be released…\n\nI remember I didn’t know what to say over the phone…I felt very honored for being asked that task, very excited to play with my favorite band…I was speechless…I also recall, at the first rehearsal…I was pretty nervous, but pretty confident– I did my homework, you know. Then after the first song…Snake was all smiles and gave me a big hug…They made me feel very comfortable right away.\n\nJH: Did you feel any pressure stepping into the role of guitarist for Voivod, given Piggy’s iconic status as a player and musical innovator?\n\nDM: At first I was a little stressed, but I saw it as a challenge– I mean, I don’t see myself as stepping in anybody’s role, I can’t replace Piggy. He is unique as a person, musician, composer– all I can do is do my best to honor his music and put all of my energy into working with the band to create new stuff all together as a team. I’ve been a fan of this band since before I even played the guitar…Those guys were my first music teachers, so to speak…\n\nOf course at first I was a little nervous, then everything fell into place naturally– nothing was forced, and I felt pretty confident that I could do the job right.\n\nJH: Voivod is a very influential band, can you talk a little about the influence they had on you as a musician and a fan, prior to joining?\n\nDM: For me, they established some rules– one is, you have to be unique and find your own way. You have to be authentic. Doesn’t matter where you’re from, you can make it happen. Doesn’t matter what people say about you, just do what you believe in. Musically, Voivod is my school of composition– I mean, I learned a lot from all the records, I’ve studied it meticulously, all the details.\n\nThey made me curious about music. I owe them my Bachelor Degree in Jazz Music because if it weren’t for them, I probably would never have gone to a university to study music or form a band at all…For me, they were the trigger for many important decisions in my life.\n\nJH: What goals did you have for joining Voivod? What did you hope to get out of it and were there specific things you wanted to bring to the table that the band hadn’t had before?\n\nDM: Never thought about that. I hope we can do this for years. As long as the guys are in for it, I’ll be there! I don’t have control on what’s next…I just let things go.\n\nJH: You’re well known for your work in Martyr and with Gorguts. How do your previous experiences help shape what you’re doing now with Voivod?\n\nDM: The question should be: “How did Voivod help you shape what you did with your previous bands?” Of course I’m an experienced musician, I played in over 70 different bands in all kinds of music in various contexts. I played in a musical, I played in blues, reggae, hip-hop, jazz, rock, tribute, cover bands, etc…In any kind of venue you can imagine. That helped a lot to be a better musician and a better human being. With that background, I was confident enough and mature enough as a musician and a person to be a part of Voivod. But I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them.\n\nJH: Let’s talk a little about the new album, Target Earth. What was it like writing and recording as a member of Voivod, compared to your experiences with other bands?\n\nDM: Different persons, different dynamic, different band, different aesthetic. We didn’t write right away, we toured for 4 years before writing anything, so we knew each other a lot better– personally and musically. Then we improvised together, recorded it and some of the jams became embryos of songs. Then Blacky and I came up with ideas and riffs, we would trade files and record over each other’s ideas. We would sometimes write together and record a demo right away, or work alone and bring ideas to the jam space. Then Away and Snake would put their input and ideas in it, and we would arrange the songs and riffs together.\n\nIt came out very naturally and it was great teamwork! Everybody was involved a lot in the composition. I was very happy to experience that journey of creativity!\n\nJH: Were there any specific challenges that arose during the creation of the new album and if so how did you overcome them?\n\nDM: Doing it was a challenge in itself, in a good way. We were all very motivated and thrilled about it. We never really struggled with anything, some songs were written close to the deadline of entering the studio, lyrics also but…That’s pretty usual stuff.\n\nJH: Is there a particular song or moment on Target Earth that stands out as your favorite and if so, what can you tell us about it?\n\nDM: Hmm…That’s really hard to say…My fave one changes all the time…I really like “Mechanical Mind” because it’s very intricate and progressive. I like “Warchaic” for its dynamics and melodies. I love to play “Kluskap O’ Kom” live, I really like them all…We’re very proud of it!\n\nJH: What are some of the themes being explored on Target Earth, musically and conceptually? How do they relate to previous Voivod albums, if at all?\n\nDM: Well, it has this post-apocalyptic vibe, fear of hi-tech weaponry, insanity, pollution, people manifesting in the streets, conspiracy theory– a lot of topics seemed reminiscent of the early career of the band, but it’s quite actual right now! There is also a song about the first nations, inspired by the Mi’kmaqs in Canada. “Target Earth,” well, the earth could be a target for some aliens up there, but I guess we don’t need them to destroy our world because we’re pretty good at it ourselves! So “target” could also mean that Earth is our target to care for.\n\nJH: Voivod has always been seen as a very forward-thinking or even “futuristic” band. What do you think it is about the band that makes it unique?\n\nDM: The people in it. Every member’s imagination put together as a whole. The uniqueness of that energy makes a band unique.\n\nJH: How has your perspective on what Voivod is changed, going from being a fan of the band to a full-fledged member?\n\nDM: It didn’t really change. I was afraid it would change, but I get the same magical feeling now when I listen to a record or I play a song as when I was a kid…It’s even stronger now. I mean, a band is always greater than the individuals in it. At some point it belongs to space-time universe. It is in orbit.\n\nJH: Will you be touring extensively in support of Target Earth? Do you enjoy playing live and touring? How does playing live with Voivod differ from your previous bands?\n\nDM: We are definitely gonna tour everywhere we can! Can’t wait to go on the road again. We love meeting the fans, traveling, seeing new places, and going back to places we’ve been, meeting up with friends we made. Playing live is one of the greatest feelings, there’s nothing you can compare with that kind of feeling. I’m addicted to that. Playing music is my passion, playing with Voivod makes me feel like a kid in a candy store.\n\nJH: Are there any final thoughts you’d like to add?\n\nDM: Life is good!\n\nI don’t recall exactly how I discovered long-defunct melodic death metal quintet Julie Laughs Nomore; it could have been while traveling down a Metal Archives rabbit hole, or perhaps perusing a random list of melodic death metal albums on Rate Your Music. Struck by their weird-ass band name (I’m not a big Candlemass fan so I had no idea that’s where they got it from), I went to check them out on YouTube and was blown away by what I heard. After much digging, I found a CD copy of their second album From the Mist of the Ruins for a ridiculously reasonable price and it has been one of my favorite melodic death metal albums ever since.\n\nIf you’ve never heard From the Mist of the Ruins, I’ll start by saying that Julie Laughs Nomore possess a sound that should have made them huge. Combing sweeping, epic guitar melodies and devastating straight-up death metal passages with a light yet zesty sprinkle of heavy/power metal influence and just a dash of black metal, the band did much to separate themselves from the hordes of melodeath bands that flooded the market from the mid-nineties to the mid two-thousands. I can only assume that the misfortune of being signed to a series of fly-by-night micro labels hampered their ability to get the attention they deserved; I’m sure the oddball band name and rather hideous album art probably didn’t help matters.\n\nWhatever the case, the album is one of the true hidden gems of early 2000s extreme metal thanks not only to Julie Laughs Nomore’s unique approach to melodeath, but also due their expert craftsmanship. These guys were excellent songwriters and musicians, which makes it absolutely criminal that songs such as “Children of the Empty Cross” “Bringer of Misery” and “From the Mist of the Ruins” have still yet to be heard and embraced by a larger audience. From the exquisite riffage to the highly varied vocal approach that features everything from higher-pitched rasps, to low growls, to rough-around-the-edges cleans that somewhat recall Emperor-era Ihsahn, every element of From the Mist of the Ruins is meticulously placed and perfectly executed.\n\nWhile the band’s musical chops and knack for great melodies are certainly key to the album’s success, one the greatest aspects of From the Mist of the Ruins is the fact that Julie Laughs Nomore aren’t afraid to put the death in melodic death metal. Whereas many bands of the era were far more concerned with the melodic side of things, Julie Laughs Nomore were more than capable of bringing the brutality, as on the aforementioned “Children of the Empty Cross;” the ultra-heavy passage that kicks off at the 01:53 mark accompanied by dueling death growls is enough to cave in the skulls of most mortals. On the back half of the album “Lords of Pleasure” begins with hefty chromatic chugging before morphing into speedy tremolo riffs, with some of the album’s most wicked vocals tying it all together. These are just a few examples of Julie Laughs Nomore at their heaviest; rest assured that similar moments are found throughout From the Mist of the Ruins, making for an album that’s both catchy and crushing.\n\nProduced and engineered by Jonas Kjellgren (Scar Symmetry, The Absence, Centinex), From the Mist of the Ruins sounds great; guitars and vocals dominate the mix with the drums and bass playing a supporting role, which makes perfect sense for a band who’s two greatest strengths are stellar guitar-work and a multi-pronged vocal attack. If there is one gripe to be had, it’s that the bass drum could use a little more oomph, but aside from that, Kjellgren’s production work here is as masterful as the band’s writing and playing, emphasizing everything that makes From the Mist of the Ruins such a stellar slab of melodic death metal.\n\nSadly, Julie Laughs Nomore never got their due while they were an active band and it doesn’t seem as if they’re going to get the reappraisal they so desperately deserve anytime soon. It’s a damn shame too, because From the Mist of the Ruins is far more deserving of a deluxe reissue than roughly 99.9% of the crummy third and fourth tier OSDM albums that get such extravagant treatment. I guess it’s a case of those who know, know for the time being, but at least maybe the five people who read this review will become new fans of one of the most underrated melodic death metal albums in the multiverse.\n\nWARNING: The following post is NSFW as fuck. If you’re easily offended, it might be better if you sit this one out.\n\nSometime in the year 1995, the great country of Finland gave anal birth to one of the greatest/shittiest bands ever to walk (stalk?) the Earth. That band was Torsofuck. An absolutely repellent combination of the most offensive, knuckle-dragging aspects of slamming brutal death metal and goregrind, the band blazed a path of musical and lyrical deviance off and on for nearly a decade-and-a-half before finally, mercifully calling it a day for good back in 2009, not counting a posthumous limited live cassette release that was only purchased by pale-skinned basement dwellers that own all four pressings of Gut’s Odour of Torture and can’t wait to tell you all about it.\n\nBut what did Torsofuck leave us with after almost fifteen years in the game? Actually, not much. A demo, two splits and a full-length is all they could muster in that length of time, but let’s face it, it can’t be easy concocting music this boneheaded/brilliant. I mean, that shit has to take effort.\n\nAnyway, after releasing the High Level of Cannibalistic Violence demo that no one actually heard and a split with Vomitorial Corpulence that was actually heard by no one, Torsofuck finally made it big in 2002 with the Disgusting Gore and Pathology/Polymorphisms to Severe Sepsis and Trauma (that’s not a goddamn mouthful, nope, not at all), a split with the legendary Brazilian goregrinders Lymphatic Phlegm on Bizarre Leprous Productions. For those that aren’t familiar, Bizarre Leprous is like the Nuclear Blast of goregrind labels, so the world at large would finally get a chance to experience the genius of vocalist/guitarist/bassist Mikko Friberg and guitarist/drum programmer Jarkko Haapala in all it’s fucked up, repugnant glory.\n\nIndeed, Torsofuck made the most of the of opportunity and wasted no time in taking a big steaming dump in listeners’ earholes on Disgusting Gore…, kicking things off with the utterly putrid “Fistfucking Her Decomposed Cadaver,” a song dominated by drums that sound like a pissed-off secretary in the 1950’s pounding the ever-living shit out of a typewriter and some of the most toilety toilet vocals you’re probably ever going to hear. Yes, the guitars are in there playing third fiddle to the drums and vox, mostly playing riffs that I’d refer to as “caveman riffs,” but that would be an insult to cavemen and they aren’t here to defend themselves, so that hardly seems fair. Well, except for Caveman Cult, but I don’t think those guys are even real cavemen! Talk about false advertising…\n\nWhat were we talking about? Oh yeah, that’s right, the rest of Torsofuck’s side of the split goes on for three more tracks in much the same vein as “Fistfucking Her Decomposed Cadaver,” although “Craving for a Fresh Shit” does feature what might be the most inept lead guitar work in human history during it’s final stretch and “Cannibal” (a very out of character tame song title) does add some vocals that sound like a pig rooting around in its own feces to go along with the aforementioned toilet vocals, because clearly Torsofuck were all about thoughtful, nuanced songwriting.\n\nOf course, the split with Lymphatic Phlegm was merely a rancid taste of what was to come. In 2004 Torsofuck would release their magnum opus, the shit-splattered plat du jour known as Erotic Diarrhea Fantasy. In the two years since Disgusting Pathology… the duo somehow managed to get heavier, uglier, dumber and even more disgusting, shitting out one of the sickest, most sexually depraved metal albums of all time.\n\n“Mutilated for Sexual Purposes” begins with a porn sample that’s almost as long as the song itself before the brain-mangling morass of brutal slamming goregrind comes surging forward, covering everything in its path with buckets of blood, guts, piss and other fluids best left unmentioned. The production isn’t exactly better than that of the Lymphatic Phlegm split, but it is louder and gnarlier, with the guitars more prominent in the mix and bathed in distortion that’s so thick ‘n’ chunky you could stand a fork up in it. The kick drum still sounds pretty typewritery, but it’s pushed back in the mix this time around, making it far less irritating.\n\nWhile Erotic Diarrhea Fantasy certainly benefitted from the heavier production scheme, Friberg and Haapala’s (d)evolution as both players and songwriters also played a huge part in the album’s success. Torsofuck had reached their final form here, striking a perfect, perverse balance between the lizard-brain tickling violence of brutal slamming death metal and the sewage-gurgling sickness of goregrind. I mean, this shit is right up there with Citizen Kane, Moby Dick and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in terms of artistic achievement.\n\nTorsofuck also perfected their lyrical prowess on Erotic Diarrhea Fantasy, as evidenced by what is surely one of the greatest songs in the history of recorded music, “Raped By Elephants.” The track begins with a sample from Freddy Got Fingered (the scene where Tom Green’s character jerks off an elephant, naturally) before spewing memorable gems such as;\n\nI sucked like a whore while I was assfucked by elephant trunk\n\nAfter all it wasnt too bad at all\n\nIt took only about ten minutes and cock in my mouth started to cum\n\nExtremely huge load of elephant sperm filled my throat and\n\nSpurted all over my face\n\nI was completely fucked up, but elephants had one more thing to do\n\nAll three of them huffed and puffed shits on me\n\nThen they left me alone with my ripped asshole\n\nI’ll never go to Africa again\n\nErotic Diarrhea Fantasy was Torsofuck’s final studio output and how could it not be? There’s simply no way in hell they could’ve topped such a masterpiece. In the years since its release, the album has attained something of a cult following among those that crave the the lewdest and most degenerate sounds known to man and has been reissued several times on various formats by well known underground labels such as American Line Productions, Morbid Generation Records and Gore House Productions.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s difficult to say how or why Torsofuck were motivated to make such morally corrupt metal magic; I could only find two interviews with the band online and one appears to be in German while the other reads like two malfunctioning Twitter bots attempting to carry on a conversation, so god only knows what was going through their heads when they decided to write songs about elephant rape and anal sex with corpses. But make magic they did, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that the metal scene is pretty much the worst goddamn thing to ever happen to human civilization.\n\nFor even the most dedicated fans, keeping up with Boris can be damn near impossible; it often feels as if every other month the band hits us with a new release to dive into, typically in a completely different style than whatever came before. Regardless of the challenges it often presents, I try to check out as much of their output as I can, and I was excited to hear that they would be releasing their new album W via Sacred Bones Records, the label that brought us John Carpenter’s excellent Lost Themes Trilogy. What would it sound like? What wild new stylistic directions would they take their music in this time around?\n\nAs I alluded to above, one of the many wonderful things about Boris is that you never know which version of Boris you’re going to get from album to album, and for W the chameleonic Japanese trio have largely stepped away from the crushing drone/doom and sludgy punk of recent releases such as Dear and No to present us with one of their most ambient and atmospheric collections of songs to date. The album sees guitarist Wata handling the bulk of the vocals and her delicate voice works perfectly with the dreamy minimalism of tracks such as “Icelina” and “Beyond Good and Evil”. Boris blends elements of shoegaze, ambient and noise to create surreal soundscapes more suited for hallucinating than headbanging.\n\nIn fact, only traditionally heavy moment comes in the form of “The Fallen,” a four minute and thirty second sludge/slugfest that is perfectly placed at the center of the album; whereas many heavy bands will place a mellow track or interlude in the middle of an album to break up the heaviness, Boris flip the script by placing a heavy track in the middle of W to break up the mellowness. It’s a friendly reminder that Boris can still be ridiculously heavy whenever the hell they feel like it and adds yet another surprising facet to the album; just when you think you have all the answers, Boris changes the questions.\n\nWhile frequent collaborator/legendary psych rock guitarist Michio Kurihara (Ghost, White Heaven, The Stars) is conspicuously absent from W, it’s still pretty far out; much of this can be attributed to the fact that whether they’re conjuring up Earth-shaking drone/doom, throwing down on some heavy rock, or indulging in noise and ambient sounds, Boris have a knack for creating albums that are beyond immersive. I took the liberty of listening to this shit after indulging in some of my favorite “smoky treats” and I felt like I was swimming in pure sound for a little over forty minutes, which ain’t no bad thing. Listening to W while altered probably won’t melt your brain (that’s what Earthless’ new album is for), but it does make for an extremely pleasant trip.\n\nBoris’ discography is so vast and so diverse that trying to determine where exactly W ranks within it is about as far from an easy task as it gets. I can however say with great certainty that the album grows on me a little more every time I listen to it and it’s very rapidly becoming go-to album to listen to after smoking a fatty in 2022. The direction of W may disappoint fans of Boris’ heavier/doomier material, but those that also appreciate their wildly experimental side will find a great deal to enjoy here.\n\nhttps://boris.bandcamp.com/\n\nGoddamn, it’s been almost two years since the last installment of OOB! Of course my YouTube channel has been covering much of what I’d normally cover in one of these for the last little while, but whatever the case, it has been far too long since we’ve rounded up all things brutal and bludgeoning in one convenient spot here at the THKD mothership. So without further ado, let’s break out the shovels and start digging…\n\nCorpsegrinder – s/t (Perseverance Music Group, 2022) Hot off the success of Cannibal Corpse’s excellent Violence Unimagined, vocalist George “Corpsegrinder” Fisher has decided to strike out on his own with his first solo album, appropriately titled Corpsegrinder. Produced by Hatebreed’s Jamey Jasta and backed by guitarist Charlie Bellmore (Dee Snider, ex-Toxic Holocaust) and drummer Nick Bellmore (Dee Snider, ex-Toxic Holocaust), the album is a catchier-than-herpes thirty-two minute slab of death metal, but it ultimately suffers due to the fact that it lacks the merciless, pummeling brutality and frantic yet precise technicality of prime Cannibal Corpse. Granted, it probably isn’t fair to compare what is likely just meant be a fun one-off side project to the mighty CC, but when you’re working with the vocalist for one of the best death metal bands on the planet, the comparisons are all but inevitable.\n\nIndeed, Corpsegrinder might not quite measure up to the impossibly high standards of the likes of Violence Unimagined, Vile or Kill, but it’s still plenty enjoyable thanks to the memorable if simplistic songwriting and Fisher as usual puts everything he’s got into the vocals on tracks such as “On Wings of Carnage” “Crimson Proof” and “Defined by your Demise.” The Bellmore brothers do a fine job of laying down tracks for Fisher to growl over and most of the cuts feature a refrain or riff that will at least get lodged in your skull for a few days, even if they won’t completely hammer smash your face.\n\nAs expected, Corpsegrinder sounds great; every instrument is allowed space in the mix and Fisher’s vocals are front and center without being overpowering. If there’s one gripe to be had, it’s that the guitars could use a wee bit more heft in order to fully maximize the skull-cracking heaviness the album is clearly aiming for. Given the appearance of death metal uber-producer Erik Rutan on “Acid Vat,” it might have been wise to have him stick around and assist with beefing things up a bit more ala the last few Cannibal Corpse albums.\n\nCannibal Corpse diehards will no doubt want to add this album to their collection based solely on Fisher’s involvement, but for the casual fan, Corpsegrinder will likely fall into the category of an amusing but ultimately inessential listen.\n\nBludgeoned – Summary Execution (Vile Tapes, 2022) Hailing from Shelton, WA, Bludgeoned are something of a supergroup in the making, featuring seventeen year old brutal death metal wunderkind Nikhil Talwalkar (Anal Stabwound, Undeciphered) on drums, ex-I Declare War and Pathology vocalist Jon Huber and ex-Covidectomy guitarist Sean May. On their debut EP Summary Execution, the trio whip up a ferociously fun slab of slamming brutality that will have you headbanging uncontrollably, throwing the furniture around and swinging dead cats in no time.\n\nBludgeoned don’t do anything you haven’t heard before on Summary Execution, but it’s how they do it that makes them stand out from the brutal death metal pack. Each performance is nothing short of topnotch; Talwalkar is a prodigy on the drums and his relentless attack drives the EP forward, while May lays down some totally sick riffage that makes him a guitarist to keep an eye on, and it’s always a pleasure to hear Huber’s impossibly deep vomit vox spewing flesh-eating acid over everything that gets in their way. These guys know how to bring the pain in ways that are as memorable as they are vicious and the band sounds lean, mean and hungry throughout the EP’s all-too-brief run-time.\n\nAlthough Summary Execution doesn’t even surpass the fifteen minute mark, it’s enough to know that these guys are onto something great and it’s only a matter of time before they get picked up by a bigger label like Severed or Comatose and grind us all into fucking powder with a full length. Until that day comes, songs like “Circadian Servitude” and “Genocidal Processes” hit hard enough to make your soul leave your body. The EP is out now via Vile Tapes and limited to just one hundred copies, so don’t sleep.\n\nFatuous Rump – Perceptions of the Dark Ornaments (Lacerated Enemy Records, 2021) What exactly is a “fatuous rump?” The world may never know, but what we do know is that Fatuous Rump is yet another product of the sick-ass mind of Larry Wang, the man behind Gorepot, Facelift Deformation, Lesbian Tribbing Squirt and roughly one billion other really gross projects that mostly appeal to weird, pale-skinned basement dwellers that can’t wait to tell you about how they own all three of Cock and Ball Torture’s full lengths on vinyl.\n\nWhile Perceptions of the Dark Ornaments is a fine enough bit of slamming brutality, it ultimately feels a bit run-of-the-mill in comparison to some of Wang’s other projects; Fatuous Rump lacks the bizarre humor of Gorepot, the ferocity of Maggot Colony, or the grinding perversity of Lesbian Tribbing Squirt, and at forty minutes it’s just too damn long for such a bog standard slam album. Additionally, the slams aren’t particularly memorable and the songwriting as a whole feels rather lackluster.\n\nAt the end of the day, Perceptions of the Dark Ornaments isn’t a bad album, it’s just kind of there and doesn’t really do anything to differentiate itself from the five thousand other slam albums being released every month that sound just like it. File this one under “for slam ultra-ultra-ultra fanatics and Larry Wang worshippers only.”\n\n200 Stab Wounds – Slave to the Scalpel (Maggot Stomp, 2021) Alright, now we’re fucking getting somewhere! 200 Stab Wounds’ debut full length got hyped to the high heavens last year, which is why I avoided it until recently; I find in these situations it’s best to wait until the hype dies down. Now that I’ve had the opportunity to spend some time with Slave to the Scalpel, I can safely say that it for the most part lives up to the hype. Coming off like a hybrid of the Cannibal Corpse school of OG brutal death metal and the groovy, slamming style of Internal Bleeding, 200 Stab Wounds manage to hit all the sweet spots in just under half an hour, making death metal that’s insanely catchy and compact.\n\nFolks who’ve been following THKD since the beginning know that I’m all about craftsmanship over originality and 200 Stab Wounds are well on their way to becoming expert brutal death metal craftsman if tracks like “Skin Milk” “Stifling Stew” and “Drilling Your Head” are anything to go by. The band wear their influences on their sleeve, but they also take those influences and use them to craft something that can stand on its own; there’s always something to be said for that, especially when the end result is this crushing.\n\nSlave to the Scalpel is one of the better brutal death metal debuts I’ve heard in the last few years and as with Bludgeoned, I wouldn’t be surprised if a bigger label takes notice of 200 Stab Wounds before too long and decides to strap a rocket to their collective back. If these guys continue to hone their craft, they could very easily come to be sitting atop the new wave of death metal heap in a few years time; that might not be saying much when one considers some of the competition, but that shouldn’t take anything away from the fact that 200 Stab Wounds are uh, killing it at the moment and show no signs of letting up.\n\nWell folks, that wraps it up for another edition of Oodles of Brutals; hopefully it won’t be another two years before the next one drops. As always, many thanks to all the bands, labels and PR peeps for sending me stuff to cover, and to all the readers that have followed along despite the erratic publishing schedule. If there are any bands you’d like to see covered in a future installment of OOB, drop me a line in the comments and until next time, STAY BRUTAL.\n\nWe’ve lived in Las Vegas for a little under a year. Well, technically we live in Henderson, NV, but you have to go into Las Vegas to do anything cool. Living here was always meant to be temporary, but it turned out to be a little more temporary than we anticipated for a number of reasons that I’m not going to go into here, because I like to keep it posi.\n\nWhile I’m not terribly sad to be leaving, I will say that I’m sad I never got to experience the music scene here thanks to our pal COVID. There have been shows, but I’m just not comfortable going to them yet due to this pandemic we’ve all been dealing with for what seems like forever. When I first moved to Sacramento, CA, I started going to shows and checking out the local venues almost immediately, so it’s been really strange not to be able to do that here.\n\nAlthough I haven’t been going to shows, I have been spending a lot of time at the local record stores, specifically Zia Records, which has two great locations in Vegas. They remind me a lot of Sacramento’s dearly departed Dimple Records, so I’ve been very happy to have at least one thing that feels familiar during our time here. Another great shop out here in the desert is Primitive Recordings, which is run by Roger Beaujard of Mortician fame. I didn’t get to go there nearly as often I would have liked to, but it was a pleasure meeting Roger and loading up on Mortician merch and other goodies; if you’re a metalhead and you’re ever in Vegas, definitely stop by his store, especially if you’ve got a taste for death metal.\n\nI wish I had more to say about our time in Vegas, but I’m honestly at a loss as I type this. I’m glad I had the experience of living here, because I have gotten to see and do some really cool shit, but I’m also ready to move on.\n\nOur next stop is Salem, OR. From what little research I’ve been able to do, it doesn’t seem like there’s much of a metal scene there (I just might have to figure out how to start one). Metal Archives lists thirty-six bands from Salem, but many of them seem to be split up or inactive. There are a few live music venues, but none of them appear to really cater to metal with the exception of some one-off shows here and there. I have noticed some good punk shows rolling through, such as MDC and Agent Orange, and we’ve already got tickets to see Warduna in October, so I’m hopeful that we’ll still be able to get our live music fix, even if it isn’t a constant barrage of metal.\n\nOf course, the great news is we’re only about forty-five minutes from Portland and unsurprisingly it appears that’s where all the action is when it comes to metal in Oregon. From what I’ve seen, it looks like tons of great tours roll through there, and to be completely honest, I’m fine with having to drive a little ways to go to a show, because it means I live away from all the hustle and bustle of the “big city.” At this stage of my life I think I might finally be ready for a little peace and quiet.\n\nSo, in the last few years I’ll have gone from being pretty well immersed in Sacramento’s metal scene, to not being able to immerse myself in Las Vegas’ metal scene, to being just a short drive away from Portland’s metal scene. It’s going to be an interesting transition and I’m curious to see how it affects my writing, if at all. Only time will tell, but I’m excited for what the future may hold.\n\nIn every music scene, there are always bands that continually fly under the radar no matter how much noise they make and the metal scene is no different. Formed in 1993, Baltimore, Maryland’s Pessimist is one of those great unsung bands. Although they released only three albums before breaking up in 2006 (they’ve since reformed), each one is an incendiary slab of blasting violence from a band that doesn’t get nearly enough recognition for their commitment to the fine art of brutal death metal. In 2021 Season of Mist wisely decided to re-release all three Pessimist full-lengths with remastered sound and updated artwork, bringing the quartet’s old school brutality to a wider audience and giving them a chance to be seen and heard the way they were always meant to be.\n\nCult of the Initiated (1997) After first hitting the scene in 1993 with their Dark Reality demo, it would take Pessimist another four years to conjure up their debut full length, Cult of the Initiated. While this is most certainly a brutal death metal album, there is also a heavy thrash influence at work, as well as just a hint of black metal, making for a singular release that doesn’t sound quite like anything else from that era. Somewhat technical but not as tightly wound as subsequent albums, Cult of the Initiated isn’t nearly as pummeling as what would follow for Pessimist, but its looseness at times recalls early Morbid Angel at their most unhinged, and that’s never a bad thing. While Cult of the Initiated might be Pessimist’s least brutal album, it is a thoroughly unique death metal listening experience that deserves to be heard.\n\nBlood for the Gods (1999) By the time Pessimist released Blood for the Gods in 1999 they’d for the most part excised the thrash and black metal influences in favor of a more pure brutal death metal sound, resulting in what many consider to to be the band’s best album. The performances are tighter here than on Cult of the Initiated, resulting in something that’s also more straightforward than what came before, but still avoids the monotony trap by piling on the killer riffs and sick solos. Tracks such as “Demonic Embrace” “Unspeakable Terror” and “Tunnel Rats” emphasize Pessimist’s increased emphasis on speed and technicality, making for a nearly flawless brutal death metal album that still holds up over two decades later, thanks to the high degree of songwriting acumen on display throughout. Indeed, Blood for the Gods is the album where Pessimist found their signature sound and remains an impressively intense slab of technically precise yet memorable brutality.\n\nSlaughtering the Faithful (2002) Pessimist’s third and final (so far) album is their most brutal release; listening to this thing is the musical equivalent of being hit repeatedly over the head with sledgehammers. And while the band’s continued dedication to making the most brutal death metal they possibly could is highly admirable, the over-the-top brutality ultimately makes for an album that isn’t quite as memorable as Cult of the Initiated or Blood for the Gods. That said, there’s still plenty to like about Slaughtering the Faithful; songs like “Infernal Abyss” and “Metempsychosis” are whirlwinds of unmitigated violence that were clearly designed for maximum neck-snapping, aided and abetted by an Erik Rutan production job that’s so goddamn thick you could stand up a fork in it. This is some quintessential early 2000s brutal death metal that can go toe-to-toe with the best of them.\n\nPessimist reformed in 2013 with a re-tooled lineup that now includes current and former members of Morbid Angel, Hideous Rebirth and Black Mass in addition to founding guitarist Kelly McLauchlin. So far they’ve yet to grace us with a comeback album, but if and when they do it’ll no doubt be a total skull-crusher. Here’s to hoping that day comes sooner than later.\n\nhttps://pessimist666.bandcamp.com/\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I heard Slayer. I was watching Headbanger’s Ball and the video for either the catchy yet sinister and atmospheric “Seasons in the Abyss” or the bulldozing face-fucker that is “War Ensemble” came on. Whichever track it was, my young mind was blown; it only took one song for me to realize Slayer was obviously waaay more evil than Metallica, Megadeth or Anthrax, whom I was already pretty familiar with and as a Catholic school kid growing up smack dab in the asshole of the Midwest, that was pretty much all it took for me to become instantly obsessed with The Big Four’s darkest, heaviest, meanest sounding band.\n\nIf memory serves, I used a Best Buy gift card that I’d gotten for Christmas to go out and buy Seasons in the Abyss and South of Heaven; I’m pretty sure that was all the old school Slayer they had. Although Seasons… is a great record that contains many classic tracks, it was South of Heaven that stuck with me and remains my favorite Slayer album to this very day.\n\nSure, Reign in Blood gets all the love, but let’s be honest, Reign in Blood should really be titled Angel of Death, Raining Blood and uh, Some Other Songs. I’m not saying it’s a bad record, but in terms of songwriting, atmosphere and evil-as-all-hell riffage, it absolutely pales in comparison to South of Heaven. Slayer took the template they established with “Angel of Death” and “Raining Blood” and made an entire album out of it. By slowing down and employing a more dynamic approach to their craft, the quartet unleashed a scathing yet memorable thrash attack that made many of their peers sound like Barney and Friends by comparison.\n\nIn the previous paragraph I mentioned evil-as-hell riffage and there can be no doubt much of South of Heaven‘s success lies at the feet of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. At this point in Slayer’s career, the duo were already working together like a well-oiled machine, throwing down with sick ‘n’ twisted riffs that propelled tracks such as “South of Heaven” “Live Undead” and “Mandatory Suicide” to instant classic status. As if the barrage of skull-smashing riffs wasn’t enough, the solos on South of Heaven are a whole other level of nasty; corrosive and utterly frenzied yet somehow still musical and more technically sound than on previous albums, ranking among the best in Slayer’s catalog.\n\nOf course, great guitar-work needs a solid foundation and Satan blessed Slayer with a rhythm section that included metal drumming dark lord Dave Lombardo. The drums sound absolutely thunderous on South of Heaven and rightfully so, because Lombardo’s performance is fucking flawless. I can’t remember who’s interview I once read that likened a band’s drummer to the engine room of a ship, but that comparison couldn’t be more accurate here, as Lombardo powers the band through the album with a combination of ferociousness and technicality that’s off the damn charts. Tom Araya’s bass is somewhat buried in the mix, but his throat-shredding bark is a force to be reckoned with; he might not be a great singer from a technical standpoint, but his voice is instantly recognizable and he delivers the lyrics with a maniacal intensity that perfectly suits the dark subject matter.\n\nAs is no doubt the case with many other metal heads of my generation, Slayer was the ultimate gateway band for me and South of Heaven was one of the key releases that eventually set me on the path to the even darker, heavier realms of death and black metal. But the album is more than just a stepping stone, it’s a touchstone of late-eighties thrash at its most devastatingly diabolical that still manages to be catchier than COVID and a million times more deadly.\n\nRead other entries in THKD’s Top 100 albums."
