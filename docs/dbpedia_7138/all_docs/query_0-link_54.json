I know the guys doesn't like playing live, but he really showed a large amount of disrepect to the audience. It's hard to explain exactly, but I felt kinda cheated. He just seemed to be messing around a lot like he didn't care. There probably weren't too many people there just to see him like I was, but I felt let down anyways. I'd say 'maybe next time', but I'm not sure I want to chance it. Oh and for what it's worth, Nicolai was accompanied by a woman on violin and a guy on lead electric guitar and 12-string.\n\nA new song on the right for you this week - this one from David & the Citizens. I don't know too much about these guys, but their album \"For All Happy Endings\" is just a great pop record. Check 'em out.\n\nwww.thearkworld.com just posted some video footage of The Ark's performance on the MTV program 'The Fridge'. Check it: \"Calleth You, Cometh I\" / \"Disease\" (requires RealPlayer)\n\nContinuing proof that they're poised to become the \"next big thing\": Dave Grohl will sport a t-shirt from The Sounds in the new Foo Fighters video \"Times Like These\".

He promises to have something ready by summer.\n\nThe final word on the new Fireside album is out! It's finally finished and it's gonna be called \"Get Shot\". Look for it on April 7 from Startracks.

Read more here.\n\nTimbuktu's new album \"The Botten Is Nådd\" comes out April 28. The first single will be for the track \"Ett Brev\", a song about the current world situation directed towards State Minister Göran Persson.\n\nJust in case you weren't paying attention, GSL Records recently released the new JR Ewing album \"Ride Paranoia\" worldwide. Distro is being done through Mordam for most of the world, so it shouldn't be too hard to track down. As you should already know, the band recently lost the Norweigan Grammies, but says they \"got to drink with all the lame Norwegian celebrities, and got a good laugh out of it.\" Hard for me to even imagine a band like that at the US Grammies, but whatever. Oh, and they also got a bunch of new shows lined up besides that Turbonegro tour (see 2/26). The dates:\n\n3/07 - Bodø @ Samfundet w/Amulet\n\n3/08 - Bodø @ Kulturhus w/Amulet\n\n3/09 - Tromsø @ Blå Rock w/Amulet\n\n3/28 - Namsos, Norway @ Namsos Rock Festival\n\n4/12 - Andøya @ Rock Mot Rus w/Amulet\n\n4/15 - Hannover, Germany @ Korn w/Seven Feet Four\n\n4/16 - Tilburg, Netherlands @ 013 Club w/Seven Feet Four\n\n4/17 - Stuttgart, Germany @ Smith Wigglesworth Festival w/Seven Feet Four\n\n4/18 - Vienna, Austria @ Tuwi w/Seven Feet Four\n\n4/19 - Nurnberg, Germany @ ...

They say they're going for a bit more or an organic, subtle sound comparable to \"Sgt. Pepper[-era] Beatles, Wilco and Kate Bush.\" Look for a single in May, the album to follow in September from Chalksounds.\n\nDark Funeral has revealed they have found a replacement guitarist for the recently departed Dominion. \"It looks like we finally have found the 'right' guy for the job,\" says Lord Ahriman, \"But there's really no hurry to reveal his name as of yet, but we will give you all a full presentation on him shortly.\" The band is currently rehearsing, booking shows for late spring and autumn, and starting to think about their next album. When the dates are confirmed, I'll post 'em.\n\nDrummer Hellhammer has left black-turned-goth metalband Kovenant. The new album \"S.E.T.I.\" (Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) comes out March 31 on Nuclear Blast. A limited edition version will include two bonus tracks: \"The Memory Remains\" (Metallica cover) and \"Subtopia\".\n\nØyvind Hægeland (Sprial Architect) has joined Arcturus as a replacement for singer Kristoffer Rygg (aka Garm, from Ulver).

Jon has family issues which prevent him from joining the band on the road.\n\nEntombed has annouced the following shows for the near future:\n\n3/22 - Esbjerg, DEN @ TBA\n\n3/28 - Björkliden, SWE @ Fjällanläggningen\n\n4/17 - Oslo, NOR @ Inferno Festival\n\n4/20 – Groningen, NETH @ Noordshock\n\n4/21 – Nijmegen, NETH @ Doornroosje\n\n5/02 - Durban, RSA @ TBA\n\n5/03 - Johannesburg, RSA @ TBA\n\n5/07 - Cape Town, RSA @ TBA\n\n5/24 – Alingsås, SWE @ Westgothafestivalen\n\n5/31 - Kranj, SLO @ TBA\n\n6/01 - Milano, ITA @ TBA\n\n6/05 - Leipzig, GER @ With Full Force Festival\n\nThe band's upcoming album is currently being mixed by engineer producer Pelle Gunnerfeldt for a May 12 release on their own label Threeman Recordings.\n\nThe mail form on the contact page managed to get broken for some reason, but I fixed it. Sorry about that.\n\nWant some more info about the various bands playing the upcoming ExMS Swedish Showcase gigs? Read this.\n\nNasum has booked a number of Finnish dates with Rotten Sound. Check it:\n\n4/23 - Helsinki @ Nosturi\n\n4/24 - Jyväskylä @ Lutakko\n\n4/25 - Turku @ Säätämö\n\n4/26 - Tampere @ Klubi\n\nGoing to see Nicolai Dunger open for Calexico in SF tomorrow. I'm pretty excited as it'll be my first time seeing him play. He's also got some new European dates lined up:\n\n3/22 - Växjö, Momento - fiket/baren på muséet\n\n3/28 - Rotterdam, Dutch Motel Mozaique Festival\n\n4/01 - Köln, Gebäude 9\n\n4/02 - München, Orange house\n\n4/03 - Berlin, Knaack\n\nWord has it that Union Carbide Productions will not be releasing a new single to coincide with their upcoming reunion at Hultsfred Fest as originally thought. Instead, they'll have a free single with a track from the first album \"In The Air Tonight\" along with an unreleased b-side. I guess the label doesn't want to try to sell an old song - can't blame 'em. So yeah, if you want the single, you gotta go to the fest.\n\nIsolation Years got a couple upcoming gigs lined up:\n\n3/5 - (S) Stockholm - Munchenbryggeriet w/Flaming Lips\n\n5/8 - (D) Berlin - Knaack\n\n5/15 - (CH) Bern - ISC Club\n\n8/7 - (CH) Pully/Lausanne - For Noise Festival\n\n8/9 - (D) Haldern - Open Air\n\nIn other Isolation Years news, Triggerfish.de recently did a phone interview with Jacob. Listen here. So much broken English! Anyhow, they talk a lot about the new record and it's a good listen.\n\nAfter finally completing their new album, Logh will be heading out on the road across Europe starting March 20. They're a great band, so be sure to check em out. The dates:\n\n3/20 - GER Hamburg, Prinzenbar (Docks)\n\n3/21 - GER Berlin, Magnet\n\n3/22 - GER Dresden, Starclub\n\n3/23 - GER Köln, Gebaedue 9\n\n3/26 - FRA Nantes, La route du rhum\n\n3/29 - ESP Madrid, Sala Moby Dick\n\n3/3 - CH Luzern, BOA\n\n4/4 - ITA Pinarella di Cervia, Rockplanet\n\n4/7 - A Wien, Szene Wien\n\n4/8 - GER Munich, Orange House\n\n4/9 - GER Wiesbaden, Schlachthof\n\n4/10 - GER Heidelberg, Schwimbad Musik Club\n\n4/14 - UK London, 93ft East\n\n4/15 - UK London, Club Fandango @ Dublin Castle\n\nLooks like there's even more to-do over that Haunted vs. Earache Records flap! Timo Isoaho of Kaista who did the original interview in Finnish has posted mp3s of the conversation proving that the report was indeed NOT a fabrication. Listen for yourself! (from Blabbermouth)\n\nmp3 #1: Includes Marco's (The Haunted's frontman) claim Earache told the band they sold only 1,000 CDs in the U.S.\n\nmp3 #2: Marco on the subject of \"Entombed vs. Earache\"\n\nmp3 #3: Marco talks about The Haunted having inherited At the Gates' old contract.\n\nmp3 #4: Marco talks about the \"Caught On Tape\" DVD\n\nLike I said before, complaints against Earache's business dealings are nothing new. I think it's a shame Marco isn't standing behind his words, especially since he was recorded.\n\nDarkane will be supporting Meshuggah on their upcoming Scandinavian tour. The dates:\n\n3/17 - Stockholm, SWE @ Göta Källare\n\n3/18 - Malmö, SWE @ Kulturbolaget\n\n3/19 - Göteborg, SWE @ Sticky Fingers\n\n3/20 - Oslo, NOR @ Betong\n\n3/21 - Gävle, SWE @ Nivå\n\n3/22 - Örebro, SWE @ Contan\n\n3/27 - Helsinki, FIN @ Nosturi\n\n3/29 - Umeå, SWE @ Umeå Open/Äpplet\n\nYou snooze, you lose. Kent's upcoming show at Stockholm Stadium on June 6 is sold out. All 32,500 tickets are gone.\n\nSigh. It was only a matter of time, but Virgin Records Sweden has contacted me and kindly asked me to remove the mp3s from their artists (Nicolai Dunger, Melody Club, Caesars Palace and The Ark). And I do mean kindly - no threats or anything, just a polite request. Maybe we'll work something in the future for authorized downloads, but until then there will be no more Virgin artists represented on the playlist. Kind of a pity since they are some of my favorites, but that's the way it goes.\n\nUPDATE: The nice people at Virgin are looking into working out an arrangement in the future. Nothing yet, but we'll see. As for now, get a preview of \"Who Will Buy These Wonderful Evils?\", the new 2xCD from Virgin/Dolores showcasing the label's past and present artists. It comes out February 24 and will be celebrated with a party at Club Debaser in Stockholm. Scheduled to appear and spin records are Ebbot from The Soundtrack of Our Lives, Jocke Åhlund from Caesars Palace, Reine Fiske from Dungen and more. Tickets go on sale on the 7th. Oh, and the tracklist for the album:\n\nCD1.\n\n01. Caesars Palace - Subhuman Girl\n\n02. Håkan Hellström - Fulaste Flickan I Världen\n\n03. Dungen - Horizon\n\n04. Alf - Mitt I Malmö City\n\n05. Grammar School Boys - Baby Blue\n\n06. Franke - Aldrig förstå\n\n07. Jose Gonzales - Dead Waits On Velveteen\n\n08. The Soundtrack Of Our Lives - Jehova Sunrise\n\n09.

Trolls - Alone\n\n17. The Deejays - Striped Dreams Checked Fear\n\nAnd on a similar note, increased traffic levels mean I need to cut back on the amount of music I have for download anyways. If someone else is willing to externally host the stuff, by all means, let me know. Otherwise, five tracks at a time going forward plus the usual live sets.\n\nBeyond Dawn reports that they've finally solidified a release for their new album \"Frysh\". Look for it in May from Peaceville.\n\nIn BD related news, side-project Wrongside has finished recording their debut MCD for a release in April on Duplicate Records. Described as \"a strange mix of noisy rock, playful electronica and lo-fi melancholy among other things,\" they say \"it should appeal to BD fans and probably a lot of other people as well.\" Preorder it now: duplicaterecords@hotmail.com.\n\nAlso from the BD camp, word is that Virus is nearly done with their debut album for Jester Records. Now tentively titled \"Carheart\" (as opposed to the original title \"The Drama Hour\") they describe it as \"outlandishly cool and mindbogglingly mindboggling.\" To me that describes most everything from Jester, but hey, check it out and decide for yourself.\n\nThe new Katatonia album has been finalized. It's called \"Viva Emptiness\" and you can preview the cover here. It'll be out on March 24 from Peaceville. The tracklist:\n\n01. Ghost of the Sun\n\n02. Sleep\n\n03. Criminals\n\n04.

(though some of my friend think these are happy songs. But their minds are fucked up anyway.)\" Kristofer also says he's looking forward to doing a new album and maybe a new EP this summer, but I think he'll probably be quite busy with Fireside in the near future.

Mainman Anders Wendin (ex-Monster) says that him and producer Jari Haapalainen (The Bear Quartet) have twelve tracks ready to go for a summer release. He's also got an all-star lineup for the backing band: Fredrik Sandsten (The Soundtrack of Our Lives), Magnus Öström (Esbjörn Svensson Trio, Nicolai Dunger's \"Soul Rush\"), Björn Yttling (Peter, Björn & John, live keyboards for Ceasars Palace), plus Monster's horn section (Viktor Brobacke, Gustav Bendt and Patrick Andersson). The music is decribed as a mix of soul, reggae, and punk - not far from the sound of his old band.\n\nSoviac reports they are finished with the second part of their new recording. They are working at Pelle Gunnerfeldt's Gröndal Studio with Johan Gustavsson (Randy) and Kalle Ohlsson (The Bear Quartet).\n\nThe new album from Crystal Committee is now available from Chalksounds and you can download the preview mp3s for \"So Sinister\" and the title track \"Forever Overhead\".

Is the return of new-wave nigh?\n\nDJ Embee (Loop Troop) is currently finishing up work on his new EP with Organism 12 and PSTQ. Four tracks and instruments, two produced by Embee, two by Breakmecanix.

It comes out on the 27th.\n\nHere's an interesting short interview with Galder of Old Man's Child and Dimmu Borgir.

As for what the footage will contain, here's what they had to say:\n\nFenriz and Nocturno Culto will film many hours at their stronghold somewhere in the wilderness in Norway. Like a reality-Darkthrone documentary. Every of the four album will contain at least 5 minutes of this rare piece of filming. They will drink, drink, listen to music, drink etc.....many things will be revealed. They will also interview eachother about all the Peaceville-albums. They will film that much, so it can edited to be a 30 min. documentary\n\nNorthSide Records has new preview mp3s up on their website for upcoming releases from Värttinä and Mari Boine. Check 'em out. (scroll about 2/3rds of the way down the page)\n\nClassic Swedish deathmetal band Dismember is currently working on their next album. The title is \"Where Ironcrosses Grow\" and it's due out around September on Hammerheart Records. Produced once again by drummer Fred Estby with help from engineer Olle Sandqvist, the new material is described as \"darker, a little less melodic and more aggressive than ever\" and lyrically \"headed even more in the direction of describing war at its ugliest, stories about sick minds creating sick situations and loads of religious criticism.\" In other words, business as usual.\n\nA number of Swedish artists will be coming together on February 20 at Club Debaser in Stockholm to honor the memory of Joe Strummer from The Clash. The list of names is long, but here they are: Infinite Mass, Weeping Willows, Thåström, Randy with Howlin Pelle (The Hives), Ian and Ebbot from Sountrack Of Our Lives, Joppe Pihlgren, Nomads, Dregen & Nicke Borg (Backyard Babies), Jocke Åhlund (Caesars Palace, Teddybears STHLM), Eggstone and Brända Barn.

There's a decent video clip posted, too. (in Swedish)\n\nTurns out the info yesterday about The Ark's trip to Belguim was false. Members Ola and Sylvester are actually spending today on a press mission in Amersterdam.\n\nHere's the top 20 Swedish albums of the week, as reported by Aftonbladet:\n\n01. The Sounds - Living in America\n\n02. Kent - Vapen & ammunition\n\n03. Melody Club - Music machine\n\n04. Barbados - Rewind\n\n05. v/a - Fame factory vol 2\n\n06. Robyn - Don´t stop the music\n\n07.

(tack Niklas!)\n\nNorweigan singer/songwriter St. Thomas recently finished up with his recording session in Nashville for his next album. Mark Nevers (Lambchop, Will Oldham) produced 22 songs were completed, including covers of \"Don't Believe In A Mushroom\" by Ring and \"Who'll Stop The Rain\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. And that's not all - quite a group of illustrious guests will appear on the album, too:\n\nTony Crow (Lambchop)\n\nMatt Swanson (Lambchop)\n\nJeremy Barnes (Neutral Milk Hotel and Bablicon)\n\nHowe Gelb (Giant Sand)\n\nEspen Mellingen (Ai Phoenix and Poor Rich Ones)\n\nBosse Litzheim (Ai Phoenix)\n\nFive of those tracks ended up the on just-released EP \"A Long Long Time\". Listen for the title-track single on Norway P3 Radio. A video will be coming out soon, too.\n\nFinally got some new CDs in the mail yesterday. That means a new mp3 to your right. Huzzah!\n\nI'm excited because I just got word that KVLR will be heading to the States in March for a West Coast tour. I'll post the dates when I get them.\n\nOkay, I'm a moron. The new Randy album was produced by (the stellar) Pelle Gunnerfeldt (Fireside), except for one track which was produced by Jocke Åhlund of Caesars Palace. Sorry about my slip-up. Anyhow, I'm still very excited to hear it. It's getting mastered on Monday the 27th and the artwork by Henke Walse gets proofed today. Henke did the cover of the last record, too.\n\nAnd speaking of Pelle Gunnerfeldt, Entombed are currently hard at work in the studio under his direction for a new album due in spring on their own Threeman Recordings. The basic tracks were done at a different studio, but Pelle is handling the vocals and the mix. As I've said before, I love his work, so I'm very interested to hear how this will come out.\n\nThe (Int'l) Noise Conspiracy frontman Dennis is starting work on the next Lost Patrol album. No info on the label or date yet. As for the rest of t(I)NC, they will all be in LA in February to rehearse the new album. Come March, it's back to Sweden for a regrouping and then into the studio around May or June.\n\nHere's a stream of The Soundtrack of Our Lives playing on the David Letterman show. (Real Player)\n\nHere's some new dates for Nicolai Dunger! Finally, I'll be able to see him play.\n\nEurope\n\n1/23 - Dieppe (F) Scéne nationale de Dieppe\n\n1/24 - Colmar (F) Le Kraken\n\n1/25 - Belfort (F) La Poudriére\n\n1/26 - TBA\n\n1/27 - Bern (CH) ISC\n\n1/28 - Bruxelles (B) Le Botanique (w/Mary Timmony)\n\n1/29 - Paris (F) Mains d'oeuvres\n\n1/30 - Nantes (F) L'Olympic\n\n1/31 - Evreux (F) MJC A I'Abordage\n\n2/01 - Lilles (F) Le Grand Mix\n\nI put up a track from Melody Club today. I think they're kinda cheesy, but maybe you'll like 'em. They got that retro 80s thing going on, kinda like The Faint maybe, except without the edge.\n\nI saw that Smirnoff Ice commercial that uses \"Kick You Out\" from Caesars Palace/The Caesars last night. A quick Google search shows that message boards are already buzzing about the song. Anyhow, you can view it for yourself. (Low bandwidth version here, both require Real Player)\n\nThe upcoming album from Enslaved will be called \"Below the Lights\". It'll include 8 songs and should be out around March. In other news, drummer Dirge Rep has reportedly left the band to concentrate on his project Orcustus, featuring members of Gorgoroth, Borknagar, and Desekrator.\n\nNRK's favorite Norweigan records of the year:\n\n1. Jaga Jazzist - \"The Stix\"\n\n2. Thomas Dybdahl – \"The Great October Sound\"\n\n3. Gåte - \"Jygri\"\n\n4. Madrugada – \"Grit\"\n\n5. Bjørn Eidsvåg – \"Tålt\"\n\n6. a-ha – \"Lifelines\"\n\n7. The Margarets – \"What Kept You?\"\n\n8. Vamp - \"Månemannen\"\n\n9. Ugress – \"Resound\"\n\nCheck out some of the latest videos from these Burning Heart arists: Millencolin, Division of Laura Lee, Looptroop, and Bombshell Rocks.\n\nWondering what your favorite Swedish artists favorite records of the year are? Aftonbladet has the scoop. Some of the queried people are Magnus Carlson (Weeping Willows), Howlin’ Pelle Almqvist (The Hives), Maria Andersson (Sahara Hotnights), Håkan Hellström, Nicolai Dunger and more. (In Swedish, but not hard to figure out)\n\nCheck out some videos from Kent, The (International) Noise Conspiracy, Håkan Hellström and more at this year end wrap-up article from MTVE.com. There's a couple paragraphs on the success and current state of Scandinavian music towards the end on page two.\n\nThe USCB Allstars will be releasing a new album next spring entitled “I Can't Believe It’s Not Music\".\n\nTo clarify - KVLR's new CD \"On Planted Streets\" will contain the debut album \"Let Me Worry Some More\", the follow-up EP \"Deadly Dozen\" and one unreleased track. All good stuff, so if you don't have those releases already, this is a great way to get it all in one fell swoop.\n\nCadavar Inc.'s new album will be called \"Necrosis\". Look for it around springtime on Earache records.\n\nVintersorg's new album will be called \"The Focusing Blur\". It comes out sometime next year on Napalm Records. Here's what Vintersorg himself had to say about the music:\n\n\"The next album is going to have the format of a concept/theme album, a story running through the albums entirety, and with a musical flow that includes small compositions between the 'real' songs. The music takes off from 'Visions From The Spiral Generator' (the previous record) and twists and turns through a vast genre spectra (as always with Vintersorg). From mellow prog to extreme metal, to ambient and folky vibes, spiced with a lot of effective contrasts, changing directories but united under a solid musical kingdom.\" (from Blabbermouth)\n\nThere just doesn't seem to be much of anything going on today. Hope your holiday was a good one. As a special treat, I put up a new Nicolai Dunger mp3 for y'all. It's from \"Tranquil Isolation\", the album he did with Will Oldham. It's not my favorite album of his, but a few of the tracks are really great. This one's an instrumental and seasonably appropriate.\n\nThe details for P3 Popstad in February have been announced. Read more here or here (in Swedish). Some of the band playing include The Ark, Looptroop, Melody Club, Dub Sweden, The Sounds, The Haunted, Marit Bergman and Awa Manneh.\n\nRecording for the new Fireside album is still coming along. Kristofer Åström reports the band just spent some time in the Silence studio this past weekend. A mid-April release date is the plan.\n\nBefore he heads out on tour, Nicolai Dunger will be continuing his pre-production work on his new album with the guys from Mercury Rev up in Kingston, NY. And also, I neglected to find out his backing band on said tour. It's gonna be Thomas Tjärnkvist, Johan Berthling, Jari Haapalainen (Bear Quartet), Jonas Kullhammar and Kjell-Erik Eriksson. Again, full dates are here.\n\nAfter having various members experiment with solo projects such as A-Camp and Righteous Boy, The Cardigans are finally gonna have a new record out. \"Long Gone Before Sunlight\" is the title and it will feature guest appearances from Howlin´ Pelle Almqvist (The Hives), Ebbot Lundberg (The Soundtrack of Our Lives) and Nick Royale (The Hellacopters). Look for it in stores on March 24. The first single will be \"For What It's Worth\" and you'll be seeing that on February 17. For even more detail, read this interview with Nina Persson from MTVE.com.\n\nE-Type to go heavy metal? Apparently so. Blabbermouth reports that E-Type mainman Martin Eriksson is indeed taking his music in a heavier direction for his upcoming tour. I had no idea, but I guess Martin used to drum for Hexenhaus way back when, but will not be behind the kit of course. That duty will be going to Motörhead drummer Mikkey Dee.\n\nIn celebration of Bathory's 20 year anniversary, Black Mark Records will be remastering and reissuing all of his albums on vinyl with enhanced layouts and full lyric sheets.\n\nSome general housekeeping: I updated the About page. Not quite a FAQ, but just some issues I wanted to address.\n\nThe Soundtrack of Our Lives just keep racking up accolades from all over the place. Most recently, \"Behind the Music\" was named Entertainment Weekly's #2 album of the year:\n\nAs their name implies, these Swedish rockers are all about distilling the essence of their fave art-rock, psychedelic, folk, and punk bands into a bold, tuneful brew. You'll hear echoes of the Kinks, the Beatles, Love, and Pink Floyd here. But what's really exciting is that Soundtrack may be the first group in ages that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as its idols.\n\nAnd that's not all! TSOOL also made Empyre Lounge's top 50 at #47:\n\nA Swedish rock group taking the States by storm? No not those Swedes, The Soundtrack Of Our Lives is the second Swedish rock export that put out a killer disc this year. With more pop sense than their Swedish brethren The Hives, TSOOL have put together an impressive display of glam guitars and keyboards, with some psychedelic vibes mixed in.\n\nAnd yes, The Hives get honored there too, coming in at #17:\n\nAnother one of the discs that doesn't really belong here since it is a couple years old but this it he first year the Hives have been in the mainstream. Frontman Howlin' Pelle Almqvist owes all his moves to Mick Jagger but the music is more like good ole Americans, the Stooges, and the MC5. Just under a half hour, Veni Vidi Vicious is the perfect shot in the ass that music needed this year.\n\nThe First Time Records put up a couple mp3s on their website. There isn't much else there as the new site isn't finished (how long has it been in the works guys?), but TFT is the label that put out Kevlar, Cobolt (ex-Refused) and a number of other groups in the States.\n\nSee the video for \"Oh Night\" from Christian Kjellvander right here: 56 / 100 / 300 (Windows Media)\n\nNicolai Dunger will be coming back to the US to play 2 shows at the Sundance Film Fest in Utah on January 17 & 18. After that, it's back to Europe. Dates are here.\n\nDrummer Martin Svensson has left the Satanic Surfers. The band is currently taking a break after a long tour, but will resume work on new material shortly.\n\nIf you can, be sure to catch Hederos & Hellberg at one of the duo's final concerts.

My goodness! Read on...\n\nBjörn Olsson will NOT be participating in the upcoming Union Carbide Productions reunion at Hultsfred. \"Sure, it might be fun to play, but it's more fun not to play.\" says the man himself in this interview. (in Swedish) Of course, this may be subject to change. You never know. Also, the boxset is now expected around mid-May, but still no exact date has been set. And lastly, I just my hands on a copy of \"UPA\" and will try to put up a track a bit later today. Full review next week at the latest. Check back, y'hear?\n\nIn somewhat related news, TSOOL's latest album \"Behind the Music\" made GQ Magazine's top 10 of the year. What they said:\n\nCranking guitars and clean, poppish melodies make you think of 1960s British bands, but this time it's the Scandanavian Invasion. Will Norrkoping or Malmö be the next Manchester?\n\nCheck out the video for \"By the Grace of God\" from The Hellacopters, courtesy of NME.\n\nThe finalists for Rockbjörnen have been announced!

The artist's own description of his work: \"Brown Ring of Fury is the sound of growing up in the suburbs west of Norway’s capital. 1349 Rykkinn. The sound of glue and magic mushrooms. Ghettoblasters. Daddy drowning in his own vomit. Amphetamines. Fireworks. The sound of getting laid for first time. Of filming one’s first orgasm. My life. A tribute to blowing oneself up. For to repent till tears gush forth. Again and again. An anaesthetic circle.\"\n\nPorcupine Tree mastermind Steven Wilson says the inspiration for his band's latest album came from the Swedish metal bands Meshuggah and Opeth. Of course, he did produce Opeth's last couple records, but anyhow - here's what he had to say on the subject:\n\nFor years I had dismissed metal as music for adolescents, which a lot of people do, because I was only exposed to the stuff that is in the mainstream. And then suddenly I tapped into this whole group of bands from the underground. Actually, it's because I read a book called 'Lords Of Chaos', because I was fascinated with this guy from Burzum, that led me into the whole world. So I started listening to bands like Morbid Angel, some of the doom bands and eventually found my way to Meshuggah and Opeth, which to me, were the holy grail of that whole scene. I suddenly realized where all the musicians that were making truly progressive music had gone. They weren't making old-style progressive music, they were making a completely contemporary form of progressive music by using metal as their kind of conduit, if you like. I mean, Mike from Opeth is completely into progressive rock. But he's not doing it in a nostalgic way, he's doing it in a completely cutting edge contemporary way, using metal as his vehicle. And he loves metal just as much as anything, and so do I. And that was kind of a real eye-opener for me, to find musicians who are obviously very much coming from the tradition of the way people made records in the '70s, but doing it in a completely new and contemporary way and with musicianship that I just didn't think existed anymore.\n\nAmorphis has completed the recording of the instrumental parts for their new album. Frontman Pasi Koskinen will begin working on his parts under the tutelage of producer Hannu Leiden shortly."
