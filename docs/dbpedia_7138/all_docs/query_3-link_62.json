        "text": "Dashboard Confessional have released a video for their new single Burning Heart, taken from their upcoming album All The Truth That I Can Tell.\n\nThe track was written in a green room in Manchester, England back in 2018 and founder, frontman and songwriter Chris Carrabba explains: “In the song, there’s this sense of, Okay, here we go! Are you ready? Because it’s starting! This was the first one I wrote for the new album and it’s the one outlier of the bunch. That night, I wrote a song that I was so certain of. Not that it was just good, but that it was powerful in some way, too.” He continues: “The conceit of this song reflects the fact that I’m holding in a lot. I have a lot to say to the person I love in this moment. The idea in this setting is that I’m here to fight for this. I wanted a song that took a look at a hard conversation with a sense of although things aren’t right now, they may be able to be set right if it’s needed badly enough, wanted badly enough. In this setting, the conceit of the song is between two people in a relationship — well, you only hear one side. That’s the bigger part of the conceit: what if you only heard the one side of the conversation?”\n\nCheck out the video for Burning Heart below.\n\nLike what you hear?
