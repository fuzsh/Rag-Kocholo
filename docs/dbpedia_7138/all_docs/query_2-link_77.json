Features specially written liner notes and re-worked layout. HIGHLY ANTICIPATED!! Official release sanctioned by the band & Shivadarshana Records. (Hells Headbangers #60)\n\nABOMINATOR - Evil Proclaimed CD\n\nAt long last, legendary black/death heretics ABOMINATOR return from suspended animation with their highly anticipated comeback album, Evil Proclaimed. After eight years in the abyss, the core creative duo of drummer/vocalist Chris Volcano and guitarist Andrew Undertaker - both longtime veterans of the deadly Australian metal scene - have reignited the hellfire, having learned their lessons well from a devilish hiatus, and thusly deliver a demonic slab of black/death metal carnage. Aptly titled, Evil Proclaimed is ABOMINATOR's fifth album to date, and their first album for HELLS HEADBANGERS. Here, these Oz barbarians range their entire discography, the filth 'n' fury of their earliest days well accounted for whilst showing a nuanced sense of dynamics not heard on their previous albums. The attack's not unlike a heat-seeking missile: stealthy, insistent, focused, FAST...and death imminent. With a history that stretches back more than 20 years now, ABOMINATOR display no signs of softening nor compromise; if anything, they're more committed than ever to harnessing the powers of chaos and unleashing them back as a maelstrom of blackened Metal of Death. Rounded off by the band's best, burliest production ever, Evil Proclaimed is the victorious return everyone's been awaiting of ABOMINATOR. Onward they march... (Hell's Headbangers Records #149 CD)\n\nABYSMAL LORD - Storms Of Unholy Black Mass LP\n\nAlways on the lookout for the foulest, filthiest sounds in the metal underground, HELLS HEADBANGERS is proud to unleash the debut EP from Louisiana black/death barbarians ABYSMAL LORD, Storms of Unholy Black Mass! Ever-accurately titled, Storms of Unholy Black Mass is a pounding, pulsing torrent of bestial frequencies, vomit vox, and nuclear explosions of noise. ABYSMAL LORD, however, are not your regular identikit \"bestial/goat metal\" band, as they summon storms of filth 'n' fury firmly rooted in classic grindcore; meanwhile, their lead-guitar detonations suggest an understanding of agitated music outside of metal. At nearly 26 minutes, Storms of Unholy Black Mass is the perfect length to do the maximum cranial/spiritual damage, and is a lethal introduction to the black hole that is ABYSMAL LORD. (Hell's Headbangers Records #28)\n\nACID WITCH - Midnight Movies CD\n\nJust in time for a big European tour, ACID WITCH deliver a special 12\" MLP that pays horrific homage to their roots: Midnight Movies! Already one of the cultest names in the metal underground, the diabolical ACID WITCH dig deeper into the cult with four exclusive covers of heavy metal songs from 1980s horror movies! Sorcery's \"I'm Back\" from Rocktober Blood, Fastway's \"After Midnight\" from Trick or Treat, Black Roses' \"Soldiers of the Night\" from Black Roses, and 45 Grave's \"Partytime\" from The Return of the Living Dead - all get ACID WITCH's signature ghoulish touch, and it's the touch of true horror! You're never gonna find a more perfect combination than here on Midnight Movies! (Hell's Headbangers Records #154 CD)\n\nACID WITCH - Stoned CD\n\nMulti-panel fold-out CD booklet features lyrics & band photos. Detroit's most evil doom band raises hell this Halloween with one of the heaviest, crushing albums ever made! Mixing 70's psych, NWOBHM, 80's doom metal, crust, and death, this album is sure to possess even the holiest by the power of weed, spell and Satanism! Expect no typical doom metal here eerie listeners, this album isn't just a bunch of recycled Black Sabbath riffs, Acid Witch have crafted their own sound that sounds like no other band now or from the past. Their influences melt together like wax from black candles on an age-old satanic ritual. The production is warm and heavy, yet raw and filthy. All lyrics, art, layout, writing & recording was done by the band themselves, bringing back a punk D.I.Y. attitude the underground is missing nowadays. The Witch is back, and its time to get STONED! Recommended for worshippers of Witchfinder General, Trouble, Deep Purple and Winter. (Hells Headbangers #58 CD)\n\nACID WITCH - Witchtanic Hellucinations CD\n\nWhen ACID WITCH's \"Witchtanic Hellucinations\" came out in 2008 on Razorback Records, metal fans were floored by the creative mash of death metal, doom, horror soundtrack, and NWOBHM. The diabolical duo crafted a signature sound that reeks of old, rotten treats on Halloween night, therefore appropriately dubbing this style of music \"HALLOWEEN METAL\"! This album is a thick, heavy cauldron of psychedelic surprises and drug-induced HORROR! To meet the demand for this modern classic, Hells Headbangers stepped in to do the honors - maybe your Halloween won't turn out to be the \"happy\" one you were expecting...hahahaha!!! (Hell's Headbangers #93 CD)\n\nAEVANGELIST - Writhes In The Murky CD\n\nThe American band's third album to date, Writhes in the Murk signifies the next phase in the existence of Aevangelist's approach to experimental and extreme dark music. Falling somewhere within, but never fully defined by, the current boundaries of death metal, black metal, dark ambient, industrial, power violence, and black noise with a heavy influence from choral music, jazz textures, and new age sensibilities, Writhes in the Murk is a musically diverse downward spiral of nightmare and horrifying bliss. Through Aevangelist, beauty and transcendence are brought together in the absolute; the corridors of the heart which lead to the eternal vistas of the nether have granted you with access, and then all of life will be abandoned, left writhing in the murk. The keepers of the Great Secret, the sovereign silent ministry of Aevangelist: they sustain the shadow with anticipation for when the sun would fall from the sky into exile, and through divination, they acclaim mastery over all disbelievers, until their return to bestow the equation for utopia and restore the earth to prosperity and Omniquity for all time. Hear all this - and far, FAR more - within Aevangelist's Writhes in the Murk, which is currently being streamed at Zero Tolerance magazine's website. Licensed for North American release by France's elite Debemur Morti Productions. (Hell's Headbangers Records #142 CD)\n\nAPOKALYPTIC RAIDS - Only Death Is Real... LP (gatefold)\n\nAt long last, HELLS HEADBANGERS re-issues on vinyl an underground classic so fitting of the format: APOKALYPTIC RAIDS' Only Death is Real... debut full-length. From their moniker and iconography on down to their galloping, gut-busting thrust, Brazil's APOKALYPTIC RAIDS are the ultimate in Hellhammer/Celtic Frost worship. Raw, rabid, and unrepentant, their sound on Only Death is Real... is squarely between the namesake MLP by Hellhammer and Celtic Frost's eternal Morbid Tales. However, APOKALYPTIC RAIDS' old-school attack is not meant as a rip-off; rather, it is a reverential homage to a classic era and two classic bands, done with a thorough understanding of these ancient metal masters. Although originally released in 2001, it could've just as easily come out in 1985. Now, courtesy of HELLS HEADBANGERS, return to the darkest past and realize that Only Death is Real...! (Hell's Headbangers Records #116)\n\nATOMIC AGGRESSOR - Sights of Suffering CD\n\nAt long last, cult Chilean legends ATOMIC AGGRESSOR make their full-length debut, the ominously titled Sights of Suffering! At ground zero of Chile's still-thriving death metal scene, ATOMIC AGGRESSOR had a strong hand in shaping that supreme sound back in the late '80s with 1989's influential Bloody Ceremonial demo and 1991's subsequent Resurrection demo. Prematurely, the band broke up but re-formed in 2007 to play a number of national festivals, proving that the ancient hellfire still burned brightly. With two founding members at the helm, vocalist/bassist Alejandro Diaz and guitarist Enrique Zuniga, ATOMIC AGGRESSOR released a well-received split 7\" with Death Yell in 2013, further proving that their barbaric deathrash had lost none of its violence & force. If that split was a mere appetizer, then Sights of Suffering is the grand feast of diabolic DEATH! Buttressed by raw-yet-rounded production, Sights of Suffering explodes with the sort of songwriting only those who grew up - and bled - in the 1980s can produce. In fact, one could safely say that ATOMIC AGGRESSOR are simply continuing where they started in the late '80s, but Sights of Suffering is no mere \"throwback\" - it is the real deal, a timeless, iron-fisted thrust of pure death metal evil. Open your eyes to Sights of Suffering... (Hell's Headbangers Records #132 CD)\n\nATOMIC AGGRESSOR - Sights Of Suffering LPx2 (gatefold)\n\nIncludes an exclusive vinyl-only BONUS TRACK, \"Twilight Spectres.\" Comes in a gatefold jacket with printed inner sleeves.

A prolific force on the split-release front, Straight Metal War is BARBATOS' fifth album to date in 17 years of existence, and their first for HELLS HEADBANGERS. Helmed by Abigail mainman Yasuyuki, BARBATOS have become cult legends in the metal underground with their uniquely filthy 'n' sleazy brand of blackened heavy metal/punk. Possessed by sex, drinks, and metal, Yasuyuki here extols the virtues of high school girls and heavy metal forces, Witching Metal and Tokyo rock 'n' roll shows, Satanik Holocausts and of course the very real Straight Metal War. It's a dozen dirty songs that are immediately memorable, remarkably varied, and whose dirtiness simply won't wash off. Stock up on ammo and enter the Straight Metal War with BARBATOS! (Hell's Headbangers Records #150 CD)\n\nBAT - Cruel Discipline 7\"\n\nAll copies of the 7\" EP come with a free download card. Features a brand new studio track & a studio recording of \"Rule of the Beast\" from their debut demo. In anticipation for their forthcoming debut album on HELLS HEADBANGERS, the unholy BAT unleash a scorching slab of 7\" vinyl, Cruel Discipline. Featuring two exclusive songs, Cruel Discipline lays bare BAT's raison d'etre: crude 'n' rude speed metal wreckage, with an extra helping of sleaze. In fact, both songs - the title track and its flipside, \"Rule of the Beast\" - spell out the power-trio's philosophy in no uncertain terms, and then grinds posers into the ground. Which is not surprising, considering BAT comprises metal lifers, their impressive lineup featuring ex-DRI drummer Felix Griffin, Municipal Waste's Ryan Waste on vocals and bass, and Volture's Nick Poulos on guitar. Beware of the BAT and obey their Cruel Discipline! (Hell's Headbangers Records #P078)\n\nBEHERIT - At The Devil's Studio 1990 CD\n\nThe VERY FIRST Beherit debut studio album recorded back in 1990! You NEVER HEARD this recording or the two previously UNRELEASED tracks featured! Finally unearthed from Sodomatic Slaughter's personal collection after being lost for the last 20 years. Recorded as a duo by Nuclear Holocausto Vengeance and Sodomatic Slaughter in Ala Ky Studio and mastered in 2010 by Joona Lukala. (Hells Headbangers Records #71)\n\nBESTIAL MOCKERY - Christcrushing Hammerchainsaw LP\n\nColored Vinyl, glossy gatefold cover, heavy printed inner sleeve, 18\" x 24\" poster. Their long out-of-print debut album (often regarded as their finest effort), now available again. Unpure, unholy, untight buzzing chainsaw guitars thrashing ugly punkish black metal riffs backed by mental vocals screaming rants of war, hate, blasphemy and Satan. Features new artwork (in color) by Chris Moyen. FOR DIE HARDS OF: Nifelheim, Gospel of the Horns, Venom, NunSlaughter. (Hells Headbanger Records #42)\n\nBESTIAL MOCKERY - Slaying The Life LP\n\nSwedens BESTIAL MOCKERY stands for the ultimate downfall of humanity in all its forms, the mockery of everything sacred and holy. Un-political and purely satanic, evil is everywhere and Black Metal is Satan\"s hand! \"Slaying the Life\", the band\"s brand new full length platter.. Thrashingly evil, bleaker than black and 666% METAL! Bestial Mockery wage musical war on YOU! Comes with a nice fold-out insert with huge photo collage and lyrics. (Hells Headbanger Records #23)\n\nBESTIAL WARLUST - Satan's Fist LP/CD\n\nUnearthed from the vault, one of the rarest entries in the BESTIAL WARLUST canon: Satan's Fist - Demo 1996, the legendary band's final longer-form recording. With K.K. Warslut having gone on to DESTROYER666 and Damon Bloodstorm to ABOMINATOR, the pared-down BESTIAL WARLUST were at a crucial juncture in 1996, with Skullfucker on vocals/guitars and Hellcunt on drums. Between the two of them, however, the three songs they'd record for Satan's Fist - essentially, their 1996 demo - sound just as potent as anything on their two classic, influential full-lengths. Here, the bestial black metal they helped pioneer is tempered with a sort of gritty epicness, displaying both where BESTIAL WARLUST were coming from and, more so, where they could have gone. But with a track on a four-way split to follow a year later, the lid would then be sealed on BESTIAL WARLUST's coffin...until now! To be released on a limited-edition CD and 12\" vinyl mastered at 45 RPM and with laser-etched B-side: feel Satan's Fist! (Hells Headbangers #84 CD/#25 LP)\n\nBLACK JESUS - Black Jesus Saves LP\n\nOnly 300 copies pressed. Comes with a lyrics sheet printed on textured red cardstock. Originally recorded in gritty analog in 2010 and released earlier this year on CD by TRENCH HELL's The Coffins Slave label, BLACK JESUS' debut Black Jesus Saves demo is being damned to black gold - 12\" vinyl, that is! Much like their Australian forebears, BLACK JESUS favor the filthy 'n' headbanging side of heavy metal, but also nod to '80s gods like REPULSION, AUTOPSY & NIHILIST: get in, get out, desecrate! Black Jesus Saves is unholy, grinding Metal of Death from the grave which only the Australian outback can create - welcome your salvation, down on your knees! (Hells Headbangers Records #24)\n\nBLACK WITCHERY - Inferno Of Sacred Destruction CD (comes with DVD)\n\nComes with a 20 page booklet featuring artwork for each track and a live DVD in Helsinki with multi-angle footage & soundboard audio. This HHR pressing is the exact same as the Osmose Productions European pressing. In 2001, BLACK WITCHERY decimated an unsuspecting scene with their \"Desecration of the Holy Kingdom\" debut. Four years later came another strategic strike against the weak 'n' false with \"Upheaval of Satanic Might.\" Now, as anticipation reaches a fever pitch, BLACK WITCHERY return to claim their crown as the unrivalled masters of unrepentantly barbaric blackdeath with \"Inferno of Sacred Destruction.\" More caustic, close-minded, and crushing than ever, this unholy black/death speed trinity create an unholy conflagration guaranteed to devour and destroy even the most battle-hardened underground warrior - witness the \"Inferno of Sacred Destruction\"! Recommended for maniacs of BLASPHEMY, ARCHGOAT, REVENGE. (Hells Headbangers Records #61 CD)\n\nCEMETERY LUST - Orgies Of Abomination LP\n\nOne of HELLS HEADBANGERS latest unearthings from metal's dirtiest underground, CEMETERY LUST present their highly anticipated debut for the label, Orgies of Abomination. Following on from their cult debut Screams of the Violated, soon to be reissued by HELLS HEADBANGERS, Orgies of Abomination sees these Portland sleaze-bangers perfecting their vile, violent craft. Fittingly titled, Orgies of Abomination is a veritable smorgasbord of lyrical depravity, ably backed up by filthy, feral thrash metal that equally nods to '80s German proto-black, San Francisco speed metal, and even South American proto-death, all done with devilish glee. These songs stick in your head, and then CEMETERY LUST explodes right out of it, cremating all party-thrash pretenders. Right from the beginning until the bloody end, CEMETERY LUST demand you partake in Orgies of Abomination!

Very aptly titled, Choronzonic Chaos Gods is a veritable vortex of chaos magick executed with military precision. CENTURIAN at this stage could accurately be described as \"death metal,\" but the ever-cyclonic, ever-coiling whirlwinds unleashed by the band take on a form more supernatural than physical. As such, CENTURIAN's debut album found much favor with the black metal faithful at the time, as well as those who held hope for a flagging death metal scene; not for nothing was it released by the esteemed Full Moon Productions label. Now, HELLS HEADBANGERS unleashes Choronzonic Chaos Gods, out of print for years, on CD and, for the first time ever, vinyl LP. Reap the whirlwind!

Very aptly titled, CENTURIAN's introduction to the world is a veritable conflagration of occult energy and seared-black death metal battery. Although the band would find acclaim in the metal scene with their subsequent debut album, Choronzonic Chaos Gods, it was here with Of Purest Fire where CENTURIAN were at their rawest and most hungry, not to mention their most blackened, with cult covers of early Morbid Angel and Inquisitor underlinining this point in no uncertain terms; not for nothing was it later released on CD by the esteemed Full Moon Productions label.

Defying the trends of time, CEREKLOTH are a band capturing their own timeless death metal sound on In the Midst of Life We are in Death. Neither \"old school\" nor \"modern\" but never riding any fence, CEREKLOTH put the emphasis on what truly makes death metal what it is - DARKNESS and especially DEATH - built upon a backbone of bulldozing riffs and deceptively twisted/twisting song structures. With disharmonic moods and eerie melodies to remember, In the Midst of Life We are in Death tells the twisted tales of true death from the most bitter and forlorn perspective, some even inspired by first-hand real-life experiences...dare you enter the crypt? Into the grave, and prepare for THE END.

(Hells Headbangers Records #99)\n\nCHILDREN OF TECHNOLOGY - Future Decay CD\n\nBusy out cruising the post-apocalyptic wasteland, Italian speed metalpunks CHILDREN OF TECHNOLOGY are back with their highly anticipated second album, Future Decay. Four long years after their cult-classic It's Time to Face the Doomsday debut, the shit-hot CHILDREN OF TECHNOLOGY here crank up everything that made that record so special to so many listeners worldwide: more metal, more punk, more darkness, more fun, more crushing production, more crazed performances, more of MORE. Literally, everything on Future Decay is turned up to \"11,\" and then beyond! It's often been said that CHILDREN OF TECHNOLOGY are the metalpunk analogue of the Mad Max films. With Future Decay, however, they mainline into musical form every cult '80s movie to feature bikers, zombies, and zombie bikers and set them across a bleak, bombed-out landscape that's their own choosing rather than one that's already been created. And with it, CHILDREN OF TECHNOLOGY paint a portrait of Future Decay... (Hell's Headbangers Records #122)\n\nCIANIDE - Gods of Death CD\n\nFormed in 1988, CIANIDE's vision was to create the heaviest Death Metal in existence... and they DID! Their 6th full-length album is yet another classic under their bullet belts! Expect no frills and no bullshit, only a continuation of the death, doom & destruction maniacs have come to expect over the last 20+ years! This Metal NEVER bends motherfuckers and always remember, CIANIDE KILLS!!!! (Hells Headbangers Records #70)\n\nCRUCIFIED MORTALS - Crucified Mortals CD/LP (gatefold with poster)\n\nGet ready to be hit in the face with an iron fist of thrash metal insanity... after ten years of several EP and demo outputs, Crucified Mortals release their first full-length album. Comprised of eleven horror tales transcribed into metallic hymns the album continues the bands' own appalling sound with arguably their best material to date. A truly unique style of well-played and evil fucking thrash with hints of death metal that showcases a diverse range sure to satisfy the ear's craving for speed, heavy and memorable riffing complimented with harsh angry vocals and pounding drums. Hammer the nails & thrash 'til fucking death! RECOMMENDED FOR DIE HARDS OF: Hobbs' Angel Of Death, Rigor Mortis (Texas), Deceased & Carnivore.

Keeping the faith, CRUCIFIED MORTALS and EXORCISM team up for a quick-hitting split 7\". Following on from their self-titled debut album on HELLS HEADBANGERS in 2011, Cleveland nasties CRUCIFIED MORTALS deliver two of their strongest & meanest tracks yet - exclusive to this release, a hard-charging tank of pure mid-'80s metal darkness! And speaking of darkness, Germany's cellar-dwellers EXORCISM deliver two tracks of rotten, red-eyed death metal as if the '80s never ended - also exclusive to this split! Features killer artwork from Mark Riddick in a folding cover - all copies pressed on ultra-clear vinyl with a heavy black splatter! (Hell's Headbanger's Records #65)\n\nCULTES DES GHOULES - Henbane CD\n\nArcane rituals, medieval devil worship, black blood spilling forth, screams from the abyss both nameless and numerous...CULTES DES GHOULES unleash their second full-length spell, Henbane. Five years on from their classic debut album, Haxan, the mysterious Polish cult take the sulphurous, swilring gnarliness they've plied on their splits in the interim - and particuarly on the preceding Spectres Over Transylvania MLP - and drag it deeper into the eldritch depths. Both more compositionally advanced and more primitive than all previous, vocals ranging throats both ghoulish and diseased, and still with the most overpowering, bass-driven sound around: CULTES DES GHOULES make their grandest, most garish statement yet with the epic Henbane. Listening to this just once, you'll be damned for all eternity... (Hells Headbangers Records #101)\n\nDEATHHAMMER - Evil Power CD\n\nThe third strike is deadly: DEATHHAMMER are back with the massively anticipated Evil Power. An iron-fisted statement of intent in both title and execution, Evil Power proves that this Norwegian duo continue to get better with age, retaining their original youthful enthusiasm which endeared Onward to the Pits to so many the world over whilst pushing their songwriting toward more mature but no-less-deadly ends. Once again, DEATHHAMMER are firmly committed to their blackthrashing metal here, storming with vengeance as if 1985 never ended, braving nuclear winter and eternal devastation, but make no mistake: Evil Power is no repeat of past glories. Like those eternal bands who find a special sound and continue to expand it without losing their identity, DEATHHAMMER render Evil Power a rollicking ride through past, present, and future, at once rawer and more refined, more manic and also more measured - but always, always VERY METAL. Because when all is said and done, Evil Power will always prevail! (Hell's Headbangers Records #140 CD)\n\nDEATHHAMMER - Onward To The Pits CD\n\nForget trendy \"party thrash\" - DEATHHAMMER are here to annihilate posers with their highly anticipated second album, \"Onward to the Pits.\" A cult name in the underground, the Norwegian duo of DEATHHAMMER skillfully honor the ancient masters with a blackened thrash attack replete divebombing leads and piercing screams and wails from the abyss. With dark and dynamic songwriting that memorably moves between blitzing surge and locomotive pulse, DEATHHAMMER will take you \"Onward to the Pits\"! Recommended for diehards of early SODOM, early KREATOR, VULCANO, and SABBAT. (Hell's Headbangers Records #75)\n\nDECEASED - Supernatural Addiction LP/CD\n\nA death metal classic is unearthed from the crypt: DECEASED's masterfully haunting Supernatural Addiction! Originally released in 2000 on Relapse to widespread acclaim, DECEASED's Supernatural Addiction saw these underground legends expand upon the epic narratives of the preceding Fearless Undead Machines but put into punchier, more concise attacks without losing any of drumming frontman King Fowley's characteristically creepy storytelling. Less \"death metal\" and more deathly heavy metal, this DECEASED album cemented their staus as one of the most unique and recognizable metal bands since the turn of the '90s. HELLS HEADBANGERS is stepping in to reissue this cherished treasure, now with five bonus demo tracks ú feed your Supernatural Addiction! (Hells Headbangers #90)\n\nDEIPHAGO - Satan Alpha Omega CD\n\nExperiencing DEIPHAGO is like diving into the mouth of hell. On their third LP, \"Satan Alpha Omega,\" the Filipino power-trio open that maw even wider, swallowing whole the listener within their sulfurous storm. Heaving with horrific intensity, DEIPHAGO blast forth with nine hateful hymns bursting with vortextural riffing, mind-melted solos, decimated (and decimating) drums, and poisonous tongues exalting the devil in all his forms. If their previous two albums redefined black metalled violence, \"Satan Alpha Omega\" shall wipe the slate clean! (Hells Headbangers Records #87 CD)\n\nDENIAL OF GOD - Death And Beyond CD/LPx2\n\nThe ghoulish masters of the crypt return! Their first full-length in six years, underground legends DENIAL OF GOD emerge from the grave with \"Death and the Beyond,\" the band's heaviest and most morbid monument to date. Containing eight cursed tracks in 62 minutes and recorded in 13 days the analog way at the legendary Berno Studio (Grotesque, Kaamos, Amon Amarth, etc) in Sweden, \"Death and the Beyond\" captures all the trademark darkness and ghoulish atmosphere of classic DENIAL OF GOD, now going on 20-plus years. Want the perfect combination of black, death, doom, and heavy metal? Seek \"Death and the Beyond\"! (Hells Headbangers Records #82)\n\nDENOUNCEMENT PYRE - Almighty Arcanum LP/CD\n\nAfter 10 years of underground darkness, DENOUNCEMENT PYRE continue their ascent up the throne of Luciferian supremacy with Almighty Arcanum. The Aussie veterans' second full-length after their lauded World Cremation debut, DENOUNCEMENT PYRE's Almighty Arcanum is a veritable abyss of fiery, blackened death metal, but now sharper and more focused than ever. Total Darkness. Total Death. The unification of all that was, is, and will be: await Almighty Arcanum... (Hells Headbangers #93 LP / #97 CD)\n\nDENOUNCEMENT PYRE - Darkness Manifest 7\"\n\nNew 7\"EP titled 'Darkness Manifest' in lead up to the forthcoming album, \"Almighty Arcanum.\" This EP will act as a preview of what is to come with the next full-length and will feature one album track plus an additional track that is exclusive to this release. Both songs were recorded during different sessions to those for the album so they are unique to this limited release. (Hells Headbangers Records #67)\n\nDESTROYER 666 - To The Devil His Due CD\n\nCompilation of rare and out of print tracks from this barbaric Australian black metal band. (Hells Headbangers Records #66)\n\nDESTROYER 666 - Unchain The Wolves CD\n\nDESTROYER666 should need no introduction. But back in 1997, the Australians were a relatively new entity, forming from the ashes of Bestial Warlust and introducing themselves to the metal underground with the Violence is the Prince of This World EP in '95. Two years later, DESTROYER666 would throw down the gauntlet to the international metal scene with soon-to-be-classic debut album Unchain the Wolves. Devastating yet dynamic to the bitter, bloody end, Unchain the Wolves comprises 50 minutes of black metal magick 'n' might that quickly became the band's ever-unique trademark: epic and anthemic songwriting, gritty yet considered execution, and each song as integral as the last. Just try not headbanging to stone-cold classics like \"Australian and Anti-Christ\" and \"Satan's Hammer\"; if you don't, then you must be dead. As DESTROYER666 themselves said, Unchain the Wolves! (Hell's Headbangers Records #152 CD)\n\nDESTROYER 666 - Unchain The Wolves LP (gatefold with poster)\n\nComes in a Gatefold cover with a large 18\" x 24\" poster.

(Hell's Headbangers Records #133)\n\nDESTRUKTOR - Nailed CD\n\nRaging for well over a decade in the isolated land of Australia, Destruktor have stood the test of time with a few EPs and a demo under their bullet belts. In 2009, after much anticipation,n the war beast strikes again with their debut full-length album entitled \"Nailed\" featuring 10 new tracks of the highest degree accompanied by blasphemous Riddick illustrations. Harnessing the essential elements of fore founding extreme metal troops, Destruktor deliver a dark brutal desecration of exceptional warring bestial black metal of death that easily rivals those in the same battlefield. Destruktor will win the war... with or without your support!!! (Hells Headbangers Records #35)\n\nDESTRUKTOR/THRONEUM - A Prophecy Of Nihilism 7\"\n\nAn Australian/Polish celebration of barbarism awaits with A Prophecy of Nihilism, joining together DESTRUKTOR and THRONEUM on a split 7\". Up first is Australia's DESTRUKTOR with \"Besieged,\" a characteristically caustic attack that fuses the blackest of black metal and the deathliest of death metal, with that old warring touch for which they've helped their homeland become world renown. As a precursor to their forthcoming Opprobrium, DESTRUKTOR look to be in fit 'n' fighting shape, ready to eclipse 2009's celebrated Nailed! Prolific like few others and always committed to the diehard Metal of Death cause, Poland's THRONEUM follow with \"Chtonian Lust,\" one of their rawest and most primal pounders in forever, featuring some tastefully Bathorian soloing during the song's frenzied finale. With exclusive songs by both bands, A Prophecy of Nihilism is well worth heeding! (Hell's Headbangers Records #74)\n\nDWELL - Vermin And Ashes CD\n\nHELLS HEADBANGERS is proud to present the debut of a doom-death juggernaut whose name will surely be on everyone's tongues soon enough: DWELL's Vermin and Ashes, which compiles the band's demo debut as well as three new songs, making for a full-length release. Hailing from Denmark and boasting a membership with deep veteran status - including current members of HELLS HEADBANGERS death-commandos CEREKLOTH - the five-piece DWELL create a tar-thick, ominously bubbling brew on Vermin and Ashes. Their sound is undoubtedy rooted firmly in classic death metal, but their heaving, lumbering thrust is equally grounded in ancient doom metal. Along with half-sorrowful/half-haunting lead lines, well-timed bouts of blasting speed, and the occasional dusting of mystical synth, DWELL's Vermin and Ashes encompasses all that its song titles suggest: among them, \"Vermin In My Arteries,\" \"A Collapse Sublime,\" \"Plunging Into Ash Tombs,\" and the telltale \"Become the Void.\" Moody yet never totally defeatist, it's a sound that's at once lost to the mists of time yet also surprisingly fresh, for DWELL have few compatriots mining this barren wasteland of doomed-decibel wreckage. Hear the beginning of greatness with Vermin and Ashes, and jump on the VERMIN bandwagon before it's too late. (Hell's Headbangers Records #144 CD)\n\nEMBALMED - Exalt The Imperial Beast CD/LP\n\nAfter 17 years of strategically scattered EPs & demos, EMBALMED finally mark their triumphant return with their very first full-length album. Hailing from the darkest abyss of Mexico, EMBALMED leave nothing to subtlety when it comes to their raison d'etre - \"Exalt the Imperial Beast\"! A ceaselessly violent, gnawing torrent of black/death barbarity and sulfurous ritualism that is equally atrocious and dark but still retains a certain Death Metal character in the songwriting. A cult name that lurked in the shadows for far too long, EMBALMED surpass 95% of what is being offered in the current \"black/death\" scene - worship or die! Recommended for diehards of BESTIAL WARLUST, early MYSTIFIER, classic TEITANBLOOD, IMPURITY, and NYOGTHAEBLISZ. (Hells Headbangers #70)\n\nEVIL DAMN - Black Effigy 7\"\n\nSix long years since their last release, Peruvian death metal necromancers EVIL DAMN return with an unholy 'n' unremitting 7\" EP, \"Black Effigy\"! Their killing skills and bestial fire even more up-ratcheted since that last split with Abigail, EVIL DAMN here unleash a trinity of black magickal Metal of Death hymns that both nod to the ancient tradition of South American insanity and yet bring their own diabolical identity. Ceaselessly surging and violently unhinged, yet with chops and songwriting to spare, EVIL DAMN usher in 2014 with a quick but wholly satisfying hellstrike for the ages! Includes two members of the cult GOAT SEMEN, and ex-members of Levifer and Black Angel. (Hells Headbangers Records #68)\n\nEXECRATION - Morbid Dimensions LPx2\n\nComes in a gatefold cover with printed inner sleeves. One of death metal's best-kept secrets, Norway's EXECRATION strike with their deadliest and most daring album yet, Morbid Dimensions. Ever aptly titled, Morbid Dimensions is a twisting and twisted slab of miasmic, morbid Metal of Death. The listener is kept on edge the entire time, in a state of perpetual tension, as the quartet deftly slide through sinewy, sometimes-slimy riff and rhythm structures, all executed with stunning tightness yet also a sense of hysteric dangerousness. In many ways, EXECRATION's third album is an album of contrasts: death metal in its purest state, but with a view toward experimentation; doomy and atmospheric at will, but with a forward propulsion that's palpitating; a well-grounded set of old-school influences, particularly homeland heroes Cadaver, but without the slightest whiff of \"retro\" pandering. All told, Morbid Dimensions is the sound of a still young 'n' hungry band carving out their own niche, and with absolute cunning and confidence. A \"best-kept secret\" no longer - behold the rise of EXECRATION! (Hell's Headbangers Records #132)\n\nFRONT BEAST - Demon Ways Of Sorcery LP/CD\n\nSince the late '90s, Germany's FRONT BEAST have been lurking in the darkest corners of the black metal underground. Helmed by mainman Avenger, FRONT BEAST have stayed committed to a pure 'n' proud vision, honoring the ancient ways with a prolific stream of demos and split releases. Now, FRONT BEAST are prepared to storm with vengeance with their second album (and first for HELLS HEADBANGERS), Demon Ways of Sorcery. Fittingly titled, Demon Ways of Sorcery is trend-free black metal of an ancient, mystical hue: damp dungeon atmosphere, crude yet commanding execution, thirsty 'n' miserable vocals, an aura of hideousness and unhealth, and an unselfconscious obeisance of time-honored heavy metal values. When the moonlight calls...obey the Demon Ways of Sorcery! (Hells Headbangers #106/#111 CD)\n\nFUNERAL CIRCLE - Funeral Circle LPx2 (gatefold)\n\nEpic Doom Metal is not the most well known Heavy Metal genre. It takes a lot of heart and guts to play this style of music since the dinosaurs that started this kind of music are some of the very best bands to ever exist. Epic Doom Metal in our opinion started in Sweden with Candlemass. Their intention was to write the first Epic Doom Metal album. Other Doom Metal bands floating around back then weren't thinking about writing a Doom record, they just wrote records that sounded heavy and the way that they liked. With that said, we're proud to introduce Funeral Circle! Hailing from the icy mountains of Canada, this young and hungry band is writing some of the very best Epic Doom Metal songs heard today. If you're looking for Epic Doom Metal, there's not much out there better than this self-titled beast of an album! They're slowly clawing their way to the top of this genre. This record is loud, heavy, and raw with outstanding vocals. To top it off, if the fans voted on best album artwork, this would be the best of 2013. (Hell's Headbangers Records #121)\n\nGOAT SEMEN - Ego Sum Sathanas CD\n\nAt long last, one of the most highly anticipated debut albums ever arrives: GOAT SEMEN's Ego Sum Sathana. At ground zero of the rebirth and resurgence of South American black/death at the dawn of the new millennium, these Peruvian devils delivered one of the most classic demos ever with their self-titled 2002 demo, which has seen countless re-editions in the past decade as well as the band's legendary grow to enviable levels. But alas, a debut album has eluded the band, and the fervor 'n' anticipation for one have reached critical mass in the metal underground. Taking on almost mythical status (not unlike Sadistic Intent's long-promised debut LP), GOAT SEMEN's Ego Sum Sathana has been in the making for literally a decade. Granted, the band's been keeping busy in the underground since the 2002 demo, releasing a handful of splits with the likes of Nazxul, Krieg, Levifer, and Japan's Sabbat, among others, as well as two highly coveted live albums - but each step of the way, it's only been a few songs teasingly released a time. (Hell's Headbangers Records #147 CD)\n\nGOUGE - Beyond Death CD\n\nWhat's it sound like to go Beyond Death? That's precisely the question GOUGE answer with their titular debut album. These Norwegian death metal upstarts started off with a bang with their Doomed to Death EP, one of HELLS HEADBANGERS' hottest 7\" in recent years, and now with Beyond Death, the unholy duo upratchet their ravenous deathnoise x 666. GOUGE's influences are clearly from the oldest of schools - Repulsion, Autopsy, Death Strike, and earliest Death - but even just a cursory listen to Beyond Death reveals an acute understanding of what drives those sounds rather than the replication of them: their attack is gross and guts fucking, but burning with a passion that's blanching to behold. Not to mention that these young mavericks know how to write actual songs - and there's 10 quick-hitting slices of absolute DEATH here. No better time, then, to go Beyond Death with GOUGE. (Hell's Headbangers Records #143 CD)\n\nGRAVEWURM - Infernal Minions CD\n\nThe American band's ninth full-length overall, GRAVEWURM's Infernal Minions \"represents our continued path of worshipping the ancient gods of black metal,\" says founding vocalist/guitarist Funeral Grave. With cover art done by MASSACRE's Kam Lee, Infernal Minions indeed pays respect to the blackened altar of Hellhammer and Venom, Burzum and Beherit, Goatloard and Grand Belial's Key. Obstinate in their refusal to compromise, dedicated to the bitter end: For 23 years now, GRAVEWURM have been their own masters, and Infernal Minions is the aggregate accumulation of their arcane wisdom. (Hells Headbangers Records #104)\n\nTHE HAUNTING PRESENCE - 2015 LP\n\nFrom NOCTURNAL BLOOD mastermind Ghastly Apparition (aka THP-SOH) comes his most intense and personal project yet: THE HAUNTING PRESENCE and their brand-new, self-titled 12\" MLP. THE HAUNTING PRESENCE have steadily perfected their churning, coruscating craft over the course of a debut demo, a subsequent EP, a split with MUKNAL, and recently featured on the recent Black Twilight Circle compilation. Now, with The Haunting Presence MLP, the band truly comes into its own, exhibiting a hideous, ghoulish intensity that's far removed from now-typical \"bestial metal\" cliche whilst utilizing similar rudiments. Throbbing with gutted low-end and grinding string, THE HAUNTING PRESENCE here explode into black-holed oblivion across the record's six sinister tracks, prominently displaying THP-SOH's truly possessed ululations, particularly his now-patented (and quite insane) vocal intros. For black/death metal that deviates from the standard template, it's not surprising that THP-SOH takes a unique lyrical approach. In his own words, THE HAUNTING PRESENCE \"strictly is a representation and demonstration of my paranoia, perversions, madness, psychological understandings, connection with negative feelings/thoughts, the energy being produced through these meditations, sounds and words. These songs and words are more or less representing my meditations, dreams/nightmares - sleep paralysis, lucid, out of body, etc - horror, the supernatural/higher existence, sleep deprivation, fears, and concern for the modern world.\" (Hells Headbangers Records #P30)\n\nHELLVETRON - Death Scroll Of Seven Hells And Its Infernal Majesties CD/LP\n\nPressed on \"Oxblood\" Red Vinyl in black polylined inner sleeves. LP comes with an 18\" x 24\" Poster, a two-sided 11\" x 17\" lyrics poster scroll & a 12\" x 12\" insert. The outer jacket has a reverseboad matte finish. Black Doom Ceremony of Death spewing from the Mouth of Hell! Hellvetron's debut full-length ritual emerges through the threshold into a manifestation of obscure hell psalms of death. \"Death Scroll Of Seven Hells And Its Infernal Majesties\" will be a tribute to the Qliphothic Tree of Death, Seven Hells, and it's infernal hierarchy. This release will be a curse on all who dare to possess this unholy relic. Praise the ten horns upon the seven headed beast. (Hells Headbangers #73)\n\nHIC IACET - Prophecy of Doom 7\"\n\nThe mysterious Spanish entity of HIC IACET is rumored to include various movers 'n' shakers of the underground, and also equally rumored to be a solo-project of one supremely sick individual. Five members or none, HIC IACET's debut demo Hedonist of the Death floored anyone who heard it last year with its otherworldly miasma of morbidity and darkness; so hotly tipped was it that HELLS HEADBANGERS' exclusive 12\" vinyl pressing of 333 copies sold out almost immediately. Now, HIC IACET emerges from the funeral fog to stake their claim as one of underground metal's brightest/darkest hopes with the two-song Prophecy of Doom 7\" EP. Just like its namesake, Prophecy of Doom is a cavernous womb/tomb of pestilence, echoing sepulchral bellows from nameless depths. Meanwhile, morbid black/death barbarity rots the soul from the inside out as the carnal is ravaged in kind: behold HIC IACET's Prophecy of Doom! (Hell's Headbangers Records #61)\n\nHIGH SPIRITS - s/t 7\" (U.S. Pressing)\n\nPressed on Clear and White vinyl with a different layout from the European edition. Because the immensely popular namesake song of Chicago high-energy rockers HIGH SPIRITS has only been available in recorded form as an early home demo, the band has chosen to proudly feature it on the forthcoming new studio album You Are Here. Just ahead of the album's highly anticipated release on HELLS HEADBANGERS in North America, \"High Spirits\" will also be released as a limited-edition 7\" single, with another newly-recorded song from the band's formative nights appearing exclusively as the B-side. Get ready to raise your voice! (Hells Headbangers Records #71 EP)\n\nHIGH SPIRITS - You Are Here CD\n\nChicago's high-energy rock favorites HIGH SPIRITS have returned with a dashing follow-up to one of the most celebrated studio debuts of the millennium. Entitled \"You Are Here\", the new studio album finds HIGH SPIRITS in great form, having spent the past two years recording demos and getting a taste of international touring. While every bit as fresh, stylish, and hook-heavy as its \"Another Night\" predecessor, \"You Are Here\" showcases the band's full dramatic power, a dynamic intensity that perhaps had not been reached before. But as with all of HIGH SPIRITS' music, the abundant, inviting melody is balanced by raw heavy metal energy, drawing on the exhilarating live show that the band has performed in amphitheaters and dive-bars alike. For a band with universal potential, \"You Are Here\" is a graceful step forward. Highly recommended for all. Comes with an 8-page booklet featuring all lyrics.

The sole creation of longtime scene veteran J. (NOCTURNAL GRAVES, ex-DESTRUKTOR, ex-DESTROYER 666), IMPIOUS BAPTISM bellow forth desecrating black metal in the ancient tradition of the early South American and Finnish masters. Flowing from choking doom to grinding, black filth and imbued with a powerful, full-bodied production that amplifies every abyssal note, IMPIOUS BAPTISM drag you down into the depths and then deeper - feel the Wrath of the Apex Predator!

(Hell's Headbangers Records #98)\n\nINCANTATION - Entrantment of Evil LP\n\nAll copies pressed on black vinyl. Comes with a large poster of the cover artwork, a lyrics insert and silkscreened artwork on side B. At long last, HELLS HEADBANGERS is proud to present INCANTATION's Entrantment of Evil for the first time on 12\" vinyl. THE record that launched INCANTATION onto the worldwide death metal scene and thus their first step toward legendary status, Entrantment of Evil was first released in 1990 on 7\" vinyl by Seraphic Decay Records and then by Relapse Records a year later, again on 7\" vinyl. Both of the time and also prefiguring death metal's future, Entrantment of Evil is a sinister, surging, slithering beast of pure malevolence. Although primitive compared to INCANTATION's later works, its hammering attack is deliberately that way, and works to its advantage in creating an atmosphere of evil and unease. The record is also remarkable for featuring MORITCIAN's Will Rahmer on vocals - the only INCANTATION he appears on, in fact. Included in this 12\" vinyl pressing is an exclusive bonus track, and silkscreened art on side B.

At long last, INQUISITION's Invoking the Majestic Throne of Satan receives proper vinyl & CD editions, in deluxe tome packaging, courtesy of longtime supporters HELLS HEADBANGERS. Originally released in 2002 and long out of print, Invoking the Majestic Throne of Satan is the moment where INQUISITION truly came into their own and cemented a sound uniquely and entirely theirs: bulldozing, hypnotic, ritualistic, and thoroughly occult, an expansive 'n' absorbing BLACK HOLE that's an awesome power to behold, drone-oblivion chunder stretching to infinity and beyond, and all with the simplest, most stripped-down rudiments of guitar, drums, and voice. Here, INQUISITION both defined and REdefined black metal; the ideology and esoterica of true Satanism imbues everything the duo do across this monolithic, minimal-is-maximal work and yet personalized in such a manner that bespeaks absolute devotion to the darkside. And although the black metal scene at the time of the album's release was far sparser and far less public, the legendary around Invoking the Majestic Throne of Satan continued to grow, to the point where the album's now rightfully considered a classic, and it served as the springboard by which INQUISITION began to dominate the modern underground scene. So, hear the album the way it was intended to be experienced, as a portal to the Other Side, and try returning from the trip unchanged.

Encompassing the entire spectrum of dirty, sleazy metalpunk from ancient times, INTOXICATED's Rock N Roll Hellpatrol debut charges forward like a motorcycle out of hell, billowing toxic smoke and violently shaking the foundations of everything it passes on its way to the next party to dominate and destroy. Each song here - whether it's \"Crush Your Local Disco,\" \"Lock Up Your Daughters,? or the penultimate \"Slutanic Speed Metal\" is an anthem of annihilation, a harbinger of hedonism, a manifesto of maximalism: you can't escape the Rock N Roll Hellpatrol!

The (toxic) result is 10 tracks of raw and fuzzed-out rock 'n' roll / metal / punk in the vein of the first Bathory album and early Motorhead, take it or leave it! Says JOEL GRIND, \"If you are looking for over-produced shit that passes as 'metal' today, this is NOT for you!\" (Hells Headbangers Records #105)\n\nTHE LURKING CORPSES - 23 Tales Of Terror LPx2 (gatefold)\n\nComes in a Gatefold jacket.

To celebrate the 10th anniversary of this cult gem, HELLS HEADBANGERS will reanimate THE LURKING CORPSES' 23 Tales of Terror debut for its first (and only) incarnation on vinyl! Fittingly and frightfully, 23 Tales of Terror will receive a limited-edition double-LP treatment on colored vinyl, fresh from the crypt. Masked and dressed in black cloaks, horror metal freaks THE LURKING CORPSES have been brewing a thrashy, punk-influenced version of 1950s B-movie fuzz 'n' scuzz since 2001. Deadly committed to the cause, THE LURKING CORPSES are fulfilling every horror geek's wet dream with their tongue-in-cheek mix of sex, violence, and good, old-fashioned horror-flick gore.

But across the 15-track Workin' For the Devil, the masked 'n' becloaked demons from Indiana take many different, more dynamic paths into the haunted woods, including some of their most melodic moments to date.

Then submit to \"Complete and Total Hell\"! Exactly what it says on the tin, the exhaustive, 21-track \"Complete and Total Hell\" collects all of MIDNIGHT's entire pre-\"Satanic Royalty\" back catalog, much of it long out-of-print and highly sought-after. Hear where Black Heavy Metal first became law, when MIDNIGHT began their subjugation of all subjects at the very start of their Satanically royal reign: the cult is alive and well with MIDNIGHT! (Hell's Headbangers #89 CD)\n\nMIDNIGHT - No Mercy For Mayhem LP/CDx2 (available on either LP or CDx2)\n\nHotter than Hell in the metal/punk underworld, MIDNIGHT's debut album, Satanic Royalty, became an instant classic upon its release in 2011. Now, with anticipation at a fever pitch, the hooded demons return with the even better No Mercy for Mayhem. Whereas Satanic Royalty was the culmination of nearly a decade's worth of hard slogging in the underground, No Mercy for Mayhem is an intensification of everything its predecessor seemingly perfected: the hooks even more anthemic, the power more piledriving, the dirt dirtier, the sum effect being absolute BLACKOUT. Really, there's no current band who are able to mainline classic heavy metal, hard-charging punk rock, and grimy rock 'n' roll quite like MIDNIGHT can, and No Mercy for Mayhem is studded-leather, 10-track proof that mainman Athenar and crew are at the top of their game and bow to no one. As an added bonus, initial CD pressings of No Mercy for Mayhem will include a bonus track and a whole bonus disc comprising MIDNIGHT's super-limited Alive on the Streets of Cleveland live LP. On your feet or on your knees, you'll get No Mercy for Mayhem from MIDNIGHT! (Hells Headbangers #126)\n\nMIDNIGHT - Satanic Royalty CD/DVD\n\nComes with a bonus live DVD. Booklet features all lyrics.

The name MIDNIGHT has been a cult one for years now, but here they prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt - bow down before their \"Satanic Royalty\"!

This is the first time ever the complete \"House By The Cemetery\" EP has been released on vinyl. Licensed from Relapse Records. (Hells Headbangers Records #89)\n\nMORTICIAN - Mortal Massacre LPx2 (gatefold cover)\n\nAt long last, HELLS HEADBANGERS is proud to present MORTICIAN's Mortal Massacre for the first time on double-LP vinyl. Originally released in 1993 on CD format, comprising the band's first two 7\" EPs - 1990's Brutally Mutilated and 1991's Mortal Massacre, respectively released on Seraphic Decay and Relapse - and buffered by 14 live tracks, the Mortal Massacre compilation is MORTICIAN at their darkest and most primitive. Gutted and gut-busting, disgusting and depraved, there is no other sound quite like MORTICIAN's, and even at this earliest stage, the eternal(ly evil) duo of Will Rahmer and Robert Beaujard had their aesthetic firmly in place. From there, MORTICIAN would go on to legendary status in the death metal underground and influence thousands of bands the world over - and Mortal Massacre is a full hours' worth of proof. This vinyl pressing will be available on a double 12\" with laser etched art on side D. (Hell's Headbangers Records #142)\n\nMUTILATED VETERANS - Necro Crust Warhead LP\n\nPrepare to be crushed under the tank-treads of the most brutal Death Crust record ever: MUTILATED VETERANS' Necro Crust Warhead 12\" MLP.Exactly what its title says, Necro Crust Warhead is a hulking, heaving mass of utter D-beat destruction, galloping like the four horsemen of the apocalypse on the bones of the battlefield's dead. But far from being mere Discharge plagiarists, MUTILATED VETERANS up-ratchet the D-beat idiom with a molten metallic might that handily trounces even the most \"brutal\" death metal band - not surprising here, as erstwhile Machetazo/Dishammer founder Dopi is one of the MUTILATED VETERANS. The mission of Necro Crust Warhead is absurdly simple: get in, get out, and KILL-CRUSH-DESTROY. This is the future of No Future...

All copies come with a lyrics insert & a large 18\"x24\" poster of the cover artwork painted by Putrid. Cleveland filth-bangers NEKROFILTH might've made a foul 'n' furious impression with their Worship Destruction 2008 demo that was re-released by HELLS HEADBANGERS, but with their debut album Devil's Breath, NEKROFILTH have truly come into their own as one of the meanest, dirtiest metal bands around. Led by founding degenerate Zack Rose, NEKROFILTH's debut album mainlines - and MEANLY - raging old-school thrash, hardcore-punk, and grind into a cantankerous-yet-catchy fist to the face of all that's kind and clean...as if song titles like \"Junkie Cunt,\" \"Smear the Sleaze,\" \"Volcanic Zit,\" and \"Scum Freak\" already didn't say enough. So many bands dare to be \"extreme,\" but very few deliver the goods. NEKROFILTH, on the other hand, uniquely sound more extreme than those \"extreme\" posers and, more importantly, like little else currently going on in the metal underground: this is the smell of Devil's Breath! Recommended for diehards of NME, SLAUGHTER (Canada), REPULSION, and early ABSCESS. (Hell's Headbanger's Records #109/#115 CD)\n\nNEKROFILTH - Filling My Blood With Poison LP\n\nComes with a lyrics insert. Last year, HELLS HEADBANGERS unleashed upon the world a virus so violent and depraved, it became one of 2013's most critically acclaimed debut albums. That record was NEKROFILTH's Devil's Breath, and to meet the sick, seething demand for more sonic filth, HELLS HEADBANGERS is unloading a special vinyl LP pressing of Cleveland filth-bangers' Filling My Blood With Poison... demo. Originally self-released in early 2009, Filling My Blood With Poison... was NEKROFILTH's second demo and solidified the power-trio's dirty, diseased brand of grinding metalpunk. Shades of Repulsion, Abscess, Discharge, and Bulldozer abounded, as did G.B.H. (whose \"Necrophilia\" the band cover here), but the way in which NEKROFILTH piledrove it all together spoke volumes about the fetid future in store. Hear the birth of disease with Filling My Blood With Poison...! (Hell's Headbangers Records #29)\n\nNEXUL - Nexulzifer 7\"\n\nThe 7\" comes with a gatefold insert. Cover artwork by Antichrist Kramer.

Pressed on both cassette and 7\" and featuring members of Helvetron and Nyogthaeblisz, Nexulzifer comprises three rituals exalting the name of Lucifer and advocating the Rite of the Trident. With a hideous energy and bestial abandon, NEXUL's deathless will illuminates the Emerald Eye...behold the light!

Originally released in 2012 in a super-limited tape edition of 100 copies, Baphometic Goat of Thermonuclear War joins together two of the most savage cults in the black/death underground, South Korea's NOCTURNAL DAMNATION and Ecuador's NIHIL DOMINATION. Now seeing a split 7\" vinyl release courtesy of HELLS HEADBANGERS, the wider world can witness the barbaric, catacomb-dwelling bestiality of NOCTURNAL DAMNATION and the oblivion-seeking warfare noise of NIHIL DOMINATION.

Before they broke up in 2010, NOCTURNAL GRAVES were at the forefront of a fertile Australian underground metal scene that ably mainlined the best elements of black, death, and thrash. With ...From the Bloodline of Cain, the Oz commando show that their first run was no fluke, and are back with a bloody vengeance. In many ways, NOCTURNAL GRAVES' present can be best described as the perfect synthesis of ancient South American and German styles - fierce and fiery, incensed and enraged, and eternally thrusting with violence & force - but with a immediately ingraining songwriting acumen that's second to none. These songs will get in your head, and FAST, and compel you to destroy everything/anything within striking range: this is ...From the Bloodline of Cain!

In many ways, NOCTURNAL GRAVES' present can be best described as the perfect synthesis of ancient South American and German styles - fierce and fiery, incensed and enraged, and eternally thrusting with violence & force - but with a immediately ingraining songwriting acumen that's second to none. These songs will get in your head, and FAST, and compel you to destroy everything/anything within striking range: this is ...From the Bloodline of Cain!

Originally released in 2004, Burn the Cross is nearly eight minutes of classic NUNSLAUGHTER: thrashing death metal that's punchy in its execution and catchy in its composition. The unique factor to Burn the Cross is its two versions of the title track - one with founding frontman Don of the Dead on vocals and with his own lyrics, the other with longtime drummer Jim Sadist on vocals and with his own lyrics. Slap on this picture disc and go Burn the Cross! (Hell's Headbangers Records #P027)\n\nNUNSLAUGHTER - Christmassacre 7\" picture disc\n\nComes with a cardboard lyrics insert & in a thick polybag with flap.

Entitled The Devil's Congeries Vol. 1, this 2-CD set is the first of many exhaustive collections that will compile every single short-length NUNSLAUGHTER vinyl release - a band whose discography is bested number-wise only by Japan's Sabbat and Belgium's Agathocles. NUNSLAUGHTER's best work is considered by many to be their 7\" EPs, and The Devil's Congeries Vol. 1 displays the band's trademark Devil Metal in all its diabolical 'n' dirty glory, collecting EPs and splits from the late '90s and early 2000s, and capped off by their classic Killed By The Cross 7\" debut. Short, sharp shocks are the order of the day here, with 29 studio tracks across disc 1 and the majority of the 'Hell On...' live series on disc 2, thereby making this the definitive studio vs. live NUNSLAUGHTER statement.

On the flipside, fresh from their Workin' For the Devil comeback, THE LURKING CORPSES deliver a malevolent mid-tempo 'banger in \"Creatures of the Blackened Moon,\" sounding a lot like its title.

Led by erstwhile DECEASED frontman/founder King Fowley, here OCTOBER 31 range their entire repertoire, which goes all the way back to the mid '90s: from thrashing-like-a-maniac attacks to heart-pumping speed metal missiles and plenty of traditional metal in between, Bury the Hatchet is varied, dynamic, and immediately memorable HEAVY METAL to the bloody, glorious end. However, OCTOBER 31 are far, far beyond \"retro\" retread; the band entirely comprises 100% dyed-in-the-wool metal maniacs, including ex-Overlord shredder Brian \"Hellstorm\" Williams and bassist Jim Hunter of epic metal legends While Heaven Wept and Twisted Tower Dire. Ten tracks and nearly 42 minutes, Bury the Hatchet doesn't overstay its welcome, and buries itself deep into your metal heart.

Classic metal songwriting is the order of the day here, as the band ably sweep from speed metal surge to NWOBHM-inspired melodicism to occasionally an epic metal moment or two. At the forefront are King Fowley's clear 'n' commanding vocals, as the erstwhile DECEASED frontman decided to use a cleaner register that lost none of his trademark bite. Amended to this new edition is the band's first demo, Voyage to Infinity from '96, as well as tribute covers of IRON MAIDEN and OZZY OSBOURNE. Finally, The Fire Awaits You!

Entitled Gone to the Devil, this quick-hitting 7\" EP is the band's first release for new label home HELLS HEADBANGERS and is a precursor to their next full-length. And while it's been a good, long while since OCTOBER 31 have caused any heavy metal mayhem, their fires are burning brighter than ever with these two instantly headbanging tracks.

Originally released in 1999, Meet Thy Maker saw DECEASED vocalist/drummer King Fowley once again command his troops onward to heavy metal glory, this time with an even darker and more epic aspect. Much of this can be credited to the addition of Kevin Lewis on rhythm guitar, allowing original guitarist Brian \"Hellstorm\" Williams to work his magic on lead guitar, with the lo-end anchored as always by Jim Hunter (WHILE HEAVEN WEPT, TWISTED TOWER DIRE). Capped off by an emblematic cover of SAXON's \"Power And The Glory\" that they nearly make their own, Meet Thy Maker is truly the album where OCTOBER 31 solidified their unbending, still-enduring aesthetic. With this reissue, HELLS HEADBANGERS - the new label home of OCTOBER 31 - adds 1998's Visions of the End EP along with four live/demo bonus tracks.

Aptly titled, this two-song scorcher complements the sonic devastation to be found on The Tempter's Victorious: a militant, malevolent brand of blackened death metal that PERDITION TEMPLE have perfected, their crush chaotic yet controlled. However, band founder/scene veteran Gene Palubicki is joined by an elite cadre of new members here, including his old Angelcorpse guitar foil Bill Taylor (also of Immolation) and, on vocals, Black Witchery's intimidating Impurath. Both tracks here are exclusive, including a rabid, reverent cover of Blasphemy's classic \"Weltering in Blood.\" PERDITION TEMPLE are the Sovereign of the Desolate!

Both bands present exclusive and characteristically unique tracks here. PORTAL offer \"Trapezohedron,\" which is as tangled and twisted as it sounds: recorded in 1999 on a \"crooked four-track device\" with the founding duo of guitarist Horror Illogium and vocalist The Curator, this unearthed gem literally sounds like time collapsing in on itself.
