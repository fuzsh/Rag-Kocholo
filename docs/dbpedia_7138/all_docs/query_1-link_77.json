Death Smiles At Me\n6. A Custom-Made Hell\n7. Return To Ashes\n8. Strain At The Leash\n9. Flammable\n10. Antidote\n11. They Crawl Inside Me Uninvited\n12. Waiting For Buildings To Collapse\n13. Heart Shaped Violence\n14. Generations Decay\n\nSweden&#39;s Coldworker storms out of the gates with its debut The Contaminated Void. Conceived and created by Anders Jakobson (of the legendary Nasum) and his hand-picked selection of burgeoning metal players, Coldworker&#39;s razor-sharp attack is destined to send shockwaves through the international extreme scene. The Contaminated Void&#39;s fourteen tracks swarm with equal parts crushing riffs, blazing speed, and menacing vocal onslaughts. Outrageously agile guitars balance melodic leads with relentless aggression. From start to finish, The Contaminated Void burns with a ferocity and intensity rarely seen in any genre of metal. Simply stated, Coldworker and The Contaminated Void is among the finest Scandinavian metal this side of the 21st century.",

Disconnect from all that is true Eradicate what used to be you Annihilate in blind servitude Demoralize until our demise Convert and conquer a legacy of hate Rule and control the will to dominate Rotten faith, our hands forever bound To us there is no holy ground Walk in line, just a servant of the fools Another burden to bear Enslaved, restrained by limiting rules It's a daymare...\n\n3.\n\nAn Unforgiving Season 02:34\n\nSowing seeds of apathy In this field of dreams Cultivating misery Poisoning the stream Reaping bitter harvest As frost permeates An unforgiving season Coming on today Reservoirs are draining Bleeding life away Water flow is waning And no longer irrigates There's nothing left to harvest Famine rules the land Curse of negativity Turned fertile soil to sand Alone, enslaved Work and toil to no avail Decay paves the way Warmer season in its grave And ripe with pain and hate Vast and desolate A field once free of woe Now dark, dead and cold\n\n4.\n\nThe Contaminated Void 02:24\n\nSinister silence Forced into nothing Terror commenced In the contaminated void Dead freezing cold Kept in a psychic box Like a story untold He was the perverted toy Growing... The seeds of his death The silent state is the way to decay Rotting... With a mind dead and gone He is likely to die Soulless statue Devoid of motion There's no virtue In the contaminated void Mentally carbonized A cancerous soul Numb and desensitized Dead and reborn: Paranoid Growing... The seeds of his death The silent state is the way to decay Rotting... With a mind dead and gone He is likely to die Unveiled secrets will haunt them Public anger rise Disturbing, sick visions now become clearer We all despise Sinister silence Forced into nothing Terror commenced In the contaminated void Dead freezing cold Kept in a psychic box Like a story untold He was the perverted toy Growing... The seeds of his death The silent state is the way to decay Rotting... With a mind dead and gone He is likely to die\n\n5.\n\nDeath Smiles At Me 02:14\n\nSocial decay in me I strive for inner peace of mind But yield to sicker needs What's sane is left behind My hands are used as tools I'm on a random psycho path Birth-marked confiding fools Let loose the wrath I'm dreading to see your existence erased Forever chased by insanity Aggressive measures so unpleasant to face But death is smiling at me Infected with a dose of lunacy I'm losing grip of reality A forthcoming fear of what grows within me Increasing absence of empathy Inside the circle range And life was put on hold Her fate in hands of a mind deranged Wait and watch as death unfolds The fury drives me deeper Exploiting my supremacy I impersonate the reaper And the dark sides of humanity My heart is pounding A taste of blood in my mouth Death smiles at me I feel alive Demanding to see your existence erased Forever chased by insanity Aggressive measures so unpleasant to face Yet death is smiling with me\n\n6.\n\nA Custom-Made Hell 03:01\n\nBlinded from the world outside Restraining my moves I have got nowhere to hide I have nothing to prove Barred reality, feeding hostility Aligning with suffering, hatred reigns Blind to the beating, dying in vain Aligning with suffering, familiar with pain Desirable meeting on the edge to what I sustain They're refusing to show But I am dying to see This is a custom-made hell Constructed only for me Forced and compelled Limitations exceeding Incarnations of hell Leaving me bleeding Shutting out all that's real Emotional rape Ungodly abuse Is now taking shape Soiled by their disgusting hands I'm scraping my skin A plague that infects the land The dark secret within (Aligning with suffering) Hatred reigns Blind to the beating, dying in vain Aligning with suffering, familiar with pain Desirable meeting on the edge to what I sustain\n\n7.\n\nReturn To Ashes 04:18\n\nDescending I'm lowered into the ground Returning to ashes and dirt In the casket's confines Oblivion bound Consumed by the earth Life-like Flowers adorn mourner's hands A funeral procession in bloom An ironic parade Life eternal interred, Immortality's doom Returning to ashes and dirt Dreading\n\n8.\n\nStrain At The Leash 02:43\n\nTo reach divine perfection They fill us with fear Demanding sick restrictions The end draws near Strain at the leash Salvation for us all to reach Deceitful speech Blindly obey, aching, trapped in dismay Disciples of hate Serving to make your lies justified Pre-controlled faith Evolution denied, chaos spreading worldwide Deceive the weak, profit on defeat Punish their disbelief And make them hurt No sympathizing grief For the inert Strain at the leash Salvation for us all to reach Deceitful speech Blindly obey, aching, trapped in dismay Disciples of hate Serving to make your lies justified Pre-controlled faith Evolution denied, chaos spreading worldwide Their manipulation has fed my disgust Corrode their belief till it all turns to rust Get rid of this plague all over the nation The world will suffer religious starvation Torn down from the top of the hierarchy Wake up and smell the hypocrisy Strain at the leash Salvation for us all to reach Deceitful speech Blindly obey, aching, trapped in dismay Disciples of hate Serving to make your lies justified Pre-controlled faith Evolution denied, chaos spreading worldwide\n\n9.\n\nFlammable 01:58\n\nSoul on fire, death desire, spirit in flames Violent combustion going off inside my brain Reacting to an inside fire Raw emotion burns Manic urge returns Spreading to the outside world and raging uncontrolled Moral insurrection, compassion overthrown Reacting to an inside fire Raw emotion burns Manic urge returns The state\n\n10.\n\nAntidote 02:28\n\nA painful, drawn-out death You'll get what's coming your way Merely a fraction of the suffering that you have caused You've led a double life, of torture, rape and murder Sadistic acts, carried out in bursts of rage In this world, there's no cure for your sickness Our time, poisoned, plagued by your existence Death is all you see... in these endless fields of misery! ...When you're done... Another life has ended Are you proud? Do you feel satisfied? A helpless victim builds a sense of power in you But that power will soon be ripped to shreds! In this world, there's no cure for your sickness Every human poisoned, plagued by your existence Death is all you see... in these endless fields of misery! They died in vain, enduring sickening pain Your victims, all slain, to you it is a game Never felt shame, since media gives you fame Murderer is your name, and you deserve all blame!
