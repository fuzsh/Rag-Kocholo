        "text": "Note: Josh Fury, guitarist from Congress and Liar. Photo by: (?), 199x. Sourced from: H8000 Central blog.\n\n[UPDATE: 07/17/2021: Some minor changes were made]\n\nIntroduction\n\nCoucou, les chaton.ne.s! We’re back with the very first entry of 2021. I think there’s no better way to starting this new rotten decade than writing about one of, if not, the most « angrily distorted » european hardcore punk scenes in the 90s ever: West Flanders, Belgium AKA H8000 Hardcore. As you already may know, the name H8000 is a wordplay between Hate (H) and this particular flemish region’s postal code (8000) and, thus, you must read it as « Hate Thousand« . Pretty cool, ha? Note that this curiously intriguing episode of the whole belgian hardcore/punk history is regarded by many as one of the most influential to both metalcore and deathcore subgenres as well.\n\nThis entry also marks the beginning of a new section here in the blog: the « maxi mini-special posts ». They basically are extended mini-special posts. Indeed, they will be pretty much like some sort of « condensed » normal special posts in one entry (As you may know, I normally spend at least more than 3 entries when doing those kind of writings). However, it is mixed with previous special posts under the name of « Your (un)official guide to…« , which it’s been awhile since they’ve been featured here in the blog. They were kinda popular back in the days so, yeah, they will be back more periodically…\n\nNow, I have to admit that I have years, I mean, YEARS, trying to write about this iconic hardcore scene in the 90s. Indeed, we’ve already have featured other special posts with different hardcore scenes of that era from countries like Sweden, Germany and France but the west-flemish belgian hardcore/punk scene probably is one of the most notorious ones due to the fact that most of these musical outfits were politically-charged vegan straight edge bands and, during the halfway of the decade, their discours was getting even more outspoken and uncompromising, compared to other hardcore/punk scenes at the time, and, well, mosh and stuff made things a little bit more violent and challenging as well.\n\nFinally, this special post will be focused on the scene from 1989 to 1999 exclusively since I consider this was the zenith of west-flemish hardcore/punk with all the things that happened prior to the H8000 Hardcore, the reason why this particular belgian scene is known for. Special thanks to H8000 Central, Vort’n Vis in the 90s, Brob Tilt’s Tapes, and Records With History And Future since most of the featured information in this humble entry was retrieved from these websites. I highly encourage you to visit them. They have great information and stuff about H8000 Hardcore spectrum. Totally worth it. And, stay tuned since next week, we’ll post some of your review submissions les chaton.ne.s! Thank you so much for your patience, comprehension and support. It means a lot to me. Trust me. Without further ado, let’s begin.\n\nRise Above\n\nB Is For Boston. Rise Above’s second and last EP. Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nRise Above was one of the first straight edge bands in Belgium and also the first one in their local city (Kortrijk) that would definitely start the first wave of H8000 Hardcore movement under the Positive.Powerful.Political motto. They’re named after a well-known Black Flag’s track. During their short lifespan, they only released two 7″ EPs: one self-titled (Punk Etc. Records (Belgium), 1989) and B Is For Boston (Stand As One Records (France), 1991). Some tracks of these records also were contributed to Coming Back To Haunt You compilation (Not On Label, Germany, 1991).\n\nRegarding their sound, Rise Above mostly had classic bostonian hardcore influences (Negative FX, Gang Green, SSD, DYS, Slapshot, etc.) and also teased with both thrashcore (a pretty popular style in Belgium during the mid-80s) and youth crew to some extent. Their first EP also features a pretty interesting melodic hardcore-driven track, though. The band also had more politically-charged lyrics making references to straight edge, veganism and the hardcore scene in general terms. Their second and last EP ever has two SSD and DYS covers (the latter is sung by « Hazel », making thus the first belgian hardcore/punk record in the late-80s/early-90s featuring a womyn singing. Cool).\n\nFinally, sometime before Rise Above’s disolution in 1991, some of their members went on and formed another influential local bands such as N.O.F., Shortsight, Blindfold, Wheel of Progress (pre-Congress and Liar). Don’t forget to click on the image above for downloading their EPs. Oh, BTW. Did you get the Kiss’ reference on their second EP’s front cover artwork? Awesome, right? Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nNations On Fire\n\nNote: N.O.F’s first LP front cover. Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nN.O.F. existed sometime between 1990 and 1998. They did some reunion shows between 2018 and 2019 and recently reunited in 2020. During their lifespan in the 90s, they released New Hope For A Dead Scene demo (Not On Label; N.O.F. self-released, 1991), Strike The Match LP (Strive Records, 1991), Instrumental demo (Warehouse Records, 1992. The B-Side includes some N.O.F.’s impressions during Born Against (USA) European tour that year), Live At Vort’n Vis, Non Smokers EPs, Burn Again…LP (Warehouse Records, 1992) and Death Of The Pro-Lifer LP (Conquer The World (USA)/Genet Records, 1995). Their tracks also have been featured on anti-racist, anti-fascist and animal rights-related hardcore/punk compilations throughout the 90s (and even the 00s).\n\nRegarding their sound, this is pretty much the same musical and lyrical path traced by Rise Above, the first 8000 Hardcore outfit. However, they also explored with emo influences (notably on their second LP) and a particular melodic hardcore interpretation throughout most of their records. There’s even one hybrid hardcore punk/techno parody song on their last LP ever. N.O.F., technically speaking, was one of the last local 8000 Hardcore bands with more punk leanings than metallic orientation, compared to their counterparts that started to incorporate the latter element into their respective repertory. Also, the lyrics were not only restricted to straight edge, animal rights and the hardcore scene but also covered other political, social and economic issues such as poverty, capitalism, social ecology, patriotism/nationalism, destruction of the environment, the farce behind popular elections, racism, religion and pro-choice (Being the latter a very sensitive topic throughout the decade because some « militant » vegan straight edge factions, i.e. the infamous « Hardline » movement, were pro-lifers), among other topics. In 2018, the original 1991 line-up reunited at the Gasteiz Calling Fest in spanish Basque Country. And, the next year, they performed two shows during Gorilla Biscuits’ European tour in Saarbrücken (Germany) and Barcelona, (Catalunya, Spain) and also played at the Break Down The Walls Fest in Paris (France) that same year.\n\nFinally, in July 2020, the band announced, through their official Facebook fanpage, that they reunited again and currently are working on brand new material. According to the band, this will be Strike The Match LP follow-up because David and Edward’s vocal duet will be back in 30 years (This feature was stopped since the release of their second LP in 1992). Wow. We’ll have to wait and see what will happens next. Don’t forget to click on the image above for downloading their entire discography to date (the Instrumental demo is missing, though). Mandatory download. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nSpirit Of Youth\n\nThe Abyss. S.O.Y.’s first EP ever. Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nS.O.Y. was formed back in 1990 and they only released one demo (Warehouse Records, 1992), The Abyss EP (Crucial Response (Germany), 1992), Engine b/w Darkroom single (Sober Mind Records, 1993), split LP with One King Down (USA) (Good Life Recordings / Equal Vision Records, 1997), Source LP (Sober Mind Records, 1997) and Colors That Bleed LP (Good Life Recordings, 1998). Their name comes from a track by Straight Ahead, a straight edge NYHC band.\n\nRegarding the sound of this record is pretty much emo-oriented with some slight teasings with melodic hardcore (and even pop punk to some extent). Imagine Turning Point’s transition to emo in the late-80s. For The Abbys EP, S.O.Y. played youth crew-influenced hardcore (with some slight metallic orientation), pretty much like Rise Above did. Finally, for the 1993 single, the sound of these recordings are a little bit more metallic oriented that will surely remind you of Refused’s early recordings or even of other west flemish counterparts that started to tease more with metal than anything else such as Wheel Of Progress (pre-Congress and Liar). After this release, S.O.Y. went on indefinite hiatus.\n\nIn 1997, S.O.Y. re-reformed once again with a brand new line-up and a much more overwhelming, heavier and « groovy » metalcore orientation in the same vein as other H8000 Hardcore counterparts such as Congress, Liar and Vitality. But the spirit of their younger days still was intact. The split with One King Down (USA) and the second LP were recorded by this line-up. Finally, the band split up in 2002 and did a reunion show at the reformed Vort’n Vis venue in 2019 (only featuring two of the original S.O.Y.’s members). As far as I know, there are currently no plans for upcoming recordings nor gigs/shows in the near future. Finally, click on the image above for downloading S.O.Y’s entire discography. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nBonus: The Imposible Dream and Solid\n\nNote: The Impossible Dream’s Love, Truth & Honesty EP front cover. Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nThis EP featured re-recorded tracks from S.O.Y.’s ’92 demo (4 out of 6 tracks) with a pretty interesting melodic hardcore execution. Yup, I think there’s nothing more to write about it. You can download it and listen to it by clicking on the image above. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nNote: Solid’s profile pic on Discogs.\n\nSometime during S.OY.’s « second generation », some of their members formed Solid. This band only released Blender demo (1996), Sadness Of Mankind CD (Released Power Productions (Belgium), 1996), Darkside Moments CD (Diehard Music Worldwide (Denmark), 1997) and Total Rush CD (Released Power Productions, 2003). Just like other local H8000 Hardcore-related acts, Solid started as a metalcore band with political lyrics dealing with different topics such as fascism, religion, racism and other social pathologies. However, since the release of their second album, they gradually started incorporating some melodic death metal influences (think of swedish acts such as At The Gates or In Flames) to their repertory and the lyrics were getting, well, more darker with lots of hate and anger towards everything and nothing at the very same time. But don’t worry, straight edge and animal rights were still a thing, though. You can click on the image above if you’d like to download their second and third albums (note that the latter contains the first one as bonus). I couldn’t find their demo. Sorry. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nBlindfold\n\nNote: Blindfold’s World Of Fools single 7″ booklet. Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nBlindfold was formed in 1992 by some S.O.Y’s ex-members of S.O.Y.’s. During their lifespan, Blindfold released Sober Mind Meditation EP (Warehouse Records, 1992), Deprogrammers Do Not Exist EP (PMA Records (Belgium), 1992), Restrain The Thought LP (Conquer The World Records (USA), 1993), split EP with Encounter (USA) (Sober Mind Records, 1994), World Of Fools single 7″ (Machination Records, 1994), Asteroid 164* LP (Sober Mind Records / Good Life Recordings, 1996) and Live At Vort’n Vis LP (Sober Mind Records, 1998). They also contributed tracks to different international hc/punk compilations including Regress No Way! (Warehouse Records, 1992), Illiterate (Ebullition Records, 1995) and H8000 Hardcore The Compilation Volume I (Genet Records / Sober Mind Records, 1998), among others.\n\nRegarding their sound, Blindfold played straightforward hardcore punk, highly influenced by the now well-known late-80s and early-90s metallic hardcore approach in the NYHC scene. However, unlike most of their local 8000 Hardcore counterparts, they also added emo and post-hardcore elements into their repertory thus creating a very unique and personal touch of which they would be known for decades. You can think of emo-related musical sideprojects by early-90s vegan straight edge bands in the US such as Framework, Oversight and Shadow Season, for naming a few. Since the release of their first LP, the band also incorporated different sounds of very unusual instruments such as violins to accompany their already mesmerizing and captivating sound. This trend would be more prevalent on their last LP ever since we can hear gongs, bells, tambourines, saxophones and more. I also found quite interesting the inclusion of a very strange « sewer » ambient in some tracks, which gives you the impression that you are exploring that kind of areas on a videogame. Cool. Despite these « alien » elements, Blindfold always remained akin to their formula and didn’t crossed the « experimental » hardcore line (or at least in a wider sense). The lyrics also had both political and personal content dealing with common hardcore topics such as straight edge and animal welfare but also spiritual and materialistic dichotomies, anti-capitalism, anti-racism and anti-consummerism stances, among others.\n\nFinally, click on the image above for downloading their almost entire discography. Some compilation tracks are missing though. I remember there was an attempt of an official discography some years ago but, for whatever reason, it didn’t happen. Too bad… Both Restrain The Thought and Asteroid 164* LPs changed my life. I hope they do the same for you, les chaton.ne.s! Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nShortsight\n\nNote: Shortsight’s Cold Wounds Waking CD jewel case inside cover. Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nShortsight was formed back in 1992, and they only released one demo (1992), a contributed track to the Regress No Way! compilation (Warehouse Records, 1992), Why Spend Time Learning…EP (Machination Records / Conquer The World Records, 1993) and Cold Wounds Waking LP (Good Life Recordings, 1996). Originally, their sound was more into youth crew (pretty much like S.O.Y’s early recordings) but, from the first EP, Shortsight played metallic hardcore in the same vein as other local counterparts such as S.O.Y. and Blindfold but they made a pretty interesting mix with complex and technical guitar riffs and solos, mid-tempo chugga-chugga-esque drum beats, some melodic traits and the vocalist unique voice pitch had an interesting eerie aura to remark to. Indeed, you can think of like a mix of Cro-Mags and Split Lip. The lyrics also had both political and personal stances dealing with animal welfare, family relationships, anti-media, anti-nationalist and anti-patriotic stances, among others. There were a few instrumental-only interludes on their first and only LP (for example, Uprooted track, made by Joost « Josh Fury » Noyelle, guitarist from Congress). Finally, click on the image for downloading their entire discography. This is a somewhat underrated band that you shouldn’t miss out either. I hope sometime in the near future someone will reissue their material.. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nDreft\n\nNote: Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nDreft was a grindcore band from Kuurne/Wevelgem, West Flanders that existed from 1986 to 1993. There’s a discography CD out there compiling everything this band ever recorded ((Blé-Pre-Erections Productions (Belgium), 200x): Slaughter Terror 1 – 6-way split with Hectic, Blatant Yobs, Atrocious, Fungus (Netherlands) and Samael (Switzerland) (Pneumatic Slaughter (Netherlands), 1989), Butchered demo (1991) and The End (live) (1993). This band can also be considered part of the rising of crust/grindcore spectrum in their country at the time with bands like Agathocles, Nasum and Private Jesus Detector, among others (I’d like to write about them in the near future…).\n\nRegarding their sound, Dreft started like your typical 80s grindcore band with death metal influences and stuff, you know, pretty much like Carcass (early recordings), Napalm Death (UK) and Terrorizer (US), among others. However, the band’s sound was gradually evolving into a much more refined extreme metal orientation including doom metal traces as well.\n\nFinally, click on the image for downloading their ’91 demo. It’s the only material I have from Dreft. Sorry. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nWheel Of Progress\n\nNote: W.O.P.’s It’s Alive…EP front cover. Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nWheel Of Progress (from now on WOP) was a very short-lived musical outfit from Kortrijk town that only released one EP entitled It’s Alive…(Rank&File Records, 1993). This is the first west flemish metalcore record as such and the first step to the « Edge Metal » side of things (the H8000 Hardcore‘s iconic sound). Indeed, WOP played straightforward metalcore, pretty much like other bands back at the time such as Hatebreed (early recordings) or Downset. It’s really remarkable the metal influences since you can detect more interest in thrash metal and even industrial rock (think of Slayer and Ministry, for example), compared to other local 8000 Hardcore counterparts we’ve featured so far. The lyrics were somewhat abstract dealing with topics such as animal welfare and other anti-consummerism stances. It’s too bad this band didn’t last much longer. After this release, WOP split up and other bands like Congress and Liar were born, which, as you may have already guessed, are considered the godfathers of H8000 Hardcore. Finally, click on the image for downloading this lost but not forgotten hardcore jewel. Do not miss it out. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nCongress\n\nNote: Congress profile pic on Discogs\n\nNote 2: You can read a really interesting interview done by Records With A History And Future website to « Josh Fury » by clicking here and here).\n\nCongress was formed back in 1993 and their sound was much more into metal than any other 8000 Hardcore band at the time, following the path traced by Wheel of Progress. The lyrics also dealt with the standard topics of their local scene such as straight edge, animal rights, etc. With the release of their first EP entitled Euridium (Good Life Recordings, 1994), they formally started the more metallic-orientation of the 8000 Hardcore scene during the rest of the 90s decade and H8000 Hardcore was established as such.\n\nIn 1995, Congress released their first full-length album entitled Blackened Persistance, once again through Good Life Recordings. This LP put on the map the H8000 Hardcore scene phenomena with the international praise and recognition that still retains as today. The lyrics started to have a much more abstract touch with a very dark and violent twist making thus cryptic references to the H8000 Hardcore ethos in general. In fact, the band’s lyrics were evolving to this particular way of writing that some liner notes were made in later recordings. As a curious fact, AK Modan (Blackened Persistance‘s first track) has a modified sampler from Super Castlevania IV videogame (HxC Geeks FTW!). Some brief european tours with local friends Blindfold (1996) and Morning Again (USA) in 1997 were held and contributed tracks to different international hardcore/punk compilations such as The Good Life, We Shall Fight In The Streets and more as well.\n\nIn 1998, their second full-length album entitled Angry With The Sun (Good Life Recordings) was released. Unlike previous releases, this LP was more death and thrash metal-oriented and this is probably their most popular release ever. Also, the « obscure » lyrics’ approach (liner notes included) was more evident than before. Finally, in 2000, Congress released Stake Through The Heart LP (Good Life Recordings), which developed even further this more metal, less hardcore-orientation. This trend continued in the following records from 2002 to 2004 period. Congress did their last gig in 2006 with 800 people attending (Wow). Also, Good Life Recordings released The Legacy compilation CD that year, which features Euridium and The Other Cheek EPs (Good Life Recordings, 1994 and 1996 respectively), contributed tracks to the split with Mindsnare (1997), an unreleased Outburst cover and Congress’ last 4 tracks ever.\n\nFinally, Congress (with the Blackened Persistance line-up) reunited in 2012 for playing two shows at Ieper Hardcore Fest and Good Life Fest that year (Pierre, their original vocalist, didn’t sing at the latter because he cancelled at the very last minute and was replaced by « Jeroen Sektor », vocalist from Sektor, another influential H8000 Hardcore band in the mid-90s). As of today, there are no plans to other reunion shows nor recording brand new material. But, you know, something may happen…Anyways, don’t forget to click on the image above for downloading The Legacy CD, Blackened Persistance and Angry With The Sun LPs. (Sorry, those are my favorite records from Congress ha!). Mandatory download. Enjoy!\n\nLiar\n\nNote: Photo by Cindy Frey, 2005. Sourced from Discogs.\n\nNote 2: If you’d like to read some additional information about Liar, you can read an interview with Hans Verbeke, made by Records With History And Future website, by clicking here.\n\nAlongside Congress, Liar were the H8000 Hardcore de facto ambassadors. They were active from 1995 to 2006 (they also briefly reunited in 2008 and 2019) and released Falls Of Torment LP (Good Life Recordings, 1996), Invictus LP (Genet Records, 1997), split with Family Of Dog (Belgium) (Genet Records, 1997), Deathrow Earth LP (Good Life Recordings, 1999), Liar’s Hell LP (Alveran Records (Germany), 2002), H8000 Hardcore – split with Congress (Pyrorex Records (Belgium), 2002), Decontaminate – split with Sunrise (Poland) (Lifeforce Records (Germany), 2003), Demo CDr (Not on label; Liar self-released, 2005) and Murder Manifiesto LP (GSR Music (Germany), 2005).\n\nLiar, like Congress, was born from the ashes of W.O.P. and their first performance was at the mythic Vort’n Vis venue in Ieper (Mars 25th,1993) and, according to Vort’n Vis in the 90s blog, they presented themselves as a « mix of Unbroken and Morbid Angel » (You can read some impressions of that concert by clicking here). Their first LP, which quickly became another signature record for the rise of the H8000 Hardcore (and « Edge Metal« ) side of things at the west flemish hc/punk circuit. The lyrics also had a very bold statement against the statu quo back then, for example, Battlecries and Suggestion are apostathetic anthems against the war and « holy » bible, respectively.\n\nIn 1997, Liar recorded their second LP: Invictus. This record took back then the brand new H8000 Hardcore orientation to the next level. Indeed, more death metal elements were incorporated into the sound and the lyrics were more introspective and abstract but still retaining the outspoken, uncompromising and unapologetical vegan straight edge vision of their previous LP. For example, Falls Of Torment, 2000 A.D. and Invictus portray a diseased society condemned to oblivion. You can also read on the back cover of the record the Warfare Against Your Drug Generation line so, yeah, they were serious about their Edge Metal stuff…\n\nTwo years after, Liar released Deathrow Earth LP. This record had a much more darker and apocalyptic nature, curiously focused on the total destruction of this world by pollution, war and other « earthly » abominations and damnations. There are some very obscure references in the inner sleeves and the lyrics as well, something that could make you think that they were somewhat linked to the Holy Terror spectrum but this wasn’t the case. (Note: I’ve been told this record will be re-issued later this year so, keep that in mind).\n\nFinally, in 2002, Liar released the Liar’s Hell LP and in 2005, Murder Manifesto LP, a demo as well as the splits with Congress and Sunrise. These records followed the path traced by the band since the mid-90s, both musically and lyrically speaking, and was the very last of the original H8000 Hardcore bands in th early/mid-00s. FX7 Records (Belgium) recently re-released Falls Of Torment LP in 2019 (with the original artwork and inner sleeves plus a very limited special edition with a different artwork as well) so get it if you can. Otherwise, click on the image above for downloading the first two LPs (original editions) from this now legendary belgian band. Sorry, those are the only ones I have ha ha. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nRegression\n\nNote: Regression’s Heartless CD front cover. Photo sourced from Discogs.\n\nRegression was hardcore band that existed between 1995 and 1999 and only released one demo (1995), Heartless CD (Good Life Recordings, 1996) and split with Breach (Sweden) (Burning Heart Records (Sweden), 1997). Unlike other local H8000 Hardcore musical outfits, Regression started to draw influences from NYHC bands that started to get associated to the beatdown side of things such as Merauder or Bulldoze. Indeed, since the very first moment you blast their demo, you can listen to the loved/hated chugga-chugga style that took the hardcore spectrum by assault in the 90s. However, on their only LP, you also can perceive some deathgrind and industrial rock cues. This record rips as fuck and I dare to say it’s heavier than most modern beatdown acts today. Concerning the lyrics, well, besides the typical vegan straight edge references that you’d mostly find on a 90s hardcore record, Regression also started to add in more hateful and deceitful content, pretty much like other H8000 Hardcore counterparts did when things started to get heavier and stuff… Finally, you can also look for the 9597 LP discography, released through FX7 Records (Belgium) in 2018, which contains all Regression’s recorded material to date plus some extra tracks as bonus. Otherwise, click on the image above for downloading their demo and first and only LP. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nDeformity\n\nNote: Photo sourced from Discogs\n\nDeformity from Menen/Houthulst/Roeselare area were active somewhere between 1995 and 2002 and, during their lifespan, they only released: Live Beyond (demo) (1996), Misanthrope CD (Good Life Recordings, 1997), split with Congress (Good Life Recordings. 1997), Murder Within Sin LP (Next Sentence Recrodings (Belgium), 1999) and Superior LP (Displeased Records (Netherlands), 2002). Regarding their sound, Deformity can be considered one of, if not, the first european deathcore band in the 90s. Indeed, this is a pretty good mix of hardcore (with eventual beatdown traces) and death metal. Imagine this belgian outfit like a cross-breed between Earth Crisis and Morbid Angel. Nice. The lyrics were kinda obscure with some references to misanthropy, apostasy, sin, redemption and other things that will remind you of american bands like Disembodied, Integrity, Ringworm or Morning Again to some extent. Finally, click on the image above for downloading their Misanthrope CD (It’s the only record I have from theirs. Sorry, les chaton.ne.s!). FX7 Records will re-release this record sometime later this year so, stay tuned. BTW, do not get frightened by the term deathcore, les chaton.ne.s! This was the real deal long before Suicide Silence and Bring Me The Horizon spoiled everything. Well, kinda…(Ha!). Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nSektor\n\nNote: Photo sourced from Sektor’s profile pic on Discogs.\n\nSektor was a vegan sxe metalcore band from the Beselare area and was active between 1996 and 1997. They only released Ultimate Threat EP (Sober Mind Records, 1996), split with Vitality (Sober Mind Records, 1996) and Human Spots Of Rust LP (Sober Mind Records, 1997). And, yes, their name comes from one of the infamous robot-like characters from Mortal Kombat videogame franchise (you know, the red one). Regarding their sound, Sektor played like other death metal-influenced H8000 Hardcore counterparts such as Deformity and Vitality with some of the now well-known chugga-chugga-esque flavor in most of post-Earth Crisis metallic hardcore acts throughout the 90s. In fact, Earth Crisis would eventually add that extreme metal flavor in the 00s. The apprentice also teaches the master. Never forget that. And, the lyrics were surprisingly clever and well-written, filled with anger and hatred towards catholic societies raised in fear, sexual offenders, the illusion of the « edge »/ »non-edge » lifestyles and even some indirect satanist references. Interesting. After Sektor’s disolution in 1997, their drummer joined in Liar and played with them until 2006. « Jeroen Sektor », their vocalist, did some backing vocals on Circle Of Blood track by Liar from their Invictus LP and also replaced, at the very last minute, Pierre from Congress at the Good Life Fest in 2012. I’m not sure what other projects the rest of the members of Sektor were involved in thereafter. Finally, click on the image above for downloading the EP and LP from this kinda underrated short-lived H8000 Hardcore outfit, probably overshadowed by more popular acts such as Congress and Liar. Oh, and I almost forgot. The last track from Ultimate Threat EP contains a voice sampler of a Mortal Kombat match with « Sektor Wins. FATALITY » announcement and stuff. HxC geeks FTW! ha ha ha. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nVitality\n\nNote: Vitality’s profile pic on Discogs.\n\nVitality was a band from Oostduinkerke, West Flanders, and part of the so-called ODK Crew, which was like a some sort of H8000 Hardcore’s « satellite » city. The band existed sometime between 1995 and 1998 and only released: one split with Sektor (Sober Mind Records, 1996), Bloodline LP (Sober Mind Records, 1997) and Crucial Wires LP (Overcome Records (France), 1998). Regarding their sound, just like other H8000 Hardcore-related acts, they started to play « tough guy » hardcore mixed with both death and thrash metal as well. Indeed, you can imagine Holy Terror associated acts in the early-90s such as Catharsis, Integrity and Ringworm mixed with much more extreme metal influences. At some point, I was wondering how wonderful our fucked up world would be if Madball were into both Possessed and Morbid Angel. Just wondering…Their first LP, Bloodline, could be considered, along with Misanthrope CD by Deformity, one of the very first deathcore records in Europe. The lyrics also had this interesting duality of common straight edge topics and a much darker and apocalyptic points of view. And, with the release of their second and last LP ever, both musically and lyrically speaking, the band was more into beatdown than anything else. Finally, click on the image above for downloading their first LP. Do not miss it out since it’s such an underrated european hardcore record in the 90s. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nFirestone\n\nNote: Firestone’s profile pic on Discogs\n\nWarning: Do not confuse them with the…automobile tires brand. Damn…\n\nFirestone was a band from Kortrijk that existed sometime between 1996 and 2000. They only released Dark Fantasies tape (Not On Label; Firestone-self-released, 1996), Until You Die… – split with Spineless (Not On Label; Firestone and Spineless-self-released, 1997), Element 12″ (Sober Mind Records, 1998) and Aim For A New Tomorrow LP/CD (Genet Records, 2000). They also contributed different tracks to compilations such as Hardcore Knockout and Ephemera Of Brutality, among others.\n\nRegarding the sound, Firestone started playing hardcore in the same vein as other local « Edge Metal« -oriented counterparts, you know, the iconic sound of most of the H8000 Hardcore crew we’ve featured so far. However, some tracks have an interesting and unique « progressive » groove of their own. Their second and last LP ever also featured vocals done by a womyn, which gave a similar aura like Shortsight’s but with more emphasis on Firestone’s personal touch, teasing with other musical genres such as melodic death metal, alternative rock and experimenting with acoustic guitar and other « alien » instruments in some interludes as well. This was one of the few H8000 Hardcore-related outfits with such « experimental » approaches.\n\nFinally, Firestone disbanded some months after the release of Aim For… LP and some of their members went on to play guitar for Liar, Amenra and Oathbreaker, which have made history of their own in the post-H8000 Hardcore era in the mid-00s. Don’t forget to click on the image above for downloading both Firestone’s LPs. I couldn’t find their first tapes. Sorry, les chaton.ne.s! I owe you. Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nSpineless\n\nNote: Spineless’ profile pic on Discogs\n\nSpineless, also from Kortrijk, was formed in 1996 and they only released a self-titled demo through CMD rec. (Belgium) that year, a split with Firestone (Not On Label; Firestone and Spineless-self-released), their first and only EP ever entitled Painfields (Sober Mind Records) in 1997 and their first and only full-length album entitled …A Talk Between Me And The Stars…LP (Sober Mind Records) in 1998. Regarding their sound, Spineless played « Edge Metal » with the iconic dark-driven and apocalyptic nature of the other local west flemish hc/punk circuit back then (for example, Sektor and Firestone). However, their lyrics were overtly more deep and abstract with references to dark entities, corrupted human condition and a very pessimistic and fatidic vision of the world. Their LP also describes one near death experience of the band in a car accident so, well, things started to turn out kinda creepy…(AWESOME). The sound also was more experimental with some slight traces of sludge and post-metal, which served as a some sort of blueprint for the next big musical projects of some of Spineless’ band members such as Kingdom and Amenra. Finally, don’t forget to click on the image above for downloading both Spineless’ EP and LP. Their demo was reprinted last year by Inhale Records so, you should look for it before it goes out of stock quickly. I already warned you, les chaton.ne.s! Highly recomended. Enjoy!\n\nLifecycle\n\nNote: Photo sourced from Lifecycle’s profile pic on Discogs\n\nAs you could have seen throughout this humble entry, there wasn’t too many bands either led or completely made by womyn. Luckily, some interesting exceptions such as Shortsight and Firestone (already featured some paragraphs above) happened to exist at some point of H8000 Hardcore‘s historical evolution. Lifecycle probably was one of the last H8000 Hardcore bands in the 90s led by a womyn (BTW, I noticed that there’s in fact ANOTHER musical outfit like this one but I couldn’t find too much information about them so, I still owe you that les chaton.ne.s! Sorry in advance).\n\nLifecycle only recorded There Is Hope Again! demo (Not On Label; Lifecycle self-released, 1997) and their only full-length album entitled Forever…Until…(Sober Mind Records, 2000) and disbanded shortly afterTheir sound was akin to H8000 Hardcore standards back then but since Sofie’s vocal style was more melodic and less aggressive than the average « Edge Metal » outfits out there, they were kinda atypical reminding you thus of the good ol’ days of Shortsight in the early 90s. Their lyrical content also had a big political component dealing with topics such as the machismo in the scene, condemned child labour and the typical HC song about friendship and stuff as well. And, as a curious fact, there’s one track featuring the sounds of didgeridoo, an indigenous wind instrument from Australia, proving that H8000 Hardcore bands weren’t afraid of experimenting with « alien » instruments to hardcore/punk standards.\n\nFinally, click on the image above for downloading Lifecycle’s only full-length album ever. If you’d like to listen to/download their demo, you can visit Brob Tilt Tapes blog (run by the same person behind the Vort’n Vis In The 90s blog) by clicking here. Totally worth it. Do not miss out either this underrated and unfairly overshadowed H8000 Hardcore hidden jewel. Enjoy!\n\nCOMPILATIONS\n\nRegress No Way! 7″ compilation\n\nRegress No Way! compilation front cover\n\nFeatured bands: Shortsight, Nations On Fire, Blindfold and Spirit of Youth.\n\nThis compilation was already mentioned throughout this entry so far. So, it technically reunites the very first wave of H8000 Hardcore (simply known as 8000 Hardcore back then). The title comes from a track by american straight edge hardcore band 7 Seconds and it was the first time ever the scene used the Powerful.Political.Positive motto to describe what they were all about.\n\nNow, all the featured tracks are exclusive to this record. S.O.Y’s track, A Message, is the only studio recording featuring the same sound of their demo and the original line-up we already wrote about some paragraphs above. Shortsight’s track, On Fire, is the only official track featuring Hans on vocals before Saskia, his sister, took the wheel. Also, N.O.F’s track, On And On, would eventually be featured on their Burn Again…LP but this is a live version and not a studio one. Last but not least, Blindfold’s track, Compare And Adjust, do not appear in other record after this release. However, it was included on Live In A Simple Beauty compilation (Refuse Records (Poland), 1997), which includes some Blindfold’s live performances in Ludwigshafen, Germany (July 23rd, 1993), Deprogrammers Do Not Exist EP and World Of Fools single 7″ bundled as well. If you’d like to listen to this record, good luck. I do not have it and it was really difficult to get. I’d be very thankful (and happy) if you happen to pass me over at least the.mp3 files, les chaton.ne.s!\n\nFinally, click on the image for downloading this record. It is fairly easy to get one decent physical copy out there so, you should grab one while you can. I haven’t seen lately too many websites featuring this record as well so, you know what to do ha ha ha. You should read the lyrics of this record. They’re totally worth it.Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nInside Front – Good Life 7″ compilation (Inside Front Records (USA), 1996)\n\nGood Life 7″\n\nFeatured bands: Congress, Shortsight, Liar and Regression\n\nThis record was included on the ninth issue of Inside Front, a now-defunct zine run by Brian Dingledine (vocalist from american hardcore band Catharsis) and also served as a Good Life Recordings’ catalog sampler back at the time. These tracks are not exclusive to this record, however, since they were already featured on their respective material sources, i.e. Prayers by Congress was taken from Blackened Persistance LP, Shatter by Liar from Falls Of Torment LP, Freeze by Shortsight from Cold Wounds Waking CD, and, last but not least, Beacon by Regression, which is regarded by some people out there as H8000 Hardcore‘s de facto straight edge anthem, from Heartless CD. This is the sound of H8000 Hardcore at the zenith of its existence so, there’s no need to add more information about it.\n\nFinally, click on the image above for downloading it. There’s the insert, which contains the band’s info, lyric sheet, and some Good Life Recordings’ old ads and stuff, but I do not have the zine, however. A curious fact is that you’ll find a mention of, an upcoming compilation, back then, featuring Abhinanda, Refused (Sweden), Spawn (Germany) and Timebomb (Italy) and more but, well, ignore it. It just didn’t happen. Too bad…Highly recommended. Enjoy!\n\nH8000 Hardcore The Compilation Volume 1 LP/CD (Sober Mind Records / Genet Records, 1998)\n\nH8000 Hardcore The Compilation Vol. I LP front cover\n\nFeatured bands: Congress, Blindfold, Spineless, Liar, Hitch, Fake, ODK Crew, Vitality, Deformity, Instinct, Lifecycle, Spirit Of Youth, Sektor, Regression and Firestone.\n\nWe finally conclude this entry with this emblematic hardcore compilation. I think only featuring this record, along with the other featured compilations so far, would make a perfect H8000 Hardcore-related entry but, as I hope you already read, every featured band and record in this humble post had an unique story to be told (We tried to do our best, les chaton.ne.s!). I know some musical outfits were missing, for example, Fake, Instinct, Hitch and ODK Crew, but these ones are included on this ’98 comp (some of these bands will be back in the near future but for other purposes. Stay tuned…). This compilation was limited to only 118 copies on LP (mint green vinyl colored) and it really is scarce and diffcult to get (at least at a decent price). There’s also a CD version, which is more affordable, and with a slight different artwork.\n\nAccording to the insert included on the record, written by Hans Verbeke, this compilation gathers most of the active musical outfits at the time and remarks how H8000 Hardcore surprisingly was a thing outside of their local region, something really unbelievable for the scene at the very beginning of the decade. This record features some exclusive tracks, i.e. Mouthafter by Congress was exclusively recorded for this comp but it was later included on their Angry With The Sun LP. Enter The Devil, an exclusive track by Spineless, which only was available on their demo back then. Blindfold’s track, Spiritual Suicide ’97, is slightly different from the original one featured on their 1992 EP Deprogrammers Do Not Exist because it has the « experimental » vibe of the band since their first LP. Lifecycle’s Morbid World was taken from their 1997 demo. And, Instinct’s track, Positive Kids, is taken from a live performance at Vort’n Vis (1997 (?)) and still remains today as exclusive to this record (It’s not included on their Friendship A Lifetime Commitment discography CD, though (Braveheart Records, 2002)).\n\nRegarding the sound, the iconic mid-90s H8000 Hardcore style AKA Edge Metal is the predominant one. So, yeah, all these bands teasing with both metalcore and deathcore (and even beatdown to some extent) throughout the decade (and this post ha!) are here. However, there are some exceptions to the rule. For example, Blindfold’s unique mix of metallic hardcore, emo and post-hardcore; Hitch also teases with both emo and post-hardcore (and even alternative rock) but with some notables traits I’d like to remark to in the near future; Instinct is more akin to youth crew style, pretty much like other european contemporaries such as Highscore (Germany) and Mainstrike (Netherlands); And, last but not least, Fake is more like the lost belgian cousin of swedish heavyweights Refused and Abhinanda.\n\nFinally, click on the image for downloading the CD edition of this superb late-90s belgian hardcore compilation. The file does contain some inserts but I lost the lyrics’ sheet and Hans Verbeke’s introduction. Sorry, les chaton.ne.s! Oh, and I almost forgot. There’s a curious photo of a painted wall (probably at the old Vort’n Vis) with some graffitis complaining about the H8000 Hardcore crew, accusing them of being violent, narrow-minded and more. I think the curators of this compilation laughed at this and put it on the record as a tongue-in-cheek. You know, the 90s were another stuff. Sometimes really tough…I hope you really enjoyed this special post and will be back very soon with more quality content. Until next time. Kisses and hugs!"
