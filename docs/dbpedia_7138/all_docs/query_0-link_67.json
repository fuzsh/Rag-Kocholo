The first installment&#39;s popularity and number of downloads elevated the mix to an unimaginable level; it took approximately two weeks after its release for Vol. 1 to rival &quot;big name&quot; metal label releases. Upon searching for the most popular albums under the tags &quot;grindcore&quot;, &quot;death metal&quot;, &amp; &quot;black metal&quot; here on Bandcamp, both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 could be found within the top 5 - 10 spots. This wouldn&#39;t have ever happened without the support of the extreme metal community; it clearly consists of the greatest, most passionate fans of ANY music genre and for that we are infinitely grateful. But let&#39;s not forget none of this would have come to fruition without the bands also being enthusiastic and more supportive than anyone could ask for.\r\n\r\nWithout further adieu, Sociopathic Sound is proud to offer all of our wonderful supporters what we feel is the pinnacle of The Sociopathic Mixtape Series thus far; volume 3 consists of 81 bands who all, in one way or another, fit into the realm of &quot;extreme metal&quot;. This installment is the most comprehensive in terms of the many genres it includes, which is precisely how we hoped it would end up being. Countless hours of work was put into this and we are happy to report that EVERY single band we aspired to represent has a place on this compilation. \r\n\r\nSociopathic Mixtape, Vol. 3 is dedicated to the fans, the bands, and the extreme/underground metal community as a whole. Everyone is sure to discover many new bands who you&#39;ll no doubt fall in love with, and while it&#39;s doubtful that every single individual who downloads this mixtape will adore all 81 songs/artists, we ask that you keep an open mind while listening to the vast array of metal found herein.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that if you enjoy a particular band, follow the links we have provided to keep up to date with new happenings, tour dates, album releases, and other pertinent information which is all right at your fingertips. The vast majority of these artists have Facebook &amp; other social media pages, so go &quot;LIKE&quot; them, buy their merchandise, support them by attending shows and spreading their name amongst your friends, family, co-workers, and even the random people you meet at shows who, like all of us, are dedicated to learning about the best that the extreme metal scene has to offer. Trends may come and go, even within the spectrum of metal, but every one of the bands found on The Mixtape Series Volumes 1, 2, and 3 are here to stay, whether in their current incarnation or moving onto other projects in the same vein. \r\n\r\nPlease note the incredible effort which was put into this volume has a purpose behind it; our initial goal was to build a significant audience base prior to officially launching the main [dot com] website; it has been completed yet sitting &quot;in limbo&quot; since May, as we patiently awaited for enough fans &amp; bands to recognize the Sociopathic Sound &quot;brand&quot;. That said, this will be the final mixtape we compile for a bit of time because our focus now switches gears towards the main site. All that we have promised and more is soon to come and we hope you all continue to follow us in the pursuit of a more cohesive community; one where intellectual discourse takes precedence over inane &amp; immature arguments that only create division amongst a community that once thrived in unity, sharing a mutual and collective passion for &amp; dedication to our beloved form of music.\r\n\r\nShare this album. Support the bands, the scene, and one another. If any fan, band, label, or promotional company wishes to get in touch with Sociopathic Sound, our various email addresses are listed under the descriptions for Volumes 1 &amp; 2; you can also find us on almost every social media network out there. Most importantly, within the coming weeks, we invite you to join us at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sociopathicsound.com\r\n\r\n-The Sociopathic Team",

We are for sale! (As we kowtow), for a sale! This city is bleeding amongst the others.

Thunder! I walk into the bathroom, kneel down and honk. An eyeball rises to the surface. It stares up at me, puckers its lids, and whistles a beam of light into my stomach. 11am, I wake up face down next to the toilet. Without looking, I reach up and flush. My belly button is covered with some kind of goo. I feel the warmth of the sunlight from the window. Without hesitation, I smash it and jump through. 2pm, I'm breathing fast. Can't stop staring at the sun. Feels like it's getting darker. My stomach is swollen and I can't open my eyes., but I'm seeing something. My fingers look down, as I look up. They bury themselves in the cool dark soil. 8pm, my head is underground. With my back arched, my limbs are like the roots of an alien plant. Only my stomach remains above the earth. I feel it ripping open and suddenly I see the heavens.\n\n32.\n\nTrepan'Dead - Blocks 01:21\n\n33.\n\n34.\n\nWhite Eyes - Clockworks 01:36\n\ncog-wheels roll through frozen moments slicing up the monotonous landscapes parting earth and sky the process of decomposition initialized like flies on rotting still lifes watching and waiting... behind the horizon the final cut is made... like the beheading of god.\n\n35.\n\n36.\n\n37.\n\nFor far too long now have i been blind Living my life along the lies The life we have is but one Spend it dying! Go forth and die! Crushing noise consumes all A brutal mind attack, senses burn Innards twist and bowels churn The mask of life removed, death revealed Sweat and blood splattered everywhere The living reanimated Hailing the sound of death It brings something out. they feel alive Coupled with self-destruction Spirits ascend from their graves Obscure reality macabre an d absurd No turning back\n\n38.\n\nLycanthrophy - Primitive Game 01:01\n\n39.\n\n40.\n\nVulgar Pigeons - Spider Monkey 02:04\n\n41.\n\n42.\n\nhaarp - All, Alone 06:42\n\n43.\n\nGivethemrope - Broke 03:32\n\n44.\n\n45.\n\n46.\n\nMaruta - Devoid Of Allegiance 01:12\n\n47.\n\nWilt - Broken 02:40\n\n48.\n\nANNIHILATE! - Scheißhausaggregat 00:58\n\n49.\n\nPlague Widow - Mabus Incarnate 01:24\n\n50.\n\nTrepalium - Daddy's Happy 04:12\n\nPsychologist / Priest / Politician / Trepalium / You / Me, In need of extreme sensations You can fuck your dirty life.

Eating your fucking shit After pissing on my life Like me after washing hands covered in spit! Making money for the god of profit Buying (your) security from society's greed What will I eat today, while the children Are dying from hunger! Learn to respect everybody and commit suicide In the silence of a school learn to glorify yourself Preach the morals that apply to everyone but you The pathetic embodiment of a silly jerk deified!

Rooting for their favorite teams, They pin their lost dreams, Their feelings of inadequacy gives authority to sports stars, As the game hangs in the balance...so does happiness Opposing teams symbolize the obstacles in life that prevent you from attaining your concept of success... You hate them...the NFL commands you! Fill our stadiums or....your dreams will not be televised. Ticket prices justified by people's need for paragons, Fans, They love to deify...giving way to enormous salaries, Life passes you by as a spectator, If your team loses....blame follows anger.\n\n60.\n\nAngkara - Ambang Kematian 03:30\n\nambang kematian didepan mata dengan sedikit waktu menjemput ajal dunia sudah kelam tertimbun dosa alam memberi tanda dunia kan binasa satu per satu tanda akhir jaman telah datang kini kuberpijak (2X) pada poros kematian kita semua akan binasa dunia gelap yang berkobar dan berkuasa murka dusta dosa zina menjadi sekutu sang setan pertempuran kekal setan malaikat takkan berakhir biarkan diri ini terbang melayang diatas kemurkaan tuhan\n\n61.\n\n62.\n\n63.\n\n64.\n\nhydrogen depletes, critical level breached insufficient heat, longing for defeat ignition, ascension multiplying gravity unattainable escape velocity second law, maximum entropy frozen energy nothing further can be extracted space and time distortions annihilation is mutual growing near, blackened sphere light disappears, constant state of fear as I cross the radius staring into emptiness passing through the esophagus reversal of time reilluminate I regain my hate watching myself fall the greatest joy of all\n\n65.\n\n66.\n\n67.\n\nIncrüst - Free Mankind 04:22\n\n68.\n\nKuru - End Of Days 04:25\n\n69.\n\n70.\n\nTiger Flowers - Last Horse 06:53\n\n71.\n\nZaar - ABKEHR (05) 02:18\n\n72.\n\n\"do me this favor kid while we rip off her clothes take this toxic liquid substance and stuff it up her nose don't be shy you little shit you have to become one!\" NIGHT'S APPARATUS, THE NIGHT'S APPARATUS fuck this farce it's time I seize my knife rescuing isn't enough the quenching lust is ripe no sacrifices have been made no no no punishment is delayed \"do me this favor kid while we rip off her clothes take this toxic liquid substance and stuff it up her nose don't be shy you little shit you have to become one!\" NIGHT'S APPARATUS, THE NIGHT'S APPARATUS twisting necks - contort limbs - now throw him off the tower\n\n73.\n\nNew Blood - In Obscurity 04:01\n\nFlesh grips flesh | Illusion | Some kind of conceit | Behind the fixed stone ocular | A prophesy of vile obscurity | Sinew drapes from menial cartilage | A fantasy of bile disgorge | An acute connected | Deep seeded affliction | To possess and divest the servile and pitiful | Carve the hate | Sculpt the mass | Create the end | Pride discern | Flesh grinding flesh and blood runs cold | Flood the wound with distaste | Monotonous voracity | Perpetual excess | Born from bone here I stay in obscurity | Bound by blood here I breath in obscurity | Carve the hate | Sculpt the mass | Create the end | Pride discern\n\n74.\n\nBIIPIIGWAN - Rhett 02:08\n\n75.\n\nDehuman - Cast Of Assassination 03:58\n\n76.\n\n77.\n\nIrate Architect - Lonesome Girl 02:45\n\n78.\n\nCo-Exist - Pulling Teeth 02:21\n\n79.\n\n80.\n\nPope Benedict - Confeso Diaz 02:36"
