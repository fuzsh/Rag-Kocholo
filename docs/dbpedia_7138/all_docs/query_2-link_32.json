If you've heard any of their earlier records, you should know what your in for. Straight-up rock n' roll that could have easily been plucked right out of the late '70s. Fast Songs Is All We Know, falls right in line with the sloppy, wasted likes of the MC5, Stooges and Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers. The Born Liars never met a raucous gang chorus or ear-splitting Chuck Berry on heroin riff that they didn't like, and this album offers up eleven short, sharp testimonials to the power of hair gel, muscle cars, cheap beer and jeans worn for three straight weeks. And let's face it, ain't that what Rock N Roll is all about? Includes A Digital Download Card! 11 Songs.\n\nSOLD OUT\n\nTHE CANDY SNATCHERS \"Human Zoo\" Lp (Go Kart) $8.99\n\nSeventeen rippin' rockin' tracks From everyones favorite snatchers! Yeah!

The audio equivolent of getting hit in the head with a beer bottle. SOLD OUT\n\nTHE CANNIBALS \"Suburban Sex\" 7\" (Cowabunga) $2.99\n\nCool record if you love Garage punk as well as early 80's Southern Cali punk. This band consists of members of Harry Balzagna and the Teenie Weenies, Walking Wreck, and Street Trash- but the only band they carry any influence from is Walking Wreck, as this is still different from any of those bands. Somewhere in the sound it's like older Black Flag and the Middle Class 7\" meets garage rock blended with some surf too! The recording is very lo fi too, which adds to the feel of it.\n\nTHE CLAP \"The Night The Condom Broke\" CD $3.99 (Fraud)\n\nSing-along toilet humor punkrock for the non PC crowd. 12 songs.\n\nTHE FEDS \"Classified\" 7\" $3.99 (Dr Strange)\n\nFast pop-punk from Chicago featuring the guitar player from The Bollweevils.\n\nTHE FIX \"At The Speed Of Twisted Thought\" LP (Touch & Go) $13.49\n\nFrom one of the first bands signed by Touch And Go come these early recordings, re-released and repackaged, in honor of the label's 25th anniversary.

The Freeze were an integral part of the early Boston scene, but played a more melodic, punk rock influenced brand of hardcore. This is a Re-Release. Packaged with a HUGE color poster with lyrics and band info.\n\nTHE FREEZE/BOLLWEEVILS \"Split\" 10\" $6.99 (Dr Strange)\n\n1996 split release. The Freeze rip through 4 songs on their side.

Originally released in 2008 on Riff Raff records, Grave Mistake has been given the honor to handle the repress to coincide with their two new venomous singles on No Way and Cowabunga Records. Raw and obnoxious yet catchy as well, reminiscent of early DWARVES, with a couple of short and fast rippers thrown in to keep the crowd moving and the beer flying. Five obscene and insulting punk anthems guaranteed to hurt someones feelings.\n\nTHE LADIES \"Six More Reasons To Hate\" 7\" (Grave Mistake) $3.99 Pink Vinyl\n\nTo love The Ladies is to hate The Ladies, and here are six more damn fine reasons to do both. On their fourth 7\", Tony Bitch and Co. bring you six more blistering tracks of sleazy and infectious punk rock gems drenched in early Dwarves worship (which you've probably come to expect if you've checked out any of their other records), with a little extra dose of melody mixed in for good measure. Hands down their best release to date, and best looking too ... slick pink and purple double sided layout with the required amount of smutty imagery; trashy and classy at the same time.

The band is a mixture of hardcore and punk, turning their music into a sound very reminiscent of the early 80's.

Lyrics included.\n\nTHE STUPOR STARS \"Poison Arrows b/w Don't Fight Us/Hey Maita\" 7\" (Pelado) $3.99\n\nWow. There are a ton of bands that play old skewl '77-style punk rock. Very few of those bands, however, manage to go much beyond imitating the sound and actually capture the spirit of those old bands. Maybe it's because today's bands are more talented or maybe it's because recording techniques have evolved to make even low-budget recordings sound overproduced. In any case, the Stupor Stars have definitely broken that mold. Not only are these songs catchy and melodic, they are also full of energy and soul. Both songs will have you bouncing your head, wondering which is the A-side, and begging for more. This is good shit, really good shit. - Maximum RnR\n\nTHE TWATS/RETCHING RED \"Split\" 7\" $3.99 (Overdose On Records) RED/WHITE VINYL\n\nTHE TWATS kick out their 3rd release with 3 unreleased songs, one year after their formation. Straight from DC, The Twats bring it back to the 80's hardcore style with lyrics that range from sarcastic to heartfelt to witty. RETCHING RED is a Bay Area hardcore punk band that formed in August 2004. Retching Red members are no amateurs at this game. Female vocalist CINDER BLOCK is formerly from the world renowned punk band TILT, among many others since 1983. She also sang in FABULOUS DISASTER for a 6 month stint in 2003. Cinder holds no prisoners in this band and she's pissed! While bassist MIKE CYCO LOCO also sings in the long lasting notorious OPPRESSED LOGIC and has been in a fuckload of bands like ANGRY SAMOANS, STRUNG UP, LAST ROUND UP and many others since 1986. This is Retching Red's last release! SOLD OUT\n\nTHE VANDALS \"Peace Thru Vandalism\" LP (Chi-Com) $12.49\n\nAs poster boys of the original Huntington Beach, CA punk rock scene in the very early '80s, The Vandals' debut release provided the soundtrack for an era of mayhem and mindless rebellion for tens of thousands of bored teenagers from the suburbs to the 'hood. It started with \"Urban Struggle\" going from Rodney Bingenheimer's Top 10 to #1 on KROQ's mainstream playlist in L.A. When The Vandals performed \"The Legend Of Pat Brown\" in Roger Corman's 1983 classic film \"Suburbia,\" the EP became a must-have for punks all over the world. SOLD OUT\n\nTHE VANDALS \"Peace Thru Vandalism\" LP PICTURE DISC (Chi-Chom) $19.99\n\nAs poster boys of the original Huntington Beach, CA punk rock scene in the very early '80s, The Vandals debut release provided the soundtrack for an era of mayhem and mindless rebellion for tens of thousands of bored teenagers from the suburbs to the hood. It started with \"Urban Struggle\" going from Rodney Bingenheimer's Top 10 to #1 on KROQ's mainstream playlist in L.A. When The Vandals performed \"The Legend Of Pat Brown\" in Roger Corman's 1983 classic film, \"Suburbia,\" the EP became a must have for punks all over the world.\n\nTHE VANDALS \"When In Rome Do As The Vandals\" LP (Chi-Chom) $14.03\n\nThis is the miraculous follow-up to the classic EP \"Peace Thru Vandalism.\" We call it miraculous because after achieving the impossible by making their first EP on Epitaph Records into a radio smash, they defied all odds by doing the exact same thing, but even bigger, on their second try with \"Lady Killer\" climbing to the top of the alternative radio charts and actually finishing higher than songs like Billy Idol's \"Rebel Yell\" on KROQ's top 106 songs for 1984. Produced by Thom Wilson (TSOL, Adolescents, Offspring).\n\nTHE VARUKERS \"One Struggle, One Fight\" LP (Havoc) $9.49\n\nHavoc rep ress of this long out of print Lp from 1985. Varukers were one of the best English bands of the 80s. Their early 80's material was a great mix of Discharge and slightly more punk bands like One Way System or the Partisans. This LP saw the Varukers heading into a much heavier more hardcore and metal influenced direction. This LP was very much in step with the tenor of the times coming out in 1985 it's hardcore punk meets metal sound put it on par with contemporary bands like Antisystem and Antisect. The Varukers broke up soon after this LP, only to reform in the 90's and are still going strong today.\n\nTHE VICTORIA PRINCIPLE \"Mis en Scens\" CD $1.99 (Ruido Union) SALE!!!\n\nTwisted experimental rock from Richmond, Va. Has some Fugazi like qualities to it. Lots of jams.\n\nTHE WEIRDOS \"We Got The Neutron Bomb\" LP (Frontier) 12.99 PURPLE VINYL\n\nIn early 1977 The Weirdos's mighty sound and singular style were the Big Bang igniting the LA punk scene. After legendary records on Bomp, Dangerhouse and Rhino, The Weirdos released Weird World Volume 2: We Got the Neutron Bomb is a collection of rare studio and live recordings from their own private bomb shelter celebrating Weirdo year 26, proof that great things come to those who wait. There is time, and there is Timeless....\n\nTHROWRAG \"Desert Shores\" LP (BYO) $9.49\n\nThrow Rag has a fiercely loyal fan base, growing college radio play and has received accolades from everyone from The Reverend Horton Heat to Chris Isaak, and from Flogging Molly to The Misfits! In the past few years the boys have shared the stage with such rock luminaries as The Misfits, X, Flogging Molly, The Supersuckers, The Toilet Boys, NOFX, Motorhead, Social Distortion, Willie Nelson, Rocket From The Crypt, Royal Crown Revue, The Humpers, Dick Dale, El Vez, Andre Williams, Green Day, Mike Watt, Weezer, The Damned, The Dickies, Wesley Willis, The Dwarves, T.S.O.L., Youth Brigade, Nashville Pussy, The Cadillac Tramps and many others, picking up an army of new fans and media fascination along the way, proving that Throw Rag is America's rock and roll band. 12 Songs.\n\nTHROW RAG \"13 Ft. And Rising\" LP (BYO) $9.49\n\n\"This LP kicks off with an intro similar to that of the Sex Pistols Holidays in the Sun.\" If you're going to start your album with that reference, you'd better be able to back it up, and likewise, Throw Rag's history of great live shows threatens to make any studio album a letdown. But 13 Ft. and Rising lives up to all those challenges. Dino, the guitarist, moves easily from punk to country and back, but the musical core of this album is a series of wonderfully sleazy-sounding riffs that recall the best of Link Wray. The lyrics jump quickly from one subject to the next, like rants of an overheated mind, and Captain Sean Doe's vocals strain to stretch out the most painful parts of the songs. Jacko, possibly the only washboard player/bugler in rock, sings lead on a couple tracks and makes the most of the opportunity, especially on the visceral \"Rotten Me.\" There are also guest appearances by Jello Biafra and Lemmy from Motorhead, but the most memorable cameo is Keith Morris's mix of singing and spoken word on the final track, \"Children of the Secret State.\" Throw Rag's second album, Desert Shores, remains the band's best, but this is a great follow-up to that savagely brilliant record. -Razorcake\n\nTIDAL / ACABAH ROT \"Split\" LP $9.99 (Ignition)\n\nHarsh and powerful emotional, screamed, metallic hardcore. Tidal are kicking ass all over Europe right now and they're getting better at it by the day - this is their newest stuff and it's shared with their friends Acabah Rot who also play a serious screamed hardcore mix attack! German\n\nTIME TO ESCAPE \"S/T\" 7\" (Grave Mistake) $3.99\n\nWashington DC's TIME TO ESCAPE tear through five tracks no frills DC HARDCORE akin to early GOVERNMENT ISSUE or THE FAITH. Originally recorded as a demo with about 200 circulated, these tracks ripped too hard to fade into demo tape obscurity ... so here they are remastered and in vinyl format. Proof that our nation's capital can still churn out the fast, seething, pissed off hardcore that put it on the map in the first place. FOURTH PRESS HAND NUMBERED OUT OF 500.\n\nTOO DIE FOR \"Still Searching\" MCD $1.99 (Vacation House)\n\nItalian Starts off with a sample from Taxi Driver. Manic hardcore with a metal edge and screamed vocals. Fast paced with heavy breakdowns. 5 songs.\n\nTOXIC REASONS \"Independence\" LP (Beer City) $11.49\n\nBack in the early 80s. A group of guys from the Midwest started a band that mixed the newly developing offshoot of punk known as hardcore along with the already established sound of English punk. What they got was an excellent sound that no one at the time was doing. After many practices and shows and tours with other soon to be legendary bands like The Dead Kennedys, Verbal Abuse, MDC plus many more. Toxic Reasons recorded their first full length. Thus the now legendary 'INDEPENDENCE' was born. This full-length contains brand new art work as well a huge poster available with the LP.SOLD OUT\n\nTRAGEDY/TOTALITAR \"Split\" 7\" (Armageddon) $5.99\n\nA classic in the making, each group gives up two songs for this split.

SOLD OUT\n\nTSOL \"Dance With Me\" LP (Nitro) $11.49 GREY MARBLE VINYL\n\nNitro Records presents the reissue of the early '80s punk masterpiece \"Dance With Me\" from Southern California's own TSOL. This full-length has been remastered but features all of the original artwork as the original pressing. On this album, TSOL moved away from the political leanings of their earlier material and took on a darker sound and style as apparent on the hit song \"Code Blue,\" an ode to necrophilia. SOLD OUT\n\nTSOL \"Thoughts Of Yesterday\" LP $9.50 (Posh Boy)\n\nEarly recordings 1981-82. 10 songs that sound just as good today as back then. Essential.

SOLD OUT!\n\nUNDERDOG \"Matchless\" 2xLP (Bridge 9) $15.99 Blue Vinyl\n\nUnderdog has been a staple in the hardcore scene since their inception in the 1980's and the release of \"Matchless\" will further cement the impact that the band had upon the world. The two key constant elements of Underdog during its span of four years were Richie Birkenhead (vocals) and Russ \"Wheeler\" Iglay (bass) who decided to form a band while talking at CBGB in 1985.

Featuring Pat Dubar and Patrick Longrie (of UNITY), this band was the West Coast's answer to MINOR THREAT, and played a strong influence on NO FOR AN ANSWER and INSTED, as well as the rest of the O.C. hardcore scene. 14 songs.\n\nUNITED SUPER VILLIANS \"Escapist\" 7\" $3.50 (Havoc)\n\nCrucial fast HC similar to old Boston bands like DYS, Siege and SSD.\n\nUNSEEN FORCE \"In Search Of The Truth\" LP (No Way) $8.99\n\nFinally, this mid 80's Richmond, VA Hardcore Punk Masterpiece sees the light of day again!

Hardcore for the hardcore, get in or get out!\n\nURBAN WASTE \"S/T\" LP (MATW) $11.99\n\nA re-issue of the sole EP by one of the most sought after and enigmatic bands from the earliest days of New York hardcore. Despite the obscurity of the original release, Urban Waste was made famous through their signature style of blown-out, over the top hardcore punk replete with trademark menacing buzzsaw guitars and piercing vocals. This is an official release. Now available again on vinyl. 12\"ep includes free MP3 download of the entire album.\n\nUROTSUKIDOJI / WINTER IN JUNE Split CD $9.99 (Ignition)\n\nUrot - Full of aggression and intelligent harmonies. Imagine the speed of American Nightmare played with the diversity of PMFS fused and layered withthe angry, intense vocals of Engrave or Converge. WIJ - Imagine the old school / new school mixed styling of Bane built up to incredible, tight and rhythmic breakdowns that bring To Die For and the heavier side of Boy Sets Fire. Boston/Bridge Nine style hardcore!\n\nVERBAL ABUSE \"Rocks Your Liver\" LP (Malt Soda) $13.49 COLOR VINYL\n\nThe second LP from Verbal Abuse, \"Rocks Your Liver,\" is once again available on vinyl. This 1986 LP started to see a rock influence creep into the band's manic punk sound but didn't skimp on the fun, partying attitude the band brought on their classic debut, \"Just An American Band.\" 13 Songs. SOLD OUT\n\nVICTIMS \"A Dissident\" LP (Tankcrimes) $13.99\n\n\"A Dissident\" is the latest album from Victims, recorded by Linus Wiklund with assistance from Nicko from Entombed. When the first chords of opener \"Theft\" interrupt the album's haunting intro, it's apparent that the years under their belts have only allowed Victims to become even more charged. Victims' unrelenting ferocity, unforgettable choruses and Swedish quest for perfection has pushed the blueprint of their influences (Motorhead, Discharge, etc.) to a new contemporary level. AWESOME Gate-Fold Jacket! This LP is NOT Sealed! 13 Songs.\n\nVICTIMS \"Divide And Conquer\" LP $8.99 (Havoc)\n\nSweden's Victims deliver the goods on \"Divide And Conquer,\" their third full length. They flawlessly mix early '80s American hardcore and Swedish crust and rise to the challenge of mixing two such potent styles with great vigor. Prevalent are the smoking guitar work from Jon Lindqvist (also of Accursed, Nasum, Saayadina, etc.) and Johan's vocals which sound like he has been gargling with napalm.\n\nVICTIMS \"In Blood\" LP $8.99 (Havoc)\n\nCrushing Swedish hardcore like Skitsystem or Wolf Brigade, but with more of a hardcore/thrash influence than crust or metal. Includes US tour poster. SOLD OUT\n\nVICTIMS \"Killer\" LP $8.99 (Havoc)\n\nVictims have been the front of Swedish hardcore for many years mixing traditional Swedish D Beat and Crust sounds with more straight forward American hardcore influences. This LP has all the tight and crushing arrangements you'd expect from this crew. A few more songs leaning towards the \"d beat rocknroll\" end of hardcore, but over all very much in the same punishing tradition of the last two LPs. LimitedSOLD OUT\n\nVICTIMS/FROM ASHES RISE \"Split\" LP (Havoc) $8.99\n\nFrom Ashes Rise plays dark, slightly metallic hardcore that is not unlike early His Hero Is Gone mixed with Scandinavian hardcore like Skitystem and 80's UK crust like Antisect. Drawing on those influences From Ashes Rise has moved this sound into it's own territory so to simply label it \"Tennessee style\" hardcore would be oversimplifying their sonic progression. Victims from Sweden play aggressive fast Scandinavian hardcore not unlike early Skitsystem or Wolfbrigade. You can hear the influence of early Swedish hardcore like Anti-Cimex, Shitlickers and Crude SS mixed with the heavier sounds of 90's crust core, but there is also some influence from the early 80's US hardcore sound. PUSHEAD Cover Artwork!\n\nVILE NATION \"No Exit\" 7\" (Cowabunga) $4.25\n\nDebut EP from Memphis' TN own Vile Nation. Very mean and ugly fast thrash hardcore with a heavy dose of punk. One can't listen to this and not hear the 1st 7\" era of D.R.I and Negative FX and bands of that same time frame and caliber being channeled here. Chris just spews the words out mean and fast and the band keeps up. The guitar player from Life Trap also plays in this band, but honestly DON'T buy it for that reason, this band kicks a ton of ass without that bit of know how. Words can't describe how utterly amazing this record is, its just great great great! SOLD OUT\n\nVITAMIN X \"Bad Trip\" LP $8.99 (Havoc)\n\nThird LP, wicked fast hardcore. Str8 edge thrash. Includes Huge Poster!\n\nVITAMIN X - \"Down The Drain\" LP $8.99 (Havoc)\n\nVitamin X is back with their fastest hardest material yet.

More political SE lyrics, many dealing with the battle of the individual against conformist society. SOLD OUT\n\nVITAMIN X \"Full Scale Assault\" Gate-Fold LP (Tank Crimes) $12.49\n\nAfter touring throughout the world, Dutch hardcore punk giants Vitamin X return with their first recorded output in 3 years. Finally capturing the manic aggression of their notorious live shows while truely showcasing their songwriting skills and musicianship. VX take their furious hardcore sound even further into the realms of 70's rock riffage and wild guitar solos, never letting up on the high energy thrash punk. Recorded and Engineered at Electrical Audio Studios in Chicago by Steve Albini (Nirvana, Neurosis) it has an enormous sound. The album features lead vocals by Negative Approach's John Brannon on 2 songs and amazing artwork by John Baizley (Baroness, Pig Destroyer). This is a serious hardcore masterpiece. LP packaged in a gatefold jacket including printed card stock dust sleeve insert and gatefold poster.\n\nVITAMIN X \"Rip It Out\" 7\" $3.99 (Havoc)\n\nVitamin X takes their tried and true thrash sound to the next level. Building in the direction they were headed with the Bad Trip LP this 7\" mixes full on thrash with some wild 70's rock riffs and leads. Before you think this is another \"how we rock\" or \"fire and ice\" you better chill out and recognize, it's still fast and furious, just with some wild and unique guitar work from Marc that's influenced by 70's hard rock. Essential for die hard fans or people who have never heard Vitamin X before. SOLD OUT\n\nVOETSEK \"Tinea Circus\" 7\" (Six Weeks) $3.99\n\nDark brooding vile thrash out of the Bay Area ala Septic Death!! These gals and guys donÍt fuk around, laying all to waste in 10 minutes with 11 bruising assaults and a ENT cover song. Recorded by Noah Landis (Neurosis/Christ On Parade) this EP is loaded, with intent to kill!!! SOLD OUT\n\nVOID \"Sessions 1981-83\" LP (Dischord) $11.49\n\nWhile organizing the Dischord archive, they came across the 4-track of Void's first recording session. This was done at Hit And Run Studios in November 1981 and never officially released. The master tape was nowhere to be found so the tape was remixed by Ian MacKaye and Don Zientara at Inner Ear in 2011. This release features that entire session plus their first Inner Ear demo including the \"Flex Your Head\" cuts and song that ended up on the \"Condensed Flesh\" 7\", two outtakes from their second Inner Ear session and a couple of live recordings. Vinyl version includes free album download.\n\nVOORHEES \"13\" LP (Six Weeks) $7.99\n\nRelentless UK power violence attack. Released 1999. Sixteen tracks of raw, blistering splenetic and frenetic hardcore in the space of 18 minutes - so the chances of Voorhees making a lengthy emo concept album are still refreshingly remote. Which is good news for their fans, who number Agnostic Front's Roger Miret among a host of others. Vocalist Lecky has also been busy of late with his other band, metalcore straightedgers Withdrawn, who recently played with Integrity. Check out Night of the Crabs for the perfect 9 second wake up call.\n\nVORTICE CREMISI \"S/T\" MCD $1.99 (Vacation House) Italian\n\n3 guys and a gal playing some very cool stoner rock type stuff. Lots of cool riffs and changes.\n\nV.P.R. \"Aural Assault\" CD $7.99 (Squirrel Heart)\n\n\"There are 15 choice cuts on this record, all emanating a strong punk quality, with some light melodic overtones and very obvious hardcore infuences. Don't expect 5 minutes long drop-D breakdowns, VPR don't fuck around. I like how each song sounds fresh and different from the rest. Also, track 15 is actually VPR's rendition of Homer Simpson's classic \"When I was 17\" song, gotta love it.\" - QCHC News...\n\nWAR KRIME \"Get Loose\" LP $8.99 (No Way)\n\nWarkrime returns with their shenanigans for a full-length LP with 14 songs of hardcore punk that draws comparisons to B'last!, Septic Death and Attitude Adjustment.

SOLD OUT\n\nWARKRIME \"Give War A Chance\" 7\" $3.99 (No Way)\n\nWarkrime bring forth 9 songs of thrashy in your face hardcore punk. Raw, Mean, and sure to stir up some trouble. Warkrime makes us here think back to bands like Articles of Faith, Septic Death, United Mutation, and even the Accused. So you might get a little idea from that....It's Sick. Great Old School cover art and feel to this record as well. SOLD OUT!\n\nWARZONE \"Fight For Justice\" Pic Disc LP (Victory) $16.99\n\nWarzone was an American hardcore punk band formed on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1982. The band helped develop the New York hardcore sound, the hardcore skinhead style and the youth crew subgenre. During the band's 15 years and many line-up changes, their primarily hardcore sound was flavored by influences ranging from Oi! (they toured several times with The Business and played a cover of their song The Real Enemy), to traditional punk rock. This is the Last Studio album from the band. Released in 1997. RIP Raybeez. SOLD OUT\n\nWARZONE \"Old School To New School\" (Victory) $12.99 Blue Vinyl\n\nTheir first album after the departure from their hardcore sound that was the self-titled record, \"Old School To New School\" features six tracks that were new to this release, an alternate version of \"Crazy But Not Insane\" and a few tracks recorded live at CBGB in 1992.

It has a few similarities of the 7\", but it still stands alone! The bands' personal choice of music/hardcore they like is pretty obvious of influence on this record-somewhere between Infest, Think I Care, various NYHC, old metal, sludge and Youth of Today and they bring on the mosh along with the PISSED lyrics only John could write. This is actually a pretty original sounding LP and if you like your hardcore varied, usually fast and mad, def check this LP out! NOW in its 2nd press with an updated cover that has a blue color font on the front, updated insert and correct track listing on the back to tell the difference between pressings. SOLD OUT\n\nWEEKEND NACHOS \"Unforgiveable\" LP (Deep Six) $8.99 RED VINYL!\n\nThe 2nd full-length release from Chicago's Weekend Nachos. Unquestionably the hardest and heaviest album of theirs to date, \"Unforgivable\" reflects on some deeper and less specific topics while all focusing on the same common theme: pure hatred and disgust for anything and everything that has ever existed. This record is an absolute must for anyone ready to share some pain and rage to 23 minutes of the realest hardcore out there right now.SOLD OUT\n\nWEEKEND NACHOS \"Worthless\" LP (Deep Six) $8.99\n\nOn \"Worthless,\" Weekend Nachos display some of the most technical, thrashing moments of unadulterated powerviolence, as well as the thickest, most crushing riffs heard from them yet. What makes them even better is the schizophrenic weaving of these two styles that the group so swiftly pulls off. Songs like \"Frostbitten\" demonstrate this with perfection, transitioning unexpectedly from ominous guitar chugs into a fast array of D-beats and a mix of high-pitched screams and classic Weekend Nachos vocals. 14 Songs. SOLD OUT\n\nWEEKEND NACHOS/LACK OF INTEREST \"Split\" 7\" (Deep Six) $4.99\n\nRelative newcomers Weekend Nachos and the legendary Lack Of Interest combine on this 7\", representing two generations of gnarled powerviolence on one split.\n\nWHATEVER \"Snack Time\" 7\" $3.99 (Dr Strange)\n\nMelodic punk from Chicago.

Been done before? Sure. Being done now? Yup. But, how many do it well and can really write great songs? Enter the new heroes of hardcore... Where Fear And Weapons Meet. The latest band from Flroida, bringing a classic and powerful sound to Revelation on this, their first release.\n\nWHERE FEAR AND WEAPONS MEET \"The Weapon\" CD $11.99 (Revelation)\n\nAt home in Florida with Jeremy Staska (Morning Again, Shai Hulud, etc) manning the controls, The Weapon was recorded fast and raw, true to the nature of the band. And the fifteen tracks on the album showcase exactly what has made this four-piece so popular: high energy and great songs that are hardcore without severing its roots in punk rock. It's impossible to categorize Where Fear And Weapons Meet. They're not a \"metal hardcore\" band, a \"youth crew\" hardcore band, or a \"pop-punk\" hardcore band. They do what they do and they do it better than most. With this band, what you see is what you get. And what you'll see is simple... hardcore that is positive, but can rip your face off. If you think that sounds funny, give The Weapon a spin and you'll see what we're talking about. -Rev Website\n\nWHISKEY SUNDAY \"S/T\" CD $3.99 (Ancestor)\n\nDrunk Rock Punk from San Jose. 15 songs.\n\nWHITE FLAG \"Skate Across Europe\" 7\" (Mystic) $14.99 ORIGINAL PRESSING!\n\nRecorded On White Flag's European Tour May/June 1986.

SOLD OUT\n\nZERO BOYS \"History Of\" LP (SC) $14.95\n\nFrom 1979 into 1983, the Indianapolis based Zero Boys were the finest hardcore blitz in the Midwest if not all the lower 48 states. Proof is \"Vicious Circle\" and the two decades since of copyists, bootleggers, practitioners and reunion concert pogoers. Though before and after that LP's 1982 release they recorded the \"Livin' In The '80s\" 7\", songs for three comps and released the post-mortem \"History Of...\" cassette revealing their transformation into a toured band warming to the metaphysical and their demise while still waving torches of rock 'n' roll panache. Those tracks not on the \"Vicious Circle\" LP all appear on this collection. Vinyl version includes a coupon that for a limited time allows you to download MP3 audio files of the recordings.\n\nZERO BOYS \"Viscious Circle\" LP (SC) $13.99\n\nIt came out of nowhere in 1982, this punk rock/hardcore fireball with the bright yellow sleeve. In one sense, The Zero Boys' Vicious Circle was yet another example of how U.S. punk seemed to peak coast to coast that year. But unlike most coastal punk, the Zero Boys were pointing the way to a scene that could accommodate heaping helpings of melody, intelligence, and rock 'n' roll, not just turbo-charged ferocity. Vinyl version contains a coupon that for a limited time allows you to download MP3 audio files of the recordings.
