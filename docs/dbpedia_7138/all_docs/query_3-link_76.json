        "text": "How did we get here?\n\nI could have sworn that I thought Syracuse New York’s Molly D’Ago was aiming at the Paramore audience, now with her country-rock-pop single My Sweet Burning Heart she has set her sights on the Taylor Swift-ees as well, and it is always impressive whenever I see such creative range in an artist and hats off to Molly for straddling both genres so effortlessly.\n\nRecently teaming up with Pepper Gomez and signing to her heavy-hitting record label Wake Up! Music, Molly has clearly found her place to freely try new creative things and spread her artistic wings. My Sweet Burning Heart comes off as a simple-enough track that leans heavily on the deep message woven within the emotional lyrics and rising chorus, but it’s when the electric guitar comes in alongside the slide guitar that the song elevates to a truly special place, and you can tell that this song is dripping with authenticity; which I require as a listener if I am to care about a song in any way, shape, or form.\n\nWhat Molly does so well is create music that takes the listener on a personal journey, asking them to look inside on reflect on their own potentially similar experiences. Each song feels like a diary entry shared between old friends, it’s raw, it’s real, and it’s always introspective. For many, their first experience with Molly D’Ago’s music is her previous hit single End of the World, and I will give you the heads up, this one may be a world apart in sound, but for as soft as it can be it still hits just as hard.\n\nIt is great to see the talented Molly D’Ago resurface again with something as fresh as this new single, and from what I have heard Molly is just getting started!"
