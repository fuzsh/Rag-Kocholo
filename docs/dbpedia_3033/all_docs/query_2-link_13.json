        "text": "A corporate name used as an authorized access point. The access point is assigned according to various cataloging rules to give access to the bibliographic record from corporate names. Corporate names are the names of agencies, associations, businesses, firms, governments, institutions, nonprofit enterprises, performing groups, etc.\n\nA corporate name can appear alone or in conjunction with a subordinate corporate name, a form or subject subheading, and/or a title of a work entered under the name of a jurisdiction or other corporate body. A name of a jurisdiction that represents an ecclesiastical entity is a corporate name.\n\nFor information about conference or meeting names entered directly under its own name, see Meeting Names--General Information.\n\nUse for the following types of corporate names:\n\nOrganized bodies entered directly under their own names\n\nOrganized bodies entered indirectly under names of political jurisdictions\n\nPolitical jurisdictions standing alone in non-subject access point fields\n\nSpecial corporate names, such as names of abbeys, cathedrals, churches, denominations, monasteries, missions, musical groups, parishes, priories, programs, studies, and vessels (e.g., Catholic Church, Dire Straits (Musical group), Monasterio Las Descalzas (Lima, Peru), New York Philharmonic, or Writers' Program)\n\nNames of conferences, conventions, exhibitions, expeditions, festivals, and meetings entered indirectly, that is, under the name of a corporate body (e.g., Labour Party (Great Britain). Conference)\n\nOCLC also makes available nonstandard MARC fields to use for additional access points not supported by cataloging rules (e.g., donor or gift information or variant form). Enter information in fields 697, 791, 797, or 897 as you would in the corresponding standard MARC fields. These fields are not retained in the WorldCat record. However, they are retained in exported records and records delivered via other services.\n\nThis page does not cover the title portion of name/title access points. Refer to the Preferred Titles--General Information for further information on constructing title access points and title related subfields.\n\nFor information on punctuation, see the Punctuation section below.\n\nGuidelines and links to guidelines for applying all content designators are given below. A field-specific list of content designators and guidelines for applying the 1st and 2nd indicator position are provided under the description for fields that contain a corporate body.\n\nFor current cataloging, construct corporate body access points according to Resource Description and Access (RDA), Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition (AACR2), Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), and Library of Congress/Program for Cooperative Cataloging (LC/PCC) practice. Search the OCLC Authority File to verify the forms of the authorized access points. Use the current RDA, AACR2, or AACR2-compatible forms of the authorized access points. If an access point is not found, construct the access point according to RDA or AACR2.\n\nFor retrospective cataloging, search the OCLC Authority File to verify the forms of the authorized access points. Use the current RDA, AACR2, or AACR2-compatible forms of the authorized access points. If an access point is not found, you may enter the pre-RDA form, but you are encouraged to construct the access point according to RDA or AACR2.\n\nFor help in coding ambiguous access points, see the Subject Headings Manual, H 405. Jurisdictions will appear in the authority file in field 151 but when used as descriptive access points they will be coded with an x10 with a 1st indicator 1.\n\nName of a corporate body or the first entity when subordinate units are present; a jurisdiction name under which a corporate body or title of a work is entered; or a jurisdiction name that is also an ecclesiastical entity.\n\n110 2 Â David Chipperfield Architects, Çe architect\n\n610 2 0Â United Nations Council for Namibia\n\n710 2 Â Universidade de Lisboa, Çe issuing body\n\nParenthetical qualifying information pertaining to the corporate name such as jurisdiction names or dates (other than the date of a meeting) are included in subfield Ça.

Prefer terms taken from a controlled vocabulary such as RDA Appendix I.\n\nIf more than one relator term is appropriate because the same entity has multiple roles, add relator terms in WEMI order (i.e., work, expression, manifestation, item). For more information, see the PCC Training Manual for Applying Relationship Designators in Bibliographic Records.\n\nRelator terms in subfield Çe and relator codes in subfield Ç4, each specifying a relationship of a corporate name to a work, may be included in the same field.\n\n110 1 Â Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Çe enacting jurisdiction Ç4 enj\n\n110 1 Â Madera Irrigation District (Calif.), Çe author Ç4 aut\n\n610 1 0Â United States.

These input conventions clarify MARC punctuation practices. Fields 110, 610, 710, and 810 may optionally end with terminal punctuation. Terminal punctuation consists of one of the following:Â ellipsis, hyphen, period, closing parenthesis, exclamation point, and question mark. Currently, the control heading process adds terminal periods to access points. If the final subfields are subfield Çu, Ç0, Ç1, Ç2, Ç3, Ç4, or Ç5, the terminal punctuation precedes the first instance of those subfields. If the final subfield is Çe, add a comma after the access point unless the access point ends with an open date. Separate multiple relator terms with commas and add a period after the last subfield Çe.\n\nA corporate name portion of a name/subordinate body or name/title access point ends with terminal punctuation. When an authorized access point ends with a quotation mark, the terminal punctuation is placed before the quotation mark.\n\nIn the case of a corporate name input as a subject access point and followed by a subject subdivision, omit the terminal punctuation following the name unless the name ends with an abbreviation or initial/letter. See also 6xx Introduction for specific subject access point guidelines.\n\nQualifier elements:\n\nEnclose a term indicating the type of corporate body or jurisdiction in parentheses\n\nEnclose the name of a geographic place or jurisdiction in parentheses\n\nEnclose the name of an institution in parentheses\n\nEnclose a date or dates associated with the corporate body in parentheses\n\nEnclose a general designation in parentheses\n\nEnclose a distinguishing word or phrase in parentheses\n\nSeparate adjacent qualifiers by a space, colon, space\n\nSeparate a term used to distinguish one government from another claiming jurisdiction over the same area and the date or dates associated with that government by a comma and a space\n\nNon-qualifier elements:\n\nPrecede a subheading by a period and a space except when the preceding element ends with a quotation mark\n\nEnclose the number, date, and location of a conference or an exhibition, etc., in parentheses. Separate the number, date, and location by a space, colon, space.
