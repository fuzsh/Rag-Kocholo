During the same period, almost five billion people globally have become poorer. Hardship and hunger are a daily reality for many people worldwide.

Seven out of ten of the world’s biggest corporates have either a billionaire CEO or a billionaire as their principal shareholder. Through squeezing workers, dodging tax, privatizing the state and spurring climate breakdown, corporations are driving inequality and acting in the service of delivering ever-greater wealth to their rich owners. To end extreme inequality, governments must radically redistribute the power of billionaires and corporations back to ordinary people. A more equal world is possible if governments effectively regulate and reimagine the private sector.\n\nAdditional details\n\nAuthor(s)\n\nPublisher(s)\n\nDOI\n\n10.21201/2024.000007\n\nHow to cite this resource\n\nCitation styles vary so we recommend you check what is appropriate for your context.
