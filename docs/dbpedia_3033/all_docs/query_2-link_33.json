        "text": "A few years ago, my parents switched toilet paper brands. While this is surely fascinating information for you personally, it's relevant here because they switched to \"Who Gives A Crap,\" a company that donates 50% of its profits to building toilets and improving sanitation in developing countries.\n\nDeveloping a business model around corporate social responsibility is a great way to use our speck of time on earth to change the world for the better—while still making a profit. After exploring lots of brands that use this strategy well, I compiled some of my favorite corporate social responsibility examples. These businesses do good for others while still doing good for themselves.\n\nTable of contents:\n\nWhat is corporate social responsibility?\n\nTypes of CSR\n\nCorporate social responsibility examples\n\nBen & Jerry's\n\nWho Gives A Crap\n\nTom's of Maine\n\nTomboyX\n\nAllbirds\n\nRent the Runway\n\nHive\n\nBLK + GRN\n\nPatagonia\n\nCariuma\n\nHow to build a CSR business model\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat is corporate social responsibility (CSR)?\n\nYou don't have to be a non-profit to show that you care about the world outside your organization. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a business model adopted by for-profit organizations that involves using company resources to benefit society while still pursuing corporate goals.\n\nYou've certainly heard of \"the bottom line\" in the corporate world—it's all about profit. CSR-oriented companies abide by a \"triple bottom line\" that encompasses two other \"P\" words: people, whether that be the company's employees or the population at large, and the planet. In other words, they're committed to incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into their operations.\n\nMany companies invested in CSR are Certified B Corporations, meaning they meet very high standards of positive social and environmental impact put forth by the non-profit network B Lab. But you can practice corporate social responsibility, certified or not. Here's what corporate social responsibility may look like in action:\n\nUsing sustainable manufacturing/production practices\n\nPaying workers fair wages\n\nAdvocating for social justice policy reform\n\nInnovating products to solve an environmental or social issue\n\nCommitting to reducing carbon footprint\n\nDonating significant profits to a charitable cause\n\nTypes of corporate social responsibility\n\nAccording to Harvard Business School, there are four broad categories of CSR on which businesses tend to focus:\n\nEnvironmental: Businesses in this category focus on making a positive environmental impact. They adopt renewables, \"cradle to grave\" manufacturing principles, carbon offsets, and sustainable sourcing.\n\nPhilanthropic: Philanthropic businesses devote themselves to making a positive social impact. They often fund non-profits like universities, museums, arts programs, charities, and other cultural institutions. They might also provide grants and scholarships.\n\nEthical: Companies with strong ethical standards may go as far as codifying their ethics within their corporate structure to show their commitment to align with these values. For example, a company may establish in writing that it will never source materials from suppliers that mistreat their workers.\n\nEconomic: Companies committed to economic responsibility understand where their dollars are going and what impact they're having across the value chain. They believe it's important to pay their employees fair wages, and they exercise good stewardship with their profit.\n\n10 corporate social responsibility examples\n\nThere are companies that throw half a percent of their earnings at a random charity, and then there are those that build their entire business model around societal advancement and really get their hands dirty. Here are 10 socially responsible companies that inspire with their CSR.\n\n1. Ben & Jerry's\n\nBen & Jerry's commitment to social justice is just about as sweet as a pint of Half Baked®. As a B Corp, it's committed to using its ice cream to change the world for the better. For example, it invests heavily in building relationships with Black-owned and refugee-hiring suppliers.\n\nBut the brand didn't jump right into the deep end from its inception. From its humble beginnings in the late 1970s until today, the company has gradually advocated for more causes, now including voter rights, climate justice, LGBTQ+ rights, and many more—all while maintaining its brand presence.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nGradually take on new social initiatives rather than spreading your resources too thin all at once.\n\nDevelop an approachable personality for your brand through your tone and design.\n\n2. Who Gives A Crap\n\nAfter learning about the brand's mission, I certainly started giving a crap. Who Gives A Crap takes the shame out of (and adds some humor to) \"going number two,\" humanizing itself as a brand.\n\nBut the brand name and tone aren't what makes it a socially responsible company. The founders are committed to building toilets and improving sanitation in developing countries to the point that they devote 50% of their profits to this mission, hence their status as a B Corp.\n\nLike many other companies with great CSR, they also strive to be environmentally friendly, using plastic-free products and using sustainable materials like bamboo and recycled paper to manufacture toilet paper (among other paper products like tissues and paper towels).\n\nTakeaways:\n\nCSR doesn't have to be serious stuff. Be authentic and honest with your brand's tone.\n\nWhen expanding your brand's offerings, choose products that align with your other CSR objectives.\n\n3. Tom's of Maine\n\nIf you've ever felt like there's no more room for innovation in your industry, think again. Tom's of Maine proved that a centuries-old industry (toothpaste) had more work to do by inventing the first recyclable toothpaste tube.\n\nThe company also exhibits transparency, providing detailed information about each of its ingredients so that consumers aren't left guessing what they're using to brush their teeth.\n\nTom's is also a great example of companies with high CSR standards banding together. The brand partners with TerraCycle, a recycling company, encouraging customers to recycle items that your average waste management company won't take, in order to redeem for charity donations. Since both companies emphasize sustainability and eco-friendliness, they go together like mint and toothpaste.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nWhen thinking about innovation, consider CSR—how can you innovate in a way that's also socially responsible?\n\nPartner with relevant, like-minded organizations that also practice CSR.\n\n4. TomboyX\n\nMost retailers produce clothing with a few narrowly-defined body types and presentations in mind. Most people don't fit those molds.\n\nQueer-founded clothing brand TomboyX believes that everybody deserves to find a fit that makes them feel comfortable in their own skin. The company designs and manufactures clothing for all bodies and gender identities, keeping inclusivity at its core.\n\nThe company holds true to this value in its hiring practices as well, with 80% of its C-suite being women and 63% of managers identifying as LGBTQ+ and/or minority. The brand is also committed to sustainability, forming close relationships with its factories and striving to source organic and recyclable fabrics.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nHaving personal experience with a social issue makes it far easier to build your business around it. Focus on what matters to you personally.\n\nDevelop hiring practices that reflect your company's commitment to CSR.\n\n5. Allbirds\n\nAccording to Allbirds, shoes and sustainability make a great pair (pun intended). The brand is currently carbon-neutral and aims to have zero emissions by 2030 through tactics like regenerative agriculture and using renewable materials. Plus, Allbirds' shoes are durable and machine washable, making them easy to freshen up and use for many more months.\n\nThe brand emphasizes sustainability not only in its production, but also in the way it treats its workers. The brand has a strict code of conduct regarding the ethical treatment of employees and frequently visits and audits those factories to ensure their standards are being met.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nCreate both short- and long-term CSR goals.\n\nCommit to your cause in a well-rounded way, not just focusing on one area of your business.\n\n6. Rent the Runway\n\nThanks to Rent the Runway, you don't have to be a millionaire to wear designer clothes to your next bougie function. The company makes high-end apparel affordable and accessible by allowing customers to rent their clothes before choosing to either purchase them or send them back.\n\nFor those who regularly enjoy galas and nights out on the town, the brand offers a membership program that keeps its members equipped with a rotating selection of four outfits at a time.\n\nRent the Runway's mission is closely tied to sustainability. Too often, people purchase an outfit for a single event and then proceed to never wear that outfit again, resulting in textile waste. The company allows several people to enjoy an outfit for an evening out without making them pay top-dollar to purchase it. The brand now also offsets 100% of carbon emissions from shipments and aims to operate with net zero carbon emissions by 2040.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nYou can be socially responsible without shying away from profitable strategies like a membership-based business model.\n\nIndustries that produce a lot of waste offer the greatest opportunity for sustainability innovation.\n\n7. Hive\n\nOnline grocery store Hive aims to make sustainable grocery shopping a breeze. The company does its due diligence to screen products and packaging for sustainability and ESG impact so that customers don't have to do the work themselves.\n\nHive notifies customers of their eco-friendly impact statistics after every purchase, providing them with a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. And the dopamine rush doesn't end there—Hive ships its products in cute cardboard boxes filled with recyclable packaging materials that resemble honeycomb. I've ordered a few boxes myself, and I can honestly say that opening a Hive box takes me back to being a kid on Christmas morning.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nBuild CSR into each step of your customer journey.\n\nLift the curtain for your customers, so they can feel like they're a part of your mission.\n\n8. BLK + GRN\n\nBLK + GRN is a Black women-owned natural marketplace. The brand is committed to educating consumers on toxic ingredients that are often included in personal care products marketed to Black women and supporting sustainable products from Black artisans and health experts.\n\nThe company even curated a list of widely tolerated toxic ingredients that will never show up in its products, coined its Toxic Twenty List. It serves as an informational resource for readers who want to learn more about ingredients they should avoid.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nDevelop your mission to solve a problem for a specific audience.\n\nEducate others about your cause rather than just producing products that support it.\n\n9. Patagonia\n\n\"Earth is now our only stakeholder.\" That was Patagonia's statement after its owner stepped down and handed the company over to a trust dedicated to addressing climate change. This means that any profits not reinvested in the business will be used to tackle the environmental crisis. And that's in addition to the 1% of sales Patagonia already donates to environmental efforts.\n\nThis unique restructuring ensures Patagonia employees are secure, the founding family can still make sure the company's values are followed, and the max amount of money goes toward a good cause. This is an approach no other company has taken before, making it an unprecedented step in corporate social responsibility.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nDon't be afraid to do something unprecedented if it means making a bigger impact.\n\nThink long term to ensure your company's values won't change with new leadership.\n\n10. Cariuma\n\nMuch like Allbirds,Cariuma is a sustainable sneaker company that kicks fast fashion to the curb by sourcing materials responsibly and making quality products that will last. Its dedication to people and the planet go hand in hand with its \"Get a Pair of Sneakers, Plant 2 Trees\" initiative.\n\nEven if you just subscribe to its email newsletter, Cariuma will plant a tree in the Brazilian rainforest in your name. From ethical factories to carbon-neutral shipping, the company is a stellar example that you don't have to compromise on style or substance to be environmentally responsible.\n\nTakeaways:\n\nCreate tangible measures of impact, like planting trees for each purchase, to make your CSR efforts more transparent and engaging.\n\nInnovate your products to be both sustainable and appealing, proving that eco-friendliness and style can coexist.\n\nHow to build a CSR business model\n\nDon't just throw CSR against your business's wall and hope it sticks—it has to be implemented strategically.\n\nMost importantly, ensure your approach aligns with your resources and brand image. For example, Who Gives A Crap chose a philanthropic goal relevant to its product offering. The brand name itself reflects both of these efforts and does so in a creative and witty way.\n\nYou should also be wary of half-baked initiatives and the temptation to cut corners. Many brands simply throw an eco-friendly label on their packaging (a strategy known as greenwashing), whereas Hive carefully inspects all of its products to make sure they're actually being kind to the earth and its people.\n\nTaking these steps will ultimately benefit you. If you execute CSR strategically, you can become a Certified B Corp, improving your business's reputation and attracting new customers.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nHave a few more questions about corporate social responsibility? Here are some main takeaways.\n\nWhat are examples of corporate social responsibility?\n\nPatagonia handing the company over to a trust dedicated to addressing climate change; BLK + GRN educating consumers on the toxic ingredients often included in personal care products marketed to Black women; Allbirds working to be zero-emissions by 2030—examples of corporate social responsibility run the gamut. CSR can be achieved through initiatives such as advocating for social causes, ethical production, and donating profits to environmental efforts, but it's not limited to any specific actions.\n\nWhat are the four types of corporate social responsibility?\n\nThe four types of corporate social responsibility are environmental responsibility, philanthropic responsibility, ethical responsibility, and economic responsibility. Many companies use a mix of many (or even all) of these types of CSR, but it can be helpful to start by deciding which type fits your brand most closely.\n\nWhat is an example of a CSR statement?\n\nAn example of a CSR statement is Patagonia's mission statement: \"We're in business to save our home planet.\" It explicitly articulates its purpose beyond profit, conveys a commitment to environmental preservation as a central driver of its business activities, and demonstrates a genuine dedication to addressing pressing societal challenges. Putting CSR at the forefront of your mission statement is a great way to show you mean (responsible) business.\n\nWhat is the main purpose of corporate social responsibility?\n\nThe main purpose of corporate social responsibility is for companies to weave ethical, environmental, and social considerations into how they do business. The idea is to make a positive impact on society while growing sustainably and rocking the long game.\n\nRelated reading:\n\n7 annual report design examples\n\n.org vs. .com and other TLDs\n\nA step-by-step guide to competitive market analysis\n\nHow to start an eCommerce business"
