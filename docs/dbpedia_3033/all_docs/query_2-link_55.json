        "text": "Policy on the Use of the University Name, Seals, and Trademarks\n\nI. Introduction\n\nThis policy is to clarify the permissible uses, and restrictions on the uses, of the University of California 's name and seal, as well as the Berkeley campus' name, seal, and trademarks. The policy also identifies the appropriate offices on campus and in the Office of the President from which to seek authorization for use of the name, seal, and trademarks and to arrange for licensing of the name, seal, or trademarks.\n\nThe University of California (\"University\") name and seal and the Berkeley campus' (\"Campus\") name and seal represent excellence in all areas-teaching, research, and public service. The names and seals have a unique value, and are afforded special protection by state law and University policy.\n\nThe name \"University of California\" and all abbreviations thereof are property of the State of California under Education Code section 92000 and may not be used to imply, either directly or indirectly, the University's endorsement, support, favor, association with, or opposition to an organization, product, or service without permission of the University. Education Code Section 92000 conveys the unique value of the University's and Campus' name by making a violation of the section a misdemeanor.\n\nIn addition to statutory protection, the University's and Campus' names and seals are protected by state and federal trademark law. The Campus' logos, designs, and visual images are also protected by trademark and copyright law. Unauthorized uses of any of these names and trademarks may constitute trademark and/or copyright infringement as well as an unfair business practice.\n\nThis policy, and the guidelines set forth herein, apply to all media, including, without limitation, print, radio, television, video, motion pictures, and all forms of electronic media (e.g. Internet Web sites and electronic mail).\n\nII. Definitions\n\nA. University's name: \"University of California,\" the abbreviation \"UC,\" and any other name or abbreviation that has University wide application or concerns more than one campus.\n\nB. Campus' name: \"University of California, Berkeley\"; \"Berkeley\"; abbreviations (e.g., Cal, UCB) or any other name containing such designations or abbreviations.\n\nC. Authorized Seals:\n\n1. Official Corporate Seal of the University of California - The official seal of The Regents, which reads: \"Seal of the University of California 1868.\"\n\n2. Unofficial Seal - A replica of the corporate seal, with the words \"Seal of\" deleted.\n\n3. Berkeley Seal - The Campus' version of the unofficial seal, imprinted with the \"Berkeley\" name.\n\nD. Trademarks: The Campus' name, logos (e.g., Berkeley seal, Cal script, bear paw, Oski, Golden Bears, side-view bear), and distinctive visual images (e.g., the Campanile, Sather Gate), protected by state and federal trademark law.\n\nE. Sponsored Student Group: A group of students whose purposes and practices further the University's purposes as an educational institution and are consistent with University policy. Such groups are approved by the Office of Student Activities and Services and are authorized to use the Campus' name, facilities, and certain administrative resources.\n\nF. Registered Student Group: A group of students who organize to become involved in a common activity and who are registered with and approved by the Office of Student Activities and Services for the purpose of using Campus facilities.\n\nG. Sponsored Departmental Organization: Any group of students, faculty, and/or staff from a college, school, department, other unit, or combination of units of the University who organize to become involved in a common activity, not involving the representation of employees, and who obtain recognition from the unit for the purpose of using Campus facilities.\n\nH. Support Group:Any group, organization, foundation, or association other than a Campus Alumni Association or Campus Foundation\n\n(1) whose primary purpose is to provide assistance through fund-raising, public outreach, and other support for the University's mission; or\n\n(2) whose representatives or activities make the entity indistinguishable from the University itself; or\n\n(3) that acts as an agent of or intermediary for the University.\n\nA support group must receive official recognition from the University before it may use the name of the University.\n\nI. Web Site: An electronic page used for publishing on the Internet, including the terms \"home page\" and \"Web page.\"\n\nIII. Statement of University and Campus policy\n\nA. Official Corporate Seal of the University of CaliforniaCurrently, the Office of the President will not make electronic versions of the Official Corporate Seal available by means of the Web.\n\nThe use of the official corporate seal is reserved for diplomas and other corporate materials, as authorized by the Secretary of The Regents. The authority to use the official seal is not delegated to the campuses.\n\nB. Unofficial Seal\n\nThe President has delegated to the Chancellors the authority to permit the use of the unofficial seal as a symbol of the University for official purposes. However, the Berkeley Chancellor has discontinued use of this seal for Campus purposes. (See below, paragraph III.C, Berkeley Seal.)\n\nThe unofficial seal may be used by Campus employees only when engaged in University wide activities commissioned by the Office of the President. Requests to use the unofficial seal must be referred to the Campus' Office of Marketing & Management of Trademarks, which will coordinate the submission to the Senior Vice President-Business and Finance. (See paragraphs IV.C & H, Delegated Authority)\n\nC. Berkeley Seal\n\nThe Berkeley seal is the Campus' version of the unofficial seal, imprinted with the \"Berkeley\" name on the face of the seal. It is the official seal of the Campus. Because the use of this seal implies institutional support, it may only be used as authorized below.\n\nCampus administrators-the Chancellor, Vice Chancellors, Deans, Directors, Department Chairs, and Administrative Officers-may use the Berkeley seal as a symbol of the Campus for official purposes.\n\nCampus administrators may authorize faculty and staff employees to use University letterhead and business cards bearing the Berkeley seal, provided that such use is restricted to conducting official University business, within the course and scope of the individual's employment. All other uses of the Berkeley seal by faculty and staff employees are prohibited.\n\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the appropriate Vice Chancellors may authorize other persons acting as agents of the University to use University letterhead and business cards bearing the Berkeley seal, provided that such use is restricted to conducting official University business, within the course and scope of the agent's authorized activities.\n\nCampus employees may not use the Berkeley seal for private, non-University purposes, including private professional activities, outside consulting or commercial activities.\n\nUse of the Berkeley seal on Web sites is restricted to official departmental Web sites. The Berkeley seal may not be used on personal Web sites.\n\nUse of the Berkeley seal for the production of emblematic products is permitted only by license or authorization from the Office of Marketing & Management of Trademarks. (See paragraph IV.C, Delegated Authority)\n\nCampus units may not create alternate versions of the Berkeley seal. Although the seal itself may not be altered, Campus colleges, schools, and departments may use the Berkeley seal in conjunction with the name of their college, school, or department, appearing alongside the seal for an otherwise approved use of the seal.\n\nAside from the uses described above, all other uses must be authorized in writing, as provided in this policy. Authorization will be provided only when the requested use is clearly in the best interests of the University. (See paragraph IV.C, Delegated Authority)\n\nD. University's Name\n\nAs indicated above, the name of the University and its campuses is protected by law and University policy. Under University policy, each Chancellor is delegated, within his or her area of jurisdiction, authority to permit use of campus names (e.g., University of California , Berkeley ), and/or abbreviations (e.g., Cal ), or any other name of which said designations or abbreviations are a part.
