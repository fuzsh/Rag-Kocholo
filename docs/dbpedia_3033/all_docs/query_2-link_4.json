        "text": "What Is Corporate Culture?\n\nCorporate culture refers to the values, beliefs, and behaviors that determine how a company's employees and management interact, perform, and handle business transactions. Often, corporate culture is implied, not expressly defined, and develops organically over time from the cumulative traits of the people that the company hires.\n\nA company's culture will be reflected in its dress code, business hours, office setup, employee benefits, turnover, hiring decisions, treatment of employees and clients, client satisfaction, and every other aspect of operations.\n\nUnderstanding Corporate Culture\n\nAwareness of corporate or organizational culture in businesses and other organizations such as universities emerged in the 1960s. The term \"corporate culture\" developed in the early 1980s and became widely known by the 1990s. Corporate culture was used during those periods by managers, sociologists, and other academics to describe the character of a company.\n\nCorporate culture emanated from generalized beliefs and behaviors, company-wide value systems, management strategies, employee communications and relations, work environment, and attitude. It would go on to include company origin stories put forth by charismatic chief executive officers (CEOs), as well as visual symbols such as logos and trademarks.\n\nCorporate culture is not only created by the founders, management, and employees of a company, but is also influenced by national cultures and traditions, economic trends, international trade, company size, and products.\n\nThere are a variety of terms that relate to companies affected by multiple cultures, especially in the wake of globalization and the increased international interaction of today's business environment. These include:\n\nCross-culture refers to people from different backgrounds interacting in the business environment.\n\nCulture shock refers to the confusion or anxiety people experience when conducting business in a society other than their own.\n\nReverse culture shock is often experienced by people who spend lengthy time abroad for business and have difficulty readjusting upon their return.\n\nCompanies often devote substantial resources and effort to create positive cross-culture experiences and to facilitate a more cohesive and productive corporate culture.\n\nImportance of Corporate Culture\n\nA carefully considered, even innovative, corporate culture can elevate companies above their competitors and support long-lasting success. Such a culture can:\n\nProvide for a positive workplace environment\n\nCreate an engaged, enthusiastic, and motivated workforce\n\nAttract high-value employees\n\nReduce turnover\n\nDrive and improve performance quality and productivity\n\nResult in favorable business results\n\nUnderpin a company's longevity\n\nStrengthen return on investment (ROI)\n\nProvide an implacable competitive advantage\n\nClarify for employees the goals of their positions, departments, and a company overall\n\nContribute to the diversification of the workforce\n\nTypes of Corporate Culture\n\nClan Culture\n\nClan cultures are about teamwork and collaboration. In such a culture, those in management function as enthusiastic mentors who provide guidance to subordinates. Good relationships, encouragement, trust, and participation are key aspects. The contribution potential of every employee is a component of a clan culture. Also, clan culture can easily adapt to change and implement needed action quickly.\n\nAdhocracy Culture\n\nAdhocracy culture creates an entrepreneurial workplace in which executives and employees function as innovators and risk-takers. In this flexible environment, agile thinking is nurtured. Employees are encouraged to pursue their aspirational ideas and take action to achieve results that can advance company goals. New and unconventional products and services are the main outcome of the adhocracy culture.\n\nMarket Culture\n\nMarket culture is focused on meeting specific targets and bottom line goals. This culture creates a working environment that's competitive and demanding. Management is most interested in business results. Employees are encouraged to work hard and \"get the job done\" to enhance a company's market presence, profits, and stock price. While employees may feel stressed in such a workplace, they can also feel enthusiastic and excited about their work.\n\nHierarchy Culture\n\nA hierarchy culture is a traditional corporate culture that functions according to a company's executive, management, and staff organizational structure. That is, it follows the chain of command from top down, where executives oversee employees and their work efforts to meet specific goals. The hierarchy culture prizes stability and conventional methods of operation. The work environment can be seen as more rigid than some other cultures but employees can clearly understand their roles and objectives. They may also feel a sense of security because of the more conservative approach to running a company.\n\nExamples of Contemporary Corporate Cultures\n\nJust as national cultures can influence and shape corporate culture, so can a company’s management strategy. In top companies of the 21st century, such as Google, Apple Inc. (AAPL), and Netflix Inc. (NFLX), less traditional management strategies that foster creativity, collective problem solving, and greater employee freedom have been the norm. They are thought to contribute to business success.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL), the parent of Google, is well known for its employee-friendly corporate culture. It explicitly defines itself as unconventional and offers perks such as telecommuting, flextime, tuition reimbursement, free employee lunches, and on-site doctors.\n\nAt its corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., the company offers on-site services such as oil changes, car washes, massages, fitness classes, and a hairstylist. Its corporate culture helped it to consistently be regarded as one of the best places to work.\n\nProgressive policies such as comprehensive employee benefits and alternatives to hierarchical leadership (even doing away with closed offices and cubicles) have been trends that reflect a more tech-conscious, modern generation of corporate culture. These trends mark a change from earlier aggressive, individualistic, and high-risk corporate cultures, such as that of former energy company Enron.\n\nHigh-profile examples of alternative management strategies that significantly affect corporate culture include holacracy. This has been put to use at shoe company Zappos, owned by Amazon (AMZN), and agile management techniques applied at music streaming company Spotify.\n\nHolacracy is an open management philosophy that, among other things, eliminates job titles and other such traditional hierarchies. Employees have flexible roles and self-organization, and collaboration is highly valued. Zappos instituted this program in 2013 and has met the challenge of transition with varying success and criticism.\n\nSimilarly, Spotify, a music-streaming service, uses the principles of agile management as part of its unique corporate culture. Agile management, in essence, focuses on deliverables with a flexible, trial-and-error strategy that often groups employees in a start-up environment approach to creatively tackle the company’s issues at hand.\n\nCharacteristics of Successful Corporate Cultures\n\nCorporate cultures, whether shaped intentionally or grown organically, express the core of a company’s ideology and practice. They affect every aspect of a business, from each employee and customer to a company's public image. When an organization strives to be multicultural, it hires workers from diverse backgrounds to work in every department and at all levels of management.\n\nThe Harvard Business Review identified six important characteristics of successful corporate cultures in 2013.\n\nVision\n\nFirst and foremost is vision. Whether communicated via a simple mission statement or a corporate manifesto, a company’s vision can be a powerful tool.\n\nValues\n\nValues, while a broad concept, can embody the thinking and perspectives necessary to achieve a company’s vision. They can serve as a beacon for behavior necessary to progress toward all manner of success. Examples of values include fairness, trustworthiness, integrity, performance excellence, teamwork, and a high-quality customer experience. For example, Google’s famous slogan “Don’t Be Evil” is an expression of values.\n\nPractices\n\nPractices are the tangible methods, guided by ethics, by which a company implements its values. For example, Netflix emphasizes the importance of knowledge-based, high-achieving employees and, as such, Netflix pays its employees at the top of their market salary range, rather than through an earn-your-way-to-the-top philosophy.\n\nPeople\n\nPeople come next, with companies employing and recruiting in a way that reflects and enhances their overall culture. Plus, people are the key to bringing corporate culture to life and obtaining the high-value performances that can lead to favorable business outcomes.\n\nNarrative and Place\n\nLastly, narrative and place are perhaps the most modern characteristics of corporate culture. Having a powerful narrative or origin story, such as that involving Steve Jobs and Apple, is important for growth and public image. The place of business, such as the city of choice and also the office design and architecture, is one of the most cutting-edge advents in contemporary corporate culture.\n\nOther characteristics of corporate culture can include:\n\nTeamwork\n\nEmployees should be encouraged and trained to work together with camaraderie and trust toward common goals. The benefits of teamwork, such as problem-solving, the development of innovative ideas, and improved productivity, should be demonstrated to the workforce.\n\nTraining and Education\n\nCompanies should provide the means for employees to improve their skills and enhance their knowledge so that the vision and goals of the company can be more reliably reached. Training and education can also provide employees with a path to new opportunities within their companies. This can motivate individuals to learn and do more.\n\nInnovation\n\nInnovation is exciting and can underscore the spirit of a company's vision. It can instill pride, confidence, and loyalty in the workforce.\n\nLeadership\n\nA company's management, including C-suite executives, should be accessible and open to providing assistance that supports all employees.\n\nHow to Develop a Corporate Culture\n\nThere is no single strategy for building a corporate culture because companies, industries, and people can be so different. However, the basic steps below may help you envision a corporate culture that spells success for your employees, clients, and company.\n\nDefine a company's vision, values, and behaviors.\n\nGather feedback from employees about your company's values, ideas, and work methods to improve the workplace environment and performance.\n\nUse small discussion groups, surveys, brown bag lunch meetings, or town hall-type meetings to engage your employees and give them a voice.\n\nEstablish methods, such as training at regular intervals, to communicate company values/behaviors and determine how well they are understood.\n\nEmploy high-quality internal communications to maintain consistent contact with employees about company goals, the working environment, and employees' roles in the company's success.\n\nEstablish guidelines that reinforce company values, e.g., a rule that employees should not be disturbed by work phone calls, emails, or texts during vacations or other types of time off.\n\nRecognize employees in a positive and public manner as a reward for their contributions to corporate success.\n\nPractice what you preach—ensure that management maintains a consistent behavioral approach to operations rather than cutting corners when convenient.\n\nBe approachable so that all employees may address their concerns and feel connected/of value.\n\nFoster teamwork rather than silos and isolation.\n\nSet goals for diversity and inclusion; celebrate the differences among people as you encourage consistent behavior from all.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCorporate culture has become a vital, even essential, ingredient in the ongoing success of a business. It represents the values, beliefs, and goals of a company, as well as the consistent behavior expected from all employees, from top to bottom.\n\nNot only is corporate culture an important key to attracting and retaining employees. It can also support high-quality employee performance, ongoing achievement, and the longevity of a company."
