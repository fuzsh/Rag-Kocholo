        "text": "Yes, competitors can use your brand name in Google Ads. Below, learn how to deal with it and get insights on how (and why) to bid on your competitors’ brand names to drive more traffic.\n\nSeeing your competitor’s name on the search engine results page (SERP) is never a great feeling.\n\nBut an even worse feeling?\n\nWhen a rival brand shows up after someone searches for your brand’s name.\n\nSo, are companies allowed to use another company’s name in their paid search ads? What about as keywords for bidding?\n\nWe answer these questions and more below.\n\nCan a competitor use my brand name in their ad?\n\nYes, a competitor can bid on your brand name in their Google ads. However, there are rules to follow.\n\nBrands can use your brand name in their Google ads, as long as the name isn’t trademarked and the way they use it can’t be deemed “deceptive.” (Deception tactics include things like the company impersonating your brand.)\n\nIf your company’s name is trademarked, that may be a different story. Often, bigger competitors trademark their names. If this is the case, then they’re the exclusive owners. Per Google guidelines, no other brands can use that name in their ad copy.\n\nAn exception to this rule is if the company using it is a legitimate reseller, such as Zappos creating an ad for Nike sneakers.\n\nPro tip: Bing (Microsoft’s search engine) also allows competitors to bid on your brand name. Its policy states that “as an advertiser, you are responsible for ensuring that your keywords and ad content, including trademarks and logos, do not infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.”\n\nWhat are the rules about competitors bidding on my brand name?\n\nCompetitors can buy your brand name as a keyword, even if it’s trademarked. By using your brand name as a keyword, their ad could potentially show up on the SERP when someone is searching for your specific company.\n\nUnfortunately, you can’t do much about the competitor using your brand name or trademarks as a keyword.\n\nHowever, there are things you can do to remain competitive. For starters, ensure you’re bidding on your own brand name. This way, competitors aren’t stealing extra traffic that should go to you. This also gives you more real estate in the SERPs by showing a paid ad and appearing in the organic results.\n\nIf a competitor is bidding on your brand name and you aren’t? Then their ad will show above your organic result, driving more clicks away from your website. You can also bid on their brand name — more on that below.\n\nPro tip: If you have an existing amicable relationship with a competitor, consider contacting them for a truce and agree to not bid on each other’s terms. There’s no guarantee they’ll agree, but if you’re worried about your budget, it’s worth a shot.\n\nWhy would a competitor bid on my company’s brand name?\n\nThe main reason companies bid on another’s brand name is to steal traffic from the competition. They want to target those looking for a brand that sells a similar product or service, so they can redirect them to their own website.\n\nThis tactic makes sense when you have a new brand few, if any, people know about. So you bid on a competitor’s brand with more notoriety to gain brand awareness and visibility for your brand.\n\nHow do I choose which competitor brand names to bid on, if any?\n\nIf you’re going to bid on a competitor’s name, we advise picking the right competitors to bid on (or ensure your agency picked the right ones, if you’re not doing your own marketing).\n\nThere’s no point in bidding on brands that aren’t stealing business from you, such as big-name brands with significantly more offerings.\n\nFor example, you can target competitors that give you a hard time because they have:\n\nBeen around for many years\n\nLots of website traffic from high-ranking content on Google\n\nA high domain authority (DA) score\n\nRecent complaints from customers that you can point out in your copy to show why you’re better\n\nAn inferior unique selling proposition to yours\n\nIf the competitor is similar enough and is more popular than you, but isn’t too out of reach (e.g., an ecommerce mom-and-pop shop targeting Walmart keywords wouldn’t cut it), then go for it. Test the results to see if it boosts your traffic and conversions.\n\nAlso, tailor the ad text to differentiate your brand from that competitor. One way to do this is by highlighting your unique selling proposition. For instance, if a competitor brand has a similar but more expensive product or service, highlight your brand as the more affordable option.\n\nHave more questions about paid search or Google Ads? You’ve come to the right place.\n\nWhat if I think a competitor is bending (or breaking) the rules when using my brand name?\n\nBefore you get heated, it’s important to realize that they might not actually be bidding on your brand. If your brand is “Sunrise Senior Living,” for example, the company could be bidding on “senior living.” That’s what will match in Google’s algorithm — not necessarily the “Sunrise” part.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s not a lot you can do unless they’re using your trademarked term in their ad copy. If they are, submit a trademark complaint to Google.\n\nAside from bidding on their brand in return, fight back by conducting keyword research (using tools like SpyFu or Semrush) to find other search terms they’re using for search marketing efforts.\n\nIn extreme cases (e.g., trademark infringement), send the company a cease and desist letter, though this will likely come at a cost and not guarantee the outcome you want.\n\nShould I bid on my competitor’s brand name?\n\nIf other keywords are working well, it’s a better use of your ad spend to allocate your marketing budget toward those.\n\nThere’s no hard-and-fast answer to this. However, experience tells us that bidding on a competitor’s brand name shouldn’t be a top priority in your paid search strategy.\n\nIf you have an excess budget, then you could bid on a competitor’s brand as a keyword. We don’t suggest using another brand in your ad copy.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it’s giving unnecessary attention to the competition, which could backfire and direct more traffic to them. In the Monday.com example above, they bid on the term “Asana” without mentioning it in their ad copy.\n\nGoing about this wrong is a major reason why we recommend using a digital marketing agency that specializes in SEO and SEM.\n\nHawkSEM’s experts have helped brands large and small gain higher clicks and conversions. This is partly due to our decades of experience in the industry and our proprietary software, ConversionIQ, which pinpoints the best keywords to improve optimization and earn more clicks from high-converting prospects.\n\nHow can I use competitors bidding on my brand to my advantage?\n\nReview your competitor’s ad copy or strategy and take inventory of what you uncover. How does your campaign compare? This is a great time to reflect on your own advertising efforts.\n\nAre you taking full advantage of Google’s ad offerings like assets and sitelink extensions (if appropriate)? Ask yourself: If I were a consumer, would I click on my ad?\n\n“If possible, add competitor names in your ad copy and tell how your brand is better,” says Sarah McKraken, a search engine marketing expert.\n\nLarger competitors do this all the time.\n\n“Most large companies have a competitor campaign,” continues McKraken. “You’ll find plenty of large companies bidding on others and getting bid on as well.”\n\nFor example, if you type “Etsy t-shirts design” into Google, you’ll find a RushOrderTees ad at the top, instead of Etsy:\n\nOr if you type in “Kohl’s women pajamas” in Google search, you’ll see pay-per-click (PPC) ads from several competitors like Amazon and Victoria’s Secret:\n\nIn the Etsy branded keyword “takeover,” RushOrderTees didn’t mention its competitor at all. It focused on what its brand offers, which is:\n\nFree shipping on all orders\n\nGuaranteed satisfaction\n\nCompetitive prices\n\nThen, in the Kohl’s branded keyword takeover, competitors vied for the attention of Valentine’s Day shoppers. They also didn’t mention the competitor directly in their ads, and instead focused on their offer for the holiday:\n\nBamboo Pajamas: Listicle of top five women’s pajamas and a pinch of FOMO (fear of missing out) — “You’ll regret not getting this”\n\nAmazon: Clearance sale and free two-day shipping with a Prime membership\n\nVictoria’s Secret: Best holiday styles from its latest collection\n\nThese are all great tactics when bidding on competitor brand keywords. But also note how Kohl’s dominates its own branded keyword:\n\nIt sits at the top and has sitelink extensions pointing to “Valentine’s Day Gifts” and “Fast and Free Pickup” pages. It takes up more real estate in the SERPs, and directs searchers’ eyes to more page links to click on instead of the competitors below.\n\nSince these people are looking for Kohl’s directly, they’ll likely still gain most of the traffic by targeting their own brand keyword. So the takeaway is to ensure you’re focusing just as much on your brand keywords as on competitors’ brand keywords (if not more).\n\nPro tip: If you bid on competitor terms, avoid using dynamic keyword insertion. This feature involves the searched keyword auto-populating as an ad’s headline. This will cause your competitor’s name to show up in your ad. It could be deemed deceptive, even if it’s unintentional.\n\nTips to win at bidding on branded keywords\n\nIf you decide your marketing strategy requires an ad campaign using branded terms, these two tips will be helpful.\n\nFirst, tackle your opponents on the defensive end. Use high bids to maintain impression share of your brand’s keywords. This way, you’re above competitor’s ads in a branded search for your company’s name (like in the Kohl’s example).\n\nOn the offensive end, you can build campaigns using competitor’s branded terms using the tips above — showing why you’re better. Then to seal the deal, build a landing page specifically for that ad campaign that dives deeper into why your brand is the better choice.\n\n“If you’re a coffee company, having a targeted page that exemplifies how your brand is better than buying from Starbucks could be worthwhile,” says McKraken. “Some callouts could be that you’re a small business, you sell exclusively fair-trade, or out of a blind taste test your blends are tastier.”\n\nThink of this as a brand vs. competitor blog post. The goal is to show, not tell why you’re better. So include:\n\nBenefits of your product or service that relate to that audience’s specific pain points\n\nTestimonials from happy customers who overcame those pain points using your brand\n\nComparison of plans, prices, features, and other unique differentiators to showcase why your brand is better\n\nInclude visuals, such as infographics or videos to demonstrate your product’s benefits\n\nAn offer that’s tough to refuse, such as a limited-time discount, free trial, or free shipping\n\nMultiple calls to action (CTAs) throughout in case they’re ready to convert before they get to the end\n\nUse landing pages to stand out from competitors\n\nNow, like an ad campaign, landing pages require ongoing testing to determine what works.\n\nSo prepare to build A/B split tests and monitor the metrics (e.g., click-through rate or CTR, conversions, bounce rate) to see what converts potential customers into buyers or leads.\n\nTo give you an idea of what a winning landing page looks like for a competitor keywords campaign, we’ll use Monday.com’s feature in the Asana keyword campaign as an example.\n\nOnce you click on their link in the SERP, the first thing you see is a large and bold statement of why you should select its platform:\n\nIt showcases what it can do in a nice visual way. Has a CTA button. And logos of prominent customers who use it.\n\nScroll down, and you’ll find another bold move — a comparison chart between Monday.com and not just Asana, but all of its contenders in the market:\n\nYou can click each to see why Monday.com is the better choice. It’s a smart move to add the other competitors just in case prospective buyers consider them now or in the future.\n\nScroll a bit further, and you’ll see accolade badges from all the awards Monday.com won, further proving the worthiness of your dollar:\n\nThen just below it, you’ll find a list of the benefits of using Monday.com for your project management:\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there — beneath, you’ll find another key benefit and they create FOMO by showing that it’s used by over 150,000 users. Then right under is data from a Forrester report showing Monday.com’s economic impact on its users. The numbers are impressive, to say the least:\n\nAnd what better way to end a landing page than with a testimonial from a happy corporate customer (because if the big guys use it and you can afford it, why shouldn’t you get it too?)\n\nNot only does the testimonial highlight the customer being ecstatic about the platform, but it doles out numbers illustrating how it helped grow the company’s revenue by 60%.\n\nPro tip: When selecting a testimonial, choose one specific about the results your product or service provided to help prospects visualize using your solution.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nBidding on your competitor’s brand is typically not a great idea. But if you must, use the help of digital marketing experts to ensure you do it right. Without an expert’s help, you could get lower-quality scores for those keywords.\n\nThat’s because Google can see you’re not the brand whose name you’re bidding on. Plus, bidding on those branded keywords will likely cost you more because the brand isn’t your own.\n\nIn the long run, it’ll be better for your marketing plan to focus on your unique products or services, make sure the user experience is top-notch, and use ads to highlight your unique selling propositions to stand out."
