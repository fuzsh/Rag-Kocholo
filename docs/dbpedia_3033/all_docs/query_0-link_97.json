        "text": "WWF seeks to work with those who have the greatest potential to reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth and together find solutions to conservation challenges such as deforestation, over-fishing, water scarcity, and climate change.\n\nThe corporate sector drives much of the global economy, so we consider that companies also have a specific responsibility to ensure that the natural resources and ecosystems that underpin their business are used sustainably. Companies are also primed to lead on rapid adaptation and on the innovative solutions needed to drive change.\n\nWe know that one organization alone canâ€™t affect the change needed. The changes we want to see in the world can only come about through the efforts of many actors. Below is a selection of partnerships co-managed by WWF International and other national offices from across the network.\n\nSee Our Work With Partners"
