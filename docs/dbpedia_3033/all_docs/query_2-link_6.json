This is your company’s legal name, the one you have to use in contracts and invoices.\n\nThere are two ways to name your corporation:\n\nGet a word name. Once it’s approved, you have the right to use it across Canada.\n\nYou’ll need to prepare a bit, but your customers will be sure to recognize you wherever you do business. When choosing a corporate word name, make sure it’s distinctive.\n\nThis means that it distinguishes you from other businesses. You can do this using a dictionary or made-up word, or by combining names and words.\n\nAlso make sure that the name you want won’t be confused with any existing business names or trademarks. If names are too similar, someone may think they’re the same business.\n\nYour other option is to choose a numbered name.\n\nThis is the easiest way to name your corporation because we assign the number.\n\nYou can use another name to conduct business, but you’ll need to register it in the province and territory where you operate.\n\nKeep these tips in mind and you’re sure to pick the right name for your business corporation!"
