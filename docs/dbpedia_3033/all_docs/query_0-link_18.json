        "text": "Individuals need rules, which are meant to govern behavior between people, since we live in a society. Many organisations use rules to govern behavior between people. Families may have rules about keeping one’s bedroom tidy or not staying out late. So, rules seem to be an almost inevitable part of any organized social interaction, and societies have almost always developed such rules. These rules go on to become laws that govern natural persons.\n\nCorporates are also ‘legal personalities’, so it is logical that they too follow some kind of laws of interaction amongst themselves, the government and individuals.\n\nJust as individuals generally feel that law is an unwelcome, obtrusive and a confining variable in their lives, Companies too, may feel that the law is an unwelcome but mandatory constraint on their economic activities. In such companies, managers view compliance mainly as a cost that needs to be minimized. This attitude leads to the attainment of some legal knowledge but only enough so that the business can operate within the legal bounds. From this vantage point, the law is viewed primarily as inflexible — externally imposed rules that cannot be changed or adapted to suit a particular corporate strategy.\n\nConsequently, managers in the compliance pathway do not believe that they can use the law to further their business goals, and legal counsel acts primarily as a watchdog that polices corporate conduct for illegal activity.\n\nSince the basic essence of a legal system is to govern and restrict, it is fundamentally opposite to a corporation’s objective to be unrestricted and free to be able to maximize profits.\n\nTherefore, it would be logical to think that corporations have a natural tendency not to fit into legal systems.\n\nAnother point of conflict is when corporations become so big, they start competing with the state that makes and passes laws and regulations. It then becomes a question of economic vs. political power, each strong in its own field.\n\nCase in point Uber, where the corporation is trying its best to amend state and federal laws in favor of its operations and growth, purely by pumping in millions of dollars in advocacy, changing consumer behaviour, and therefore creating a political pressure point on lawmakers, and political lobbying.\n\nGiven the natural behaviors of corporates to continue to explore legal boundaries while seeking growth, they believe that legal expertise provides little concrete value, so they make no effort to acquire it. Or they might gain knowledge of the law only so that they can circumvent it to achieve a desired objective. Companies operating in this type of avoidance pathway will often have lax internal controls or a failure to perform due diligence.\n\nExample, Enron.\n\nSimilarly, UPS pays millions of dollars annually for the parking fines that its delivery trucks incur in New York City rather than comply fully with local parking ordinances. For UPS, that expense is considered an acceptable cost of doing business in order to maintain its leadership in shipping and logistics.\n\nFlip Side:\n\nHowever, on the flip side, Companies also, and more often, use the law to create tangible and identifiable value. To accomplish that, managers need to have a strong understanding of the legal system and how it can be tailored to generate value, and the legal department must view itself as a key stakeholder in helping the company to increase its return on investment. At this level of engagement, managers across functional areas work frequently with legal counsel and view them as partners in their strategic decision-making.\n\nLegal counselors, in turn, assume a more entrepreneurial role and have enough business proficiency to discuss various issues fluently with managers. Technology companies seem to be taking this approach rather well. In order to protect their vast IP and patent pool, as well as to monetize it, the management works pretty closely with the legal counsels to further those ends. Major chunks of revenues come from royalty income for companies like Cisco, Xerox, etc.\n\nThe subject of arbitration:\n\nSomething that corporations love, as this frees them from going through a legal system that can take years to resolve a dispute. In a way, it’s a parallel legal system for non-natural persons.\n\nArbitration is generally quicker and cheaper than court litigation. Specially qualified arbitrators are often used to resolve technical disputes.\n\nBoth parties must agree to submit their dispute to arbitration. Many contracts require that disputes be resolved through arbitration rather than through litigation.\n\nHowever, when an individual and a corporate entity collide legally, the arbitration system is loaded to favor the corporate by design.\n\nCorporations realize the obvious disadvantages of arbitration from the complainant’s perspective. Which is why most arbitration clauses require only the weaker party (the consumer, employee, or franchisee) to arbitrate its claims, while allowing the dominant party (the corporation) to sue in court.\n\nThe arbitration process is rife with conflicts of interest. Arbitration organizations, such as the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and the National Arbitration Forum (NAF), compete to provide arbitration services for companies.\n\nThe curtain was drawn back on the seamy side of arbitration in 2008 when San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera sued the for-profit NAF, citing state records (California is the only state that compels companies to make arbitration decisions public) showing that of 18,075 collection arbitrations it handled, consumers won just 30, or 0.2%.\n\nFor companies, the allure of arbitration grew after a 2011 Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for them to use the clauses to quash class-action lawsuits.\n\nPrevented from joining together as a group in arbitration, most plaintiffs would give up entirely.\n\nStill, there are thousands of individuals who — either out of necessity or on principle — want their grievances heard and have taken their chances in arbitration.\n\nLittle is known about arbitration because the proceedings are confidential and the federal government does not require cases to be reported. The secretive nature of the process makes it difficult to ascertain how fairly the proceedings are conducted.\n\nCase of multi-national corporations:\n\nHow law that was mean to be just and fair to all, became more favorable to a legal personality, rather than a natural person\n\nMany corporations operate at global level, beyond the reach of national governments. They play a major part in dictating the kind of development path humanity is following, based on the concept of endless economic growth. One little known fact is that, in addition to all their other privileges, corporations actually enjoy human rights, even though they clearly are not human beings.\n\nOn December 10 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It emerged as a direct result of the experience of the Second World War. Since then it has influenced most national constitutions and has served as the foundation for a growing number of national and international laws, and treaties, as well as regional, national, and sub-national institutions protecting and promoting human rights.\n\nIt may therefore come as a shock to realize that the word “everyone” throughout the whole of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and related instruments such as the European Convention on Human Rights includes more than just human beings, who are legally defined as “natural persons”. It may also include companies and corporations, because they too are defined as persons under the law once they have been “incorporated”. One definition of the word incorporate is: to give substance or material form to something, to embody it. Incorporation, as in the creation of a corporation or company, signifies creating a “legal person”. Once created, this legal person has rights, just as natural or human persons do.\n\nMore controversially, they may use their status as legal persons to claim aspects of human rights, such as freedom of speech in order to lobby and advertise. For example British American Tobacco claimed in 2008:\n\n\"Ability, both of manufacturers to communicate and consumers to receive information, is protected by Article 10 of the ECHR [European Convention on Human Rights], which recognizes free speech (including commercial free speech) as a fundamental right\".\n\nAlthough there are clearly reasons why tobacco companies might be considered less worthy of human rights protection than others, nevertheless the principle is clear: commercial statements by business, including advertising actually come under the jurisdiction of human rights law as (commercial) free speech.\n\nImbalance of Power. Corporations are legally more powerful than individuals.\n\nShould corporations be able to exercise such powers? Corporations have the resources to purchase the highest levels of skills and technology to exercise free speech: to advertise their products, develop their image and imprint their brand on the public imagination. Not content with advertising/commercial breaks, corporations are also able to purchase product placement to advertise particular goods in films and television in some parts of the world.\n\nQuestion of Libel\n\nSecondly, Libel laws give unequal powers to defend reputations. Corporations also use their status as legal persons to exploit libel laws in many national legislatures to defend their reputations.\n\nFor example, UK libel law has been widely criticized for curtailing freedom of speech and silencing legitimate criticism, but the law itself has not been changed, even though there is clearly a deterrent effect when legal persons have some of the same rights but far more resources with which to enforce them and prevent human persons from challenging them.\n\nAfter all, companies are \"legal persons\" – The view is that if \"natural persons\" can sue for libel, then so can companies.\n\nRights\n\nAnother consequence of human beings and corporations both being persons under the law, is that human beings cannot bring cases directly against corporations for human rights violations because human rights law is about protecting people (persons) against the state. Instead they have to use other laws, such as those regarding negligence, or environmental damage, or they must appeal to the state for redress. Addressing corporate abuses remains an incredibly slow and unequal struggle. Two examples are the Bhopal disaster of Union Carbide in India, or the case against Texaco in Ecuador.\n\nAlthough corporations are people (persons), they do not have bodies that can be imprisoned. They often create and use subsidiary corporations with no assets to carry out risky activities or accumulate liabilities. Such subsidiaries can later be dissolved. A corporation accused of corporate manslaughter may simply claim that an employee was behaving in a rogue manner and the corporation did not know what was happening. It may, in exceptional circumstances, be possible to “pierce the corporate veil” and hold individual employees of the company responsible for a crime, but such individuals are dispensable and their removal is unlikely to affect the continued “life” of the corporate legal person.\n\nCorporations as legal personalities, not only have greater powers than natural persons, they are now more powerful than many states. Their global reach puts them beyond the control of national governments, whose interests are in any case (as i have briefly talked about) often closely allied to those of the corporations, for example, in extracting critical resources from other countries. The World Trade Organization, which can bring sanctions against national governments and even force them to change their constitutions, may be seen in many ways as the creature and instrument of the corporations and those governments that benefit from corporate activities.\n\nThe contradictions involved in having persons (legal and natural) that are treated equally under human rights law, but are unequal in other important respects, pitted against each other in a competition for rights, need to be addressed. This would give human beings to try and bring themselves at par with getting equitable legal treatment with respect to corporations.\n\nGermany gets a notable mention, when it comes to protection of individual rights against a corporations. Case in point would their bankruptcy laws, where typically affected employees would tend to have their interests secured, by way of being given top priority in the list of secured or unsecured creditors. In other countries, employees typically below to the bottom of the list during an insolvency or a bankruptcy.\n\nStates need to do a better job of protecting people against corporate abuse, instead of siding with corporations against the people. IP and Patent Law is one great example, where individuals and corporations more or less, get a fair treatment from the states. Anyone with a valid IP protection can stand up against a big, giant corporation, and claim the IP ownership with relative ease and legal navigation.\n\nComments, discussions and feedback welcome."
