Many organizations have complied, only to find themselves locked into a cycle of perpetual statement-making that is often tangential to their organizational priorities or runs against their political spending. Companies would be wise to reconsider how they determine what to prioritize and discuss internally and externally — and perhaps most important, how to involve employees early in the process. To achieve this, design an organization in which regular discussions about social priorities is anticipated; ethical concerns are part of day-to-day work; politics are considered a healthy part of discourse; and everyone is attuned to how corporate choices impact human beings.",
