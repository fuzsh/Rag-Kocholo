The company contributed to the Swiss government-led development of the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers (ICoC).\n\nAs evidence of our commitment to these standards and to the work of these organisations, we attach our Iraq Operations - Statement of Conformance to principles which support ethical and compliant business practices. In addition, Control Risks' Iraq operations is accredited to ISO9001:2015, ISO18788:2015, PSC1:2012 and ISO45001:2018 which provides a framework for establishing, maintaining and improving the management of security operations.\n\nWe have stringent processes relating to subcontractors and suppliers and use an independent provider for our whistleblowing channel, in line with Transparency International’s guidance.\n\nControl Risks is committed to the highest corporate governance standards. We have governance, policies and structures to ensure we are managed with a high degree of accountability and transparency. Our board includes non-executive directors and has long-established nominations, remuneration, audit and ethics committees that fulfil roles equivalent to those of companies listed on the public markets.\n\nControl Risks is a private company, independent of any third party or controlling interests. The company is held through an employee ownership trust, ensuring no one person is in a position to exercise any influence or control over its strategic or operational decisions. These are reserved entirely to the board and senior executive team. Independence provides the platform from which to offer unbiased and objective advice that serves our clients’ best interests.\n\nControl Risks adheres strictly to a fully embedded Code of Ethics which summarises the principles that we live by and is overseen by an Ethics Committee. Additional guidelines for our employees include our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption policy and our Human Rights policy.\n\nAs part of our commitment to the highest governance and ethics standards, we recognise the importance of providing a channel for third parties to raise their concerns about any aspect of our work. We encourage third parties to contact our Ethics Committee to discuss any grievance. Further information is available which sets out how we will handle a third party’s grievance."
