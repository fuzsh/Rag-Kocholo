        "text": "History of banana republics\n\nIn Honduras the American-owned Cuyamel Fruit Company bought land for banana plantations in 1910. Banana fruit production was at the time dominated by the United Fruit Company, which was exporting bananas to the United States. In 1911 Cuyamel’s founder, Samuel Zemurray, orchestrated a coup d’état with the help of mercenary Lee Christmas. The coup replaced the Honduran government with a military government headed by Manuel Bonilla, who gave concessions to foreign businesses, which in turn acted as de facto rulers of the country. The resulting political instability led to economic stagnation; Honduras’s foreign debt grew, which further undermined Bonilla’s puppet government and gave the corporations more power. In 1933 Zemurray dissolved Cuyamel and took control of United Fruit, which then became the largest employer in Honduras until reforms in the 1940s.\n\nA similar sequence of events unfolded in Guatemala, where United Fruit played on the U.S. government’s fears of communism during the 1950s. Democratically elected as the president of Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz focused on major social reforms, which included nationalizing uncultivated land and distributing it to landless workers for cultivation, when he began his presidency in 1951. These reforms were significant threats to United Fruit. Arbenz, who was attacked as a communist sympathizer, was ousted in 1954 by a CIA-led coup called Operation Success and replaced with a pro-business leader. The Guatemalan government continued to be run by a series of U.S.-backed military rulers during a civil war that lasted from 1960 to 1996. Although democratically elected governments returned after 1996, economic inequality that has its roots in the United Fruit era continues into the 21st century in Guatemala, where more than half the population lives in poverty.\n\nThe United Fruit Company operated in Colombia too, and, while it did not overtly control the government as in Honduras and Guatemala, its ability to cut off Colombian trade with the United States gave the company significant leverage over the Colombian government. This leverage was put to use in 1928, when United Fruit workers started a strike for better working conditions. The company refused to negotiate with the workers and organized the deployment of the Colombian army against them, resulting in what became known as the Banana Massacre. (This massacre became more widely known through Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez’s depiction of it in One Hundred Years of Solitude [1967]. In the novel the arrival of an American banana company in the fictional town of Macondo leads to the killings of banana plantation workers and the economic downfall of Macondo.)\n\nIn another case of foreign fruit companies dominating local politics, King Kalakaua was forced to sign, in 1887, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This document, called the Bayonet Constitution because it was signed under threat of violence, was drafted by white businessmen affiliated with pineapple and sugar plantations. The constitution stripped the king of most of his powers while also disenfranchising most indigenous Hawaiian voters. When his successor, Queen Liliuokalani, seemed as if she would abrogate that constitution, the Committee of Safety, a group of American and European businessmen, seized power in 1893, with the help of a company of U.S. marines. A short-lived “republic,” which was in fact an oligarchy controlled by some of the same American and European businessmen, ensued until the administration of U.S. Pres. William McKinley annexed the islands as U.S. territory in 1900.\n\nThe Chilean poet Pablo Neruda wrote about the corporate dominance of Latin American countries in “United Fruit Co.,” from his epic poem Canto general (1950):\n\nThe United Fruit Company\n\nreserved for itself the most juicy\n\npiece, the central coast of my world,\n\nthe delicate waist of America.\n\nIt rebaptized these countries\n\nBanana Republics…."
