        "text": "One critical aspect of corporate governance is transparency between shareholders and management. Shareholders entrust managerial agents to run the firm’s operations while partaking in the profits from afar. This agency relationship creates information asymmetry between the passive shareholders and active day-to-day managers, limiting the shareholder’s ability to effectively monitor the firm’s operations (Jensen & Meckling, 1976).\n\nInformation disclosure, whether mandatory or voluntary, is an effective tool to mitigate this asymmetry. By requiring firms to periodically disclose material facts that may affect shareholders, policymakers minimize the informational gap between the parties and keep shareholders engaged. This exchange is especially relevant between shareholders and directors, who act as monitors and develop the firm’s long-term business strategy. The corporate literature often discusses increasing transparency with shareholders, specifically regarding topics like executive compensation, compliance and oversight, and ESG practices.\n\nREAD MORE »\n\nInternal Accounting Controls Provide All-Purpose SEC Enforcement and Continued Focus on Cyber\n\nLast month, the SEC announced another enforcement action emphasizing the need for early disclosure of cybersecurity events. In the recent action, the company had taken three weeks to act on internal alerts of malware on its network and experienced a ransomware attack that did not affect the company’s accounting systems. The SEC charged the company with failing to maintain internal accounting controls to limit unauthorized access to company assets and failing to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. The enforcement action continues the SEC’s pattern of enforcement based on an expansive view of internal accounting controls, following two prior cases alleging accounting controls violations for stock buyback authorizations that failed to satisfy the conditions for trading plans under Rule 10b5-1.\n\nREAD MORE »\n\nIdeal vs. Reality\n\nCompanies often argue that sustainability lies at the core of their business strategy and directly impacts their long-term profitability. At the individual company level, it pays more to operate sustainably – we know that allocating capital to R&D, investing in employees, aligning with our stakeholders and our long-term shareholders, sets us up for far greater value creation and ROI than grasping for short-term gains.\n\nIdeally, investors are rewarded for their patience when these sustainability initiatives pay off. But in the meantime, corporate leaders feel that their sustainability initiatives are being thwarted from almost every angle. Activists are riding an anti-ESG wave prioritizing short-term profitability, and many investors remain skeptical of corporate sustainability investments due to unclear payoffs, misaligned time horizons, and confusing messaging. Fearing for their future, many companies have changed tack from trumpeting sustainability efforts to “green hushing.”\n\nREAD MORE »\n\nWith signs of a measured return of the IPO markets, companies and investors are revisiting the fundamental question, “What do I need to look like to go public?”\n\nIn the pre-2020 market, a “unicorn” with a $1 billion valuation and $100 million in annual revenue was a promising IPO candidate (with some variation by vertical). But with the meteoric rise – and subsequent fall – of valuations over the past several years, what’s the right litmus test for IPO success? By some calculations, over 1,000 companies today claim a valuation of $1 billion or more on a post-money basis – but only a fraction of these unicorns are likely to reach IPO, whether due to underlying business fundamentals or macro dynamics that have resulted in companies staying private longer or pursuing M&A exits (Jamie Dimon, in his annual letter to shareholders, recently bemoaned that the number of publicly listed companies today has nearly halved from the mid-1990s). In particular, after the poor performance of many companies that went public via de-SPAC, it is clear that advisors and investors continue to be selective with their money and more rigorous in their views on listed companies’ prospects.\n\nREAD MORE »\n\nOn August 20, 2024, Judge Ada Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a permanent injunction setting aside the Federal Trade Commission’s final rule banning non-compete agreements in Ryan LLC v. FTC. Last month, the court afforded temporary relief as to the named plaintiffs only by issuing a preliminary injunction enjoining the rule’s application against them. In its most recent decision, the court specified that its ruling has permanent, nationwide effect. An appeal is likely to follow.\n\nSet to take effect on September 4, 2024, as previously discussed here, the final rule would have prohibited enforcement of non-compete covenants with respect to nearly all U.S. workers and would have required employers to notify affected workers that their non-competes are unenforceable. The rule provided only limited exceptions for non-competes entered into with “Senior Executives” (as defined in the rule) prior to the rule’s effective date and non-competes entered into in connection with the sale of a business. In reaching its decision, the Texas court ruled that the FTC lacks substantive rulemaking authority as to unfair methods of competition, and that the FTC’s promulgation of the final rule was arbitrary and capricious because it was unreasonably overbroad and lacked reasonable explanation.\n\nREAD MORE »"
