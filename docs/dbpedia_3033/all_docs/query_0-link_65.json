This chapter aims to illuminate the landscape of CSR, ESG, and their connection to compliance. Varying usage and mixed empirical research reveals that CSR and ESG lack a clearly defined connection to compliance. This indeterminacy extends to (1) whether CSR and ESG are correlated with or refer to greater levels of legal compliance, as well as (2) what it means for a corporation to “comply” with CSR or ESG goals in light of the proliferation of standards and metrics pertaining to sustainability and social impact. Exploring these topics through the U.S. perspective reflects that the business world is in a state of flux regarding how companies take account of their impact on stakeholders and the environment, and laws are evolving on issues such as sustainability disclosures that could help us better understand existing practices.",
