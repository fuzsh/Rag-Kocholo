There are 2 types of board structures that may be chosen (ie, monistic board structure or dualistic board structure).\n\nIn the event the monistic board structure is chosen, the public limited company may be managed by either:\n\nA collegial board of at least 3 directors, or 2 directors in case there are less than 3 shareholders,\n\nor if provided by the articles of association, a sole director.\n\nThe collegial board is responsible for making major business decisions and overseeing the general affairs of the company.

Steps to be taken to ensure that the old IRS taxpayer identification number is made available to the new entity.\n\nBelgian branch office of a foreign company\n\nNo separate and distinct legal entity from the foreign company. The legal representative must represent the foreign company with regard to the activities of its Belgian branch office.\n\nLimited liability company (Sociedade Limitada)\n\nSociedades Limitadas are regulated by Law 10,406/02 (Brazilian Civil Code) and residually, whenever set forth in their articles of association, by Law 6,404/76, as amended, which regulates Brazilian corporations.\n\nA Sociedade Limitada is simple to incorporate and operate as very few formalities are required for its organization and management.\n\nThe Sociedade Limitada is managed by the officers/managers, who run the day-to-day operations of the corporation, and may also have a board of directors, which, if appointed, will be responsible for making major business decisions and overseeing the general affairs of the company. The officers must be individuals appointed by the board of directors or by the quotaholders‚Äô meeting, in case the company does not have a board of directors, whilst the directors are elected by the company‚Äôs quotaholders. The management structure of a Sociedade Limitada is established in the company‚Äôs articles of association.\n\nCorporation (Sociedade An√¥nima)\n\nLegal entity suitable for several types of businesses and investments. Non-listed corporations are simple to incorporate and operate, but more formalities are required for its organization and management when compared to the Sociedade Limitada. One example is the mandatory publication of certain corporate acts.\n\nThe Sociedade An√¥nima is managed by the officers, who run the day-to-day operations of the corporation, and, in certain cases, by a board of directors, which is responsible for making major business decisions and overseeing the general affairs of the corporation. The officers must be individuals appointed by the board of directors or by the shareholders‚Äô meeting, in case the corporation does not have a board of directors, whilst the directors are elected by the corporation‚Äôs shareholders. The management structure of a Sociedade An√¥nima is established in the corporation‚Äôs bylaws and certain corporations, such as the publicly held corporations, shall, mandatorily appoint a board of directors.\n\nThe most common types of business organizations operating in Chile are (i) sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), or limited liability companies/partnerships; (ii) sociedades an√≥nimas (SA), or stock corporations or corporations; (iii) sociedades por acciones (SPA), or simplified corporations; and (iv) branches of foreign entities.\n\nLimited Liability Company (Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada or SRL)\n\nThis type of company is mainly regulated by Law No. 3.918 but also by rules applicable to general partnerships and by certain rules contained in the Commerce and Civil Codes. The liability of the members of an SRL is limited to the amount of their contributions or to the higher amount established in the bylaws. Equity rights can only be transferred with the unanimous approval of the partners. There is great flexibility as to the rules that may be included in the bylaws.\n\nThe SRL is managed as established in the bylaws. If the bylaws do not state who manages the company, management corresponds to partners, by themselves or by representatives. If a manager is not appointed, all partners may administrate the company. Bylaws may establish different management options, such as appointing certain partner or partners, third parties or even a board of directors.\n\nCorporation (Sociedad An√≥nima or S.A.)\n\nThis type of company is mainly regulated by Law No. 18.046 (the Corporations Act) as well as by the Corporations Regulations (Reglamento de Sociedades An√≥nimas).\n\nA corporation may be open (public), closed (private) or special. Open corporations are those that register, voluntarily or by legal obligation, their shares in the Securities Registry and are under control of the Financial Market Commission (Comisi√≥n para el Mercado Financiero or CMF). Special corporations are expressly established by law (e.g. banks and insurance companies). Closed corporations are those that do not qualify as open or special.\n\nIts capital is divided into shares, which may be transferred without limitation, except for certain exceptions such as those contained in shareholders‚Äô agreements. In private corporations, bylaws may establish certain restrictions on the transfer of shares, but in public corporations, this is not allowed. The liability of shareholders is limited to the amount of their capital contributions.\n\nManaged by a board of directors appointed by the shareholders. The board is responsible for administration and representation of the company and is entitled to delegate part of its powers to the CEO and other officers. A director's term of appointment, which is set forth in the bylaws, cannot exceed 3 years. Directors may also be re-elected indefinitely.\n\nSimplified Corporation (Sociedades por Acciones or SpA)\n\nSimplified corporations are regulated by special rules contained in the Commerce Code. They are also ruled by their bylaws and by the private corporations‚Äô rules in a suppletory manner. Unlike corporations, SpAs may be incorporated and operate with only 1 shareholder. The capital is divided into shares.\n\nLegal regulation for simplified corporations is more flexible than that of corporations as it allows special agreements regarding, for example, management, profit distributions, share ownership, multiple votes and restrictions to voting rights.\n\nManagement is flexible. Bylaws may establish different management options, such as appointing certain shareholder or shareholders, 3rd parties or a board of directors.\n\nIt is customary for simplified corporations to be managed by an administrator ‚Äì usually the shareholder ‚Äì who may act personally and/or through 1 or more agents and/or managers.\n\nBranch of a Foreign Legal Entity (Agencia)\n\nA branch acts as an alternative form of entity as it corresponds to the presence of a foreign company (ie, parent) in Chile that does not seek to incorporate a new company, but instead only establishes a branch of the existing foreign company. It is not a separate legal entity, except for in the case of certain tax purposes. The parent company is ruled by its local laws. The Commerce Code and the Corporations Act have certain special rules about the establishment and amendments of the branch for foreign companies and for-profit entities and corporations, respectively.\n\nIt is managed by an agent appointed by the parent. The parent grants the agent extensive power to act on its behalf in Chile. This power shall expressly mention that the agent acts in Chile under direct responsibility of the parent.\n\nUnder Colombian law, there are 5 types of commercial entities that can be incorporated:\n\nGeneral partnership (Sociedad Colectiva)\n\nPartners have subsidiary personal liability, and the partnership board is the highest corporate body. A minimum of 2 partners is required at all times. General Partnerships are closed companies where partners must manage the company themselves or unanimously authorize a third person to do so, as well as unanimously authorize total or partial assignment of participation in the company, or the possibility for partners to carry out similar lines of business on their own.\n\nLimited partnership (Sociedad en Comandita Simple y por Acciones)\n\nA hybrid type of company, where partners can either be managing partners or limited partners. Each type of partner has different levels of liability, functions, voting rights and participation in the company. There are also 2 types of limited partnerships under Colombian law. The simple limited partnership, where partner's contributions are established as participation quota or membership interests; and the share limited partnership, where partner's contributions are established as shares.\n\nLimited liability partnership (Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada)\n\nThe limited liability partnership is a hybrid type of company where partners can limit their responsibility to the amount of their contributions as a general rule, but there are certain exceptions, such as responsibility regarding taxation, labor regulation or if such extended responsibility is included in the company's bylaws. Limited liability companies must have a minimum of 2 partners and a maximum of 25.\n\nCorporation (Sociedad An√≥nima)\n\nGenerally, shareholders have limited liability to the amount of the partners¬¥ contributions. Nonetheless, the following exceptions may apply: (i) liability for outstanding obligations of the affiliate when the bankruptcy has been produced due to or as a result of the actions of the parent company; and (ii) subsidiary liability in compulsory liquidation proceeding when it has been proved that shareholders utilized the company to defraud creditors.\n\nA corporation must have the Shareholders General Assembly as the highest corporate body, a board of directors, a legal representative designated by the board of directors and a statutory auditor. A minimum of 5 shareholders is required, and it is generally used for large enterprises or financial institutions that are subject to control and surveillance of the Colombian Superintendence of Finance.\n\nSimplified stock company (Sociedad por Acciones Simplificada)\n\nMost recent and flexible type of the commercial entity created under Colombian legislation. Shareholders have no personal liability, as long as they refrain from employing the company for unlawful activities or engaging in actions aimed at defrauding 3rd parties. A simplified stock company must have a Shareholders General Assembly as the highest corporate body and a legal representative. It can have a board of directors if shareholders require it. A minimum of one shareholder is required and there is no maximum requirement.\n\nArticle 261 of the National Development Plan 2022-2026 (Law 2294 of 2023) of the current government modified the simplified stock companies‚Äô regime (Law 1258 of 2008) in order to authorize these types of companies to be issuers of securities, under the terms and conditions determined by the National Government through the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. However, as of this date, the regulation for the issuance of securities by simplified stock companies has not been enacted, hence, the authorization granted for these purposes has not yet entered into force.\n\nUnlimited partnership (ve≈ôejn√° obchodn√≠ spoleƒçnost, v.o.s.)\n\nA company in which at least 2 partners run their business under a common business name and are liable for all the partnership's debts to the full extent of their assets. Company does not need to have any registered capital. Monetary contributions of the shareholders to the company are voluntary. Each partner has a right to manage a partnership within the guidelines agreed by partners. 1 or more partners may, however, be entrusted with management responsibilities. All decisions are made jointly by all partners, unless articles of association stipulate that a majority vote is sufficient. Transfer of ownership interest is currently forbidden (may be inherited or may pass to a successor in title if permitted by the memorandum of association).\n\nLimited partnership (komanditn√≠ spoleƒçnost, k.s.)\n\nA company with 1 or more partners who are liable for the debts of the company to the full extent of their assets (unlimited partners), and 1 or more partners who are liable for the debts of the company up to the amount of their unpaid capital contributions (limited partners). A limited partner must contribute to the registered capital of a company in the amount provided for in the partnership contract. Unlike unlimited partners, limited partners are able to transfer their ownership interests. The limited partner must provide a monetary contribution.\n\nLimited liability company (spoleƒçnost s ruƒçen√≠m omezen√Ωm, s.r.o./spol. s r.o.)\n\nSeparate and distinct legal entity. Managed by 1 or more managing directors who are responsible for making major business decisions and overseeing general affairs of a corporation as well as the day-to-day operations of a stock corporation. One of the most common types of company in the Czech Republic. Registered capital consists of contributions by shareholders who are jointly and severally liable for the debts of a company up to the amount of the sum of their unpaid contribution to the registered capital. The company is liable for its debts to the full extent of its assets. A supervisory board may also be established; however, it is not mandatory.\n\nJoint stock company (akciov√° spoleƒçnost, a.s.)\n\nSeparate and distinct legal entity. Registered capital consists of shares with a certain nominal value. It is liable for its debts to the full extent of its assets. The governance system may be 2-tier with a board of directors (p≈ôedstavenstvo) and supervisory board (dozorƒç√≠ rada) or single-tier with an administrative board (spr√°vn√≠ rada). The company may issue registered or bearer shares. Bearer shares can be, however, issued only as dematerialized shares registered by the securities depository.\n\nSoci√©t√© par actions simplifi√©e (SAS)\n\nThe SAS is an increasingly used type of company, mainly because of its great flexibility and low capital requirements. The SAS is a more flexible corporate form than the SARL which is a more binding vehicle. The SAS is essentially a simplified form of the SA. It has a number of advantages due to its flexibility such as:\n\nThe law does not impose a particular management structure for the SAS; the president is the only compulsory corporate body\n\nThere is greater freedom for organizing the management and operating structures of an SAS and\n\nThe SAS does not have access to the capital markets and its shares cannot be listed on a stock exchange.\n\nSoci√©t√© √† responsabilit√© limit√©e (SARL)\n\nEasy to set up and operate. Relevant for small businesses. One or more directors, who must not be corporate entities, but do not need to be shareholders. The SARL is a widely utilized form of corporation in France, mainly due to the number of advantages it offers to small businesses, such as low capital requirements and simple rules and regulations. It is more restrictive and less flexible than the SAS. Sweat equity permitted: a shareholder offers the company his time, work and professional knowledge (does not contribute to forming the capital but has right to shares in the company, share of profits and participation in collective decisions).\n\nThe SARL does not have access to the capital markets and its shares cannot be listed on a stock exchange.\n\nSoci√©t√© anonyme (SA)\n\nThe SA is an historical legal form mainly used by large corporations in France, as it enables public offering of shares. Tailored for large companies needing external capital by resorting to the market, it is a very complex form of company, not commonly appropriate for a first incorporation in France.\n\nBranch of a foreign company\n\nUnder French law, an entity operating in France shall register with the French Registry of Commerce and Companies (RCS) only if it is conducting a \"commercial activity\". A foreign company is only required to register with the local Registry of Commerce and Companies when its operations in France constitute a permanent establishment, where an autonomous activity (as opposed to \"preparatory and auxiliary\" activities) is being conducted and managed by an agent of the foreign company or a person who may bind the foreign company vis-√†-vis third parties.\n\nUnder French law, the branch is a direct form of implantation in France of a foreign company. A branch is not a separate legal entity and is therefore deemed to be the same legal entity as the foreign company, which remains solely responsible for the operation of its branch in France.\n\nThe main difference between a French branch and a French subsidiary is that:\n\nA branch is a mere emanation of the parent company in France, with no legal existence or distinct assets or liabilities and\n\nA subsidiary is an independent entity with its own legal existence, bylaws and capital contributions.\n\nAs a consequence, the parent company:\n\nHas unlimited liability for any debts and liabilities incurred by the branch in France and\n\nHas limited liability for the debts and liabilities incurred by its subsidiary (provided that the subsidiary is not incorporated under the form of a partnership, ie, SNC or civil company) in case it becomes insolvent (ie, limited to its initial capital contribution and the amount of any shareholder's loan which cannot be reimbursed within the context of a liquidation due to insufficiency of assets).\n\nPrivate company limited by shares (Zrt.)\n\nPrivate company limited by shares (z√°rtk√∂ren mk√∂d r√©szv√©nyt√°rsas√°g or Zrt.) is a separate and distinct legal entity.\n\nA Zrt. is established with a predetermined amount of share capital. Such share capital is represented by shares with a face (par or nominal) value. The shares may be issued either as printed shares or dematerialized (ie, e-shares registered on a securities/investment account).\n\nThe owners of a Zrt. are the shareholders. Liability of the shareholders is limited to their respective share capital contributions.\n\nManaged by a board of directors, which is responsible for making major business decisions and overseeing the general affairs of the Zrt. Shareholders may also decide to appoint a single director instead of a board to perform the duties of the board of directors (references to ‚Äúboard of directors‚Äù throughout this guide should be interpreted accordingly).\n\nDirectors are elected by shareholders of a Zrt. Company managers (who must be employees of the company) may also be appointed by shareholders to assist the directors in day-to-day operations.\n\nLimited liability company (Kft.)\n\nLimited liability company (korl√°tolt felel≈ëss√©g≈± t√°rsas√°g or Kft.) is a separate and distinct legal entity.\n\nA Kft. is established with a predetermined amount of initial capital provided by its quotaholders. Equity contribution of such quotaholders is not ‚Äì and must not be ‚Äì embodied in any negotiable instrument (eg, share certificate). It is rather an abstract membership interest called business quota ( √ºzletr√©sz). A business quota may be split into several smaller business quotas, and a quotaholder can own more than 1 business quota (each of which can be transferred or encumbered separately). Liability of the quotaholders is limited to their capital contributions.\n\nManaged by managing directors appointed by quotaholders. Shareholders may also decide to set up a board of directors instead of appointing 1 or more individual managing directors (references to ‚Äúmanaging directors‚Äù throughout this guide should be interpreted accordingly). Company managers (who must be employees of the company) may also be appointed by quotaholders to assist managing directors in the day-to-day operations of the corporation.\n\nNote: Further corporate forms are also available: general partnership (k√∂zkereseti t√°rsas√°g or Kkt.), limited partnership (bet√©ti t√°rsas√°g or Bt.) and public company limited by shares (nyilv√°nosan m≈±k√∂d≈ë r√©szv√©nyt√°rsas√°g or Nyrt.). However, these corporate forms are not very common in the Hungarian market.\n\nLimited liability companies\n\nLimited liability companies incorporated in accordance with the Companies Act 1993 (Companies Act) are the most common corporate structure used in New Zealand. Limited liability companies generally limit the liability of shareholders, except: 1) to the extent of any amount unpaid on a share held by a shareholder, 2) as provided for under that company's constitution and 3) for other specific exceptions as set out in the Companies Act. The board of directors (Board) generally manages and supervises the conduct of business and the general affairs of companies (which, subject to certain limitations, may be delegated to a committee). Directors are generally appointed by way of ordinary resolution of a company's shareholders but can also be appointed by the Board, where the constitution or other governing document (as may be applicable) expressly provides a power of appointment.\n\nLimited liability companies with 50 or more shareholders (and 50 or more share parcels) and assets of at least NZD30 million (including the assets of their respective subsidiaries) or revenue of at least NZD15 million (including the revenue of their subsidiaries) are ‚Äúcode companies‚Äù for the purposes of the Takeover Regulations 2000 and the Takeovers Code. Code companies are subject to the provisions of the Takeovers Code and are subject to strict requirements when shareholders (including their respective associates) wish to hold 20 percent or more of the shares on issue or wish to increase their shareholding beyond 20 percent in the code company.\n\nLimited liability companies that wish to list on a licensed market operated by NZX Limited, including the NZX, will be subject to the relevant listing rules and other legislative requirements (including the Companies Act and the NZX listing rules) and will also be considered code companies under the Takeovers Code. There is no limit on public companies‚Äô ability to raise funds from the public (either through an initial public offer ‚Äì or IPO ‚Äì or through a post-listing capital raise or rights issue), provided that the various disclosure requirements and other statutory rules are complied with, including those set out in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA).\n\nBranch\n\nOverseas companies ‚Äúcarrying on business‚Äù in New Zealand must register as a branch of an overseas company with the New Zealand Companies Office (Companies Office). The Companies Office is a government agency in New Zealand that provides business registry services in relation to corporate entities, personal property and capital market securities. The term ‚Äúcarrying on business‚Äù is not comprehensively defined under New Zealand law, although it generally captures businesses that have employees in New Zealand, have an office or business premises in New Zealand or that regularly transact business in New Zealand. For this reason, it is advisable that foreign companies seek professional advice before commencing business in New Zealand to ensure compliance with New Zealand law.\n\nNote: In addition to the above, there are other forms of legal entity that can be established under New Zealand law, including a general partnership, limited partnership and trust. However, these are less commonly used in New Zealand for business purposes and are not considered further.\n\nThe most common types of business organizations operating in Peru are (i) sociedades an√≥nimas (S.A.), or stock corporations or corporations; (ii) sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.R.L.), or limited liability companies/partnerships; and, (iii) branches of foreign entities.\n\nCorporation (Sociedad An√≥nima or S.A.)\n\nThis type of company is mainly regulated by Law No. 26887 (the Corporations Act), as well as by the Corporations‚Äô Registry Regulations (Reglamento del Registro de Sociedades).\n\nA corporation may be open (public), in which case it would be a sociedad an√≥nima abierta (S.A.A.) or private, in which case it could be: (i) a closed stock corporation or sociedad an√≥nima cerrada (S.A.C.); or, (ii) a regular corporation or sociedad an√≥nima (S.A.).\n\nOpen corporations are those that register, voluntarily or by legal obligation, their shares in the Public Registry of the Securities Market of the Superintendency of the Securities Market (Registro P√∫blico del Mercado de Valores de la Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores) and are under control of such Superintendency. Closed stock corporations are those incorporated as such and may not have more than 20 shareholders. Finally, corporations are those that do not qualify as open or closed.\n\nA corporation share capital is divided into shares. In case of open corporations, the shares may be transferred without limitation. Restrictions to shares‚Äô transfers regulated in their bylaws or in shareholders‚Äô agreements are not enforceable. On the contrary, a right of first refusal applies to closed stock corporations, unless otherwise provided in their bylaws. In case of regular corporations, the shares may be transferred without limitation, except if certain restrictions are established in their bylaws or in shareholders‚Äô agreements.\n\nThe liability of shareholders is limited to the amount of their contributions to capital.\n\nCorporations (except for some closed stock corporations) are managed by a board of directors, formed by -at least- 3 members, appointed by the shareholders. The board is responsible for the administration and representation of the company and is entitled to delegate part of its powers to the CEO and other officers. A director's term of appointment, which is set forth in the bylaws, cannot be less than 1 year and shall not exceed 3 years. Directors may also be re-elected indefinitely.\n\nIf the shareholders of a closed stock corporation decide so, such entity could refrain from having a board of directors, in which case it would be managed by a CEO.\n\nLimited Liability Company (Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada or S.R.L.)\n\nThis type of company is mainly regulated by Law No. 26887 (the Corporations Act), as well as by the Corporations‚Äô Registry Regulations (Reglamento del Registro de Sociedades). The liability of the members of a S.R.L. is limited to the amount of their contributions. A right of first refusal shall always be applicable and equity rights may only be transferred by virtue of a public deed that shall be recorded before the Public Registry of the domicile of the corresponding entity. There is great flexibility as to the rules that may be included in the bylaws.\n\nThe management of a S.R.L. is entrusted to 1 or more managers (whether partners or not), who shall represent it in all matters relating to its company purpose. The managers are prohibited to engage (for their own account or for the account of others) in the same type of business that corresponds to the company purpose.\n\nBranch of a Foreign Legal Entity (Sucursal)\n\nA branch acts as an alternative form of entity, as it corresponds to the presence of a foreign company (the parent company) iin Peru that does not seek to incorporate a new company, but instead only establishes a branch of the existing company. It is not a separate legal entity, except for tax purposes. The parent company is ruled by its local laws, but shall comply with the applicable Peruvian legislation regarding the obligations undertaken by the branch in Peru. The Corporations Act contains certain special rules regarding the establishment (and amendments) of a branch by foreign companies.\n\nA branch is managed by a permanent legal representative appointed by the parent company.\n\nSubsidiary\n\nA subsidiary is a domestic stock corporation, either wholly or partially owned (but controlled) by a foreign corporation. It has a separate and distinct legal entity from its parent. It is managed by its board of directors, which exercises all corporate powers, conducts all business and controls all property of the corporation.\n\nDirectors are elected by the stockholders themselves. Officers are elected by the directors, and they perform the duties imposed on them by law and the bylaws of the corporation.\n\nBranch office\n\nIt is an extension of, and not a separate and distinct entity from, the foreign corporation. It carries out business activities of the head office and derives income from the Philippines. A resident agent is designated, to whom summons and other legal processes may be served on behalf of the foreign corporation.\n\nRepresentative office\n\nIt is an extension of, and not a separate and distinct entity from, the foreign corporation. It deals directly with the clients of the head office in the Philippines but does not derive income from the country and is fully subsidized by its head office. A resident agent is designated, to whom summons and other legal processes may be served on behalf of the foreign corporation.\n\nRegional or area headquarters\n\nIt is an administrative branch of a multinational company and, thus, not a separate and distinct legal entity. It is established to supervise, communicate and coordinate the multinational company's subsidiaries, affiliates and branches in the Asia-Pacific region. It is not allowed to do business or derive any income from sources within the Philippines. Its operations must be fully subsidized by way of inward remittances from its head office.\n\nRegional operating headquarters\n\nIt is an administrative branch of a multinational company and, thus, not a separate and distinct legal entity. It is established to perform qualifying services to the multinational company's affiliates, subsidiaries or branches in the Philippines, the Asia-Pacific region and other foreign markets. It is prohibited from offering its services to entities other than the foregoing. It is also prohibited, directly or indirectly, to solicit or market goods and services on behalf of the multinational company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries. It is allowed to derive income from sources within the Philippines.\n\nPartnership\n\nPartnership has a legal personality separate and distinct from its partners. Generally, each partner is considered an agent of the partnership and their acts are binding, unless otherwise provided in the articles of partnership. A foreign corporation may be a partner in a domestic partnership only after such foreign corporation obtained a license to transact business in the Philippines.\n\nOne Person Corporation\n\nThe Revised Corporation Code (RCC) introduced the new concept of a One Person Corporation (OPC), which is defined as ‚Äúa corporation with a single stockholder.‚Äù This corporation may only be formed by a natural person, trust or an estate. Banks and quasi-banks, preneed, trust, insurance, public and publicly listed companies, and non-chartered government-owned and -controlled corporations are not allowed to incorporate as OPCs. Further, a natural person who is licensed to exercise a profession is also generally not allowed to organize as OPC for the purpose of exercising such profession, except as otherwise provided under special laws. Similar to ordinary corporations, an OPC has no minimum capital stock requirement. Unlike an ordinary corporation, however, an OPC is not required to submit corporate bylaws.\n\nThe single stockholder serves as the sole director and president of the OPC. The OPC is required to appoint a treasurer, corporate secretary and other officers as necessary within 15 days from the issuance of its certificate of incorporation. However, the single stockholder is proscribed from being appointed as the corporate secretary.\n\nThe single stockholder is required to designate a nominee and an alternate nominee who shall take their place as director in the event of their death or incapacity. The extent and limitations of the authority of the nominee and alternate nominee shall be stated in the articles of incorporation. The nominee and alternate nominee may be changed at any time and without need of amendment of the articles of incorporation.\n\nIn case of death or permanent incapacity, the nominee shall sit as director only until the legal heirs of the single stockholder have been lawfully determined, and the heirs have designated 1 of them or have agreed that the estate shall be the single stockholder.\n\nIn lieu of meetings, a written resolution signed and dated by the single stockholder and recorded in the minutes book shall be sufficient when action is needed on any matter. Aside from the minutes book, the OPC shall also be required to submit reportorial requirements. Failure to submit such requirements 3 times within a period of 5 years may place the OPC under delinquent status. The reportorial requirements are as follows:\n\nAnnual financial statements\n\nA report containing explanations or comments by the president on every qualification, reservation or adverse remark or disclaimer made by the auditor in the latter‚Äôs report\n\nA disclosure of all self-dealings and related party transactions and\n\nOther reports required by the SEC.\n\nThe RCC allows the conversion from an ordinary corporation to an OPC and from an OPC to an ordinary stock corporation. An ordinary stock corporation may be converted to an OPC when the single stockholder acquires all the stocks of an ordinary stock corporation and files an application for conversion with the SEC. An OPC may be converted into an ordinary stock corporation after due notice to the SEC of such fact and of the circumstances leading to the conversion. One such circumstance provided by the law is the death of the single stockholder. In such a case, the legal heirs may decide to either wind up and dissolve the OPC or convert it into an ordinary stock corporation.\n\nPortuguese law provides for various types of companies, 2 of which are most commonly used:\n\nLimited liability companies by shares ( S .A . or Sociedade An√≥nima) and\n\nLimited liability companies by quota (or Sociedade por Quotas).\n\nLDA. Companies\n\nThese companies are incorporated with at least 2 shareholders. There is also a sub-type of company bearing 1 single shareholder, being in this case identified by the denomination Sociedade Unipessoal LDA. (sole shareholder company). However, an individual may only be the sole shareholder of 1 Sociedade Unipessoal.\n\nThe share capital in these companies is divided in quotas[1]. As a rule, and upon incorporation, each shareholder has 1 single quota, which nominal value may vary from EUR1 to any given amount. Consequently, the minimum share capital of LDA. companies is EUR2, and for the Sociedade Unipessoal sub-type, the minimum share capital is EUR1.\n\nQuotas are registered with the Commercial Registrar of Companies, do not have a physical existence, and cannot be listed in a Stock Exchange.\n\nLDA. companies have a simplified governance structure, comprising the following corporate bodies:\n\nGeneral Meeting (which in the case of a Sociedade Unipessoal is assured by the sole shareholder)\n\n1 or more directors.\n\nThese companies are also required to enroll 1 accountant (TOC).\n\nAdditionally, 1 Independent Auditor (Revisor Oficial de Contas) or a Supervisory Board (Conselho Fiscal) is required should, for a period of 2 years, any 2 of the following thresholds are met:\n\nBalance exceeds EUR1.5 million.\n\nTotal turnover and other revenue of at least EUR3 million.\n\nAverage number of 50 or more employees.\n\nS.A. Companies\n\nThese companies are incorporated with at least 5 shareholders, except in cases where a company is the sole shareholder.\n\nThe share capital is represented by shares which can have, or not, a nominal value. In the first case, all shares must have the same nominal value. The minimum nominal value ‚Äì or, for shares with no nominal value, the minimum issue value ‚Äì is of EUR 0.01. In any case, the minimum share capital required is EUR 50,000.\n\nShares are nominative, and may be in book entry form, or titled, and are registered (i) with the company, in a share ledger book, (ii) in a banking entity or (iii) in a central registration entity.\n\nGovernance structure is more complex than LDA. companies, and 3 different governance structures are available:\n\n1) Portuguese ‚Äútraditional‚Äù system:\n\nGeneral meeting\n\n1 director (provided the share capital remains below EUR200,000), or a board of directors (more than 1 member and not necessarily in an odd number)\n\nSupervisory body, which may be:\n\n1 Independent Auditor (plus its substitute; both the auditor and the substitute must be chartered accountants or a chartered accountants‚Äô firm), or\n\nA supervisory board (minimum of 3 members plus 1 substitute; at least 1 of the effective members must be a chartered accountant or a chartered accountants‚Äô firm), plus a chartered accountant or a chartered accountant firm (mandatory for Stock Exchange listed companies)\n\n2) 2-tier system:\n\nGeneral meeting\n\nA 2-tier board structure comprising: (i)\n\nthe general and supervisory board and (ii) the\n\nexecutive board of directors or 1 executive director (provided the share capital remains below EUR200,000).\n\n1 independent auditor\n\n3) 1-tier system:\n\nGeneral meeting\n\nA board of directors which includes an audit committee of no fewer than 3 members\n\n1 independent auditor\n\nA company secretary (who must have an appropriate degree or be a paralegal) is only mandatory for Stock Exchange listed companies.\n\n[1] Normally also translated as shares, quotas are nonetheless subject to a different legal regime under Portuguese law.\n\nJoint-stock company (public and non-public)\n\nA commercial organization the charter capital of which is divided into a definite number of shares. Shares qualify as securities under Russian law. The shareholders of the company are not liable for the obligations of the company and bear the risk of losses in connection with the company‚Äôs activity within the cost of shares in their possession.\n\nManaged by the general shareholders' meeting, the highest governing body of the company, which is responsible for major decisions regarding the company (eg, amending the charter, reorganization and liquidation, distribution of profit, approving annual reports and some deals); by the executive body (ie, managing director or managing director and directorate) which is responsible for day-to-day activities of the company; and by the board of directors, which is responsible for overseeing the general affairs of the company.\n\nThe company may also opt to have 2 or more managing directors who may act separately or jointly.\n\nIn a company with less than 50 shareholders, the charter of the company may provide that the functions of the board of directors of the company shall be carried out by the general shareholders' meeting.\n\nLimited liability company\n\nA commercial organization, the charter capital of which is divided into participatory interests. Participatory interests do not qualify as securities under Russian law. The company members are not liable for the obligations of the company and bear the risk of losses in connection with the company‚Äôs activity within the cost of the contributions they have made.\n\nManaged by the general members' meeting, the highest management body of the company, which is responsible for major decisions regarding the company (eg, amending the charter, reorganization and liquidation, approving annual reports) by the executive body (ie, the managing director or managing director and directorate), which is responsible for day-to-day activities of the company and, in some cases, by the board of directors, which is responsible for overseeing the general affairs of the company.\n\nThe company may also opt to have 2 or more managing directors who may act separately or jointly.\n\nLimited company (aktiebolag or AB)\n\nA limited company (Aktiebolag or AB) is a separate and distinct legal entity. Managed by a board of directors, which is responsible for making major business decisions and overseeing general affairs of a company. Directors are elected by shareholders of an AB. The managing director (optional in private ABs and required in public ABs), who runs the day-to-day operations of an AB, is appointed by the board of directors. Other officers are appointed by the board of directors or by the managing director.\n\nTrading partnership (handelsbolag, HB)\n\nUnder the Partnership and Non-registered Partnership Act (Handelsbolagslagen), a trading partnership (Handelsbolag or HB) is constituted by an agreement between 2 or more individuals and/or legal entities to conduct business in association. The HB's most frequently cited advantage is its flexibility. Partners are free to organize their relations as they see fit without the restraints of a corporate form. Within the framework of an HB, complex structures can be set up to allow for many different characteristics and circumstances. The partners in an HB are personally liable for the partnership's agreements and debts.\n\nLimited partnership (kommanditbolag or KB)\n\nA limited partnership (Kommanditbolag or KB) is a form of a trading partnership in which 1 or more partners has reserved the right not to be liable for the obligations of a KB in excess of the sum he they have contributed or undertaken to contribute to a KB. Such a partner is referred to as a limited partner (Kommanditdel√§gare).\n\nOther partners in a KB are referred to as general partners (Komplement√§r). A KB must have 2 or more partners, at least 1 general partner and 1 limited partner.\n\nThe partnership's most frequently cited advantage is its flexibility. Partners are free to organize their relations as they see fit without the restraints of a corporate form. Within the framework of a partnership, complex structures can be set up to allow for many different characteristics and circumstances.\n\nBranch office (filial, Branch)\n\nA branch (Filial) is the branch office of a foreign company with a separate management in Sweden. A branch is not a separate legal entity. A foreign company may only have 1 branch in Sweden. A branch has no independent capital, and its assets and liabilities are a part of the total assets of the foreign company.\n\nJoint-stock company (JSC)\n\nCapital company with a legal personality. General assembly of shareholders is the highest decision-making body in a JSC. Power to manage business and affairs of a JSC is vested in its board members. Board members act as a corporate body and may have 1 or more members. Board members are not required to have a share in the company. Board members can transfer their duties and authorities to 1 or more director or a 3rd party.\n\nLimited liability company (LLC)\n\nCapital company with a legal personality. General assembly of partners is the ultimate decision-making body in LLC. Management rights and duties of LLC are conferred to the managers. At least 1 partner must have management rights and representation power of an LLC as a manager. It is also possible to appoint 3rd-party individuals, who are not partners of the LLC, as managers.\n\nOther business forms\n\nBranch offices (BO)\n\nBOs may carry out the business their principal company is conducting and freely enjoy the right to pursue commercial activities. A foreign principal company remains liable for all debts of the BO. BOs have autonomous capital and accounting to carry out commercial transactions with 3rd parties, although they are closely associated with the principal company in respect of internal management. This means that rights, debts, profits and losses of the BOs are assumed by the principal company. A BO can only engage in activities of its principal company. Although there is no legal capital requirement for BOs, it is required that the principal company maintains capital that is sufficient to run the BO in practice.\n\nLiaison Offices (LO)\n\nLO can only provide \"representation\" and \"relationship management\" with respect to the overseas principal company's Turkish customers and suppliers, but it cannot engage in any commercial or trading activity.\n\nThe below summary provides an overview of 2 corporate structures that are commonly used in Ukraine. Other alternatives provided by law, such as private enterprise, additional liability company, general partnership and limited partnership, may be used, but are less common due to their legal uncertainty and additional liability for their participants.\n\nIt is also possible for a foreign company to establish a representative office which, however, is not a separate company, and the parent company remains liable for all obligations of such representative office.\n\nLimited Liability Company (LLC)\n\nSeparate and distinct legal entity. Subject to certain exceptions, participants (shareholders) are not liable for debts and obligations of the company\n\nTaxed on its earnings at a corporate level and participants taxed on any distributed dividends\n\nManagement and organization governed by charter (articles of association) and internal Director (board of directors) has overall management responsibility\n\nEvent-driven filings must be made from time to time, such as in the case of changes of director(s), ultimate beneficial owners or other corporate details; accuracy of information on the ultimate beneficial owners should be confirmed each time when the filing is made.\n\nFollowing the introduction of martial law in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the deadlines for any UBO filings and filings related to changes in the ownership structure were suspended. The deadlines will be resumed not earlier than 3 months following the termination or cancellation of martial law. However, legal entities may voluntarily submit information on UBOs during martial law.\n\nFrom January 2023, LLC may choose to keep the shares records in the companies register as before or switch to the accounting system of shares maintained by the Central Depository in the manner established by the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (the Securities Commission) . The Securities Commission adopted the procedure for maintaining the accounting system for shares of limited liability company and additional liability company, approved by Securities Commission's decision No. 525 dated May 17, 2023 (shares accounting system), which became effective on January 1, 2024.\n\nIn order to switch to the new accounting system the following steps should be taken:\n\nTaking a unanimous decision of a general meeting of participants to switch to the shares accounting in the shares accounting system with respect to all shares;\n\nEntering into an agreement with the Central Depository regarding the shares accounting in the shares accounting system;\n\nSubmitting necessary documents to the Central Depository.\n\nThe Central Depository shall submit to the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine an application in electronic form for the state registration of information on accounting of company's shares in the shares accounting system no later than 3 working days after (i) receiving duly executed documents; and (ii) signing the agreement regarding shares accounting in the shares accounting system.\n\nJoint-Stock Company (JSC)\n\nDistinct legal entity separated from its shareholders. Subject to certain exceptions, shareholders are not liable for debts and obligations of the company\n\nThe law provides for 2 types of JSCs: public and private. The main differences between the two types of JSCs are:\n\nShares of public JSCs are publicly traded on stock exchanges, while shares of private JSCs are placed among a limited number of persons\n\nShareholders of JSCs may sell or otherwise transfer their shares without the consent of other shareholders of JSC.\n\nWhen convening the general shareholders‚Äô meeting, in addition to notifications to shareholders, on own website and in the public database of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (the Securities Commission), public JSCs shall also notify the stock exchange where its shares are traded\n\nJSC may have a one-tier or two-tier governance structure. In a one-tier governance structure, the management bodies of a JSC are a general meeting and board of directors. In a two-tier governance structure, the management bodies of a JSC are a general meeting, supervisory board and board of directors or sole director\n\nAppointment of a corporate secretary in public JSCs is mandatory\n\nMembers of the supervisory board of a public JSC are elected only through cumulative voting, and the minimum number of members is 5\n\nMandatory establishment of an (i) audit committee, (ii) remuneration committee and (iii) appointment committee in the supervisory board of a public JSC\n\nAnnual financial statements of public JSCs shall be audited by an independent auditor and\n\nWhen considering a prior approval for execution of a related party transaction, the supervisory board or board of directors of a public JSC shall engage an independent auditor, evaluator (or obtain a decision of an audit committee, if established), and, if approved, publish the essential terms of such transaction.\n\nJSC is a less common form than LLC as it has more regulated corporate procedures and less flexibility in adopting corporate decisions. In addition, the law provides for more strict and extensive reporting and notification procedures, including to the Securities Commission\n\nTaxed on its earnings at a corporate level and shareholders taxed on any distributed dividends\n\nMust file annual report to the Securities Commission, which is publicly available, and\n\nEvent-driven filings must be made from time to time, such as in the case changes of members of executive and supervisory bodies or other corporate details; during all such filings accuracy of information on the ultimate beneficial owners should be confirmed each time when the filing is made.\n\nThe most commonly adopted legal structures in mainland UAE are a limited liability companies (LLC) and a branch office (Branches). In addition, it is also possible to establish a representative office (also known as a liaison office) which is a legal structure identical to that of a Branch, however its activities are limited to serving as an administrative and marketing center for the parent company (Rep Office).\n\nIt is also possible to establish an entity in 1 of the free zones in the UAE. Entities registered in a free zone can be wholly foreign owned and no UAE participation is required. The free zone entity can take the form of a free zone limited liability company (FZ-LLC) or a free zone branch office (FZ-Branch).\n\nLLC\n\nSeparate and distinct legal entity with limited liability.\n\nFederal Decree-Law No. 32 of 2021 on Commercial Companies was enacted to replace the previous companies‚Äô law and to allow foreign investors to own 100 percent shares in UAE companies without requiring a UAE national partner, except for specific business activities and sectors. Each Emirate‚Äôs Department of Economic Development has a list of approved business activities for foreign companies.\n\nThe UAE actively encourages investment in growing sectors, such as fintech, e-commerce, agritech, healthcare, education, tourism, space, logistics services, ICT, manufacturing, medical tourism, renewable energy, media and entertainment, creative industries, gaming and smart cities. However, full ownership of companies within these sectors is subject to regulations of the respective governing bodies.\n\nBranch\n\nA branch is not regarded as a separate entity but treated as an extension of its parent company. Currently pursuant to the recent changes in the UAE law, a branch no longer requires a UAE national or a company wholly owned by UAE nationals to act as its national agent (colloquially known as a \"sponsor\" and is not to be confused with a commercial agent).\n\nFZ-LLC\n\nSeparate and distinct legal entity with limited liability. No restriction on the nationality of shareholders. Activities restricted to the free zone in which the company is incorporated and those the company is licensed to carry out.\n\nFZ-Branch\n\nA Branch is not regarded as a separate entity but treated as an extension of its parent company.\n\nDual License Branch\n\nA dual licence branch is a branch of an FZ-LLC registered in mainland UAE. It is not treated as a separate entity but treated as an extension of its parent company. Establishing a dual licence branch is possible in the case of FZ-LLCs registered in certain free zones only. Also, dual licences are only issued for FZ-LLCs conducting professional services ‚Äì trading activities are not typically included on dual licences. It may operate from the same office as its parent company without the need for a separate registered address.\n\nPrivate limited company\n\nSeparate and distinct legal entity. Managed by directors who are responsible for making major decisions and overseeing the general affairs of the company. Subject to the articles of the company, the shareholders and the board of directors generally have the power to appoint and remove directors.\n\nPublic limited company\n\nA further alternative, being a public limited company, which is a company limited by shares or guarantee. This form of entity could be useful in some instances (as, unlike a private limited company, it enables capital to be raised from the public), but as it is a less commonly used type of company it is not covered in this guide.\n\nLimited liability partnership\n\nDistinct legal entity separate from its members. Subject to certain exceptions (such as fraud), members are not liable for debts and obligations of the company.\n\nFlexibility in management and organization. Management and organization are governed by a confidential LLP agreement. Designated members are responsible for certain statutory requirements (such as signing annual accounts). An LLP must have 2 designated members carrying on lawful business with a view of profit.\n\nRegistered UK establishment\n\nA registered UK establishment is a UK registration of an overseas company. It has no separate legal personality to the overseas company. The overseas company continues to be managed by the directors and shareholders of the overseas company.\n\nA number of responses in this checklist are \"not applicable\" on the basis that the UK establishment is merely a registration of an overseas company and therefore any rules, regulations are other requirements are primarily governed by the laws of the country of incorporation."
