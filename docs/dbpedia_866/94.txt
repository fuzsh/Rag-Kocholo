Durham County Local History Society

The Society is a registered charity (no. 235597) formed in 1964 to encourage and promote interest in the study of the history of County Durham.

It particularly focuses on recent centuries when County Durham was playing a major part in the economic and industrial growth of Britain and also making its individual contribution to the social, religious and political development of our country.

The Society attends events promoting local history, issues a range of publications, arranges occasional talks free to non-members and maintains this website.

The Journal, available free to members, includes original contributions on Durham's history, articles on sources and reviews of books.

Other publications, covering original research on a wide range of local topics, are made available to members at reduced prices.
