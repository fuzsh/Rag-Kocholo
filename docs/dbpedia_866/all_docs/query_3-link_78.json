        "text": "Union Unite has called on the Government to extend a contract for the Hitachi rail plant in County Durham as fears grow for the future of the site.\n\nThe factory is currently working on contracts for West Coast and East Midlands railways but work on them is set to come to an end towards the end of this year. Last week both Shadow Transport Minister Louise Haigh and Sedgefield Conservative MP Paul Howell raised concerns over the plant’s fate in the House of Commons.\n\nUnite said the West Coast contract contains an option to purchase more trains, but delays at the Department of Transport (DfT) and other parties means the factory is facing a production gap.\n\nRead more:Wootzano secures massive Canadian contract\n\nGo here for more North East business news\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “The Government needs to pull its finger out and tender the extension of the West Coast contract to Hitachi immediately. Ministers talk a good game about levelling up. The fact is, however, that at both Hitachi in Newton Aycliffe and Alstom in Derby, workers are in disbelief that ministerial incompetence is delaying announcements that would safeguard highly skilled jobs.”\n\nFears over the future of the UK train building sector first emerged last year when French firm Alstom, which has a major plant at Derby, said it was consulting on hundreds of redundancies because of a lack of new orders. Alstom and Hitachi had previously won a contract to provide trains for the HS2 link, though the companies’ current problems are not thought to be linked to the Government’s decision to abandon the northern leg of that scheme.\n\nLast week in Parliament, Transport Minister Huw Merriman said there was a “lag with the order book” as most of the train fleet was under the age at which it needed replacing.\n\nHe said: “We are doing everything we can to work with all four train manufacturers to bring more tenders through. Those will be for TransPennine Express, for Northern, for South-Eastern and, as the Secretary of State mentioned, for Chiltern, but the work goes in partnership between the train manufacturers, and the Secretary of State and the department to find a resolution. We hope to do so.”\n\nAt the end of last year, Hitachi highlighted a range of challenges it was facing at Newton Aycliffe and said that had resulted in it reducing its valuation of the plant by nearly £65m. But it stressed that did not mean that the future of the plant was at threat.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Rail manufacturing plays an important role in growing the UK economy, supporting British jobs, and delivering better services for passengers. The Government is committed to supporting the entire sector and is working with all rolling stock manufacturers, including Hitachi, on the future pipeline of orders which we expect to remain strong in the coming years.”"
