        "meta_description": "Railroad - History, Development, Impact: The earliest railroads reinforced transportation patterns that had developed centuries before. During the Middle Ages most heavy or bulky items were carried by water wherever possible. Where natural interconnection among navigable rivers was lacking, gaps in trade were likely to develop, most notably at watersheds. By the 16th century canal building was being widely used in Europe to integrate waterway systems based on natural streams. During the Industrial Revolution canal networks became urgent necessities in western Europe and the western Mediterranean. In Britain and France the increased use of coal for raising steam and for iron smelting greatly increased the",

        "text": "The Stockton and Darlington Railway\n\nGeorge Stephenson was the son of a mechanic and, because of his skill at operating Newcomen engines, served as chief mechanic at the Killingworth colliery northwest of Newcastle upon Tyne, Eng. In 1813 he examined the first practical and successful steam locomotive, that of John Blenkinsop, and, convinced that he could offer improvements, designed and built the Blücher in 1814. Later he introduced the “steam blast,” by which exhaust was directed up the chimney, pulling air after it and increasing the draft. His success in designing several more locomotives brought him to the attention of the planners of a proposed railway linking the port of Stockton with Darlington, eight miles inland.\n\nInvestment in the Bishop Auckland coalfield of western County Durham was heavily concentrated in Darlington, where there was agitation for improvement in the outward shipment of the increasing tonnages produced. The region had become the most extensive producer of coal, most of which was sent by coastal sloop to the London market. The mining moved inland toward the Pennine ridge and thus farther from the port at Stockton-on-Tees, which in 1810 had been made a true seaport by completion of the Tees Navigation. A canal linking the cities had been proposed in a survey by James Brindley as early as 1769 but was rejected because of cost, and by the early 19th century several of the gravity tramways or railways on Tyneside had been fitted with primitive locomotives. In 1818 the promoters settled on the construction of a railway, and in April 1821 parliamentary authorization was gained and George IV gave his assent.\n\nWhile construction was under way on the 40-km (25-mile) single-track line, it was decided to use locomotive engines as well as horse traction. Construction began on May 13, 1822, using both malleable iron rails (for two-thirds the distance) and cast iron and set at a track gauge of 1,422 mm (4 feet 8 inches). This gauge was subsequently standardized, with 13 mm (one-half inch) added at a date and for reasons unknown.\n\nOn September 27, 1825, the Stockton and Darlington Railway was completed and opened for common carrier service between docks at Stockton and the Witton Park colliery in the western part of the county of Durham. It was authorized to carry both passengers and freight. From the beginning it was the first railroad to operate as a common carrier open to all shippers. Coal brought to Stockton for sale in the coastal trade dropped in price from 18 shillings to 12 shillings a ton. At that price the demand for coal was greater than the initial fabric of the Stockton and Darlington could handle."
