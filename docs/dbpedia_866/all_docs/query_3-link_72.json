        "text": "$600 million in new yearly GDP for the state and $175 million in new state and local tax revenue projected each year.\n\nDevelopment around light-rail stations could generate $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion in additional new property tax revenue by 2057.\n\nThe light-rail project will also support thousands of existing jobs across the state: suppliers, designers and manufacturers of rail transportation technology.\n\nCurrently, 27 major North Carolina businesses are members of the American Public Transportation Association. These are major suppliers, designers and manufacturers of rail transportation technology across the state that could bid to provide materials for Durham and Orange countiesâ€™ light-rail transit project.\n\nThe corporations include IMPulse in Mount Olive, Heico in Hickory, Saft America in Valdese, Huesker in Shelby, Tec Tran in Burlington, Cummins Inc. in North Whitakers, Interlogix Global Security in Lincolnton, ABB in Huntersville and Cary, Dialight in Roxboro, Wilmore Electronics Company Inc. in Hillsborough, Wysong in Greensboro and AKG Thermal Systems Inc. in Mebane.\n\nAccording to the North Carolina Department of Transportation, more than 600 material vendors in North Carolina are involved in the transit manufacturing supply chain.\n\n70 percent of existing permanent affordable housing in Durham is within a mile of a proposed light-rail station.\n\nDurham County commissioners voted to include 277 affordable housing units when developing two county-owned lots near a planned light-rail stop.\n\nDurham has drafted an Affordable Housing Density Bonus targeting light-rail stations that could be approved and enacted in 2019.\n\nDurham has spent more than two years developing station-area land use plans to maximize affordable housing opportunities.\n\nPlans are being developed to promote additional affordable housing near stations and stops.\n\nMore than 50 percent of Durham residents are considered cost-burdened because they spend more than 40 percent of their incomes on housing and transportation costs (light-rail fare will be similar to bus fare)."
