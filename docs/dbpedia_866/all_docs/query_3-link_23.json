        "text": "Following new research by Friends of the Stockton and Darlington Railway and Historic England, the building has been upgraded to Grade II*, elevating it into the top 10% of England’s most important historic buildings.\n\nThe building was first thought to date to the mid-1830s. It has now been revealed that it was actually completed in 1827, which experts believe makes it the earliest-ever example of a railway station (although it was not officially referred to as one until the late 1830s).\n\nWhen the building was commissioned, the concept of the railway station had yet to be developed. Its original purpose was to function as a tavern to provide shelter and refreshment for workers and customers at the adjacent coal and goods depot.\n\nHowever, a newspaper report in September 1827 clearly shows that the building was fulfilling the main functions of what later came to be recognised as a railway station: a stopping point for trains, a building providing shelter for passengers, and a receiving point for unaccompanied parcels and goods being transported by rail. There is also evidence of someone using the site to commute to work."
