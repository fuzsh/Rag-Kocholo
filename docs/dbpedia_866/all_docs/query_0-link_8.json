        "text": "Let’s face it folks, each and every single one of us is scared of accidents. I, for one, haven’t experienced any major accident my entire life and I thank God for that. You might not be aware but the world experiences different accidents every single day and I am not talking about your everyday road accidents. I am talking about something on a much bigger scale, something that gives the word ‘weird’ a new definition. This article talks about the weirdest and the most bizarre accidents from around the world over the course of history. You do not expect these sort of things to happen every day or even once in a blue moon and that makes this article a very interesting one indeed.\n\n10. PHILADELPHIA BOILER EXPLOSION\n\nAn experimental ‘train engine’ blew up in Philadelphia, County Durham, England. The year was 1815 and it was a four-wheel engine. Sixteen people were killed and this is recorded as the first major railway accident. You will not find a detailed account of this accident easily. Poor victims were the sightseers who were gathered to see the locomotive in action. The explosion left countless more injured.\n\n9. BOUNCY CASTLE DISASTER\n\nYou are familiar with the concept I assume. Once, a bouncy castle filled with 30 people broke free and took off into the air. It is reported that the castle took off to an altitude of 50 feet, turned over travelled 150 feet and then fell to the ground. This resulted in injuring 13 people and killing two. This incident would have been so awesome if at all there were no deaths or injuries in fact, I very much would have loved to be a part of the entire incident. Air filled castles have been related with many incidents of the sorts but his one worthy of mentioning on this list.\n\n8. DEATH OF LADY CONVENTRY\n\nMaria Gunning, also known as Lady Coventry, was considered to be a beauty in her time. She spent a lot of her time applying white makeup and red rouge every day since that was the style of that day. Her husband however, did not like this and tried to stop her from using this make-up. Lady Coventry died at the age of 27 because she over used lead-based makeup. She would have probably been in a better place if she had listened to her husband.\n\n7. NAPOLEON’S COUGH\n\nIt is said the Napoleon was suffering from a bad cough when he accidentally ordered the execution of 1,200 prisoners. It said that he said ‘Ma sacre toux’, which meant ‘my damn cough’, but the soldiers mistook it to be ‘massacre-tous’; that means ‘massacre all’. If this whole incident was proven to be true I would have put it on the number one spot but unfortunately there are many different stories regarding this particular incident.\n\n6. LAKE PEIGNEUR ACCIDENT\n\nThis incident took place while drilling a salt mine beneath a ten-foot deep lake. The third level of the mine was accidentally pierced by the drill caused the lake to flow into the mine because of which the tiny hole started to expand. The inflow began to quicken and that resulted in a huge whirlpool which then sucked in the drilling platform, eleven barges and 65 acres of the surrounding terrain.\n\n5. GOIANIA ACCIDENT\n\nA radioactive contamination accident occurred in Goiania, Brazil on 13th September, 1987. This is considered to be one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. It took place after an old nuclear medicine source was scavenged at an abandoned hospital. The source was handled by so many people who it ended up contaminating 249 people and resulted in four deaths. This contamination spread like wildfire; 130,000 people filled the hospitals, houses and to be destroyed and several sites had to be abandoned.\n\n4. LONDON BEER FLOOD\n\nThis is something that doesn’t happen every day. A vat of beer at London’s Meux and Company Brewery cracked open on October 16th, 1814. That resulted in 550,000 gallons of beer being poured out into the streets of London. The wave that was caused by these accidents destroyed two homes and crushed the wall of Tavistock Arms Pub. This brewery was located among the poor settlements of London. Eight people lost their lives in this unusual flood. The incident was declared to be the ‘act of God’.\n\n3. THE BALL OF BURNING MEN\n\nKing Charles VI of France hosted a ball on January 28th, 1393. His idea was to disguise himself and five other friends as savages. The men decided to cover themselves with feathers and pitch. Note here that the pitch is highly inflammable. They entered the ball chained together when a man approached them with a torch to get a better look. They caught fire immediately. The King was saved but two of his friends were burnt alive at the very moment while the others were severely injured. Two amongst the injured lost their lives soon after.\n\n2. BOSTON MOLASSES DISASTER\n\nA tank full of molasses exploded in Boston’s North End on 15th January 1919. The explosion resulted in a shockwave that shook the foundation of the nearby houses. Metal shards were found 200 feet away from the explosion. The tank had 2.3 million gallons of molasses which is why a 25 to 30 feet wave of molasses was formed at the time of explosion.21 casualties occurred and another 150 were left injured because of this bizarre incident.\n\n1.
