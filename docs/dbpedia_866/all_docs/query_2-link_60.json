        "text": "These secluded walkways were used as the filming location for scenes of Harry, Ron and Hermione walking between lessons in Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. At the end of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the scene where Harry frees Dobby the House Elf was filmed on a set that is an almost identical replica of Durham Cathedral's Cloister.\n\nDid you know?\n\nFilch the Caretaker is often seen with a set of big old-fashioned keys as he prowls the school looking for mischief. While filming at Durham Cathedral, an actual set of Durham Cathedral's keys were used as props.\n\nThe Nave was used in Avengers: Endgame, in the scene where Thor travels back in time and visits his Asgard.\n\nYou can see the checked floor of the crossing from above, as Thor's mother and her ladies walk across it, and our famous columns feature as Thor hides behind them.\n\nThis is the name for the square of grass in the middle of the Cloister. It featured, generously dusted in fake snow, in a wintery scene in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when Harry released his pet owl Hedwig for a flight around Hogwarts Castle.\n\nIn Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the Cloister Garth was the setting for the famous scene when Ron's 'eat slugs' curse backfires.\n\nThe Galilee Chapel along the western side of the cathedral features as one of the rooms in the Asgard palace in Avengers: Endgame.\n\nThe view might look a little different in the film, as the crews laid a green screen across one of the walls, editing it to appear as a window overlooking Asgard.\n\nImage Credit: Marvel Studios\n\nThe Chapter House was used as the filming location for Professor Minerva McGonagall's classroom in the first two Harry Potter films. Dame Maggie Smith's character led Transfiguration lessons that saw the young students attempt to turn animals into goblets.\n\nThis location is currently open to the public, from 10am to 4pm, Monday to Saturday. Some dates are excluded due to being used for services and events."
