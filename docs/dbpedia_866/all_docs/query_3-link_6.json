        "text": "Shildon's location was strategically significant, sitting on the eastern edge of the south-west Durham coalfield.\n\nThis proximity made it ideal for connecting nearby collieries with Darlington and Stockton-on-Tees, speeding up the process of transporting coal locally as well as freighting it to the coast for onward transport.\n\nBeing in the thick of the coal industry also meant Shildon was close to a wealth of engineering knowledge and innovation.\n\nThe mining industry had been an important site of development in rail technology for several centuries, and so it made sense that early railway locomotives were developed in and around the industrious coalfields of the North of England.\n\nDarlington businessmen wanted a railway as opposed to the canals favoured by those in Stockton. The proposed canal route would bypass Darlington and Yarm, leading them to suffer financially by missing out on trade opportunities.\n\nDarlington banker Jonathan Backhouse and mill owner Edward Pease created a committee in opposition to the expensive proposed canal works. Also on the committee were builder Robert Botcherby from Darlington, the Recorder of Yarm Leonard Raisbeck, Quakers Benjamin Flounders and Richard Miles, and landowner and squire Thomas Meynell, all from Yarm.\n\nIt was George Stephenson, though, who convinced Pease that a railway—and not a tramway—should be built, claiming that steam engines could haul 50 times the load horses could manage.\n\nOne very important figure in the story of the railway hasn't made an appearance yet.\n\nBorn in Wylam in 1786, Timothy Hackworth was apprenticed at Wylam colliery, where he worked with William Hedley on Puffing Billy and later Wylam Dilly.\n\nHe also worked briefly for Robert Stephenson & Co., before becoming superintendent of the S&DR in 1825.\n\nHe was an important figure in Shildon from this point, managing the line and the engineering works. He worked with the Stephensons on Locomotion No. 1, the engine which ran on the S&DR's opening day, and in 1827 built Royal George.\n\nThis locomotive had a lot of innovations, such as the steam blast pipe, and was said to be one of the first locomotives to be more efficient than horses.\n\nOthers weren’t so keen on Royal George as it was still slow—but this was perfectly acceptable for the coal-hauling railway it was built for.\n\nHackworth also had international aspirations, building the first steam locomotive to run in Russia, which he exported in 1836. He also built locomotives for Canada, such as Samson, which is on display at Nova Scotia Museum of Industry.\n\nSo the railway was a new and somewhat controversial innovation—when it finally arrived, how did the town react?\n\nLocomotion No. 1 departed for Stockton from outside the Mason's Arms public house on Tuesday 27 September 1825.\n\nThe overriding theme in contemporary accounts is that of wonder and amazement. Shildon was the very first place in the world to witness a steam locomotive hauling a train of passengers on a public railway—a true spectacle.\n\nThe arrival of the railway catalysed significant changes for Shildon as a town and the local area as well as national industry.\n\nCoal prices fell, and the increased demand was initially more than the railway could manage.\n\nPassenger services started running in October 1825, run by private contractors using horse-drawn coaches such as the Union. Locomotives gradually replaced horses on the railway line, and from 1833 a steam-hauled passenger service was in operation.\n\nThe new industry led to a population boom in Shildon (from just 115 in 1821 to over 2,600 by 1841) as more and more people moved to the town for work.\n\nThe settlement expanded rapidly into New Shildon and the town became home to railway works, a Mechanics' Institute and other businesses and organisations associated with the railways.\n\nShildon would not be the same again.\n\nLondon & North Eastern Railway, 1925\n\nMarking the centenary of the S&DR's opening, this event included a procession of locomotives from the S&DR, NER, GWR, LNWR, LMS, SR, and even the Hetton Colliery locomotive (previously thought to have been built in 1822, this was actually a replica from 1851).\n\nLocomotion No. 1 hauled a train of chaldron wagons to replicate the opening day ceremony. It was powered by a petrol motor, with burning rags in the chimney to give the appearance of being in steam. Afterwards it was displayed in Darlington, where people allegedly took chips off the chimney as souvenirs."
