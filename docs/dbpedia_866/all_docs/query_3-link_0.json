        "text": "The Durham and Southern Railway operated 56.8 miles (91.4 km) of railroad from Dunn to Durham, North Carolina, USA. It was originally chartered as the Cape Fear and Northern Railway by Holly Springs resident George Benton Alford in 1892 and construction began in 1898.[1] The name was changed to Durham and Southern in 1906. In 1979 it became part of the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad a predecessor to the CSX system. The tracks between Apex and Erwin Junction were removed in 1981 and the Dunn to Erwin segment (via Erwin Junction) was sold to the Aberdeen and Rockfish Railroad who operated it as a separate entity, the Dunn-Erwin Railway, until merging it into their operations in 1990. The closure of the cotton and denim mill in Erwin in 2000 led to the abandonment of these tracks and the conversion of the right-of-way to a rail trail. The Durham to Apex segment remains in use by CSX.\n\nStations\n\n[edit]\n\nTimetable #20, dated September 20, 1959 listed the following stations:\n\nDurham at Mile Post 0 (The D&S shared Durham's Union Station with several other railroads)\n\n\"East Durham\" at Mile Post 2.3 (Interchanging with and crossing the Southern Railway)\n\n\"D.& S.C.
