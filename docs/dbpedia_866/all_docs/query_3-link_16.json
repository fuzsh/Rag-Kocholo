The purpose of the collaboration between the two railroads was to provide \"...Omaha railroad passengers, terminal facilities equal to those of any city of its size in the country.\"\n\n1931\n\nUnion Station was completed and opened as a passenger train station. The dedication ceremony was held on January 15, 1931.\n\nWhat is a Union Station?\n\n1985\n\nThe City of Omaha transfers the Byron Reed Collection from the Omaha Public Library to the Western Heritage Museum under the stipulation that it be cared for according to best practices and a portion of it always be available for public viewing."
