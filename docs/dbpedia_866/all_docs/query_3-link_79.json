        "text": "A four-week operation to assemble 46 rail vehicles in a County Durham museum has been completed.\n\nLocomotion, in Shildon, has moved the vehicles into its new £8 million New Hall building, in what it claims is the biggest indoor rail display in Europe. The vehicles include steam locomotives, hand-powered track inspection machines, freight wagons, snowploughs, and an armoured vehicle on tracks; with the move being part of the National Railway Museum's biggest ever shunt of vehicles.\n\nCombined with what was already there, the new installation brings Locomotion's total number of vehicles to 99. The site is built close to the site of Shildon Works, a railway workshop which once employed thousands of people before its closure in 1984.\n\nRead more: Train drivers to stage fresh strikes during May Bank Holiday week\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest local news from County Durham with our free newsletter\n\nSarah Price, head of the museum, described the new building as \"magnificent.\" She said: \"New Hall effectively doubles the size of Locomotion and gives us much needed covered display space to help conserve the collection, as well as giving visitors the chance to find out more about the railways and the North East’s railway heritage.\n\n\"I hope the significant regeneration at Locomotion can draw even more people to visit the museum and the region as part of the national Railway 200 celebrations and beyond.\"\n\n2024 is the 200th anniversary of the world's first passenger train, which was hauled by George Stephenson's Locomotion No. 1 along the Stockton and Darlington Railway.\n\nCoun Elizabeth Scott, cabinet member for economy and partnerships at Durham County Council, said: \"It’s really exciting knowing New Hall is getting closer to opening and to housing Europe’s biggest undercover display of historic rail vehicles. We were delighted to be able to provide funding for this project, which will let many more people know the significance of Shildon as the starting point of the world’s first steam locomotive-powered passenger journey, further raising Durham’s profile nationally and internationally as the Culture County.\n\n\"Locomotion is already one of County Durham and the North East’s biggest visitor attractions, putting smiles on faces and delivering significant economic benefits. We look forward to New Hall adding to the museum’s offer and to it being at the heart of celebrations of both 20 years of the museum and 200 years since the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway.\"\n\nNew Hall will open to the public on May 24."
