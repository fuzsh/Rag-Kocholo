        "text": "Union Station, ~1910. Note the original courthouse in the background\n\n(Courtesy Dave Piatt)\n\nWhen Durham mayor Bill Bell reacted to the DOT's decision to pull back from plans to locate the Amtrak station in the Walker Warehouse, he said, per the Herald-Sun, that Durham was likely to end up the only city in North Carolina \"that has a dumpy railroad station.\" If I were with the state, I would have retorted - \"and whose fault is that?\"\n\nNeck and neck with the Washington Duke Hotel for the most grievous single-structure architectural loss in Durham history is the demolition of Union Station, demolished by the City of Durham to make way for a road and a parking garage.\n\n(Courtesy Durham County Library)\n\nAs with stations around the country with the same (or similar) name, Union station arose out of the need to consolidate several smaller stations, belonging to individual railroad companies, into a single terminal. In Durham, I believe there were three - Seabord, Norfolk-Western, and Southern - scattered along the rail line from Dillard St. to Corcoran.\n\nLooking west from the tracks, south of the courthouse.\n\n(Courtesy The University of North Carolina)\n\nUnion Station was constructed in 1905 for $50,000 by the above-named railroad companies at the foot of Church St. It was an Italian Renaissance revival structure designed by Milburn and Heister, responsible for many of Durham's early buildings.\n\n(Courtesy NCSU Libraries' Digital Collections:Rare and Unique Materials)\n\n(Courtesy NCSU Libraries' Digital Collections:Rare and Unique Materials)\n\nRendering of the proposed station by Frank Milburn.\n\nIts most distinctive feature was a 65-foot tall tower.\n\n(Courtesy Duke Archives)\n\nAbove, looking east from the Hosiery Mills building, 1920s. Union Station is at the center and, immediately to its left, the courthouse (which people call the old courthouse, but given that we are about to build our fourth major courthouse, I'll call it the second.) The south-facing facades of East Main are at the extreme left (including the Malbourne Hotel) and the old JD Lyon tobacco company/city stables are immediately across the tracks (with a smidgen of the Venable Warehouse visible beyond it).\n\n(Courtesy The University of North Carolina)\n\nThose who feel that Durham mistakenly located its current jail at the main entry points to downtown should realize that this is a long tradition. As Steve Massengill notes in his book, \"Images of America: Durham\"\n\n\"As a youngster in Durham, the compiler recalls the prisoners' jeering taunts from the open windows of the jail on the top floor [of the courthouse]\"\n\nBelow, the station in 1924 with the train pulling out. The courthouse is to the right, and the warehouses along Peabody are visible just beyond the station. There was also a jail located in the small structure just behind the tower.\n\n(Courtesy Duke Archives)\n\nBut other than the greeting committee, it must have been a beautiful sight to step off the train, exit the station to the cobblestones of Church St. and Trinity Methodist Church as the terminating vista 3 blocks away.\n\nA view of the tower and the station, looking east, 1930.\n\n(Courtesy Durham County Library)\n\nBelow, looking west, a train pulling into Union Station, 1940, with the Durham Silk Hosiery Mill in the background.\n\n(Courtesy Durham County Library)\n\nBelow, the view of the front of the station from East Main St., looking down S. Church during a snowstorm in 1945.\n\n(Courtesy Herald-Sun)\n\nThe old engines were replaced by the 1950s with the less-embellished modern engines. Below, looking northeast from the tracks towards the station.\n\n(Courtesy Durham County Library)\n\nBelow, the view east, 1950s.\n\n(Courtesy Durham County Library)\n\nA blurry color shot from the mid-1950s\n\n(Courtesy Barry Norman)"
