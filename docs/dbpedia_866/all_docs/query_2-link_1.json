The weather was raining with dense fog. Three of the four crew members were killed. The fourth member survived, T-Sgt. Edward Matus, who walked to the airport, arriving at the Eastern Airlines office at 1:00 a.m. He followed the \"sounds of airplanes taking off.\" He was rushed to Duke Hospital. The crash was the first fatal airplane accident \"since the airport came under civilian operation in 1946.\" The plane was flying a \"routine training flight\" from Stewart Air Force Base, in Newburg, NY, to Donaldson Air Force Base, in Greenville, S.C, with a stop at Pope Air Force Base in Fayetteville. They attempted a landing a Pope, but \"visibility there was zero.\" They diverted to Raleigh-Durham, where visibility \"was about a one-quarter of a mile.\" Their last radio contact with Pope was at 10:41 p.m., when the crew reported \"icing at 9,000 feet.\" The plane crashed in a thickly-wooded area located 1,000 yards from the picnic area.\n\nMatus remembered being struck and falling to the floor in the plane, then waking up in the wreckage.

Joyce, co-pilot, both of Donaldson Air Force Base, and First Lt. Robert W. Shaw, of Pope Air Force Base. The area was subsequently secured, though \"crowds of curious persons\" had converged on the wreckage earlier, \"picking up souvenirs from the broken parts of the plane.\" Cars also jammed the gate at the park entrance, and caused traffic problems on the highway.

Piper is lead aircraft and Cessna is wingman. Cessna pilot later reports that during takeoff and initial climb, the lead aircraft begins to accelerate ahead of him. The Piper turns slightly right and levels at approximately 1500' as the Cessna tries to regain position and keep lead aircraft in sight. Wingman reports having difficult seeing lead aircraft with city lights in background. Wingman's aircraft begins \"building up momentum\" and he trims to level off at 1500'. After flight is cleared to contact departure control, wingman looks away to locate and change radio frequencies. While changing frequencies, he loses sight of the lead aircraft. Subsequently, the Cessna converges on the Piper, but the wingman doesn't see it until just before his prop and nose gear strike the vertical fin and fuselage of the piper. The Piper enters an uncontrolled descent and crashes. The Cessna's engine loses power, but the wingman makes a successful forced landing on Runway 32 with a failed nose gear. Read NTSB reports.

He was given 6, 000 feet and once he joined the localizer, he was given a further clearance to 3, 000 feet. In addition, he was asked to maintain 170 knots until the final approach fix.\n\nThe pilot was cleared for the ILS Runway 5R approach and was observed on radar at 2, 900 feet, at a speed of 150 knots at the final approach fix. The local tower controller issued the pilot clearance to land runway 5R and gave him the rollout runway visual range (RVR) of 4, 000 feet.\n\nRadar showed that after crossing the final approach fix the flight maintained an altitude of 2, 900 well above the glide path and a ground speed of about 118. During the entire approach until midway down the runway the flight never descended below 2, 000 feet. The controller asked the pilot if he was going around and he answered he was. ATC cleared the pilot to maintain 2, 000 feet, and fly runway heading, which the pilot read back correctly. Radar data showed the airplane turned right to a heading of about 123 degrees then descended to 1, 400 feet and within 5 seconds climbed to 1, 600 feet.
