        "text": "It’s hard to live in the Triangle area without hearing about the American Tobacco Trail (ATT), but it’s more fun using it. The trail is a 22-mile recreational greenway which travels through the City of Durham, south through Durham, Chatham, and Wake counties. The northern end is a 10-foot wide paved trail, while the southern end is made of stone dust rather than asphalt.\n\nAmerican Tobacco Trail Access\n\nThe trail is located on an abandoned corridor of the Norfolk Southern Railroad. The original railroad took tobacco from farming communities in Wake, Chatham, and Durham counties to the American Tobacco Company in Durham for processing. Over time, trucks replaced the trains, and the trains eventually discontinued the route. The tracks were removed in 1987.\n\nIn 1989, the Triangle Rails to Trails Conservancy was formed to promote the development of the former rail line into a recreational rail trail. The goal of the conservancy was to preserve the former railroad line area as a trail, open to the public for recreational use. It also preserves the land in case a modernized rail system is ever desired in the future. The trail was built in sections, with the final section, a bridge over I-40, completed in 2014. The trail was officially named the American Tobacco Trail to honor its heritage.\n\nDiscover Wildlife Along The American Tobacco Trail\n\nThe ATT is a great place to commune with nature. Some portions take you through beautiful pine forests. In the rural areas of the trail, you will be able to see a wide variety of wildlife including beavers, herons, turtles, squirrels, deer, hawks, vultures, and other birds.\n\nBike, Walk, Run, Skate, or Rollerblade Your Way Through Durham\n\nAre bikes allowed on the American Tobacco Trail? Absolutely! People use the trail to enjoy nature, to get exercise, or travel north or south without the hassles and noise of traffic. Walkers, joggers, runners, cyclists, skateboarders, and rollerbladers use the trail on a daily basis. People walking strollers and leashed dogs and people in wheelchairs also use the trail. Horseback riders also use the southern portion (Chatham and Wake counties) of the trail, but are not allowed on the northern portion. The trail has a speed limit of 10 miles per hour. Motorized vehicles, except for wheelchairs, are not allowed on the trail.\n\nGeocaching is an allowed activity on the ATT. Geocaches are located along the trail for use in this technology-based treasure hunting game. In this game, players use GPS devices, such as their smartphones, to locate these caches which are hidden.\n\nIs There Drinking Water Available Along The Trail?\n\nDrinking water is very limited on the ATT. Some portions have no drinking water at all. So, it’s best to take water with you. There are limited restroom facilities along the trail.\n\nHunting Along The American Tobacco Trail\n\nLicensed hunters may use the southern portion of the trail to access game lands managed by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission during hunting season, September through December. They are not allowed to carry loaded firearms on the trail nor fire their weapons on the trail. They also are not allowed to shoot across the trail once they are in the game lands. Hunting is not allowed on Sunday.\n\nWhile firearms are not allowed on the trail, according to regulations, people with a concealed handgun permit are allowed to legally carry a concealed gun on the trail.\n\nThe ATT is part of what will be a 75-mile greenway network through the Triangle region. And all of these trails will become part of the East Coast Greenway, a network of greenways that will extend from Maine to Florida.\n\nThe American Tobacco Trail is a great resource for those looking for some peace and quiet among nature. Check it out!\n\nThe American Tobbacco Trail is just one of the many great assets that make the Triangle area such a great place to live.
