        "text": "The construction of the line was a national team effort\n\nThe malleable iron rails which made up two-thirds of the railway line came from Bedlington in Northumberland. The cast iron rails that made up one-third of the line and the iron ‘chairs’ used along the whole line and which held the rails in place came from south Wales. The 64,000 stone sleeper blocks that the rails were fixed into came from Brusselton, Etherley and Haughton Bank Quarries[i] and were used along the west end of the line as far as Darlington (young boys were paid 8d a day to drill two holes in 24 blocks suitable for fixing the ‘chairs’ into.)[ii] Oak sleeper blocks were used at the east end and they came from Portsmouth in Hampshire and brought to Stockton by ship. Most of the unskilled labour to build the line including cuttings and embankments was obtained locally through private contract, but many Tyneside keelmen were brought down to the line to work after being made redundant after the great strike of 1822. Most of the contractors, special blasters and tunnel makers were recruited by Stephenson himself from the Northumberland coalfield. [iii]\n\nOne of the Quaker run banks bankrolling the railway was Backhouses bank. It was based on High Row in Darlington where Barclays bank is today – Barclays having merged with Backhouses and other Quaker banks in 1896. In 1819 it was possible to take a bank note to a bank and exchange it for its equivalent value in gold.\n\nIn an attempt to derail the railway, the Earl of Darlington ordered all of his tenants in Teesdale to secretly collect Backhouses’ banknotes so that they could all be presented on one day in exchange for gold. No bank would have enough gold in their vaults to meet this demand and it would result in closure, loss of confidence and bankruptcy for the bank which was funding the railway.\n\nIn late June 1819, Jonathan Backhouse, carried out a daring rescue plan on hearing of the Earl’s intentions. He headed south in his carriage pulled by four horses and visited other Quaker banks, borrowing as much bullion as possible. He dashed back northwards with a carriage laden with gold, travelling day and night to beat Darlington’s agent to the bank. At Croft bridge – just three miles from Darlington – one of the four wheels came crashing off his coach and it tipped forward.\n\nWith considerable urgency, he rearranged the gold so that it sat over the good rear wheels causing the broken axle to lift up off the ground.\n\nAccording to the imaginative Chris Lloyd: “And so, pulling a wheelie, he dashed the remaining miles into High Row – apparently welcomed into town by cheering people.”[i] He made it to the bank only shortly before the Earl’s agent arrived to exchange the notes for gold and so the Earl’s plan was thwarted, the bank survived, and the railway stayed on track.\n\nThe story may have grown in the telling. However, it is certainly true that the Earl opposed the railway because of the damage to his fox hunting; it is true that the Quaker banks and families supported each other to get the railway on track and in the archives of Barclays Bank, the books from 1819 survive with accounts of cash being taken to London and in the list of losses, the cost of a broken wheel at £2. 3s.\n\n[ii] Painting of Backhouses coach charging across Croft Bridge, created 60 years later by Backhouses employee and renowned Darlington artist, Samuel Tuke Richardson. The painting hung for decades in the Darlington branch and is now in Barclays’ archives (image: Barclays Group Archives)."
