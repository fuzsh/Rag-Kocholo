For those wishing a more in depth view I would recommend \"Overland in 1846\" by Dale Morgan. (2 vols)\n\nSources for those traveling the Southern Route:\n\nOregon Overland: Three Roads of Adversity by Ross Smith (dec Nov 2007); an indepth study of the 1846 Barlow Road and the 1846 Southern Route and the Smith family who traveled them\n\nNotes compiled by Don Ubben while researching the life and works of Jesse Quinn Thornton\n\nThe Southern Route by Ben Truwe\n\nCaptains of 1846\n\nSR: indicates those that took Southern Route (Applegate Trail) into Oregon\n\nCA: indicates those that cut off for California.

William Crosby: left Independence May 27 with 25 wagons. \"Mississippi Saints\" included 19 of the wagons and 43 persons who were Mormons hoping to hook up on the plains with another group of Mormons.

Their ship was blown to sea and it took them three months to sail from San Francisco to Portland. Upon arrival they stayed with Elizabeth's family near present day Mt. Angel. The Brown family then were able to purchase the Peter Depot land claim, adding to it their own Donation Land Claim in French Prairie. Their land encompassed over 1,000 acres in the Gervais area. For the first eight years they lived in a log cabin about 1 mile north of the present home site. They soon began their plans for the home that was later to be known as the Sam Brown house. Legend has it that this was the first house in Oregon to be built from an architect's plan. Co-incidentally, the architect was another Sam Brown, though no relative of the family. After completion, the house, in addition to being a residence, served as a stage coach station.
