        "text": "DURHAM, N.C. - With the 2024 ACE in Panama program complete, student-athletes who participated shared their final reflection blog posts on their summer experience.\n\nSpeaking Soccer\n\nMikaela Voinov, Duke Rowing\n\n\"I can confidently say that what I've learned in Gandoca has had a huge impact on how I now view sports in general, as well as my role as a college athlete. As I head into my sophomore year at Duke, I am going to work to balance my competitive drive with a newfound focus on just enjoying my sport and living more presently. By taking a more holistic approach to sports I hope to carry with me the lessons I learned in Gandoca!\" Read more.\n\nIf a Picture is Worth a Thousand Words, Why Not Write Two Thousand?\n\nAustin Simpson, Duke Men's Swimming & Diving\n\n\"I made a lifetime of memories over my two weeks in Costa Rica. I know that I will have trouble forgetting main events such as the soccer tournament, the hike to Manzanillo, or even the hatching of the baby turtles. Instead, I worry that the little things will fade from memory: the way the beach felt, the number of bugs, or even just the card games we played. Whether these little memories be joyous or slightly troublesome (like the number of times I lost to Alaina in Rummikub), it is important to me that I remember the feeling of being in Costa Rica, not just the events.\" Read more.\n\nCacao, Community & Change\n\nAlaina McVeigh, Duke Field Hockey\n\n\"Above all, this journey instilled in me a new perspective on life. The rigors of being a student-athlete at Duke are demanding, but witnessing a part of the world where people work daily on cacao or banana plantations reminds me of the insignificance of my worries at Duke. Though being an athlete is difficult, I know how lucky I am to be able to play my sport every day while also receiving an amazing education. I have a deep sense of gratitude for the privileges I enjoy, from attending Duke to having access to amenities like running water and air conditioning at all times. This experience reminded me that every aspect of my life is a blessing and to embrace all the opportunities before me.\" Read more.\n\nConnected\n\nAllison Neiders, Duke Women's Track & Field\n\n\"Looking back on this experience, I realize how important connecting with others is. If we did not foster the connections we did, the trip would have been completely different. Our connection to the community made our service work so much more valuable. We knew the kids attending the schools. We knew the farmers. We understood completely how we were making a difference in the small community. Connection is what drives action. When we feel connected to something we must take the opportunities that are presented and go for it. When you connect, you create a bond that makes everyone feel valued and part of a team.\" Read more.\n\nFor more information on the ACE Program, visit here.\n\nDuke Centennial\n\nIn 2024, Duke celebrates its Centennial, marking one hundred years since Trinity College became Duke University. Duke will use this historic milestone to deepen the understanding of its history, inspire pride and strengthen bonds and partnerships, and prepare for a second century of continued excellence and impactful leadership.
