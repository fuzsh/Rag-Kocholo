        "text": "MEBANE, NC (WBTV & AP) - Thirteen people were injured after an Amtrak-operated passenger train heading from Raleigh to Charlotte hit a tractor trailer and derailed in Alamance County Thursday morning.\n\nAuthorities say the train struck a trailer stuck on a crossing shortly after 8 a.m. at Fifth Street in downtown Mebane.\n\nThe accident involved Train 73, also known as the Piedmont, which travels daily between Raleigh and Charlotte. Amtrak operates the train but the state of North Carolina owns it.\n\nThe train was scheduled to arrive in Charlotte at 10:12 a.m.\n\nWitness Kent Cates told WRAL.com that a low-boy trailer used to carry construction equipment bottomed out as it crossed the train tracks.\n\n\"Diesel fuel from the train busted and started blazing up pretty good,\" Cates said. \"It didn't look like anybody (was) hurt badly. It sounded like a big boom, big explosion. You could see bolts and stuff coming off the train and onto people's cars.\"\n\nAfter the train struck the trailer, the locomotive and three of the passenger cars derailed. The locomotive and one of the passenger cars caught fire.\n\nThe Times-News of Burlington spoke with Bob Farrar of Mebane who was out walking and witnessed the train collision.\n\n\"I have never witnessed anything like that ever in my life,\" Farrar said. \"It was like seeing special effects from a movie happen right in front of you.\"\n\nAmtrak spokeswoman Tracy Connell said there were 36 passengers on board the train when the accident occurred.\n\nIn a statement released mid-morning, Amtrak said that twelve passengers and one crew member were injured. The patients were taken to Alamance Regional Medical Center in Burlington, Duke University Hospital in Durham or the University of North Carolina Hospital.\n\nConcerned family members were asked to call 1-800-USA-Rail to check on passengers who were on the train.\n\nThe uninjured passengers were taken to a nearby community center. From there, they were transported by bus to their destinations.\n\nWBTV's Sarah Batista spoke with one couple who was on the train when it derailed. They were placed onto a bus and arrived at the Amtrak station in Charlotte around 1:35 p.m.\n\nTama and Rob Eller say they were on their way to visit family in Chester County, SC. Right after the collision, the couple said they heard an explosion and saw fire.\n\n\"Pretty much I thought we were going to compact, crash, I didn't know what was going to happen,\" said Tama Eller.\n\nThey escaped through a window on the train.\n\n\"We pulled the rubber off the window and jerked the window out, firefighters were there instantly,\" said Tama.\n\nRob Eller suffered a few scrapes and bruises.\n\n\"It's one of those surreal moments, when your not sure what happened you knew something bad happened,\" said Rob.\n\nThe crossing at the intersection of 5th and East Center streets where the train derailment occurred has a gate with flashing lights that was working at the time of the accident, a spokeswoman for the N.C. Rail Division said.\n\nSix previous accidents have occurred at the crossing dating back to 1978, including a wreck in 2005 that killed a 78-year-old, according to records from the Federal Railroad Administration. No one was injured in the most recent accident, which occurred in February.\n\nCopyright 2010 WBTV. All rights reserved. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
