        "text": "Welcome to the Weardale Railway!\n\n​\n\nThe Weardale Railway is an 18 mile heritage line running from a connection with the main rail network at Bishop Auckland to Eastgate in Weardale, County Durham, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Currently a 16 mile section of line between Bishop Auckland and Stanhope has been restored for passenger and freight use.\n\n​\n\nThis website is provided by volunteers of the Weardale Railway Trust (the supporting charity) to promote the Trust and rail services in the dale.\n\nSeasonal passenger trains operate over the 16 mile section between Stanhope and Bishop Auckland. The services to Bishop Auckland West restarted in April 2023 for the first time since 2019 following extensive track maintenance work on the section of line between Wolsingham and Bishop Auckland. There was also a period of training and assessment for staff and volunteers so they can operate trains on the section to Bishop Auckland. In the past mainline excursion trains and rail tours have also visited the railway.\n\n​\n\nThere are intermediate stations at Frosterley, Wolsingham and Witton-le-Wear, with services also stopping at a new halt serving Kingfisher Leisure Park which opened in 2022. This was designed and constructed by volunteers of the Trust in partnership with Weardale Railway Limited, part of The Auckland Project, who own the line.\n\nThe seasonal heritage passenger services are operated by Weardale Railway Limited with support from volunteers of the Weardale Railway Trust. Plans for further special, excursion and dining train services are being developed by Weardale Railway Limited. These will also be operated with assistance from Trust volunteers.\n\n​\n\nThe seasonal passenger services are operated using 1960s and 1980s diesel multiple units which are maintained and provided by the Weardale Railway Trust. These allow for excellent views of the outstanding Dales scenery and the multiple river crossings. There are plans to reintroduce steam hauled services in the future using a locomotive owned by the Weardale Railway Trust, which is currently undergoing extensive restoration."
