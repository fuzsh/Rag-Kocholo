        "text": "Explore Shildon\n\nWander further into Shildon and you’ll discover connections with the town’s railway history.\n\nThe Daniel Adamson coach house is one of several notable buildings in Shildon, commonly believed to be the town’s first purpose-built passenger railway terminus. Later in life it became a venue for community activities.\n\nThere’s also St John’s Parish Church, originally built in 1834. Timothy Hackworth’s grave can be found on the main path in the churchyard.\n\nLook out for the statue of Hackworth in Hackworth Park, which was provided for the many railwaymen who moved into the town’s new terraces in 1912.\n\nExplore County Durham\n\nCounty Durham is a great place for a country walk, with guided walks organised by Durham County Council. Have a look at This Is Durham’s walking routes for more wonderful wanders.\n\nVenture further into the Vale of Durham and uncover our history and heritage at nearby Auckland Castle, or head to Beamish—The Living Museum of the North. Visit Durham City and marvel at the awe-inspiring Durham Cathedral, previously voted the UK’s Number One Landmark, and Durham Castle—which together form a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn the Durham Dales you can experience The Bowes Museum and Raby Castle, or simply enjoy the breathtaking scenery, which provides a retreat into peace and tranquillity—ideal for walking and cycling. Don’t miss the perfect photo opportunity at High Force, one of England’s most spectacular waterfalls."
