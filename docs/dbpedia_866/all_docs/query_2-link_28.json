        "text": "Photo Archive COLLECTION\n\nPhotography is a relatively new invention when compared to other forms of communication, like oral traditions and writing. It has changed drastically throughout its history; from the earliest daguerreotypes through tintypes, glass plate negatives, acetate film, nitrate film, color prints and today’s digital images.\n\nThe Durham Museum’s Photo Archive contains over 1 million images spanning from the 1860s to the early 2000s. They document the fascinating history of Omaha from its early days as a young frontier town to a unique and sophisticated city. A long forgotten storefront, Presidents on parade, row upon row of cattle in the stockyards, streetcars and a family picnic; each image preserves one moment in time, but also tells a hundred different stories!\n\nThe Durham Museum is dedicated to the long-term storage, preservation and documentation of these photographs. Since July 2010, efforts have been underway to digitize the entire Photo Archive. New images are added daily!"
