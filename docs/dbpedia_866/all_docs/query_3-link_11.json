        "text": "In May of 1887, three railroads consolidated to form the Lynchburg & Durham Railroad Company. These were the Lynchburg, Halifax & North Carolina R.R. company (of Virginia), the Durham & Roxboro R.R. Company (of North Carolina) and the Roxboro Railroad Company (of North Carolina). In September of that same year, construction began on a 115-mile railroad line between Lynchburg, Virginia and Durham, North Carolina. The line was completed to Durham in September of 1890.\n\nA September 23, 1891 L&D timetable offers an early schedule of the railroad which included both a daily northbound and a daily southbound train, as well as two local freight trains that each ran three times a week. It is interesting to observe based on a June 4, 1893 timetable that after only thirty-two months of operation (the last eighteen of which were while under lease by the N&W), thirteen of the original twenty-eight stops on the L&D had disappeared from the schedule altogether.\n\nThis web page presents the majority of Virginia stations built along the Lynchburg & Durham Railroad, beginning in Lynchburg and moving south along the line. Included are a few stations later built by the Norfolk & Western along the route. Descriptions of localities and stations along the line were derived from a January 8, 1891 article on the railroad published in The Daily Virginian. Additional information was obtained from a February 1930 article published in The Norfolk and Western Magazine. This latter article also included a map of the L&D line at the time of its construction.\n\nLynchburg 12th St. Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\n12th Street Station in Lynchburg was the original Northern terminus of the L&D line, and for a short while (until Rustburg Station was completed in April 1889), it was the only station on the line. By June of 1893, a connection had been created between 12th St. Station and the Norfolk & Western Railway’s Union Station, which became the new departure point for Lynchburg passengers on the L&D. This photograph of Lynchburg’s 12th Street Station was taken by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey, nineteen years following the acquisition of the L&D by the Norfolk and Western Railway Company. It is reproduced here from a digital scan of the original glass plate negative (#1101).\n\nLynchburg 12th St. Station (1958)\n\n(G. Howard Gregory photograph)\n\nThis photograph of Lynchburg’s 12th St. Station was taken a little more than a year before the station was closed and, shortly thereafter, demolished. Originally built by the Lynchburg & Durham Railroad, the station served passengers on N&W’s Durham District for most of its life.\n\nRustburg Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nThe Rustburg Station was built in April, 1889, at which time trains began to run as far as this station. At this time, the population of Rustburg, county seat of Campbell County, was around 500. This photograph of Rustburg Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1103).\n\nWinfall Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nOn May 4, 1889, an excursion took place from Lynchburg to Winfall, which at that time, was as far south as the L&D line had been completed. An article ran the following day in The Daily Virginian describing the excursion, and also described Winfall, stating “This hamlet consists of two stores, Driscoll & Waldron’s and W. F. Elliott & Son’s, post office, shop and several dwellings.” (Click here to read the complete article). In that it lacks the characteristic features of an original L&D station, the station depicted here is most likely a replacement station built by the N&W near the turn of the century. This photograph of the Norfolk & Western’s Winfall Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey. It is reproduced here from a digital scan of the original glass plate negative (#1104).\n\nWinfall Station (1983)\n\n(Rick Johnson photograph)\n\nGladys Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nA new settlement at the time of the L&D’s construction, Gladys was previously known as both “Pigeon Run” and “Woodland.” The community, which boasted several large lumber mills, was renamed “Gladys” in honor of one of the daughters of the founder of the L&D. This photograph of Gladys Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey. This photograph is reproduced here from a digital scan of the original glass plate negative (#1105).\n\nNaruna Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nNaruna was another small community with several saw mills in the late 1800’s. This photograph of Naruna Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1107).\n\nNaruna Station (May 1975)\n\n(Charlie Long photograph)\n\nBrookneal Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nBrookneal, an emerging tobacco market in the late 1800’s, is located on the Staunton River, and at the time of the L&D construction, had around 300 inhabitants. The first passenger train to Brookneal ran on August 12, 1889. This photograph of Brookneal Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1108).\n\nBrookneal Station (May 1975)\n\n(Charlie Long photograph)\n\nClarkton Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nClarkton offered a connection by steam boat with farms along the Staunton River. This photograph of Clarkton Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1109).\n\nClarkton Station (1989)\n\n(Wendall Russell photograph)\n\nNathalie Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nFormerly “Catawba,” this shipping point for hickory lumber was renamed “Nathalie” in honor of one of the daughters of the founder of the L&D. This photograph of Nathalie Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1110).\n\nNathalie Station (1989)\n\n(Wendall Russell photograph)\n\nLennig Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nLennig was named after Charles Lennig, president of Penn Construction Company from Philadelphia, the company contracted to construct the Lynchburg & Durham line. Lennig Station was among several L&D stations which the railroad had eliminated as scheduled stops by June, 1893. This photograph of Lennig Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1111).\n\nLennig Station (1989)\n\n(Wendall Russell photograph)\n\nLennig Station (1983)\n\n(Rick Johnson photograph)\n\nCrystal Hill Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nCrystal Hill was another shipping point for hickory lumber. This station was among several L&D stations which the railroad had eliminated as scheduled stops by June, 1893. This photograph of Crystal Hill Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1112).\n\nHouston Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nNow known as Halifax, Houston was named after W.C. Houston, vice-president of the Penn Construction Company. The town was the seat of Halifax County, and was previously called Halifax Court House. Houston featured saw mills, a furniture factory and tobacco warehouses. This photograph of Houston Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1113).\n\nSouth Boston Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nSouth Boston was a town of 2500 inhabitants in the late 1800’s, and was home to a fast-growing tobacco industry. In South Boston, the Lynchburg and Durham Railroad crossed the Richmond and Danville. This photograph of Norfolk & Western’s South Boston Station was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1115). This brick station does not date to the construction of the L&D railroad, but it may stand on the same site as the original L&D wooden station.\n\nSouth Boston Freight Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nThis photograph of Norfolk & Western’s South Boston Freight Station was made by the Norfolk & Western during the 1917 Valuation Survey. It is reproduced here from a digital scan of the original glass plate negative (#1116).\n\nSouth Boston Station (1989)\n\n(Wendall Russell photograph)\n\nCluster Springs Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nCluster Springs was known as “Black Walnut” in the days of L&D operation, and the station depicted here is not an original L&D station, but instead one built by the N&W near the turn of the century. By June 1893, the L&D had eliminated the “Blackwalnut” stop from its schedule. This photograph of the Norfolk & Western’s Cluster Springs Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1117).\n\nCluster Springs Station (1989)\n\n(Wendall Russell photograph)\n\nDenniston Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nThe L&D crossed the Atlantic and Danville Railroad at Denniston Junction. This photograph of Denniston Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1118).\n\nDenniston Coaling Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy Norfolk & Western Historical Society)\n\nThis photograph of the Denniston Coaling Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1119).\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWoodsdale Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy Norfolk & Western Historical Society)\n\nThis photograph of Woodsdale Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey (negative #1120).\n\nWoodsdale Station (1976)\n\n(Charlie Long photograph)\n\nThe Woodsdale, North Carolina station was one of several removed from service in the first three years of L&D operation.\n\nWoodsdale Station (1989)\n\n(Wendall Russell photograph)\n\nBy 1989, the Woodsdale station had been relocated to a commercial complex in Roxboro, NC, and fully restored.\n\nRoxboro Station (1917)\n\n(photograph courtesy N&W Historical Photograph Collection, Special Collections, Virginia Tech)\n\nThis photograph of Roxboro Station on the Lynchburg & Durham line was made by the Norfolk & Western Railway during the 1917 Valuation Survey. It is reproduced here from a digital scan of the original glass plate negative (#1122)\n\nRoxboro Station Portion (1989)\n\n(Wendall Russell photograph – research Wayland Moore)\n\nThis structure south of a now-demolished brick station in Roxboro, North Carolina, is believed to be the freight section of the original Roxboro L&D station."
