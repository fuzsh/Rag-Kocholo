“This is our chance to face our history head on, the good and the bad, and to uplift and celebrate through story-telling and the arts those heroes in our past who we need to honor and memorialize. It’s going to be awesome.” -Mayor Steve Schewel, State of the City Address

To celebrate Durham’s 150th anniversary is to rightfully honor the changemakers who shaped Durham’s unique sense of place. Durham has been the site of pivotal events long before the Bull City was put on a map and named for Dr. Bartlett Durham in the 1800s. It hasn’t been a place that’s slowed down since.

Before Europeans arrived in the 1700s, two Native American tribes –the Eno and the Occaneechi, related to the Sioux –lived and farmed here. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Durham has continued to evolve, progress, and thrive. The following timeline highlights a few of the people, places, and events that have helped make Durham the place it is today. You can always learn more about Durham’s roots by visiting the Museum of Durham History.
