        "text": "Paul Sorum\n\nI am a semi-retired Professor of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at Albany Medical College, Albany NY, now residing in Jamaica Plain. I am a primary care physician for children and adults and teach evidence-based medicine and critical evaluation of the medical literature to our medical student and residents. My major area of research and publication is health-related judgment and decision-making, mostly in collaboration with health psychologists in France and Canada. I co-founded and coordinated the multi-disciplinary Capital District Medical Decision Making Interest Group, later the Health Care Value Forum; started the Capital District chapter of Physicians for a National Health Program; and served as President of the Hudson Valley district of the NY American College of Physicians. I have written on health care in France; have taught evidence-based medicine to students in Burkina Faso; and continue to participate in the medical advisory boards of the Engeye rural clinic in Uganda (at which I have worked three times, most recently in February 2020) and of Noora Health in India."
