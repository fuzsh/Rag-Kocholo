        "text": "The Peter H. Sorum Papers consist of materials relating to the work done by Sorum and other members of the White House Advance Office (part of the Scheduling and Advance Office) in preparation for out-of-town trips taken or events attended by members of the First Family.The collection focuses primarily on events attended by Mrs. Ford and the Ford children but there are materials relating to President Ford's trips as well.The collection also contains materials related to a \"homestate reception\" at the Capital Hill Club for Vice President Ford following his swearing-in on December 6, 1973.The reception was given by the Michigan Congressional Delegation in conjunction with the University of Michigan Club and the Michigan State Society.\n\nThe Advance Office was responsible for the organization and implementation of the President and First Lady's visits outside of the White House complex.Members of this office designed and structured activities at each location the First Family visited. In most cases, they served as the primary contact and coordinator between the White House Military Office, the United States Secret Service, and the local communities to be visited.They were also in charge of conducting follow-up activities.\n\nThis file documents over 200 trips taken and events attended by members of the First Family. The events include the Republican National Convention, fundraising dinners and luncheons, awards ceremonies, funerals, festivals, conferences, concerts and artistic performances, art exhibits, and receptions for visiting dignitaries to name just a few. Documentation on an overseas trip to Germany, Poland, Finland, Romania, and Yugoslavia (which also includes information on Japan, Mexico, and Martinique) (Boxes 5 and 6), a trip to Alaska, China, Indonesia, Philippines, and Hawaii (Box 13), and a domestic trip to Vail, Colorado for Christmas (Box 14), are particularly complete since official briefing books are available for those trips.These briefing books have been maintained in the original order in which they were received.There are a number of routine action memoranda and event schedules in addition to the more interesting event programs.\n\nAlso included in this collection are handwritten notes by Mr. Sorum regarding event preparations, numerous letters and memoranda commending Mr. Sorum on the exemplary job he did.\n\nRelated Materials (August 2004)\n\nRelated materials may be found in the files of the First Lady's Staff particularly those of Susan Porter, Mrs. Ford's Appointments Secretary, and Sheila Weidenfeld, Press Secretary to the First Lady.The Porter files include materials relating to the scheduling of activities and domestic trips for Mrs. Ford and the Ford children. The Weidenfeld files contain materials concerning daily events, trips, plans for head of state visits, Mrs. Ford's campaign involvement and activities and background on the Ford children.\n\nThe Betty Ford Papers, White House Central Files Subject File category for the First Family (PP 5) for Mrs. Ford and the Ford children (PP 5), and the White House Social Office Central File category for the First Lady-Personal (FL) include material relating to their participation in events outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nMaterial related to travel by the First Family can be found in numerous collections throughout the Ford Library. A reconstruction of the President's daily activities can be found in the President's Daily Diary."
