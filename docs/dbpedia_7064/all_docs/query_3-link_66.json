        "text": "The Norwegian team dominated the event in the Swiss resort, with Sørum powering to victory in 34min 37.5sec.\n\nSørum missed two shots, one coming at the first standing position and the other coming at the last, but he still triumphed by 28.1\n\nErlend Bjøntegaard came second in 35:05.06 before Endre Stroemsheim finished in 35:41.2 to complete a Norwegian podium sweep.\n\n\"I would rate my performance much better than yesterday as my shooting was more accurate,\" said Sørum.\n\n\"I built enough lead and celebrated a big chunk of the last lap with the Norwegian flag in my hands, cheered by the fans.\n\n\"It doesn’t get much better than that.\"\n\nGerman teenager Selina Grotian was crowned women's 10km pursuit champion in Lenzerheide.\n\nThe 18-year-old biathlete produced a near-perfect performance from the shooting range, missing just one target to secure victory in 30:25.6.\n\nSwedish pair Tilda Johansson and Stina Nilsson had got off to a strong start with clean rounds only to provide an opening for Grotian to exploit.\n\nJohansson picked up two penalties as she came second in 30:43.12, while Nilsson slipped out of medal contention.\n\nFrance's Gilonne Guigonnat, who incurred one penalty, completed the top three, finishing 23.6 behind Grotian.\n\nIt was Grotian’s second medal in Lenzerheide after claiming women’s 15km individual bronze.\n\n\"I am more than happy,\" said Grotian.\n\n\"Stina and Tilda opened the competition very strongly.\n\n\"I had some problems with the standing shooting the last few days here, and I was surprised that I cleared the last five targets.\n\n\"I know I am strong in the final laps, but I still felt I needed to give it all to withhold Johansson.\""
