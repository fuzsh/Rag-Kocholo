        "text": "Back on the Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour after a three-month absence, Olympic champions Anders Mol and Christian SÃ¸rum are among the four menâs teams that advanced to the quarterfinals of this weekâs Ostrava Elite16 event.\n\nThe Czech sand is undoubtedly familiar territory for the Norwegians, who won three of the five international tournaments held in the city to date, including in the last two years.\n\nThe Olympic champions took third at the season-opening Doha Elite16, in March, and then missed the last three months of Beach Pro Tour action due to a broken bone on Mol's left foot, which required him to undergo surgery back in March.\n\nAfter ending the first day of pool play in the Ostrava Elite16 with a win and a loss, the Norwegians got a forfeit victory over French Youssef Krou and Arnaud Gauthier-Rat on Friday and finished first in Pool C, advancing directly to the quarterfinals.\n\nTheir opponents in the quarterfinals of the Ostrava Elite16, which will be held on Saturday, will come from the Round of 12 duel involving Czechs Jakub Sepka and Jiri Sedlak and Dutch Matthew Immers and Steve van de Velde.\n\nBesides the Norwegians, also topped their pools in Ostrava Italyâs Paolo Nicolai/Samuele Cottafava, Swedenâs David Ã hman/Jonatan Hellvig and the Netherlandsâ Stefan Boermans/Yorick de Groot.\n\nThe other three Round of 12 duels will have Qatarâs Cherif Younousse/Ahmed Tijan vs. USAâs Andy Benesh/Miles Partain, Brazilâs Evandro GonÃ§alves/Arthur Lanci vs. Lukas Pfretzschner/Sven Winter and Germanyâs Nils Ehlers/Clemens Wickler vs. Czechiaâs Ondrej Perusic/David Schweiner.\n\nOstrava Elite16 â Match Schedule and Results\n\nThe Round of 12 will start at 9:00 local time (7:00 GMT) on Saturday, with the first quarterfinals scheduled for 14:00 local time (12:00 GMT). The semifinals and medal matches will take place on Sunday.\n\nThe two advanced directly to the quarterfinals in Ostrava, just like the other three pool winners â Latviaâs Tina Graudina/Anastasija Samoilova, Switzerlandâs Tanja HÃ¼berli/Nina Brunner and Germanyâs Svenja MÃ¼ller/Cinja Tillmann.\n\nThese four teams will need to wait for the conclusion of the four Round of 12 matches â Germanyâs Laura Ludwig/Louisa Lippman vs. Italyâs Marta Menegatti/Valentina Gottardi, Brazilâs BÃ¡rbara Seixas/Carol Salgado vs. Schoon/Stam, Brazilâs Eduarda âDudaâ Lisboa/Ana PatrÃ­cia Ramos vs. Czechiaâs Barbora HermannovÃ¡/Marie-SÃ¡ra Å tochlovÃ¡ and USAâs Kelly Cheng/Sara Hughes vs. USAâs Julia Scoles/Betsi Flint -, involving teams that were second and third in their pools, to know their next opponents.\n\nZoÃ© and EsmÃ©e take the last Olympic spot\n\nEven though they didnât get on the court on Friday in Ostrava after being eliminated in Wednesdayâs qualifier, Swiss ZoÃ© VergÃ©-DÃ©prÃ© and EsmÃ©e BÃ¶bner had great reason to celebrate as they secured the last spot at the Paris 2024 Games available via the FIVB Olympic Rankings.\n\nTheir tickets to the French capital were booked when compatriots MÃ¤der and VergÃ©-DÃ©prÃ© lost to Canadians Melissa and Brandie, were eliminated from the tournament and saw their chances of surpassing ZoÃ© and EsmÃ©e be extinguished â they needed to make it to the semifinals to qualify.\n\nNow, only five spots per gender at the Paris Olympics continue to be available, all of which will be assigned over the next two weeks, during the continental qualifiers. Teams that already qualified two teams of the same gender, like Switzerland, cannot participate.\n\nQuick links:\n\nVolleyball World Beach Pro TourVBTVFacebookTwitterInstagramYouTube\n\nSubscribe to Volleyball World's Newsletter"
