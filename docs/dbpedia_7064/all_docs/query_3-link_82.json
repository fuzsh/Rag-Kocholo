The highest daily average low temperature is 53Â°F on July 20.\n\nFor reference, on July 17, the hottest day of the year, temperatures in SÃ¸rumsand typically range from 53Â°F to 69Â°F, while on February 7, the coldest day of the year, they range from 17Â°F to 29Â°F.\n\nThe figure below shows you a compact characterization of the hourly average temperatures for the quarter of the year centered on July. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day.\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in July in SÃ¸rumsand\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in July in SÃ¸rumsandJul112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMJunAugNowNowcoldcoolcoolcomfortablecoldcold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nHaines, Alaska, United States (4,010 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to SÃ¸rumsand (view comparison).\n\n© OpenStreetMap contributors\n\nCompare SÃ¸rumsand to another city:\n\nClouds\n\nThe month of July in SÃ¸rumsand experiences essentially constant cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy remaining about 49% throughout the month. The lowest chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 48% on July 17.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is July 17, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 52% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on January 28, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 74%, while on July 17, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 52%.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In SÃ¸rumsand, the chance of a wet day over the course of July is essentially constant, remaining around 35% throughout.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 38% on August 12, and its lowest chance is 24% on March 25.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during July in SÃ¸rumsand is essentially constant, remaining about 3.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 5.8 inches or falling below 1.1 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of July in SÃ¸rumsand, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 49 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 3 minutes, 39 seconds, and weekly decrease of 25 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is July 31, with 16 hours, 52 minutes of daylight and the longest day is July 1, with 18 hours, 42 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in SÃ¸rumsand is 3:57 AM on July 1 and the latest sunrise is 57 minutes later at 4:54 AM on July 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 10:39 PM on July 1 and the earliest sunset is 53 minutes earlier at 9:46 PM on July 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in SÃ¸rumsand during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during July, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 3:50 AM and sets 18 hours, 52 minutes later, at 10:42 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 9:17 AM and sets 5 hours, 52 minutes later, at 3:09 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in July in SÃ¸rumsand\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in July in SÃ¸rumsandJul112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMJunAug00101020202030304040505000010102020303030404050NowNow\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for July 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in July in SÃ¸rumsand\n\nJul 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 24%12:54 AMENE5:56 PMNW-9:12 AMS231,852 mi 2 15%12:55 AMNE7:45 PMNW-10:04 AMS233,251 mi 3 8%1:00 AMNNE9:32 PMNNW-10:59 AMS234,973 mi 4 3%1:13 AMNNE10:58 PMNNW-11:56 AMS237,007 mi 5 0%1:51 AMNNE11:40 PMNNW-12:53 PMS239,304 mi 6 0%3:10 AMNNE11:55 PMNNW-1:49 PMS241,767 mi 7 3%4:49 AMNNE--2:40 PMS244,258 mi 8 7%-12:01 AMNW6:28 AMNE3:28 PMS246,610 mi 9 13%-12:02 AMNW8:02 AMENE4:11 PMS248,642 mi 10 20%-12:02 AMWNW9:30 AMENE4:52 PMS250,181 mi 11 29%-12:01 AMWNW10:53 AME5:31 PMS251,078 mi 12 38%-12:00 AMW12:14 PME11:59 PMW6:10 PMS251,218 mi 13 48%1:36 PMESE11:57 PMWSW-6:49 PMS250,540 mi 14 50%3:00 PMESE11:57 PMWSW-7:30 PMS249,044 mi 15 67%4:30 PMSE11:57 PMSW-8:14 PMS246,794 mi 16 77%6:05 PMSE11:59 PMSW-9:02 PMS243,924 mi 17 85%7:46 PMSSE--9:56 PMS240,636 mi 18 92%-12:07 AMSSW9:23 PMSSE10:56 PMS237,185 mi 19 97%-12:29 AMSSW10:28 PMSSE11:59 PMS233,862 mi 20 99%-1:29 AMSSW10:54 PMSSE-- 21 100%-3:11 AMSSW11:03 PMSE1:02 AMS230,960 mi 22 100%-5:05 AMSW11:06 PMSE2:04 AMS228,722 mi 23 96%-6:59 AMSW11:06 PMESE3:01 AMS227,304 mi 24 91%-8:47 AMWSW11:06 PMESE3:55 AMS226,756 mi 25 82%-10:30 AMW11:05 PME4:45 AMS227,026 mi 26 72%-12:12 PMW11:05 PMENE5:33 AMS227,991 mi 27 61%-1:54 PMWNW11:04 PMENE6:21 AMS229,489 mi 28 50%-3:38 PMNW11:05 PMNE7:09 AMS231,353 mi 29 37%-5:27 PMNW11:08 PMNE8:00 AMS233,441 mi 30 27%-7:15 PMNNW11:17 PMNNE8:54 AMS235,647 mi 31 17%-8:49 PMNNW11:44 PMNNE9:50 AMS237,900 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in SÃ¸rumsand is essentially constant during July, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 20, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in SÃ¸rumsand is essentially constant during July, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 4.3 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on January 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.0 miles per hour, while on August 2, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 4.2 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in SÃ¸rumsand throughout July is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 50% on July 22.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nSÃ¸rumsand is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in SÃ¸rumsand is increasing during July, rising by 4Â°F, from 57Â°F to 61Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in SÃ¸rumsand typically lasts for 4.7 months (144 days), from around May 4 to around September 25, rarely starting before April 15 or after May 22, and rarely ending before September 5 or after October 19.\n\nThe month of July in SÃ¸rumsand is reliably fully within the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in SÃ¸rumsand\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in July in SÃ¸rumsandgrowing seasongrowing seasongrowing seasonJul11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%JunAug100%Jul 16100%Jul 16NowNowcoldcoolcomfortablevery coldwarm\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in SÃ¸rumsand are increasing during July, increasing by 335Â°F, from 398Â°F to 733Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in SÃ¸rumsand is gradually decreasing during July, falling by 0.7 kWh, from 5.9 kWh to 5.2 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of SÃ¸rumsand are 59.986 deg latitude, 11.242 deg longitude, and 417 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of SÃ¸rumsand contains significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 669 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 505 feet. Within 10 miles contains significant variations in elevation (1,024 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (2,976 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of SÃ¸rumsand is covered by cropland (53%), trees (28%), and water (12%), within 10 miles by trees (48%) and cropland (39%), and within 50 miles by trees (69%) and cropland (16%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in SÃ¸rumsand, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in SÃ¸rumsand.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and SÃ¸rumsand according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at SÃ¸rumsand is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between SÃ¸rumsand and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nOslo Airport, Gardermoen (ENGM, 72%, 15 mi, north, 262 ft elevation change)\n\nRygge (ENRY, 15%, 45 mi, south, -243 ft elevation change)\n\nArvika (ESKV, 12%, 52 mi, southeast, -171 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of SÃ¸rumsand and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
