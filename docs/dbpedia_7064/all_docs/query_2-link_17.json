        "text": "Despite the grey skies and rain at the capital, it was all sunshine and celebration for Team Norway's Ander Mol and Christian Sorum after beating ROC's Viacheslav Krasilnikov and Oleg Stoyanovskiy in a thrilling men's beach volleyball gold medal match at Shiozake Park.\n\nWhilst ROC had a slight lead in the opening set, Mol's kill blocks and Sorum's aces helped Team Norway overtake ROC and control the game to win the first set by 21-17.\n\nIn the second set, it was a tight showdown between the two teams but errors from ROC cost them some points with Team Norway going in for the kill to sail on to golden victory at 21-18 and clinch Norway's first-ever Olympic medal in beach volleyball.\n\n“We know this team very well, and we want to serve Krasilnikov because we have been playing well against him before. They served strong in the beginning, they always do. But we knew that if we found a rhythm with our side out we would get some points in the block,\" Sorum said.\n\n“It was just an amazing feeling to play at this high level in the Olympic final.”\n\nMol, whose mother competed in Atlanta 1996 in beach volleyball, couldn't quite believe that he not only made history for Norway but also surpassed his mother's sporting achievements.\n\n\"I always dreamed of beating my mum in the Olympics. She got a ninth (place). I was actually really happy when we made it to the quarterfinals because we became historical by achieving (at least) a fifth place,\" Mol said.\n\n“It has been a journey for a long time and our parents and families are very proud of us right now.”\n\nMol and Sorum's medal is also the third Olympic gold medal won by Norway at Tokyo 2020, following Karsten Warholm's gold in the men's 400 hurdles and Kristian Blummenfelt's gold at the men's individual triathlon.\n\nBronze medal for Qatar\n\nQatar's Cherif Younousse kissed the sand beneath his feet after winning the men's beach volleyball bronze medal match against Latvia along with teammate Ahmed Tijan.\n\nThe duo outplayed Latvia's Martin Plavins and Edgar Tocs in two straight sets to win a spot in the podium.\n\nEventhough the two teams started on an equal footing in the early round, Younousse's spectacular kill blocks helped Qatar break away with a huge lead to finish off their opponent 21-12 in the first set.\n\nLatvia staged a comeback in the second set leading by 3-0, but Qatar would come right back pouncing with serves and blocks to even the score. With Plavins and Tocs not being able to find their rhythm to catch up against the more relentless Qatar team, they ultimately fell at 21-18 with Qatar clinching bronze.\n\nThis is the first ever Olympic beach volleyball medal for Qatar."
