        "text": "Carleton Parents Fund\n\nAn important part of the Parents Advisory Council’s mission is to support the Carleton Parents Fund and further the strategic initiatives of the Carleton Community.\n\nThe Carleton Parents Fund is a way for parents to support the exceptional Carleton experience for all students. Tuition and fees don’t cover the entire cost of attending Carleton, and gifts from parents, alumni and friends help close the gap.\n\nMake a Gift\n\nPromoting Diversity\n\nCarleton believes that diverse student perspectives lead to a better community. Part of the Carleton Parents Fund goes toward providing financial aid to talented students who come from socioeconomically diverse backgrounds.\n\nLearning and Teaching\n\nCarleton is committed to student academic success. That’s why a portion of the Carleton Parents Fund goes toward keeping class sizes small so that faculty can maintain supportive relationships with students. Funds also support an array of study abroad opportunities and current academic materials.\n\nStudent Life\n\nCarleton students have access to a rich array of experiences outside the classroom, too. The Carleton Parents Fund supports internships, externships, student organizations, civic engagement, performing arts and more.\n\nCarleton Athletic Initiative"
