        "text": "Have you ever benne walking with an alpaca? Now you can!\n\nAlexandra Martinsen and Bjørn Brændshøi, two passionate alpaca breeders with more than 10 years experience. We breed alpacas for their luxurious wool and also for their mild, gentle presence which makes them perfect for human interaction. Alexandra is a teacher and she uses the alpacas in her work with children with extra needs. Bjørn is an engineer and focuses on breeding techniques and farm management. Our goal is to let people experience the wonderful alpaca up close and personal and we love seing sparkles in our visitors eyes when they do!\n\nWhat we’ll do\n\nYou will be met by your host who will take you into the alpaca shed and into their field and let you meet the alpacas up close and personal. You will be taught what alpacas are, their origin, their history and of course why we have alpacas today and what we use them for.

You will be taught what alpacas are, their origin, their history and of course why we have alpacas today and what we use them for. You will then help out by putting halter and leads on the alpacas, before each and one is given the responsibility for one of the alpacas for the rest of the activity, which takes approximately two hours in total. You will be able to pet the alpacas, take selfies and otherwise get a true and close connection with these very special creatures. We will then walk the alpacas on a scenic nature path in typical Norwegian landscape; fields, woods and hills - please wear clothes and footwear accordingly! We can adapt to visitor special needs. During the whole walk, your host will tell and talk about the alpacas adapted to your liking. We can arrange a typical Norwegian outdoor lunch on our camp site in the woods, using bondfire (if season). Contact us to plan such an outdoor lunch session accompanied by the alpacas! Contact us if your preferred date is not available when booking. Please note that we need to take the weather into account as this is an outdoor activity. If it is raining, it will not be fun for anyone (including the alpacas!).\n\nWhat else you should know\n\nRemember that the alpaca walk will be outdoors, in the nature. You will need to dress accordingly. Wear warm clothes if cold, especially gloves (you will be leading the alpaca) and hiking boots.\n\nWhat to bring\n\nWarm clothes (including gloves!) - if cold\n\nHiking boots or similar - if wet/snow\n\nWater bottle - if hot\n\nWelcome to us and our alpacas!\n\nMember of Visit Greater Oslo"
