One week after becoming the youngest team to win a Beach Major Series event the Norwegians were crowned as the champions of the 2018 European Championship, in the Hague, the Netherlands, also being the youngest duo to accomplish that.\n\nMol, 21, and S√∏rum, 22, topped the podium of the 26th edition of the continental tournament after a straight-set (21-17, 21-13) victory over Latvians Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Janis Smedins, the European champions of 2015, in the gold medal match.\n\nIf in Gstaad the young players took their country back to the highest spot in the podium in the World Tour for the first time after 20 years, their triumph in Gstaad has made the Norwegian national anthem be played in the European Championships for the first time since 1997, when Vegard Hoidalen and Jorre Andre Kjemperud won in Riccione, Italy.\n\n‚ÄúFor me this is unreal right now,‚Äù Mol commented. ‚ÄúWe will have a couple of days back home, relax and think about what we have done here this week and in Gstaad too. I think we need time to process it, because we cannot really understand it right now. Despite this success, we want to improve. We still have not reached our full potential. I think we can still play better and that is what we are aiming for.‚Äù\n\nü•áYour New Kings of Europe!

Norway has now three titles as Jan Kvalheim and Bj√∂rn Maaseide also prevailed in the second edition, in 1994.\n\nSpanish veterans Adri√°n Gavira and Pablo Herrera, the silver medalists in Gstaad last week, finished third after a three-set (21-17, 13-21, 15-12) triumph over Russians Konstantin Semenov and Ilya Leshukov in the bronze medal match.\n\nThe four semifinalist tandems are all guaranteed in the main draw of the A1 Major Vienna and are set to compete in the Danube Island from August 1-5.\n\nThe three medalists of the European Championships in the Hague (Photocredit: CEV)"
