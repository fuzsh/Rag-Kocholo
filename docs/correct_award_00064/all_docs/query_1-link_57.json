        "text": "Bell’Aja is the clear testimony of how a Bordeaux cut meets harmoniously with the terroir of Bolgheri. A real second vin that combines immediate pleasantness with complexity, demonstrating a character deeply linked to its area of origin.\n\nSan Felice’s Bolgheri estate covers six hectares. Bolgheri has long been famed for the breathtaking five-kilometer Cypress Avenue lined with 2,540 trees. It was immortalized by the Italian Nobel Prize winner Giosuè Carducci in his poem” Davanti San Guido”, which personifies the Cypress tress as giant's youths, running, and leaping.\n\nPurple in appearance, it exhibits a bouquet redolent of wild berry preserves, lifted by smooth notes of spice. On the palate, it is beautifully balanced and delicious, with supple, velvety tannins."
