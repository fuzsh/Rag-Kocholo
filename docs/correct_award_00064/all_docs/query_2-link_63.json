        "text": "Carducci's later poetry was the full expression of his free thought and of modern ideas, inventions, and revolutions. It inspired his compatriots in the war for Italian independence, and enjoyed an immense popularity both at home and abroad. Carducci's collection of poems ends paradoxically with the consolidation of a fanatically patriotic and classicist academic style that will be continued by Pascoli and D'Annunzio and will be a pretext of the aesthetics of fascism.\n\nGiosuè Carducci - Nobel prize in Literature 1906\n\nReason: for his deep critical research, for the freshness of style, for the lyrical strength that characterizes most of his masterpieces.\n\nGiosuè Carducci (1835-1907) was a poet, noted literary historian and an eminent orator. He was also an excellent translator of Goethe and Heine, which greatly influenced the development of his own poetry.\n\nThe cycle of his poetry begins in his young years with a strong reaction against the old academism of late Romanticism dominant in grand ducal Tuscany. The first two collections of his poetry were Rime (1857) (Rhymes) and Levia Gravia (1868) (Light and Heavy).\n\nGrazia Deledda - Nobel prize in literature 1926\n\nReason: For her works, idealistically inspired that outline clearly and vividly the life of her island.\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo - Nobel prize in literature 1959\n\nReason: because with his poetic lyricism he has portrayed the tragically human experiences of modern times\n\nLuigi Pirandello - Nobel prize in literature 1934\n\nReason: For his honest and daring attempt to perpetuate the art of theatre to the utmost dramatic levels\n\nCamillo Golgi - Nobel prize in Medecine 1906 (won 1/2 of the prize together with Santiago Ramón y Cajal from Madrid University, Spain)\n\nReason: for the researches made on the structure of the nervous system\n\nCamillo Golgi (1844- 1926) studied medicine at the University of Pavia and continued to work in Pavia at the Hospital of St. Matteo after graduating in 1865.\n\nHe directed the Department of General Pathology at St.Matteo Hospital where young doctors were trained, but never actually practised medicine himself.\n\nSalvador E. Luria - Nobel prize in Medecine 1969\n\nReason: For the discoveries of the mechanism of replication of\n\nthe genetic structure of a virus\n\nRenato Dulbecco - Nobel prize in Medecine 1975\n\nReason: For his discoveries on the interaction among carcinogenic viruses and the genetic code of the cell.\n\nNobel Prize in Physics\n\nGuglielmo Marconi - Nobel prize in Physics 1909\n\nReason: For his researches and for his discovery on wireless telegraphy\n\nRead more>>\n\nEnrico Fermi - Nobel prize in Physics 1938\n\nReason: For the discovery of artificial radioactivity produced from irradiation of neutrons\n\nRead more >>\n\nEmilio Segrè - Nobel prize in Physics 1959\n\nReason: for the discovery of the antiproton.\n\nCarlo Rubbia - Nobel prize in Physics 1984\n\nReason: For the important discovery of intermediate vectorial bosons.\n\nRiccardo Giacconi - Nobel prize in Physics 2002\n\nReason: for the discoveries on neutrins, particles that are created during fusion process of the sun and other stars\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nRita Levi-Montalcini - Nobel prize in Medecine 1986\n\nReason: For the discovery of \"growth factors\" in the nervous system (together with colleague Stanley Cohen).\n\nMario R. Capecchi - Nobel prize in Medecine 2007 (won 1/3 of the prize, together with Sir Martin J. Evans (UK) and Oliver Smithies (US)\n\nReason: for their discoveries of principles for introducing specific gene modifications in mice by the use of embryonic stem cells"
