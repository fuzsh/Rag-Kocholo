        "text": "Buongiorno!\n\nToday I want to share with you all a poem by Giosuè Carducci, who was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy. He became the first Italian in 1906 to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in Literature.\n\nThe English translation is posted at the end as well, but I challenge you to read, and re-read, solely the Italian. Translating poetry, and literature in general, is an extremely difficult feat because it’s more than just words, but rather the overall sentiment and feeling of the words itself. Thus, translations never seem to really do them justice. Here’s one for you to decipher, published in 1887, as well as a video!\n\nSan Martino (Saint Martin’s Day)\n\nby Giosuè Carducci\n\nLa nebbia agli irti colli\n\npiovigginando sale,\n\ne sotto il maestrale\n\nurla e biancheggia il mar;\n\nma per le vie del borgo\n\ndal ribollir de’ tini\n\nva l’aspro odor dei vini\n\nl’anime a rallegrar.\n\nGira su’ ceppi accesi\n\nlo spiedo scoppiettando:\n\nsta il cacciator fischiando\n\nsu l’uscio a rimirar\n\ntra le rossastre nubi\n\nstormi d’uccelli neri,\n\ncom’esuli pensieri,\n\nnel vespero migrar.\n\nThe fog to the steep hills\n\namid the rain ascends,\n\nand under the mistral\n\nthe sea screams and whitens:\n\nbut through the alleys of the village\n\nfrom the bubbling vats\n\ngoes the sour smell of wine\n\nthe souls to rejoice.\n\nTurns on burning logs\n\nthe spit, sputtering;\n\nstands the hunter whistling\n\non the door to gaze\n\namong the reddish clouds\n\nflocks of blackbirds\n\nas exiled thoughts,\n\nin the twilight migrating."
