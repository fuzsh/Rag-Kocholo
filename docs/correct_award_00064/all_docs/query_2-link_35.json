        "text": "In 1890 Giosue` Carducci (1835-1907) published this edition of his poem, \"Piemonte.\" He signed it and inscribed it to one of his disciples, Guido Mazzoni. The portrait of the great poet on the cover of another publication (a poem dedicated to him) gives some idea of his impressive physical features. Carducci's literary and political successes mounted steadily through the 19th and early 20th centuries. He became Italy's poet laureate by orders of the King and Queen of Italy. In 1890 he was elected to the Senate, and in 1906 won the Nobel Prize for literature. Guido Mazzoni's own life was inextricably linked with that of his mentor, as one can see from the enormous volume of material in the Mazzoni Pamphlets related to Carducci's life, writings, and death."
