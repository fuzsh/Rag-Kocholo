The first Italian Literature Nobel Prize.\n\nGiosuè Carducci was born in Versilia, in Valdicastello Carducci of Pietrasanta. The first Italian Literature Nobel Prize.\n\nSir Michele Carducci received his chemistry degree at Pisa University in 1833, worked for the company who handled mines in Valdicastello and his job was to assist the miners.\n\nHe was forced to work in the period when people exploded mines and for this reason, he had to move from that area.\n\nHere, on the 30th April 1833, he married Ildegonda Celli.\n\nGiosuè Alessandro Michele Carducci was born in Valdicastello on the 27th July 1835. After the failure of the mine in 1836, Michele was fired.\n\nHe later moved to Pontestazzemese.\n\nIn 1906 Giosuè was awarded with the Literature Nobel Prize by the baron de Bildet, Swedish ambassador in Italy.\n\nThe King Vittorio Emanuele has declared his hometown a national monument and it is now property of Pietrasanta.\n\nNow it is a museum and it is possible to visit it.\n\nA copy of the above mentioned act is inside. In the garden of the house, there is also a marble bust of the poet"
