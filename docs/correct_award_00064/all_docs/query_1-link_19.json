        "meta_description": "Santa Maria a Monte    Giosue’ Carducci  was one of the most famous and admired poets of the Italian Ottocento. He actively participated in the cultural life of his times as critic, scholar, and professor. Carducci was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature for his poetry.  The museum is located in the home where the Carducci family lived between 1856 and 1858. In this home the great tragedy of the Poet’s family unfolded: the death for unknown causes of the second-born Dante and, a few months after that tragic event, the death of his father. They were both buried in the old village cemetery, today called “Campo della Rimembranza”. The Poet recalls the event with the famous verses: &quot;O tu che dormi là sulla fiorita collina tosca e ti sta il padre accanto&quot; . In this frame the town council has created a guided path along the family life and the socio-cultural context of Carducci in that period through photographs, reproductions of documents, books and figurative material ad hoc.    Opening hours updated to 5 May 2021 Wednesday-Friday-Saturday  10-13 RESERVATION REQUIRED",
