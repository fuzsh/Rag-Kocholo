        "text": "Antonio Pacinotti\n\nAntonio Pacinotti (June 1841 - May 1912) from Pisa, was an Italian physicist and Professor of Physics at the University of Pisa.\n\nHe remained known to the world thanks to the invention and improving of the form of direct-current electrical generator, or dynamo.\n\nPacinotti was also one of the independent discoverers of the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle.\n\nThe Lungarno Pacinotti in Pisa is named in his honor.\n\nAndrea Bocelli\n\nAndrea Bocelli (September 22nd, 1958), Italian singer, producer, songwriter famous world wide, was born in Lajatico, the province of Pisa.\n\nHis music range is very wide. It goes from classical, over easy listening, Latin, to opera and pop.\n\nBocelli is a five-time Classical Brit winner and three-time Grammy-nominated Italian tenor. He's also Grande Ufficiale OMRI - Italian order of merit.\n\nAs very young, Bocelli was diagnosed with glaucoma, and after an accident during a football game he completely lost his sight.\n\nHis talent for singing and music was shown in his early childhood, and he was encouraged to follow his passion.\n\nHis debut album is called \"Il mare calmo della sera\" released in 1994.\n\nAndrea Bocelli has sold over 70 million albums over the world.\n\nCarlo Rubbia\n\nCarlo Rubbia (March 1934) is another famous Italian physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1984 for his work regarding discovery of the W and Z particles at CERN ( European Organization for Nuclear Research).\n\nThough he was born in Gorizia, he was another very important student of the Scuola Normale in Pisa. There he received a PhD doing cosmic ray experiments.\n\nRubbia is still active scientist and his present researches concern the problem of energy supply for the future.\n\nEnrico Fermi\n\nEnrico Fermi (September 1901 - November 1954), the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity, remained remembered for his achievements on the development of the first nuclear rector, and contributions to the development of quantum theory and statistical mechanics.\n\nHe is considered one of the most important and successful scientists of the XX century.\n\nEnrico Fermi was born in Rome, and he showed his particular interest for physics and mathematics as a young boy.\n\nVery important for his further development was his education at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. He enrolled at the school at the age of 17, and there he received his undergraduate and doctoral degree. During his studies at the Pisan university, Enrico published his first important works.\n\nAfter he graduated, Fermi took a professorship at the University of Rome, where he spent many important years.\n\nAfter he won the Nobel Prize in 1938, he was forced to emigrate to New York, mostly because of the fascist regime which was getting stronger in Italy and affected his wife, who was Jewish.\n\nWhen he arrived to New York, he started working at the Columbia University. Soon after, at the beginning of the World War II, Enrico Fermi got involved in a Manhattan Project, the project that was working on developing the first atomic bomb.\n\nEnrico Fermi died of stomach cancer, at the age of 53. He was aware of the risks that his work on the nuclear pile carried, but he continued working on it, believing in the importance of its results.\n\nLeonardo Fibonacci\n\nLaonardo Bonacci, (1170 - 1250) also known as Fibonacci, was one of the most talented Italian mathematicians born in Pisa.\n\nFibonacci became known to the world as a man who introduced and spread the Hindu-Arabic numeral system in Europe through his book Liber Abaci.\n\nA number sequence in which each number is the sum of the previous two, starting with 0 and 1 is called the Fibonacci sequence, though he didn't discover it, but used it in his book Liber Abaci.\n\nThe Fibonacci example of the Fibonacci sequence is: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...and so on.\n\nGalileo Galilei\n\nGalileo Galilei ( February 1564 - January 1642) , known as \"the father of Modern Science\", Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer and philosopher, was born in Pisa.\n\nHis contributions include the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, that were named Galilean moons in his honor, the observation and analysis of sunspots, the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the improving of the compass design.\n\nGalileo was famous for the support for Copernicanism ( the heliocentric cosmology which displaced the Earth from the center of the universe), but it made him very controversial at his time, because the majority of philosophers and astronomers still supported the geocentric cosmology which retained that the Earth was at the center of the universe.\n\nGalileo was denounced to the Roman Inquisition and the Catholic Church condemned heliocentrism as false. After he continued supporting his ideas, Galileo was forced to spend the rest of his life under house arrest.\n\nGiosuè Carducci\n\nGiosuè Carducci (July 1835 - February 1907) was the first Italian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907, a year before his death.\n\nThough he wasn't born in Pisa, but in a little town Valdicastello di Pietrasanta nearby, he's important figure of this region and worth to be mentioned here. Carducci graduated in 1856 from the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa.\n\nHe was a great poet, translator and a teacher. His style was similar to Greek and Roman antiquity, and he often used classical meters such as Horace or Virgil, for example.\n\nHis political views, clearly opposite to Christianity and secular power of the Catholic Church were very visible in his poems, such as the controversial \"Hymn to Satan\".\n\nHis later work was very appreciated and awarded with the Nobel Prize.\n\nKeith Haring"
