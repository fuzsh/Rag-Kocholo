Giosuè Carducci\n\nBorn in Valdicastello di Pietrasanta, Tuscany, the poet Giosuè Carducci (1835-1907) was the eldest son of a physician, a well-educated liberal and fervent supporter of Garibaldi and Italian Unification.\n\nA precocious child, he was reading in Latin and Greek at an early age, and especially appreciated the classic, restrained economy in the poetry of Horace, Ovid and Virgil. After winning a scholarship to Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa he began teaching, and in 1857 published his first book of poetry, Rime. He moved to Bologna in 1860 when he was appointed Chair of Italian Eloquence at the University, and remained in the city for the rest of his life."
