        "text": "Property of the Scuola since 1994, Collegio Carducci was partially restored in 2002. The building was dedicated to Giosuè Carducci, the poet who was an undergraduate of the Faculty of Letters from 1853 to 1856, and was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1906.\n\nCollegio Carducci is situated in via Turati, not far from the central station of Pisa; it can house up to 91 students in single rooms. In addition to the rooms, it has four small study rooms, a computer room, a music room, a breakfast room, a TV room and a reading room with a billiard table. On the fifth floor there is an ample terrace, utilised by the students for reading and relaxing.\n\nThe college is currently undergoing intensive redevelopment which, in addition to modernisation of the fittings and systems and a reorganisation of the communal spaces so as to make them more habitable, will render the building anti-seismic and energy-saving."
