        "text": "With his collection of poems \"Tremalume\", Fabio Pusterla, adjunct professor at USI Faculty of Communication, Culture and Society, won the 67th Giosuè Carducci National Poetry Prize.\n\nIt was actor Neri Marcorè, the star of the award ceremony held last 27 July in Piazza Duomo in Pietrasanta (Lucca), who announced the winner of the 67th Giosuè Carducci National Poetry Prize, promoted by the Municipality of Pietrasanta, with the patronage of the Region of Tuscany and the Province of Lucca.\n\n\"Tremalume\" is the ninth collection by Fabio Pusterla, published in 2022 in the series \"Gli alianti\" by the publishing house Marcos y Marcos. The collection marks a new experimental season, foretold in the self-commentary of the anthology \"Da qualche parte nello spazio (Le Lettere, 2022)\". The title is a neologism invented by the author in which trembling, threat and worry in no way eliminate the small survival of a light, of a minimal light to rely on. It is precisely from the word-image \"Tremalume\", as anticipated in the self-commentary to the previous anthology, that the illumination arises to give structure and meaning to an existing and partly edited corpus.\n\nFour years after his last book, \"Cenere, o terra\" (Ashes, or Earth), in these new, increasingly limpid verses, the exposure, the public and private pain reveal the strength of a sign that remains, an intimate and subdued hope capable of projecting itself into the cosmos, into the millennia, feeding on memory and vastness.\n\n//Born in Mendrisio in 1957, Fabio Pusterla is active as a poet, translator and essayist and teaches at the Liceo di Lugano and Università della Svizzera italiana. He has received numerous important awards, such as the Eugenio Montale Prize (1986), the Schiller Prize (1986, 2000, 2010) and the Gottfried Keller Prize (2007)."
