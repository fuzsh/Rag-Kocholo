        "text": "Back in 2005 I said “Second-guessing the Swedish Academy’s often bizarre choices and omissions for the Nobel Prize in literature is a time-honored game,” and one of the prime examples of omission is Leo Tolstoy, who lived for a decade after the institution of the prize and was never awarded it. I confess I’ve always enjoyed rubbing their nose in that myself (from a distance, that is; I’ve never actually met the Academy). Now I learn, from Dmitry Bykov (whose thoughts on the subject can be read here, in Russian) that it was his own choice. I’ll quote the English-language account by Kristin Masters here:\n\n[…] In 1902, Tolstoy was again passed over for the prize; the Nobel committee awarded it to Theodor Momms[e]n. Losing out on the prize didn’t seem to bother Tolstoy much. In fact, he said “it saved me the painful necessity of dealing in some way with the money…generally regarded as very necessary and useful, but which I regard as the source of every kind of evil.” Despite Tolstoy’s own conciliatory reaction, the furor continued. A Swedish newspaper published an editorial in 1902 calling the the Nobel committee “unfair craftsmen and literature amateurs.”\n\nThree years later Tolstoy published Great Sin [the long essay «Великий грех», supporting the theories of Henry George about the “sin” of landed property]. […] The Russian Academy of Sciences decided that the work truly enhanced Tolstoy’s standing as a writer, so they decided to nominate him again for the Nobel Prize. The nomination letter was approved by all of Russia’s outstanding academic institutions and was accompanied by a copy of Great Sin.\n\nBut Tolstoy still genuinely wanted nothing to do with the prize. The moment he learned of the nomination, he took up a pen for himself. Tolstoy wrote to his friend Arvid Jarnefelt, a Finnish writer. He entreated Jarnefelt, “If it was meant to happen, then it would be very unpleasant for me to refuse from it. That is why, I have a favor to ask. If you have any links in Sweden (I think you have), please try to make it so I would not be awarded with the prize. Please, try to do the best you can to avoid the award of the prize to me.” Whether Jarnefelt intervened or the committee had designs of its own, Tolstoy didn’t win the prize. Giosuè Carducci did.\n\nBykov elaborates on the non-award as follows:\n\nI believe that Tolstoy is perhaps not suited for the Nobel based on three criteria. First, Tolstoy is a figure of such real significance that awarding him the prize would introduce a certain triviality into his life as a prophet, an elder, the leader of a fairly influential sect, a serious critic of the government, and so on. It is not proper for such a man to chase after the signs of earthly glory. […] The second criterion […] is that Tolstoy, generally speaking, is a figure of world significance, and the Nobel is very fond of encouraging people who put one or another territory on the geographical map, like [García] Márquez, for example. You can’t say Tolstoy put Russia on the world map, that he somehow described Russian specificity. On the contrary, Tolstoy is a world genius […]. And the third reason is that Tolstoy does not qualify for the Nobel Prize at all. This may sound strange, but Nobel, when he […] bequeathed the prize, demanded quite specifically — it’s written in his will — that the literary prize should be awarded for works that affirm idealism. This is extremely difficult to say about Tolstoy.\n\nЯ как раз полагаю, что Толстой под Нобеля, что ли, не подпадает по трем критериям. Во-первых, Толстой ― фигура действительно столь значительная, что присуждение ему премии вносит какую-то суетность в его жизнь пророка, жизнь старца, жизнь вождя довольно влиятельной секты, жизнь серьезного критика правительства и так далее. Негоже такому человеку гоняться за знаками земной славы. […] Вторая вещь, второй критерий, по которому Толстой туда не подходит,― Толстой, вообще говоря, фигура значения всемирного, а Нобель очень любит поощрять людей, которые наносят на географическую карту ту или иную территорию, как, например, Маркес. Нельзя сказать, что Толстой нанес Россию на карту мира, что он как-то описал русскую специфику. Толстой, наоборот, всемирный гений […]. И третья причина, по которой Толстой совсем не тянет на Нобеля. Вот это странно звучит, но Нобель, когда учреждал, когда завещал премию, требовал совершенно конкретно, у него это прописано, чтобы литературная премия присуждалась за произведения, утверждающие идеализм. Относительно Толстого сказать это крайне трудно.\n\nAs always with Bykov, you can argue with him, but he’s always fun to read and makes one think. Another example of this I recently happened on:\n\nWhy was Esenin better at plays than prose? Because prose requires the ability to spend some time as a different person.\n\nПочему Есенину пьесы удавались лучше, чем проза? Потому что для прозы требуется умение побыть другим человеком.\n\nI’ve never read either his plays or his prose and have no idea if it’s a just remark as applied to Esenin, but it’s certainly a generally applicable point."
