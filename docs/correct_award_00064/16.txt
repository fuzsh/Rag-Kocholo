Giosué Carducci was born in Valdicastello, Italy. After graduating from the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, he began teaching.

Inspired both by his own time as well as his study of the classical and Italian poets, Carducci began writing poetry when he was a child. His first collection of poetry was Rime (1857). He was an atheist whose criticism of Christianity is most prominently showcased in the provocative poem “Hymn to Satan” (published in 1865).
