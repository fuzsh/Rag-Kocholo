The phrase “An American Obsession” in the title of the book is very apt indeed. The chapters in the book take the reader through various facets of this obsession with the game. The book also highlights the significant and unique feature of football in America—that of the competing and complimenting entities of intercollegiate football governed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the professional football league governed by the National Football League (NFL). While the chapters attest to the strategies, tactics, skills of football, they also discuss the issues of race, ethnicity, religion, and social class.

GEMS North Central College\n\nT\n\nhe American game of football has long been the most popular sport in the United States. Each autumn season, local communities flock to high school games on Friday nights, cheer on their regional college favorites on Saturday, and tune in to telecasts of their professional teams on Sundays. This was a norm for years; but football has so overwhelmed the American sportscape that games are now televised virtually every night of the week, and even high school contests are broadcast to a national audience. Both college and professional teams play abroad in search of new markets and this quintessential American sport is now played in more than 100 countries (http://ifaf.org). How did such explosive growth and interest come to pass? Surely the internet has been a factor, as the chapter “American Football and the Media” demonstrates, but this book intends to take a more comprehensive exploration and analysis of this global phenomenon, from its historical roots to its global presence. The game evolved from English soccer to rugby; but assumed its current form in the college rivalries of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The professional variety emerged when an urban athletic club, which had bet large sums of money on the outcome of its annual game with a rival team, paid a former All-American from Yale to bolster its chances of winning. Extensive gambling on games resulted in increasing numbers of talented players being paid, eventually resulting in entirely professional teams. This book covers the history of such developments in the chapters “American Football” and “College Football,” as well as the establishment of youth football programs in “High School and Youth Football.” Football had already become a big business by the 1880s as Harvard, Princeton, and Yale had to rent New York arenas to accommodate their legions of fans that flocked to the big rivalry games. When Harvard erected its own stadium in 1903, other schools were obliged to follow. Such games captured the national interest as entertainment spectacles, long before the Super Bowl and the Football Bowl Series for the national collegiate football championship became commercial bonanzas, as recounted in the chapter “The Super Bowl: An American Institution.” The National Football League has become a capitalist behemoth, where millionaire players argue with billionaire owners over how best to divide the overflow of riches, and “The Economics of American College and Professional Football” shows us how this has happened. ix\n\nTouchdown.indd 9\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nAlthough NFL Europe, an initial attempt to capture the European market, could not displace the entrenched attraction to soccer, discussed in “American Football in Europe,” the NFL continues to make concerted global efforts to grow the game and its revenue with games in London, Germany, and Mexico. A Mexico City game in 2005 drew 103,467 spectators to the game (http://www.cbssports. com/nfl/news/nfl-games-in-mexico-or-germany-could-happen-by-2017/). Yet that figure pales in comparison to the 120,000 who showed up to witness a clash between two high school teams in Chicago in 1937. College stadiums presumably can no longer hold the multitudes who seek a seat at campus venues. A temporary football field was constructed within the Bristol Motor Speedway to accommodate 156,000 fans for a game between Tennessee and Virginia Tech on 10 September 2016. The previous Saturday, the Texas-Notre Dame encounter drew 11 million television viewers, a new record (TV Guide Magazine, 19–25 September 2016, 20). In Texas, where football has assumed the status of a secular religion, high schools have built stadiums at a cost well in excess of $60 million (Chad 2016). A sport economist examines the commercial ramifications of such developments for readers in “The Economics of American College and Professional Football.” The spirit and atmosphere of the game is further portrayed in the chapter “Imagining Football Fandom in the United States: Home of the Free or the Branded Pursuit of Belonging?” which takes on the rabid fan culture, with its mascots, chants, cheers, painted and costumed bodies, symbols, and rivalries. Such local, regional, and national implications are rampant in the popular culture, often depicted in movies, books, and oral histories that sustain interest over generations. As detailed in “Football Warriors: The Archeology of Football Movies,” football movies have been prominent for nearly a century, since the infancy of American film-making. The chapter “Football and Social Change” shows us how football has been and continues to be a social force relative to racial, ethnic, social class, and gender issues. The Carlisle Indian School football teams, featuring Jim Thorpe (recognized as the world’s greatest athlete at the 1912 Olympic Games), used football to dispel notions of white racial superiority. Few know that Fritz Pollard became the first black quarterback in the NFL in the 1920s, long before Jackie Robinson desegregated Major League Baseball. One of the early professional teams founded in 1901, the Columbus Panhandles, was manned by the six Nesser brothers, working-class boilermakers. It became one of the original members of the NFL, along with other industrial teams that fueled the aspirations of working-class men and sustained the perception of sport as a meritocracy. Masculinity and militarism have been tied to the game since its modern origins in the nineteenth century. It served as a surrogate form of warfare between the Civil War and the Spanish-American War in which young men might display their courage and fighting skills. The early rules, still evident in the game of rugby, required the ball carrier to “touch down” the ball in the opponent’s end zone to score points. A “maul in goal” might result if a defender could wrestle the ball away before the ball carrier earned the points. The early game was considerably rougher than the current version. Players wore no helmets and grew their hair long for some padding. A ball carrier might be brought down by “throttling” or choking him by the neck. Opponents could even slug their foes three times before being expelled from the game. Broken bones and even deaths were not uncommon, which eventually x\n\nTouchdown.indd 10\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession Goes Global\n\nresulted in the formation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1906 to regulate the game among college teams (Gems 2000). A brief linguistic analysis of football terminology (such as a long pass known as a bomb, linemen fighting it out in the trenches, or linebackers “blitzing” the quarterback) give some indication of the militaristic links to the game. Promoters and even the US government deemed the sport a means to develop leadership skills and it was readily established at the military academies. Only males were allowed to be school cheerleaders because it was assumed that no male spectators would follow the directions of a female. During and after World War I, the Rose Bowl game was contested not between colleges, but between military teams in 1918 and 1919. By the onset of the Korean War in 1950, the US Navy counted eighty admirals who had played the game and the US Army numbered ninety-eight generals as former players (Gems 2000, 100). More recently, the tragic death of Pat Tillman (1976–2002), who eschewed his career in the NFL to fight with the US Army in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been much discussed and commemorated. The NFL alliance with the US military is regularly acknowledged in pre-game and halftime rituals. The violence and aggression that accompanies game play is often highlighted in the media, and the New Orleans Saints were even penalized for a bounty system that rewarded players for injuring their opponents between 2009 and 2011. What do such things tell us about American culture? This book intends to provide some answers. As shown in “Concussions: Medical and Legal Controversies in Football,” the violence and aggression that permeates the sport have produced health and economic concerns as injuries, particularly concussions and brain damage that portend life-threatening debility have become a major concern, as are the scandals, controversies, and issues that occur in players’ increasingly public lives. Scandals and imbroglios in football are longstanding, as revealed in “Scandals and Controversies in Football.” And while the NFL began tying itself to the military and a nationalistic spirit in the 1980s, that synergy backfired after the 2016 season when Colin Kaepernick, quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, failed to stand for the national anthem in a protest against racial injustice. A multitude of players joined in the crusade in the 2017 season, incurring the wrath of President Donald Trump and nationalistic supporters who perceived their actions as un-American. American football appears to be a very gendered, masculine game; but few know that professional women’s leagues have been in existence for decades. The game is even more popular among women in many other countries outside of North America, as explored by one of the top scholars in gender studies in “Challenging the Gender Order: Women on the Gridiron.” In “Playing Football,” an autobiographical account by a distinguished scholar Michael Oriard, who played the game at all levels, from youth sport to the NFL, provides some insight into the psychology that drives participants, as well as the personal and national identity affiliated with the sport. The second part of the book provides an extensive account of the growth of American football around the world. Throughout the twentieth century, American military forces brought the game to foreign shores, creating their own leagues, but also introducing the game to local populations that both adopted and adapted it to their own cultures. A group of prominent international scholars have contributed separate chapters on Canada, Latin America, Europe, China, Japan, and the Pacific Region to show the historical introduction of football to various areas of the globe xi\n\nTouchdown.indd 11\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nand its current status in each. Things change quickly in American football - contact the publisher or check the authors’ blogs or Twitter feeds for recent information. The growth of American football in such regions and the capitalist quest for global markets suggests that the sport will eventually encompass several continents, similar to the American sports of baseball and basketball. Regional professional leagues and an eventual world championship, not unlike the World Baseball Classic, seem inevitable. The International Federation of American Football (IFAF) has been organizing world championships since 1999, including a women’s championship initiated in 2010 (www.ifaf.info). The articles in this anthology cover the sport in both the broad scope of its contents and the depth of its coverage in a manner accessible to both knowledgeable fans and interested neophytes. The stimulating explication and insightful analysis presented in this collection is intended to bring greater understanding to a global audience as to why football remains an American obsession.\n\nFurther Reading Benedict, J., & Keteyian, A.

SMITH Pennsylvania State University\n\nAmerican football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States and is played on several levels with slightly different rules, from youth teams to the professional National Football League. The full-contact game, almost (but not quite) exclusively played by men and boys, has its origins in English rugby. Both college football and professional football are major business enterprises (often in competition with each other) that rely on television for their wide and growing popularity. Keywords: football, youth sports, NFL, television, intercollegiate sports, Super Bowl, violence, concussions, race\n\nA\n\nmerican football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States and is played in organized form in youth, middle school, high school, college, semi-professional, and the professional National Football League (NFL). In many communities, especially in the South and Midwest, the Friday night or Saturday high school football game is a community event that draws thousands of fans to what are often fierce and long-standing rivalries between neighboring communities. About one-quarter of the US population (75–80 million people) are college football fans, many identifying with the teams of their state or alma mater. The NFL is the most popular sport league on television, broadcast in 2015 on five networks and in satellite and cable packages of games and is also the most popular spectator sport, drawing an average more than sixty-seven-thousand spectators to the sixteen games each week. The spillover from football into popular culture in the United States is a significant component of male culture and a contributor to the national economy through the sale of books; movies; interactive video games; participation in fantasy football, which had 74.7 million participants, generating $4.6 billion; and gambling, which has produced much more in the way of wagers.\n\nOverview of Basic Rules Entire books are written on the rules and strategies of modern football. To summarize the basics, a 100-yard field is divided into ten-yard segments. (One yard is slightly less than a meter.) There is an additional ten-yard end zone on both sides 3\n\nTouchdown.indd 3\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nof the field. The beginning of a game is determined by a coin toss. Team captains come forward, and the visiting team calls heads or tails. Whichever team wins the coin toss gets to choose which team receives or makes the kickoff, or which goal the team will defend (an advantage on a windy day); alternately, a team may choose to defer to the other team. This last option can be advantageous, because whichever team doesn’t make the pre-game choice gets to make the same choice at halftime. Once play begins, the team playing offense (the team in possession of the ball) has four downs (or plays) to advance the ball a minimum of ten yards down the field by running or passing (throwing) or else it loses possession of the ball. Strategies for plays are complex, but the basic choices are to run the ball down the field, to throw the ball in a forward pass, or to punt (i.e., kick) it. The team playing defense attempts to tackle the player who is holding the ball in order to halt the ball’s forward progress. The defending team, if it is skilled and fortunate, will be able to intercept a pass so its team members can run the ball to the opposite end in an attempt to score. Interceptions and returning punts provide some of the most exciting moments of a football game, especially when they lead to a long run down the field. If a team fails to advance the ball ten yards or score in its allotted four downs (plays), possession of the ball switches to the other team. The ultimate goal of the game is to get the ball into the end zone (called a touchdown because the original rules required the ball to physically touch the ground), by running it in or completing a pass inside the end zone. Either method earns six points. After a touchdown, the team that scored is given the opportunity to earn an extra point. There are two ways to score an extra point (or, less commonly, two points) after a touchdown. The more common choice is to attempt to score an extra point by kicking the ball through the goal posts at the end of the field. (NFL teams must kick the extra point from the fifteen-yard line). Or, in what is called a “two-point conversion,” the team may attempt to run or pass the ball into the end zone from the two-yard line (or the three-yard line for college and high school players) to earn two extra points. (Football fans and statisticians have analyzed the relative success rates of one and two-point conversions, and the consensus seems to be that kicking, which scores less but has a slightly higher rate of success, leads to more extra points in the long run.) The crossbar of the goal post is ten feet above the ground, and the uprights are twenty-four feet apart. The ball must pass between the uprights and over the crossbar to earn a point. After touchdowns, the next most common way of scoring points is the field goal. Often on the fourth down, if a team doesn’t think a touchdown is possible, but is close enough to be able to kick the ball through the goal post, the team will attempt to kick the ball through the goal post to earn three points. Although this may appear to be an easy task, it is in fact quite difficult; designated kickers are highly trained athletes whose skills are invaluable to a successful team. Field goals are also a fast way to score a few more points if there isn’t enough time left in a quarter for four full downs. The final way to score points in football—one that is somewhat rare—is known as the “safety.” A safety occurs when a member of the offensive team downs the ball, most often unwillingly, behind the team’s own goal line, resulting in two points for the defensive team. (For more complete information on rules, regulations, and strategies, such as offsides and proper possession of the ball, see Long and Czarnecki 2011). 4\n\nTouchdown.indd 4\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter One: American Football\n\nOrigins of the Game Since the nineteenth century, football has developed differently in the United States than in the rest of the world, where the word “football” refers to a much different (and more globally loved) sport of soccer. (The terms “football” and “soccer” will be used in this article, rather than “American football” and “football” which would have been also an option.) The game was thriving in colleges well before the professional game took hold. The sport has remained a game played almost exclusively by boys and men, unlike other popular team sports such as baseball, for which women formed a professional league in the 1940s and 1950s, soccer, and basketball, which girls and women made the most popular sport in schools and colleges for most of the twentieth century. In contrast to its current popularity, football’s appeal was quite modest when it emerged from English rugby during the period from the 1870s to the early 1900s. The game first became popular in the elite colleges of the East after the students of Harvard University refused to play soccer. Led by Yale University’s Walter Camp (1859–1925), players changed rugby football rules to reflect the desire among the college students for an allegedly more scientific, rational game.\n\nOrigins in Rugby and Soccer Rugby football evolved at Rugby School, one of England’s elite private secondary schools known as “public schools.” Two distinct forms of football had developed in Britain: association football (a term that came to be corrupted by schoolboys into the term “soccer”) and rugby, a contest emphasizing running more than kicking. The English Football Association, founded by former public school and university players in 1863. The Association, located in London, codified the rules of soccer in 1863 when it was founded by elite ex-public school and Oxford and Cambridge University players working in London. The Football Association had hoped to create one game of the various school and college games but was unable to convince the rugby players of the need for one unified game of football. The Rugby Football Union was formed in 1871 to promote the running version of the game with a specific set of codified rules. During the 1860s and early 1870s, many US college students were playing forms of soccer, whereas Harvard students had created a game more akin to English rugby than soccer. On most US campuses, soccer had evolved as part of class battles. The sophomores would challenge the freshmen to a kicking game in which the kicking of opponents appeared to be as common as kicking the ball. These games were part of the traditional initiation rituals found on all college campuses where cocky sophomores initiated freshmen through hazing. At Harvard the first day of school in the autumn was known as “Bloody Monday,” because the sophomores generally beat the freshmen into submission. Other matches throughout the year might include the freshmen combining with the juniors to battle the sophomores and seniors. These matches became so brutal, especially the Bloody Monday matches, that Harvard authorities banned football in 1860. At many other colleges, however, students continued to play football, including two New Jersey institutions—Princeton and Rutgers—that were located 5\n\nTouchdown.indd 5\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nless than twenty miles (thirty-two kilometers) apart. A year after the US Civil War (1861–1865), when baseball was expanding greatly throughout the United States, a Princeton team had beaten a Rutgers team in their first intercollegiate baseball contest 40–2. Three years later, Rutgers challenged Princeton to a two-out-of-three football competition. On 6 November 1869, the first intercollegiate football game was played on the Rutgers campus with teams of twenty-five on a side. The agreedupon rules resembled those of soccer, but the players could bat the inflated rubber ball with hands or fists as well as with feet. The goal posts were eight paces apart and were located at the ends of a 75-yard field, three-quarters the size of the nowstandard field of 100-yards. Rutgers accumulated six goals first and won 6–4 before a crowd that included a small number of Princeton partisans, who took the train to New Brunswick. They and the Rutgers fans saw a contest featuring “headlong running, wild shouting, and frantic kicking” and a Princeton player who forgot which end was his and sent the ball to his own goal. The game was followed by a gastronomic and convivial evening that included a roast game dinner, impromptu speeches, and the singing of college songs. A week later Rutgers visited Princeton, playing under Princeton’s usual rules that allowed the free kick, whereby a player could catch the ball in the air or on first bounce and kick it without hindrance. Princeton’s 8–0 victory called for a third and decisive game, but it was not played, possibly because of administrators’ interference, but more likely because the two institutions were not able to agree on common rules.\n\n“The Boston Game” and Further Developments Although most colleges were playing a variation of association football, the soccer-like game was short-lived despite the rules being codified on several campuses, as teams could not agree on the rules. Harvard was the only major school not playing a form of soccer. The Harvard men called their pastime “the Boston game,” in which a player could catch or pick up the ball and then kick it or even run with it. The opportunity to run with the ball was the key in the development of a novel football game in the United States. This new game resembled rugby, which was not played by any of the colleges. Yale, Harvard’s chief rival in crew (rowing) and baseball during the early 1870s, played its first intercollegiate football contest against Columbia in 1872. The Yale victory was the beginning of the most successful college program during the first century of intercollegiate football. The next year, a “western” school, the University of Michigan, challenged Cornell to a football match, but Cornell’s president, Andrew D. White (1882–1918), denied permission with the comment: “I will not permit 30 men to travel 400 miles merely to agitate a bag of wind.” With interest expanding, Yale called a convention to write common rules for league play in 1873 (Peckham 1967). Harvard absented itself from the convention, with the argument that the soccer-like game was inferior to their own version of the game, This action drastically changed the history of American football. While the students of Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and Rutgers agreed to common rules, Harvard kept its own. This decision meant that the Harvard team only played two matches in 1874 against 6\n\nTouchdown.indd 6\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter One: American Football\n\nMcGill University from Montreal, Canada. The first game between the most elite institutions in each country was played according to Harvard’s rules and the second by McGill’s rugby rules. The Harvard men enjoyed the rugby game and in the spring of 1875 they played against a team of the nearby Tufts College in the first rugby game between colleges in the United States. Soon players of Yale asked Harvard to play a “football” game, but the Harvard students would agree only if rugby rules were used. The Yale team, to save face, agreed to “concessionary” rules, but they were in fact those of rugby. Some Princeton men traveled to New England to see the game. Wanting to play the more prestigious game played by the Yale and Harvard teams, the students at Princeton changed their rules and played rugby in the future.\n\nThe Thanksgiving Tradition is Born After Princeton accepted rugby, a convention was called in which the future “Big Three“ and Columbia met to adopt standard rugby rules and form the Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA) in the autumn of 1876. Yale was reluctant to accept fifteen men on a team rather than its favored eleven. Nevertheless, the IFA decided to initiate a Thanksgiving Day championship contest between the two leading teams of the previous year. Yale and Princeton were chosen for the first of the traditional Thanksgiving Day games, and the two schools continued to dominate the game for the next two decades. By the 1890s, the contest kicked off New York City elite’s social season, giving added social significance to the contest. As many as forty-thousand people viewed the contest in the Polo Grounds or at Manhattan Field, and the Thanksgiving Day tradition spread across the United States as “a holiday granted by the State and the nation to see a game of football” (New York Herald 1893, 3).\n\nFurther Refinement of the Rules The eastern elite schools Americanized the rugby rules that the rest of the schools accepted as their own. Walter Camp, the “father” of US football, had played for Yale in the first Thanksgiving Day championship game. Camp, more than any other person, created the US version of football. Camp began attending football rules meetings in 1877 as a sophomore (second year student) and continued for the next forty-eight years. In 1880 he suggested possibly the most radical rule in football history, one giving continuous possession of the ball to one team after a player was tackled. In rugby, when a player was downed, the ball would be placed in a “scrummage.” The ball might go forward or backward, with possession in doubt. To Camp, this rule was not rational. Camp proposed a “scrimmage” in which the team in original possession would snap (propel) the ball back to a quarter-back who would hand it to another back in a logical play. One team could control the ball for as much as an entire half unless the ball was fumbled away or was kicked to the opponents. Camp, by the early 1880s, suggested incorporating the notion of “downs,” in which one team was given three attempts (downs) to advance five yards or lose possession of the ball. The five-yard chalk lines created a “gridiron” effect and a new nickname for the game. The consequence of the short distance to be gained in three attempts created the need for exacting plays, the development of 7\n\nTouchdown.indd 7\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nsignals for calling the plays, and the introduction of players running interference for the ball carrier, another modification of rugby. Mass plays led to the charge of brutality during the late nineteenth century. The change from the more open running of the original rugby game to tight line smashes resulted from a rule to allow tackling below the waist in 1887. The low tackle did much to reduce the effectiveness of open field running and contributed to the unfolding of various wedge formations, including the famous “flying wedge.” Wedges were V-shaped formations that “snowplowed” a particular position in the defense. In the flying wedge players began about twenty-five yards behind the scrimmage line and progressed at full speed from two angles to form a “V” formation just before the ball was passed to the runner behind the “V.” The play was so brutal to the defensive player at whom it was aimed that it existed for only one season before it was outlawed. Plays such as the flying wedge and other mass plays eventually led to the forward pass, a radical change legislated in 1906 to open up the game. The game’s brutality was evidenced at a time when US society was urbanizing and thought to be losing manly qualities found on the frontier. College students had often been the symbol of the effete, pale, and dyspeptic scholars, persons lacking the virile element considered to be an important aspect of US society. Football could counteract this negative, demasculinized image and give college life the picture of vitality and manliness. As the century waned, US president Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), more than any other person, stood for the strenuous life needed for US leadership in the world. Roosevelt believed that football, if played fairly, could add to the vigor of the nation. “Hit the line hard: don’t foul and don’t shirk, but hit the line hard” was to Roosevelt and many other people a metaphor worth pursuing in life as in football. Only after football became the most prominent college sport by the 1890s, did the game become professionalized. The professional game did not challenge the dominance of college football until the 1960s, when television coverage of the National Football League (NFL) made professional football popular. By that time African American players had become prominent in both college and professional football. With increased revenues, professional players formed a labor union and demanded a higher portion of the profits being made by team owners. By the end of the last century football had become the most popular spectator sport in the United States.\n\nCollege vs. Professional Football College football was a US symbol of virility before the first identified contest in which players were known to be paid. The professional game has been traced to the payment of Walter “Pudge” Heffelfinger (1867–1954), the acknowledged greatest college player of the nineteenth century. Heffelfinger was on Walter Camp’s first all-American team in 1889 as well as the next two years. In the autumn after his graduation from Yale, he was playing for the Chicago Athletic Club, as was Ben “Sport” Donnelly, formerly of Princeton. When the club concluded a tour of the eastern United States, Heffelfinger and Donnelly did not return to Chicago. The Allegheny Athletic Association, located near Pittsburgh, saw an opportunity to defeat the rival Pittsburgh Athletic Club with the help of outsiders and recruited Heffelfinger 8\n\nTouchdown.indd 8\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter One: American Football\n\nand Donnelly to play for them. Heffelfinger received the enormous sum of $500, approximately a worker’s yearly wage, plus travel expenses, and Donnelly received $250 plus expenses. In a contest with high betting stakes, Heffelfinger picked up a fumble and ran for the game’s only touchdown. Other “amateur” teams began paying their players in western Pennsylvania, upper New York, and especially Ohio. Most of the better players were collegians, who at times played on Saturdays for college teams and competed under assumed names for pro teams on Sundays. Some of the players were professional baseball players as well as collegians. Christy Mathewson (1880–1925), a Bucknell University player and later a star pitcher in baseball for the New York Giants, played for Pittsburgh Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss (1865–1932), who fielded a football team in 1898. The strongest teams early in the twentieth century were formed in Ohio, where Akron, Canton, Columbus, Dayton, and Massillon created unparalleled rivalries, particularly the Canton Bulldogs and Massillon Tigers of towns a buggy ride apart. A scandal emanating from a bribe offer disrupted continuous play, but pro football in the area was renewed in 1912. By then the game resembled the modern version with the legalization of the forward pass, touchdowns counting six points and field goals three, a standardized 100-yard field size (see ESPN 2013), and four downs to gain ten yards. Ohio again led the way in the professional game. Collegians such as Knute Rockne (1888–1931) of Notre Dame and the great African American stars—Paul Robeson (1898–1976) of Rutgers and Fritz Pollard (1894–1986) of Brown—played in Ohio. Rockne once played for six different teams in a two-month period. Massillon hired forty-five top players for one game to ensure that the opponent would not hire any of them. Jim Thorpe (1888–1953), the star of the Carlisle Indian School around 1910, was paid $250 a game in 1915 to play for the Canton Bulldogs. When Thorpe, the “greatest athlete” of the first half of the twentieth century, made his debut at Canton, eight thousand spectators saw him lead the Bulldogs to a victory over the hated Massillon Tigers. Although the crowds at professional games did not compare with those at the best college games, interest in football was increasing when World War I, momentarily, halted the game. Two of the most important pro franchises were a result of industry-sponsored teams—the Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears. In Wisconsin in 1919, Curly Lambeau (1898–1965), a Notre Dame dropout, received $500 from the Indian Packing Company of Green Bay to organize a team, the Green Bay Packers. After a 10–1 season playing regional teams, each player was paid $16.75. The following year George Halas (1895–1983), a former University of Illinois player, organized a team with money from the Staley Starch Company of Decatur, Illinois. Players on Halas’s Decatur Staleys were hired by the company and paid $50 a week, with two hours off each day to practice football. After a ten-win, one-loss, and two-tie season, the average payment for playing was $125 a game. Halas, with the blessing of the Staley Company, moved his team to Chicago, where he renamed it the “Bears” because it shared Wrigley Field with the Chicago Cubs baseball team. In 1920, he joined a group that was the forerunner of the National Football League. The NFL was formed as the American Professional Football Association in 1920 and renamed the National Football League in 1922. Green Bay and Chicago, along with the New York Giants and the Washington Redskins, came to dominate the NFL until the end of World War II. 9\n\nTouchdown.indd 9\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nThe relationship between the professional game and the intercollegiate game has been a long one and close in many ways. The star players of the early professional teams were mostly collegians from the time of Heffelfinger in the 1890s. Nearly as important, many college coaches had played professional football, including such renowned coaches as Knute Rockne of Notre Dame, Hugo Bezdek (1884–1952) of Penn State, Bert Ingwersen (1898–1969) of Illinois, and Jimmy Conzelman (1898–1970) of St. Louis. Coaches, too, shifted between college teams and pro teams. Examples included Arnold Horween (1898–1985), who moved from the Chicago Cardinals pro team in the 1920s to head Harvard University’s team, and Jock Sutherland (1889–1948), who took over the Brooklyn professional team after a successful career at the University of Pittsburgh. The Midwestern Big-10 Conference and the Ivy League in the East were so concerned about pro football during the mid-1920s that they legislated that all employees of athletic departments who took part in professional football games as players or officials were disqualified from employment in athletics at conference institutions.\n\nAmateurism vs. Professionalism: The “Red Grange” Rule The case of Harold “Red” Grange (1903–1991), a star halfback at the University of Illinois, led to an outcry by colleges against the pros for signing a player before he graduated from college. During his senior year Grange signed a football contract with the Chicago Bears within a week of playing his last college game against Ohio State in 1925. The reaction was so negative that the NFL decided to make an agreement with the colleges not to sign any football player before his eligibility was completed or his class had graduated. The so-called Red Grange Rule lasted for more than a half-century, when the agreement could no longer stand up under federal antitrust law because it violated the freedom of people to sign contracts, a conspiracy in restraint of trade. Pro football received a degree of national attention when Red Grange joined the Chicago Bears and went on an eastern and then southern and western tour, at one point playing seven games in eleven days. Clearly, having the pros feed off the colleges was more important than having the colleges benefit from the pros. Pro football gained stature because its teams increasingly used the colleges as “farm teams.” In an attempt to ensure an equitable distribution of college players within the professional ranks, the annual draft of college players was devised in 1936. When Jay Berwanger (1914–2002) of the University of Chicago (the first Heisman Trophy winner) was chosen by the worst team in the NFL, the Philadelphia Eagles, it was an attempt to give weaker teams an opportunity to improve their teams immediately. That Berwanger chose to enter business and not the NFL was a reflection of the lack of esteem accorded professional football during the 1930s. Some other star college players, however, were drafted and joined pro teams, including Byron “Whizzer” White (1917–2002) of the University of Colorado, who was paid the NFL’s highest salary of $15,800 to join the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1938. White later went into law and was appointed to the US Supreme Court. College football far outstripped professional football until the 1960s. The college game took advantage of claiming to be amateur, with athletes playing for\n\n10\n\nTouchdown.indd 10\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter One: American Football\n\nthe honor of their alma mater. British amateurism’s upper-class notions of participating in sport purely for enjoyment, not financial benefits, applied to college football in the United States as well. Even though the college game had been developed on a commercial model with huge stadiums, highly paid coaches, and subsidized athletes (either overtly or covertly), people generally believed that the athletes were amateurs. The positive virtue of “amateurism” added to the luster of football traditions of homecoming, pep rallies, “tailgating,” cheerleaders, and marching bands. College coaches and other college athletic officials feared the growth of professional football. At about the time the NFL came into existence, college coaches formed the Football Coaches Association (FCA). One of the association’s first actions in 1921 was to unanimously resolve that professional football was “detrimental to the best interests of American football and American youth and that football coaches [should] lend their influence to discourage the professional game” (New York Times 1921, 13). The fear that pro football would hurt the college game continued through the century. That fear was seen early in creation of the Red Grange Rule, and it continued with such actions during the 1960s as forbidding the mention of pro football in college football telecasts and lobbying to pass federal legislation to prohibit pro football from televising games on Saturdays, when college football is traditionally played.\n\nBowl Games The fear of the pros was a major stimulus in the 1960s decision to allow unlimited substitutions (two-platoon football) to increase fan interest, which was being lost to the more exciting pro game. The fear of professional competition almost led to the creation of a playoff system for college football during the 1960s, but the previous development of “bowl” games at the end of each season made the playoff problematical and less attractive. Season-ending bowl games added to the interest. The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, began in 1902 and has been continually played since 1916. During the Depression of the 1930s, several communities, principally in the South, decided that they could help the local economy by hosting bowl games. The Orange Bowl in Miami and the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans started the rush to season-ending contests and were followed by the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and a host of new bowls after World War II. While most bowls games are financially successful and provide teams with regional or national exposure, they do not produce a national champion. The champion (until 1998) was selected on the basis of end-of-season pools of coaches and sports writers and computer-based ranking systems. In 1998, however, the Bowl Championship Series was established to pick a champion based on direct on-field competition. As structured in 2012, the top ten teams are selected to play in the series. Eight play in four bowl games and the top two play each other for the championship in a national championship game. This approach was also unpopular and in 2013 a new format was introduced in which four teams are selected to play in a two-game elimination playoff. The goal is to produce a champion while also preserving the bowl games.\n\n11\n\nTouchdown.indd 11\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nRacial Integration College teams and professional teams lacked a large number of African American players during the first half of the twentieth century. Southern institutions of higher learning refused to admit blacks until forced to do so by desegregation during the 1960s, and only a few institutions in the North had black students until after World War II. Outstanding players such as Fritz Pollard of Brown and Paul Robeson of Rutgers in the 1910s; Duke Slater (1898–1966) of Iowa and Joe Lillard (1918–1978) of Oregon in the 1920s; Wilmeth Sidat-Singh (1917–1943) of Syracuse and Kenny Washington (1918–1971) of UCLA in the 1930s; and Buddy Young (1926–1983) of Illinois and Marion Motley (1920–1999) of Nevada in the 1940s were exceptions to the rule. Professional football’s first black player was Charles Follis (1879–1910), who in 1904 played for the Shelby Athletic Club in Ohio. Fritz Pollard played pro football after his Brown experience, becoming the first African American head football coach in 1919 when he coached the Akron Pros. Blacks played in the NFL until the “color line” was drawn in 1933. Football remained segregated until the end of World War II, when the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League and the Cleveland Browns of the All-American Football Conference added black players shortly before Jackie Robinson (1917–1972) desegregated professional baseball. The number of black players grew over the years, and in 2011 some 67 percent of NFL players were black. The league also has seen an increase in the number of Latino players. In the twenty-first century, the NFL has received high marks for its efforts at racial integration. At the start of the 2012 season, five head coaches were black, although this was down one from 2011. In addition, 33 percent of assistant coaches were men of color and six of thirty-two general managers were men of color in 2012. The increase in the number of head coaches is at least in part the result of the Rooney Rule instituted in 2002 (named after Pittsburgh Steeler owner Dan Rooney) which requires teams to interview a black candidate for open head-coach positions. The one remaining issue is the low number of black quarterbacks. At the start of 2012 season only four of thirty-two starters were black and an additional two were Latino, down from six blacks in 2011 and a high of eight in 2008. Critics point out that 65 percent of college quarterbacks are black, suggesting that some consideration other than ability is behind the low percentage of professional black quarterbacks.\n\nTelevision and Football The introduction of television dramatically affected college and pro football after World War II. Football games were first telecast in the autumn of 1939, but another decade passed before the cable required to carry signals spread from the East Coast as far west as Chicago. By about 1950 the growth of television made commercial telecasts of sport contests profitable. Colleges were concerned that telecasts would have a negative impact on attendance at stadiums, and in 1951 members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) decided to control the number of telecasts of their football games. From 1951 to 1984 the NCAA plan provided for national and regional telecasts each Saturday during the season. 12\n\nTouchdown.indd 12\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter One: American Football\n\nThis monopoly existed first to limit games on TV and to preserve gate receipts. Later, when the NCAA contract with television networks was worth more than $65 million per year, receiving television revenues became more important to big-time colleges than preserving stadium attendance. A power struggle erupted between the smaller NCAA institutions and those that had regular game telecasts. The smaller institutions, demanding a greater percentage of television funds, helped spur the creation of the College Football Association (CFA). The CFA was created in 1976 to promote big-time football. Within five years the CFA helped sponsor a legal suit against the NCAA by the University of Oklahoma and University of Georgia to break up the NCAA football TV monopoly. A 1984 US Supreme Court decision went against the NCAA, and colleges were thereafter free to create their own television plans. The result was an oversupply of televised games and lower revenues to most institutions. In the 1990s, it was the conferences rather than individual teams that managed broadcast relations, leading to an expansion of television coverage. As of 2012, college football was broadcast each week on five networks and on satellite and cable outlets as well. College games are shown mainly on Saturday so they do not compete with NFL games on Sunday and during the week. The dominance of the conferences has led to what is called “conference realignment,” meaning that elite teams move from one conference to another, as both the teams and conferences seek to maximize their exposure and revenues. This has led to the distortion of what were once geographically based conferences. Based on the number of fans, the leading conferences in 2011 were the Southeast Conference (SEC), Big-10 (soon to be 14 teams), Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and the Big-12. The leading teams are principally state universities (Florida, Louisiana State, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Oregon), although some private institutions such as Notre Dame and Stanford are highly competitive. The leading team in terms of recent championships is Alabama, which won the national title in the 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2015 seasons. The NFL’s popularity rose greatly after its championship game in 1958, when the Baltimore Colts defeated the New York Giants in a dramatic overtime contest seen by millions on television. During that decade the NFL solution to protect stadium attendance was to prevent televising within a radius of 120 kilometers without permission of the home team. The NFL also decided to pool television money, dividing the TV revenues equally among all the teams. This brilliant decision allowed smaller-market teams, such as the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, to remain financially competitive.\n\nThe Super Bowl and the AFL The Super Bowl, which evolved into an unofficial national holiday, has had some of the highest ratings in television history, easily surpassing baseball’s World Series in popularity. The NFL introduced Monday Night Football to supplement the traditional Sunday games beginning in 1970. “Prime time” evening football was the creation of the NFL’s commissioner, Pete Rozelle (1926–1996), and the innovative Roone Arledge (1931–2002) of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). For two decades, “Monday Night Football” surpassed all regular televised sporting events in popularity. 13\n\nTouchdown.indd 13\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nCompetition from a new league also had an impact on professional football. Lamar Hunt (1932–2006), disgruntled at being unable to purchase an NFL franchise, in 1960 decided to form the American Football League (AFL), which soon received a multimillion-dollar television contract from the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC). With the signing of star college players such as Joe Namath (b. 1943) of Alabama, the AFL received recognition, and in 1966 the NFL, which fought the AFL, accepted a merger of the two leagues. The merger, under the NFL name, became official as a twenty-six-team league in 1970. A playoff between the NFL and AFL beginning in 1967 added excitement and created greater wealth. The championship was called the “Super Bowl,” and Green Bay won the first two contests. A recent Super Bowl, Super Bowl XLVII, nicknamed the Harbaugh Bowl for the fact that the two opposing teams were coached by brothers, saw the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens narrowly defeat the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers 34-31. Professional football’s increase in wealth from television has spurred both new labor disputes and competing leagues. Players formed the National Football League Players Association in 1956, but the union was not recognized by NFL owners until 1968. A desire for a larger share of the profits eventually led to several players’ strikes and lockouts between 1968 and 2011. New football leagues, also looking at the growing wealth in the professional game, were formed. The World Football League lasted only one season in the mid-1970s. Eight years later the United States Football League (USFL) began as a spring sport in 1983. The March-to-July schedule did not conflict with that of the stronger NFL for a television audience, but the USFL survived for only three years because of low television ratings. Three years later, the NFL established the World League of American Football (WLAF) with teams in Europe and North America. The league did not survive but the NFL remains interested in placing a team in Europe and toward that end schedules one regular season game between NFL games in Europe each season. The WLAF acts like a farm system for the NFL and expanded the college football feeder system that has existed for much of the century. As of 2016, the NFL consists of thirty-two teams, all individually owned (the NFL prohibits corporate ownership) except for the still-publicly owned Green Bay Packers.\n\nInjuries and the Future A major issue facing the NFL and football at all levels in the early twenty-first century is concussions, and especially the long term effects of concussions on former players’ well-being. Concussions are nothing new in football (or sports like soccer and ice hockey) but were never taken very seriously, with “having your bell rung” part of the game and players returning to action as soon as their vision cleared. It became a major issue first when anecdotal evidence and then medical research indicated that some former professional players suffered from depression, suicide, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease at a higher rate than the general population. Although a direct link has yet to be established, the medical establishment and the players believe that these problems are the result of concussions suffered while playing football. 14\n\nTouchdown.indd 14\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter One: American Football\n\nEast Carolina running back Brandon Fractious eludes US Naval Academy defenders during a football game in Annapolis, Maryland, in September 2006. US Navy photo by Damon J. Moritz. National Archives.\n\nThe problem is not just a single concussion but multiple concussions, and concussions suffered before a player has fully recovered from a previous one. The NFL has been hesitant to accept a link between concussions and later neurological problems, although it has taken steps to control the problem with new rules on when a concussed player can return to play, penalties for hits like helmet-to-helmet tackles that cause concussions, and funding for medical research. The former players remain unsatisfied and in 2012 over two-thousand of them joined in a suit against the NFL, charging that the league ignored the problem and hid information it had from their players, thereby putting them at risk. Concussions are an issue across football at all levels of play, with one estimate suggesting that 75 percent of players suffer at least one concussion. The long-term effects of concussions in young players are not well-understood. This issue is especially critical in light of the bounty scandal in 2012, where players were paid bonuses if they were able to injure an opposing team’s quarterback enough to take him out of the game. Higher monetary prizes were awarded if the targeted quarterback had to sit out the rest of the season. (Please see the chapter “Concussions” for more details.) Despite the challenges and criticism of college and professional football in the United States, the game continues to grow. Football still fills stadiums from 70,000 to over 100,000 spectators, and it draws the largest television audiences, producing more income than any other sport, collegiate or professional. This suggests that football will continue to dominate sport in the United States into the foreseeable future. 15\n\nTouchdown.indd 15\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nFurther Reading Baker, L.

INGRASSIA West Texas A&M University\n\nAmerican “gridiron” football began as an intercollegiate game in the 1800s and soon became a popular spectacle. Marred by fatalities and scandals, college football was reformed and regulated as part of early-1900s America’s “Progressive Era.” But by the 1920s, college football had become a quasi-professional activity. The game continued to commercialize after World War II, when American society underwent a period of social and cultural turmoil. Today, college football is big business with a prominent economic and media presence in American life. Keywords: athletic conferences, NCAA, race, ethnicity, television, commercialism, scandal, reforms, Native American mascots\n\nA\n\nmerican intercollegiate football originated in the 1800s. Virtually since the first contests, the game has existed in a precarious space between amateurism and professionalism. The history of college football is as filled with controversies, scandals, and reforms as it is with star players, coaches, and stadiums packed on Saturday afternoons. Nowhere else in the world has a nation created a commercialized sporting spectacle so thoroughly entrenched in the culture and structure of higher education.\n\nCollege Football’s Emergence Before the Civil War, students at colleges in the Northeast played inter-class rivalry ballgames that could be particularly violent and disorderly. But after the war, enhanced transportation networks—especially the development of railways— encouraged athletic competition between colleges. America’s first intercollegiate football game took place just four years after the end of the conflict. On 6 November 1869, the College of New Jersey (present-day Princeton University) squared off against Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with Rutgers winning, 6-4. The game then started to gain popularity in the region, although it did not yet resemble the rationalized sport that became widespread in the 1890s. In 1874, Harvard University played a football series against Montreal’s McGill University. Since the two schools played by different rules, they agreed to contest 19\n\nTouchdown.indd 19\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nsome matches under rugby rules (as played in Canada). Afterward, Harvard students adopted rugby and convinced other colleges in New England to do the same. But in the early 1880s, the game went through a fundamental transformation. Walter Camp (1859–1925), a student and football player at Yale University in the industrial city of New Haven, Connecticut, introduced rules innovations that eventually transformed the game into the one familiar today as American football. Hoping to make the game more efficient, Camp reduced the number of men on each team from fifteen to eleven. He also suggested a rule whereby a player could stop play by setting the ball down on the ground—after which play started over again. Camp, who would later serve as president of a clock company, was essentially creating a rationalized version of football that resembled late-1800s industrial production. Additional changes ensued. Subsequently, play started at the “line of scrimmage“ (replacing the rugby “scrum”) and players were granted three chances (later four) to move the ball down the field. These units of scoring production became known as “downs.” Subsequently, yardage lines were added to the field and games were timed. These innovations allowed progress toward the goal to be measured, as well as for each game’s duration to be regulated. The resulting markings on the field led to it being dubbed the “gridiron.” For his efforts, Walter Camp became known as the “Father of American Football” (Smith 1988). By the early 1890s, college football was becoming popular throughout America. The most well-known athletic powers at this time were in the Northeast, where football originated. Harvard, Yale, and Princeton drew the biggest crowds and headlines. But the game was spreading. In the Midwest, the Universities of Michigan and Chicago pioneered big-time football. Chicago was led by famed coach Amos Alonzo Stagg (1862–1965). Stagg was the nation’s first tenured professor of physical education, with coaching and administrative duties that approximated those of modern athletic directors. His position represented the close ties that would develop between institutions of higher education and their athletic teams. Meanwhile, on the West Coast, Stanford University and the University of California (both located in the San Francisco Bay Area), started playing their annual “Big Game” rivalry match in March 1892. While students frequently initiated the contests, in some cases professors introduced football and even served as coaches. The first major football contest in the South was played in early 1892 in Atlanta, Georgia, between the University of Georgia and Auburn University of Alabama. Atlanta, a growing industrial and commercial hub for the post-Civil War “New South,” was a convenient midpoint between the two schools. The two coaches in this game were an Auburn history professor and a Georgia chemistry professor, both of whom had earned their graduate degrees at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. After 1900, college football began to transcend regionalism. In 1902, the southern California town of Pasadena hosted a game in conjunction with its Tournament of Roses festival. Michigan defeated Stanford in a championship contest that would become known as the annual “Rose Bowl.”\n\nProgressive Era Controversies and Reforms Football was growing in popularity at the turn of the century, but it was also becoming problematic. For one thing, the game was dangerous for the human body. The 20\n\nTouchdown.indd 20\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter Two: College Football\n\nnew rules that Camp introduced in the 1880s had created a game that replaced rugby’s apparent disorder with seemingly “scientific” precision. Now, teams rushed down the field in precise offensive formations such as the dangerous “flying wedge.” These so-called “mass plays” facilitated scoring, but were also deadly. Players were frequently injured on the field in an era before helmets or padding. A notorious case was that of Georgia’s Richard “Von” Gammon (1879–1897). The seventeen-year-old fullback suffered a spinal injury in a game played against the University of Virginia in Atlanta in 1897. The state of Georgia nearly banned intercollegiate football in the wake of Gammon’s death. But the game was saved when Georgia’s governor vetoed the bill, explaining that America needed strenuous games to instill “manly” virtue in citizens (Ingrassia 2012). Football also seemed to pose a danger to public morality—as well as to the effectiveness or prestige of the nation’s universities. Football seemed to be teaching college-age men—most of whom were middle or upper-class whites who would become political or economic leaders after graduation—to engage in dishonest or apparently immoral practices. For instance, gambling was becoming a growing concern among the young, middle-class men who flocked to turn-of-the-century colleges. Additional concerns regarded issues of player eligibility. Squads would often pay men who were not full-time students—or may not have been students at all—to suit up for intercollegiate games. These semi-professional athletes seemed to discredit the higher education institutions that were growing larger, developing graduate and professional programs, and becoming an essential part of American society. Some university leaders began speaking out against football. Most notably, Charles William Eliot (1834–1926), president of Harvard and himself a former rower, wrote a scathing critique of football in 1894 and proposed alterations that would presumably limit the game’s commercial appeal and its potential dangers. Some saw Eliot’s charges as a threat to ban football. Some critics agreed, yet others resisted calls for abolition. Stanford’s president, David Starr Jordan, for example, said that football was a strenuous game that bolstered players’ manhood. Such defenses, though, would be stretched to their limits by 1905 (Ingrassia 2012). For many Americans, football was strictly an amateur, collegiate game played by white men. This was one reason why potential damage to players’ minds and morals seemed so dangerous to those who saw colleges as conduits of Anglo-Saxon culture. Yet non-whites were also playing college football. New England colleges, including Amherst College and Harvard, featured African American players by the late 1880s and early 1890s. Historically black colleges and universities (“HBCU”s) also fielded football teams. For leaders of black schools such as Tuskegee Institute in Alabama or Atlanta University in Georgia, football prowess was a way to prove that African Americans were just as civilized and “scientific” as white Americans in their pursuit of education and sport. As football became more popular, accounts of games were reported in the many daily newspapers that proliferated in turn-of-the-century America. As the scholar Michael Oriard (1993) has shown, many American readers learned about football through popular periodicals. Magazines and newspapers reported widely on the sport, providing a window onto the era’s ideas about gender and race relations. For example, athletes of the Carlisle Indian School, a western Pennsylvania boarding school for Native American children displaced by western Indian Wars, were scrutinized in daily newspapers when they squared off against white teams. 21\n\nTouchdown.indd 21\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nOne famous such contest was a 1912 game between Carlisle—which included Jim Thorpe (1887–1953), an athlete who later became legendary for winning multiple gold medals at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics—and the US Military at West Point, which featured future World War II general and US President Dwight Eisenhower (1890–1969). The Carlisle “Indians” were sometimes portrayed in newspapers more as anthropological specimens than as football players. The period when football emerged is frequently known as the Gilded Age, a time when American industries and cities grew quickly and attracted millions of immigrants from overseas, especially from Europe. This period was followed by the so-called Progressive Era (circa 1890s–1910s) when many middle-class reformers sought to alleviate the problems of urban-industrial society; progressive-minded Americans even borrowed ideas from European nations or their imperial holdings as they tried to improve modern society. Progressive reforms included outlawing of child labor, passage of pure food and drug laws, and electoral innovations such as the “Australian” (secret) ballot. College football also underwent a period of Progressive Era reform. One early attempt to regulate the game was the regional athletic conference—a group of similar colleges in bordering states who banded together to create common rules governing athletics. In 1896, representatives from seven Midwestern universities (located in the Great-Lakes states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) met in Chicago to found the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives. After additional members (from Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio) were added by 1912, this organization was called the “Big Ten.” The Big Ten did provide oversight for regional intercollegiate athletics—and the resulting ticket sales—but it and similar organizations could not eliminate all of college football’s problems. As multiple historians have noted (such as Watterson 2000, Smith 2011, Ingrassia 2012), football underwent a significant period of reform starting around 1905. That year, progressive journalists—then often pejoratively referred to as “muckrakers”—attacked the game’s corruption. Meanwhile, progressive Republican President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) held a White House meeting in which he ordered representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton to reform the sport. In November, widely publicized incidents, including the fatal injury of a player in a game contested in New York City, prompted nationwide reforms. Henry M. MacCracken (1840–1918), the chancellor of New York University—who worried about injuries to players as well as the potential damage to the reputation of American higher education—convened a meeting in New York to discuss football’s potential abolition or alteration. This convention resulted in the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, which was renamed the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) by 1910. At this time, the NCAA was merely an advisory body, although by the 1950s it would assume broader regulatory roles. The NCAA’s first major intervention was to form a committee that proposed new football rules. In particular, the committee recommended legalization of the forward pass and the placement of more officials on the field. The forward pass— throwing the ball downfield past the line of scrimmage—added a vertical dimension to play that reflected the verticality that aircraft were then beginning to add to modern transportation. The forward pass was intended to create an “open” style of play that would presumably make the game safer for players’ bodies and more 22\n\nTouchdown.indd 22\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter Two: College Football\n\nentertaining for spectators, while also enabling officials to better see and punish violent or unethical play. Additional changes occurred in the next few years, but by the late 1910s football had essentially taken its modern form. Some universities even constructed steel-reinforced concrete stadiums in this decade, including Harvard Stadium (1903), the Yale Bowl (1914), and Princeton’s Palmer Stadium (1914). These arenas represented the Progressive Era desire to build sturdy, fireproof structures to safely accommodate large public gatherings. Not everyone embraced these reforms. As biographer Julie Des Jardins (2015) has noted, Walter Camp disliked the forward pass, largely because it reintroduced an element of chance that he had sought to eliminate in the 1880s. Meanwhile, on the West Coast, some universities in California, Nevada, and surrounding states switched to rugby (Park 1984). This constituted the region’s own, distinctive variety of progressive athletic reform. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake devastated the Bay Area, Stanford University even imported athletes from Vancouver and New Zealand to teach their students how to play the unfamiliar game. For nearly a decade, the “Big Game” between Stanford and Berkeley was played as rugby rather than American football. West Coast schools never entirely abandoned rugby, but they did rejoin the national mainstream by returning to standard American football between 1915 and 1918, especially after the United States entered World War I in 1917. Although American society remained harshly segregated in the 1910s, that decade saw the emergence of two prominent black football stars. Frederick Douglass “Fritz” Pollard (1894–1986), named after a famous mid-1800s American abolitionist, played football at Brown University in Rhode Island and was the first black player to appear in the Rose Bowl in 1916. After World War I, Pollard became one of the first African American players (and coaches) in the professional National Football League (NFL). Paul Robeson (1898–1976) played for Rutgers from 1915 to 1919, where he (like Pollard) was an All-American. Later, Robeson went on to a successful career as a prominent singer, actor, and civil rights activist.\n\nFootball Spectacle in the “Roaring Twenties” World War I altered global sporting culture, and college football was no exception. After the war, leather helmets were introduced. Military men who had led wartime squads became college coaches, such as Robert Neyland (1892–1962) at the University of Tennessee and Frank Cavanaugh (1876–1933) at Boston College and then at New York’s Fordham University. Military terminology permeated postwar football. Perhaps the war’s most visible effect was the construction of large concrete football stadiums on campuses. Similar in structure to the 1910s stadiums, many 1920s arenas were built as war memorials, to commemorate the many young men who had fought or died in Europe. So-called memorial stadiums were constructed at the Universities of California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Texas, among others. Even some stadiums not specifically styled as war memorials were built with similar intent. Such stadiums typically seated between 20,000 and 60,000 spectators. These were large venues for the era. By comparison, Yankee Stadium in New York seated 58,000 when it opened in 1923, Los Angeles’s Memorial Coliseum (1923) originally seated 75,000, and Chicago’s Soldier Field (1924) seated over 100,000. 23\n\nTouchdown.indd 23\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nBy the 1920s, college football was a major part of America’s sporting culture. The postwar decade was a time of economic boom, when increasing numbers of Americans purchased consumer goods such as automobiles and radios. Such technologies allowed more Americans to follow both professional and collegiate teams, leading to this era being dubbed the “Golden Age of Sports.” Major sports celebrities included boxer Jack Dempsey (1895–1983) and New York Yankees baseball star Babe Ruth (1895–1948), as well as collegians like Harold “Red” Grange (1903–1991), a talented halfback for the University of Illinois. Grange, also known by colorful nicknames such as the “Galloping Ghost,” gained legendary status with a dominating 1924 performance in one of Illinois’s first games played at its Memorial Stadium and one of its first games broadcast on radio. He also became the first prominent player to leave college early for a professional league, announcing his signing with the NFL’s Chicago Bears at the end of the 1925 season. Grange was criticized widely in the media—and even by his coach—for going pro. His decision, though, made sense. Sportswriters were then helping to make college athletes legendary, such as when Grantland Rice (1880–1954) famously dubbed the University of Notre Dame’s backfield “The Four Horsemen” (a reference to the Biblical apocalypse) in a New York newspaper in 1927. It was only a matter of time before some players started cashing in on their fame. The 1920s also saw the proliferation of athletic departments, led by professional athletic directors, and the continued professionalization of coaching. Salaries rose to a point where some football coaches were the highest paid individuals at their universities. The most famous or ambitious coaches bolstered their authority through publications. The historian Brian Ingrassia (2012) argues that well-known football leaders like John Heisman (1869–1936) of Georgia Tech and Howard Jones (1885–1941) of the University of Iowa published books that stressed their roles as teachers well versed at the art of instilling discipline in college men. Although coaches like Illinois’s Robert Zuppke (1879–1957) were often loath to see their players profit from fame, they seemed not to mind doing so themselves, and often made money from endorsements or other aspects of popular culture. For instance, Notre Dame’s legendary coach Knute Rockne (1888–1931) was flying to Los Angeles to participate in the making of a Hollywood movie when his airplane crashed in a rural Kansas wheat field (Sperber 1993). In football’s early years, university teams did not always have standardized names or mascots. But by the 1920s many universities settled on names or symbols, with some institutions choosing Native American mascots that would become controversial by the late 1900s. Historian Jennifer Guiliano (2015) has shown how Stanford University, Miami University of Ohio, and other schools introduced Indian imagery during the 1920s and 1930s. Perhaps most notoriously, the University of Illinois introduced its “Chief Illiniwek” mascot in 1926. The “Chief” was represented by a (typically white) student who dressed as a Native American and danced at football and basketball halftimes. This tradition ultimately lasted over eight decades until it was banned, due to its offensive nature, by the NCAA. Football was also becoming more popular in southern states in the 1920s. The game had been played in the South since 1892, but it was still seen as a predominately northern game. But in the 1920s—when professional leagues started flourishing in the Northeast and Midwest—southern universities gained more national success and exposure in college football. The University of Alabama made its first 24\n\nTouchdown.indd 24\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter Two: College Football\n\nappearance in the Rose Bowl in 1926, when it defeated the University of Washington. With this and subsequent bowl-game appearances, Alabama showed that southern football could compete against northern schools. Historian Andrew Doyle (2002) notes that “the deluge of sectionalist passion that greeted Alabama’s triumphant Rose Bowl performances reflected the perennial desire of southerners to extract vengeance for the many humiliations they had suffered at the hands of the Yankees” during and after the Civil War. Southerners, in short, could finally boast of having beaten northerners. By 1930, universities in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee formed the Southeastern Conference (SEC), which would become one of America’s major football powers by the end of the twentieth century. By the late 1920s, many educators once again grew concerned that football was too commercialized and was corrupting higher education. In a well-known case, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching launched an investigation into the commercialization of American intercollegiate athletics and published its findings in October 1929, just days before the catastrophic stock market crash that sparked the Great Depression. The modestly titled “Bulletin Number Twenty-Three” was one of the most significant reports the Carnegie Foundation ever published. Widely cited and discussed, this lengthy volume indicated the extent to which colleges paid athletes and overemphasized football to the detriment of academics. It also naively proposed that colleges could revert to an era of amateur football. Historian John Thelin (1994), nevertheless, has argued that the 1929 Carnegie Report “set the standard for reform proposals and policy analyses about the place of intercollegiate sports in American colleges and universities.” In the wake of the report, the Big Ten even briefly suspended the University of Iowa in 1930 when the conference discovered that its athletic department maintained a secret “slush fund” that improperly subsidized athletics (Schmidt 2007). Such subsidies were by no means a new practice—and even paragons like Walter Camp had utilized them at Yale—but they had become controversial by the time of the Carnegie Report.\n\nThe Great Depression Years The Great Depression of the 1930s had a significant effect on college football, causing it to become further ingrained in American life, despite the revelations of the 1929 Carnegie Report. Even though the global economy suffered greatly during the 1930s, many Americans still had enough discretionary income to keep reading newspapers, watching movies, and following their favorite sports teams. In addition, the 1930s was the decade in which some universities started openly granting financial aid to football players. Before the 1930s, under-the-table payments or sham jobs for athletes were not unheard of, yet such practices were scorned and prohibited. But the SEC changed this. For public universities usually located in smaller towns in southern states with large amounts of rural poverty, scholarships were deemed necessary to attract talented players and to give them the support they needed to stay in school. In the 1930s, southern universities also pioneered female “cheerleaders,” a notable shift from the male yell leaders that had been common since the early 1900s. 25\n\nTouchdown.indd 25\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nTouchdown: An American Obsession\n\nFootball was also a way for many immigrants to demonstrate their assimilation to American culture in the years between the world wars. From the mid-1800s until the early 1920s, millions of immigrants flocked to the United States from Europe and Asia, especially the “New Immigrants” (circa 1880–1920) who hailed from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Scandinavia. After Congress passed restrictive federal legislation limiting immigration in 1924, many of the immigrants and their children adapted to American life. A good example of this phenomenon was Bronislau “Bronko” Nagurski (1908–1990), who played for the University of Minnesota from 1927 to 1929 and then later became a professional football player and wrestler in the 1930s and 1940s. Nagurski played at a time when many New Immigrants (or their children) were adopting a pan-ethnic “white” identity. Michael Oriard (2001) even notes that Nagurski was long identified as having Polish ancestry although he was actually Ukrainian. One university that transformed its popularity among an ethnic and religious fan base into athletic fame and fortune was the University of Notre Dame. Located at South Bend, Indiana, not far from Chicago, Notre Dame’s football team first tasted success in the 1910s. By the 1920s, Notre Dame scheduled games in front of 100,000 or more spectators at massive venues like Chicago’s war-memorial Soldier Field. The Catholic school, founded by French missionaries in the 1840s, recruited many students and athletes from America’s Catholic immigrant families. Although the university tried to join the Big Ten multiple times, it was repeatedly rebuffed, likely due to anti-Catholic sentiment, and maintained its independent status. Notre Dame’s highly successful team, known as the “Fighting Irish,” was led from 1918 to 1930 by Norwegian-born Knute Rockne, who later converted to Catholicism. Shortly before Rockne’s death, the university opened its own stadium, a sixty-thousand-seat brick-and-concrete arena located on campus. Football spectacles, known as bowl contests, proliferated in the 1930s as cashstrapped municipalities looked for ways to boost revenue. Cities in temperate locations were inspired by the Rose Bowl to get in on the New Year’s Day bowl-game action. New bowls included the Orange Bowl (Miami, 1935), Sugar Bowl (New Orleans, 1935), Sun Bowl (El Paso, 1935), and Cotton Bowl (Dallas, 1937). Local and regional rivalries also flourished during the Great Depression. In 1932, two Louisiana HBCUs—Grambling State University and Southern University—started playing a rivalry game later dubbed the “Bayou Classic.” In the era of “Jim Crow” segregation that lasted until the 1960s, some of the best African American players participated in this contest. Since 1974 the Grambling-Southern game has been contested in New Orleans, with the exception of 2005, when damage resulting from Hurricane Katrina prompted the game’s relocation to nearby Houston. The 1930s also saw the elimination of big-time intercollegiate athletics at some universities, most famously at the University of Chicago. Chicago was bankrolled by oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller in the 1890s, and when it opened it was a leader in academic scholarship, public outreach, and intercollegiate athletics. But by the 1930s, Chicago’s athletics program had fallen on hard times. The football team played in an outdated stadium and Coach Stagg was not as effective at recruiting star players and winning games as he had been decades earlier. One bright star was the 1935 team led by Jay Berwanger (1914–2002), a halfback from Iowa descended from German immigrants. Berwanger won the first trophy given by New York’s Downtown Athletic Club to the nation’s top collegiate player—an award later renamed the Heisman 26\n\nTouchdown.indd 26\n\n07/05/19 1:24 PM\n\nChapter Two: College Football\n\nTrophy. But after Berwanger graduated, Chicago continued its slide, regularly losing to Big Ten rivals and even faring poorly against small colleges located in rural Illinois or Wisconsin. After 1929 the university’s new president, Robert Maynard Hutchins (1899–1977), took Chicago in a different direction. He instituted a new undergraduate curriculum based on the “Great Books” and deemphasized athletics. Stagg had to retire (due to advanced age) in 1932 and was replaced by an athletic director sympathetic to Hutchins’s views. By 1939, Chicago stopped playing intercollegiate football, and it resigned its Big Ten membership in 1946 (Lester 1995). During World War II, a racquet court under the stands of Chicago’s abandoned Stagg Field stadium was the site of a Manhattan Project laboratory, a place where physicists collaborated to create the atomic weapons that ended the war in the Pacific.\n\nThe Game Transformed after World War II World War II dramatically affected college football. Shortly after the Japanese attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in December 1941, fear of attack on the West Coast prompted the 1942 Rose Bowl game, between Oregon State and Duke Universities, to be moved to Duke Stadium in North Carolina. There were other, more systemic, changes to college football during the war. Due to the shortage of male students, the NCAA began allowing freshmen to play on varsity teams; it also changed rules to allow two-platoon play (which allowed players to specialize on separate offensive and defensive units). Now, players could return to the game after they had been substituted. Even then, some universities chose to suspend or even terminate their football programs due to a lack of players. Yet the game persisted, in part because some military leaders argued that athletics complemented military training. During the 1940s, the service academies (Army at West Point and Navy at Annapolis) assembled some of America’s best football teams. Naval and military stations fielded teams that competed against the best college and university squads. After the war, many older men in their twenties with military experience— inc"
