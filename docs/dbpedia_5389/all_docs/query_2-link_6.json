Ernest Baden Sambidge. 1922-25.\n\nBorn, 7.8.1900, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\n\nDied, 27.11.1979, Knowle, Bristol.\n\n5’ 10”; 12 st.\n\nDébut: 7.9.22 v Newport County.\n\nCareer: St Peter’s Albion; 1919 Walker Celtic; 1920 St Anthony’s Institute; December 1920 Ashington; February 1921 Spennymoor United; 31.5.22 Bristol Rovers [23,0]; 1925 River Tyne Police Force; August 1926 Bath City; 19.8.35 Street (player-manager); 26.9.36 Trowbridge Town (retired, 15.9.37).\n\nManchester City, Sunderland and Middlesbrough were keen to sign left-back Ernie Sambidge, but Eastville was his destination and he appeared for Rovers in three consecutive Third Division (South) campaigns. A naval architect by profession with Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson of Newcastle, he had previously won the Northumberland Senior Cup with Walker Celtic in 1920 and played regularly for Spennymoor in the North-Eastern League in 1921-22. Following an own goal against Exeter City in his final match with Rovers, Sambidge was Bath City’s captain and a regular for many years, scoring a penalty against Rovers in his testimonial game in April 1932. The Romans were Western League First Division champions in 1928-29, Southern League champions the following season and London Combination Division Two winners in 1931-32 and he formed a strong full-back partnership with the former Rovers defender Albert Rotherham. Later in his career, Sambidge played in twenty Somerset Senior League matches with Street, making his début in a 3-0 win at Radstock Town in August 1935, and first appeared for Trowbridge when they lost 3-1 at home to Yeovil and Petters United in September 1936. He played in Trowbridge’s 11-0 victory over Minehead the following month, in the 1936 Somerset Professional Cup Final, which was lost 3-1 to Bath City, and added an own goal against Warminster Town in January 1937 before a smashed knee cap sustained against the same opposition necessitated a premature retirement from the game. The youngest of five children, brought up at 4 Enslin Street, Newcastle, to a shipwright William Sambidge (1867-1937) and his wife Margaret Temple (1865-1946), Ernie Sambidge lived for many years at 539 Wells Road, Knowle with his wife Kate Sophia Phipps (1902-1989), their only son John Baden William Sambidge (1929-90), a six-foot full-back, signing for Rovers from Frome Town in 1950 but not making the first-team.\n\nNo 290. Peter Stanley Sampson. 1948-61.\n\nBorn, 9.7.1927, Great Watering, Essex.\n\nDied, 16.5.2009, Congresbury, Bristol.\n\n5’ 9½”; 11 st.\n\nDébut: 21.8.48 v Ipswich Town.\n\nCareer: Great Watering School; Great Watering; Devizes Town; 28.1.48 Bristol Rovers (professional, June 1948) [340,4]; 5.7.61 Trowbridge Town; August 1963 Oldland (assistant manager; manager, 1964-65; player until 1968).\n\nFollowing Army service in West Africa, wing-half Peter Sampson was a reliable member of the Rovers side for more than a decade. One of only nine players to appear in the League team in three separate decades, he was an ever-present in three consecutive seasons, running up 143 consecutive League appearances which culminated in Rovers’ promotion as Third Division (South) champions in 1952-53. Unquestionably fair and never booked during his entire Rovers career, Sampson epitomised an era of gentlemanly conduct, although he was also a rare non-Bristol-born member of this successful Rovers side. A cousin of Chelsea’s Leslie Stubbs (1929-2011, whose mother Lilian Reynolds was the sister of Sampson’s mother), he was the third child of Clifford Sampson and Kathleen Reynolds and, having contributed 72 goals in one school season, was working as a butcher when he played in Wiltshire’s 7-0 victory over Gloucestershire in 1947. Buying himself out of the Army for £65 to join Rovers in preference to Fulham, he made his reserves’ début at home to Swindon Town reserves three days after signing and his League bow on the opening day of the 1948-49 campaign. That game finished in a disastrous 6-1 home defeat to Ipswich and Sampson was not picked again for eighteen months; when he was, he held on to his place this time for more than a decade. Rare goals followed in third-tier football against Ipswich and Exeter, as well as in Division Two against Blackburn and Rovers’ first strike eleven minutes before half-time in the 6-4 defeat at Swansea on Christmas Day 1957. He also featured in a Football Association XI, which played a Western League XI at Eastville in March 1954. He captained Trowbridge for two seasons before helping Vic Lambden run the Oldland village side. A keen gardener, Sampson had earlier run a poultry business with Lambden, before serving for 29 years until his retirement in 1992 with Dunford Dairies, where he was popularly known as “The Whistling Milkman”. He lived for many years in Cadbury Heath, before moving into a nursing home in Congresbury, suffering latterly from Alzheimer’s.\n\nAndrew Charles Sandell. 2006-07.\n\nBorn, 8.9.1983, Calne, Wiltshire.\n\n5’ 11”; 11 st 9 lbs.\n\nDébut: 5.8.06 v Peterborough United.\n\nCareer: Bristol City (YTS); 2000 Malmesbury Victoria; Melksham Town; 2004 Paulton Rovers; July 2005 Bath City (£1,500); 15.5.06 Bristol Rovers [20+16,3]; 17.8.07 Salisbury City (loan); 31.8.07 Salisbury City (free); 17.11.08 Aldershot Town (loan); 2.1.09 Aldershot Town (free) [29,5]; 30.6.10 Wycombe Wanderers (free) [41+2,7]; 10.10.11 Forest Green Rovers (loan); 10.11.11 Chippenham Town (loan); 28.12.11 Chicago Fire (trial); 6.1.12 Newport County (free) [53+8,4]; 29.5.15 Forest Green Rovers (trial); 7.8.15 Chippenham Town (free); 7.9.18 Melksham Town (loan); 28.5.19 Melksham Town (free); 1.8.20 Paulton Rovers (free).\n\nSeven minutes after his arrival on the pitch as a Rovers débutant substitute, winger Andy Sandell had created a goal and stamped his popularity on the club’s supporters. Impeccably polite, the young Wiltshire man shook hands with players from both sides prior to kick-off and was in Rovers’ squad as the side reached the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy Final in April 2007 and sealed promotion to League One at Wembley the following month, scoring in the home fixtures with Grimsby, Walsall and Torquay. Previously top scorer as Paulton Rovers were promoted to the Southern League in 2004-05, he was sent off along with Jonathan Bass, another former Rovers player, in Salisbury’s 3-1 home defeat against Altrincham in October 2008 and played against Rovers for both Aldershot and Wycombe, the former in the League Cup and the latter in League Two. The son of Glyn Sandell and Nichola Pritchard, who married in Cirencester in 1978, he scored eight times in 48(+1) Conference games with Salisbury, seven times in 54(+5) Conference and League matches with Aldershot, whom he helped regain Football League status in 2009, and played three times at Forest Green and six times with Chippenham. His ten goals in 52 Conference matches at Newport included a red card after scoring in the 2-2 draw at Stockport in February 2012 and Sandell contrived to score for both sides in the space of three minutes when Newport won 4-2 at Telford in September 2012. In May 2013 he appeared at Wembley as two late goals defeated Wrexham in the play-off final and enabled Newport County to return to the Football League after an absence of twenty-five years. Having arrived there, Sandell’s forty-first-minute left-footed penalty sent Steve Mildenhall the wrong way and condemned Rovers to a 1-0 defeat on their August 2013 visit to Rodney Parade; he was booked as Rovers won the return game 3-1 in January 2014. At Hartlepool that February he conceded an own goal in a heavy defeat and he was sent off in the 2-2 draw on the same pitch in November 2014. Sandell was Chippenham Town’s divisional top scorer in 2015-16 with eighteen goals in 36(+3) Southern League matches for Chippenham and, in finishing again as the divisional top scorer in 2016-17 with 27 goals (nine penalties) in 42 matches as his side won the title, scored a second-half hat-trick as Hayes and Yeading United were defeated 3-0 on Bonfire Night 2016. He was sent off in the game away to Truro City in September 2017 and scored a hat-trick in the 4-4 draw at Wealdstone in April 2018, contributing twelve goals in 30(+9) matches. A loan spell at Melksham produced three Evo-Stik South League appearances and one goal, and he later played five times with Paulkton Rovers.\n\nNo 839. Alefe Santos-d'Adabia. 2012-14.\n\nBorn, 1.3.1995, São Paulo, Brazil.\n\n5’ 8”; 8 st 11 lbs.\n\nDébut: 20.11.12 v Port Vale.\n\nCareer: Henbury Boys; 2009 Stoke City; 2010 Southampton (trial); 19.3.11 Bristol Rovers (professional, 18.4.13) [7+17,1]; 1.7.14 Derby County; 9.1.15 Notts County (loan) [1+2,0]; 10.11.16 Eastleigh (loan); 25.7.17 Yeovil Town (free) [21+10,0]; 4.7.19 Aldershot Town (free); 31.8.20 Weymouth (free); 21.6.21 Chippenham Town (free).\n\nMaking his Under-18 début as a substitute for James Dale against Yeovil Town Under-18 side in April 2011, Brazilian-born and from 2007 Southmead-raised winger Alefe Santos scored five times in 25(+5) games for that side, his only goal in 2012-13 being a delightfully-curled shot five minutes before half-time against Torquay United in October 2012, and featured in the pre-season friendly at Frome Town in July 2012, before being called up for Rovers’ fixture at Vale Park in November 2012. As Rovers capitulated to a 4-0 defeat, Tom Pope scoring a hat-trick, one bright ray of hope from the game was Santos’ performance as a sixtieth-minute replacement for Fabian Broghammer. In addition, “Alfie” was a major figure in the Rovers Under-18 side which secured the league and cup double in 2012-13 and, “fearless in his approach” (James McNamara), he began to play a more pivotal rôle in Rovers’ League side as the following campaign opened, his first full game coinciding with the opening victory of the season, 3-2 at home to York City, in which his header set up John-Joe O’Toole’s winning goal. His only goal for the club duly followed, an equaliser six minutes from time at Mansfield, with a left-foot shot from the right side of the box which deflected home off Antiguan Keiran Murtagh. However, Rovers meekly surrendered their Football League status at the end of a disappointing campaign. Santos played in Derby’s League Cup fixture against Charlton Athletic in August 2014 but, unable to break into their side over two seasons, went to Notts County on loan, only for that club to be relegated to League Two. Alongside David Pipe at Eastleigh, he appeared in 1(+3) Conference matches with the Spitfires before, having appeared in pre-season against Rovers, he made his Glovers’ League bow in the crushing 8-2 defeat at Luton Town on the opening day of the 2017-18 campaign. Yeovil were relegated from League Two the following season, ending a sixteen-year stay in the Football League, Santos playing against Carlisle United at Huish Park in their final League match and he later scored twice in 15(+11) Conference matches with Aldershot and played in 2(+4) matches with Weymouth in the same division and his five goals in 30(+5) National League South matches for Chippenham included a brace against St Albans City in January 2022, helping his side to the play-offs, where they lost to Ebbsfleet United. Santos played against Rovers in a pre-season friendly in July 2022. He was an unused substitute as Chippenham lost to League One Lincoln City in the FA Cup in Novemnber 2022.\n\nNo 963. Harvey Read Saunders. 2021-23\n\nBorn, 20.7.1997, Wolverhampton.\n\n5' 10\"; 10 st 12 lbs.\n\nDébut: 7.8.21 v Mansfield Town.\n\nCareer: Staindrop Primary School; 2004 Barnard Castle (to 2012); August 2014 Darlington Railway Athletic; 12.9.15 Bishop Auckland; 30.11.15 Durham City; 19.1.16 Darlington (free); 28.7.16 Ryhope Colliery Welfare (loan); 19.11.16 Dunston UTS (loan); 16.1.19 Fleetwood Town (free) [6+21,3]; 16.1.19 Darlington (loan); 22.4.21 Hartlepool United (loan); 25.6.21 Bristol Rovers (free) [10+11,2]. 17.1.23 Tranmere Rovers.\n\n\"Rooster\" Saunders, the elder son of Jonathan and Lynn Saunders of Staindrop, grew up in the north-east of England and worked his way through non-league channels until his Football League breakthrough arrived. Despite scoring two hat-tricks at Darlington Railway athletic, he resorted to working at an Indian restaurant, Spice Island, and also at Mangobean in Darlington, playing rugby locally and gaining a black belt at Taekwondo. Scoring his first goal for Durham in January 2016 in a 3-2 victory at Ashington, he made his first appearance for Darlington in a 2-1 defeat against Nuneaton Borough twelve months later. As a team-mate at times of Alex Henshall, the former Rovers winger, Saunders totalled 76 games and twelve goals with Darlington in the National League North as well as a hat-trick in a Durham Challenge Cup tie. The Fleetwood Development Squad benefitted from his hat-tricks against Wigan Athletic in April 2019 and Tranmere Rovers in November 2019. Finally breaking into the Football League with Fleetwood, he scored his first League goal in a 2-1 defeat at Rochdale in October 2020, the month he contributed a hat-trick in a Football League Trophy game against Aston Villa Under-21. He scored twice in October 2020 against champions-elect Hull City and came on as a substitute for Kyle Vassell after sixty-six minutes of the goalless draw with Rovers in February 2021. One Football League Trophy tie in September 2020 saw Saunders score twice, as Carlisle, featuring Rovers names in Nick Anderton and Gavin Reilly lost 3-1 at home to Paul Coutts and Saunders in a victorious Fleetwood side. After two Conference games on loan at Hartlepool, Harvey Saunders signed for Rovers ahead of the 2021-22 campaign. He headed home from Harry Anderson’s cross against Oldham Athletic and scored from Luke Thomas’ through ball against Carlisle United, but suffered an ankle ligament injury at Bradfiord City in October 2021, then broke his hand in training before he could return to the side in January 2022. Sporadic appearances followed and he was an unused substitute on the final day as Rovers secured a dramatic promotion to League One.\n\nNo 556. Carl Stephen Saunders. 1989-93.\n\nBorn,b 26.11.1964, Marston Green.\n\n5’ 8”; 10 st 12 lbs.\n\nDébut: 10.2.90 v Preston North End.\n\nCareer: March 1983 Stoke City (professional, 12.7.83) [130+34,23]; 2.2.90 Bristol Rovers (£70,000) [123+19,42]; 23.12.93 Oxford United [5,0]; 11.2.94 Walsall (trial) [1+1,0]; 24.3.94 Middlesbrough; August 1994 Sliema Wanderers, Malta; July 1995 Hibernians, Malta; 13.9.95 Merthyr Tydfil; 23.10.95 Forest Green Rovers; 20.12.95 Bridgnorth Town; 8.7.96 Mangotsfield United (coach, 30.8.97); Lebeq Tavern.\n\nAs Rovers surged to the top of the table and secured the Third Division title in May 1990, Carl Saunders’ rôle cannot be underestimated. A mid-season signing, he reinvigorated Rovers’ attack and his hat-trick in the 6-1 win over Wigan Athletic in March 1990, the largest win of a hugely successful campaign, signified his intent. These three goals, after nine, 46 and 76 minutes and all with his right foot, ensured that the friendly front man had won the popular support of the Twerton crowd. When the season closed with the Leyland Daf Cup Final, Saunders struck a post with a fierce drive beneath the celebrated twin towers at Wembley, Rovers losing 2-1 to Tranmere. Neatly established back in second-tier football, he was the club’s top scorer in both 1990-91 and 1991-92 as well as Player of the Year in the latter campaign, scored in both FA Cup-ties against Liverpool in 1992 and was still with Rovers when relegation back to Division Three was endured in the spring of 1993. In January 1992 he managed to score four goals in just twenty-seven minutes as Plymouth were destroyed 5-0 at Twerton Park in the FA Cup. On the same ground the previous May he had received the fastest red card in Rovers’ history, sent off in the third minute for an elbow to the face of West Brom’s Paul Raven. Beloved at Twerton Park as “Billy Ocean” in deference to his perceived likeness to a contemporary pop star, Saunders could apparently turn a game with his goal-scoring prowess. Previously top scorer at Stoke in 1986-87, “Spider” Saunders made his Oxford début against Middlesbrough on New Year’s Day 1994 and later appeared in the UEFA Cup whilst with the Maltese side Hibernians, having been top scorer in the Maltese Premier League with eighteen goals in just seventeen matches for Sliema. Saunders played in six Beazer Homes League games with Merthyr, scored six goals in 19(+1) matches in the same division with Bridgnorth, his tally including a brace in the 3-0 victory at Evesham United over Easter 1996 and scored against Tonbridge Angels in his 5(+2) appearances for Forest Green. Related to several members of the Birmingham basketball squad, Carl Saunders has worked closely with Rovers through his years as a social services support worker and as a police community liaison officer based in Bath and was at Wembley for Rovers’ play-off final in May 2007. On the management board for the St Paul’s Carnival, he is heavily involved in “Kick out Racism” events and works as a consultant with a public relations company, E-com Media.\n\nNo 712. David Thomas Savage. 2003-05.\n\nBorn, 30.7.1973, Dublin.\n\n5’ 11”; 11 st 8 lbs.\n\nDébut: 9.8.03 v Scunthorpe United.\n\nCareer: Greenford United; 1.8.90 Kilkenny City [20,1]; 5.3.91 Brighton; 1.5.92 Longford Town (free) [60,8]; 27.5.94 Millwall (£15,000) [105+28,6]; 7.10.98 Northampton Town (£80,000) [98+15,18]; 7.8.01 Oxford United (free) [85,5]; 1.7.03 Bristol Rovers (free) [58+7,3]; 1.7.05 Rushden and Diamonds (free) [30+2,2]; 14.6.07 Brackley Town (player-coach, 7.7.08); 3.10.08 Oxford City (free) (retired, 19.5.11).\n\nConstructive and efficient in midfield, Dave Savage spent two seasons at the heart of the Rovers side, as the team attempted to establish itself in the basement division. His left-footed goal at the Reynolds Arena put Rovers two goals ahead en route to a 4-0 victory in October 2003 and he had an eventful game at Southend that December, scoring after sixteen minutes before conceding one of two penalties the Shrimpers missed as Rovers won 1-0. Working under Ian Atkins at both Northampton and Rovers, he was also one of two Rovers players sent off before half-time in the 2-2 draw with Yeovil Town in October 2004. Dave Savage had made his Millwall début in a 3-1 victory over Southend in August 1994, suffered relegation with the Lions but also enjoyed cup victories over Chelsea and Arsenal. A team-mate of Carl Heggs at Northampton, he endured relegation in 1998-99 and promotion back up to Division Two the following campaign. His consistent club form earned five full caps for the Republic of Ireland, three as substitute and all within the space of three weeks, playing against Portugal, Croatia, USA, Mexico and Bolivia during the close season in 1996. He had played against Rovers for Millwall, Northampton and Oxford prior to his arrival at the Memorial Stadium, scoring a thirteenth-minute penalty when Northampton defeated Rovers 2-1 in March 2001. Leaving Rovers in a bid to be nearer his family, Savage appeared for Rushden against Rovers as his new club dropped out of the Football League in 2005-06 and he added to his League career with one goal in 25(+10) Conference games before playing in fifty matches at Brackley and adding ten goals in 110 Southern League games for Oxford City. Dave Savage is married to Jackie with two children, Megan and Éireann and, retiring with knee and ankle problems, worked as a bricklayer in Northampton before accepting work at a Northamptonshire branch of B and Q.\n\nNo 788. Gary Dean Sawyer. 2010-12.\n\nBorn, 5.7.1985, Bideford, Devon.\n\n6’; 11 st 8 lbs.\n\nDébut: 7.8.10 v Peterborough United.\n\nCareer: 2002 Plymouth Argyle (professional, 1.7.04); 2003 Weymouth (loan); 11.8.04 Exeter City (free); 15.7.06 Plymouth Argyle (free); 25.3.10 Bristol City (loan) [2,0]; 30.6.10 Bristol Rovers (free) [60+1,0]; 13.5.12 Orient (free) [62+7,1]; 25.6.15 Plymouth Argyle (free; retired, 6.5.21) [255+11,6]; 1.8.21 Park United (free).\n\n“Young and energetic”, Gary Sawyer was at Plymouth with his younger brother Sam, who headed a pre-season goal in July 2011 when Rovers won 5-2 at Salisbury City. Gary Sawyer’s August 2006 League début was as a substitute against Colchester United and, a talented right-back, he was the Pilgrims’ Young Player of the Year for 2006-07 and registered his first League goal after 68 minutes when Colchester were defeated 4-1 at Home Park in March 2008. To one match for Weymouth and two goals in 53(+8) Conference games at Exeter can be added a pair of FA Cup-ties against Manchester United, as Sawyer marked Cristiano Ronaldo in the goalless draw at Old Trafford before losing the replay narrowly, and he played for Bristol City against Derby and Blackpool. An interesting 2010-11 season with Rovers saw Sawyer sent off after seventy minutes of the goalless draw with Brentford, set up Jo Kuffour’s first goal in the 6-3 Johnstone’s Paint Trophy win at Wycombe and concede two penalties in the 4-0 defeat at Carlisle, Rovers suffering relegation to League Two. Missing much of the 2011-12 season with a hernia and later a hamstring injury, Gary Sawyer moved on to Orient in the Olympic summer of 2012, scoring his only goal for the Brisbane Road club nine minutes from the end of a 2-0 home victory over MK Dons in April 2013. He was an unused substitute as Orient lost to Rotherham United on penalties in the May 2014 League One play-off final at Wembley; twelve months later, they were relegated to League Two and he played in both League fixtures against Rovers in 2015-16, Sawyer playing at Wembley as Argyle lost their League Two play-off final to two late goals from Wimbledon. The following campaign he enjoyed a promotion year with Argyle, although dropped points on the final day at Grimsby prevented his side from lifting the League Two title, but then began the 2017-18 campaign with an opening day own goal at Peterborough before playing against Rovers on several occasions with Posh and Argyle. Playing alongside the former Rovers youth goalkeeper Matt Macey, he captained the Plymouth side which drew 2-2 with Rovers at Home Park in March 2019; that point appeared to put Argyle on the path to safety, but a disastrous set of results saw them relegated to League Two on the final day of the season. He was in the Argyle side which Rovers knocked out of the FA Cup after a replay, but was sent off in two February 2020 matches, at home to Newport County and away to Bradford City, before retiring in 2021 with an ankle injury. He is the son of Antony Sawyer and Daphne Ilsley, who married in Middlesex in 1981.\n\nNo 509. John Robert Scales. 1985-87.\n\nBorn, 4.7.1966, Harrogate.\n\n6’ 2”; 12 st 7 lbs.\n\nDébut: 7.9.85 v Newport County.\n\nCareer: 1978-83 Rossett School; 6.8.84 Leeds United; 11.7.85 Bristol Rovers (free) [68+4,2]; 16.7.87 Wimbledon (£75,000) [235+5,11]; 31.8.94 Liverpool (£3,500,000) [65,2]; 9.12.96 Tottenham Hotspur (£2,600,000) [29+4,0]; 5.7.00 Ipswich Town [2,0] (released, 20.4.01).\n\nTeenage heartthrob John Scales metamorphosed into an England international defender who commanded vast transfer fees in a successful career. Rejected by Leeds, he made his début for Rovers’ reserve side in an 8-0 thrashing at Birmingham City in August 1985 and his first season with Rovers culminated in a goal over Easter against Bristol City. Noted for his “whole-hearted approach and steady defending” (Don Veale), Scales nonetheless scored for the reserves in a 5-2 defeat at QPR in August 1986 and his excellent twenty-five-yard goal at home to Chester City in April 1987 sealed a 3-2 victory which helped ensure Rovers’ survival from relegation after a gruelling season. Reliable and dependable, Scales moved on from Rovers in 1987, from which point a solid and popular defender turned into a hugely successful one. The youngest of three children to Robert Scales and Jane Mills, he won FA Cup and League Cup winners’ medals, played for three top-flight clubs and won three full caps for England. No one had predicted Wimbledon had any chance against hot favourites Liverpool at Wembley in May 1988, yet “the plodders of Plough Lane … the purveyors of the big punt” (The Scotsman) upset the footballing elite by winning the FA Cup Final; Scales took to the field after 63 minutes to replace Terry Gibson, shortly after Dave Beasant had saved John Aldridge’s penalty and in time to witness Peter Beardsley’s disallowed “goal” and Lawrie Sanchez heading home the only goal of an astonishing game. Club Player of the Year in 1988-89 and sent off at Coventry in September 1990, Scales was a major factor in Wimbledon’s on-going success and it was, ironically, Liverpool he next joined for an astronomical fee, returning to Wembley for the 1995 League Cup Final, a 2-1 victory over Bolton Wanderers, and the 1996 FA Cup Final, which was lost 1-0 to Manchester United. By this stage, having scored for England “B” against Northern Ireland in 1993-94, he had won three caps, first playing for England in the 2-1 victory over Japan at Wembley in June 1995. Joining Spurs in preference to Leeds, he made his début in the 2-0 reserve victory over Swansea reserves and played in December 1996 against Rovers reserves. His only Spurs goal came against his former club Liverpool in November 1998, but Scales’ time at White Hart Lane was fraught with injuries, notably a fractured cheek-bone suffered in the 4-0 defeat at Coventry in December 1997. John Scales, who lives with his wife Lisa and daughter Mabel Rose in Wimbledon, set up an international sports licensing and merchandising agency, is the company chairman of “Be Sport”, an organisation which specialises in school sports events, and coached the England beach soccer side at the 2007 Danone Nations Cup.\n\nNo 552. Anthony John Sealy. 1989-91.\n\nBorn, 7.5.1959, Hackney.\n\n5’ 8”; 11 st 8 lbs.\n\nDébut: 16.9.89 v Preston North End.\n\nCareer: Wallsend Boys’ Club; Southampton (professional, May 1977) [2+5,0]; 29.3.79 Crystal Palace (free) [16+8,5]; February 1980 Port Vale (loan); 12.3.81 Queen’s Park Rangers (£75,000) [57+6,18]; February 1982 Port Vale (loan) [23,10]; 14.12.83 Fulham (loan); August 1984 Fulham (loan); 9.1.85 Fulham (£80,000) [22+3,11]; 19.9.85 Leicester City (£60,000) [28+11,7]; 7.3.87 Bournemouth (loan); July 1987 Sporting Lisbon (Portugal) [29,9]; August 1988 SC Braga (Portugal) [4,0]; March 1989 Brentford (free); August 1989 Swindon Town (trial); 11.9.89 Bristol Rovers (free) [21+16,7]; May 1991 MYPA Myllykosken (Finland); October 1991 Brentford (free) [20+10,4]; August 1992 Merthyr Tydfil (trial); September 1992 Michelotti (Hong Kong); July 1993 Eastern (Hong Kong); August 1995 Hong Kong FC (sporting manager; Director of Operations, 2002).\n\nQuick, stocky and powerful, Tony Sealy could claim one extraordinary record. In the space of a decade, he won four championship medals in England with four separate clubs, one of these being Rovers, for whom his three goals eased the club towards the 1989-90 Third Division title. Sent off in Rovers’ 2-2 draw with Huddersfield Town in November 1989 after punching Dudley Lewis, he scored twice, after 27 and 74 minutes, as Rovers won 3-2 at Shrewsbury the same month and remained at Twerton Park sufficiently long to help establish the side in Division Two. Sealy was in the Southampton reserves’ side at sixteen but, unable to stake a regular claim to a place in the team, he enjoyed success at a number of clubs, winning a Division Two championship medal with QPR in 1982-83 (during which season he top-scored with sixteen goals) and Third Division medals with Bournemouth, Rovers and Brentford. Cup success, however, eluded him, although he appeared as a substitute for Austin Hayes when Saints lost the 1979 League Cup Final 3-2 to Nottingham Forest at Wembley. A prodigious childhood goal-scorer who racked up 224 goals at all levels in the 1974-75 season, Sealy scored after just thirteen seconds for Brentford against Bristol City, played at Griffin Park against Rovers in April 1989, twice broke a fibula whilst with Rovers and partnered the Brazilian striker Cascavel in domestic and European football with Lisbon. He enjoyed two loan spells at Port Vale, three of the four goals in his second stint being penalties. After a spell in Finland had seen him help Myllykosken to promotion to the Finnish Premier Division, Sealy represented the Hong Kong League XI and helped Hong Kong FC, who fluctuated between the top two divisions, to six promotions from the Second Division and to win the 2005 Junior Shield. A qualified physiotherapist and a recognisable figure on Hong Kong television as a football pundit and analyst, he commentated for the 1994 World Cup and 1996 Olympics. He is the younger child of Austin Sealy, who died in 1999, and Sheila Peck; his two sons have played professionally in Hong Kong, Jack Sealy of Sun Hei (who later played professionally in China) winning his first full cap for the unofficial Hong Kong national side in the 2-2 draw with Guangdeong in December 2011, when he set up the late equaliser for Cheng Siu Wai.\n\nNo 326. Raymond Seatherton. 1955-56.\n\nBorn, 20.5.1932, Tiverton, Devon.\n\nDied, 3.10.2011, Wellington, Somerset.\n\n5’ 11 ”; 12 st.\n\nDébut: 11.2.56 v Lincoln City.\n\nCareer: 1950 Tiverton Town; 1954 Minehead; 15.2.55 Bristol Rovers (free) [2,2]; May 1956 Minehead; July 1959 Taunton Town; 16.4.64 Tiverton Town (to May 1964).\n\nOf all Bristol Rovers players who have represented the club in more than one Football League game, only one man has scored in every match he has played; Ray Seatherton played twice in the quartered shirts and scored a goal in both games, a 3-0 victory against Lincoln City and a 1-1 draw with Barnsley. Something of a goal-scoring sensation at his home-town club, he scored four times in a 7-2 win against Wonford in April 1951 and he followed this up with a series of spectacular goal-scoring achievements over four years, managing four goals on four separate occasions as well as five in the 7-2 victory at home to Chelston in April 1953. Having scored an astonishing 112 goals in only 68 appearances, he also remains Minehead’s fifth highest scorer ever, his 46 goals in only 23 matches in all competitions including five in the away game at Radstock in January 1955. His final game came against Gloucester City, by which time he had agreed to join Rovers, the Eastville side beating off the challenge of West Bromwich Albion and Plymouth Argyle as well as Bristol City, to sign the prolific marksman. Despite scoring twice on his début for Rovers reserves, a 2-0 win at home to Reading reserves in March 1955, Ray had to wait almost a year for his League bow, as Rovers’ strike-force was brimming with talent, although a hat-trick in the opening 25 minutes, as Rovers reserves defeated Aldershot reserves 3-0 at Eastville, ensured a Second Division début the following Saturday. Following a knee complaint, Seatherton returned to his home-town club almost a decade to the day since he had left and played twice, scoring twice in a 3-1 win at Sidmouth Town in the East Devon League and hitting the ninth hat-trick of his time at Tiverton in a 6-0 victory at home to Crediton United, to retire with 117 goals in just seventy matches for the side. Latterly a motor mechanic in Tiverton and a cricketer with Heathcote Cricket Club, he was the uncle of Mark Seatherton, who also played for Tiverton Town, prior to joining Elmore in 1993 and Clyst Rovers twelve months later; indeed, six Seathertons have played for that club, whilst his mother’s family was the Babb family of financial consultants in Tiverton. Ray Seatherton, who married Janet Poole and had a son Robert, a daughter Hazel and two grandsons, Aaron and Jacob, died at the age of seventy-nine at Chelston Gardens, Wellington, Somerset and was buried at Taunton Deane Crematorium.\n\nNo 801. Daniel Luke Senda. 2010-11.\n\nBorn, 17.4.1981, Harrow, Middlesex.\n\n5’ 10”; 10 st 2 lbs.\n\nDébut: 19.2.11 v Oldham Athletic.\n\nCareer: Marlon Oaks; 1997 Southampton; 1.7.99 Wycombe Wanderers [218+58,9]; July 2006 Luton Town (trial); July 2006 Leeds United (trial); July 2006 Wolverhampton Wanderers (trial); 31.8.06 Millwall (free) [73+3,1]; 16.9.10 Torquay United (free) [2,0]; 18.2.11 Bristol Rovers (free) [15,0]; 26.7.11 Barnet (free) [19,0] (retired, 26.2.13); 27.8.15 Brentford (Community Sports Trust, youth coach); August 2017 Barnet (Under-18 coach; 31.1.19 first-team coach); 14.7.20 Orient (assistant first team coach, to 11.6.21).\n\nSeventy-three minutes into Wycombe’s game in Horfield in May 2001, Danny Senda fired the ball home to seal his side’s victory and relegate Rovers to the basement division for the first time in the club’s history. A decade later, as Rovers struggled in vain to prevent the drop back into League Two, right-back Senda was one of many signings made but, although many hoped he could ironically be the one to score the goal to maintain Rovers’ League One status, late season form saw the side drop back down. An England international at Under-17 level, Senda made his Wycombe début, against Oldham as his Rovers bow would be, in March 1999 and he was soon converted from a teenage striker to a cultured full-back. Sent off on three occasions at Wycombe, twice in games against QPR, he also played in the remarkable 8-3 defeat against Aston Villa in the League Cup in September 2005. His solitary Millwall goal came against Swindon Town in May 2008, but an injury incurred in that game ruled him out for six months and his Torquay bow saw him replaced by Wayne Carlisle after 74 minutes at home to Macclesfield Town. Prior to joining Rovers he had played in eight League games and one Football League Trophy tie against the Pirates and he appeared in both Barnet’s games against Rovers in 2011-12 and was a team-mate of Scott McGleish at Underhill until a dislocated knee in January 2012, ironically again against Swindon, brought his career to a premature close. He married Catherine Worboys at Le Château Grimaldi in Aix-en-Provence on 20th September 2014.\n\nNo 895. Liam Michael Sercombe. 2017-18.\n\nBorn, 25.4.1990, Exeter.\n\n5’ 10”; 10 st 12 lbs.\n\nDébut: 5.8.17 v Charlton Athletic.\n\nCareer: 2000 Exeter City (30.6.07 professional) [205+31,23]; 13.5.15 Oxford United (free) [69+6,17]; 31.5.17 Bristol Rovers (£150,000) [93+10,13]; 4.8.20 Cheltenham Town (free) [68+11,10].\n\nImpressive attacking midfielder Liam Sercombe had played effectively for both Exeter and Oxford against Rovers prior to his arrival at The Mem. Well-known to supporters, his signing was an encouraging pre-season boost ahead of Rovers’ second campaign back in the third tier of English football, implying as it did that Darrell Clarke meant business. With his home-town club as a boy, Sercombe made his bow in the Conference, appearing against Altrincham in August 2007, helped the Grecians to successive promotions from the Conference, where he played his first 4(+3) matches, generally alongside the former Rovers player Wayne Carlisle, to League One and was with them when they were relegated back to League Two. He scored twice in both a 3-0 victory over Orient on Easter Monday 2012 and also in a 4-0 victory at Scunthorpe in October 2013 and played three times against the Gas. Oxford’s 2015-16 season was one of great success; like Rovers, they were promoted to League One on the final day, the midfielder chipping in with seventeen goals, fifteen of them in the League and including braces against Accrington and Barnet. He also scored a penalty as Premier League Swansea City were defeated 3-2 in the FA Cup in January 2016, but his time with Oxford was curtailed by a ruptured medial ligament injury. Sercombe played four times for Oxford against Rovers, being sent off at The Mem in September 2015, and played in successive Football League Trophy finals at Wembley; Oxford lost 3-2 to Barnsley in 2016 and 2-1 to Coventry twelve months later, Sercombe scoring the seventy-fifth-minute consolation goal with a low right-foot shot into the bottom corner of the net. Following his departure from Rovers, Sercombe was a pivotal figure in the Cheltenham side promoted to League One as fourth-tier champions in 2020-21. Playing alongside Ryan Broom, he converted a penalty at Whaddon Road in October 2022 against Rovers, a consolation goal as the Gas strolled to a 4-1 victory, and was in the Robins’ side which crashed 2-1 at home to unfashionable Alvechurch in the FA Cup the following month.\n\nNo 738. Ricky Unric Bascombe Shakes. 2004-05.\n\nBorn, 25.1.1985, Brixton.\n\n5’ 9”; 12 st 2 lbs.\n\nDébut: 26.2.05 v Macclesfield Town.\n\nCareer: Charlton Athletic (schoolboy); 2001 Bolton Wanderers (professional, 12.1.04); 7.2.05 Bristol Rovers (trial); 15.2.05 Bristol Rovers (loan) [0+1,0]; 24.3.05 Bury (loan) [4+3,2]; 11.5.05 Swindon Town (free) [52+17,5]; 31.8.07 Brentford (free) [25+14,3]; 10.7.08 Ebbsfleet United (free); 19.8.10 Stockport County (trial); 28.6.12 Kidderminster Harriers (free); 3.7.13 Boreham Wood (free); 7.1.21 St Albans City (retired, 7.4.21).\n\nDuring Rovers’ long history, only two of the club’s players have been dual internationals, Matt O’Mahony, who played for the two Irelands, and Ricky Shakes. Having made his Trinidad and Tobago début in a 2-0 victory over Iceland at Loftus Road in March 2006, Dwight Yorke scoring both goals, he then played with FIFA permission for Guyana in October 2011 as they won 2-0 in Barbados in a World Cup qualifier. Shakes, born in London to a Trinidadian mother, Amy Pernell, and a Guyanan father, James Shakes, won just one cap for Trinidad and fourteen for Guyana, scoring against Bermuda and, in November 2011, against his former colleagues from Trinidad. Shakes actually made his Rovers début and his international début as a substitute for a player called Edwards, coming on for Trinidad for Luton Town’s Carlos Edwards and for Rovers for Christian Edwards after 69 minutes of the 2-1 defeat at Macclesfield. He was the 26th player used by Rovers in the League that season. Unable to make the grade at Bolton, he had appeared in the League Cup at Yeovil in September 2004, playing alongside household names such as Julio Cesar, El-Hadji Diouf and Les Ferdinand, and scored a last-minute equaliser in the FA Cup against Tranmere Rovers, before playing for the Pirates’ reserve side against Birmingham City and being an unused substitute in the LDV Vans Trophy. Relegated to League Two with Swindon in 2005-06, he played against Rovers, before appearing in Brentford’s record-equalling 7-0 defeat at Peterborough. Helping Ebbsfleet to promotion to the Conference in May 2011 and scoring in the play-off final as Farnborough were defeated 4-2, he scored fifteen goals in 82(+34) games in four years with Ebbsfleet and played in 8(+9) Conference matches for Harriers. Although a knee injury in training prevented him from making his bow for Boreham Wood until April 2014, Shakes closed the 2013-14 campaign with 6(+2) Conference North appearances and a goal against Havant and Waterlooville. He scored the first two goals as Boreham Wood won 5-0 at Bishop’s Stortford on New Year’s Day 2015, totalling twnety-one goals in 140(+42) appearances as his side reached the Nationwide South play-offs; Shakes played in the 2-1 victory over Whitehawk in May 2015 which earned his side promotion to the Conference, where his second-half hat-trick helped his side to a 5-0 victory over Dover Athletic in March 2017. After four National League South games with St Albans City, Ricky Shakes retired from professional sport.\n\nNo 744. Scott Shearer. 2005-07.\n\nBorn, 15.2.1981, Glasgow.\n\n6’ 3”; 14 st 8 lbs.\n\nDébut: 6.8.05 v Barnet.\n\nCareer: Tower Hearts; 1.7.00 Albion Rovers [47+2,1]; 14.10.02 Celtic (trial); 1.7.03 Coventry City (free) [37+1,0]; 17.2.05 Rushden and Diamonds (loan) [13,0]; 27.7.05 Bristol Rovers (free) [47,0]; 25.10.06 Shrewsbury Town (loan) [20,0]; 28.5.07 Wycombe Wanderers (free) [62+1,0]; 26.7.10 Wrexham (free); 22.12.10 Crawley Town (free) [25,0]; 25.5.12 Rotherham United (free) [31,0]; 3.7.14 Crewe Alexandra (free) [2,0]; 2.1.15 Burton Albion (loan) [0+1,0]; 24.6.15 Mansfield Town (free) [45+1,0]; 16.5.17 Oxford United (free) [1,0] (retired, 9.5.19; goalkeeping coach, 2.7.19).\n\nStrong, left-footed goalkeeper Scott Shearer, distinctive in his red boots, was Rovers’ regular custodian in the 2005-06 season. His last-minute header from a corner flew wide of the post, Rovers losing 3-2 at home to Peterborough in August 2005, but his greater skill was at the other end as a reliable shot-stopper. Having made his Albion début as a substitute at Brechin City in April 2001, Shearer was an ever-present in 2002-03, helping Albion finish third in Division Three, the largest victory being a 6-0 trouncing of East Stirling that Christmas, and he was credited with a goal in the 1-1 draw with Queen’s Park at Hampden Park, scrambling the ball home from a corner two minutes from time. His club form earned a Scotland B cap and a call-up by Bertie Vogts to the full Scotland squad, although no full caps were forthcoming. Having played for Coventry against Spurs in the League Cup in September 2003, Shearer was debited with an own goal when Rushden played at The Mem in April 2005 and joined Rovers shortly afterwards. Out of favour with Rovers, who had signed Steve Phillips, the amiable goalkeeper joined Shrewsbury, only for his loan club to meet his parent club at Wembley in the 2007 play-off final, Shearer not being given permission to play. Having suffered knee ligament damage at Wycombe, he played in the Conference on nine occasions with Wrexham and in 15(+1) games at Crawley. On the bench as Crawley defeated Derby County and then lost at Old Trafford in the FA Cup in the spring of 2011, he played his part as they secured the Conference title that season, appeared in the FA Cup against Bristol City in January 2012 and played against Rovers in the Football League with both Wycombe and Crawley. Shearer then helped Rotherham gain promotion to League One in the spring of 2013 and reach the play-offs twelve months later; he was with Tom Hitchcock on Rotherham’s bench as Orient were defeated at the 2014 Wembley play-off final to secure a return to second-tier football. A solitary appearance for Burton was as a final-day substitute at Cambridge, after goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin was sent off with twenty-one minutes remaining, Albion having already secured the League Two title. Despite only sporadic appearances with Mansfield, he managed to save two penalties in the home fixture with Morecambe in February 2016, a game the Stags won 2-1 and was in their side which lost at The Mem the following month.\n\nNo 401. (Dick) Richard James Sheppard. 1969-75.\n\nBorn, 14.2.1945, Bristol.\n\nDied, 18.10.1998, Bristol.\n\n6’; 13 st 2 lbs.\n\nDébut: 9.8.69 v Southport.\n\nCareer: Filton Avenue School; Bristol Boys; Gloucester Schools; 1960 West Bromwich Albion (professional, 14.2.63) [39,0]; 5.6.69 Bristol Rovers (free) [151,0]; 11.12.73 Torquay United (loan) [2,0]; 21.2.75 Fulham (loan); 1.6.75 Weymouth (free); 1976 Portway Bristol; 1977 Paulton Rovers; January 1980 Bristol Rovers (goalkeeping coach).\n\nBrave, reliable goalkeeper Dick Sheppard made his name at The Hawthorns before returning to his home-town club where he enjoyed great success and was an ever-present in the 1970-71 season. A team-mate at West Brom of Kenny Stephens, he made his début in a 4-1 victory at home to Sunderland in Division One in October 1965 and played in the first League Cup Final to be played at Wembley, the Baggies losing to Queen’s Park Rangers 3-2 in an exciting game in March 1967, having led 2-0 at the interval. Sheppard was an unused member of West Brom’s squad for the 1968 FA Cup Final, just as he was with Fulham in 1975. A popular figure at Eastville, he appeared in 77 consecutive League fixtures and was named Evening Post Sports Personality of the Year for 1972, the year his crucial penalty save from Ted Hemsley enabled Rovers to win the Watney Cup. He also saved a penalty from George Best (1946-2005) at Old Trafford when Rovers won 2-1 there in a League Cup-tie on October 1972. However, a depressed fracture of the skull, sustained in an accidental collision with Tranmere’s Eddie Loyden in January 1973 effectively ended his career, ruling him entirely out of the 1973-74 promotion campaign, although he toured Australia and New Zealand with the Rovers party. Sheppard did make one further appearance for Rovers, standing in for the injured Jim Eadie for the December 1974 local derby, but being beaten by four second-half goals at the Muller Road End as Bristol City won 4-1, enjoyed a brief loan spell at Torquay, whom he joined at an evening roadside rendezvous near Bridgwater. He was awarded a testimonial game against West Brom in January 1979 and later worked for a light industrial company before joining Bristol Television and Film Services as a commercial artist. The younger child of Albert Edward Sheppard and Kathleen Bennett, he had England Schoolboys trials and was English shot-put champion and record-holder in his age group for the National Association of Boys’ Clubs. Dick Sheppard lived in Longwell Green with his wife Christine Whitehouse, their son Martin and their daughter Elizabeth, who was born in the early hours of the December 1970 day when Sheppard excelled in goal against Aldershot in the FA Cup. He also ran a sports shop on Gloucester Road, Filton. Rovers held a one-minute silence prior to the game with Stoke City, following his death at the age of fifty-three. He was posthumously awarded the Harry Bamford Trophy in October 2015.\n\nNo 488. Jeffery Sherwood. 1982-83.\n\nBorn, 5.10.1959, Bristol.\n\n5’ 10”; 11 st 3 lbs.\n\nDébut: 25.9.82 v Preston North End.\n\nCareer: 1975 Bristol Rovers (schoolboy); 1976 Bristol St George; 1977 Minehead; 1978 Taunton Town; 11.8.81 Bath City (£1,500); 7.6.82 Bristol Rovers (free) [16+2,0]; 17.9.83 Bath City (free); 13.8.87 Yeovil Town (£5,000); 20.11.90 Gloucester City (£15,000); February 1992 Merthyr Tydfil (loan); 5.8.92 Yeovil Town (free); 1995 Clevedon Town; 25.1.96 Bath City; 16.8.96 Brislington; 23.8.96 Trowbridge Town; 1.9.97 Clevedon Town; 16.1.98 Salisbury City (retired, 28.2.98); 2000 Brislington.\n\nBriefly the England international Mike Channon’s room-mate with Rovers, dependable defender Jeff Sherwood enjoyed a short career at Eastville. He was the youngest of three children to Donald George Sherwood (1933-88), the son of Donald Hector Sherwood (1907-77) and Dorothy Gwendoline Manners (1913-2007), and to Barbara Lucy Jay (1929-81), the daughter of George Gilford Jay (1891-1962) and Nellie Mahali Manners (1891-1964). Formerly a Gloucestershire Youth player, he had scored twice in 34 matches at St George, but made his name in non-league circles after leaving Third Division Rovers. Signed by the former Rovers forward Bobby Jones at Bath in 1983, he scored four times in 247(+2) games for the Romans, added five goals in 268 matches in all competitions with Yeovil and played 21 and 8(+5) times respectively at Clevedon and Merthyr. During his time at Huish, Yeovil were Isthmian League Premier Division champions in 1987-88, won the AC Delco Cup in 1988, beating Hayes 3-1 in the final, and were victors in the 1990 Bob Lord Challenge Trophy, recording a 4-1 aggregate win against Kidderminster Harriers in the final, Sherwood being named as the Supporters’ Club Player of the Year in 1987-88. Club form, consistent as it was, earned Sherwood representative honours for the Southern League XI and a Football Association XI. Yeovil’s Player of the Year in 1987-88, he captained the Glovers against Arsenal in the FA Cup in January 1993 but suffered relegation with them from the Conference in the spring of 1995. Club record signing at Gloucester, Sherwood played in 66(+1) matches without scoring for the Tigers. Married to Angela, who runs “Wild About Flowers” in Keynsham, Jeff Sherwood works for the Ministry of Defence at Abbeywood and lives in Hanham; they have a son and two daughters.\n\nNo 628. James Andrew Shore. 1998-2002.\n\nBorn, 1.9.1977, Bristol.\n\n5’ 9”; 11 st.\n\nDébut: 8.9.98 v Chesterfield.\n\nCareer: Whitchurch Sports; Milton Nomads; Norwich City (professional, 1995); 6.7.98 Bristol Rovers (trial); 21.7.98 Bristol Rovers (free) [18+6,2]; August 2002 Team Bath (coach); 6.12.03 Brislington Town (free); 1.4.04 Mangotsfield United (free); 14.1.11 Blackpool (Youth Development Officer); August 2012 SJK Football Academy, Finland (coach, to September 2012); April 2013 West Bromwich Albion (director, Development Centre, Bristol, to June 2014); 24.10.17 Yeovil Town (assistant coach).\n\nConstructive midfielder Jamie Shore from Backwell appeared to have the footballing world before him. His career shaped at Norwich by Gordon Bennett, the former Chief Executive at Rovers, he had toured Denmark, Austria, Holland, Belgium and France with the Canaries and spent two years at the Football Association School of Excellence at Lilleshall; he won caps for the England Under-16 side. Playing with “guts, grit and determination” (Don Veale), Shore was on Rovers’ books with his brother, but progressed to make his League début as a 75th-minute substitute for Michael Meaker in a goalless draw with Chesterfield. A first goal soon followed, the only goal of the game against Bournemouth in October 1998 and he added two excellent first-half strikes in the FA Cup against Exeter City. Feisty and combative on the field, he was sent off at Millwall that November and the following month, 21 minutes from the end of a game in which the future Rovers manager Paul Buckle starred for Colchester United as Rovers crashed 3-0. Then, as quickly as it had begun, Jamie Shore’s career was ended by a serious knee injury, despite pioneering medical work from Dr Angus Strover in London, using cartilage from a dead body, and in December 2000 from John Barrett in Florida, Shore undergoing sixteen knee operations in all. Many argued that his absence from Rovers’ midfield deprived the side of promotion in 1999-2000. A testimonial game in July 2004 brought Ian Holloway’s Queen’s Park Rangers to The Mem and attracted a 6,000 crowd, whilst Shore completed coaching qualifications, set up the Jamie Shore Soccer International group, assisted Holloway at Blackpool and worked as a football summariser on BBC Radio Bristol. He now works as a director for ProBones, a company creating bespoke shin-pads and lives in Clifton with his partner Natalie and their dog Winston.\n\nNo 9. Stephen Sims. 1920-21 and 1926-29.\n\nBorn, 11.12.1895, Bedminster.\n\nDied, 1973, Weston-super-Mare.\n\n5’ 11½”; 13 st.\n\nDébut: 28.8.20 v Millwall.\n\nCareer: Windmill Hill School; January 1914 Bath City; 28.5.14 Leicester Fosse [11,2]; 5.8.19 Bristol Rovers; 6.7.22 Burnley (£2,000) [11,0]; 23.7.24 Weymouth (£1,000); 24.9.25 Bristol City (£400); 4.9.26 Bristol Rovers [79,9]; 8.7.27 Newport County [4,0] (to 1928).\n\nVictor Sims (1868-1941) and Mary Jane Stenner (1854-1905) of 24 Spring Street, Bedminster had nine children, the fourth being the tall, muscular Steve Sims, Rovers’ captain in their first season in the Football League. A formidable central defender, saw-mill worker Sims was a key figure in Rovers’ side in the immediate years after World War One. Bringing with him the experience of League football with Leicester, where he had made his League bow against Lincoln City and played in a 7-1 defeat at Wolves in November 1914, and having represented the British expeditionary Forces XI in Egypt, he scored nine times in 32 Southern League matches, his début coming in a 2-0 home defeat against QPR in August 1919, during Rovers’ final season prior to elevation to Division Three. Four of those goals came in a 5-0 win at home to Luton Town in April 1920. “Always in the picture at centre-half”, as the local press noted, he had also scored prolifically at Bath, who were Western League runners-up in 1914. Sims led Rovers out at Millwall for that first League fixture, playing at centre-forward that day, and scored the winning goal at home to Newport County in the first League match hosted at Eastville before reverting to centre-half. It was in this more defensive rôle that he excelled, playing in 66 League fixtures before returning for thirteen more in the 1926-27 season, when he had become the first player ever transferred directly between the two professional clubs in Bristol. Tellingly, it was after Sims’ early departure with a tenth-minute injury, that Rovers capitulated 8-1 at Swansea over Easter 1922. Away from Eastville, he married Elizabeth Hoare in the autumn of 1922, captained Weymouth in two FA Cup-ties against Rovers in December 1924, having made his début against Swindon Victoria and leading the side to second place in the Western League, and made his Bristol City reserves début against his former club Weymouth, but could not break into the side at Ashton Gate. Rovers were fined in 1927 for playing Sims without properly re-registering him, but the popular centre-half was a welcome addition to the Eastville scene. His name has often been given as “Stephen”, but is written with a “v” in his father’s hand-writing on the 1911 census return.\n\nNo 735. Scott Andrew Sinclair. 2004-05 and 2022-\n\nBorn, 29.3.1989, Bath.\n\n5’ 10”; 10 st 1 lb.\n\nDébut: 26.12.04 v Orient.\n\nCareer: Ralph Allen School; Bath Arsenal; Bristol Rovers; 2.6.05 Chelsea (£200,000) [1+4,0]; 19.1.07 Plymouth Argyle (loan) [8+7,2]; 6.11.07 Queen’s Park Rangers (loan) [8+1,1]; 5.3.08 Charlton Athletic (loan) [0+3,0]; 27.3.08 Crystal Palace (loan) [6,2]; 6.1.09 Birmingham City (loan) [8+6,0]; 5.8.09 Wigan Athletic (loan) [1+17,1]; 7.8.10 Swansea City (£1,000,000) [74+8,28]; 31.8.12 Manchester City (£6,200,000) [2+9,0]; 22.8.13 West Bromwich Albion (loan) [4+4,0]; 30.1.15 Aston Villa (loan); 19.5.15 Aston Villa (£2,500,000) [24+12,3]; 7.8.16 Celtic (£3,500,000) [77+28,40]; 8.1.20 Preston North End [50+28,12] (released, 9.5.22); 18.10.22 Bristol Rovers (free) [0+2,0].\n\nTwenty-five goals for the Under-16 side before Christmas 2004, including hat-tricks against Exeter City and Bath City, proved too great a temptation to resist. Slim, quick striker Scott Sinclair was given his League début on Boxing Day, his solitary minute on the pitch that day making him, at fifteen years 277 days, the youngest player since 1928 to appear in the League for the club and the second youngest ever. The middle of three boys to Martin Sinclair, a semi-professional player in the Bath area, and his wife Sally Edgell, his elder brother Martin represented the Great Britain Cerebral Palsy football side in the 2012 Paralympics and his younger brother Jake is on the books of Southampton and had a trial with Rovers in 2015; young Scott made a dramatic impression at Rovers and was soon snapped up by Chelsea, where he scored twenty-five times in youth and reserve football before breaking a bone in his foot on his League début against Manchester United in January 2007. “He’s like Dash from that film The Incredibles”, said Ian Holloway. A talented rugby full-back and a keen sprinter, Sinclair spent several spells on loan, playing alongside Barry Hayles at Holloway’s Plymouth, for whom he scored an astonishing FA Cup goal against Barnet after a mazy run from inside his own penalty area seven minutes from time. Sinclair inspired Swansea to a hugely successful 2010-11 season, completing a League Cup hat-trick at Peterborough in September 2010 and finishing the season at Wembley, where the South Walians returned to top-flight football with a 4-2 play-off final victory over Reading; Sinclair scored a hat-trick on the hallowed turf, a 21st-minute penalty, another goal a minute later and a second penalty ten minutes from time to secure promotion. His form in the Premier League attracted champions Manchester City, who paid a large sum for his services on his return from the 2012 London Olympics, where he scored for Team GB against the United Arab Emirates on their way to eventual quarter-final defeat. An England cap at various youth age groups, he scored once in seven games for the Under-21 side. However, Sinclair’s first season with Manchester City was a disappointment, his side finishing runners-up in the League and being defeated by unfashionable Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup Final, although he barely made the first-team, and he was subsequently sent out on loan. His arrival at Villa Park signalled a sea change in his fortunes, as early goals (two in the FA Cup and a League strike at home to Stoke) ensured his popularity and he played in the FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool which set up a May 2015 Wembley final against Arsenal in which he remained an unused substitute. A regular in Tim Sherwood’s Villa side, he scored a hat-trick in a League Cup-tie against Notts County in August 2015, but Villa slumped to the foot of the table and were relegated to the Championship at the end of that season. Sinclair’s final action with Villa was a pre-season friendly against Rovers, before a high-profile move north of the border saw him score in his first six Scottish League appearances. He was in the Celtic side which lost 7-0 at Barcelona in the Champions League in September 2016, but the Celts drove all before them in a hugely successful season, becoming the first Scottish top division side since Rangers in 1898-99 to complete a domestic League season undefeated, and Sinclair’s star shone brightly as they went on to complete an unprecedented “Treble Treble”, winning League, Cup and League Cup in 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. Voted SPFA Player of the Year in 2017, he was second highest scorer in the Premier League behind Ross County’s Liam Boyce. A hat-trick at Hearts in April 2017 came on the day Celtic secured the League title and, having won the League Cup, they completed the domestic treble by beating Aberdeen 2-1 in the Scottish Cup Final. Twelve months later, the Celts retained all three titles, Sinclair playing the final sixty seconds of the Scottish Cup Final and notably scoring, against Hamilton Academical in December 2017, the 100,000th goal registered in top-flight Scottish football. On Boxing Day 2018 he struck an impressive hat-trick at Pittodrie, as the Celts defeated nearest rivals Aberdeen 4-3 in an entertaining fixture to stamp their control on the Premier League season once again. Another hat-trick, against St Johnstone in February 2019, eased Celtic towards the Scottish Cup Final of 2019, where Michael Smith’s Hearts were defeated 2-1 at Hampden Park. Having made two substitute appearances as a teenager, Sinclair returned to Rovers in the autumn of 2022 and he returned to the side for the final moments of an enthralling 2-2 draw at home to table-topping Plymouth Argyle, some seventeen years and 196 days since he had last pulled on a Rovers shirt. His sixty-fifth-minute right-footed goal, when set up by James Connolly, not only saw off Rochdale in the first round of the FA Cup, but also signalled his first goal in Rovers quarters on his first ever full start for the team. He is engaged to Helen Flanagan, who plays Coronation Street’s Rosie Webster, and the couple have two daughters, Matilda, born in June 2015 and Delilah, born in June 2018 and a son, Charlie, born in May 2021.\n\nNo 865. Stuart Sinclair. 2015-18.\n\nBorn, 9.11.1987, Houghton Conquest, Bedfordshire.\n\n5’ 6”; 10 st 9 lbs.\n\nDébut: 8.8.15 v Northampton Town.\n\nCareer: Luton Town (scholar; YTS, 1.7.04); 1.8.06 Cambridge City (free); 11.8.07 Bedford Town (free); 8.6.08 Dunstable Town (free); 1.7.10 Arlesey Town (free); 9.1.12 Salisbury City (free); 30.6.14 Bristol Rovers (free) [100+15,5]; 21.5.19 Walsall (free; released, 11.5.21) [31+12,2].\n\nHeavily bearded freshwater angler Stuart Sinclair began Rovers’ first season of Conference football with aplomb. Playing effectively in the centre of midfield, he was sent off at Altrincham, scored at Lincoln and at Gateshead, and was awarded the Beard of the Month award. Yet, the long-haired, talented ball-winner was worth more to the side than simply the owner of facial hair with its own Twitter account. An effective “box-to-box midfielder”, he had won the Player of the Year award in both 2012-13 and 2013-14 at Salisbury, where he played alongside his younger brother, Rob; Stuart is the eldest of four boys, Andy and Scott also having been on Luton’s books. Lured to Rovers by his former manager, Sinclair repaid Darrell Clarke’s faith with a series of decisive performances as Rovers strode confidently up the League table in September 2014. Prior to this, following a début in the 1-1 draw at Thurrock in January 2012, he had played for Salisbury in 51(+1) Conference South matches, scoring six goals plus a further goal in the play-off match against Dover Athletic, and in 33(+2) Conference games. One goal in 20(+16) Nationwide South games at Cambridge City and eight goals in 36(+1) Southern League appearances at Bedford, whom he chose ahead of Hemel Hempstead Town, preceded a spell at Dunstable, where he is primarily remembered for a powerful shot past Sean Greygoose after just ten minutes of the January 2009 fixture against Soham Town Rangers. Salisbury, alerted to Sinclair’s ability when he opposed them with Arlesey in the FA Cup in November 2011, soon progressed to Conference promotion-hopefuls Rovers. Undeniably a major force as Rovers embarked on a twenty-match unbeaten run through the winter, his end-of-campaign absence through injury threatened to allow Rovers’ promotion train to run off the rails. After two goals in 24(+3) Conference matches, he was named Young Pirates’ Player of the Year for 2014-15, Rovers securing their return to the Football League that May. Astonishingly, the side went up again twelve months later, Lee Brown’s dramatic injury-time winner securing promotion to League One in May 2016 on goal difference; as in the previous campaign, though, the influential Sinclair had been side-lined through injury as the season drew to a close. Focused and determined, Sinclair played a major role in Rovers’ on-field success in 2016-17, winning the penalty that Ellis Harrison converted at Stamford Bridge in the League Cup in August 2016 but also being sent off for two yellow cards at Bury in March 2017 and for a two-footed challenge after just seven minutes of the FA Cup tie away to non-league Barnet in November 2017. Sinclair followed manager Darrell Clarke to Walsall in the summer of 2019, scoring for the Saddlers in away fixtures at Morecambe and Orient.\n\nNo 565. Justin Skinner. 1991-98.\n\nBorn, 30.1.1969, Hounslow.\n\n6’; 11 st 3 lbs.\n\nDébut: 31.8.91 v Newcastle United.\n\nCareer: 1985 Fulham (professional, 17.11.86) [111+24,23]; 27.8.91 Bristol Rovers (£130,000) [174+13,11]; 11.9.97 Walsall (loan) [10,0]; 13.3.98 Stoke City (trial); 21.3.98 Hibernian (trial); 28.5.98 Hibernian (free) [29+1,2]; 3.9.99 Dunfermline Athletic (£80,000) [78+13,0]; 14.8.02 Brechin City (free) [20,0]; 26.5.03 Weston-super-Mare (free); 31.5.04 Windsor and Eton (free); June 2004 Chelsea (coach); June 2006 Queen’s Park Rangers (coach); 5.7.07 Lewes (assistant manager); 21.5.09 Farnborough (assistant manager); 1.7.11 Lewes (assistant manager); 5.12.11 Millwall (Under-18 coach; Elite Squad coach, 2.6.15-8.3.17).\n\nArriving at Twerton Park as Rovers’ record signing, midfielder Justin Skinner scored on his club début from the substitute’s bench when he replaced David Wilson against Newcastle United. He again scored in a 3-3 draw with Port Vale in November 1991, before waiting almost two years for the next goal, in a 2-0 victory over the same opposition at Twerton Park. Previously, he had made his Fulham début in the Freight Rover Trophy against Southend United in January 1987, appeared in three League fixtures against Rovers and was in the Cottagers’ side for the two play-off games in May 1989. The elder son of a senior non-league footballer, David Skinner, and his wife, Lorna Cornwall, and apparently raised in Honduras, Skinner was in the Rovers side that lost 2-1 to Huddersfield Town at Wembley in May 1995 in the play-off final and was also in the side humiliated 2-1 at Hitchin Town the following November in the FA Cup. An injury in a pre-season friendly against Brislington in August 1996 caused him to miss months and, having not scored a League goal in two years, his strikes in successive home fixtures over Easter 1997 helped ensure Rovers’ third-tier survival for another season. Hibs were relegated in 1997-98, finishing the campaign at the foot of the Scottish Premier League, Skinner then being sent off eight minutes after half-time at Airdrie in October 1998. With Dunfermline, he conceded a first-minute own goal in August 2000 to a Dundee side which then converted two second-half penalties in their 3-0 victory, and he was sent off in a 4-1 defeat against Rangers twelve months later. A Brechin début in a 1-0 win at home to Hamilton set Skinner on course to win a Second Division championship medal in 2002-03 and he later worked for two years at Stamford Bridge.\n\nNo 475. Neil John Slatter. 1980-85.\n\nBorn, 30.5.1964, Cardiff.\n\n5’ 11”; 10 st 9 lbs.\n\nDébut: 11.4.81 v Shrewsbury Town.\n\nCareer: Ton-yr-Wren Primary School; Llanishan High School; Cardiff Boys; 1.7.80 Bristol Rovers (professional, 1.5.82) [147+1,4]; 12.7.85 Oxford United (£80,000) [88+3,6]; 22.3.90 Bournemouth (loan) [5+1,0]; July 1990 Gloucester City (free) (to 1991).\n\nProdigiously talented teenage full-back Neil Slatter broke into Rovers’ side at the age of sixteen and was to win 22 full caps for his country. In February 1986, his strike two minutes after half-time gave the Welsh the lead at the Jalawi Stadium in Khobar, en route to a 2-1 victory over Saudi Arabia. A second international goal came in September of that year, when his rising shot following a left-wing corner brought a 68th-minute equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Finland at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki, having come on as a substitute for his former Rovers team-mate, David Williams. The youngest post-war débutant for the Pirates, at 16 years 314 days, until the arrival of Scott Sinclair, Slatter also won ten Welsh caps during his time at Eastville to set a club record since surpassed by Vitālijs Astafjevs. Tough, tactically aware and skilful, Slatter won six caps for Wales at under-21 level to add to appearances for the national youth side, whilst his first goal for the club leaves him as the fifth youngest man to score for Rovers in the League. All four of his League goals came away from home, although he did score in the 3-1 home victory over Barnet in the FA Cup in November 1983. Sent off against Wigan Athletic in October 1982, he provided strength and stability as Rovers pushed towards the top end of Division Three. His international appearances included an own goal as Wales lost 4-2 in Norway in June 1985, just weeks before his expensive move to top-flight Oxford. He was in the squad for Oxford’s League Cup victory at Wembley in 1986, took part in the club tour of Sweden the following year and scored the first goal Manchester United conceded after Alex Ferguson had been appointed manager. His career over following a recurrent injury at Gloucester, where he played only once, Neil Slatter, who is a useful all-round cricketer with Cardiff CC, moved to Cardiff to work as a police constable. The son of Peter Slatter and Shirley Lewis, he is married since 1988 to Alyson Organ with two daughters, Lauren and Chloë.\n\nNo 897. Sam Oliver Slocombe. 2017-18.\n\nBorn, 5.6.1988, Scunthorpe.\n\n6’; 11 st 11 lbs.\n\nDébut: 19.8.17 v Bury.\n\nCareer: York College; Lincoln City (juniors); Bottesford Town; 15.8.08 Scunthorpe United (£3,000) [112,0]; 12.6.15 Oxford United (free) [23,0]; 19.7.16 Blackpool (free) [34,0]; 6.7.17 Bristol Rovers (free) [25,0]; 21.8.18 Lincoln City (loan); 1.8.19 Notts County (free).\n\nHaving kept clean sheets at The Mem for both Scunthorpe and Oxford, Sam Slocombe arrived in the Rovers camp ahead of the 2017-18 season and duly became the 900th player to appear for the club in the Football League. However, his early-season run in the side came to an abrupt halt when he was sent off at home to Walsall in September 2017. The youngest child of Graham Slocombe and Sharon Andrews, who had married in Scunthorpe in 1980, Slocombe played for the English Colleges XI whilst at York College’s Football Development Centre before representing Northern Counties East League side Bottesford Town. “It’s great to get back into the thick of things with training”, he said on joining his home-town club, Scunthorpe, making his first appearance as a substitute in a League Cup-tie against Port Vale in September 2009. His League bow came against future club Blackpool two months later, but Scunny were relegated from the Championship in 2010-11 and from League One in 2012-13. One highlight was playing in the side which won at Pride Park in August 2012 in a League Cup match, United recovering from three goals behind at half-time to draw 5-5 and defeat Derby County 7-6 on penalties. Slocombe enjoyed last-gasp promotion from League Two in both 2015-16 and 2016-17; the former was through Oxford’s final-day victory which took them up alongside Rovers, whilst the latter followed seventeen clean sheets in all competitions for the season, as Blackpool defeated Exeter City 2-1 at Wembley in the play-off final. Playing alongside Liam Sercombe, he had also played as Premier League Swansea City were beaten 3-2 by Oxford in the FA Cup in January 2016. He never made the League side at Lincoln City, who were League Two champions in 2018-19, and played in 86 Conference matches with Notts County, who missed out on promotion back to the Football League, in the play-off final, at the hands of Harrogate Town in the summer of 2020. Sam Slocombe was sent off whilst playing for Notts County against Dagenham and Redbridge in February 2021, his side again making the play-offs in 2022, only to lose to Grimsby Town. On the other hand, he was fortunate to have been rested on the day of the FA Cup shock in October 2022, when his Notts County side lost 3-2 at home to local neighbours Coalville Town.\n\nNo 513. Gary Michael Smart. 1985-87.\n\nBorn, 8.12.1963, Southmead, Bristol.\n\n5’ 9”; 10 st 7 lbs.\n\nDébut: 19.10.85 v Doncaster Rovers.\n\nCareer: Bristol Rovers (schoolboy); Mangotsfield United; Avon St Phillips; August 1985 Bristol St George; 11.10.85 Bristol Rovers (free) [11+8,4]; August 1987 Cheltenham Town; November 1987 Wokingham (trial); February 1988 Wokingham; June 1988 Bath City; 3.6.96 Mangotsfield United; 30.9.96 Forest Green Rovers (coach); 19.6.99 Newport County (coach); 2000 Paulton Rovers; March 2000 Gloucester City; June 2000 Paulton Rovers; June 2001 Clevedon Town (player-coach); 2002 Bath City (coach); December 2002 Paulton Rovers; 14.11.03 Bath City (caretaker manager); December 2003 Bristol Manor Farm; 2004 Sea Mills Park; 2008 Wells City (assistant manager).\n\nThroughout the long history of Bristol Rovers, few goals stand out with greater clarity than the one midfielder Gary Smart scored at Ashton Gate on New Year’s Day 1987. Under the cosh for the whole game, Rovers had somehow survived the expected mauling, when Smart received the ball near the halfway line three minutes from time, stepped forward and unleashed a vicious dipping drive which seared into the net and secured a famous victory in the cauldron of a local derby. At this stage, Smart scored in three successive League fixtures for Rovers and he had also scored as Bath City were defeated 2-0 in the opening friendly after Rovers’ move to Twerton Park in August 1986. Twice suffering a broken leg, one in the 1990-91 season ruling him out for two years, Smart had previously been working in a laundry in Staple Hill and later added two goals in 15(+1) matches with Cheltenham, scoring on his début in a 1-1 draw with Wealdstone. A long career at Bath encompassed 254(+39) games and 71 goals as well as the 5-0 FA Cup defeat against Rovers in November 1994 but, transfer-listed after a 4-0 defeat at Stalybridge Celtic, he broke his wrist on his Forest Green début. Captaining Forest Green to an unprecedented promotion to the Conference in the spring of 1998, his seventeenth goal of the campaign setting up the 2-0 victory over Bath City that secured the Southern League title, he scored once in 16(+13) Conference games the following campaign. In addition, Smart scored the 82nd-minute winning goal, two minutes after coming onto the field as a substitute, to defeat St Albans and take Forest Green to the 1999 FA Trophy Final, where he played the final fourteen minutes in a 1-0 Wembley defeat to Kingstonian. The third of four children to Michael Smart and Irene Hooper, he later worked with Wells City. Not to be confused with Gary Smart who played at the time for Oxford United and another player of the same name who was also with Cheltenham and Bath, Smart scored six goals in 26(+3) Doctor Martens League games for Newport and appeared in six fixtures with Gloucester and now works as a maintenance engineer.\n\nNo 896. Adam Clifford Smith 2017-18.\n\nBorn, 23.11.1992, Sunderland.\n\n6’ 4”; 11 st 3 lbs.\n\nDébut: 5.8.17 v Charlton Athletic.\n\nCareer: Middlesbrough; 2010 Leicester City (1.8.11 professional); 16.9.11 Chesterfield (loan); 6.1.12 Lincoln City (loan); 25.10.12 Nuneaton Town (loan); 11.1.14 Stevenage (loan); 25.4.14 Cambridge United (loan); 9.1.15 Mansfield Town (loan) [4,0]; 26.6.15 Northampton Town (free) [86,0]; 6.7.17 Bristol Rovers (free) [26+1,0]; 25.6.19 Forest Green Rovers (free) [8,0]; 23.9.19 Yeovil Town (loan); 6.3.20 Yeovil Town (loan); 22.8.20 Yeovil Town (loan); 22.10.21 Stevenage (free) [9,0]; 4.2.22 Morecambe (free) [1,0].\n\nAs Rovers prepared for the 2017-18 season, Adam Smith arrived at The Mem as a putative first-choice goalkeeper. At Leicester City, he had been named on the bench for nine Premier League matches, but never got on the field, one clean sheet against German side Schalke in the Premier League International Cup notwithstanding. His time with the prospective champions came to a dramatic close in May 2015 when a controversial video he had made with James Pearson and Tom Hopper on the club’s tour of Thailand was obtained by the “Sunday Mirror” and revealed supposed racial and sexual overtones. By that stage, the tall goalkeeper had made his Conference début against Barrow, a 6-1 defeat at Wrexham counting amongst seven matches with Nuneaton Town; his four games alongside Adam Cunnington for Cambridge were a 2-0 defeat against Gateshead in the Conference, two play-off semi-finals and a Wembley play-off final in May 2014 in which the same Gateshead side was defeated 2-1 to seal United’s return to the Football League fold; and a first Football League experience came in Mansfield’s 2-1 defeat at Burton Albion. His departure from Leicester saw a move to Northampton Town, where instant success came his way, from a winning club début at The Mem to fifteen clean sheets as the Cobblers raced to the League Two title, Smith being named his club’s Player of the Year and making the divisional team of the season. Having been the unfortunate keeper who conceded four Ellis Harrison goals when the Cobblers came to The Mem in January 2017, Smith nonetheless joined Rovers with a glowing reputation but was soon briefly ruled out by a broken bone in his hand. He later played in Yeovil’s home win over Bromley in September 2019 in the Conference, during which referee Aaron Jackson controversially sent off all eight ball-boys for time-wasting and their FA Cup-tie at Haringey the following month, which was abandoned amid claims of racist abuse of the home goalkeeper. In all, he played in 48 Conference matches for the Glovers, but was then in the Stevenage side knocked out of the FA Cup in December 2021 by the Glovers on his return to Huish Park. He played alongside Chris Lines and James Daly at Stevenage and with Jonah Ayunga at Morecambe, appearing for the latter in a 1-1 draw with Bolton Wanderers in February 2022; in September 2022 he appeared as a substitute for the final moments of Morecambe’s 2-2 draw at The Mem.\n\nNo 190. James Terence Smith. 1933-35.\n\nBorn, 12.3.1902, Old Kilpatrick, Dunbartonshire.\n\nDied, 1975, Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA.\n\n5’ 9½”; 11 st 10 lb.\n\nDébut: 30.8.33 v Crystal Palace.\n\nCareer: Dumbarton Harp Juniors; July 1925 Clydebank [28,8]; April 1926 Rangers [2,0]; May 1927 Ayr United [76,97]; 18.9.29 Liverpool (£5,500) [61,38]; July 1932 Tunbridge Wells Rangers; 8.5.33 Bristol Rovers [26,13]; 28.6.35 Newport County [26,10]; 8.6.36 Notts County [4,1]; August 1937 Dumbarton (player-manager) [46,36] (manager, 24.1.39; director, June 1941-1943).\n\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, Jimmy Smith holds the British seasonal goal-scoring record and a phenomenal performance it was too. As Duncan Carmichael has commented, “if the story of Jimmy Smith was used as the basis for footballing fiction, the publisher would doubtlessly request the writer to tone it down a bit”. The fact that he later appeared for Bristol Rovers and scored a hat-trick after six, sixty and seventy minutes in November 1934 as Rovers threw away a 5-2 lead to concede three goals in the final eight minutes of the ten-goal thriller with Exeter City appears but a minor embellishment on an exhaustingly exciting tale. Smith had made his Clydebank début in the uncharacteristically goalless draw with Aberdeen in September 1925, but showed his colours the following month with three goals as Dundee United were defeated 6-1. Alongside Rovers’ Bill Murray, he could not prevent Clydebank’s relegation from Division One, only to join Rangers who were en route to five consecutive Scottish titles, playing in 2-0 wins against Dunfermline Athletic and Hearts. However, the following campaign, which opened with Smith claiming five goals in Ayr’s trial game, smashed all records. Smith’s 72 goals included three in friendlies, one in the Ayr Charity Cup, two in the Scottish Cup and an astonishing 66 in 38 matches as United ran away with the Second Division championship. “A tireless worker and a first-class opportunist”, reported the press in Ayrshire upon his arrival at Somerset Park, “Smith, barring accidents, will score many goals for his new club”; and so indeed it proved. On the opening day, 2-1 down at half-time, Smith’s hat-trick earned a 4-4 draw at home to St Bernard’s; the following month he scored five times before half-time, four of these in a ten-minute spell, as Albion Rovers were defeated 5-3. Forfar Athletic were defeated 7-0, Smith’s three being “all well-taken goals” with Danny Tolland, himself a future Rovers player, “time after time making openings for Smith”. Further hat-tricks against Clydebank, Armadale and East Stirling, the last-mentioned including a late winner in a fortunate 3-2 victory, preceded four, two in each half, in a 6-1 thumping of Arthurlie. Away to Alloa Athletic, “Smith obtained possession of the ball in midfield and crowned a splendid solo run with a terrific drive which gave the goalkeeper no chance to save” and later added two more for another hat-trick. Leading 6-1 at half-time at home to Bathgate, Smith scored four times before the opposition rallied with their second penalty of the game to lose 7-2. Four more goals, alongside two for Tolland, marked a 7-3 victory over Arbroath in which “they played some delightful football” and, having added four more in the final home fixture, a 7-1 win against Dundee United, Smith finished the season with a consolation goal at Powderhall in a 2-1 defeat away to Leith Athletic. He had shattered all records; his club scored 117 League goals and finished nine points clear of Third Lanark. Ayr then played Sweden in May 1928 and won 3-1, Smith scoring twice, adding his ten goals in four matches on tour to his astonishing seasonal tally, being dubbed following his four goals against Ooestfold as “the British champion” by the Scandinavian press. The following campaign, now in top-flight Scottish football, he scored three and missed a penalty as Ayr lost 7-3 at Hearts, before scoring five times, four of them after the interval, as his side recovered from a 4-2 half-time deficit to defeat Partick Thistle 8-4 at Firhill. Two goals against Manchester United on his Liverpool début kick-started an equally fruitful career south of the border, Smith’s scoring at Rovers being as proficient in the League as for the reserves where, in January 1934 alone, he scored five times against Taunton Town and four times against Cheltenham Town, totalling some 24 goals for the reserves in 1933-34. In addition to his three League goals against Exeter, he also scored a hat-trick as QPR were defeated 4-1 in April 1934, but he was generally overlooked in favour of Jimmy McCambridge or Jack Havelock. He also accumulated an astonishing 68 goals in 44 Southern League appearances at Tunbridge Wells. North of the border Smith’s goal-scoring continued unabated, his first game for Dumbarton being the 4-3 victory at Brechin City in August 1937 in which he characteristically hit a hat-trick. Poor Brechin suffered again, when he scored three times in a 7-0 victory in the return fixture that December and Smith also scored three times, including two penalties, when Dunfermline Athletic were defeated 4-1 at Boghead in March 1938. His final three appearances for Dumbarton being as player-manager, he subsequently appeared for Notts County as a wartime guest, having scored for County at Crystal Palace in September 1936. Jimmy Smith emigrated to the States after the war and his son John lived for many years at 192 Alexander Avenue, Bridgeport.\n\nNo 814. Michael Smith. 2011-14.\n\nBorn, 4.9.1988, Belfast.\n\n5’ 10”; 10 st 7 lbs.\n\nDébut: 6.8.11 v AFC Wimbledon.\n\nCareer: 2006 Ballyclare Comrades; 24.1.09 Ballymena United (£5,000) [83,7]; 23.6.11 Bristol Rovers (free) [84+17,1]; 25.7.14 Peterborough United (free) [116+4,3]; 30.6.17 Heart of Midlothian (free) [124+3,4].\n\nStrong, defensive-minded Michael Smith, who joined Rovers in preference to Scottish Premier League side Kilmarnock, had represented Northern Ireland at youth, schoolboy and Under-23 levels. Half-Canadian, he had scored ten times in 92 games for Comrades and made his Ballymena début in a 2-1 home defeat against Dungannon Swifts in January 2009. The 2009-10 season saw him not only named his club’s Player of the Year and credited with the Goal of the Season, but he was also selected as Northern Ireland Sportswriters’ Player of the Year. A talented full-back and an intelligent young man, he also completed a Sports Science degree before joining Rovers. Sadly having to return to Ireland briefly following his father’s death in September 2012, Smith became an essential ingredient in Rovers’ defence, notably replacing the injured Dan Woodards after just 88 seconds against Cheltenham in October 2011 and scoring his first Rovers goal in the League Cup-tie at Ipswich in August 2012. He followed this up with a 62nd-minute goal in the home fixture with Bradford City in November 2012, the third time Rovers had taken the lead in a 3-3 draw. Solid and dependable, he was a reliable fixture in Rovers’ defensive line in 2012-13 and was deservedly named as the club’s Player of the Year. The following campaign, he was as strong as ever, becoming the club’s Player of the Year again and earning selection, along with John-Joe O’Toole into the League Two Team of the Year, yet a final day defeat at home to Mansfield Town saw Rovers’ ninety-four-year League status sacrificed. Popular at Peterborough, he scored after just eleven minutes of a 4-1 victory at Crawley in October 2014 and just before half-time of a home defeat to Rochdale in April 2016 as well as against promoted Bolton Wanderers in November 2016, but was sent off against Chesterfield in February 2016. Renewed club form earned Smith a call-up to the full Northern Ireland squad the following month for a pair of friendlies in the run-up to Euro 2016 and played in the 1-0 victory over Slovenia at Windsor Park. He was to win nineteen full caps in all and scored with a powerful twenty-five-yard shot after George Saville’s cross had been headed clear by Toni Kroos, to give his country an unlikely seventh-minute lead in Frankfurt in a Euro 2020 qualifier which Germany eventually won 6-1. Returning to oppose Rovers, his smothered shot led to Peterborough’s late winning goal in Rovers’ 2-1 home League defeat in October 2016. North of the border, Smith played in Hearts’ 4-0 victory over Celtic in December 2017, the Glaswegian side’s first defeat in 69 domestic matches, and was shown a red card in the defeat at Ibrox in October 2018. He was in the Hearts side which lost 2-1 to Celtic in the 2019 Scottish Cup Final at Hampden Park and was an unused substitute for the 2022 Final against Rangers, and scored against both Dundee and Alloa Athletic during 2020-21. In October 2022 he and Josh Ginnelly both played in an extraordinary Scottish Premier League game which, despite Lawrence Shankland’s hat-trick, was lost 4-3 at home to Celtic.\n\nNo 927. Tyler Smith. 2019-20.\n\nBorn, 4.12.1998, Sheffield.\n\n5’ 10”; 10 st 7 lbs.\n\nDébut: 3.8.19 v Blackpool.\n\nCareer: Sheffield United (professional, 1.7.17); 1.8.18 Barrow (loan); 31.12.18 Doncaster Rovers (loan) [2+12,2]; 10.7.19 Bristol Rovers (loan) [11+9,3]; 15.1.20 Rochdale (loan) [2+2,1]; 6.9.20 Swindon Town (free) [15+8,7]; 27.8.21 Hull City (free) [7+16,1].\n\nOn the day his signing was announced, striker Tyler Smith scored one of seven Rovers goals in the pre-season friendly away to Irish side St Mochta’s. It was an encouraging precursor to the forthcoming 2019-20 campaign, where he made his first appearance after fifty-five minutes at Blackpool, replacing Alex Rodman and hitting the post late on. Ten days later, two goals in eleven minutes either side of half-time and a late assist stamped his mark on a comprehensive 3-0 League Cup victory at home to Cheltenham Town. He opened his League account with an eighty-eighth-minute penalty against nine-man Tranmere Rovers the following week, scored against Gillingham and put Rovers in front at Ipswich after just four minutes in December 2019. Previously an unused substitute at Sheffield United for the game against West Bromwich Albion in December 2018, as the Blades secured promotion to the Premier League in 2019, Smith had been sent out on two loan spells that campaign. Having scored twice against Chesterfield in the Conference in August 2018, during his successful stint at Barrow, in which he scored ten times in 23 matches, he made a dramatic start to his time at Donny. Arriving on the pitch as a half-time substitute for Mallik Wilks against Burton Albion in January 2019, his two goals in twenty minutes swiftly turned an imminent defeat into a 2-1 lead, before the Brewers snatched a late equaliser. Thereafter, goals did not materialise, although he did play the final eight minutes of their 4-1 victory over the Gas at The Keepmoat in March 2019, replacing Kieran Sadlier. “He’s a great lad, lovely smile but he stabs defenders with goals. We call him the Toothy Murderer because Smiling Assassin had already been taken. Imagine Didier Drogba, Fred West and Dr Teeth merged into one, that’s our Tyler”, was how Blades’ manager Chris Wilder described Smith to the press. Smith scored for Rochdale against Shrewsbury Town in February 2020 and contributed four first-half goals on his first Swindon appearance, in a pre-season friendly with Nuneaton Town. Although he added a goal on his League bow for the Robins, Swindon were relegated along with Rovers from League One that campaign and Smith joined second-tier Hull City, for whom he headed a goal after just forty-five seconds, from George Honeyman’s free-kick against top-flight Everton in the FA Cup in January 2022; he also scored a League goal against Peterborough United the following month. Tyler Smith’s Bermudan-born younger brother Kyron Gordon plays for Sheffield United.\n\nNo 430. Wilfred Samuel Smith. 1974-77.\n\nBorn, 3.9.1946, Neumünster, Germany.\n\n5’ 10”; 11 st 3 lbs.\n\nDébut: 11.3.75 v Fulham.\n\nCareer: Pipworth Road School; Sheffield Boys; November 1962 Sheffield Wednesday (professional, 4.9.63) [206,4]; 31.8.70 Coventry City (£100,000) [132+3,1]; 14.10.74 Brighton (loan) [5,0]; 16.1.75 Millwall (loan) [5,0]; 4.3.75 Bristol Rovers (£25,000) [54,2]; November 1976 Chesterfield [26+1,2]; December 1977 Atherstone Town.\n\nBorn Wilfred (or possibly Wolfgang) Schmidt, to an English father and German mother in a town in Schleswig-Holstein, some forty miles north of Hamburg, reliable right-back Wilf Smith anglicised his name on arrival in Yorkshire as a child. The young man excelled at swimming, cricket and football. Captain of Sheffield Boys, he also captained England Youth, won six caps for the England Under-23 side and represented the Football League on three occasions between 1967 and 1970. The first full-back to be transferred in the Football League for a £100,000 fee, he had experienced top-flight football at Wednesday as a team-mate of Alan Warboys and Don Megson, who signed him for Rovers. The highlight of Smith’s stay at Hillsborough was undeniably an appearance in the 1966 FA Cup Final, where a 100,000 crowd was treated to a hugely enjoyable game. “Here was a match in which there was no loser and where the game of football itself was the winner”, purred The Times, “Sheffield, indeed, seemed to have all the time in the world to go about their business of upsetting the favourites, like Walter Hammond batting on a turning wicket”. Despite this reference to an inter-war Rovers player, Wednesday could not hold on to a two-goal lead inside 57 minutes, in a match controlled by 1974 World Cup Final referee Jack Taylor; proving too strong, Everton won the prestigious trophy with three goals in the final fifteen minutes and Wednesday were accorded the honour of being the first losing side to perform a Wembley lap of honour. Working under Megson at Eastville, he played in each of the side’s first three seasons back in Division Two and scored in a 4-1 win at Blackpool in October 1975 and a 4-2 defeat at Carlisle over Easter 1976. Equally, he scored in Chesterfield’s home fixtures against Port Vale and Oxford United in the spring of 1977. Retiring from football to open supermarkets in Nuneaton and Blaby, his empire increased to seven retail outlets and Smith, reputed to be a millionaire as a result of his business work, now lives in retirement in Leicestershire.\n\nNo 743. Louie Pierre James Soares. 2004-05.\n\nBorn, 8.1.1985, Reading.\n\n5’ 11”; 13 st 3 lbs.\n\nDébut: 7.5.05 v Wycombe Wanderers.\n\nCareer: Reading (professional, 1.7.04); 4.3.05 Tamworth (loan); 6.5.05 Bristol Rovers (loan) [0+1,0]; 1.8.05 Barnet (free) [14+6,1]; 24.5.06 Aldershot Town (free) [58+13,10]; 22.7.10 Southend United (free) [17+14,0]; 3.7.11 Hayes and Yeading; 31.1.12 Grimsby Town (free); 26.10.12 Ebbsfleet United (loan); 18.1.13 Alfreton Town (loan); 31.7.13 Hayes and Yeading United (trial); 6.9.13 Hayes and Yeading United (free); 26.12.13 Basingstoke Town (free); 30.6.16 Oxford City (free); 22.9.16 Hungerford Town (free); 15.6.18 Slough Town (free); 25.6.19 Hampton and Richmond Borough (free); 24.1.20 Slough Town (free); 26.2.20 Bracknell Town (free); 2.3.21 Flackwell Heath (free).\n\nRovers were given special dispensation to sign three extra players prior to the final match of the 2004-05 season, one of these being Louie Soares, who spent one minute on the pitch, the shortest Rovers career on record. The elder brother of Tom Soares of Crystal Palace, Stoke City and Bury, Louie Soares enjoyed a career primarily in Conference football, but also won two full caps for Barbados, scoring on his début against Trinidad and Tobago in January 2007. With a yellow card on his début against Dagenham and Redbridge, he appeared in 5(+1) Conference games with Tamworth and was an unused substitute in Barnet’s first game back in the Football League, against Rovers in August 2005. A right-sided midfielder, he appeared at Old Trafford in the League Cup in October 2005, but was substituted after just 86 seconds, as a tactical substitution in the aftermath of goalkeeper Ross Flitney’s red card for perceived deliberate handball. The following month, his left-footed cross from the right wing led to Barnet’s consolation goal at The Mem and he later played for Aldershot against Rovers in the League Cup in August 2009, totalling 120(+27) Conference and Football League games for the Hampshire club and scoring seventeen goals, many of these fixtures as a team-mate of Andy Sandell. Champions under Gary Waddock of the Conference in 2007-08, the Shots returned to the Football League and made the League Two play-offs in 2009-10. Thereafter, he scored fifteen goals in 31 Conference matches in his first spell with Hayes and played in 9(+6) Conference matches for Grimsby as well as 7(+1) at Ebbsfleet. A run of 10(+8) Conference games with Alfreton included goals in the fixtures at Braintree and at Tamworth. Returning to Hayes, he added three goals in 7(+2) Conference South matches, although the side was relegated from that division in 2013-14 and scored against Farnborough on his Basingstoke début, before contributing the winning goal in April 2014 as Staines Town were defeated 5-4, totalling twelve goals in 86(+17) Conference South appearances over eighteen months. Town reached the play-offs in their division in the spring of 2015, where they lost over two legs to Whitehawk, but suffered relegation in the spring of 2016, Soares being named as the Dragons’ Player of the Season. After 7(+1) Nationwide North games for Oxford City and a goal against Concord Rangers, he scored twenty times in 60(+8) matches as Hungerford missed the play-offs by a point in the same division. He scored a hat-trick in the 3-1 victory over St Albans City in March 2018 and added one goal in 10(+15) Nationwide South games for Slough in 2018-19; he also played in the 2019 Berks and Bucks Senior Cup Final, a 3-1 victory over Reading Under-23s. At Hampton and Richmond, he appeared in 5(+13) Nationwide South games, scoring against Oxford City and Braintree Town, and he played in five Isthmian League matches at Bracknell Town.\n\nNo 745. Matthew James Somner. 2005-06.\n\nBorn, 8.12.1982, Isleworth, London.\n\n6’; 13 st 1 lb.\n\nDébut: 9.8.05 v Grimsby Town.\n\nCareer: Brentford (professional, 1.8.00) [72+12,1]; 1.12.04 Cambridge United (loan) [24,0]; 5.8.05 Bristol Rovers (free) [1,0]; 19.8.05 Aldershot Town (free); 16.6.06 Notts County (free) [47+7,1]; 1.8.08 Mansfield Town (free); 14.10.10 Altrincham (loan); 31.1.11 Forest Green Rovers (free); 2.7.11 Lewes (free); 17.8.12 Kingstonian (free); 15.11.13 Crawley Down Gatwick (loan); 27.7.15 Walton Casuals (free); 9.3.16 Walton and Hersham (free).\n\nTall defensive player Matt Somner appeared in Rovers’ side which lost 2-1 at home to Grimsby, before a crowd of 6,300, and was in the Cambridge team which drew 1-1 in Horfield in January 2005. The son of Peter Somner and Deborah Lagden, he qualified to play for Wales and, as a Welsh Under-21 international, the first of his two caps came alongside Kevin Gall and David Pipe in the 8-1 defeat by Italy in Pavia in September 2003, in which Alberto Gilardino scored four times. Primarily used as a left-back at Griffin Park, where his May 2001 début ended up as a 6-0 defeat against Swansea, Somner was sent off in Brentford’s 4-3 win against Doncaster Rovers in August 2004, just seven minutes after coming on to the pitch as a substitute, as well as for Notts County at MK Dons in September 2006 and Mansfield against Forest Green Rovers and Crawley Town. Although he scored for Brentford in the FA Cup at Wycombe, Somner’s sole League goal for the Bees was the opener in a 3-0 victory over Northampton Town in March 2003 and he also appeared in a 7-1 FA Cup victory over Gainsborough Trinity that calendar year. His Notts County goal was twenty minutes from the end of a 2-0 win against Boston United in April 2007 and he scored once, against Eastbourne, in 58(+6) Conference games with Mansfield. To his 29(+2) Conference games and three goals with Aldershot can be added nine appearances for Altrincham and 14(+2) matches with Forest Green, plus a final-day-of-the-season goal against Tamworth. Alongside Craig Armstrong in the Forest Green side which survived relegation from the Conference on goal difference, Somner later played 45 games for Lewes, his two goals being headers in cup-ties against Sudbury Town and Chertsey. Appointed club captain at Kingstonian, he played in 41(+4) games, scoring in March 2013 against both Enfield Town and in a 1-0 victory away to Hampton and Richmond Borough, although he also received a red card in the latter game. After retiring from the game, Matt Somner helped co-ordinate sending former professionals around schools in the East Midlands to encourage youngsters to take up football.\n\nNo 974. Sion Spence. 2021-22.\n\nBorn, 2.10.2000, Penarth.\n\n5’ 10”; 11 st 1 lb.\n\nDébut: 25.9.21 v Walsall.\n\nCareer: Cardiff and Vale School; 2008 Cardiff City; 2.9.19 Barry Town United (loan); 18.9.20 Crystal Palace (free); 9.7.21 Bristol Rovers (loan) [1+5,1]; 6.7.22 Walsall (trial); 27.7.22 Gloucester City (trial); 4.8.22 Gloucester City (free).\n\nWithout a win away from home all calendar year, Rovers were draing 1-1 at Walsall into stoppage time in September 2021, when injury led to Siôn Spence making a late début; within moments, the young Welshman had a shot saved before turning home Brett Pitman’s cross for the winning goal, sparking wild celebrations amongst over a thousand Rovers supporters behind the goal. Two months later, Rovers trailed higher-tier Oxford United 3-1 in extra time of an FA Cup replay at The Mem; Spence was used as a late substitute and scored twice as Rovers found three goals in eight minutes to win a dramatic match. The season arguably hinged on this, Rovers experiencing an upturn in fortunes and promotion to League One followed, although Spence was not in the side by this stage. As highlighted by an impressive hat-trick for Palace’s youth side in a 4-0 victory over Norwich City in February 2021, Spence had joined Rovers with a burgeoning reputation. The young attacking midfielder had been at school with Welsh international Rabbi Matondo and rose through the ranks at Cardiff, alongside Martyn Margetson’s son Ben as well as Rollin Menayese. He helped Cardiff win the KGHM International Cup in Lubin in June 2016 before making his first appearance for their youth side in a 3-1 victory over Coventry City in December of that year. During 2017-18 he made his mark with 29 goals, being the top scorer in Premier League Two as well as Cardiff’s Academy Player of the Year and scoring hat-tricks in a 3-0 win at Ipswich in October 2017 and in a 4-3 defeat at the hands of Millwall the following month. A Liverpool supporter, he scored eleven goals in fifteen games during an injury-hit 2018-19 campaign, as Cardiff won the Under-23 title. Having scored for the Wales Under-16 in a 3-1 Victory Shield win against Northern Ireland in 2016, Spence scored once in seven games for Wales at Under-19 level and won the first of his five Welsh Under-21 caps in a 5-0 loss to Belgium in October 2020. He was sent off when Wales Under-21 played Moldova in June 2021, apparently for simulation although he had to be stretchered off the field, and played for Wales Under-21 in the 5-0 victory over the Netherlands in October 2021. Released by Cardiff, he spent a year with Palace, making his first appearance for their Academy side in a 4-1 defeat at Leeds United in November 2020, before arriving at The Mem on loan.\n\nNo 504.
