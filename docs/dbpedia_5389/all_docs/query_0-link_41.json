        "text": "100 Poems to Save the Earth\n\nOur climate is on the brink of catastrophic change. 100 Poems to Save the Earth invites us to fine-tune our senses, to listen to the world around us, pay attention to what we have been missing. The defining crisis of our time is revealed to be fundamentally a crisis of perception. For too long, the earth has been exploited. With its incisive Foreword, this landmark anthology is a call to action to fight the threat facing the only planet we have.\n\nWriting from rural and urban perspectives, linking issues of social injustice with the need to protect the environment, this selection of renowned contemporary poets from Britain, Ireland, America and beyond attend carefully to the new evidence, redraw the maps and, full of trust, keep going, proving that in fact, poetry is exactly what we need to save the earth.\n\n“This compelling suite of poems is a timely reminder to cherish, to celebrate. What could be more enjoyable than beautiful poems about this beautiful planet? This collection is immediate, moving, wise and unforgettable as it is unputdownable!” – Daljit Nagra, poet and presenter of BBC Radio 4’s Poetry Extra\n\n“These achingly beautiful poems, from a range of stellar talents, animate and explore the sometimes-frayed connection we have with our precious planet and remind us how to refind ourselves amid the landscape we call home.” – Sonya Huber, author of Pain Woman Takes Your Keys\n\n“Wales was the first country in the world to introduce a Future Generations Act. This collection of Poems to Save the Earth from a Welsh Publisher reminds us that poetry and art can also be a vital part of a sustainable future.” – Mark Drakeford, First Minister of Wales\n\n“…it is an absolute necessity for poets to celebrate our world and engage with its future. This is a marvellous compendium to show how they are attempting this…” – Robert Minhinnick\n\nFeaturing 100 of the best new and established contemporary poets:\n\nGbenga Adesina, Kelli Russell Agodon, Sascha Akhtar, Kazim Ali, Mir Mahfuz Ali, Abeer Ameer, Simon Armitage, David Baker, Fiona Benson, Liz Berry, Wendell Berry, Rachael Boast, Eavan Boland, Leo Boix, Sean Bonney, Marianne Boruch, Helen Bowell, Elizabeth-Jane Burnett, Jane Burn, John Burnside, Dom Bury, Duncan Bush, Siobhán Campbell, Vahni Capildeo, Gillian Clarke, Ross NR Cogan, Grahame Davies, Tishani Doshi, Cath Drake, Camille T Dungy, Rhian Edwards, Carrie Etter, Vievee Francis, Izzy Galleymore, Ross Gay, WS Graham, Vona Groarke, Philip Gross, Richard Gwyn, Jen Hadfield, Paul Henry, Sean Hewitt, Bob Hicok, Jane Hirshfield, Rhiannon Hooson, Jennifer Hunt, Kathleen Jamie, John Kinsella, Mimi Khalvati, Joanna Klink, Gwyneth Lewis, Gerry Loose, Jane Lovell, John McCullough, Medbh McGuckian, André Mangeot, Paula Meehan, Jennifer Militello, Kei Miller, Robert Minhinnick, David Morley, Katrina Naomi, Aimee Nezhukumatathil, Caitríona O’Reilly, Alice Oswald, Craig Santos Perez, Pascale Petit, Carl Phillips, Clare Pollard, Kate Potts, Sheenagh Pugh, Sina Queyras, Vidyan Ravinthiran, Deryn Rees-Jones, Carter Revard, Roger Robinson, Erin Robinsong, Carol Rumens, Owen Sheers, Penelope Shuttle, Colin Simms, Peter Sirr, Martha Sprackland, Anne Stevenson, Em Strang, Will Stone, Melissa Studdard, Michael Symmons Roberts, George Szirtes, Rebecca Tamás Marvin Thompson, Samuel Tongue, Ellen Van Neerven, Maggie Wang, Gwen Nell Westerman, Sam Wilson Fletcher, Jillian Weise, Jennifer Wong, Tamar Yoseloff, Nidhi Zak/Aria Eipe.\n\n163 Days\n\nWinner of Wordsworth Prize for Literature & Poetry at Lakeland Book of the Year 2023\n\nLonglisted for the Barbellion Prize\n\nHighly Commended in the Forward Prize\n\n“Hannah Hodgson takes us to the paradoxical heart of poetry itself: to be held inside a pain both intensified and soothed by the sheer brilliant presence of the poet’s mind.” – Caroline Bird\n\nHannah Hodgon is an award-winning poet and a palliative care patient. In her compelling debut collection 163 Days, she uses a panoply of medical, legal, and personal vocabularies to explore what illness, death and dying does to a person as both patient and witness.\n\n163 Days is the length of Hannah’s longest period of hospitalisation to date. In this long poem, she probes various truths, personal and medical; truths which clash like a tray of dropped instruments in a silent operating theatre.\n\nThe speaker is a teenager on the cusp of adulthood. Doctors struggle to diagnose her complex conditions. Through daily, diary-like poems we see the children’s ward through Hannah’s eyes. It is decked out in primary colours. Volunteer clowns visit. At seventeen she is ‘too old’ to be here, ‘too young’ to move to the adult ward.\n\nThe mundanity of hospital life is marbled by a changing landscape of mood, hope and loss. Her symptoms are painful. She has numerous tests and procedures to keep her alive long enough to figure out what’s wrong. A gap yawns between the person she is, and the person in her medical notes.\n\nIn ‘Aftercare’, Hannah navigates the worlds of both nightclubs and hospice care as she embarks on a new version of her life as a disabled adult. 163 Days is an important collection, in which Hodgson’s true voice takes poetry into difficult places.\n\n2001 A Year in Wales\n\nThe sound of laughter is rarely far away as Patrick Hannan watches the events of 2001 unfold and describes them in this chronicle of a year in Wales. The result is a revealing picture of the kind of country Wales now is, its obsessions, its ambitions, its divisions, and the nature of the people who run it or want to run it. The fury over English views of the Welsh and Welsh views of the English, the huge gap between aspiration and achievement when it comes to erecting buildings or playing rugby, political jealousies, and the private nature of modern Wales is explored.\n\nA Boat Called Annalise\n\n‘A Boat Called Annalise is a triumphant collection of poetry, marking a new embarkation for Hjelmgaard as a poet. It’s a collection which can be read time and time again, and will especially be appreciated by readers looking for new beginnings, those experiencing life’s traumas and working through the healing process called grief.’ – Wales Arts Review\n\n‘This collection invites you to meet Lynne Hjelmgaard and share part of her journey. It’s a worthwhile trip.’ – Orbis\n\nA Boat Called Annalise, Lynne Hjelmgaard’s new poetry collection, is wonderfully evocative of life on a sailboat: “Still, Annalise has that smell: slightly honeyed, rusty cans, soapy rags, brewed coffee, a whole cinnamon in a drawer”. The book recalls a journey this much-travelled author took on a sailboat to the Caribbean and back to Europe with her husband. In the first section, we are with the author as she gets her ‘sea legs’. The couple’s relationship is poised on tensions, beautifully observed, as masculine/ feminine, the need to assert and/or withdraw in the face of the turbulent seascape.\n\nLife at sea contrasts with the tropical beauties of their dream-like destination. We breathe a sigh of relief, as the author does, when we catch sight of our destination on the horizon, ‘Through Binoculars I see a Turquoise Harbour’. We are then given life on the island and a number of insights into both the gorgeous vegetation and exotic insect “A stick that grew wings and flew away” and animal life and into the locals, as in ‘Island Gossip’. We also sense the author’s growing awareness of a tainted paradise: the lavish lives of Honeymooners and tourists side-by-side with the poverty of the native west-Indians.\n\nInevitably, there is a retreat. The author sails back to other ‘mainlands’ in Europe and the USA and we learn that as life goes on in various cities, the husband also dies of an illness, leading the author-protagonist back to her recollections of their voyage to the islands and to some of the halcyon days of their marriage. The author reflects back on her life and we recall the epigraph to the book, a quote from The Odyssey: ‘You must take up your well-shaped oar and go on a journey until you come where there are men living who know nothing of the sea.’\n\nIn the final section of the book, the tone becomes movingly elegiac. There is indeed a return to the islands and further reflections on life there. “The tamarind have all but disappeared. /Trade winds occupy our house on the hill.” Other bereavements incite reflections on mortality and happiness. Hjelmgaard’s poems are beautifully poised, full of clear-eyed and frequently humorous observations. Her work is full of sentiment without being sentimental. Readers will enjoy their trip on A Boat Called Annalise.\n\nA Casual Life in Six T-shirts\n\n‘Six life-changing, raging and inspiring XL shirts – a soundtrack to growing up and living in Wales is more than just the records. A brilliant book.” – Rhys Mwyn\n\nThis is no ordinary memoir.\n\nEuron Griffith has lied to David Cassidy, seen his dreams of pop stardom being torn to shreds (quite literally) by the crowds at Glastonbury, and found himself at the wrong end of a shotgun…\n\nAn avid music fan from a young age, A Casual Life is centred around six particularly memorable band T-shirts owned by Griffith as he grew older (but not necessarily wiser).\n\nFrom the disastrous first (and last) gig by his debut band, through to his eventual deal with a major label, from life growing up in pre-internet north Wales (when even pop radio couldn’t make it past the mountains) to the smoky clubs of Soho, this is a story of how music gets into the soul and how it helps us cope with all life throws our way.\n\nYou may not have been there.\n\nYou may not have the T-shirts.\n\nBut now, at least, you can read all about it.\n\nA Certain Marvellous Thing\n\nIn his first collection of poetry since 1984, John Powell Ward breaks new ground. These are edgy, urgent, relevant poems. The new forms are varied, radical and playful. Ward has moved from the pastoral pleasures of his last book, The Clearing towards a new sensibility, one concerned about the state of the world that our children will inherit and interested in the options that language can give us to explore and influence our times.\n\nThe book features several elegies such as ’Elegiac’ and ’Elegy for the Accidental Dead’ – sensitive explorations of our fragile mortality. Other poems are alarmed at the mechanical travel that shrinks the world, the vulnerability of the unprotected, and the poet’s own unwilling complicity with it all. Yet a counterpoint spirituality pervades. Old myths and visions survive and a redeeming light shines on unexpected places; through the camera, on the motorway, or on the alphabet itself. The poems in A Certain Marvellous Thing show a comprehensive intelligence confronting the deep obsessions of modern life, secular, planetary and religious.\n\nA City Burning\n\nLonglisted for the Edge Hill Short Story Prize 2021\n\nA city burns in a crisis − because the status quo has collapsed and change must come. Every value, relationship and belief is shaken and the future is uncertain.\n\nIn the twenty-six stories in A City Burning, set in Wales, Northern Ireland and Italy, children and adults face, in the flames of personal tragedy, moments of potential transformation. On the threshold of their futures each must make a choice: how to live in this new ‘now’. Some of these moments occur in mundane circumstances, others amidst tragedy or drama.\n\nWaiting for the return of demoralized prisoners of war, an Italian is offered a shocking way to rebuild his world; on the Antrim coastline a man is pushed to the edge by the demons of his neurotic family; in the south Wales valleys during the pandemic a domiciliary carer flounders in the front line of the workers’ struggle. A teenager disheartened by a Covid future; a terrorist in love; a vindictive clergyman; an actor interrogating her role for light on her own hampered life. They are ordinary people caught at crisis point, each rendered with a fierce perception of injustice and brutality.\n\nBut there is lyricism too, wry humour and a sharp engagement with language – Italian, Ulster Scots, Welsh. As well as meeting protagonists in their own countries, we find the Irish in Italy, the Italians in Wales, the Welsh in Northern Ireland.\n\nA cinematic sense of focus and place grounds the action: a dry-as-dust bookshop provides a sensual encounter stimulated by the dead; two young priests in a Vatican kitchen collide erotically; nemesis strikes − from the skies − in a hospital corridor.\n\nWith a virtuoso control of tone, by turns elegiac, comic, lyrical, philosophical, A City Burning examines power of all types, exploring conflicts between political allegiances; between autonomy and intimacy; emotional display and concealment; resistance versus acceptance. The result is a deeply human book full of hauntingly memorable characters and narratives.\n\nRewatch the launch of A City Burning below:\n\nA Clwyd Anthology\n\nFrom the Airbus at Broughton to the castle at Rhuddlan; from the resorts of the coast to the International Eisteddfod at Llangollen; from the farms of the Vales to the mountains of Hiraethog; from the English of Wrexham to the Welsh of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, the county of Clwyd – the soon to disappear Clwyd – encompasses hugely differing cultures within its boundaries.\n\nNatives and visitors, from the seventeenth century to the present day, have found Clwyd an unfailing source of inspiration. This anthology collects their writing to provide a fascinating commentary on life in the county, recording the events, the history and the people. As this century has progressed change has been the key note: agriculture has declined, collieries and steelmaking have come and gone, and tourism is the latest growth industry; religion too has declined from its medieval pre-eminence; old county towns like Denbeigh have been eclipsed by burgeoning Wrexham and Rhyl. Editor Dewi Roberts has produced an anthology which defines what it is to live in Clwyd.\n\nA Darker Way\n\nGrahame Davies’s A Darker Way is a second volume after a well-received debut. The collection of poems and songs which traces a hard-won but redemptive path between idealism and irony, failure and faith. Davies is a poet in the bardic tradition who speaks to and for the community, exploring what it is to be human.\n\nDavies is renowned, not only as a poet, but as a lyricist for some of the world’s best-known composers and soloists. His work has been broadcast to millions internationally, including during King Charles’s Coronation in the soprano solo ‘Sacred Fire’. English composer and impresario, Andrew Lloyd Webber, described the work as ‘mesmerising’ and journalist and film-maker Robert Hardman called it ‘exquisite’. Dealing with love and loss with both realism and compassion, Davies’s lyrics explore belief and unbelief, meaning and mystery, speaking for a contemporary sensibility wearied by supposed certainties yet longing for a sense of significance.\n\nA Darker Way also includes work arising from Davies’s Welsh roots. For example, ‘Wrth Ddŵr a Thân’ (‘By Water and Fire’) was commissioned by the Senedd for its 2016 opening and references the Pierhead Building’s mural ‘Wrth Ddŵr a Thân’, commemorating the country’s coal, steel and maritime industries.\n\nThe moving sequence ‘Aberfan’ memorialises the deaths of 144 people including 116 children, in the Aberfan Disaster of October 21, 1966. Davies, who played a role in the 20th and 50th anniversary events, revisits the tragedy, responding to historic pictures of the town taken in the days after the disaster by Life magazine photographer I.C. ‘Chuck’ Rapoport.\n\nDavies’s work has been compared to that of Philip Larkin, alert to both the superficiality and the seriousness of the everyday. These poems are curious about people, such as the local characters in poems like ‘Speedway Eddie’ or ‘Happy Larry’s Funeral’, whose lives challenge our conventions and our assumptions. Davies’s poems often show that human feelings are complicated and surprising. In ‘One Human Soul’, a mysterious graffito prompts troubling self-questioning, in ‘Diaries’ a house move unearths memories the speaker can scarcely bear to confront, while in ‘Colleague’ an unexpected encounter with a former fellow worker reveals unsuspected depths.\n\nThe spiritual, even the supernatural, is never far from the surface in these poems, but Davies never settles for the simplistic. Belief and unbelief are held in a creative tension, as the poet faces ‘a mystery all the greater for the answer / a darkness all the deeper for the star.’\n\nBeing a poet seems to demand taking that ‘darker way’ close to the precariousness of life, but Davies’ quiet, unassuming style is powerful, moving, and redemptive.\n\nA Dissident Voice\n\nIn his fourth collection of poems Mike Jenkins addresses issues of the greatest concern to us in the nineties. His subjects include South Africa, Chile, the Falklands War, Northern Ireland, economic dereliction, the environment and sexual oppression. The ‘dissident voice’ of the title belongs to anti-nuclear campaigner Hilda Murrell, who died in such mysterious circumstances.\n\nMike Jenkins’s poetry of issues is also a poetry of ordinary people. Often writing in character, he brings vividly to life the problems and dilemmas which face us daily. Through the rich imagery of these poems we come to see the human values and rights which we must exercise and defend in a civilised society.\n\nA Fold in the River\n\nA Fold in the River is the fruit of collaboration between T.S. Eliot prize-winning poet Philip Gross and the visual artist Valerie Coffin Price. Philip Gross once lived on the banks of the River Taff in Wales and his journals are the source for the powerful poems. Valerie Coffin Price revisited the walking route along the river and evolved the beautiful prints and drawings that accompany the poems.\n\nListen to Philip Gross read his poem, ‘Pour’:\n\nA Formula for Night: New and Selected Poems\n\n‘A Formula for Night is a significant journey for both the poet and the reader. Take it.’ – DURA\n\nTamar Yoseloff is a poet whose career has been profoundly influenced by the visual arts. A Formula for Night: New and Selected Poems is the eagerly awaited summation of her work, encompassing selections from four published print volumes: Sweetheart, Barnard’s Star, Fetch and The City with Horns (now mostly out of print); and poems from her collaborations with artists: Formerly, Marks and Desire Paths. The book also includes a generous selection of beautiful new poems. The title poem is based upon an installation by Welsh artist Cerith Wyn Evans. An image from his work, a light sculpture, is used for the cover of the book.\n\nThe poet’s first collection, Sweetheart, was a PBS Special Commendation and the winner of the Jerwood/Aldeburgh First Collection Prize. She was the recipient of an Arts Council New Writing award which helped her complete her second manuscript, later published as Barnard’s Star. Of her collaborations, Marks was published as a limited-edition artist’s book and pamphlet by Pratt Contemporary Art in 2007. Desire Paths was a limited-edition portfolio produced by Galerie Hein Elferink in the Netherlands. Both books feature work by artist Linda Karshan.\n\nMore recently, Formerly, a chapbook of poems based on forgotten London locations, with accompanying photographs by Vici MacDonald, was the debut publication of their co-founded imprint, Hercules Editions. Formerly was shortlisted for the Ted Hughes Award in 2012. Exhibitions of the poems and photographs have appeared in two venues in London: the Poetry Society’s Poetry Café and the Saison Poetry Library at the Southbank.\n\nThe new poems are often artful explorations of paradox: death/birth, dark/light, clarity/mystery. In the ‘Swimmer of Lethe’ the protagonist says: ‘I’ve mastered surface/ here everything is under.’ Atmospheres are conjured, surfaces interrogated and humans are often found woefully or wonderfully implicated in their settings in unexpected ways. A misunderstood creature, the ‘Muntjac’, is seen with tender clarity ‘Now white with May/tar and fern on his delicate hooves…’. The poet’s vocabulary is spikey, sometimes ferociously so. Sex is another paradox, its violence at times palpable: from ‘Pictures of Spring’: ‘I bend and break, bend/ and break, contort my limbs/ into these lovelocked shapes.’ ‘Hospital Time’: ‘collapses, folds the days into sterile gauze,/ a thousand different words for hurt’ beautifully evokes the estranging, atmosphere of a hospital but slowly evolves to become a moving elegy to the poet’s mother.\n\nA Hardy Breed\n\nA Hardy Breed is a collection of 120 photographs, mainly black and white, celebrating shepherding and sheep farming in Wales. It records a way of life under pressure for the past couple of centuries, and more than ever today. The book is an important social document, of reportage, portraiture and documentary photography of an industry threatened by the outcomes of Brexit and other issues, like climate change, biodiversity, agricultural developments. Importantly, many of the communities featured are centres of Welsh language and culture, also under pressure.\n\nAbove all though, it is a book with heart. Cardwell’s text discusses the many issues facing farmers and includes interviews with the subjects of some of the images. His photographs offer stunning landscapes and intimate peeks into the distinctive work and lives of sheep farmers, shepherds and their dogs. Here is an insight into a singular society, of farming, shearing, shows, markets and mountains.\n\nThe photographs are from Bruce Cardwell’s ‘Calon Wlan’ exhibition at Aberystwyth Arts Centre, which was purchased in its entirety by the National Library of Wales.\n\nA Last Respect\n\nA Last Respect celebrates the Roland Mathias Prize, awarded to outstanding poetry books by authors from Wales. It presents a selection of work from all eleven prize-winning books, by Dannie Abse, Tiffany Atkinson, Ruth Bidgood, Ailbhe Darcy, Rhian Edwards, Christine Evans, John Freeman, Philip Gross, Gwyneth Lewis, Robert Minhinnick, and Owen Sheers. It is a who’s who of contemporary poetry which shows the form in good health in Wales.\n\nThe fifty-four poems included are wide-ranging in style and subject – relationships, nature, environmental issues, mortality, time, war, Wales, poetry itself, even the minefield of parents’ evenings. They are inventive, experimental, formal, original and, as prize-winners, of the highest quality.\n\nTwo accompanying essays provide the context in which the poets work. In her Introduction, Jane Aaron writes about Roland Mathias: a poet himself, but also an influential editor and cultural commentator who did much to foster and develop poetry in Wales. A Last Respect is a continuation of his legacy. Daniel G. Williams’ Afterword is an incisive discussion about poetry in Wales over the past sixty years: where it started from and how it changed.\n\nThis combination of prizewinning poems and informative commentary makes A Last Respect a must-have book of writing from Wales.\n\nA Militant Muse\n\nHarri Webb (1920-1994) was not only one of the most popular poets in Wales but also a plangent cultural commentator. He wrote extensively on literary and political subjects for more than three decades, in the Western Mail and several magazines.\n\nWriting from the political left (be it the Labour Party or Plaid Cymru), Harri Webb was impatient with the Welsh Establishment and the London Welsh and his tone was often critical. The hallmark of his essays and reviews was a pungent style designed to provoke. The selection here dates from the post-war optimism of 1948 and an essay on the perennial issue of a national theatre for Wales to 1980 and an article for the Radio Times on pit closures. By this time Webb, deflated by the Devolution referendum vote, had begun to despair that the changes he sought would ever be made. In between these two dates Webb’s essays chart many of the cultural debates taking place in his country, debates to which he made a telling and entertaining contribution.\n\nA Night on the Lash\n\nLike a painter, Graham Mort builds through a steady accumulation of precise and beautifully-observed details. The pictures that emerge are often surprising, even shocking in their effects. Mort is adept at imbuing a landscape with the moods and memories of its inhabitants. Touching, thoughtful and articulate, A Night on the Lash confirms his reputation as an exceptionally gifted poet.\n\nA People’s Poetry (trans)\n\nHen benillion (literally ’old verses’) are a unique form of folk poetry in Britain. Dating from the sixteenth century and earlier these short verses, or chains of verses, were composed to be spoken or sung to a harp accompaniment. They have been performed at social gatherings in Wales for centuries, enriching the collective public memory with their mix of proverbs, saws, catchphrases and commentary on local events and characters. They are, quite literally, a people’s poetry, and regular reciters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries would have repertoires in the hundreds. Written in free, as opposed to the traditional fixed metres, penillion were deemed for many years to be of transitory importance and it was only the eighteenth century Celtic antiquarian movement that preserved those which survive today.\n\nThis volume collects the translations and original Welsh texts of 315 of these verses, the result of fifty years work by Glyn Jones, the popular poet and novelist who wrote almost entirely in the English language. As a fine translator and an enthusiastic advocate for the interaction of Wales’s two literatures, A People’s Poetry is a fitting tribute to his efforts in this area.\n\nA Place of Meadows and Tall Trees\n\nImpoverished and oppressed, they’d been promised paradise on earth: a land flowing with milk and honey. But what the settlers found after a devastating sea journey was a cold South American desert where nothing could survive except tribes of nomadic Tehuelche Indians, possibly intent on massacring them.\n\nSilas James fears he has been tricked into sacrificing everything he loves for another man’s impossible dream. But despite his hatred of the politically adept Edwyn Owen, and under the watchful eye of Indian shaman Yelue, a new culture takes root as an old one passes away.\n\nA Place of Meadows and Tall Trees is a lyrical and insightful evocation of the trials of the first Welsh Patagonian colonists as they battle to survive hunger, loss, and each other.\n\nA Ride Through The Wood\n\nIn collecting these essays Roland Mathias uses for his subjects the symbol of a wood, virtually unexplored, and until recently considered to be on the edge of a map of English literature. Mathias, as he puts it, is in ‘possession of a different map, one on which the wood appears much closer to the centre’, and A Ride Through the Wood is an unusual selection of essays on Anglo-Welsh writers by a critic who shares their particular background and is knowledgeable about it.\n\nA Second Whisper\n\nA Second Whisper is a thoughtful and sensitive collection that reflects the changing identities of a woman: in motherhood, in widowhood, in friendship and grief. There are elegies to the loss in 2014 of her mentor and partner, the poet Dannie Abse which are a tribute to their deep friendship. There are also poems to her late husband who died in 2006 and for their children and for relationships from the author’s past in New York City and Denmark. The poems are both elegiac and celebratory: they move and change tone as the author travels to the past and negotiates through the geography of grief and feelings of displacement in London, and finally opens to her new life in the present.\n\nA Short Book About Love\n\nLove in all its guises is the subject of Nick Murray’s wise and witty A Short Book About Love. Woven into a comic re-telling of the classic legend of Tristan and Iseult – one of the world’s greatest love stories – is the story of Felix, growing up in post-war Liverpool and, in the wake of a father’s death, trying to come to terms with the meaning of what Philip Larkin, called ’that much-mentioned brilliance, love’.\n\nIn between are narratives, playful and serious, on the irresistible topic. This sparkling pocket-epic spans the globe, from Greece to Italy, from China to Russia, offering walk-on parts to Nelson Mandela, Clinton and Lewinsky, Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll and countless other poets, philosophers, and legendary lovers, who have learned that ’a world without love is no world at all’.\n\nA Simple Scale\n\nLONGLISTED FOR THE 2019 POLARI PRIZE\n\n‘Beautifully told and beautifully written’ – Philip Reeve (author of Mortal Engines)\n\n‘An impressive and compelling work, entirely original’ – New Welsh Review\n\n‘Masterly interweaving of narratives, time periods and places, David Llewellyn’s A Simple Scale is a symphony of mysteries and passions.’ – Paul Smith\n\n‘A Simple Scale is a work of self-assured persuasive power, and the resounding artistic statement of a writer who has truly arrived. It is bold, it is brave, and it is the real deal.​’ – Wales Arts Review​\n\n‘A compelling and suspenseful novel​’ – Buzz Magazine\n\nA single piece of music starts a story that takes us from Soviet Russia and McCarthyite Hollywood to post-9/11 New York. A single piece of music, and two composers – one American, the other Soviet – but which of them wrote it? How did their lives cross? How were their fortunes shaped by history, and what were the consequences for those they loved?\n\nA young Russian, Pavel Grekov, arrives in New York in the October of 2001, and accuses ageing TV composer Sol Conrad of plagiarising a work by his grandfather, Sergey. Conrad’s young PA Natalie is determined to defend her boss, but as she digs deeper she discovers worlds she barely knew about – the labour camps of Siberia, the “Red Scare” of 1950s Hollywood, government oppression, and the plight of gay men in the USA and USSR of the mid-20th Century.\n\nNatalie, Sol and Sergey’s stories range across decades and continents, and A Simple Scale moves through narratives of love, death, deceit, the secret police, atom bombs, Classical music and the last days of Hollywood’s “Golden Age”. In a dramatic conclusion, the past and present catches up with them, as the secrecies and betrayals of Sol and Sergey’s lives inform events in 2001, when history is just about to repeat itself.\n\nRich in detail and atmosphere, David Llewellyn explores the points at which the personal and political meet. Throughout, his depiction of ’30s Leningrad, ’50s California and post-9/11 New York is only too believable.\n\nDavid joined us for the Seren Stay-at-Home Series to discuss A Simple Scale with Nemonie Craven Roderick and actor Samuel West also joined us to read from the book. Watch the event in full on our Youtube channel.\n\nA Small Country\n\nA Small Country is the story of the Evans family, farmers in Carmarthenshire. In the summer of 1914 son Tom returns from Oxford to find the family falling apart. His handsome father has gone to live with schoolmistress Miriam Lewis, who is to have his child. His mother, broken-hearted, lies ill in bed, while his beautiful sister Catrin longs to leave for London and art college. Soon Tom’s college friend Edward will arrive to holiday with them, half-aware of his attraction to Catrin but already engaged to Rose, a supporter of the Suffragettes. And Tom himself is in debt and disillusioned with his proposed legal career. He would like to manage Hendre Ddu, the family farm, but finds that family troubles and the approach of war set him on a very different course.\n\nSiân James interweaves the lives of her characters with skill and understanding as they face the complications of family breakdown, love, war and propriety. Her ear for dialogue and eye for detail make A Small Country a hugely enjoyable novel.\n\nA Straitened Stage: Saunders Lewis’ Theatre\n\nSaunders Lewis (1893-1985), poet, novelist, lecturer, founder of Plaid Cymru (the Welsh Nationalist Party) was also the greatest Welsh language playwright of the century. His nineteen plays are a peculiarly Welsh response to the crisis in European theatre of the 1890s, and make a distinctive contribution to mainstream European culture.\n\nIn this authoritative study, loan Williams describes Lewis’s important place in a line of dramatists stretching from Racine, Ibsen, Synge, Yeats, Claudel and Eliot, through Beckett, Brecht and Pirandello, to lonescu, Arden, Osbome and Pinter, and suggests a new direction for English theatre based on Lewis’s work.\n\nLewis’s theatre was essentially Naturalist, his ‘straitened stage’ narrow and clearly defined. Yet like Brecht and Pirandello he recognised the fragility of human experience and its inability to organise the world to achieve individual definition. As a Catholic convert, however, Lewis recognised a spiritual dimension to the human character which enabled his creations to confront their profound fears and free themselves of the restraints of materialism and society.\n\nDrawing on the Bible, Welsh legend, the Dark Ages, the Cold War, Lewis’s plays, with their central strand of irony, force their audience to re-examine themselves and society. The theatre of Saunders Lewis is often poetic and always provocative.\n\nA Stranger at Home\n\nAn extraordinary epic about the insanity of war and the lengths men will go to for those they love, A Stranger at Home follows a member of the German SS who, through a remarkable series of events, finds himself fighting for the Russians in the hell of Stalingrad. Brilliantly plotted and painstakingly researched, A Stranger at Home is an incredible tale of conflicting ideologies and commitments.\n\nA Swansea Anthology\n\nSwansea and its surroundings have a literary pedigree that spans many centuries, with both native and visiting writers finding inspiration here.\n\nA Swansea Anthology features the work of a broad spectrum of writers from the established and revered such as Dylan Thomas, Leslie Norris and Harri Webb – to the more contemporary writings of Martin Amis, Robert Minhinnick, Kathryn Gray and Jo Mazelis among others.\n\nFirst published in 1996 this new version of A Swansea Anthology reflects the changes, for better and worse, to the communities and landscape of the area over the last ten years. The collection adds twenty new authors, collecting their thoughts on the inspirational force of the ‘ugly, lovely town’ and picturesque Gower.\n\nEditor James A. Davies was educated at University of Wales, Swansea and was a Senior Lecturer in its Department of English, retiring in 1998. He has been visiting professor at Baylor University, Texas and Mellon Research Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin and has written numerous books and articles on Victorian literature and Welsh writing in English. He is a Fellow of the Welsh Academy.\n\nA Toy Epic\n\nA Toy Epic is the story of three boys moving towards the threshold of adult life in the Thirties. From differing backgrounds, their lives cross and touch until they become firm friends. Each of them, Michael, Albie and Iorwerth, take up the story in turn, creating their own particular world and contributing to the composite picture of ’one of the four comers of Wales’.\n\nA challenging novel of childhood and of Wales in the 1930s. First published in 1958, Emyr Humphreys’ A Toy Epic is now viewed as a classic of writing from Wales. This new edition is introduced by M. Wynn Thomas, and includes an Afterword and a fragment from an earlier version of the novel.\n\nA Useful Fiction: Adventures in British Democracy\n\n‘A cracking read which… is as relevant, if not more so, than ever.’ – On: Yorkshire\n\nIn A Useful Fiction political broadcaster Patrick Hannan provides a punchy commentary on how the mere question of devolution is influencing all areas of political debate. The make-up of Britain has seen far-reaching change in the last ten years. Yet do the British understand these changes? Or rather do the English? Devolution in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland has sharply focussed the question there, but in metropolitan England there is only a gradual realisation that the English are affected too.\n\nIn his characteristically perceptive yet entertaining style Hannan reviews the politicians’ love of invoking Britishness, from Major to Brown; the role of newspapers and the broadcast media in telling us what it means to be British; the use of Britishness by nationalist political parties; the effects of devolution on Labour’s ability to govern the country as a whole; who pays to keep the various parts of Britain running?; the place of the royal family(and class) in twentieth century Britain. In total, Hannan asks the question; what principles should underlie the democratic running of Britain and its constituent parts and how should the parliamentary system change as those parts devolve?\n\nA Watchful Astronomy\n\n‘These poems are wounded, sincere and carefully accurate…​’ – Poetry Wales\n\nA Watchful Astronomy by Paul Deaton is the thoughtful debut poetry collection by this already well-regarded author who has published his work in national magazines like The Spectator, and London Magazine and literary journals like the PN Review.\n\nA Watchful Astronomy has a distinctive flavour. The author is a realist and a formalist, preferring simple, accurate language and use of formal meter. This makes for unusually clear and accessible work. A powerful underlying current of emotion also drives these poems and is contained and restrained by the more austere formal qualities.\n\nThe book is haunted by the ghost of the author’s father, a figure that appears throughout the collection as an overbearing, even threatening presence, embodied in glowering mountain ranges, in icy blasts of weather, in bits of bleak, monosyllabic dialogue. It is to the author’s credit that grudging admiration for the father’s practical skills (‘Shoemaker Father’), and a profound and lingering sense of compassion overcome what could be obdurate (if understandable) resentment.\n\nNature is also a prime factor and facilitator in this book, both rural and urban scenes are beautifully observed and presented. There is a gift for the visceral here, for tastes and sounds. There is a tendency to describe liminal scenes and moods: dusk, a sleepless hour, a view from a precipice, a changing mood. A rigorous intelligence meets an adept sensitivity in these poems by this already accomplished as well as promising poet.\n\nA Whim Set in Concrete: The Campaign to Stop the Cardiff Bay Barrage.\n\nClaimed to be the essential component for the regeneration of south Cardiff, the Cardiff Bay Barrage turned out to be one of the costliest – and to many, most unnecessary – civil engineering projects ever undertaken on the British coastline. Developers and politicians stand accused of circumventing the wishes of local residents, ignoring the advice of expert witnesses, and bringing the democratic process into disrepute.\n\n’A Whim Set in Concrete’ is a record of what happens when unregulated development meets the opposition of ’ordinary people’. it also offers a fascinating insight into the machinations of politics.\n\nA. E. Housman\n\nThe poetry of A.E. Housman is being redisovered. His volume A Shropshire Lad led him to be considered the finest poet in England. Housman’s work, popular, accessible, pessimistic, fell from favour in the post-war period but as his times are reassessed there is a growing interest in his authentic voice.\n\nIn this critical biography, Keith Jebb sets aside the conflicting biographical sketches of Housman and the assumptions of past critics to place his subject in English social history and his work in literary history. New attitudes to Housman’s personality while offering a new guide to the writing, including the neglected ’nonsense poems.’\n\nAcademe\n\nPaul Groves’s first volume confirms the promise which has marked him out as one of the most engaging poetic voices of recent years. Crystalline, deft, and exhilaratingly ironic, these poems deserve a wide audience. Those who are not already familiar with Paul Groves’s well-crafted verse will not be disappointed by this intelligent, original, and accomplished debut, which delights as much through its energy as through its precision.\n\nAdvantages of the Older Man\n\nA light-hearted novella exploring the strange case of a Swansea woman who is apparently possessed by the spirit of Dylan Thomas. Naturally all is not as it seems. The woman, who works in the Dylan Thomas Centre, meets a rather different Dylan from the one she knows by repute, one who doesn’t really fit in with the ghosts of other poets in heaven and is desperate to train himself to join the fitter shades of the long distance runners instead. Her own life, which has been lonely and sad, is completely transformed by the encounter.\n\nFluent and entertaining the story is written with all the confidence and panache you would expect from the former national poet, also a playwright and award-winning author of fiction and non-fiction. Alongside the humour there is a warmth and pathos, and some pithy observations on poets and poetry and the nature of fame.\n\nAfter Brock\n\n“Animal magic on the borders between youth and maturity” – The Independent\n\n“After Brock shows how natural drama infuses human behaviour with resonant meaning, and vice versa.” – The Spectator\n\n“…a fascinating and unique tale…” – Buzz Magazine\n\n“…a novel of parallel worlds, both paternal and environmental.” – New Welsh Review\n\n“This book is a hidden gem, and deserves to be read and recognised as such.” – Gwales\n\n“enjoyable” – Our Book Reviews Online Blog\n\nIn Paul Binding’s After Brock, Pete, a talented and intelligent schoolboy, though an outsider in both home and school life, enters and wins a quiz show ‘High Flyers’ a name that is to resonate throughout the rest of his life. One December night after watching his mother perform in the Mikado with a local amateur dramatics society he meets Sam, an attractive and flamboyant boy, somewhat of a misfit with whom his infatuation is instant. They begin a tempestuous friendship seeking a world removed from the difficulties of home life: Sam’s alcoholic mother and Pete’s frayed relationship with his unappreciative family. They confide in each other with almost everything. They become obsessed with UFOs and otherworldly phenomena, inseparable until one day they embark on a journey sparked by a sighting of something deep in the Berwyn mountains but this event leads to a terrible betrayal. Thirty-five years later Pete’s own son, Nat, disappears and is found in that very same place. A scrupulous journalist appears and, suspecting foul play, is determined to find out what led Nat there and why…\n\nAfter the First Death: An Anthology of Wales and War in the Twentieth Century\n\nThis anthology contains writing by many of the greatest authors of Wales. From Wilfred Owen and David Jones, Dylan Thomas and Dannie Abse to Christopher Meredith and Gillian Clarke, it spans a century which saw both the barbarism of mechanised warfare and the development of mass communication, mass literacy and a flourishing of creative endeavour.\n\nAfter the First Death draws on the experience of those who have faced death on the battlefield, and on others who have sought to put into words the complex philosophical, political and emotional responses that military action demands. Including poetry, extracts from fiction, memoirs, letters and biography, the book moves from World War One via the ideological battleground of the 1930s into the Second World War, then through the Cold War, Vietnam, the Falklands and the Gulf wars.\n\nAfternoons Go Nowhere\n\nA fascination for history, both as a source of human drama and a field for artful speculation, characterises this collection of poems by Sheenagh Pugh from Seren. Here we are with the rebels who sack the Palace of Savoy or inside the head of the disturbed King of France, who was convinced he was made of glass, or with the Bishop Thorlack, blessing a demon-haunted cliff.\n\nWe are as much taken with the gaps in the chronicles, the elisions, the rumours, as we are with the relics: stone ruins, statues plagued by seagulls, the Maid of Norway in a stained-glass window. The marginalia in illuminated manuscripts inspires a poem with ‘asides’ by the Monk in a medieval scriptorium. There is a heartbreakingly lovely poem ‘The Centenaries’ that vividly evokes the battles of World War One as their anniversaries arrive in sequence. There is a thoughtful series evoking a trip to Canada by a ‘tour’ through its time zones.\n\nPrimarily about people, this collection is also steeped in northern weathers and waters of the Scottish Isles, where Pugh now lives. The title poem refers to the abrupt darkness in winter afternoons, but also to a theme of timelessness running through the collection as in ‘Visitor’ where the protagonist is a skull that emerges from an eroded cliff only to lurch back and disappear with it, “like a neighbour who called in/ just once, and whom we never got to know” a both stern and lovely evocation, a memento mori.\n\nIn Afternoons Go Nowhere the past seems more relevant to the present than ever, human nature never entirely predictable and often non-sensical, the natural world seeming full of a paradoxical beauty. There is also a piece entirely sympathetic to the digital new age where people in a ‘Bus Station’ are seen staring at their phones, the poem sings praises of connectivity in an otherwise dull context. Complex but with clear themes and lucid, musical language, Sheenagh Pugh’s tenth collection will delight discriminating readers.\n\nAir Histories\n\nChristopher Meredith’s Air Histories starts in the Stone Age and ends in the future. It’s marked by formal diversity and a wide range of subjects, with the personal alongside the impersonal and the experimental alongside well-known forms, as well as including some translations from the Welsh. Throughout it engages the rich meanings of its title, touching on the elemental and on historical time, as well as music and story, meditating on human creativity and its fallibilities from knapping an arrowhead to playing the fiddle or making a guitar. Nature is a touchstone, particularly the Black Mountains, near the author’s home, but also often seen ‘aslant’ as in ‘Seeing the Birds’ where sparrows seem suddenly fierce as eagles.\n\nAll That Was Wood\n\nIn 2018, Katherine Stansfield was the poet-in-residence at Cornerstone, the neo-Gothic church in the centre of Cardiff converted into an events space. This pamphlet of new poems is the result: the record of a dynamic year of varied events, and an exploration of this fascinating building’s rich history.\n\nKatherine is a poet and novelist. She grew up in Cornwall but now lives in Cardiff. Her debut poetry collection, Playing House, was published by Seren. Her second collection, We Could Be Anywhere By Now, appears from Seren in 2020. Katherine Stansfield teaches for the Open University, and is the Royal Literary Fund Fellow at Cardiff University.\n\nThe Seren Cornerstone Poetry Festival, presenting some of the finest poets of the day, takes place each February in the Cornerstone venue in Cardiff – www.cardiffpoetryfestival.com\n\nAll the Colours You Cannot Name\n\n“A hauntingly vivid story of the Great Plague of 1666, written with spare grace and intelligence, along with a compelling historical realism. A very fine and very moving fiction.” – Dr Rowan Williams\n\nIt is 1666 and the bubonic plague still haunts London. Just outside the old Roman walls, where they have lived for six good years, printers James and Ellie White have managed to escape its ravages. The city too has survived, but now sits in a cloud of wounds. After over a year, something like everyday life has been restored, and the preacher Solomon Eagle wants a book printed, in which he moralises on the meanings of the plague and the judgements of God.\n\nJames and Ellie accept his commission and set to work but James is plagued by a breathless trepidation. Then everything changes when the unexpected happens.\n\nCaught in the dream-like place between the past and their future, with former lives to unlive and a grief they can hardly speak, they must hold onto each other, and their love, in order to survive.\n\nLyrical and visceral in equal measure, All the Colours you Cannot Name is a compelling and deeply tender story of love and death.\n\nAll The Men I Never Married\n\nWinner of the Forward Prize for Best Collection 2022\n\n“All the Men I Never Married is a work of immense focus, intelligence and integrity.” – The Yorkshire Times\n\nThis eagerly awaited second collection of poems from Kim Moore is pointedly feminist, challenging and keenly aware of the contradictions and complexities of desire. The 48 numbered poems take us through a gallery of exes and significant others where we encounter rage, pain, guilt, and love.\n\nThe book opens with a rally-cry that is also a warning: ‘We are coming under cover of darkness,’ and continues with the description of ‘We’ as being woman, both witch-like (feared) and oppressed, with ‘hobbled’ childhoods and spaces that were ‘given’.\n\nThe book moves in a roughly chronological way from here, with early poems about the innocent friendships of childhood that have a dreamy, anticipatory quality. They foreshadow a later eroticism, but also hint at fear, with the awkward boy with ‘unwashed clothes’: ‘We hated the way you followed us around…’. Then come the terrifying episodes of violence or near violence – incidents in which our narrator barely escapes rape at a party, or where the narrator’s friend suffers the consequences of defending herself from unwanted attention in a nightclub, ‘that being in public is a dangerous thing’.\n\nThere are also amusing anecdotes as in 12: After the reading… which reports a confrontation with a male in the audience who accuses her of objectifying the male gender. The author observes a naïve younger self just coming to terms with sexuality and speaks of desire, touching upon its inherent power, its temptations and deceptions. There are a number of poems that re-enact the ‘easy misogyny’ of everyday life and observe it from an appalled distance. An episode with a taxi driver where casual banter becomes increasingly threatening rings only too true.\n\nAll The Men I Never Married is a powerful collection of deeply thoughtful and deeply felt poetry.\n\nAll the Souls\n\nTwo doctors and a folklorist meet in northern Brittany in 1898, determined to prove that leprosy still exists. But their ardour for collecting evidence draws them into a dark, watchful landscape where superstition is rife. Many of the stories in All the Souls hover round themes of ‘collecting’ and recovering the past. From poignant and dangerous obsessions with the iconic (a Romano-British figurine; a carved wooden Christ-child; a bronze angel) to direct, often puzzled conversations with ghosts, the characters in this book all strive to make contact with the impossible. A girl becomes obsessed with a figure she only sees through a Camera Obscura; an angry man strikes up a friendship with a sixth-century saint; a revenant mother by a mountain lake tries to explain herself to a grieving friend.\n\n‘A considerable achievement.’ – Stevie Davies on The Breathing\n\nAltered States\n\nThe fate of an Italian icon damaged by floods, a Victorian skeleton, and a Vampire Ballet are amongst the many unusual subjects of the poems in this collection by Catherine Fisher. Lyrical grace combined with a sharp eye for imagery and a precise use of language are her hallmarks. Her themes are history, religion, and distinctively for this book, memory, highlighted in her sequence about an amnesiac and in the final section of sonnets, an imaginative chronicle of immigrant forebears.\n\nAlun Lewis: A Life\n\nAlun Lewis (1915-1944) is one of the most impressive and important writers of the century. The leading author of World War Two, perhaps the leading poet, he is still an influential figure, particularly in his native Wales. In this new and revised edition of his biography John Pikoulis draws on unpublished material and Lewis’s now extensively available work to present a portrait of the man: passionate, thoughtful, serious with an often romantic nature.\n\nFrom his childhood days in the depressed valleys of south Wales, Lewis felt he had a vocation to be a writer. Pikoulis traces Lewis’s development from the remarkable schoolboy stories written as an unhappy boarder, through his university education at Aberystwyth and Manchester to his return to the valleys as a teacher. His extended treatment of Lewis’s military service, especially in India and Burma (where he was to die aged twenty-eight), reflects his standing as a war writer.\n\nLewis’s poems and stories, authentic and moving, were popular with both readers and critics, catching the tone of the ’phoney war’ years and later the disturbing but exciting experience of his war in India. His vivid letters home, which have been compared to Keats’s letters, capture both the atmosphere of war and the essence of Lewis’s character, and Pikoulis draws on them, and on contemporary photographs, to portray a fascinating man and writer.\n\nAlun Lewis: Collected Poems\n\nAlun Lewis (1915-1944), the remarkable poet and story writer, died, aged 28, in Burma during the Second World War. Some critics see him as the last of the great Romantic poets, a twentieth century Keats. Others view him as the bridge between pre-war poets like Auden and Yeats to post-war poets such as Hughes and Gunn. He was born and raised in Depression-struck south Wales and, following degrees in history at Aberystwyth and Manchester, became a teacher there. Early in 1940, despite his pacifist inclinations he enlisted and, after long periods of training, joined the war in India.\n\nBecoming a soldier galvanised Lewis’s writing. By 1944 he had written two collections of poems and one of short stories, all published to considerable acclaim. Firmly established with Keith Douglas as the leading writer of the Second World War, Lewis’s death in an accident while on active service was huge loss to English literature. This Collected Poems comprises a body of work which has endured and which transcends the label ‘war poetry’; it is complete in itself and full of promise of greater things.\n\nAlun Lewis: Collected Stories\n\nCollected Stories reprints the war stories of Alun Lewis in their entirety for the first time. It also collects stories published in student magazines and newspapers such as The Guardian, together with several previously unseen. In bringing together all this material, editor Cary Archard shows Lewis’s development from remarkable schoolboy writer to mature and established author whose stories appeared in magazines such as Horizon and Lilliput.\n\nFirst published in 1991 this paperback edition, published to mark Lewis’ centenary, reminds that the stories had been surprisingly neglected since the 1940s, when Lewis was at his height as a story writer, yet still under 30 years old. It includes stories written as a schoolboy (“one of the most remarkable sets of juvenilia any great writer can have produced” according to his biographer, John Pikoulis), as a student and as a teacher in the build up to the war. Lewis moved towards representing topical and political events in fiction and his subjects in this period included the impact of Italian fascism in south Wales.\n\nAs with Lewis’ poetry the war, and his enlistment in the Royal Engineers despite his pacifist tendencies, brought his writing into sharp focus and gave it an increased dynamism. Most of the stories in The Last Inspection (1943) were concerned with the Army in England during the prolonged period of military inaction in Europe. The stories drawn from In the Green Tree (1948) are almost all set in India and include Lewis’ masterpiece, ‘The Orange Grove’, a ‘war story’ actually about the human condition, which reflected Lewis’ own sloughing off of material values.\n\nTogether, the stories in this volume represent the short fiction of a short writing career, yet one of great quality.\n\n“The ordeals are seized upon by Lewis with such intense sensitivity, you can feel him living again in the reclamation of that experience… What a talent was lost to the world.” – Sunday Times\n\n“Long overdue. Lewis was a true writer, and might well have been great.” – Financial Times\n\n“His neglected stories are among the best of the mid-century.” – William Scammell\n\n“His narratives, whether in verse or in prose, excite the reader with their moments of illumination… wonderfully touching and memorable. This book poignantly reminds us what an authentic, inventive literary talent was lost.” – Dannie Abse, Independent on Sunday\n\nAlun Lewis: Letters to My Wife\n\nSoldier and poet Alun Lewis (1915-1944) was an inveterate letter writer who wrote regularly to family, friends and other writers such as Robert Graves. Where they have been published they have attracted wide praise for their humanity and spontaneity, and have been compared by critics to the letters of Keats.\n\nThis paperback edition of Letters to My Wife is published to mark Lewis’s centenary. It collects over 240 letters to his wife Gweno Ellis, beginning with his sudden enlistment and continuing until his untimely death on active service in Burma in March 1944. In them the reader is given a unique account of day to day army life, for officers and other ranks, in Britain and the Far East. The descriptions of the dreariness of long years of training in Britain in advance of a European front are as revealing as those of response the journey to India via Brazil and South Africa, and Lewis’ response to the culture shock of India. The insights into service life are authentic and illuminating. As are the insights into Lewis’s character – his inclination towards depression, his conflicted pacifism at the beginning of the war, his unwillingness (and innate unsuitability) to becoming an officer, and, in India his efforts to cheer Gweno having met (we now understand) his muse in Freda Aykroyd. Lewis’s letters testify to his love for his war bride Gweno, whom he married in July 1941 before embarkation.\n\nThe letters also shed light on Lewis the writer – he would become the writer of World War Two. Here are his thoughts on poems and stories as they developed and were published, and his excitement at the critical and public response to a burgeoning talent. They also reveal in sometimes devastating detail Lewis’ struggle to become an artist.\n\n“Passionate, tender, kindly, charming, interesting… leaves no doubt about the exceptional charm of the man, and none about the subtlety, intelligence and emotional force of the writer lost to us.” – Andrew Motion\n\n“Fascinating… there is so much detail one had forgotten or never knew.” – Peter Levi\n\n“We are always aware, as in Keats’s letters, of a man who is living his life, and making himself from what he makes of his experience. Keats would have said making his soul, and I do not think Lewis would have disagreed. … In time Letters to my Wife will surely come to be regarded as a classic telling of the primary human story, the story of love and death.” – Jeremy Hooker\n\n“I was not prepared for the cumulative power of the letters as an account of just what it was like to be a young soldier and in love during World War II. It is all here. …He is a natural writer, continuously aware of the semantic and magic possibilities of the language he is using.” – Vernon Scannell\n\n“It will become a classic in that branch of literature ‘published correspondence’. Letters, in short; letters written as private but whose contents and beauty shift them from privacy into the realm of public relevance and awareness, as vivid documents of people and of their times.” – John Ormond\n\n“In historical and human terms this book rings true. He was a clear-eyed realist, and his letters make compelling reading.” – Michael Duffy, TES\n\n“It is the impression of integrity in the texture of his life that one takes from reading Alun Lewis. It is his achievement to have conveyed this in a few brief years of creative power. It is the patient humanity of a man struggling with the question of how we might live a better life, yet refusing all easy answers that one takes away from these letters. Let that be his testament.” – Greg Hill\n\nAlun, Gweno & Freda\n\nAlun Lewis (1915-1944) was the most prominent writer of World War Two, in poetry and short fiction. Raiders’ Dawn (1942), answered the critics’ questions about the absence of war poets in that conflict, and his story collection The Last Inspection (1943) was a best selling revelation of the ‘Phoney War’ in Britain and service life in India. A posthumously published collection of poems, Ha! Ha! Among the Trumpets (1945) showed a move towards the spiritual.\n\nLewis was born in the industrial valleys of south Wales, near Aberdare, and grew up during the deep poverty of the depression. This, and his family background, made him a confirmed socialist and a pacifist, which presented him with a particular dilemma when the war began in 1939. The need to defeat fascism proved overwhelming and Lewis left his teaching job and volunteered as a private in the Royal Engineers. His attempt to play a non-combatant role in the ranks was the beginning of an arc of promotion which ended yards from enemy lines in Burma, as a regimental intelligence officer.\n\nSet against that background of industrial poverty and war Alun, Gweno & Freda is an account of Lewis’s life and his writing, through the particular prism of his relationships with his wife, Gweno, and with Freda Aykroyd, an expatriate in India whose house provided respite for British officers on leave. The book argues that Lewis’s charged relationships with these two women were the key to both his writing and his mental health. It also explores the circumstances surrounding Lewis’ death by a single shot from his own gun and contributes to the ongoing debate about whether this was an accident or suicide.\n\nIn addition to illuminating the life and writing of Alun Lewis, the book also sheds light on the art of biography. It tells the story of its own creation: the author’s researches into Lewis, his dealings with Lewis’s family, his wife, Freda Aykroyd, the regiment. The book includes generous quotation from both Lewis’s work and Pikoulis’s correspondence and meetings with the main players as he negotiates the difficult terrain of personal memory and public exposition.\n\nAlun, Gweno & Freda is published to mark the centenary of Alun Lewis’ birth, which is also marked by a number of celebratory events, including the publication of Morlais, a previously unseen novel by Lewis.\n\nAmbassador of Nowhere\n\n“Gwyn’s latest book is a fascinating and multilayered enterprise. It intersperses the personal with the literary, the political with the social, and takes the reader through multiple landscapes and discoveries.” – Leo Boix, Morning Star\n\nIn Ambassador of Nowhere, Richard Gwyn charts his journey across South America in search of poems for his landmark anthology, The Other Tiger. Criss-crossing the continent, he is driven through lunar landscapes in Patagonia, walks in the temperate rainforests of southern Chile, and travels to a town on the Rio Magdalena that may or may not exist. From the betrayal of revolution in Nicaragua to the victims of guerrilla war in Colombia and the threat of narco gang violence in Mexico, Gwyn’s lyrical, life-affirming account pays homage to a deeply conflicted and paradoxical continent.\n\nAmbassador of Nowhere is also a book about translation, and the multiple representations of reality that the act of translation sets in motion, even as the author struggles to keep his own life on track when confronted by the demons of an earlier existence.\n\nAmerican Sycamore\n\nGold Medal Winner: Best Regional Fiction, Independent Publisher Award 2015\n\nThe lives of congenial American fly-fisherman Billy and his younger sister Alice meander alongside the Susquehanna River in this offbeat coming-of-age novel of death, madness, and fishing by debut author Karen Fielding.\n\nWhat starts out as a frolic of losers and drifters along the American riverscape flows into something more sinister when twelve-year-old Billy Sycamore encounters a stranger in the woods, while Alice is left to deal with the fall-out.\n\nIn the spirit of Richard Brautigan’s Trout Fishing in America and idiosyncratic like a George Saunders story, American Sycamore is a funny and fractious narrative about growing up in a small town in northeast America, with not a lot to do, but a whole lot to worry about.\n\nAn Affair of the Heart\n\nEach story in An Affair of the Heart questions the apparently romantic title through its exploration of the enigmatic state of mind known as love. Desire and identity; displacement – emotional and geographical; the relationship between ambition, circumstances and emotion; the often difficult co-existence of passion and intellect; these are the subjects of the fifteen fascinating narratives.\n\nMen and women reckon the worth of relationships past and present, from steamy New Orleans to urbane Paris, from metropolitan Chelsea to the industrial valleys and rural hinterlands of Wales. Frank and delicate, revelatory and secret, Clare Morgan’s stories offer insights into human nature which are in turn punchily realistic and suggestively questioning.\n\nClare Morgan considers similar themes in her second collection Scar Tissue.\n\nAncestral Lines\n\nAncestral Lines explores poetry written away from the economic and cultural centre by six poets: Seamus Heaney, Tony Harrison, Douglas Dunn, Gillian Clarke, Sally Roberts Jones and Oliver Reynolds. Linden Peach sees them all as responsible for mapping locales: their work, he claims, is a voyage of geographical discovery for the literary world and a struggle with language to articulate in poetry their people’s lives. In the process they refute the notion of poetry as the preserve of the English middle-classes.\n\nStudies of the individual poets are accompanied by more wide-ranging essays on the influence of politics, history and myth on poetry from Ireland, Wales and the North of England, describing how poetry emerges from the complex matrix of personal, regional, national and historical identities. This book is a welcome challenge to conventional literary notions of life on the margins.\n\nAnd You, Helen\n\nPoet Deryn Rees-Jones and artist Charlotte Hodes have created a unique approach to the life of Helen Thomas, and through her to the women, and children, left behind by the fatalities of war. Helen Thomas was widowed when her husband the war poet Edward Thomas was killed at the battle of Arras in 1917.\n\nOn the centenary of the First World War this specially commissioned collaboration explores Helen’s loss, and the loss of all war widows, through poetry, prose and art. Rees-Jones’s sequence takes as its starting point Thomas’s only poem addressed directly to his wife , ‘And you, Helen’. Rees-Jones’s poem imagines Helen after Edward’s death, and is complemented by a meditative essay on the complexities of the relationship between the poet and his family, and on war, grief, marriage and bereavement more generally: a critical exploration through a personal lens.\n\nCharlotte Hodes takes Rees-Jones’s touchstone for her own exploration of these themes through thirteen of her distinctive collages and prints, which extend her body of work about the changing position of women since the eighteenth century.\n\nAnd You, Helen – Deluxe Edition\n\nNumbered from one to one hundred and signed by Deryn Rees-Jones and Charlotte Hodes, this collectors’ edition of And You, Helen includes a luxury American fold jacket, wall display poster and accompanying DVD of Charlotte’s animations.\n\nPoet Deryn Rees-Jones and artist Charlotte Hodes have created a unique approach to the life of Helen Thomas, and through her to the women, and children, left behind by the fatalities of war. Helen Thomas was widowed when her husband, war poet Edward Thomas was killed during the First World War, at the battle of Arras in 1917.\n\nSpecially commissioned to mark the centenary of the First World War this collaboration explores Helen’s loss, and the loss of all war widows, through poetry, prose and art. Rees-Jones’s sequence takes as its starting point Edwards Thomas’s only poem addressed directly to his wife , ‘And you, Helen’. Rees-Jones’s poem imagines Helen after Edward’s death, and is complemented by a meditative essay on the complexities of the relationship between the poet and his family, and on war, grief, marriage and bereavement more generally: a critical exploration through a personal lens.\n\nCharlotte Hodes takes Rees-Jones’s touchstone for her own exploration of these themes through thirteen of her distinctive collages and prints, which extend her body of work about the changing position of women since the eighteenth century.\n\nAngola, America\n\nWinner of the Mslexia Poetry Pamphlet Prize 2021\n\nShortlisted for the Michael Marks Award for Poetry Pamphlets 2023\n\n“Angola, America is unsparing in its depiction of death row’s horrors and incisive in its examination of white privilege…” – The TLS\n\nAngola, America takes its name from a prison in Louisiana in the southern United Sates. In these strikingly original, thoroughly contemporary, and deeply moving poems by poet Sammy Weaver, we are immersed in the world the inmates must endure. From the first poem, when we witness a home-made tattoo and understand that this scarring and incision is a “map in the connective tissue of pain and loss”, we are drawn into this world in a way that is carefully observed and beautifully empathetic.\n\nWhat is particularly convincing about these poems is the moral fervor that accompanies an ear that delights in the complexities of language and the music of syntax. It is an emphatic voice, observant to the smallest details and yet steps back from an intrusive ‘authorial’ presence to let these prisoners and landscapes breathe and be. We observe with the author the society that builds these institutions in which the protagonists survive under extraordinary pressures. We come to acknowledge that we are responsible for the contemporary establishment and continuance of these places.\n\nThe ‘Prison Industrial Complex’ is excoriated through artful conceits. There are poems about handcuffs, the Louisiana State Flag, the electric chair. Throughout, the fate of the body is aligned with the fate of the landscape, we see Louisiana’s famously endangered coastline, prone to hurricanes and oil-spills. Formally, the work is adept, with many 14-line proto-sonnets and then longer-lined free verse poems that are nevertheless, wonderfully compact. it conveys anger without hysteria, empathy without condescension, and pulls us through its compelling narratives with style and flair.\n\nAnimaculture\n\nAnimaculture by Hilary Llewellyn-Williams followed her acclaimed Book of Shadows (1990). Her style is intensely lyrical and imaginative but also finely controlled and tempered by a keen intelligence. This collection includes shorter lyrics as well as two fine sequences.\n\nThere are poems here inspired by personal experience: by family, dreams and childhood memories. Others are re-interpretations of myths or historical anecdotes. Always evident is the author’s profound and passionate response to nature; these poems are steeped in all weathers and seasons. The ’Sculpture at Margam’ sequence is a series of meditations based around the history and setting of Margam Abbey on the coast of south Wales, while the five parts of ’Spring in Saskatchewan’ vividly evoke the scenes, myths and events encountered by the author on a visit to Canada.\n\nAnimal People\n\n‘The most striking thing about the collection is its range, its adventurousness, its willingness to go almost anywhere in the quest for a different slant on poetry’ – The North\n\n‘This is a confronting collection, offering many challenges and no easy comforts, but it’s all the better for that. Rumens’s voice gets ever stronger, ever more arresting, and we’d do well to listen.’ – The Poetry Review\n\n‘Animal People is a striking and powerful collection which should appeal to anyone who loves thoughtful, well-crafted poetry.’ – Orbis\n\nAnimal People is the new book of poetry from the renowned writer Carol Rumens. As the author says in her brief introduction, ‘the vertebrae of this collection are the seasons of a sometimes Welsh and sometimes English year.’ Her poems are frequently inspired by places, either wild landscapes as in ‘Fire, Stone, Snowdonia’ or urban scenes as in ‘March Morning, Pearson Park’. But just as often a setting will be a pretext for a theme that has a political, sociological, aesthetic, philosophical or even metaphysical focus.\n\nThe author is unafraid to introduce potentially controversial topics and is intrigued as much by science as history. Rumens can also effectively reach back into the past and recall vivid moments from childhood, such as ‘Austerity, 1949’. She can also produce character portraits as in ‘Happy Christmas, Sister Dympna’ and her lively ballad to Bob Dylan, ‘Happy 70th Birthday Blues, Mr Zimmerman’. Other poems start with a mythological premise and turn out to be modern morality (or immorality) tales as in ‘Her to Apollo’. Translations and/or versions inspired by other famous authors also abound as in her ‘translator’s note’ from Dante’s Divine Comedy, ‘The Red-ish Wheel-Barrow’, a borrowing from William Carlos Williams and ‘A Marshalsea Quadrille for Mr. Dickens’.\n\nThe striking final sequence, ‘On the Spectrum’, explores some of the effects and affects of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), focusing particularly on Asperger’s Syndrome and how it may be experienced by young women. Rumens opens up this topic with all her characteristic energy, empathy and curiosity. From recent research which suggests that some of these ‘autistic’ qualities may have come from the Neanderthal culture to the debatable hypothesis that AS individuals have unusual affinities with animals, there is much here that is provocative as well as lyrical. ‘We’re all animal people in the broader sense’, says the author. This beautifully intelligent collection of poetry will delight and inspire the reader.\n\nAperture\n\nForeword by Jeremy Bowen\n\nJohn Downing was the pre-eminent press photographer of his generation: he led a life of adventure in wars and hotspots around the world. His memoir, Aperture: Life Through a Fleet Street Lens, offers a unique and first-hand insight into life behind the Fleet Street lens during one of the most interesting periods of world history and a golden age of photojournalism.\n\nAs a photojournalist, and seven-time winner of the British Press Photographer of the Year, John Downing recognised a good story, and how to tell it. Aperture is a fascinating and engaging mix of recording the heyday of Fleet Street – multi-million daily sales as the only source of readable news, dynamic characters and its own unique cultures – and Downing’s less glamorous personal experiences on the job. These included long assignments in hotspots around the world, including South Sudan, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Uganda, Bangladesh and Chernobyl, which are vividly described. Widely respected by colleagues, Downing’s work includes some of the iconic images of the period, including the only photograph of Thatcher immediately after the IRA bombing.\n\nAperture describes the glamour and excitement of journalism at the time: the hard-nosed editors, the rivalries, the ‘work hard play hard culture’, foreign assignments issued at the drop of a hat, the toll on journalists and photographers. Newspapers were hugely important in the daily lives of their readers then, the world was less accessible than now, and newspapers played a vital role in shining light into some of its darker, more inaccessible parts. John Downing played a significant part in this, though not without some personal cost. Completed shortly before his death, with the help of colleague Wendy Holden, Downing filed a story for the final time: his own remarkable life.\n\nAre You Judging Me Yet?\n\nIn Are You Judging Me Yet? Kim Moore explores the relationship between poetry and everyday sexism, in a series of lyrical essays. They draw on her experience of writing and performing the poems in her Forward Prize-winning collection All The Men I Never Married to examine the dynamics of being a female poet performing in a public space.\n\n‘Are you judging me yet, are you surprised?’ is the line from one of Moore’s poems, and challenges the reader to consider their response to a female poet. These essays consider problems with the male gaze and explorations of what the female gaze might look like in poetry, the concepts of complicity, guilt and objectification, the slipperiness of the word sexism and whether poetry can be part of transformational change.\n\nMoore says, “I believe the time is right for a book like this to make an impact. As a female poet, I know there is a need for such a book to examine the intersection between writing, performing, feminism and sexism. I’ve had many conversations with other female poets who have confirmed my thinking – that female poets are navigating these things regularly, and yet it is still difficult to discuss or write about their impact openly.\n\nAre You Judging Me Yet? is designed to encourage readers to make their own connections between the essays. Each chapter ends with a choice of sections to read next, as well as connecting the essays to poems from All The Men I Never Married.\n\nArtes Mundi\n\nThe Artes Mundi Prize has been established to celebrate visual culture within a global context. Set to become a biennial event, it showcases artists who have achieved recognition in their own country and are emerging internationally. The emphasis is upon those who are working with ideas of human form or presence, and producing art which adds to our understanding of the human condition.The inaugural Artes Mundi Prize, in 2004, attracted nominations from more than 60 countries. Respected curators Declan McGonagle and Fumio Nanjo spent a year visiting exhibitions and studios around the world, and considering the work of those nominated, before arriving at a shortlist of ten. This publication gives the background to the Prize and explores the work of the shortlisted artists in specially commissioned essays.\n\nArthur Giardelli: Painting, Constructions, Relief Sculptures\n\nThis beautifully illustrated book reveals how Giardelli’s childhood in the country shaped his life. It examines his Italian background, his education at Oxford, and his sudden removal to Wales. A friend of Cedric Morris, David Jones, Josef Herman and Ceri Richards, Arthur Giardelli was for many years Chairman of the influential 56 Group Wales, arranging exhibitions throughout Europe. His international circle included the painters Zoran Music, Ota Janecek, Olivier Debre and the American Fairfield Porter. Giardelli’s work can be found in the Tate Gallery, the National Museum of Wales and public and private collections around the world.\n\nArthur Machen\n\nArthur Conan Doyle called Machen a genius; Oscar Wilde, W.B. Yeats and H.G. Wells admired him. His classic horror novel The Great God Pan, which both shocked and delighted contemporary readers with its dark portrayal of sexuality and its alluring villainess, has been favourably compared to Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; his The Secret Glory changed John Betjeman’s life; while his masterpiece The Hill of Dreams, located in his beloved Gwent, has been called the most beautiful book in the English language. It is a testimony to his writing skill that through one short story The Bowmen, he once made thousands believe that angels had appeared at the Battle of Mons, sparking a whole series of myths.\n\nBy turns a translator of Casanova, a strolling player and war-time journalist, Arthur Machen was throughout his life a dedicated writer and an explorer of the supernatural. An important and convivial figure in the literary circles of the late nineteenth century, he was also a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, a group which studied the occult, and remained a life long friend of the group’s founder A.E. Waite. He was also steeped in Welsh history and legend, and his imaginative reworking of Celtic myths make him an important figure in Anglo-Welsh literature.\n\nLargely neglected by critics and biographers, Machen has remained an inspiration to those readers who have sought him out, and current admirers include cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and TV personality Barry Humphries. Mark Valentine’s biography, the first in many decades, provides a much needed re-examination of Machen’s varied and fascinating career.\n\nAs If To Sing\n\nWinner of the English Language Poetry Category at Wales Book of the Year 2023\n\nThe power of song, to sustain the human spirit, resonates through As if to Sing. A trapped caver crawls back through songs to the sea; Welsh soldiers pack their hearts into a song on the eve of battle, ‘for safe-keeping’; a child crossing a bridge sings ‘a song with no beginning or end’…\n\nBlurring past and present, a ‘torchsong’ of music and light intensifies in ‘The Boys in the Branches’, a moving sequence to the poet’s sons where three boys scale a tree to manhood, to ‘carve their names on the late sun’. The collection’s closing cadence includes the long poem ‘The Key to Penllain’. Set in the summer of 1969, its apocalyptic dream stages a search for a key which could save the planet. Rich in the musical lyricism admired by readers and fellow poets, As if to Sing is an essential addition to this poet’s compelling body of work.\n\nAt Arm’s Length\n\nDevolution to Wales and Scotland may prove to have been the most profound change in the UK in recent years. The consequences are far-reaching, and not just political. Geraint Talfan Davies, media and arts executive for more than three decades, recalls and reflects on the impact of this development for culture and civil society.\n\nA view from well beyond the M25 – informed by Wales and the North East of England – his experiences have a resonance and a significance for all parts of ‘a lazy British union’; charting the decline of regional newspapers, the collapse of ITV’s regional mission, the London-centric nature of the media and a threat to the independence of the arts.\n\nAt Arm’s Length includes a graphic account to a successful battle to maintain the arm’s length principle in arts funding and a plea for a greater role for the arts in society. It also portrays a small and fledgling democracy, and it’s struggle to sustain a local, national voice in the face of the contemporary forces of globalisation and the increasing centralisation of government and the media.\n\n“The story is beautifully told, with diary entries, dramatic suspense, humour and wickedly accurate pen portraits all brought into play.” Peter Stead, New Welsh Review, May 08\n\n“From the cover of his book Talfan looks out from a magnificent portrait taken by his daughter-in-law Betina Skovbro. The neat, clean-cut features are unmistakable, as is the glint of adolescent mischievousness in the eyes. The text within is as revealing as the portrait.” Peter Stead, New Welsh Review, May 08\n\nAt the Bright Hem of God: Radnorshire Pastoral\n\n‘Conradi writes thoughtfully and non-judgementally even when dealing with contentious matters of Welsh politics and cultural identity. He is glad to quote Bidgood’s declaration that she did not come to this area to escape the world: “This is the world.” Completed by Simon Dorrell’s exquisite pen-and-ink miniatures, it is the perfect primer to this quiet stretch of Wales.’ Nicholas Murray, The Independent, July 2009\n\nRadnorshire, a county rural and remote. The lives of its sparse population continue to be shaped by the wild landscape of valleys and mountains in ways that for Britain now lie in the past.\n\nYet down the centuries Radnorshire has fascinated and inspired, as a place of contemplation, exploration, creation and retreat. In At the Bright Hem of God Peter J. Conradi examines both his own relationship with the place and responses to it by writers from Gerald of Wales,who passed through in 1176, to the present day.\n\nOn the way he takes in fifteenth century court poets; the metaphysicals Herbert, Vaughan and Traherne; the Romantic poets and Rousseau (who almost lived there and whose ideas did); diarist Francis Kilvert and his editor William Plomer; artist Eric Gill and poet David Jones; Bruce Chatwin, whose On the Black Hill is the most famous Radnorshire novel; and poets R.S.Thomas, Roland Mathias and Ruth Bidgood, the county’s current remembrancer.\n\nThe result is an astonishing account, a trip across landscapes and borders – physical, emotionaland intellectual – the culmination of over forty years of visiting and living there. Conradi’s perceptive narrative is complemented by superb ink drawings by the Radnorshire artist Simon Dorrell to produce a beautiful book, a love letter to a place still hidden from most of the country.\n\n‘Imbued with the author’s intimate knowledge and love of the Welsh Border country Conradi’s new book is rich in insights, surprises and delights.’ – James Roose Evans\n\n“At the Bright Hem of God is a magically hybrid work in which Conradi skillfully melds tradition, individual memories, history and the present moment…This is a fascinating portrait of a remote area which emerges, in all its remarkable intransigence, as a corrective to the ‘impatient speed’ and ‘empty knowingness’ of a global world which is fast losing any sense of place as potent and diverse.” – Avril Horner\n\n“So passionately and with such historical élan does Peter J Conradi inhabit his beloved Radnorshire that one might suggest a new coinage, ‘Conradnorism’ – to denote the mysterious yet perfect fit between an individual and an landscape. Vibrant and very charming… his love for the place shines out.” – Rose Tremain\n\nWatch Peter J. Conradi reading from At the Bright Hem of God as part of Presteigne Digital 2020. Available until 31st December 2020.\n\nAuscultation\n\nAuscultation means listening and specifically, in medicine, listening to sounds that come from the body’s internal organs. If listening is a central theme of this collection, it is also about being heard. Ilse Pedler is poet of breadth and depth. There are poems about waiting rooms and surgical instruments, about crisis calls, about overhearing farmers and pet owners and colleagues. There are poems about surviving a stern childhood and a heartbreaking sequence about being a stepmother. This is a compelling set of poems from a striking new voice.\n\n“In this unique and utterly original collection, Ilse Pedler explores the brutal and beautiful world of being a vet and a stepmother. This is a book filled with blood, but also with air and light, a book of hard-won knowledge, a book that is both pragmatic and tender, about listening and being listened to, and the types of care we give and receive.” – Kim Moore\n\n“‘Listen’, listen closely, these poems ask. Draw near and pay intimate attention to the minute beats and actions that surround and connect us – those of animals, other humans, and the environment. As a practising veterinary surgeon ‘at the warmth’s core’, Pedler explores the daily dramas and dilemmas of the consulting room, the operating theatre, the field, and brings in wider themes of scientific knowledge, family, fairytales, and belonging. The precision in her language matches the precision in her noticing, as we recognise how ‘our bodies are never silent’ and she helps us marvel at ‘the soft persistence of tissue’.” – Heidi Williamson\n\nIlse Pedler reads her poem ‘Miss Freak’s Whelping Forceps’\n\nWatch the full online launch of Auscultation here:\n\nBadlands\n\nIndustrial smoke turns the noon sky black. Beneath its clouds the poorest people in Europe arrange flowers on a dictator’s grave. On Avienda de las Pulgas an Oldsmobile slows down for a better view. Emerging from a lemon grove is the last pedestrian in California. At a nuclear plant the only sound is the sighing of photocopiers. Another party of visitors gets ready for a tour. Welcome to Badlands. Our guides are a survivor of Europe’s most bizarre political regime, a poet who wishes to be abducted by aliens, and the author himself, reluctant aid worker, tourist with a computer tan, regretting his decision to call in at The Zoo for a quick one.\n\nIn these essays the writer travels from the impoverished of Albania to the scorched suburbia of Silicon Valley. On the way he encounters a foreign country called England, twenty thousand frozen lakes, and a desert of dinosaur bones. The people of Badlands include Coleridge and Ryan Giggs, Colonel Sanders and Freud, plus a host of minor deities from the numbing world of celebrity. Urban and rural, tragic and absurd, Badlands is a real place. But where the borders of Badlands begin, or finish, is difficult to say.\n\nBar 44: Tapas y Copas\n\nAs featured on BBC Saturday Kitchen\n\n“A great go-to recipe book.” – Matt Tebbutt\n\n“…every bit the equal of their cooking… the sort of tome that becomes battered and splattered with constant use.” – Tom Parker-Bowles\n\nBar 44: Tapas y Copas is the must-have Spanish cook book. Created by brothers Owen and Tom Morgan, the force behind critically acclaimed, family-run restaurant group Bar 44, this selection of over one hundred recipes, each beautifully photographed, will take your tastebuds on an unforgettable Spanish getaway.\n\nBar 44: Tapas y Copas celebrates Spanish food and drink in equal measure. These delicious recipes – each tried and tested in the busy Bar 44 restaurants – elevate traditional Spanish cuisine to exciting new heights with dishes which look good and taste even better.\n\nChicken sobrassada and spiced yoghurt, beetroot gazpacho, tuna tartare with apple ajo blanco, lamb empanada, the best patatas bravas you will ever taste, strawberry and cava sorbet and pear and olive oil cake are just some of the dishes you can try in your very own kitchen. They tell you how to make moreish Spanish cocktails like their ever-popular Crema Catalana Old Fashioned and offer tips for making the perfect donostia-style Spanish gin and tonic, all accompanied by expert tuition on Sherry and Spanish wines from International Sherry Educator Owen.\n\nIn addition to mouth-watering recipes, the book is peppered with vignettes of how the Morgan brothers became restauranteurs, and the lengths they go to source ingredients and discover new dishes. The mountains, coasts and plains of their adopted country are their larder as they visit caves full of cheese and taste sherry at the feria in Jerez, taking you alongside them every step of the way.\n\nBask in the passion of two of the most knowledgeable people celebrating modern Spanish food, drink and culture in the UK. More than just a cookbook, Bar 44: Tapas y Copas is a must-have experience which packs fun, food and flavour between the covers of a beautifully designed book.\n\nBasic Nest Architecture\n\nLonglisted for the Michael Murphy Memorial Prize 2019\n\n‘With her keen senses, she celebrates nature in all its glory. ’ – Disclaimer Magazine\n\n‘Powerful and tender’ – Mslexia\n\nBasic Nest Architecture, Polly Atkin’s first collection of poetry, marks a startling new talent. Known for a couple of prize-winning pamphlets, including her Seren/Mslexia prize-winning Shadow Dispatches, and her Michael Marks nominated Bone Song, and widely shortlisted for competitions, Atkin has already built up a loyal readership for her complex, intelligent, densely metaphorical lyrics, often inspired by the beauties of the Lake District where she has made her home for a decade.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections: the first contains poems quite directly inspired by the author’s move from the city to the Lakes. In the beautifully bee-haunted (And Troubadour prize-winning) ‘Colony Collapse Disorder’ the protagonist says “To leave the City was to leave one’s memory./Outside was a garden gone wild.” The poems begin to discover and enact the spells cast by nature, landscapes and animals become charged with tension as in ‘Heron/Snow’ where the bird carries “worlds in the cipher of your feathers.” Later, one of the lakes appears like “a blue-green iris of one great eye”. The author’s imaginative grasp excludes cliché, and she expertly grapples with her own animal obsessions as in the lively ‘Road-Kill’.\n\nMost of section two moves back in time and uncovers earlier locations and subjects. It is clear that the celestial heavens, weathers and things seen from city windows inspired the poet earlier in her development. But there is a distinct sense of claustrophobia in some of the poems like ‘Dreams’: “You are sick to death of my dreams./I drag them out, one after the other.” The wonderful ‘Strength in Winter’ is a parade of glorious detail concerning the Constellation Leo in all its manifestations, it is a full-bodied fantasy to console the protagonist for the gloom of the season.\n\nThe final section contains more painful work, literally and figuratively. These poems are hints from the autobiography of the poet who suffered for many years from a mysterious and debilitating illness. The poem ‘Begin’ recalls a sixteen-year old, purloining doctor’s letters from her mother’s handbag so she could try to secretly decipher them, as if it is almost a game: “then you play medical snap with the encyclopedia, trying to match up your blood with its names.” Other poems are less literal, but use these experiences to reach-out towards a wider metaphor, such as in ‘Imaging’ where an MRI inspires musing on other dimensions “I met its whirling motion in the dark”.\n\nThe remarkable poems in Basic Nest Architecture are a testament to the persistence and artistry of Polly Atkin. As well as being profoundly personal, they reach out to the modern world in all it’s complexity and diversity.\n\nBattery Rocks\n\nWinner of the Society of Authors Arthur Welton Award\n\n“Each poem rolls in and out like the sea and refreshes like a wild swim.” – Roger Robinson\n\nIn Battery Rocks, Katrina Naomi returns to the Cornish swimming spot – Battery Rocks in Penzance – every day for a year. On each swim, she finds something fresh and invigorating.\n\nExploring the sea in all its mercurial forms, Naomi questions the world through the lens of nature and the more than human. Poems like ‘And if there were no sea?’, which recognises both the power and danger of the sea, as well as all that would be lost if it didn’t exist, approach the climate emergency from aslant, offering a new take on one of the most pressing concerns of our times.\n\nNaomi also examines issues of fear, strength and vulnerability, writing in response to an attempted rape and other experienced attacks. She questions how she can feel safer alone, in a raging sea in winter, in nothing but a swimming costume, than on dry land. In poems like ‘The Sea Speaks’ and ‘i.m. Sarah Everard’, the risks of swimming are juxtaposed with the dangers on shore for women.\n\nBattery Rocks revels in friendship, love and community. The Cornish language and landscape are deeply entwined, and Naomi deftly experiments with poems in Kernewek (Cornish) and English. The collection ends in the strange beauty of ‘in the kelp forest’, winner of the prestigious Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry. Finding joy through immersion in nature, Battery Rocks is a thoughtful meditation on nature, risk, swimming and the sea.\n\nBatu-Angas, Envisioning Nature with Alfred Russel Wallace\n\n“This book is a fascinating exploration of the life of Alfred Russel Wallace, whose independent discovery of natural selection in 1858 triggered Darwin’s publication of The Origin of Species. Wallace made important journeys to the Amazon and Indonesia, and Cluysenaar’s delicate and graceful poems (framed with quotations from Wallace and images of the animals and plants he collected) deftly explore the channels that these journeys opened up. “Poem VII” describes Wallace catching a clear-winged butterfly in the Amazon. The writing moves from haiku-like evocations of the butterfly’s flight to a sense of immense measures of time – “This is the living form / of the rainforest’s age, an art / grown of its interactions / which now he has gathered up / into a triangle, dying, / that knowledge folded away”. Cluysenaar’s work articulates the tension between the slow evolution of a species and the scope and value of a single life, her writing at times attempting to reimagine the processes of natural selection as a kind of intensely personal experience – “I wish I could sense in myself some transformation . . . something adequate to dimensions / not yet begun, or dreamt of”; “Such sudden terrors part / of the huge slow changes.”\n\nThe Guardian, October 2008\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913), one of the most famous scientists of the 19th century and best known today as the co-discoverer with Charles Darwin of the theory of evolution, is the inspiration for this beautiful sequence of poems by Anne Cluysenaar. The title (meaning ‘burnt rocks or cooled lava’) is derived from the language spoken on the volcanic island of Ternate, in the Malay Archipelago, where Wallace experienced that ‘flash’ of inspiration which brought together his observations as a naturalist, leading him to describe his theory in a letter to Charles Darwin which encouraged Darwin to publish The Origin of Species. 2008 is the 150th anniversary of the discovery of natural selection by Wallace and Darwin.\n\nA field trip that passed by Wallace’s birthplace near Usk on the Wales/England border triggered the author’s research into the scientist’s journeys through the Amazonian rainforests and the jungles of the Malay Archipelago as well as the lush landscapes surrounding the river Usk, which he explored as a child and young man. Tracing Wallace’s travels, the poet becomes aware of echoes and tensions between his responses and her own. Orchids, orang-utans, rare beetles, butterflies and birds of paradise, collected by Wallace and preserved in British collections, are sought out and intensely re-experienced.\n\nThe book opens with an introduction by Wallace expert Charles Smith, of the University of Kentucky, and a Foreword by the poet. The poems are accompanied by a rich selection of images: some that Wallace chose to illustrate his travels, including a sketch by Wallace himself, together with photographs of Wallace specimens and of living animals and plants. Also included are photographs of Wallace and of his birthplace on the banks of the river Usk in Wales.\n\nBehind the Canvas\n\nKevin Sinnott is one of the most popular artists in Britain: his figures in landscape and images of human relationships are widely sought-after by collectors and museums. This unusual book celebrates his sixtieth birthday – unusual in that it is written by the artist himself. Part autobiography, part exploration of his art, it describes the British art scene over the last thirty years through personal experience. Sinnott’s life is a great human interest story: struggling artist, success in London, downturn, success in America, rebirth in his native Wales. Behind the Canvas is real life, not an art historian’s interpretation.\n\nThe book has much to say about (and a contribution to make to) ‘art history’, discussing key works, turning points, influences, artistic fashion, trends, and the art media. Written with intelligence and immediacy, and beautifully illustrated with Sinnott’s vivid and lively paintings, Behind the Canvas is an informative and singular book which tells the reader as much, more even, about the world of British art in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries than any critical book can.\n\nBorn in South Wales in 1947, Kevin Sinnott is a contemporary Welsh artist with a truly i"
