        "text": "Chief Rabbis of Ireland\n\nwith jurisdiction solely throughout the Republic of Ireland (formerly the Irish Free State)\n\n(To view a short profile of a chief rabbi - hold the curser over his name.)\n\nThe office of Chief Rabbi of Ireland existed from 1922 to 2008 (with a notable break from 1936 to 1948) and 33 Bloomfield Avenue was the home to successive Chief Rabbis of Ireland\n\nIn the early 1950s, Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits wrote: \"The organisation of Dublin's Jewish life is distinguished by a high measure of decentralisation. There are seven Orthodox synagogues of varying sizes, all administered as completely independent units. Their combined membership covers over 90% of all Jewish families...The sole organizational link uniting these seven Hebrew congregations are the chief rabbinate and the congregations' representation on the Representative Council and the Board of Shechita...Though most synagogues originally employed rabbis of their own, all pulpits have been vacant for some time. These are now occupied by rotation by the Chief Rabbi, assisted in his rabbinical work by Dayan Z Alony (see below).\"(xi)\n\nThe Chief Rabbis of Ireland were as follows:\n\n1922 to 1936 - Rabbi Isaac Halevi Herzog\n\n1949 to 1958 - Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits\n\n1959 to 1979 - Rabbi Isaac Cohen\n\n1979 to 1985 - Rabbi David Rosen\n\n1985 to 1992 - Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis\n\n1993 to 1994 - Rabbi Simon Harris\n\n1996 to 2000 - Rabbi Gavin Broder\n\n2001 to 2008 - Rabbi Yaakov Pearlman\n\n2008 to 2023 - vacant\n\nfrom 2023 - Rabbi Yoni Wieder\n\nCommunal Rabbis and Spiritual Leaders of the Dublin Community\n\nIn 1919, a number of Dublin congregations combined to appoint Rabbi Isaac Halevi Herzog rabbi of the Dublin Jewish community, as opposed to any one synagogue(xxii) - he became Chief Rabbi of Ireland in 1922.\n\nDayan S. Zalmon Yosef Alony, dayan of the Dublin Beth Din from 1941 until 1977, assisted the Chief Rabbi of Ireland in fulfilling the ministerial needs of Orthodox synagogues in Dublin, none of which had their own minister.(xxiii)\n\nRabbi David Radomsky, communal rabbi from 1985 until 1988.(xxiv)\n\nRabbi Zalman Lent, being the only resident rabbi in the Republic of Ireland from 2008 to 2023, he performed many of the duties of an acting Chief Rabbi of Ireland and a communal rabbi.\n\nCantor Alwyn Shulman - communal cantor from 1991 until 2020."
