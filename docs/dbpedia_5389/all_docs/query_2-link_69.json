M. Fullerton (cox), M Keeley, R. Adamson, A. Maughan, D. Wainewright, G. Hamilton, M Carnegie, P Hobart, S. Cook. (Reserves: D. Tallis. T Burgess). FROM THE WARDEN, DR. EVAN BURGE • It seems a long time since the last <strong>Trinity</strong> Newletter. The rush of events has overtaken our good intentions, and I am <strong>no</strong>w writing on the eve of leaving for a period of leave abroad. The highlight is to be a <strong>Trinity</strong> Fleur-de-Lys Dinner in London on November 7th, but I expect also to visit other <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong>s in Toronto, Hartford Connecticut, Dublin, Oxford and Cambridge before returning via Jerusalem on December 10th. The first day of September 1979 marked a milestone in our history. On that day the <strong>Trinity</strong> <strong>College</strong> Act \"to incorporate <strong>Trinity</strong> - <strong>College</strong>, amend the Janet Clarke Hall Act of 1962, and for other purposes\" took effect. A detailed account of this legislation appears elsewhere in this <strong>Newsletter</strong>. Among other things, it means that anyone who has ever been a resident or <strong>no</strong>n-resident member of the <strong>College</strong> for three or more terms is legally, and in the fullest sense of the word, a member of the <strong>College</strong> for life — unless excluded for good reason. I very much hope that this continuing membership will mean a good deal in practice as well as in theory. Both 1979 and <strong>1980</strong> have been <strong>no</strong>table for an atmosphere of enthusiasm and participation within the <strong>College</strong>. There were many signs of this: among them, the large tur<strong>no</strong>ut of supporters for <strong>College</strong> sporting events and <strong>Trinity</strong>'s success last year in winning both the Tickner Cup for Inter Collegiate Sport and the Holmes Cup for Women's Sports. At the end of 1979, and again in the last few weeks, I circulated a questionnaire among the students asking for comments on almost all aspects of our community life. It is rewarding and reassuring to receive back many comments like this: \"<strong>Trinity</strong> is a great place to be — and that's the understatement of the year.\" As well as in sport and the general atmosphere, the <strong>College</strong> has done well in academic terms. The award of the 1979 Victorian Rhodes Scholarship to a <strong>Trinity</strong> man, Dr. Elsdon Storey put the finishing touch to a fine year. Our overall success, however, led to an unexpected embarrassment. So many people wanted to come into <strong>Trinity</strong> in <strong>1980</strong> that nearly two hundred had to be turned away. It would have been possible to fill the vacancies entirely with the sons and daughters, brothers and sisters of former and present residents of <strong>Trinity</strong>. Family connexions are very important to us. A wise selection policy can<strong>no</strong>t, however, allow these to dominate over every other consideration. I find it distressing <strong>no</strong>t to offer a place to someone who has looked forward to coming here, sometimes for years. On present indications, even more are applying to <strong>Trinity</strong> for 1981! The Warden, Evan L. Burpe."
