        "text": "Introduction\n\nA few years ago I bumped into a lad I’d known at Highfield School. This brief encounter got me thinking of my time at Highfield. Most of the staff were great and on the whole I’d really enjoyed the few years I spent there, but at the time I really hadn’t liked Harry Swan, the headmaster. He was a man of very small stature but enormous presence. He stood no nonsense and he used the cane for the slightest offense. Unfortunately I was an all too frequent recipient of that cane. Yes, I’d really disliked Harry Swan, but over the years since I left Highfield, especially after I’d entered the teaching profession myself, I began to understand what a tough job he’d had and how well he’d tackled it. Gradually I came to respect, even admire Mr Swan. Once my attitude to Mr Swan had mellowed, I was able to understand just how much I owed him. I’m now certain that my life-long love of maths stemmed directly from a time when he stood in for our class teacher and gave us a fascinating introduction to algebra.\n\nBut what had become of Harry Swan? Obviously he’d be dead, but I’d never heard of his passing. Rowlands Gill was a fairly small place and news spread fast. I’d heard of the deaths of many, probably most, of my former teachers at Highfield, but nothing of Mr Swan. I hate mysteries, and I’m a keen local historian, so I decided there and then to try to find what I could about the life and death of my former headmaster. It’s taken me a while, but with the very recent release of some new records I was able to break through a final brick wall and complete this very brief biography of Henry Swan.\n\nLife of Henry Swan\n\nHenry Swan was born in Dipton on 24th September 1902, the son of Colliery Checkweighman, John Edmund Swan, and his wife Alice. The family lived at 13 Swinburne Terrace, Dipton – which is still stands on the main road through the village – and Henry grew up there with his parents and his half-sister, Ettie Wilkinson, who was nine years his senior. In 1910, when Henry was seven, his parents had another son who was christened Rowland Cornford Swan.\n\nHenry’s father had been active in local politics for some time, but in 1918, when Henry was 16, John Edmund Swan was elected Labour MP for Barnard Castle. Unfortunately his parliamentary career was to be rather short-lived; he lost his seat to a Tory at the next General Election in 1922. John Edmund didn’t stand for Parliament again, but he rose to great heights in local politics: he served as an Agent of the Durham Miners’ Association and served as its General Secretary from 1935 to 1945, succeeding the legendary Peter Lee.\n\nWhile his father was serving as an MP, Henry trained at Bede Training College in Durham and he obtained his Board of Education Certificate. He took up his first teaching appointment as an Assistant Master at Rowlands Gill Council School in 1923. This was to be a very long and successful appointment: he taught at that same school until 1948. Not content with his basic teaching qualification, Mr Swan increased his versatility by studying for City and Guilds qualifications in Handicrafts, and for the Royal Horticultural Society Certificate in School and Cottage Gardening.\n\nIn 1927 Henry married a Tow Law-born lass called Iverene Phillipson. Henry had been living in Delight Row, Dipton for several years, but immediately after his marriage he and his wife moved into the house which was to be their home for nearly 50 years: “Neathsdale” on Dene Avenue, Rowlands Gill. This would be much more convenient for Henry travelling to and from work. In 1931 their first and, as it turned out, only child Joan was born.\n\nOnce established in Rowlands Gill, Henry involved himself in local politics and was soon elected to represent Rowlands Gill and Lockhaugh Ward on Blaydon Urban District Council. His political career reached its pinnacle in 1944 when Councillor Henry Swan was picked by his fellow councillors to serve as Chairman of Blaydon UDC, the equivalent of Mayor today.\n\nWhen war broke in 1939, Henry Swan was given two important part-time jobs. He was to serve on Blaydon’s Food Control Committee, and he was appointed Head Air Raid Warden for Rowlands Gill and Lockhaugh in charge of the 35 or so full and part-time Wardens in the village. Many people questioned Henry’s suitability for this second role, claiming it was just a political appointment, but when he was tested he was to prove his detractors wrong.\n\nIn the early hours of May 1st 1942 Lockhaugh was heavily bombed and strafed with machine-gun fire. Many of the houses on the main road and Thornley Lane lost their roofs, and there was a lot of damage to windows, walls and ceilings. When the police arrived on the scene they were surprised to find that the Wardens led by Henry Swan had already searched all the damaged houses and they’d accounted for all the residents too. Afterwards the village policeman, Bill Meehan, praised Henry Swan and said he’d displayed outstanding leadership and organisational skills that night.\n\nOn 31st August 1947 the long-serving headmaster at Highfield Mixed School, Mr J.W. Mason, retired, and Henry Swan was appointed to be his successor. He took up his appointment on 1st June 1948. Highfield Mixed School had pupils aged 8 to 15 years and at the time of his appointment it had 212 pupils on its books. Because of the post-war baby boom and the building of Highfield Council Estate, the numbers on the books rose quickly over the next eight years to a maximum of 440 in September 1956 then tailed off to around 300 by 1963. Dividing the pupils into classes, and arranging classrooms and staffing for such wildly varying numbers was a major and continuing headache throughout Mr Swan’s time at Highfield. All this on top of the usual day to day responsibilities of any headmaster made this a particularly challenging job.\n\nIt was to get worse. Every year the school had lost some pupils to Hookergate Grammar School or High Spen Secondary Modern at the age of 11 or 12, but many pupils stayed on at Highfield until they left school at 15. When High Spen Secondary Modern was replaced by the much bigger Rowlands Gill Secondary Modern in September 1964, all 11+ pupils in the area who didn’t go to Hookergate would now automatically go the new Secondary Modern. Highfield Mixed was now Highfield Junior School taking only pupils up to the age of 11. There were now only 175 pupils on Highfield’s books with 6 staff. Losing all his senior pupils must have been really awful for Mr Swan who had excelled at careers advice and guidance for his school leavers. Perhaps he was glad that retirement was only three years away.\n\nHenry Swan retired on 31st August 1967, just before his 65th birthday. He now had more time to devote to his main hobby – breeding birds – and to his work as a Justice of the Peace. He remained in the village until 1975 and then he and his wife emigrated to the USA to live with their daughter Joan and son-in-law Eric. Henry Swan died at the age of 81 in February 1984 in the City of Alexander, a small settlement on the outskirts of Little Rock, Arkansas. His widow, Iverene, died 11 years later on 4th November 1995.\n\nFootnote 1. Henry Swan’s Siblings.\n\nHenry’s elder half sister, Ettie Wilkinson, married chauffeur George Richardson and they set up home at Berry Edge near Consett. They had two children: Frederick in 1919 and Alice in 1920. Ettie died in 1957.\n\nHenry’s younger brother, Rowland Cornford Swan, followed his elder brother into teaching. He was working at Mablethorpe in Lincolnshire when he met and married Peggy Fairclough. Rowland and Peggy had one child, Sandra, in 1938. Rowland Cornford Swan died in Leicester in 1975.\n\nFootnote 2. He might have been Henry Spink!\n\nJohn Edmund Swan, Henry’s father, was born in 1878, the illegitimate son of Isabella Alice Swan. When John Edmund was three, his mother married a coal miner called John Spink. They raised John Edmund as John Edmund Spink and he might well have retained that name had it not been for the fact that his mother and step-father split up when John Edmund was in his late teens. He then reverted to his birth-name, John Edmund Swan. If John Edmund had remained John Edmund Spink and married under that name, our headmaster might well have been Henry Spink.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe most significant event of 2015 for the Pears household was undoubtedly the loss of our little feline friend Samantha on January 5th. Although it’s nearly a year since we lost her, she’s greatly missed and I still find myself looking for her when I enter the house after being out for a while. On a personal level, the most significant event I suppose was my 70th birthday! Not that I mind being 70, but it’s a landmark nonetheless.\n\nThere’s been a huge change in our weekly routine as Chris is now taking a much bigger role in looking after her mother who is 99. Christine’s sister, Carol, is still bearing the brunt of the task, but Chris is now taking responsibility during the day on three or four days a week.\n\nHealth\n\nOnce again, we’ve been very lucky healthwise with no major problems for either of us in 2015. We had our annual Diabetic Eye Screening and other eye tests with Tony Nurowski at Summers Opticians, Low Fell in February and our Diabetic Reviews at our GP surgery in March and September. These reviews include comprehensive blood tests and in many ways act as general health checks. During the September review we received our annual flu jabs – not 100% effective, but any protection is better than none. Our chiropodist, Michael Gallagher, still visits us every six weeks to check our feet. During the year he’s opened a little surgery just a quarter mile away, but we still prefer him to visit us at home.\n\nOur only hospital visits during the year were a couple of routine nurse appointments and ultrasound scans for Chris – everything was fine – and a couple of hearing aid appointments for me. I’ll need to make another hearing aid appointment soon as my left hearing aid seems to have gone rather quiet.\n\nOur dentist has changed yet again! We had our 6-monthly dental checks in April and October, and on our October visit we found that our dentist, Samira Rais, who we’d only seen twice, had gone back to India. So we have yet another new dentist, Diane Stevenson, who is the senior member of the practice. The practice itself has changed too. It was Robson and Partners until last year – now it’s part of a large company called Oasis Dental Care. We’re very happy with our new dentist, but not so certain we like the new set up.\n\nFamily\n\nThere have been several happy additions to the family during the course of the year, including, in March, Lara, daughter of my cousin’s daughter, Lisa Lumley; in July, Jakob-Terry, son of my third cousin, Sarah Jane Taylor; and, just six days before Christmas, Isabel Eden, daughter of my second cousin once removed, Alexandria Newby. And finally, the addition of a husband rather than a baby – my cousin’s daughter, Amy Smith, eloped to Gretna Green on December 30th to marry Scott Anthony Hamblin. Best wishes to all of them.\n\n2015 saw some terribly sad events too. Ethel Waugh, my brother-in-law’s mother, died in January, and my uncle, Ray Nattrass, died in July. They were both lovely people and will be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with their families. Both Ray and Ethel were very elderly and both had been ill for a while, but there was one death in my extended family of a much younger man. Gordon Ross Philipson, a much loved and respected school teacher in Brisbane, Australia, died suddenly on June 25th at the age of only 54. His many friends, students and ex-students have left some wonderful tributes on his Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/gordonross.philipson\n\nDuring the year I also found out about two family deaths in 2014 – Jean Bright, the widow of my dad’s cousin, Arthur; and on the other side of the planet in New Zealand, Eileen McCombe, step-daughter of my great uncle Arthur Axford. When my parents were alive, such was the efficiency of the family grapevine that I would have heard of events like these within hours. Now I only seem to find out that people have passed away when Christmas cards are returned.\n\nIt was really nice to see my cousin Ray who visited us in August, and Christine’s cousin Simon and his wife Zoe who visited in May, but the main family get-together of the year was the Walker family reunion at the Ravensworth Arms on October 3rd which I had the pleasure of organising. All descendants of my maternal grandfather Joseph Walker were invited and we had 28 attendees, including my cousin Ian from Calgary in Canada. Though some cousins had attended uncle Ray’s funeral in July, we hadn’t seen many of them for quite a few years, and it was great to see them all again.\n\nMy main family history research subjects this year were the siblings of my great-great-grandfather, Francis Pears. He was one of five children of Francis Pears Snr and Hannah nee Armstrong who’d married at Hexham in 1836. The family comprised Thomas born 1837, William born 1838, Francis born 1840, John born 1843 and Joseph born 1846. Only two of the five, Francis and William, seemed to have left any descendants. I knew that the eldest, Thomas, had died young, but what became of the other two, John and Joseph, was a bit of a mystery. I think I’ve just about cracked it – just a few “t”s to cross and “i”s to dot.\n\nThe main frustration with autosomal DNA results is that the DNA shared with a “match” could have come through any branch of the family. You know you’re related, but that’s all, and that makes the search for the common ancestors very difficult. One of the best ways of narrowing down the possibilities is to persuade relations to test as well, then, any matches you share with that relative, must be descendants of the ancestors you share with that relative. So far I’ve only persuaded two relations to test: my first cousin Ray Urwin and my third cousin Tony Freeman. We await the result of Tony’s test, but we got Ray’s results in April and we share many matches, all of whom must be related to us through one of our common grandparents, Joseph Walker and Elizabeth nee Shields. So we can now confidently say that our common ancestors with those matches will be ancestors of Joseph or Elizabeth, greatly easing the task of identifying them.\n\nFriends\n\nWe still have our weekly visit to the Ravensworth Arms for a meal and that is where we generally choose as a venue to meet friends too. This year we met with friends Marian & Geoff for meals on three occasions – I’ve known Marian since we were toddlers in Rowlands Gill, so we have a lot to talk about. We’ve made friends with Paola, the wonderful vet who did so much for Samantha our cat, and we’ve had five most enjoyable meals with her at the Ravensworth. Without Paola’s help we would have lost our cat much earlier, so we will always be most grateful to her.\n\nWe had several meals at The Ravensworth with “The Gang” – a group of eight or nine family historians of similar vintage to ourselves, and with the “Famous Five” a group of six or seven (we’ve grown) from the same year at Hookergate Grammar School. The Famous Five also had two most enjoyable outings in 2015: the first involved a meal at the Washington Arms followed by a look around Washington Old Hall, the second, a meal at The Sun in Morpeth followed by a visit to Wallington Hall.\n\nWe don’t get to many of the monthly meals organised by The Retired Members Association of my former union; this year we only managed to make two of their get togethers – at the Washington Arms and at the County Cricket Ground at Chester-le-Street. I also continued to meet with good friend and former classmate, Bernard, every month at the Ravensworth. We never seem to run out of things to natter about. Finally, I met with Geordie exile Alan Dixon and his niece Maria for a cup of tea in Saltwell Park. Alan has since moved from Nottinghamshire to the Pembrokeshire coast so I don’t think he’ll be able to visit his homeland as often as he did.\n\nNeighbourhood\n\nOur local “corner shop,” a Nisa outlet run by Steve Barratt, has completed its expansion into two adjacent units, and our local Co-op Food store has been completely refitted. Both stores open until late at night and both can now stock many more lines than before – very convenient for local residents. There’s also new Cafe/Community Rooms on the main road called The Nest. The community rooms seem very busy with classes of various types and the cafe is proving popular, particularly with mothers and little children. The cafe looks very nice, but it’s noisy and doesn’t serve the sort of food we like, so I don’t think we’ll be using it. Fortunately business at the nearby Stairwayz Cafe and at the Chatterbox 592 Cafe further along the road, which we do use from time to time, doesn’t seem to have suffered.\n\nThere were huge changes too at the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital with the opening of the new state of the art Accident and Emergency Department and new Main Entrance. Fortunately we haven’t had occasion to use A & E since the opening, but we did attend a talk in June on “Emergency Care at the QE” which described the new facilities in detail and explained how they would work. The problem of finding one’s way around the hospital has also been addressed with various areas of the hospital now colour-coded, and the direction signs have been coloured to match these. In July I volunteered to help test the new signage. There were about twenty of us involved and we were divided into pairs and given a series of tests where we were told to forget everything we knew about the hospital and navigate from given start points to given end points using only the hospital signs. Then we had to report back to a debriefing session and describe the problems we’d encountered. We found quite a number of issues, many of which, I’m pleased to say, have since been rectified.\n\nRecreation\n\nMy reading material covers a wide range of subjects – science, technology, history, language, even theology – but the one thing shared by at least 90% of the books I read is that they are non-fiction. I’ve barely read any fiction since I was a youngster, and as a youngster my favourite reads were the Famous Five and Secret Seven books by Agatha Christie. In the summer I was browsing the bookshelves in a local charity shop and I spotted a collection of five Famous Five books and I bought them on an impulse. I quickly read the lot, and I was hooked again. So I bought the full set of 21 Famous Five books, plus a volume of FF short stories. They didn’t last long either, so I bought the full set of 15 Secret Seven books, plus a volume of SS short stories, and I read those. I’ll probably read them all again before too long – I must have reached my second childhood already.\n\nNeither Chris nor I travel too well so we haven’t been on a holiday for many years. As an alternative we thought we might try staying at some local hotel for a day or two – and where better, we thought, than a place we know very well, the Ravensworth Arms. It’s less than three miles from our home, but it’s set in wonderful countryside with some lovely walks and views. So in June we spent one night there just to try it out – we stayed in one of the chalets which was originally part of a blacksmith’s shop – and we enjoyed it. So in August we stayed for two nights in the same room, and we repeated the experience in October and again in November. No doubt we’ll do the same in 2016.\n\nPerhaps not quite recreation, but we’ve been spending a lot of time de-cluttering. I’ve been going through a cupboard full of folders deciding what should go and what should stay. Chris has being doing similar things with her old catalogues and paperwork. Where does such rubbish come from? Nearly all of it ended up being recycled. I still have a filing cabinet and a few boxes to tackle, but I’m having a break at present. We also tacked our old coal-house and outside toilet which were intended to be storage areas for gardening tools and DIY odds and ends, and a workshop, but had morphed over the years into a tip. In August we hired a large skip for a day and got stuck into the task. It was worth the effort.\n\nGadgets and Tech.\n\nAs usual I couldn’t help buying what certain people unkindly refer to as Boys Toys, though of course they are in truth indispensable household aids. Last Christmas I got really frustrated trying to source and buy replacement bulbs for our ageing Christmas tree lights, so early in January I bought a set of 50 LED lights and we used them this Christmas for the first time. They are illuminating our tree as I write – just a nice steady multi-coloured display, though I could choose various types of flashing, fading or chasing sequences if I felt so inclined.\n\nAround Easter time I bought some Wi-Fi security cameras which I’ve mounted in various parts of our abode. These can be armed using a mobile phone or tablet when we go out, and once armed, any movement in their field of view or any sound will result in an urgent e-mail being sent to me with an image of whatever triggered the camera attached. I can also view a video/sound recording which starts 7 seconds before the camera was triggered.\n\nSome 46 years ago I was teaching in a secondary school at Sunderland, and on the day we broke up for the Christmas holidays I found myself looking after my own form, who were first years. We decided we’d sing carols and other popular songs, and as there was a rather expensive reel-to-reel tape recorder set up in the room, I recorded the occasion. I later transferred the recording to a cassette, took the cassette home and put it in a safe place. So safe,in fact, that I didn’t come across the cassette again until June this year. I no longer had a cassette player so I took the cassette to a local chap who can transfer sound recordings to MP3 files. What a wonderful experience it was to play that recording and relive that December lesson from so long ago – tears were rolling down my cheeks as I remembered those lovely kids. Strange to think they’ll all now be 57 or 58 years of age and very likely grandparents.\n\nI’ve had a good selection of Kindle books for quite some time and I had been reading them on my PC, tablet or even on my phone. In July I saw a very cheap Kindle Paperwhite in the Gateshead branch of CeX and I couldn’t resist buying it. What a difference it makes! It’s so easy to use, so now I use the Paperwhite exclusively to access my e-book library.\n\nTelephone marketeers are an increasingly irritating curse, and I’d had enough. Despite being registered on the Telephone Preference Service database, which marketeers are supposed to check before calling anyone, I was getting a ridiculous number of such calls. To try to minimise this I bought a pair of BT8500 phones which are designed to counter marketeers. To put it simply, the only callers who can get straight through are those in my contacts list – everyone else has to jump through hoops to get through. In the two months since I installed these phones I haven’t had a single marketing call.\n\nThe final gadget of the year was actually a 70th birthday present from my school-friend, Dave Routledge – a pair of bluetooth headphones. Now I can listen to music or video soundtracks from my tablet without having to rely on the tinny little built-in loudspeakers. I’d never been tempted to buy headphones myself, but now that I’ve used them I wish I’d had them years ago.\n\nEntertainment\n\nAnother great year at Gateshead’s Little Theatre with the usual faboulous selection of plays. Of the ten productions during the year, Chris and I attended nine – The Ladykillers, Playhouse Creatures, The Dumb Waiter/Betrayal, Miranda, Blue Stockings, Ladies of Spirit, Get Up & Tie Your Fingers, Heatstroke and The Hound of the Baskervilles – and enjoyed every one. We also went to the Theatre Royal several times during the year and we saw Puttin’ on the Ritz, Oklahoma , And Then There Were None, The Sound of Music, and the fantastic pantomime Dick Whittington.\n\nOur taste in music is rather varied as can be seen from the concerts we attended in 2015. In January we went to a concert at Gateshead Heritage Centre by Concert Royal entitled Under the Greenwood Tree – sounds from the baroque and classical eras played on period instruments. Concert Royal features harpsichordist, John Treherne MBE, who is the conductor of the Gateshead Youth Orchestra and former Head of Music Service for Gateshead Borough.\n\nThe marvellous New Century Ragtime Orchestra generally puts on two shows a year at The Caedmon Hall, Gateshead Library and we wouldn’t miss them for anything. This year the shows were in February and July and featured their regular vocalist Caroline Irwin. The July show also featured guest pianists Stephanie Trick and Paolo Alderighi. We’ve already booked for the first of the 2016 shows. Zulu Wail by the New Century Ragtime Orchestra\n\nIn April we went to a rock/folk concert at the Caedmon Hall by Larkin Poe, a band from Atlanta, Georgia fronted by two talented young sisters, Megan and Rebecca Lovell. Such a range of songs – wild, hot, haunting – and incredible effects from the slide guitar played by Megan. This band has played at Glastonbury and has recently backed several top flight entertainers, including Elvis Costello on two of his tours. Backing Larkin Poe at the Caedmon was an excellent local folk group called Gilded (sic) Thieves A wonderful night’s entertainment . Don’t by Larkin Poe\n\nTalks\n\nEarly in the year we attended several of the “Library Lates” events at the Central Library. Five or six library staff organise these for 20 or so members of the public. At these we have a bite to eat followed by a talk on the evening’s topic liberally sprinkled with book readings, and we end with a quiz based on what we should have learnt from the event. Topics this year included Past Times and Crimes, Celebrating Children’s Fiction, and 30 Years of Hamish Hamilton.\n\nAlso at the Central Library, I attended a talk on “The Liberation of Belson” and a magical event by History Wardrobe on “Fairy Tale Fashion;” and at Gateshead Heritage Centre I went to some wonderful talks on a huge variety of historical topics: Enter the Word of Jane Austen, People Plaques and Places, As I cam’ through Sandgate, Home Front on Tyneside in WW1, Laurel and Hardy, Medicine in WW1 and Georgian Geordies.\n\nI usually manage at least one history course a year and this year was no exception. In February I enrolled on a 5 -week course on The Great War – the beginnings with Anthea Lang and Malcolm Grady. Sadly I was not able to get to the next course in the WW1 series dealing with events of 1916.\n\nThe Lit & Phil Library in Newcastle put on a lot of lectures every year, mostly on subjects of little interest to me, but I always make a point of checking them out on the library website because, just occasionally, they have a real gem. This year there was a really intriguing item listed for October 15th: Uncovering Colossus – From Ludgate to Los Alamos given by Professor Brian Randell whom I know well. It turned out to be just as fascinating as the title suggested; it was the story of the fight to declassify details of the wartime computer called Colossus, a fight which was finally successful in the 1990s.\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth Hospital continued their Medicine for Members talks with some really interesting talks on What is a Pathology, Asthma and Emergency Care at the QE given by people who really know the subject: the consultants, nurses, technicians or scientists directly involved at the QE. Those of us who attended the Pathology talk in February were given the opportunity to tour the QE Pathology Centre the following month. We thoroughly enjoyed the talks and the tour.\n\nNewcastle Skeptics in the Pub changed its regular venue during the year. We had been meeting mainly at The Bridge Hotel with occasional forays to The Old George, but mid-way through 2015 we switched to the Tyneside Irish Centre in Newcastle’s Chinatown. Unlike The Bridge and The Old George, this venue is wheelchair accessible and can easily accommodate the much larger numbers we’ve been getting recently.\n\nThe new SitP committee put on a wonderfully diverse range of topics this year: Dying – What you Need to Know, Secrets of Money, Confessions of a former Health Food Shop Worker, How to Talk to the Dead, Ada Lovelace – Victoria Computing Visionary, BDSM and the UK, Tresspass is Good for Cities and Islam and Apostasy. They were all most enjoyable and thought-provoking, but my favourites were How to Talk to the Dead in which Ash Pryce, himself a talented illusionist, demonstrated the tricks employed by psychics and mediums, and BDSM and the UK in which Margaret Corvid introduced us to the world of bondage, domination and sado-masochism, a sub-culture I knew absolutely nothing about.\n\nTradesmen\n\nThis would have been an expensive year for us were it not for the skills and tenacity of appliance repair man, Marshall Grainger of South Shields. He repaired a blockage in the Washing Machine, a leak in the Dishwasher and a non-rotating brush in our Vacuum Cleaner. In each case we’d got to the stage of searching for a replacement because we’d just about given up on a repair being possible – but Mr Grainger came to the rescue.\n\nBack in the 80s, I took some mirrors from an old dressing table and mounted them directly on the walls in the living room and entrance passage. Chris had the idea of framing these to improve their appearance, so we asked joiner Michael Hood to tackle this, and he did a magnificent job. Over the years we’ve struggled to find a decent joiner with good problem-solving skills, and now we’ve found one. We subsequently asked him to replace damaged woodwork on a sink unit, and to box in some pipework, and I’m sure we’ll use his skills again in the future.\n\nIn addition to these, Bob Thornton and Russ Anderson kept our boiler heating, our toilet flushing and our shower draining, while George Jukes and Earl Clelland kept our garden tidy and our trees trimmed, and Peter and Paul of Abel Decorators turned some yellow doors white.\n\nUnusually I actually tackled a job myself in January – I remounted some wall-shelving which had collapsed under the weight of several very large books. It was quite a big job but I enjoyed getting back into DIY. It wasn’t long, however, before I was reminded why I’d given up this sort of activity years ago – every muscle ached and I was in agony for days!\n\nPostscript\n\nSo that was 2015 – not a bad year for us by any means, but lets hope for an even better 2016.\n\nA distant relative of mine – a 5th cousin to be precise – died suddenly a few days ago at the tragically young age of 56. He was Gordon Ross Philipson – universally known as Ross, a well-loved and well-respected school teacher at The Citipointe Christian College in Brisbane. When I heard this awful news, I was reminded of how interested Ross had been in some family history research I’d conducted in the early 1970s for his great-uncle, Ralph Shields Philipson of New Farm, Brisbane. I thought this might be of some interest to Ross’s friends and perhaps to others too, so I’ve reproduced a slightly abridged version here.\n\nRoss’s great-great grandfather, Nicholas Philipson, was born at Sinderhope near Allendale, Northumberland in 1809. He was the eldest of a large family and, like his father, he found work at the nearby Blackett-Beaumont Lead Mine. His male siblings: Francis, born 1812; George, born 1816; John, born 1818; and Edward, born 1829 all followed him into lead mining.\n\nLead miners were not, strictly-speaking, “employed” by the mine. A small group of two or three men would form a partnership and make an agreement – called a “bargain” – with the mine owners whereby they agreed that, for a year, the men would extract ore from a specified section of the mine for a specified sum per ton of ore. When and how the men worked was up to them, and most of them fitted mining in with a second job – small-scale farming – either on their own land or a relative’s. This arrangement worked well, the men could fulfil their obligations to the mine, look after their small-holdings and, most importantly, avoid working in the dangerous, dust-filled conditions which prevailed for hours after blasting. On days when they were blasting in the morning, the men would work on the land for a few hours until the noxious, lead-laden dust cleared.\n\nThe arrival of a new mining agent (a CEO in today’s terms), Thomas Sopwith, in 1847 put paid to a century or more of industrial harmony in Allendale. Sopwith couldn’t stand the idea of the men not working a full day, every day in the mine, so he insisted that they work 5 eight-hour shifts every week. This was not only inconvenient and impractical, it could be dangerous, but Sopwith insisted, and he even employed “spies” to check on the men’s arrival and departure. This was too much for the men, and early in 1849 they gathered together at the nearby Swinhope Primitive Methodist Chapel to discuss their grievances\n\nNicholas Philipson, a local preacher, was one of those organising the meeting, and he was also part of the delegation sent by the men to try to negotiate with Sopwith. Also in the group was Nicholas’s brother, George. Sopwith’s reaction was brutal – he fired all the members of the delegation on the spot. The entire workforce then came out on strike, but it was a hopeless cause – Sopwith wouldn’t budge. The men could return on his conditions or not at all – or rather, most of the men could return; the strike ringleaders were black-listed and would never again find work in any of the mines in the area.\n\nSome of the strikers eventually went back to work, but many left the area. In May 1849, a party of 58 left Allendale, made their way overland to Liverpool and sailed to New York on board the sailing ship “Guy Mannering” – their intended destination, the lead-mining town of Galena in Illinois. George Philipson was in that party. It was easy for George to up-sticks and move to the USA, he had no dependants, but it would not be so easy for Nicholas; he had a wife and child.\n\nIn 1847 Nicholas had married Haltwhistle lass, Elizabeth Thompson, and they’d had a daughter, Mary Elizabeth, the following year. When he was fired from his job, another child was already on its way – and Sarah Ann was duly born in December of that year. Nicholas took on labouring jobs and they managed to scrape a living, but when a third child came along – William Harland Philipson (Ross’s great-grandfather) – in 1852, they decided on a complete change of residence and occupation. They moved to Cross Hill, near Workington on the Cumberland coast and Nicholas got a job there as a bookseller! Things looked good, but not for long. Tragedy struck – Elizabeth contracted tuberculosis, and the three children had to be sent back to Allendale, where they were looked after by family members. After suffering for several years with that terrible and increasingly debilitating disease, Elizabeth died at Cross Hill on 14 March 1857. Nicholas returned to Allendale. He was exhausted and desolate, what was he to do?\n\nMeanwhile, brother George had been on the move. He’d initially settled, not in Galena, Illinois as planned, but rather just over the state border in the town of New Diggings, Wisconsin. He got a job in the lead mine there and even took the initial steps towards US citizenship, but he’d heard of the rich pickings in the goldfields of California and he couldn’t resist going there. He went via Panama, which was quicker and safer than joining a wagon train. This involved taking a boat down the Mississippi, a steamer down to Panama, making a comparatively short overland journey across Panama, and finally taking a steamer up the west coast to San Francisco. George stepped off the steamer “Northerner” in San Francisco harbour on 1 January 1852.\n\nHe had some limited success seeking gold in California, and he’d proudly sent some jewellery made from his gold back home to Allendale – but he soon realised he was two years too late for the richest finds. So when George heard of the discovery of gold in Victoria, Australia, he decided that was where his fortune lay. He sailed over the Pacific, landed in Melbourne and made his way up to the Ballarat area where he’d heard that prospects were good. Fortune certainly shone on George – he didn’t find gold, but he found a very good job. A mining company was desperate to find men with mining experience and the right spirit to manage their mines – and George fitted the bill perfectly in every way. So by the end of 1853, this young man from Allendale found himself in charge of a flourishing gold mine near Ballarat, Victoria.\n\nIn 1857, when George heard of his eldest brother’s tragic loss, he urged him to come to Australia. Nicholas agreed, and his youngest brother, Edward, decided to go along too. They sailed from Liverpool on 7 September 1857 on board the “Horizon” and arrived at Melbourne in December. Like George, Edward was quickly grabbed by one of the mining companies as a manager. Nicholas decided to go into farming rather than mining and soon managed to get himself established on some land. He also became a local preacher in the Ballarat Primitive Methodist Circuit.\n\nNicholas missed his children, so, in 1861, he decided to bring them to Australia. He couldn’t leave his farm to seek them in person, but his brother, seasoned traveller George, agreed to return to England to fetch them. George spent some time visiting friends and relatives back in Allendale, then, on 16 August 1862, he and Nicholas’s children, Mary Elizabeth, aged 13; Sarah Ann, aged 11; and William Harland, aged 9 sailed from Liverpool on board the “Matilda”. With them was George’s brother Francis and his son, William, aged 20. They arrived in Melbourne on 20 November. Both Francis and William soon found work in the mines at Ballarat.\n\nSo now there was quite a crowd of Philipsons around Ballarat – the four brothers, Nicholas, Francis, George and Edward, and four from the next generation – Francis’s son and Nicholas’s three children. All seemed to be doing well in their respective roles – but another tragedy was just over the horizon. It soon became apparent that Francis’s health was failing – he couldn’t get his breath. By 1864 he had to give up working altogether, and sadly, on 23 September 1866, he died. He was aged 54. Three days later he was laid to rest in Ballarat (old) Cemetery.\n\nWilliam Harland Philipson, Nicholas’s son, took up mining as soon as he was old enough. He got on well with his cousin, William, so when gold was discovered at Charters Towers in northern Queensland in 1871, it was no surprise to anyone when the two lads decided to drop everything and travel there together. They were soon joined by their uncle Edward.\n\nMore happy events. In 1875 Nicholas’s younger daughter, Sarah Ann, married Robert Richardson. Then, in 1879, William Philipson travelled back to England to visit relatives, and on his return to Charters Towers he surprised everyone by bringing back a new wife. While he’d been in Allendale he’d married his second-cousin, Margaret Philipson. Not to be outdone, William Harland also found himself a wife – he married Agnes Rebecca Jenkin at Charters Towers on 26 May 1881.\n\nBack in Victoria, things were going well for Sarah Ann – by 1880 she and her husband had had two of their four children – but her happiness was in sharp contrast to the despair felt by her elder sister, Mary Elizabeth. She’d hated Australia from the start, but it was just about tolerable while her sister was with her. Now she felt so alone – no friends and no prospects. She became addicted to laudanum, and on 26 November 1880 she took the leg rope she used when milking cows, and she used it to hang herself from a rafter in the barn. She was only 32 years of age. A “Magisterial Enquiry” was held next day at the farm and the verdict was “That the deceased Mary Elizabeth Philipson died at Hardies Hill on the 26th November 1880 from strangulation by hanging and that she committed suicide whilst in a state of unsound mind.”\n\nTragedy followed tragedy. A year after Mary’s death, on 5 October 1881, George died from hepatitis and exhaustion. He was 64 years old. It was all too much for Nicholas – he died soon afterwards, on 11 March 1882. He was 73. Now the only family members left in Victoria were Sarah Ann and her husband and children. Their descendants still live in the state.\n\nUp in Charters Towers, Edward, the only surviving brother, lived on until 7 May 1906, but left no descendants. His nephews William Philipson and William Harland Philipson, by contrast, both had large families, and their numerous descendants are now scattered throughout Queensland. They themselves died in 1920 and 1925 respectively.\n\nRecently I met up with a group of former classmates from Hookergate Grammar School for a meal. As usual when we meet, we talked about former schoolmates, teachers, scandals, school visits and notable events from our schooldays.\n\nOn this occasion Dave Routledge recalled the time in a first-year chemistry class when he and I thought it would be enormous fun to mix random chemicals in a test tube. Whatever it was we mixed reacted somewhat violently, and hot liquid shot out of the top of the test tube. The resulting stain on the lab ceiling was still visible when I visited the school ten years later.\n\nMr Soulsby, the chemistry teacher, dragged us out to the front of the class, bent us over a bench and walloped us with a broom shank. I’m sure this had the desired deterrent effect, but actually hurt far less than the cane. Of course we deserved it – we could easily have injured ourselves and others.\n\nMr Soulsby, who’d joined the school at the same time we did, was one of my favourite teachers. He always tried to answer questions no matter how naive or how deep they might be, and he was an excellent teacher. He was, however, somewhat accident-prone, and on two occasions in our second year our lessons didn’t quite go as planned!\n\nThe first accident occurred when Mr Soulsby was showing us how to make hydrogen using a Kipp’s Apparatus – a glass assembly consisting of three sections stacked one on top of the other. Mr Soulsby started off the reaction, waited a few minutes and then tried to light the gas coming out of the side tube. It should have produced a harmless, flickering blue/purple flame at the end of the tube, but unfortunately he hadn’t waited long enough for the air to be completely expelled, and the gas/air mixture inside the apparatus blew up.\n\nIt really was spectacular as the top two sections of the apparatus shot into the air trailing a jet of flame and looking for all the world like a V2 rocket. And like many of the early V2s, it didn’t get very high before nose-diving to the ground – or rather the other end of the demonstration bench. We all got a shock, to put it mildly, but nobody was hurt at all. It could have been a lot worse.\n\nHaving failed miserably to wipe us out with a missile, he switched to chemical warfare. I thought I remembered this incident well, but Vera Grant née Newton, another of our little group, reminded me of some details I’d forgotten. Mr Soulsby was demonstrating the production of carbon monoxide when the apparatus he was using exploded violently. There was glass everywhere, and several pupils, particularly the girls who were all seated closest to the demonstration bench, were sprayed with sulphuric acid. Our first concern, however, was the gas, which Mr Soulsby had just told us was very poisonous. Fearing for our lives, we all dashed for the door – and first out was “Greg” (Ian Gregory) who moved faster that day than he ever had in games or PE.\n\nNobody was badly hurt; just a few with small cuts to dress, one or two with acid burns to bathe, and a few with acid-stained clothing to replace. Again, it could have been a lot worse. There’s a rather indignant entry in my diary for that day, Friday 8 May 1959: “Explosion in chemistry laboratory. Nobody badly hurt but girls do no lessons in afternoon.” The reason for my annoyance: we boys had normal lessons for the rest of the day!\n\nMr Soulsby took us for chemistry for three years, but coming into the fourth year in September 1960, I was disappointed to find that we were to have Mr Robson for chemistry that year. Mr Robson, who’d joined the school in July 1960, was a good teacher, and I continued to do well in the subject, but I did regret not being taught by Mr Soulsby. Consequently I was very disappointed (and rather surprised) when we learnt that Mr Soulsby was leaving the school in December to study Divinity at Cambridge. A big loss for the school – a big loss for the teaching profession.\n\nAnd that was the last I heard of Mr Soulsby until 1980 when I was helping to track down former Hookergate teachers and pupils to invite them to a planned reunion in 1981. I found that Mr Soulsby – or rather Rev Soulsby – was a vicar at Sutton near St Helens, Lancs. I spoke briefly with him on the telephone and invited him to the reunion. He said he wouldn’t be coming, and I got the distinct impression that he hadn’t welcomed being reminded of his time at Hookergate. I’ve often wondered why that was the case but all I could come up with was that maybe the scandal in 1959 involving his married departmental head and a young PE teacher had something to do with it. It may well have been particularly shocking to a religious man like Mr Soulsby.\n\nJust out of interest I set myself a challenge to find as much as I could about Mr Soulsby in an afternoon. It proved very easy thanks to online genealogical material and a 2002/3 edition of Crockford’s Clerical Directory at our local library. This is the result of my research.\n\nMr Soulsby was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1936; the eldest of two sons of John Howden Wharrier Soulsby and Katherine Mabel Soulsby née Scott. He studied at Durham University and was awarded a BSc degree in 1957. Later that same year he joined the staff of Hookergate Grammar School as a chemistry teacher.\n\nAt the end of 1960, after 3 years at Hookergate, Mr Soulsby left to study Divinity at Westcott House, an Anglican theological college associated with the University of Cambridge. He began his studies in 1961, became an Ordained Deacon in 1962 and an Ordained Priest in 1963.\n\nRev Soulsby’s first clerical position was as a Curate at Selly Oak near Birmingham, and then, from 1966, he was a Curate at nearby Kings Norton. Also in 1966 Rev Soulsby married Miss Janet M Beach. They had their first child, Rachel Emma, in 1972 and their second, Iain Michael, in 1975. Meanwhile, in 1973 and still at Kings Norton, Rev Soulsby had been promoted to Team Vicar.\n\nIn 1976 the Soulsbys moved north to Sutton near St Helens in Lancashire where Rev Soulsby had been appointed as Team Rector. This appointment was to last twelve years, and during his last four years at Sutton Rev Soulsby also served as Rural Dean which meant he had oversight responsibilities for all the parishes in the Prescot Deanery.\n\nFrom 1988 Rev Soulsby was the Priest in Charge at Orton Longueville Parish near Peterborough. Four years later, in 1992, he took on the additional responsibilities of Rural Dean for the Deanery of Yaxley. Two years later Rev Soulsby became an Honorary Canon at Ely Cathedral. He was now Canon Soulsby. Yet more change took place in 1996 when his parish became part of a Team Ministry with Canon Soulsby as Team Rector.\n\nCanon Soulsby retired in 2004 and now lives at Eye near Peterborough. Like many retired clerics, he still helps out when vicars in the area are ill or otherwise indisposed. I wish him well and hope he and his wife have many more happy years together.\n\nFinally, I’m pleased to see that Canon Soulsby hasn’t completely abandoned science: he’s a member of the Society of Ordained Scientists, indeed he was secretary for a while.\n\nSo that was 2014. Not a bad year for us, but not a particularly good one either. Weather-wise here in Gateshead the year was characterised by unusually high temperatures from spring right through until October, and worryingly high winds on several occasions. Of course we won’t complain about the higher temperatures, but we could certainly have done without the winds.\n\nOn the human health front, we can’t really complain. Chris had a really persistent chest cold, which happily seems to have cleared up now, and I had a waterworks infection which virtually grounded me for nearly a month, but compared to many others we’ve been lucky. Chris was also referred to the Queen Elizabeth and Freeman hospitals for a few tests, but there proved to be nothing to worry about. We both had our seasonal flu jabs as soon as they were available, and Chris took the opportunity only offered to 70 year-olds to have a shingles vaccination. I ended up in the Queen Elizabeth A & E on November 7th with a cat bite – yes, it was Samantha who didn’t like taking her medication that night and showed her displeasure by sinking one of her canines deep into my little finger. Ouch!\n\nSpeaking of Samantha, she hasn’t been so lucky with her health: in fact her age (20 in September) is finally catching up with her. Back in February she was found to have an over-active thyroid, which was easily treated. But in June the vet found that her kidneys are failing, and this will be ultimately be fatal. To counter dehydration and possibly give the cat a few more months of quality life, the vet has been giving Sam sub-cutaneous fluids three times a week, plus periodic vitamins and steroids, and this seems to be helping. This was augmented on three occasions with overnight stays at an animal hospital at Heaton for more intensive rehydration with an IV drip . Unfortunately the vet who has been looking after Samantha, Paola Fognani, left the practice on December 18th. We’ll certainly miss Paola – without her competence, dedication and kindness I don’t think Samantha would still be with us. Happily the vet who has replaced Paola, Shona Hingston, has agreed to continue with the same treatment. It is however, just a matter of time, and whatever we do there will soon be a heart-wrenching decision to make.\n\nMy hearing has been giving me cause for concern for several years, but when I asked a few years ago if I could have a hearing test, my then GP wasn’t prepared to refer me. I asked again this year and my current GP agreed. I had ENT checks and hearing tests at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on September 9th and was diagnosed with “moderate age-related hearing loss”. Two weeks later I was fitted with two behind-the-ear digital hearing aids and I’ve worn them during every waking hour since then. What a fantastic difference they make!\n\nOur dentist has changed again. We were just getting used to John Rivers, our dentist since 2011, but 4 months before our most recent check-ups in October, we were told that Mr Rivers had left and we were now assigned to a new dentist in the practice, Samira Rais. We were rather apprehensive before we saw her for the first time, but we needn’t have worried as she seems to know her business and seems very pleasant too. Even more recently we received a letter informing us that the dental practice we use, Robson and Partners of Lobley Hill, had been sold to Oasis Dental Care. We’ll have to wait and see if this affects us in any way.\n\nChristine’s uncle “Telf”, John Telford Hutton, who died aged 90 in December 2013, was cremated at Saltwell Crematorium on February 13th, and on April 25th we attended the burial of a friend, Sandra Cockburn at Saltwell Cemetery. Sandy, who was only 70, was a former neighbour of Christine’s and we often met her while shopping in Low Fell. She was always so friendly and full of life; it’s hard to believe she’s gone.\n\nNot a great deal has changed in the neighbourhood, apart from the effects of council cut-backs resulting from the government’s so-called “austerity measures”. Volunteers have taken over the running of Low Fell Library and the planting and maintenance of the many street floral displays, but street cleaning is dreadful and many other services have suffered. More cuts are on the cards, so goodness knows what will be affected next.\n\nOne thing the council did do during the year was to replace all the “sodium” lights in the Borough’s side streets with modern LED units designed to minimise light pollution and greatly reduce the lighting bills. This worked well in our back lane which has very tall poles, but in our front street they put the LED lamps on the existing short poles. These poles were ideal for the sideways-facing sodium lights we previously had, but they are no good at all for the strictly downward-pointing LED lamps. The result in the front street was four small pools of light directly below each LED lamp and darkness everywhere else. I complained through one of our councillors and the council Lighting Dept duly attended with their light meters and surveyed the street. Predictably they said everything was OK – except directly outside our house. Soon afterwards some engineers turned up and added a one-meter extension to the pole nearest to us and they stuck the LED lamp on top of that. So now the lighting in our part of the street is quite good – while in the rest of the street it remains patchy.\n\nThere have been changes in two local businesses we use a lot. Low Fell Post Office has had a major upgrade – gone is the old all-enclosed arrangement and now we have a much more customer-friendly, mostly open-plan Post Office. The other business, a Nisa store run by Steve Barratt on Kells Lane, is expanding into two shop units adjacent to his existing premises. The new section is complete and is now in use while the old store is upgraded to match the new decor. The entire store should be complete some time in February 2015. Another notable addition to the neighbourhood is a new mosque on Prince Consort Road. This lovely stone building started life as Prince Consort Road Primitive Methodist Church, but had been in use for many years as a Christadelphian Meeting Hall.\n\nI’ve been getting rather annoyed at the problems I’ve had when I’ve needed proof of identity. I didn’t have a photo-card driving licence or passport, which are always the preferred documents, and it’s always a hassle to determine what else is acceptable. So this year I decided to upgrade my paper driving licence (which I’ve held since 1976 though I haven’t driven since 1983) to a photo-card one. It was surprisingly easy, and now that I have proper ID I am cursing myself for not having done this years ago and thus saved myself all the ID problems I’ve suffered. I also added my name to the Organ Donor Register – something else I should have done years ago. I don’t know if any of my organs will be any good for others by the time I kick the bucket, but if they are then I’d be delighted if they were used.\n\nI’m not a cook by any stretch of the imagination, but in June I happened to catch sight of a recipe which appealed to me as it contained corned beef, spaghetti, tomatoes and grated cheese, all of which I love. So I tried it (with a slight variation) after Chris had gone to bed – so if it failed miserably I could tip it into the bin, wash the crockery and cutlery and generally hide the fact that it had ever existed. But surprisingly it was delicious, so I now make it regularly. Chris likes it too, but only has a minute quantity because she reckons it’s “fattening”. All the more for me! The original recipe was called “Corned Beef Italienne” so I’ve christened my variation “Corned Beef Gatesheed.”\n\nIn October I finally retired my archaic Samsung Galaxy Europa smart phone in favour of a much more modern “Motorola E”. The Moto E is very cheap as smart phones go, but it runs the latest version of Android and does everything I need. Another technical upgrade I’ve made this year is to replace the vast majority of light bulbs in the house with equivalent LED bulbs. These are far more efficient than incandescent or halogen bulbs and are even better than compact fluorescents in that they have a much longer life, provide instant light, don’t contain mercury, and some versions can even be dimmed. The problem hitherto has been availability and cost, but now Tesco are selling LED bulbs, which are direct replacements for a wide variety of types, at very reasonable prices. I also changed my broadband provider from Metronet to Plusnet in August and I’m very pleased with the service. I’m now paying less for an unlimited service than I was for a capped one, and the speed is excellent too.\n\nFamily news:- my second cousin’s daughter, Alexandria Ord, married David John Newby in September, and on December 25th Alexandria’s younger sister Ginna excitedly announced her engagement to Jordan Babak. Congratulations to them all.\n\nNext year I should have rather more family news as we are planning a “Walker” family get-together towards the end of September. Cousin Ian will be over from Canada and we hope to gather together as many of Joe and Lizzie Walker’s far-flung descendants as we possibly can. The last reunion was back in 2007, so there’ll be plenty to talk about.\n\nOn the research scene I’ve been rather busy tying up loose ends in many branches of the family, but my main project this year has been an attempt to identify the William Wearmouth who was my “reputed” great-great-great grandfather. His daughter, Mary Ann Henderson, my great-great grandmother, was illegitimate and no father was named on her 1835 baptism record, but when she married in 1853 and was asked for details of her father, she stated that her “reputed father” was a “William Wearmouth labourer” and this information appears on her marriage certificate. Family tradition added a snippet of information – William Wearmouth supposedly married a farmer’s daughter. The problem is that there were six young men called William Wearmouth living not too far away who were of an appropriate age to be the “guilty” party. I’m nearly finished the project but I don’t think I’ll be able to make a positive identification using documentary material, but I should be able to narrow down the possibilities considerably. Then, if I’m very lucky and these remaining candidates have living legitimate descendants, I might be able to identify the correct person using autosomal DNA.\n\nDNA can resolve all sorts of identification issues – I suggested it to a friend who who a very similar problem to mine and it worked beautifully. She now knows for certain which of the three possible candidates was in fact her great great grandfather. The only major research I undertook for anyone else this year was to trace the blood-ancestors of David Noble, a “second-cousin” by adoption. He had some very interesting ancestors including one of Tyneside’s most prolific postcard publishers, Thomas Howson Dickinson.\n\nChris and I have continued to eat out on Monday afternoons at the Ravensworth Arms, Lamesley – a treat after shopping at Tesco in the morning. We also made sure we attended all the special events at the Ravensworth during the year – Burns Night, Jazz Night, Valentines Night, Fathers’ Day and Elizabethan Night. The Ravensworth didn’t disappoint; the food and entertainment were excellent. We were sad to learn in May that long-serving managers Paul and Sharron Currie were leaving – we will miss them – but on the plus side, the new manager, Louise, seems just as friendly and efficient, and from our point of view, most of the changes she’s made are improvements.\n\nI continued meeting with school-friend Bernard at the Ravensworth roughly every month throughout the year, and Chris & I both dined there with friends Marian & Geoff and with distant relatives, Brenda & Billy. Lovely to catch up with the latest news. Our little Gang of genealogy-inclined friends – Pat, Val, Fee, John plus Chris & I – also met there from time to time during the year, as did our group of year-mates from Hookergate Grammar School – Maggie, Pat, Pam & Dave plus Chris and I – generally known as the Famous Five. In past years the Famous Five meals were in a several places and were coupled with outings to historic places, but for a variety of reasons that didn’t happen this year and most meals were at the Ravensworth Arms. The exception was a meal at the Lion and Lamb, Horsley followed by a visit to Maggie’s home at Humshaugh – an historic visit if ever there was one as Maggie’s house dates from before the Civil War and has arrow-slits in its walls.\n\nWe also dined on three occasions with fellow members of the Retired Members Association of my former union, the NASUWT. They dine every month in locations throughout Northumberland, Tyne & Wear and Co Durham. We try to join them whenever their dining spot is within easy travelling distance of our home. This year we met with them at the Washington Arms, the Shepherd & Shepherdess at Beamish, and at the County Ground of Durham County Cricket Club at Chester-le-street.\n\nWhen we wanted exercise we generally walked around Lamesley Meadows, a beautiful expanse of rural tranquillity situated surprisingly close to the urban sprawl of Gateshead and Low Fell, and even closer to the huge Team Valley Trading Estate. It’s magical watching the changes to the flora and fauna there through the seasons. We’ve rather neglected another of our favourite spots, Saltwell Park, this year, but we really enjoyed the few visits we did make. That was also where I met with my friend, Alan Dixon, a Geordie living in distant parts who was visiting his family in Gateshead. Alan is a talented artist and musician as well as a lovely man.\n\nWe enjoyed another wonderful selection of plays at Gateshead’s Little Theatre this year: “Kiss of Death”, “The Fifteen Streets”, “Haunting Julia”, “Amadeus”, “Enchanted April”, “An Ideal Husband”, “Quartet”, “Cat’s Cradle” and “Tartuffe”. Theatre is one area where so-called amateur efforts are often superior to multi-million pound commercial endeavours and this is certainly true of virtually all of the Little Theatre productions. It’s hard to pick a favourite from this year’s offerings as every one was so well produced and entertaining, but Oscar Wilde’s “An Ideal Husband” and Moliere’s “Tartuffe” had us in stitches from start to finish, and Leslie Sands’ “Cat’s Cradle” kept us guessing until the end.\n\nI wish the same were true of the much vaunted Agatha Christie play “The Mousetrap” which we went to see at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle in September, but we’d guessed the guilty party within 20 minutes. It was well produced, well staged and well performed, but, in our opinion, far from Christie’s best. The biggest mystery to us is how it managed to run on stage longer than any other show in history. Our next trip to the Theatre Royal was much more rewarding – it was to see the annual pantomime. This year it was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and as usual the multi-talented Danny Williams, Clive Webb and “Dame” Chris Hayward ensured a two-hour feast of entertainment for children aged 1 to 100. A fabulous show.\n\nMore entertainment was provided in May at Gateshead Heritage Centre by Northumbrian Piper/Fiddle Player, Matt Seattle, and Vocalist/ Accordionist/Piper, Johnny Handle – a great evening of folk music which we thoroughly enjoyed. The Caedmon Hall at Gateshead hosted the New Century Ragtime Orchestra in July in what has become a much anticipated annual event and it was indeed a delight. As well as the multi-talented members of the orchestra and fine vocalist Caroline Irwin, the concert featured virtuoso pianists Stephanie Trick and Paolo Alderighi . We’ve already booked for the 2015 concert just to be sure we don’t miss out on what is always a great night.\n\nMost of our forays to the Heritage Centre and the Caedmon Hall have been for educational rather than purely entertainment purposes, for both venues have provided some really interesting talks during the year. The Caedmon was the venue for three shows by The History Wardrobe on the history of hats, underwear, and fashion during Word War I. These were most enjoyable and informative presentations by costume historians Lucy Adlington and Merry Towne. Even more fascinating was a talk in March by forensic expert and ex-police inspector, Norman Kirtlan, entitled “Jack the Ripper – the Local Suspect”. According to Mr Kirtlan, the Ripper was a Whitechapel milkman (and time-served butcher) called William Benjamin Belcher who fled to Hartlepool with his family in 1888 changing the family surname to Williams. Far fetched though it sounds, Mr Kirtlan made a very strong case for this scenario – though, of course, there are hundreds of other theories and many of them seem equally convincing. They can’t all be true.\n\nWe attended all but one of the “Library Lates” this year most of which were on the theme of literary genres; “Murder, Mystery and Agatha Christie”, “Malory Towers, Midnight Feasts and Mysterious Events”, “Ian Fleming and Bond”, “Out of This World” (Sci-Fi) and “The World of Stephen King”. Two others on the subjects of “Commonwealth” and “Celebration” completed a great year. Thanks to the library staff who devised these entertaining events and worked late to cover them. In 2015 some of the “Library Lates” will be in the afternoons rather than the evenings in an effort to boost attendances. I’m not sure it will have the same atmosphere as in the evening but I shouldn’t prejudge. We’re booked for one of these “Library Lates After Lunch” in April and we’ll see how it goes.\n\nGateshead Heritage Centre did us proud as usual with a marvellous selection of talks during the year: “Necessary History” (Richard Pears) on the history of toilets, a Tudor fashion show (Julia Renaissance Costumes), “Brave Hearts” (Freda Thompson) on pioneering women, “30s, 40s and 50s Part II” (Andrew Clark) continuing last year’s talk on local culture during those decades, “Monkey Business at a Medieval Abbey” (Barry Mead) about the naughty shenanigans among medieval monks, “Making the Colours Sing” (Roger Fern) about local stained glass manufacturers, “We are not Amused” (Malcolm Grady) about Victorian humour, “Earl Grey and his Monument” (Peter Regan) , “Trowels to the Rescue” (Jules Brown) about conserving historic buildings, and “Martial Traditions in the North East” ( Dan Jackson) about volunteering for military service in the region.\n\nThe Medicine for Members talks at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital this year were on the subjects of: “Thyroid Disease”, “Lung Disease and Tobacco”, “Blood Pressure”, “Audiology”, and “Care in the Last Few Days of Life”. These were most enlightening and in many ways reassuring too. And on the subject of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, there are huge changes afoot in the hospital’s Accident and Emergency department – there’s a completely new state-of-the-art A& E building designed to ensure that everyone receives the treatment they need as speedily as possible. As the year ends the new building is almost ready to open – it will soon be phased into use. It looks magnificent. We attended a presentation back in June showcasing these new facilities, and we really must congratulate those involved in the design and planning. Another change is not so welcome: the hospital restaurant, Quenellies, is no longer open 24/7; it now closes between 6.30 pm and 7.30 am. It isn’t even open during evening visiting periods. So now the only overnight refreshment facilities are provided by vending machines – far from satisfactory, particularly for relatives visiting seriously ill patients for long periods.\n\nNewcastle Skeptics in the Pub (SitP) went from strength to strength this year despite a change of management in the summer. Two of our excellent committee, Richard Tomsett and Emma Kirkpatrick, gained their doctorates – congratulations – and moved on to pastures new, and the third member, Danny Strickland, decided to take a back seat. In their place we have Sam Hogarth and Weal Mac, and judging by their work so far, the organisation will be safe in their hands.\n\nThe SitP talks I heard this year were: “Why haven’t we cured cancer yet?” (Dr Vicky Forster), “Agents of Reason” (John Issitt) about radicals in England at the time of the French Revolution, “The Skeptical Bobby” (Stevyn Colgan), “Falling Standards – Where’s The Evidence?” (Mike Warren), “Population Matters” (Sandy Irvine), “Myths around poverty and worklessness” (Stephen Crossley), “Lifting the Lid” (Michael Marshall) about countering pseudoscience, “Open Mike Night”, “Bitcoin: Currency of the Future” (David Cook & Gary Broadfield), “Jesus: Memory or Myth” (Ken Humphries). All were excellent and many challenged deep seated views I’d held for decades.\n\nMy favourite by far was the last of these in which Ken Humphries argued convincingly that Jesus was a mythical rather than an historical figure. Booking this talk caused some controversy when two people posted on the event’s Facebook page to tell us that we shouldn’t even listen to this chap because he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, but will nonetheless convince many. A strange argument against a talk for skeptics who are, by inclination, very difficult to deceive. The same gentlemen attended the talk and tried to challenge Ken’s arguments in the Q and A session which followed, but it was obvious that Ken knew his subject far better than these Christian apologists and he was able to counter every one of their challenges with consummate ease.\n\nAlthough I’ve been a member of the North East Humanists for years I rarely get to their monthly meetings at the Literary and Philosophical Society Library in Newcastle because of conflicting commitments. However I did manage to get to their October talk on the “The Science Behind GM Crops” by Dr Geraint Parry of the University of Liverpool. Fascinating to hear the truth about this vital and promising technology which is so unjustly demonised and feared by many, particularly in Europe.\n\nWe’ve had our usual assortment of workmen in the house during the year, mostly doing jobs I should have done myself but lacked the energy or inclination. First we had a local joiner, Ian Atkinson, remove a snow board from our roof. This was put up to protect a greenhouse which had stood at the back of the house many years ago. The very high winds in February caused the bolts which secured the snow-board to work loose, allowing the board to move and threaten to damage several roof tiles. Ian did a good job removing the board and the securing brackets and bolts without causing any further harm. In March we spotted an intermittent leak from the roof and called in Chris Moody, a roofer from Gosforth, to replace some flashing between our roof and a neighbour’s wall. He too did an excellent job.\n\nIn May we called in plumber, Russ Anderson, to tackle a slow-draining shower tray, and he managed to resolve the problem using a rather powerful chemical to dissolve whatever was obstructing the flow. It needed two doses, but it obviously did the job well as the drain is still working well seven months later. In June we had gardener George Jukes tidying up the front garden and in September we got Lodge Tree Services to trim and shape our tree and bushes. In July we had Peter and Paul of Able Decorators here for a day or two to repair and paint a ceiling. In previous years we’ve had to call out heating engineer Bob Thornton several times to keep our old Vokera boiler functioning. In 2014 we only needed him once – in August. Finally, at the end of October, our fridge began to go haywire – sometimes dropping below freezing point, sometimes rising to 10C. Our initial reaction was to replace the fridge, but instead we called appliance repairer Marshall Grainger of South Shields to see if he could supply and fit a new thermostat. Luckily he was able to do so and we have a working fridge again. A really good year as far as workmen are concerned with every one doing a good job.\n\nI’ll end with a couple of pictures I took in the run-up to Christmas. First, a group of youngsters having a great time singing carols in Eldon Square shopping centre, and secondly a rather attractive window display I spotted in a house near to the vets in Lowrey’s Lane, Low Fell.\n\nPostscript. Sadly our lovely cat Samantha was euthanised on January 5th 2015. She went completely blind the day before, and on top of her many existing problems, we decided it was just too much. Twenty years of joy – we will miss her terribly.\n\nTwo serendipitous emails have provided the latest clues in my long-running investigation into the origins of one of my great-great grandparents.\n\nTwo years ago (can it really be that long?) I blogged about my great-great grandfather, Charles Stephen Friedman/Freedman/ Freeman (1842-1906). The question was – was he Swedish (and Christian) as he and most of his descendants claimed, or was he a Russian Jew as one of his grand-daughters, Bella Beck née Freeman, insisted. Before mentioning these ‘serendipitous emails’, I’ll first rehearse the arguments in the 2012 blog post and briefly mention my subsequent efforts to find more about the pendant .\n\nWas he Russian?\n\nIn favour of him possibly being Russian rather than Swedish, I had his violin which was manufactured in St Petersburg in 1850, and I had my autosomal DNA tests which showed that I closely matched the DNA of several Russians. Nothing conclusive there – the violin could have been exported to Sweden and bought there, and the autosomal DNA which matches several Russians could, in theory, have come down to me through any of my ancestral lines. Though, having said that, all of my other lines are British for at least 6 generations, and the Russian DNA matches are close enough to indicate a connection well within those 6 generations. The Russian connection has to be through Charles’ line as he was the only possible ‘foreign‘ ancestor in the last 6 generation. I had written to all my DNA matches in the hope that we might be able to establish paper trails to connect us genealogically. This had proved hugely successful in a handful of cases but, sadly, not with any of my Russian matches. None of them even replied to my e-mails – hardly surprising I suppose as I wrote to them in English.\n\nSo, in early 2012, I had two pieces of evidence – the violin and the DNA – supporting the notion of Charles being Russian, but they were far from conclusive.\n\nWas he Jewish?\n\nIn favour of Charles being Jewish I had his surname which morphed from Friedman in 1861, to Freedman in 1872, to Freeman in 1873, and I had his Star of David/Hamsa pendant, a Jewish good-luck charm. Against that we had the fact that Charles married in Sunderland Parish Church in 1872 and baptised his children – though I understand that many Jews arriving in the country in the mid 1800s did become Christian. There was even a well established society in the country dedicated to converting Jewish immigrants.\n\nSo, in early 2012, I had two pieces of evidence – the surname and the pendant/good luck charm – supporting the notion of Charles being Jewish, but again, they were far from conclusive.\n\nSummary and Further Work\n\nAt best, all I could say back then was that Charles might have been a Russian Jew – but could equally well have been a Swede from Gothenburg as he claimed. I wondered – and this was just wild speculation – if both could be true – viz Charles’ father and/or mother were Russian Jews (explaining the violin, the Jewish pendant and the DNA matches) and they’d moved to Gothenburg, Sweden where Charles grew up. That would be consistent with all the known evidence.\n\nFollowing the blog post I was contacted by two people with identical pendants to mine (in one case a picture verified that it was indeed identical), and by a third person who claimed that “a friend had one just the same“, but none of these people knew anything of the origins of their pendants, they were just family memorabilia. I found a fourth identical pendant mentioned and illustrated online – identical apart from being plated, giving it a silver colouration. Frustratingly, this pendant had been purchased at a car boot sale, so yet again there was no information on its origins. I sent descriptions and detailed photographs of my pendant to the British Museum and to Manchester Jewish Museum in the hope that their experts could offer some information on the pendant – but nobody in those venerable institutions had seen anything like it. The pendant remained a mystery.\n\nOn the possibility of Charles being a Russian Jew – further enquiries verified that it was not uncommon for 19th Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe to baptise and raise their children as Anglicans in the UK, with those children having little if any idea of their parents’ early religious life. Nor was it unknown for Jewish families from Russia to move to Sweden, and sometimes to subsequently move on elsewhere. One family history researcher wrote “I have cousins that were born near Bialystok, in what was Russia at the time (1870s). When they married, they had their first few children in Russia, then moved to Helsingborg, Sweden, where they had more. They lived in Sweden for five years, and then immigrated (sic) to the US to be near a brother.”\n\nSo that was what I knew in the summer of 2012. Charles could have been Russian and he could have been Jewish – on the available evidence it certainly looked possible, but, before I could really take the idea seriously, like Oliver Twist, I wanted more!\n\nSerendipitous Email #1\n\nA few months later I received an e-mail from Emmelie, the daughter of, and contact-person for, Helga Sch—mann, one of my autosomal DNA matches. Because of her obviously Germanic names, I initially assumed that Helga was German, and Emmelie’s freenet.de email address seemed to confirm this. As I read the email, however, it became clear that this assumption was quite wrong, Emmelie’s mother was Russian and Jewish. Her story goes back to late 1941, the darkest days of World War II in Odessa, Ukraine (historically part of Russia) when German and Romanian forces were rounding up and murdering Jews – tens of thousands of them – in what was to become known as the Odessa Holocaust. One family, knowing what was about to happen to them, hid their daughter and she was later spotted wandering alone and handed over to an orphanage. The child was found to be carrying a note bearing her name and date and place of birth – Galina Praher born 4th of April 1938 in Lipovenki (near Odessa). After some time in institutions, Galina was fostered, somewhat ironically, by a German couple, and she grew up with them in Bavaria under her new name, Helga.\n\nSo DNA connects me unmistakeably to that little girl, the daughter of Russian Jews. I have Russian Jewish relations – and, as discussed earlier, any such connection has to be through my great great grandfather, Charles.\n\nA little footnote to this tale. When I was in contact with Emmelie in 2012, they knew nothing of Helga’s ancestors except for the family name Praher and the fact that her parents were Jewish and had died in 1941 at the hands of those Nazi monsters. Today I had another look at Helga’s profile on the DNA testing company’s website, and I see that Helga or Emmelie must have been doing some research into the Praher family as the profile now lists some ancestral surnames besides Praher. One of those additional ancestral surnames is Friehahn !! Can I – dare I – see a similarity between that and Friedman? An intriguing idea!\n\nSerendipitous Email #2\n\nTwo days ago I received an email notifying me of a new comment by a Jay Williams relating to my Charles Stephen Freeman, Swede or Russian Jew? post. The notification email contained the text of the message, so I didn’t have to look online to read it. It was about the Star of David/Hamsa pendant and was very exciting – in fact, I nearly fell off my chair as I read “My nan who was Russian gave me a pendant identical to yours in 1986 …” . I felt like rushing outside and shouting “Jay’s nan – WHO WAS RUSSIAN – had an identical Jewish good luck charm.” Jay knew no more than that, but wow! Now I can link an identical pendant with a Russian Jew. Perhaps it isn’t too much of a leap to suppose that my pendant had once been owned by another Russian Jew – Charles, or his dad, Erich.\n\nConclusion\n\nBella Beck’s lone voice telling me me that her grandfather was a Russian Jew, not Swedish as everyone else claimed, really is looking more and more likely to be the truth."
