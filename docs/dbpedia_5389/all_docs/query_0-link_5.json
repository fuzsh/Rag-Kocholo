Lang (1846-1897). The Silver Crash of 1893 ended the building craze and ruined Lang’s successful architectural practice and ended his partnership with Marshall Pugh, who left Denver to work elsewhere. By 1895 Lang was in severe financial difficulty and in poor health and may have been suffering from emotional problems and/or alcoholism. He is listed in the city directory as a “waiter”. In December of 1896, he left his wife and daughter in Denver and made an extended visit to his brother who lived in a Chicago suburb. In August of 1897, Lang disappeared from his brother’s home. He was arrested in Morris, Illinois, for drunk and disorderly conduct and ordered out of town. On August 21st he was hit by a passing train while walking down the railroad tracks and was killed instantly. His brother and his wife were informed of the death but neither had the money to pay for, or attend, his funeral. He was buried in Marsailles, Illinois, in a lot donated by the Grand Army of the Republic with a simple stone marker\n\nAbove Interior view of Town and Gown Links clubhouse in Colorado Springs (El Paso County) Colorado; shows men at a dinner table set with crystal and silver.

(American papers, please copy.)\n\nIn The Times on July 10th 1933 Edith Smith had a letter to The Editor published, it said\n\nTHE ABBEY IN THE SIXTIES\n\nMay I add one more to the interesting reminiscences of visits to Westminster Abbey long ago? In 1862 and following years I had the privalege of staying with my godfather, Canon Conway, in Dean's Yard, and, in addition to visits to the wax effigies, I had the joy of moonlight visits to the interior of the Abbey and a sight of the quaint, mechanical contrivances then at work in the walls for checking the vigilance of the night watchmen, who had to drop a ticket into the passing miniature trunk at the right moment. (I wonder what has become of the contrivance.) I also remember the breathless visits of Dean Stanley, often at tea-time, to tell us of some new discovery he had made owing to his small stature being able to penetrate where none other could. There was a pathos in the unexpected passing of our old friend the saintly Canon Conway, in that the ink was scarcely dry of the memorial sermon he had written and was to preach the next day of Lady Augusta Stanley. - Mrs. LEWIS SMITH, Peny-bont, Guildford.\n\nEdith's godfather was Reverend William Conway. His son was William Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington (April 12 1856 – April 19 1937), English art critic, politician and mountaineer. He was founder and first Director-General of the Imperial War Museum.\n\nAbove Dean Stanley, friend of Edith Smith. He was educated at Rugby School under Thomas Arnold, and in 1834 went up to Balliol College, Oxford. He is generally considered to be the source for the character of George Arthur in Thomas Hughes's well-known book Tom Brown's Schooldays.\n\nEdith Smith died on July 26th 1939. Her obituary appeared in The Times on July 28th 1939 and said\n\nSMITH.-On July 26, 1939, at Stoke Grange, Guildford, EDITH SMITH, wife of the Rev. Lewis Arthur Smith, daughter of the late Rev. J. H.

Lewis Arthur Smith, of Stoke Grange, Guildford, died on August 23 at the age of 95. He was educated at Queen's College, Oxford, and was ordained in 1874.\n\nThe Rev.
