        "text": "Ali Fazal is a renowned Indian model and actor born in New Delhi and brought up in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Since his parents were separated, he spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandparents.\n\nFazal studied for a few years at International Indian School, Dammam, and then at La Martiniere College in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. He then completed his studies at The Doon School in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, where he explored acting. He was an active basketball player during this time. After he fractured his leg, he started participating in school plays. He participated in a school play based on William Shakespeare's The Tempest, where he got the role of Trinculo, the jester. After Doon, Fazal moved to Mumbai and graduated in Economics from St. Xavier's College.\n\nFazal made his screen debut in the English language film Bei Anruf Liebe (2007) in 2007. And he debuted in the Hindi film industry with a small role as Joy Lobo in 3 Idiots (2009). He appeared next in Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), Roshan Abbas-directed romantic film produced by Shah Rukh Khan production house, Red Chillies Entertainment.\n\nIn Fukrey (2013), a contemporary comedy film, Fazal's appeared as Zafar, a struggling musician. In 2014, Fazal, as Tasawur, appeared opposite Vidya Balan in the comedy-drama Bobby Jasoos (2014). He got the lead role in the movie Khamoshiyan (2015). He also appeared in his first American film, Fast & Furious 7 (2015). He then played the lead role opposite Diana Penty in Happy Bhag Jayegi (2016).\n\nIn 2017, Fazal appeared in the sequel Fukrey Returns (2017). He did another remarkable film in 2017, Victoria & Abdul (2017), in which he played the role of Abdul Karim, an Indian servant in the British-American film. This movie premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, he appeared in the sequel Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi (2018) and played Guddu Pandit in the web series Mirzapur (2018). Fazal became famous as Guddu Pandit because of his much-appreciated performance in the crime thriller released on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIn 2020 he appeared in Mirzapur season 2, where he continued as Guddu Pandit. In 2021 he turned producer and established Pushing Buttons Studios, his film production company, along with Richa Chadha.\n\nHe was also cast as Andrew Katchadourian in the film Tod auf dem Nil (2022), inspired by Agatha Christie's novel. The same year, he married renowned actress Richa Chadha in Lucknow.\n\nFazal made it to The Times of India's \"Most Desirable Man\" listing in 2014. He also walked the ramp at Lakme Fashion Week in 2015. He won an award in 2017 at the Hamptons International Film Festival in the Variety 10 Actors to Watch category. In 2018, he won the Most Beautiful Couple of the Year at Vogue Beauty Awards with his wife, Richa Chadha.\n\nTall (6' 4\"), agile, energetic, and ever-so-confident as both actor and singer, especially on the award-winning Broadway stage, Barry Bostwick possesses that certain narcissistic poise, charm and Ã©lan that reminds one instantly (and humorously) of a Kevin Kline -- both were quite brilliant in their respective interpretations of The Pirate King in \"The Pirates of Penzance\". Yet, for all his diverse talents (he is a Golden Globe winner and was nominated for the Tony Award three times, winning once), Barry is indelibly caught in a time warp. Even today, 35 years after the fact, he is indelibly associated with the role of nerdy hero Brad Majors in the midnight movie phenomena Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). While it is extremely flattering to be a part of such a cult institution, Barry's acting legacy deserves much more than this.\n\nHe was born Barry Knapp Bostwick on February 24, 1945, in San Mateo, California, one of two sons of Elizabeth \"Betty\" (Defendorf) and Bud Bostwick (Henry Bostwick), a city planner and actor. A student at San Mateo High School, he and his elder brother Peter use to put on musicals and puppet shows for the neighborhood kids. Barry attended San Diego's United States International University's School for the Performing Arts in 1967, and switched from music to drama during the course of his studies. He also worked occasionally as a circus performer, which would come in handy on the musical stage down the line. He subsequently moved to New York and attended the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University.\n\nMaking his stage debut at age 22 in a production of \"Take Her, She's Mine,\" Barry performed in a number of non-musical roles in such productions of \"War and Peace\" (1968) and \"The Misanthrope (1968). Making his 1969 Broadway debut in \"Cock-a-Doodle Dandy\", which ran in tandem with \"Hamlet\" in which he was featured as Osric, it was his portrayal of the swaggering, leather jacket-wearing 50s \"bad boy\" Danny Zuko in the 1972 Broadway high-school musical smash \"Grease\" that put Barry's name prominently and permanently on the marquee signs. Originating the role, he was nominated for a Tony but lost out that year to the older generation (Phil Silvers for \"A Funny Thing Happened...\").\n\nIn the midst of all this star-making hoopla, Barry was also breaking into films with a minor role in Jennifer on My Mind (1971) and leading parts in the comedy spoofs Road Movie (1973) and The Wrong Damn Film (1975). It all paled after winning the role as Susan Sarandon's simp of a boyfriend in the Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), which featured a delicious Tim Curry camping it up as a transvestite monster-maker. The movie, based on the macabre 1973 British stage musical \"The Rocky Horror Show,\" packed the midnight movie houses with costumed fans replicating every move and, word and offering puns and props aplenty in recapturing the insanity of the show.\n\nWhile the \"Rocky\" association hit like a tornado, Barry ventured on and tried to distance himself. He created sparks again on Broadway, garnering a second Tony nomination for the comedy revival \"They Knew What They Wanted\" in 1976. He finally took home the trophy the following year for the musical \"The Robber Bridegroom\" (1977), which relied again on his patented bluff and bravado as a Robin Hood-like hero. Following top roles in the musicals \"She Loves Me\" and \"The Pirates of Penzance\", Barry turned rewardingly to film and TV.\n\nThe two-part feature Movie Movie (1978), which played like an old-style double feature, was a great success, performing alongside esteemed actor George C. Scott. Barry excelled in both features, but especially the musical parody. He fared just as well on the smaller screen in TV movies, playing everything from historical icons (George Washington) to preening matinÃ©e idols (John Gilbert), and winning a Golden Globe for his role as a military officer in the epic miniseries Feuersturm und Asche (1988). A variety of interesting roles followed in glossy, soap-styled fare, farcical comedies and period drama.\n\nA welcomed return to Broadway musicals in the form of \"Nick & Nora\" (he as sleuth Nick \"The Thin Man\" Charles) was marred when the glitzy production folded after only nine perfs. Instead, the prematurely grey-haired actor found steadier success in sitcoms as a smug comedy foil to Michael J. Fox playing Mayor Randall Winston for six seasons in Chaos City (1996). He later enjoyed a recurring role as a dauntless attorney on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999). Then again, Barry could be spotted pitching items in commercials or hamming it up in family-oriented Disneyesque entertainment in the \"Parent Trap\" and \"101 Dalmatian\" mold.\n\nIn 1997, Bostwick was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 10 days later had his prostate removed. The operation was successful and in 2004, he won the Gilda Radner Courage Award from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Just a year earlier he appeared on an episode of \"Scrubs\" as a patient also having prostate cancer. Barry married somewhat late in life. For a brief time he was wed to actress Stacey Nelkin (1987-1991), but has since become a father of two, Brian and Chelsea, with second wife Sherri Jensen Bostwick, an actress who appeared with Barry in the TV movie TÃ¶dliche Gottesanbeterin (1993).\n\nEngaged on the big and small screen, he has always dedicated his energies to social commitment. The role played in Capitano Ultimo is the one he is most attached to. He supported Sergio De Caprio in the creation of a non-profit foundation and the Casa Famiglia Capitano Ultimo, in the Parco della Mistica, on the south-eastern outskirts of Rome, with the aim of defeating the culture of ethnic, religious, social or physical diversity by welcoming underprivileged minors who are given education and training that allows them to undertake honest work. He works alongside the Io Ci Sono association for the reconstruction of multifunctional centers in the areas of central Italy hit by the earthquake in 2016. In 2010, during the World Food Day ceremony, he was appointed FAO Good Will Ambassador. In 2005 he decided to research and produce stories in which he could express himself freely on an acting, creative and productive level, creating his own Film Production Company. The intent is to give space to projects with social value, which can, through cinema and television, spread messages that lead to reflection. He produces Sbirri, a docu-film on the world of police and drugs, which has enjoyed considerable success with audiences and critics both at the cinema and on TV. He presents the short film 15 Seconds in Brussels, against the death penalty, sponsored by the European Parliament, the Presidency of the Republic, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Education. He co-produces Io, l'altro which talks about racism and preconceptions and how the way of seeing others has changed after September 11th. With MediaFriends he produced two social shorts: Graffiti and Amore nero, the latter shot as a manifesto against violence against women, starring Michelle Hunziker and the directorial debut of Raoul himself. The short receives an official commendation from the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano. He works with some of the most influential names in the national and international film industry. In collaboration with Mediaset he produces successful television series such as Fuoco Amico Task Force 45, Come un Delfino with the music of Ennio Morricone and Come un Delfino-La serie. His debut as an actor took place in Una storia italiana directed by Stefano Reali, since then he has acted alongside Anthony Quinn, Sophia Loren, Giancarlo Giannini, Michele Placido, F. Murray Abraham, Sylvester Stallone, Carole Bouquet, Diane Lane, Sarah Jessica Parker, Angelina Jolie and many others. Protagonist of some of the most successful television series, such as the most recent Buongiorno mamma and Don Matteo (he recently finished filming its second season), and the recently aired I Fantastici 5, where the theme of youth disability is addressed, while we will soon see him on the big screen in the film Greta e le favole vere.\n\n\"Shall We Begin!\", the battlecry of The undefeated Gaul Crixus first bought Manu Bennett's voice & acting career to international attention. Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011) spoke a universal language that slowly but surely captured a massive audience. The the show lost lead actor Andy Whitfield to cancer, Bennett's pivotal role, transitioning from Spartacus' nemesis to a slave rebel leader, he was credited for maintaining throughout, the heart & strength of the series. Producer/Director Peter Jackson then employed Bennett to portray Orc Leader \"Azog - The Defiler\". At the World Premiere of The Hobbit, Peter Jackson told press that Bennett's was the \"The Breakout Performance\". Although many Tolkein fans failed to recognize him beneath the CGI veneer, Bennett's looming presence, hunting down Thorin Oakenshield & culminating in the ultimate face-off, where both characters die, Bennett entered the catalogue of the great cinematic Villain Performances. DC Comic soldier of fortune, Slade Wildon aka Deathstroke had slumbered for two decades until Bennett reprised the role on the CW series Arrow. Many DC fans declared Bennett as the best villain on the hit series when he established a heartfelt dominant core relationship with Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell). The two befriended upon the Island of Lian Yu before an incident with a super-drug called Mirakuru transformed Slade into the archetypal good guy/bad guy Deathstroke. Originally penned by Marv Wolfman & illustrated by George Perez, Deathstroke has now become a hot property for the DC Universe with Tony Daniels illustrating the new series of Deathstroke comic books & a Warner Bros Deathstroke feature film pending. When MTV shifted their focus toward producing original series they selected Bennett to portray the Dark Druid Allanon in the newly acquired Shannara Chronicles Series. Bennett had just the right mix of stoicism, angst & dramatic suave sought by the Shannara producers & author Terry Brooks. Manu Bennett is of Maori, Scottish, English, French & Finish ancestry. Bennett was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Bennett's great grandfather Frederick Augustus Bennett was the first Maori Bishop of the Anglican Church in New Zealand. Bennett's namesake Manuhuia Bennett (grandfather) was also ordained an Anglican Bishop. The Bennett name has roots dating back to a French Benedictine Monastery established in Northumbria in Northern England circa 500AD. The monastery was subsequently turned into a defensive fort named Chillingham Castle. With the advent of surnames circa 1000AD, the name Bennett was derived from Benedictine.\n\nManu Bennett's father Charles Edward Tiwha (Ted) Bennett was a popular New Zealand singer who recorded a No.1 hit \"Clap Your Hands\" & several other hits in the early 1960's. Bennett's mother Jean Clark was a bikini model from Australia who paraded the very first two piece bikini for designer Paula Stafford. Bennett's parents met during the Spring Blossom Festival in Hastings New Zealand. Bennett has two older siblings, Stephen & Rachel. The Bennett family moved to Australia in 1970. Jean Bennett nee Clark, was the winner of the Miss Paradise Beach, a swimsuit title held on the Gold Coast of Australia. Bennett's first acting job was on a series titled Paradise Beach, where he played stud, surf lifesaver, iron man Kirk Barsby. Bennett's mother, Jean, died in a car accident in 1985. His brother Stephen suffered injuries in a separate car accident & died only two weeks later.\n\nDuring his schooling Manu Bennett trained as a dancer & musician & well as playing Rugby Union. Bennett was selected for the First XV for Te Aute College a Maori Boy school know for their strong rugby union history. On return to Australia Bennett was selected for the NSW Schoolboys Rugby Union Team & to trial for the Australian National Team. Bennett was prevented from attending the National trial outs due to a prior commitment to a ballet production of Swan Lake in which he had to perform the male lead. In the the 90's Bennett had to choose between a ballet scholarship in New York or an acting scholarship at The Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. Bennett decided to pursue his acting career & attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nManu has appeared on various TV dramas & feature films, including multiple award winning \"Lantana,\" opposite Anthony La Paglia. His first physical role was with appearing opposite Jon Cena on \"The Marine\". WWE was impressed with Bennett so gave him a role in their second feature film The Condemned starring opposite \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin & Vinnie Jones. Rob Tapert cast Bennett as Marc Antony in Xena Warrior Princess, then opposite Josh Hartnett in the Vampire Horror 30 Days Of Night, then was pivotal in Bennett getting the role of Crixus in the series Spartacus.\n\nPrevious TV credits include starring roles in successful New Zealand productions \"Shortland Street,\" \"Street Legal,\" \"Mataku,\" \"Creature Of Quest,\" \"Going Straight,\" and as Marc Antony opposite his \"Spartacus\" co-star Lucy Lawless in Tapert and Raimi's hit series \"Xena: Warrior Princess.\"\n\nJeffrey Leon Bridges was born on December 4, 1949 in Los Angeles, California, the son of well-known film and TV star Lloyd Bridges and his long-time wife Dorothy Dean Bridges (nÃ©e Simpson). He grew up amid the happening Hollywood scene with big brother Beau Bridges. Both boys popped up, without billing, alongside their mother in the film Auf BewÃ¤hrung freigelassen (1951), and appeared on occasion with their famous dad on his popular underwater TV series Abenteuer unter Wasser (1958) while growing up. At age 14, Jeff toured with his father in a stage production of \"Anniversary Waltz\". The \"troublesome teen\" years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand.\n\nHe recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV- movie Silent Night, Lonely Night (1969), and in the strange Burgess Meredith film The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go (1970). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed Halls of Anger (1970), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film Die letzte Vorstellung (1971). The Peter Bogdanovich- directed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd) and Oscar winners out of its older cast (Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman). The part of Duane Jackson, for which Jeff received his first Oscar-nomination (for \"best supporting actor\"), set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable).\n\nOwning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining Stacy Keach in Fat City (1972); his Civil War-era conman in the western In schlechter Gesellschaft (1972); his redneck stock car racer in Der letzte Held Amerikas (1973); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh (1973); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to Clint Eastwood in Die Letzten beiÃen die Hunde (1974); his aimless cattle rustler in Rancho Deluxe (1975); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in Ins Herz des wilden Westens (1975); and the brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in Philadelphia Clan (1979). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn't.\n\nPerhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 science-fiction cult classic Tron (1982), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother Beau Bridges over the attentions of sexy singer Michelle Pfeiffer in Die fabelhaften Baker Boys (1989). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in Starman (1984), and earned even higher regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in Tucker - Ein Mann und sein Traum (1988).\n\nSince then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. KÃ¶nig der Fischer (1991), American Heart - Die zweite Chance (1992), Fearless - Jenseits der Angst (1993), The Big Lebowski (1998) (now a cult phenomenon) and Rufmord - Jenseits der Moral (2000) (which gave him a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as Robert Downey Jr.'s nemesis in Iron Man (2008) and then, at age 60, he capped his rewarding career by winning the elusive Oscar, plus the Golden Globe and Screen Actor Guild awards (among many others), for his down-and-out country singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart (2009). Bridges next starred in Tron: Legacy (2010), reprising one of his more famous roles, and received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his role in the Western remake True Grit - Vergeltung (2010). In 2014, he co-produced and starred in an adaptation of the Lois Lowry science fiction drama HÃ¼ter der Erinnerung - The Giver (2014).\n\nJeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of Rancho Deluxe (1975)).
