Cadell] On 10 March 1943 this officer was detailed to patrol the ravine 303496 (Hunts Gap) and destroy enemy patrols cutting telephone lines or attacking pack transport supplying forward companies. He took out his patrol at dark and at 0300 hrs brought them in again without having contacted enemy. About dawn 11 March he returned to his task taking only one Non-Commissioned Officer Corporal Williamson to cover the same ground in daylight. At about 0715 hrs they saw a German patrol of six men approaching and laid themselves in ambush. At 200 yds range they fired with their Bren gun and killed two enemy. The other four took cover in a fold in a field of beans and opened fire with a 42mm machine gun and automatics. Captain Cadell and Corporal Williamson replied and then made a quick move left flanking. They then succeeded in killing the German machine gunner and wounding the Sergeant leading the patrol and forced the remaining two to surrender. They brought back three prisoners, a machine gun, two Schmeisser guns, two Luger pistols, maps and personal papers. The courage, skill and determination of this officer provides an excellent example of the qualities required by our patrols in dominating 'no man's land' and retaining the initiative. He has shown similar qualities earlier in the North African operation in destroying by explosives German tanks at Djebel Abiod in November 1942.\n\n[Recommended by Lt.Col. J.G.

Consul­General, Naples, 1977-1981. * On the 1st December 1944, Capt. J.D. Campbell was ordered to take the last enemy stronghold south of Fiume Uniti, a fortified house named Caserma dei Fiume Uniti. During the night he moved forward commanding a party of six men across marshy country, walking in water breast deep for about six miles. At dawn, cold and tired, he was hidden in a wooden shack approx. 25 yds of completely open ground away from the enemy strong point, here a German dog came in - but a tin of bully was just enough to keep him quiet. After an hour of waiting for a suitable opportunity Capt. Campbell decided to rush the house, which was built on a concrete and high base. In full view of the enemy he led his men up to the barbed wire fence at the double, took the only passage to the house, broke the door in, and before the enemy could take any action captured, practically single-handed, 11 enemy soldiers and all their equipment, including 3 LMGs. Then keeping cool after his success he managed to evacuate his 11 prisoners without attracting the attention of the enemy in another house 350 yds away - he then occupied the house and took defensive measures. During the evening of the same day, still with the same little force, very tired by now, he ambushed two unaware enemy relieve parties, captured four more prisoners, and killed six more of the enemy including two officers. This feat of arms is one of the best examples of courage and leadership and self control of an officer. For his brother officers and his men such an action is always and will be a daring and difficult aim to reach.\n\n** On 23rd April 1945 at Massa Fiscaglia (Italy) Capt. Campbell got the information that 40 Germans were defending a farm. The information emphasized that they were German troops and well dug-in in front of the house, and that they had several MGs and Panzerfaust. Judging that the risk was too big for a frontal attack the position was approached with 2 armed jeeps only. In bright daylight and in full view of the enemy two jeeps charged down the road, surprised the enemy by his devastating fire and his daring, overshot the enemy's first pit, found himself and his vehicle in and amongst the enemies, killed 8, wounded 10 and captured the remainder. On the 29th at Vigonovo (Italy) Capt.

The attack had to form up in complete darkness and had to traverse the main offshoot of the Wadi Akarit at an angle to the line of advance. In spite of heavy machine gun and shell fire in the early stages of the attack, Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell successfully accomplished this difficult operation, captured at least 600 prisoners and led his Battalion to its objective, having to cross an unswept portion of the enemy minefield in doing so. Later, upon reaching his objective he found that a gap which had been blown by the Royal Engineers in the anti-tank ditch did not correspond with the vehicle lane which had been cleared in the minefield. Realising the vital necessity of quickly establishing a gap for the passage of anti-tank guns, he took personal charge of this operation. It was now broad daylight and, under very heavy machine-gun fire and shell fire, he succeeded in making a personal reconnaissance and in conducting operations which led to the establishing of a vehicle gap. Throughout the day Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell held his position with his Battalion in the face of extremely heavy and constant shell fire, which the enemy was able to bring to bear by direct observation. About 1630 hours determined enemy counter-attacks began to develop, accompanied by tanks. In this phase of the fighting Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell's personality dominated the battle field by a display of valour and utter disregard for personal safety, which could not have been excelled. Realising that it was imperative for the future success of the Army plan to hold the bridgehead his Battalion had captured, he inspired his men by his presence in the forefront of the battle, cheering them on and rallying them as he moved to those points where the fighting was heaviest. When his left forward company was forced to give ground he went forward alone, into a hail of fire and personally reorganised their position, remaining with the company until the attack at this point was held. As reinforcements arrived upon the scene he was seen standing in the open directing the fight under close range fire of enemy infantry and he continued to do so although already painfully wounded in the neck by shell fire. It was not until the battle died down that he allowed his wound to be dressed. Even then, although in great pain, he refused to be evacuated, remaining with his Battalion and continuing to inspire them by his presence on the field. Darkness fell with the Argylls still holding their positions, though many of its officers and men had become casualties. There is no doubt that but for Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell's determination, splendid example of courage and disregard of pain, the bridgehead would have been lost. This officer's gallantry and magnificent leadership when his now tired men were charging the enemy with the bayonet and were fighting them at hand grenade range, are worthy of the highest honour, and can seldom have been surpassed in the long history of the Highland Brigade.\n\nCampbell,\n\nVictor David Graham\n\nSon of late Gen.

After the battle had been in progress for some time and only five tanks were in action, 2/Lieut. CARTER helped to cover the withdrawal of the guns. His 2-pounder went out of action but he carried on firing his Besa until his tank was knocked out. On the 8th June 42 in the attack on the enemy positions S.W. of B.13 (M.R. 907631) 2/Lieut. CARTER once again led his troop with great skill and daring. In the action 360 prisoners were taken and many anti-tank guns. This officer has throughout all these operations set a very high example to his men and his leadership has at all times been most skillful and daring. In the battle of the 8th June I actually saw him jump out of his tank under heavy shell fire to cary in a wounded Italian prisoner.

V. Harley, Royal Sussex Regiment, attached Royal Army Ordnance Corps, was on duty at No. 3 Central Ammunition Sub-Depot, Hampstead Norris (Bramley), supervising the receipt of ammunition. He was in the sorting shed when a round of 25 Pdr. Ammunition exploded and injured six soldiers of the Royal Pioneer Corps, one of whom died later. The blast was so violent that it blew other shell to pieces, reduced many more to a very dangerous condition, started a fire, and blanketed the area with smoke. Captain Harley immediately ordered all men out of the building, leaving it himself only when he could see no more personnel. He re-entered the building almost immediately to find some injured men running out. Without hesitation he went right up to the scene of the explosion which was still enveloped in smoke, and saw flames. He ordered a soldier who was at his side (No. 14441727) Pte. McGarrigle, Royal Pioneer Corps, to fetch fire appliances, and himself went further into the smoke where he found a badly injured soldier staggering about. By this time another helper had arrived and Captain Harley, after seeing that the injured soldier was being evacuated, ran to the office next door to call the ambulance and fire brigade. Next he saw that all the casualties were being attended to, and ordered the most serious cases to be taken to hospital straight away in a unit vehicle. Then he again went to the scene of the explosion to check up that the fire was out and that there were no further casualties, and finally ordered a roll call to see that all his personnel had been accounted for. Captain Harley, owing to his proximity to the explosion suffered considerably from its effects; he had seen the wounded men and heard their screams, and was fully aware of the possibility of further detonations taking place. In spite of this he showed bearing and leadership of the very highest order, and undoubtedly his exemplary behaviour affected the discipline of the men under his command in their efforts to extinguish the fire and succour the casualties under very hazardous circumstances.
