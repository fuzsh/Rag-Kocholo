The Mail from London to Bampton, at half-past 5, will open a communication with this city, morning and evening, which is much wanted.\n\nSeptember 1828\n\nGreat praise is due to the owners, occupiers of land, and inhabitants of Bampton, who, to forward the views of the post-office, and in expectation of a mail through Tiverton to that village, have subscribed handsomely to erect a bridge, of Bampton stone, over the Batherum.

Curiosus asks “May they not have covered the remains of some Bourchiers, who for a time were lords of Bampton, and patrons of the Church?” - 'Spectator'.\n\nAn inquest was held by R.H. Aberdein, Esq., on the 10th instant at Bampton, on the body of Isaac Kingdon, yeoman, aged 27 years.

Verdict: Died by the visitation of God.\n\nThe Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors: William Balmont, formerly of Bampton, and late of Tiverton, both in the county of Devon. Attorney-at-Law.\n\nYear: 1834\n\nJanuary 1834\n\nJohn Whitefield was indicted for assaulting William Jutson in the Parish of Bampton, on the 26th July last. Robert Escott: “I am a shoemaker, living at Bampton. On the day in question I saw John Whitfield jump out of the chamber window of his own house – it adjoins the Angel Inn. I then saw the constable, William Jutson, come forth and require peace. No sooner had he required peace than defendant struck him two or three times in the breast. The constable then laid hold of him and pulled out his staff. He did not strike defendant. Samuel Gibbins, a butcher: “I was stood in the street. I saw the prisoner come out of the chamber window, and laid hold of him. He went quietly along with the prosecutor.” Anthony Bowden, a tailor, gave a similar statement. The Chairman said it was a question of credibility of evidence. The jury acquitted the defendant, who was discharged on payment of fees, £2 6s 4.\n\nJuly 1834\n\nMarriage: July 8, at Sandford, near Crediton, Mr. Richard Hodge, of Venman's Farm, Bampton to Elizabeth, only daughter of the late Mr. John Daw, of Sandford.\n\nYear: 1835\n\nMarch 1835\n\nA farmer named Crutch, residing in the parish of Bampton, who had been subject of fits, walked into his fields to see his lamb, and not returning when expected, some persons of his family went to seek after him, and he was found dead in a pit, into which he had fallen.\n\nYear: 1836\n\nJuly 1836\n\nWilliam Venn, 26, convicted at the last Assizes of having stolen fifteen letters from out of the post-bag from Bampton to Dulverton; and a bugle and pair of gloves the property of John Reed, the driver of the mail-cart between those towns, but as to whom judgment was respited, was sentenced to be transported 7 years.\n\nYear: 1837\n\nFebruary 1837\n\nAn inquest on the body of William French, of Bampton, who died in the Devon and Exeter Hospital, in consequence of injury he received last week from the falling of a quantity of earth and stone, while he was at work in a limestone quarry.

He arrived at Taunton on Saturday morning, at four o'clock, in a cart; from thence he proceeded on foot the distance of twenty miles, and he arrived at his sister's house at two o'clock the same day, very much fatigued. On Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, his nephew, who slept with him, found him dead by his side. An inquest has since been held, when a verdict was returned of “Died by the visitation of God.”\n\nYear: 1840\n\nJanuary 1840\n\nTrial of Prisoners: John Webber, for stealing half a sovereign from William Bell, of Bampton. 14 days.\n\nFebruary 1840\n\nA fire occurred at Bampton on Tuesday week last, on a farm called Luttrell Farm, the property of William Maunder jun. The fire happened at half-past ten at night; it destroyed a barn, two linhays, and four bullocks – a fifth is very much injured. No account can be given of the cause of the fire, which is supposed to be the work of an incendiary. The property had been insured about a fortnight.\n\nMarch 1840\n\nMarianne Fisher, for entering the dwelling-house of James Burge, at Bampton, with intent to commit a felony. Imprisonment and kept to hard labour 6 weeks.\n\nAugust 1840\n\nDavey v Oxenham: An action of ejectment to recover a piece of land in possession of the defendant, in the parish of Bampton. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, with leave to enter a non-suit, upon a point raised that the defendant having held quiet possession above 20 years, he could not legally be disturbed.\n\nYear: 1841\n\nMarch 1841\n\nJohn Fisher, 31, and John Gibbings, 31, were convicted of stealing from a cave at Bampton, a quantity of potatoes, the property of James Greenway. Fisher 6 months, and Gibbings 3 months to hard labour.\n\nBenjamin Collard, 21, guilty of stealing a quantity of potatoes from a cave at Bampton, the property of William Cottrell, 2 months, hard labour.\n\nAgnes Alford, 42, was charged with having on 26th February last, at Bampton, stolen from the shop of William Jutson, a piece of butter, value 4d. Mary Ann Dibble, a deaf woman, swore to seeing the woman take the butter from the counter. Three weeks imprisonment, hard labour.\n\nMay 1841\n\nOn Monday a fire broke out in a house in High Street, Bampton, the property of Thomas Burge, thatcher. In the room on the ground floor Burge had placed a quantity of browse, and on the day of the accident had lit a fire and hung his jacket before it to dry. A woman called Richards, who lived next door, was the first person who observed the fire. At that time the room below stairs was in a complete blaze, and the flames were rapidly ascending. Two houses are completely destroyed and three others considerably damaged.\n\nOn Friday last an action of debt was tried in which Mr. Pearse, a lime burner, of Bampton, was plaintiff, and Mr. Maunder, of the same parish, complainant. The suit was brought for a balance of a lime account, amounting to £3 8s 4d. The Jury gave a verdict for the amount claimed.\n\nJune 1841\n\nOn Monday last a man named George Leigh, while working in a quarry pit near Bampton, met with a severe accident from the explosion of the gunpowder used in blasting the rock, which shattered his hand and wrist most dreadfully.

This rev. gentleman has also increased the fees for certain portions of his duties.\n\nDecember 1842\n\nGracious Bailey, late of Bampton, stone-mason and quarryman was declared to be entitled under the benefit of the insolvency act, and ordered to be discharged forthwith.\n\nYear: 1843\n\nJanuary 1843\n\nA Shooting Match came off at Bampton on Wednesday last for £1 3s., firing 10 shots each. The competitors were Mr. James Fewings, Mr. Edward Hawkins, and Mr. John Hookway, all of Bampton. Mr. Fewings killed 9 birds, Mr. Hawkins 9, and Mr. Hookway 10. The above gentlemen will take any others in the same parish for £3.\n\nFebruary 1843\n\nOn Thursday last the choir of this parish held their annual feast at the Red Lion Inn, where an excellent dinner was supplied, which reflected the greatest credit on the worthy landlord, Mr. S. Bray.\n\nA gentleman of Bampton, used last year 1½ cwt. of Nitrate of Soda upon 1½ acres of wheat, which produced 65 bushels; the same land had never before yielded above 35 bushels.\n\nApril 1843\n\nWilliam Davey, 16, pleaded guilty to a charge of stealing a purse containing one sovereign and a half, from the dwelling-house of Nicholas Vickery, of Bampton, on the 29th March.

Verdict for plaintiff, subject to certain points of law.\n\nOn Saturday, about one o'clock in the afternoon, a fire broke out in High Street, which destroyed eleven houses and damaged two. The West of England engine, of Bampton, and the subscription engine were soon on the spot, but the fire having got beyond their control, they sent for the Tiverton West of England engine, which, after a few hours succeeded in getting the fire under. The cause of the fire is unknown.\n\nNovember 1843\n\nDied: November 22, at his residence, Beaufy Terrace, Maida Hill, Mr. Robert Branscombe, late of Old Fish Street, and formerly of Bampton.\n\nDecember 1843\n\nTheir Worships found a true bill against Harriet Henson for stealing a bit of butter from Mr. Henry Oaten, of Bampton. The poor little girl was placed at the dock, and the learned judge and all the court appeared relieved with the prospect of something to do. But they were doomed to be disappointed, Harriet, wiping the tears from her eyes, and hiding herself behind the dock, which from her smallness she was well able to do, pleaded Guilty. Six months imprisonment.\n\nYear: 1844\n\nFebruary 1844\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Exeter has appointed the Rev. G.C. Hawkins to the vacant portion of Bampton vicarage (the third portion), vacant by the death of the Rev. D. Winstanley.\n\nMarch 1844\n\nBenjamin Collard, who made his escape in January with Easterbrook, was taken on the 12th inst at Bampton.

Periam of Bampton on 31st December. Guilty: one month imprisonment and hard labour.\n\nRichard Hawkins was charged with stealing two pieces of timber, the property of Rev. E. Rendell, of Bampton. Six months imprisonment.\n\nJohn Gibbons was found guilty of an assault on the Bampton constable, Robert May, in the execution of his duty. The prisoner, having differed with his wife on a point of parental discipline, began to beat her; “murder” was cried, and the constable came. The prisoner bore him a grudge for having apprehended him four years ago, and instantly knocked out six of his teeth, cut his lip, and attempted to throw him into the river. Fortunately a carpenter, named Gale, came to the rescue. Six months imprisonment.\n\nOctober 1845\n\nOn Friday night, the 26th September, there was stolen from Mr. Philip Hodge, auctioneer, of Bowbierhill, Bampton, 15 full-grown ducks, several bags of apples and turnips: within a few nights of the same time, from Mr. Henry Ellis, of Duvale Barton, Bampton, more than a dozen bags of apples; from Mr. William Hodge, of Gumbland Farm, Bampton, on the 14th inst., the thieves killed a fine ewe sheep, and took away one of the legs, part of the loin, and a shoulder. It is the opinion of many that the sheep was not really dead when those parts were taken from it. The remainder of the carcase was horrible to look at, from the evident brutality of the thieves. Our correspondent thinks it high time for the parishioners to take some active means to detect such desperate villains.\n\nYear: 1846\n\nJanuary 1846\n\nJames Taylor; for stealing potatoes from Richard Trapnell, at Bampton, six weeks solitary.\n\nAugust 1846\n\nRichard Hawkins, 28, and Elizabeth Yeandell, 30, were charged with burglariously breaking open the house of Miss Davy, of Bampton, and stealing a silver coffee pot, milk jug, spoons, and various other articles of plate, on the night of the 3rd or the morning of the 4th of November last. The case was rather a peculiar one, as a man named Lewis had been tried and transported for life as being the actual burglar. The case against the prisoners mainly rested on certain conversations which had taken place between various prisoners at the jail, whose evidence must be viewed with great suspicion. The Learned Judge summed up with great care and minuteness, and most commendable impartiality. The jury, after a few minutes deliberation, acquitted both the prisoners.\n\nOctober 1846\n\nThe first annual ploughing match of the Bampton Farmers' Club took place on Friday the 16th instant, in a field belonging to Mr. Philip Hodge, on Luttrell Farm in the parish of Bampton. The ploughmen, ten in number, commenced their trial of skill at 9 o'clock. The ploughing was excellent, and performed with spirit. The successful competitors in the first class were;\n\nWilliam Stradling, ploughman to Mr. William Chave, Zeal, 1st. Prize, £1\n\nJohn Salisbury, ploughman to Mr. S.T. Periam, 2nd Prize, 15s\n\nWilliam Sanders, ploughman to Mr. Mr. W. Hill, Burrough 3rd Prize, 10s\n\nIn the second class the successful competitors were;\n\nJames Brewer, ploughboy to Mr. Richard Bowen, 1st Prize 15s\n\nJohn Trapnell, ploughboy to Mr. Richard Trapnell 2nd Prize 10s.\n\nA reward of 5s was, on the recommendation of the Judges, given to Thomas Webber, ploughman to Mr. William Hill, of Holcombe farm, for having done his work well, and driven his own horses, which none of the other ploughmen had done.\n\nYear: 1847\n\nJanuary 1847\n\nDied: January 7th at Bampton, Mr. Thomas Heathfield, formerly of Woodbury, in the 85th year of his age, after many years of severe suffering.\n\nMay 1847\n\nEarly on Tuesday morning some malicious persons threw an explosive and dangerous missile into the house of Mr. John Periam, and also against the windows of Mr. Edwards. A reward of £50 has been offered by the authorities for the discovery of the offenders. A letter from the neighbourhood received this day (Friday), informs us that yesterday, part of the cavalry in Tiverton was sent into this town for the preservation of the peace. This would imply that further disturbances had taken place.\n\nJuly 1847\n\nWilliam Jewell, stealing at Bampton a watch, from William Watts. Four months imprisonment.\n\nSeptember 1847\n\nA wrestling match took place at Bampton, last week, for a purse of ten pounds, when the prizes were well contended for, by some of the prime men of North Devon. The first prize was awarded to Hosegood who played Miller for twenty minutes in fine style, when he threw him an exceedingly good fall. The second to Miller; the third to Bond; and the fourth to Buckingham.\n\nOn Saturday a novel run came off in this neighbourhood, the object of it being to catch a fine southern sheep, the gift of Mr. Edward Stone, of this place, cattle-dealer, which was to be the prize of the first man who caught it by the tail. The animal bolted, followed by fifteen stout fellows on foot and fifty gentlemen on horseback, among whom were Messrs, Stone, Trapnell, Chave, Brook, Davey, Morris, Oaten, Ellis jun., and Page. Eventually the animal was lost in a fir plantation near Langridge. The extent of the run was not less than 18 miles, which was performed in two hours and a quarter, the animal clearing not less than 200 gates and fences.\n\nDied: September 21st at Bampton, deeply regretted, Thomas Farrant, tanner, aged 65.\n\nNovember 1847\n\nThe late vicar of Bampton died. His daughter's husband wrote to his successor for a copy of the register, and received a very polite reply by way of informing him that the Church trusts no man. The letter which the vicar of Bampton wrote to the son-in-law of his predecessor was to this effect: “I never send a certificate without a fee of half-a-crown, prepaid, and twopence postage. Pay two and eightpence to my brother, the lawyer, in Tiverton, and he will give you the certificate.” Special incivility like this is worthy of a gentleman, whether in orders or not”\n\nYear: 1848\n\nJuly 1848\n\nMr. Philip Blundell Hill, of Bampton, insolvent came up for his first examination. The debts amounted to £180, out of which were tavern bills exceeding £50. The judge dismissed the petition, on the ground of its containing numerous extravagant items, contracted without prospect of payment.\n\nDecember 1848\n\nWilliam Lazarus, 31, and George Butson, 22, charged with stealing five bushels of wheat from Mr. Henry Ellis, of Bampton, 29th August. Acquitted.\n\nYear: 1849\n\nJanuary 1849\n\nLast week a fire occurred at Lang's Farm in Bampton, in the occupation of Mr. Richard Cleeve, by which a large portion of the dwelling-house and stable was consumed.\n\nWatson v Bennett – These parties are brothers-in-law and excise officers, the former living at Bampton, and the other at Morchard Bishop. The claim was for £20, for the maintenance and clothing of the defendant's children, but it appeared that the whole debt amounted to £54, and it was reduced to £20, to bring it within the jurisdiction of the Court. Judgment was given for the £20, and ordered to be paid in £1 a month.\n\nJuly 1849\n\nJohn Roberts v Benjamin Oxenham – This was a claim of £2 12s 6d for rent of apartments in Magdalen Street, up to Lady Day last. Defendant, who lives at Bampton, denied having ever occupied the premises; it appeared his mother, a widow nearly 85 years old, had lived there fourteen years till within the last two years, when she was obliged to come on the parish for maintenance. His Honour adjourned the decision till next day, and then gave judgment for the plaintiff.\n\nSamuel Thomas was summoned by Maria Williams, of Bampton, for damaging the glass of her windows, to the amount of 2s 6d, on the 28th June. On the night in question he received “combustibles” on his person, thrown from the complainant's bedroom window, which greatly aggravated him and in return he smashed the complainant's glass. This, the Bench told him, he should not have done, but have applied for a summons. He was convicted in the damages and expenses, which he refused to pay, and was ordered to be committed to prison for 21 days.\n\nAugust 1849\n\nOn Monday morning, a little before one o'clock, two houses situate in Brook Street, and belonging to Mr. Francis Hodge, were discovered to be on fire. The fire broke out in the thatch over the passage, proving pretty clearly that this fire, like some of the others that have preceded it, was not accidental. Every effort was made to subdue the flames, but although they were prevented from extending, and the outbuildings were preserved, the two houses were destroyed.\n\nYear: 1850\n\nSeptember 1850\n\nDied: Sept 14th., at Bampton, after a lingering illness, Sarah, the beloved wife of Mr. Henry Oaten, aged 34.\n\nDied: Sept 18th., at Bampton, after a long illness, Mrs. Elizabeth Escott, of Barnhay Cottage, aged 63.\n\nOctober 1850\n\nAt the Bampton District Farmers' Club, prizes were given to long-serving agricultural labourers and servants:\n\nLargest Family - £2, to William Davy jun., of Bampton (12 children).\n\nLongest Farm Labour - £1 10s., to Robert Vickary, of Bampton, 24½ years with Mr. Francis Merson and his father on Waterhouse Farm.\n\n- £1 to William Brook, of Bampton, 23¼ years, on Combehead Farm, with Henry Badcock, Esq., and his father.\n\nLongest Servitude - £1, to Christiana Oxenham, 23¼ years with Mrs. S.W.Davey of Bampton.\n\n10s, to Elizabeth Webber, 7 years with Mr. Edward Brook of Bampton.\n\nOctober 1850\n\nGeorge Butson was sentenced to three months hard labour for stealing wheat from Edward Salisbury, at Bampton.\n\nNovember 1850\n\nMonday last, being the day appointed by the good Protestants of the neighbourhood of Bampton for expressing their indignation at the proceedings of “Pio Nono,” they set to work in right good earnest, by making an example of Cardinal Wiseman. Just as the church clock tolled the hour of seven, a man bearing on his shoulders the effigy of his Eminence, in full robes of office, preceded by six boys bearing torches and ringing bells, made his appearance at the top of Castle Street, followed by a great concourse of the inhabitants. Thus they perambulated the streets until 9 o'clock, when the Cardinal was bound to the stake, and a pile of faggots and tar barrels that had previously been prepared for the consummation, were lit – the flames shot up, and his Eminence was very soon a-blaze amidst the deafening shouts of hundreds of spectators. The scene was ever and anon enlivened by the display of fireworks; the evening passed off with great eclat, presenting an idea of the manner in which every Papal aggressor would be treated by the loyal Bamptonians.\n\nDied: October 26,, at Bampton, of scarlatina, aged 12 years, Julia Anne, eldest daughter of Mr. Brook.\n\nDecember 1850\n\nDied: December 10, at Tiverton, Jane, relict of the late Rev. Bartholomew Davey, vicar of Bampton, and rector of Calverleigh, aged 79.\n\nYear: 1851\n\nMarch 1851\n\nJames Hart was acquitted on a charge of stealing 10lbs of cheese from James Clarke, of Bampton, the Judge remarking that he ought not to have been brought there.\n\nApril 1851\n\nThe first surgical prize at St. Bartholomew's Hospital was awarded last year to John Langdon, Esq., second son of T. Langdon, Esq., of Bampton. The first medical prize has now just been awarded to the same gentleman, together with a scholarship of £50.\n\nMay 1851\n\nMr. Richard Trapnell, of Bampton, the celebrated cattle dealer, has recently received the appointment of purchaser of North Devon cattle for his Royal Highness Prince Albert. In compliance therewith he purchased two extraordinary bulls at Northmolton Fair on Wednesday last, which were immediately forwarded to his Royal Highness's farm at the Home Park, Windsor.\n\nSeptember 1851\n\nA fire broke out in the Bampton churchyard yesterday morning, which entirely consumed five dwelling-houses and outbuildings. The West of England and town engines were soon on the spot, but so dry was the state of the thatch, that it was impossible to get the fire under until the complete demolition of the property.\n\nOctober 1851\n\nA cart-mare belonging to Mr. Philip Hodge, auctioneer, on the night of the 13th inst., maliciously shot through the head.

This not being her first offence of a similar character, the Bench sentenced her to seven days, with hard labour.\n\nMarch 1862\n\nThomas Escott, blacksmith, of Bampton, was summoned to answer a charge of uttering a willful and malicious libel on Rebecca and Eliza Stanbury, of Bampton, milliners. The front of a house, said to be number 5 in Brook Street, was on the morning of the 8th instant found to be disfigured at places with offensive matter, and defendant on the Monday following had it cried by the common crier through the streets of Bampton that the complainants had commenced house decorating, and referred to the house number 5 as a specimen. Previous to the case being called, the Chairman asked if it could not be arranged out of court. After some discussion it was ultimately arranged that the defendant should give a written apology to the plaintiffs, and pay the costs, £1 17s 6d, on which the summons was dismissed.\n\nThomas Dunn, of Witheridge, labourer, was summoned by Mary Ann Hill, of Bampton, to show cause why he should not contribute to the support of his illegitimate child. An order was made for 1s 6d per week, and costs.\n\nApril 1862\n\nFew parishes now possess the power of punishment by the stocks, for the simple reason that those ancient relics have ceased to exist. Bampton, however, seems behind the age, for the stocks still remain, and on Saturday last were put into operation, the unfortunate victim being a man named William Copp, belonging to the town, who was placed in them by Sergeant Crabb, of the constabulary. The crime for which the punishment was inflicted was that of drunkeness. The poor wretch remained in them for six hours, during which time he was visited by nearly all the inhabitants of the town, it being many years since they were delighted by such a moral and enlightened scene.\n\nMay 1862\n\nJohn Strong, collector of tolls at the Bampton turnpike gate, was summoned for illegally demanding excessive toll from Mr. F. Bowden. The question arose whether an additional half toll could be levied on carts whose wheels were less than 4½ inches in width. The Bench decided that the collector was right in demanding the additional toll, and dismissed the summons.\n\nJune 1862\n\nWilliam Copp was summoned for being drunk and riotous, but did not appear. The police constable gave him a bad character, and stated that a short time since, he was placed in the stocks at Bampton, but that did not cure him of his drinking propensities. This time the bench sentenced him to seven days imprisonment.\n\nRobert Thomas, an elderly, respectable-looking gentleman, was charged with being drunk and riotous, at Bampton, on the 1st of June. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of 5s and 8s costs.\n\nJuly 1862\n\nHenry Hosegood, about 17 years old, a labourer, of Bampton, was charged with damage to an apple tree, the property of Mr. James Clark, the extent of which was valued at 2s 6d. Fined 2s 6d, and 8s 3d costs. Defendant said he could not pay now, as he had bad luck, and had just lost one finger. The Chairman said but for his good character the sentence would be heavier; if the fine was not paid he must be imprisoned for seven days.\n\nAugust 1862\n\nThe Bible Christians have been enjoying “high days” at Bampton in connection with the opening of their new chapel in the centre of the town. The services commenced on Friday the 15th when sermons were preached by Mr. Hockin of Bodmin. The congregations were large, and we understand that on Monday evening there were nearly 70 applications for pews and sittings.\n\nThe picnic in connection with the Mechanics Institute was held on the 24th inst in a field near the town kindly lent by Mr. Hill of Westbrook for the occasion. The Bampton band, which attended by engagement, was afterwards joined by the Huntsham band, and to their united strains dancing was kept up with great spirit until the close of the day.\n\nSeptember 1862\n\nA cricket match was played on the 10th inst., between the Bampton and Sampford Peverell Clubs, on the ground of the former, when the Sampfordians were victorious by eight wickets.\n\nRichard Takel, labourer, Bampton, was charged with being drunk and disorderly on the 18th ult. Fined 10s.\n\nJohn Ward, of Bampton, was charged with causing an obstruction on High Street, Bampton. From the evidence of Sergeant Crabb and Miss Mary Ann Escott, the prisoner was sitting on the steps of the Baptist Chapel, with his legs across the road. Defendant pretended that he was unlacing his boots, but had previously been cautioned for a similar offence and had used indecent language. Fined 10s. The money not being forthcoming, he was sent to Exeter gaol for seven days.\n\nOctober 1862\n\nJames Webber, of Bampton, was charged with being drunk and disorderly on the 27th of September. Fined 5s and costs, 8s 3d, which he paid.\n\nNovember 1862\n\nSarah Tucker v William Tucker: The parties stood in the relation of mother and son, and both were from Bampton. The dispute arose about a clock, which belonged to her late husband; and the old lady's tongue must have been wound up like the clock before she left home; for she began relating her grievances outside the court before his honour arrived; and was not tired now, although this was nearly the last case. As she had not administered to her late husband's effects, and being at present in receipt of parish relief, not likely to do so, the case was struck out.\n\nDecember 1862\n\nAnn Beaver, a wretched looking woman, with an infant at her breast, was charged with stealing five turnips, value one halfpenny, the property of Daniel Legg, of Bluebell Farm, near Bampton. The position of the woman was a curious one. She had been married, and had four children by her husband,. After his death she took up with another man, by whom she has two children, and on the birth of the first, the relief she had been receiving from the parish for the other four was stopped. The man she is now living with, broke his leg a few weeks ago in a drunken squabble at Bampton; so that had she been convicted, he would have been left helpless with six children. After a long enquiry, the difficulty was solved by Mr. Legg withdrawing the charge; and after receiving a sever reprimand from the Bench the prisoner was discharged.\n\nDied: On the 5th inst., at Bampton, Jane, the beloved daughter of Mr. Robert Godfrey, officer of Inland Revenue, aged 17.\n\nYear: 1863\n\nJanuary 1863\n\nHenry Salisbury and Henry Ascott, labourers of Bampton, were charged with poaching on the grounds of John Collins, Esq. Mr. Collins retired from the bench during the hearing of the case. Mr. Collins said he regretted bringing the defendants before the bench, but he found it necessary to protect his lands from being run over. Defendants pleaded guilty and were fined 20s each.\n\nJohn Brewer v James Poole: This was a claim of 15s for boots, by plaintiff, a shoemaker of Bampton, and caused some little amusement in court. The defendant admitted the debt, and offered to pay 6d a week. To this the plaintiff demurred, stating that Poole had received £227 from Mr. Densham lately, and had plenty of money in the bank. On hearing this His Honour ordered defendant to be sworn, when he feigned deafness, and the usher, Selby, handing him the Testament, told him to take hold of it. Poole asked what he was to do with it; when the judge requested Mr. Densham to examine him. On hearing this, defendant refused to kiss the book. His Honour ordered payment at 10s a month, and allowed plaintiff 5s for expenses; at the same time telling Mr. Poole the order would have been only 5s if he had not attempted to impose upon the court.\n\nFebruary 1863\n\nOn Wednesday last, William Lightfoot, a labourer, in the employ of Mr. Crudge, when driving a wagon through Bampton, was by some unknown means run over, and his legs broken. He was immediately conveyed to the Tiverton Union.\n\nJohn Howe was charged with being drunk and disorderly in the streets of Bampton the night of the 31st ult. The prisoner pleaded guilty, but the magistrates deferred sentence until they had heard another case, arising from the same proceedings – Edwin Escott was charged with a similar offence, and pleading not guilty the evidence was heard. P.C. Bragg stated that he heard a row near the Red Lion, and when he got there he saw the defendant with his coat off, and wanting to fight. He was drunk at the time. William Copp, a labourer, said defendant wanted to fight him. Witness declined the challenge, saying he had been locked up once before, and did not wish to be again. The defendant, in answer to the charge, said Copp wanted to pitch into Howe, and he went out to prevent it. The Chairman said there was hardly a meeting but somebody was brought before the Bench for drunkeness from Bampton. Sergeant Crabb replied these broils were constant on a Saturday night. The Bench fined Howe 1s, and 8s costs, while Escott was fined 2s 6d and 11s costs, with an intimation that if they came there again they would be sent to prison.\n\nOn Monday last George Thorne, gardener, of Bampton, died suddenly. On Wednesday an inquest was held, the verdict being “Died from the want of the common necessaries of life, from his own causes.”\n\nMarch 1863\n\nThe loyal town of Bampton celebrated the happy occasion with its wonted spirit and liberality. Tables were laid in the street, the sun shining, and nearly one thousand people (the poor and labouring classes), men, women, and children were provided with a hot generous dinner. Later in the day the volunteers and tradesmen held their celebration dinners, when the toasts of the day were drunk. A public ball concluded the Royal Wedding festivities.\n\nDied: March 21. after a lingering illness, Mr. William Crudge, ironmonger, Bampton, in the 68th year of his age.\n\nApril 1863\n\nThe poor of Bampton, who have been brought in contact with Mr. Hodge, the relieving officer, in the performance of his official duties, have presented that gentleman, on his retirement from the office, with an inkstand, as a mark of their gratitude at the kindness received from him.\n\nJohn Collins, of Bampton, labourer, was charged with unlawfully taking game in a field belonging to Mr. Heard, of Bampton. The evidence being conclusive the defendant was fined 40s.\n\nMay 1863\n\nThomas Shapcott, William Shapcott, and William Jones, three young men of the labouring class, belonging to Bampton, were charged with drunken and riotous conduct on the 9th May. P.C. Nicholas saw the defendants at ten o'clock on the night in question come out of a beer house, at Bampton, and all three of them were drunk. They proceeded a short distance down the road tolerably quiet, till they met a woman riding on horseback. They broke out in shouts of indecent language addressed to the woman. The Bench sent all three defendants to the County gaol for seven days. The defendants who evidently came expecting that 5s each would cover the damages, looked as though they didn't like it at all.\n\nJohn Oaten, son of the landlord of the White Horse, and Thomas Gibbings were charged with violently assaulting Edward Hawkins on the 1st of May. All the parties reside at Bampton. The magistrates fined the defendants £1 each: the defendant Gibbings had to pay 4s 6d in addition as he had been taken into custody, and released on giving bail.\n\nJuly 1863\n\nDied: July 14, Mr. John Hill, yeoman, Bampton, aged 61.\n\nAugust 1863\n\nEdward Salisbury v John Trapnell: This was an action to recover £1 13 3 d, the value of 19 ducks, in the possession of the defendant, and which the plaintiff claimed. The evidence was very conflicting. The plaintiff's witnesses were Mrs. Salisbury, Mr. Salisbury junr., Mr. William Oxenham, George Cornwall, William Davey, William Cottrell, William Spray, Hannah Spray, and John Kerslake. In June, the plaintiff had 46 ducks on his farm, and on the 3rd of that month he missed 27 of them. A stream flows through his yard, and the plaintiff concluded that the truants had swam away. A boy (Cornwall) whom he sent to look for them brought back eight. The witnesses for the defence were Mrs. Trapnell, Mrs. Ann Bamfield, Mrs. Harriet Taylor, Mary Burton, Thomas Hawkins, Mrs. Trickey, William and Samuel Fisher and P.C. Bird. At the conclusion of the case the learned Judge said that the evidence was so conflicting that he must say that the plaintiff had not made out his case, and the verdict must be for the defendant, but without costs.\n\nSeptember 1863\n\nCharlotte Greenslade, a single woman, residing at Bampton, and apparently about 30, summoned Richard Perrot, a blacksmith, living at Waterloo, near Walton, to show cause why he should not contribute towards the support of her illegitimate child, born on the 3rd October 1862. The Bench made an order of 1s 3d a week.\n\nNovember 1863\n\nRobert Hosegood, of Bampton, labourer, was summoned by John Collins, Esq., for setting a snare, for the purpose of killing game on his land. The offence was admitted and the defendant fined 2s 3d and cost 12s 9d.\n\nYear: 1864\n\nJanuary 1864\n\nJames Webber, of Bampton, was charged with being drunk on the 7th of January, and assaulting P.C. Ward. He had also been before the Bench on a former occasion, and as he had now been guilty of assault, they inflicted a fine of 5s, which together with costs, amounted to 13s 3d.\n\nJames Mortimore was charged with being drunk and disorderly at Bampton on the 7th of January. The Bench considered the case was not serious, as no assault had been made on anyone, and dismissed the prisoner on payment of costs 8s 3d.\n\nSamuel Cull and John Estcott, of Bampton, were charged with being on the night of the 20th and the morning of the 21st December in Westbrook coppice with guns, in pursuit of game. The defendants did not appear, and only sufficient evidence was taken to convict. The Bench said it was a clear case, and sentenced them to three months imprisonment with hard labour and at the end of that time to find two sureties for their behaviour for 12 months of £10 each. They also issued a warrant for their apprehension.\n\nFebruary 1864\n\nRobert How, of Bampton, was charged, at the instance of P.C. Smith, with being drunk and disorderly. Fined 1s and costs.\n\nWilliam Lazarus and George Greenslade, both of Bampton, pleaded guilty to charges of using defective weights. Fined 1s each.\n\nMarch 1864\n\nJohn Trickey, of Bampton, wheelwright, was summoned by Elizabeth Nott, of Bampton, who applied for an order to compel him to support her illegitimate child, of which she said he was the father. The Bench made an order of 5s a week for the first two months and 1s 6d a week afterwards, with full costs.\n\nFarrant and Williams, shopkeepers of Bampton v Thomas Salisbury, labourer, Bampton. Claim 13s 8d for drapery goods. 3S per month ordered.\n\nFarrant and Williams, shopkeepers of Bampton v Joseph Salisbury, labourer, Bampton. Debt admitted. Defendant offered 2s per month, which was accepted.\n\nApril 1864\n\nJames Land was fined 5s including costs, for being drunk and disorderly at Bampton.\n\nThe following were appointed constables for the Bampton parish for the ensuing year: Thomas Miles, James Dart, William Needs, John Trickey, and Robert Williams.\n\nThomas Beer, labourer, of Bampton, was charged with unlawfully using gins to take game, on the night of the 18th ult. The defendant pleaded guilty, and was convicted in the sum of £2 and costs, which he paid.\n\nTwo summonses obtained by Mr. Richard Selman, of Bampton, against John Wright for stealing some ash poles, and against John Parminter for leaving complainant's service, were called on, and dismissed by reason of the non-attendance of the complainant; but at the conclusion of the business, Mr. Selman put in an appearance, and expressed much surprise that the magistrates had not waited for him, as he had been detained in the market looking at some bullocks.\n\nMay 1864\n\nAn accident, which resulted in death, took place at Bolham, on Friday night, under the following circumstances. It appears that Mr. John Hancock, farmer, of Bampton, attended his uncle's annual sheep shearing at Bolham. About midnight he took his departure, riding a small Exmoor pony. Friends found him lying on his back in the road in a state of insensibility. Mr. Beedell, surgeon, of Tiverton, attended the unfortunate man as quickly as possible, and remained with him all night. He gradually sank, and died on Saturday about midnight.\n\nJune 1864\n\nOn May 30th the Friendly Society of Bampton held their annual meeting at the Angel Inn. The members assembled 'about 11 o’clock and marched in procession through the streets headed by the Bampton Brass Band, under the leadership of Mr. Wm. Nott, after which they returned to their club room, where an excellent dinner was provided by the worthy host and hostess.\n\nJames Land, labourer, of Bampton was charged with being drunk and riotous at that place. Defendant admitted the offence. Mr. Superintendent Collins said he had been convicted of the same offence on the 19th of April last. Drunken and riotous conduct had increased to such extent in Bampton, that he wished the defendant to be made an example of, in order to put a stop to it. The Bench said that as a fine seemed to have had no effect, they should send him to prison for seven days with hard labour.\n\nDefendant: “Thank'ee, Sir.”\n\nDied: June 16th, in Brook Street, Bampton, Mr. Ellis, senior, aged 76.\n\nJuly 1864\n\nSome excitement was caused in Bampton on Friday morning, by a report that a young man named Jacob Stone, aged 28, the son of parents in a humble sphere of life, had been found dead in his bed, at about half past 10 o'clock that morning. The inquest was held at the Tiverton Hotel, Bampton, on Saturday last. The jury was composed as follows: Messrs. Francis Hodge, John Crudge, William Crudge, James Dart, William Escott, Walter Escott, Samuel Gibbons, Thomas Gibbons, William Hodge, John Short, and William Thorne. The jury viewed the body, which was lying at Ivy Cottage, the residence of the deceased's parents. Henry John Edwards, surgeon, residing in Bampton, considered that he died a natural death, which might have been accelerated by heart disease. The Coroner said the jury could have no hesitation whatever in arriving at their verdict, and they accordingly returned a verdict of “Death from Natural Causes.”\n\nEdwin Crudge, of Bampton, ironmonger, was declared a bankrupt on Tuesday last.\n\nSeptember 1864\n\nSamuel Strong, described as a shoemaker, a young man of Bampton, was charged with assaulting Sergt. Lamacraft on the 12th of August. It appears that on that day the sergeant of police was called in by John Strong, the father of the defendant, to protect him against the violence of his son, who was beating him and willfully destroying his goods. Upon the sergeant entering the passage leading to the house, the defendant seized hold of him by the collar and swung him violently in the passage. The prisoner pleaded guilty, and the Bench took a lenient view of it, fining him 5s and costs.\n\nOctober 1864\n\nSamuel Strong, was charged with having, on the 1st of October at Bampton, assaulted P.C. Saunders in the execution of his duty. P.C. Saunders said that he was called to the Angel Inn, Bampton, to the prisoner, who was very violent, and who seized him by the collar, and nearly choked him. Superintendent Collins said he was very sorry to see the prisoner here; it was his second offence within a month. Fined £1 including costs. The fine was paid by defendant's father.\n\nLavinia Strong was charged with assaulting P.C. Lamacraft at the same time and place. P.C. Lamacraft said he assisted Saunders, the constable, in taking Strong into custody, when the prisoner, who was his wife, interfered and struck him, when he took her also in charge. She was discharged on payment of costs.\n\nNovember 1864\n\nAlfred Bray, an apprentice to Mr. James Davey, of Bampton, tailor, was summoned by his master for misconduct. On the 8th inst., defendant was requested to do a certain quantity of work during his master's absence, and he entirely neglected it. When gently remonstrated with by his mistress he was very impertinent. Case dismissed.\n\nBampton Extension Railway: It must be very gratifying to all who have any interest in the future welfare of Tiverton, Bampton, and Dulverton, to learn that the promoters of this line of railway are actively pushing forward the preliminary arrangements for its construction. It is intended to lay down one line of rails only at first, but to construct a way of sufficient breadth to lay down a double line, when the traffic should require it.\n\nDecember 1864\n\nRichard Tackle was charged by P.C. Saunders with being drunk and riotous in the streets of Bampton, on the 30th ultimo. The prisoner pleaded guilty. Superintendent Collins proved several convictions against the prisoner. The Bench said that he had been convicted before, and for the protection of society such men must be restrained. Fined 10s. Another summons against him for assaulting his father was withdrawn, as the complainant did not appear.\n\nA very remarkable case of self-destruction was committed in one of the public streets of Bampton, on the night of Wednesday or early on Thursday morning last. Mr Richard Selman an old and eccentric farmer renting Dipford Farm, Shillingford, well-known in the neighbourhood for his litigious and quarrelsome disposition, had been suffering for some months from a deranged state of mind, said to arise from an action at law pending between himself and a neighbouring farmer. In Little Silver Street he appears to have lifted a small grating, just large enough to admit his body, and descend into a shallow stream called the “Shuttern” only 11 inches deep, and drowned himself directly under the grating, apparently that his body might be discovered by some passer-by at daylight.\n\nOn Sunday evening a young man, named Webber, shockingly misconducted himself in the street. He left Bampton that afternoon and came to Tiverton for a “spree.” and when the people were coming out of church he assailed Superintendent Crabb in a most unbecoming manner. The next day he cut a very different figure before the magistrates, who fined him 20s. He had similarly transgressed on a previous occasion.\n\nYear: 1865\n\nJanuary 1865\n\nMary Williams, wife of Robert Williams, labourer of Bampton, preferred a complaint against James Butson for an assault. There was a cross-summons against Mary Williams for assaulting Butson's wife. The parties are neighbours, and a good deal of ill-feeling has existed between them for some time, and on the 18th inst. a quarrel took place between them in consequence of Butson having beaten his child with a strap. The Bench considered the best course would be to bind over each party to keep the peace towards the other, and each to pay their own costs.\n\nWilliam Wensley, of Bampton, was brought up in custody with attempting to commit suicide at Bampton. The defendant appears to have been in a low state of mind for some time and reduced in circumstances. He was lodging with a woman named Lock, and on Tuesday a lodger heard a moan proceeding from defendant's bedroom. She entered and found the accused laying on the bed with his head out over and his throat badly cut, a pocket knife lying by his side. Mr. Edwards, the medical officer, was called in and dressed the wounds which have since healed. The accused's son now attended and said if the magistrates discharged his father, he would take care of him for the future. At the recommendation of Mr. Edwards, the defendant was discharged with a caution not to attempt the foolish act again.\n\nFebruary 1865\n\nAt Dulverton Special Sessions Mary Jane Tidball, a native of Bampton, but who has been a servant to James Patterson, farmer, of Brushford, was brought up in custody, charged with stealing a pillow case and two pair of sleeves, the property of Mrs. Patterson. Sentenced to one month's imprisonment with hard labour.\n\nMarch 1865\n\nAn inquest was held on Monday, on the body of a newly-born infant which was picked up in a gutter near the police-station. Mr. Edwards, medical officer, examined the body, and gave it as his opinion that it had been born about 24 hours. An open verdict was returned.\n\nSamuel Strong, of Bampton, shoemaker (who did not appear), was charged by P.C. Davis with assaulting him whilst in the execution of his duty. Strong's conduct was very violent, and he was taken into custody. Whilst on the road to the lock-up Strong kicked Davis in the legs and tore his coat. He also endeavoured to bite. The Bench inflicted a fine of £1, and issued a warrant of distress for its recovery.\n\nJames Burge, of Bampton, pleaded guilty to the charge of stealing a clothes line, belonging to Mary Ann Brock, of the same place, and was committed for seven days with hard labour.\n\nMary Toze, 43, on bail, was indicted for setting fire to a dwelling house, the property of Ann Pearce, at Bampton, on the 28th December. The prisoner denied having anything to do with the affair. Mr. Clarke addressed the jury in defence, and called Mr. Phillips who said he never knew any harm by her; she conducted herself as most working people do – respectably. The jury found the prisoner not guilty, and his Lordship ordered her to be discharged.\n\nApril 1865\n\nWilliam Hawkins, labourer, of Bampton, was charged with being drunk and riotous, and damaging the property of Mr. Hodge landlord of the “Great House”, Bampton, and also with assaulting P.C. Davis and Sergeant Lamacraft. Prisoner had nothing to say in his defence, only that he was very sorry for what he had done. Fined £5 and expenses, or two months hard labour. Committed in default.\n\nThe Bampton Soup Kitchen was closed for the season on the 29th March last. The quantity of soup sold at the reduced price of a penny a quart has been about 4,000 quarts, for which the purchasers have invariably expressed much thankfulness. The kitchen will re-open next season with excellent prospects. It has been most cordially supported and thoroughly appreciated by all classes, and has proved to be the means of much comfort and help to the poor during the inclement weather, of an unusually long and severe winter.\n\nMay 1865\n\nRe John Nott, of High Street, Bampton, glazier. This bankrupt came up for the last examination. No opposition was offered, and he received his discharge. Mr. Densham appeared for the bankrupt.\n\nJune 1865\n\nJohn Atkins and William Webber, both of Bampton, for whom Mr. Densham appeared, pleaded guilty to a charge of having, on the 29th May, cut down part of an oak tree on Mr. Rowcliff's land, at Bampton. Fined 9d., value 1s., and the costs.\n\nMr. William Trickey, the landlord of the Tiverton Hotel, Bampton, was charged with keeping his house open on the morning of Sunday 21st May, for the sale of beer. Fined 10s inclusive of costs.\n\nJuly 1865\n\nMr. Francis Bowden of the Castle Inn, Bampton, was charged by Sergeant Lamacraff with keeping open his house for the sale of beer after eleven o'clock on the night of Sunday the 9th inst. Mr. Densham, who appeared for the defence, stated that he would shew by the oath of two of the men present at the time that no sale of beer took place after eleven o'clock. He then called Thomas Thorn and William Bray, who deposed to that fact, and the Bench dismissed the summons.\n\nAugust 1865\n\nLynch law, that element so foreign to English jurisprudence, seems in a fair way to gain and unchecked, and not wholly unjustifiable, ascendancy at Bampton. The police force, those members thereof stationed at Bampton, seem to have drawn down upon themselves the odium of the entire population of the place. This feeling of dislike and dissatisfaction has long been smouldering, receiving augmentation from time to time by various acts of indiscretion, officiousness, or unnecessary severity on the part of the police officers, at the head and front of which Sergeant Lamacraft has figured, until the 25th of last month, when it came to an open and unequivocal demonstration. The occasion was, as our readers are aware, the dismissal of the summons against Mr. Bowden, of the Castle Inn, for keeping his house open after hours, taken out bu the police. Something very much resembling a riot then took place, several of the windows of the Police Station being broken.\n\nSeptember 1865\n\nCharlotte Howe, described as a single woman, of Bampton, of questionable reputation, was charged with being drunk and riotous in that town. P.C. Davis deposed that on Sunday morning last he saw defendant in the street slapping a man in the face. Defendant pleaded that she was obliged to be disorderly because two men insulted and annoyed her. Fined 7s., including costs.\n\nMr. R. Yendell, a retired surgeon of Bampton, appeared in the box, and said that as an inhabitant of that parish, he appealed to the Bench to put a stop to the dirty, filthy language used there on Sundays, particularly as parties returned from church.\n\nMr. Densham (a Bamptonian): “I suppose he has been annoyed by something that took place on Sunday.”\n\nApplicant: “I have to complain of the regular Sunday transactions. I do not care about taking out a two pence ha'penny summons. A child, on Sunday, was using dirty, filthy language.\n\nMr. Justice Hole: “My dear sir, the Court is at present engaged with other business. I assure you Mr. Floud has been waiting for a long time, and we have promised to hear his case next.”\n\nApplicant (excited): “”Gentlemen of the Bench.....”\n\nClerk: “Sit down!”\n\nApplicant sat down with evident dissatisfaction.\n\nMr. H. Hancock, of Bampton, shopkeeper, was charged by Superintendent Collins with having in his possession a beam and scales which were unjust and incorrect, Fined 11s 7d including costs.\n\nNovember 1865\n\nTwo complaints preferred by P.C. Davis, of Bampton, against James Webber and Thomas Brewer for alleged drunkenness and riotous conduct were dismissed.\n\nCharles Tucker, of Bampton, pleaded guilty to a charge of stealing apples from the orchard of Mr. Robert Elsworthy, of that place, and was fined 9s, inclusive of costs.\n\nDecember 1865\n\nThe old established Bampton market was held on Wednesday last the 29th ult., when the show of stock was rather below the usual average, although a fair supply. The powers-that-be tried to stop the market, but not taking steps before, they could not give the fourteen days notice. Good two to two and a half year old steers sold from £8 to £11. Cows and calves were scarce and very dear. Yolk wool sold at 1s 4d., and washed at 1s 9d per lb., but not much business was done.\n\nYear: 1866\n\nJanuary 1866\n\nAn amateur concert for the benefit of the Church Choir will be given at the Infant School Room, Bampton on Wednesday the 31st January inst. To prevent confusion the tickets for the Reserved Seats will bear numbers corresponding with those on chairs.\n\nFive Guineas Reward! Whereas some evil disposed person or persons have of late maliciously trespassed on the farm of Higher Bowbierhill, Bampton, and on one occasion destroying a wagon by running it over a precipice, on another breaking the windows of a windmill, and on Saturday evening breaking open the poultry house and stealing certain ducks, the above reward will be given to any persons who shall afford such information as may lead to the apprehension of the offenders, by Mr. Richard Branscombe, occupier of the said farm.\n\nMarch 1866\n\nThomas Miles, beer-house keeper, Bampton, appeared in answer to a summons charging him with removing cattle for the distance of a mile and a half at Bampton without a certificate. Defendant admitted the charge. Bench would deal leniently with him, and fined him 1s and costs, 12s.\n\nDefendant on leaving the box became quite insulting, and told the Bench “that was the way they picked his pocket,” but the Chairman humorously passed it off, remarking that if he could get better men he should put them in their place to do their duty.\n\nAn amateur concert under the management of Mr. Staddon, jun., of which the proceeds will be appropriated to some charitable purpose not yet quite decided on, will shortly be announced in this town.\n\nApril 1866\n\nJane Cappell, married woman of Bampton, was charged by Edmund Hancock, with assaulting him. Complainant deposed that on Tuesday last he went to the husband of defendant for a wheelbarrow which defendant borrowed from him. While he was wheeling the barrow out of the yard defendant took up a bind and beat him about the head; he took it away from her, and she got a broomstick and beat that about his head. He took it away from her, she then got a horsewhip, then a walking stick, and then another broom, with all of which she beat him about the head, and her husband looked on and cried the while - “Let the b---- have it! Let him have it, Jane, about the head or anywhere!” (laughter) They got the barrow away from him and kept it. Fined 10s including costs, and gave her a month to pay it. The Worships advised her to give up the barrow quietly, as complainant could legally claim it.\n\nJune 1866\n\nHenry Oaten, butcher, of Bampton, was summoned by Supt. Collings for having an unjust weight in his possession. Defendant said the weight was an old one he used for keeping open the door. Mr. Collings said he found the weight in question on a butcher's block in the shop with others. He turned around and suddenly missed the weight from the board. No person had left the room, and afterwards he discovered it placed in the window under a basin. Defendant said he never sold an ounce by it in his life, it being one that was left in the house before occupied by him. Fined 20s including costs.\n\nJuly 1866\n\nOn Saturday week last, John Catford, aged 39, a saddler, of Bampton, in the employ of Biddlecombe, harness-maker of Bridport, was taken into custody and lodged in the lock-up for robbing his master. On the Monday morning following he was seen in his cell, but on visiting him again at six o'clock he was found quite dead, having hanged himself with his handkerchief at the bar of the window of his cell.\n\nThe Sunday School Treat was kindly given by the Rev. E.E.P. Legge, curate of Bampton church, to the children, to the number of sixty, yesterday 21st. The Rev. E. Rendell, Miss Rendell and others, with the teachers, attended to them. There was a good supply of tea and cake, after which there was running and jumping for small sums of money until eight o'clock, when all left highly delighted with the afternoon's amusement.\n\nAugust 1866\n\nThe Court Huntsham held their annual dinner at the Tiverton hotel on Friday last. About fifty sat down to a bountiful spread provided with Host Trickey's usual ability. J.A.W. Troyte, Esq presided, the vice-chair being filled by the respected Secretary (Mr. H.J. Snell); there were also present H. Edwards, Esq., R. Densham Esq., J.T. Periam Esq., R. Branscombe, R.G. Oxenham, P.C.R., Mr. Periam, jun., Trapnell (3), Bowden (3), W. Hill, W. Escott, C.R., W. Crudge, E. Hobbs, S. Burrow, S.C.R., W. Trickey, Curtis P.C.R., H. Langdon P.C.R., Davey, J. Cottrell, E. Hancock, Jordan, Thorne, W. Morrish (Oakford), Salisbury, T. Parkhouse, Wm. Warren, D. Cruwys, T. Cox, G. Burton, H. Clarke (Tiverton), Bryant, Fox, Luxton, and c.\n\nSeptember 1866\n\nWilliam Webber, labourer, of Bampton, was summoned for being drunk and riotous in the town, on Sunday the 26th ultimo. Sergeant Stone stated that he was in Fore Street about half past twelve on Sunday morning, the 26th., and saw the defendant coming up the street rambling drunk, and using most disgraceful language. After he had seen him home, he went out again in the same drunken state.\n\nFined 9s 6d including costs.\n\nOctober 1866\n\nWilliam Copp, a queer looking fellow, half sailor, half clown, was brought up for being drunk and riotous at Bampton on Saturday night last, pleading guilty. He was sent to prison for seven days with hard labour.\n\nNovember 1866\n\nTo Silly Sally, Bampton: - I can easily remove the blotches from your face if you will consent to follow my directions. I strongly suspect your disease is caused by errors in diet and high living. Is it possible that you consider “hot gin-and-water” an indispensable nightly beverage for a young lady?\n\nYear: 1867\n\nJanuary 1867\n\nOn Friday last a pigeon match was held in a field near the town, when the following competed for sweepstakes: - J.H. Snell, J. Pearse, R. Bowden, T. Trapnell, H. Bickley, and J. Farrier. The first sweepstake was won by Mr. Pearse, killing every bird. The second won by Mr. Trapnell. The third and last was a spirited contest between Snell, Pearse, and Trapnell, each killing all their birds. The stakes were divided between them.\n\nMarch 1867\n\nDeath comes to us poor mortals in many dreadful ways – to be alone, helpless, no eye to pity,\n\nnor hand to help, no ear to catch the groan of distress, is one of them. Mr. Robert Hawkins, who died on Saturday, was a bachelor; he lived alone for years – why? Cannot here be said; some woman no doubt, dead or alive, could answer it. His neighbours having missed him for two whole days, this bitter weather, began to get concerned about him, and at last forced the door of his cottage to see what had become of him. There they found the helpless man, death-struck – all pity and help coming too late. Dr. Edwards was sent for, and proper attendance given the dying man, but all was insufficient to relax the grasp of the cold hand which had seized him in his solitude, and a few hours left him a corpse.\n\nApril 1867\n\nGeorge Hawkins and George Cornwall, of Bampton, were charged by William Warren with trespassing on the preserves of John Collins, Esq., in search of conies. Both defendants pleaded guilty and the former was fined £1, and the latter 10s., inclusive of costs.\n\nMay 1867\n\nGeorge Greenslade, baker, of Bampton, was summoned for selling bread there on May 2nd, otherwise than by weight. P.C. Mogford said he went to defendant's shop, and asked for a loaf of bread. Defendant's wife asked what loaf, and he said a 4lb one. She let him have one, but did not weigh it, or offer to do so. She said she had not got a 4lb batch loaf, but let him have the round one now produced. He paid7½d for it, and found it nearly half a pound short. The Chairman addressing the defendant said there was no doubt as to the bread being short weight, but the bench were disposed to deal leniently with him, as it was the first case brought before them. He was therefore fined £1, including costs, or fourteen days in prison. Defendant for some time tried to get out of paying; but being still more reluctant to go to prison, he paid the cash through a friend.\n\nJuly 1867\n\nJames Webber was summoned for being drunk and disorderly at Fore Street, Bampton, on July 14th. Constable Mogford proved the case, and the defendant was fined 5s including costs.\n\nAugust 1867\n\nAt a meeting of the ratepayers of the Bampton district, held at the parish rooms on Friday, it was unanimously resolved to adopt the Local Government Act, 1858, in the district, the limits of which have been defined by a Government Inspector. It was stated that the rateable value of the district was £1500.\n\nYear: 1868\n\nJanuary 1868\n\nOn the 28th ult., a well dressed man strolled into the Black Horse at Bampton, and intimated his attention of remaining there for a day or two. He had with him a carpet bag which, we are told, was very respectable in appearance. The stranger remained there until the Wednesday following, and during his stay did not forget to order the best that the house of mine host would afford. The gentlemanly looking man departed on peace from Bampton on Wednesday, leaving at the inn his carpet-bag, which, on being opened, was found to contain two knobs of coal! Was he a Fenian?\n\nFebruary 1868\n\nThomas Wensleigh, shoemaker, Bampton, who did not appear, was summoned by Mary Escott. She said she was a single woman living at Bampton; on January 22nd she was delivered of a female child; Thomas Wensleigh was the father; he kept company with her for three years. Dinah Jutson, wife of Joseph Jutson, knew the parties. In June last the defendant came to her and asked if she thought it was true that Mary Escott was in the family way. She said it was so, and advised him to marry her. He said he knew it was his child. Order for all expenses and 2s a week.\n\nMarch 1868\n\nAt Bampton, a temperance meeting was held on Friday in the Bible Christian Chapel, Rev. J. Bendle resident minister, in the chair. After singing and prayer several signed the pledge. Mr. H. Philips, in a very efficient manner, presided at the harmonium. The temperance cause is flourishing in the town, during the last three months more than one hundred have signed the pledge.\n\nMay 1868\n\nOn Thursday a youth in the employ of Mrs. Chave, Zeal Farm, was working in the copse assisting in drawing trees, when one of them fell on him and broke his leg. Mr. Edwards promptly attended and set the bone. The poor fellow is progressing satisfactorily. Last year the same youth was caught in a machine and broke the other leg, from which he has scarcely recovered.\n\nOn Wednesday our much respected sergeant of police, Mr. Stone, was seized with a fit. Mr. Edwards promptly attended, and had him removed to bed. He was for some time in a very precarious state, but hopes are now entertained of his recovery. The loss of his wife has been a great trouble to him, as he was left with three children, the youngest but a few months old.\n\nJune 1868\n\nJane Cottrell was summoned for beating and assaulting Mary Parish at Bampton on June 12th. Both are married women and neighbours. According to the complainant's story the skirmish commenced by defendant assaulting and calling complainant's daughter foul names. She told the defendant she ought to know better, and then she took up a pint cup and threw at her, which knocked her in the head and stunned her. Defendant then threw a stone at her and knocked her in the leg, and broke a large basin which her daughter had in her hand. Charlotte Tidball, daughter of the last witness, corroborated her mother's statement. After a long story on both sides, and the calling each other liars, which the chairman had great trouble to stop, the defendant was fined 13s, including costs.\n\nJuly 1868\n\nThe great Market in lieu of the fair was held on Wednesday, and was miserably attended. This is to be attributed to the great drought. There were about 300 sheep penned, and the fat sheep sold well, but the sale of the others w"
