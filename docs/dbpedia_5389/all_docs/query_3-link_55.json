        "text": "Recreational Activities in Ludham\n\nA Ludham Football Team\n\nThis chapter is introduced by Beulah Gowing. Much of this was transcribed from recordings made a few years ago, as a result of general discussion about leisure activities in the village.\n\nThe village hall and recreation ground was built in 1926 for leisure use by public subscription, and is much used and appreciated. The large hall and raised stage has an adjoining billiard room, I donât think the word snooker was ever used in the early days.\n\nThe Kingâs Arms auction bill mentioned the established bowling green in the public house sale dated 1831, and was in much demand. There was also a billiard table at the Kingâs Arms. A second green was laid just before the 1939 war but it was not used enough to cover the expenses. Lockers were provided in an open front pavilion, canes for measurement and a rotary pump for watering. War took many enthusiasts from the village and chickens and rabbits occupied the well kept greens. There were many other greens in the area, mostly belonging to private houses. Latchmoor was a square area taken from the field and belonged to farmer Charles Green of Beech Farm and mostly fellow tradesmen used that green. I (Beulah Gowing) delivered beer to their pavilion and to other venues when I was 14. The bowling green at the village hall was laid much later, but, they also had a double tennis court plus football and cricket pitches. Badminton was played within the hall, and table tennis was played in the Church Room and the Sloper Room. Ladies bowls teams formed at the village hall after the war.\n\nThere were small oak tables at the Kingâs Arms, made locally by Leonard Bush for the older card players, who argued their way through each game. The Bakerâs Arms Inn also had a billiard table in a purpose built shed in the back garden. No beer pumps were installed in that public house, every pint was a journey down the cellar steps. The Bakers Arms was late in gaining a licence and had been a farm and lodging house belonging to Garrets.\n\nDarts was popular in the army. Many were puzzled as to how, in their swift chat, the local farm labourers could really count much quicker than the army lads. There was cards, dominoes and shove halfpenny, a board game of skill (or luck) which became illegal during the war. It contravened the Gaming Act and although dice was discouraged, a furtive huddle up a corner often meant otherwise. The Dog Inn no doubt had its own teams of sports men, such as fishing matches, being very popular with men from the Yorkshire area.\n\nSailing and rowing regattas were often seen. Boys learned to swim in the manor pond before venturing down to the main river. Ice skating took place nearly every season, from Ludham to Yarmouth perhaps.\n\nSo, we had bowling, swimming, badminton, tennis, table tennis, billiards, cricket, football, board games, cards, dominoes, shove halfpenny, darts, and more recently, croquet at Folly House. Older inns had skittle alleys and quoits. There was always something going on to keep you occupied.\n\nBeulah Gowing\n\nThe For-Get-Me-Not Club\n\nThe Ludham For-Get-Me-Not Club is a club for senior citizens. It was started by Mrs Waldron, and runs from February to the middle of December and meets once a fortnight in the Church Room.\n\nWhen Mrs Waldron retired Mrs Flo Anderson who worked in the shop at Ludham Bridge asked if Mrs Paul would see to the running of the For-Get-Me-Not Club otherwise it would close down. Mrs Paul who had not long been at Ludham Bridge, was enthusiastic but knew her time was limited as she was a very busy lady. She was persuaded that it would not be an onerous job to do, just to collect the sixpences each week from the members!\n\nThe club was much smaller then and most of the members were really old. Nurse Attoe was a competent treasurer and Mrs Paul had very good helpers, Marjorie Sheldrake, in particular, who helped with her wonderful cake stalls at all the sales. Mrs Hill and Mrs Sayer were also very helpful ladies.\n\nAt Christmas a turkey was cooked at home and taken down to the church room with all the trimmings and afterwards they had an evening party with games. Mrs Paulâs husband, Ken, was good at organising and they had a lot of fun.\n\nThe usual afternoon activity for the club was playing bingo for small prizes with various other competitions as well. A lovely tea was provided by all the helpers. In the summer the club went to Ludham Bridge and had tea in the garden. One or two venturesome ones went out in a boat. They had outings to Gorleston where they ate wonderful fish and chips and went to shows on Yarmouth pier. Mrs Paul stated â I found this a big responsibility, I was nervous of losing someone!â Mrs Paul also said â I really enjoyed it and carried on running the club until Mrs Alexander came along. She had experience of running a big club before she came to Ludham and I could see she was the ideal one to hand over toâ.\n\nBingo is still played today for approximately 45 minutes followed by tea, consisting of sandwiches and cakes provided very generously by a team of willing helpers who are also club members.\n\nTo help raise money they hold jumble sales in the spring and autumn, a strawberry tea in the summer and a Christmas bazaar in late November.\n\nThey still go on outings, usually 3 times a year, which can be to a garden centre, a variety show or a boat trip. To extend the Christmas festivities they now go out for a post Christmas lunch during the first week of January.\n\nThe Wives Group\n\nThe aim of the wives group has always been to support other worthy charities. The group was started as the âYoung Wives Groupâ by Mrs Searle and Mrs Sloper.\n\nIn 1977 there were 34 members with 11 visitors during the year. In those days membership was 25p with weekly subs of 15p, visitors 20p. The first Jumble sale made Â£56.93 in 1977 and the Charity for that year received Â£25. President Mrs Gregory with the help of her husband Alan and The Young Wives Group started up the Fun Run in 1982. The sum recorded is Â£217.72 made by this event and was donated to Ludham Village Hall. In1983 it raised Â£411.69 with a donation of Â£200 to the Parish Seat, in 1984 it raised Â£516.90 with Â£311 going to the Play Area and in 1985 it raised Â£607.74 , given to Norfolk Accident rescue.\n\nAs this yearly event was getting too big for Wives to handle it eventually passed to the Ludham Parish Council. Also, as the membership of the group got older it was decided to rename it âWives Groupâ as it still is today. All age groups are however very welcome.\n\nThe Wives always meet fortnightly on a Thursday in the Sloper Room at 8pm when they have speakers from many walks of life. They also have outings to a variety of local places. They work to raise money for charity through jumble sales, bring and buy, raffles and a annual wayside stall on Bakerâs Green.\n\nThey financed the making of the Mardle Seat and its continued upkeep and into the twenty first century saw them volunteer to help at the New Year Fireworks Display for the village.\n\nAn Extract From The Parish Newsletter - 1984\n\nSome of the charities âThe Wivesâ have supported are:\n\nAir Ambulance Â£444.00 Hearing Dogs Â£200.00 Louise Hamilton Â£100.00\n\nChapel Toilet 61.66 Caister Lifeboat Â£300.00 Isunami Dis Â£100.00\n\nSt. Matthews Â£300.00 Charter Fair Â£300.00 Breast Cancer Â£300.00\n\nCrossroads Â£200.00 Quideham Â£250.00 Macmillan Â£250.00\n\nHelp For Heroes Â£600.00 Sailing for Disabled Â£600.00 Mrs Khambata Â£25.00\n\nNelson Journey Â£600.00 Homeless Â£600.00 School Â£500.00\n\nMethodist Chapel Â£300.00\n\nIn 1988 a cheque for Â£1000 was presented by Graham Smith, an organiser of the Ludham Fun Run, to Dr Bob Jarvis, of Ludham Surgery. The money raised was to be used for an electrically-operated couch for the surgery. Thanks were extended to the Ludham Wives Group and all the helpers, competitors and sponsors.\n\nLeft to right:\n\nElspeth McCambley, Rita Lumley, Janet Smith, Dr Bob Jarvis,\n\nGraham Smith, Betty Holand, Doreen Lloyd, Dorothy Xxxx\n\nThe seat at the top of Horsefen Road, was made by Mike Fuller and has the inscription \"Sit you down and mardle\". The money was raised by a mini marathon fun run organised by Sheila Gregory and the Ludham Wives Group. The seat was presented to Ludham Parish Council on 25th March, 1984.\n\nIn 1987, Â£200 was raised for the Big C Appeal. Members of the Ludham Wives Group and visitors met at the home of Mrs R. Brown where everyone sat in the garden and enjoyed an American supper.\n\nAmong the guests were Mrs Marlene Stevens and Mrs Ann Barley, representatives from the Big C appeal. A cheque for Â£200 was presented to Mrs Stevens by Mrs Sheila Gregory who said this was the money raised from the Ludham Fun Run. Mrs Stevens expressed her thanks to everyone who had taken part in raising the money for the Big C Appeal. A bring and buy stall made Â£5.\n\nThe president, Mrs C. Mobbs, thanked Mrs Brown for the use of her garden for a most enjoyable evening.\n\nWives Donation To The Laura Jayne Smith Trust In 1989:\n\nThe Ludham Wives Group meeting opened with the presentation of a cheque for Â£200 to Mrs Jane Edmonds on behalf of the Laura Jayne Smith Trust which members agreed was a worthy charity.\n\nLaura Jayne, whose home is in Potter Heigham, is blind, has brain damage and suffers from cerebral palsy. Mrs Edmonds, a leading figure in the appeal for money to help the little girl's parents look after her, thanked Wives Group members for their kindness towards Laura Jayne. This was the group's first meeting after the Easter recess and the vice-president, Mrs Elspeth McCambley, was in the chair. The cheque presentation was followed by a talk and demonstration on the history of puppets. Ted and Stephanie Rowe, of Zodiac Puppets, showed how intricate the little figures are. Their talk fascinated members at this well attended meeting, and Mrs Janet Smith proposed a vote of thanks on behalf of an appreciative audience.\n\nThe Presentation Of Yet Another Cheque for Charitable Purposes - The Date Is Unknown\n\n<Picture> wives 7 and 8\n\nA Typical Meeting In The Latter Stages Of The 20th Century\n\nThe Ludham Mini Marathon Fun Run\n\nMrs Shiela Gregory with her husband, and helped by the Ludham Wives Group, was the instigator of the Ludham Mini Marathon Fun Run in 1982.\n\nOver the years much money for charity was raised through this enjoyable, fun event. The villagers and nearby neighbours were only too willing to take part. Fun was to be had by all. The first lady home was Caroline Mobbs.\n\nIn 1985 about one hundred contestants turned up for the annual Ludham Mini Marathon Fun Run. The event was organised as usual by Sheila Gregory and the Wives group. The Wives stated that nearly Â£800 had been raised for the surgery.\n\nâIt was the best weâve ever raisedâ. The money was to buy one or two radio sets to be used in conjunction with the Norfolk Accident Rescue Service. The winner of the fun run was Mr Tony Barber from Sutton and the first lady home was Mrs Penny Brown. Neil Metcalfe was third picking up the trophy for the under 11âs section. Anthony Lavender and Hayley Forton were winners in the 11 â 16 section. Mr Mike Spanky won the fancy dress with his cavemanâs outfit.\n\nThe fun run in 1986 made Â£793 for the Eastern Daily Press âCherish That Childâ appeal This fund with help from all over the county was close to the establishment and running of a Child Protection Team.\n\nÂ£850 was raised in 1987 in aid of the Toy Library for handicapped children in Norwich. The trophies that day were presented by Mrs Joyce Newham from the centre. Amongst the trophies won, Simon Crawshaw and Peter Durley walked away with the fancy dress trophy as Zulu warriors complete with canoe and spears.\n\nAn enormous Â£1000 was raised in 1988 and went to the benefit of Ludham surgery. This time the money was spent on an electrically operated couch which would be a great asset to the village health care.\n\nYet again there was a good turnout in 1989 with the sun shining brightly on all who took part or came to watch. Many participants wore fancy dress and the magnificent sum of Â£3,700 was raised for the charity âBreakâ. This was a charity giving parents of children with long term congenital conditions, the opportunity of a break. A new cup was introduced by Guy and Tommy Thrower for the first Ludham resident to complete the course. It was won by Anthony Moffat in 28.02 minutes. The fancy dress winners were Barrie Marshall as grandma, Laura and Catherine Cordiner and Nicola Blake as cheer leaders and Katie Mobbs as a fairy.\n\nThe Fun Run bought a piano and play gear in 1990 with 113 people taking part. It raised Â£1458 to be shared between the Ludham First School and the Childrenâs Playground Appeal. Yet another trophy was introduced by the directors of Moores of Stalham â The Airfield Trophy. This was for the first person, home resident or employed, in the three airfield parishes namely Catfield, Ludham and Potter Heigham.\n\nDespite the coldest weather yet with winds and rain hampering contestants 130 people took part in the 10th annual fun run event. Sheila Gregory who had been the instigator of this event was invited to return to present the trophies. Childline was the chosen main charity but also money was used for a commemorative tree and seat for the village.\n\nThe Ludham Fun Run Charities:\n\n1982 Ludham Village Hall\n\n1983 Circular seat for Womack Corner and Grapevine Talking Newspaper for the Blind.\n\n1984 Equipment for the Childrenâs Playground, and Norfolk & Norwich Big âCâ appeal.\n\n1985 Norfolk Accident Rescue Service.\n\n1986 EDP âCherish that Childâ appeal.\n\n1987 Norwich Toy Library for handicapped children.\n\n1988 Ludham Surgery. Multi purpose electrically controlled couch.\n\n1989 âBreakâ Sherringham.\n\n1990 Ludham First School and the Childrenâs Playground appeal.\n\n1991 Commemorative seat and tree for the village and Childline.\n\nThis community spirited village event carried on into the 21st century but unfortunately eventually ceased. Perhaps someone in the future will come forward and be the leading light to get it going agai\n\nThe Judo Club and Wolfgang Bubenzer\n\nHaving run a Judo club for 25 years in London, not long after we came to Ludham someone suggested â why not start one hereâ. Yes why not? I missed it actually. There were a lot of children running around with nothing to do so it would be an ideal thing for them.\n\nFirst of all I went to the Parish Council and I have to say, Billy Sloper was an angel, he was on our side right from the word go. There were a few doubting Henrys there, but Billy Sloper and Arthur Gower, they were the two who really supported my idea of running a Judo Club in Ludham.\n\nIt was going to be in the village hall so the council said that provided we raised the money for the equipment, they would purchase it all and save us paying the VAT. My girlfriend and I went round knocking on every door in Ludham, explaining that we were going to start a Judo Club for the youngsters, and we needed Â£250 for the equipment to get it going, the mats, the canvas, the woods and all the rest of it. When we had got the money together I held the first meeting. By this time word had got round and lots of parents came down with their children, and I said, âIf you want to enrol your boy or girl it will cost you 30p a week. From 6 oâclock to 7.30â. We got at least 30 signed up on the night and I went back to the council with the money and they bought the equipment.\n\nWe started to set up the club, making arrangements to get the judo suits for the children from Manchester. If wasnât long before we had a thriving club called Ludham Broadland Judo Quai. My son did a badge motive and we had one stitched, which could then be sewn onto the front of the jacket, and also Ludham Judo Quai had been printed on the back of their jackets. I managed to persuade my boss at work to donate 50 track suits, all with the club name on the back and the badge on the front, at no charge to the club. So all the children and grownups all looked the same, all had the same suit and all wore the same clothes, all little red devils they were. It was great and we had a really good club.\n\nWe started taking the children away, and, other judo clubs used to come down and join us, staying with the parents of children who did Judo in Ludham. We had the same invitation out to places like Lancashire and Wales, where our children stayed with their parents, did Judo on the Saturday and Sunday morning, then went down to the beach, or we climbed a mountain in Wales and came home again for Sunday night.\n\nThis went on for quite a long time and then they decided to have a committee, and ultimately, that killed off the club. Judo is very autocratic. Whoever is in charge, is absolutely in charge, and in London, for 21 years I was in absolute charge of the club, and no-one, unless he was a higher Dan grade would argue with you. If he was a higher Dan grade, you said yes sir, three bags full sir. Thatâs a typical Japanese attitude. I had had several National Champions in London, and I had 3 youngsters here from Sutton who looked likely to become National Champions as well in their own grade. But the powers that be (the committee members) thought they knew better, so I said âFine, itâs all yoursâ, and I walked out and the club folded about 9 months later.\n\nI must name a few more that helped out. Nicky Brooks, Alan King, Rodney Wright, Nicki Haslem and her brother Cliff, Sarah Firmin and Sarah Perton and quite a few more.\n\nSome came from outside Ludham, but we had about 15 grown ups and about 40 juniors in the club.\n\nThe Ludham Womens Institute Founded In November 1935\n\nBecause of the sheer quantity of research material available for this section, we will once more adopt the technique of doing no more than dipping our toes in the water.\n\nThis section will offer the reader a flavour of what was going on within each of the decades covered by this book.\n\nFirst Committee\n\nPresident: Mrs Cambie (Grandmother of Bishop of Norwich, Maurice Wood)\n\nVice Presidents: Mesdames Goldsmith Brown and Mohan.\n\nCommittee: Mesdames Grimes, Hacon, Riches, Rix, Anderson, Keeler,\n\nEngland and 'Aunty' Bush.\n\nDecided to collect stamps and silver paper for the hospitals.\n\nJuly 1940\n\nCommittee Meeting note - Tea ration discussed and two members, Mesdames Carter and\n\nSayer promised to bring some to make enough to last the year.\n\nNo More Monthly Records Were Kept Until 1944\n\n1944\n\nMrs Ankerstein gave talk about her life in occupied Poland, of the oppression and\n\nher escape to England.\n\nA War Savings Group was started by Miss Goodey.\n\nPlans for 'Salute the Soldier' Week.\n\nVolunteers were asked to knit garments for liberated countries.\n\nIt was decided to start a Market Stall.

Maybe we could get the Village Hall back in use as a theatre. Well, for a few nights every year, anyway.\n\nI had been to a talk given by Herbert Mitchell, the County Drama Organiser. I was interested in his talk and later, I phoned him up and said Iâd got some friends, and that weâd like to start a group, could he advise us? He said, âForm yourselves and then get me to come outâ, so we started.\n\nThe St. Benetâs Players, named after the nearby St. Benetâs Abbey were first formed in June 1974. The inaugural meeting was held in Ludham School and was attended by 14 people and that was just by putting posters in the village. As a result of that, a committee was elected consisting of John Wythes (Chairman), Gill Jackson (Secretary), Stan Gibbs (Treasurer) and John Affleck (Business Manager).\n\nHerbert Mitchell came along and talked to us about licences and performing rights, because if you donât have the licence to perform you could be closed down, then everybody gets disappointed and probably fined as well, so itâs not worth trying to avoid it. We do try, both then and now, to write our own material which allows us to be a bit freer with costs and things like that.\n\nThe Artistic Director for the first production was Muriel Affleck. Mr and Mrs Underwood kindly lent their Barn at Albury House for a coffee evening to help raise funds for the group, and the âPlayersâ also had a wayside stall and a jumble sale during that summer to help with the funds needed for the first production, a comedy called âWith Vacant Possessionâ written by Wilfred Massey. It was a sell out on the first night with standing room only for late comers.\n\nThe comedy was about two families renting the same house. The press claimed that the outstanding performances in the cast of ten (some of whom had never acted before) were Lynn Freeman and Joan Wyths who stepped in at the last minute. The producer, Muriel Affleck, was also congratulated by the press âfor getting so much out of the cast who had so much raw talent that had to be shaped into its first real performanceâ.\n\nMembership of the group spiralled in the months following the inauguration, with membership coming not only from Ludham, but also Horning, Stalham, Sea Palling and elsewhere. They also had hopes of perhaps putting on a serious drama such as an Agatha Christie.\n\nThey then ventured into the realms of a musical with âLetâs all Go on the Broadsâ, again written by Mu Affleck. As well as the players it included âThe Dancing for Pleasureâ group and members of the âStalham Choral Societyâ directed by CHE Moggs.\n\nOther Notable Productions:\n\nOctober 1974 With Vacant Possession\n\nJanuary 1975 The Other Cinderella\n\nOctober 1975 Murder At The Vicarage\n\nSeptember 1976 Fish Out Of Water\n\nJune 1977 Blithe Spirit\n\nDecember 1977 Wild Goose Chase\n\nMarch 1978 Mystery At Blackwater\n\nJuly 1978 Reluctant Debutants\n\nJanuary 1979 Last Voyage of the SS Randoon\n\nMay 1979 Cat on the Fiddle\n\nDecember 1979 Snow White\n\nMarch 1980 Thriller of the Year\n\nJuly 1980 No Time for Fig Leaves\n\nDecember 1980 Sleeping Beauty\n\nThe cast of\n\nâLast Voyage of the SS Randoonâ\n\nClubs, Associations and Activities For Young People\n\nYvonne Boldy recalled what the youngsters used to do to entertain themselves.\n\nIn times gone by school outings were very rare, only London once on a coach, not to the seaside or anything. We went out more with the Sunday School. I loved the Sunday school. The Church room was packed with children and there were about four or five teachers. My teacher was Peggy Lumbard who lived near Ludham Bridge, she was very good. There were no after school activities, we used to go and play at Womack in and out of the brick kilns, and we used to go for walks, it was so safe for us to walk round Ludham. We used to do a lot of bird nesting, which seems awful now, but everyone did it then and I used to play in the brass band too.We never went on the river, but I did a lot of fishing with my dad at Little Holland and at Hunters boatyard. We never ate them, but we did have relations living on the coast at Eccles and Sea Palling, and my dad used to do a lot of sea fishing with my brother, cousins and uncles.We didnât have Guides or Brownies, but we did have the Girls Friendly Society (or on bad nights it was the Girls Fighting Society!) run by Mrs Anderson.\n\nThe Girls Friendly Societyâ was officially established in England on 1st January 1875 by Mary Elizabeth Townsend, an Irish clergymanâs daughter married to the wealthy Frederick Townsend. She once wrote âIf the power of rescue work will be so increased by organisation, why should no work be organised to save from falling?â In modern terminology, from its inception GFS was concerned with prevention.â\n\nYvonne Boldy continues: âOne year my name was pulled out of a hat and I was sent on a holiday to the Isle of Wight for a week and I went with Margaret Woods. She was homesick and they wanted me to go home with her, but I wouldnât be persuaded so I stayed and she had to have someone sent home with her. It was a lot of fun. Mrs Anderson took us on the train and across London to hand us over at Southampton to a lady who took us on the ferry to the Isle of Wight.Mrs Anderson got cross with me for putting my head out of the train window and because it was a steam train I got smuts all over my face. I remember her damping her handkerchief with spit to wipe it over my face. You could never do that today, and of course the smuts didnât come off. It was the first time I had been on a train. It was wonderful, I was very lucky to win it. Other girls went on other years. She was a wonderful lady, Mrs Anderson.The Girls Friendly Society (GFS) did things like knitting and sewing and drawing which I loved. We played games too, a bit like the Guides and Brownies are today, but no camping. It was held in the Church Rooms on a Monday evening for about an hour and a half. I have two certificates in my possession in the original frames, but you can barely read them now.There was no Boys Friendly Society, the boys used to just play football. We did a lot of plays at the school and the lady at the Manor, Mrs Brookes, who was at one time Mrs Armytage had us there and we had plays and dressing up, very family orientated and everybody took part in it.\n\nHelen Watson has said that when she was about 8 years old there were no guides in the village so she joined The Girls Friendly Society which had been established in 1875. It was a registered charity working to support girls and young women in England and Wales then later she joined the Young Peoples Union which was a religious Youth Club for boys and girls.\n\nIn the late 40âs there was a Youth Club started up in the Sloper Room on Tuesday evenings and in the village hall on Friday evenings. A young lady called Carol Willoughby was one of the table tennis players! There used to be country music, table tennis and snooker available and a record player which was somewhat noisy according to Billy Wight. It was where he did all his courting!\n\nKathleen Sloper commented that:\n\nâOne thing was wonderful - the vicar used to come in every Friday night. He was always interested in what the youngsters were doing and also, in their education. That was the Reverend Fred Smith. He used to come in with his big black Homburg hat and one of the boys used to get hold of it and they used to be inclined to hide it from him. He was so interested in the youngsters and I did admire him for coming in every Friday eveningâ\n\nCarol Willoughby has stated that âAt a later date, after we had the Youth Club, we also used to go down to the Vicarage on a Sunday evening and used his study as a meeting place, it use to keep us off the road and thingsâ\n\nJoyce Birch said: âWe had Brownies in Ludham â in the Church Room. Mrs Pegg ran the Guides and Brownies and I remember the uniform I used to wear â brown uniform with a straw hat in the summer. I never joined the Guides because I had to go to Fleggburgh â that was a wasted time for usâ\n\nGirl Guiding U.K. - Winnie Baker\n\nâGuiding in Ludham was started by Mary Hayes who lived in âDormersâ on Norwich Road in Ludham. Di Stagg and I told Mary that we had both been Guides, and she said âWhy donât you come along and help?\n\nSo we went along on Monday, the meeting night, and from 27th October 1971 we became assistant Guiders. Ludham guide Deborah Taylor won the movements highest award, the Queenâs Guide Certificate and the village hall was packed to capacity for the presentation. Guide leader Mrs Mary Hayes paid tribute to Deborahâs hard work, the way she had wholeheartedly supported functions in which the company had taken part and her service to others. Deborah then cut a special cake in the shape of the Trefoil Badge and decorated by assistant guider Winnie Baker.Di eventually moved and Mary retired, so I took over running the guides. At one point we had over 46 guides. As this was too many for one company Judi Gardiner opened another unit, this was called St Benetâs Guides. Sadly after a few years there was a decline in membership and the unit closed.\n\nOver the years we have camped, youth hosteled and have been abroad to Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.\n\nBrownies also started on the 27th October 1971 and Mrs Harriman ran the unit. They met on a Monday night and had a full unit. However after a number of years there were no girls of 7 years of age so the unit closed and the remaining Brownies joined Potter Heigham Brownies and to this day any girls leaving Rainbows go straight to Potter Heigham.\n\nRainbows opened on 3rd March 1998. Mrs J Dunnett is the Guider with Mrs J Jox as assistant Guider. These young ones meet in the Church Room on a Wednesday night. At the start there were 15 Rainbows but as with Guides and Brownies the numbers have gone down. It seems there are no girls of Rainbow age in the village.â\n\nProblems With The Boys Club\n\nOn May 8th 1981 there was an unusual event staged by the boys of the village, it was a plea to 'Save Our Club'.\n\nPlacard bearing members of Ludham Boys Club staged a silent demonstration outside the Church hall. As councillors arrived for the annual parish meeting, they were met by the protesting banner waving party of boys.\n\nThe boys were demonstrating against the decision of Ludham First School head mistress, Mrs G. Carter to refuse the Boys Club permission to meet at the school on Friday nights. The banners they held carried a blunt message to the councillors; \"Carter killed our club - will you bury it?\"\n\nInside the meeting one of the Boys Club leaders, Mr David Syrett said that the club had been unable to meet for 6 weeks since being told that they could no longer meet at the school on Friday nights. Also, the alternate night they had been offered, Thursday, was impossible because the 45 six to twelve year olds went to bed too late to be ready for school the next day.\n\nThose hundred or so people who packed the hall voted overwhelmingly in favour of a motion put by Mr Syrett that the parish council should support the view and make representations to the education authority that village schools be community schools and used to their full potential.\n\nThe problem seemed to be that the Education Committee would not authorise the payment of cleaners after the Boys Club had finished on a Friday night.\n\nThe Womack Herons\n\nThe Womack Herons is a club for people who enjoy boating and meeting socially, and give each other help and advice.\n\nThe group was formed in the 1980âs by Wolf and Rita Bubenza, and Alan and Sheila Gregory. They put notes on boats on the staithe to see if anybody was interested in going to an inaugural meeting at the Cringles Country Club in Potter Heigham. About 30 people turned up and the Womack Herons Club was born. The name was agreed upon, and designs for a logo were also put forward and decided on.\n\n<Picture> herons 2\n\nThe Womack Herons meet once or twice a month throughout the year. Regular events include the Launching Supper when they celebrate the end of winter and the return of the boats to the water, and the Laying Up Supper when their boats are put to bed for the winter.\n\nHerons is a social club and as well as boating events they have lots of other activities and outings. In the summer they organise regular cruises to different Broads locations. This might be for a barbecue, or a pub lunch or picnic, or even a game of rounders. All the meetings are informal fun events, and sometimes there is a quiz, or a treasure hunt or photographic competition. Annual membership is a small number of Â£âs per year and contact details can always be found in the Parish News.\n\nA personal account written by Wolf Bubenza can be found at the end of this section.\n\nEvery autumn, the Herons compete for the coveted Stan Coles Trophy. It might be a quiz, a treasure hunt or some other activity. There is always a twist to the competition and it has provided lots of entertainment over the years.\n\nAnyone who is interested in social boating on the Norfolk Broads is welcome to join, you don't need to own a boat to be a member.\n\nMany of the meetings take place at riverside locations and some people travel there by boat while others go by car. There are always opportunities to get a lift on one of the boats going to a meeting.\n\nThe Memories of Wolf Bubenza:\n\nHaving eventually got a Parish Mooring, I saw all those boats tied up on the Parish Moorings but no one spoke to anybody along there, they passed each other but never said hello or anything. I thought well, this is silly. If people were going on your boat and fishing off the front of your boat they would make a mess by leaving bread and ground bait and maggots crawling everywhere, so I turned a couple of them off. I thought to myself I had to do something about this so I spoke to Alan Gregory, he had his boat next to mine. I said to him what if we form a club down here. He said âGood ideaâ and volunteered to become the Vice Chairman and his wife volunteered to become secretary and a meeting was going to be held at Potter Heigham (Cringles). Anyway, so they were the first 2, then there was Tommy Knox and his wife, his boat was 2 boats further down, I had a chat with him as well and it wasnât long before all 15 boats in the north and south dyke all joined up and became members of Womack Herons.\n\nWe designed a little flag, a blue one which they still have today I believe, and we also put planking down on the ground behind the boats so when we walked down to the boats we didnât pick up all the cut grass or the mud when we went on our boats. We laid planking all the way down to the South Dyke. We were negotiating with the council to put a water tap down there or even put a water tap on every boat but they wouldnât wear that, it was too complicated. By this time we used to do outings. The principle idea was that if someone went out and broke down he could phone in and one of us with a bigger boat would go out and tow him in.\n\nLudham Ladies Handicraft Guild\n\nAutograph hunters meet Anglia Television personality Christine Webber at a summer sale organised by Ludham LadesâHandicraft Guild.\n\nThe event raised Â£600 for the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association and the Lockwood Donkey Santuary at Wormley in Surrey.\n\nThe Ludham Branch of the Workersâ Educational Association (W.E.A.) was founded in 1903. It is a charity dedicated to bringing high-quality, professional education into the heart of a community. With the support of nearly 3,000 volunteers, 2,000 tutors and over 10,000 members, they deliver friendly, accessible and enjoyable courses for adults from all walks of life.\n\nThe WEA also has a special mission to raise aspirations and develop educational opportunities for the most disadvantaged. This includes providing basic maths, English and IT skills for employment; courses to improve health and wellbeing; creative programmes to broaden horizons and community engagement activities that encourage active citizenship.\n\nLudham Branch: Workerâs Educational Association - 1964/5 report by Phyllis Goodey\n\nThe local branch of the W.E.A. was transferred from Potter Heigham in 1960.\n\nThe group meets in the school weekly during the winter terms, with a coffee evening reunion before the beginning of the winter season. A pleasant interlude occurs during each meeting when coffee, made by Mrs Bird, is served with biscuits. This usually provides an opportunity to begin the very useful informal discussion which is an important part of every lecture.\n\nA wide variety of topics have been studied, from Archeology to Mass media, from Music to Biology. During the winter of 1964/65 the first subject was the âBackground to the New Testamentâ with Miss Thicknesse, who knew her subject well, and made the Bible characters and the ordinary man really come alive and encouraged us all to do some quite deep reading around the subject. Then followed a second course on Art with Mr. Hamilton Wood. An interesting evening occurred when twenty members visited Norwich Castle Museum to study the paintings exhibited in the Contemporary Art Exhibition under Mr Hamilton Woodâs guidance. However some members did not feel they could appreciate fully some of the paintings, although all felt that they had been helped considerably towards some understanding of Modern Art.\n\nDuring 1964/65 the membership was 31 and among us were an artist, a farmer, a doctor, a solicitor some teachers and even some students.\n\nThe group is hoping for courses on Anthropology and Norfolk Natural History during the season of 1965/66 and members are keen to resume attendance at these most enjoyable and instructive evenings.\n\nPhyllis Goodey\n\nA comprehensive survey of Ludham village was compiled by the Ludham Branch of the W.E.A. group in 1980 following a course on Industrial archeology.\n\nThe group members were:\n\nL. Carter M. Hayes D. Sayer J. Clarke S. Hayton\n\nJ. Sayer C. England M. Keeler M. Walton P. Goodey\n\nN. Legg B. Winwood B. Gowing J. Mchennan J. Young\n\nD. Hayes O. Mason P. Young\n\nThe full survey can be found on the Ludham Community Archive Website. To see the report follow this link\n\nThe Ludham Society\n\nTaken from the Ludham Village Directory 1984:\n\nThe Ludham Society came into being in 1978 at a time when there was dispute over the right of way at How Hill for public access to the staithe.\n\nThe Ludham Society held a picnic on the staithe to support the right of way issue and worked with the parish council and the Ramblers Association to fight for it to stay open. The society with Martin Walton as chairman, evolved into a society for the protection of rights of way and amenities in Ludham. They helped protect hedgerows and roadside verges as well as actively taking part in tree planting schemes for the village. They also kept a eye on buildings within the village, especially those that were listed or had specific covenants. The group was affiliated to the CPRE and the Ramblers Association. They held monthly footpath and bridleway walks covering all the paths around the village in order to keep them open. They had a tree nursery in the Manor grounds which helped them provide and plant about 200 trees in and around Ludham until the task was eventually taken over by the County Council. They were responsible for the introduction of the school wild garden so that the children would develop an awareness of nature in a safe environment.\n\nGradually the society introduced talks on the countryside, planning, architecture and local history so that the members were well informed. There had been issues with local farmers and the start of an annual farm walk was a way to understand the working life of the farm and farming legislation.\n\nAs a village, we owe much to the members of Ludham Society, for they gave us our tree lined roads and kept many footpaths open for us to enjoy.\n\nThe Playgroup and The Mother and Toddler Group\n\nAgain, taken from the Ludham Village Directory in 1984, there were facilities for the young in the village as can be seen from these cuttings.\n\nROYAL BRITISH LEGION - LUDHAM BRANCH\n\nIt is known that the Ludham Branch of the British Legion was formed in 1944-5 from the local Catfield and District Branch.\n\nThe joining fee in, 1944, was 1/- (5p) rising to 3/-(15p) per year. The numbers for 1944-5 were 45 members and it increased to 102 by 1946-7, after men had returned from the war; later it rose to the all time high of 124 on the register and stayed that way until around the late 1970âs when it started to fall to 35-40 members at the turn of the century.\n\nThe Ludham Branch also ran the house to house Poppy Appeal until there were no members to do the collections. The complete grounds of How Hill would be open at least one Sunday per year when the entrance fee would be donated to Ludham branch funds.\n\nLater there were also xmas parcels delivered to the older members or their dependants. Nowadays every penny has to be agreed by head office before spending. By June 2006 there were not enough members to run it so it was closed.\n\nThe Cricket Team\n\nA Pre War Team\n\nFootball In The Village\n\nThere were many football teams and leagues in the area through the century, but there is relatively little reference information to pass on to the reader.\n\nAn early team, the names and the date are uncertain\n\nWinners in 1937 - 38\n\nBilly Wright played football for many years in Ludham, mostly as centre half.\n\nWhen asked if they had any successes he declared:\n\nâWe won the Norwich and District League, the North East Village League, the Pierce Cup, and the Broadland Cup. Iâve still got all the cups and medals that go with it. I also ran the tennis club, and played tennis and badminton. I played cricket for a couple of years but unfortunately, the cricket folded and was never taken on again.â\n\nWinners in 1947 - 48\n\nJohn Youngs played for a Ludham football team\n\nâWe were, at that time I think, playing in various leagues in the Norwich and District football, also we played in the first division Norwich and we played Gothics Norwich Defiance. We played in quite a good league then. Joyceâs dad used to run the line and we used to pick the team in The Bakerâs Arms. We did that for several years. Old Harry Warren used to go down the cellar and get us a pint âout of timeâ. There were Ron Belson, Billy Chapmanâ Gordon Barber, Billy (Slug) Bensley, Ray Osbourne, Michael Goodwin and myself . We were a good football team and everyone played for a place in the team. I was captain for several years but you were never sure of your place, you had to earn it.â\n\nWinners in 1959 - 60\n\nThe Bowls Clubs\n\nBowls clubs have been in Ludham village in some form or other since the early 1800âs.\n\nThe Kingâs Arms auction bill mentioned the established bowling green in the public house sale dated 1831, and was in much demand. A second green was laid just before the second world war but it was not used enough to cover the expenses. Lockers were provided in an open front pavilion, canes for measurement and a rotary pump for watering.\n\nA Pre-War Team\n\nEntrance to the Bowling Green at the Kings Arms\n\nWar took many enthusiasts from the village and chickens and rabbits occupied the well kept greens. There were many other greens in the area, mostly belonging to private houses. Latchmoor was a square area taken from the field belonging to farmer Charles Green of Beech Farm and mostly fellow tradesmen used that green. Beulah Gowing delivered beer to their pavilion and to other venues when she was 14.\n\nThe bowling green at the village hall was laid much later. Ladies bowls teams formed at the village hall after the war.\n\nBowls Team at the Manor early in the 1930âs\n\nShown here (amongst others) in the back row are Mun Grapes, Ted Gibbs, Bob Allard, Fred Thrower, Jack Wright, Albert Warner, G. Pollard, Sydney Amies, Whiskey Wright, Arthur Grapes, Johnny and Freddie Thrower, Vivien Rudrum, Fred Skillern, Billy Barber and Tom Lacey.\n\nIn the front row we see George Lincoln, Herbert Alcock, Kenny Grapes, Harry Dean, Tom Kitchener, Jack Fuler, Jimmy Beevor, George Hayhurst, Col. Worship or Capt. Armytage, and Loney England.\n\nA much later bowls team, showing Steven Bensley, David Mattocks, Laurie Marshall, Marion Gibbs, Howard Wade, Neville Boldy, Rodney Wright with shield, Richard Vepson, Richard Locke, Sonny Probertt, Arthur Browne and Brian Saunders.\n\nArthur Browne moved to Ludham in 1978, having lived in Sutton before that. He met with Arthur Gower the butcher, and got invited to the Bowles Club. Arthur Gower had said:\n\nJust bring a pair of plimsolls and I will sort you out.\n\nâI had Fred Pettitts bowls (Nurse Pettitts father). They were a proper old set of wooden ones. Older bowls were made from Lignum Vitae and very heavy. I had a go. He then told me to look on the butcherâs door and I might be on the team, although Iâd only had that one go. And Iâve played there with Jack Fuller, Mike Fullerâs dad ever since and Iâve really loved it. There were several bowling greenâs within the village at one time. There was a green off Latchmoor, down by the bungalow just past the junction. There was also a green at the back of the Kings Arms. It was much earlier but it was still there when I moved to the pub to cut the grass for Tom Billington. The pub bowling green was where the restaurant is now. It had not been used for a while and when it was measured up, it was long enough in one direction, but not the other. The green at the village hall was originally the Ladies Green. The ladies played at the village hall whilst the men played at Latchmoor and the Kings Arms. The Kings Arms was shut first, and then Latchmoor, and then everyone played at the village hall. It was not an easy transition when we all shared the village hall bowling green. The men paid to have the village hall one expanded, and Richard Locke built the new pavilion but the ladies were not too pleased to be sharing, at least thatâs how it appeared at the time. As from October 1986, the Ladies and Mens Bowls Clubs were amalgamated forming The Ludham Bowls Club. At the formation of this club it was agreed to re turf the green and various activities such as Whist Drives and an Old Time Music Hall were put on in the village hall to help raise the money we needed. The club plays various fixtures such as the Taylor Shield and The Rotary Shield, and have at times played for the Yarmouth League Cups. In April 1992 they had about 58 fixtures for the coming season and membership ran to about 31 members.â\n\nThe Armytage Challenge Cup was presented to the Club by Mrs Armytage who lived at the Manor. She later became Mrs Brook. There are many names on the cup of winners from the past.\n\nAt one stage the cup disappeared but after twenty years it was found in someoneâs loft and once again was used as a challenge cup.\n\nThe inscription on the cup reads:\n\nThe Armytage Challenge Cup\n\nKings Arms\n\nBowls Club\n\nLudham\n\n1934\n\nPast winners are:\n\n1934 H E Miller 1935 W W Gibbs 1936 F Skillern 1937 W A Kemp\n\n1938 S Amis\n\n1949 F Skillern 1950 Kenny Grapes 1951 Kenny Grapes 1952 Kenny Grapes\n\n1997 A Browne 1998 R Sparrow 1999 M Cooper 2000 D Mattocks\n\nAt the time of writing, the cup also shows the following names:\n\n2001 I Walter 2002 T Grapes 2003 I Walter 2004 W Ribbands\n\n2005 M Barker 2006 M Barker 2007 W Brinded 2008 S Probett\n\n2009 S Probett 2010 S Probett 2011 S Wright 2012 M Gibbs\n\n2013 Jill Grapes 2014 S Probett 2015 A Browne 2016 D Mattocks\n\n2017 D Mattocks\n\nThe Darts Team\n\nThe regular darts players at The Kings Arms were Jimmy Cook, Pat Algar, Tony Hurn, Beenie Vout, Harry Warren, Martin Beaumont, Beenies son Danny, Richard Locke, Micky Harvey, Arthur Browne, Jerry Young, landlord Peter Billington, Tony Burton, John Shelby, all Ludham people in 1983.\n\nIn 1984 they won the League and were League Cup Holders.\n\nFor many years they were either winners or runners up, and never came away without a cup. They were in the North Walsham and District League, then in the Wherry League; Garry Timmons being the captain. The only night they had off was Friday night. Rodney Wright ran the Wednesday Night league, and Arthur Browne ran the Monday and Thursday Night local leagues.\n\nKing's Arms Darts players after their 40 hour Â£1000 fundraising marathon.\n\nBack Row: Danny Vout, Pat Algar, Pete Billington, Gerry Hunn.\n\nFront Row: Arthur Browne, Richard Locke, Paul Warren, Garry Timmins.\n\nDarts team wives raise money for the Jenny Lind Ward at The Norfolk and Norwich Hospital\n\nEnid Carter, Tanya Lavender, Elaine lavender, Kathy Hunn Robert Hunn, Raymond Hunn, Christine Cook, Sam Billington, Sarah Billington\n\nLudham King's Arms won the North Norfolk Darts League Inland section and The Knockout Cup - the first time the Double had ever been achieved.\n\nBack row: Arthur Browne, Gerry Hunn, Peter Billington,\n\nA.

It relates to a Snooker 24 hour marathon, as a result of which, Â£250 was raised and donated to the For Get Me Not Club.\n\nIn the photo we see Mr Bigg, Derek Smith, Michael Harvey and Mrs Alexandra\n\nWhen interviewed some years ago, John Youngs said:\n\nâWe are very lucky â the snooker room is used by all the elderly people â they go in there during the day. They enjoy their game of snooker â in fact, there are as many as seven or eight cars out there during the day. They can boil their kettle and have a cup of teaâ"
