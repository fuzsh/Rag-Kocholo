        "text": "Wright Brothers and Short Brothers at Shellbeach, 1909\n\nPytheas of Massalia (born ~350 BC)\n\nIt is not certain that the great geographer Pytheas actually set foot in Kent, because his own records are lost; but it seems highly likely on the available evidence. Originating from the Greek colony of Massallia – modern-day Marseilles – he sailed to the Northern seas in the late C4 BC in search of the legendary Hyperboreans of the far North, and discovered Thule, which could have been as distant an island as Greenland. The Greek geographer Strabo reported three centuries later that Pytheas had perambulated all of Britain that was accessible, and presumably must have circumnavigated Britain too, since he had an idea of its size and knew it was essentially a triangle with corners called Belerion (Cornwall), Orkas (Orkneys), and Kantion (Kent). Since fresh water would have been a continual concern, it is probable that he learned the last name from the Cantii themselves during a necessary landfall on his way round Kent.\n\nJulius Caesar (100 BC-44 BC)\n\nIt is appropriate that the most famous Roman should have been the first true colossus to set eyes on Kent. When he landed in 55 BC, Caesar was already celebrated as the great general Marius’s nephew who’d been captured by pirates but, after being ransomed, returned as promised to crucify them. Now, while engaged in the conquest of Gaul, he turned north. That first landing had value only as reconnaissance; but he came back the next year with a huge army that cut through the resident Celts like butter. After reaching modern-day Hertfordshire, he set up a client king and returned to Gaul. He wrote an account of the local peoples, insightfully remarking that, “By far the most civilised of all these are the ones who inhabit Kent“. His last ten years were taken up by his civil war with Pompey, his affair with Cleopatra, his dictatorship, and his bloody assassination on the floor of the Senate.\n\nClaudius, Emperor of Rome (10 BC-AD 54)\n\nSoon after becoming Imperator in AD 41, Claudius set about expanding the Roman Empire on a number of fronts, the most northerly being Britain. Attracted by the prospect of British mines and Celtic slaves, he sent four legions to undertake the conquest of the island. Once the campaign was going well, he turned up in the late summer of AD 43 to take the credit. His stay, probably commencing at Richborough, lasted just 16 days. Claudius had actually started life in a neighbouring province, Gaul, making him the first Roman emperor born outside of Italy. His various physical afflictions had long kept him out of the public eye, but recommended him to the cynical Praetorian Guard. As emperor, he proved an able administrator and briefly restored stability to Rome. Ancient historians regarded him as bloodthirsty and temperamental, but he now looks an oasis of sanity compared with Caligula and Nero, the two monsters who book-ended his reign.\n\nGalba, Emperor of Rome (3 BC-AD 69)\n\nIt is quite a coincidence that, of the five Roman commanders who led the invasion of Kent in AD 43, two – Galba and Vespasian – would later become Emperor. Their imperial fates, however, would be very different. Galba was unintentionally responsible for briefly postponing Roman rule in Britain, the invasion being delayed on account of his illness. At the time he commanded the Upper German legions, having pursued the typical military and administrative career of a patrician. Galba’s misfortune was that, 10 years after retiring under Emperor Claudius, he was recalled by the unstable Nero to govern Hispania. Eventually, Galba opportunistically rebelled, and was proclaimed Emperor when Nero prudently killed himself. He assumed the role in June 68, but instead of taking a firm lead proved indolent and negligent. Having already alienated many with his robust discipline, he found himself friendless when former ally Otho declared against him. After a rule of just seven months, he was executed.\n\nCaratacus (~15-54)\n\nWhen Claudius’s army arrived in Britain in AD 43, Caratacus was chieftain of the all-conquering Catuvellauni. Ironically, his military prowess sparked the fateful invasion when a defeated opponent, Verica of the Atrebates, fled to Gaul and appealed to the Empire for help. It was all the excuse Claudius needed. When news of the Roman invasion reached his stronghold at Colchester, Caratacus brought an army to Kent with his brother Togodumnus to mount a defence. The pair were twice defeated, first on the Medway and then on the Thames. The Romans took Colchester and turned it into their first colony, Camulodunum – notoriously the scene of the first massacre perpetrated by Boadicea and the Iceni 17 years later. Caratacus was eventually captured and sent to Rome, where he successfully pleaded with the Senate for his life; he never went home. He is now identified with the legendary Welsh hero Caradoc, and was commemorated in a witty boy-scout song, ‘The Court of King Caratacus’.\n\nVespasian, Emperor of Rome (9-79)\n\nArriving in Kent as leader of one of the four invading Roman legions in AD 43, Vespasian had little reputation to fall back on: from a non-patrician background, he’d pursued a chequered career as a bureaucrat. Yet he distinguished himself in subjugating the south of Britannia as far west as Cornwall, and was rewarded with a consulship. After serving as governor of Africa, he was sent to quell the Jewish Revolt in AD 66. Three years later, Nero’s death precipitated the tumultuous Year of the Four Emperors. Vespasian could never have guessed that he’d be the fourth. He skilfully restored order, and with his sons Titus and Domitian established the 27-year Flavian dynasty. He famously imposed a tax on urine collection, for which reason Italians still call a urinal a vespasiano; and, more significantly, he sent Agricola to subdue the Scots. Renowned for his gentle wit, he quipped on his deathbed, “Damn. I think I’m turning into a god!”\n\nPertinax, Emperor of Rome (126-193)\n\nPertinax was a decent man in the wrong place at the wrong time. Of humble origins, he performed well in the Parthian War, later becoming governor of a succession of Roman provinces, including Britannia. He arrived at Richborough in AD 185, and may have dwelt at Lullingstone Villa, where a bust possibly representing him was found. His time in Britannia was unhappy, the troops being restive, but easy compared with what followed. After returning to Rome, he found the Pretorian Guard at his doorstep on New Year’s Day 193, and assumed they had been sent by Commodus to kill him. In fact, they were proclaiming him emperor. He immediately took measures to restrain these Praetorians’ abuse of their power, which simply outraged them. Three months later, they came to confront him. Instead of fleeing, Pertinax – whose name meant ‘stubborn’ – stayed to reason with them. They murdered him, and sold the emperor’s title to the highest bidder.\n\nSeptimius Severus, Emperor of Rome (145-211)\n\nLike Vespasian, Severus came to power after the murder of a tyrant followed by two short-lived pretenders. Unlike him, Severus had to vanquish two other generals to secure absolute power. He was actually of Carthaginian extraction, born in modern-day Libya. His background was equestrian, though he did enjoy some aristocratic connections. As Emperor, he fought a running battle with the disapproving Senate. He also bravely disbanded the over-mighty Praetorian Guard. Fortunately, the populace loved him for restoring the dignity of his office. His calling, however, was military. After campaigns to expand Rome’s frontiers in the Middle East and North Africa, he ordered the construction of London’s walls with stone from Maidstone before heading north to subdue the Scots. He fell sick in mid-campaign, and died at York. Disastrously, the three Severans who succeeded him – Caracalla, Elagobalus, and Alexander Severus – proved respectively bad, mad, and sad. They ushered in a half-century of crisis that all but destroyed the Empire.\n\nOffa, King of Mercia (died 796)\n\nOffa was the most outstanding Anglo-Saxon king before Alfred. Whether he stood out for the right reasons is another matter. He was the classic warlord, ever on the lookout for opportunities to expand his dominions. When King Aethelberht II of Kent died in 762, leaving behind an uncertain succession, Offa took advantage by sending in an invading army. What exactly happened next, the records are too patchy to tell. We know that he fought a battle against the Kentishmen at Otford in 776, though the outcome is unknown; but it’s clear that Kent had become a client state of Mercia at some point. He threw down a further challenge to Canterbury by setting up a short-lived archbishopric at Lichfield. In truth, like many a conquistador, he left behind little of any use. His most enduring legacy was the Dyke that still bears his name, built to put a stop to Welsh raids into England.\n\nAlfred the Great, King of the English (~ 848-99)\n\nIt is a pity that Alfred is mostly remembered as the man who burnt the cakes. If any king deserves the title ‘The Great’, it is him. He was just 16 when the fearsome Great Heathen Army landed from Scandinavia, and 24 when he was crowned king of Wessex. It was only by remote chance that he ever reigned, three elder brothers having died naturally before him. Though not physically powerful, he’d a towering intellect and a kind disposition that endeared him to all. He also had iron determination. After the Viking horde swept across England, Alfred was reduced to just fifty knights holed up on the Isle of Athelney. Undaunted, he built a new army locally that sensationally smashed the Danes at Edington in 878. Guthrum was forced to sign an epoch-making peace treaty that enabled Alfred to unite the English nation under one king. He came to Kent in 892, successfully repelling a massive Viking invasion fleet.\n\nHasting (C9)\n\nThe Genghis Khan of his day, Hasting or Hastein was a Dane of obscure origins who devoted himself to pillaging as much of the known world as he could reach. He started with the Franks, ravaging one city after another in the 850s before moving on to Spain and then Islamic Africa. He headed back north to seek new plunder in France and Italy, where he enhanced his reputation for barbarism. After another stint in France, he invaded the increasingly prosperous England in 892. He landed at Milton Regis with his 80-strong fleet, while another 250 crews disembarked at Appledore. Unfortunately for him, the home defence was masterminded by Alfred the Great and his son Edward the Elder. Having made terms with Alfred, Hasting went rampaging further afield, enjoying success particularly in Wales. The English defence, however, was dogged. In 896, Hasting and his army disappeared from history, his two sons having being christened under Alfred’s auspices.\n\nEdward the Elder, King of the English (~874-924)\n\nLiving in the shadow of his towering father Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder has never had the recognition he deserved. He took a leading military role in the campaign to repel the Danish invasion of Kent in 893, succeeded Alfred in 899, and painstakingly drove out the Danish overlordship of East Anglia by 918. The latter campaign involved collaborating with his able sister Ethelflaed, who had accompanied her husband Ethelred of Mercia into battle against the Danes and become known as ‘Lady of the Mercians’ after his death. Consequently, when she herself died in 918, Edward was able to unite all England apart from the Northumbrian Danelaw. There was more trouble ahead in 924, however, when Mercians and Welshmen revolted, and Edward had to put down the uprising. He was married to Aedgifu of Kent, who gave birth to Athelstan, his successor, whom Dark Ages historian Michael Wood deemed the creator of modern England.\n\nAethelstan, King of England (~894-939)\n\nA good example of the principle that inherited qualities skip a generation was Aethelstan, grandson of Alfred the Great, who matched him in both military leadership and sound governance. In 924, he succeeded his father Edward the Elder as king of the English, and in 930 called a witenagemot (council of elders) at Faversham, an example of his consultative approach to administration. His greatest challenge arrived in 937 when Olaf Guthfrithson, the Viking ruler of Ireland and Northumbria, allied with a confederation of Celts, intent on the invasion and destruction of England. Aethelstan raised an army and marched north with his Welsh, Anglo-Danish, and Icelandic allies. At Brunanburh – probably Bromborough in the Wirral – they won a comprehensive victory, after which five kings and seven earls lay dead, and Aethelstan could claim to be the first king of all England. He died just two years later, however, and the North again fell prey to the depredations of Norsemen.\n\nSweyn Forkbeard, King of England (960-1014)\n\nSweyn (or Svend in his native Danish) was England’s most colourfully named monarch. He ruled Denmark for nearly 30 years, took over much of Norway, and briefly became King of England. Son of the equally colourful Harald Bluetooth – who’d united parts of Scandinavia in the same way that Ericsson Mobile’s technology would later combine devices – he was a pagan who unceremoniously dethroned his Christian father. From 1002 he mounted a series of raids on England, ostensibly in retaliation for the so-called St Brice’s Day Massacre when the English had turned on Danish settlers, but more likely in search of booty. He acquired a fortune in Danegeld, and in 1013 mounted a full-scale invasion, starting in Sandwich. His army then swept anti-clockwise around the whole nation. He declared himself King of England on Christmas Day, but died five weeks later in Lincolnshire. He had however fatally damaged the Anglo-Saxon monarchy by opening the door to his hard-nosed son, Cnut.\n\nCnut the Great, King of England (~990-1035)\n\nCnut (or Canute) Sweynson was the only English king bar Alfred to be called ‘Great’. After his father’s death, he was driven from England by the returning Saxon king, notoriously pausing in Kent to mutilate his Saxon hostages. He returned to Sandwich in 1016 with a mighty army that conquered all England. He then set about re-modelling the nation, merging it with his native Denmark before adding Norway and part of Sweden to his empire. Though cruel and immoral, he seriously sucked up to the Church, even making a pilgrimage to Rome, which earned a good press from the clerics who wrote history. The anecdote for which he is best remembered, when he instructed the waves to turn back, was actually meant to demonstrate his piety by revealing the limits of his earthly power; virtue signalling is nothing new. Like Offa, Cnut left behind nothing worth the bloodshed. The earthy Saxons doubtless had much pithier epithets for him than ‘Great’.\n\nEdmund Ironside, King of England (~990-1016)\n\nThe reign of Aethelred the Unready (whose name and epithet originally meant something like ‘Well-Advised the Ill-Advised’) was the beginning of the end for Anglo-Saxon England. He paid tribute to the Vikings instead of battling them, inviting Sweyn Forkbeard’s brief seizure of his throne in 1013. After Sweyn’s death, his son Cnut returned with a large force in 1015, following which Aethelred’s sturdier son Edmund took up the cudgels. He rebelled against and then succeeded his father, and convincingly took on Cnut four times in battle, defeating him at Otford and earning the nickname Ironside. However, at Assandun (1016), he was betrayed by his Mercian ally and routed, following which he had to cede the land north of Wessex to the invader. He died the following month, probably of nefarious causes. He was buried at Glastonbury, possibly with one of his prize possessions: a sword left to him by his elder brother that had belonged to Offa.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror (~1028-1087)\n\nThe grimmest day in the history of the British Isles was October 14th, 1066, when William, the Duke of Normandy, destroyed the English army at Hastings and took Harold Godwinson’s crown. He had claimed it on the strength of a debatable promise from the half-Norman king Edward the Confessor, and succeeded by dint of a concerted operation with King Harald Hardrada of Norway, whom Harold had defeated 19 days earlier in Lincolnshire. William’s alien regime was a dictatorship, a tiny gang of Normans holding sway by means of well-organised terror. These same men savaged the North of England, and their descendants annexed much of the Celtic world. William I was resentful of Kent, which despite suffering heavy losses in the vanguard of Harold’s army uniquely stood up to him, successfully demanding the retention of gavelkind at the expense of primogeniture. He vengefully gifted much Kentish land to his obnoxious half-brother Odo, with painful consequences for all.\n\nHenry I, King of England (~1068-1135)\n\nThe fourth son of William the Conqueror, Henry ‘Beauclerc’ was not one to take his cadet status lying down. As was the Norman way, he spent years battling his older brothers, sometimes literally, until he himself became king and made the true heir Robert his lifelong prisoner. He then devoted himself to fighting the French in order to secure his domains across the Channel. He did earn renown as an administrator, resuming the process of stitching together a new, Norman England. However, of his numerous children by different women, just two were legitimate, and his only legitimate son William Aetheling drowned in the White Ship disaster of 1120. Henry consequently made his daughter Matilda, widow of the Holy Roman Emperor, his heiress. His visit to Rochester in 1130, for the dedication of the cathedral, was overshadowed by a terrible fire, auguring dismal times ahead. At his death, his nephew Stephen usurped the throne, precipitating the disastrous 19-year Anarchy.\n\nHenry II, King of England (1133-89)\n\nIt was Empress Matilda’s son Henry who restored Norman fortunes after her calamitous civil war with King Stephen. Like his grandfather Henry I, Henry was a stern, determined ruler, who likewise reigned for 35 years. He has been credited with introducing the basis of English common law, and paving the way for the United Kingdom. He returned stability to England, brought Wales and Ireland under his control, and held Scotland in check. Having already inherited Normandy, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, he added Guyenne and Poitou to his vast Angevin empire by marrying Eleanor of Aquitaine, and later annexed Brittany. After meeting Louis VII of France at Dover in 1179, he greatly expanded the castle. By then, however, his conflict with Becket had cost his reputation dearly, and his wife and three sons had rebelled, backed by several foreign powers. Henry vanquished them, but was eventually defeated by Louis’ son Philip II and his own son Richard, who succeeded him.\n\nRichard I, King of England (1157-99)\n\nGenerations of English children grew up thinking Richard the Lionheart a national hero. The belief stemmed entirely from his prowess as a warrior: the Crusader King who earned his spurs as the worthiest opponent ever faced by Saladin, but who was incarcerated for years by the Holy Roman Emperor on his journey home. Beyond bellicosity, however, he had nothing to offer England. The fact that his true cognomen was Coeur de Lion says it all. He was thoroughly rooted in the Norman elite who still tyrannised England, and his heart lay in France. His mother Eleanor of Aquitaine took him there at 13, and he didn’t return before landing at Sandwich in 1194. On top of participating in repeated revolts against his own father, he spent his life seeking salvation by persistently breaking the Sixth Commandment, including the massacre of 2,700 prisoners at Acre. His only good legacy was his Three Lions crest, which now adorns the England and Faversham football shirts.\n\nJohn, King of England (1166-1216)\n\nWhile Richard I was customarily depicted in children’s fiction as a hero, his youngest brother John was the villainous ‘Lackland’ who strove to steal Richard’s crown in his absence. Having married Isabella of Gloucester at Canterbury, John succeeded the late Richard in 1199, and presided over a litany of failures. In 1204, Philip II of France annexed the Duchy of Normandy and most of John’s other possessions in France, extinguishing the Angevin empire. Five years later, John was excommunicated over a dispute with Pope Innocent III and forced to capitulate four years later, when he encamped an army of 60,000 at Barham Downs and submitted to the papal legate near Dover. After endless trouble with upstart barons, they forced him to endorse Magna Carta in 1215, only sparking further hostilities. He died of dysentery while resisting Prince Louis’s invasion. Today he gets some credit for serving dutifully through a difficult reign, his worst faults being pettiness and biliousness.\n\nPandulf Verraccio, Bishop of Norwich (died 1226)\n\nOstensibly a holy man, Pandulf Verraccio from Rome was more like Pope Innocent III’s consigliere. He became known in England in the course of the Vatican’s dispute with King John occasioned by the godfatherly Pope’s insistence on appointing the next Archbishop of Canterbury. When John resisted Rome’s interference, he was excommunicated. In 1213, Verraccio was sent to dictate terms, probably at Temple Ewell, which included the King’s personal submission and acceptance of England’s new status as a fiefdom of Rome. The legate returned to England in 1215, and with the Pope’s blessing provided John with some protection against the menaces of the barons and France. In turn the King kept him sweet by appointing him Bishop of Norwich, although he was not consecrated for several years. Verraccio returned to Rome, where he died, yet was buried back in Norwich. He appears as a character in Shakespeare’s ‘The Life and Death of King John’.\n\nAlexander II, King of Scotland (1198-1249)\n\nThe red-haired son of Scotland’s King William the Lion, Alexander was sent to London as a youth in the interests of good relations with England, and was knighted by King John in 1213. Ironically, he would be back three years later as King of Scotland at the head of an enemy army. Having joined the First Barons’ War on the rebels’ side, he marched all the way to Dover to join up with Prince Louis’s French invasion fleet. It came to nothing, because John died, the Pope supported the accession of the young Henry III, and both Louis and Alexander were obliged to go home. The Scottish king prudently resumed good relations with the English Crown, later marrying Henry’s daughter Joan of England. In 1237 he went down in history as the Scottish king who signed the Treaty of York, fixing the border between Scotland and England on pretty much the lines that hold today.\n\nMargaret of France, Queen of England (~1279-1318)\n\nAfter the death of Edward I’s wife Eleanor of Castile, he struck a deal in 1291 with his French counterpart Philip III whereby he would cede Gascony to France in return for the hand of Philip’s beautiful daughter Blanche. She was already betrothed to Edward’s only son, Prince Edward, but rumours of her beauty swayed him. It emerged, however, that she was also betrothed to a German prince. Five years of hostilities followed, after which France ceded Guyenne and offered Blanche’s half-sister Margaret to Edward, while Prince Edward married Philip’s granddaughter Isabella. After her wedding at Canterbury in 1299, Margaret settled agreeably into her new life in England, earning a reputation as a restraining influence on the elderly king’s irritability. After his death, though still in her twenties, she declined to marry again; but she did provide financial support for baronial intrigues against Edward II’s favourite Piers Gaveston, leading to his exile. She died at her home, Marlborough Castle.\n\nIsabella of France, Queen of England (~1295-1358)\n\n‘The She-Wolf of France’ is quite an epithet to be remembered by, but Edward II’s wife worked hard for it. Married to the 24-year-old English king when she was 12, she bore two sons in her teens: Edward and John, born respectively at Windsor Castle and Eltham Palace. She certainly had cause to be annoyed by the King’s hugely damaging dalliances with Piers Gaveston and Hugh Despenser the Younger. After his Duchy of Guyenne was annexed by her brother Charles IV in 1324, she returned to France and took Roger de Mortimer as her lover. They invaded England, deposed her husband, and probably ordered his murder. After ruling lavishly as regents for three years, they were subdued by her now 17-year-old son, the redoubtable Edward III, who executed Mortimer and allowed her an opulent retirement. Mel Gibson’s depiction of her in ‘Braveheart’ (1995) as a cutie who bore Wallace’s son was typically mendacious – she was then three years old.\n\nJohn II the Good, King of France (1319-64)\n\nWhoever thought of the epithet ‘Jean le Bon’ had a way with irony. The son of Philip the Fortunate, he was the somewhat weedy individual whose reign started with plague, rebellion, and war, but deteriorated. At Poitiers in 1356, his army was so much the bigger that the English were desperate to make peace; yet Jean fluffed the negotiations, and was routed. Taken prisoner, he was exiled in London, where he lived a flâneur’s life. After four years, his son paid a ransom of 3,000,000 crowns by the Treaty of Brétigny. Jean took his time to get home, stopping for a feast at Eltham Palace, an overnight at Dartford, visits to Ospringe’s Maison Dieu and the Becket shrine at Canterbury, and dinner at Dover. When his other son defaulted on the terms of the Treaty, Jean voluntarily returned to captivity while his people starved. The English must have thought, “With enemies like Jean, who needs friends?”\n\nValdemar IV, King of Denmark (1320-75)\n\nEight years after Christopher II of Denmark died in 1332, leaving Denmark divided and bankrupt, his son Valdemar was crowned. By taxation and military conquest, he restored the nation, earning the nickname Atterdag, meaning ‘Day Again’. Following the Black Death, however, he turned on the powerful Hanseatic League, mounting a merciless invasion of Gotland in 1361 that is still recalled with bitterness in Sweden. His troops offered the town of Visby a choice: fill three large barrels with gold and silver within three days, or suffer the worst of Viking pillaging. The locals complied instantly. Initial Hanseatic reprisals having been repulsed, Valdemar enjoyed some light relief in 1364, attending Edward III’s Banquet of the Four Kings at Eltham while en route to Avignon, where the new Pope was based. The tables were turned in 1367, however, when the League sacked Copenhagen with Sweden’s backing, and expelled Valdemar until he signed the humiliating Treaty of Stralsund in 1370.\n\nDavid II, King of Scotland (1324-71)\n\nAmong the jingoistic deceits in ‘Braveheart’ (1995), one of the subtlest was omitting to say what happened next. Thirteen years after Bannockburn (1314), the Anglo-Norman blockhead Edward II was murdered and replaced by his infinitely more capable son, Edward III. Parliament signed a peace treaty with the rebel Scoto-Norman king Robert de Bruce, whose four-year-old son David was married off to Edward’s sister Joan of the Tower, aged seven. Following de Bruce’s death in 1329, the Scoto-Norman de Balliols attempted to resume the Scottish throne, with Edward’s support, and King David fled to France until the danger subsided. In 1346, while Edward was campaigning in France, David invaded England at France’s behest, and was routed. Held prisoner for eleven years, he was finally ransomed. He proved a more capable ruler than most, however, and attended Edward’s regal banquet at Eltham in 1364. Within 250 years, England was ruled by Scots, not by conquest but by inheritance.\n\nJoan, Countess of Kent (~1327-85)\n\nWhat’s strange about the ‘Fair Maid of Kent’ is that we only have a French chronicler’s word for it that she was beautiful, and she was certainly no Maid of Kent. Her father was the 1st Earl of Kent, whose title simply misappropriated Kent’s senior county status; his seat was Arundel Castle in Sussex. Born at Woodstock, Oxfordshire, Joan wed both a Lancastrian and a Somersetian at 12, the latter marriage being annulled as bigamous. Shortly after being widowed in 1360, she married Edward, the Black Prince, and bore one of England’s most abysmal kings, Richard II. She did travel to Canterbury in 1381 to visit Becket’s shrine, and on her way home ran into Wat Tyler’s rebels at Blackheath; fortunately, they greeted her warmly. ‘Joan of Kent’ died at Wallingford Castle in Berkshire and, true to form, was not buried in the chapel Edward had built for her in Canterbury Cathedral, but with her first husband in Lincolnshire.\n\nPeter I, King of Cyprus & Jerusalem (1328-69)\n\nIn 1358, Pierre I de Lusignan became king of Cyprus when his father abdicated. His other nominal possession, Jerusalem, had long since been overrun by Mohammedans, and the Ottoman threat to Cyprus was looming. Foreshadowing Manuel II Palaeologos – the Byzantine emperor who would come west in 1400 seeking military aid for Constantinople – Peter took advantage of a visit to France on dynastic business to drum up support for a new crusade, his own proactive military efforts having availed little. After trying the Venetian Republic and the Holy Roman Empire, and even meeting the Pope in Avignon, he proceeded to England. He was met at Dover by Humphrey de Bohun, who escorted him to London via Canterbury and later fought for him in Egypt. Apart from a cash gift, Peter’s mission otherwise proved fruitless. He missed Edward III’s kingly banquet at Eltham, and even left behind at Sandwich a ship Edward gave him. Five years later, he was assassinated.\n\nJean Froissart (~1337-~1405)\n\nIn the medieval French-speaking world, which included the English ruling caste, Jean Froissart was such a literary force that there are now statues to him both in his native Hainaut in Belgium and in the Louvre, as well as which Elgar wrote a Froissart Overture. His copious poetry includes ‘Méliador’, a 30,000-line Arthurian romance; yet the work for which he is best remembered is his ‘Chroniques’, whose four volumes relate European history from 1326 to 1400. Though occasionally biased and inaccurate, they are lavishly illustrated, and provide valuable details of battles for historians. They certainly were popular among the said ruling caste, being both expensive and preoccupied with chivalry. Froissart was patronised by Philippa of Hainaut, Edward III’s queen consort. In 1395, she invited him to present a sample of his work at Leeds Castle, where the royal court of Richard II was being held. He described the castle as a “beautiful palace in Kent”.\n\nKatherine Swynford, Duchess of Lancaster (~1349-1403)\n\nAmong the entourage of Edward III‘s queen Philippa of Hainault was young Katherine de Roet, the daughter of a Flemish knight, who was to prove disproportionately influential in English history. After marrying the short-lived Hugh Swynford in 1362, she moved into the service of John of Gaunt’s wife Blanche, Duchess of Lancaster, after whose death she served his second wife Constance of Castile. She then became his mistress, staying with him at Northbourne in 1373, and bore four illegitimate children, all named Beaufort after Gaunt’s French estate. After Constance’s death, the two married and, with the support of Gaunt’s son by his first marriage, the usurper Henry IV, got their children legitimised by the Church. So was established the House of Lancaster, whose emergence prompted the Wars of the Roses. Katherine’s great-grandaughter, the formidable Margaret Beaufort, gave birth to another usurper, Henry Tudor, whose deposition of Richard III in 1485 ended the wars and reshaped England irrevocably.\n\nManuel II Palaeologos, Emperor of Byzantium (1350-1425)\n\nA thousand years after the Romans departed, another Roman Emperor visited Kent. We’d have called him a Greek, Manuel Palaeologos being Emperor of Byzantium, a relic of the old Eastern Empire; but his people still called themselves Romans. Henry IV accommodated him lavishly at Eltham Palace, with even a joust thrown in. The Emperor had come touring Europe in search of support for the defence of Constantinople against the Turks. He pleaded that Byzantium, Christianity’s bulwark against the Caliphate, had fallen on hard times since the 4th Crusaders stripped it bare. Even with the unprecedented backing of the Vatican, normally at odds with the apostate Orthodox Church, he got little help. Manuel’s son John would be killed at Constantinople 52 years later, defending the city in vain with a ragbag of Greeks and mercenaries against Mehmet II’s horde. Having secured a foothold in Europe, the Ottomans would be at the gates of Vienna within 80 years.\n\nSigismond of Luxembourg, Holy Roman Emperor (1368-1437)\n\nSigismond of Luxembourg looks from a distance like a jobbing king. Originally from Nuremberg, he was the son of a Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV, from the powerful Luxembourg dynasty. By the time he visited Canterbury in 1416, he himself was king of Hungary, of Croatia, and of Germany. He came to Kent in pursuit of an alliance with England, having seen his current allies, the mighty French, humbled at Agincourt. He and Henry V signed the Treaty of Canterbury that paved the way to ending the Great Schism between the popes of Rome and of Avignon. After achieving his aim, he lost interest in England, but reverted to his hobby of CV enhancement by adding the kingdoms of Bohemia and Italy. Eventually, in 1433, he matched his father in becoming emperor. The fact that he actually troubled to cross the English Channel, however, is evidence of England’s growing stature after centuries as a Norman province.\n\nHenry V, King of England (1386-1422)\n\nThe Duke of Monmouth, son of Henry Tudor, was essentially Black Prince, Volume II. Both were named after their warlike father, proved argumentative eldest sons, became brilliant generals, made light of enemy numerical supremacy, and won momentous victories. Both also treated their captives with monstrous inhumanity. The major difference was that Henry’s father died young, so that he actually succeeded to the throne. In 1416, he struck a landmark alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor at Canterbury. Not only that, but he made the French king’s daughter his wife, becoming heir to the French throne. Had he lived just two months longer, England and France would have been united under one monarch; the mind boggles. Instead, his life resumed the course of the Black Prince’s. He too died of dysentery, and left a fool to rule in his stead. Harry did come to England’s aid in 1944, when Laurence Olivier’s ‘Henry V’ proved the best morale-booster of WW2.\n\nHenry VI, King of England & France (1421-71)\n\nA baby when his redoubtable father died suddenly, Henry VI visited Wye Court at only six. Although he was crowned King of France at Notre-Dame at ten, power initially rested with his unreliable protector Humphrey of Lancaster, on whose watch Joan of Arc’s ‘miraculous’ intervention at Orleans in 1429 sparked the sharp decline of Anglo-Norman dominance in France. Pre-occupied with non-martial pursuits, which included founding such educational institutions as Eton College and King’s College, Cambridge, the spineless Henry was no match for the political forces swirling around him. Although he survived Jack Cade’s Rebellion in 1450, his flaccid rule and periods of mental instability left the field to his enemy Richard, Duke of York, and the Queen, Margaret of Anjou, who poured oil on the factional fires. Although he was briefly restored nine years after being deposed in 1461, Henry and his only son were killed by the Yorkists after the Battle of Tewkesbury.\n\nElizabeth Woodville, Queen of England (1437-92)\n\nBorn in Northants, the eldest daughter of the commoner Richard Woodville of Maidstone and noble Jacquetta of Luxembourg, Elizabeth was renowned for her great beauty. After her first husband Sir John Grey was killed at the 2nd Battle of St Albans in 1461, the lustful King Edward IV took a shine to her and, though precontracted to marry Lady Eleanor Talbot, he wed Elizabeth secretly in 1464. A year later, the news public, she travelled to her coronation in style from Eltham Palace, Edward’s favourite country resort. However, his association with the upstart Woodvilles enraged his ally, the Earl of Warwick, who turned on him and had Elizabeth’s father and brother put to death after the Battle of Edgecote (1469). Nevertheless, she outlived both Warwick and Edward, and left a historic legacy: her sons the Princes in the Tower, her daughter Elizabeth of York – Henry VII’s Queen Consort – and her grandson Henry VIII.\n\nHenry VII, King of England (1457-1509)\n\nThe grandson of Catherine de Valois and her ambitious lover Owen Tudor, Henry Tudor was born at remote Pembroke Castle, but became the Lancastrian who ended the Wars of the Roses and fathered a momentous dynasty. Following his abortive participation in Buckingham’s Revolt in 1483, he returned two years later to kill the Yorkist king Richard III at Bosworth. He then prudently married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, to unify England’s warring houses. Although a sickly individual, he was intelligent, industrious, and charming. He successfully encouraged a commercial spirit in lieu of a warlike one, and initiated Kent’s shipbuilding industry at Erith. Though he travelled frequently through Kent on pilgrimages to Canterbury, however, he could never shake off the charge of being a usurper. His talented son Arthur and his beloved wife both died suddenly, consuming him with grief. He himself died of TB, fatefully opening the door to his younger son, Henry VIII.\n\nDesiderius Erasmus (1466-1536)\n\nDespite his Latinate name, Erasmus was probably born in Rotterdam. The illegitimate son of a Catholic priest, he was himself ordained in 1492. He studied at Paris before being invited to Cambridge. There he became Professor of Divinity at Queen’s College, whose distinctly humanist leanings matched his own. In 1499, he famously visited Eltham Palace, where he met Henry VII’s three children. Young Prince Henry ordered him to write them a poem, which he did; but it was the last time he would kowtow to the author of the English Reformation. Intellectually, he was a free spirit. His views became manifest as the Protestant revolution swept over North Europe. Erasmus critiqued the Catholic Church – his first work ‘In Praise of Folly’ being a satire – but also refused to adapt to the Lutheran orthodoxy. In an age of partisanship, this ‘middle way’ was courageous, though likely to please few. He is now generally rated among the most enlightened of theologians.\n\nDr John Colet (1467-1519)\n\nThe son of a wealthy Lord Mayor of London, Colet studied at Oxford and became a rector. He went to study in France and Italy for three years, during which he was exposed to the emergent humanist thinking and befriended the like-minded Erasmus. While ascending the Church hierarchy back in England, he became renowned for powerful sermons challenging clerical corruption and medieval scholasticism. Although some thought his reformist stance heretical, others welcomed it, and in any case he enjoyed Henry VIII’s backing after endorsing his opposition to war with France. Since none of his 21 siblings had survived childhood, Colet inherited all his father’s estate, and as dean of St Paul’s Cathedral applied part to founding a new St Paul’s School, teaching his humanist values. After making a pilgrimage to Canterbury in 1514, he died suddenly of the mysterious sweating-sickness, and was commemorated by a memorial in St Paul’s until it burnt down in 1666.\n\nLorenzo Campeggio (1474-1539)\n\nA Milanese who took up papal diplomacy after his wife’s early death, Lorenzo Campeggio was sent first on missions to the Holy Roman Emperor and the Duke of Milan, and then to Henry VIII. After being received by a distinguished body of gentlemen at Deal in 1518, he made a well-documented journey to London via Sandwich, Canterbury, Sittingbourne, Boxley Abbey, Otford, Lewisham, and Blackheath. His visit culminated in the signing of Cardinal Wolsey’s historic ‘Treaty of London’, a pan-European ‘Make War History’ agreement that catapulted Henry onto the world stage, and maintained peace for all of two years. Following his appointment as Cardinal Protector of England in 1523, Campeggio’s next appearance in Kent in 1528 was less well-starred, with Henry’s divorce from Catherine of Aragon being mooted, and England about to renounce Catholicism. By 1531, Campeggio had entered history as the final Cardinal Protector of England; but he did enjoy the consolation of seeing Henry excommunicated.\n\nSir Martin Bowes (~1496-1566)\n\nIn his teens, Martin Bowes from York was apprenticed to Robert Amadas, a London goldsmith and deputy master of the Mint. Thirteen years later, having been admitted to the Goldsmiths’ Company, he became Amadas’s deputy at the Mint and, after a long legal dispute, its joint master in 1533. He earned notoriety for illegally debasing English currency by secretly cutting its silver content and pocketing the difference; yet, when this came out under Henry VIII, he was authorised to do it legally in the king’s name. He also acquired numerous lucrative posts: alderman, sheriff, mayor, knight, MP. In 1547, having secured St Bartholomew’s Priory and Grey Friars for the City, he used them to secure himself additional income. The obscene amounts of money he accumulated bought him estates that included Woolwich, Plumstead, and Bexley, and the manors of North Cray and East Wickham. Despite his breathtaking venality, Bowes somehow survived the reigns of all five Tudor monarchs.\n\nCharles V, Holy Roman Emperor (1500-58)\n\nIt’s disappointing that the son of ‘Philip the Handsome’ and ‘Joanna the Mad’ was not ‘Charles the Insanely Good-Looking’. Charles V, a self-styled Charlemagne, was head of the Hapsburg clan when the world was falling at its feet. In short order, he found himself Lord of the Netherlands, where he was born, followed by King of Spain, Archduke of Austria, King of Italy, King of Germany, and Holy Roman Emperor; not to mention overlord of the Americas. Anxious to stave off an Anglo-French alliance, he visited Kent in 1520, meeting Wolsey at Dover and Henry VIII at Canterbury. Two years later, after Henry’s ‘Field of the Cloth of Gold’ jaunt proved a waste of money, he returned to Dover, showing off Aztec treasures looted by Cortes. The anti-French pact he struck came to naught when Henry divorced Charlie’s aunt, Catherine of Aragon. The Emperor, grown disillusioned with his project to unify Europe, ultimately abdicated all his titles.\n\nJohn Leland (~1503-1552)\n\nAn alumnus of Cambridge, Oxford, and Paris, Londoner John Leland was concerned that the great libraries of the monasteries King Henry VIII was intent on destroying were being lost, priceless volumes being removed, for example, by scholarly Germans. He got a dispensation to create a register of all books held by such libraries, which in turn led to many being saved in royal libraries. In the 1530s and 1540s, he undertook a series of tours of English and Welsh regions, extensively cataloguing England’s antiquarian heritage. The county he focused on first and foremost was Kent, which he described as “the key of al Englande”. His records were published together as his ‘Itinerary’. His interest extended into archaeology. He reported the particular proliferation of Roman coins at Richborough, higher than anywhere in Britain. He also identified Roman bricks, both there and at Canterbury, Dover Castle, and Lympne. He is now known as the father of local history.\n\nPhilip II, King of Spain (1527-98)\n\nAfter Charles V split his empire, Philip II took charge of the Hispanic division. This man took his work very seriously. His ideological goal was to crush Protestantism, to which end he waged war even on his own Dutch Calvinist subjects. In 1554, he wed the new Catholic Queen of England, Mary I, who introduced him to Greenwich. The marriage was a purely political arrangement: he made himself co-regent in law, although ‘King Philip of England’ is seldom listed in British history books. After Mary’s false pregnancy and early death, he devoted himself to overthrowing her Protestant successor, Queen Elizabeth I. His plans to replace her with Mary Queen of Scots having been foiled by the latter’s execution, he plotted a more direct course: invasion. Already infuriated by having his beard singed at Cadiz, he saw his project ruined in 1588 by the wreck of the Armada sent to transport the Duke of Parma’s huge army to Kent.\n\nPrincess Cecilia of Sweden (1540-1627)\n\nA beautiful Swedish princess sounds the stuff fairy-tales, but Cecilia Gustavsdotter Vasa was more reminiscent of the feckless love-object in Paul Simon’s eponymous song. She first earned notoriety at 19, when a young man was caught trouserless in her closet. He was forced to swear that nothing had happened, and the royal family published a coin depicting her as the picture of innocence. After marrying at 23, she undertook a diplomatic mission to England with her husband, the Margrave of Baden-Rodemachern, hoping to secure Elizabeth I’s military aid against the hostile Danes. They finally arrived at Dover after a year-long journey via Finland, Poland, and Germany. Her mission was scarcely worthwhile, but she did rack up huge debts, and when trying to slip out of the country at Dover had all her goods confiscated. She caused more embarrassment by having a baby while living in sin after her husband’s death, but did finally settle down comfortably in Luxembourg.\n\nHelena Snakenborg, Marchioness of Northampton (~1548-1635)\n\nOne of Princess Cecilia’s retinue on her diplomatic visit to England in 1565 was Elin Ulfsdotter Snakenborg of Fyllingarum. The journey from their native Sweden, involving a vast detour to avoid hostile Danish and Norwegian waters, had taken nearly a year. At Dover, they were greeted by Catherine Parr’s brother, the newly bereaved Marquess of Northampton, who took a shine to Elin. Renamed Helena the Red, after her hair colour, she made a better fist of her stay than the princess, and indeed became a confidante of fellow redhead Elizabeth I. She and Northampton married in 1571, though he died within months. She earned the queen’s fury five years later by secretly marrying Sir Thomas Gorges, a commoner, with whom she had several children. She was later forgiven, however, and after Elizabeth’s death in 1603 jointly led the funeral procession, walking immediately behind the coffin. There is a splendid monument to her and Gorges in Salisbury Cathedral.\n\nSir Walter Raleigh (~1553-1618)\n\nRaleigh, a Devonian, is remembered 400 years later only for a succession of gallant failures. He first came to attention when he helped suppress Desmond’s rebellions in Ireland, growing rich on the proceeds. After becoming Elizabeth I’s favourite, he supposedly put his expensive cloak over a puddle for her at Deptford. In 1584, he organised the first of three failed missions to found the first American colony. He next blotted his copybook by romancing a lady-in-waiting, which got him gaoled. To redeem himself upon his release, he set out to find El Dorado, but failed in that too. Even when he sought to popularise smoking, it only caused his manservant to pour water over his head. For his part in a supposed plot, James I sent him for 12 years to the Tower, where he wrote part of his ‘History of the World’. He went exploring again in 1616 but, after illegally ransacking a Spanish outpost, he was beheaded.\n\nCharles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham (1536-1624)\n\nAs Lord Admiral, Howard’s father William, Baron Howard of Effingham, took him to sea as a boy, but the experience only later bore fruit. Young Howard first got a good education, and then went into diplomacy. He became ambassador to France, and was noted for his loyalty to Elizabeth I during her troubles with Mary Queen of Scots, in whose downfall in 1587 he played a role. His place in history was cemented over a few days in 1588, three years after his own appointment as Lord Admiral. He set off from Deptford Green to lead the English fleet that defied the odds to scatter the Spanish Armada. Afterwards, at Margate, he protested bitterly about the conditions to which his sailors had been abandoned, which would lead to 3,000 fatalities, mostly from disease. In 1596, now Lord Nottingham, he raided Cadiz with the Earl of Essex, whose rebellion five years later he decisively put down in London.\n\nFrancis, Duke of Alençon and of Anjou (1554-84)\n\nThe fourth son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de’ Medici was christened Hercule, but being pockmarked and slightly deformed changed his name to the less inappropriate François. At 20, his brother Henry’s accession left him heir to the throne. Nevertheless, he opportunistically joined a Protestant revolt, which secured for him the title Duc d’Anjou. He became one of many suitors of England’s Virgin Queen, although the only one to court her in person; he visited Greenwich and Cobham in 1579, and Rochester, Sittingbourne, Canterbury, and Dover in 1582. However, Sir Francis Walsingham warned Elizabeth against the dangers of childbirth in her forties, doubtless conscious that, if she died, the English throne might fall into French hands. While she vacillated, the Duke led a military adventure in the Netherlands that ended up a fiasco, and she refused him; yet her poem ‘On Monsieur’s Departure’ suggested bittersweet feelings. He died soon afterwards of malaria.\n\nJames I, King of England, Scotland, & Ireland (1566-1625)\n\nWhen James I entertained his brother-in-law Christian IV of Denmark at Upnor and Gravesend in 1606, it was already 39 years since he had succeeded his mother, Mary Queen of Scots, as James VI of Scotland. His reign in England, the fortuitous consequence of Elizabeth I’s childlessness, was a curate’s egg. Certainly the arts flourished, especially drama, and the King James Bible was born under his auspices. But he chose his friends singularly unwisely, his efforts to respect Protestant sentiment provoked the Catholic ‘Gunpowder Plot’, and he opened a Pandora’s Box by stimulating emigration to North America. His mission to merge his native Scotland, rebranded ‘North Britain’, with its Auld Enemy was also doomed to failure. No wonder Anthony Weldon called him “the wisest fool in Christendom”. Compared with the son and grandsons that followed him, however, he was in retrospect the pinnacle of what the Stuart dynasty had to offer.\n\nChristian IV, King of Denmark (1577-1648)\n\nChristian is famous for reigning for 59-years, longer than any other Danish monarch. He visited England once. His sister Anne had married the unprepossessing James VI of Scotland. In 1603, however, his brother-in-law also became James I of England, and was suddenly worth a visit, especially after surviving the Gunpowder Plot orchestrated by disaffected Catholics. When Anne lost a baby in 1606, Christian sailed to Gravesend. The hard-drinking Dane was a Lutheran, faced with the Counter-Reformation in Europe. Two decades later, he would get his country embroiled in the Thirty Years War, pointlessly invading Germany and prompting a bigger Catholic army to tear through Jutland. The fiasco permanently cost Denmark its status as top-dog in the Baltic. It was typical. He played up to the people, even renaming Oslo after himself; but, like many an autocrat, he left it in worse shape than he’d found it. He died a bitter man.\n\nJohn Taylor (1578-1653)\n\nThe wonderfully eccentric John Taylor moved from Gloucestershire to the south bank of the Thames opposite London and became a waterman, ferrying passengers across the river like a C17 taxi-driver. Since many were travelling to and from the theatres on the south bank, he got to hobnob with the literati, which gave him ideas. Fancying himself as a writer, he churned out a vast number of works. They were highly popular, even if unencumbered by such considerations as style and taste. His favourite medium being poetry, he grandiosely styled himself the King’s Water-Poet. Since one of his other pre-occupations was the status, and especially remuneration, of his fellow watermen, he appointed himself their spokesman. Among his many attention-grabbing stunts, he caused some hilarity in 1614 by rowing from London to Queenborough using a pair of salted fish for oar blades. He was also the man who incentivised Nicholas Wood to become a gastronomic prodigy. Taylor died in London.\n\nOrlando Gibbons (1583-1625)\n\nDespite having a father and three brothers who were all highly musical, Orlando Gibbons from Oxford outshone them all as both a composer of madrigals and virginals, and as a keyboards player. He lived at a crucial time in music, when the Renaissance era was giving way to the Baroque. After studying Music at Cambridge, he not only came to be reckoned the best English composer of the early C17, but also learned techniques of composition from William Byrd, and through his son Christopher transmitted them to the likes of Henry Purcell. He enjoyed James I’s patronage, and in 1623 was appointed organist of Westminster Abbey. He was on his way to greet the arrival of the new king Charles I’s bride Henrietta Maria when he succumbed to a probable haemorrhagic stroke; he died at Canterbury, and was buried in the cathedral. Canterbury-born actor Orlando Bloom was named after him.\n\nFrederick V, King of Bohemia (1596-1632)\n\nEight years after the Gunpowder Plot, the wedding of James I’s daughter Elizabeth was meant to be a joyous occasion. She was to marry Frederick, the Bavarian-born Elector Palatine, cementing an alliance with South German Protestants. The grand maritime spectacle arranged by Phineas Pett was not a success, however, though the celebrations continued as the couple made their way through Greenwich, Rochester, and Canterbury to Margate, where they embarked on the Prince Royal for Ostend: a scene later painted by Adam Willaerts. In 1619, Frederick was elected King of Bohemia, by which time the country was embroiled in the Thirty Years War. After just 15 months, he was routed in battle and fled the country, being satirised thereafter as the ‘Winter King’. The couple struggled in exile until his early death from a fever. One consolation was their third son: Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the outstanding Royalist cavalry commander and founder member of the Royal Society.\n\nPocahontas (~1596-1617)\n\nThe Disneyfication of Pocahontas did nobody any favours, except Walt Disney Pictures. The 1995 blockbuster movie made her a princess, with the looks of Beyonce and opinions of Jane Fonda, who enlightened John Smith, fell in love, and saved his life. The reality was entirely different. She was one of the Powhatan chief’s many children, with no special status. She was a child when she encountered the mercenary Smith, whose accounts of her were fanciful. After Smith went home, she became a pawn in negotiations between natives and settlers, her marriage to John Rolfe sealing an eight-year peace. At 19, she was taken to London to meet the Queen, Anne of Denmark, in an effort to raise funding for the Virginian colony. Never more than a curiosity, she died suddenly on the Thames, and was buried in Gravesend. The biographical description of her as “ambassador, stateswoman, peacemaker, visionary” would have angered her people, and embarrassed her.\n\nSir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641)\n\nAnthonio van Dyck was born in Antwerp – then in the Spanish Netherlands, now in Belgium – but ended up an English resident, and indeed a knight. From a wealthy merchant family, he was a precociously talented painter, joining Rubens’ studio in his teens. After a visit to England in 1621, he left to perfect his technique in Italy before returning to Flanders and working as a court painter. The accession of Charles I of England was timely, the King and Queen being keen on patronising grand portraiture that glorified the aristocracy. In 1632, he moved to London, being immediately adopted into court circles and earning good money for his considerable output, which generally flattered the sitter. In addition to a house at Blackfriars, he was rewarded with a suite of rooms at Eltham Palace, which he used as his Kentish retreat. By way of acknowledgement, Charles had van Dyck buried in St Paul’s Cathedral.\n\nCharles I, King of England (1600-49)\n\nCharles Stuart’s reign started promisingly. Three months after his accession, he spent a fortnight in Kent, travelling to Dover to meet his French bride Henrietta Maria and bring her back via Canterbury and Cobham Manor. Cheering Protestant crowds didn’t know that he’d already betrayed them, having signed a secret agreement with her father to relax constraints on English Catholics, and to lend ships for controlling French Huguenots. It wasn’t just his father’s empathy that Charles lacked. Despite his obvious incompetence in both domestic and foreign affairs, he continued to rule high-handedly. Being divinely appointed, he reasoned, he should run his land according to his own conscience. When he first abolished the Short Parliament, and later botched an effort to arrest five MPs in the Long Parliament, popular loyalty deserted him. He ended up at war with the Parliaments of both England and his native Scotland. When, convicted of treason, he was beheaded at Whitehall, the crowd only groaned.\n\nMajor-General David Leslie, 1st Lord Newark (~1600-ca 1682)\n\nThe lordly Scottish general David Leslie from Fife went to fight in the Thirty Years’ War in 1630, serving mostly with the Swedish Army and briefly under the Russian Tsar. He returned to Scotland to join the Bishops’ Wars in 1640, only to learn the fighting was over. Instead he fought with the Scottish allies of the English Parliament, excelling against Charles I at Marston Moor (1644). The victory he won at Philiphaugh (1645) was tainted by his massacre of 400 Irish soldiers, women, and children; and, in operations against the Highland Royalists, he presided over the slaughter of 300 MacDonalds. The Scots then performed a volte-face, calculating that Charles might benefit their political agenda better. Leslie led them against Cromwell at Dunbar (1650) and Worcester (1651), and was routed both times. He was held in prison in the Tower, but permitted by Cromwell on humanitarian grounds to visit the Tunbridge Wells spa. He survived well into the Restoration.\n\nHenrietta Maria, Queen of England (1609-69)\n\nConsidering all that had gone before in English history, Charles I’s choice of bride must be adjudged typically ill-advised. First, Henriette Marie was the daughter of a Bourbon and a Medici, and neither family was ever Anglophile. Second, she had a devout Catholic’s hostility to Protestant ceremony, for which reason she courted unpopularity by refusing to be crowned. Third, she was an obstreperous 15-year-old when they married; the two even got into an argument as he was collecting her from Dover. She disliked being called Queen Mary, signing herself ‘Henriette R’ even though Charles named Maryland after her. She liked little about England, except maybe the fashionable new spa near Tunbridge (sic), where she went to recover after childbirth. Her extravagant spending and overtly anti-Protestant sympathies steadily cemented public antipathy, which turned to hatred as she urged Charles towards Civil War. After voluntary exile, she returned briefly during the Restoration. She died in Paris of an overdose.\n\nThomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1612-71)\n\nAn intriguing question in alternative history is what course the world would have taken if Black Tom – so named after his dark hair and eyes – had fought in the Civil War not for Parliament but alongside the outstanding Prince Rupert. After all, he owed his title to the monarchy; his feisty wife, daughter of his former commander in the Dutch Revolt, was an ardent royalist; and he even looked far more Cavalier than Roundhead. Instead, he helped his father defeat the King at Marston Moor (1644), took command of the victorious New Model Army at Naseby (1645), and conclusively triumphed at Maidstone (1648). More reformer than regicide, however, he refused to sign the King’s death warrant, and opposed his friend Oliver Cromwell’s pursuit of absolute power, creating a rift that prompted his return to Yorkshire. After Cromwell’s death, he joined George Monck in putting down a republican army, and led the mission to bring Charles II home in 1660.\n\nPhilibert, Count de Gramont (1621-1707)\n\nA scion of an aristocratic French family, de Gramont flourished during the reign of Louis XIV. Though an able soldier, he made the mistake of wooing a royal mistress, and in 1662 was exiled. He took to the court of Charles II, however, where speaking French was the fashion, and the dissolute lifestyle of courtiers was just his jug of claret. Among others, he courted the sister of Antoine Hamilton, an aristocratic Irishman who had lived since a young age in France. When affairs grew complicated, de Gramont tried to sneak out of England, but was intercepted at Dover by Hamilton and his brother and coaxed into honouring his obligations. Having married her, he was allowed home in 1664, and eventually died in Paris. He might have been forgotten, but for Hamilton’s racy bestseller ‘Mémoires de la vie du comte de Grammont’ (1713), which purported to have been dictated by the old rake himself.\n\nCharles II, King of England (1630-85)\n\nCharles Stuart the Younger famously stayed overnight at what is now called Restoration House in Rochester on his way back from exile. After 11 dismal years of Cromwell’s Commonwealth, Londoners hailed his proclamation as monarch the next day with the customary optimism that things can only get better. In truth, they only got worse. The Restoration was a riotous time, at least for Charles and his cronies. After making a worthless marriage, he spent his debauched existence fathering a succession of bastards by his various mistresses, whom he was happy to flaunt before his wife. After initially taking pains not to make the same political mistakes as his father, he grew increasingly tyrannical with age. When Parliament made moves to prevent his Catholic brother’s succession, he reverted to Tudor barbarity in dealing with the perpetrators. Charles survived the Rye House Plot in 1683, but died of kidney failure two years later. He reportedly converted to Catholicism on his deathbed.\n\nSamuel Pepys (1633-1703)\n\nAlthough John Evelyn’s diary covered a much longer period and is a more useful historical resource, Pepys’s is better known today. The simple reason is that it’s a far racier read. It covered only the 1660s, but Pepys cannot have guessed what an extraordinary decade it would be – the Restoration, Second Dutch War, Great Plague, Great Fire of London – all of which he experienced at first hand. Though a Londoner, he had many connections with Deptford, Greenwich, and Chatham as a senior Royal Navy administrator. A more prurient reason for reading Pepys’s diary, however, is its candid account of his sexual encounters, many the consequence of exploiting his official positions, that became known once the code he wrote it in was broken. Anyone wondering why England progressed in a generation from Merry Monarch to Glorious Revolution can discern from Pepys the joyful cant and hypocrisy at the heart of the Restoration.\n\nJames II, King of England (1633-1701)\n\nThe Exclusion Bill was Parliament’s attempt to prevent the succession of Charles II’s resolutely Catholic brother, James. The two royals turned savagely on its supporters, and the so-called Whigs’ worst fears were realised when James Stuart became king. Immediately, two revolts arose, including one by his nephew the Duke of Monmouth; both were put down. James, having learned nothing from his father, adopted the strategy of systematically inserting Catholics – who represented only 2% of the population – into key positions of influence, including the judiciary. It stirred a massive populist backlash. When a Catholic heir was born, and James then prosecuted seven Anglican bishops, Parliament moved to replace him with his Anglican daughter Mary. To that end, her husband William of Orange was invited in 1688 to invade England. The friendless James fled, but was captured by fishermen at Faversham. Though released, he was beaten the following year at the Battle of the Boyne, and disappeared into exile.\n\nCatherine of Braganza, Queen of England (1638-1705)\n\nIf those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, King Charles II must have had an incredibly short memory. His own mother had demonstrated that a C17 Queen of England ought not to speak poor English, deplore Protestantism, dislike English manners, and so be publicly loathed; but that’s what Charles imported when he wed Catarina de Bragança in 1662. It was a political arrangement, meant to strengthen ties with Portugal; and Charles made no bones about his intention to continue womanising relentlessly. Catherine did differ in two essentials from her mother-in-law. Where Queen Henrietta loved to spend money profligately, Queen Catherine preferred to accumulate it; and the former gave England two worthless sons, whilst the latter remained childless, despite numerous resorts to the magical waters of the Tunbridge spa. Catherine became a main target of the scurrilous Popish Plot, but lingered for seven years after the King’s death in the hope of winning a law-suit.\n\nWilliam Penn the Younger (1644-1718)\n\nWilliam Penn was a stereotypical rebel: an elder son living in the shadow of a rich and distinguished father who had high hopes for him. Strict and humourless, he was drawn to religious non-conformism. At 22, he joined the Quakers, and undertook an evangelical tour of Kent in 1672. With his subversive writings, he antagonised the authorities even more than his father, and was repeatedly gaoled. His life changed when he inherited a fortune in debts owed by the Crown. King Charles II cunningly discharged them by gifting Penn 45,000 square miles of America, provided that he took his troublesome Quakers with him. Penn whimsically named his new province Sylvania, and Charles pointedly added the prefix ‘Penn’ in honour of the father. Young Penn preached tolerance for religious and ethnic minorities, a melting-pot, and centralised government, so setting the tone for modern American Democratic discourse. He died penniless back in England, and his sons renounced his beliefs.\n\nWilliam III, King of Great Britain & Ireland (1650-1702)\n\nMary Stuart’s son, and Charles I’s grandson, was born William III of Orange, his father having died just before. He distinguished himself as a military leader capable of taking on the might of France’s tyrannical Sun King, Louis XIV. Though this made him a champion of Protestantism, suspicions remained about this Dutchman even after he married James II’s Protestant daughter Mary in 1677. Nevertheless, eleven years later, the Immortal Seven invited him to invade England and curtail James’s Catholic regime. James was duly deposed, his son James denied the succession, and William and Mary made joint sovereigns. William, who would stay at Quex House in Birchington whenever waiting to sail for Holland, enjoyed a surge in popularity when a Jacobite plot to assassinate him was exposed in 1696, two years after Mary’s death. The Act of Settlement (1701) secured the Hanoverian dynasty’s succession, ushering in a new century that, after the calamitous C17, was to prove England’s zenith.\n\nCaptain Kidd (1655-1701)\n\nCaptain William Kidd, a Scot, was an accidental pirate. He’d been doing good business in the Caribbean as a privateer when he was summoned in 1695 to take on a mission for a syndicate led by William III. After his ship Adventure Galley set off from Deptford, he was challenged to lower his flag in deference to a Royal Navy yacht at Greenwich. To emphasise the point, a warning shot was fired. His crew responded by showing the yacht their buttocks. So enraged was the Navy captain that he removed many of them. Kidd was forced to take on replacements in New York, most of whom were outright blackguards. The crew often came close to mutiny, and eventually compelled Kidd to capture a ship illegally off Africa. Back home, he was charged with piracy. The King’s involvement was diplomatically overlooked, and Kidd was hanged at Wapping. He was actually hanged twice; the first time, the rope broke.\n\nMary II, Queen of England (1662-94)\n\nMary Stuart was at the centre of one of the most dramatic transformations in English history. Her father was the Duke of York, the future James II, who with his wife Anne converted to Catholicism. Mary, however, had been raised a Protestant by order of her uncle, Charles II. After marrying her cousin William of Orange in 1677, she sailed to Holland with him via Erith, Sheerness, and Margate after long delays due to foul weather. When James was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688-9, however, she and William were placed on the throne ahead of James’s son, the ‘Old Pretender’, and returned to England. She played second fiddle to her dynamic husband, now William III, but stepped up to the mark in his absence. Her most enduring achievement was the establishment of the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich. At 32, she succumbed to that scourge of the Stuarts, smallpox, while still childless.\n\nAnne, Queen of Great Britain & Ireland (1665-1714)\n\nAlthough best remembered today for lending her name to the light, elegant style of furniture with distinctive cabriole legs, Queen Anne was a pivotal figure in British history. Raised a Protestant, she married George of Denmark in 1683. She went to Tunbridge Wells the following year to recover from a stillbirth, and twenty years later stayed at Lenham’s Dog & Bear Hotel, which still bears a royal crest, she having succeeded her brother-in-law William III in 1702. The Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707, motivated by the latter’s bankrupt state after the Darien disaster, made her the first Queen of the United Kingdom. What is more, because she left behind no Stuart heir despite 17 pregnancies, the throne fell into the lap of her second-cousin George I, initiating the Hanoverian dynasty. Increasingly fat and frumpy with age, Anne’s happy marriage and Tory sympathies made her an unlikely target for lesbian re-imagining in ‘The Favourite’ (2018).\n\nPeter the Great, Tsar of Russia (1672-1725)\n\nPeter the Great was that rarity among tsars, one who made a positive difference. When he succeeded his half-brother Feodor III in 1682, Russia was a backwater, regarded more as part of Asia than Europe. After an abortive adventure against the Ottomans in the Black Sea, Peter understood that he needed to emulate Dutch and English naval power. Having befriended William III, he came to Kent to study English seamanship. He stayed for three months at Sayes Court in Deptford, also visiting Greenwich and Woolwich. His unruly entourage did so much damage – using paintings for target practice, and racing wheelbarrows around the gardens – that the Treasury had to pay the regular tenant damages. Peter reaped the benefit when Russia smashed Sweden in the Great Northern War, permanently changing the Nordic balance of power. His lasting monument is the city he founded, St Petersburg: not only Russia’s gateway to the Baltic, but also a shining symbol of modernity.\n\nHandel (1685-1759)\n\nGeorg Friedrich Händel, born in Saxony-Anhalt, composed the first of his 42 operas at 19. In 1711, he wrote ‘Rinaldo’ specially for Vanbrugh’s Queen’s Theatre, and so began transforming the musical landscape of England. The following year, he immigrated to London. Five years later, when the new Hanoverian king George I requested a concert on the Thames, Handel presented his well-received ‘Water Music’. Then, for George II’s coronation in 1727, he wrote ‘Zadok the Priest’, which has been performed at every coronation since. Handel repeatedly visited fashionable Tunbridge Wells, repairing to the spa when he fell sick at 52. In 1742, he composed his ‘Messiah’, whose ‘Hallelujah Chorus’ remains one of the great showstoppers. There followed ‘Music for the Royal Fireworks’ (1749), yet another success. Having been a naturalised Briton since 1727, he enjoyed hero status on account of his vast patriotic output, and was accorded a state funeral at Westminster Abbey.\n\nJohn Harrison (1693-1776)\n\nThe Scilly Isles Naval Disaster of 1707 highlighted seafarers’ inability to establish their exact position at sea. So catastrophic was it that, in 1713, the Government offered a reward for an accurate means of establishing a ship’s longitude, a major intellectual as well as technical challenge. John Harrison, an inventive clockmaker, made it his lifetime’s work. In 1730, he came to Greenwich to show the Astronomer Royal a marine clock he had designed; but, although Edmond Halley was highly supportive, he could only refer the unsophisticated Yorkshireman to a master clockmaker, George Graham, who was to support him handsomely for decades. Harrison eventually devised a fourth marine chronometer that, when tested on HMS Deptford on a voyage to Jamaica in 1761-2, proved accurate to within a mile. Despite having qualified for the full reward, he was denied half the money; but his invention revolutionised seafaring and brought about the Prime Meridian. He is now commemorated in John Harrison Way, Greenwich.\n\nVoltaire (1694-1778)\n\nThe Parisian philosopher and wit François-Marie Arouet, alias Voltaire, was the champion of the Enlightenment against the tyranny of Louis XIV and the Catholic Church. A prolific writer, he penned tens of thousands of letters, but also thousands of literary works, crowned by ‘Candide, ou l’Optimisme’ (1759), a satirical critique of injustice that still resonates. Exiled in 1726, he resorted to the land of the free, England, whose constitutional monarchy and embrace of personal liberties impressed him inordinately. He befriended many influential sympathisers, and on one occasion went to admire the civilised behaviour of Kentish folk at Greenwich Fair in its pre-Victorian days. His first major prose work, ‘Letters on the English’ (1733), proved “the first bomb thrown at the Ancien Régime”, as a French historian asserted. “Thus we may say, perhaps,” an American professor added, “that the French Revolution began when Voltaire stepped on English shores, probably at Dover, on a sunny day in May 1726”.\n\nCanaletto (1697-1768)\n\nCanaletto is not so named because he enjoyed painting the canals of his native Venice, but because his real name, by coincidence, was Giovanni Canal. He was not only a master of Venetian waterscapes, but of city squares too; and he worked with precision at such a rate that he created a unique pictorial record of C18 Venice. At the time, the British consul was Joseph Smith, who took Canaletto under his wing to their mutual benefit. Canaletto came to England from 1746 to 1755, continuing his work with panoramas of London and elsewhere. He also strayed down the Thames, where he painted magnificent views of Greenwich Hospital. Aside from his playful ‘caprices’, Canaletto recorded what he saw faithfully, and both early and late in his career preferred to paint in situ rather than at his studio. His particular talent was for deviating subtly from photographic realism, for which reason he is recognised as a forerunner of Impressionism.\n\nWilliam Hogarth (1697-1764)\n\nAfter Hogarth’s father spent time in gaol for indebtedness, the London-born artist’s social consciousness not unnaturally added a satirical edge to his prodigious creative talent. He first became an engraver, which helped develop his eye for extreme detail, a skill he enhanced by earning a living as a portraitist. He won fame in 1731-2 with ‘The Harlot’s Progress’, equating to a highly artistic and wittily observed series of cartoons lampooning contemporary social mores. In May 1732, the now celebrated young artist joined four mates on their own version of the Grand Tour, a five-day jaunt around the Hoo Peninsula, Isle of Sheppey, and Medway towns; their laddish “peregrinations” were recorded in an account now held by the British Museum, and commemorated by the Hogarth Inn at Grain. In 1735 Hogarth confirmed his reputation with ‘The Rake’s Progress’, followed by ‘Marriage A-la-mode’ (1743-5) and several striking sets of prints. He ended his days in bucolic comfort at Chiswick.\n\nJohn Wesley (1703-91)\n\nJohn Wesley from Lincolnshire went down in history as an evangelist of Methodism. Once the dust had settled on the schism between Catholicism and Protestantism, the opportunity arose for a C18 ‘Revival’ movement, supposed to reinvigorate the Anglican Church with “Christian perfection”. As the differences between rival positions such as Wesley’s and Calvin’s were so subtle as to appear abstruse, the onus was on preachers like Wesley to proselytise by strength of character and force of rhetoric. In this, Wesley was remarkably effective. Initially barred from teaching in churches, he took to streets and houses. A frequent visitor to The Limes in Lewisham, he particularly favoured the house in Rolvenden Layne, now Wesley House, where he was arrested in 1760. On account of their sheer fervour, fellow Methodists became disproportionately influential in British political issues, including the slave trade and prison reform. Methodism was disseminated with such vigour around the British Empire that it still has around 80 million adherents.\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-90)\n\nBenjamin Franklin – polymath, Founding Father, all-round marvel – exemplifies the principle that history written by victors is seldom good history. The son of English Quakers, he illicitly quit his brother’s business in Boston to work in Philadelphia on newspapers that made money from advertising slaves. He fulminated against tyranny while himself being a slave-owner. Much of his journalism was moralistic invention. He took a common-law wife who was already married, but separately had a bastard son who so deplored his father’s beliefs that he quit America. Franklin also whiled away many years in England. Whilst genially debating colonial affairs with Pitt the Younger at Hayes Place, he fomented revolution through his mouthpiece Thomas Paine. While in Kent, he heard about Gray’s electricity experiments, later laying claim to the theory with his lightning stunt. All these points, incidentally, have been made in American books. Had the rebels lost the war, Franklin would have been hanged as a traitor and forgotten.\n\nCapability Brown (1715-83)\n\nLancelot Brown from Northumberland got his nickname from his habit of telling prospective clients that their property offered “capability” for improvement. Although he dabbled in architecture, his forte was garden design, in which he came to excel. In fact, he was such a dab hand at it that he earned the best part of a million pounds a year in today’s money. The secret of his success was the landscape form of garden design popularised by his tutor, William Kent, that replaced C17 formality. Brown’s designs were typified by lawns running right up to buildings, lakes fed by hidden streams, and clumps of trees scattered about. The romantics of the next century came to hate his formulaic style; but Brown had left his mark on 170 properties around the country. Many of them were very famous, and five were in Kent: Chilham Castle, Ingress Abbey, Leeds Abbey, North Cray Place, and Valence near Westerham.\n\nHorace Walpole (1717-97)\n\nHoratio Walpole, the 4th Earl of Orford, was the only son of Britain’s first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. Not surprisingly, after following his father to Cambridge, he became a Whig MP for nearly three decades, representing three different constituencies. Yet it was as an author that he made his name. He was a prolific writer of letters, which have been published in 40 volumes, containing much of political and social interest. In his forties, he wrote ‘The Castle of Otranto’, a medieval thriller. It was in fact the first Gothic novel, and would inspire the likes of EA Poe and Bram Stoker. Walpole was fascinated by medievalism, to the extent that he’d had an extraordinary mock-Gothic castle, Strawberry Hill House, built near Twickenham. Among his friends, the lifelong bachelor Walpole counted Edward Mann, owner of the altogether more traditional Linton Park, south of Maidstone; Walpole was a keen visitor.\n\nSamuel Foote (1720-77)\n\nWith a first cousin who was insane, and one uncle who murdered another over a will, Foote unsurprisingly behaved like he had a screw loose. The son of a Cornish MP, he was sent down from Oxford, and joined the theatre in London. He had a talent for making people laugh, being a superlative mimic, and was responsible for numerous satirical productions, some of them highly successful. The trouble was that, apart from playing fast and loose with both money and the law, he got his laughs by expertly ridiculing real people. One hilarious example was ‘The Author’ (1757), which ridiculed the literary patron John Apreece so excruciatingly that he got it banned. In fact, Foote made enemies galore who devoted themselves to avenging themselves, and after losing a leg in a riding accident was lampooned as the ‘Devil on Two Sticks’. His only lasting legacy was the expression ‘Grand Panjandrum’. He died at Dover en route to France.\n\nJohn Smeaton (1724-92)\n\nA lawyer’s son from Yorkshire, John Smeaton became an instrument-maker. He showed such precocious talent in his twenties – designing for example a pyrometer to measure expansion – that he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1753, and then won the Copley Medal. His fertile mind’s fruits included cement hardened by water, a water-engine and watermill, and Seaton’s coefficient for calculating lift, later refined by the Wright brothers. He made his fortune from engineering projects, however, and founded the Society of Civil Engineers, so named to differentiate their discipline from the military skills taught at Woolwich. Though his most famous achievement was Eddystone Lighthouse in Cornwall, later rebuilt on Plymouth Hoe as ‘Smeaton’s Tower’, he undertook many years of ingenious and painstaking work at Ramsgate to establish a viable harbour and jetty, even pioneering the use of a new form of diving bell. He was mentioned in a 2004 Kaiser Chiefs song as an emblem of better times.\n\nJoseph Priestley (1733-1804)\n\nAlthough best remembered for scientific discoveries, Yorkshireman Joseph Priestley was primarily a man of the cloth. A Calvinist dissenter, he became interested in physical laws in the belief that better knowledge of God’s work would improve the human lot. In addition to inventing carbonated water in 1767, he discovered the existence of gases, among them oxygen – which he called ‘de-phlogisticated air’ – in 1774. That same year he attended a Unitarian meeting in Tenterden with Benjamin Franklin, whom he had consulted whilst writing ‘The History and Present State of Electricity’ (1767). His scientific credibility was ultimately undermined by his dogged adherence to phlogiston theory; but it was his political beliefs that brought him public opprobrium. A supporter of the American and French Revolutions, he wrote a critique of Burke’s anti-revolutionary tract ‘Reflections on the French Revolution’ that had a mob up in arms, and his house and church in Birmingham were burned. He fled to America, and died in Pennsylvania.\n\nGeorge III, King of England (1738-1820)\n\nSince he had what it takes to rule Great Britain for nearly 60 years – then a record – it’s a pity that George III is only remembered now for two things: losing his American colonies, and losing his marbles. There’s no denying that Mad King George had a serious problem: he suffered from an illness, possibly porphyry, that increasingly debilitated him. Yet, in his time, the nation underwent the Industrial Revolution, defeated France in the Seven Years’ War, and overcame the mortal threat of Napoleon. In 1778, he stayed at Leeds Castle with Queen Charlotte when visiting an Army camp, but his most conspicuous visit to Kent entailed an occasion in 1799 when Lord Romney invited the royal family to his estate at Mote Park in Maidstone. By 1810, however, George’s mind was so far gone that his son had to rule as Prince Regent throughout his last decade.\n\nField Marshall von Blücher (1742-1819)\n\nAsk any German who won the Battle of Waterloo and you’ll get one answer: Blücher. By their account, Wellington was hanging on by his fingernails when the Prussians arrived like the US cavalry to win the day. However one regards it, his arrival was most welcome, if a little tardy. Gebhard von Blücher was born in Rostock, and ironically was taken prisoner by the Prussian Army in 1760 while fighting for Sweden. He became the outstanding Prussian general, taking on Napoleon more times than any other and matching him for belligerence. In 1814, after decisively defeating the French army at Leipzig, Blücher was invited to Britain to celebrate Napoleon’s abdication, along with several other allied war-leaders. After landing at Dover, they were given a sumptuous reception, which included visiting the Woolwich Arsenal. Unfortunately, the festivities were premature. Within months, Napoleon would escape and form a new army that was to test Blücher’s determination one last time.\n\nJames Wyatt (1746-1813)\n\nAt 15, Staffordshire-born Wyatt went for six years to Italy where, as part of his architectural education, he had the misfortune to be slung on a ladder 300 feet up in St Peter’s Basilica without protection. Having survived, he was handed a golden break by his brother, by whose efforts he was commissioned to design the Pantheon in Oxford Street, described by Horace Walpole as England’s loveliest building. He went on to win scores of further commissions, including several Oxford colleges, and in Kent alone designed Hothfield Place, Lee Priory, and Sundridge Park, as well as the Royal Arsenal, Royal Artillery Barracks, and Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He also undertook numerous radical alterations to historic buildings, earning him the sobriquet ‘Wyatt the Destroyer’ – which perhaps explains his surprising anonymity compared with his contemporaries Nash and the Adams brothers. Briefly president of the Royal Academy of Arts, he died after a road accident, and was buried at Westminster Abbey.\n\nFanny Burney (1752-1840)\n\nBorn into a well-to-do musician’s family in Norfolk, Frances Burney took up writing fiction in her twenties. Her first novel, a three-volume effort called ‘Evelina’ (1778), was published under a pseudonym, though her identity came out. It concerned the experiences of a well-born young woman making her way in Georgian society, observed with a sardonic eye that evidently impressed Jane Austen a generation later. Other novels followed, plus dramas that were mostly ignored in Burney’s lifetime. Her most valuable output was the journals she commenced at 15 and maintained for 72 years. They covered everything from a visit to Knole Park, Sevenoaks in 1783 to an excruciating mastectomy she underwent at 59. Burney served as Queen Charlotte‘s Keeper of the Robes before becoming Madame d’Arblay, the wife of a French general, and being exiled in France for a decade because of Napoleon’s war with Britain. She later settled in Bath, and died at a ripe old age.\n\nGeneral Count Matvei Ivanovich Platov (1753-1818)\n\nAmong the dignitaries who arrived at Dover in 1814 to celebrate the provisional defeat of Napoleon was Count Platov, general of the Don Cossacks throughout the Napoleonic Wars, who was escorting the much younger tsar Alexander I. Hailing from southern Russia, he had joined the Cossacks at 12, fought in several campaigns, and become their ataman (commander) in 1801. At the pivotal battle of Borodino in 1812, his attack on the French left so discomfited Napoleon that he fatefully withheld his elite Imperial Guard. The crucial import of this was only appreciated later, however, and Platov temporarily lost face following Russia’s apparent defeat. Then, however, he harassed the Grande Armée all the way back to France, with devastating effect. By the time he visited Kent, he was a household name, albeit misspelt Platoff, and was commemorated in paint at General Beresford’s expense. Had he been at Waterloo the following year, Napoleon’s fate might have been settled rather faster.\n\nTalleyrand (1754-1838)\n\nCharles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord was Tony Blair without the principles. He started as a churchman and, as a bishop, joined the États Généraux, where he cynically pontificated against the Church. He fled for England when Robespierre took over, but was obliged to return in 1794 when fellow refugees turned against him. He ingratiated himself with Napoleon, who saw him as a weapon in international negotiations, even though he secretly worked against Napoleon’s interests. The interests that concerned him most were his own, especially living in splendour at Valençay and siring dozens of illegitimate children. His greatest achievement was brilliantly saving France from dismemberment at the Congress of Vienna in 1814-5, which made his reputation as the world’s craftiest diplomat. Afterwards, he was sidelined during the reign of Charles X, but returned in 1830 as Ambassador to Great Britain. He relished being greeted at Dover by tricolour-waving crowds and a cannonade, 36 years after returning to revolutionary France under a cloud.\n\nGeneral von Bülow (1755-1816)\n\nAlthough Blücher is synonymous with the Prussian Army at Waterloo, the contribution of Friedrich Wilhelm, Freiherr von Bülow, cannot be underrated. He was a career soldier who worked his way up through the ranks with aplomb. Strangely, he first came to the attention of Frederick the Great through his musical ability, which won’t have hindered his assiduous pursuit of a military career. Von Bülow distinguished himself as a general late in the Napoleonic Wars, when he excelled in the defence of Berlin, and then in the crucial defeat of the French at Leipzig. He did not always get on with Blücher, there inevitably being rivalry between these two great contemporaneous Prussian generals; but he served the Field Marshall well in the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. He came to Kent for the victory celebrations that June, before adding further to his personal glory at Waterloo, where his brigade played a crucial role in finishing off the Grande Armée.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-91)\n\nHaving been born into a wealthy family at Salzburg, Austria, Mozart developed a precocious musical ability that became unmistakable when he wrote his first symphony at 8. As his older sister Nannerl was also a talented pianist, their composer father Leopold took them on a European tour so that the children could perform for high society. From April 1764 they spent more than 15 months in England, including a few days in Kent when Mozart performed at Canterbury. They stayed at Bourne House as guests of Sir Horatio Mann, and possibly also Egerton House and Higham Park. Young Mozart went on to become arguably the greatest composer in history, responsible for 600 works including 22 operas and dozens of symphonies. Plagued by money troubles, however, he was hit by depression and then illness. He died suddenly at 35, and was buried in an unmarked grave. We can only imagine what musical wonders he might have produced in his maturity.\n\nWilliam Blake (1757-1827)\n\nWilliam Blake was one of the giants of the Romantic era, excelling not only in painting but also poetry. He was quite possibly mad; certainly his contemporaries thought so. He was at first a painter, and his work so highly original that it inevitably suggested a diseased mind, though today we might see in it a forerunner of Surrealism a hundred years before its time. His first great poetic work ‘Songs of Innocence and of Experience’, illustrated by himself, dwells on the corrupting influence of society on human simplicity. The young Blake took a positive view of both the French and American revolutions, something he came to regret in later life. It is ironic that his most famous work ‘Jerusalem’ is now a great patriotic anthem; it was in fact the product of his deep religious faith. Late in life, Blake came to Shoreham near Sevenoaks to visit the Brotherhood of Ancients, a group of young artists who idolised him.\n\nThomas Telford (1757-1834)\n\nThomas Telford was a titan of the golden era of Scottish civil engineering. He was born at Eskdale, close to the English border, and lived in poverty after the early death of his father, a shepherd. He became a stonemason, but made his reputation with a broad variety of engineering tasks that he undertook in Shropshire. Eventually he proved himself so versatile that his friend Robert Southey, the future poet laureate, called him the ‘Colossus of Roads’. In 1830 he came to Kent to build the Whitstable Harbour station at the terminus of the new Canterbury and Whitstable railway line, a project that attracted a galaxy of engineering stars including himself, George and Robert Stephenson, and even IK Brunel. Such was Telford’s mastery of civil engineering that he became the first president of its Institution, remaining so for 14 years. When in 1968 a new town was built in Shropshire, it was naturally named after him.\n\nNelson (1758-1805)\n\nAlthough Horatio Nelson was born in Norfolk, Kentish people always treated him as one of their own. Chatham was still central to Britain’s naval might, so Nelson was a regular visitor; and his most famous ship, HMS Victory, was built there. Despite his obvious seamanship, Nelson took a beating in a land assault at Tenerife in 1797, but showed his character by corresponding chivalrously with the defending general afterwards. He subsequently proved himself master of the sea, winning one major victory after another. His tactical genius was matched by his ability to get the most out of his men by keeping them fully in the picture, contrary to the custom of the day. His adulterous relationship with Lady Hamilton and ill-treatment of his wife, though shameful, were publicly tolerated because of his sheer popularity. After losing first an eye and then an arm in battle, Admiral Nelson famously lost his life at Trafalgar at the moment of his greatest triumph.\n\nWilliam Wilberforce (1759-1833)\n\nWilberforce was born in Yorkshire, the son of a wealthy merchant. After enjoying a sybaritic lifestyle, he was elected MP for Hull. In 1785, after a European tour, he underwent a Damascene conversion, becoming an evangelical Christian. A year later, he was approached by a group of abolitionists asking him to take up leadership of their cause. Despite being deeply conservative, he agreed, and maintained the struggle for nearly five decades. He was aided by his close friend Pitt the Younger, to whom he expressed his ambition to end slavery by political means at Holwood House near Bromley in 1787. He incurred the wrath of William Cobbett – the radical who believed that charity begins at home – for championing the rights of foreigners whilst doing nothing for the British working class. Nevertheless, in 1807, the Slave Trade Act was passed. Wilberforce died three days after the Slavery Abolition Act finally killed off slavery in the British Empire.\n\nThe Rennies\n\nA farmer’s son from the Scottish Lowlands, John Rennie (1761-1821) displayed an early talent for mechanics, and studied at Edinburgh University. Initially a millwright, he proved himself as an innovator, especially in substituting cast-iron parts in machinery for wooden ones. He got a place working for James Watt in Shropshire, and in 1791 set up his own engineering business in London. He specialised in canals before moving onto bridges – including his chef d’oeuvre, Waterloo Bridge – as well as lighthouses and harbours. His son, also John (1794-1874), was born in Surrey and educated at Dr Burney’s, Greenwich. He proved a chip off the old block, building the 1825 London Bridge his father had designed before his death, then becoming an innovator in his own right. The two are noted for numerous works in Kent, including at Chatham Dockyard, Ramsgate, Sheerness, and Woolwich, albeit that Rennie senior was unable to save the doomed Chetney Hill project.\n\nWilliam IV, King of the United Kingdom & Ireland (1765-1837)\n\nAs George III’s third son, William possibly expected never to reign. At 13, he joined the Royal Navy, seeing action in the American Revolution and serving under his friend Nelson in the West Indies. Then, after becoming the Duke of Clarence in 1789, he took the Irish actress and courtesan Dorothea Bland, alias Mrs Jordan, as his mistress; she bore ten illegitimate offspring, all surnamed FitzClarence, during a 20-year relationship. An occasional guest at Sacketts Hill House in Thanet when travelling to Hanover, he commissioned a monument to his old colleague Rear-Admiral William Fox at Ramsgate church in 1811. Seven years after abandoning Bland, he married Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, whose four babies all died. On succeeding his elder brother George IV as William IV in 1830, he resisted the Reform Act and contested abolitionism, claiming from experience that even Highlanders were worse off than Caribbean slaves. Lacking a legitimate heir, the ‘Sailor King’ was succeeded by his niece, Victoria.\n\nMarshal General Jean-de-Dieu Soult, 1st Duke of Dalmatia (1769-1851)\n\nFor a future military hero and political eminence, Soult came from an unlikely background, his father being a notary in Occitania in the far south of France. After joining the French Army at 16, he was able to progress rapidly during the revolutionary era. Already chief of staff at the pivotal Battle of Fleurus in 1794, he was a general by the time of Napoleon’s 1799 putsch. After excelling at Austerlitz in 1805, he was placed in charge of the Peninsular War, winning initial success before Wellington drove the French out. Despite renouncing republicanism following Napoleon’s abdication, Soult was his chief of staff at Waterloo in 1815. Following exile, he returned to take up politics as a monarchist, and in 1838 deputised for Louis-Philippe at a Grand Review at Woolwich dockyard. Despite serving three times as prime minister of France, the chameleonic Soult again declared himself a republican following the February Revolution in 1848.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III, King of Prussia (1770-1840)\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III, König von Preußen may sound a grand personage, but he was in fact far too diffident ever to be a ruler. This was surprising, given that his grandfather was Frederick the Great, Germany’s finest ever monarch; but, there again, his father had been a pleasure-seeker and just the wrong man to have in charge when the French Revolution started. Luckily, the indecisive King’s wife was Queen Luise, who was not only beautiful but also so smart that Napoleon called her Prussia’s best minister. She died suddenly in 1810, but by then had galvanised a group of able commanders who would ultimately turn the tables on the French. The King came to Kent in 1814 with his best general, Blücher, to celebrate Napoleon’s defeat, thus sharing the glory of the true hero. Friedrich Wilhelm would rule for another quarter century, and his son Wilhelm would become the first Kaiser of the united Germany.\n\nWilliam Wordsworth (1770-1850)"
