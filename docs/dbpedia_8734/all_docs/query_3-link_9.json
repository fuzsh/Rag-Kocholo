Subject of analysis is book Expanded Cinema on example of what we can reveal Youngblood's method. Except revealing of a method, potentially suitable for the analysis of different directions inside video art , possibility of the task of a point between cinema and video is of interest; that allows us to apply tools of the analysis developed in the theory of cinema to narrative videos. Also article contains the short review of the ideas stated in the investigated book concerning the nature of video and problems which artists of video, cinema and theater put before themselves in California in 60s, at the beginning of video art, and their correlation with work of the Russian artists in 90's.\n\nThe phrase “psychic public space” sounds awkward and strange but this is how I want to define the results of the work of some Hollywood directors.

Siegfried Kracauer wrote that cinema has the possibility not only to redeem the physical reality but also to reproduce the psychic states. In his book “Theory of Film”, he quoted Luis Bunuel’s words that films possess three kinds of revealing functions: “They tend to reveal things normally unseen; phenomena overwhelming consciousness; and certain aspects of the outer world which may be called “special modes of reality”.\n\n\"THE POSITION OF NARRATIVE VIDEOS IN THE CONTEMPORARY ART The article is dedicated to modes of representation of the narrative video art typical for 2000th.

These installations “flirt” with spectators, erasing the borders between video and cinema. The author analyzes some methods of creation the video films by number of artists. One of the main characteristics of art narrative video is the possibility to demonstrate it on the different “territories”.\n\nВ тексте есть опечатка: М.Боумана (правильно - Боуман).\n\nCreating representations of space and international sensibility in \"The Red Tapes\" by Vito Acconci (1977) and \"Zidane A 21st Century Portrait\" by Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno (2006) Abstract: Author analyzes creating methods of... more\n\nCreating representations of space and international sensibility in \"The Red Tapes\" by Vito Acconci (1977) and \"Zidane A 21st Century Portrait\" by Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno (2006)\n\nAbstract: Author analyzes creating methods of representations of spaces in two pieces of video art and looks how video artists regulate distance between spectator and these closed worlds. Immersion and repulsion are main narrative elements. They give an opportunity to transmit sensibility of international subject.\n\nKeywords: video art, narrative, representation of space, system of contemporary art.\n\nYulian Mitev, Editor-in-Chief.

Chinese narrative video art (Wu Wenguang, Wang Jianwei, Yang Fudong, Cao Fei, etc.) is connected with the iconography of Socialist realism, mass and traditional cultures.
