Triethyl orthoformate (400 ml, 2.4mol) was then added over a period of 1 h at ambient temperature with vigorous stirring to give a clear solution and then a white solid formed after a while. The mixture was stirred overnight. The mixture was adjusted pH = 8 with saturated aqueous potassium carbonate. The precipitate was filtered off, the filtrate was evaporated and the residue was extracted with EA (1000 ml x 12). The combined organic phase was washed with saturated aqueous potassium carbonate (100 ml x 2) and water (200 ml), dried and concentrated. The crude was triturated (PE : EA = 10 : 1) to afford the target (190 g, yield: 85%) as a white solid. With thionyl chloride; trimethyl orthoformate It was prepared according to Scheme 1. To a suspension of adenosine (8.03 g, 30 mmol) in 100 mL dry acetone was added trimethyl orthoformate (2.4 mL), followed by SOCl2 (6.75 mL, 90 mmol) dropwise. After stirring overnight, the solid was filtered, dissolved in saturated NaHCO3, and neutralized to pH 7. The solid was collected by filtration, washed with ether (20 mL), and dried in vacuo to give 2′,3′-isopropylidene-N6-methyl-adenosine, to which (3.07 g, 10 mmol) in dry THF (20 mL) were added phthalimide (1.62 g, 11 mmol) and PPh3 (2.88 g, 11 mmol), followed by diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD, 1.08 g, 11 mmol). After 2.5 h, the white solid was filtered, washed with 20 mL of cold Et2O. The crude Mitsunobu product and hydrazine hydrate (2.4 mL, 50 mmol) were refluxed overnight in ethanol (20 mL). After cooling, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated to dryness. To the product (612 mg, 2.0 mmol) in THF (5 mL) were added Et3N (0.9 mL, 6.4 mmol) and ethyl bromoacetate (0.28 mL, 2.5 mmol). After stirring overnight, the resulting mixture was filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue oil thus obtained was dissolved in THF (10 mL) and cooled to -20° C., followed by addition of LiAlH4 (166 mg, 4.4 mmol). The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature over 2.5 h, quenched with saturated NaHCO3, and the product was extracted with 50 mL of EtOAc, washed successively with saturated NaHCO3, water, and saturated NaCl.

Aq. NH3 was then added and the solution concentrated in vacuo. The solution was cooled to-20°C and the resulting white precipitate of 2'3'-O- isopropylidene-adenosine collected and washed with acetone With Dess-Martin periodane; toluene-4-sulfonic acid at 20℃; With perchloric acid Adenosine 5′-H-Phosphonate Synthesis The synthesis approach for 135 can be seen in Scheme 4 (FIG. 4). First, adenosine was protected using a catalytic amount of perchloric acid in acetone to give 129. This was benzoylated at the 5′ position, as well as on the exocyclic amine, using benzoyl chloride (BzCl) in pyridine to afford 130. Here, it is also possible to form a compound with two Bz protecting groups on the exocyclic amine It was observed that this had started to form before the starting material was fully consumed, so the reaction was stopped. Varying conditions may be altered to optimize this procedure, including by moving forward with an adenosine compound obtaining three Bz protecting groups. Fully protected 130 then underwent acidic hydrolysis using dilute hydrochloric acid in dioxane to give 131. Again, this saw low crude yields. Compound 131 was selectively silylated at the 2′ position using tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and silver nitrate (AgNO3) in a mixture of pyridine and tetrahydrofuran. Compound 132 was then protected using dimethoxytrityl chloride in pyridine to give 133 with a crude yield of 88%, which was pushed forward to attempt the selective deprotection using 2N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in pyridine and methanol which failed. Compound 133 should be purified before going forward to ensure a single, pure product to test the reaction with. As stated before, the scheme could be modified as in the case of guanosine to remove the need to use an isopropylidene protecting group on the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls, which should reduce the number of steps used and increase the overall yields.

After a few initial minutes of stirring, the reaction mixture turns an orange-brown color and compounds begin to dissolve. Shortly after this, a white precipitate of compound 2 formed (). After 3 h the product was filtered, triturated by acetone (3*15 mL) and diethyl ether (3*15 mL) and dried overnight by vacuum. No further purification was necessary.
