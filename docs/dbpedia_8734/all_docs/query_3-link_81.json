        "text": "Author Archives:\n\nNina Ananiashvili, State Ballet of Georgia deliver Grand Prix performance\n\nEach time Nina Ananiashvili has appeared on the stage of Thalia Mara Hall in Jackson, Mississippi, she has been warmly welcomed by the ballet audience.\n\nHer first appearance was as a 23-year-old dancer participating in the 1986 USA International Ballet Competition. With her partner, Andris Liepa, she made history by being the first dancers from the former Soviet Union to compete in America. She and Andris also were the first winners of the Jackson competition’s highest award, the City of Jackson Grand Prix.\n\nAnaniashvili’s second appearance on the Thalia Mara Hall stage was as a juror, representing her home nation of Georgia, in the 2014 USA IBC. Many in the audience had seen her dance in 1986; others knew her renown as a prima ballerina of both the Bolshoi Ballet and American Ballet Theatre.\n\nOn July 16, 2016, Nina Ananiashvili returned as prima ballerina and artistic director of the State Ballet of Georgia.To express her appreciation to Jackson, the USA IBC and its chairman emeritus, William D. Mounger, she made a special addition to the evening’s program. She dedicated her illustrious performance of The Dying Swan to Mounger, who was among the group of Jacksonians who first saw her dance at the 1985 Moscow IBC. Her performance of Marguerite in Marguerite and Armand also was an exquisite vehicle for her strength, grace and emotional depth three decades following her participation in USA IBC III.\n\nThe State Ballet of Georgia delighted with Balanchine’s Concerto Barocco and Yuri Possokhov’s Sagalobeli. The last piece was followed by a rousing encore that featured Ananiashvili in traditional and manly Georgian attire, proudly displaying her homeland’s flag.\n\nJust as she and Andris had done in 1986, Nina and the State Ballet of Georgia gave a performance from heart and soul, and the Jackson-USA IBC audience will cherish the memory.\n\nPhoto by Richard Finkelstein.\n\n‘The Art of Dance’ works on display through July 31, 2016\n\n“The Art of Dance,” a show by the Community Art Group of VSA Mississippi, continues to be on display in the Mississippi Arts Center through July 31. Dance-inspired art, including several pieces painted from photographs of competitors in the 2014 USA International Ballet Competition, is featured. The exhibit is a collaborative effort of VSA, the State Organization on Arts and Disability, and the USA IBC. It opened in conjunction with the USA IBC’s 2016 Grand Prix Reunion Gala, presenting Nina Ananiashvili and the State Ballet of Georgia in performance.

Held every four years since 1979, the USA IBC is the official ballet competition of the United States by a Joint Resolution of Congress.\n\n“Dancers invited to compete in the USA IBC know they have a chance to test their skills against the highest international standards,” said Sue Lobrano, USA IBC executive director. “The level of artistry and technique that this group of competitors will bring to the USA IBC stage will certainly be thrilling to watch.”\n\nIn March, the USA IBC invited 109 applicants from 21 nations to compete. Ten of those invited have notified the USA IBC they will be unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts, opportunities, travel expense or injury. Of the 99 scheduled to attend, 57 are senior competitors (ages 19-26) and 42 are juniors (ages 15-18). The United States leads in the number of participants (31), followed by Japan (17) and Brazil (9).\n\n“The USA IBC is synonymous with the discovery of new talents and the launching of careers,” Lobrano said. “We look forward to hosting these competitors as they experience the United States’ premiere ballet competition where they will vie for gold, silver and bronze medals, company contracts and scholarships.”\n\nServing on the 2014 Selection Committee were artistic directors Adam Sklute of Ballet West, Virginia Johnson of Dance Theatre of Harlem, and Magaly Suarez of The Art of Classical Ballet School. The three met in Jackson earlier in the year to review video submissions from applicants in 29 countries. Seven of those receiving invitations have notified USA IBC they will be unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts, travel expense or injury.\n\nBallet BackStory: Creating better understanding of classics\n\nThe comedy ballet Coppélia, now in rehearsal at Ballet Mississippi, is the focus of the first program in a new series the USA International Ballet Competition has launched to create more understanding and enjoyment of classical ballet.\n\nBallet BackStory: Coppélia set for noon Tuesday, March 24, at the Arts Center of Mississippi, 201 E. Pascagoula St., in downtown Jackson.\n\nDavid Keary, artistic director of Ballet Mississippi, will share insights into the history, choreography, story and music of the comedy his company will perform April 26 at Thalia Mara Hall.\n\nGerrie McElroy, costume mistress for Ballet Mississippi, will preview the peasant dresses and romantic tutus she has styled for the dancers.\n\nNaomi Wilson, a Ballet Mississippi dancer, will comment on performing the role of Swanilda in the April production.\n\nVideo of a pas de deux from Coppélia, performed by Yasmin Lomondo and Gustavo Carvalho of Brazil, both bronze medalists and the Best Junior Couple in the USA International Ballet Competition.\n\n“Understanding the story of a ballet enriches the experience of seeing variations performed,” said Mona Nicholas, executive director of the USA IBC. “So much of the repertoire for the competitors in the USA IBC are variations from the major classical ballets that are staged around the world—Giselle, Coppélia, La Bayadere, Don Quixote, Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty and others. To help our community enjoy ballet more, and at the same time support Mississippi’s ballet companies in staging these classics, we are offering Ballet BackStory.”\n\nNicholas says that the Ballet BackStory series will serve as a bridge “from knowing nothing about ballet to appreciating the motivations, emotions and background experiences that influence each dancer’s movements and expressions on stage.”\n\nThe event is sponsored by the Friends of the USA IBC and includes lunch for $10. Please call 601-362-7125 or email btrigg@usaibc.com by March 23 to RSVP. Friends of the USA IBC serve as volunteers and assist with fundraising for the Jackson competition, held every four years.

Its founders and artistic directors, Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, are known for creating an open, continually evolving form of dance that reflects the movement of the world and all its constituent cultures as an interrelated whole. Rhoden, whose choreography has been the lynchpin in the development of the Complexions repertory, choreographed Innervisions.\n\nTickets to the USA IBC’s opening ceremony, including the competitors’ Parade of Nations and Complexions Contemporary Ballet performance, range from $35 to $60 and may be purchased at www.usaibc.com. Tickets for other individual performances during the three rounds of competition are priced from $7 to $70 and may also be purchased via the website.\n\nThe USA IBC is a two-week, “olympic-style” competition where tomorrow’s stars vie for medals, cash awards, company contracts and scholarships. The event is designated as the official international ballet competition in the United States by a Joint Resolution of the Congress. Presented under the auspices of the International Dance Committee, International Theatre Institute of UNESCO, the USA IBC is held every four years in Jackson, Miss., in the tradition of sister competitions in Varna, Bulgaria, and Moscow, Russia.\n\n###"
