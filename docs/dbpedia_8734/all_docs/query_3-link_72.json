        "text": "Regulatory rollback at the Environmental Protection Agency has favored industry interest, while leaving communities at risk.\n\nThe Wayne Barrett Project honors Wayne’s legacy by supporting ambitious investigative reporting projects focused on politics and corruption in both New York City and on the national stage.\n\nViolent, targeted campaigns of killings, rapes, and the burning of homes have led to a massive refugee crisis at the heart of the continent.\n\nAs the Department of the Interior embraces industry interests, US public lands are left vulnerable to private sector exploitation under the Trump administration.\n\nThe I.F. Stone Award honored Stone’s legacy of tireless investigations into issues of vital national interest by creating a pathway for emerging reporters to produce their first journalistic investigations. This is what they produced.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Prisons repeatedly ignored its own watchdogs as dozens of immigrants died in the wake of medical neglect in segregated, privatized prisons.\n\nA year-long series on the myriad ways workers are being shortchanged, revealing the exploitative and dangerous labor conditions behind our holidays and rituals — from New Year’s resolutions to Christmas shopping.\n\nA close look at the rising white nationalist movement and its ties to the Trump campaign and the Trump administration.\n\nAn exposé of the dangers of the chemical C8 and DuPont’s efforts to evade legal responsibility."
