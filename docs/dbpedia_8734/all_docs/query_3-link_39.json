She was one of many Walmart workers who have been pressured to work through illness or pain, sometimes with devastating consequences.\n\nThe Eric Adams Table of Success\n\nMayor Adams has said that “all my haters become my waiters when I sit down at the table of success.” Who’s at the table? How are they related? Why do they matter?\n\nThe Truth Behind The Experimental Therapy That Kids Say Starts With ‘Legalized Kidnapping’\n\nHundreds of children across the U.S. have been sent into controversial treatment programs where they’re cut off from the parent they trust and forced to live with the one they fear."
