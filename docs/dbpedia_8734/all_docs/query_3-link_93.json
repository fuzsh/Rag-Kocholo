        "text": "More than half the dancers in the 2014 USA International Ballet Competition advanced to the Round II semi-finals in Jackson, in what ballet circles generally agree is the world's top competition.\n\nFrom the field of 91 competitors, 54 are moving on to the Round II's contemporary ballet, Friday through Sunday at Thalia Mara Hall.\n\nDancers are divided into junior (ages 15-18) and senior (ages 19-26) divisions. The breakdown of semi-finalists: 14 senior females; 18 senior males; 14 junior females; 7 junior males.\n\nJapan has the highest number of dancers moving forward, with 11; USA's 10 and the Republic of Korea's nine are close behind. Brazil is next in line with seven, and China has four. Dancers representing Australia, Mongolia, Russia, Cuba, Chile, Portugal, Mexico and South Africa are also advancing in \"what has truly been an international competition,\" IBC jury co-chair John Meehan of Australia said.\n\nAmong the semi-finalists are such crowd favorites as: seniors Kaori Fukui and Jun Tanabe of Japan, whose \"Don Quixote\" wrapped up Tuesday night with a bow; junior Brazilian charmers Yasmin Lomondo and Gustavo Carvalho; Russian senior Irina Sapozhnikova, who fanned sparks with noncompeting (and highly gold medaled, including here) partner Joseph Phillips; and seniors Sirui Liu (China) and Rodrigo Almares (Cuba), whose precision and playful interaction won the crowd.\n\nA restructured Round II this year requires competitors to choose one solo or pas de deux from a contemporary repertoire. Top-notch choreographers Trey McIntyre and Matthew Neenan contributed several works to the 2014 competition. Dancers learned their choice before arrival. Neenan and a member of the Trey McIntyre Project is on hand to work with dancers.\n\nA few longtime IBC watchers fear they'll miss the wild-card thrill of previous Round IIs, and are apprehensive about repetition of works, albeit by different dancers, they'll see in the semi-finals.\n\nIBC jurors are positive about the change. Contemporary ballet in competition can be tricky from both judging and competitor selection perspectives, Meehan said. \"Occasionally, the dancer will choose repertoire that is impossible to judge, or very difficult to judge.\n\n\"I think this is going to be better for both the competitors — they're going to be less at sea, finding their choice — and for us, too, because it levels the playing field a little.\"\n\nCanadian judge Andre Lewis said, \"You're comparing apples to apples.\"\n\nFormer IBC medalists Brooklyn Mack and Jeffrey Cirio also endorsed the move. Judges will know how the piece should be danced, Cirio said. Mack said it also helps bridge gaps between the varying resources and economic backgrounds of the dancers.\n\nEliminated dancers have another chance to be seen in performance, in Sunday's Edward Stierle Contemporary Showcase.\n\nUSA IBC Round II competitors\n\nSenior Males:\n\nAaron Smyth (Australia)\n\nAndile Ndlovu (South Africa)\n\nByul Yun (Republic of Korea)\n\nDae Han Na (Republic of Korea)\n\nGantsooj Otgonbyamba (Mongolia)\n\nIlya Artamonov (Russia)\n\nIvan Duarte (Brazil)\n\nJeong Hansol (Republic of Korea)\n\nJi Seok Ha (Republic of Korea)\n\nJun Tanabe (Japan)\n\nKota Fujishima (Japan)\n\nMengjun Chen (Peoples Republic of China)\n\nMozart Mizuyama (Brazil)\n\nNayon Rangel Iovino (Brazil)\n\nRodrigo Almarales (Cuba)\n\nSebastian Vinet (Chile)\n\nSteven Loch (USA)\n\nTelmo Moreira (Portugal)\n\nSenior Females:\n\nArianni Martin (Cuba)\n\nGa-Yeon Jung (Republic of Korea)\n\nHeewon Cho (Republic of Korea)\n\nHitomi Nakamura (Japan)\n\nIrina Sapozhnikova (Russia)\n\nJessica Assef (Brazil)\n\nKaori Fukui (Japan)\n\nMelissa Gelfin (USA)\n\nOlga Marchenkova (Russia)\n\nShiori Kase (Japan)\n\nSirui Liu (Peoples Republic of China)\n\nTamako Miyazaki (Japan)\n\nYe Lim Choi (Republic of Korea)\n\nYui Sugawara (Japan)\n\nJunior Males:\n\nAran Bell (USA)\n\nBlake Kessler (USA)\n\nDaniel Alejandro McCormick-Quintero (Mexico)\n\nGustavo Carvalho (Brazil)\n\nJinsol Eum (Republic of Korea)\n\nTaiyu He (Peoples Republic of China)\n\nYue Shi (Peoples Republic of China)\n\nJunior Females:\n\nAmi Naito (Japan)\n\nGabrielle Chock (USA)\n\nGisele Bethea (USA)\n\nKatherine Barkman (USA)\n\nMackenzie Richter (USA)\n\nMizuho Nagata (Japan)\n\nOlivia Gusti (USA)\n\nPaula Alves (Brazil)\n\nPaulina Guraieb Abella (Mexico)\n\nRieko Hatato (Japan)\n\nRomina Contreras (Chile)\n\nSo Jung Lee (Republic of Korea)\n\nVictoria Wong (USA)\n\nYasmin Lomondo (Brazil)\n\nYoshiko Kamikusa (Japan)\n\nContact Sherry Lucas at slucas@jackson.gannett.com or (601) 961-7283.
