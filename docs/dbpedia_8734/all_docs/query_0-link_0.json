        "text": "Early life\n\nShe was born in Moscow, Russia.\n\nVictoria began her artistic studies in The Rodchenko Art School (class of Video Art, professor Kirill Preobrazhenskiy, 2009-2012) and then in RSUH (2013, PhD dissertation 'Languages of Russian and Chinese narrative video art'). She developed her own plastics and artistic strategy.\n\nCareer\n\nVictoria Marchenkova is a mixed media artist. She was born in Moscow in 1987. Victoria is a prominent representative of ‘Young&Clever’ Wave. She made a shift from contextual to avant-garde positions at Russian art scene. Her artworks represent a mixture of different lifestyles defined by the present economic situation of the world, international traditions and heritage. Victoria is a bright representative of artists born in the late 80s and was influenced by Pictorial turn (‘Ikonische Wende’). Victoria found her artistic way in sophisticated works with light, tactility, metal and gold imitations. According to the words of art historian Vera Trakhtenberg, the exhibition of Victoria Marchenkova “Every felling sent by God” (2015, Osnova gallery) shows the course on a transfer of Byzantine art technologies into contemporary art field. Besides, artworks of Victoria reflect the drawing technique of famous Russian painter of icons and frescos, Andrew Rublev. In such works as – “Be Calm and VIP”, “My parents think I am always getting higher” and “…But I am just fairy of normalization” - we can find medieval technologies developed by the artist for aesthetically new results. Numerous installations and objects of Marchenkova represent transmission of forms between sacral and so-called “dirty” spaces. The most iconic work among artworks of Victoria is a dog chain collar called “Rose Gold Look So Nice On You” and created in neo-conceptual style. This object can be associated with a thing made for absolutely different purposes like – a toy for sadomasochistic sex, luxury jewelry or sacred crown of thorns. Transgression in optics towards good and evil, search for borders between holiness and sin, those two themes represent the main course of Victoria Marchenkova recent works.\n\nRecognition\n\nVictoria was a nominee of The Kandinskiy Prize 2012 (Young Artist) and 2014 (Scholarly work and History and theory of contemporary art). In 2014, The Art Newspaper Russia included her in a selection of top 100 emerging Russian artists.\n\nShe lives and works in Moscow.\n\nList of selected solo exhibitions\n\n2015\n\nEvery Feeling Sent By God.
