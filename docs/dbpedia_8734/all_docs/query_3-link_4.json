        "text": "Narrative in video art is defined by synchronous art movements and structures of modern and postmodern literature. Video as medium is influenced by existing narrative structures. A researcher should synthesize strategies of contemporary art interpretation and film semiotics to analyze narrative video art pieces.\n\nMoscow Conceptualism and Neoacademism influenced Russian narrative video art (Boris Yukhananov, Kirill Preobrazhenskiy, Yuriy Leiderman, Chto Delat, AES+F, etc.). Chinese narrative video art (Wu Wenguang, Wang Jianwei, Yang Fudong, Cao Fei, etc.) is connected with the iconography of Socialist realism, mass and traditional cultures. It is conceptually accessible to the masses. The image of a new subject has appeared inside this movement. This subject was formed by political and sociocultural changes of the end of the 1980s."
