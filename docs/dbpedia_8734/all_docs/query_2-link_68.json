Anderson HC, Warner SF, Ripley NE, Nielsen MK.Tapeworm infection in horses can cause serious health concerns, and recent data have documented treatment failures in the most common species, Anoplocephala perfoliata. The threat of anthelmintic resistance in A. perfoliata is of particular concern because of poor diagnostic performance of standard egg counting techniques for detecting this parasite. This study compared the performance of three diagnostic techniques 1) Mini-FLOTAC, 2) Cornell-Wisconsin, and 3) Proudman and Edwards used to detect and quantify A. perfoliata eggs in naturally infected horses.

Dube F, Delhomme N, Martin F, Hinas A, u00c5brink M, Svu00e4rd S, Tydu00e9n E.Anthelmintic resistance in equine parasite Parascaris univalens, compromises ivermectin (IVM) effectiveness and necessitates an in-depth understanding of its resistance mechanisms. Most research, primarily focused on holistic gene expression analyses, may overlook vital tissue-specific responses and often limit the scope of novel genes. This study leveraged gene co-expression network analysis to elucidate tissue-specific transcriptional responses and to identify core genes implicated in the IVM response in P. univalens.

Matthews JB, Peczak N, Lightbody KL.Helminths are commonly found in grazing equids, with cyathostomin nematodes and the cestode being the most prevalent. Most horses harbour low burdens of these parasites and do not develop signs of infection; however, in a small number of animals, high burdens can accumulate and cause disease. Cyathostomins are associated with a syndrome known as larval cyathostominosis. This occurs when large numbers of larvae emerge from the large intestinal wall. This disease has a case fatality rate of up to 50%. infection has been associated with various types of colic, with burdens of >20 worms assoc...\n\nRead More 0\n\nParascaris spp. eggs shedding patterns in juvenile horses. Ripley NE, Gravatte HS, Britton LN, Davis SM, Perrin GM, Warner S, Rexroat EK, Vetter AL, Maron EES, Finnerty CA, Stanton V, Nielsen MK.Parascaris spp. infect foals worldwide and foals typically shed eggs in the feces from about three to six months of age, upon which natural immunity is incurred. High levels of anthelmintic resistance of Parascaris spp. are a global concern, and further understanding egg shedding patterns and fecal egg counting (FEC) data variability is of high importance. The aims of this study were to monitor Parascaris spp. egg shedding in untreated foals during 12-23 weeks of age, estimate sources of data variability, and assess precision of two ascarid FEC techniques.

Osterman-Lind E, Holmberg M, Grandi G.In Sweden, routine deworming has been used for several decades; however, to slow down the development of anthelmintic resistance, selective treatment is currently recommended. As part of a monitoring programme, equestrian premises submitted faecal samples to the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) twice per year between 2008 and 2017. Analyses for strongyles (small and large), tapeworms and ascarids, followed by premise-specific advice regarding deworming and parasite control strategies, were provided.

Alm YH, Osterman-Lind E, Martin F, Lindfors R, Roepstorff N, Hedenstru00f6m U, Fredriksson I, Halvarsson P, Tydu00e9n E.Cyathostominae are ubiquitous to grazing horses and regarded the most prevalent internal parasite in the horse. Unfortunately, decades of indiscriminate use of anthelmintic drugs have resulted in the development of resistance in cyathostomins to all currently available drug groups, the most recent being a documented lack of efficacy to the macrocyclic lactones (ML).

Flota-Burgos GJ, Rosado-Aguilar JA, Rojas-Becerril R, Rodru00edguez-Vivas RI, Trinidad-Martu00ednez I.Gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) are a major impediment to breeding and exploitation of horses. Traditional control of GIN has generated resistance to main anthelmintics, including ivermectin. An analysis of five ranches with a history of IVM use was done to determine the efficacy and resistance of GIN to IVM treatment in horses from the Mexican southeast. Predesigned questionnaires were applied to collect information on previous treatment protocols. The fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) was applied to determine resistance.

Nielsen MK, Leathwick DM, Sauermann CW.Over the past three decades, equine strongylid egg reappearance periods (ERPs) have shortened substantially for macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics. The ERPs of ivermectin and moxidectin were originally reported in the 8-10 and 12-16 week ranges, respectively, but several recent studies have found them to be around 4-5 weeks for both actives. This loss of several weeks of suppressed strongylid egg output could have substantial implications for parasite control.

Bull KE, Allen KJ, Hodgkinson JE, Peachey LE.In recent years, resistance to the benzimidazole (BZ) and tetrahydropyrimidine (PYR) anthelmintics in global cyathostomin populations, has led to reliance on the macrocyclic lactone drugs (ML-of which ivermectin and moxidectin are licensed in horses) to control these parasites. Recently, the first confirmed case of resistance to both ivermectin (IVM) and moxidectin (MOX) was reported in the USA in yearlings imported from Ireland. This suggests that ML resistance in cyathostomins has emerged, and raises the possibility that regular movement of horses may result in rapid spread of ML resistant c...\n\nRead More 2\n\nA qualitative study of perceived barriers and facilitators to sustainable parasite control on thoroughbred studs in Ireland.

Intensive anthelmintic treatments have succeeded in controlling some of the pathogenic effects of these parasites. However, the success of anthelmintic drugs has been threatened by the development of widespread resistance to those most commonly used. To develop improved control strategies, information on helminth distribution patterns is needed, which can be obtained by identifying animals regarded as high egg shedders and taking age, gender, and other risk factors into account.

Resistance is also developing in nematode parasites of cattle and has been detected in pig parasites. Benzimidazole, levamisole/morantel and ivermectin resistances occur in nematodes of sheep and goats and closantel resistance has been found in Haemonchus contortus. Anthelmintic resistance is likely to develop wherever anthelmintics are frequently used and be detected if it is investigated. Worm count or egg count reduction after treatment are useful for the detection of all types of anthelmintic resistance...\n\nRead More 43\n\nCases of reduced cyathostomin egg-reappearance period and failure of Parascaris equorum egg count reduction following ivermectin treatment as well as survey on pyrantel efficacy on German horse farms. von Samson-Himmelstjerna G, Fritzen B, Demeler J, Schu00fcrmann S, Rohn K, Schnieder T, Epe C.In 2003 and 2004, on a total of 63 different German horse farms, a survey using the faecal egg count reduction (FECR) test was performed to investigate the efficacy of ivermectin (IVM, Ivomec) and pyrantel (PYR, Banminth) treatment against gastro-intestinal nematodes in a total of 767 horses. IVM treatment resulted in 100% reduction of the cyathostomin egg production 14 and 21 days post-treatment (d.p.t.) on 37 farms. On the remaining five farms, the mean faecal egg count reduction ranged between 97.7 and 99.9%. The mean cyathostomin FECR following PYR treatment ranged between 92.2 and 100% on...\n\nRead More 43\n\nEquine cyathostomins: a review of biology, clinical significance and therapy. Corning S.The small strongyles of horses, also known as cyathostomins, are considered the most prevalent and pathogenic parasites of horses today. The clinical syndrome of larval cyathostominosis which occurs as a result of mass emergence of inhibited stages has a high fatality rate despite the best standard of care given to affected horses. Management of the challenge level of cyathostomins to prevent the syndrome is preferable. Many different management programmes have been tried over the past two decades, with mixed success. Programmes have relied heavily on repeated use of anthelmintic treatments th...\n\nRead More 38\n\nPrevalence of anthelmintic resistant cyathostomes on horse farms. Kaplan RM, Klei TR, Lyons ET, Lester G, Courtney CH, French DD, Tolliver SC, Vidyashankar AN, Zhao Y.To determine prevalence of anthelmintic resistance in cyathostome nematodes of horses in the southern United States. Methods: Cross-sectional study. Methods: 786 horses on 44 farms and stables in Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Methods: Fecal egg count (FEC) reduction tests were performed on 44 large farms and stables. Horses on each farm were treated with an oral paste formulation of fenbendazole, oxibendazole, pyrantel pamoate, or ivermectin at recommended label dosages. A mixed linear model was fitted to the percentage reduction in FEC, accounting for differences ...\n\nRead More 38\n\nPerspectives on the utility of moxidectin for the control of parasitic nematodes in the face of developing anthelmintic resistance. Prichard RK, Geary TG.Macrocyclic lactone (ML) anthelmintics are the most important class of anthelmintics because of our high dependence on them for the control of nematode parasites and some ectoparasites in livestock, companion animals and in humans. However, resistance to MLs is of increasing concern. Resistance is commonplace throughout the world in nematode parasites of small ruminants and is of increasing concern in horses, cattle, dogs and other animals. It is suspected in Onchocerca volvulus in humans. In most animals, resistance first arose to the avermectins, such as ivermectin (IVM), and subsequently to...\n\nRead More 37\n\nAnthelmintic resistance in cyathostomin populations from horse yards in Italy, United Kingdom and Germany. Traversa D, von Samson-Himmelstjerna G, Demeler J, Milillo P, Schu00fcrmann S, Barnes H, Otranto D, Perrucci S, di Regalbono AF, Beraldo P, Boeckh A....A large survey was carried out in 2008 in Europe to evaluate the efficacy of fenbendazole (FBZ), pyrantel (PYR), ivermectin (IVM) and moxidectin (MOX), i.e. the major anthelmintic molecules used in current practice against cyathostomins affecting horses. A total of 102 yards and 1704 horses was studied in three countries: 60 yards and 988 horses from Italy, 22 and 396 from the UK, 20 and 320 from Germany. The survey consisted of Faecal Egg Count Reduction Tests (FECRTs) with a faecal egg count reduction (FECR) categorization of (I) resistance present if FECR <90% and the lower 95% confidenc...\n\nRead More 35\n\nAnalysis of multiyear studies in horses in Kentucky to ascertain whether counts of eggs and larvae per gram of feces are reliable indicators of numbers of strongyles and ascarids present. Nielsen MK, Baptiste KE, Tolliver SC, Collins SS, Lyons ET.Increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance in equine nematodes have led to recommendations of more sustainable anthelmintic treatment protocols with emphasis on parasite surveillance and diagnosis, rather than prophylactic calendar-based treatments. This requires knowledge of the diagnostic test performance of techniques for counts of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) as well as methods for culturing, counting and identifying third stage (L(3)) strongyle larvae per gram of feces (LPG). For horses, such information does not exist in the published literature. The aim of this study was to examine th...\n\nRead More 34\n\nCyclooctadepsipeptides–an anthelmintically active class of compounds exhibiting a novel mode of action. Harder A, Schmitt-Wrede HP, Kru00fccken J, Marinovski P, Wunderlich F, Willson J, Amliwala K, Holden-Dye L, Walker R.There are three major classes of anthelmintics for veterinary use: the benzimidazoles/prebenzimidazoles, the tetrahydropyrimidines/imidazothiazoles, and the macrocyclic lactones. In nematodes, there are five targets for the existing anthelmintics: the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor which is the target of tetrahydropyrimidines/imidazothiazoles and indirectly that of the acetylcholineesterase inhibitors; the GABA receptor which is the target of piperazine, the glutamate-gated chloride channel as the target of the macrocyclic lactones, and beta-tubulin as the target of prebenzimidazoles/benz...\n\nRead More 33\n\nAnthelmintic resistance in equine parasites – detection, potential clinical relevance and implications for control. von Samson-Himmelstjerna G.During the past two decades anthelmintic resistance in equine parasites has been found in the group of small strongyle species (cyathostomins) and in the ascarid species Parascaris equorum. The ubiquitous nature and possible severe consequences of disease with these nematodes make them the prime targets of current worm control programmes. Traditional control strategies mainly rely on the strategic application of anthelmintics, currently represented by three major drug classes: benzimidazoles (BZ), the tetrahydropyrimidine pyrantel (PYR) and macrocyclic lactones (ML). Following decades of routi...\n\nRead More 31\n\nThe management of anthelmintic resistance in grazing ruminants in Australasia–strategies and experiences. Leathwick DM, Besier RB.In many countries the presence of anthelmintic resistance in nematodes of small ruminants, and in some cases also in those infecting cattle and horses, has become the status quo rather than the exception. It is clear that consideration of anthelmintic resistance, and its management, should be an integral component of anthelmintic use regardless of country or host species. Many years of research into understanding the development and management of anthelmintic resistance in nematodes of small ruminants has resulted in an array of strategies for minimising selection for resistance and for dealin...\n\nRead More 30\n\nEffects of fecal collection and storage factors on strongylid egg counts in horses. Nielsen MK, Vidyashankar AN, Andersen UV, Delisi K, Pilegaard K, Kaplan RM.Fecal analyses are becoming increasingly important for equine establishments as a means of parasite surveillance and detection of anthelmintic resistance. Although several studies have evaluated various egg counting techniques, little is known about the quantitative effects of pre-analytic factors such as collection and storage of fecal samples. This study evaluated the effects of storage temperature, storage time and airtight versus open-air storage on fecal egg counts. The experimental protocols were replicated in two study locations: Copenhagen, Denmark and Athens, Georgia, USA. In both loc...\n\nRead More 28\n\nHistorical perspective of cyathostomes: prevalence, treatment and control programs. Lyons ET, Tolliver SC, Drudge JH.Small strongyles are highly prevalent in horses and can be found worldwide. Even though over 50 species of these parasites have been described, about 10 species comprise the bulk of the total number present in horses. Efforts to control small strongyles and other equine internal parasites have been undertaken for many years. Some of the early medications and control measures provided questionable activity against endoparasites; whether effective or not, they could be detrimental to the horse. Beginning in the early 1900s, scientific effort was used to evaluate activity of antiparasitic compoun...\n\nRead More 28\n\nClimatic influences on development and survival of free-living stages of equine strongyles: implications for worm control strategies and managing anthelmintic resistance. Nielsen MK, Kaplan RM, Thamsborg SM, Monrad J, Olsen SN.Development of resistance to anthelmintic drugs by horse strongyles constitutes a growing threat to equine health because it is unknown when new drug classes can be expected on the market. Consequently, parasite control strategies should attempt to maintain drug efficacy for as long as possible. The proportion of a parasite population that is not exposed to anthelmintic treatment is described as being \"in refugia\" and although many factors affect the rate at which resistance develops, levels of refugia are considered the most important as these parasites are not selected by treatment and so pr...\n\nRead More 26\n\nDetection and semi-quantification of Strongylus vulgaris DNA in equine faeces by real-time quantitative PCR. Nielsen MK, Peterson DS, Monrad J, Thamsborg SM, Olsen SN, Kaplan RM.Strongylus vulgaris is an important strongyle nematode with high pathogenic potential infecting horses world-wide. Several decades of intensive anthelmintic use has virtually eliminated clinical disease caused by S. vulgaris, but has also caused high levels of anthelmintic resistance in equine small strongyle (cyathostomin) nematodes. Recommendations aimed at limiting the development of anthelmintic resistance by reducing treatment intensity raises a simultaneous demand for reliable and accurate diagnostic tools for detecting important parasitic pathogens. Presently, the only means available t...\n\nRead More 26\n\nAnthelmintic efficacy on UK Thoroughbred stud farms. Relf VE, Lester HE, Morgan ER, Hodgkinson JE, Matthews JB.Anthelmintic drugs have been applied indiscriminately to control horse nematodes for over 40 years. We undertook a comprehensive study to investigate efficacy of the four available broad-spectrum anthelmintic drugs on 16 Thoroughbred stud farms using the faecal egg count reduction test. Efficacy against strongyles was determined by calculating the percentage of reduction in faecal egg count between the group mean at Day 0 and Days 14-17 post-treatment and the 95% lower confidence intervals estimated by non-parametric bootstrapping. Individual strongyle faecal egg count reduction tests (n=429) ...\n\nRead More 25\n\nGenetic variants and increased expression of Parascaris equorum P-glycoprotein-11 in populations with decreased ivermectin susceptibility. Janssen IJ, Kru00fccken J, Demeler J, Basiaga M, Kornau015b S, von Samson-Himmelstjerna G.Macrocyclic lactones (MLs) represent the major drug class for control of parasitic infections in humans and animals. However, recently reports of treatment failures became more frequent. In addition to human and ruminant parasitic nematodes this also is the case for the horse-nematode Parascaris equorum. Nevertheless, to date the molecular basis of ML resistance is still not understood. Unspecific resistance mechanisms involving transporters such as P-glycoproteins (Pgps) are expected to contribute to ML resistance in nematodes. Here, complete sequences of two P. equorum Pgps were cloned and i...\n\nRead More 25\n\nStrongylus vulgaris associated with usage of selective therapy on Danish horse farms-is it reemerging? Nielsen MK, Vidyashankar AN, Olsen SN, Monrad J, Thamsborg SM.Nematodes belonging to the order Strongylida are ubiquitous in grazing horses, and the large strongyle Strongylus vulgaris is considered the most pathogenic. This parasite was originally described widely prevalent in equine establishments, but decades of frequent anthelmintic treatment appears to have reduced the prevalence dramatically. Increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance in cyathostomin parasites have led to implementation of selective therapy to reduce further development of resistance. It has been hypothesized that S. vulgaris could reoccur under these less intensive treatment cir...\n\nRead More 24\n\nAnthelmintic resistance in equine parasites–current evidence and knowledge gaps. Nielsen MK, Reinemeyer CR, Donecker JM, Leathwick DM, Marchiondo AA, Kaplan RM.Anthelmintic resistance is becoming increasingly prevalent among equine nematode parasites. The first reports documenting resistance were published in the 1960s, just a short time after introduction of the first modern anthelmintics phenothiazine and thiabendazole. Several factors are known to influence development of resistance, but evidence specific to equine parasites is limited. Most current knowledge and applications have been extrapolated from research with trichostrongylid parasites of sheep. The number of cyathostomin species co-infecting horses adds to the complexity of investigating ...\n\nRead More 24"
