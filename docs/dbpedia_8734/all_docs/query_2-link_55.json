The circuital nature of Josephson-based quantum superconducting systems powerfully supports massive circuital freedom, which allowed for the implementation of a wide range of qubit designs, and an easy interface with the quantum processing unit. However, this unavoidably introduces a coupling with the environment, and thus to extra decoherence sources. Moreover, at the time of writing, control and readout protocols mainly use analogue microwave electronics, which limit the otherwise reasonable scalability in superconducting quantum circuits. Within the future perspective to improve scalability by integrating novel control energy-efficient superconducting electronics at the quantum stage in a multi-chip module, we report on an all-microwave characterization of a planar two-transmon qubits device, which involves state-of-the-art control pulses optimization. We demonstrate that the single-qubit average gate fidelity is mainly limited by the gate pulse duration and the quality of the optimization, and thus does not preclude the integration in novel hybrid quantum-classical superconducting devices.

The band structures were evaluated using the transfer matrix approach. The results of tuning the coupled electrostatic potential and exchange field showed that the spin-dependent anisotropy of a Dirac cone depends on the difference between the amplitude of periodically modulated coupling. Spin-dependent collimation occurs when the modulations become zero-average potentials with the ratio of both periodically modulated strengths equals one, in which one spin can be moved freely, but the other one is highly collimated. In addition, we find that the number of extra Dirac points in the infinite superlattice is spin-dependent. In terms of spin-ups, their number increases with an increase in the strength of both modulated fields. To ensure this calculation, we also compute the conductance of finite periodic modulation at zero energy. It is shown that the peaks of the conductance occur when the extra Dirac point emerges. This result may be utilized to design graphene-based devices with highly spin-polarized collimators.

Using polarized light passing through the ferrofluid, we can observe the formation of light patterns for different magnetic field configurations. Using a device known as a Ferrocell, we present a study relating magnetic fields and complex functions. Our main issue here is to know what the relationship is between fundamental multipole expressions and light polarization patterns obtained with the ferrofluid. We have applied multipole fields to the Ferrocell, observed the light patterns, and compared them with multipoles of complex functions. We interpreted other luminous polarization patterns as the sum of these fundamental multipoles.

Our calculations show that the system behavior evolves from quasi-one dimensional to a strictly one-dimensional one by changing the atom–atom interaction, or the axial density, or the frequency of the transverse confinement. Quite remarkably, in the droplet phase induced by the attractive dipolar interaction the system becomes sub-one dimensional when the transverse width is smaller than the characteristic length of the transverse harmonic confinement.

Redox reactions in active battery cathode materials are ubiquitous, complicated, and functionally very important. While a lot of effort has been devoted to investigating redox heterogeneity and its progressive evolution upon prolonged battery cycling, the ultrafast dynamics in these systems are largely unexplored. In this article, we discuss the potential significance of understanding redox dynamics in battery cathodes in the ultrafast time regime. Here, we outline a conceptual experimental design for investigating the ultrafast electron transport in an industry-relevant layered transition metal oxide battery cathode using a plasma-acceleration-based X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) facility. Going beyond the proposed experiment, we provide our perspectives on the use of compact FEL sources for applied research, which, in our view, is an area of tremendous potential.

Classical security methods for protecting such networks will not be effective enough if quantum computers become widespread. On the other hand, we can exploit the capabilities of quantum computing and communications to build a new quantum communication network. In this paper, we focused on enhancing the performance of the classical client–server Internet application. For this sake, we introduced a novel Internet of Things (IoT) quantum network that provides high security and Quality of Service (QoS) compared with the traditional IoT network. This can be achieved by adding quantum components to the traditional IoT network. Quantum counterpart nodes, channels, and servers are used. In order to establish a secure communication between the quantum nodes and the quantum server, we defined a new Communication Procedure (CP) for the suggested IoT quantum network. The currently available quantum computer has a small qubit size (from 50 to 433 qubits). The proposed IoT quantum network allows us to overcome this problem by concatenating the computation efforts of multiple quantum nodes (quantum processors).

The elastic mode theory is first generalized to take into account the fact that, during a flow experiment, mechanical energy is injected in a system initially at thermodynamic equilibrium. This generalized theory can be seen as a particular aspect of the general problem of perturbation by the measurement, associated with that of the coupling between fluctuation and dissipation. This generalization leads to a “finitary” character of the model. It is then combined with the inertial mode theory. The formalism thus obtained allows us to model the rheological behavior of liquids over a wide range of velocity gradients, including the intermediate narrow range corresponding to the Newtonian regime. As experimental tests, viscosity measurements with two kinds of moving rotor rheometers were performed. Only data obtained with liquid water at room temperature are presented and quantitatively analyzed here. It is also shown that liquid n-octane exhibits the same qualitative behaviors as those of liquid water. In the appendices, connection of this theory with quantum mechanics and turbulence phenomena are discussed, and the notion of viscous mass is introduced.

We present a method for probing the interface perfection in La2−xSrxCuO4 (LSCO)-LaSrAlO4 (LSAO)-La2−xSrxCuO4 trilayer junctions. A series of LSCO-LSAO superlattices with atomically smooth surfaces and sharp interfaces were grown by the atomic-layer-by-layer molecular beam epitaxy (ALL-MBE) technique. We have systematically varied the thickness of LSCO and LSAO layers with monolayer precision. By studying the mutual inductance and electrical transport in these superlattices, we detect the non-superconducting (“dead”) layers at the interfaces and quantify their thicknesses. Our results indicate that two optimally doped LSCO monolayers just above and below the one monolayer LSAO barrier are no longer superconducting, rendering the actual barrier thickness of five monolayers. Next, we have shown that introducing a protective highly-overdoped LSCO layer reduces the thickness of dead layers by one or two monolayers.

Contrary to this, superconductivity in LaNiO2 is still under debate. This indicates the crucial role played by the f electrons on the electronic structure and the pairing mechanism of infinite-layer nickelates. Here, we discuss the role of the electron correlations in the f electron states and their influence on the electronic structure. We show that the lattice parameters are in good agreement with the experimental values, independent of the chosen parameters within the DFT+U approach. Increasing Coulomb interaction U tends to shift the f states away from the Fermi level. Surprisingly, independently of the position of f states with respect to the Fermi energy, these states play an important role in the electronic band structure, which can be reflected in the modification of the NdNiO2 effective models.

Whereas PHF variationally optimizes a site–spin product state for the restoration of spin- and point-group symmetry, cPHF groups sites into discrete clusters and uses a cluster-product state as the broken-symmetry reference. Intracluster correlation is thus already included at the mean-field level, and intercluster correlation is introduced through symmetry projection. Variants of cPHF differing in the broken and restored symmetries are evaluated for ground states and singlet-triplet gaps of antiferromagnetic spin rings for various cluster sizes, where cPHF in general affords a significant improvement over ordinary PHF, although the division into clusters lowers the cyclical symmetry. In contrast, certain two- or three-dimensional spin arrangements permit cluster groupings compatible with the full spatial symmetry. We accordingly demonstrate that cPHF yields approximate ground states with correct spin- and point-group quantum numbers for honeycomb lattice fragments and symmetric polyhedra.

The ground state (gs) of the HAF spin-1/2 and spin-1 chains have a quasi-long-range and short-range correlation, respectively. We study the effect of the exchange interaction between an HAF spin-1/2 and an HAF spin-1 chain forming a normal ladder system and its gs properties. The inter-chain exchange interaction J⊥ can be either ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM). Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we show that in the weak AFM/FM coupling limit of J⊥, the system behaves like two decoupled chains. However, in the large AFM J⊥ limit, the whole system can be visualized as weakly coupled spin-1/2 and spin-1 pairs which behave like an effective spin-1/2 HAF chain. In the large FM J⊥ limit, coupled spin-1/2 and spin-1 pairs can form pseudo spin-3/2 and the whole system behaves like an effective spin-3/2 HAF chain. We also derive the effective model Hamiltonian in both strong FM and AFM rung exchange coupling limits.

The Q-ball charge Q gives the number of condensed elementary bosonic excitations in a CDW fluctuation of finite amplitude. The attraction between these excitations inside Euclidean Q-balls is self-consistently triggered by the simultaneous condensation of Cooper/local pairs. Euclidean Q-ball solutions, analogous to the famous Q-balls of squarks in the supersymmetric standard model, arise due to the global invariance of the effective theory under the U(1) phase rotation of the Fourier amplitudes of the short-range CDW fluctuations. A conserved ‘Noether charge’ Q along the Matsubara time axis equals Q∝TM2V, where the temperature T, Q-ball’s volume V, and fluctuation amplitude M enter. Several predictions are derived in an analytic form that follow from this picture. The conservation of the charge Q leads to an inverse proportionality between the volume V and X-ray scattering intensity ∼M2 of the CDW puddles found in micro X-ray scattering experiments. The theoretical temperature dependences of the most probable Q value of superconducting Q-balls and their size and scattering amplitudes fit well the recent X-ray diffraction data in the pseudogap phase of high-Tc cuprates.

Moreover, these experimental probes have shown the formation of a superstripes phase in the pseudogap regime below T* in cuprates. Here, we focus on the anomalous temperature dependence of short range X-ray diffraction CDW reflection satellites with high momentum transfer, probing both charge and lattice fluctuations in superconducting HgBa2CuO4+y (Hg1201) in the pseudogap regime below T* and above Tc. We report compelling evidence of the anomalous anticorrelation of the coherence volume with the peak maximum amplitude of the CDW XRD satellite by cooling below T*. This anomalous temperature trend of the short-range striped Jahn Teller polaronic CDW puddles is in agreement with predictions of the Q-ball theory of the quark gluon plasma extended to cuprates, providing compelling evidence for non topological soliton puddles of striped condensate of pairs in the pseudogap phase.

Cuprate such as La2−xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) is a representative complex-oxide high-temperature superconductor (HTS) material. Our group utilizes this method to produce high-quality single-crystal HTS films with atomically smooth surfaces and interfaces. In addition, ALL-MBE enables us to engineer multilayer heterostructures with atomic precision. This allows the fabrication of tunnel junctions, various nanostructures, and other HTS devices of interest for superconducting electronics. We have synthesized over three thousand LSCO thin films in the past two decades. These films’ structural and electronic properties have been studied and characterized by various methods. Here, we distill the extensive experience we accumulated into a step-by-step protocol to fabricate atomically perfect LSCO films. The recipe includes substrate preparation, ozone generation and distillation, source calibration, the in situ monitoring of the film synthesis, post-growth annealing, and ex situ characterization. It discloses a reproducible way to fabricate single-crystal LSCO films for basic research and HTS electronic applications.

The method allows one to find the analytical solution for the dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensate in a homogeneous medium and in a parabolic trap, for the ideal non-interacting case. Secondly, the method allows one to obtain algebraic equations for the trajectories of the position of phase singularities present in the initial condensate along with time (the vortex lines). With these equations, one can predict quantities of interest, such as the time at which a vortex and an antivortex contained in the initial condensate will merge. For the homogeneous case, this method was introduced in the context of photonics. Here, we adapt it to the context of Bose-Einstein condensates, and we extend it to the trapped case for the first time. Also, we offer numerical simulations in the non-linear case, for repulsive and attractive interactions. We use a numerical split-step simulation of the non-linear Gross-Pitaevskii equation to determine how these trajectories and quantities of interest are changed by the interactions. We illustrate the method with several simple cases of interest, both in the homogeneous and parabolically trapped systems.

However, reducing the temperature in these experiments is a bottleneck; therefore, investigating how to increase the energy scale for SC is crucial to cold atoms. In view of this, we examine the effects of next-nearest-neighbor hoppings (t′) on the pairing properties of the attractive Hubbard model in a square lattice. To this end, we analyze the model through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations for fixed density n=0.87, and perform finite-size scaling analysis to the thermodynamic limit. As our main result, we notice that the existence of further hopping channels leads to an enhancement of the pairing correlations, which, in turn, increases the ground-state order parameter Δ. Finally, at finite temperatures, for t′/t≠0, this enhancement of pairing correlations leads to an increase in the critical temperature Tc. That is, the fine-tuning of second-neighbor hoppings increases the energy scales for SC, and may be a route by which cold-atom experiments can achieve such a phase and to help us further understand the nature of this phenomenon.

As such, it became an essential tool to probe the surface states of materials, including those with non-trivial topology. One challenge, however, can be the preparation of clean surfaces which allow the study of preferably unchanged surface properties with respect to the bulk amount. Here, we report on the STM/S of two materials, ZrTe2 and TmB4. The former cleaves easily and defects can be examined in detail. However, our STS data can only qualitatively be compared to the results of band structure calculations. In the case of TmB4, the preparation of suitable surfaces is highly challenging, and atomically flat surfaces (likely of B-termination) were only encountered rarely. We found a large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level EF and a mostly featureless differential conductance near EF. Further efforts are required to relate our results to the electronic structure predicted by ab initio calculations.

The quaternary compound Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), as a promising candidate for thin-film solar cell absorption with medium-level thermoelectric performance, is of interest for the purpose of utilizing solar energy. The defect chemistry and atomic ordering in this particular compound also triggers interests in understanding its crystallographic structure as well as defects. Hereby, high energy resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy is employed to investigate the electronic and geometric structural complexity in pristine and cobalt-doped Cu2ZnSnSe4. The occupational atomic sites of Cu are found to be mixed with the Zn atoms, forming CuZn anti-defects, which serve as a knob to tune local electronic structures. With proper doping, the band structure can be manipulated to improve the optical and thermoelectric properties of the CZTSe compounds.

This is important since it points to the breaking of the rotational symmetry in the electron fluid, the so-called electronic nematicity, presumably intrinsic to LSCO (and other cuprates). An alternative explanation is that it arises from extrinsic factors such as the film’s inhomogeneity or some experimental artifacts. We confront this hypothesis with published and new experimental data, focusing on the most direct and sensitive probe—the angle-resolved measurements of transverse resistivity (ARTR). The aggregate experimental evidence overwhelmingly refutes the extrinsic scenarios and points to an exciting new effect—intrinsic electronic nematicity.

The Weyl semimetals have pairs of Weyl gap-less nodes in the bulk Brillouin zone. The tungsten ditelluride WTe2 likely belongs to type II Weyl semimetals. Doping WTe2 with magnetic ions could induce magnetic ordering in this crystal, which provides prospects for practical applications. We studied the magnetic properties of the iron-doped single crystals Fe0.03W0.97Te2, annealed and unannealed, in comparison with the undoped WTe2. Measurements of the dc magnetization were carried out from 1.8 to 400 K. We revealed pronounced ferromagnetic ordering that was affected by annealing. Anomalies associated with antiferromagnetism and paramagnetism were also found. The magnetic order was suppressed by a field of 60 kOe. The rise in susceptibility with increasing temperature was observed at high temperatures in all samples and was treated using a model developed for Weyl semimetals. The Curie–Weiss law fit at 60 kOe showed that the effective magnetic moment was close to that of Fe2+. Metamagnetism was demonstrated for the unannealed doped WTe2 crystal. The data for the heat capacity of the iron-doped sample agreed with results for the undoped WTe2.

The iterative under-relaxation with phase control method is used to solve Bogoliubov–de Gennes equations in the envelope ansatz. This method—easily generalisable to a wide class of multiband superconducting systems—allows us to obtain both the constructive and the destructive interference solution. The discussion is centred on the latter case, with one of the condensates collapsing with increased inter-subband coupling strength, due to the other—the dominating one—imposing its symmetry on the overall order parameter. The in-depth qualitative analysis is made of underlying intra-subband and inter-subband dynamics, such as the possible factors determining the dominant subband condensate or the ones determining the region where the destructive solution coexists with the constructive one. A comprehensive discussion with the recent works concerning inter-band coupling effects follows, pointing that the destructive solution is nearly universally omitted.

In these works, we have studied the spin resistivity in various kinds of magnetic systems ranging from ferromagnets and antiferromagnets to frustrated spin systems. It is found that the spin resistivity shows a broad peak at the transition temperature in systems with a second-order phase transition, while it undergoes a discontinuous jump at the transition temperature of a first-order transition.

Their condensation leads to a new state of matter, superinsulation, in which Cooper pairs are bound into purely electric pions by strings of electric flux. These electric flux tubes, the dual of Abrikosov vortices, prevent the separation of charge–hole pairs, thereby causing an infinite resistance, even at finite temperatures, the dual behaviour of superconductors. We will discuss the electric Meissner effect, asymptotic freedom and their measurements and describe the recent direct detection of a linear, confining potential by dynamic relaxation experiments. Finally, we consider dyons, excitations carrying both a magnetic and an electric charge, and show that a condensate of such dyons leads to a possible solution of the mysteries of the pseudogap state of high-Tc cuprates.
