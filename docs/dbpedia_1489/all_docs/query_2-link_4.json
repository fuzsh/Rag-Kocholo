        "text": "The following is a chapter from my book Hands Off My Belly! The Pregnant Woman's Survival Guide to Myths, Mothers and Moods\n\nIs it a boy or girl? Yes!!!\n\nSo you want to know the gender of your baby. Most people do, as soon as it is possible. You might even think that people who don’t know the gender of their baby before birth are weird. In our fast-paced world control is everything. We have no patience for the unknown and that is poignantly true in the world of Obstetrics. Most couples today will know the sex of their child before birth through ultrasound. People want to know if they need to buy blue or pink, and they need to know if Pottery Barn has the bumper pads in the color they need. During the time between the 16th to 20th weeks of gestation, the pregnant patient will have a level II ultrasound performed. This ultrasound measures the baby to ensure an accurate due date. The main purpose of this ultrasound, however, is to complete an anatomic survey. Medically, we are looking at the circumference of the head and abdomen, the length of the femur bone, in addition to visualizing the brain, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and the chambers of the heart. What is foremost in the patient and her family’s minds, of course, is getting a look at the private parts. The provider performing the ultrasound can usually tell the patient the gender of the baby. Anecdotally, we would say that about 95% of our patients elect to know the gender of their unborn child, although we have seen surveys that show it to be only 65-80%. Ultimately, all mothers want to know that their baby is healthy and that it has all of the necessary functional parts, but the gender does seem to dominate the experience, more than likely because of such curiosity and the fact that technology today doesn’t make us wait for many things.\n\nThis topic brings to mind a patient of mine and the issue between knowing, or not knowing the gender of her baby.\n\nKB was a 28 yr-old female who was pregnant with her fifth child. Her previous pregnancies had produced four little energetic boys, and she was eager to have a girl. I had the pleasure of delivering her fourth child (who was now 13 months old), and joked that she could have a basketball team if she had another boy. Truth be told, she did not want to have another boy, and while this made her feel guilty, she openly discussed this with her husband and I. Her husband was a large artillery sergeant and was extremely proud to have fathered four boys. Like his wife, he was vocal about the gender of this particular pregnancy, but he wanted a boy to round out his basketball team. Their difference of opinions would often cause a humorous scene in the office.\n\nDuring her visit at 18 weeks KB had her ultrasound. Prior to the examination, the technician asked her if she wanted to know the sex of her baby. She stoically stated that she did not want to know the sex of her baby. This was a shock to both me and her husband. She said that she did not want to know about this little person until he or she came into the world because she wanted everyone to be happy, rather than upset because of the gender. Despite the protests of her husband, she simply stated that she had the final say since he wasn’t the one carrying the pregnancy. The older women in her family had convinced her that she was having another boy because of the way she was carrying the baby; they had told her that she carried this pregnancy the same way she had carried the other four, and since they were all boys, well… Furthermore, the baby had a heart rate that was consistently under 140 beats per minute, and according to her doting companions, this meant she was having a boy. The last indication that she was having a boy was that all of her nephews wanted her to pick them up while the nieces did not seem to care as much. These three things were cause for the elder females in her family to declare, rather confidently, that KB was having her fifth boy. Secretly, I think she was still holding out for that little bit of pink in her life.\n\nDuring her ultrasound, I paid careful attention to not exposing the gender of her baby. Still with a strong desire to know, her husband asked if I would write the gender of the baby on a piece of paper and seal it in an envelope. He wanted this so he could potentially break the seal of the envelope if the anticipation got the better of him. His wife acquiesced to his request and I wrote down the gender of the baby and sealed it up.\n\nThe remainder of KB’s pregnancy was without complication. One evening, I was paged by Labor and Delivery and we determined that KB was in labor. When I was summoned for her delivery, it was with excitement and anticipation that I entered the delivery room to share in the “surprise” moment. Right away I noticed the four young boys sitting between their Aunt and Grandmother on the sofa. Their ages spanned from ten to one and their excitement was palpable. The little brothers had assembled some of their favorite clothes for the baby to go home with, as if they were dressing him in the team uniform. As the head of the baby delivered, anticipation mounted, and with one final push KB delivered a beautiful baby girl. The cheers from the women in the room were countered with the hanging mouths of the little brethren on the couch. KB’s sister was so excited she hugged me as if I had something to do with the gender of her niece. I finished up and removed my protective gown, congratulated everyone, and turned for the door.“Hey Doc!” said KB’s husband. I turned around to see him holding the unopened envelope from 20 weeks earlier, “Wanna see if you were right?” He opened the envelope, pulled out a small piece of paper, and turned it around for all to see. In my handwriting, in capital letters, was the answer I had already known.\n\nGIRL.\n\nThe following are gender myths, old wives tales, and superstitions that we frequently hear at the office. These myths and tales are often passed down through generations and are steeped in rich culture.\n\n1). The manner in which the pregnant mother carries the baby gives a clue as to its gender\n\nWhere this myth originated is a mystery. How many women have heard that if you carry the baby high then you are having a boy and if you carry the baby in your pelvis it is a girl? Anatomically, the factors that effect how the uterus sits in the pelvis and abdomen are maternal height, fetal size, maternal weight, and pelvic bony structure, position of the uterus, position of the uterus and the number of babies in the uterus. Consider that the baby is a boy. Would the fact that the baby has a penis affect the way in which the mother carries it? Many men might argue that the penis is the cause for earth’s rotation, but not but not as likely to think tae penis would affect the way a mother carries her baby.\n\nMaternal height has an effect on the contour of the pregnant abdomen. A woman that is five feet tall may outwardly show earlier than a woman six feet tall. There is more vertical space for the uterus in a taller woman, and she may then be able to hide her pregnancy for a few more weeks. Maternal weight can also mask the signs of pregnancy in the sense that an obese woman would not show signs of her pregnancy until her later trimesters.\n\nThere are four maternal bony shapes of the pelvis. Gynecoid is the most common female pelvic shape and has a contour that is blunter and wider than a male pelvis. This type of pelvic shape is more likely to allow the fetus to drop lower in the pelvis which may demonstrate a woman that carries slightly lower. The android pelvis, or male pelvis, is more heart shaped and not conducive to a vaginal delivery. This pelvic shape may also cause the baby to stay higher in the pelvis and thus look as though the woman is carrying higher.\n\n2). Fetal heart rate <140 = male and >140 = female\n\nFrom ten weeks until delivery, a routine visit to the doctor includes listening the fetal heart rate with a doppler device. Multiple times per day, we are asked whether or not the heart rate of the baby can determine the gender of the baby.\n\nAlthough we have heard it reversed occasionally, it seems to be widely accepted by most patients that a heart rate above 140 is most likely to be a girl. This myth crosses all cultures and age groups. No one seems to know where it came from, but it certainly is one we encounter daily. In fact, in our research, few theories even exist.\n\nHowever, it has been studied that there is no significant difference between a male and a female heart rate, at least statistically speaking (McKenna DS, Ventolini G, Neiger R, Downing C, 2006). The normal heart rate for a fetus is anywhere from 120-160 beats per minute. The heart rate will fluctuate from beat to beat and demonstrate what is called fetal heart rate variability. The developing fetal brain is controlled by the sympathetic (fight or flight response) and the parasympathetic (relaxation) systems. When the brain is developing, there is a struggle between the two systems and thus the heart rate will speed up when stimulated by the sympathetic system and slow down when controlled by the parasympathetic response. So, depending on the arousal of the fetus, the heart rate can be 130 on one day, 110 the next and 150 the next. We usually listen to the fetal heart rate for only about 10-30 seconds at a time in the office. So if the baby is moving, the heart rate may be higher than if it were sleeping.\n\nWe take this even further if we consider once the fetus is born and now a toddler or a boy. Men and women, boys and girls, do not have different heart rates based on gender. The heart rate in a healthy individual is a response to external stimuli and not necessarily caused by the gender of the individual.\n\n3). If the pregnant woman craves spicy or tart foods then she is having a boy\n\nCravings in pregnancy are satirized in movies and commercials. The classic television parody of the pregnant woman waking her husband in the middle of the night to go out and buy pickles and ice cream are quite commonplace. Cravings can be complicated and multi-factorial and most certainly unique to every individual, but hormones and nutritional imbalances can certainly play a role.\n\nWe are often asked if craving spicy foods means that you are having a boy. As we currently practice in Tucson, Arizona, where Mexican food is commonplace, if this were the case, one would think that we would have a preponderance of male births. Women can be more likely to crave foods that they enjoy in general, even when they are not pregnant: I like it so I eat it. Increased progesterone levels stimulate the appetite center in the brain. When you are pregnant, the placenta secretes high levels of progesterone. This increase or stimulation of the appetite can trigger a craving for foods that one may already find appealing.\n\nPica is defined as an abnormal craving that is due to anemia, usually iron deficiency anemia, which is very common in pregnancy. Pica, however, is not a common manifestation of anemia. A classic example of Pica is the woman who has an uncontrollable desire to consume unusual items like dirt or soap. The most unusual experience we have seen is that of a patient who wanted to chew on tires. She would often go to the tire store in order to stand and smell the tires. She understood that consuming tires was not a part of the pregnancy plan, but she, nonetheless, had a strong desire to chew on a tire. As an aside, this patient did not have the desire to eat tires during her next pregnancy.\n\n“Girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice; boys are made from snakes and snails and puppy dog tails.” This nursery rhyme shows society’s sexist version of the male as the harsh caustic person while the females are nurturing and sweet. Perhaps this is an explanation as to why spicy foods, or a craving for them, may relate to the fact that there is a male fetus waiting to be born.\n\n3a). Eating peppers or hot spices during pregnancy will develop a baby with colic\n\nWe have chosen to include this dietary myth as a subset since it applies to the spicy foods category. Again, there are many people that enjoy spicy foods, and there are many babies born with colic; are they related?\n\nIf you have a baby that cries around the same day everyday and is not consolable with the usual comforting practices, then you may have a baby with colic. Colic is traditionally defined as crying for more than three hours per day, three days a week, for more than three weeks. Colic may effect as many as 25% of babies (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2007) and resolves by 9 months in about 90 percent of cases.\n\nIt is currently not known what causes colic, but women who smoke during pregnancy or after delivery have infants with twice the rate of colic (Sondergaard, Henriksen, Obel, & Wisborg, 2001). Colic does not seem to occur in females more than males and it has not been shown to be related to a breastfeeding mother’s diet.\n\nYou and your baby have completely separate dietary tracts. The fetus receives its nutrition from you, but not in the form of solid food. The fetus receives its nutrition across the placenta in the form of macronutrients within the blood. Examples of macronutrients are protein, fat, and carbohydrates. When you eat a chili pepper, it is broken down into its macronutrients, one of which is called capsaicin. In peppers of all kinds, there are also antioxidants, which are actually good for both you and the baby.\n\nWe have not had a colicky child and our hearts go out to those parents who have comforted their children through this process. The fear of having a baby with colic is potentially so strong that this myth may have evolved in an attempt to eliminate this unfortunate and temporary problem.\n\n4). If you crack a raw egg on the mother’s belly, the side to which it slides predicts the gender of the baby.\n\nOther than being messy this superstition has no obvious merit. Depending on the shape of the mother’s belly and where the yolk of the egg falls after being cracked, this will determine the direction the eggs slides. What does it mean if the egg stays on the belly and does not slide? Looking into the meaning and purpose of this myth we discovered the symbolism of the egg to the Mystical World Egg that embodies the entire universe in its embryo. The egg is a common Oriental image of creation and contains heaven and hell in the two halves of the shell. The egg can also symbolize the bisexual potential of the embryo and that it can develop into a male or female. In cracking the symbolic egg onto the egg-shaped belly of the woman there is a symbolism in which way the egg falls. Ancient Egyptians portrayed the World Egg as being similar to the egg inside a woman’s uterus (Jack, 1968).\n\nAs you can imagine, there have been no studies to confirm or invalidate the test. But it remains one of our favorite due to the symbolism and unique nature of the myth.\n\n5). If you tie the pregnant woman’s wedding band to a chain and dangle it over her belly the direction of the spin will tell the gender of the baby\n\nDangling a wedding band or other items, like a safety pin, from a chain it will rotate in a particular direction. This happens whether or not it is dangled over a pregnant woman or an obese man. In looking into this myth we have not been able to distinctly discern which direction of spin is considered to be male or female. It does seem that in most instances, the tale states that a clockwise spin is male and counterclockwise is female. It has been shown that the unconscious desires of the individual holding the chain can cause a particular rotation, by that person unconsciously making certain movements. Therefore, if the person holding the chain knows that clockwise means boy, and he or she would like a boy, there is a greater likelihood that the ring will spin in a clockwise manner.\n\nIn myths or superstitions that involve a right and left spin or side, the male designation is usually to the right and the female to the left. Right-handedness, means clever or skillful. Left-handedness is associated with being witchlike or diabolical (Walker, 1983). Throughout history the left side is associated with the feminine. Ancient Greeks would tattoo themselves with a male symbol on the right and a female symbol on the left. It was also a Medieval belief that a boy came from the right testicle and a girl from the left.\n\nTo further show right-handed masculinity, it is known in Christianity that Christ is seen seated at the right hand of the Father. Another interesting piece of this myth is that of the wedding ring. It was believed that there was a vein running from the ring finger of the women’s left hand directly to her heart (Hazlitt, 1965), therefore, if the ring rotates to the left this shows a connection to the female side and the infant is a female.\n\nGoing back to the medieval thought that boys came from the right testicle, men who wanted a boy would cut off their left testicle. There are currently two less drastic approaches to selecting gender that can greatly increase your chances for a boy or girl.\n\nA method called MicroSort© is available that reportedly can increase the chances of having a girl to 90%. This is a method that can only be used in conjunction with artificial insemination or In Vitro Fertilization, which entails obtaining eggs from the mother surgically, fertilizing the egg with the sperm in the lab, and eventually re-implanting this in the mother’s reproductive tract. The Microsort technology utilizes the scientific data that “boy” sperm have less DNA than “girl” sperm. The reason that “boy” sperm are lighter is because they have a Y-chromosome, which contains less DNA, or data. The “girl” sperm contains an “X” chromosome which contains a large portion of DNA. So this weight factor plays a role in how the fertilization process is accomplished in this method, thereby attempting gender selection.\n\nThe Shettles method is much less expensive and easier to utilize, since it doesn’t require a laboratory or surgery. It simply relies on the timing of sexual intercourse. The same principle applies, that “boy” sperm are lighter weight and thereby faster and more fragile than “girl” sperm. In the Shettles method, if you want to have a boy, you have sex at the exact time of ovulation, so that the fastest “boy” sperm arrive to the egg first. If you want to have a girl, you have intercourse around 2 ½ - 3 days before ovulation, because the “girl” sperm can live longer and can take their time navigating the reproductive tract. The data on the Shettles method is limited, and one study actually showed that the timing of intercourse has no bearing on the sex of the baby (Wilcox AJ, Weinberg CR, Baird DD,1995).\n\n6). The Chinese Birth Calendar is the test most predictive of fetal gender\n\nThe Chinese Birth Calendar is a chart that was supposedly discovered approximately 700 years ago in Beijing, and still resides at the Beijing Institute of Science. The Chinese Birth Calendar predicts the fetus’s gender by utilizing the maternal age and the month in which she conceived. We first heard of this chart/calendar from our sister-in-law who explained to us that she had heard the calendar had a 99% positive predictive value (the calendar was 99% correct in prediction of fetal gender); this obviously peaked our interest. In life, whenever something is 99% accurate, you pay attention.\n\nBasically, the chart consists of two axes. On the vertical axis you chart the age of the mother at conception and on the horizontal axis you chart the month in which the pregnancy was conceived. You then draw lines on the chart and where the lines intersect is where you find the gender of the fetus.\n\nWe want the reader to know that, just for fun, we went through a small sample of ten charts in our office of patients who had delivered with us. We reviewed the ultrasound determined fetal gender along with the actual gender determined at the time of birth and compared it to the Chinese Calendar prediction. We discovered that the Chinese Calendar method was correct in nine out of the ten cases.\n\nIn further analysis of this method of gender prediction, there are some remarkable generalizations. According to the Chinese Calendar, if a woman conceives when she is 18 years of age there is an 80% chance that she will have a girl. If she conceives when she is 21 there is a 90% chance that she will have a girl. We could not think of any medical reason or study that demonstrated why a woman would have a girl 90% of the time during one calendar year of her life and not another. A simple look at the delivery log book at our Labor and Delivery did not demonstrate this effect.\n\nThere are two variables in the calendar that could be cause for error. The first is knowing the actual month of conception. Most due dates are determined by the woman’s first day of her last menstrual period. In reality, conception doesn’t occur until at least two weeks after the last menstrual period. Pregnancy begins once the sperm and the egg meet in the fallopian tube, and that only occurs after ovulation, which is usually about two weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period. For example, your last menstrual period was October 24. That would indicate that you likely became pregnant at or around November 7. So in this case, conception, or pregnancy, didn’t occur until November, not October.\n\nThe second variable that gives cause to error is with regards to the mother’s age. According to the calendar, the age to use is the age of the mother when she delivers. The only way to know that is to wait until the delivery, since there are two weeks both before and after the actual due date that are considered term, anywhere from 38 to 42 weeks. There is also the possibility of having a pre-term, or premature baby, which then obviously wouldn’t be predictable until after delivery either, and therefore, not of much use for those wanting to know gender prior to delivery.\n\n7). Ultrasound is 100% predictive of the gender of my baby.\n\nIn the second trimester, an ultrasound will be performed to determine the size and anatomy of your baby. This ultrasound will survey the anatomy and confirm the correct due date for the pregnancy and will give reassurance that all is well. We would have to say that most couples are more concerned with the gender of the baby at the time of ultrasound. Obviously, the couple wants there to be a healthy baby, but is it a healthy baby boy or girl? In this age where immediate gratification is the norm, we no longer have to wait until delivery to discover the sex of the baby. There are a small percentage of couples, like us, that did not know the gender of our children until they were born. We will have to go on record stating that Shawn wanted to know and Katie did not, and thus with the 51% veto power of the pregnant mother, we did not know the gender until birth. It became an obsession to the point where I asked my wife daily if I could look with the ultrasound machine in the office, all to no avail. What made things worse for me were the throngs of friends and family asking what we were having, and their looks of total disbelief, “You mean, you guys don’t know what you are having?” “What, don’t you know how to do an ultrasound?” In the end, I discovered that, as the father, as well as the obstetrician, it is truly exciting to have or deliver a baby whose gender is unknown.\n\nSo what is the success rate of ultrasound in gender prediction? It really depends on the gestational age of the infant when the scan is performed, and the skill of the technician performing the ultrasound. In the early second trimester around 14-15 weeks, the sex of the fetus can be difficult to visualize because the penis and clitoris have a similar morphology. During a later ultrasound, around 18-20 weeks gestation, there is a higher predictive value for gender. In fact, studies have shown that sex can be determined 100% of the time if the ultrasound is done after 20 weeks by at least one or two exams. In a review of multiple studies, the accuracy was shown to be 97% (Elajalde BR, de Elajalde MM, Heitman T, 1985). Many ultrasound centers discourage their technicians from going on record with the gender of the fetus for fear of retribution if they are wrong. Ultrasound reports from outside facilities that come to our office almost never state the gender of the baby. We have yet to hear of a lawsuit against someone for telling the patient that the gender of the baby was different than expected, but things happen. So if ultrasound can be wrong, and the Chinese Calendar is questionable, what can one do if they want to know the sex of their baby. The answer… wait and see.\n\nAmniocentesis, which is a test where a needle is place through the abdominal wall and into the uterus and amniotic fluid is drawn up and sent to a lab. This will give a chromosomal analysis of the fetus and ultimately declares the sex of the baby. This test is normally performed for women that are over the age of 35 or those that have concern for a possible chromosomal defect. The risk of the amniotic membranes rupturing during or after the procedure is about 1 in 200 and this could cause life threatening issues for the baby. Therefore, it is an inappropriate test for gender determination. It is our understanding that this test is only currently offered by obstetrician and maternal-fetal medicine specialists that have a clearly documented medical reason for performing this procedure.\n\n8). Mixing the mother’s urine with crystal Drano® will tell you the gender based on a color change in the urine when they are mixed\n\nMany years ago, we were listening to a morning talk show in the Oklahoma City area and a local radio channel was having women call in to discuss stories about how they tested for the gender of their baby. This radio channel gathered five methods of gender prediction from their listening audience and then set out to determine which method was the most accurate. It is difficult to remember which methods were pitted against each other, but the test that was deemed most reliable was the crystal Drano mixed with urine.\n\nDrano is a product used for cleaning your household drains and is manufactured by S.C. Johnson and sons. It was developed by a chemist and contains sodium hydroxide, sodium nitrate, sodium chloride, and aluminum. There are a multitude of websites that have varying degrees of methods for mixing the Drano with urine and then based on the color of the mixture you know if you are having a boy or a girl. Supposedly, if the mixture turns brown, black, or dark blue then you are having a boy. If the mixture is clear, green, or light blue then you can supposedly expect a girl. We are not sure where this test originated or who had the time to conjure this up, but Drano is very caustic and the fumes created can cause potential injury. This test should be relegated to the archives and for early morning radio fodder.\n\n9). A European tradition claims that in order to determine the gender of your baby, an older woman preferably your mother, should throw salt on your hair when you are not aware. If you then move your hand to your forehead first you will have a boy; if you move your hand to your chin first you will have a girl\n\nYou are an unsuspecting victim at the annual fourth of July picnic. Your mother sneaks up behind you and throws a dash of salt into your hair. For the next minutes to hours, all eyes are on you to see if you touch your chin or your forehead first. What happens if you have an itch on your behind?\n\nEnough said.\n\n10). If the baby tightens up in your stomach like a ball then you are having a boy.\n\nThis one is “true”. The reason we put that in quotations is because this statement was on a website during a forum on pregnancy. The participant who made the comment felt as though, while many of the items that had been previously discussed were false, this particular myth was true.\n\nWhen you feel you uterus contracting or “balling-up” in your stomach this is more than likely a contraction. The uterus will go through contractions on and off during the second and third trimester. Braxton-Hicks contractions are precisely those uterine contractions that are more of an irritability than preterm or term labor patterns.\n\nThe uterine contractions do not dictate the gender of your baby. Unless of course you don’t know what you are having and the contractions are a precursor to this discovery.\n\n11). If other babies or toddles approach you then you will be having a baby of that gender. If boy toddlers want you to hold them more than girls then you must be having a boy\n\nIn order to predict, you would have to have constant awareness of the genders of the children wanting you to hold them and thereby account for the percentages of boys versus girls. Nine months is a long time, so we wonder if this is true of the entire pregnancy or just certain trimesters? The way a child reacts to you will vary greatly and if you happen to have candy in your hand you may attract every toddler around you which means you might be having sextuplets.\n\nWe are not aware of any specific pheromones or chemicals that are given off by the pregnant woman carrying a particularly engendered baby.\n\n12). Faster hair growth on your legs means you will have a boy\n\nWe have to believe that this myth is apparent because men have more hair on their legs than women….in most cases. This gives us the opportunity to discuss hair growth during pregnancy.\n\nMany women notice that the hair on their head is thicker during pregnancy, and these same women notice their hair falling out in clumps during the postpartum period. These changes are normal. Hair growth will usually return to its normal growth cycle by about 6 months after delivery. In a normal cycle each hair grows about ½ inch per month. There are three stages of hair growth and all hair follicles alternate between the three phases of growth, involution and resting. At any given time about 10 percent of your hair is in this resting phase. During pregnancy, due to the changes in levels of different hormones in your blood stream, more of your hair follicles get “stuck” in the resting phase for a longer duration. This causes less hair to fall out while you are pregnant, thus causing it to look fuller (Speroff L, Glass RH, Kase NG, 1994). After delivery, this resting phase shortens and hair that you would have normally lost during the pregnancy tends to come out seemingly in a few weeks. This gives the impression that you are losing your hair when in reality you are losing the hair that would have come out normally if you were not pregnant. Some women will develop more hair on their chin, upper lip, cheeks, arms and legs during pregnancy. You may also notice new hair on breasts, belly, and back. This is due to an increase in pregnancy hormones and cortisol production. The effect will also seem more pronounced in women with darker hair.\n\n13). The Missonary position makes boys\n\nWe have already discussed that the speed and weight of the sperm have a potential to determine the sex of the baby, but what about the position in which the pregnancy was conceived. In order to keep this a family-oriented book we won’t go into the varying positions of intercourse, but, unfortunately there is no medical evidence to suggest that this is true, other than the presumptions regarding the facts regarding male sperm. Actually there is a basic lack of medical evidence, given, we would assume, the precarious nature of attempting to make it reproducible and respectable. Need we say more?\n\n14). You must be having a boy because your husband has only brothers\n\nGender does not run in a family. At some point in the family tree there has to be a fair amount of women or else the family tree would look more like a family twig. A woman can only donate an X-chromosome to her fetus, with women being chromosomally XX. Women can only begat women. Men on the other hand can donate either an X or a Y chromosome, and thus, depending on which one they donate, the sex will be a boy or a girl. We are not aware of any genetic predisposition that would make a male with only Y chromosomally loaded sperm. This would seem counterintuitive to the propagation of our species. The species would want women to be in abundant supply since they are the ones that carry the pregnancy; men are important to the pregnancy, but not the most important.\n\n15). If you already have 2 boys or 2 girls then your next baby will be the same.\n\nAgain, this pays credence to the fact that sperm from the male determines the sex of the baby and for the most part, which one he donates is out of his control. We have heard this rule of the third child being the same, but it does not simply apply to women having their second, fourth, or fifth child. Is there a magic to the number 3?\n\nAn equilateral triangle has three equal sides\n\nA human ear has three semicircular canals\n\nThe psyche has 3 parts (Id, ego, superego)\n\nNoah had three sons\n\nPlato split the soul into three parts\n\nAyurvedic medicine has 3 doshas or body types\n\nThree R’s (Reading, wRiting, aRithmetic)\n\nBad luck comes in threes\n\nThree children is when they outnumber their parents\n\n16). If my baby is born on an odd day it will be a boy\n\nIt may seem off the beaten path, but to look at the esoteric belief of numbers, or numerology, there is a distinction made of odd numbers. Odd numbers are said to correspond to the right side of the brain and relate to adventure, stress, and the ability to work within one’s path by taking stress and going with the flow. In a patriarchal society these would seem to be male traits and might be the reason for this myth of males being born on odd days. In a society ruled by the matriarch, it may be that the word odd is simply being tagged with the fact that men are simply, odd. This is said in jest, but it is food for thought. Again, this is has been disproven as easily as looking at the delivery log at our Labor and Delivery.\n\n17). When a pregnant woman is asked to show her hands, if she shows them palms up it is a girl, palms down it’s a boy\n\nThis can be looked at in a number of ways. In his discussion on body language, Adam Eason describes people as tending to behave more honestly when they display their open palms to others. Are girls more honest than boys? Not likely and certainly problematic to prove. In ancient times the palm up gesture was also used to show that you were not holding any weapons as a show of intent and trust. He also describes that the palm facing up is a submissive and non-threatening gesture whereas the palm down gesture projects authority. Perhaps this old wives’ tale is propagated simply because it relates to a male dominated, pre-modern society.\n\n18). If you prefer lying on your left side then you are having a girl\n\nAgain, the left side, in historical reference, is related to the feminine. Why do health care providers instruct pregnant women to lie on their left sides? The largest vein in the body is called the vena cava. This blood vessel drains the lower extremities and brings blood flow back to the heart, which then pumps the blood through the lungs for oxygenation. The vena cava is slightly to the right of midline in the human body. When the enlarged pregnant uterus is pressing on the vena cava it can, in effect, decrease the blood flow returning to the heart and thus decrease the amount of blood pumping back out to the placenta and fetus. In tilting to the left side the pressure is theoretically released from the vena cava thus maintaining the posterity of the blood flow. This causes great distress in pregnant women who can no longer sleep on their stomachs because of discomfort. Constantly lying on their left side can cause back pain and discomfort, and many women are petrified to sleep on their backs, although they seldom know why. Our position is that it is impossible to be aware of your position when you are sleeping. Tucking a small pillow under the right hip and lower back is often enough of a tilt to accomplish what is needed. But ultimately, there is no reason to lose sleep in a pregnant state that is already designed for insomnia.\n\n19). If you crave the heels from a loaf of bread you are having a boy\n\nWe have seen this written on websites. It is difficult to find anything to even say about this one. We are somewhat curious to know how this would translate into cultures that use flatbreads. Typically the heel from a loaf of bread is considered the crusty hard piece that many people throw in the trash. For some, and in Irish tales, the heel is considered the best piece of the loaf. How this translates into genders we are not sure.\n\n20). Eat a clove of garlic and if the smell is discernable from your skin, you are having a boy.\n\nThis may be a remnant of the nursery rhyme, “Boys are made of snakes, and snails, and puppy dogs tails”. It seems that boys are associated with things repugnant. Any person eating a large quantity of garlic would have halitosis, and their sweat and skin oils would smell like garlic. In Christianity when Satan left the Garden of Eden, garlic grew from his left footprint. In ancient times, garlic did not have the smelly disposition that it has been given today. It was used for multiple medicinal purposes and was held in high esteem. In European myth garlic was used for protection. Hindus feel that garlic stimulates the body and desires. It would be difficult to eat a raw clove of garlic, and this myth more than likely came from a culture that is familiar with the taste and power of this medicinal plant.\n\n21). If you carry your baby low, it will be a boy and if you carry high, it will be a girl\n\nThere are several variables that help determine how a pregnant woman “carries” her baby. None of them, intuitively, have anything to do with the fetal gender. Mostly, it has to do with the way that the uterus sits in the pelvis. Women most commonly have an anteverted uterus. That is when the uterus folds on itself toward the front of the pelvis and essentially leans forward. Some women have a uterus that sits straight up, and others have one that bends to the back, called a retroverted uterus. All of these positions are normal, but can certainly dictate how the woman’s abdomen looks during pregnancy. The fetal position is another variable. When a baby is positioned with the head on the side and the feet on the other side, called transverse, the shape of the abdomen will be different. But again, this is not likely related at all to the fetal gender, as there is no correlation to a baby’s intrauterine position and it’s gender, but this does seem to be a common thought that continues to propagate, despite any rational basis.\n\nThis brings to mind a personal story from our clinic. I had just finished seeing a patient of mine who was about 28 weeks and had brought her Mexican grandmother in with her to hear the heart beat. She and her grandmother were very pleasant people and as we finished her appointment, we continued to talk as I walked them to the front desk. I was pregnant as well, at that time, and about as far along as this patient was. They both asked me if I knew what the sex of my baby was. I explained that I did not, and that I wanted it to be a surprise. The grandmother was very curious about this and felt the need to investigate further. She then asked me to turn around. I asked her, “You mean turn my back to you?” She said yes. So I did. She then replied, “Well, you’re having a boy.” I laughed nervously, wondering why she would think that and not sure that I really wanted to know. But I did ask, “What makes you say that?” She then replied, “Well, my dear, I saw you before when you weren’t pregnant, and your butt wasn’t that big.” In the end (no pun intended), we did have a boy, so this patient’s mother was correct. If you recall, earlier in this chapter we discussed the dangers of the Drano test. I would also like to place a disclaimer. Do not tell a pregnant woman that she is having a boy because her backside is bigger. Better yet, don’t say this to any woman. This is dangerous if stated by another woman, and fatal is said by a man."
