        "text": "One evening in late November 2018, Lenny Kaye’s phone rang. The music journalist and (since 1971) guitarist for the Patti Smith Group answered, and on the other end of the line was Todd-o-phonic Todd, the disc jockey\n\nat WFMU. Todd told him, “You have to come to the Bowery Ballroom on 4 December. Yo La Tengo is having a stand, and it’s a surprise.” Kaye was intrigued, both as a fan of the Hoboken, New Jersey, group and their habit of introducing unexpected musical guests. “I really didn’t know what to expect,” he recalls. “I thought maybe Ronnie Spector might show up.”\n\nKaye turned up at the ballroom, and was soon approached by his disc-jockey friend.\n\n“He whispered to me and pulled me aside into the anteroom,” Kaye says. “He looked at me and said, ‘Voilà: The Strangeloves!’ And I cracked up. I thought it was the greatest thing.”\n\nA reunion of the 60s group that scored a 1965 hit with I Want Candy was a fairly unlikely event, and it was one that held special resonance for Kaye. Though the group – described as three sheep-herding brothers from Australia – had ceased to exist by 1968, their music was brought to a new generation a few years later, thanks to Kaye. The Strangeloves’ catchy, hard-driving Night Time (a minor hit at No 30 on the US single charts) was featured on Nuggets, the feted 1972 2LP set curated by the journalist-musician.\n\nA decade later, Bow Wow Wow released a cover of The Strangeloves’ best-known song. Their remake of I Want Candy went Top 40 in seven countries, including a No 9 showing in the UK. And at least three more remakes –\n\nby Candy Girls, Aaron Carter and Spice Girl, Melanie C – all did nearly as well around the world. The enduring appeal of the song built around a Bo Diddley beat is a testament to the appeal of the songwriting team of Bob Feldman, Jerry Goldstein and Richard Gottehrer (plus Bang Records head, Bert Berns).\n\nThe Australian origin of The Strangeloves was a total ruse: in fact, they were three Jewish guys from New York City, Brill Building songwriters who had come together in 1962 as a production team.\n\nBob Feldman recalls how they started working together. “Jerry and I already worked as a publishing firm, Bob & Jerry Music,” he says.\n\nBack in 1959, when the plane carrying Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and JP ‘The Big Bopper’ Richardson crashed, Goldstein and Feldman penned and recorded A Letter To Donna, issued as The Kittens. “We called a session on a Saturday, pressed the records on Sunday, and the record was released on Monday,” Feldman says. “It hit the charts the following week, and two weeks later it was off the charts.” They knew how to capitalise on events and trends.\n\nIn 1962, the duo got the opportunity to pitch some songs to Nat ‘King’ Cole’s publishing company. “We had a 12 o’clock appointment, and we got there 10 minutes early,” Feldman recalls. Also in the waiting room was a songwriter they didn’t know, Richard Gottehrer. “And he had an 11 o’clock appointment!”\n\nBy 12:30, “We still hadn’t got called in,” Feldman says. “One of us kept asking, ‘What time is it?’” There was a piano in the room, so the three decided to make good use of their time. They wrote a song together: “What Time Is It?” would be a pop hit (No 62, US) for The Jive Five.\n\nAs the clock struck 1pm, the three songwriters were still awaiting their audience with the great man. “Bobby Lewis had had a hit already with Tossin’ And Turnin’,” Feldman says with a laugh. “So, we wrote I’m Tossin’ And Turnin’ Again for him.” With two new songs to their credit, the three men decided to forget about their meeting with Cole. “We walked out the door, shook hands, and we changed Bob & Jerry Music to Grand Canyon Music,”\n\nhe says. “We became partners that day.”\n\nThey walked over to nearby Beltone Records – home to Bobby Lewis – and immediately sold the freshly-written sequel tune. “The first two songs we ever wrote, both got cut,” Feldman says. They were given a desk at Beltone. “We became friends, and we became a writing team,” says Gottehrer. “We stopped writing with other people; we just wrote with each other.”\n\nTwo weeks later, Feldman was approached by “a very slick gentleman in a sharkskin suit” named Wes Farrell. Farrell was in the midst of a years-long hot streak; he eventually penned over 500 songs, many of them hits for the likes of The Animals, The Shirelles and Jay & The Americans.\n\n“I hear you’re the hot writers in town,” Farrell said to the trio. “How would you like to have the follow-up to Palisades Park?”\n\nFeldman and his partners were a bit wary; they weren’t sure Farrell could deliver on giving them the opportunity to write Freddy Cannon’s next tune. Feldman vividly recalls his reply. “If you can get us the follow up to Palisades Park, we’ll sign with you.” Farrell had a ready response.\n\n“I’m glad you said that, because we’re leaving for Philadelphia tomorrow morning to play them the song.”\n\nThe team now calling itself FGG Productions responded in unison: “What song?” “The one you’re writing tonight,” Farrell coolly replied. So, Feldman and his partners wrote the tune on the train from New York to Philly.\n\nWhen it’s suggested that the story sounds like a scene straight out of a motion picture, Feldman agrees. “Listen, our whole career has been [like] something out of a movie,” he says. A whirlwind of songwriting followed in the wake of those episodes. “We wrote songs on order for Chubby Checker, Dee Dee Sharp and others,” Gottehrer says. Snuff Garrett at Liberty was their next client. Feldman recalls, “He flew us out to California, put us in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard and said, ‘You don’t leave here until you got me at least two songs.’” They delivered.\n\nBack in New York City, FGG scored their biggest hit to date with a girl-group classic, My Boyfriend’s Back. Feldman recalls how the song (US No 1, UK No 50) came about. “I was in a corner sweet shop having an egg cream, and there was a girl standing in the back, screaming. ‘My boyfriend’s back! You’re going to be in trouble. You’ve been saying things about me that aren’t true, and when my boyfriend gets a hold of you, he’s going to beat the shit out of you, asshole!’”\n\nFeldman grabbed a napkin and a pencil and took notes. “I borrowed a phone, and called Richard and Jerry. I said, ‘Do me a favour. Do not leave the office tonight.\n\nI won’t even wait for the subway. I will take a cab to the city. I heard a No 1 song today.’” When he got to the office, he and his partners got right to work. “The whole song was written that night,” he says. “Two weeks later, Richard came up with the key line, ‘If I were you, I’d take a permanent vacation.’”\n\nGottehrer says that the success of The Angels’ My Boyfriend’s Back meant that the FGG team started focusing on producing. The songs – many of them hits – kept coming at breakneck pace. “We learned to be producers by making demos,” he says.\n\nBut things changed quickly after The Beatles made their debut on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964; seemingly overnight, the market for the early 60s style of pop dried up. “Nobody wanted our product,” Feldman says. “We were talking about closing down.”\n\nThe songwriters realised they needed a new approach, a different angle. “The three of us were sitting around a table, smoking,” Feldman recalls. “We did a lot of cannabis in those days. So, we decided we’d make one more record.” For this new disc, they’d adopt an exotic collective persona. “We couldn’t claim to be from Liverpool, because everybody would call us out in a heartbeat. So, I invented Armstrong, Australia. We were big fans of the movie Dr Strangelove. So we were Miles, Niles and Giles Strange.”\n\nThe “Australian” band’s first single, Love, Love, featured a mid-song spoken part from Goldman. “I did this half-assed recitation in an awful accent,” he says with a laugh. “I mean, awful.” The song – released on Swan – only reached No 122 on the US singles charts. “But then we got a phone call from somebody called Gene Loving,” Gottehrer furthers. “He was a disc-jockey in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and he said, ‘If you guys come here and perform, I think I could make this No 1.’” Gottehrer was interested; he and his songwriting teammates hadn’t planned on performing in public, but their skills were suitable enough.\n\nLoving told Gottehrer that there was one small problem: “You told everybody you’re from Australia, and so you have to be Australian.” With zebra-striped vests and rented African drums, the trio showed up in Virginia to play their songs. “And sure enough, he made the record [a local] No 1,” Gottehrer says.\n\nBack in New York, the group approached Atlantic in hope of landing a deal, but were angrily shown the door by the label’s talent development head, Jerry Schoenbaum. “He was screaming that we were just white dudes bastardising rhythm and blues,” Feldman says.\n\nBut on their way out, the trio encountered Ahmet Ertegun. “Listen,”\n\nhe told them. “We’re starting a brand-new company with Bert Berns, called Bang Records.” They headed over to Bang and met Berns. He immediately invited the trio to collaborate with him on writing a new song.\n\n“There was a big X-rated book by Terry Southern called Candy,” Feldman says.\n\n“So Bert came up with a song title, I Want Candy.” After providing a few lines of rhyme, Berns took his leave. “Listen, guys, my wife just gave birth to my first child,” he told them. “Use the office, and stay as long as you want. We’ll finish the song tomorrow.”\n\n“He left,” Feldman says. “And we finished the song.”\n\nGottehrer says that when he, Feldman and Goldstein recorded the tune, they sought to make it unique. “The record is layered on a four-track machine,” he explains. “It’s layered and layered with multi-track vocals. There’s two full sets\n\nof drums, plus we were pounding on the African drums. And there’s that great guitar lead. The record was designed to be powerful, which I think we accomplished.”\n\nOnstage, the band was a mix of incongruous elements. The typical American audience member of 1965 wouldn’t have known that Australia had neither zebras nor African drums.\n\nAnd things got even weirder when The Strangeloves went on TV. “We were on Hullabaloo,” Gottehrer recalls. “We were introduced by Sammy Davis Jr, who did the boogaloo during our performance. And for some reason, they put\n\nus in an African hut!\n\nYou can see it online, if you want a laugh.”\n\n“Nobody in the US in 1965 really knew any Australians,” Gottehrer says with a chuckle. He recalls doing a TV interview in character. “The girl said, ‘Whoa, guys. You’re fantastic, but you know … you don’t look like brothers.’ And I remember saying something like, ‘Me mum’s spent time in the bush.’”\n\nThe Strangeloves’ live set also featured a tune written by Berns and Farrell. “It was called My Girl Sloopy,” Gottehrer says. “But we changed it to Hang On Sloopy.” The song’s history took a turn when The Strangeloves played in middle America. “We were on a Dick Clark tour, pretending to be Australian in Tulsa, Oklahoma,” Gottehrer recalls. The Dave Clark Five was on the tour, too. And when they heard Hang On Sloopy, they decided they liked it.\n\n“We got offstage, and one of them said, ‘That was great. We’ve taped that,’” Gottehrer says. The British band announced their intention to cut their own version and release it as their next single. But The Strangeloves had already recorded their own version. So they got Ricky Zehringer – lead singer of Rick & The Raiders, later known as Rick Derringer – to record a new vocal over their existing track. Released as The McCoys, the record beat The Dave Clark Five’s version to the marketplace. It reached No 1 in the US.\n\nThe Strangeloves would release only one LP during their time together: the 12-song I Want Candy featured nine originals, plus their original recording of Sloopy, along with covers of Gary US Bonds’ New Orleans and The Rolling Stones’ Satisfaction. The back of the LP sported a fanciful bio of the group, telling the tale of how the Strange brothers earned their fortune by developing a breed of long-haired sheep, suspiciously named Gottehrer Sheep. (The same essay also claimed that Love, Love was “one of Australia’s top hits of early 1965.” It wasn’t).\n\nWhile there have been some reissues of the original vinyl record in Germany and Japan, US label Real Gone Music’s 2019 limited-run, mono release is the first pressing from an English-speaking country since the album’s original release.\n\nBecause they hadn’t sought to become a touring band, GGF eventually enlisted other musicians to appear onstage as The Strangeloves. “As we were coming to the end of our time together, there was a band of young musicians who were integrated with the studio musicians to make the records,” Gottehrer explains. “We allowed them to be the ‘road’ Strangeloves.\n\nWe gave them the drums and the vests.”\n\nFeldman insists that The Strangeloves were invited to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show. “Richard denies it,” he says with a laugh, “but I’m telling you the truth.”\n\nBy his account, they turned Sullivan down, lest Feldman’s grandmother find out he was skipping college classes for a career in music. “The Dean at NYU Law School called up Richard’s mother and said, ‘Mrs Gottehrer, is Richard okay?’ ‘Well, yeah.’ ‘He hasn’t been to school for three months.’ His mother said, ‘He leaves here every day for school.’”\n\nFeldman pauses to deliver the punch-line. “This woman never knew what we were doing until we put something like 20 or 30 grand in cash on her counter and said, ‘This is what we’ve been doing.’”\n\nGottehrer, Feldman and Goldstein went on to release other singles under the Strangeloves name (Hand Jive and Honey Do from 1968) and in other fanciful guises, but none of those singles cracked the US Top 40. The team eventually split, though they remained friends. Gottehrer went on to work for Sire, and became an in-demand producer, working in the studio with The Go-Go’s, Marshall Crenshaw, Richard Hell & The Voidoids, The Fleshtones, and others. In 1997, he founded a music and entertainment company, The Orchard. Goldstein worked behind the scenes as well, managing Sly Stone and Isaac Hayes and producing albums by War. Feldman retired to Florida, but kept the zebra vests and the African drums handy; he’s currently working on a book, I Want Candy:\n\nA Strange Love Story. “We had our first appearance together in 53 years in December 2018,” Feldman says with pride. “With 18 minutes rehearsal.” The FGG trio reunited for what’s likely to be a once-in-a-lifetime event, wearing their trademark vests and pounding on the drums while Yo La Tengo backed them up. “You couldn’t fit another person in the place,” Feldman says. “They didn’t announce who the special guest was going to be,” Gottehrer says. “And then at midnight, here we go!”\n\nBecause they were able to pick up where the pre-Beatles pop era ended, effectively becoming a group themselves, the trio of Feldman, Goldstein and Gottehrer managed to make a mark on music and pop culture. And with a boost thanks to Lenny Kaye’s Nuggets set and many cover versions of Strangeloves songs, their music endures to this day.\n\nGottehrer points out that many of the artists in punk rock’s vanguard acknowledge a debt to the music of The Strangeloves and their contemporaries. “The emergence of punk is very much rooted\n\nin music of the song-driven music of the mid-to-late 60s,”\n\nhe contends.\n\n“The Strangeloves were born out of necessity,” Feldman decides, finally. “But it’s been a blessing.”\n\nThe Strangeloves’ 1965 LP I Want Candy is on Real Gone Music."
