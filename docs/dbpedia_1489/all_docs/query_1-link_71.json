        "text": "Blues artist Big Maybelle then had a hit on the R&B charts with her 1956 cover, which was inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nAnd in 1974 vocal jazz quartet The Manhattan Transfer brought Candy back into the public eye with their version.\n\nVarious renditions of Candy have appeared in contemporary film and TV soundtracks, including Jo Stafford and Johnny Mercer’s in “Bugsy” (1991), Doctor John’s in “The Night We Never Met” (1993), and The Nat King Cole Trio’s in “Home for the Holidays” (1995). The song has also been featured in such TV series as “Cold Case” and “The Cosby Show.”\n\nCandy is a simple heartfelt love song promising a happy ending, a perfect counterpoint to the stresses of wartime: “Candy, it’s gonna be just dandy/ The day I take my Candy/\n\nAnd make her mine, all mine.”\n\nOther artists who have recorded Candy include Joan Brooks, Dick Brown, Don Byas with Teddy Wilson and Slam Stewart, Scott Hamilton, Ray Charles, Toronto vocal quartet The Crew Cuts, Vic Damone, Kitty Kallen, Joe Loss and His Orchestra, Marion Loveridge, Magic Strings, George Paxton, and numerous others. Jazz trumpeters Lee Morgan and Stan Getz have also covered the tune.\n\nAmy McConnell and William Sperandei performed Candy as recently as 2014 on their Juno-nominated album “Stealing Genius.”\n\nCandy remains popular with jazz bands and is performed as far away as South Africa.\n\nPianist, conductor and composer Alex Kramer (1903 – 1998) was born in Montreal. After studying music at McGill Conservatory, he conducted radio orchestras and was a vocal coach. He left Canada to pursue a career in New York City. He married big-band singer Joan Whitney (1914 – 1990, born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and together they wrote numerous hits such as Far Away Places, There’s Nobody Here but Us Chickens, and Love Somebody. Kramer and Whitney wrote more than 100 songs, many of which ended up as song sheet classics.\n\nMack David (1912 – 1993) was born in New York City. He wrote songs for Tin Pan Alley and Hollywood, and is in the U.S. Songwriters Hall of Fame."
