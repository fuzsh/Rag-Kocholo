        "text": "You’ll never forget your first crush … or your first boy band! Although the term wasn't used until the 1980s, all-male vocal groups have a much longer history than that. Their precursors date to the 1800s as barbershop quartets, typically a group of four men singing a capella with exquisite harmony and precise phrasing.\n\nOne of the earliest all-male groups that achieved international fame as a \"boy band\" was the , formed in 1932. The group also played tenor guitars and a cello to accompany themselves, and they developed their own distinctive style, which influenced the development of the doo-wop sound. The '40s and '50s saw more interest in all-male groups, and by the '60s, the popularity of these kinds of acts was at its peak. Some groups added dance moves or performed in costumes or tuxes. As time went on, many groups became adept playing instruments, as well as performing harmonizing vocals. Although there’s not one defining feature for the all-male groups that have captured each generation's attention, the fundamentals are the same: Strong harmonies, memorable tunes and throngs of (screaming) fans!\n\nHere’s what boy band was popular the year you were born:\n\nArricca Elin SanSone is a freelance writer, editor, and digital content developer.
