        "text": "As a senior in High School, Bob joined the All City Choir in Brooklyn NY alongside the likes of Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond and Lanie Kazan. He was a dancer on the Alan Freed TV Show and co-wrote his TV theme song \"The Big Beat.\" Feldman became part of a three-member team consisting of himself along with Jerry Goldstein, and Richard Gottehrer, ‒ often going by FGG Productions who scored big hits for other artists including 1963's \"My Boyfriend's Back\" by the American female group, The Angels. Feldman and Goldstein had also recorded a couple of non-charting singles as the duo \"Bob & Jerry\" in 1961-62, and between 1959-61 had been members of various non-charting studio-based recording groups such as Bobbi and the Beaus, Ezra and the Iveys, and The Kittens. In 1964, due to the prevalence of British Invasion-style beat groups and in order to keep up with market trends, FGG decided to \"create\" a ready-made foreign beat group consisting of themselves; deciding that they couldn't convincingly fake British accents, they opted to pretend to be Australians of \"The Strangeloves. According to the press releases and publicity material issued about the group, The Strangeloves were three brothers named Giles, Miles, and Niles Strange who were raised on an Australian sheep farm. The brothers' fictional backstory involved getting rich with the invention of a new form of sheep crossbreeding (the long-haired \"Gottehrer\" sheep allegedly registered with the Feldman-Goldstein Company of Australia) which allowed them the time and financial freedom to form a band. The story did not exactly capture the public's imagination, but The Strangeloves' singles still performed exceptionally well, especially in the United States. The Strangeloves' first 1964 single, \"Love, Love (That's All I Want from You)\", was actually released under the group name, \"Strange Loves,\" and reached No. 122 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The group's second single \"I want Candy\" is a famous example of a song that uses the Bo Diddley beat. It reached No. 11 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, became a top 10 hit in Canada and hit No. 11 in the US in 1965. It has been the most used song in commercials, TV shows and major films for the past decade. The FGG trio also collaborated on a charting 1965 single credited to The Beach-Nuts, and took on the guise of \"The Sheep\" for two charting singles in 1966. As well, Feldman and Goldstein (without Gottehrer) recorded charting hits as Rome & Paris in 1966, and as \"The Rock & Roll Dubble Bubble Trading Card Co. of Philadelphia 19141\" in 1969. Feldman and Gottehrer also issued a non-charting 1970 single (\"Right On\" b/w \"Shakey Jakes\") as \"The Strange Bros. Show\". Bob has sold over 50 million songs worldwide. With #1 songs in nearly every country. His songs have remained on the charts for 7 decades and appeared in scores of Movies, TV shows, Trailers and Promos and major TV commercials. Many recognized artists have sampled or recorded his work including Johnny Mathis, Chubby Checker, Jerry Lee Lewis, Tony Orlando, Dion, Frankie Avalon, Ryder, Fabien, David Bowie, Neil Diamond, The Black Eyed Peas, Gnarls Barkley, Bauhaus, The J. Geils Band, The Neville Brothers,. Melissa Manchester, The Fleshtones, Aaron Carter, George Thorogood, and Bow Wow Wow. Bob lives in Deerfield Beach, FL. and is actively writing and producing. Inspired by Mel Torme's last appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman on Wednesday September 27th, 1995. Letterman asked \"You've done so many things in your life. Is there anything you regret?\" Torme replied \"Yes, I regret there'll never be a brand new Gershwin song\" Now, taking a page from the many hits of George and Ira Gershwin, the songwriting duo featuring Bob Feldman and Ben Bagby present \"A Brand New Gershwin Song.\" www.abrandnewgershwinsong.com, released in May 2019 with a complete list of cover arrangements, performance tracks and sheet music. Feldman's release of \"Simply Put!\", reveals his thoughts and feelings about relationships. Tony Orlando says of Simply Put! “This book is a guide to love, family and friendship that gives insights from one man’s lifelong search for love, acceptance and laughter.” He goes on to say “Johnny Mathis, David Bowie, Neil Diamond, and Dion are but a few icons who have recorded his thoughts and feelings, and I’m proud to say “yours truly” as well.” Bob’s songs, with their heartfelt lyrics and melodies were born from his life experiences and relationships and have remained in the top 100 charts for 7 decades! Somewhere, someplace, sometime, anywhere in the world, a song written, produced, published or sung by Bob Feldman can be heard playing 24/7, 365 days of the year.\n\nRead full bio"
