        "text": "When a song becomes popular, sometimes people forget (or are unaware) that the new hitÂ actually originated with another artist. The popular cover might be ahead of its time or re-arranged with a fresher, more modern take, but somehow it managed to find a bigger audience than the original.\n\n1. âTornâ â Natalie Imbruglia (1997) //Â Ednaswap (1995)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nIn 1997, pop star Natalie Imbrugliaâs âTornâ was a No. 1 hit throughout Europe, the United States, and her native Australia. But the song was first performed and recorded by Los Angeles-based alternative band Ednaswap for their 1995 self-titled debut.\n\nA number of recording artists throughout the years have covered the song, but Imbrugliaâs version is the most successful and popular iteration of the hit single, and itÂ earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\n\n2. âDonât Turn Aroundâ â Ace of Base (1994) // Tina Turner (1986)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nSwedish pop group Ace of Base released a hit single titled âDonât Turn Aroundâ in 1994. The song reached the #4 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the pop groupâs third hit song after âAll That She Wantsâ and âThe Sign.â Songwriters Diane Warren and Albert Hammond (of âIt Never Rains in Southern Californiaâ fame) originally wrote âDonât Turn Aroundâ for Tina Turner and were disappointed when the record label relegated it to the B-side of the single âTypical Manâ in 1986.\n\nNeil Diamond also covered the song in 1992, but Ace of Baseâs version is the most popular.\n\n3. âGirls Just Want ToÂ Have Funâ â Cyndi Lauper (1983) // Robert Hazard (1979)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nCyndi Lauperâs first hit single as a solo artist, âGirls Just Want ToÂ Have Fun,â reached the No. 2 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1983. Lauper was nominated for two Grammys for the song, including Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Performance. Self-proclaimed Country-Western fan Robert HazardÂ originally wrote and recorded âGirls Just Want ToÂ Have Funâ as a demo for his band Robert Hazard and the Heroes in 1979. (Hazard never released his version, though.)\n\n4. âTainted Love\" â Soft Cell (1981) // Gloria Jones (1965)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nIn 1965, American singer Gloria Jones recorded the original version of âTainted Loveâ as the B-side to the single âMy Bad Boyâs Cominâ Home.â The song was a commercial failure, but gained a small cult following in underground British nightclubs in the late '70s. English synth-pop duo Soft Cell recorded a modern version of âTainted Loveâ in 1981. Soft Cellâs version was a No. 1 hit in eight countries, while it reached the No. 8 spot in the United States in 1982.\n\n5. âRespectâ â Aretha Franklin (1967) // Otis Redding (1965)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nIn 1965,Â Otis Redding wrote and recorded the song âRespect.\" Two years later, R&B singer Aretha Franklin popularized it, and the song became her signature. Both versions have the similar lyrics (though Franklin'sÂ added the \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\" chorus to the song), but Franklinâs invokes female empowerment while Reddingâs is a euphemism for sex.Â\n\n6. âI Love Rock 'n' Rollâ â Joan Jett and the Blackhearts (1981) // Arrows (1975)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nAlan Merrill and Jake Hookerâthe frontmen of the British rock band Arrowsâwrote and recorded the anthem âI Love Rock ânâ Rollâ in 1975. The song got the band a TV appearance on the show 45, which eventually led to the band getting its own TV show based on their performance of the song. In 1976, while she was on tour in England with her band The Runaways, Joan Jett watched Arrows perform the song on their show.\n\nThen, in 1981, Joan Jett recorded a version of âI Love Rock ânâ Rollâ with her new band The Blackhearts. ItÂ became a No. 1 hit single in the United States for seven weeks and was certified platinum when it sold over one million units.\n\n7. âNothing Compares 2 U\" â Sinead OâConnor (1990) // The Family (1985)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nMusic icon Prince wrote and originally recorded the song âNothing Compares 2 Uâ for his side project The Family in 1985.Â While the song received little recognition, Irish singer SinÃ©ad O'Connor popularized it in 1990. O'Connor won three Moonmen Awards at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards for Video of the Year, Best Female Video, and Best Post-Modern Video.\n\n8. âHey Joeâ â The Jimi Hendrix Experience (1966) // The Leaves (1965)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nWhile the authorship of the song âHey Joeâ is ambiguous and unclear, the earliest recording of the song datesÂ to 1965,Â by the California-based garage band The Leaves.\n\nâHey Joeâ was a modest hit for The Leaves, but it was The Jimi Hendrix Experience's first hit single overseas in 1966. It peaked at No. 6 on the U.K. Singles Chart in 1967, but it failed to gain any recognition in the United States. Over the years, the song became iconic; Rolling Stone placed it at #201 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n9. âItâs Oh So Quietââ BjÃ¶rk (1995) // Betty Hutton (1951)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nIn 1995, Icelandic solo artist BjÃ¶rk released a cover song titled âItâs Oh So Quiet,â which American actress/singer Betty Hutton first recorded in 1951. The song was a B-side to Huttonâs single âMurder, He Says.â\n\nâItâs Oh So Quietâ remains BjÃ¶rkâs biggest hit, peaking at the No. 4 spot in the United Kingdom. The songâs popularity was partly due to director Spike Jonzeâs infectious music video that included large dance numbers and sweeping camera movements.\n\n10. âManic Mondayâ â The Bangles (1986) //Â Apollonia 6 (1984)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nPrince wrote âManic Mondayâ for his female trio band Apollonia 6 for their self-titled debut in 1984.Â Ultimately, he pulled the song from the album and later offered it to the band The Bangles under the pseudonym âChristopher,â a character he played in the 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon. âManic Mondayâ was a huge hit for The Bangles, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 listâjust behind Prince and the Revolutionâs âKiss.â\n\n11. âHound Dogâ â Elvis Presley (1956) // Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton (1953)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nSongwriting duo Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller wrote âHound Dogâ for Willie Mae âBig Mamaâ Thornton in 1953.Â While Thorntonâs original version was a No. 1 hit on the R&B charts for seven weeks, Elvis Presleyâs iteration immediately became the most popular after its 1956 release. Presleyâs version was a crossover success that spent 11 weeks on the top of country, pop, and R&B charts simultaneously. âHound Dogâ was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the â500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.â\n\n12. âCum On Feel The Noize\" â Quiet Riot (1983) // Slade (1973)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nIn 1973, British glam rock band Slade released âCum On Feel The Noize,\" which went straight to the top of the chartsÂ in the United Kingdom and Ireland and was a top 10 single throughout parts of Europe.Â Ten years later, American heavy metal band Quiet Riot recorded and popularized song in the United States. The single reached the No. 5 spot on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n13. âI Want Candy\" â Bow Wow Wow (1982) // The Strangeloves (1965)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nAmerican music producers Bert Berns, Bob Feldman, Jerry Goldstein, and Richard Gottehrer recorded a bubblegum pop tune titled âI Want Candyâ in 1965. Donning shaggy wigs and zebra-print vests, Feldman, Goldstein, and Gottehrer took it upon themselves to perform the song as the fauxÂ Australian pop trio The Strangeloves.Â In 1982, British New Wave band Bow Wow Wow released âI Want Candy,â with its music video receiving heavy airplay and rotation during the early days of MTV. Although Bow Wow Wow would have many admirers throughout the years, including Red Hot Chili Peppers and No Doubt, this was the bandâs only hit song in the U.S.\n\n14. âI Think Weâre Alone Now\" â Tiffany (1987) // Tommy James and the Shondells (1967)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nIn 1967, American songwriter Ritchie Cordell wrote the single âI Think Weâre Alone Nowâ for the rock band Tommy James and the Shondells. The song was a hit, reaching the No. 4 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Twenty year later, âI Think Weâre Alone Nowâ was popularized by teen recording artist Tiffany, whose version reached the top spot on Billboardâs list for two weeks. Its music video launched the then-16-year-old into pop music stardom. Interestingly,Â Tiffany's songÂ was replacedÂ at No. 1 by Billy Idolâs âMony Mony,â another cover of a Tommy James and the Shondells single.\n\n15. âWhen The Levee Breaks\" â Led Zeppelin (1971) // Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie (1929)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nIn 1971, British rock band Led Zeppelin re-arranged and popularized the song âWhen the Levee Breaksâ for their fourth album, which is referred to as Led Zeppelin IV. Husband and wife singer-songwriters Kansas Joe McCoy & Memphis Minnie originally recorded âWhen the Levee Breaksâ as a blues song in 1929 about the Great Mississippi Flood that took place a few years earlier. But Led Zeppelinâs arena rock anthem became an iconic piece of music from the '70s, and the song would go on to be highly influential among rock bands and hip-hop artists since its release.\n\n16. âHard To Handleâ â The Black Crowes (1990) // Otis Redding (1968)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nPosthumously released on the aptly titled âThe Immortal Otis Reddingâ in 1968, âHard To Handleâ was a fitting single for a legendary musician. While the single only reached No. 38 on the R&B charts, a cover by the Georgia-basedÂ band The Black Crowes was theirÂ breakthrough singleâit reached the No.Â 1 spot on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks in 1990.\n\n17. âI Swearâ â All-4-One (April 1994) // John Michael Montgomery (1993)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nAmerican songwriters Gary Baker and Frank J. Myers wrote the love ballad âI Swearâ for country music recording artist John Michael Montgomery, who released it in December 1993. The single reached the No. 1 spot on the U.S. Hot Country Singles and Tracks chart, and crossed over to theÂ Billboard Hot 100, hitting No. 42.\n\nA few months later in April 1994, the R&B quartet All-4-One released their rendition of âI Swear,â which became a bigger hit than the original. Their version reached No. 1 on the Hot 100 and was certified Platinum by the end of 1994.\n\n18. âDonât Chaâ â The Pussycat Dolls (April 2005) // Tori Alamaze (March 2005)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nIn March 2005, recording artist Tori Alamaze released âDonât Chaâ as her debut single. When the song failed to gain mainstream attention, Universal Records dropped Alamaze from their label and the songâs producer CeeLo Green gave the song to the girl group The Pussycat Dolls.\n\nJust one month later, The Pussycat Dolls released âDonât Chaâ as their debut single, and the song received positive reviews and reached No. 2 onÂ Billboard. The Pussycat Dollsâ version went on to sell more than 6 million copies worldwide, while Alamaze was all but forgotten.\n\n19. âThe Tide Is Highâ â Blondie (1980) // The Paragons (1967)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nThe Paragons were a Jamaican ska/rockstead band whose vocal harmonies were influenced by American soul and R&B groups. In 1967, they released a single called âThe Tide is High,â written by band member John Holt. Thirteen years later, Blondie guitarist Chris Stein discovered the track on a reggae compilation album heâd bought in England. Blondie recorded it for their Autoamerican album, adding strings and a horn section (borrowed from Johnny Carsonâs Tonight Show band). âThe Tide is Highâ went on to become Blondieâs second No. 1 single.\n\n20. âBlack and Whiteâ â Three Dog Night (1972) // Greyhound (1971)\n\nThe Cover\n\nThe Original\n\nâBlack and Whiteâ was written in 1954 by David Arkin and Earl Robinson in response to the Brown vs The Topeka Board of Education Supreme Court decision that outlawed racial segregation in U.S. public schools. Several artists recorded the tuneâPete Seeger and Sammy Davis Jr. among themâbut a British reggae group called Greyhound took it to the U.K. Top 10 in 1971. A year later, American band Three Dog Night recorded the song and topped both the Billboard pop and easy listening charts."
