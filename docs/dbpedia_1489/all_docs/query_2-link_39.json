        "text": "You can find this sermon at ChurchAges.net\n\n1 Let us bow our heads for prayer. Dear heavenly Father, we hear this song of \"Only Believe,\" it makes us to know that that's all we have to do to inherit any of God's promises, just believe them. For it is written, \"All things are possible to them that believe.\" As we cry, as the man who had the epileptic child, \"Lord, I believe! Help Thou my unbelief.\"\n\nWe thank Thee for Thy great power, Thy great revelation of Thyself to us in this last days. It makes our heart most happy and joyful, to know that we have come in contact with the living God; who vindicates it right back in physical, material evidences, as He did in the days gone by, and as He has promised for this day. We're so grateful to Thee, our God. This dark day where no one seems to know which way to go, we're so glad that we found the safety zone, the retreat.\n\nNow bless us tonight, Lord, as we speak of Thy Word. And the promises that's given to us, may we nurture them in our hearts, cherish them with reverence, and obey them with real godly discipline. For we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.\n\nMark 9:23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.\n\n2 [Someone speaks to Brother Branham.] A love offering? They shouldn't have done that. Who did that? You guilty? I was getting on the manager. He said that he took a love offering for me. He shouldn't have done that. I appreciate it, God knows that, but I never come for that. Thank you. May the Lord bless you. I'll do everything I can. I'll put it right in foreign missions, so I'll know it'll go for the kingdom of God. And if the Lord willing, I'll take it, myself, over to the lands, to bring this same gospel that you've been sitting, listening to this week, then I know it'll be done in the way that you believed it. The Lord help me to do it.\n\nI am very grateful for the great attendance this week, and for all you people that's hooked up tonight again with the wires of the telephone. And we're grateful to each and every one of you.\n\n3 Billy said to me this morning, he said, \"Daddy, if you would have come with me this morning, early, right after daylight, and stand out here around in these places and watch mothers feeding their babies in the car, them poor people sitting in that rain, waiting for the doors to open!\" You see what a hypocrite I'd be if I told you anything but the truth? I would really be a foul person. Sometimes I have to hurt, but it's not because that I want to, it's because... It's not me that's hurting. It's truth that hurts. But I believe that's the reason you come, because I'm deadly sincere with you, and do all that I can to help you. The Lord help each and every one of you.\n\n4 And now I want to thank the people for their fine cooperation, the people of the city here, also, who gave us ... let us have the renting of this schoolhouse, this auditorium and the gym. And I want to thank the officials if you're here. And also I want to thank Houston Colvin, which is the custodian here, for his fine cooperation in helping us to get this and being with us each night.\n\nWe thank the Jeffersonville police force for coming up here and watching, with a real cheap cost. I think about two dollars a hour, that the police were put up here on special duty, to park the cars, to see that there was nothing happened, and everything was all right. We're grateful to the people for that. And also, the engineer here on the board, I've noticed him. And all that's affiliated with this, we are certainly grateful to you.\n\n5 I thank each and every one of you for the gifts. Billy just brought me, this afternoon, a gift, several of them, in boxes, candy, and so forth. And one of them was the Beatitudes, with a picture of Christ worked in it---the sermon on the mount. It certainly was beautiful. I certainly thank you. And so many things, I don't know how to thank you for it. And then, also, for your sponsoring, financing the meeting, we certainly do appreciate it, with all of our heart. The Lord bless each one of you, richly.\n\nBilly said, there was many people, you had been asking for private interviews during the time. And many asked and had little babies to be dedicated. Oh, how I want to do that!\n\nBut, you see, when I come this time, it's so urgent. I have to stay right, all the time, in study, this Word and prayer, on account of bringing these messages. See, they're not... They're extraordinary to us, because it's finding the will of God and then speaking the things. And all that has to meet together, and asking God just which one to open up.\n\n6 Now, the Lord willing, we'll be back again soon, as soon as we can find a day. I made a motion, or said something about Easter. I better check that, because I think I've got a schedule in California along about that time. So that may be wrong. However, when we return again to the Tabernacle, we'll send you a card---the church---and give you the date and time. Then I'll, maybe at that time, again...\n\nI haven't put any time to praying for the sick. We haven't had one service that we brought the people up and prayed for them. We've been sending them out. And our brethren here has been preaching, Brother Lee Vayle and Brother... These other brothers has been preaching, and praying for the sick, and doing the water baptism, baptizing, rather, and letting me stay alone with the Word. We thank these men. They done a gallant job.\n\n7 There is so many friends here I'd like to meet. I look down and see John and Earl. And there is Dr. Lee Vayle, one of the managers of the campaign. Brother Roy Borders. Them men, I haven't even got... I haven't even no more than shook their hand. I haven't had a chance to. I think of my friends from Kentucky, and around in here, minister friends, how I would like to shake their hands! Brother Blair, I noticed him here the other day, and many of those men that I love, and they've been to several meetings, I've never even as much as shook their hand. I'm trying... It isn't because I don't want to do that; it's because I haven't the time to do it, and I just hurry.\n\n8 Dedicating the babies, sure. My own son, my little grandson was supposed to be dedicated at this meeting. I haven't had time to do it; little David. I'm grandpa, twice now. So, Mr. May, if he's here tonight, give me that cane, look like I'm going to have to use it pretty soon.\n\nAnd I told Billy, I said, \"The Bible did say multiply and replenish the earth, but the whole burden wasn't given to you.\" These grandsons are appearing fast.\n\nAnd so, remember, my daughter-in-law was barren, to begin with, she could not have no children. And one day leaving a meeting the Lord spoke to me and said, \"Loyce, you will bare a son. The Lord has blessed you. Your female trouble is gone.\" Little Paul was born nine months later.\n\n9 Two months before this baby come on the scene, I was sitting, eating breakfast one morning, at the table, and Loyce and Billy was sitting across the table from me. And I seen Loyce feeding a little baby with a pink ... or a blue blanket wrapped around it. And Billy was sitting in the corner, feeding little Paul. I said, \"Billy, I just saw a vision. Loyce was feeding a baby wrapped in a blue blanket.\"\n\nHe said, \"There goes my hunting trip. That's just nine months from now.\"\n\nEleven months later, little David was born. And I haven't been able to dedicate him to the Lord yet, and will not until we return again. So you see what it is.\n\n10 How I love people and their fellowship! But our brethren has been praying for the sick, and I know it's a success. Each night we prayed for the sick, one laying their hands on the other, all of us together, which that way it catches the whole scope. But maybe, if God willing---I'll mark it on the card, if we send it---coming back, I'd like to dedicate about two or three days, again, just to praying for the sick and doing what we can in that manner. Now, and I thank the people for their help, again.\n\n11 Now I just want to comment, just a moment, on the morning's message. There's no doubt, I didn't get completely through with it, but I think you understand. And I'm sure you didn't ... you'll never know what that was for me to do.\n\nNow, it seems very simple to you. But, you see what you're doing? You are taking the place of God, to pronounce something. And before I would do that, it had to come an answer from God. And He had to come down, and He visibly showed Himself, and gave the revelation. Therefore, see, this is to the church. And remember, I said, \"This what I said, was to the church only.\"\n\nAnd so that you might have confidence and know, that was the same God that said to me up there where there was no squirrels. \"Speak, and say where they'll be.\" And three straight times it happened. Now, if He can by that same word create something that isn't there, how much more will this hold fast at the day of judgment! See? People were there to see these things, and know. As Paul said, in the days gone by. There's men with him who felt the earth shake; and didn't hear the voice, but they seen the pillar of fire.\n\nActs 9:7 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.\n\nActs 22:9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.\n\n12 It done me good, though, after it was over; to see husbands and wives, that I know is genuine Christians, hugging one another and weeping.\n\nListen, friends, God confirms His Word with signs and vindications, to prove that it's right, the spoken Word. Now remember, that light that was in that cloud, that gave the revelation.\n\nMy little girl was telling me, Sarah here, that when that school there in Arizona was looking up there on a cloudless sky, and seeing this cloud mysteriously in that mountain, going up-and-down, with an amber fire burning in it. The teacher dismissed the classes and the school, and brought them out front and said, \"Did you ever see anything like that? Look the way that's there.\"\n\nRemember, that's that same amber light that's on the rock. So it's the same God, same revelation, said, \"Tell them to do this.\" Is what I told you this morning, so there it is.\n\n13 If it happens to be that my good friend, Brother Roy Roberson, is listening in at Tucson. Roy, you remember, the other day, the vision you seen when we were out standing upon the mountain? You come up to me, and that cloud was over the top? Come walking down, you know what He told you; I told you at the house, the other day? That's it, Roy. Don't worry no more, son. It's over.\n\nYou just don't know what that means! It's grace. He loves you. You love Him, humbly serve Him and worship Him the rest of your days. Be happy, go ahead and live as you are. If you're happy, continue that way. Don't never do anything wrong again, like that. Just go ahead. It's God's grace.\n\n14 Now I want to pray again before we enter into the Word. How many will pray for me? I'm just going from meeting to meeting. Will you pray?\n\nYou know, I'd like to sing a little song, all of us together, before we go to the Word. Just so that we'd know God... Just a little dedication. Did you ever hear this little song, \"He Careth For You?\" \"Through sunshine and sorrow, He careth for you.\"\n\nThe little lady is coming up to the piano. Say, I want to thank this little lady, too. I didn't even know who she was. It's one of the deacon's daughters here. I certainly ... Brother Wheeler's little girl. She is growed up now. She was a little bitty thing that sat on my knee, not long ago, and now she's a young woman. So I certainly thank her that she's used her talent in music, and now she plays very sweetly. Would you give us a chord, sister? All of us together now.\n\nHe careth for you,\n\nHe careth for you;\n\nThrough sunshine or shadow,\n\nHe careth for you.\n\nDo you love that? Let's sing it again, all together.\n\nHe careth for you,\n\nHe careth for you;\n\nThrough sunshine or shadow,\n\nHe careth for you.\n\nBrother Dauch, He does for you, too, brother. Don't you love Him?\n\nLet us bow our heads now.\n\n15 Dear gracious God, with this little note here of a few things to say to the people, and back again to refer back to this morning, for that's what the people come to hear. I pray, God, that You'll let the people see that God loves and cares. And it was not me that give that, Lord, it was vindicated that it was the truth. So I pray, dear God, that Your love will always remain among the people. Tonight, to have to separate after this meeting and go to our different homes, it kind of pulls us, some deep, Lord. I pray that You'll bless these people.\n\nNow as we approach the Word, in prayer, and approach the written Word, we ask that You will take this written Word and make it alive to us tonight. And when we leave this building tonight to separate to go to our different homes, may we say like those who came from Emmaus, that had walked with Him all day and still didn't know Him; but when He got them inside the room that night, and the doors all shut, He did something just like He did before His crucifixion. By that, they knowed He had risen again.\n\nDo it again tonight, Lord. Grant it, while the doors are shut, and Your little group here is sitting, waiting. And, Father, when we go to our homes, we'll say like they did, \"Did not our hearts burn within us as He talked to us along the way!\" We commit ourselves, and all, in Your hands, Lord. Do with us as You see fit. In Jesus' name. Amen.\n\nLuke 24:13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.\n\nLuke 24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.\n\nLuke 24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.\n\nLuke 24:16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.\n\nLuke 24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.\n\nLuke 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.\n\nLuke 24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?\n\n16 Now let's get right into the service now, quickly. Turning now with me, if you will, to the book of Hebrews, and another revelation on the message. We'll speak for just a few moments tonight, the Lord willing. And then while reading the first three verses of Hebrews 7:1 to 3, and then commenting on this. And we don't know what the Lord will do; we do not know. The only thing we do is just believe, watch, pray. Is that right? And believe that \"He'll make everything work together for good to them that loves Him,\" because He promised to.\n\nFor this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;\n\nTo whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;\n\nLet's read a little farther.\n\nWithout father, without mother, without descent, ... neither beginning of days, or end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.\n\nRomans 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.\n\nHebrews 7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;\n\nHebrews 7:2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;\n\nHebrews 7:3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.\n\n17 Think of this great person, of how great this man must be! And now, the question is, \"Who is this man?\" Theologians has had different ideas. But since the opening of the seven seals, the mysterious book that's been mysterious to us... According to Revelation 10:1 to 7, all the mysteries that's wrote in this book, that's been hid down through the age of the reformers, is supposed to be brought out into view by the angel of the last church age. How many knows that's right? That's right, it's supposed to be brought. All the mysteries of the mysterious book is to be revealed to the Laodicea messenger of that age.\n\nSeeing there is much dispute about this person and this subject, I think it behooves us to break into it, to find out who this is. Now, there is several schools of thought on Him.\n\nOne of the schools are, claims, \"He's just a myth. He wasn't actually a person.\"\n\nAnd the others says, that, \"It was a priesthood, that was the Melchisedec priesthood.\" That's the most likely one, that hold better to that side than they do to the other, is because they say it was a priesthood.\n\nIt can't be that, for in the fourth verse it says He was a person ---a man. So, in order to be a person, He has to be a personality---a man. Not an order; but a person! So He was not just a priesthood order, neither was He a myth. He was a person.\n\nHebrews 7:4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.\n\nRevelation 10:7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.\n\n18 And the person is eternal. If you notice, \"He had no father. He had no mother. He had no time He ever began. And He had no time He ever ended.\" And ever who it was is still alive tonight, because the Bible said here, that, \"He had neither father, nor mother, beginning of days, or ending of life. So it would have to be an eternal person. Is that right? An eternal person! So it could only be one person, that's God, because He's the only one that's eternal---God!\n\nNow, in I Timothy 6:15 and 16, if you'd like to read that sometime, I'd like for you to read it. Now, the thing that I contend is, that, He was God, because He's the only person that can be immortal. And now, God changing Himself into person; that's what He was, \"No father, no mother, no beginning of life, no ending of days.\"\n\n1 Timothy 6:16 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.\n\nHebrews 7:3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.\n\n19 Now we find in the Scripture that many people teaches that---three personalities in the Godhead. So you cannot have a personality without being a person. It takes a person to make a personality.\n\nA Baptist minister, a few weeks ago, come up to my house and said, \"I'd like to straighten you out on the Godhead sometime when you got time\"---called me up, rather.\n\nI said, \"I got time right now.\" Because I want to be straight and we lay aside everything else to do it.\n\nAnd he come up, he said, \"Brother Branham, you teach that there is just one God.\"\n\nI said, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I believe there is one God, but one God in three persons.\"\n\nI said, \"Sir, repeat that again.\"\n\nHe said, \"One God in three persons.\"\n\nI said, \"Where did you go to school at?\" See? And he told me a Bible college. I said, \"I could believe that. You cannot be a person without being a personality. And if you're a personality, you are one personality to yourself. You're a separate, individual being.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"Well, the theologians can't even explain that.\"\n\nI said, \"It's by revelation.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"I can't accept revelation.\"\n\nI said, \"Then there's no way for God to ever get to you, because 'It's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and revealed to babes [revealed, revelation], revealed to babes such as will [accept it] learn.'\" And I said, \"There'd be no way for God to get to you; you close yourself off from Him.\"\n\nThe whole Bible is the revelation of God. The whole church is built upon the revelation of God. There is no other way to know God, only by revelation. \"To whom the Son will reveal Him.\" Revelation; everything is revelation. So, not to accept the revelation, then you're just a cold theologian, and there is no hope for you.\n\nMatthew 11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\n\nLuke 10:21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.\n\n20 Now, we find out that this person had no father, no mother, no beginning of days or ending of life. It was God, en morphe.\n\nNow, the word comes ... the Greek word, means \"change\" was used. Changing Himself, en morphe, from one person to... One person; the Greek word there en morphe means... It was taken from the stage act, that one person is changing his mask, to make him some other character.\n\nLike in school, just recently, I believe, Rebekah, just before she graduated, they had one of Shakespeare's plays. And one young man had to change his clothes several times, because he played two or three different parts; but, the same person. He come out, one time, he was a villain; and when he come out next time, he was another character. And now the Greek word en morphe means that he \"changed his mask.\"\n\nHebrews 7:3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.\n\n21 And that's what God did. It's the same God all the time. God in the form of the Father, the Spirit, the pillar of fire. The same God was made flesh and dwelt among us, en morphe, brought out so He could be seen. And now that same God is the Holy Ghost. Father, Son, Holy ... not three Gods; three offices, three acts of the one God.\n\nThe Bible said, \"There is one God,\" not three. But that's how that they couldn't... You can't get this straightened out and have three gods. You would never sell a Jew that. I'll tell you that. One who knows better, he knows there's only one God.\n\nJohn 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\n\n22 Notice, like the sculpture, he hides, with a mask over it. That's what God has done to this age. It's been hid. All these things has been hid, and is supposed to be revealed in this age. Now, the Bible says they would be revealed in the latter times. It's like a sculptor keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is.\n\nAnd that's what the Bible has been. It has been a work of God that's been covered up. And it's been hid since the foundation of the world, and its sevenfold mystery. And God promised in this day, at the age of this Laodicean church, He would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it. What a glorious thing!\n\nGod, en morphe, masked in a pillar of fire. God, en morphe, in a man called Jesus. God, en morphe, in His church. God above us, God with us, God in us; the condescending of God.Up there, holy, no one could touch Him, He settled upon the mountain; and even if a animal touched the mountain, had to die.\n\nAnd then God come down and changed His tent, and come down and lived with us, become one of us. \"And we held him,\" the Bible said. I Timothy 3:16, \"Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; for God was manifested in the flesh, handled by hands.\" God ate meat. God drank water. God slept. God cried. He was one of us. Beautiful, typed in the Bible!\n\nThat was God above us; God with us; now it's God in us, the Holy Spirit. Not the third person; the same person!\n\nExodus 19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:\n\nExodus 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.\n\n1 Timothy 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\n\n23 God came down and become flesh, and died the death, in Christ; so that He could clean the church, in order to get into it for fellowship. God loves fellowship. That's what He made the man at the first time for, was for fellowship; God dwelt alone, with cherubims.\n\nAnd notice now, He made man, and man fell. So He came down and redeemed man, because God loves to be worshipped. The very word god means \"object of worship.\"\n\nAnd this that comes among us, as a pillar of fire, as something that changes our hearts, that is the same God that said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nGenesis 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\n\nHebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n\n24 Now in the beginning, God dwelt alone with His attributes, as I spoke of this morning. That's His thoughts. There was nothing, just God alone, but He had thoughts.\n\nJust like a great architect can set down, in his mind, and draw out what he thinks he's going to build---create. Now, he cannot create, he can take something that's been created and make it in a different form; because God is the only one can create. But he gets in his mind what he's going to do, and that's his thoughts, that's his desires. Now it's a thought, and then he speaks it, and it's a word then. And a word is...\n\nA thought, when it's expressed, it's a word. A thought expressed is a word, but it has to be a thought first. So, it's God's attributes; then it becomes a thought, then a word.\n\n25 Notice. Those who have, tonight, eternal life, was with Him and in Him, in His thinking, before there ever was an angel, star, cherubim, or anything else. That's eternal. And if you have eternal life, you always was. Not your being here, but the shape and form that the infinite God...\n\nAnd if He isn't infinite, He isn't God. God has to be infinite. We are finite; He is infinite. And He was omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. If He isn't, then He can't be God. Knows all things, all places, because of His omnipresence. Omniscient makes Him omnipresent. He is a being; He's not like the wind. He is a being; He dwells in a house. But being omniscient, knowing all things, makes Him omnipresent, because He knows everything that's going on.\n\nThere can't be a flea bat its eyes but what He knowed it. And He knowed it before there was a world, how many times it'd bat its eyes, and how much tallow it had in it, before there ever was a world. That is infinite. We can't comprehend it in our minds, but that's God. God---infinite!\n\n26 And remember, you, your eyes, your stature, whatever you was, you were in His thinking at the beginning. And the only thing that you are is the expression---word. After He thought it, He spoke it, and here you are. If it isn't, if you wasn't in His thinking, there is no way at all for you to ever be there, for He is the one that gives eternal life.\n\nDo you remember how we read the Scriptures? \"Not him that willeth, or him that runneth, but God!\" And that His predestination might stand true, He could choose, before any time, who. God is sovereign in His choosing. Did you know that? God is sovereign. Who was back there to tell Him a better way to make the world? Who would dare to tell Him He was running His business wrong? Even the very word, itself, very sovereign. Even the revelation is sovereign. \"He reveals to whom He will reveal.\" The very revelation, itself, is sovereign in God. That's how people pound at things, and jump at things, and hit at things, not knowing what they're doing. God is sovereign in His works.\n\nRomans 9:16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.\n\n27 Now we find Him at the beginning, His attributes. And, now, you were with Him then. Then is when the book of life comes into view.\n\nNow, we read over here in Revelations the 13th chapter, the 8th verse, that, \"The beast that comes upon the earth [in these last days] will deceive all those people on the earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world.\"\n\nThink of it! Before Jesus was ever born, four thousand years before He came on earth, and several thousand years before you come on earth; Jesus, in God's mind, died for the sins of the world, and the book of life was made, and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world. That's the Bible truth. See, your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world.\n\nYou were there in His attributes. You don't remember it, no, because you're just a part of His life. You are a part of God when you become a son or a daughter of God.\n\nJust as you are a part of your earthly father! That's right. You are. The male carries the hemoglobin, the blood. And when that is gone into egg, then you become a part of your father; and your mother is a part of your father, also; so you're all a part of your father.\n\nGlory! That lets the denomination out, altogether. Certainly does! God, in all, the only place!\n\nRevelation 13:8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.\n\nRevelation 13:14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.\n\n28 Notice now His attribute. Then the attribute was, first, God; the thought, the attribute itself, all in one, without being expressed. Then when He expressed, secondarily, He became then the Word. \"And then the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\"\n\nSaint John the first chapter and the first verse, notice, this is, \"In the beginning.\" But, before---the eternal! Notice, \"In the beginning was the Word.\" When the time begin, it was Word. But before it was Word, it was attribute---a thought. Then it was expressed, \"In the beginning was [the expression] the Word.\"\n\nNow we're getting where Melchisedec is. That's this mysterious person. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God ... And then the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.\" Hold that there now, notice.\n\nHis first being was Spirit, God, supernatural, all right, the great eternal. Second, He begin to form Himself towards flesh, in a theophany it's called, \"the Word; a body.\" This then is the state He was in when He met Abraham, was called Melchisedec. He was in the form of theophany. Now we'll get to that and prove it in a few minutes, the Lord willing. He was the Word.\n\nJohn 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n\nJohn 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.\n\n29 A theophany is something that you could not see. It could be right here now, yet you cannot see it. It's just like, well, like television. That's in another dimension. Television; people are moving right through this room now, singing; there is colors, also. But the eye is only subject to the five senses ... your whole being is only subject to five senses, rather. And you are only subject to what the sight has been limited to see. But there is another dimension that can be seen by a transformation, by television.\n\nNow, television does not manufacture a picture. A television only channels it into a circuit, and then the television screen picks it up. But the picture is there, to begin with. Television was here when Adam was here. Television was here when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel. Television was here when Jesus of Nazareth walked the shores of Galilee. But you're just now discovering it. They wouldn't have believed it back there. You'd have been crazy to have said something like it. But now it's become a reality.\n\nAnd so is it, that Christ is here, the angels of God are here. And someday, in the great millennium to come, it'll be just more real than television or anything else, because they are here.\n\nHe reveals Himself in His great form of what He claimed, as He en morphes Himself into His servants and proves Himself.\n\nNow, here He is in the form of Spirit. And then He comes in the form of en morphe. Now, He appeared to Abraham, en morphe. When Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings, here come Melchisedec, talked to Him.\n\nHebrews 7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;\n\n30 The other day in the Tucson paper, I was reading an article that where there was a woman driving down the road, I believe about forty, fifty miles an hour, and she hit an old man with an overcoat on. She screamed and stopped her car. It threw him up in the air. Right out in the plain desert! And she run back to find him, and he wasn't there. So what did she do? Some people behind her saw it happen, saw the old man fly up in the air, and his overcoat turning. So they run back to find out. They couldn't find the man anywhere. They called the police force. The police come out to examine the place; there was nobody there.\n\nWell, each one of them testified, \"The car chugged, hit the man. He went up in the air, and everybody saw it.\" Witnesses, and two or three carloads of them, they seen it happen. Come to find out, five years ago, there was an old man with an overcoat on, hit and killed on the same spot.\n\nWhen you leave here, you're not dead. You've got to come back, even if you're a sinner, and be judged according to the deeds done in the body. \"If this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, we have one waiting.\" En morphe, that's the word.\n\n2 Corinthians 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\n\n31 Now, God, in this stage of His creation, later formed into flesh, Jesus. From what? From the great beginning, Spirit, then came down to be the Word, bringing itself out. The Word doesn't yet make itself, it's just spoke out, en morphe, later He becomes flesh, Jesus, mortal, to taste death for all of us sinners.\n\nWhen Abraham met Him, He was Melchisedec. He unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end, every son of Abraham. Every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing. But I want to watch how we have to come.\n\nAlso, we see Him revealed here in Ruth and Boaz, as a Kinsman Redeemer, how He had to come to be flesh.\n\n32 Now we see the attribute, sons of His Spirit, have not yet entered into the Word-form body. But, a theophany; this body is subject to the Word and earnest, waiting for the earnest, change of the body.\n\nNow, the difference between Him and you, as a son. See, He was, at the beginning, the Word, an en morphe body. He came in and lived in that, in the person of Melchisedec. Then, later, we never heard no more of Melchisedec, because He became Jesus Christ. Melchisedec was the priest, but He became Jesus Christ. Now, you bypassed that. Because, in that form, He knowed all things, and you have never been able to know that yet.\n\nYou come like Adam, like me, you became from the attribute to the flesh, to be tempted. But when this life is finished here, \"If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting.\" That's where we go; that is the Word. Then we can look back and see what we done. Now we don't understand it. We have never become the Word; we've just become the flesh-man, not the Word.\n\nBut, and look, clearly makes it clear, you will never be the Word unless you was a thought at the beginning. That proves the predestination of God. See? You can't be the Word unless you're a thought. You had to be in the thinking, first.But, you see, in order to stand temptation, you had to bypass the theophany. You had to come down here in flesh, to be tempted by sin. And then, if you stand, \"All the Father hath given me will come to me, and I'll raise him up at the last day.\" See, you had to be first.\n\nJohn 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.\n\nJohn 6:39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.\n\n2 Corinthians 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\n\n33 And then, you see, He come right down, the regular line, from attribute to... Before the foundation of the world, his name is put on the Lamb's book of life. Then, from that, He become the Word, the theophany, that could appear, disappear. And then He become flesh and returned back again, resurrected that same body in a glorified condition.\n\nBut you bypassed the theophany and become flesh-man, to be tempted by sin. And then, \"If this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, we have one already waiting.\" We have not yet the bodies.\n\nBut, look! When this body receives the Spirit of God, the immortal life inside of you, it throws this body in subjection to God. Hallelujah! \"He that's born of God doth not commit sin; he cannot sin.\" Romans 8:1, \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus; they walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" There you are. See, that throws your body subject.\n\nYou don't have to say, \"Oh, if I could just quit drinking! If could just...\" Just get in Christ, and it's all gone, see, because your body is subject to the Spirit. It's no more subject to the things of the world; they're dead. They are dead; your sins are buried in baptism, and you are a new creation in Christ. And your body, becoming subject to the Spirit, try to live a right kind of life.\n\nRomans 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\n\n2 Corinthians 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\n\n1 John 3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.\n\n34 Like you women claiming you got Holy Ghost, and going out here and wearing shorts and things: How could you do it? How could the Spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that? It just can't be so. Certainly, it can't be. He's not a filthy spirit; He's a holy Spirit.\n\nAnd then when you become subject to that Spirit, it throws your whole being subject to that Spirit. And that Spirit is nothing in the world but this seed Word made manifest, or quickened, hallelujah, made alive. And when the Bible said, \"Don't do this,\" that body quickly turns to it. There is no question.\n\nAnd what is it? It's the earnest of the resurrection. This body will be raised up again, because it's already started. It was once subject to sin, and mire and corruption, but now it's got the earnest; it's turned heavenly. Now, that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture. It's the earnest.\n\nA sick person laying, dying, nothing left but death; that's all can happen. I've seen shadows of people, done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis; and see them persons, a little while after that, perfectly normal and strong. If there is no divine healing, then there is no resurrection, because divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection. Amen!\n\nYou know what the earnest money is, don't you? It's the down payment. \"He was wounded for our transgressions; with His stripes we're healed.\" Notice how wonderful! We love Him.\n\nIsaiah 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\n\n35 Now, this body is subject to the Spirit. Have not yet entered into the Word form, but we are still in the flesh form, but subject to the Word. Death in the flesh will take us there.\n\nJust the same thing, think of a little baby. You can take a woman, no matter how evil she is, when she is pregnant and fixing to be mother. Watch, before that baby is born, I don't care how cruel the woman is, she gets real kind. There is something about her seems godly, to see a little mother fixing to become mother, by the baby. Why is it? That little body, now, it's not alive yet, see, the only thing it is, is just flesh and muscles. That little jumping, that's just muscles jerking. But when it comes forth from the womb, God breathes the breath of life into it, and then he screams out. See, just as sure as there is a natural body being formed, there is a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets here.\n\n36 Then, when a man is born again, from heaven, he becomes a spirit babe in Christ.\n\nAnd, then, when this robe of flesh is dropped, there is a natural body, theophany, a body not made with hands, neither born of a woman, that we go to.\n\nThen that body returns back and picks up the glorified body.\n\nThat's the reason Jesus went to hell when He died, and preached to the souls that were in prison; turned back into that theophany. Oh, marvelous! Thank God!\n\nII Corinthians 5:1, \"If this earthly body be dissolved, this earthly tabernacle, we have another one.\" See, we have bypassed that, to come straight from God, the attribute; to be flesh, to be tempted and tested by sin, like Adam did. But when testing of His Word is over, then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world. It is the Word there that we skipped, to come right around, down here to be tempted and tested. If we'd have come through that, there'd have been no temptation; we'd have knowed all things. That's the reason Jesus knowed all things, because He was Word before He was flesh. Then we become the Word.\n\nHere we are formed to the Word image, to be a partaker of the Word, feed on the Word, by being predestinated since the beginning; you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning, when you started your journey. Many of you can remember it. You'd join this church and join that church, and try this and that; nothing satisfied. That's right. But one day you just recognized it. Right.\n\n2 Corinthians 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\n\n1 Peter 3:19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;\n\n37 The other night I was teaching somewhere, I think it was out in California or Arizona, about ... I believe I've told the little story here, about the man setting a hen that had an eagle egg under it. And when that eagle hatched out, he was the funniest looking bird them chickens ever seen. But, he walked around. He was the ugly one among them, because he just couldn't understand how that hen will cluck and scratch on that manure pile and eat. He couldn't get the idea. She'd say, \"Come on over and feast, honey!\" Well, he was an eagle; he just didn't eat like that. It wasn't his food.\n\nSo she would catch grasshoppers and whatmore, you know, and call the little chickens. And all them little chickens would go along, cluck along, and eat. But the little eagle just couldn't do it. It didn't look right to him.\n\nSo one day his mammy come hunting him.\n\n38 And he'd hear that hen cluck. He would try his best to cluck, but he couldn't do it. He tried to cheep like a chicken, but he couldn't do it. See, he was an eagle. To start with, he was an eagle. He was just hatched under a hen.\n\nThat's like some church members. That's about the way it is; about one out of a setting, is right. But one day his mammy flew over, and she screamed. He recognized it. That sounded right. Why? He was an eagle, to begin with.\n\nThat's the way it is with the gospel, the Word, the power of Jesus Christ. When a man has been predestinated to eternal life, he hears that true ring, scream of God, nothing can keep him from it.\n\nThe church might say, \"Days of miracles is past, cluck, cluck, cluck. Stand here and eat this, and stand here and eat that.\"\n\nThat barnyard stuff won't do for him, anymore. He is gone! \"All things are possible!\" He gets off the ground.\n\nThat's what's the matter with so many Christians today, they can't get their feet off the ground.\n\nThe old mammy said, \"Son, jump! You're an eagle. Come up here where I am.\n\nHe said, \"Mom, I never jumped, in my life.\"\n\nShe said, \"Well, you jump! You're a eagle, to begin with. You're not a chicken.\" So he made his first jump and flopped his wings; didn't do too good, but he got off the ground.\n\nThat's the way we do. We accept God by faith, by the written Word. There is something in there; it's that eternal life. You were predestinated to it.\n\nHis grandpa and grandma were eagles. He was a eagle, all the way back. Eagle don't mix with other things. He's not a hybrid at all, He's a eagle.\n\n39 Then, after he recognized the very Word of God was eagle food, then you left the other thing. You have then been formed into the living image of the living God. You heard from your theophany. \"If this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting.\"\n\nYou say, \"Is that right, Brother Branham?\"\n\nAll right, let's take a couple of eagles and look at them for a few minutes. There was a man named Moses. Everyone knows that a prophet is called the eagle, in the Bible. There was a prophet named Moses. And one day God called him, and wouldn't let him go over the land, and he died on a rock. The angels took him away and buried him.There was another man, a eagle, didn't even have to die. He just walked across Jordan, God sent a chariot down; and this robe of flesh he dropped, and rise and caught the everlasting prize.\n\nEight hundred years later, eight hundred years later, on Mount Transfiguration, here stood those two men. Moses' body had been rotten for hundreds of years, but here he was in such a form till even Peter, James and John recognized him. Amen! \"If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved [if you're an attribute of God expressed here on earth], you've got a body waiting after you leave this world.\" There they was, standing on Mount Transfiguration, in their theophany. For, they were prophets to whom the Word came to.\n\nDeuteronomy 34:4 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.\n\nDeuteronomy 34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.\n\nDeuteronomy 34:6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\n\n2 Kings 2:11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\n\n2 Corinthians 5:1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\n\n40 Also let us notice another prophet, one time, by the name of Samuel. He was a great man. He had taught Israel; told them they shouldn't have a king. He said, \"Have I ever said one thing to you in the name of the Lord but what come to pass?\"\n\nThey said, \"No. Everything you've always said in the name of the Lord come to pass.\"\n\nHe was a prophet, and he died.\n\nAbout three or four years later, the king got in trouble; that was before the blood of Jesus Christ was ever shed. He was in paradise. And a witch of Endor called for somebody to come, and console Saul. And when the witch saw him standing up, she said, \"I see god raising up out of the earth.\"\n\n1 Samuel 12:3 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.\n\n1 Samuel 12:4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.\n\n1 Samuel 28:13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.\n\n41 And after the man had been dead, buried, and rotted in the grave, here he was standing there in that cave, with his prophet's robes on; and was still a prophet, amen, for he said, \"Why did you call me out of my rest, seeing you become a enemy to God?\" Watch him prophesy. \"Tomorrow night, by this time, you will be with me.\" He was still a prophet, though he was gone from this body.\n\nSee, he had become here and was part of that Word, and he entered from the flesh life back into the body that had been prepared for him before the foundation of the world. He entered into the theophany, which was the Word. You get it? That's where all believers go when we turn from here.\n\nThen, in that form, the veil then is lifted. You see, you are the Word, also, when you enter into there. As a little baby; as I said a while ago...\n\nNow notice. Praise God for these opening seals, is my prayer, to know these things!\n\n1 Samuel 28:14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.\n\n1 Samuel 28:15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.\n\n42 Now the true revelation of Melchisedec comes into view. He was God, the Word, before He became flesh; God, the Word. Because, He had to be; no one else could be immortal like Him. See, I had father and mother; you did, too. Jesus had father and mother. But this man had no father, or had no mother. Jesus had a time He started; this man didn't. Jesus gave His life; this man couldn't, because He was life. And it's the self-same man all the time. I hope God reveals it to you. The self-same person, all the time.\n\nNotice His title, \"King of righteousness.\" Now, Hebrews 7:2, \"King of righteousness, and King of peace.\" He is two kings. Now watch, Hebrews 7:2, \"King of righteousness, also the King of peace.\" He is two kings there. Now since He has come in the flesh and received His body up, in Revelations 21:16, He is called, \"The King of kings.\" He is all three of them, together. See, King God, King theophany, King Jesus. He is the King of kings.\n\nIt's all met, just like soul, body, and spirit, all comes to make one.\n\nAlso, He is the Father, which was the first; Son; and Holy Ghost, the Spirit. King of righteousness, the Spirit attribute---theophany; King of peace, theophany; and in flesh He was King of kings, same person.\n\nHebrews 7:2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;\n\nRevelation 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.\n\n43 When the theophany, Moses seen Him, Exodus 33:2, He was a theophany. Moses wanted to see God. He had heard His voice, heard Him talk to him, seen Him in a bush there, as a big pillar of fire. And he said, \"Who are you? I want to know who you are?\" Moses said. \"If You'll let me see You, I would like to see Your face.\"\n\nHe said, \"No man can see my face.\" He said, \"I'll put my hand over your eyes, and I'll pass by. And you can see my back, but not my face,\" see. And when He did, it was the back of a man; it was theophany. Then the Word that come to Moses, \"I AM,\" that was the Word. The Word came to Moses in the form of a pillar of fire in a burning bush, the \"I AM.\"\n\nAs the Word from the theology ... from the theophany, rather. Excuse me. He came to Abraham as a man, under the oak tree. Now look at there. There came a man to Abraham, three of them, and sat down under an oak tree, three of them. And notice, after He talked to Abraham...\n\nExodus 33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.\n\nExodus 33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.\n\n44 Why did He come? Abraham, being the one with the promise and the message of the coming son, and also He was God's Word-prophet that was trusting God's Word, calling anything contrary as though it wasn't. See how perfect the Word is? The Word came to the prophet. See, there was God in a theophany. And the Bible said, \"The Word comes to the prophet.\" And here was the Word in the theophany.\n\nNow you say, \"Was that God?\" Abraham said it was. He said His name was... He called Him Elohim. Now in Genesis 1, you find out, \"In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and earth.\" In Genesis 18, we find out that Abraham called this person, that sat there and talked to him, and could tell him the secrets of his heart, tell him what Sarah was thinking behind Him, Abraham said, \"It is Elohim.\" He was in a theophany form. You get it? Notice after...\n\nGenesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\n\nGenesis 18:3 And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:\n\nGenesis 18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n\n45 Now we find out that He was then in the theophany form. He called Him, \"Lord God, Elohim.\" Now, in Genesis 18, we find that that is true.\n\nNow notice Abraham. There was three of them together, but when Abraham met the three, he said, \"My Lord.\"\n\nBut when Lot, down in Sodom; two of them went down there, and Lot saw two of them coming, and he said, \"My lords.\" See, what was the matter? The first place, Lot was not a prophet, that's right, or neither was he the messenger of the hour, so he didn't have any revelation of Him. It's exactly right. Lot could call them lords. A dozen of them, he could still said lords.\n\nBut no matter how many Abraham saw, it was still one Lord. There is God. This was the Melchisedec.\n\nNotice, after the battle was over, Melchisedec served His victorious child communion; think of that, part of Himself! Now we want to see here. In type here is, in view, the communion. After the battle, He gave of Himself, because the communion is part of Christ. And after the struggle is over, after you've done got yourself whipped out, then is when you partake of Christ, become part of this being. You get it?\n\nGenesis 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.\n\nGenesis 18:3 And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:\n\nGenesis 19:2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n\n46 Jacob wrestled all night, and wouldn't turn Him loose until He blessed him. That's right. Battled for life! And after the battle is over, then God gives you of Himself. That is the true communion. The little bread and wafer just represents it. You shouldn't take it 'less you've wrestled it out and become part of God.\n\nRemember, at this time, the communion had never been instituted, not until before the death of Jesus Christ, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later.\n\nBut Melchisedec, after His child Abraham had won the victory, Melchisedec met him and gave him wine and bread; showing that after this earthly battle is over, we will meet Him in the heavens and take the communion again. It'll be the wedding supper. \"I will not drink no more of the vine, or eat the fruit, until I eat and drink it with you, anew, in my Father's kingdom.\" Is that right?\n\nGenesis 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.\n\nGenesis 32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.\n\nMatthew 26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.\n\nMark 14:25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\n\nLuke 22:18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.\n\n47 Notice again, Melchisedec went to meet Abraham before He got back home. What a beautiful type here we have! Melchisedec meeting Abraham before he got back home, after the battle.\n\nWe meet Jesus in the air, before we get home. That's right. II Thessalonians tells us that, for we meet Him in the air. A beautiful type of Rebekah meeting Isaac, in the field, in the cool of the day. We meet Him in the air. II Thessalonians tells us so. \"For we which are alive and remain shall not prevent [or hinder] those which are asleep; for the trumpet of God shall sound; the dead in Christ shall rise first; we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them, to meet the Lord in the air.\" Perfect, all these types.\n\nTherefore, the theophany, if you have died and entered into that theophany, (what happens?) the theophany comes to the earth to pick up the redeemed body. And if you're here in the air, you take the body to meet the theophany, there you are, \"...and caught up, and go to meet the Lord in the air.\"\n\nWho is this Melchisedec but God!\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\n\nHebrews 7:1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;\n\n48 Now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in journey, and death, and where we go after we die. Also, predestination is in plain view here. Now listen as we teach this, closely.\n\nThe stages of the eternal purpose He had in His secret has now been revealed. Notice, there is still three stages to perfection. Just like He redeems the world; same way He redeems His church. He redeems the people in three stages. Now look. First is justification, like Luther preached; second, sanctification, like Wesley preached; third, Baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's right. Then comes the rapture!\n\nNow, the world, how did He redeem the world? The first, what He did, when it sinned, He washed it off in water baptism. That's right. Then He dropped His blood upon it, from the cross, and sanctified it and called it His own. And then what does He do? As He tore all the world out of you, and renovated the whole thing by the fiery baptism of the Holy Ghost, He also will renovate the world. And it'll be burnt over with fire, and cleanse every germ, for millions of miles high, everything will be cleaned off. And then there is a new heaven and a new earth, just like you are a new creature in Christ Jesus when the Holy Spirit takes ahold of you. See, there you are, the whole thing is just as plain as it can be. Everything is in three.\n\n49 The natural birth is in three. What's the first thing happens to the woman having a baby? What breaks first? Water. What breaks next? Blood. What's the next process? Life. Water, blood, spirit.\n\nWhat happens to the plant? Rots. What's the first thing? Stalk. What's the next? Tassel. What's the next? Shuck. Then the grain comes out of that. Just the three stages of it, till it gets to the grain. That's exactly.\n\nGod vindicates... That's always been right. God vindicates it to be true. Show plainly, the predestinated is the only one that's considered in redemption. Did you get it? Let me say that again. The predestinated is the only one that's considered in redemption. People might be making like, think they are, but the real redemption is those that are predestinated. Because, the very word redeem means \"to bring back.\" Is that right? The redeem is something ... To redeem anything is, \"bring it back to its original place.\" Hallelujah! So it's only the predestinated will be brought back, because the others didn't come from there. See, \"bring back!\"\n\n50 Being eternal with Him, at the beginning... The eternal life that you had, His thought of what you was, only, He wanted you to... He wanted me to stand in the pulpit, say. He wanted you to sit in the seat tonight. Then we are serving His eternal purpose. And the one that left home, only come to the earth to serve His purpose. Is that right? All right. Then, after it's finished, it's brought back in a glorified state; it's matured and brought back again.\n\nNo wonder Paul could say, when they was building a block to chop his head off; he said, \"O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory? But thanks be to God who gives us the victory!\" He said, \"Death, tell me where you can make me holler! Grave, tell me how're you going to hold me! For I am a possessor of eternal life.\" Amen! He recognized it. Death, hell, grave, nothing could hold him. And nothing can hurt us, got eternal life! He realized he was blessed with eternal life.\n\n1 Corinthians 15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\n\n51 Just like a little dewdrop. If I understand, it's... I don't know too much about chemistry. But, it must be that it's the congealing of humidity or atmosphere. And when the night gets cold and dark, it falls from the heavens and drops upon the ground. It's fell from somewhere. But the next morning before the sun comes up, it's laying there, the little fellow's, shivering. But just let the sun come up, watch it go to shining. It's happy. Why? The sun is going to call it right back to where it come from.\n\nAnd that's the way with a Christian. Hallelujah! We know when we walk into the presence of God, something in us tells us that we come from somewhere, and we're going back again by that power that's a pulling us.\n\nThe little dewdrop, he glistens and shines and shouts, because he knows he come from up there, and that sun is going to draw him right back up again.\n\nAnd a man that's an attribute of God, born of God, knows (Hallelujah!), when he come in contact with the Son of God, he is going to be drawed up from here some day. \"For if I be lifted up from the earth, I'll draw all men unto me.\" Amen!\n\nJohn 12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\n\n52 Now notice, now, we see Melchisedec and why that Mary wasn't his mother. That's the reason He called her \"woman,\" not mother. He had no father, for He was the Father, the everlasting Father, the three in the one. He had no mother, certainly not. He had no father, for He was the Father. As the poet said one time, speaking a great compliment unto Jesus, he said:\n\nI AM that spoke to Moses in a burning bush of fire,\n\nI AM the God of Abraham, the bright and morning star,\n\nI AM Alpha, Omega, the beginning from the end.\n\nI AM the whole creation, and Jesus is the name.\n\n(That's right.)\n\nOh, who do you say that I am, and whence do they\n\nsay that I came,\n\nDo you know My Father, or can you tell His name?\n\n(Hallelujah!)\n\nThat's the Father's name! \"I come in My Father's name, and you received me not.\" Sure, He's the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n\nJohn 2:4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.\n\nJohn 5:43 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.\n\nJohn 19:26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!\n\nHebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n\n53 And this Melchisedec became flesh. He revealed Himself as Son of man when He come, as a prophet. He come in three names of a son; the Son of man, the Son of God, the Son of David.\n\nWhen He was here on earth, He was a man, to fulfill the Scripture. Moses said, \"The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet liken unto me.\" So He had to come as a prophet. He didn't never say, \"I am the Son of God.\" He said, \"I am the Son of man. Do you believe the Son of man?\" Because, that's what He had to testify of, because that's what He was.\n\nNow He's come in another son's name, Son of God; the unseen, the Spirit.\n\nAnd when He comes again, He is Son of David, to sit upon His throne.\n\nDeuteronomy 18:15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;\n\nMatthew 16:13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\n\n54 Now when He was here and was made flesh, He was called the Son of man. Now, how did He make Himself known to the world as Son of man, the Prophet?\n\nOne day I was telling a story of Peter and Andrew, his brother. They were fishermen, and their father Jonas was a great old believer. One day they said he sat down on the side of the boat. He said, \"Sons, you know how we've prayed when we needed fish.\" They was commercial fishermen. He said, \"We've trusted God, Jehovah, for our living. I'm getting old now; I can't stay with you boys much longer. And I've always, as all true believers, have looked for the time when that Messiah will come. We've had all kinds of false ones, but there is coming a real one someday.\" And he said, \"When this Messiah comes, I don't want you boys to be deceived. This Messiah will not be just a theologian. He will be a prophet, for our prophet Moses, of who we follow, he said...\"\n\nNow, any Jew will believe his prophet. He is taught to know that. And if the prophet says anything it's so, then that's truth. But God said, \"If there be one among you, spiritual, or a prophet, I the Lord will make myself known to him. And what he says comes to pass, then hear him and fear him; but if it don't, then don't fear him at all.\" See? So that was the vindication of the prophet.\n\nNumbers 12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.\n\nDeuteronomy 18:22 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.\n\nJeremiah 28:9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.\n\n55 \"So Moses was truly a vindicated prophet, and he said, 'The Lord your God shall raise up, among you out of your brethren, a Prophet like unto me. And all that won't hear him will be cut off from the people.'\" He said, \"Now children, remember that, as Hebrews, we believe God's vindicated prophets.\" Now listen close. Don't miss it. And he said, \"When the Messiah comes, you will know Him, for He will be a Prophet-Messiah. Now,\" he said, \"it's been four hundred years, we haven't had a prophet since Malachi, but He'll be!\"\n\nOne day, after his death, a few years, his son Andrew was strolling along down the bank. And he heard a wild man out of the wilderness, saying, \"That Messiah is standing among you now!\" That big eagle that raised up over in the wilderness and flew over there, said, \"The Messiah is among you right now. We don't know Him yet, but He is standing among you. I'll know Him, because I'll see a sign coming from heaven.\"\n\nOne day He said, \"There, behold, is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!\"\n\nAway went this man, to find his brother. He said, \"Simon, I want you to come over here; we've done found the Messiah.\"\n\n\"Oh, go on, Andrew! You know better than that!\"\n\n\"Oh, I know. But this man is different.\"\n\n\"Where is He? Where'd He come from?\"\n\n\"Jesus of Nazareth.\"\n\n\"That little, wicked city? Why, He couldn't come from a wicked, dirty place like that.\"\n\n\"You just come and see.\"\n\nFinally persuaded him to come down one day. So when he come in the front of this Messiah, Jesus standing there, speaking to the people. When he walked up in front of Him, He said, \"Your name is Simon, and you are the son of Jonas.\" That did it. He got the keys to the kingdom. Why? He knowed that that man did not know him. And how did He know him, and that godly old father who had taught him how to believe the Messiah?\n\nDeuteronomy 18:15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;\n\nDeuteronomy 18:19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.\n\nJohn 1:26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;\n\nJohn 1:29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\n\nJohn 1:41 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.\n\nJohn 1:42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.\n\nJohn 1:46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.\n\n56 There was a man standing there, by the name of Philip. Oh, he got real excited! He knowed another man, he'd been studying the Bible with. Away he went, around the hill, and he found him out there in his olive grove. He was kneeling down, praying. They'd had lots of Bible lessons together, so he come out there. And he said, after he'd got through praying, he said, \"Come, see who we've found; Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. He's the Messiah we're looking for.\"\n\nNow I can hear Nathanael say, \"Now, Philip, you ain't went off on the deep end, are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Nope. Now let me tell you. You know, we've been studying the Bible together, and what did the prophet say the Messiah would be?\"\n\n\"He would be a prophet.\"\n\n\"You remember that old fisherman you bought the fish from, that didn't have enough education to sign his name, called Simon?\"\n\n\"Yep, uh-huh!\"\n\n\"He come up. And you know what? This Jesus of Nazareth told him that his name was Simon, changed his name to Peter, which is 'little stone,' and told him who his daddy was.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I don't know. Could anything good come out of Nazareth?\"\n\nHe said, \"Let's not talk about it; just come on and see.\" That's a good idea, \"Come and see.\"\n\nSo here come Philip, bringing up Nathanael. And when he got walking up, Jesus probably standing speaking, probably praying for the sick in the prayer line. And when He come up to where Jesus was, Jesus looked around at him, and said, \"Behold an Israelite in whom there is not guile.\"\n\nJohn 1:45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\n\nJohn 1:46 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.\n\nJohn 1:47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\n\n57 Now, you say, \"Well, it was the way He was dressed.\" Oh, no. All Easterners dressed the same. He could have been a Syrian, or been anything else; beard, garment.\n\nHe said, \"Behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile [in otherwise, a honest, sincere man.]\"\n\nWell, that kind of deflated Nathanael. And he said, \"Rabbi [which means \"teacher\"], Rabbi, when did you ever know me? How did you know I was a Jew? How did you know I was honest, no guile?\"\n\nHe said, \"Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you.\" Mmm! Fifteen miles away, the other side of the country, the day before.\n\nWhat did he say, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel!\"\n\nJohn 1:47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\n\nJohn 1:48 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.\n\nJohn 1:49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.\n\n58 But there stood those priests there, self-styled, self-starched, said, \"This man is Beelzebub, a fortune-teller.\"\n\nJesus said, \"I'll forgive you for that.\"\n\nNow, remember, they never said it out loud, but they said it in their hearts. \"And He perceived their thoughts.\" That's right. That's what the Bible says. Call it telepathy if you want to, but he perceived their thoughts.\n\nAnd He said, \"I forgive you for that. But someday the Holy Ghost is going to come and do the same thing [after His going]; speak a word against it, it will never be forgiven in this world or the world to come.\" Is that right? Now, that was Jews.\n\nThen one day He had need to go to Samaria. But just before we do that, we found the woman, or,\n\nMatthew 9:6 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.\n\nMatthew 12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.\n\nMatthew 12:31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.\n\nMatthew 12:32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.\n\nMark 2:11 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.\n\nMark 3:22 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.\n\nLuke 5:22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?\n\nLuke 9:47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,\n\nLuke 11:15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.\n\nLuke 12:10 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.\n\nJohn 5:8 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\n\n59 the man, as he went through the gate called Beautiful, that he was healed. And Jesus knowed his condition, and told him, \"Take up your bed and go on home.\" And he did it, and got well.\n\nThen we find out, the Jews, some of them received Him. Some believed it; some didn't. Why didn't they believe it? They was not ordained to life. They wasn't part of that attribute.\n\nNow remember, them were priests and great men. And Jesus... Think of those theologians and priests, men that you couldn't find a flaw in their life. Jesus said, \"You are of your father the devil, and his works you do.\" Said, \"If you'd be of God, you'd believe me. If you can't believe me, believe the works that I do; they testify who I am.\"\n\nNow, the Bible said that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Jesus said, \"The works that I do, shall he that believeth on me, do also.\" Is that right? Notice, that was the real Melchisedec now.\n\nJohn 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\n\nJohn 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\n\nHebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n\n60 Now notice, again, there was only three races of people. You've heard me say I was a segregationalist. I am. All Christians are segregationalists; not segregation of color, but segregation of spirit. A man's color of his skin has nothing to do with him. He is a child of God by birth. But a Christian, God said, \"Separate me!\" \"Come out from among them,\" and so forth. He is a segregationist, of filth, between right and wrong.\n\nBut notice, they had a segregation then, a racial segregation, which was the Samaritans. And there is only three races of people on the earth; if we believe the Bible; that is, Ham, Shem, and Japheth's people. That's the three sons of Noah. We all sprung from there. That's right. That makes us all back from Adam, which makes us all brothers. The Bible said, \"Of one blood God created all nations.\" We're all brothers, through the blood stream. A colored man can give a white man a blood transfusion, or vice versa. The white man can give the Japanese, yellow man, or the Indian, the red man, or whatmore, or a Japhenite, or whatever, he could give him a blood transfusion, because we're all the same blood. The color of our skin, where we lived, had nothing to do with it.\n\nBut when we're segregated, is when we come out of the world, like He brought Israel up out of Egypt. That's when we're segregated from the things of the world.\n\nActs 17:26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;\n\n61 Now, they was Ham, Shem, and Japheth's people. And if we had time to run the genealogies back, you could see the Anglo-Saxon, where he come from. Now, that was the Jew. The Samaritan, which was half Jew and Gentile, that married in with the Gentiles at Balaam's doings, and Moab. They were Samaritans. And there was Jews and Gentiles.\n\nNow, we Anglo-Saxon had nothing to do with any of it. We didn't believe any Messiah, nor nothing else. We wasn't looking for one. We were brought in afterwards.\n\nJesus came to His own, and His own received Him not. And He said, to His disciples, \"Don't go in the way of the Gentiles, but go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.\" And He went only to the lost sheep of Israel. And watch, He manifested Hisself as Son of man, before the Jews. They turned it down.\n\nNow, the Samaritan, being half Jew and Gentile, they believed also, and was looking for a Messiah.\n\nWe wasn't. We were heathens, with clubs on our back, worshipping idols; the Gentile.\n\nMatthew 10:5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:\n\nMatthew 10:6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\n\nJohn 1:11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\n\n62 But now one day, St. John 4, He had need to go by Samaria, on His road down to Jericho. But went up around Samaria. And while He was going up there, He sat down on the well outside of a city called Sychar. And the well, if you've ever been there, it's a little panoramic about like this here. And there's a public spring there, of water, where they all come. And the women come of a morning, get their pots of water, and put it on their head, and one on each hip, and walk with it just as straight as can be, never spill a drop; talk to one another. So, the people would come out there.\n\nSo this was about eleven o'clock in the day. So He sent His disciples into the city to buy some victuals, food. And while they were gone...\n\nJohn 4:4 And he must needs go through Samaria.\n\nJohn 4:5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.\n\nJohn 4:8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)\n\n63 There was a woman which was ill-famed. We would call her, today, a red-light woman, or prostitute. She had too many husbands. So while Jesus was sitting there, this woman come out about eleven o'clock. See, she couldn't come with the virgins when they come in the morning to get their wash water; she had to wait till they all... They didn't mix like they do now. She was marked. So then, she come out to get some water, so she just took the old windle, and put the hooks over the jar, and started to let it down.\n\nShe heard somebody say, \"Woman, bring me a drink.\" Now, remember, this is Melchisedec. This is Jesus, yesterday, the Son of man.\n\nAnd she looked around, and she saw a Jew. So she said, \"Sir, it's not proper for a Jew to ask a Samaritan for anything. I'm a woman of Samaria, so you have spoken out of your place. You shouldn't have asked me such a thing as that. We have no dealings with one another.\"\n\nHe said, \"But if you knew who was talking to you, you would ask me for a drink.\"\n\nShe said, \"How are you going to draw it? The well is deep, and you have nothing to draw with.\"\n\nHe said, \"The water that I give is water of life, springing up into eternal life.\"\n\nHe talked to her till He found what her condition was. And then, watch what He said to her now, \"Go get your husband and come here.\"\n\nAnd she said, \"I have no husband.\"\n\nHe said, \"You have said the truth, for you've had five, and the one you now are living with is not yours. So, in this, you've said the truth.\"\n\nWatch the difference between that woman and that bunch of priests. She knowed more about God than that whole bunch of priests did put together.\n\nJohn 4:7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.\n\nJohn 4:9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.\n\nJohn 4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.\n\nJohn 4:11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?\n\nJohn 4:14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\n\nJohn 4:16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.\n\nJohn 4:17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:\n\nJohn 4:18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.\n\n64 She said, \"Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.\" She said, \"We haven't had one for four hundred years. Now, we know that the Messiah is coming. And when the Messiah comes, that's what He is going to do.\" That was the sign of the Messiah, for He was the Son of man. Said, \"That's what He is going to do when He comes. You must be His prophet.\"\n\nHe said, \"I am He.\" Nobody else could say that.\n\nShe dropped that waterpot and run into the city, and said, \"Come, see a man who told me what I done. Isn't this the very Messiah?\"\n\nNow remember, He promised to do that same thing at the end of the Gentile race.\n\nThe Jews had had four thousand years to look for that Messiah, four thousand years of teaching He was coming, and what He would do when He got there, and they failed to see Him---failed to recognize it. And when He made Hisself known in the very Bible terms that He said He would, when He had been a theophany and then become flesh and dwelt among them, they failed to see it, and called His works the works of the devil.\n\nJohn 4:19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.\n\nJohn 4:25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.\n\nJohn 4:26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.\n\nJohn 4:28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,\n\nJohn 4:29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?\n\n65 Now we've had two thousand years of teaching, coming down through the Roman Catholic church, after the apostles. Then we come down through the Roman Catholic, the Greek, and so forth, on down to Luther's age, and Wesley, whatmore, nine hundred different organizations coming down. They had all these ages' teaching.\n\nNow He promised, just before the end-time would come, that the picture of Sodom and Gomorrah would again ... \"As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the end-time, the Son of man will reveal Himself again.\" [Break in tape.]\n\n\"Yet a little while and the world won't see me no more; yet ye shall see me, for I [a personal pronoun], I will be with you, even in you, to the consummation, the end of the world. I'll be with you.\" He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. You see?\n\nYou see, the Samaritan was actually, from my last night's sermon, was Hagar, see, a perverted type. The Jew was Sarah, or was Sarah-ite. But the Gentile is of Mary, the royal seed, Abraham's royal seed.\n\nMatthew 28:20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.\n\nLuke 17:28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;\n\nLuke 17:30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.\n\nJohn 14:19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.\n\nHebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n\n66 Now it's promised that in these last days, that this same God, this same Christ, would come back here and reveal Hisself as Son of man.\n\nWhy? He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And if He'd let those Jews go by, and give them that Messiahic sign, and then come to the end of the Gentile's teaching and let them just go in on theology, He would be unjust. He has got to do the same thing, because the Bible said, in Hebrews 13:8, He is the same.\n\nAnd He has promised in Malachi 4, and all the different Scriptures, that the last days, the church would be sitting just exactly like it is today, and the world would be.\n\nLook at the world today. Look at the Sodom condition. Look at the earthquakes in divers places, and the things that's taking place. Look at the church and the mess it's in, of Babylon. Look at the messenger to it, an Oral Roberts and a Billy Graham.\n\nG-r-a-h-a-m, first time we ever had a messenger, to all the churches, that his name ever ended in h-a-m, like Abraham. A-b-r-a-h-a-m is seven letters. G-r-a-h-a-m is six letters. Where is he at? To the world. Six is man's number. Man was created on the sixth day. But seven is God's number.\n\nHebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n\n67 Now look at them down there in Sodom. And there is their messengers down there speaking to them. But then where is that royal seed of Abraham? Where is their sign, that He said? \"As it was in the days of Sodom,\" that God came down and was manifested in human flesh, and told what Sarah was thinking back in her heart, in the tent behind Him, the last sign before the Gentile world was destroyed by fire. And the church has got its last sign before the whole world is going to be destroyed, this Gentile kingdom be destroyed by the fire and wrath of God. Do you believe that?\n\nThat Melchisedec was flesh, represented Himself in a human body; and then later He was made flesh. And now, tonight, He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. Do you believe it?\n\nWho is this Melchisedec, then, that's the same yesterday... \"Never had no father, never had no mother; he never had no beginning of days, he never had any end of life.\" And He met Abraham, and what kind of a sign did He perform? Then when He was made flesh, He said it would repeat again just before the end time. Do you believe that? I believe it.\n\nLet's pray.\n\nGenesis 18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\n\nLuke 17:28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;\n\nHebrews 7:3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.\n\nHebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n\n68 Dear God, I believe the Scriptures, that You have said You was the same yesterday, today, and forever. And as sincerely in my heart, Lord, I know that something is fixing to take place. I cannot strictly identify it. I'm afraid to say anything, Lord. Thou knowest the heart of Your servants.\n\nAnd how many times, down through the age when You sent things, people failed to get it. Man is constantly praising God for what He did, and saying what great things He is going to do, but ignoring what He's doing. So has it been through the age. Why did the Roman church fail to see St. Patrick as God's prophet? Why did they kill Joan of Arc when she was a prophetess, burnt her as a witch? Father, it's always past. You hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent. No wonder You said to them priests, \"You garnish the tombs of the prophets, and you're the one that put them in there.\" After they're gone, they see their mistake. They always persecute You, Lord, in whatever form You come in.\n\nMatthew 11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\n\nMatthew 23:29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,\n\nLuke 10:21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.\n\nHebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.\n\n69 I pray, tonight, God, just one more time. Tomorrow we're scheduled to go to Tucson. Other parts of the world, other cities we must preach in. But, dear God, there might be strangers here tonight that never has, they've heard words preached, but never seen it made manifest.\n\nAs I asked You at the beginning. When those disciples, Cleopas and his friend, coming from Emmaus, was walking along the road, and You stepped out of the bush and begin to talk to them, after the resurrection, preached to them. Why, He said, \"Fools, slow of heart. Don't you know that Christ should suffer these things, then enter into His glory?\" But still they never recognized it. All day long they walked with You, and still didn't know You. But one night...\n\nNight come, they constrained You to come in. When they went into the little inn and closed the doors, then You did something just the way You did it before Your crucifixion, and they recognized that it was the risen Christ. In a few moments You was behind the curtains and gone. Quickly they run and told the disciples, \"The Lord is risen indeed!\"\n\nFather, God, I believe that You're still alive. I know You are. And You've proved it to us so many times. Could You just do it once more for us, Lord? If we've found grace in Your sight, let it happen once more. I am Your servant; these are Your servants in here. Lord, all that I've said wouldn't amount to... Just one word from You would be more than I've said in these five nights, or five messages. It would be more, just one word from You. Won't You speak, Lord, that the people might know that I've told them the truth? Grant it, God. I ask it in Jesus' name, this once more. Amen.\n\nLuke 24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.\n\nLuke 24:29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.\n\nLuke 24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.\n\nLuke 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.\n\nLuke 24:34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.\n\n70 Now, I don't know you. I know some people. I know this boy sitting here. I know Bill Dauch sitting right there. I want to... Here's Brother Blair, Rodney Cox. It's hard to see out there. On this side, right at the present time I can't see nobody, actually, that I know.\n\nNow how many in here that knows that I am a stranger to you? Raise up your hands, knows that I know nothing about you, raise up your hands on both sides.\n\nHow many in here that has something wrong, or something that you know that I know nothing about? Would you raise up your hands.\n\nNow, it would be totally, absolutely, totally impossible for me to know anything about you. Otherwise, then, it'd have to come from some revelation of Spirit.\n\nAnd being that I've told you all these nights, and tonight, that He is not dead; He is here, and promised to do the same thing. And promised that there would come a time in the last days, according to Malachi 4 and according to St. Luke, that He would appear again in human form among His people and do the same things, and reveal the same thing, the same Messiahic sign. How many knows that, you Bible readers, knows that's the truth? Say, \"Amen.\" [Congregation says, \"Amen.\"] Must all be Bible readers.\n\nNow, I know it's foreign to the people today, but still it's the truth. That's the reason they didn't know Jesus of Nazareth. They knowed their church creeds, but they didn't know Him. But He come just the way the Bible said; not a theologian, not a priest. He come as a prophet, and His own received Him not.\n\nJohn 1:11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\n\n71 Now, if God will keep His Word, and if I happen to ... it happens to fall on someone that I know, then I'll get someone else. See, I want somebody that I don't know. And I want you to pray.\n\nNow, look, there was a little woman one time had an infirmity. She had spent her money for the doctors; they could do her no good. And she said within her heart, \"If I can touch that man's garments, I'll be made well.\" You remember the story? And so all of them tried to get her to stay back, but she pressed through until she touched His garment, went back and sat down.\n\nNow listen close. And then when He did that, when she did that, Jesus turned around and said, \"Who touched me?\"\n\nWhy, Peter the apostle rebuked Him. He might have said something like, \"Lord, don't say a thing like that. The people will believe there is something wrong with You. Because, when You asked them to eat your flesh and drink your blood, they already think there is something wrong. And You say, 'Who touched me?' Why, the whole crowd is a-touching you.\"\n\nHe said, \"Yes, but I perceive that virtue went out of me.\" That was a different kind of touch. And anybody knows that virtue is \"strength.\" \"I got weak; virtue left me.\"\n\nAnd he looked around on the audience until He found the little woman, and told her about her blood issue. And she felt in her body that that blood issue had stopped. Is that right? And He said, \"Thy faith has saved thee.\"\n\nNow, the Greek word there is sozo, which absolutely means \"saved,\" physically or spiritual, just the same. He's her Saviour.\n\nMatthew 9:20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:\n\nMatthew 9:21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.\n\nMatthew 9:22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.\n\nMark 5:27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.\n\nMark 5:28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.\n\nMark 5:30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?\n\nMark 5:31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?\n\nMark 5:34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.\n\nLuke 8:43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,\n\nLuke 8:44 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.\n\nLuke 8:45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?\n\nLuke 8:46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\n\nLuke 8:48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.\n\n72 Now, if that was Him yesterday, and the way He acted, to prove that He was among the people, the Messiah promised; and that's the way He identified Himself, and promised by the Bible, He would do the same thing now; wouldn't He have to do the same thing?\n\nYou say, \"Did He say about healing the sick?\" Yeah! The Hebrews, the Bible that I just read from, said that Jesus Christ now is our high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. How many knows that's true? The Bible said that. \"He's a high priest now that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities.\" Then if He's the same high priest that He was then, how would He act now? He would have to act the same way He did then, if He's the same high priest. Now, you might...\n\nI'm not your high priest. You might touch me, and it'd be just like touching your husband, or your brother, or whatmore, a man.\n\nHebrews 4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\n\n73 But you let your faith touch Him, and watch what happens.\n\nNow, if I be God's servant a"
