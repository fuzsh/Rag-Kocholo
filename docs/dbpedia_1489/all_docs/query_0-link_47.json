        "text": "Originally recorded by The Strangeloves in 1965, “I Want Candy” has been covered numerous times, but Bow Wow Wow’s 1982 version has become synonymous with New Wave pop and MTV.\n\nWhile they are known as a one-hit wonder in the U.S., Bow Wow Wow had a number hits in the U.K., before and after “I Want Candy,” including “C30, C60, C90, Go!” and “Go Wild in the Country.” Bow Wow Wow will perform these hits and more at Brixton on the Redondo Beach Pier Saturday, June 25, along with Star 80s.\n\n“It has a vibrancy, a built-in joy to the music that’s so easy for me to access,” said cofounder and bassist Leigh Gorman, who will share the stage with original lead singer Annabella Lwin and some new bandmates. “I pick up my bass and play those base lines. It makes me feel good.”\n\nGorman, along with guitarist Matthew Ashman and percussionist David Barbarossa, were with Adam and the Ants when Malcolm McLaren, who managed the Sex Pistols, New York Dolls and Adam Ant’s band, convinced them to form their own band around 1980. Gorman said Ant had treated them nicely, but it was time to move on and create their own unique sound.\n\n“We wanted autonomy,” Gorman said. “As ants in Adam and the Ants we were just literally ants. Adam was boss and Malcolm said, ‘Look, if you come with me I’ll be your manager. It will be democratic. It will be your band. You’ll be three guys in charge of your destiny.’”\n\nAfter a six-month search, the band found Lwin by chance when musician David Fishel, who knew McLaren, heard the teenager, who was around 14 years old at the time, singing while she was working part-time at a dry cleaning shop.\n\n“She had her own energy and her own voice, sonically, that fits our crazy spectrum of music,” Gorman said. “We do music that’s not conventional in lots of different ways. She had the enthusiasm and that extra sparkle.”\n\nBow Wow Wow eventually signed with RCA. They some success in the U.K. with “Go Wild in the Country,” but they wanted to go to America. In order to do that, they had “hoops to jump through to get support from the label.”\n\n“The U.K. and the U.S. (RCA) had a rivalry,” Gorman said. “At the time the U.K. had a lot of U.K. chart hits. We wanted to go to America to try our luck, but the U.S. label said if you want to come you have to have material that fits our market … it’s too weird. That wanted a much more radio-friendly song. We thought we had radio-friendly songs. I thought let’s do a cover of a classic bubblegum song. I was thinking the Archie’s ‘Sugar Sugar,’ but that was just too lame. We left it at that. It seemed to appease the record label, but we had to deliver a song and record it and everything.”\n\nThey got a house in Miami to record a new song even though they hadn’t finalized any song yet. Eventually, “I Want Candy” was suggested to them, and they hit the studio with Kenny Laguna, who managed Joan Jett, as producer.\n\n“We spent the next couple of days in rehearsal in Miami getting it ready,” Gorman said. “We did it really quickly. We jammed it out and recorded it the next day.”\n\nWith a hit song, there was pressure to follow up “I Want Candy” and to hit the road. While reaching further success in the U.K., (the band traveled to England to be on “Top of the Pops” while recording “I Want Candy” because of its hit single) the band’s follow-up recording never repeated the success of “I Want Candy.” Gordon blames the heavy touring schedule, which didn’t allow them much time in the recording studio, and decisions by RCA.\n\n“We should have released the U.K. single, which was a bigger hit, which was ‘Go Out in the Country,’ the song they wouldn’t release in the U.S. originally,” he said. “If they had done that, I think it would have been a hit. It was a bigger hit in the U.K. and Europe and Australia than ‘I Want Candy.’ It was our original song. It was more about the political infighting between the U.S. and the U.K. label that we got caught in the middle of.”\n\nWhile on a grueling 50-date tour, not only was Gorman sick, but also Ashman was especially ill. When they got back from a two-week vacation and set to embark on another 50-date tour, they came back to New York and both were still very sick and they didn’t know why.\n\n“We both looked at each other in the lobby of the hotel and went ‘Oh my god we’re still sick,’” Gorman said. “Matthew, poor fellow, we did a show in New York at this animal park. We came back on for the encore and Matthew fell off the stage about 20 feet on the concrete and fractured his arm. We still did the encore. His fingers still worked, but the arm was kind of held together. Overnight his arm became enormous and we took him to the hospital.”\n\nBlood tests showed that Ashman was diabetic. In a couple of weeks, without diagnosis, he would have been either blind or dead. But it ended up being the final act for Bow Wow Wow. After Ashman recovered, he left Bow Wow Wow and formed his own band. He died in 1995, at the age of 35, from diabetes complications. So by 1983, after releasing three albums, the band was finished, but the three original men did reunite briefly, forming the group Chiefs of Relief.\n\nGorman went on to writing songs, session work, record producing and later composing music for TV, film and commercials. In 1996, he got a call about possibly reuniting and touring with other 1980s bands like ABC, but that never panned out. But it did get Bow Wow Wow back together, without Barbarossa, who wasn’t interested. Gorman and Lwin moved to L.A.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years, Gorman said he is pleasantly surprised by the enduring popularity of “I Want Candy,” and he still loves playing the music of Bow Wow Wow.\n\n“When I play other people’s music or I do music myself for films or TV commercials … it’s not the same,” Gorman said. “I suppose I’m recapturing my youth. It keeps trying to get away.”"
