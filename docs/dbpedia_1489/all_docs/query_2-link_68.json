        "text": "Hal Blaine, the legendary session drummer who died last Tuesday at age 90, can lay claim to many records, literally: he played on more than six thousand singles, including 150 that hit the top ten in the U.S. and 40 that reached the top. It’s no wonder that he was the backbone of a cavalcade of musicians known as the Wrecking Crew. Last year he received a Lifetime Achievement GRAMMY, and he got to work with some of the biggest stars in music history: Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys.\n\nBut his contribution to musical history will inarguably be the four-beat phrase his drums introduced to the pop lexicon: dum…dum-dum…psh. That’s the opening beat to the Ronettes' classic girl-group single \"Be My Baby\" in 1963, and has gone on to become one of the most beloved and widely imitated beats in rock and pop, up there with the Bo Diddley beat. Below are a mere 30 of some of the most memorable uses of Blaine’s signature drum figure, but there are dozens more.\n\nJan & Dean, \"Dead Man's Curve\" (1964)\n\nBefore \"Leader of the Pack,\" there was this 1964 single that also concerned a fatal crash, and its tense, busy drums vary the \"Be My Baby\" sound with more anxious fills akin to Keith Moon or the Beatles' \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" — over a year before either existed.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1Cuekbklkg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Beach Boys, \"Don't Worry Baby\" (1964)\n\nThe sweet, haunted \"Don’t Worry Baby\" is what happens when one of music’s most beloved geniuses tries to do his own version of \"Be My Baby\" because he believes it’s the greatest pop song ever made. He doesn’t nick the beat exactly — in 1964, Brian Wilson was a little too square and straightforward for true rhythmic herky-jerk — but he does include the real deal at the very beginning, before taking it, and American pop, somewhere else entirely.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lW0YGC68qP4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Four Seasons, \"Rag Doll\" (1964)\n\nFrankie Valli's 1964 chart-topper may have well been the first big hit to capitalize on Hal Blaine's booming signature, and you can hear how fresh the beat still sounds behind that multilayered vocal swirl and twinkling glockenspiel. Too bad the lyrics are kind of pathetic; Valli basically sings about his crush on a girl who’s too poor for his parents to approve.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYBZqfOZiS4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Shangri-Las, \"Leader of the Pack\" (1964)\n\nReleased just a year after \"Be My Baby\" itself, the Shangri-Las’ fellow classic number-one hit proceeds directly from its source by cutting the snare drum so the tension never gets relieved, a fitting treatment for a teen melodrama in which the motorcycle-driving title crush meets his tragic end.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8UKf65NOzM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nBadfinger, \"Baby Blue\" (1971)\n\nOne of the first post-Beatles groups, even signing to the Fab Four's own Apple label, Badfinger were more adept at pantomiming legendary pop moves than most, making this beat an easy inclusion to their arsenal.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkA7xQb6uPk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nBilly Joel, \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (1976)\n\nMegastar and self-identified \"melody freak\" Joel would go on to do a whole retro tribute to the Four Seasons, Motown and others with 1983's An Innocent Man, but that doesn’t mean he was gonna wait seven years to lob his own \"Be My Baby\" homage at the charts.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9591zjK_n08\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nMeat Loaf, \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth\" (1977)\n\nMeat Loaf and Jim Steinman's bestselling theater-rock hybrid is mostly remember for taking Springsteen to Broadway four decades before the Boss had the idea, but the Ronettes' earthy, celestial sound is as crucial to E Street as Bob Dylan was, and it’s no surprise that the biggest post-Born to Run album dabbled in their classic beat either.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wO8toxinoc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nHall & Oates, \"The Last Time\" (1978)\n\nThe biggest blue-eyed soul act of all-time were pop virtuosos, of course they were gonna take the \"Be My Baby\" backbeat for a spin.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-Wz9cxNbfU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Clash, \"The Card Cheat\" (1980)\n\nPerhaps the least punk-sounding tune on London Calling, \"The Card Cheat\" announces its regal grandeur with — what else? — the beat of a pop classic, here refitted for grand piano and even horns.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZQOZC_ELBg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain, \"Just Like Honey\" (1985)\n\nYou could say the Jesus and Mary Chain's overwhelmingly distorted college radio hit repopularized the \"Be My Baby\" beat's legend entirely, for a new audience of musicians and fans discovering indie and alternative about to be born. But JAMC also loved the beat so much, their cult-hit debut Psychocandy even used it in a second song, \"Sowing Seeds.\"\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7EgB__YratE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nDepeche Mode, \"A Question of Lust\" (1986)\n\nA year after the Jesus and Mary Chain made the \"Be My Baby\" beat cool again to a whole new generation, even the dour princes of synth-pop had to dive in with this clanging 1986 ballad.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOtRZOlE0WM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nPet Shop Boys, \"King's Cross\" (1987)\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Depeche Mode, the poster boys for percolating synth-pop found away to bring Hal Blaine into the computer age with the airy, hymnlike closer from their 1987 sophomore album, Actually.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fv8YiZXlOQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Go-Betweens, \"Hope Then Strife\" (1987)\n\nIt’s telling how many artists utilized the \"Be My Baby\" beat for an album’s big finish, in this case, the classic Tallulah from Australia’s headiest alternative band, who give Blaine’s beat one of its most elegant treatments, thanks to Amanda Brown's gorgeous oboe.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELBWx-oH5E0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Magnetic Fields, \"Candy\" (1992)\n\nAs with a large chunk of auteurs on this list, Stephin Merritt is a songwriter who functions as a human pop database, whether he’s inverting clichés invented by Irving Berlin or indulging in deadpan homage, which he and his then-lead singer Susan Amway did on one of the earliest Magnetic Fields albums with this gender-twisted pill of sugar.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLd_N6CFBwY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs, \"Our Time\" (2001)\n\nWhen Karen O, Nick Zinner, and Brian Chase needed something humungous to close out their opening salvo to the world, what could be more memorable than the melody of \"Crimson And Clover\" grafted onto the \"Be My Baby\" drums? Mission accomplished.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnP-BQQ9q-A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nSleater-Kinney, \"Oh!\" (2002)\n\nSleater-Kinney’s idea of classic girl-group pop is, of course, much faster and louder than the originals. But you might not even notice that One Beat’s poppiest track, “Oh!” has sped up the “Be My Baby” rhythm into this nervy screwdriver.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XFkMvOL5MpE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Raveonettes, \"Little Animal\" (2003)\n\nThe most sexually explicit tune in the Raveonettes’ considerably “Be My Baby”-influenced catalogue (Ronnie Spector herself even appeared on 2005’s Pretty in Black) hinges on a line that rhymes with “I guess it’s just my luck” and was their first to actually use the Ronettes’ beat itself, smack in the middle of an entire album composed in the key of B flat major.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VRTK7aqIob0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nJohnny Boy, \"You Are the Generation That Bought More Shoes And You Get What You Deserve\" (2004)\n\nThis beloved 2004 indie-pop single sounds exactly like one of those contemporaneous dozen-member collectives like I’m From Barcelona or Los Campesinos! except their huge, Spector-esque sound was the work of just two members. And any self-respecting Wall of Sound worshippers are gonna steal from \"Be My Baby.\"\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rNTUAQ6F74k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nJens Lekman, \"A Higher Power\" (2004)\n\nThe closing tune on the wry Swedish indie-pop powerhouse’s debut snips the snare from the Ronettes’ template to give boom to a relentless string section and a lyric about two protagonists that make out with plastic bags over their heads until they pass out.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZrXL_XEQ2GY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nBat for Lashes, \"What’s A Girl To Do?\" (2006)\n\nNatasha Khan’s debut single is one of the best-ever uses of Hal Blaine’s magical pound, giving it elements rarely associated with the beat, like an eerie harpsichord and a minor-key chord progression. And the Donnie Darko-tinged video of synchronized bike-riding is even better.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9IwDezLbQ1g\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe Shins, \"Phantom Limb\" (2007)\n\nBy the Shins’ third album, Wincing the Night Away, James Mercer was giving his dense and knotty melodies-within-melodies more room to breathe, and the slowed, spacious setting was just perfect for a first single that deployed a tambourine-heavy variation on the world’s most famous beat.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkITsv3Nk6M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nJay Reatard, \"An Ugly Death\" (2008)\n\nThe late Jay Lindsey wrote songs as tight and propulsive as the best punk with a pile of shambolic hooks that even the best pop isn’t always completely stuffed with, and this Farfisa-crazy 2008 single tips its hat to Hal Blaine before perfectly exemplifying both.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0U2O5VT2BZE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nDeerhunter, \"Vox Humana\" (2008)\n\nOne of the least pop-oriented bands on this list, Deerhunter is still a perfect match for a beat that leaves such cavernous air open to fill with hazy instrumental smoke and wispy vocals, in this case Bradford Cox’s monologue operating like a \"My Boyfriend’s Back\" that stretches out the spoken intro to three minutes.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CbI75qOF7Sw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nGod Help The Girl, \"Perfection As A Hipster\" (2009)\n\nIf contemporary users of the \"Be My Baby\" beat have anything in common, it’s that they’re usually pop nerds with one foot in not nostalgia itself but an internalized old-time aesthetic. So you get the fuzzy girl-group pop of the Raveonettes and a surfy variation by Best Coast, and this Belle & Sebastian side project all dusting off classic sounds from long before their late-2000s emergences. The only surprise here is that Stuart Murdoch didn’t use it sooner.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yzN0ysW0uKg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nBest Coast, \"I Want To\" (2010)\n\nBethany Cosentino’s excellent 2010 debut Crazy for You is soaked in splashy reverb that suits its gorgeous throwback ambitions. Though the molasses-paced \"I Want To\" is its only track that actually swipes the \"Be My Baby\" rhythm, you’ll swear you remembered at least six others that did, too, in true Jesus and Mary Chain fashion.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wByxZ_lUrqU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nLykke Li, \"Sadness Is a Blessing\" (2011)\n\nSwedish electro-pop phenom Lykke Li went back much further for this massively Spectorian single that culminates in one perfect, silly encapsulation of her attitude: \"Sadness is my boyfriend / Oh sadness, I’m your girl.\"\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xu-b3u5jDiU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nLady Gaga, \"Hair\" (2011)\n\nOur reigning pop encyclopedia’s take showcases the drum line's strength as a part rather than the sum of a song’s beat, building from the stop-start tension of \"Be My Baby\" in the song’s intro to an EDM floor-filler of a chorus and some of the last recorded sax-playing ever by Springsteen’s longtime right-hand big man Clarence Clemons.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Okq8xHrIZ8I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nCar Seat Headrest, \"My Boy\" (2011/2018)\n\nIn 2011 (and again in 2018), Will Toledo recorded (and rerecorded) his fan-favorite song cycle Twin Fantasy with what else but the biggest beat imaginable to open it up?\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNqJFVOKaU0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAlice Bag, \"He's So Sorry\" (2016)\n\nTurning one of the more disturbing girl-group tropes on its head, L.A. punk legend Alice Bag released this 2016 song to highlight the domestic violence in famous songs like \"He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)\" and \"Johnny Get Angry,\" and she even donned a retro get-up in the video amid disturbing scenes of abuse. Using the \"Be My Baby\" beat was only natural for a song that ties Phil Spector's best and worst legacies together.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsAEEY4aJTg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nLana Del Rey feat. The Weeknd, \"Lust for Life\" (2017)\n\nAs with Best Coast or the Raveonettes, it’s somewhat amazing that retro-pop revivalist Lana Del Rey hasn't used Hal Blaine’s signature beat more often, though it’s just too perfect for a song pretty much literally about climbing the Hollywood sign.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eP4eqhWc7sI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWrecking Crew Drummer Hal Blaine Has Died At 90\n\nOne of your biggest hits was \"December 1963 (Oh What A Night!).\" I always wondered if that was a random date, or if you chose it because that period was a unique moment in history: a month after the Kennedy assassination, but two months before the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan.\n\nIt was originally a song with lyrics about the '20s, '30s and '40s. The lyrics were \"Flippers flopping on the floor.\" It was a totally different song. When Bob brought it into the studio, he was disappointed we weren't crazy about it and he wanted to junk the song. We said, \"No, you can come up with something better than this,\" and he rewrote it to fit the time.\n\nIs there one song that you thought should have been bigger than it was?\n\nThe funny thing about records during the days when we recorded, and the record business was as big as it was, to become a hit it was important that the record company do the legwork and get radio stations to play it, or try it for two weeks. I thought there was a lot of what we did that was overlooked because the record company wasn't that crazy about it.\n\nFor example, I put the single \"We're All Alone\" out, and the record company didn't want to work it. I did mine with the London Symphony Orchestra. Later, Rita Coolidge came out with the same song and it went to No. 1. Sometimes things like that happen.\n\nA song like \"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\" was in the can for two or three years. We had to force the record company to release it and hire independent promotion people to work the record and get it on the radio.\n\n\"My Eyes Adored You\" was recorded for Motown Records and that one was in the can for three years because they weren't too sure about it. Finally, when we left Motown, we asked if we can buy back the track, and they agreed for us to purchase it. We did and we brought it to every record company in the business and they all said no.\n\nEventually, we found Larry Uttal with a brand new record company, Private Stock Records, and he said, \"That'll be my first No. 1 record for my new company.\" And it was!\n\nFrom when you first started recording in the early '50s to when \"Sherry\" hit No. 1 was a period of nine years. That's a long time. Why did you stick with it?\n\nIt was always music first. If I had no success at all, I'd probably still be doing music somewhere in New Jersey or New York. I knew exactly what I wanted to do and wanted to be.\n\nAt first, I rejected the fact that I might have to do pop music, but as I started to do it and it became successful, I realized it was a music that people could understand. And what are you doing music for? You're doing it for people. Without an audience you wouldn't have anything.\n\nMy love of music started out for the very first time with me seeing Frank Sinatra as a boy when my mom took me to the Paramount Theater in New York City. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I was so inspired; I made up my mind that that's what I wanted to do.\n\nLiving Legends: Nancy Sinatra Reflects On Creating \"Power And Magic\" In Studio, Developing A Legacy Beyond \"Boots\" & The Pop Stars She Wants To Work With\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nDuring Beatles listening events, there's a little bit of tension between yourself and that fan community. This Beach Boys event seemed to possess a completely different energy — less antagonistic, more of a lovefest. What's it been like moving from the Beatles world to the Beach Boys world as per their fan communities?\n\nI don't know — I think that I may not be perceiving it right [laughs].\n\nI never felt that there was a huge amount of antagonism with the Beatles thing. I think to begin with, there was. With the early days of me, certainly, doing Love, ironically, there was a suspicion of what I was up to — what are my motives, and what gives you the right to screw around with these tracks, and who the hell do you think you are, and that sort of thing.\n\nI think there's been a sort of shift in a level of trust, hopefully, that people don't realize that I deliberately do this to try and screw things up.\n\nI was actually more nervous going to a Beach Boys playback than I was going to a Beatles playback. With the Beatles, I kind of know where I am — and regardless of what anyone may think, I probably have more experience on this than most other people do.\n\nThe Beach Boys, I don't. It's my first rodeo, if you like, so I was probably a bit more nervous addressing their audience.\n\n\"Antagonism\" is probably too strong a word. Just a little bit of tension in the air, when somebody's like, \"What happened to that guitar squeak at 2:01 on 'Taxman,' Giles? Would you like to explain yourself?\"\n\nThat always makes me laugh. There are two guys who are those people, and they come and listen in the studios. They came around recently for something, and they were like, \"Well, we heard something at this moment.\"\n\nI'll always listen and respect what they say, but then I'll just go… I do have Paul and Ringo. So they'll just go, \"Well, we think it's fine.\"\n\nI think what you are alluding to is there's a sense of ownership that people have over Beatles music. But I think that's the case with Pet Sounds and the Beach Boys as well.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, what's it been like docking your spaceship on a new mothership?\n\nI pay no attention to the business side of stuff. It's the same record label, actually — Capitol. I have a really good relationship with them, and they're great.\n\nThey know what they're getting themselves into by asking me to do stuff, which means that generally, things will be late; I'll miss deadlines. But they also know that I'll take care. And I think part of my job is, obviously, listening to what people have to say, and listening to and collaborating with other people on this, and doing it.\n\nWhat role did the Beach Boys and Pet Sounds play in your life up to this point? Obviously, you're steeped in this overall miasma due to your lineage.\n\nIt's funny: as I said to my dad [legendary Beatles producer George Martin], \"It's amazing the work you did.\" And he was like, \"Yeah, but I mean, compared to what Brian Wilson did when he was just on his own — you need to go listen to that.\" And so I did, and I suppose that there's an otherworldliness to it.\n\nJust as a producer, or someone who loves music, Pet Sounds could not be ignored, because it's so intricate in the way it is, and it's an album that gets better the more you listen to it as well. And I hope that is sustainable in times of TikTok where people only have a short amount of time to pay anything attention.\n\nI suppose that I wouldn't have agreed to do it if it wasn't important to me.You have to give it your all; you have to spend a lot of time listening to this music. It's such an important and influential record — not just for other people, but for me as well.\n\n**You mentioned during the listening party that you didn't have to employ the same AI techniques to unglue the tracks as you did on Revolver. Can you elaborate?**\n\nI wouldn't say it was unglued. If you imagine on, for instance, \"That's Not Me,\" essentially, the band are kind of on three tracks a lot. So, they're stuck.\n\nAnd \"That's Not Me\" has drums, organ, tambourine on one track. So, I can't move the organ or tambourine away from the drums. They have to be on one side. And I have bass and lead guitar on another track, so bass and guitar are going to be in the same place no matter what I do.\n\nBut there's an intent with this, where it's unlike having a band like the Beatles. This isn't really a band record; it's more of an orchestral record. It has a backing to it.\n\nThere's not really a drum kit on Pet Sounds, per se. There's drums on one or two tracks, but there's not really a drum kit. It's like orchestral percussion. So it's fine having those things glued together. Whereas on something like \"Taxman,\" we have guitar, bass and drums — and only guitar, bass and drums going on for the whole song.\n\nIf you want to have a stereo record, you have to separate them — because otherwise, they're just on one side and the vocals on the other side; there's no reality. But with this, you have chunks of musicians in a room, and then you can create this real world around it.\n\n**Brian Wilson rightfully soaks up the lion's share of the discourse around Pet Sounds; he crafted the record. But in this process, what did you learn about them as per their group dynamic? You alluded to their vocal precision during the listening event. I love Carl and Bruce's vocals on \"God Only Knows.\" I know that Carl and Dennis played on the record in a limited capacity.**\n\nI don't know what I learned that I didn't already know, apart from the fact that — this is what people miss — bands exist with resentment, and everything else. But bands exist because they're human beings in a room. The fact that you don't hear someone doesn't mean that they're not having influence.\n\nWith the Beach Boys, obviously, you hear their incredible harmonies. And Brian couldn't have done what he did without having the palette of outstanding musicianship, and the ability for these guys to harmonize and create these vocals that can't exist anywhere else.\n\nSo, that's what I suppose you hear. You hear the other members of the band come in on tracks, as you alluded to, and you suddenly think — not that it's a relief, but it's like, Oh my god, this is a band. This isn't just Brian. That's what I took from it.\n\n**I could genuinely sit there and think about the Beach Boys on a conceptual level and be entertained for hours. But is there a danger of overthinking an artifact like Pet Sounds? Or is it a fount for infinite analysis and edification?**\n\nNo, I think you are absolutely right. You can take the fun out of it — and people do frequently — by being too pretentious about things. I find this quite amusing. It's almost like the song becomes the ownership of the journalist — or the expert, if you like — and not the person listening to it.\n\nPeople are told what to listen to, and what to listen out for, in a sort of educational way: \"You don't really understand this.\" It's that sort of thing: \"If only you knew you knew how good this was, you'd be able to like it.\" That sort of conversation. \"Music isn't like how it used to be, because it's not as good as this,\" and all this sort of conversation.\n\nIt's absolutely rubbish. It's like, let people enjoy what they want to enjoy. As long as you're passionate about something, it doesn't make a difference whether you like Megadeth or the Beach Boys.\n\nYou recently worked on a refreshed version of Paul McCartney's \"Live or Let Die.\" That song is such a mind movie — and not just because it has James Bond roots. I'm sure you had fun with that one.\n\nIt was great. It's a bit like a lot of the projects I do; the expectancy is so vast spread.\n\nIt's quite tricky; how do you meet the expectation? Because one thing that mono or stereo or compression gives you, is it gives you loudness. You separate stuff in an immersive soundfield, you have to be careful that you don't start losing impact.\n\nOne thing that \"Live and Let Die\" has is impact. And that's the tricky thing about that song. But I'm really happy. It was actually a big mix to do; I can't lie. It was like, \"Oh my god, here we go; I have to be fully qualified to do this mix.\"\n\nBut I'm really happy with it. I can't wait for people to hear it. I think it's super cool.\n\nHow do you want to get better at what you do? Where do you want to improve?\n\nOh, god. \"Everywhere\" is the answer. I think you are never done. It's only sometimes I hear things back and go, Oh, that actually sounds quite good. Oh, I did that. That's alright. Otherwise, you sort of hate everything.\n\nI nervously watched you [all] through a screen in New York going, Oh my god, it sounds terrible. That's what goes through my head.\n\nYou still struggle with that, huh?\n\nYeah, of course. And then the thing is, I don't think, What if it sounds terrible? because of ego. It's, What if it sounds terrible because you guys really like this record and I need to do it justice? That's what goes through my head.\n\nThe Beach Boys' Sail On Sailor Reframes Two Obscure 1970s Albums. Why Were They Obscure In The First Place?"
