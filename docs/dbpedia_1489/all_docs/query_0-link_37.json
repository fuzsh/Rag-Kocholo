        "text": "I Want Candy was a hit for the group Bow Wow Wow in 1982. They didn’t have much other success, but that one song has retained a lasting power exceeding the songs of groups that had more hits (*cough* Flock of Seagulls *cough*). Something to do with its great Buddy Hollyesque beat.\n\nI Want Candy was a remake of a song originally recorded in 1965 by a group called The Strangeloves, who also didn’t have much other success. In the last decade, others have recorded the song, including Aaron Carter (whose version is so pre-teen and bubbly that it inspired a sarcastic reaction song called I Want Candy Dead) and Melanie C as a one-off for a movie.\n\nI Want Candy is a sexual song, that’s pretty clear. The lyrics are suggestive, but relatively tasteful.\n\nI know a girl who’s soft and sweet\n\nShe’s so fine, she can’t be beat\n\nGot everything that I desire\n\nSets the summer sun on fire\n\nI want Candy, I want Candy\n\nGo to see her with her hair hung down\n\nAin’t no finer girl in town\n\nCandy’s just what the doctor ordered\n\nShe’s so sweet, she makes my mouth water\n\nI want Candy, I want Candy\n\nCandy on the beach, there’s nothing better\n\nBut I like Candy when it’s wrapped in a sweater\n\nSome day soon I’ll make her mine\n\nThen I’ll have Candy all the time\n\nI want Candy, I want Candy\n\nThe above are the original lyrics. Here’s a video:\n\nMelanie dresses in tight leather, dances like a stripper, fondles fluorescent lights, rubs her breasts, licks her parted lips, and otherwise acts like a whore. Furthermore, the men are half-naked beefcake sex objects for her playthings. But it doesn’t end there, no.\n\nShe’s a girl now singing about “a girl who’s tough but sweet”, which could be construed as either lesbian or straight on straight girl activity, either one representing an uninhibited, gender-blind sexuality: she can sleep with men or women and she can do it in public.\n\nThis video is pretty representative of how female performers present themselves nowadays: as strippers, soaked in sexuality, without any inhibitions, mysteries, innocence, shyness, or self-respect. I won’t say that it can’t get any worse; it certainly can, and I fear that it will. In another twenty years, they’ll simply be having sex on stage.\n\nI kind of miss the 80s version, though. There should still be some child-like fun left in the world."
