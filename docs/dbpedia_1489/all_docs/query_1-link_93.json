        "text": "Children of the aughts, rejoice — and get ready to feel old — because one of your favorite songs just got a 2018 update. Aaron Carter's \"I Want Candy\" remix is unexpected, but we're loving the new twist on the 2000 song.\n\nFans of Aaron Carter's 2000 album Aaron's Party (Come Get It) will remember songs like \"I Want Candy,\" \"That's How I Beat Shaq,\" and, of course, the album's title track. And who can forget when he performed \"I Want Candy\" while guest-starring on a holiday-themed episode of Lizzie McGuire? Just thinking about the song takes us back to the good old days of watching Disney Channel sitcoms — probably while wearing Limited Too clothes. (And, if you're like me, your parents might have reminded you, more than once, that Aaron Carter's recording was a cover of The Strangeloves' original track — but Carter's was the version we grew up with.) The remix comes as Carter's new album, LøVë, was released Friday. LøVë is his first full-length album in 15 years, so fans of his music will be thrilled to know he's been back in the studio. The new version of \"I Want Candy\" is totally 2018-appropriate, thanks to some electronic influences — it's perfect to add to your workout playlist.\n\nThe new album is a comeback for more than just Carter's music career, as well. After a rough 2017 that included the death of his father and a voluntary check-in at a treatment facility, Carter appears to be in a much better place in 2018.\n\n\"I went through a lot of different growing processes, and I wanted to really become an artist before I came back out,\" Carter told Yahoo Entertainment of his return to music. \"I didn't really want to have to, you know, be singing everybody else's music. So I'm involved in the production, I'm involved in the writing — I have a big creative involvement in it.\"\n\nIt sounds like Carter was super connected with LøVë from start to finish. And some of the tracks come from a personal place, too. Carter told Entertainment Tonight that he wrote the song \"Seattle Tide\" after bumping into his ex-girlfriend Madelaine Petsch at a Seattle airport post-breakup. He also told ET that his song \"Champion\" is about his late father, Robert Carter.\n\nDespite the tragic loss, as well as his personal battles, Carter appears to be doing well as he promotes his new work. The singer also recently celebrated his weight gain and said he feels \"cautiously optimistic\" about the future during an appearance on The Real.\n\nAnd in addition to promoting his new work, Carter's also been advocating for a new law that would help other child stars in similar positions to where he was in the 2000s. Earlier this week, the singer explained to Entertainment Tonight what he called the \"Carter Law,\" a proposed legislation that would allow child stars to access their earnings at incremental periods after their 18th birthday, rather than all at once.\n\n\"That's one of my goals and one of the things I want to leave as my legacy is that I went through certain experiences and then I created this law protecting kids from themselves essentially and from their lack of experience,\" Carter told ET. It's a lofty goal, but it's definitely an admirable one, especially since Carter's experienced the effects of being a child star firsthand.\n\nWe're here for Carter's new album — and the \"I Want Candy\" remix — and are hoping the best for him during his continued recovery. And if he ever wants to remix \"Aaron's Party (Come Get It),\" we'd be down for that, too."
