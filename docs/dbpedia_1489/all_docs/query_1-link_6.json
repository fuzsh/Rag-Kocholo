        "text": "One of the colorful British bands that found stateside success during the early-'80s MTV explosion, Bow Wow Wow is best known for its irresistible anthem \"I Want Candy.\"\n\nBow Wow Wow's vocalist, the fetching and frolicsome Annabella Lwin, will perform Aug. 3 at the Hard Rock Rocksino in Northfield Park, as part of the '80s-themed Retro Futura Tour.\n\n\"I just did some dates in the U.K. and it was really, really lovely. It's nice to be remembered and to actually see them singing along,\" Lwin said via telephone last week. \"We'll see if it continues. It's been 38 years, on and off. I'm still hoping to leave some hearts smiling.\"\n\nHer beginnings in the pop scene sound like a scene from a movie. Lwin was 13 years old and working at a dry cleaners in London \"for Saturday pocket money,\" when she was overheard singing along to the Top-40 radio.\n\nCareer twist\n\n\"This guy came in and said, 'Do you sing a lot?' I said, 'Kind of,'\" she recalled. \"The next thing you know, he's taking us -- I took a friend with me -- to this divey little rehearsal room in the middle of nowhere on the other side of London. We walked into the room and there's a girl with red hair standing behind the microphone.\"\n\nA new band was auditioning for a vocalist. The first person who talked to Lwin was guitarist Matthew Ashman. One of the songs Ashman had her sing was \"C30, C60, C90 Go\" which would be Bow Wow Wow's first single. \"It was amazing! So snappy!\" she said.\n\n\"I was a little shocked to hear my voice coming out of this little black box. It was the first time I ever heard myself singing.\"\n\nAt home that evening, the band's manager, a man named Malcolm McLaren, phoned Lwin's home and asked her mother if he could come over. \"Malcolm came round to meet me and my mother. He asked me to sing a song. The rest is history,\" she said.\n\nLwin had never imagined herself a singer. \"I wanted to be an air stewardess, wearing those really smart uniforms and traveling around the world,\" she said.\n\nA fast ride\n\nMcLaren had risen to infamy as the impresario behind notorious U.K. punk band the Sex Pistols. Bow Wow Wow was his new project.\n\n\"The music press in England latched onto Malcolm. He said he was trying to create something new and fresh,\" Lwin said. \"He had a lot of ideas. There was this song 'Sexy Eiffel Tower' and he said, 'Sing it like you're falling off the Eiffel Tower!'\" It was McLaren who came up with the band's distinctive drum-heavy sound, suspiciously similar to that of Adam and the Ants, whom McClaren had worked with previously.\n\nAt her first concert with Bow Wow Wow, \"I had to stand on a box 'cause no one could see me. I was terrified. There were all these punk rockers spitting at me. It was at the Starlight Roller Disco. Everybody was going round of roller blades.\"\n\nThe British music scene at the time was booming. \"It was the Clash, the Stray Cats, the Buzzcocks, the Specials, the Thompson Twins, people like that were around. Those were the groups we crossed paths with,\" Lwin said. \"It was very interesting, my teenaged years. I had no idea what the music industry was about. I wasn't experienced with being onstage. I just loved singing.\"\n\nIn 1983, Bow Wow Wow released its second full-length album, \"When the Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going,\" which contained the single \"Do You Wanna Hold Me,\" but the band broke up that September. Lwin released a solo album under the name Annabella, formed a band called Naked Experience, then helped reform Bow Wow Wow for a 1997 tour.\n\nThe current Retro Futura tour includes Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go's, ABC, Modern English, Limahl from Kajagoogoo, and Tony Lewis from the Outfield. \"Everybody's getting along, it's really nice,\" Lwin said. \"It's like a team of people. I'm on first (at the shows) so don't be late.\"\n\nReach Dan at 330-580-8306 or dan.kane@cantonrep.com\n\nOn Twitter: @dkaneREP\n\nWHO: Retro Futura Tour with Belinda Carlisle from the Go-Go's, ABC, Modern English, Annabella Lwin from Bow Wow Wow, Limahl from Kajagoogoo and Tony Lewis from the Outfield.\n\nWHEN: Aug. 3, 7:30 p.m.\n\nWHERE: Hard Rock Rocksino, Northfield Park.\n\nTICKETS: $85.50, $61, $55.50, $48.50 at LiveNation.com.\n\nIf you go"
