        "text": "Compiled by Jon Prince\n\nEstablished in 1927, we have seen many candy trends come and go, and we are often asked about the history of candy and the current craze for retro sweets.\n\nPerhaps we could say that the fascination with candy, particularly chocolate, first occurred in 1502 when Christopher Columbus returned home from his fourth voyage of the \"Americas.\" Although he was not partial to this bittersweet treat, his benefactors in Spain found it fascinating and consumed it in a liquid format.\n\nIn England, during the eighteenth century, a knight was given a pound of chocolate, perhaps to compliment his shining armor, when he received his dubbing!\n\nFive hundred years later, the love of chocolate continues stronger than ever!\n\nAlthough it would be impossible to present a detailed history, this timeline illustrates the development of the American candy industry from the 1800s onward. Of course, as you will see, many retro candies and their founding companies have come and gone. Still, it is interesting that 65 percent of American candy bars have been around for more than 60 years, and giant conglomerates have acquired many original brands. We hope you enjoy the journey!\n\nPS: The vintage picture above is our first candy showroom Circa. 1943\n\nThe 1800s\n\n1847 Joseph Fry invented the first \"modern\" candy bar in England by mixing cacao butter, cocoa, and sugar into a paste and placing it in a mold.\n\n1847 Oliver Chase invented the machine for cutting lozenges and hence, the fabled Necco Wafer was born.\n\n1848 John Curtis produced the first branded chewing gum, made from tree sap, called The State of Maine Spruce Gum\n\n1854 The first packaged box of Whitman's Chocolate hits the scene\n\n1864 The first chocolate-covered liquid center cherry was invented by Cella's Cherries.\n\n1868 Richard & George Cadbury, the second generation of Cadburys, makes the first Valentine's Day box of chocolates, starting the tradition that continues today\n\n1879 William H.
