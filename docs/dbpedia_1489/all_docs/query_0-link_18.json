        "text": "\"I Want Candy\" is a song originally recorded by the Strangeloves in 1965 and covered by Bow Wow Wow in 1982. The Bow Wow Wow version of the song, covered by WaveGroup Sound, was featured as the first song in the May 18, 2007 press demo version of Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s that was distributed to official game critics for review, but was ultimately removed in the final release of the game.[1][2][3] This song was not re-released for any other Guitar Hero video game.\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe normal ambient crowd audio is on loop due a programming error in the chart. Within the original note chart file, this is likely due to the [music_start] event tag being accidentally written as [music start] without the underscore (_).[4]\n\nReferences[]"
