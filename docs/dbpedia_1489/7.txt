“I Want Candy” was originally recorded in 1965 by The Strangeloves, a band who wrote songs for other artists. The band wrote the song “My Boyfriends Back.”

“I Want Candy” is the title track from Bow Wow Wow’s 1982 album. Bow Wow Wow’s is made up of the guitarist, bassist and percussionist from Adam Ant’s original band Adam and the Ants. Boy George was expected to be the second lead singer of the band, but was deemed “too wild” for the band. Annabella Lwin, the lead singer, was only 17 when she recorded “I Want Candy”. The producer of the song was Kenny Laguna, who also produced Joan Jett and The Blackheart’s “I Want Rock and Roll.” Joan and the band were in the control room when bassist Leigh Gorman laid down his tracks for “I Want Candy”.

Bow Wow Wow was created by Malcom McLaren to promote his girlfriend and business partner (designer) Vivienne Westwood’s new romantic fashion lines.
