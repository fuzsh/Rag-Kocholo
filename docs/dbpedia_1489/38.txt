Charli XCX recently said that she is determined to replicate the success she has enjoyed with others on her next solo album. Over the past two years, the UK artist has written ‘I Love It’ for Icona Pop and hit the US Billboard Number One alongside Iggy Azalea with their hit ‘Fancy’. However, in an interview with NME, she says it’s time to establish herself as a solo artist.

“I can write a fucking hit song,” she says. “And I’m going to write some for me now. I feel like as an artist I’ve done so many collaborations now that I think I just want to take this record for myself.”

Underlining her desire to make something that appeals to the same number of people as ‘I Love It’ and ‘Fancy’, she continues: “I’m not making a hipster record that’s very cool and sounds like it was made at the beach. It’s easy for me to make a record like that. I’m making a record that people might fucking hate but I don’t care because I’ve done it the way I want to do it.”
