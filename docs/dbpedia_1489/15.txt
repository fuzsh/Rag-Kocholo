Bobby Feldman wrote three hit songs in the 1960s that are still being played and recorded today. His songwriting began at a desk in the Brill Building in New York City. He formed several singing groups that sang his songs, including the Strangeloves who waxed “I Want Candy.” He also wrote “My Boyfriend's Back” for the Angels, and the McCoy’s biggest hit “Hang On Sloopy,” which was originally an R&B song that Bobby modified with tempo changes and extra verses. Along the way, he formed Grand Canyon Music, a publishing as well as record company. Bobby’s song “Sorrow,” written in 1965, was later recorded by David Bowie, who often sang the song during his live shows.
