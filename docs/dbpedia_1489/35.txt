Without looking it up, who else here thought the song "I Want Candy" was first recorded by Bow Wow Wow?

Well I found out tonight it wasn't. It was some band called "The Strangeloves" in 1965.

Here's the version I've always known:

Recorded some 20 years later during the heyday of Adam Ant I always figured Bow Wow Wow was mimicking that sound, I had no idea it was a cover until tonight.

When my son was a little kid he thought it was "I Want Pringles".

I used to say "I Want Candy" when the commercial came on and he would always correct me "No dad it's Pringles!". I would always say "No, it's candy!" without ever mentioning it was a real song.

A few years later he heard the real song and then said "Dad, you were right, it IS I Want Candy!". I said "Yep. Always listen to your dad!"

Bow Wow Wow was another one of Malcolm (Sex Pistols) McLaren's pre-packaged bands, if memory serves.

I remember reading somewhere that they caused a bit of controversy back in the day cuz the girl singer was nude (or at least semi-nude) on an album/single cover, despite being only 14 at the time
