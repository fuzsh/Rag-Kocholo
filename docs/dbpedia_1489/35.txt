This is the best cover of “I Want Candy”, in my opinion. It was written and first recorded by the Strangeloves in 1965.

The lyrics are basically R-rated Bubble Gum. It’s the guitarwork and Burundi-style drumming that make this a worthwhile song.

Bow Wow Wow’s version got heavy airplay on MTV after it was released in 1982. Surprisingly, it only reached #62 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, though it did make the top ten in the UK and Ireland. A reviewer on AllMusic described it as “an enduring new wave classic”.

The song was played during a particularly memorable scene in the raunchy (but sometimes funny) 1983 film, Private School.
