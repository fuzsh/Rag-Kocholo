Celebrate the vinyl holiday with a walking tour on Saturday of Calgary’s central stores.

Recordland @ 1208 9th Ave. S.E.

Recordland’s intimidating collection of used vinyl is a dangerous place to start; it’s easy to spend a whole day digging through the towering shelves. You’ll need discipline to make it to your next stop. 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. 403-262-3839, facebook.com/recordlandcanada.

Sloth Records @ 736B 17th Ave. S.W.

Sloth Records has been slinging new vinyl since before the revival. They are also the place you’ll want to go to grab tickets for the after-party at The Palomino later in the day. 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. 403-265-6585, slothrecords.wordpress.com.

Blackbyrd Myoozik @ 1126 17th Ave. S.W.

Though the store’s home is up the QEII in Edmonton, its Calgary location gets into the civic spirit by inviting local label Inner Ocean Records to spin during their Record Store Day activities. 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 403-367-7811, blackbyrd.ca.
