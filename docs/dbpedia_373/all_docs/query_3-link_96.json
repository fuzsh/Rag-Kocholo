        "text": "Sir Henry Segrave (born Sept. 22, 1896, Baltimore, Md., U.S.â€”died June 13, 1930, Lake Windermere, Westmorland, Eng.) was an American-born English automobile and motorboat racer who set three world land speed records.\n\nEducated at Eton and Sandhurst, Segrave served with the Royal Air Force in World War I. During the war he became interested in automobile racing by a visit to the Sheepshead Bay, Long Island, N.Y., course. He won the French Grand Prix (1923) and the San Sebastian Grand Prix (1924) in Spain, in which he was the first racer to wear a crash helmet. He also won the 200-mile (322-kilometre) race at Brooklands in England (1921, 1925, and 1926) and competed in many hill climbs and speed trials from 1914 to 1927.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nSports Quiz\n\nIn 1926 he first broke the land speed record, driving a Sunbeam at 152.33 mile/h (miles per hour [245.15 km/h]). On March 29, 1927, at Daytona, Fla., driving a 1,000-horsepower Sunbeam with a World War I aero-engine, he became the first driver to exceed 200 mile/h (320 km/h) and established a new record of 203.79 mile/h (327.97 km/h). He set a third record of 231.44 mile/h (372.48 km/h) in March 1929."
