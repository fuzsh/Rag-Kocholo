        "text": "Decide on your sampling technique, especially if you are investigating a large urban area\n\nUsing a large scale map of the study area, select a transect line radiating from the CBD outwards\n\nDevelop a land-use classification key for use during the data collection. This should be based on the type of land use (residential, industrial, etc.) and then sub-divided according to the age, style or function of individual buildings. Your key should allow you to easily classify each individual building you encounter on your transect. You may decide to use a GOAD map of the area as your base map\n\nWalk your transect route and gradually build up information on your base map by adding colours or codes from the key which you have developed\n\nThe map can be redrawn following your fieldwork to ensure that all of the land uses are clearly shown. You can use a GIS package to create land use maps on the computer. Alternatively, you can complete your maps by hand\n\nShops or services of a particular function - clothes shops, for example, are identified and marked onto a base (GOAD) map of the CBD area\n\nEach is numbered\n\nThe linear distance (in cm) from each unit to its nearest neighbour is measured\n\nData is recorded in a table\n\nOnce all distances have been measured, the average is calculated\n\nThe total study area is measured in cm2\n\nThe figures are inputted into the formula to generate a number between zero and 2.15\n\nZero = clustered, one = random, 2.15 = regular distribution\n\nThe shops and services in the CBD are classified using a key, according to their function, for example food shops, shoe shops etc.\n\nThese should be marked clearly onto a map, perhaps using codes or colour coding\n\nTallies are made of the number of shops of each separate function, and the total number of shops is recorded\n\nA diversity index could be calculated as follows:\n\nDI = ∑ (X / N) 2\n\nWhere: DI = Diversity index,\n\nX = Number of shops for that category, for example food shops\n\nN = Total number of shops (for that time period if looking at historical changes)\n\nYou would calculate X/N for each shop type or function, and then add up all of the squared values to give an overall value\n\nValues of DI are from zero to 0.99. The higher the value the greater the diversity\n\nIf looking at changes over time, historical GOAD maps can be used in the same way, and the DI calculated for each time period and compared\n\nMark some main land-marks, shops and services onto a base map of the CBD, and number them\n\nAsk people to attempt to correctly identify which number on the map corresponds to each shop, service and land-mark on the list you present them with\n\nAdditional information could be obtained from each person, for example their age category, gender and ethnicity, plus information about their shopping habits and how often they visit the area\n\nTally the results in a table to show the percentage of correct answers given for each location\n\nThe results could be linked to information on peak land values, for example, is there a greater awareness of places closer to the PLVI (peak land value intersection)? Or accessibility - do more people correctly identify the locations which are more accessible compared to those which are less accessible? Or desirability - link to information on the environmental quality of different areas\n\nPeople could also be provided with a base map of only a few key landmarks, for example a main road or a park, and asked to draw their own ‘mental maps', showing whichever locations you ask them to mark or the areas that they like to visit within the urban area\n\nProvide respondents with a base map of the study area, with a few key features marked on. Depending on the aims of your investigation, ask them to shade the areas:\n\nWhere they feel safest\n\nWhere they perceive there to be greatest risk to their personal safety\n\nWhich they consider to be the most attractive or desirable (in terms of living / shopping / working environment)\n\nWhich they consider to be cleaner, more polluted or run down\n\nAsk respondents to rank particular locations in the area according to certain criteria, for example safety, desirability, attractiveness, cleanliness\n\nExamine any links between the age, gender, ethnicity and social background of the respondents and their perceptions\n\nObtain secondary data on planned developments and, where possible, conduct interviews with developers or company representatives\n\nConduct questionnaires amongst the public, with shop owners and representatives from companies to obtain people's opinions and perceptions about these developments\n\nUse traffic and pedestrian surveys to highlight the potential impact of a proposed development"
