Hot Wax only got 3 copies apparently. Did anyone successfully get the Taylor Swift album? Is there anywhere that still has even one copy left?\n\nThis Taylor Swift release is so important to me, I wish I'd been able to get lined up sooner to get it, but couldn't. And I so don't want to pay someone on eBay 4 times the price to get it."
