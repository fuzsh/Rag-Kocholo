        "text": "The American Gaming Association’s (AGA) Commercial Gaming Revenue Tracker features state-by-state and nationwide financial performance data with breakdowns for individual gaming verticals.\n\nIn May, U.S. commercial gaming industry revenue grew 9.4 percent compared to the same month in 2023, marking the 39th consecutive month of annual growth. According to data from state regulators compiled by the American Gaming Association, the industry win from traditional casino games, sports betting and iGaming reached $6.04 billion, setting a new record for May.\n\nFor the first five months of 2024, commercial gaming revenue has surpassed last year’s record-setting pace by 7.1 percent, totaling $29.75 billion through May.\n\nOf the 34 commercial gaming jurisdictions that were operational a year ago and had published complete May data, 28 reported an increase in combined revenue from traditional casino games, sports betting, and iGaming compared to the previous year.\n\nSports betting revenue data was not yet available for Arizona and Kentucky at the time of writing.\n\nAfter a 0.5 percent decline in April, land-based gaming revenue rebounded in May, driven by strong performance in traditional casino operations and a less unfavorable calendar comparison—May 2024 had the same number of weekend days (eight) as May 2023. Combined revenue from casino slots, table games, and retail sports betting increased by 3.5 percent year-over-year, reaching $4.32 billion.\n\nAt the same time, online gaming continued its robust growth with combined revenue from online sports betting and iGaming jumping 27.8 percent year-over-year to $1.72 billion. In May, online gaming accounted for 28.4 percent of total commercial gaming revenue, a slight decline from April (30.4%).\n\nWhile traditional casino slot machines and table games continue to grow at a slower pace than digital offerings, they remain the primary revenue drivers for the U.S. commercial gaming industry. In May, these segments collectively generated $4.28 billion in total revenue, marking a 3.8 percent year-over-year increase and setting a new record for the month of May. Slot machines contributed $3.10 billion, up 4.0 percent, while table game revenue rose by 3.8 percent to $865.9 million.\n\nThese individual slot and table game figures exclude data from Louisiana and Michigan due to different state reporting methods, but their combined totals are included in the nationwide traditional gaming total.\n\nAt the state level, 22 out of the 27 states offering traditional casino slot machines and/or table games reported gains compared to May 2023, with a median increase of 2.5 percent.\n\nThrough the end of May, year-to-date revenue from casino slot machines and table games totaled $20.69 billion, 0.9 percent ahead of the same period in 2023. This modest national increase was largely driven by new casino openings in Illinois, Nebraska and Virginia.\n\nIn May, land-based and online sportsbooks generated a combined $1.08 billion in commercial revenue across 32 jurisdictions, excluding Arizona and Kentucky, which had not reported their data at the time of publication. This marks a 24.7 percent increase from May 2023, when commercial sports betting was active in 29 jurisdictions.\n\nAdults in 30 jurisdictions could place bets online with commercial sportsbooks, including five states that launched mobile sports betting within the past year: Delaware, Kentucky, Maine, North Carolina, and Vermont. Excluding the impact of new sports betting markets and online expansions, organic sports betting revenue grew by 10.4 percent compared to May 2023.\n\nYear-to-date, commercial sports betting revenue reached $5.72 billion through May, exceeding the same period in the previous year by 24.5 percent.\n\nThe iGaming sector continued its robust growth in May as revenue expanded 28.4 percent year-over-year to $676.5 million across seven active states. This marks the second highest-grossing month ever for U.S. iGaming.\n\nState-level revenue increased year-over-year in all six states where iGaming was active in May 2023.\n\nYear-to-date through May, iGaming revenue reached $3.32 billion, a 25.9 percent increase compared to the same period last year."
