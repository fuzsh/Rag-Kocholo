        "text": "NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Bullish inflation data, a continuous stream of solid earnings results by blue chip financial companies and a series of deals and project announcements in the technology sector pushed U.S. stocks well into record territory early Tuesday after a shaky start of trading.\n\nAt around 10 a.m. the Dow Jones industrial average was 44.67 points higher at 10,384.18. Market breadth on the New York Stock Exchange started the day strongly positive, with gainers leading losers 1,413 to 939 as trading volume reached 118 million shares.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, the index that hosts the majority of high-tech high players, surged 28.47, or 1.1 percent, to 2,627.28. The S&P 500 index inched up 0.75 to 1,359.38.\n\nThe bond market zigzagged in a tight trading band, taking little cue from news that consumer inflation remains benign. News that Serbian troops have entered northern Albania gave the market a short-lived boost. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond traded 5/32 of a point lower in price for a yield of 5.45 percent.\n\nThe dollar gained ground against the euro as the conflict over Kosovo escalated. The dollar also inched up against the yen.\n\nBullish news in the finance sector\n\nFinancial services stocks, which led Wall Street into its record-breaking rally Monday, once again headed higher as earnings news from the industry continued to reveal strong growth and beat expectations.\n\nBroker PaineWebber (PWJ) led the newsmakers Tuesday, reporting the best quarter in its 119-year history. Against forecasts for earnings of 73 cents a share, PaineWebber reported a profit of $1.01 a share. The stock jumped 3-9/16 to 47-1/8.\n\nPaineWebber's news follows similarly strong earnings reports by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MWD) and Bear Stearns (BSC), and was followed by Wall Street's biggest brokerage, Merrill Lynch (MER), which shortly before the market opened reported first-quarter earnings of $1.44 a share, beating forecasts for $1.23 a share. Merrill's stock gained 13/16 to 100-3/4, adding on to a strong advance Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, discount broker Charles Schwab (SCH), which Monday failed to join the financial rally, caught up with the crowd a day later, soaring 13-9/16, or more than 10 percent, to 148-9/16. The company reports its earnings Wednesday.\n\nTechs powered by deals\n\nTechnology stocks also did an about-face Tuesday, following Monday's bruising caused by a profit warning from Compaq (CPQ).\n\nAlthough some earnings jitters continued to linger in the sector, news of deals and projects in the works helped lift many of the high-tech leaders higher.\n\nAmong the leading newsmakers, shares of GeoTel (GEOC), a maker of telecommunications software for routing calls, surged 13-13/16 to 58-1/16, a gain of more than 31 percent, after leading networking equipment maker Cisco Systems (CSCO) said it is buying the company for $2 billion in stock. Cisco's shares eased 11/16 to 117-1/16.\n\nOn the Dow, shares of IBM (IBM) edged 3/8 lower to 183-1/16 even after news Big Blue is expanding its Internet service providing business.\n\nAnd fellow Dow 30 member Hewlett Packard (HWP) advanced 1-1/2 to 69-7/8 after the company repeated Tuesday it expects double-digit revenue growth this year and sees a recovery in Asian business growth.\n\nAlso among the gainers, shares of troubled database software maker Informix (IFMX) surged 2-7/16, or nearly 35 percent, to 9-7/16 as the company prepared to announce a fixed-price software package for building e-commerce Web sites.\n\nFinally, shares of Dow member Coca-Cola (KO) jumped 2-5/16 to 64-3/16 after the world's largest soft-drink maker got a rating boost from Merrill Lynch. Merrill raised its intermediate term recommendation on the stock to \"accumulate\" from \"neutral.\"\n\n-- by staff writer Malina Poshtova Zang"
