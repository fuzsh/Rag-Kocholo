        "text": "The Bioresource and Food Processing Research Unit (BFPRU wing) at Agri-Food Discovery Place works closely with academic and private sector partners to develop new products/ingredients, and on process development and scale up of processes as required. This research unit has 1055 square meters (11,356 square feet) of area housing eight (8) specialized and specially equipped laboratories.\n\nThe BFPRU wing is equipped for applied research related to Natural Health Product development, Functional Food/Ingredients and Animal Feed research. This state-of-the-art facility includes areas for solvent processing, dry and wet extraction/separation, a sample preparation lab and food application processing.\n\nThe solvent processing lab offers a unique opportunity due to its size, versatility and design to support application work using organic solvents. Past applications have included de-fatting of oil seed extracts, extraction and separation of natural plant materials for use in the production of Natural Health Products/Ingredients using food grade ethanol and hexane.\n\nDry Processing Suite\n\nThis processing unit is equipped with two Hosakawa mills, a Buhler mill, Fitz mill, Swaco sieves with access to a particle size analyzer.\n\nWet processing Suite\n\nWork relates to solid/liquid extraction/separation of aqueous-based systems. The equipment includes various kinds of separators and clarifying centrifuges that are available for optimal processing of fibrous organic material and suspensions or slurries.\n\nKey equipment includes a hydro cyclone, decanter and disc-stack centrifuges, a spray dryer and support stainless steel tanks and centrifugal pumps.\n\nSolvent Processing Suite\n\nThe solvent processing lab is specially designed with grounding and enhanced air flow of 15 â€“ 18 full changes per hour compared to a typical lab having only 10. The lab houses two solvent extractors, a 100L rotovap, ultra-filtration, and various filters.\n\nThis equipment has electrical motors, which are intrinsically safe or pneumatic or mechanical support equipment to safe guard against organic solvent usage. The room is electrical rated as a Class I, Zone 2, and Group C &D Lab. Some refer to the classification as Class I, Division II.\n\nTo date the lab has worked on various applications of solvent extraction of active components from materials such as herbs, natural plant materials and oilseeds etc.\n\nClick here to see more..."
