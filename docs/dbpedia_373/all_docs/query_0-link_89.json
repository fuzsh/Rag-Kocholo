        "text": "TEXT: Receivers Grant Thornton, called in by National Westminster Bank, sold the four site business to Asgard (Midlands) Ltd for an undisclosed sum. The dealer is to continue to serve the same large market area surrounding Wolverhampton.\n\nAsgard, set up specifically to buy the business, comprises former Bridge Cross director Rashy Todd and a group of Midlands businessmen. All 100 jobs at the dealership have been saved by the sale and customers who have bought, but not yet received, cars have also been protected, said Grant Thornton.\n\nThe Bridge Cross business had been formed by two brothers: Rashy Todd, managing director, and sales director Shin Todd with the purchase of the Cannock dealership in 1989. A site in Stourbridge was bought in 1991, the Wolverhampton market area hub followed in 1994 and the Kidderminster satellite was taken on in 1996.\n\nAndrew Menzies, partner at Grant Thornton, said the business had been suffering from a lack of working capital for close to a year, exacerbated by the loss of finance support for used car sales from its forecourts. “This together with the difficult times that sections of the motor retail industry are going through at present played their part in the company’s demise,” he said.\n\nVolvo operations director of sales and marketing Malcolm Wade denied the crash into receivership had been a blow for the market area approach. He said: “The market area approach is very much alive, but you need to have a good capital base to fund debts. We have been very supportive.”\n\nAs part of the move to cover the debts of Bridge Cross the receivers sold its property portfolio, including industrial units in Wednesbury and a used car site in Cannock, to Bilston Properties."
