        "text": "Just as important as Buffalo’s art and architecture, music is woven into the fabric of the Queen City’s rich history. From the roots of jazz at the historic 100+ year-old Colored Musicians Club to the new local wave of young, startup indie rockers, Buffalo is quite in tune. Fostering that passion for music appreciation, these local record stores are cranking out the jams for generations, young and old, to discover new music.\n\nRevolver Records\n\nFour locations: 1451 Hertel Ave., Buffalo, NY / 831 Elmwood Ave., Buffalo, NY / 6840 Transit Rd., Williamsville, NY / 706 Main St., East Aurora, NY\n\nNow operating at four locations, Revolver Records, a music lover’s paradise stocks nearly 30,000 albums spanning over six decades of music history. The owners of this shop also take a modern approach when it comes to letting you know when the latest music has hit their shelves, posting the latest releases directly to their social media channels and with some pretty hilarious short videos.\n\nBlack Dots\n\n363 Grant St., Buffalo, NY\n\nAn independent record boutique hosting special events and a well-stocked bar, Black Dots, calls the diverse Grant Street neighborhood its home. Step through the doors and into their brand new corner space to find a record collection just as diverse as the community around it – hard to find jazz and rock album, psychedelic tunes and new pressings of modern music perfect for the young, up and coming audiophiles.\n\nDoris Records\n\n286 E. Ferry St., Buffalo, NY\n\nDoris Records’ background and role in East Buffalo is as storied and legendary as the music it sells. A young musically inclined James Johnson lived in an apartment next door and frequented the shop. That young man would grow up to become the Super Freak, Rick James.\n\nRecord Baron\n\n4587 Broadway, Depew, NY\n\nRecord Baron is the classic sort of “no frills” record store. Don’t let its unassuming size fool you, this audio heaven is packed to the gills with great tunes, both from the modern age to the classic eras. Take your time and chat with the always-friendly and knowledgable owner as you flip through through thousands of albums.\n\nBob the Record Guy\n\n6067 Transit Rd., Depew, NY\n\nThis unassuming shop on Transit Road stocks a huge wealth of vinyl, cassettes and music across all genres. What’s more, Bob the Record Guy moved into a larger setup just a couple doors down from their former space.\n\nCool Beat Music & Books\n\nClarence Flea Market, 11111 Main St., Clarence, NY (outside #364)\n\nRecently making the move from Cheektowaga to the Clarence Flea Market, books, toys, cassettes, posters and, of course, records are the name of the game at Cool Beat. Browse their wide selection and genres or get some cool cash by trading in your collection.\n\nRick’s Record Shack & Wifey’s Closet\n\n3348 Lakeshore Rd., Hamburg, NY\n\nNot only does Rick’s Record Shack have a big selection of popular and hard to find vinyl, but also gives you an opportunity to upgrade your spinning setup with vintage equipment available for purchase.\n\nHi-Fi Hits\n\n5221 Main St., Amherst, NY"
