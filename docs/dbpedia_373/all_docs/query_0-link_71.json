The undertaking includes an obligation to provide the MOF with an additional affidavit within nine months following the fiscal year end of the corporation after the date of registration or disposition as well as relevant financial statements to verify that all conditions of the exemption have been met. The \"Initial Family Business Affidavit\" is available on the MOF website identified as Form LT 100 and the follow‑up affidavit is identified as Form LT 101. The required undertaking forms part of the Initial Affidavit.\n\nTransfer of a combination of surface rights and mineral rights pursuant to Regulation 703, R.R.O. 1990\n\nWhere the value of the consideration for a conveyance includes amounts paid for the acquisition of a combination of surface rights and mineral rights, Regulation 703, R.R.O.1990 exempts from tax any consideration attributable to the acquisition of mineral rights. The deeds must be reviewed by the MOF in order to ensure that a reasonable allocation has been made towards the consideration declared for the mineral rights and the surface rights. Tax will be collected and the deeds endorsed by the MOF based on the taxable consideration determined by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of the regulation. The taxpayer or their representative should be prepared to sign an undertaking to pay any additional tax and interest should the Ministry determine that the taxable value of the consideration for the surface rights has been under‑stated.\n\nTransfer of the freehold interest in land to the person already in possession of the leasehold as provided by subsection 1(3) of the Act\n\nWhere a taxpayer has paid tax on registration of his acquisition of a leasehold interest and subsequently acquires the freehold interest in the same lands, he may apply to the MOF to reduce the taxable value of the consideration on the acquisition of the freehold by the amount of consideration on which tax was paid to acquire the leasehold.

Tax will be collected and the deeds endorsed by the MOF based on the reduced value of the consideration. If tax has been paid on the full purchase price at the Land Registry Office, application may be made to the MOF for a refund.

By definition, spouse means spouse as defined in section 29 of the Family Law Act. The Affidavit must set out that the parties are spouses as described in section 29 of the Family Law Act.

Interest continues to accrue on any tax exigible.\n\nThe undertaking also provides that an amended Affidavit will be provided where the value of the consideration has been determined to be different than that declared at registration.\n\nUndertakings will be accepted from either the transferee or their representative.\n\nSituations where a Land Transfer Tax undertaking is required at the Land Registry Office\n\nFair Market Value\n\nTentative Value of Consideration\n\nLand Registrar's Discretion\n\nAn Undertaking must be provided to the Land Registry Office by either the transferee or the transferee's representative in the following situations:\n\nFair market value. Where the value of the consideration is deemed to be equal to the fair market value of the lands, the MOF must confirm that the value is within an acceptable range.\n\nExamples of situations where fair market value applies:\n\nTransfers to corporations where part of the consideration consists of the allotment and issuance of a share or shares of the transferee corporation.\n\nTransfers from corporations to shareholders.\n\nLeases which can exceed 50 years.\n\nSome final orders of foreclosure and quit claims in lieu thereof.\n\nLand exchanges.\n\nTentative value of the consideration. Where the agreement between the parties may result in additional consideration to be given pending future events, the MOF will monitor the transaction and ensure additional tax is collected should the future conditions materialize.\n\nLand Registrar's discretion. If for any reason the Land Registrar is not satisfied with the Affidavit or supplementary affidavits, an undertaking may be required before registration as per subsection 5(4) of the Act.\n\nElectronic Registration:\n\nThe Ministry of Finance requires that an undertaking, where appropriate, will be provided to the Land Registrar before certification of title.\n\nSituations where a Land Transfer Tax undertaking is required at the Ministry of Finance\n\nAn Undertaking must be provided to the MOF by either the transferee or the transferee's representative when deeds are presented for endorsement in the following situations:\n\nFair Market Value.

However they must be accompanied by a supplementary affidavit which conforms to our guide found in Conveyances Involving Trusts. In a situation where there is a change in beneficial interest without the registration of a transfer, the matter must be dealt with through the Ministry of Finance.\n\nSituations where a supplementary affidavit may be presented to Land Registry Office without MOF endorsement:\n\na transfer from a trustee of a beneficial owner to the same beneficial owner\n\na transfer from one trustee to another trustee for the same beneficial owner, and\n\na transfer from a beneficial owner to a trustee for the same beneficial owner.\n\nAlthough the property may be subject to a mortgage, the liability for the mortgage is not part of the value of consideration as no liability is being assumed.\n\nElectronic Registration:\n\nNominal Tab:\n\nStatement 9049 ‑ 'Explanation for nominal considerations:'\n\nAND EITHER\n\nStatement 9051 ‑ 'b) trustee to trustee (evidence required to be submitted)'\n\nOR\n\nStatement 9052 ‑ 'c) beneficial owner to trustee (evidence required to be submitted)'\n\nOR\n\nStatement 9053 ‑ 'd) trustee to beneficial owner (evidence required to be submitted)'\n\n\"Evidence\" is a supplementary affidavit conforming to our \"Guide to the Requirements to Evidence NIL Value of Consideration for Conveyances Involving Trusts\" set out in Conveyances Involving Trusts.\n\nFamily trusts\n\nTax liability is the same as in 'gift' situations\n\nBeneficiaries may acquire interest in future but no change in beneficial ownership at registration\n\nThe issue of trusts gets somewhat complicated when dealing with \"family trusts\".

Since a 'gift' does not include the assumption of any liability or the conferring of any benefit of whatsoever kind on the transferor, the lands must be free and clear of any encumbrances and the transferee must not be assuming any obligations in return for the transfer. The only exception would be an inter‑spousal transfer which qualifies for an exemption under Regulation 696, RRO 1990.\n\nOne misconception is that any transfer to a relative is automatically considered a gift, however if the lands are subject to a mortgage, the transferee is considered to be assuming a liability and tax is payable based on the total of any encumbrances registered on title.\n\nIf an existing mortgage is to be discharged from the proceeds of a new mortgage or if the funds to discharge an existing mortgage are provided by the transferee, the transferee is considered to have assumed a liability and tax is calculated on the basis of the balance owing on the old mortgage.\n\nElectronic Registration:\n\nNominal Tab:\n\nStatement 9049 ‑ 'Explanation for nominal considerations;'\n\nAND EITHER\n\nStatement 9058 ‑ 'i) gift'\n\nOR\n\nStatement 9060 ‑ 'k) donation to charity'\n\nAND\n\nStatement 9048 ‑'The land is not subject to an encumbrance'\n\nEstates\n\nTransferee must be:\n\nthe named beneficiary under the terms of the will, or\n\nentitled under the Laws of Succession.\n\nTransfers involving an estate may be made pursuant to a will or to the laws of succession if there is no will. Where the transfer is pursuant to a will, the affidavit must set out that the transfer is from the estate to the named beneficiary entitled to the asset, under the terms of the will. Where there is no will, the affidavit must set out that the transferee is the sole beneficiary entitled to the asset under the laws of succession or intestacy.\n\nThe emphasis in all cases is that the transferee is the sole named beneficiary.\n\nIf the lands are subject to a mortgage, the mortgage does not form part of the consideration.\n\nElectronic Registration:\n\nNominal Tab:\n\nStatement 9049 ‑ 'Explanation for nominal considerations;'\n\nAND\n\nStatement 9050 ‑ 'a) estate to beneficiary'\n\nWhen more than one beneficiary is entitled to the lands, any agreement whereby one of the beneficiaries takes the lands in lieu of other assets in the estate, tax is payable on the value of the assets surrendered to the other beneficiaries.\n\nExample:\n\nRobert and Jennifer are the sole beneficiaries in their mother's estate, which consists of the family home worth $200,000.00 and personal property worth $200,000.00. Under their mother's will, they are each entitled to a ½ interest in all the assets. Since Jennifer wants the family home, she consents to Robert receiving an extra $100,000.00 worth of personal property in exchange for her receiving his ½ interest in the home.\n\nJennifer is exempt from tax on the ½ interest she inherited, but must pay land transfer tax on the ½ interest she received from Robert. The value of the consideration is the value of the assets Jennifer surrendered to Robert in exchange for his interest in the home ($100,000.00, value of the personal property).\n\nThe Affidavit or electronic statements should be completed as set out in examples 8‑1 and 8‑2.\n\nExample 8‑1:\n\n2.

It should be noted that the SFR apportionment can only be invoked where the lands are used for other than just residential purposes. No use is not another use. The transfer of land which has not been used and contains a residence would not be eligible for the apportionment.\n\nBy definition a SFR is any structure which was designed for the occupation of a single family as a residence. This means that even if the structure is currently uninhabitable, it is still a SFR as long as it was originally designed to be used as a residence. The zoning of the land on which the structure is situated is not a factor in determining whether the structure is a SFR.\n\nWhere an apportionment is being claimed, the Affidavit must be completed as set out in example 9‑1:\n\n(In this example, the purchase price is $1,000,000.00, the SFR is valued at $600,000.00, and the remaining lands are used for commercial purposes.)\n\nExample 9‑1:\n\n2.

An individual who has not previously owned a home cannot claim to be a \"first‑time purchaser\" if his or her spouse owned a home anywhere in the world while being the spouse of the individual.\n\nFor example: if the first‑time purchaser has a spouse who was a home‑owner, but who sold the home prior to becoming the spouse of the refund claimant, the refund claimant may apply for a refund of land transfer tax in proportion to the interest in land he or she is acquiring plus the interest acquired by the spouse, so long as the spouse is a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada. If, however, the spouse did not sell the home until after becoming the spouse of the first‑time purchaser, the first‑time purchaser is disqualified from any entitlement to the refund.\n\nFor more information on requirements to qualify for the First-Time Homebuyer refund.\n\nDocumentation required when refund is claimed at the Ministry of Finance after registration\n\nLand Transfer Tax Refund Affidavit\n\nRegistered instrument\n\nAgreement of purchase and sale (including all schedules and amendments)\n\nStatement of Adjustments\n\nDirection on whom to make the refund cheque payable\n\nAuthorizing or Cancelling a Representative form, completed by the taxpayer, if an agent for the taxpayer is requesting the refund.\n\n11 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nInter‑spousal / inter‑family\n\nWhat does \"spouse\" mean for the purposes of the Land Transfer Tax Act?\n\nFor the purposes of the Land Transfer Tax Act, \"spouse\" means spouse as defined in section 29 of the Family Law Act. At present, \"spouse\" means either of two persons who are married to each other, or who are not married to each other and who have cohabited,\n\ncontinuously for a period of not less than three years, or\n\nin a relationship of some permanence, if they are the natural or adoptive parents of a child.\n\nIs \"common‑law spouse\" an adequate statement to make on the Affidavit to qualify for a Regulation 696, R.R.O. 1990 exemption?\n\nNo. The affidavit must set out that the parties are spouses as defined under section 29 of the Family Law Act and that they qualify for exemption under Regulation 696, R.R.O. 1990.\n\nAre \"minutes of settlement\" acceptable as a written separation agreement for the purposes of Regulation 696, R.R.O. 1990?\n\nYes. Minutes of settlement are acceptable as a written agreement whereby the parties have agreed to live separate and apart.\n\nFather holds title to a property and is transferring a ½ interest to son. No cash is involved but there is a mortgage on the property. What is the land transfer tax calculated on?\n\nThe son will pay tax based on ½ of the balance owing on the mortgage.\n\nIf a parent is put on title to a son's property at the insistence of the bank, how can the parent be removed from title without incurring land transfer tax?\n\nIf the parent did not acquire a beneficial interest in the property as a result of the transfer, the Ministry will accept the fact that the parent was on title as a trustee for the son and the transfer from the parent back to the son can be accomplished with a trustee to beneficial owner affidavit.\n\nWhy does the taxpayer have to apply for the family business exemption at the Ministry of Finance as opposed to claiming the exemption at the land registry office at the time of registration?\n\nSubsection 3(2) of Regulation 697, R.R.O. 1990 requires the posting of security in the form of a special undertaking and initial family business affidavit which is followed‑up by the Ministry of Finance within 9 months of the taxation year end following the date of registration.\n\nLeases\n\nIs the Land Transfer Tax Affidavit required for a surrender/termination of lease or any other documents relating to a lease?\n\nAll documents which make reference to a specific lease must have an affidavit.\n\nIs land transfer tax payable on leases under fifty years with options to purchase?\n\nLeases which cannot exceed 50 years are not taxable, however, the granting or assigning of an option to purchase is taxable and any lease which contains such an option must set out in the affidavit the consideration, if any, being paid for the granting or assigning of the option, (but not the option exercise price), and tax is payable accordingly.\n\nRefund for first‑time homebuyers\n\nIf a parent is put on title to a son's property at the insistence of the bank, is the son eligible for the refund as long as all of the other conditions are met?\n\nIn this situation, it will be necessary to pay land transfer tax at the time of registration and apply for a refund from the Ministry of Finance. If the parent did not acquire a beneficial interest in the property as a result of the transfer, the Ministry will accept the fact that the parent was on title as a trustee for the son and the son would qualify for the first‑time homebuyer refund, provided that evidence in the form of a trust agreement is submitted.\n\nWhere the purchasers are spouses and if one spouse has owned a home but the other spouse is a first time buyer, does the first time buyer receive his/her half of the refund?\n\nWhere only spouses are involved there are no partial refunds, provided they are both Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada at the time of registration. If the one spouse did not dispose of his/her previous home before becoming the spouse of the purchaser, the refund would not apply as neither party would be considered a 'first time home purchaser'.\n\nIf the one spouse disposed of his/her previous home before becoming the spouse of the first time home purchaser, the first time home purchaser would be entitled to claim 100% of the refund even if both were named on title.\n\nWhat would be the maximum refund amount where the purchasers are spouses acquiring a 2/3 interest and a third party acquiring a 1/3 interest and the spouses are the only transferees that qualify as first time homebuyers? The registration date is January 4, 2017.\n\nWhere the first time buyers are acquiring less than a 100% interest, the refund will be calculated based on their percentage interest. Effective for registrations on or after January 1, 2017, the maximum first time homebuyer refund is $4,000.\n\nBased on the above situation, the first time homebuyers would be eligible for a maximum refund of 2/3 of $4,000.\n\nIs there a time limit to apply for the refund?\n\nThe purchaser must apply within 18 months of the date of registration or disposition.\n\nIs there an occupancy requirement?\n\nYes. The applicant must occupy the home as his/her principal residence within 9 months of the date of the conveyance or disposition.\n\nAll other refunds\n\nI have paid too much land transfer tax and now I want to get it back. How do I do that?\n\nYou may send a letter requesting a refund to the Land Taxes Section of the Ministry of Finance, PO Box 625, 33 King Street West, Oshawa, Ontario L1H 8H5 together with a photocopy of the registered deed, evidence of the tax paid at registration, a copy of the agreement of purchase and sale and an explanation of the reason for the refund request.\n\nAre there any time limits to apply for a refund of Land Transfer Tax?\n\nFirst time homebuyers of an eligible home must apply within 18 months of registration.\n\nThe refund on any tax paid on registration of a notice or caution where the transfer contemplated in the agreement referred to in the notice or caution did not take place has no time restrictions.\n\nAll other refund requests must be made within 4 years of the date of payment.\n\nSurface/mineral rights\n\nIf a conveyance includes both surface & mineral rights, does it always have to be approved by the Ministry of Finance?\n\nYes. The Minister must confirm that the taxable consideration for surface rights has been reasonably apportioned.\n\nValue of the consideration\n\nIf the transferee on a foreclosure holds a 2nd and 4th mortgage on the lands transferred, how is the taxable value of consideration calculated?\n\nThe value of consideration is equal to the lesser of:\n\nthe fair market value of the land, and\n\nthe amount owing on all encumbrances and liabilities prior in title than the second mortgage, as well as the amount owing on the second and fourth mortgages.\n\nIf the transferor is discharging a mortgage, which is still on title at the time of the transfer, is there a time frame for registering the discharge?\n\nIf the transferor is discharging the mortgage as part of the current transfer, the affidavit must confirm that the transferee is not assuming any costs in connection with the discharge or any other liability, nor is the transferee conferring any benefit on the transferor as part of the arrangement relating to the conveyance. Otherwise there is no time frame for discharging the mortgage by the transferor.\n\nIf the transferee is acquiring a 33% interest in land subject to a mortgage, does he/she pay LTT on 33% of the balance owing on the mortgage?\n\nYes, as well as on any other consideration paid or to be paid as part of the arrangement relating to the conveyance.\n\nHow do you calculate tax if the value of the consideration is in American dollars? What is the date used for conversion?\n\nAll monies must be expressed in Canadian dollars. Therefore, the Land Transfer Tax affidavit must set out the amount of the consideration in Canadian dollars. The date of conversion should be the date that the agreement of purchase and sale is accepted and becomes a binding contract or the date of registration if no agreement has been reduced to writing.\n\nCan a value be entered on the affidavit for the purpose of triggering capital gains without requiring payment of Land Transfer Tax?\n\nAny declared value of consideration appearing on the affidavit will trigger tax unless an exemption applies.\n\nHow is land transfer tax calculated on the purchase of a vacant lot which is subject to a construction contract?\n\nWhere a construction contract is entered into as part of the arrangement relating to the purchase of a vacant lot or lots, the land transfer tax would be calculated on the total cost of the lot plus the cost of construction.\n\nVesting orders\n\nIs Land Transfer Tax payable on registration of a vesting order?\n\nVesting Orders are transfers and will be treated like any other transfer. That is, the affidavit must set out the nature of the Order and the circumstances that gave rise to it as well as the value of consideration applicable to the Order.\n\nWho is the transferor in a Vesting Order?\n\nA vesting order usually has a \"plaintiff\" and a \"defendant\". Whoever is ordered to transfer the property is the transferor. The court itself is not the transferor as it does not own the lands or have an interest in the lands.\n\nWills and estates\n\nWhat is the wording required on the affidavit when the transferee is the sole beneficiary of an estate? When the transferee is not the sole beneficiary?\n\nIf the transferee is the sole beneficiary, the affidavit should set out that the transfer is from the estate to the only the named beneficiary entitled to the lands.\n\nIf the transferee is not the named beneficiary as set out in the will, the affidavit must set out the value of any consideration paid for the transfer.\n\nIf the transferee is one of the named beneficiaries, the affidavit must set out the value of any other assets of the estate the transferee may have surrendered to the other named beneficiary in return for the lands.\n\nElectronic registration\n\nWhat does \"evidence needs to be submitted\" mean?\n\nThere are certain transfers for which the Ministry of Finance requires evidence to be submitted. Evidence may be the supplementary affidavit on a trust transfer or the endorsement by the Ministry of Finance to indicate that tax is not payable or has been paid. In such cases, the registered instrument and any supplementary affidavit should be remitted to: Ministry of Finance, Land Taxes Section, 33 King Street West, Oshawa ON L1H 8H5.\n\nI am registering an inter‑spousal transfer and I have selected nominal and the spousal exemption, but I am getting an error message.\n\nIf the consideration truly is nominal, you do not need an exemption. Where you are claiming an exemption, the consideration screen needs to be completed. If you intend to register a transfer between spouses, and the only consideration is the assumption of an existing encumbrance, you must reflect the value of the mortgage being assumed in 1(b)(i) of the consideration screen. You would then select 9085 and 9086 from the exemption screen.\n\nI have a lease document whose remaining term cannot exceed 50 years, but I'm paying $100,000.00 for an option to purchase. Where do I show the $100,000.00?\n\nAssuming that $100,000.00 is the consideration for the granting or assigning of the option and not the option exercise price, complete the consideration screen to show $100,000.00 in 1(f). In \"explanations\" select 9023 and enter the following text, \"Amount shown represents value of consideration for granting of option.\""
