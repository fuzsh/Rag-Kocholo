        "text": "“We know how important it is to have our land legalized. We have been wanting to legalize our land for a long time, but we have not had the resources…. we know the value of having a DUAT for our land.”\n\n– Female, Northern Pilot Area\n\nIncreasing pressure on land in Mozambique from medium- and large-scale investments in agribusiness, extractives and infrastructure has led many individuals and communities to turn to the formal DUAT titling process to obtain documentation for their land.4 However, the process is cumbersome, time-consuming and prohibitively costly for many. The national program, Terra Segura, was initiated in 2015 with a target of 5 million DUAT titles; so far, it has produced just over 1 million titles. The process involves high application fees and time and resources to travel to the appropriate land administration offices, often on multiple occasions. At the same time, the institutional capacity of local land authorities to survey land and register DUAT title applications is limited.5 Technical problems mean that some provincial governments, such as in Zambezia, have been unable to produce titles for more than two years. As a result, the majority of land in Mozambique has remained unregistered, and customary tenure holders are invisible on official maps or land registries.\n\nThe lack of registered landholdings in Mozambique is a key source of land tenure risk. As a result, local governments and investors often fail to adequately recognize community land rights and uses, leaving both communities and investors at risk.6\n\n“At the end of the day, any conflict related to land where sugarcane is growing, it comes back to us… so we hope the project will assist us in ensuring the reputational risk to Illovo related to land conflicts is mitigated.”\n\n– Antonio Matavale, Illovo Sugar Africa Ltd.’s Risk Control Manager\n\nIn Mozambique, land disputes are relatively common in rural areas where concessions have been granted to investors.7 Insufficient accounting of community land rights and uses can impose significant costs on investors’ objectives, including costly delays, work stoppages, protests and even violence. Investors can also face supply chain risk, legal actions and suffer financial or reputational harm. Communities can be left substantially worse off as a result of decreased access to land, and local people may be much less willing to engage with the private sector in the future.8\n\n“One outcome I hope for is to see the communities protected from land grabbing. I also hope to see communities developed. Because they have land use rights certificates, they will have more financial opportunities. I also hope to see future generations having an opportunity to use the land that belonged to their ancestors.”\n\nEmanuel Malai worked as a field team supervisor, supporting the teams carrying out delimitation to ensure that the local implementers followed the agreed-upon processes and guidelines and resolved conflicts as they arose. He also supported training and communication between Illovo and the enumerators who mapped, recorded and certified land rights and worked with landholders directly.\n\nAndrew Cochrane is the Group Head of Grower Agriculture for Illovo Sugar Africa Ltd. Andrew has noted that a wide range of stakeholders in Mozambique benefitted from the partnership. The partnership provided certificates to individual landholders, whether they supplied sugarcane to Illovo or grew other crops, and supported local government stakeholders who are committed to the Government of Mozambique’s goal of certifying 5 million DUATs.\n\n“It really is beneficial, not only to you as a company to have that peace of mind that the suppliers that are supplying to us are all coming from recognized land rights, but even to the community that we’re operating in, to encourage them to invest more in their land and the equality that comes with that around registering male and female land rights as well as vulnerable people who might even lose their land rights in some other process.”\n\nThree years after the final documentation process, the company and farmers are seeing lasting benefits. For Illovo, working with farmers whose land rights are documented has decreased supply chain risks and mitigated land use conflicts with local communities. The company has found the land certificates produced through the partnership to be a helpful alternative for local farmers who have had trouble obtaining DUAT titles from the government. According to Paulo Silveira, Illovo’s Director of Agriculture for the Maragra Estate, “When we are signing contracts with cane suppliers, we need some evidence that the person has rights to use the land. The small-scale farmers can have a hard time getting this documentation. The land declarations issued under the project make us more comfortable that the farmer actually has rights to the land. The declarations are more formal, they show details of the farmer and witnesses, and a map with the location of the field.” The partnership has thus helped Illovo expand its supply base around the Maragra Estate, and improved relations with the local communities, who are grateful for the company’s help in documenting their DUAT rights.\n\n“The first thing that came to mind when I was approached about the project was, ‘I was really waiting for a project like this…The project is helping many people who were feeling that no one was looking [out] for them, no one could protect them. But they feel like they are protected now, they are safeguarded.”\n\nLurdes Armando Matlula is a female farmer living on and cultivating land surrounding the Maragra Sugar Estate. As a result of the USAID-Illovo partnership, Matlula established the boundaries of her land. Over 63 percent of certificate holders are women: the partnership helped over 1,354 women map and document their land. With more secure land rights women can increase their resilience and become more self-sufficient. It also can enhance women’s opportunities for social and economic empowerment.\n\nFarmers noted that the inclusive mapping process and issuance of land rights certificates significantly reduced threats to their land claims. Previously, many people had their land sold to third parties due to informal land tenure arrangements. This threat has diminished because now people have documents to prove their rights to the land. “The project was intended to improve people’s security of tenure, and it worked,” said Gregório Xerinda, Illovo farmer, secretary of Hluvukani Cooperative and member of ASSAM farmer association. “No one had papers, anyone else could show up and claim their land. Now people have papers, local authorities know that they have registered their land. This really improves our tenure security. There is a lot less conflict compared to before the project.” As a result, many nearby farmers are now eager to register their DUAT rights.\n\nFarmers continue to report that the land certificates they received through the project have been used to sign farming contracts with Maragra Sugar Estate. The certificates have even helped expand financial inclusion in the area. According to Jose Catarino, Illovo farmer and president of Hluvukani Cooperative and ASSAM growers association, “The document is really useful because I can show it to anyone, government or even if I’m asking for a loan, to prove that I have a field of X hectares in exactly this location.”\n\n“Mapping with the cooperative and Maragra was really important. Maragra buys our cane from those fields. Before, we couldn’t sell to them; now that we have the Declarations, we show Maragra so that they are sure that we are the actual owners and we can sign a contract. I was able to put in my cane, even as an old lady, I planted and was successful. I bought a car with the money.”\n\n– Margarida Dimande, Illovo farmer, vice president of Hluvukani Cooperative and president of Eduardo Mondlane Cooperative"
