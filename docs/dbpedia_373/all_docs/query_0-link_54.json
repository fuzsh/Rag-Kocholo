There is no other data for other parts of the state.\n\nThe data is from farm sales recorded from January 1 through June 30 of the respective years. The data includes only bare land sales. No land and building combination sales are included.\n\nThe information is from actual armâ€™s length sales reported to county authorities and collected by personnel of the University of Minnesota Extension. Sales data was not weighted for acres, each sale on a per-acre basis was averaged to get the average price paid per acre.\n\nData updated for 2023 sales in February 2024."
