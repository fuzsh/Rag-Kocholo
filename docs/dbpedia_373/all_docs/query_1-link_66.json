        "text": "Sales data for the Comparable Land Sales Database is received from Information Services Corporation (ISC) biweekly. Assessment data is provided by the Saskatchewan Assessment Management Agency (SAMA) annually. Soil Class data comes from Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC).\n\nInformation is not changed or modified in any way. The Ministry of Agriculture merges the data as received into a report. The user may choose to include any or all of the following information on their report:\n\nSale Date\n\nLegal Land Description (LLD)\n\nRural Municipality (RM)\n\nSoil Class (A,B,C with A being the highest class)\n\nSales Code (FAM = Family Sale, ARM = Arm's length Sale)\n\nAcres\n\nMunicipal Assessment (100% of the SAMA assessed value)\n\nPrice\n\nPrice/Acre\n\nThe user may sort the report by any one of the following:\n\nDate\n\nLegal Land Description (LLD)\n\nRural Municipality (RM)\n\nSoil Class (A,B,C with A being the highest class)\n\nSales Code (FAM = Family Sale, ARM = Arm's length Sale)\n\nAcres\n\nPrice\n\nAn RM search is based on the RM number or any town within that RM. An LLD search requires the user to enter the section, township, range, meridian and a search factor of one to nine miles. The LLD search will then cross RM boundaries.\n\nReports generally appear immediately, but larger searches may take a few minutes to generate.

The user may return to the original report and choose all three options. These additional formats do not incur additional charges. The report will not be saved to a user’s account after the search window has been closed.\n\nTo get an idea of the information included in the report, view this LLD Search Sample Report.\n\nRecent updates to the CLSD were carried out to improve service and comply with data privacy provisions preventing the potential misuse of vendor and purchaser information.
