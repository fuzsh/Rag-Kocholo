        "text": "Welcome to the website for the former South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). This website is no longer being updated but will be available for some time as a public service.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, DHEC became two separate agencies — the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) and the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH). Additionally, DHEC's retail food program and milk and dairy lab moved to the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. You can visit the linked agencies for your needs or visit the DHEC homepage to choose the correct agency website.\n\nWhen applying for a septic system permit, you must submit a copy of the property’s plat or deed with the application. Plats must contain property dimensions and deeds must be descriptive.\n\nTo obtain a copy of a plat or deed, contact the local Registers of Deeds office or Clerk of Court. Below is a list of counties with corresponding links to their Registers of Deeds office or Clerk of Court."
