        "text": "Synopsis\n\nBombay Dyeing has approved the sale of a land parcel in Worli, Mumbai to Goisu Realty for Rs 5200 crore. As part of the mill land policy, Bombay Dyeing surrendered eight acres of land to the BMC and Mhada. The developer will receive over 82,000 sq m of development rights in return.\n\nWadia Group entity Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company (BMDC) on Wednesday approved proposal to sell the land parcel of about 22 acres in Worli, Mumbai to Goisu Realty, a subsidiary of Japanese realty developer Sumitomo for Rs 5200 crore. This is Mumbai's largest land deal in terms of value.\n\nThe whole transaction with Sumitomo will be completed in two phases including the first tranche of Rs 4,675 crore. The balance Rs 525 crore will be received upon completion of certain conditions by BDMC and execution and consummation of the definitive agreements for the second phase.\n\nThe group has decided to monetise the land parcel to repay the debt that currently stands at Rs 3,969 crore. It has already repaid debt worth Rs 900 crore over the last one year.\n\nLast week, tempos were lined up outside Wadia International Centre (WIC), the Wadia Group headquarters. The building was being vacated and the chairman’s office was shifted to the Bombay Dyeing property at Dadar-Naigaum. Behind the Wadia headquarters, the Shilpa Shetty-owned Bastian restaurant too was shuttered.\n\nAccording to the mill land policy, Bombay Dyeing surrendered eight acres to the BMC for recreation space and another eight acres to the state housing authority, Mhada, for public housing from its Dadar-Naigaum mill. A BMC official said the developer will be entitled to transfer of development rights of over 82,000 sq m for surrendering part of its land to the BMC and Mhada. The housing authority has constructed buildings for transit accommodation and homes for mill workers on its portion.\n\nIn 2019, Goisu Realty, a unit of Japanese Sumitomo, leased a 12,141-sq m land parcel in Bandra-Kurla Complex from MMRDA for Rs 2,238 crore. And last year, the Japanese corporation bagged a tender floated by the MMRDA for two land parcels in BKC for Rs 2,067 crore.\n\nWith 886 group companies, Sumitomo Corporation is also into development and operations of office buildings, retail facilities and residences as well as logistic facilities and real estate funds.\n\nEarlier, a public notice was issued by the law firm Wadia Ghandy on behalf of its unnamed client, wanting to investigate the right, title and interest of the Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Co Ltd land measuring over one lakh sq m at Worli.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe known and unknown unknowns of Ola Electric IPO\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWarren Buffett is selling Apple shares to hold on to cash.
