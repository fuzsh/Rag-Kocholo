        "text": "Coming up on Market to Market.\n\nOppressive heat and torrential rains blanket the country, the grain belts.\n\nLand values continue to trend higher.\n\nOne stop shopping for the overall health of your operation.\n\nAnd market analysis with Sue Martin next.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nDoesn't happen by chance.\n\nIt happens when researchers and farmers work together to solve tomorrow's agronomic challenges.\n\nWe're committed to creating what's next because a pioneer.\n\nOur name is our mission.\n\nSukup manufacturing.\n\nCelebrating 60 years of innovation as a family owned and operated manufacturer of grain storage, drying and handling equipment out of Sheffield, Iowa.\n\nLearn more at Sukup.com Tomorrow, for over 100 years.\n\nWe've worked to.\n\nHelp our customers be ready for tomorrow.\n\nTrust in tomorrow.\n\nInformation is available from a Grinnell Mutual agent today.\n\nThis is the Friday, July 14th edition of Market to Market.\n\nThe weekly Journal of Rural America.\n\nHello, I'm Paul Yeager.\n\nWhile the cost of everything always seems to be on the rise, one sector of the economy held steady last month.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose 2/10 of a percent in June as everyone paid a little more for the place where they live.\n\nBut the cost of dinner at home remained the same.\n\nEven without the volatile food and energy factors, the core CPI rate increased the same amount.\n\nThe Producer Price Index an indicator of what may be down the road for retail prices, increased 1/10 of a percent over the same time period.\n\nRetailers paying more for food and alcohol led to the expansion.\n\nThe core rate, which also cuts food and energy, kept the pace with the aggregate index.\n\nMore than 100 million Americans across 15 states will spend part of the weekend under a heat advisory.\n\nDeath Valley is projected to be the hottest place on earth as temperatures top 131 degrees.\n\nThe Northeast will again be looking to the skies as more rain is in the forecast following a dramatic weekend of weather.\n\nDavid Miller has more in our weather wrap.\n\nVermont residents spent most of the week cleaning up after two months worth of rainfall that fell over two days.\n\nHigh water could be found on almost every street of downtown Montpelier, the state capitol grounds being one of the lone exceptions.\n\nThe community of 8,000 spent 48 hours worrying about the structural integrity of a dam upstream.\n\nHowever, the dam managed to hold on through the storm surge earlier in the week.\n\nThe system inundated parts of the Northeast, causing damage to this road in upstate New York.\n\nWashed the road out.\n\nCame right down here to the on ramp.\n\nWent over the corner, eroded all the dirt, took all the dirt, the big boulders.\n\nAnd it all just went into the river.\n\nThe water was so intense we found tree branches out in the middle of the bridge, which was almost 150 feet away.\n\nA couple of storms swept through the Midwest early Wednesday morning.\n\nMuch of the region from Pierre, South Dakota, to Lansing, Michigan, received significant rain later in the day.\n\nThe storms intensified as they passed through the Chicagoland area.\n\nTornado sirens sounded in downtown, but much of the damage was in Elgin, near O'Hare Airport and surrounding suburbs.\n\nMuch of the Grain Belts rainfall came after the data cutoff for this weeks Drought Monitor.\n\nImprovement nationally was recorded, but much of middle America is still locked in serious drought conditions.\n\nHighs over 100 degrees stretch from California to Florida as several consecutive days of sweltering heat have residents looking for ways to endure the oppressive temperatures.\n\nChallenges that, you know, it gets hot in the summer.\n\nThat's that's normal.\n\nBut we're now in a climate where we're more likely to to experience more severe heat more often in.\n\nIn in more parts of the country for market to market.\n\nI'm David Miller.\n\nLast year, the story for record land sales focused on the increase in new members of the $30,000 per acre club.\n\nWhile those numbers tend to skew the overall price picture.\n\nRecent surveys show the market moderating a bit.\n\nPeter Tubbs has more in this report.\n\nFarmland prices experienced a leveling off in the first half of 2023, according to Farmers National Company, a real estate and property management firm.\n\nThe first six months of the year saw a slowdown in both sales volume and value growth of farmland.\n\nNationally, fewer properties were being offered for sale and sale prices are increasing at single digit rates, compared to double digit rates common in 2021 and 2022.\n\n80% of purchases are being made by current farm operations.\n\nRising interest rates are a major factor in the slowing increases, and farm operations that purchased in the last five years may now have increased debt service.\n\nCost tightening margins for commodity farmers may also be lowering the appetite and ability to bid up prices.\n\nHigh quality agricultural land is still expected to find strong demand on the sales market.\n\nThe average cropland value in the United States has roughly doubled since 2010 from market to market.\n\nI'm Peter Tubbs.\n\nIf those in and outside of agriculture learned only one thing from the 1980s farm crisis - farmers carry many.\n\nStep one - asking for help.\n\nWhether it be financial or family, getting assistance is hard to ask for even though it may ease succession planning or keep the farm afloat.\n\nSeveral groups have stepped up to offer help - including getting all the parties to slow down, step back and get perspective on what needs to be done.\n\nPeter Tubbs has more in our Cover Story.\n\nIt came down to in the end that either we were going to make changes or we were going to have to walk away from the business.\n\nIn 2016, Brandon Brown and his wife Rebekah had reached a breaking point with the milk bottling plant they had built in partnership with Rebakahs parents on their farm outside of Courtland, New York.\n\nAs the business had grown, each household was expecting help from the other for daily tasks, and defining responsibility became a struggle.\n\nNew York FarmNet was brought in to mediate the familys disputes.\n\nAnd so farms call us for a variety of reasons.\n\nThey could call for financial guidance and coaching.\n\nThey could call us for emotional support and communication assistance and building better interpersonal relationships among the family.\n\nSo we really get a variety of phone calls throughout the year.\n\nThe first call for assistance is often difficult, and producers frequently dont understand where the problems lie.\n\nOftentimes folks call us asking for financial guidance because thats an easier question or an easier thing to ask for help for and with on a farm.\n\nSo if you know we get a call from a farmer saying they want financial coaching and analysis, but then we show up and see that, you know, the senior generation and the junior generation are fighting in the driveway.\n\nThats when our family consultants, they pick up on whats going on and theyre like, OK, theres a little bit more going on here.\n\nFarmNets financial and family consultants work as teams, bringing different skills to the situation.\n\nOur financial consultants have that farm business management.\n\nSome of them used to work in ag lending.\n\nThey used to be farmers themselves and have retired.\n\non.So we help them work through the nuts and bolts of the farm business management stuff.\n\nAnd then our family consultants help with that social, emotional, interpersonal communication work because 97% of farms in New York are family owned and operated, and many of those family farms are multiple generations working side by side.\n\nAnd thats often where there can be disagreements and challenges and pressure points.\n\nGenerational disagreements brought the Browns to their emotional limits.\n\nSo we when we first started our business, we came back to the farm from two different jobs, my wife and I.\n\nAnd from day one, we really never had anything in writing or what everybodys roles were.\n\nIt was kind of assumed, well, everybodys roles are going to be.\n\nBut, you know, as the business progressed and got bigger and we decided to do more things, you know, different roles shifted and responsibility shifted.\n\nWith help from FarmNet, they were able to sort out the details.\n\nThey got us talking and we got to really see where everybody's heads were at, like, what did everybody really want to do?\n\nSo it kind of opened up conversation and it allowed us to keep that conversation going.\n\nThe conversations allowed for a formalization of each persons role in the operation and agreements on how work across the farms would be compensated.\n\nThe improved communication allowed the Browns to expand the dairy herd and add cheese making to their Trinity Valley brand.\n\nAccording to Downes, on many farms, what might feel like financial problems are in reality communication problems.\n\nA reluctance to hand over responsibility to a younger generation can compound a farms challenges.\n\nthe family consultant picking up on those nonverbal cues can really help grease the wheels of open communication and building those interpersonal relationships and even helping the senior generation turning over the reins to the junior generation.\n\nBecause the junior generation might be in their 60s and has never written a check or made an actual business decision for the farm.\n\nBut in recent years weve actually seen more farmers, farm family members, farm employees calling us and asking directly for assistance with emotional support.\n\nAnd you know, some of those mental health challenges that everyone has gone through in the past few years.\n\nFarmNet receives over 300 calls each year seeking assistance, and can have as many as 800 open cases at any one time.\n\nThe group serves farmers in all 66 counties, including the five boroughs of New York City.\n\nBut with dairy earning nearly half of New York States agricultural receipts, its not surprising that dairy farmers form the largest share of FarmNets clientele.\n\nThe daily demands of milking cows can create a special kind of stress.\n\nEnabling families to communicate their thoughts on the operation can help a farm move forward both financially and into the next generation.\n\nSo really for us, what we love to see when a farm family, quote unquote, graduates from farm, that is a family that can have a functional business meeting you know, as in, everybody has a turn at the table and everybody gets to speak their mind and theyre allowed to speak their mind and that those generations who might be working side by side are working well together.\n\nThe renewed partnership at Trinity Valley facilitated expansion on both the dairy and packaging parts of the business.\n\nA robotic milker was added, which reduced labor costs for the farm.\n\nAn on-farm store was opened, which captures some of the retail dollars that had been going to the companys wholesale buyers.\n\nA corn maze on the farm has become both a source of tourism dollars and serve as a marketing platform for their milk and cheese products to the 10,000 visitors each fall.\n\nFor FarmNet, turnarounds like Trinity Valley are common.\n\nDownes believes their clients consistently improve their operations using the agencys consultants.\n\nIn a typical year, their group serves over 700 farm families.\n\nFarmNet also receives an additional 300 calls annually from struggling farms across the state.\n\nThe families that operate Trinity Valley see the assistance they received as invaluable.\n\nJust that little step six years ago has made all the world a difference of the health of our business and the future health of the business.\n\nFor Market to Market, Im Peter Tubbs.\n\nNext, the Market to Market report.\n\nA neutral to negative USDA report gave way to the market righting itself on a cheaper dollar, drier forecasts and rumors of renewed foreign purchases.\n\nFor the week, the nearby wheat contract A bearish reversal in soybeans was countered The August soybean contract jumped 53 cents, contract gained $0.12, while September corn expanded $0.19.\n\nA bearish reversal in soybeans was countered by rumors of Chinese buying out of the PNW.\n\nThe August soybean contract jumped $0.53 as August meal put on $21 per ton.\n\nDecember cotton bumped up a nickel per hundredweight.\n\nOver in the dairy parlor, August Class Three milk futures increased 57 cents.\n\nThe livestock market was in the green.\n\nAugust cattle put on $3.18.\n\nAugust feeders moved $1.22 higher and the August lean hog contract improved $1.05.\n\nIn the currency markets, the US dollar index dropped 236 ticks.\n\nAugust crude oil gained $1.63 per barrel.\n\nCOMEX gold added $31.90 per ounce, and the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index climbed more than 13 points to settle at 563.60 Joining us now is regular market analyst Sue Martin.\n\nHello, Sue.\n\nHello there, Paul.\n\nI see all these pictures of wheat harvest and I see these farmers saying we're finally getting into the field, sometimes four weeks behind.\n\nWhat's that doing to the wheat market right now?\n\nThat delayed harvest in spring or winter wheat?\n\nFirst the hard red winter wheat.\n\nI think that at first that was putting a little support under.\n\nBut then you keep catching rains.\n\nAnd our forecast is that they will continue to get pretty good rains.\n\nSo in Oklahoma, Kansas and up into Nebraska.\n\nSo our take is that if they continue to catch too much, it could be a quality issue.\n\nAnd hard red winter awaits the protein wheat.\n\nSo that would be a concern.\n\nBut for now, everybody's saying, hey, it's adding in more bushels.\n\nYou have to take gifts where you can.\n\nSo then when you look towards those spring contracts, you look at Minneapolis, that one has performed differently than the other two.\n\nWell, you know, the Canadian prairies certainly have their share of issues.\n\nAnd Canada competes on exports of wheat and they raise a lot of spring wheat.\n\nAnd of course, so does North Dakota.\n\nAnd the dryness is kind of trying to work its way down into North Dakota.\n\nSaskatchewan certainly is having their share.\n\nI mean, they raised their one of the major producers of wheat in Canada.\n\nAnd then you've got the western side of Manitoba also having their share of issues.\n\nAlberta is getting saved a little bit.\n\nSo the trade, it's really been watching that and focused on it.\n\nTheir forecast hasn't changed.\n\nIt calls for continued hot and dry.\n\nThat's a big concern.\n\nAnd everybody wants to talk about the drought dryness in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin.\n\nYou know, maybe on down into the northern half of Iowa.\n\nBut there's more to that weather forecast.\n\nOh, and I think you'll get to that right now when I ask about corn.\n\nThis USDA report, the negative response to the market then was replaced by a big positive bounce and were higher on the week.\n\nSo does that USDA report matter?\n\nI think they've already dialed it in.\n\nI think the trade was disappointed that the yield didn't drop more, but our guess was around 177.5 because we felt this is as of July 1st and you haven't even taken the crop into task selling pollination or what have you.\n\nSo I thought the USDA was right on, NASS was probably right on.\n\nI think the yield still comes down.\n\nBut the kicker and as I sort of just alluded to, the kicker is the weather services that we carry, we carry several different ones, but we have one that has really been pretty on target.\n\nNow, back in June, early June was talking about how we were going to turn cooler in the latter part of that last half or so of July on through August and get cooler through the fall, has done a total flip gone hot and dry.\n\nNow, some of these forecasts that you see are starting to allude that we're going to see after the 20th 24, something like that, that will start turning a little bit warmer and drier.\n\nThe forecast that I'm alluding to is talking about that this hot and dry pattern is actually going to hit the Eastern Corn Belt again.\n\nAnd estimating 77% of the Eastern Corn Belt coming back as hot and dry as they were in May and through June.\n\nSo at what point does the market reflect what you're talking about, what this weather is alluding to?\n\nAnd what do I do if I'm in that Eastern Corn Belt or if I'm in the Western Corn Belt?\n\nWell, I think they also alluded to about 28% of the Western Corn Belt.\n\nNot sure where that 28% is.\n\nIs it just west of the Mississippi?\n\nThey've had a lot of good rains or is it back towards more the western side of Iowa?\n\nThe northern part of Iowa might be that.\n\nBut I will say this.\n\nI think the trade hasn't gotten back there yet because they are so focused on Canada, the Canadian prairies, North Dakota, South Dakota, you name it.\n\nBut they'll get there before long.\n\nI would say probably about the latter part of July, they'll start realizing this is probably here to stay.\n\nAnd later, July has provided some fireworks in the past and so maybe we'll see it again.\n\nLet's move to beans here, because in the USDA report, a similar scenario in the sense of a surprise and a shock and then almost 180 the next day.\n\nSo what does that tell you?\n\nWell, I think the disappointment I think the trade was too ambitious and expecting the yield to come down again.\n\nIt's July 1st and August is bean month.\n\nAnd yes, beans are short in many areas, but beans are prolific.\n\nYou give us some rain and they can surprise you.\n\nAnd short beans can produce better than you think.\n\nHowever, again, that forecast that's coming out is a big concern because that could really hit the bean crop hard.\n\nAnd I think we could see in the August report maybe a slight cut.\n\nThe September report is the one where I think the corn and the beans really come home and have that Jesus talk.\n\nYou know, I think that and those reports in September could be very important.\n\nI think that the bean market, you know, 14 dollar beans is good price and we're having trouble getting there.\n\nWe keep pushing up to it, but our supplies are a little tight and in fact, they are tight.\n\nAlthough the USDA was creative and finding ability, they cut the crush and exports for next year.\n\nWell, maybe their mentality was, well, if you have less acres, you've got less beans.\n\nThere's only so much of it to go around.\n\nSo they cut that.\n\nBut I think when we look at this crop and it comes down with yields start to trickle down.\n\nAnd of course, if we get into August and we've been hot and dry and then we turn around and we maintain that in August, I think the bean market could be very surprising.\n\n$14.27 has been the high on November beans since December, and you'd even have to go back to maybe August or so of last year.\n\nI think the bean market is very prolific.\n\nHowever, that is the market that attracts longs easier and the corn market, we've been down to $4.81, $4.81 and three quarters.\n\nThe trade piled into a lot of shorts and got burned.\n\nAnd we have to remember, crop insurance price is $5.91.\n\nThe last three years we've been over the February base price.\n\nI don't see that happening this year.\n\nI think we'll be under it, but under it could be $5.50.\n\nYou know, who knows?\n\nI think we still have lows coming.\n\nLet's quickly summarize what you just said with a question from Phil in Ontario.\n\nAt this stage of the game, do soybeans offer more hope than corn for price appreciation moving ahead?\n\nWell, boy, I think beans are going to have to have that weather push to stay back up over the $14 area.\n\nI could see us going to $14.05, $14.08, maybe $14.14, something like that.\n\nBut I think we have to have that weather push.\n\nAnd right now we have Brazil's beans kind of stealing our thunder and yet export sales and shipments are still pretty good.\n\nSo we're doing okay there.\n\nI think that the one thing I view is as we go into '‘24 is that I think we're going to draw more bean acres back and we're going to lose corn acres.\n\nAnd maybe price does something with that, I don't think.\n\nAnd here's the other thing, crop insurance, soybeans were actually below the crop insurance base last year.\n\nContrary to corn.\n\nSo, you know, does that mean it has to stay below?\n\nNo.\n\nBeans could be the surprising thing.\n\nBut we may be push up over $14.\n\nYou know, here's another thing.\n\nI have indicators that I watch very closely.\n\nThey've served me well.\n\nAnd those things on monthly data are turned long on half of them.\n\nAnd the other half is just sitting there waiting for a nudge.\n\nAnd I think that's going to come.\n\nAnd when that does, that tells me and corn is not far behind it either.\n\nThat tells me that these prices, maybe we make some lows here in August.\n\nI thought corn could make a low in August, some think early to maybe mid-August.\n\nI was thinking more like around August 23rd, 29th, something like that.\n\nAnd then we start to work our way around a meander.\n\nAll right.\n\nI need to get to livestock very quickly for a few seconds.\n\nBox beef just had a some pullback, but yet we rallied to a near contract high.\n\nWhat's the nudge in cattle moving forward?\n\nIs it a nudge higher or lower?\n\nI think it's still back lower.\n\nI think what we're in is a cattle market that is volatile and it's whipping back and forth.\n\nOne good example was this week when you had corn down off that report, like 20 some cents or more and feeder cattle dropped.\n\nAnd I thought, wait a minute, that's not a good thing.\n\nI think the market is whipping and you're seeing and I think it'll continue to whip while the product continues to drop.\n\nAnd I think we'll do that into August.\n\nThat would be a friendly situation for the longer term on this cattle market.\n\nIf we rally with new highs in the fats and feeders too, whatever, into August, that's usually not a good sign into October or November.\n\nBut I tell you, the numbers, we have a decent supply of numbers right now.\n\nHere's the thing that's going to hit that cattle.\n\n10 seconds to say.\n\nOkay, if the rains fix the, you know, help out the pastures and this winter we see the whole batch of heifer's for heifer retention, for breeding, and that's what sends that market flying.\n\nAll right.\n\nWe'll get you some more predictions in a moment.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you, Sue Martin.\n\nHere, we're going to pause this analysis, continue our discussion about these markets in our Market.\n\nPlus, you can find both analysis and plus on
