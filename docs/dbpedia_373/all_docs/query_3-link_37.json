Guess everyone has to make a little money! Sorry PA guys, don't know what to tell you. Unfortunately none of us can change anything about land prices, just nature of the beast fellas.

In the areas where there is gas and oil drilling and fracking are they including mineral rights in these very pricey sales? Or is that some of the reason the price per acre is so much. I actually don't know if where they are drilling there is good ag land or not.\n\nPaMike Discussion starter\n\n2385 posts ·\n\n#18 ·\n\nThis land that sold has no minerals/gas on it. That is all up in northern pa. We do still have a strong Ag Preservation program here that will pay around $3,000/acre for the development rights. So that will get back at most around $240,000. But that is if you are a top rated farm, which these weren't. Also, you have to get on a waiting list. They could apply now and not get into the program for years...\n\n10300 posts ·\n\n#19 ·\n\nA lot of the farms around here are being bought with \"old money\".

Just had my house appraised and the appraiser was questioning me about land prices. I personally thought $2000 was on the low side but it's not. Granted the quality lacks. Most is wet needs tiled. Very little high quality gravel and if your lucky to have it you won't ever let it go.\n\nPaMike Discussion starter\n\n2385 posts ·\n\n#22 ·\n\nNot trying to lecture you or anything, but try to take the high road and patch things up.

Mom and Dad were very reasonable the rest wanted appraised value . We were mad they got them for free and wanted full price . My old man said sign the agreement of sale, on all 4 farms asap or you will never farm there again. I was jealous cause I had to pay for what my uncles and aunts got for free , We were young my wife was worried about the debt she would cry at nite after she put the kids to bed . We worked hard got it paid in 20 years. Also 3 years after we owned it ,it was worth 5 times more than we paid for it. I am so glad we bought it most times you only get the chance once\n\n15158 posts ·\n\n#24 ·\n\nI know the situation well.....a good neighbor was dying with cancer and came to me and said, \" you and your father meet with me\"...we did and he said he wanted $400,000 for his farm...this was back in the nineties. I just could not see any way it would pencil....we declined. It sold at auction for about 500,000....then less than ten years its value went up 600%. I regretted it.....but the moral of my story is that if you can anyway possibly buy land....do it....it will more than increase in value....the first half of the annual payment terms may be a struggle but the second half of the terms will be much, much easier.\n\nSo, getting something to \"PENCIL\" is much more involved than financially meeting payments....it also must include the ability to see LONG TERM......it is called VISION.\n\nHe who has young ears, let him listen.\n\nRegards, Mike\n\n10300 posts ·\n\n#25 ·\n\nI know the situation well.....a good neighbor was dying with cancer and came to me and said, \" you and your father meet with me\"...we did and he said he wanted $400,000 for his farm back in the nineties.

Land cannot be valued unless you value it for its highest and best use. Farming isn't always the highest and best use for land.\n\nI would think it would be smart to buy say 150 acres. Set 100 aside for farming, then sell 50 off to a developer or for commercial highway frontage, etc. to help offset initial costs.\n\nAs Mike said, you have to pencil in future value.\n\nThe classic timeline in MY area is that farmers with children disinterested in farming will dies off, leave the land to the kids, kids sell land to developers for 3-5 million bucks and become over note millionaires."
