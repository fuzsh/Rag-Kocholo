        "text": "The appeal of Stratford as a residential location has been underlined by a record land deal achieved despite the recession.\n\nProperty company Earlplace, based near Solihull, bought a site in Scholars Lane from the NFU Mutual in September 2008, which it wanted to develop as a care home for the elderly.\n\nIt won planning consent for a 63-bed home from Stratford District Council in April but decided to sell the site to a care home operator.\n\nNow Surrey-based Restful Homes has paid £1.5 million for the site and is expected to start work later this year.\n\nLawrence Grove, managing director of Earlplace, said the deal was a record outside London.\n\nHe said: “We acted for ourselves in this transaction but have been told by property experts in the care home field that it was a record for a site outside London taking into account the size of the home which will be created.\n\nShow more\n\n“It says something not only about the site but also about the desirability of Stratford as a place to live, that this can be achieved at a time when funding for such projects is very hard to come by.\n\n“We financed the deal ourselves, without help from the banks, and several major operators in the care home field were interested but could not raise the finance.\n\n“Restful Homes were keen to establish in the area and the deal went extremely smoothly.”"
