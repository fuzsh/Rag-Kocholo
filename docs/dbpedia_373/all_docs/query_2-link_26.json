        "text": "Most states have unique rules about embalming, burial or cremation, scattering ashes, and how to get a death certificate. Here are some answers to common questions about post-death matters in Michigan.\n\nHow do I get a death certificate in Michigan?\n\nWho can order a death certificate in Michigan?\n\nIn Michigan, who completes the death certificate?\n\nIs embalming required in Michigan?\n\nIn Michigan, is a casket necessary for burial or cremation?\n\nIn Michigan, do I have to buy a casket from the funeral home?\n\nWhere can bodies be buried in Michigan?\n\nWhere can we store or scatter ashes after cremation in Michigan?\n\nHow do I get a death certificate in Michigan?\n\nIn Michigan, a funeral director is required to file a death certificate with the local registrar within 72 hours of the death. (Mich. Comp. Laws § 333.2843.) You may need to obtain copies of a death certificate for a number of reasons. You might simply want a copy for your personal records or, if you are in charge of wrapping up the deceased person's affairs, you may require multiple official copies to carry out your job. For example, you will need to submit a certified copy of the death certificate each time you claim property or benefits that belonged to the deceased person, including life insurance proceeds, Social Security benefits, payable on death accounts, veterans benefits, and many others.\n\nThe easiest way to get copies of a death certificate is to ask the person or organization that files the certificate (for example, the funeral home) to order them for you at the time of the death. If you're the executor of the estate, you should ask for at least 10 certified copies.\n\nIf you need to order copies of a death certificate after some time has passed, visit the Michigan Department of Community Health. From there, you'll find instructions for ordering death certificates online, by phone, in person, or using a downloadable mail-in form.\n\nThe first certified copy of a Michigan death certificate costs $34; additional copies cost $16 each. Extra fees are imposed for online processing and rush requests.\n\nWho can order a death certificate in Michigan?\n\nUnlike in most states, death certificates are not restricted records in Michigan. There are no rules about who may order certified copies, and no ID is required.\n\nIn Michigan, who completes the death certificate?\n\nThe funeral director completes the death certificate with input from the next of kin and medical professionals. The funeral director collects personal information about the deceased person from the next of kin. The funeral director also obtains the medical certification (cause of death) from one of the following individuals:\n\nthe attending physician if the death occurred in an institution or if an attending physician was present at the time of death\n\nthe county medical examiner if the attending physician is not available or if the death was due to reasons other than natural causes, or\n\nthe county health officer or deputy county medical examiner if the attending physician and county medical examiner aren't available.\n\nThe attending physician or other official must provide the medical certification within 48 hours of death, and the funeral director must file the death certificate with the local registrar within 72 hours. (Mich. Comp. Laws § 333.2843.)\n\nIs embalming required in Michigan?\n\nEmbalming is a process in which blood is drained from the body and replaced with fluids that delay disintegration. Though it is still a common procedure, embalming is rarely necessary; refrigeration serves the same purpose.\n\nIn Michigan, embalming is not required except in limited circumstances. For example, if a body is not buried or cremated within 48 hours, embalming may be required for transportation purposes. Embalming is also required if the death was due to certain rare, communicable diseases. (See Mich. Admin. Health Code R 325.1 and R 325.2.)\n\nHowever, despite that it's not required by law, many funeral homes still require embalming as part of their own policies. (See Michigan-Specific FAQs Regarding Information Pertaining to After Death Care and Disposition.)\n\nIn Michigan, is a casket necessary for burial or cremation?\n\nA casket is often the single greatest expense incurred after a death. The average cost of a casket is more than $2,000, and the price can run into the $10,000-$20,000 range for more elaborate designs and expensive materials. Whether due to the cost or for other reasons, some people prefer to forgo a casket altogether.\n\nBurial. No law requires a casket for burial. However, you should check with the cemetery; it may have rules requiring a certain type of container.\n\nCremation. No law requires a casket for cremation. On the contrary, federal law requires a funeral home or crematory to inform you that you may use an alternative container, and to make such containers available to you. An alternative container may be made of unfinished wood, pressed wood, fiberboard, or cardboard.\n\nIn Michigan, do I have to buy a casket from the funeral home?\n\nNo. Although funeral homes may sometimes be very pushy about getting you to buy caskets from them, federal law requires funeral homes to accept caskets that consumers have purchased from another source, such as an online retailer. (Learn more about your consumer rights under the FTC Funeral Rule.) You may also build your own casket, if you prefer.\n\nWhere can bodies be buried in Michigan?\n\nMost bodies are buried in established cemeteries, but burial on private property is sometimes possible in Michigan. Michigan state law allows for the creation of private burial grounds of less than an acre outside city or village limits. (Mich. Comp. Laws § 128.111.) The property must be surveyed and recorded with the county clerk; it will then be exempt from taxation. (See Mich. Comp. Laws § 128.112.)\n\nBefore conducting a home burial or establishing a family cemetery, you will need zoning approval and a permit from the local health department.\n\nWhere can we store or scatter ashes after cremation in Michigan?\n\nIn Michigan, there are no state laws controlling where you may keep or scatter ashes. Ashes may be stored in a crypt, niche, grave, or container at home. If you wish to scatter ashes, you have many options. Generally, use common sense and refrain from scattering ashes in places where they would be obvious to others.\n\nScattering ashes in an established scattering garden. Many cemeteries provide gardens for scattering ashes. If you're interested, ask the cemetery for more information.\n\nScattering ashes on private land. You are allowed to scatter ashes on your own private property. If you want to scatter ashes on someone else's private land, it's wise to get permission from the landowner.\n\nScattering ashes on public land. You may wish to check both city and county regulations and zoning rules before scattering ashes on local public land, such as in a city park. However, many people simply proceed as they wish, letting their best judgment be their guide.\n\nScattering ashes on federal land. Officially, you should request permission before scattering ashes on federal land. As with local or state land, however, you will probably encounter no resistance if you conduct the scattering ceremony quietly and keep the ashes well away from trails, roads, facilities, developed areas, campsites, and waterways. You can find guidelines for scattering ashes on the websites for some national parks. For more information, begin your search at the website of the National Park Service.\n\nScattering ashes at sea. The federal Clean Water Act requires that cremated remains be scattered at least three nautical miles from land. If the container will not easily decompose, you must dispose of it separately. The EPA does not permit scattering at beaches or in wading pools by the sea. Finally, you must notify the EPA within 30 days of scattering ashes at sea.\n\nThe Clean Water Act also governs scattering in inland waters such as rivers or lakes. For inland water burial, you may be legally required to obtain a permit from the state agency that manages the waterway.\n\nFor more information, see the EPA's page on Burial at Sea.\n\nScattering ashes by air. While there are no state laws on the matter, federal aviation laws do prohibit dropping any objects that might harm people or property. The U.S. government does not consider cremains to be hazardous material; all should be well so long as you remove the ashes from their container before scattering.\n\nMore Resources\n\nTo learn about the federal rule on funerals, which protects consumers in all states, visit the FTC's Funeral Rule page.\n\nFor more information about funeral laws in Michigan, see Michigan Home Funeral Laws.\n\nTo find out more about funerals and other final arrangements, see Nolo's section on Getting Your Affairs in Order."
