        "text": "The real estate industry may see some large land deals these days, from the $450 million Witanhurst mansion in London to the $2 billion Antilla building in Mumbai, but these pale in comparison to some historical land deals.\n\nThree of the largest land deals were parts of the history of North and South America, particularly that of the United States. These were the Alaskan Purchase in 1867, the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494.\n\nThe Alaskan Purchase\n\nThe U.S. purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 is considered to be one of the largest land deals in history. Fearing another war with Britain after the Crimean War, Russia rushed to sell Alaska to the United States for just $7.2 million, or about two cents per acre, to prevent nearby British Columbia from taking over the territory. This deal was also intended to bolster Russia's struggling finances.\n\nToday, Alaska is worth much more than that, even accounting for inflation. The state encompasses 586,412 square miles, or more than 375 million acres. Even at a cost of just $100 per acre, that would equate to more than $37 billion. As an additional benefit, the state of Alaska produces hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil each year.\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803 is another U.S. acquisition that's one of the largest recorded land deals in history. With a purchase price of just $15 million, the U.S. added some 13 states' worth of territories at just under three cents per acre.\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase almost didn't happen for a couple of reasons. First, President Thomas Jefferson was widely criticized for acting above and beyond his constitutional authority by authorizing the deal, especially given his strict interpretation of the Constitution. Second, many Federalists worried that the U.S. was funding a war against Spain by buying from Napoleon.\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase encompassed 827,000 square miles, which equates to approximately 512 million acres. With land costs today averaging between $1.480 and $4,420 per acre in the continental U.S. in 2021, the total value of the Louisiana Purchase is therefore likely to be near $2.2 trillion. This doesn't take into account the benefits of an expanded country in geographical location, resources, labor, human capital, and more.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas\n\nBack in the 1400s and 1500s, Spain and Portugal were the world's two largest superpowers carving up the world. The European arrival to the New World, led by Christopher Columbus in 1492, generated many disputes about who had rights to certain territories. In 1494, the two countries agreed to divide the world along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cabo Verde islands.\n\nUnfortunately, the New World turned out to move mostly west in direction and the deal turned out to be rather one-sided. Spain ended up colonizing the vast majority of South America except for present-day Brazil, where Portuguese is still spoken. After 1898, the treaty became somewhat obsolete as the two world superpowers grew less influential.\n\nWhile the total value of this deal is impossible to calculate, the control Spain maintained over most of Latin America played an important role in history. The majority of the countries in the region asserted their independence in the early to mid-1800s. By the 1900s, some Latin American countries were participating in the World Wars as U.S. allies.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThree of the largest recorded land deals were in North and South America. The first was in 1494, when the Treaty of Tordesillas divided up the New World between Spain and Portugal, putting the majority of South America under Spanish control.\n\nTwo other of the largest land deals were major parts of U.S. history. These were Russia's sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867 for two cents per acre and France's sale of the Louisana Purchase to the U.S. in 1803 for less than three cents per acre.\n\nThese three land deals shaped the growth and development of many countries in modern North and South America, and the cultural and economic impacts of them can be felt today."
