        "text": "Multicellular organisms need specialized systems\n\nMost cells in large multicellular organisms don't directly exchange substances like nutrients and wastes with the external environment, instead, they are surrounded by an internal environment of extracellular fluid—literally, fluid outside of cells. The cells get oxygen and nutrients from this extracellular fluid and release waste products into it. Humans and other complex organisms have specialized systems that maintain the internal environment, keeping it steady and able to provide for the needs of the cells.\n\nDifferent systems of the body carry out different functions. For example, your digestive system is responsible for taking in and processing food, while your respiratory system—working with your circulatory system—is responsible for taking up oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide. The muscular and skeletal systems are crucial for movement; the reproductive system handles reproduction; and the excretory system gets rid of metabolic waste.\n\nBecause of their specialization, these different systems are dependent on each other. The cells that make up the digestive, muscular, skeletal, reproductive, and excretory systems all need oxygen from the respiratory system to function, and the cells of the respiratory system—as well as all the other systems—need nutrients and must get rid of metabolic wastes. All the systems of the body work together to keep an organism up and running.\n\nTypes of tissues\n\nAs we saw above, every organ is made up of two or more tissues, groups of similar cells that work together to perform a specific task. Humans—and other large multicellular animals—are made up of four basic tissue types: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue.\n\nEpithelial tissue\n\nEpithelial tissue consists of tightly packed sheets of cells that cover surfaces—including the outside of the body—and line body cavities. For instance, the outer layer of your skin is an epithelial tissue, and so is the lining of your small intestine.\n\nEpithelial cells are polarized, meaning that they have a top and a bottom side. The apical, top, side of an epithelial cell faces the inside of a cavity or the outside of a structure and is usually exposed to fluid or air. The basal, bottom, side faces the underlying cells. For instance, the apical sides of intestinal cells have finger-like structures that increase surface area for absorbing nutrients.\n\nEpithelial cells are tightly packed, and this lets them act as barriers to the movement of fluids and potentially harmful microbes. Often, the cells are joined by specialized junctions that hold them tightly together to reduce leaks.\n\nConnective tissue\n\nConnective tissue consists of cells suspended in an extracellular matrix. In most cases, the matrix is made up of protein fibers like collagen and fibrin in a solid, liquid, or jellylike ground substance. Connective tissue supports and, as the name suggests, connects other tissues.\n\nLoose connective tissue, show below, is the most common type of connective tissue. It's found throughout your body, and it supports organs and blood vessels and links epithelial tissues to the muscles underneath. Dense, or fibrous, connective tissue is found in tendons and ligaments, which connect muscles to bones and bones to each other, respectively.\n\nSpecialized forms of connective tissue include adipose tissue—body fat—bone, cartilage, and blood, in which the extracellular matrix is a liquid called plasma.\n\nMuscle tissue\n\nMuscle tissue is essential for keeping the body upright, allowing it to move, and even pumping blood and pushing food through the digestive tract.\n\nMuscle cells, often called muscle fibers, contain the proteins actin and myosin, which allow them to contract. There are three main types of muscle: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.\n\nSkeletal muscle, which is also called striated—striped—muscle, is what we refer to as muscle in everyday life. Skeletal muscle is attached to bones by tendons, and it allows you to consciously control your movements. For instance, the quads in your legs or biceps in your arms are skeletal muscle.\n\nCardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, or striped. But it's not under voluntary control, so—thankfully!—you don’t need to think about making your heart beat. The individual fibers are connected by structures called intercalated disks, which allow them to contract in sync.\n\nSmooth muscle is found in the walls of blood vessels, as well as in the walls of the digestive tract, the uterus, the urinary bladder, and various other internal structures. Smooth muscle is not striped, striated, and it's involuntary, not under conscious control. That means you don't have to think about moving food through your digestive tract!\n\nNervous tissue\n\nNervous tissue is involved in sensing stimuli—external or internal cues—and processing and transmitting information. It consists of two main types of cells: neurons, or nerve cells, and glia.\n\nThe neurons are the basic functional unit of the nervous system. They generate electrical signals called conducted nerve impulses or action potentials that allow the neurons to convey information very rapidly across long distances. The glia mainly act to support neuronal function.\n\nOrgans in a system work together.\n\nJust like workers on an assembly line, the organs of an organ system must work together for the system to function as a whole. For instance, the function of the digestive system—taking in food, breaking it down into molecules small enough to be absorbed, absorbing it, and eliminating undigested waste products—depends on each successive organ doing its individual job.3,4‍\n\nDigestion is the breakdown of food so that its nutrients can be absorbed. It includes both mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. In mechanical digestion, chunks of food are broken into smaller pieces. In chemical digestion, large molecules like proteins and starches are broken into simpler units that can be readily absorbed.\n\nMechanical digestion, along with some initial chemical digestion, takes place in the mouth and stomach. Chewing breaks food into smaller pieces, and the stomach churns the food up into a fluid mixture. The stomach also acts as a storage tank, releasing partially digested food into the small intestine at a rate the small intestine can handle.4‍\n\nThe small intestine is the major site of chemical digestion, which is carried out by enzymes released from the pancreas and liver. The small intestine is also the main site of nutrient absorption; molecules like sugars and amino acids are taken up by cells and transported into the bloodstream for use.\n\nThe mouth, stomach, small intestine, and other digestive system organs work together to make digesting food and absorbing nutrients efficient. Digestion wouldn’t so work well if your stomach stopped churning or if one of your enzyme-producing glands—like the pancreas—decided to take the day off!"
