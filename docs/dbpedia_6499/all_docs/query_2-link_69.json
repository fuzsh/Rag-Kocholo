        "text": "1. Tissue Level of Organization By Yogeshwary M. Bhongade Assistant Professor Kamla Neharu College of Pharmacy, Butibori, Nagpur\n\n2. Tissues • Tissues are groups of similar cells that have a common function. • The four basic tissue types are epithelial, muscle, connective, and nervous tissue. Each tissue type has a characteristic role in the body: Tissue Epithelial Tissue Covers the bodysurface and lines bodycavities Connective Tissue Supports and protects body organs. MuscularTissue Provides movement. Nervous Tissue Provides a means of rapid internal communication by transmitting electrical impulses\n\n3. Epithelial Tissue • It is made up of tightly opposed cells • They form the covering or lining to the free surface of the body • Rest on basement membrane • Seperate epithelial tissues from other tissues Epithelial Tissue Membranous Epithelium Glandular tissues\n\n4. Functions of the Epithelium • Epithelia tissue forms boundaries between different environments, and nearly all substances must pass through the epithelium. In its role as an interface tissue, epithelium accomplishes many functions, including: • Covers the body surface and lines body cavities (Pericardial, Peritonial, Plural Cavitiesand Cardiovasculat System also tined by epithelial tissues. Body tubes are lined by epithelial tissues) • Protection for the underlying tissues from radiation, desiccation, toxins, and physical trauma. • Absorption of substances in the digestive tract lining with distinct modifications. • Regulation and excretion of chemicals between the underlying tissues and the body cavity. • The secretion of hormones into the blood vascular system. The secretion of sweat, mucus, enzymes, and other products that are delivered by ducts come from the glandular epithelium. • The detection of sensation.\n\n5. Characteristics of Epithelial Layers • Epithelial tissue is composed of cells laid out in sheets with strong cell-to- cell attachments. • These protein connections hold the cells together to form a tightly connected layer that is avascular but innervated in nature. • The epithelial cells are nourished by substances diffusing from blood vessels in the underlying connective tissue. • One side of the epithelial cell is oriented towards the surface of the tissue, body cavity, or external environment and the other surface is joined to a basement membrane. • The basement layer is non-cellular in nature and helps to cement the epithelial tissue to the underlying structures.\n\n6. Epithelial Tissue • Epithelial tissues are identified by both the number of layers and the shape of the cells in the upper layers. • There are eight basic types of epithelium: six of them are identified based on both the number of cells and their shape; two of them are named by the type of cell (squamous) found in them. • Epithelial tissue is classified based on the number of cells, the shape of those cells, and the types of those cells.\n\n7. Types Of Epithelial Tissues Membranous Epithelium Shape Squamous Cuboial Columnar Layers Simple Epithelium Simple Squamous Simple Cuboial Simple Columnar Stratified Epithelium Stratified Squamous Stratified Cuboial Stratified Columnar Psudostratifies Epithelium\n\n8. Types of Simple Epithelial Tissue 1. A simple squamous epithelium - • It is a single layer of flat cells in contact with the basal lamina (one of the two layers of the basement membrane) of the epithelium. • This type of epithelium is often permeable and occurs where small molecules need to pass quickly through membranes via filtration or diffusion. • Flat, nucleous located near the upper surface gives these cells appearance of fried egg. • Found in CVS, Respiratory System, Kidney(Nephron)\n\n9. 2. Simple cuboidal epithelium • It consists of a single layer cells that are as tall as they are wide. The important functions of the simple cuboidal epithelium are secretion and absorption. • This epithelial type is found in the small collecting ducts of the kidneys, pancreas, and salivary glands, surface of ovaries. • They are cube or hexagone shape with central, round nucleus. • These cells produces secretions (Secretions) or absorb substances (digestive fluid)\n\n10. 3. Simple columnar epithelium- • It consist of a single layer of cells that are taller than they are wide. • This type of epithelia lines the small intestine where it absorbs nutrients from the lumen of the intestine. • Simple columnar epithelia are also located in the stomach where it secretes acid, digestive enzymes and mucous. • Tall with an oval nucleous near the basement membrane.\n\n11. Types of Stratified Epithelial Tissue 1. A stratified squamous epithelium- • It consists of squamous (flattened) epithelial cells arranged in layers upon a basal membrane. • Only one layer is in contact with the basement membrane; the other layers adhere to one another to maintain structural integrity. • In the deeper layers, the cells may be columnar or cuboidal. • Found in Oral Cavity, Vagina and oesophagous.\n\n12. 2. Stratified cuboidal epithelial Tissue • It is a rare type of epithelial tissue composed of cuboidally shaped cells arranged in multiple layers. • They protect areas such as ducts of sweat glands, mammary glands, and salivary glands.\n\n13. 3. Stratified Columnar epithelial Tissue • Stratified columnar epithelium is a rare type of epithelial tissue composed of column-shaped cells arranged in multiple layers. • It is found in the conjunctiva, pharynx, anus, and male urethra.\n\n14. Transitional epithelium • Transitional epithelium is a type of stratified epithelium. • This tissue consists of multiple layers of epithelial cells which can contract and expand in order to adapt to the degree of distension needed. • Transitional epithelium lines the organs of the urinary system and is known here as urothelium.\n\n15. Glandular tissues • The glandular tissue are a mixture of both endocrine (ductless, hormones are secreted into the blood) and exocrine (have ducts, hormones are secreted onto surfaces) glands. • The exocrine glands are covered in the respective topics. For example sweat glands are covered in the section on skin. Glandular tissues Unicellular Multicellular Endocrine Gland Exocrine Gland\n\n16. Connective tissue • Connective tissue is the tissue that connects, separates and supports all other types of tissues in the body. • Like all tissue types, it consists of cells surrounded by a compartment of fluid called the extracellular matrix (ECM). • Connective tissue, group of tissues in the body that maintain the form of the body and its organs and provide cohesion and internal support. • The connective tissues include several types of fibrous tissue that vary only in their density and cellularity, as well as the more specialized and recognizable variants—bone, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and adipose (fat) tissue.\n\n17. Functions of Connective Tissue • Bind togather, support and strenthen body tissue • Protect and insulate internal organ. • Transport. • Store energy in addipose or fat tissue • Immune response\n\n18. Types of connective tissue Connective tissue Cell Ground Substances Fluid\n\n19. Cells Connective Tissue Fibroblast Macrophages Plasma cells Mast cell Adipocytes Leukocytes\n\n20. Ground Substances • Present between cell and fibre • It is in the form of fluid, semifluid or gelateneous or calcified • Support cell and bind them togather • Store wathe and organic substances given below. Connective Tissue Polysachharides Hyaluronic Acid Chondroitin Sulphate Dermatan Sulphate Keratin Sulphate Proteins Adhesive protein- Fibronectin\n\n21. Muscle Tissue • Muscle tissue is a specialized tissue found in animals which functions by contracting, thereby applying forces to different parts of the body. • Muscle tissue consists of fibers of muscle cells connected together in sheets and fibers.\n\n22. Function of Muscle Tissue • Muscle tissue functions as a single unit, and is often connected to the same nerve bundles. A nerve impulse traveling from the brain or another outside signal tells the muscle to contract. The nerve impulse is transferred almost instantaneously to all the nerve cells in the muscle tissue, and the entire muscle contracts. • At the cellular level, each muscle cell has a complex of proteins containing actin and myosin. These proteins slide past one another when the signal to contract is received. • The filaments are connected to the ends of the cells, and as they slide past one another, the cell contracts in length. A single cell can contract up to 70% in length, which shortens the entire muscle when contraction happens. Muscle tissue can be used to move bones, compress chambers, or squeeze various organs.\n\n23. Types of Muscle Tissue Skeletal Muscle Tissue • Skeletal muscle tissue is a type of striated muscle, meaning clear bands can be seen in it under a microscope. • These tiny light and dark bands are sarcomeres, highly organized bundles of actin, myosin, and associated proteins. • These organized bundles allow striated muscle to contract quickly and release quickly. Muscle tissue is attached to the bones through tendons, which are highly elastic portions of connective tissue. Many muscles may seem to control a single appendage, but in reality each one only controls one small aspect of movement. Skeletal muscle tissue can be controlled voluntarily, by the somatic nervous system. The other types of muscle are controlled mainly by the involuntary or autonomous nervous system.\n\n24. Cardiac Muscle Tissue • While the striations in skeletal muscle tissue are even and parallel, complex and branching striations are seen in cardiac muscle tissue. • While the striations are hard to see in this image, the branching nature of the cells is easy to pick out. • The branching is caused by the connection of cardiac muscle cells to one another. The cells are connected via intercalated discs. These junctures help cardiac muscle to contract as one and provide a rapid and coordinated contraction to move blood.\n\n25. Smooth Muscle Tissue • Unlike cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue, smooth muscle tissue has no striations. The fibers of myosin and actin in smooth muscle fiber is not nearly as organized as in the other types of muscle tissue. In smooth muscle, the contractions are not quick and rapid but rather smooth and continuous. Smooth muscle is found surrounding many organs, blood vessels, and other vessels used for transporting fluids. The smooth muscle can contract to apply a force on organ. This can be used to move blood or food throughout their respective systems. Smooth muscle is recognizable from its lack of striations and unbranching nature in image (b) below."
