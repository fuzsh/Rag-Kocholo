        "text": "Solution\n\nVerified by Toppr\n\nTransitional epithelium is a compound epithelium, which lines the inner surface of the urinary bladder, ureter etc. It has a single layer of the cuboidal cell at the base, two to three middle layers of a large polygonal or pear-shaped cells and a superficial layer of large, broad, rectangular or oval cells. This epithelium prevents loss of water by reabsorption and allows considerable expansion of the organs by flattening and stretching to accommodate urine.\n\nThe epithelium contains many intimate and delicate connections to neural and connective tissue. These connections allow for communication to tell the cells to expand or contract. The superficial layer of transitional epithelium is connected to the basal layer via cellular projections, such as intermediate filaments protruding from the cellular membrane."
