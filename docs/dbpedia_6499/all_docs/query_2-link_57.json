        "text": "Cellular Events in Maturation\n\nThe major changes involved in cell maturation in keratinized and nonkeratinized oral epithelium are presented in Figure 12-10 and Table 12-1. In both types of epithelia the changes in cell size and shape are accompanied by a synthesis of more structural protein in the form of tonofilaments, the appearance of new organelles, and the production of additional intercellular material. A number of changes, however, are not common in both epithelia and serve as distinguishing features. One is in the arrangement of tonofilaments. The cells of both epithelia increase in size as they migrate from the basal to the prickle cell layer, but this increase is greater in nonkeratinized epithelium. A corresponding synthesis of tonofilaments also occurs in both epithelia, but whereas the tonofilaments in keratinized epithelium are aggregated into bundles to form tonofibrils, those in nonkeratinized epithelium remain dispersed and so appear less conspicuous (Figure 12-11). The chemical structure of keratin filaments also is known to differ between layers so that various patterns of maturation can be identified by the keratins that are present.\n\nIn the upper part of the prickle cell layer a new organelle appears, called the membrane-coating or lamellate granule. These granules are small, membrane-bound structures containing glycolipid. In keratinized epithelium the granules are elongated and exhibit a series of parallel lamellae. In nonkeratinized epithelium, by contrast, the granules appear to be circular with an amorphous core (Figure 12-12). As the cells move toward the surface, these granules accumulate close to the cell membrane where they release lipids that participate in establishing a permeability barrier.\n\nThe next layer, called the granular layer in keratinized epithelium and the intermediate layer in nonkeratinized epithelium, contains cells that have a greater volume but are more flattened than those of the prickle cell layer. In the upper part of this layer, in keratinized and nonkeratinized epithelia, the membrane-coating granules appear to fuse with the superficial cell membrane and to discharge their contents into the intercellular space. In keratinized oral epithelium and epidermis, the discharge of granule contents is associated with the formation of a lipid-rich permeability barrier that limits the movement of aqueous substances through the intercellular spaces of the keratinized layer. The granules seen in nonkeratinized epithelium probably have a similar function, but the contents have a different lipid composition and do not form as effective a barrier as that in keratinized epithelia.\n\nCells in the more superficial part of the granular layer develop a cornified cell envelope on the inner (intracellular) aspect of their membrane that contributes to the considerable resistance of the keratinized layer to chemical solvents (see page 283, Figure 12-7). One of the major constituents of this thickening is a protein known as involucrin. A similar, but less obvious, thickening often is seen in the surface cells of nonkeratinized epithelia. The remaining events during epithelial maturation are greatly different in keratinized and nonkeratinized epithelia and so are described separately."
