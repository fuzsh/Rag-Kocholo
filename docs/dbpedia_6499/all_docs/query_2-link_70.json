        "text": "Layers of the Epidermis\n\nThe keratinocyte is an ectodermally derived cell and is the primary cell type in the epidermis, accounting for at least 80% of the total cells. The ultimate fate of these cells is to contribute the components for the epidermal barrier as the stratum corneum. Thus, much of the function of the epidermis can be gleaned from the study of the structure and development of the keratinocyte.\n\nKeratinocyte differentiation (keratinization) is a genetically programed, carefully regulated, complex series of morphologic changes and metabolic events whose endpoint is a terminally differentiated, dead keratinocyte (corneocyte) that contains keratin filaments, matrix protein, and a protein-reinforced plasma membrane with surface-associated lipids (see Chapter 46).\n\nKeratins are a family of intermediate filaments and are the hallmark of all epithelial cells, including keratinocytes.1,2 They serve a predominantly structural role in the cells. Fifty-four different functional keratin genes have been identified in humans—34 epithelial keratins and 17 hair keratins.3 The coexpression of specific keratin pairs is dependent on cell type, tissue type, developmental stage, differentiation stage, and disease condition (Table 7-2). Furthermore, the critical role of these molecules is underscored by the numerous manifestations of disease that arise because of mutations in these genes (see Table 7-2). Thus, knowledge of keratin expression, regulation, and structure provides insight into epidermal differentiation and structure.\n\nThe basal layer (stratum germinativum) contains mitotically active, columnar-shaped keratinocytes that attach via keratin filaments (K5 and K14) to the basement membrane zone at hemidesmosomes (see Chapter 53), attach to other surrounding cells through desmosomes, and that give rise to cells of the more superficial, differentiated epidermal layers. Membrane-bound vacuoles that contain pigmented melanosomes are transferred from melanocytes by phagocytosis.4 The pigment within melanosomes contributes to the overall skin pigmentation perceived macroscopically.5 The basal layer is the primary location of mitotically active cells of the epidermis. Cell kinetic studies suggest that the basal layer cells exhibit different proliferative potentials (stem cells, transit amplifying cells, and postmitotic cells), and in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that there exist long-lived epidermal stem cells (see Chapter 45).6,7 Because basal cells can be expanded in tissue culture and used to reconstitute sufficient epidermis to cover the entire skin surface of burn patients,8,9 such a starting population is presumed to contain long-lived stem cells with extensive proliferative potential, located within the basal epidermal layer (at the base of epidermal proliferating units) and the hair follicle bulge.10–13\n\nThe second type of cell, the transit amplifying cells of the basal layer, arises as a subset of daughter cells produced by the infrequent division of stem cells, either by symmetric or asymmetric cell division.14 These cells provide the bulk of the cell divisions needed for stable self-renewal and are the most common cells in the basal compartment. These cells subsequently give rise to the third class of epidermal basal cells, the postmitotic cells that undergo terminal differentiation. In humans, the normal transit time for a basal cell, from the time it loses contact with the basal layer to the time it enters the stratum corneum, is at least 14 days. Transit through the stratum corneum and subsequent desquamation require another 14 days. These periods of time can be altered in hyperproliferative or growth-arrested states.\n\nThe shape, structure, and subcellular properties of spinous cells correlate with their position within the midepidermis. They are named for the spine-like appearance of the cell margins in histologic sections. Suprabasal spinous cells are polyhedral in shape with a rounded nucleus. As these cells differentiate and move upward through the epidermis, they become progressively flatter and develop organelles known as lamellar granules (see Section “Granular Layer”). Spinous cells also contain large bundles of keratin filaments, organized around the nucleus and inserted into desmosomes peripherally.\n\nSpinous cells retain the stable K5/K14 keratins that are produced in the basal layer and only synthesize new messenger RNA (mRNA) for these proteins in hyperproliferative disorders. Instead, new synthesis of the K1/K10 keratin pair occurs in this epidermal layer. These keratins are characteristic of an epidermal pattern of differentiation and thus are referred to as the differentiation-specific or keratinization-specific keratins. However, in hyperproliferative conditions such as psoriasis, actinic keratoses, and wound healing, synthesis of K1 and K10 mRNA and protein is downregulated, and the synthesis and translation of messages for K6 and K16 are favored. Correlated with this change in keratin expression is a disruption of normal differentiation in the subsequent granular and cornified epidermal layers (see Sections “Granular Layer” and “Stratum Corneum”). mRNA for K6 and K16 are present throughout the epidermis normally, but the message is only translated on stimulation of proliferation.\n\nThe “spines” of spinous cells are abundant desmosomes, calcium-dependent cell surface modifications that promote adhesion of epidermal cells and resistance to mechanical stress (see Chapters 46 and 53).15 Although desmosomes are related to adherens junctions, the latter associate with actin microfilaments at cell–cell interfaces, via a distinct set of cadherins (e.g., E-cadherin) and intracellular catenin adapter molecules. That the desmosomes are integral mediators of intercellular adhesion is clearly demonstrated in diseases in which these structures are disrupted, by genetic disorders, autoantibodies, or bacterial proteases (Table 7-3).16,17\n\nThe importance of calcium as a mediator of adhesion is well illustrated in the cases of two conditions that exhibit characteristic epidermal dyscohesion: (1) Darier disease (keratosis follicularis) and (2) Hailey–Hailey disease (benign chronic pemphigus) (see Chapter 51).18 Both of these diseases are caused by mutations in genes that regulate calcium transport, SERCA2 in Darier disease and ATP2C1 in Hailey–Hailey disease.\n\nLamellar granules are also formed in this layer of epidermal cells (Fig. 7-5). These secretory organelles deliver precursors of stratum corneum lipids into the intercellular space (see Chapter 47). Genetic diseases demonstrate the importance of steroid and lipid metabolism for sloughing of cornified cells—in recessive X-linked ichthyosis, for example, mutation of steroid sulfatase results in a retention hyperkeratosis (see Chapter 49).19\n\nFigure 7-5\n\nJunction of the stratum granulosum (SG) and stratum corneum (SC). Lamellar granules (LG) are in the intercellular space and cytoplasm of the granular cell. Keratohyalin granules (KHG) are also evident. Inset: Lamellar granule, ×28,750. (From Holbrook K: Structure and development of the skin. In: Pathophysiology of Dermatologic Disease, 2nd edition, edited by Soter NA, Baden HP. New York, McGraw-Hill, 1991, p. 7, with permission. Inset used with permission from EC Wolff-Schreiner, MD.)\n\nNamed for the basophilic keratohyalin granules that are prominent within cells at this level of the epidermis, the granular layer is the site of generation of a number of the structural components that will form the epidermal barrier, as well as a number of proteins that process these components (see Fig. 7-2).20,21 Keratohyalin granules (see Fig. 7-5) are composed primarily of profilaggrin, keratin filaments, and loricrin. It is in this layer that the cornified cell envelope begins to form, with the conversion of profilaggrin to filaggrin. After aggregation with keratin to form macrofilaments, filaggrin is degraded into molecules such as urocanic acid and pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, which contribute to hydration of the stratum corneum and help filter UV radiation. Loricrin is a cysteine-rich protein that forms the major protein component of the cornified envelope. Upon its release from keratohyalin granules, loricrin binds to desmosomal structures and is subsequently cross-linked to the plasma membrane by tissue transglutaminases (TGMs, primarily TGMs 3 and 1) to form the cornified cell envelope.\n\nMutations in the TGM1 gene have been shown to be the basis of some cases of lamellar ichthyosis.22,23 Another form of ichthyosis, ichthyosis vulgaris, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin.24,25 Loricrin abnormalities result in a form of Vohwinkel syndrome with ichthyosis and pseudoainhum, as well as the disease progressive symmetric keratodermia.26–28 These findings emphasize the importance of proper formation of the cornified envelope in normal epidermal keratinization.\n\nThe final stage of granular cell differentiation into a corneocyte involves the cell’s own programed destruction, during which process almost all cellular contents are destroyed, with the exception of the keratin filaments and filaggrin matrix.20\n\nStratum Corneum (See Chapter 47)\n\nComplete differentiation of granular cells results in stacked layers of anucleate, flattened cornified cells that form the stratum corneum. It is this layer that provides mechanical protection to the skin and a barrier to water loss and permeation of soluble substances from the environment.21,29 The stratum corneum barrier is formed by a two-compartment system of lipid-depleted, protein-enriched corneocytes surrounded by a continuous extracellular lipid matrix. These two compartments provide somewhat segregated but complementary functions that together account for the “barrier activity” of the epidermis. Regulation of permeability, desquamation, antimicrobial peptide activity, toxin exclusion, and selective chemical absorption are all primarily functions of the extracellular lipid matrix. On the other hand, mechanical reinforcement, hydration, cytokine-mediated initiation of inflammation, and protection from UV damage are all provided by the corneocytes.\n\nNonkeratinocytes of the Epidermis\n\nMelanocytes are neural crest-derived, pigment-synthesizing dendritic cells that reside primarily in the basal layer (see Chapter 72).30 The function of melanocytes has been highlighted by disorders in melanocyte number or function. The classic dermatologic disease, vitiligo, is caused by the autoimmune depletion of melanocytes.31 Causes of other disorders of pigmentation are found in various defects in melanogenesis, including melanin synthesis, melanosome production, and melanosome transport and transfer to keratinocytes (see Chapters 72 and 75). Regulation of melanocyte proliferation and homeostasis is under intensive study as well as a means to understanding melanoma (see Chapter 124).32 Keratinocyte–melanocyte interactions are critical for melanocyte homeostasis and differentiation, influencing proliferation, dentricity, and melanization.\n\nMerkel cells are slow-adapting type I mechanoreceptors located in sites of high-tactile sensitivity (see Chapter 120).33 They are present among basal keratinocytes in hairy skin and in the glabrous skin of the digits, lips, regions of the oral cavity, and the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. Keratin 20 is restricted to Merkel cells in the skin and thus may be the most reliable molecular marker. Ultrastructurally, Merkel cells are easily identified by the membrane-bounded, dense-core granules that collect opposite the Golgi and proximal to an unmyelinated neurite (Fig. 7-6). These granules contain neurotransmitter-like substances and markers of neuroendocrine cells, including Met-enkephalin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin. Although increasingly more is being learned about the normal function of Merkel cells, they are of particular clinical note because Merkel cell-derived neoplasms are particularly aggressive and difficult to treat (see Chapter 120).\n\nFigure 7-6\n\nMerkel cells from the finger of a 130-mm CR (crown-rump) 21-week human fetus. Note nerve (N) in direct contact with the lateral and basal surfaces of the cell and dense core cytoplasmic granules (G). ×13,925. Inset: Merkel cell granules, ×61,450.\n\nLangerhans cells are dendritic antigen-processing and antigen-presenting cells in the epidermis (see Chapter 10).34 Although they are not unique to the epidermis, they form 2% to 8% of the total epidermal cell population, mostly found in a suprabasal position. The cytoplasm of the Langerhans cells contains characteristic small rod- or racket-shaped structures called Langerhans cell granules or Birbeck granules (Fig. 7-7). Langerhans cells principally function to sample and present antigens to T cells of the epidermis. Because of these functions, they are implicated in the pathologic mechanisms underlying allergic contact dermatitis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. Langerhans cells are reduced in the epidermis of patients with certain conditions, such as psoriasis, sarcoidosis, and contact dermatitis; they are functionally impaired by UV radiation, especially UVB.\n\nFigure 7-7\n\nLangerhans cell.

Romani, MD.)\n\nBecause of their effectiveness in antigen presentation and lymphocyte stimulation, dendritic cells and Langerhans cells have become prospective vehicles for tumor therapy and tumor vaccines. These cells are loaded with tumor-specific antigens, which will then stimulate the host immune response to mount an antigen-specific, and therefore tumor-specific, response."
