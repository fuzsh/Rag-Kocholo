        "meta_description": "Squamous Simple • Single layer of flattened cells • Bulging nuclei • Basal surface rests on basement membrane • Apical surface faces the environment Stratified • Comprises several layers of cells • Can be keratinized, with surface layers of dead, anucleic cells • Non-keratinized has surface layers with nucleiFunctions and Locations: • Provide an ideal surface for diffusion and filtration; hence, simple squamous epithelia is located in the alveolar sacs of the lungs and in the endothelium of cardiovascular linings. • Because of its multiple layers, stratified squamous epithelium provides protection from abrasion, dehydration, or potentially harmful substances. - For example, the outer layers of the epidermis protect the underlying layers from constant abrasion with the external environment, and the squamous epithelium of GI tract faces the lumen, so it protects underlying tissues from gastric contents. Cuboidal Epithelium Simple • Comprises a single layer of cubed, block-like cells resting on a basement membrane • Its nuclei are centrally located, and line up in rows • May have cilia, which increase surface area for absorption and secretion • If arranged around a lumen, apical surface faces it Stratified • Comprises multiple (usually two) layers of cuboidal cells • Round nuclei Functions and Locations: • Facilitates absorption and secretion - For example, the kidney tubules, which are responsible for fine-tuning the urine contents, are lined with simple cuboidal epithelium - Cilia, which can be motile or non-motile, and/or microvilli may be present. Recall that microvilli are cytoplasmic extensions that increase the surface area of the plasma membrane. • Protection - For example, stratified cuboidal epithelia of the large salivary gland ducts protects surrounding tissues from salivary secretions. Columnar Simple • Comprises a basement membrane supporting cells that are taller than they are wide • Goblet cells secrete mucus to tra...",
