        "text": "Simple Squamous Epithelium\n\nStratified Squamous Epithelium\n\nAnswer:\n\nSimple Squamous Epithelium\n\nSimple squamous epithelium is an epithelium with one cell layer comprising delicate, scaly shaped flat cells. It lines the vessels of the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems.\n\nDue to soft and thin cells, this epithelium permits the passage of chemical compounds through it. Therefore, the epithelium allows the gas exchange in the alveoli and the exchange of material between the blood and the extracellular fluid.\n\nStratified Squamous Epithelium\n\nThe epithelium that consists of two or more layers of bland and scaly like cells of epithelium is defined as stratified squamous epithelium.\n\nIn humans, the stratified squamous epithelium is the standard of stratified epithelium. The upper layers of this epithelium include squamous epithelial cells.\n\nRelated links:"
