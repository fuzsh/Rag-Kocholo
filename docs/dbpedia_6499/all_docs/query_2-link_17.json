Basal keratinocytes are mitotically active and express keratins 5 and 14, with a minor amount of K15 [39]. As keratinocytes migrate upwards and suffer differentiation, they start expressing keratin 1 and 10, with a loss of K5 and K14 expression [40]. In addition, there is expression of K2 in the upper spinous and granular layers [41]. Furthermore, in the palmar-plantar epidermis, K9 is prominently expressed in the suprabasal differentiating layers [42]; K6, K16, K17, and K19 are also expressed in specific spatial patterns, and their expression can be rapidly induced upon various challenges, such as wounding and infection [43]. Since corneocytes are dead cells composed of a strong protein-lipid envelope surrounding these keratin bundles, studies of the isolated influence of keratin filaments on their mechanical properties are difficult to perform. Nevertheless, as seen in the previous section, it is possible to make a distinction between the contribution of the CE and the cell interior using AFM force spectroscopy. Furthermore, by studying the phenomena occurring with the viable cells of the epidermis, it is possible to extrapolate knowledge to the product of their differentiation, that is, corneocytes. For example, it has been observed in multiple studies that mutations in keratin genes, such as in the disruption of filament formation or alteration of properties and dynamics of bundle assembly, reduce the strength of cells [44, 45].\n\nLiving human keratinocytes were studied under loading and unloading cycles of single cells by AFM, and it was observed that a typical force of 0.4 ± 0.1 μN was required to reach 30% compression and 6.0 ± 2.0 μN for an 80% compression of the original height [44]. The Young’s moduli of the keratinocyte membrane and cytoplasm were calculated to be 23–38 MPa and 120–340 kPa, respectively, which is a factor of 25–30 greater than that of the cytoskeleton of T cells. This shows that keratins are responsible for the high stiffness of keratinocytes. A correlation between molecular integrity of keratin filaments (K5 and K14) and mechanical toughness of epithelial cells was also found [46]. The modulus of mutant cells (not expressing K14) was 343 ± 18 and 412 ± 74 Pa for the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, while for controls, a greater cell stiffness was observed of 459 ± 31 Pa for the nucleus and 752 ± 100 Pa for the cytoplasm.\n\nIn a different study, Akinshina et al. [47] attempted to verify the results obtained by Jokura et al. [48]. The latter studied the effects of the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) components on the SC using nuclear magnetic resonance, rheology, and scanning electron microscopy. They observed that treating excised SC with water would release the NMF component, leading to a reduction in the mobility of keratin intermediate filaments (IFs) and a greater value of the elastic modulus. The electron micrographs suggested that, in the absence of NMF, the keratin filaments tend to associate more tightly. They concluded that the increase in corneocyte rigidity is due to increased intermolecular attractive forces between keratin filaments, and, by modelling the interactions between keratin IFs suspended in different media, found that the N-tails of the keratin filaments act as the “glue,” while the C-tails are responsible for maintaining a certain distance between the IFs. The small charged species comprising the NMF then act in the prevention of the attractive forces between the protruding terminal domains of IF helical cores. When they are eliminated, the attractive forces are sufficiently large to “glue” the filaments together and thus increase the stiffness of the corneocyte. This denotes the complex relationships existing in SC cells in order to maintain mechanical integrity.\n\nThe stretching of cultured keratinocytes also provides an insight into the response of cells to certain types of mechanical stimuli. When normal human keratinocytes and HaCat cells were stretched, the expression of K10 was completely suppressed after 24 h, and the K6 expression was induced; that is, the mechanical stimulus suppressed the differentiation of the cells [49]. The response of cultured cells to mechanical stimuli raises the question of what happens to keratin expression when the skin is subjected to clinically relevant pressures, such as those of a patient lying in bed or seated in a wheelchair: are keratinocytes able to adapt in the presence of mechanical loading? Using a device to periodically stimulate keratinocytes (over 80 h), it was observed that the keratin distribution of the cells was amorphous and partly granular, as described for corneocytes [50]. The expression of a 67-kDa keratin was found in mechanically stimulated HaCat cells, which is not normally expressed by cultured keratinocytes. Furthermore, Yamaguchi et al. [51] found that non-palmoplantar keratinocytes gained the ability to express K9 when co-cultured with palmoplantar fibroblasts.\n\nThe influence of the morphology and composition of plantar skin on the tolerance to load has been studied [52]. Plantar SC was found to be a factor of 16 thicker than the SC from non-plantar skin, with greater interdigitation between the epidermis and dermis and with a 2.1 increase in fluorescence intensity of desmoglein 1, a key component of CDs. Moreover, plantar skin was observed to deform less with loading (factors of 1.6 and 3.4 less under compression and shear, respectively). The SC showed a factor of 3 increase in the Young’s modulus, and factors of 4.8 and 7.2 increase for the viable epidermis and dermis, respectively. Using a pyramidal probe, the change of the Young’s modulus with depth proved to be more gradual for plantar skin (18% decrease per 100 μm) than for non-plantar skin (84% decrease per 100 μm). The authors suggested this may assist in mitigating stress concentrations by eliminating “hotspot” areas of stress. Plantar skin seems to mitigate the effect of mechanical insults by diverse structures and mechanisms: thicker SC is associated with greater stiffness and more cohesion since there is a greater number of desmosomes. To study the mechanical properties of individual corneocytes would be a logical next step to complement the knowledge about this type of SC.\n\nApart from keratin bundles that fill the interior of corneocytes, 2 other components contributing to the mechanical strength of these cells and the mechanical resistance of SC must be considered. These are the CD and the CE. Extensive reviews on the formation and composition of both structures have been presented elsewhere [7, 8, 14, 53]. In brief, the cornification process begins with the synthesis of an immature CE beneath the plasma membrane of the keratinocytes. This envelope undergoes maturation by the covalent attachment of certain precursor proteins (such as involucrin, loricrin, and small proline-rich proteins) to produce a quite rigid structure [53]. Transglutaminase activity allows the cross-linking of proteins via γ-gamma-glutamyl-ε-lysine isopeptide bonds, which reinforces the envelope [54]. Some authors have observed that the composition of CEs is variable and dependent on the type of substrate available to the transglutaminases [55], with some considering the possibility of the incorporation of CD proteins later in the CE maturation [56]. In addition, the maturation of CEs culminates with the covalent attachment of ceramides, fatty acids, and others to involucrin and loricrin, creating a hydrophobic coating [57, 58]. These bound lipids are called the CLE and are thought to be a scaffold for the intercellular lipids of the SC [59-61], further stabilizing and promoting the plasticity of this top layer.\n\nThe maturation of the CE follows the movement of corneocytes in the SC, and many authors have attempted to discriminate mature from immature CEs using microscopy and immunostaining techniques. CEs from different SC depths were first observed by Nomarski contrast microscopy, which allowed the identification of 2 different populations of CEs: “fragile” and “resilient” [55]. These 2 states of maturation can be found in the most superficial layer of SC, although the amount of fragile CE is small in normal skin and elevated in dry skin [28]. Moreover, the ratio between resilient and fragile CEs in the case of inflammatory skin disorders was found to be decreased in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis [62].\n\nMost recently, the standard technique for assessing CE maturity is the double staining of lipids with Nile red and immunostaining of involucrin. Nile red is used to stain lipids covalently bound to the CE, the last step of corneocyte maturation, while immunostaining of involucrin is performed to distinguish non-matured CEs [63]. It is suggested that the loss of involucrin staining during corneocyte maturation must be a result of the covalent attachment of lipids to CE proteins, in which case the epitope of involucrin might be hidden for recognition by the antibody upon immunostaining. Corneocytes were reported to become less and less mature with increasing SC depth [64, 65]. This morphological feature is related to the mechanical strength of corneocytes as discussed previously: a decrease in Young’s modulus of corneocytes with depth from the first strip (250 MPa) to the seventh strip (150 MPa) for the CE [36] and a similar trend reported when measuring the force necessary to compress both CE types [28].\n\nGuneri et al. [58] applied conventional methods and a novel one to evaluate the maturity of CEs. They found that the anti-involucrin and Nile red approach was limited in discriminating the maturity of CEs in the deeper SC layers of photo-exposed (PE) cheek and photo-protected (PP) post-auricular. With this method, both deep layers (PP9 and PE9, 9th tape strip) would be considered immature. Although when analysing the morphology of CEs after sonication, differences were found in the proportion of immature CEs in the deeper layers of the PE cheek (43 ± 6.5% less maturity), but PP9 seemed to be less perturbed by this mechanical stress. This means that although the traditional method would regard PP9 CEs to be immature, they cannot be considered immature in their response to mechanical stress, suggesting that the maturation of corneocytes depends both on the formation of a mechanical resistant CE and on the establishment of a lipid envelope [61] surrounding the rigid CE. In summary, the maturation of CEs is intimately related to the stiffness of corneocytes: maturated corneocytes are stiffer not only because of the type of keratin bundles composing their matrix but also because of the cross-linking occurring in the CE.\n\nIn addition to the maturation of the CE, another important step in cornification is related to the formation and degradation of CDs. These structures are responsible for the cohesion of the deeper layers of the SC that bind the corneocytes together. The importance of these components was demonstrated by the absence of corneodesmosin expression, which results in the premature detachment of corneocytes from the SC in mice and humans [66]. The precise distribution of desmoglein 1 (DSG1) in corneocytes as they transit in SC has been studied (Fig. 5) [67]. The outer layer or mature SC is characterized by a honeycomb-like structure, in which the cornified cells are attached only laterally in the same cell layer [68]. This feature is only absent in palmar and plantar regions, where CDs are found to be dispersed over the whole surface of the cells. These junctional structures are modified desmosomes [69, 70] involved in desquamation, a complex process regulated by several proteases and inhibitors, first expressed in the stratum granulosum and secreted to the extracellular space. Peripheral CDs are thought to persist in the outer SC, being protected from enzymatic degradation by tight junctions that surround them [71]. A correlation between TEWL readings and the localization of DSG1 has also been established, with the presence of DSG1 on the periphery of cells being associated with a healthy SC (lower values of TEWL), and if dispersed on the whole surface, corresponding to a reduced barrier function (higher TEWL) [67]. Moreover, the honeycomb feature of mature SC seems to result in improved flexibility of the whole layer by attenuating mechanical insults, such as bending or flexing, allowing the shape of corneocytes to adapt and the outer SC to perform minimal “slide” over the inner SC [72].\n\nFurthermore, the digestion of CDs increases with increasing relative humidity (r.h.) [73]. It was also found that at high (80% r.h.), but not at low (44% r.h.), humidity, glycerol further enhances CD digestion. When the glycerol-treated SC was extended at 80% r.h., the extensibility of the SC increased dramatically, indicating a reduction of intercorneocyte cohesion. This behaviour is suggested to be caused by the influence of humidity on the activity of desquamatory enzymes. When an inhibitor of serine proteases was introduced, the moisture-dependent increase in tissue extensibility was prevented. Finally, the stiffness of the SC was largely unchanged even at high doses of UV radiation, while the fracture strength and fracture strain of the SC decreased with increasing UV exposure [74, 75], indicating that UV influences cellular cohesion, dominated by both intercellular lipids and CDs, while not interfering with the mechanical resistance of the tissue, which is mainly controlled by the keratin matrix and the rigid CE of corneocytes. A dispersion in the localization of DSG1 in the tissue, indicating degradation of CDs after UV radiation treatment, was also observed [75].\n\nCDs seem to play a major role in the cohesion of SC, which can be divided into 2 main regions: the deeper-immature SC, which is much more cohesive, and the outer SC, for which flexibility and plasticity may depend on intercellular lipids and the honeycomb localization of CDs. It is important to note that the honeycomb structure of the outer SC seems to be preferred in most body regions, but not for the palmar and plantar zones [75, 76]. In these regions, there prevails a strong cohesion between corneocytes, with CDs dispersed on the whole surface. This cohesiveness in combination with greater Young’s modulus (greater stiffness) may be an evolutionary advantage since they are subjected to greater pressures and other forces even if it is associated with decreased suppleness and barrier function.\n\nWhen analysing the surface of corneocytes using SEM and AFM, small circular protrusions of a few hundreds of nanometres (termed circular nano-objects – CNOs) are observed on the basal side of the cells (Fig. 6c [33]). Cells from the palms and soles were observed to have an irregular shape, with excessive wrinkling on their surfaces and sometimes villi-like structures, while those from the axilla, umbilical region, and the back presented a hexagonal shape, with trabeculae that were parallel to the cell border, forming a regular network [77]. Similar differences were found using AFM TM to analyse the topography of cells from the forearm (smooth topography) and the palm of the hand (with the presence of numerous small protrusions) [78].\n\nThe distribution of these structures is not homogenous: some cells are covered with CNOs, while some cells are smooth with a subcellular preference of CNOs at the periphery. Such protrusions have been associated with cell-to-cell adhesion [79] and assigned to ageing [22] and some skin states and disorders [16, 22, 80-82], as reviewed in detail by Riethmüller [83]. Using a computer vision algorithm, Franz et al. [84] were able to determine the mean number densities of CNOs over cell surfaces; they termed this parameter the Dermal Texture Index (DTI). It was found to be greatest on lesion areas of AD skin (DTI 200–800), but also to be greater in non-lesion areas, when compared to healthy skin controls (DTI ∼100). An increase in DTI was also found in cases of loss of function of filaggrin [85]. The same authors observed corneodesmosin (a key component of CDs) to be present in CNOs by immunogold electron microscopy. Although the literature does not define a conclusive connection between CNOs and CDs, it is reasonable to explore such relations. It is known that the degradation of filaggrin leads to an increase in NMF concentration that is responsible for water retention, which is an important factor for the activation of proteases involved in the degradation of CDs, as mentioned above. Consequently, it is reasonable to relate a mutation of the filaggrin loss-of-function gene with a greater number of CNOs by the impaired degradation of CDs when the water content is decreased. If CD degradation is impaired, corneocyte maturation might be compromised, which would explain the defect in barrier function attributed to the intercellular lipids that might not have the space to rearrange, viz., a greater number of CDs imply a greater cohesion of the SC but a loss in barrier function.\n\nIn addition, corneodesmosin was detected on the surface of the SC using the simultaneous topographic and recognition imaging (TREC) technique based on AFM [86]. The authors found the density of corneodesmosin to be about 1,000 proteins/µm2 on the surface of corneocytes from superficial SC and about 1,200 in deeper layers of SC. Moreover, the size of the recognition spots was larger in the deeper SC, which is in agreement with the described progressive degradation of corneodesmosin during the desquamation process [87]. The topographic and recognition images showed that the protein is located mainly on “bead-like” structures observed by the authors, although not every structure presented recognition sites [86]. Using the same technique (TREC), Danzberger et al. [88] studied the location of glycans on the corneocyte surface. Glycan moieties were demonstrated to protect CDs from proteolysis, and so to be involved in the desquamation process [89]. In this study, almost all recognition sites for glycans were on top of “bead-like” topographical elevations (height between 1.1 and 4 nm) [88]. The authors suggested that these structures could be remnants of CDs [13].\n\nAn unequivocal correlation between morphology and function of these structures is still lacking, and work to relate the above topographical feature with the mechanical characteristics and maturation states of corneocytes should be done. A study by Guo et al. [90] carried out relevant research by exploring the adhesion of single corneocytes in different layers of the SC. Both peripheral and interplanar adhesion increased with depth. Moreover, cells from the most superficial layers showed a weaker interplanar adhesion than the peripheral one, which is consistent with the localization of CDs in the superficial SC. This anisotropy of adhesion forces agrees with the protective barrier role of the SC, allowing for a resistance to stretching and shearing forces, while not compromising the integrity of the layer.\n\nCorneocytes are the “bricks” of the SC (Fig. 7) primarily responsible for the mechanical strength and stiffness and contributing to the barrier function. Being the product of differentiation of keratinocytes, these cells create distinct regions in the SC: the inner SC characterized by immature cells with a fragile CE and a uniform distribution of CDs, and the upper SC with resilient CEs and a honeycomb distribution of CDs.\n\nRegarding their morphology, it is important to note the following: (1) the regional differences in the surface area and thickness (200 nm to ≤1 μm). Corneocytes from body sites usually more protected from chemical, physical, and mechanical insults (e.g., ventral region of arms and legs and abdomen) generally have a greater surface area (1,000–1,200 μm2) and are thinner than those exposed to insults, such as the forehead, cheek, palms, and soles (700–800 μm2) [91]. (2) The increase in the surface area of corneocytes with age, and finally, (3) the correlation between the surface area, thickness, and location of these cells in the SC, with upper cells presenting a greater surface area and smaller thickness than deeper cells [20, 92, 93], which depends upon the sequential maturation of corneocytes along the SC. This morphological maturation is ultimately related to the mechanical properties of corneocytes [36], with immature cells from the deeper regions of the SC being less stiff than those at the surface [28, 36]. Corneocytes are more rigid than other cell types (the Young’s modulus of other cell types such as muscle [94] and fibroblasts [95] is typically a few kPa) and present 2 distinct mechanical regions: the CE (100–250 MPa) and the keratin matrix (250–500 MPa).\n\nThe SC is usually described as having 2 different regions, the stratum compactum and the stratum disjunctum that relate to the maturation of corneocytes, particularly in the distribution of CDs over the cell surface, as represented in Figure 5. There is a progressive degradation of CDs from the inner to the outer SC, the latter being characterized by a honeycomb structure. The presence of CNOs seems to be related to CDs, since these structures have been observed to contain corneodesmosin. However, a clear relation between their presence in normal skin and their function is still lacking. Moreover, the SC from different body sites possesses different characteristics, particularly that from palmar and plantar regions, which is much stiffer and cohesive with a uniform distribution of CDs over the surface of the cell [76]. Although the stiffness of plantar corneocytes seems to arise from the expression of K9, further mechanical studies are needed to comprehend the maturation of the CE in such regions, particularly how it is affected by the persistence of CDs in the upper SC.\n\nTo understand the morphological and mechanical properties of corneocytes is a crucial step in revealing the mechanisms underpinning skin barrier function and integrity loss. Intercellular lipids are normally considered to be the barrier function elements of the SC; however, the optimal arrangement of this “mortar” seems to depend on the correct formation of a cornified protein and lipid envelope that serves as a scaffold. The literature reviewed indicates that the relationship between the maturation of corneocytes and the mechanical resistance is one of the most critical steps in the formation of an effective SC barrier. When the morphology of the corneocytes is perturbed, an impaired barrier function is observed, and some skin disorders may arise. Furthermore, in the presence of water, there is increased degradation of CDs, which may compromise the response of the SC towards loading.\n\nHowever, there are still gaps in the knowledge about these cells, particularly in their response to mechanical loading and frictional forces and on the role of the structural lipids attached to the CE on the desquamation process, as well as the implications of their presence on the skin microbiome. It has been suggested that the CLE may, on the one hand, function as a scaffold for the organization of the extracellular bilayers and, on the other, contribute to the cohesion of the SC [61]. Moreover, it is thought that the CLE may function as a selective body of permeation, allowing free transmembrane passage of water, while restricting the loss of larger hygroscopic molecules out of the cell, such as filaggrin breakdown products [61].\n\nIt is also relevant to mention the overlooked relationship that seems to exist between the accelerated degradation of CLE and atopic dermatitis [96]. AD is frequently aggravated by the colonization of bacteria secreting ceramidase or the activation of endogenous ceramidase activity [97], which, by contributing to the degradation of the CLE, may induce the release of hygroscopic products from the cell interior, resulting in the appearance of xerosis [98]. A recent study using AFM showed that the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to corneocytes from AD patients is controlled by NMF [99]. Reduced filaggrin expression, and consequently low levels of NMF, has been shown previously to facilitate the colonization by these bacteria [100]. The authors postulated that the strong adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to the cells originates from an increased exposure or expression of ligand proteins on the SC surface. Topographic images show that the surface morphology of corneocytes from low-NMF skin samples present a high density of villous protrusions, which were the regions where strong adhesion bonds were concentrated [99]. Finally, the authors also point out that bacterium-skin adhesion is greatly enhanced by physical stress, as shown by the considerable increase in strength of adhesion bonds subjected to tensile forces [99]. Finally, it would be relevant to study the modifications imposed by pressure on the expression of keratins as well as on the maturation of the CE, both in vitro and in vivo, and to consolidate the knowledge related to mechanical properties of corneocytes of different body sites and site-dependent cell maturation."
