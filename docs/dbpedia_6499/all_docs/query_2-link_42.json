        "text": "TOP OF PAGE\n\nKeratinocytes\n\nThe epidermis consists primarily of keratinocytes. Scattered among the keratinocytes are a few other cell types -- melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells\n\nKeratinocytes, which comprise most of the epidermis, are characterized by numerous intercellular junctions (desmosomes), reinforced by intracytoplasmic tonofilaments.\n\nEach desmosome is one spot of attachment. At high magnification, the desmosomes are visible as fine \"prickles\" extending across the gap (intercellular space) between adjacent keratinocytes. Between these junctions lie intercellular channels which permit nutrients to diffuse from dermis into epidermis. (More.)\n\nKeratinocytes in the stratum basale of the epidermis can undergo mitosis. The formation of new cells in this basal layer gradually pushes previously formed cells upward where they become the stratum spinosum. As keratinocytes approach the surface of the epidermis, they accumulate intracellular keratin and secrete a waxy material into the intercellular space; these changes are visible in the stratum granulosum, a distinctive layer which is diagnostic for a keratinized epithelium. As maturing keratinocytes seal off the intercellular spaces through which they receive nutrients, they eventually die and form the stratum corneum, a tough and relatively inpermeable layer of hardened, dead cells. Eventually, as cells reach the surface, they are sloughed off. The entire epidermis above the basal layer is replenished (replaced by new cells) within about two weeks. Replacement is accelerated by injury.\n\nThe stages in keratinocyte maturation appear as layers in the epidermis, so that a section across the epidermis illustrates the entire process.\n\nSee the Electron Microscopic Atlas of cells, tissues and organs in the internet for (mostly unlabelled) EM images of epidermis.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nOther epidermal cell types\n\nScattered among the much more numerous keratinocytes are several other epidermal cell types -- melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Because these cells lack the tough reinforcement and desmosomal attachments that characterize keratinocytes, they commonly shrink during preparation and appear surrounded by a clear \"halo\". (Together these cell types are all quite distinct from keratincytes. But they are difficult to distinguish from one another without special techniques.)\n\nMelanocytes manufacture the pigment melanin. Melanocytes appear as small cells, usually in or near the stratum basale. They have thin cytoplasmic processes (not evident in ordinary histological preparations) which extend between nearby keratinocytes and serve to transfer melanosomes (melanin-containing granules) into adjacent keratinocytes. Because of this transfer, most pigment-containing cells in the epidermis are normally keratinocytes rather than melanocytes.\n\nMelanocytes may be found in places other than skin, such the choroid layer of the eye.\n\nMelanocytes are derived from neural crest and migrate to their final position in the epidermis. This developmental propensity for travel may contribute to the dangerously metastatic potential of melanomas.\n\nRecent research: \"The melanoma revolution: From UV carcinogenesis to a new era in therapeutics,\" Science 346: 945-949 (2014)\n\nLangerhans cells (named after Paul Langerhans, b. 1847) are antigen-presenting cells which participate in the surveillance function of the immune system. (Antigen-presenting cells acquire foreign materials [antigens] and pass them along to lymphocytes.) Langerhans cells are smaller than keratinocytes, with relatively clear cytoplasm, usually located within the stratum spinosum or stratum basale. Langerhans cells are dendritic cells, with extensive cytoplasmic processes extending between keratinocytes to sample intruding antigens throughout the epidermis. [NOTE: Please try not to confuse Langerhans with Langhans, each of whom has an eponymous cell named after him.]\n\nMerkel cells (named after Friedrich Merkel, b. 1845) are small cells associated with nerve endings in epidermis. Their function has long been uncertain, but they seem to be involved in neural development and tactile sensation. Recent evidence supports a role for Merkel cells in light touch, \"suggesting that these cells form an indispensible part of the somatosensory apparatus\" (Science 324:1580, 2009; also see The Journal of Neuroscience 32(10): 3296-3300, doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5307-11.2012 ). Some uncommon skin cancers derive from Merkel cells.\n\nSee the Electron Microscopic Atlas of cells, tissues and organs in the internet for (mostly unlabelled) EM images of Merkel cells.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nDermis and hypodermis\n\nThe dermis consists of dense, fibrous connective tissue whose predominant connective tissue component is collagen.\n\nThe texture of collagen fibers serves as the basis for recognizing two layers of dermis.\n\nThe papillary layer of the dermis lies adjacent to the epidermis and consists of relatively small, finely textured collagen fibers. This layer is named after dermal papillae, the protrusions of dermal connective tissue which indent the base of the epidermis. Dermal papillae increase the contact area for attachment between dermis and epidermis; they are more pronounced in thick skin.\n\nThe reticular layer of the dermis lies beneath the papillary layer and consists of larger, more coarsely textured collagen fibers. (\"Reticular\" means \"like a network\" and describes the texture of collagen fibers in this layer.)\n\nLike ordinary connective tissue throughout the body, connective tissue of the dermis serves several distinct functions.\n\nTough collagen fibers and resilient elastic fibers provide mechanical strength for skin.\n\nClinical note: Lines of tension in the dermis, called Langer's lines (after Karl Langer, b. 1817), affect healing after surgical incision. Cuts across the lines tend to pull apart, with concommitant tendency toward tissue distortion and scarring, more so than do cuts parallel to the lines.\n\nThe ground substance of the dermis serves as the substrate for diffusion of nutrients and wastes to and from various other tissue components.\n\nMast cells, lymphocytes and macrophages in the connective tissue carry out surveillance for the immune system.\n\nFinally, the dermis together with its associated blood vessels and nerves is capable of active response to injury, yielding the defensive reaction of inflammation, followed by the healing processes of growth and repair.\n\nWithin the dermis are embedded several other structures, including epidermal appendages (sweat glands and hair follicles) as well as blood vessels and nerve endings.\n\nThe connective tissue of the dermis grades into hypodermis, without a sharp transition or distinct boundary.\n\nOver most of the body, hypodermis is characterized by adipocytes and may comprise a thick layer of adipose tissue. In some sites (e.g., \"dimples\"), hypodermis is fibrous and binds the dermis to underlying structures. Hair follicles and sweat glands may extend into hypodermis\n\nBlood vessels are generally larger in the deeper layers of skin, with only capillaries in the papillary layer of the dermis.\n\nThe appearance of the skin can have considerable clinical significance. The skin is readily accessible for examination (no invasive procedures needed), and its color and texture can reveal much about underlying physiology.\n\nColor: Skin is moderately transparent. Light which penetrates the skin is reflected back from varying depths by epidermal cells, by collagen, and by blood.\n\nRecent research: \"Shedding light on skin color,\" Science 346: 934-936\n\nMelanin, produced by melanocytes and stored in basal keratinocytes, contributes a yellow/brown color to the epidermis. If the epidermis is not heavily pigmented, light readily penetrates into the dermis.\n\nCollagen scatters light from the dermis without altering its color. Hence, the whiteness of \"white\" skin is primarily a reflection of collagen.\n\nHemoglobin in red blood cells scatters red light and is responsible for the pinkness of unpigmented skin. The relative amount of pink in any given patch of skin reflects how closely blood approaches the base of the epidermis (i.e., how much collagen intervenes to scatter white light before red blood cells can absorb the non-red colors).\n\nEach of these elements contributes to the apparent color of skin. Variations in skin color in different parts of the body (see regional differences) are based on variations in these elements, most especially the amount of pigment, the thickness of dermis, and the degree of perfusion in dermal capillaries.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, blood flow through the dermis is highly variable and is regulated in response to many conditions (heat, pain, fluid balance, inflammation, emotional reaction). Resulting variations in pinkness can provide indicators of underlying physiology, both locally and systemically. Obvious examples include inflammation, overheating, dehydration, shock, and even embarrassment (i.e., blushing) .\n\nTexture: Skin texture is affected the thickness and smoothness of the epidermis, by the quality of fibers in the dermis, and by the amount of fluid in dermal connective tissue.\n\nBecause the epidermis is continually being replenished by cell divisions among basal keratinocytes and because this tissue is exposed to a variety of insults, the epidermis is especially prone to disturbances of growth. See any pathology book for examples.\n\nThe connective tissue fibers of the skin are permanent, enduring without replacement (except by repair after injury) throughout life. Although collagen is quite durable, elastin commonly deteriorates with age (and especially with repeated exposure to sunlight) and loses its elasticity. This is easily demonstrated by a \"pinch test.\" In youthful skin, loose skin that has been pinched into a ridge quickly returns to its normal position when released. Elderly skin commonly remains in its deformed position, returning more slowly if at all.\n\nBoth edema (accumulation of excess fluid in connective tissue) and dehydration can dramatically alter the appearance of skin.\n\nSkin includes several specialized structures, including epidermal appendages (sweat glands, hair follicles, nails) as well as blood vessels and nerve endings which travel through the dermis.\n\nsweat glands\n\nhair follicles, sebaceous glands\n\nnails\n\ninnervation\n\nvasculature\n\nEpidermal appendages play an especially important role in recovery from superficial scrapes and burns. Even when the epidermis has been removed over a fairly large area, it can grow back quickly from the epithelial cells which remain in deeper hair follicles and/or sweat glands. Third-degree burns are so serious precisely because tissue damage extends deep enough into the dermis to destroy these sources of replacement cells.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nSweat glands\n\nSweat glands are simple tubular glands lined by cuboidal epithelium. The secretory portion of the gland lies deep in the dermis, where the tubule is twisted into a fairly compact tangle. A duct communicates outward through the overlying dermis and the epidermis.\n\nThe secretory portion of a sweat gland is comprised of cells which are larger than those of the duct. These cells form a simple cuboidal epithelium, along with interspersed myoepithelial cells (which can expel sweat by contraction).\n\nCells comprising the duct, or conducting portion of the tubule, usually form a two-layered stratified cuboidal epithelium. These cells are usually stained more intensely than those comprising the secretory portion of the tubule. As fluid flows through the duct, its composition is modified by reabsorption of certain elements from the fluid. (This is primarily a means of conserving salt.)\n\nSweat glands are vital for thermoregulation. They also influence water and ion balance.\n\nThe primary function for sweating is evaporative cooling of the body. Thus, the amount of sweat is regulated as a function of body temperature.\n\nHowever, sweat also contains salt. Normally, sweat which comes out on the surface of the skin has a lower salt concentration than the precursor fluid produced by the secretory cells of the sweat gland. Salt is reabsorbed by the duct of the sweat gland. The effectiveness of this salt reabsorption is regulated by aldosterone (the hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte homeostasis) in response to bodily salt balance.\n\nThere are two types of sweat glands. Ordinary eccrine sweat glands are found over most of the body, while larger apocrine sweat glands are found in axillary, pubic, and perianal regions.\n\nBoth types of sweat glands have the same basic shape, but apocrine glands have taller cells and much larger diameter.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nHair follicles\n\nHair follicles are tubular invaginations lined by stratified squamous epithelium similar to epidermis.\n\nToward the bottom of each follicle, processes of cell division, growth, and maturation similar to those in the epidermis yield a cylindrical column of dead, keratinized cells (the hair shaft) which gradually extrudes from the follicle. (For details, consult your histology textbook.)\n\nHair follicles are associated with sebaceous glands as well as nerve endings and smooth muscle, which all together form the pilosebaceous apparatus.\n\nA network of nerve endings detects deflection of the hair shaft and also controls piloerection (hair \"standing on end,\" or \"goose bumps\").\n\nPiloerection is effected by smooth muscle. A small bundle of smooth muscle cells called the arrector pili (\"hair erector\") is attached to the connective tissue sheath around each hair follicle.\n\nSebaceous glands secrete oil into the hair follicle.\n\nHair growth is moderately complex, resulting in considerable variation in appearance of hair follicles related to growth phase (i.e., anagen, catagen, and telogen, or growing, regressing, and resting) as well as to body region and to age and gender. (For additional detail, consult your histology textbook or see here (NIH NLM).)\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nSebaceous glands\n\nSebaceous glands are associated with hair follicles. The complex of hair follicle, hair shaft, and sebaceous gland is sometimes called the pilosebaceous apparatus.\n\nHistologically, sebaceous glands are quite different from all other glands. They are holocrine glands, which means that the whole cell is secreted. The process of holocrine secretion is more similar to maturation of keratinocytes than to ordinary glandular function. Cells formed by mitosis at the base of the gland are pushed toward the surface as new cells form below. Along the way, the cells become packed with lipid and then die. The secretion consists of breakdown-products of the cells themselves, which extrude into the lumen of the associated hair follicle. So, basically, sebaceous glands are small masses of epidermal cells in which sebum (a mixture of lipids) accumulates rather than keratin.\n\nThe dying cells in sebaceous glands provide a good opportunity to learn the appearance of pyknotic nuclei, one of the more conspicuous signs of cell death.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nNails\n\nPlease consult an in-depth text (e.g., Chapter 3, Histology for Pathologists, Sternberg, 1998; newer edition: Mills, Histology for Pathologists, 3rd ed., 2007) if you desire histological details on fingernails and toenails.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nInnervation\n\nThe skin is richly innervated, served by a variety of sensory nerve endings which respond to a variety of modalities (e.g., pressure, vibration, heat, cold, itch, pain) and by motor nerve endings which control blood flow, sweat secretion, and piloerection.\n\nRecent research: \"The gentle touch receptors of mammalian skin,\" Science 346: 950-54.\n\nMeissner's corpuscles\n\nPacinian corpuscle\n\nFor richer information on the following, see Neuroscience Online, Somatosensory systems.\n\nFree nerve endings (without any conspicuous associated structure) terminate within the epidermis, penetrating almost to the stratum corneum.\n\nMerkel's touch corpuscles (named after Friedrich Merkel, b. 1845) are nerve endings associated with Merkel cells at the base of the epidermis in thick (glabrous) skin of palms and soles.\n\nMeissner's corpuscles (named after Georg Meissner, b. 1829) (images at right) are encapsulated endings in dermal papillae, most common in palmar and plantar skin, especially in fingertips.\n\nPacinian corpuscles (named after Filipo Pacini, b. 1812), located deeper in dermis (image at right), are simple nerve endings but are each encapsulated by multilamellar, ovoid structures resembling small onions. Pacinian corpuscles respond to deep pressure.\n\nKrause's endbulbs (named after Wilhelm Krause, b. 1833), or mucocutaneous receptors, are encapsulated endings in dermis, especially associated with lips, genital regions, nipples, and conjunctiva.\n\nRuffini endings (named after Angelo Ruffini, b. 1864) have numerous fine branches from a single axon within the fluid-filled space of a single thin capsule.\n\nHair follicle receptors are unencapsulated nerve endings wrapped around hair follicles.\n\nThe distribution of sensory nerve endings varies from place to place in the body (see regional differences).\n\nExcept for the characteristic capsules of Meissner's and Pacinian corpuscles, nerve endings are inconspicuous in ordinary histological preparations of skin.\n\nSpecial stains are generally used to observe nerve endings. And except for the conspicuously encapsulated endings of Meissner's and Pacinian corpuscles, the functional details of most sensory endings remain obscure. For more information on tactile sensation, see Principles of Neural Science by Kandel, Schwartz and Jessel.\n\nPeripheral nerves (i.e., bundles of axons, within a connective tissue sheath or epineurium) can often be found in dermis, with smaller branches toward the surface (i.e., often near sweat glands or hair follicles) and larger branches in deeper layers (often running parallel to blood vessels). The following examples show nerves in dermis.\n\nTOP OF PAGE\n\nSkin vasculature\n\nThe papillary layer of the dermis is richly supplied with capillaries, while larger blood vessels may be found in deeper levels of the dermis.\n\nSince the skin does not have a very high metabolic demand for nutrients and oxygen, this rich vascular network serves mainly for regulation of body temperature. Essentially, regulation of the amount of blood flowing through superficial capillaries allows for either conservation or dissipation of body heat.\n\nArteriovenous shunts, controlled by associated sphincters, allow blood to bypass capillaries and flow directly from arteries into veins. These shunts occur in both deep and superficial dermis."
