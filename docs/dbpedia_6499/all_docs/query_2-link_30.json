        "text": "Cell types\n\nThe epidermis is made up a variety of cell types. Cell that contain keratin are known as keratinocytes. These are stratified squamous epithelial cells that are shed from the surface of the skin daily. They are the progeny of cells in the basal layer.\n\nThere are also mature non-keratinocytes that exist in the epidermis. These include the melanocytes (which are derived from embryonic neural crest), and lymphocytes and Langerhans cells that arise from bone marrow dendritic cells. As stated earlier, melanocytes synthesize and store melanin, which not only contributes to the color of the skin and hair, but also provides protection against ultraviolet radiation. They appear as clear cells in the basal layer with large, round, euchromatic nuclei. It is possible for a single melanocyte to provide melanin for approximately 30 keratinocytes via its dendritic arborisation.\n\nThe Langerhans cells serve as antigen presenting cells. They are distributed throughout the strata spinosum and basale, sparing only the sweat glands. These cells can be readily identified by a hallmark tennis racket-like discoid Birbeck granule, in addition to its euchromatic cytoplasm and Golgi complex.\n\nThere are also mechanoreceptors within the epidermis that facilitate sensory perception. The Merkel cells are clear, ovoid and may occur singly or in clusters in the stratum basale. Free nerve endings in the form of expanded discs are present at the base of these cells. Merkel cells may act as a sensory mechanoreceptors and are also thought to function as neuroendocrine sensory receptors.\n\nLayers\n\nThe histological composition of the five layers of the epidermis is as follows:\n\nStratum basale\n\n​Stratum basale acts as the stem cell region for the epidermis. It consists of a mixture of simple cuboidal to columnar epithelium resting on a basement membrane. Compared to the cytoplasm, the nuclei of these cells are large, euchromatic, with prominent nucleoli giving a marked basophilia to this layer.\n\nThe basement membrane serves as the point of demarcation between the epidermis and the dermis (i.e. the dermo-epidermal junction). The cells of the stratum basale are anchored to adjacent cells via desmosomes and to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes. As these highly mitotic cells replicate, they ascend the layers of the dermis; carrying intermediate keratin filaments. Only the Merkel cells are attached to adjacent keratinocytes via desmosomes in this layer. The Langerhans cells and melanocytes do not have these connections.\n\nStratum spinosum\n\nMost of the cells ascending from the stratum basale to enter the stratum spinosum are post-mitotic cells and are committed to becoming mature keratinocytes. However, there are a few stem cells in the basal region of the stratum spinosum that contribute to ascending progeny that replenish exfoliated cells of the superficial layers. There are approximately 4-6 layers of cuboidal or slightly flattened cells in this region that are tapered at the point of attachment to adjacent cells via desmosomes.\n\nThe prickled appearance of the cells arises during histological preparation, where the cells shrink away from each other except at points of attachment to neighbouring cells. The cytoplasm contains a concentric arrangement of keratin filaments that circumscribe the nucleus and form attachments to the desmosomes. Melanosomes can also be found in the cytoplasm of these cells as well. It is not uncommon to find Langerhans cells and lymphocytes in the prickled layer, but these are the only non-keratinocytes that will be observed histologically in this area (under normal circumstances).\n\nStratum granulosum\n\nDuring the upward migration from the stratum spinosum, the cells of the stratum granulosum become flattened polygonal and form two to three layers of pyknotic cells. Recall that pyknosis is a characteristic feature of apoptosis (and necrosis) in which the nuclear material condenses. Karyorrhexis (disintegration of the nucleus) subsequently ensues.\n\nThe keratohyalin granules appear as dense basophilic structures in the cytoplasm. The keratinocyte also contains Odland bodies, which are lamellar secretory organelles that are also found in type II pneumocytes. They release their hydrophobic glycophospholipid content into the intracellular compartment by fusing with the keratinocyte’s plasma membrane. This contributes to the selective permeability of the skin; making it relatively waterproof. As the cellular organelles break down, the keratin tonofilaments interact with keratohyalin granules to produce keratin. This keratin is usually the soft keratin of the skin (as opposed to hard keratin of the hair and nails).\n\nStratum lucidum\n\nThe stratum lucidum is an epidermal layer only appreciated in glabrous skin. Here, a translucent layer of cells lie above the stratum granulosum and below the stratum corneum. The cells are filled with keratin filaments and are devoid of nuclei and organelles.\n\nStratum corneum\n\nFinally, the stratum corneum is the most superficial layer of the skin. It is designed to withstand repetitive insults in order to protect the deeper structures. The cells of this 15-20 layered stratum are dead, non nucleated, filled with soft keratin filaments, and referred to as squames (owing to their flattened appearance). There is considerable overlapping at the lateral extent of the squames where there is interlocking of adjacent cells. The squames are continuously lost from the skin surface and replaced by new cells emerging from the basal layer. The sheets of glycolipid released from the Odland bodies of the granular layer fill the intercellular spaces of the cornified layer.\n\nMnemonic\n\nIf remembering all these layers seems like a daunting prospective a mnemonic can help! Just memorise 'British & Spanish Grannies Love Cornflakes', which covers the following structures:\n\nStratum Basale\n\nStratum Spinosum\n\nStratum Granulosum\n\nStratum Lucidum\n\nStratum Corneum\n\nLayers\n\nPapillary layer\n\nThere are two definitive layers of the dermis. The more superficial of the two is the papillary layer. It is characterized by dermal papillae, which are raised irregular projections that interlace with the epidermal ridges of the epidermis. Apically, the papillae are blunted and can be separated into cusps. They are less abundant and smaller in thin skin that has minimal mechanical stress, when compared to in areas of thicker skin (i.e. palms and soles), where they tend to form curved parallel lines.\n\nFine type III collagen is typically found in throughout this layer (especially in the perivascular regions) of the dermis. Keratinocytes of the basal layer are attached to the fibrous matrix in the papillary layer through connections to hemidesmosomes. Subsequently, the hemi-desmosomes are attached to the type VII collagen fibrils through the anchoring filaments of the basal membrane. The type VII collagen runs deep in the papillary dermis and therefore provides mechanical stability to the epidermal substratum. Overall, the papillary layer not only gives mechanical support to the epidermis, but it also provides metabolic sustenance as well.\n\nReticular layer\n\nDeep to the papillary layer is the reticular layer of the dermis. There is no clear demarcation between the two structures. Unlike the papillary layer, the reticular layer contains mostly coarse type I fibers with variable number of elastic fibers. There is significant interaction between the type I and type III fibres in both layers to the point where a sturdy, yet malleable, lattice is formed.\n\nIn 1861, Karl Langer (an Austrian anatomist) discovered the now widely accepted Langer’s lines. These topographical landmarks are used in surgical procedures as guidelines for points of incisions. Otherwise known as cleavage lines, these markings correspond with the orientation of dermal collagen fibres. Incision along these lines result in healing with minimal scarring and subsequently, a less apparent postoperative scar.\n\nHypodermis\n\nFinally, the dermis rests on a layer of loose connective tissue known as the hypodermis. It is a superficial fascial sheath with interspersed adipose tissue (panniculus adiposus). The fascia reduces the friction between the dermis and deeper musculature, while the adipose tissue participates in thermoregulatory mechanisms as well as disperses forces generated from direct impact.\n\nThere is geographical variation in the distribution of superficial adipose tissue, as those individuals living in colder climate tend to have a larger quantity of fat than those living in warmer climates. However, the amount of subcutaneous fat present in an individual is an indication of that person’s lipid stores, and by extension, their dietary consumption of lipids. A small bundle of smooth muscles called arrector pili muscle that serves to connect the deep part of hair follicle with superficial dermis originates in this layer. Contraction of these muscles due to extreme fright or cold causes the erection of hair and puckering of skin commonly known as goose bumps.\n\nClinical significance\n\nDermatology nomenclature\n\nDermatology is the medical discipline dedicated to understanding pathologies and treatment of the integumentary system. Like any discipline, it has an associated nomenclature that makes communication much more simple. In describing “rashes”, the location, texture, color, margins and size are all important factors to be considered. Some of these characteristics can be summed up into single words. For example:\n\nA macule is a flat lesion that is less than 1 cm in diameter, while a patch is also a flat lesion, but is greater than 1 cm in diameter.\n\nA papule on the other hand, is a solid, raised lesion that is less than 1 cm in diameter. Its counterpart – the plaque – is also solid and raised, but has a diameter greater than 1 cm.\n\nVesicles are elevated, fluid filled lesions that are less than 0.5 cm in diameter. They are similar to bullae, which have the same physical descriptions, but are greater than 0.5 cm in diameter. Both these terms have been used interchangeably with blisters.\n\nIf a lesion is solid, elevated, circumscribed and greater than 1 cm, then it is a nodule.\n\nDesquamation imbalance\n\nA relative equilibrium exists between the stratum basale and the stratum corneum such that the rate of production of keratinocytes is roughly equal to the rate of desquamation. The process of desquamation is usually subtle and occurs without knowledge of the host. A large percentage of household dust is comprised of exfoliated squames. Conditions that result in excessive desquamation (seborrheic dermatitis manifesting as dandruff or post-sunburn peeling of the skin) make the process more perceptible. Either a decrease in the rate of desquamation or an increase in the basal layer activity can result in increased thickness of the cornified layer. This is particularly apparent on the soles of the feet of individuals who walk barefoot frequently or as palmar calluses in individuals who do a lot of manual labour.\n\nPsoriasis\n\nPsoriasis vulgaris is a common example of a hyperactive basal layer lesion. It is a non-contagious, multisystemic, inflammatory disorder of the skin that undergoes undulating periods of remission and relapsing. Patients often present with pruritic (itchy), erythematous (red), exfoliative (scaly) plaques with a pathognomonic silver covering. The lesions are commonly seen on the extensor surfaces of the limbs (i.e. elbows and knees), lumbosacral region, intergluteal cleft and at times on the glans penis.\n\nPsoriasis undoubtedly has an overt genetic component to its aetiology (human leukocyte antigens (HLA) Cw6, B13, B17 and B17 have been implicated). However it is truly multifactorial as environmental and immunological factors can contribute to its occurrence.\n\nWhile the exact mechanism of how this disease occurs is still being worked out, there is discussion surrounding the role of the host immune system in the development of the disease. It has been proposed that there is a stressor (infection, trauma, drugs or idiopathic in most cases) that precipitates large scale activation of T-lymphocytes present in the epidermis (normally found in the strata basale and spinosum). This T-cell activation occurs in response to cytokine release from native keratinocytes. Cytokines also stimulate differentiation of local Langerhans’ cells, which in turn drive the proliferation of T-cells. The excess cytokine and inflammatory mediators in turn upregulates the cell cycle of the keratinocytes such that the epidermis exfoliates every 4 days, as opposed to the typical 26 day cycle. As a consequence of the epidermal hyperplasia, immature cells ascend the layers of the epidermis that have poor intracellular adhesion, as well as poor water barriers.\n\nAlbinism\n\nThere are several disorders that can alter the concentration of melanin within the skin. Either congenital or acquired disease may result in an increase in the pigmentation (hyperpigmented) or a decrease in the amount of pigment (hypopigmentation). Albinism is a well known autosomal recessive phenomenon that results in global absence of pigment. The genetic mutation is associated with abnormalities of the tyrosinase enzyme, which is necessary for melanin production.\n\nIn addition to the absence of pigment in the integumentary system, patients also lack colour in the iris. The latter significantly affects their visual acuity and results in marked photophobia in these patients. The absence of melanin increases the risk of development of cancers in this patient population.\n\nIt should also be noted that there is an autosomal dominant variation of albinism known as piebaldism or partial albinism. These patients have characteristic patches of depigmented skin along with a patch of white hair in the front of their heads. In both cases, there is no cure. However, patients with albinism should be monitored regularly for cutaneous malignancies and should use UV protection (no less than sun protection factor [SPF] 30).\n\nAlthough unlikely, piebaldism should not be confused with vitiligo. The latter is thought to results from an autoimmune reaction against melanocytes, resulting in well demarcated patches of depigmentation. However, the definitive pathophysiology is unknown. The patches usually arise in periorificial areas (i.e. around the eyes, mouth, nipples, umbilicus and anogenital orifices) as well as at the tips of fingers and toes. The depigmentation can arise in other areas of the body. In some cases, patients with vitiligo also have another autoimmune disorder (i.e. Grave’s disease, pernicious anemia or myasthenia gravis, to name a few). While some patients spontaneously regain pigment in the affected areas, others require treatment that is not universally successful. They will require photoprotection in affected areas. Some individuals benefit from very potent topical steroids, while others settle for cosmesis. Some individuals with extensive vitiligo (like the late king of pop - Michael Jackson) resort to bleaching normally pigmented skin to achieve homogeneity."
