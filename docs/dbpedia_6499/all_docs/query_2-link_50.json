But some skin products you use may be harming and weakening this layer.\n\nThe stratum corneum is the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). It serves as the primary barrier between the body and the environment.\n\nThe epidermis is made up of five layers:\n\nstratum basale: the deepest layer of epidermis, made up of cuboidal and columnar cells\n\nstratum spinosum: made up of skin cells that are connected by desmosomes giving these cells a spiny appearance under a microscope\n\nstratum granulosum: made up of skin cells with granules containing components that contribute to the formation of the outer skin layer\n\nstratum lucidum: thin, lighter appearing layer only present on the palms and soles\n\nstratum corneum: the outermost layer of skin, made up of layers of very resilient and specialized skin cells and keratin\n\nThe stratum corneum consists of a series of layers of specialized skin cells that are continuously shedding. It’s also called the horny layer, as the cells are tougher than most, like an animal’s horn. The stratum corneum exists to protect the inner layers of skin.\n\nMost areas of the stratum corneum are about 20 layers of cells thick. Areas of skin like your eyelids can be thinner, while other layers such as your hands and heels may be thicker.\n\nYour skin is the biggest organ system in your body. The most important function of the skin is to protect the body from things in the environment that may cause harm.\n\nThe skin helps to\n\nkeep your body temperature at a healthy level\n\nprevent water loss or absorption\n\nThe stratum corneum is sometimes described as a brick wall. The corneocytes that make up the cell envelope are layers, like bricks, mortared together by lipids, that create the outer water barrier.\n\nIf everything is working properly in the stratum corneum, the skin layer will help defend you against:\n\ndehydration\n\ntoxins\n\nbacteria\n\nAt the same time, it’s protecting the skin layers underneath.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the products that you use to clean your body can harm the stratum corneum.\n\nSurfactants, such as hand soap, will bind to the proteins in the skin and allow water loss through the skin and weaken the barrier created.\n\nUsing sensitive soap, such as an unscented bar soap, and not over-washing is suggested. Using moisturizers can also help to prevent your skin from drying out as well.\n\nShop for unscented bar soap online.\n\nParts of the stratum corneum\n\nThe stratum corneum is made up of many parts to help protect your lower skin layers. Although the structure could be described in vastly greater detail, for ease of basic understanding, you can focus on three primary categories.\n\nThe bricks\n\nThe bricks, also called corneocytes, are mostly made up of keratin. Keratin is a protein also found in hair and nails.\n\nKeratinocytes are created in the lower layers of the epidermis and operate with a phospholipid cell membrane, which can be quite permeable. When the keratinocytes are pushed to the stratum corneum, they’re transformed into corneocytes with a more durable cell envelope.\n\nA healthy stratum corneum will shed approximately one layer of corneocytes each day. The corneocytes will then be replaced with new keratinocytes from a lower layer of the epidermis called the stratum granulosum.\n\nThe desmosomes\n\nThe desmosomes serve to connect the bricks by joining the corneocytes together. These are formed via connections of proteins such as corneodesmosin.\n\nIn order for the bricks to shed at a healthy rate, enzymes must dissolve the desmosomes.\n\nThe mortar\n\nThe mortar that secures everything in place is made out of lipids that have been released from tiny lamellar bodies that are present in the stratum granulosum. The lipids float into the space between the bricks and between the layers of corneocytes.\n\nThe mortar is very important in protecting the lower layers of the skin. It creates the barrier that keeps out bacteria and toxins.\n\nThe mortar and whole of the stratum corneum are slightly acidic due to cellular processes that work to produce the lipids. The stratum corneum has a pH of around 4 to 5.5. The acidity helps to prevent bacteria growth."
