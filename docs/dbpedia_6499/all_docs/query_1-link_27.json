        "text": "Pre-Lab Reading\n\nIntroduction\n\nEpithelia are tissues composed of closely aggregated cells that cover most body surfaces, cavities, and tubes. These include the outer surface of the body (skin), tracts traversing the body (gastrointestinal tract), dead-end tracts that have openings at the body surface (respiratory, urinary, and genital tracts), and ducts that open into these tracts (exocrine glands). The functions of epithelia are numerous, and a single epithelium may have several functions. The most important of these include physical protection and selective transport (diffusion, absorption, secretion).\n\nBasic Structure of Epithelia\n\nSurface epithelia form continuous sheets that can have one or multiple cell layers. Several different types of cell junctions mediate physical strength and cell communication within the epithelium. A basement membrane lies beneath the epithelium and separates it from underlying tissue; because blood vessels do not penetrate the basement membrane, nutrients like oxygen and metabolites reach the epithelium by diffusion. Epithelia are polarized, with an apical surface that faces the external environment and a basal surface that faces the basement membrane.\n\nHistological Classification of Epithelia\n\nThe most common manner of classifying epithelia is based on three criteria:\n\nNumber of Cell Layers. Simple epithelia comprise a single layer of cells. Stratified epithelia comprise two or more layers. Pseudostratified epithelia are simple epithelia that appear to be stratified when they are viewed in section, even though they are truly simple epithelia.\n\nShape of Cells. In squamous epithelia, the outermost layer is flattened. A cuboidal epithelium is characterized by cells that are as tall as they are wide. When these cells are taller than they are wide, they make up a columnar epithelium. Stratified epithelia are named after the shape of their most superficial layer of cells. A transitional epithelium is a type of stratified epithelium that has cells with shapes that fall between cuboidal and squamous. Transitional epithelia are specialized to deal with stretch and to serve as a barrier against toxicity.\n\nSurface Specializations. It is customary to take note of the surface specializations of epithelia, which allow them to perform their function as a selective permeability barrier. These specializations can be located on one of the three surfaces of an epithelial cell.\n\nApical Specializations\n\nThe apical surfaces of epithelial cells frequently feature three surface specializations:\n\nMicrovilli are small processes that project from the apical surface of most types of epithelial cells, greatly increasing the surface area. They are notably found at the intestinal brush border and in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney.\n\nStereocilia are unusually long, non-motile microvilli that are found on the surface epithelium in the epididymis and ductus deferens.\n\nCilia are actively motile processes with a complex internal structure found on the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract and the female reproductive tract.\n\nLateral Specializations\n\nThe lateral surfaces of epithelial cells that are adjacent to their neighbors are usually separated by a space of 20 nanometers and may show several specializations\n\nTight junctions, or zonula occludens, block the movement of extracellular molecules between adjacent cells and maintain the polarity of the cell membrane. For example, the tight junctions located beneath the luminal surface of the simple columnar epithelium of the intestine prevent the contents of the gut from penetrating the cell lining. Tight junctions are composed of proteins known as claudins and occludins.\n\nAdhering junctions, or zonula adherens, provide strength to the epithelium by linking the actin cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. They are located just beneath the zonula occludens and form a continuous contractile band around the cell. The zonula adherens is composed of transmembrane proteins called cadherins, whose cytoplasmic tails bind to anchor proteins in an intracellular plaque.\n\nDesmosomes, or macula adherens, are typically located deep to adhering junctions and are abundant in stratified epithelia exposed to stress. Cadherins are also the transmembrane proteins of desmosomes, but the intracellular segment binds to intermediate filaments instead of actin.\n\nGap junctions allow for the passage of small molecules and nutrients between adjacent cells in order to coordinate the functions of the epithelium. They are composed of transmembrane connexin proteins that together form connexons. Multiple connexons from two adjacent cells align to form the gap junction.\n\nThe combination of the zonula occludens, zonula adherens, and macula adherens is known as the junctional complex. This unit divides the plasma membrane into apical and basolateral surfaces. An electron microscope is necessary to see the individual components; with the light microscope, this region is visualized as a terminal bar."
