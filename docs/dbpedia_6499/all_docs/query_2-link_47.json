        "text": "Msx2 Prevents Stratified Squamous Epithelium Formation in the Enamel Organ.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakatomi, M; Ida-Yonemochi, H; Nakatomi, C; Saito, K; Kenmotsu, S; Maas, R L; Ohshima, H\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTooth enamel is manufactured by the inner enamel epithelium of the multilayered enamel organ. Msx2 loss-of-function mutation in a mouse model causes an abnormal accumulation of epithelial cells in the enamel organ, but the underlying mechanism by which Msx2 regulates amelogenesis is poorly understood. We therefore performed detailed histological and molecular analyses of Msx2 null mice. Msx2 null ameloblasts and stratum intermedium (SI) cells differentiated normally in the early stages of amelogenesis. However, during subsequent developmental stages, the outer enamel epithelium (OEE) became highly proliferative and transformed into a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that ectopically expressed stratified squamous epithelium markers, including Heat shock protein 25, Loricrin, and Keratin 10. Moreover, expression of hair follicle-specific keratin genes such as Keratin 26 and Keratin 73 was upregulated in the enamel organ of Msx2 mutants. With the accumulation of keratin in the stellate reticulum (SR) region and subsequent odontogenic cyst formation, SI cells gradually lost the ability to differentiate, and the expression of Sox2 and Notch1 was downregulated, leading to ameloblast depolarization. As a consequence, the organization of the Msx2 mutant enamel organ became disturbed and enamel failed to form in the normal location. Instead, there was ectopic mineralization that likely occurred within the SR. In summary, we show that during amelogenesis, Msx2 executes a bipartite function, repressing the transformation of OEE into a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium while simultaneously promoting the development of a properly differentiated enamel organ competent for enamel formation.\n\nIdentification of Distinct Layers Within the Stratified Squamous Epithelium of the Adult Human True Vocal Fold\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDowdall, Jayme R.; Sadow, Peter M.; Hartnick, Christopher; Vinarsky, Vladimir; Mou, Hongmei; Zhao, Rui; Song, Phillip C.; Franco, Ramon A.; Rajagopal, Jayaraj\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives/Hypothesis A precise molecular schema for classifying the different cell types of the normal human vocal fold epithelium is lacking. We hypothesize that the true vocal fold epithelium has a cellular architecture and organization similar to that of other stratified squamous epithelia including the skin, cornea, oral mucosa, and esophagus. In analogy to disorders of the skin and gastrointestinal tract, a molecular definition of the normal cell types within the human vocal fold epithelium and a description of their geometric relationships should serve as a foundation for characterizing cellular changes associated with metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer. Study Design Qualitative study with adult human larynges. Methods Histologic sections of normal human laryngeal tissue were analyzed for morphology (hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemical protein expression profile, including cytokeratins (CK13 and CK14), cornified envelope proteins (involucrin), basal cells (NGFR/p75), and proliferation markers (Ki67). Results We demonstrated that three distinct cell strata with unique marker profiles are present within the stratified squamous epithelium of the true vocal fold. We used these definitions to establish that cell proliferation is restricted to certain cell types and layers within the epithelium. These distinct cell types are reproducible across five normal adult larynges. Conclusion We have established that three layers of cells are present within the normal adult stratified squamous epithelium of the true vocal fold. Furthermore, replicating cell populations are largely restricted to the parabasal strata within the epithelium. This delineation of distinct cell populations will facilitate future studies of vocal fold regeneration and cancer. Level of Evidence N/A.

We have found that the stratified squamous epithelium of the nonsecreting area of horse stomach is colonized by gram-positive rods. The microscopic features of a dense layer of these bacteria on the epithelium were found to be similar to those reported in mice, rats, and swine. Adhering microorganisms were isolated and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, L. crispatus, L. reuteri, and L. agilis by DNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing techniques. These lactobacilli associated with the horse, except for L. reuteri, were found to adhere to horse epithelial cells in vitro but not to those of rats. A symbiotic relationship of these lactobacilli with the horse is suggested.

Recently, the diagnosis of âepidermoid cystâ has been proposed. A case of squamous metaplasia of the rete ovarii in a Zebu cow is described in this report. Case presentation A crossbreed Zebu cow had both ovaries enlarged with multiple cysts. Most cysts were lined by well differentiated keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium and filled with keratinized lamellar material. Some cysts were lined by an epithelial layer that ranged from single cuboidal, double cuboidal epithelium, stratified non keratinized epithelium, and areas of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium. Single or double layered cuboidal epithelia of the cysts expressed low molecular weight cytokeratin 7, whose expression was absent in the keratinizing stratified squamous epithelia of same cysts. Conversely, high molecular weight cytokeratins 1, 5, 10, and 14 were strongly expressed by the keratinizing stratified epithelium. Conclusion Squamous metaplasia of the rete ovarii was diagnosed. Squamous metaplasia of the rete ovarii, may account for some of the previously described squamous lesions in the ovary, which may have been misinterpreted as teratoma or epidermoid cysts.

However, there is no agreement about the epithelium of the anal canal, the anal transitional zone (ATZ) epithelium in particular. The aim of this study is to clarify the structure of the epithelium of the human lower rectum and anal canal. Intact rectum and anus obtained from patients who underwent surgery for rectal carcinoma were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy (LM and SEM). By LM, three types of epithelium were observed in the anal canal: simple columnar epithelium, stratified squamous epithelium, and stratified columnar epithelium. The lower rectum was composed of simple columnar epithelium. SEM findings showed stratified squamous epithelium that consisted of squamous cells with microridges, changing to simple columnar epithelium consisting of columnar cells with short microvilli at the anorectal line. LM and SEM observations in a one-to-one ratio revealed that the area of stratified columnar epithelium based on LM corresponded to the anal crypt and sinus. In conclusion, the epithelium of the human anal canal was fundamentally composed of simple columnar epithelium and stratified squamous epithelium. We found no evidence of the ATZ.\n\nA Comparative Immunohistochemical Study of Anal Canal Epithelium in Humans and Swine, Focusing on the Anal Transitional Zone Epithelium and the Anal Glands.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuranaka, Futoshi; Nakajima, Tomoyuki; Iwaya, Mai; Ishii, Keiko; Higuchi, Kayoko; Ogiwara, Naoko; Miyagawa, Shinichi; Ota, Hiroyoshi\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTo better understand the cellular origins and differentiation of anal canal epithelial neoplasms, the immunohistochemical profiles of the anal canal epithelium in humans and swine were evaluated. Formalin-fixed tissue sections were immunostained for mucin (MUC: MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B), desmoglein 3 (DGS3), p63, CDX2, SOX2, and Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA). The anal transitional zone (ATZ) epithelium covered the anal sinus and consisted of a stratified epithelium with mucous cells interspersed within the surface lining. Anal glands opened into the anal sinus. Ducts and acini of intraepithelial or periepithelial mucous type were the main structures of human anal glands, whereas those of swine were compound tubuloacinar mixed glands. Distal to the ATZ epithelium, non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium merged with the keratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the perianal skin. MUC5AC expression predominated over MUC5B expression in the ATZ epithelium, while MUC5B expression was higher in the anal glands. SOX2 was positive in the ATZ epithelium, anal glands, and squamous epithelium except in the perianal skin. In humans, DGS3 was expressed in the ATZ epithelium, anal gland ducts, and squamous epithelium. p63 was detected in the ATZ epithelium, anal glands, and squamous epithelium. Myoepithelial cells positive for Î±-SMA and p63 were present in the anal glands of swine. Colorectal columnar cells were MUC5B + /MUC2 + /CDX2 + /MUC5AC - /SOX2 - . The ATZ epithelium seems to be a distinctive epithelium, with morphological and functional features allowing smooth defecation. The MUC5AC + /SOX2 + /MUC2 - /CDX2 - profile of the ATZ epithelium and anal glands is a useful feature for diagnosing adenocarcinoma arising from these regions. Anat Rec, 301:796-805, 2018.

Full-thickness lower lips taken from 31 cadavers were analysed. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), cytokeratins (CK), loricrin, involucrin, profilaggrin and filaggrin. The stratified squamous epithelium covering the lip could be divided into: (i) appendage-bearing, orthokeratinised epidermis; (ii) orthokeratinised vermilion which had a more prominent rete pattern than the epidermis; (iii) parakeratinised, PAS-positive intermediate zone; and (iv) non- or parakeratinised labial mucosal epithelium. Epithelial thickness increased gradually from the skin to the mucosal aspect. The CK pattern changed across the intermediate zone, with gradual loss of CK 1 and 10 from the skin, and CK 4, 13 and 19 from the mucosal, aspect. CK 5 and 14 were consistently expressed basally, and variably expressed suprabasally. Apart from labelling Merkel cells, CK 8, 18 and 20 were negative. Involucrin, which was present at all sites, was restricted to the stratum granulosum in skin, but extended into the stratum spinosum, and gradually into parabasal keratinocytes, across the vermilion and mucosa. Loricrin, profilaggrin and filaggrin were present in the stratum granulosum of orthokeratinised sites, but expression was abruptly lost at the junction between the vermilion and the intermediate zone. In conclusion, the phenotype of the stratified squamous epithelium covering the lip changes at, or across, the intermediate zone of the adult vermilion. It is possible that changes in the composition of the stratified squamous epithelium affect the colour of the vermilion.\n\nThe initial establishment and epithelial morphogenesis of the esophagus: a new model of trachealâesophageal separation and transition of simple columnar into stratified squamous epithelium in the developing esophagus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nQue, Jianwen\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe esophagus and trachea are tubular organs that initially share a single common lumen in the anterior foregut. Several models have been proposed to explain how this single-lumen developmental intermediate generates two tubular organs. However, new evidence suggests that these models are not comprehensive. I will first briefly review these models and then propose a novel âsplitting and extensionâ model based on our in vitro modeling of the foregut separation process. Signaling molecules (e.g., SHHs, WNTs, BMPs) and transcription factors (e.g., NKX2.1 and SOX2) are critical for the separation of the foregut. Intriguingly, some of these molecules continue to play essential roles during the transition of simple columnar into stratified squamous epithelium in the developing esophagus, and they are also closely involved in epithelial maintenance in the adults. Alterations in the levels of these molecules have been associated with the initiation and progression of several esophageal diseases and cancer in adults.

An immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nFetissof, F; Arbeille, B; Boivin, F; Sam-Giao, M; Henrion, C; Lansac, J\n\n1987-01-01\n\nA systematic study of endocrine cells in the ectocervix was carried out using histochemical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Serotonin and calcitonin immunoreactive cells were demonstrated in this site. Serotonin and calcitonin immunoreactivities were coexpressed in the same endocrine cell. These distinctive cells were encountered in two main morphological varieties of ectocervical epithelium. Normal-appearing stratified squamous epithelium contained only very rare serotonin and calcitonin cells. In contrast, endocrine cells were fairly abundant in a specific epithelium termed \"transitional-like\". This type of epithelium was not only confined to the transformation zone but could also extend onto the portio as far as the vaginal cut margin. In some cases, transitional-like epithelium bore morphological resemblance to urothelium. In other cases, it could be regarded as basal cell hyperplasia or immature squamous metaplasia. Of interest, serotonin and calcitonin cells have been well-documented as normal inhabitants of some other non-squamous epithelia, such as urothelium or pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Therefore, it is suggested that certain ectocervical epithelia show some similarities to urothelium, in respect of their morphological appearance and endocrine profile. Further investigations using more objective and specific markers of urothelial cells are needed to assess the exact degree of homology connecting all these types of epithelium.\n\nUnusual epithelium in a subpubic sinus.\n\nPubMed\n\nChao, Hong-Ming; Chuang, Chia-Jueng; Chen, Ke-Chi; Chu, Chih-Chun; Chou, Jung-Mao\n\n2002-09-01\n\nA 5-year-old male presented with the history of whitish discharge from a midline sinus opening just above the pubis for 2 months. Attempted radiography of the sinus revealed a blind fistula and voiding cystourethrography was normal. The fistula was excised deep to the subpubic space without any evidence of connection to the lower urinary tract. Pathologic evaluation of the lesion revealed a ciliated-columnar lining with stratified-squamous and transitional epithelium. To our knowledge, a subpubic sinus with this unique presentation of epithelium has not been reported previously.\n\nDistribution and ultrastructural characteristics of dark cells in squamous metaplasias of the respiratory tract epithelium.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKlein-Szanto, A. J.; Nettesheim, P.; Pine, A.; Martin, D.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nDark epithelial basal cells were found in both carcinogen-induced and non-carcinogen-induced squamous metaplasias of the tracheal epithelium. Formaldehyde-induced squamous metaplasias exhibited 4% dark cells in the basal layer. Metaplasias induced by vitamin A deficiency and those induced by dimethylbenz(alpha)anthracene (DMBA) without atypia showed 18--20% basal dark cells. DMBA-induced metaplasias with moderate to severe atypia exhibited 50% basal dark cells. The labeling index of basal cells in metaplastic epithelia, regardless of the inducing agent, was 16--18%, ie, the same as that of the normal esophageal stratified squamous epithelium. The percentage of labeled dark basal cells per total dark cell population was approximately 19% in the non-carcinogen-induced metaplasias and in the DMBA-induced metaplasias without atypia. In the atypical metaplasias induced by DMA this percentage increased to 26. On the basis of ultrastructural observations, five types of dark epithelial cells could be distinguished in the metaplastic epithelia: Type I (ovoid or fusiform dark cell with abundant cytoplasmic filaments, desmosomes, and free ribosomes--dark keratinocyte type); Type II (ovoid or spherical small cell with scant cytoplasm with few organelles--basal respiratory type); Type III (irregular or ovoid, few cytoplasmic filaments and organelles and desmosomes, extremely abundant free ribosomes--dedifferentiated type); Type IV (fusiform or ovoid, large mitochondria, prominent ergastoplasm, secretion droplets--mucous cell type); and type V (irregular shape, organelle remnants, vacuoles, pyknotic nuclei--involutional-cell type). Type I was the predominant cell type in formaldehyde-induced metaplasias and was also commonly seen in DMBA-induced metaplasias without atypia. Type II predominated in metaplasias induced by vitamin A deficiency. Type III was seen in DMBA-induced metaplasias and was the predominant cell type in the atypical epithelial alterations. Type IV cells\n\nAPR-246/PRIMA-1Met Inhibits and Reverses Squamous Metaplasia in Human Conjunctival Epithelium.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jing; Li, Cheng; Wang, Guoliang; Liu, Zhen; Chen, Pei; Yang, Qichen; Dong, Nuo; Wu, Huping; Liu, Zuguo; Li, Wei\n\n2016-02-01\n\nSquamous metaplasia is a common pathologic condition in ocular surface diseases for which there is no therapeutic medication in clinic. In this study, we investigated the effect of a small molecule, APR-246/PRIMA-1(Met), on squamous metaplasia in human conjunctival epithelium. Human conjunctival explants were cultured for up to 12 days under airlifting conditions. Epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation were assessed by Cytokeratin 10 (K10), K14, K19, Pax6, MUC5AC, and p63 immunostaining patterns. Î²-catenin and TCF-4 immunofluorescent staining and real-time PCR characterized Wnt signaling pathway involvement. Pterygium clinical samples were cultured under airlifting conditions with or without APR-246 for 4 days. p63, K10, Î²-catenin, and TCF-4 expression in pterygial epithelium was determined by immunofluorescent staining and real-time PCR. Airlift conjunctival explants resulted in increased stratification and intrastromal epithelial invagination. Such pathology was accompanied by increases in K10, K14, and p63 expression, whereas K19 and Pax6 levels declined when compared to those in freshly isolated tissue. On the other hand, APR-246 reversed all of these declines in K10, K14, and p63 expression. Furthermore, K19 and Pax6 increased along with rises in goblet cell density. These effects of APR-246 were accompanied by near restoration of normal conjunctival epithelial histology. APR-246 also reversed squamous metaplasia in pterygial epithelium that had developed after 4 days in ex vivo culture. Reductions in squamous metaplasia induced by APR-246 suggest it may provide a novel therapeutic approach in different squamous metaplasia-associated ocular surface diseases.\n\nReference spectra from squamous epithelium and connective tissue allow whole section proteomics analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoesch-Ely, Mariana; SchnÃ¶lzer, Martina; Nees, Matthias; Plinkert, Peter K; Bosch, Franz X\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe reasoned that micro-dissection of tumour cells for protein expression studies should be omitted since tumour-stroma interactions are an important part of the biology of solid tumours. To study such interactions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) development, we generated reference protein spectra for normal squamous epithelium and connective tissue by SELDI-TOF-MS. Calgranulins A and B, Annexin1 and Histone H4 were found to be strongly enriched in the epithelium. The alpha-defensins 1-3 and the haemoglobin subunits were identified in the connective tissue. Tumour-distant epithelia, representing early pre-malignant lesions, showed up-regulated expression of the stromal alpha-defensins, whereas the epithelial Annexin 1 was down-regulated. Thus, tumour microenvironment interactions occur very early in the carcinogenic process. These data demonstrate that omitting micro-dissection is actually beneficial for studying changes in protein expression during development and progression of solid tumours.\n\nHydrodynamics of stratified epithelium: Steady state and linearized dynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYeh, Wei-Ting; Chen, Hsuan-Yi\n\n2016-05-01\n\nA theoretical model for stratified epithelium is presented. The viscoelastic properties of the tissue are assumed to be dependent on the spatial distribution of proliferative and differentiated cells. Based on this assumption, a hydrodynamic description of tissue dynamics at the long-wavelength, long-time limit is developed, and the analysis reveals important insights into the dynamics of an epithelium close to its steady state. When the proliferative cells occupy a thin region close to the basal membrane, the relaxation rate towards the steady state is enhanced by cell division and cell apoptosis. On the other hand, when the region where proliferative cells reside becomes sufficiently thick, a flow induced by cell apoptosis close to the apical surface enhances small perturbations. This destabilizing mechanism is general for continuous self-renewal multilayered tissues; it could be related to the origin of certain tissue morphology, tumor growth, and the development pattern.\n\nHow good is the neosquamous epithelium?\n\nPubMed\n\nOrlando, Roy C\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEndoscopic radiofrequency ablation of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE) combined with proton pump inhibitor therapy is commonly utilized for preventing progression of dysplastic BE to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Fundamental to the success of this and all ablative approaches is the healing of the ablated areas of BE with a stratified squamous epithelium referred to as 'neosquamous epithelium' (NSE). Although NSE appears 'normal' endoscopically, the reemergence of BE over time in the previously ablated segments raises the question of the health and integrity of NSE. The health of NSE was recently investigated in endoscopic biopsies in vitro in a group of patients after ablation while on proton pump inhibitors. Biopsies of NSE were compared to upper squamous epithelium (USE) from the same patients morphologically (light microscopy) and with respect to barrier function by measuring electrical resistance and fluorescein flux in mini-Ussing chambers. Compared to USE, NSE exhibited dilated intercellular spaces and inflammation and defective barrier function by low electrical resistance and high fluorescein flux. Moreover, NSE exhibited downregulation of claudin-4, a highly expressed protein in squamous tight junctions. NSE has defective barrier function in part due to downregulation of claudin-4. Since downregulation of claudin-4 increases paracellular permeability to cations, e.g. hydrogen ions, NSE is more vulnerable to attack and damage by acidic and weakly acidic refluxates--a phenomenon that may contribute in part to the reemergence of BE. 2014 S.

Oral squamous cell papilloma (OSP) is a benign proliferation of the stratified squamous epithelium and is generally believed to be caused by Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV). It constitutes around 2.5% of all oral verruco-papillary lesions. We here, report a case of palatal OSP occurring in a 55-year-old male. The aetiological, clinical, diagnostic and treatment aspects of OSP are discussed here.

Differentiated cells in skin epithelium and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma highly express the neuropilin-1 (NRP1) receptor. We examined the expression of NRP1 in human and mouse oral mucosa. NRP1 was significantly up-regulated in oral epithelial dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). NRP1 receptor localized to the outer suprabasal epithelial layers in normal tongue, an expression pattern similar to the normal skin epidermis. However, dysplastic tongue epithelium and OSCC up-regulated NRP1 in basal and proliferating epithelial layers, a profile unseen in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. NRP1 up-regulation is observed in a mouse carcinogen-induced OSCC model and in human tongue OSCC biopsies. Human OSCC cell lines express NRP1 protein in vitro and in mouse tongue xenografts. Sites of capillary infiltration into orthotopic OSCC tumors correlate with high NRP1 expression. HSC3 xenografts, which express the highest NRP1 levels of the cell lines examined, showed massive intratumoral lymphangiogenesis. SEMA3A inhibited OSCC cell migration, suggesting that the NRP1 receptor was bioactive in OSCC. In conclusion, NRP1 is regulated in the oral epithelium and is selectively up-regulated during epithelial dysplasia. NRP1 may function as a reservoir to sequester proangiogenic ligands within the neoplastic compartment, thereby recruiting neovessels toward tumor cells.

This report describes the distribution and localization of TM in the various types of epithelia in the rat by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. TM showed a limited distribution and was expressed by the keratinizing stratified epithelia of the skin, tongue, and esophagus, but was not present on the non-keratinizing epithelia of the vagina, ureter, trachea, stomach, or gut. An identical pattern of TM expression was seen in mucocutaneous junctions, transitional zones from a non-keratinizing stratified epithelium to a keratinizing epithelium at the edge of the eyelid and in the anal canal. As the keratinization of the stratified epithelia proceeded, the staining intensity increased in the transitional zones. Within the keratinizing stratified epithelia, TM staining was limited to the keratinocytes of the spinous layer, the spinous cells. The subcellular localization of TM on the spinous cells was restricted to the plasma membrane facing the intercellular spaces. TM was not detectable on the desmosomes or the two membranes making up the junction, presumably the nexus. The functional significance of TM in keratinizing epithelia is discussed.\n\nUltrastructural characteristics of carcinogen-induced nondysplastic changes in tracheal epithelium.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKlein-Szanto, A. J.; Topping, D. C.; Heckman, C. A.; Nettesheim, P.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nNondysplastic hypotrophic and metaplastic epithelial alterations induced by dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in isogenic tracheal transplants were studied by light and electron microscopy 3--24 months after cessation of a 4-week carcinogen exposure. Hypotrophic epithelium observed at all time points was characterized by the presence of nonciliated cells that adopted either cuboidal or squamous shapes, forming simple or bistratified epithelia. Most of these cells, as well as some metaplastic cells, exhibited features of mucin-secreting cells. The metaplastic epithelia showed nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia, closely related to transitional metaplasia, and keratinizing squamous metaplasia, which presented either an atrophic or an acanthotic epithelium. Although many of these epithelia showed morphologic features of normal stratified epithelia, several nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasias and acanthotic keratinizing squamous metaplasias exhibited some irregularities, probably representing very early atypical ultrastructural features (ie, perinuclear concentration of tonofilament bundles, the presence of dark and clear basal epithelial cells, interruptions and alterations of the basal lamina). These features were not observed in a group of early squamous metaplasias studied for comparative purposes 2 weeks after cessation of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene exposure, which were characterized by a combination of degenerative phenomena and increased cell proliferation.

In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous epithelium transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar epithelium with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63 + KRT5 + KRT7 + ) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional epithelium. On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like epithelium (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar epithelium is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human gut. Acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (believed to be a precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified transitional zone in the epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal tract and provide evidence that the p63 + KRT5 + KRT7 + basal cells in this zone are the cells of origin for multi-layered epithelium and Barrett's oesophagus.\n\nSelection of internal reference genes for normalization of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis in the rumen epithelium\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe rumen is lined on the luminal side by a stratified squamous epithelium that is responsible for not only absorption, but also transport, extensive short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism and protection.

To elucidate the specific functions of matriptase in normal and aberrant epidermal differentiation, we used enzymatic gene trapping combined with immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and barrier function assays to delineate the spatio-temporal expression and function of matriptase in mouse keratinized tissue development, homeostasis, and malignant transformation. In the interfollicular epidermis, matriptase expression was restricted to postmitotic transitional layer keratinocytes undergoing terminal differentiation. Matriptase was also expressed in keratinizing oral epithelium, where it was required for oral barrier function, and in thymic epithelium. In all three tissues, matriptase colocalized with profilaggrin. In staged embryos, the onset of epidermal matriptase expression coincided with that of profilaggrin expression and acquisition of the epidermal barrier. In marked contrast to stratifying keritinized epithelium, matripase expression commenced already in undifferentiated and rapidly proliferating profilaggrin-negative matrix cells and displayed hair growth cycle-dependent expression. Exposure of the epidermis to carcinogens led to the gradual appearance of matriptase in a keratin-5-positive proliferative cell compartment during malignant progression. Combined with previous studies, these data suggest that matriptase has diverging functions in the genesis of stratified keratinized epithelium, hair follicles, and squamous cell carcinoma.

These oral mucosa lesions are most often asymptomatic and have small progression. Laser assisted surgery is common nowadays with several advantages including successful hemostasis, devoid of sutures, wound sterilization and minimal post-operative pain and edema. The aim of this report is to present the oral squamous papilloma in a pediatric patient and its treatment with soft tissue laser. The lesion was excised with diode laser and the healing was uneventful in follow-up visit after one year. Oral squamous papillomas can be found in child's oral cavity and laser dentistry can be used by dental clinicians to treat these kinds of oral lesions and should be considered as an alternative to conventional surgery.\n\nObjectivity in the classification of tumours of the nasal epithelium\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMichaels, L.; Hyams, V. J.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nA survey of tumours derived from each of the four cell types of nasal epithelium is presented. Criticism is levelled at the adoption of additional terms for tissue types such as lympho-epithelium and transitional cell epithelium and tumours said to be derived from them. Electron microscopy is of assistance in classification particularly in the detection of evidence of keratin synthesis. The proposed classification of tumours of the nasal epithelium is: (1) Pseudostratified columnar epithelium: (a) papillary adenoma, (b) papillary carcinoma. (2) Squamous epithelium: (a) everted squamous papilloma, (b) inverted papilloma, (c) squamous carcinoma of any grade of differentiation from well differentiated to undifferentiated. (3) Melanocyte: malignant melanoma. (4) Olfactory neuroepithelium: olfactory neuroblastoma.

This new technique uses monoclonal antibody as a primary antibody and it takes about three hours for staining. The time is much shorter than conventional absorption-elution testing or absorption-inhibition testing for the determination of ABO blood grouping. Secretor saliva samples were stained at strong intensity by the antibody, which corresponded to its blood group and anti-H. On the one hand, nonsecretor saliva samples were stained at strong intensity only by the antibody that corresponded to its blood group, and at weak intensity only by anti-H. Since human oral squamous epithelium antigens were stained specifically by this method, we can examine the ABO blood group of saliva samples and perform cytodiagnosis at the same time. Our research suggested that the EnVision+ Method is a useful technique for ABO blood grouping of saliva in forensic cases.\n\nSquamous epithelium formation in the respiratory intestine of the bronze Corydoras Corydoras aeneus (Callichthyidae Teleostei).\n\nPubMed\n\nSatora, Leszek; KozioÅ, Katarzyna; Zebrowski, Jacek\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAccessory respiratory organs in fish exhibit great diversity but share the presence of numerous capillaries covered by a simple squamous epithelium. The adoption of the intestine for respiratory function needs certain special modifications. In this study, we explored immunohistochemical and metabolic fingerprint features that could underlay this adaptation in bronze corydoras Corydoras aeneus. Immunohistochemical localization of the cytoplasmic domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the respiratory part of intestine demonstrated a strong positive immunoreaction in epithelial cells and connective tissue. Fourier Transfer Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics discriminated between anterior and posterior region of intestine in terms of secondary structure of proteins and the abundance of p-cresol and other phenolics. The latter were reduced in the posterior part of intestine, indicating the cessation of digestive function in this region. It has been suggested that aquatic hypoxia via endocrine cells (hypoxia-sensitive) activate EGFR, which induce proliferation of squamous epithelial cells, thereby enabling gas diffusion in the posterior part of intestine. It seems that hypoxia and normoxia are opposed conditions adjusting the production of squamous epithelial cells in this intestine. The physiological role of EGFR in the respiratory intestine of bronze corydoras is of interest not only from an evolutionary aspect but also in terms of a potential model for observations process proliferation squamous epithelial cells. Future investigations on the molecular responses to different water oxygen levels in air-breathing bronze corydoras fish are required to clarify the mechanism responsible for squamous cell proliferation.

A combination of transmission electron microscopic (TEM), scanning electron microscopic (SEM), radioautographic, and light microscopic (LM) analyses were carried out using intact fetal tissues between 8 and 20 weeks of gestation as well as cultured esophageal explants. Up to the age of 10 weeks, the stratified esophageal epithelium consisted of two longitudinal primary folds. The surface cells were undifferentiated and contained large glycogen aggregates. Between 11 and 16 weeks, the primary folds (now up to four) had developed secondary folds. The thickness of the epithelium drastically increased (123%) in concomittance with a differentiation of surface columnar ciliated cells. These highly specialized surface cells exhibited junctional complexes and well-developed organelles with numerous microvilli interspersed among the cilia. Transverse sections revealed the internal structure of the cilia with a consistent pattern of nine doublet microtubules surrounding a central pair of single microtubules. Freeze-fracture studies illustrated the presence of a ciliary necklace composed of 6 ring-like rows of intramembranous particles. They also revealed the structure of ciliary cell tight junctions consisting of up to nine anastomosing strands (P-face) or complementary grooves (E-face). Ultrastructural studies (LM, TEM, SEM) of the esophageal squamous epithelium obtained after 15 days of culture showed that the newly formed epithelium was similar to adult human epithelium. Finally LM and SEM observations established that the esophagogastric junction was not yet well delineated, consisting of a transitional area composed of a mixture of esophageal ciliated cells and gastric columnar mucous cells.\n\nImmunolocalization of osteopontin in dysplasias and squamous cell carcinomas arising from oral epithelium.\n\nPubMed\n\nAravind, Thara; Janardhanan, Mahija; Rakesh, S; Savithri, Vindhya; Unnikrishnan, U G\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEarly detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains one of the most efficient ways to ensure patient survival and improved quality of life. Although specific biomarkers related to OSCC have been investigated, a useful biomarker that assesses the transition potential of potentially malignant lesion to OSCC remains to be found. Osteopontin (OPN) has been recognized as an important factor in tumorigenesis and their expression in OSCC have been investigated earlier. In the present study, evaluation of OPN expression in premalignant and malignant lesions has been carried out to assess their possible role as a biomarker in the early diagnosis and prognosis of OSCC. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of OPN as a biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of OSCC. The study group consisted of archival paraffin-embedded blocks of ten cases each of varying grades of OSCC, oral epithelial dysplasias and epithelial hyperplasias. Sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for the biomarker OPN. A positive OPN expression was noticed in epithelial dysplasias and SCC arising from the oral epithelium. A progressive increase in the intensity of staining was seen with increasing grades of dysplasias and a decrease in OPN expression with an increase in grades was observed in OSCC. The expression of OPN in full thickness of epithelium in severe dysplasias, carcinoma in situ, and in the superficial epithelium of OSCC suggest the possibility of considering OPN expression in full epithelial thickness in dysplasias as an indicator for malignant transformation.\n\nSimilar Squamous Cell Carcinoma Epithelium microRNA Expression in Never Smokers and Ever Smokers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKolokythas, Antonia; Zhou, Yalu; Schwartz, Joel L.; Adami, Guy R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe incidence of oral tumors in patients who never used mutagenic agents such as tobacco is increasing. In an effort to better understand these tumors we studied microRNA (miRNA) expression in tumor epithelium of never tobacco users, tumor epithelium of ever tobacco users, and nonpathological control oral epithelium. A comparison of levels among 372 miRNAs in 12 never tobacco users with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) versus 10 healthy controls was made using the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A similar analysis was done with 8 ever tobacco users with OSCC. These comparisons revealed miR-10b-5p, miR-196a-5p, and miR-31-5p as enriched in the tumor epithelium in OSCC of both never and ever tobacco users. Examination of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project miRNA data on 305 OSCCs and 30 controls revealed 100% of those miRNAs enriched in never smoker OSCCs in this patient group were also enriched in ever smoker OSCCs. Nonsupervised clustering of TCGA OSCCs was suggestive of two or four subgroups of tumors based on miRNA levels with limited evidence for differences in tobacco exposure among the groups. Results from both patient groups together stress the importance of miR196a-5p in OSCC malignancy in both never and ever smokers, and emphasize the overall similarity of miRNA expression in OSCCs in these two risk groups. It implies that there may be great similarity in etiology of OSCC in never and ever smokers and that classifying OSCC based on tobacco exposure may not be helpful in the clinic.

The mouse vaginal epithelium cyclically exhibits cell proliferation and differentiation in response to estrogen and provides a unique model for analyzing the homeostasis of stratified squamous epithelia. To address the role of ESR1-mediated tissue events during homeostasis, we analyzed mice with a vaginal epithelium-specific knockout of Esr1 driven by keratin 5-Cre (K5-Esr1KO). We show here that loss of epithelial ESR1 in the vagina resulted in aberrant epithelial cell proliferation in the suprabasal cell layers and led to failure of keratinized differentiation. Gene expression analysis showed that several known estrogen target genes, including erbB growth factor ligands, were not induced by estrogen in the K5-Esr1KO mouse vagina. Organ culture experiments revealed that the addition of erbB growth factor ligands, such as amphiregulin, could activate keratinized differentiation in the absence of epithelial ESR1. Thus, epithelial ESR1 integrates estrogen and growth factor signaling to mediate regulation of cell proliferation in squamous differentiation, and our results provide new insights into estrogen-mediated homeostasis in female reproductive organs.\n\nEffects of Lugol staining on stenosis formation induced by radiofrequency ablation of esophageal squamous epithelium: a study in a porcine model.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchÃ¶lvinck, D W; Alvarez Herrero, L; Visser, M; Bergman, J J G H M; Weusten, B L A M\n\n2015-10-01\n\nPreliminary data show higher stricture rates after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for early esophageal squamous neoplasia compared with Barrett's esophagus. We studied the effects of Lugol stain (LS) directly prior to RFA on stricture formation in squamous epithelium. Of 16 pigs, the distal half of the esophagus was LS, followed by circumferential RFA (single application 12 J/cm(2) ) in the unstained and stained esophagus. Pigs were euthanized at day 0 (n = 4), 3 (n = 4), or 28 (n = 8). Histology was evaluated in four areas: blank-control (no RFA, no LS), blank-RFA (no LS), LS+RFA, and LS-control (no RFA). Stenosis severity in LS+RFA and blank-RFA at 28 days was assessed by the ratio of the mucosal diameter at the RFA area to the diameter 2 cm proximal of this zone. Histology showed submucosal edema in 50% of LS+RFA versus 0% in blank-RFA. Severity and depth of inflammation (day 3) was equal in LS+RFA and blank-RFA. Severity and depth of fibrosis (day 28) appeared more severe in LS+RFA. Consequently, stenosis was present in 100% (LS+RFA) versus 12.5% (blank-RFA). The stenosis-severity ratio was 0.40 (interquartile range 0.29-0.45) in LS+RFA versus 0.73 (interquartile range 0.64-0.78) in blank-RFA (P = 0.012). Limitations of this study were the difference in uptake of LS between pigs and humans, the difference in esophageal anatomy between pigs and humans, and between the proximal and distal esophagus within pigs. In conclusion, in the porcine squamous esophagus, stenosis rate and severity after RFA increased when preceded by LS. LS may be contributing in the altered response of squamous epithelium to RFA as compared with Barrett's esophagus.

The epithelial basal layer consists of two distinct zones, one overlying the papillae of the supporting connective tissue (PBL) and the other covering the interpapillary zone (IBL) [3]. In examining the oesophageal basal layer, we found that proliferating cells were rare in the IBL and a high proportion of mitoses were asymmetrical, giving rise to one basal daughter and one suprabasal, differentiating daughter. In the PBL, mitoses were more frequent and predominantly symmetrical. The IBL was characterised by low expression of ?1 integrins and high expression of the beta2 laminin chain. By combining fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with in vitro clonal analysis, we obtained evidence that the IBL is enriched for stem cells. A normal oesophageal epithelium with asymmetric divisions was reconstituted on denuded oesophageal connective tissue. In contrast, asymmetric divisions were not sustained on skin connective tissue, and the epithelium formed resembled epidermis. We propose that stem cells located in the IBL give rise to differentiating daughters through asymmetric divisions in response to cues from the underlying basement membrane. Until now, stem-cell fate in stratified squamous epithelia was believed to be achieved largely through populational asymmetry [4-6].\n\nEpithelial estrogen receptor 1 intrinsically mediates squamous differentiation in the mouse vagina\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiyagawa, Shinichi; Iguchi, Taisen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nEstrogen-mediated actions in female reproductive organs are tightly regulated, mainly through estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1).

To distinguish UC with squamous differentiation from pure UC, a sensitive and specific marker is needed. Desmocollin 2 (DSC2) is a protein localized in desmosomal junctions of stratified epithelium, but little is known about its biological significance in bladder cancer. We examined the utility of DSC2 as a diagnostic marker. We analysed the immunohistochemical characteristics of DSC2, and studied the relationship of DSC2 expression with the expression of the known markers uroplakin III (UPIII), cytokeratin (CK)7, CK20, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and p53. DSC2 staining was detected in 24 of 25 (96%) cases of UC with squamous differentiation, but in none of 85 (0%) cases of pure UC. DSC2 staining was detected only in areas of squamous differentiation. DSC2 expression was mutually exclusive of UPIII expression, and was correlated with EGFR expression. Furthermore, DSC2 expression was correlated with higher stage (P = 0.0314) and poor prognosis (P = 0.0477). DSC2 staining offers high sensitivity (96%) and high specificity (100%) for the detection of squamous differentiation in UC. DSC2 is a useful immunohistochemical marker for separation of UC with squamous differentiation from pure UC. 2011 Blackwell Publishing Limited.\n\n[Inveterate squamous cell carcinoma of the upper eyelid: a case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nRinaldi, S; Marcasciano, M; Pacitti, F; Toscani, M; Tarallo, M; Fino, P; Scuderi, G L\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignant tumor of epithelium that shows squamous cell differentiation. It is the second most common cancer of the skin and usually occurs in areas exposed to the sun but it can rarely arise within the conjunctival epithelium with a deep component. We describe a woman with a history of chronic blepharoconjunctivitis unresponsive to topical medications. Examination disclosed a hyperaemic translucent patch with blurred margins of the upper palpebral conjunctiva. Tarsoconjunctival biopsy revealed intraepithelial squamous cell carcinoma. Management consisted of complete tumor excision with removal of the entire posterior lamella of the left upper eyelid and reconstruction. Histopathologic analysis confirmed primary squamous cell carcinoma arising from conjunctival epithelium, involving the underlying tarsus. Patients with unexplained chronic unilateral blepharoconjunctivitis or papillary hypertrophy of the palpebral conjunctiva should be considered for biopsy to rule out neoplasia, even when there is no sign of an evident mass.\n\nImpairment of vascularization of the surface covering epithelium induces ischemia and promotes malignization: a new hypothesis of a possible mechanism of cancer pathogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarseladze, A I\n\n2015-06-01\n\nTo study the peculiarities of vascularization at the stromal-epithelial interface in different types of epithelia and their alterations in precancerous lesions. Peritumoral tissues of 310 patients, tissues of 180 healthy persons and of 50 human embryos and fetuses were used. Traditional histological as well as immunohistochemical methods have been used. The study reveals that the occurrence of blood capillaries in surface squamous epithelium is an ordinary event, both in healthy persons and in peritumoral regions of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Glandular epithelial coverings, as well as transitional epithelium, do not contain blood vessels. In squamous epithelium, only basal cells are in contact with the membrane and underlying stroma, the cells of the upper layer receiving nutrients through diffusion. Thus, the cells of squamous epithelium are more vulnerable to blood deficiency, since for instance in the pseudo-multilayered respiratory epithelium each cell is attached directly to the basal membrane and has more ample access to the blood supply. Metaplastic squamous epithelium has a markedly reduced vascularization and seems to be more sensitive to carcinogenic stimuli. High-grade dysplastic squamous epithelium and carcinoma in situ do not contain blood vessels. The process of redistribution of vascular network occurring at the interface of epithelial-stromal frontier plays an important role in maintaining the adequate metabolism of cells including those of epithelial covering. Impairment of this mechanism most probably promotes precancerous alterations.\n\n[The epithelial junctional zones of the anal canal and cervix uterus: the ultrastructure of tumors of these zones].\n\nPubMed\n\nChernyÄ­, A P; Iakovleva, N I\n\n1990-01-01\n\nRelationships between squamous and columnar epithelia in the anal canal and cervix uteri of postnatal period and fetus were studied.

The hypothesis on the physiological significance of this epithelium is proposed. Ultrastructural features of the cytoskeleton and cell surface suggest that anal basaloid carcinomas and some cervical squamous carcinomas may develop from so-called junctional epithelium.\n\nTestosterone-induced \"Virilization\" of Mesonephric Duct Remnants and Cervical Squamous Epithelium in Female-to-Male Transgenders: A Report of 3 Cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nSingh, Kamaljeet; Sung, C James; Lawrence, W Dwayne; Quddus, M Ruhul\n\n2017-07-01\n\nMesonephric ducts regress in genotypic females, leaving behind few remnants. These vestigial structures are often recognized in the mesosalpinx and paracervical regions. We report here 3 cases of female-to-male transgenders who underwent hysterectomy following testosterone treatment. Both female and male genital structures were identified on histologic examination. Although the morphologic appearances of the specimens were unremarkable, histologically 1 case revealed a well-formed fallopian tube as well as an epididymis and 2 cases showed prostate glands to be present in the cervical squamous epithelium.\n\nVulvovaginal-gingival Lichen Planus: Association with Lichen Planopilaris and Stratified Epithelium-specific Antinuclear Antibodies.\n\nPubMed\n\nOlszewska, Malgorzata; Banka-Wrona, Agnieszka; Skrok, Anna; Rakowska, Adriana; GÃ³rska, Renata; Solomon, Lynn W; Rudnicka, Lidia\n\n2016-01-01\n\nVulvovaginal-gingival lichen planus (VVG-LP) consists of a triad of symptoms: vulval, vaginal and gingival lichen planus lesions. The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of lesions in various anatomical locations in patients with VVG-LP. The study included 126 consecutive patients with lichen planus. Sixteen (12.7%) patients fulfilled the criteria of VVG-LP. In 12/16 (75%) patients with VVG-LP scalp lesions were also observed. Stratified epithelium-specific antinuclear antibodies (SES-ANA) and anti-ÎNp.3Î± antibodies were detected in 10/16 (75%) patients with VVG-LP and in 15/110 (13.6%) patients with other forms of lichen planus (pâ<â0.05). In conclusion, VVG-LP is frequently associated with lichen planopilaris. The new entity may be termed \"vulvovaginal-gingival-pilar lichen planus\" and our study indicates that SES-ANA is a marker of this type of lichen planus with extensive, severe and refractory-to-therapy involvement of the mucous membranes, skin and scalp.\n\nStratified mucin-producing intraepithelial lesion with invasive carcinoma: 12 cases with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings.\n\nPubMed\n\nOnishi, Junji; Sato, Yuichiro; Sawaguchi, Akira; Yamashita, Atsushi; Maekawa, Kazunari; Sameshima, Hiroshi; Asada, Yujiro\n\n2016-09-01\n\nStratified mucin-producing intraepithelial lesion (SMILE) is considered to be a variant of adenocarcinoma in situ (defined as intraepithelial malignant glandular epithelium without invasion) or adenosquamous carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix. However, recent study suggested that SMILE is more similar to high-grade squamous epithelial lesion by their immunohistochemical findings. An invasive form of SMILE \"invasive stratified mucin-producing carcinoma (ISMC)\" has been also proposed, but immunohistochemical features are not well documented. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the immunohistochemical characteristics of SMILE and ISMC. Twelve cases of SMILE were found among 445 patients (2.7%) with high-grade intraepithelial lesions or invasive carcinomas, 3 of whom had solely intraepithelial disease with SMILE component (mean age, 37 years; range, 30-48 years) and 9 with invasive carcinomas (mean age, 47 years; range, 37-66 years; including ISMC). Immunohistochemically, SMILE and ISMC were diffusely positive for p16 and CAM5.2, focally for IMP3, and almost negative or only focally positive for p63. Nuclear signals in SMILE and invasive carcinomas were detected by human papillomavirus (HPV) in situ hybridization; 5 cases showed HPV16 and/or HPV18 polymerase chain reaction products. The ultrastructural study of 1 case showed surface microvilli and small vacuolar structure in SMILE; ISMC had mucous-like vacuoles, many mitochondria and intracytoplasmic lumen but lacked tonofilament. These findings were more similar to adenocarcinoma in situ or adenocarcinoma than squamous intraepithelial lesion or squamous cell carcinoma. We suggest that SMILE is an intraepithelial neoplasm and ISMC is an invasive form of SMILE. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Stratified epithelia arise from simple epithelia during development, and transcription factor p63 functions as a key positive regulator of epidermal stratification. Here we show that deletion of integrin beta 1 (Itgb1) in the developing mouse airway epithelium abrogates airway branching and converts this monolayer epithelium into a multilayer epithelium with more than 10 extra layers. Mutant lung epithelial cells change mitotic spindle orientation to seed outer layers, and cells in different layers become molecularly and functionally distinct, hallmarks of normal stratification. However, mutant lung epithelial cells do not activate p63 and do not switch to the stratified keratin profile of epidermal cells. These data, together with previous data implicating Itgb1 in regulation of epidermal stratification, suggest that the simple-versus-stratified developmental decision may involve not only stratification inducers like p63 but suppressors like Itgb1 that prevent simple epithelia from inappropriately activating key steps in the stratification program.

The expressions of EP-CAM and beta-catenin were detected with immunohistochemical stain in 14 cases of normal cervical squamous epithelium, 32 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 38 cases of cervical invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The over-expression rates of EP-CAM were 0, 7.1%, 20.0%, 62.5% and 55.3% for normal cervical epithelium, CINI, CINII, CINIII and carcinoma groups. The EP-CAM over-expression rates in CINIII and cervical carcinoma groups were significantly higher than those in normal epithelium and CINI groups (P < 0.001). No aberrant expression of beta-catenin was shown in normal cervical epithelium, while the aberrant expression rates of beta-catenin in CINI, CINII, CINIII and cervical carcinoma group were 28.6%, 40.0%, 62.5% and 84.2%. The aberrant expression rate of beta-catenin increased with the increase in degree of CIN and development of cervical carcinoma. The over-expression rate of EP-CAM was reversely related to the differentiation of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.001). EP-CAM and beta-catenin may be involved in the carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix. The over-expression of EP-CAM and aberrant expression of beta-catenin may serve as markers of squamous carcinogenesis of uterine cervix.\n\nNovel multiplexed low coherence interferometry endoscopic probe for analyzing the cervical epithelium in vivo (Conference Presentation)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHo, Derek; Chu, Kengyeh K.; Crose, Michael; Desoto, Michael; Peters, Jennifer J.; Murtha, Amy P.; Wax, Adam\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe cervix is primarily composed of two types of epithelium: stratified squamous ectocervix and simple columnar endocervix. In between these two layers lies a metaplastic squamocolumnar junction commonly referred to as the transformation zone (T-zone). During puberty, the cervical epithelium undergoes dynamic changes including cervical ectropion and increased area and rates of metaplasia. Although these metaplastic changes have been linked to higher incidence of cervical cancer among young women, research in this field has been limited to surface analysis using computerized planimetry of colopophotographs. Here, we present a novel multiplexed low coherence interferometry (mLCI) system for interrogating the cervical epithelium. The system is comprised of 6 parallel Mach-Zehnder interferometers in a time-multiplexed configuration that increases throughput by 6-fold to realize a combined 36-channel acquisition. A custom designed endoscopic handheld probe is used to collect sparsely sampled, depth-resolved scattering intensity profiles (A-scans) from a large field of view (25 x 25 mm) on the cervical epithelium in vivo. The instrument incorporates white light imaging through a plastic fiber bundle to co-register the mLCI A-scans to colpophotographs which are analyzed by a clinician to manually segment the cervical epithelium. Our preliminary data shows significant differences in characteristic A-scans from endocervical and ectocervical epithelium. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using mLCI as both a research tool for studying the relationship between cervical ectopy and cancer as well as a clinical instrument for identifying the at-risk T-zone on the cervix in vivo as a means to improve biopsy targeting. Further analysis will be performed to develop an algorithm for distinguishing the mLCI A-scans of endocervical, ectocervical, and metaplastic epithelium in real time.\n\nTumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulates the production of squamous cell carcinoma antigen in normal squamous cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nNuma, F; Takeda, O; Nakata, M; Nawata, S; Tsunaga, N; Hirabayashi, K; Suminami, Y; Kato, H; Hamanaka, S\n\n1996-01-01\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen, a tumor marker of squamous cell carcinoma, is also increased in several nonmalignant skin lesions, e.g. pemphigus. The aim of the present investigation was to determine if tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), one of the important environmental factors, stimulated the production of SCC antigen in the normal squamous cells. The exposure of normal human epidermal keratinocytes to TNF-alpha (100 IU/ml) for 72 h greatly increased the SCC antigen production. The stimulatory effect of TNF-alpha (1,000 IU/ml) on the production of SCC antigen was also observed in the normal squamous epithelium tissue. These results would be helpful for understanding the increase of SCC antigen in several nonmalignant skin disorders.\n\nMultilayered epithelium in a rat model and human Barrett's esophagus: Similar expression patterns of transcription factors and differentiation markers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Xiaoxin; Qin, Rong; Liu, Ba; Ma, Yan; Su, Yinghao; Yang, Chung S; Glickman, Jonathan N; Odze, Robert D; Shaheen, Nicholas J\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground In rats, esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA) without concomitant chemical carcinogen treatment leads to gastroesophageal reflux disease, multilayered epithelium (MLE, a presumed precursor in intestinal metaplasia), columnar-lined esophagus, dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Previously we have shown that columnar-lined esophagus in EGDA rats resembled human Barrett's esophagus (BE) in its morphology, mucin features and expression of differentiation markers (Lab. Invest. 2004;84:753â765). The purpose of this study was to compare the phenotype of rat MLE with human MLE, in order to gain insight into the nature of MLE and its potential role in the development of BE. Methods Serial sectioning was performed on tissue samples from 32 EGDA rats and 13 patients with established BE. Tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained for a variety of transcription factors and differentiation markers of esophageal squamous epithelium and intestinal columnar epithelium. Results We detected MLE in 56.3% (18/32) of EGDA rats, and in all human samples. As expected, both rat and human squamous epithelium, but not intestinal metaplasia, expressed squamous transcription factors and differentiation markers (p63, Sox2, CK14 and CK4) in all cases. Both rat and human intestinal metaplasia, but not squamous epithelium, expressed intestinal transcription factors and differentiation markers (Cdx2, GATA4, HNF1Î±, villin and Muc2) in all cases. Rat MLE shared expression patterns of Sox2, CK4, Cdx2, GATA4, villin and Muc2 with human MLE. However, p63 and CK14 were expressed in a higher proportion of rat MLE compared to humans. Conclusion These data indicate that rat MLE shares similar properties to human MLE in its expression pattern of these markers, not withstanding small differences, and support the concept that MLE may be a transitional stage in the metaplastic conversion of squamous to columnar epithelium in BE.

PAV is caused by decreased estrogen levels in postmenopausal women. However, the harmful effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have resulted in considerable caution in its use. Various estrogen agonist treatment options are available. Vitamin D is influences the regulation of differentiation and proliferation of various cells, especially tissues lining stratified squamous epithelium, such as the vaginal epithelium. In this study, we hypothesized that vitamin D could provide an alternative and a safe treatment option for PAV by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of the vaginal epithelium. Thirty six patients were enrolled in this case-control study. Vitamin D associated proteins in a vitamin D and sex hormone treated vaginal epithelial cell line as well as normal and PAV tissues were measured. To confirm of cell-to-cell junction protein expression, cell line and tissue studies included RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry staining, and immunoblot analyses. The expression of cell-to-cell junction proteins was higher in women with symptoms of atrophic vagina tissue compared to women without the symptoms. Vitamin D stimulated the proliferation of the vaginal epithelium by activating p-RhoA and Erzin through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The results suggest that vitamin D positively regulates cell-to-cell junction by increasing the VDR/p-RhoA/p-Ezrin pathway. This is the first study to verify the relationship of the expression of RhoA and Ezrin proteins in vaginal tissue of PAV.

Here we aimed to assess molecular heterogeneity of oral squamous cell carcinoma and to detect signatures discriminating normal and cancerous epithelium. Tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-IMS in tissue specimens from five patients with oral cancer. Novel algorithm of IMS data analysis was developed and implemented, which included Gaussian mixture modeling for detection of spectral components and iterative k-means algorithm for unsupervised spectra clustering performed in domain reduced to a subset of the most dispersed components. About 4% of the detected peptides showed significantly different abundances between normal epithelium and tumor, and could be considered as a molecular signature of oral cancer. Moreover, unsupervised clustering revealed two major sub-regions within expert-defined tumor areas. One of them showed molecular similarity with histologically normal epithelium. The other one showed similarity with connective tissue, yet was markedly different from normal epithelium. Pathologist's re-inspection of tissue specimens confirmed distinct features in both tumor sub-regions: foci of actual cancer cells or cancer microenvironment-related cells prevailed in corresponding areas. Hence, molecular differences detected during automated segmentation of IMS data had an apparent reflection in real structures present in tumor. Â© 2016 The Authors.

Merkel in 1875 and named \"Tastzellen\" (touch cells). Merkel cells are primarily localized in the basal layer of the epidermis and concentrated in touch-sensitive areas. In our previous work, we reported on the distribution of MCs in the human esophagus, so therefore we chose other parts of the human body to study them. We selected the human vagina, because it has a similar epithelium as the esophagus and plays very important roles in reproduction and sexual pleasure. Due to the fact that there are very few research studies focusing on the innervation of this region, we decided to investigate the occurrence of MCs in the anterior wall of the vagina. The aim of our research was to identify MCs in the stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium of the human vagina in 20 patients. For the identification of Merkel cells by light microscopy, we used antibodies against simple-epithelial cytokeratins (especially anti-cytokeratin 20). We also tried to identify them using transmission electron microscopy. Our investigation confirmed that 10 (50 %) of 20 patients had increased number of predominantly intraepithelial CK20 positive \"Merkel-like\" cells (MLCs) in the human vaginal epithelium. Subepithelial CK20 positive MLCs were observed in only one patient (5%). We tried to identify them also using transmission electron microscopy. Our investigation detected some unique cells that may be MCs. The purpose of vaginal innervation is still unclear. There are no data available concerning the distribution of MCs in the human vagina, so it would be interesting to study the role of MCs in the vaginal epithelium, in the context of innervation and epithelial biology.\n\nTHE NEOPLASTIC POTENTIALITIES OF MOUSE EMBRYO TISSUES\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith, William E.\n\n1947-01-01\n\nEpithelial tumors have been readily obtained by the implantation of embryo stomach tissue together with olive oil containing methylcholanthrene (with or without Scharlach R) in adult mice of homologous strain. The implanted tissue from the squamous portion of the stomach rapidly encysted the oil, and benign and malignant papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas soon arose from the stratified squamous lining of the cysts. Bits of the glandular portion of the stomach also formed cysts, but the gland cells underwent metaplasia in response to the carcinogen, altering first to transitional epithelium and then to a stratified squamous layer. So swiftly did these changes take place that nearly all of the tumors took origin from epithelium that had already become stratified and squamous, and the growths themselves were of this type. A single transitional cell carcinoma and an adenoacanthoma were procured, but no adenocarcinomas; nor did any benign papillomas develop, though they often resulted from the action of methylcholanthrene on the squamous portion of the embryo stomach. Search failed to disclose any distinctive precancerous changes in the gastric tissue. Five of the cancers were transplanted and they grew in every host. No tumors arose from any of the numerous control implants. Those consisting of glandular tissue formed cysts lined partly with columnar epithelium secreting mucus and partly with tubular glands equipped with chief and parietal cells in good condition. Pepsin and rennin were found in the fluid contained in these cysts, but no free hydrochloric acid. The enzymes were present also when the cysts contained methylcholanthrene and the glands had not yet been wholly replaced by metaplastic epithelium. The tumors appeared months sooner than when methylcholanthrene is injected into the stomach of adult animals or given by mouth; some of them were well established after 5 or 6 weeks. They arose regularly when the requisite experimental conditions were provided\n\nTWIST and p-Akt immunoexpression in normal oral epithelium oral dysplasia and in oral squamous cell carcinoma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYamamoto, Fernanda-Paula; CorrÃªa Pontes, FlÃ¡via-Sirotheau; Cury, SÃ©rgio-Elias; Fonseca, Felipe-Paiva; Rebelo-Pontes, HÃ©lder; Pinto-JÃºnior, DÃ©cio-dos Santos\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoexpression of TWIST and p-Akt proteins in oral leukoplakia (OL) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), correlating their expressions with the histological features of the lesions. Study design: Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on 10 normal oral epithelium, 30 OL and 20 OSCC formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Immunoperoxidase reactions for TWIST and p-Akt proteins were applied on the specimens and the positivity of the reactions was calculated for 1000 epithelial cells. Results: Kruskal-Wallis and Dunnâs post tests revealed a significant difference in TWIST and p-Akt immunoexpression among normal oral mucosa, OL and OSCC. In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between TWIST and p-Akt expressions according to the Pearsonâs correlation test. Conclusions: The results obtained in the current study suggest that TWIST and p-Akt may participate of the multi-step process of oral carcinogenesis since its early stages. Key words: Oral cancer, oral leukoplakia, dysplasia, immunohistochemistry.

The number of nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) can be used to show the degree of cell activity or metabolism in pathologic lesions. This study was designed to evaluate NORs as determi-nants of precancerous and squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and methods A silver colloid technique was applied on paraffin sections of 40 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma and 25 cases of precancerous lesions; 15 specimens of normal epithelium were selected for the control group. After staining with silver nitrate, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs) were counted in 100 epithelial cells in three groups with the use of an oil immersion and Ã1000 objective lens. One-way ANOVA and a post hoc Tukey test were used for statistical analysis. Results The mean numbers and standard deviations of AgNORs were 1.58 Â± 0.76 in normal epithelium, 2.1 Â± 1.05 in pre-cancerous lesions and 2.43 Â±1.33 in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). There were statistically significant differences in Ag-NORs numbers between the groups (P<0.001) and significant differences in precancerous lesions between dysplastic and non-dysplastic epithelia (P<0.001). The mean AgNORs count per nucleus increased from healthy epithelium to precancer-ous lesion to SCC. Conclusion This study suggests that the silver staining technique for the detection of NORs (AgNOR) can be used to distinguish precancerous lesions and benign and malignant lesions.

Here, we report the establishment of a novel lingual epithelium organoid culture system using a three-dimensional matrix and growth factors. Histological analyses showed that the generated organoids had both a stratified squamous epithelial cell layer and a stratum corneum. Very recently, we showed via a multicolor lineage tracing method that Bmi1-positive stem cells exist at the base of the epithelial basal layer in the interpapillary pit. Using our new culture system, we found that organoids could be generated by single Bmi1-positive stem cells and that in the established organoids, multiple Bmi1-positive stem cells were generated at the outermost layer. Moreover, we observed that organoids harvested at an early point in culture could be engrafted and maturate in the tongue of recipient mice and that the organoids generated from carcinogen-treated mice had an abnormal morphology. Thus, this culture system presents valuable settings for studying not only the regulatory mechanisms of lingual epithelium but also lingual regeneration and carcinogenesis.\n\nPenile Analogue of Stratified Mucin-Producing Intraepithelial Lesion of the Cervix: The First Described Case. A Diagnostic Pitfall.\n\nPubMed\n\nMichal, Michael; Michal, Michal; Miesbauerova, Marketa; Hercogova, Jana; Skopalikova, Barbora; Kazakov, Dmitry V\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe authors report a case where undifferentiated (classic) penile intraepithelial neoplasia was associated with the presence of goblet cells throughout the full epithelial thickness and which later progressed into an invasive carcinoma. The lesion evolved in three consecutive biopsies from only surface epithelium occupying numerous goblet cells in the first to variably sized solid nodules in the dermis composed of atypical squamous and/or basaloid cells intermixed with numerous goblet cells in the third biopsy. Both cellular components expressed CK7 and p16 protein. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping revealed high risk HPV type 16. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of such a lesion occurring on the penis, which can be considered the penile analogue of cervical stratified mucin-producing intraepithelial lesion (SMILE). The correct diagnosis was rendered retrospectively, after recognition of the existence of a vulvar lesion resembling cervical SMILE. The initial biopsy was misinterpreted as extramammary Paget disease, which also constitutes the main pitfall in the differential diagnosis. Another important differential diagnosis is penile/vulvar mucinous metaplasia. The finding of atypical squamous epithelial cells positive for p16 associated with mucinous cells present throughout the full epithelial thickness is a clue to the diagnosis of penile SMILE.\n\nTHE PERMEABILITY OF RAT TRANSITIONAL EPITHELIUM\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHicks, R. M.\n\n1966-01-01\n\nPermeability barriers must exist in transitional epithelium to prevent the free flow of water from underlying blood capillaries through the epithelium into the hypertonic urine, and such a barrier has now been demonstrated in isolated bladders. This barrier is passive in function and can be destroyed by damaging the luminal surface of the transitional epithelium with sodium hydroxide and 8 M urea solutions, by digesting it with trypsin, lecithinase C, and lecithinase D, or by treating it with lipid solvents such as Triton x 100 and saponin. From this it is concluded that the barrier depends on the integrity of lipoprotein cell membranes. The barrier function is also destroyed by sodium thioglycollate solutions, and electron microscope investigations show that sodium thioglycollate damages the thick asymmetric membrane which limits the luminal face of the superficial squamous cell. Cytochemical staining shows the epithelium to contain disulfide and thiol groups and to have a concentration of these groups at the luminal margin of the superficial cells. It thus appears that the permeability barrier also depends on the presence of disulfide bridges in the epithelium, and it is presumed that these links are located in keratin. Because of the effect of thiogly"
