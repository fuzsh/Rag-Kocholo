        "text": "Introduction\n\nEpithelia extend in size during embryogenesis, self-organize into structures such as tubes or villi, and maintain homeostasis once they have attained their adult dimensions by actively adapting to the environment – a characteristic of intelligent or “smart” materials. Exactly how individual epithelial cells function together as a tissue is of intrinsic scientific interest, and – because most human cancers arise from epithelia – is also of great medical importance. This review considers the multiple mechanisms through which epithelia adapt to their environment, and respond to instructive signals to create the multiple tissues that comprise much of the animal body plan.\n\nHowever, we should briefly consider first where epithelia come from. Most in vitro studies use clonal populations of epithelial cells that divide indefinitely in culture. However, in vivo many - though not all - epithelia arise from local populations of stem cells, which generate highly proliferative progenitors. These progenitors in turn give rise to fully differentiated epithelial cells that often cease proliferation, but in some tissues continue to divide, or do so in response to specific changes in the environment so as to maintain homeostasis. Because of this developmental mechanism, epithelial cell lines grown in culture might often be more representative of the progenitor/transit amplifying cell-type than of the fully differentiated epithelial cell-type. It is not immediately obvious why the tissue stem cell mechanism has evolved, but one likely factor is the continuous exposure of many epithelia to genotoxic agents present in the environment (chemicals, radiation, viruses). A protected pool of stem cells can replace damaged tissues with new, undamaged cells in a way that would not be possible if all the cells in an epithelium had an equal chance of proliferating. The functions of some highly differentiated epithelial cells might also be incompatible with cell division."
