        "text": "1. Stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium (oesophagus) HE\n\n2. Stratified squamous keratinizing epithelium (thick skin from the palm) HE\n\n3. Transitional epithelium/urothelium (vesica urinaria or ureter) HE\n\n4. Pigmented epithelium (retina) unstained\n\nGlands (introduction)\n\n5. Unicellular, endoepithelial gland (goblet cell) PAS-H\n\nThis week you will see stratified epithelia and with the last slide we will start dealing with glandular epithelia.\n\n1. Stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium (oesophagus) HE\n\nThe typical occurrence of this epithelium is around the body openings, where the stratified squamous keratinizing epithelium (the uppermost layer of the skin) continues into an inner lining. In these territories the epithelium has to withstand different mechanical, chemical, and temperature effects (e.g., oral cavity, esophagus, vagina). If you have a wound in your mouth, the temperature differences are unpleasant and you do not want to consume dishes with pepper and chili...\n\nThe contact-surface between the epithelium and connective tissue is wavy: this has its mechanical importance, because it provides a more durable connection between the two different tissue layers, on the other hand it is essential from the point of view of nutrition. Epithelia do not contain blood vessel, so the thickness of epithelium is limited by the possible distance of diffusion from the vessels in the connective tissue through the basal membrane. If the contact-surface is papillated, the thickness of the epithelium may be increased since the invaginations of the connective tissue (connective tissue papillae) contain vessels that supply the epithelium in their vicinity. In the slide you will find many papillae in different cuts: longitudinal cut, cross-section with a connective tissue \"eye\", or section of the epithelium just above a papilla (in this case you will see a group of dark basophilic cells from the basal layer of the epithelium surrounded by paler cells). Do not mix any of these with ducts or lymphatic follicles!\n\nLayers of the epithelium:\n\n1. Stratum basale (basal layer), or germinative layer (refers to cell proliferation), or cylindrocellular layer (refers to the columnar shape, although these cells may be also cuboidal): this layer is darkly basophilic, since it has small, proliferating cells, lying next to the basement membrane.\n\nTry to use proper terms: \"dark\" and \"light\" alone does not give enough information on the staining of the cell. Specify always whether the structure is basophilic (blue) or eosinophilic (reddish-pink) or neutral (pale-pink). We call a cell basophilic or eosinophilic based on the color of the cytoplasm. Of course, all cell nuclei are basophilic. Nuclei may be darker or lighter blue according to their size (if the same amount of DNA is distributed over a larger surface the nucleus looks lighter) and according the amount of DNA (proliferating cell nuclei often contain duplicated amount of DNA). A group of cells may look basophilic (specially with low power) even if the cytoplasm is not basophilic, when the cells are small, since in this case the nuclei are close to each other and cover most of the territory.\n\n2. Stratum polygonale (refers to the polygonal shape of the cells) or stratum spinosum. This latter naming originates from the fact that the cells shrink minimally due to the fixation, and they separate from each other except at the desmosomal connections where the tonofibrils connect the cells - as a result the cells seem to have prickles on their surfaces. In this layer we see round nuclei.\n\nImagine plastic balls pressed against each other - then separate them - this would be the shape of the cells in the polygonal layer.\n\nThe cells and the nuclei flatten as we move upward in the epithelium and we cannot tell which is the last cell of the str. polygonale and the first cell of the next layer.\n\n3. Stratum planocellulare: several layers of flattened cells with oval nuclei. The longitudinal axis of the nuclei is parallel with the surface.\n\nOther tissues in the slide: loose c. t., smooth muscle longitudinal and cross section, mixed salivary glands, (sometimes these are blue due to the insufficient differentiation), lymphatic follicles, in some slides even a small lymph node, peripheral nerve and ganglionic cells (these latter two not belong to this semester).\n\nStratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium (vagina). The squamous cells stain lighter because the high glycogen content of the epithelial cells of the vagina .\n\n2. Stratified squamous keratinizing epithelium (thick skin from the palm) HE\n\nThis epithelium covers the surface of our body, forms the uppermost layer of the skin. The keratinized layer protects against mechanical, chemical (if you have a wound contact with salty or acidic substances are unpleasant), and heat. It protects against evaporation - to prevent loss of body fluid in a burnt patient is a crucial problem. This epithelium has to be taken care of (as e.g. a leather shoe too...): for this reason we have glands underneath that moisturize and grease it. The thickness o f the keratin layer varies according to the need: it is the thickest on the sole and palm.\n\n1.-2. The first two layer are the same as in the stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium: the common name for the two layers is the Malpighian layer, the cells of it are the keratinocytes.\n\nBesides the epithelial cells in this layer there are also three other cell types. The epithelial cells of the Malpighian layer may contain melanin, that is transferred to them from the processes of melanocytes. The Langerhans cells are phagocytotic cells of bone marrow origin. The Merkel cells are specialized epithelial cells, their function is mechanoreception. It is difficult to identify these cells, so you have to know them only in theory.\n\n3. The third layer, the stratum granulosum consists of flattened cells. As a sign of keratinization they contain keratohyaline granules in their cytoplasm that are strongly basophilic.\n\n4. The stratum lucidum exists only in the thick skin, meaning \"shiny layer\". In the slide this is sometimes lighter pink, sometimes orange-pink glassy looking layer, impregnated by eleidine. The nuclei are degenerated here, the cells contain tonofilament and have a thickened cell membrane.\n\n5. The stratum corneum is the surface layer. It consists of the stratum compactum (dead squamous cells in close contact with each other) and the stratum disjunctum which is being desquamated.\n\nWhen you have a blister after hard work on your hand, it is formed in the stratum corneum. Sometimes in our slides we have a flat gap in the stratum corneum, but that is more likely an artefact. Many times you see C shaped lighter areas (as in the upper right corner of the slide), these are ducts of sweat glands piercing the stratum corneum in a spiral course.\n\nDo not mix the stratified squamous keratinizing epithelium (only the surface layer of the skin) with the skin proper.\n\nOther tissues in the slide: dense connective tissue, loose connective tissue, fat, sweat glands with their ducts, skeletal muscle, vessels, nerves.\n\nStratified squamous keratinizing epithelium. The lighter semioval territories in the stratum corneum correspond to the end-portion of the excretory duct of sweat glands.\n\nStratified squamous keratinizing epithelium, high power. Note the str. granulosum with basophilic granules and the brighter, lighter str. lucidum above it.\n\nStratified squamous keratinizing epithelium from the scar tissue. The cytoplasmic bridges caused by the desmosomes of the stratum spinosum (\"prickle cells\") are well visible.\n\n3. Transitional epithelium/urothelium (vesica urinaria or ureter) HE\n\nTransitional epithelium is the characteristic epithelium of the urinary tract, starting with the calyces. It has to comply with different requirements: must not let the urine sneak back to the interstitium, must not let water pass from the interstitium to the lumen (the osmolality of the urine may be very different from the osmolality of the blood/interstitium), and must be able to adjust to the changing size of the bladder. So, this must be a special stratified epithelium that can change the size of its surface. The uppermost layer is a single layer of (usually) flattened cells, these are the umbrella cells. These cells are quite thick, but their width is (in most cases) even larger. Their surface in contact with the underlying cells is indentated, hence the name \"umbrella\". In each concave little space a polygonal cell or \"pear-shaped\" cell is sitting (the \"pears\" would be upside-down). In-between the pointed end of the pears, other similar cells are positioned, forming multiple layers. When the surface is smaller, the upper umbrella cells contract, the membrane on their luminar surface makes multiple folds, these may pinch off and form fusiform vesicles (these then will serve as reserve membrane parts for the future), sometimes this appears as a darker stained stripe on the surface of the cells. The underlying pear-shaped cells are elongated and narrower, rearrange in more rows. When the epithelium is stretched, the umbrella cells flatten, accept more pear-shaped cells, so these will be lined up in lesser layers. The pear-shaped cells are not fixed to each other with desmosomes as strongly as is other stratified epithelia. However, between the umbrella cells extensive tight junctions ensure the proper sealing. Closest to the basal lamina, similarly to other stratified epithelia, the stratum basale (basal layer) cells are are lined up.\n\nOn the photo you may observe the umbrella cells (some with two nuclei), and in some places the cell borders of the pear-shaped cells are also seen.\n\nUrothelium from urinary bladder (left) and ureter (right). On the surface you may see cells with two nuclei (binucleated cells). In the lower layers the outline of the pear shaped cells is visible.\n\nNB: Do not mix this slide with the stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium: these you have more layers of flattened cells on the surface that change their shape to polygonal step-by-step as we go deeper. In the transitional epithelium only a single layer of (flattened) umbrella cells is present.\n\nOther tissues in the slide:loose c. t., vessels, smooth muscle.\n\n4. Pigmented epithelium (retina) unstained\n\nBird`s eye view in the outermost layer of the retina, to prevent reflexion in the eye. The preparation was made from bull's or rabbit's eye by peeling off the retina. This then was cut into pieces, mounted on glass slides, dehydrated and covered. The cells are cuboidal or flattened, contain melanin. Melanin is the only pigment that most humans have. Red-haired people's pigment is pheomelanin.\n\nPigment cells from the bulls eye. Note the hexagonal shape of the cells that take form from the melanin granules inside them. The cells send processes between the processes of cones and rods. You may see where the larger diameter cones were located, since there are larger octagonal cells.\n\nOur newer slide is made from the eye of a rabbit. Find an area where the hexagonal shaped cells are well seen: here the pigment granules are smaller and lighter than in the previous preparation.\n\nIn some areas of the new slide the neighboring layer, the choroidea was not fully removed, because its connective tissue that is rich in melanocytes strongly adheres to the basal membrane of the pigmented epithelial cells. Melanocytes appear as dark strands in a different layer than the epithelium. Do not forget to move the micrometer to focus the different levels!\n\nGLANDS - INTRODUCTION\n\nBased on the purpose of the product and the mechanism of the secretion, the glands can be divided into two basic categories :\n\nThe endocrine glands, which lost direct contact with the surface and empty their products (named hormones) directly into the bloodstream. These compounds exert regulatory function affecting usually remote lareas of the body. The endocrine glands will be described in the 2nd and 3rd semester in details.\n\nThe exocrine glands empty their product onto an inner or outer body surface. Their product has mostly local effect (wetting, digesting, cooling) on the surface near the gland.\n\nBoth the endocrine and the exocrine glands originally develop from surface epithelium but the endocrine glands lose their contact with the surface. Exocrine glands may be located in the superficial epithelial layer (endoepithelial glands) or in the connective tissue beneath it (exoepithelial glands).\n\nEndoepithelial glands may consist of a\n\nsingle cell (unicellular gland) these are scattered among the epithelial cells of the lining epithelium,\n\nor of more cells ( multicellular intraepithelial glands), or sometimes\n\nall cells of the surface have secretory function, like in the stomach the mucus secreting columnar epithelial cells.\n\nExoepithelial glands have a secreting portions (acinus) from which, in most cases, ducts carry the secretum to the surface. We may further classify them based on the morphology of the secretory portion and duct, or functional aspects.\n\nThe exoepithelial glands are classifieed accordin tho morfological and functional criteria.\n\nThe morfological classification can be based on the duct and the secretory portion of the gland.\n\nAccording to the relationship between the ducts and the acinus, a gland can be\n\nsimple (one secretory portion - one duct), branching (ramified) (more secreting portions connect to one duct), or compound (more branching ducts empty into a common duct)\n\nAccording to the morphology of the secreting portion, glands can be\n\ntubular (tube shaped, can be straight or coiled), alveolar (rounded or sac like, acinar or saccular), or\n\nthe combination of both: tubuloalveolar.\n\nDifferent secreting portions can be combined with the different types of duct systems.\n\nBased on the mechanism of secretion glands are\n\nmerocrine,\n\napocrine, and\n\nholocrine\n\n.\n\nN.B.: We may name a particular glands based on the categories, described above, or use the specific, functional name like sweat gland, sebaceous gland, salivary gland, etc. The terms serous and mucous are for characterizing salivary glands only. E. g. you will see sweat glands (this is the name of the gland): these are exocrine, exoepithelial, simple coiled tubular (according to its built-up), merocrine (mechanism of secretion) glands. Pleas take note that like all epithelial tissues, glands are also separated by a basal membrane from the surrounding connective tissue! Glands also may be more or less active. In an active gland the cells are larger and taller.\n\n5. Unicellular, endoepithelial gland (goblet cell) PAS-H\n\nPAS-H staining. The slides were made from small intestine, jejunum. You have seen a similar slide recently, the simple columnar epithelium with striated border. There the goblet cells were whitish (routine haematoxyline method does not stain mucigen), in the PAS-H stained specimen they are purple. PAS reaction shows compounds with aldehyde groups, in this case the mucigen of carbohydrate character. The nuclei are stained with haematoxyline.\n\nGoblet cells are unicellular, endoepithelial glands, named after their shape. The handle of the goblet contains the triangular shaped nucleus, the goblet itself is the oval upper portion containing the mucigen droplets. The secretum may empty slowly, in this case we do not see a dramatic change in the shape of the cell or may loose its entire content, then a small indentation is left behind and the cell may cease secreting for a while. With this staining the cuticle is well stained since the microvilli are embedded into a glycocalyx (carbohydrate - PAS positive!). Other structures seen in the slide are the same as described before.\n\nThis PAS stained slide will not yet be exam slide on the final exams in December, 2000, but will be asked from the first year students!\n\nGoblet cells, HE\n\nFor 1st year students in 2000 demonstration only.\n\nSome types of haematoxyline do stain mucigen under special circumstances. With the common method the goblet cells are whitish, here they are dark blue. These slides were kept in haematoxyline individually to reach an optimal level and were not treated with HCl containing alcohol (\"were not differentiated\") after the haematoxyline staining. Haematoxyline stains mucigen specifically but washes off easily with HCl-alcohol during the regular procedure.\n\n(An advice: if a slide was not optimally differentiated after haematoxyline staining, that is it was \"overstained\", mucous glands will look more or less blue. You might see this phenomenon in some of our slides from esophagus and submandibular gland.)"
