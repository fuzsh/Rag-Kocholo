        "text": "Hi Lilly,\n\nSimple Squamous Epithelium: Single layered cells, usually found in areas of the body that depend on diffusion and filtration like the vessels, mucosal lining or the outer layer of the skin. Since the characteristics of the cells of this epithelium type are single, oblong and flat in appearance their nuclei are also flat and oblong with a large cytoplasmic region within the membrane.\n\nStratified Squamous Epithelium: Layers of Simple Squamous Epithelium \"stacked\" on top of each other.The layers of the skin and most glands in the body are composed of these layers and layers of cells. The nuclei should essentially be the same in size as the simple squamous epithelium because they are histologically (under a microscope) identical.\n\nThink of simple squamous epithelium as a single flat bed sheet on the ground. Next to it think of 50 identical flat bed sheets stacked on top of each other--this would represent stratified squamous epithelium."
