        "text": "Msx2 Prevents Stratified Squamous Epithelium Formation in the Enamel Organ.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakatomi, M; Ida-Yonemochi, H; Nakatomi, C; Saito, K; Kenmotsu, S; Maas, R L; Ohshima, H\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTooth enamel is manufactured by the inner enamel epithelium of the multilayered enamel organ. Msx2 loss-of-function mutation in a mouse model causes an abnormal accumulation of epithelial cells in the enamel organ, but the underlying mechanism by which Msx2 regulates amelogenesis is poorly understood. We therefore performed detailed histological and molecular analyses of Msx2 null mice. Msx2 null ameloblasts and stratum intermedium (SI) cells differentiated normally in the early stages of amelogenesis. However, during subsequent developmental stages, the outer enamel epithelium (OEE) became highly proliferative and transformed into a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that ectopically expressed stratified squamous epithelium markers, including Heat shock protein 25, Loricrin, and Keratin 10. Moreover, expression of hair follicle-specific keratin genes such as Keratin 26 and Keratin 73 was upregulated in the enamel organ of Msx2 mutants. With the accumulation of keratin in the stellate reticulum (SR) region and subsequent odontogenic cyst formation, SI cells gradually lost the ability to differentiate, and the expression of Sox2 and Notch1 was downregulated, leading to ameloblast depolarization. As a consequence, the organization of the Msx2 mutant enamel organ became disturbed and enamel failed to form in the normal location. Instead, there was ectopic mineralization that likely occurred within the SR. In summary, we show that during amelogenesis, Msx2 executes a bipartite function, repressing the transformation of OEE into a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium while simultaneously promoting the development of a properly differentiated enamel organ competent for enamel formation.\n\nSquamous metaplasia of the rete ovarii in a Zebu cow\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Stratified keratinizing squamous epithelium in the ovary has been associated with the diagnosis of ovarian teratoma in cows. Recently, the diagnosis of âepidermoid cystâ has been proposed. A case of squamous metaplasia of the rete ovarii in a Zebu cow is described in this report. Case presentation A crossbreed Zebu cow had both ovaries enlarged with multiple cysts. Most cysts were lined by well differentiated keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium and filled with keratinized lamellar material. Some cysts were lined by an epithelial layer that ranged from single cuboidal, double cuboidal epithelium, stratified non keratinized epithelium, and areas of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium. Single or double layered cuboidal epithelia of the cysts expressed low molecular weight cytokeratin 7, whose expression was absent in the keratinizing stratified squamous epithelia of same cysts. Conversely, high molecular weight cytokeratins 1, 5, 10, and 14 were strongly expressed by the keratinizing stratified epithelium. Conclusion Squamous metaplasia of the rete ovarii was diagnosed. Squamous metaplasia of the rete ovarii, may account for some of the previously described squamous lesions in the ovary, which may have been misinterpreted as teratoma or epidermoid cysts.

Its cause is poorly understood; therapy is symptomatic and often unsuccessful. To study urothelial involvement, we characterized the keratin phenotype of bladder urothelium in 18 patients with PBS/IC using a panel of 11 keratin antibodies recognizing simple keratins found in columnar epithelia (keratins 7, 8, 18, and 20) and keratins associated with basal cell compartments of squamous epithelia (keratins 5, 13, 14, and 17). We also tested 2 antibodies recognizing more than 1 keratin also directed against basal cell compartments of squamous epithelia (D5/16 B4 and 34betaE12). Bladder urothelium in PBS/IC showed distinct differences in the profiles of keratins 7, 8, 14, 17, 18, and 20 compared with literature reports for normal bladder urothelium. These were characterized by a shift from the normal bladder urothelial keratin phenotype to a more squamous keratin profile, despite the lack of morphologic evidence of squamous epithelial differentiation and a loss of compartmentalization of keratin expression. The severity of these changes varied between biopsy specimens. Whether these changes are primary or secondary to another underlying condition remains to be determined.\n\nA Comparative Immunohistochemical Study of Anal Canal Epithelium in Humans and Swine, Focusing on the Anal Transitional Zone Epithelium and the Anal Glands.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuranaka, Futoshi; Nakajima, Tomoyuki; Iwaya, Mai; Ishii, Keiko; Higuchi, Kayoko; Ogiwara, Naoko; Miyagawa, Shinichi; Ota, Hiroyoshi\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTo better understand the cellular origins and differentiation of anal canal epithelial neoplasms, the immunohistochemical profiles of the anal canal epithelium in humans and swine were evaluated. Formalin-fixed tissue sections were immunostained for mucin (MUC: MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B), desmoglein 3 (DGS3), p63, CDX2, SOX2, and Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA). The anal transitional zone (ATZ) epithelium covered the anal sinus and consisted of a stratified epithelium with mucous cells interspersed within the surface lining. Anal glands opened into the anal sinus. Ducts and acini of intraepithelial or periepithelial mucous type were the main structures of human anal glands, whereas those of swine were compound tubuloacinar mixed glands. Distal to the ATZ epithelium, non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium merged with the keratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the perianal skin. MUC5AC expression predominated over MUC5B expression in the ATZ epithelium, while MUC5B expression was higher in the anal glands. SOX2 was positive in the ATZ epithelium, anal glands, and squamous epithelium except in the perianal skin. In humans, DGS3 was expressed in the ATZ epithelium, anal gland ducts, and squamous epithelium. p63 was detected in the ATZ epithelium, anal glands, and squamous epithelium. Myoepithelial cells positive for Î±-SMA and p63 were present in the anal glands of swine. Colorectal columnar cells were MUC5B + /MUC2 + /CDX2 + /MUC5AC - /SOX2 - . The ATZ epithelium seems to be a distinctive epithelium, with morphological and functional features allowing smooth defecation. The MUC5AC + /SOX2 + /MUC2 - /CDX2 - profile of the ATZ epithelium and anal glands is a useful feature for diagnosing adenocarcinoma arising from these regions. Anat Rec, 301:796-805, 2018.

This report describes the distribution and localization of TM in the various types of epithelia in the rat by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. TM showed a limited distribution and was expressed by the keratinizing stratified epithelia of the skin, tongue, and esophagus, but was not present on the non-keratinizing epithelia of the vagina, ureter, trachea, stomach, or gut. An identical pattern of TM expression was seen in mucocutaneous junctions, transitional zones from a non-keratinizing stratified epithelium to a keratinizing epithelium at the edge of the eyelid and in the anal canal. As the keratinization of the stratified epithelia proceeded, the staining intensity increased in the transitional zones. Within the keratinizing stratified epithelia, TM staining was limited to the keratinocytes of the spinous layer, the spinous cells. The subcellular localization of TM on the spinous cells was restricted to the plasma membrane facing the intercellular spaces. TM was not detectable on the desmosomes or the two membranes making up the junction, presumably the nexus. The functional significance of TM in keratinizing epithelia is discussed.\n\nObjectivity in the classification of tumours of the nasal epithelium\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMichaels, L.; Hyams, V. J.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nA survey of tumours derived from each of the four cell types of nasal epithelium is presented. Criticism is levelled at the adoption of additional terms for tissue types such as lympho-epithelium and transitional cell epithelium and tumours said to be derived from them. Electron microscopy is of assistance in classification particularly in the detection of evidence of keratin synthesis. The proposed classification of tumours of the nasal epithelium is: (1) Pseudostratified columnar epithelium: (a) papillary adenoma, (b) papillary carcinoma. (2) Squamous epithelium: (a) everted squamous papilloma, (b) inverted papilloma, (c) squamous carcinoma of any grade of differentiation from well differentiated to undifferentiated. (3) Melanocyte: malignant melanoma. (4) Olfactory neuroepithelium: olfactory neuroblastoma.

We present a non-invasive, multimodal technique combining high-resolution fluorescence imaging and broadband sub-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (sDRS) to monitor health at various tissue layers. This manuscript focuses on characterization of the sDRS modality, which contains two source-detector separations (SDSs) of 374 Î¼m and 730 Î¼m, so that it can be used to extract in vivo optical parameters from human oral mucosa at two tissue thicknesses. First, we present empirical lookup tables (LUTs) describing the relationship between reduced scattering (Î¼s') and absorption coefficients (Î¼a) and absolute reflectance. LUTS were shown to extract Î¼s' and Î¼a with accuracies of approximately 4% and 8%, respectively. We then present LUTs describing the relationship between Î¼s', Î¼a and sampling depth. Sampling depths range between 210-480 and 260-620 Î¼m for the 374 and 730 Î¼m SDSs, respectively. We then demonstrate the ability to extract in vivo Î¼s', Î¼a, hemoglobin concentration, bulk tissue oxygen saturation, scattering exponent, and sampling depth from the inner lip of thirteen healthy volunteers to elucidate the differences in the extracted optical parameters from each SDS (374 and 730 Î¼m) within non-keratinized squamous epithelia.\n\nUltrastructural characteristics of carcinogen-induced nondysplastic changes in tracheal epithelium.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKlein-Szanto, A. J.; Topping, D. C.; Heckman, C. A.; Nettesheim, P.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nNondysplastic hypotrophic and metaplastic epithelial alterations induced by dimethylbenz(a)anthracene in isogenic tracheal transplants were studied by light and electron microscopy 3--24 months after cessation of a 4-week carcinogen exposure. Hypotrophic epithelium observed at all time points was characterized by the presence of nonciliated cells that adopted either cuboidal or squamous shapes, forming simple or bistratified epithelia. Most of these cells, as well as some metaplastic cells, exhibited features of mucin-secreting cells. The metaplastic epithelia showed nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia, closely related to transitional metaplasia, and keratinizing squamous metaplasia, which presented either an atrophic or an acanthotic epithelium. Although many of these epithelia showed morphologic features of normal stratified epithelia, several nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasias and acanthotic keratinizing squamous metaplasias exhibited some irregularities, probably representing very early atypical ultrastructural features (ie, perinuclear concentration of tonofilament bundles, the presence of dark and clear basal epithelial cells, interruptions and alterations of the basal lamina). These features were not observed in a group of early squamous metaplasias studied for comparative purposes 2 weeks after cessation of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene exposure, which were characterized by a combination of degenerative phenomena and increased cell proliferation.

M.\n\n1966-01-01\n\nPermeability barriers must exist in transitional epithelium to prevent the free flow of water from underlying blood capillaries through the epithelium into the hypertonic urine, and such a barrier has now been demonstrated in isolated bladders. This barrier is passive in function and can be destroyed by damaging the luminal surface of the transitional epithelium with sodium hydroxide and 8 M urea solutions, by digesting it with trypsin, lecithinase C, and lecithinase D, or by treating it with lipid solvents such as Triton x 100 and saponin. From this it is concluded that the barrier depends on the integrity of lipoprotein cell membranes. The barrier function is also destroyed by sodium thioglycollate solutions, and electron microscope investigations show that sodium thioglycollate damages the thick asymmetric membrane which limits the luminal face of the superficial squamous cell. Cytochemical staining shows the epithelium to contain disulfide and thiol groups and to have a concentration of these groups at the luminal margin of the superficial cells. It thus appears that the permeability barrier also depends on the presence of disulfide bridges in the epithelium, and it is presumed that these links are located in keratin. Because of the effect of thioglycollates, both on the barrier function and on the morphology of the membrane, it is suggested that keratin may be incorporated in the thick barrier membrane. It is proposed that the cells lining the urinary bladder and ureters should be regarded as a keratinizing epitheluim.

An immunohistochemical study.\n\nPubMed\n\nNathrath, W B; Arnholdt, H; Wilson, P D\n\n1982-01-01\n\n14 urinary bladder carcinomas of all main types were investigated with antisera to \"broad spectrum keratin\" (aK), \"luminal epithelial antigen\" (aLEA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (aCEA), using an indirect immunoperoxidase method on formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections. Keratin and LEA were both present in normal transitional epithelium, papilloma and carcinoma in situ whereas CEA was absent. Transitional cell carcinomas reacted with both aK and aLEA whereas CEA was seen only in a few foci. In squamous metaplasia and squamous carcinoma reaction with aK was particularly strong, while LEA was almost lacking and CEA was present in necrotic centres. In adenocarcinomas aK and aLEA reacted equally while aCEA reacted only on the surface.\n\nLocalization of Alpha-Keratin and Beta-Keratin (Corneous Beta Protein) in the Epithelium on the Ventral Surface of the Lingual Apex and Its Lingual Nail in the Domestic Goose (Anser Anser f. domestica) by Using Immunohistochemistry and Raman Microspectroscopy Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSkieresz-Szewczyk, Kinga; Jackowiak, Hanna; Buchwald, Tomasz; Szybowicz, MirosÅaw\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe epithelium of the ventral surface of the apex of the tongue in most birds is specified by the presence of the special superficial layer called lingual nail. The aim of the present study is to determine the localization of the alpha-keratin and beta-keratin (corneous beta protein) in this special epithelium in the domestic goose by using immunohistochemistry staining and the Raman spectroscopy analysis. Due to lack of commercially available antibodies to detect beta-keratin (corneous beta protein), the Raman spectroscopy was used as a specific tool to detect and describe the secondary structure of proteins. The immunohistochemical (IHC) detections reveal the presence of alpha-keratin in all layers of the epithelium, but significant differences in the distribution of the alpha-keratin in the epithelial layers appear. The staining reaction is stronger from the basal layer to the upper zone of the intermediate layer. The unique result is weak staining for the alpha-keratin in the lingual nail. Applications of the Raman spectroscopy as a complementary method not only confirmed results of IHC staining for alpha-keratin, but showed that this technique could be used to demonstrate the presence of beta-keratin (corneous beta protein). Functionally, the localization of alpha-keratin in the epithelium of the ventral surface of the lingual apex provides a proper scaffold for epithelial cells and promotes structural integrity, whereas the presence of beta-keratin (corneous beta protein) in the lingual nail, described also as exoskeleton of the ventral surface of the apex, endures mechanical stress.

Five women had a diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer discovered at hysterectomy performed for prolapse (two cases), leiomyoma (one case), or a vaginal fistula (two cases). The women ranged in age from 47 to 78 years (mean 59 years). Four of the five had a history of normal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears; the other had a Pap smear diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). All had large cervical tumors (two with parametrial involvement and one with vaginal involvement) that showed extensive keratin formation, an inverted pattern of growth, and, except for one case, minimal cytologic atypia. There was extensive hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis adjacent to each tumor; none had evidence of squamous intraepithelial lesion. Human papillomavirus testing by polymerase chain reaction in situ hybridization and reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction in situ was negative in each case, compared with a detection rate of 107 of 108 (99%) for squamous intraepithelial lesion-associated cervical squamous cell and adenocarcinomas. Two of the women died of extensive local recurrence; two other women were recently diagnosed. We conclude that highly differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is a rare entity not associated with human papillomavirus infection or squamous intraepithelial lesion and thus difficult to detect on routine cervical cancer screening.\n\nDelineation of Matriptase Protein Expression by Enzymatic Gene Trapping Suggests Diverging Roles in Barrier Function, Hair Formation, and Squamous Cell Carcinogenesis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nList, Karin; Szabo, Roman; Molinolo, Alfredo; Nielsen, Boye Schnack; Bugge, Thomas H.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe membrane serine protease matriptase is required for epidermal barrier function, hair formation, and thymocyte development in mice, and dysregulated matriptase expression causes epidermal squamous cell carcinoma. To elucidate the specific functions of matriptase in normal and aberrant epidermal differentiation, we used enzymatic gene trapping combined with immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and barrier function assays to delineate the spatio-temporal expression and function of matriptase in mouse keratinized tissue development, homeostasis, and malignant transformation. In the interfollicular epidermis, matriptase expression was restricted to postmitotic transitional layer keratinocytes undergoing terminal differentiation. Matriptase was also expressed in keratinizing oral epithelium, where it was required for oral barrier function, and in thymic epithelium. In all three tissues, matriptase colocalized with profilaggrin. In staged embryos, the onset of epidermal matriptase expression coincided with that of profilaggrin expression and acquisition of the epidermal barrier. In marked contrast to stratifying keritinized epithelium, matripase expression commenced already in undifferentiated and rapidly proliferating profilaggrin-negative matrix cells and displayed hair growth cycle-dependent expression. Exposure of the epidermis to carcinogens led to the gradual appearance of matriptase in a keratin-5-positive proliferative cell compartment during malignant progression. Combined with previous studies, these data suggest that matriptase has diverging functions in the genesis of stratified keratinized epithelium, hair follicles, and squamous cell carcinoma.

P.; Alam, Hunain; Dmello, Crismita; Vaidya, Milind M.; Krishna, C. Murali\n\n2012-03-01\n\nKeratins are one of most widely used markers for oral cancers. Keratin 8 and 18 are expressed in simple epithelia and perform both mechanical and regulatory functions. Their expression are not seen in normal oral tissues but are often expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Aberrant expression of keratins 8 and 18 is most common change in human oral cancer. Optical-spectroscopic methods are sensitive to biochemical changes and being projected as novel diagnostic tools for cancer diagnosis. Aim of this study was to evaluate potentials of Raman spectroscopy in detecting minor changes associated with differential level of keratin expression in tongue-cancer-derived AW13516 cells. Knockdown clones for K8 were generated and synchronized by growing under serum-free conditions. Cell pellets of three independent experiments in duplicate were used for recording Raman spectra with fiberoptic-probe coupled HE-785 Raman-instrument. A total of 123 and 96 spectra from knockdown clones and vector controls respectively in 1200-1800 cm-1 region were successfully utilized for classification using LDA. Two separate clusters with classification-efficiency of ~95% were obtained. Leave-one-out cross-validation yielded ~63% efficiency. Findings of the study demonstrate the potentials of Raman spectroscopy in detecting even subtle changes such as variations in keratin expression levels. Future studies towards identifying Raman signals from keratin in oral cells can help in precise cancer diagnosis.\n\nEpithelial estrogen receptor 1 intrinsically mediates squamous differentiation in the mouse vagina.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyagawa, Shinichi; Iguchi, Taisen\n\n2015-10-20\n\nEstrogen-mediated actions in female reproductive organs are tightly regulated, mainly through estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1). The mouse vaginal epithelium cyclically exhibits cell proliferation and differentiation in response to estrogen and provides a unique model for analyzing the homeostasis of stratified squamous epithelia. To address the role of ESR1-mediated tissue events during homeostasis, we analyzed mice with a vaginal epithelium-specific knockout of Esr1 driven by keratin 5-Cre (K5-Esr1KO). We show here that loss of epithelial ESR1 in the vagina resulted in aberrant epithelial cell proliferation in the suprabasal cell layers and led to failure of keratinized differentiation. Gene expression analysis showed that several known estrogen target genes, including erbB growth factor ligands, were not induced by estrogen in the K5-Esr1KO mouse vagina. Organ culture experiments revealed that the addition of erbB growth factor ligands, such as amphiregulin, could activate keratinized differentiation in the absence of epithelial ESR1. Thus, epithelial ESR1 integrates estrogen and growth factor signaling to mediate regulation of cell proliferation in squamous differentiation, and our results provide new insights into estrogen-mediated homeostasis in female reproductive organs.\n\nProteomics and immunohistochemistry define some of the steps involved in the squamous differentiation of the bladder transitional epithelium: a novel strategy for identifying metaplastic lesions.\n\nPubMed\n\nCelis, J E; Celis, P; Ostergaard, M; Basse, B; Lauridsen, J B; Ratz, G; Rasmussen, H H; Orntoft, T F; Hein, B; Wolf, H; Celis, A\n\n1999-06-15\n\nHere, we present a novel strategy for dissecting some of the steps involved in the squamous differentiation of the bladder urothelium leading to squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). First, we used proteomic technologies and databases (http://biobase.dk/cgi-bin/celis) to reveal proteins that were expressed specifically by fresh normal urothelium and three SCCs showing no urothelial components. Thereafter, antibodies against some of the differentially expressed proteins as well as a few known keratinocyte markers were used to stain serial cryostat sections (immunowalking) of biopsies obtained from bladder cystectomies of two of the SCC-bearing patients (884-1 and 864-1). Because bladder cancer is a field disease, we surmised that the urothelium of these patients may exhibit a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from early metaplastic stages to invasive disease. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed three types of non-keratinizing metaplastic lesions (types 1-3) that did not express keratins 7, 8, 18, and 20 (expressed by normal urothelium) and could be distinguished based on their staining with keratin 19 antibodies. Type 1 lesions showed staining of all cell layers in the epithelium (with differences in the staining intensity of the basal compartment), whereas type 2 lesions exhibited mainly basal cell staining. Type 3 lesions did not stain with keratin 19 antibodies. In cystectomy 884-1, type 3 lesions exhibited the same immunophenotype as the SCC and may be regarded as precursors to the tumor. Basal cells in these lesions did not express keratin 13, suggesting that the tumor, which was also keratin 13 negative, may have arisen from the expansion of these cells. Similar results were observed with cystectomy 864-1, which showed carcinoma in situ of the SCC type. SCC 864-1 exhibited both keratin 19-negative and -positive cells, implying that the tumor arose from the expansion of the basal cell compartment of type 2 and 3 lesions. Besides providing with a novel strategy for\n\nEpithelial estrogen receptor 1 intrinsically mediates squamous differentiation in the mouse vagina\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiyagawa, Shinichi; Iguchi, Taisen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nEstrogen-mediated actions in female reproductive organs are tightly regulated, mainly through estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1).

The goals of the current study were to identify and validate novel candidate biomarkers that could potentially improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy for cervical HSIL and squamous cell carcinoma. Microdissected tissue sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal ectocervical squamous mucosa, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), HSIL and squamous cell carcinoma sections were analyzed by mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics for biomarker discovery. The diagnostic specificity of candidate biomarkers was subsequently evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays. Among 1750 proteins identified by proteomic analyses, keratin 4 (KRT4) and keratin 17 (KRT17) showed reciprocal patterns of expression in the spectrum of cases ranging from normal ectocervical squamous mucosa to squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed that KRT4 expression was significantly decreased in squamous cell carcinoma compared with the other diagnostic categories. By contrast, KRT17 expression was significantly increased in HSIL and squamous cell carcinoma compared with normal ectocervical squamous mucosa and LSIL. KRT17 was also highly expressed in immature squamous metaplasia and in endocervical reserve cells but was generally not detected in mature squamous metaplasia. Furthermore, high levels of KRT17 expression were significantly associated with poor survival of squamous cell carcinoma patients (Hazard ratio = 14.76, P = 0.01). In summary, both KRT4 and KRT17 expressions are related to the histopathology of the cervical squamous mucosa; KRT17 is highly overexpressed in immature squamous metaplasia, in HSIL, and in squamous cell carcinoma and the level of KRT17 in squamous cell carcinoma may help to identify\n\nKeratins 17 and 19 expression as prognostic markers in oral squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoelho, B A; Peterle, G T; Santos, M; Agostini, L P; Maia, L L; Stur, E; Silva, C V M; Mendes, S O; AlmanÃ§a, C C J; Freitas, F V; BorÃ§oi, A R; Archanjo, A B; Mercante, A M C; Nunes, F D; Carvalho, M B; Tajara, E H; Louro, I D; Silva-Conforti, A M A\n\n2015-11-25\n\nFive-year survival rates for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are 30% and the mortality rate is 50%. Immunohistochemistry panels are used to evaluate proliferation, vascularization, apoptosis, HPV infection, and keratin expression, which are important markers of malignant progression. Keratins are a family of intermediate filaments predominantly expressed in epithelial cells and have an essential role in mechanical support and cytoskeleton formation, which is essential for the structural integrity and stability of the cell. In this study, we analyzed the expressions of keratins 17 and 19 (K17 and K19) by immunohistochemistry in tumoral and non-tumoral tissues from patients with OSCC. The results show that expression of these keratins is higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. Positive K17 expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and multivariate analysis confirmed this relationship, revealing a 6-fold increase in lymph node metastasis when K17 is expressed. We observed a correlation between K17 expression with disease-free survival and disease-specific death in patients who received surgery and radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that low expression of K17 was an independent marker for early disease relapse and disease-specific death in patients treated with surgery and radiotherapy, with an approximately 4-fold increased risk when compared to high K17 expression. Our results suggest a potential role for K17 and K19 expression profiles as tumor prognostic markers in OSCC patients.\n\nIdentification of Distinct Layers Within the Stratified Squamous Epithelium of the Adult Human True Vocal Fold\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDowdall, Jayme R.; Sadow, Peter M.; Hartnick, Christopher; Vinarsky, Vladimir; Mou, Hongmei; Zhao, Rui; Song, Phillip C.; Franco, Ramon A.; Rajagopal, Jayaraj\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives/Hypothesis A precise molecular schema for classifying the different cell types of the normal human vocal fold epithelium is lacking. We hypothesize that the true vocal fold epithelium has a cellular architecture and organization similar to that of other stratified squamous epithelia including the skin, cornea, oral mucosa, and esophagus. In analogy to disorders of the skin and gastrointestinal tract, a molecular definition of the normal cell types within the human vocal fold epithelium and a description of their geometric relationships should serve as a foundation for characterizing cellular changes associated with metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer. Study Design Qualitative study with adult human larynges. Methods Histologic sections of normal human laryngeal tissue were analyzed for morphology (hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemical protein expression profile, including cytokeratins (CK13 and CK14), cornified envelope proteins (involucrin), basal cells (NGFR/p75), and proliferation markers (Ki67). Results We demonstrated that three distinct cell strata with unique marker profiles are present within the stratified squamous epithelium of the true vocal fold. We used these definitions to establish that cell proliferation is restricted to certain cell types and layers within the epithelium. These distinct cell types are reproducible across five normal adult larynges. Conclusion We have established that three layers of cells are present within the normal adult stratified squamous epithelium of the true vocal fold. Furthermore, replicating cell populations are largely restricted to the parabasal strata within the epithelium. This delineation of distinct cell populations will facilitate future studies of vocal fold regeneration and cancer. Level of Evidence N/A.

In this study, we investigated the effect of a small molecule, APR-246/PRIMA-1(Met), on squamous metaplasia in human conjunctival epithelium. Human conjunctival explants were cultured for up to 12 days under airlifting conditions. Epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation were assessed by Cytokeratin 10 (K10), K14, K19, Pax6, MUC5AC, and p63 immunostaining patterns. Î²-catenin and TCF-4 immunofluorescent staining and real-time PCR characterized Wnt signaling pathway involvement. Pterygium clinical samples were cultured under airlifting conditions with or without APR-246 for 4 days. p63, K10, Î²-catenin, and TCF-4 expression in pterygial epithelium was determined by immunofluorescent staining and real-time PCR. Airlift conjunctival explants resulted in increased stratification and intrastromal epithelial invagination. Such pathology was accompanied by increases in K10, K14, and p63 expression, whereas K19 and Pax6 levels declined when compared to those in freshly isolated tissue. On the other hand, APR-246 reversed all of these declines in K10, K14, and p63 expression. Furthermore, K19 and Pax6 increased along with rises in goblet cell density. These effects of APR-246 were accompanied by near restoration of normal conjunctival epithelial histology. APR-246 also reversed squamous metaplasia in pterygial epithelium that had developed after 4 days in ex vivo culture. Reductions in squamous metaplasia induced by APR-246 suggest it may provide a novel therapeutic approach in different squamous metaplasia-associated ocular surface diseases.\n\nLong-lived keratin 15+ esophageal progenitor cells contribute to homeostasis and regeneration\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGiroux, VÃ©ronique; Lento, Ashley A.; Islam, Mirazul; Pitarresi, Jason R.; Kharbanda, Akriti; Hamilton, Kathryn E.; Whelan, Kelly A.; Long, Apple; Rhoades, Ben; Tang, Qiaosi; Nakagawa, Hiroshi; Lengner, Christopher J.; Bass, Adam J.; Wileyto, E. Paul; Klein-Szanto, Andres J.; Wang, Timothy C.; Rustgi, Anil K.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe esophageal lumen is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium comprised of proliferative basal cells that differentiate while migrating toward the luminal surface and eventually desquamate. Rapid epithelial renewal occurs, but the specific cell of origin that supports this high proliferative demand remains unknown. Herein, we have described a long-lived progenitor cell population in the mouse esophageal epithelium that is characterized by expression of keratin 15 (Krt15). Genetic in vivo lineage tracing revealed that the Krt15 promoter marks a long-lived basal cell population able to self-renew, proliferate, and generate differentiated cells, consistent with a progenitor/stem cell population. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Krt15+ basal cells are molecularly distinct from Krt15â basal cells. Depletion of Krt15-derived cells resulted in decreased proliferation, thereby leading to atrophy of the esophageal epithelium. Further, Krt15+ cells were radioresistant and contributed to esophageal epithelial regeneration following radiation-induced injury. These results establish the presence of a long-lived and indispensable Krt15+ progenitor cell population that provides additional perspective on esophageal epithelial biology and the widely prevalent diseases that afflict this epithelium.

Comparisons of histological and ultrastructural features of the tongue of the juvenile Hawksbill turtle, Eretmochelys imbricata bissa, with those of freshwater turtles should reveal some aspects of the relationship between the structure of the lingual epithelium and the environment. The light microscope, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope were used. Light microscopy revealed that the mucosal epithelium of the tongue was of the keratinized, stratified squamous type. Under the scanning electron microscope, no lingual papillae were visible on the dorsal surface of the tongue. Micropits and the thickening of cell margins were clearly seen on the surface of cells located on the outermost side. The transmission electron microscope revealed that the cells in the intermediate layer were gradually flattened from the basal side to the surface side, as were their nuclei. In the shallow intermediate layer, the cells were significantly flattened, and their nuclei were condensed or had disappeared. The cytoplasm contained keratohyalin granules, tonofibrils, free ribosomes, mitochondria, and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Numerous free ribosomes were attached to the surface of small keratohyalin granules. The cells of the keratinized layer were significantly flattened, and their nuclei had completely disappeared. Most of cytoplasm was filled with keratin fibers of high electron density. Keratin fibers of the shedding cells, which were located on the outermost side of the keratinized layer, appeared looser, and each fiber, which was somewhat thicker than the tonofibrils and tonofilaments, was clearly distinguishable. The lingual epithelium of the juvenile Hawksbill turtle differs significantly from that of the adult freshwater turtle, in spite of the similarity in gross morphology of the tongues of these species.\n\nReference spectra from squamous epithelium and connective tissue allow whole section proteomics analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoesch-Ely, Mariana; SchnÃ¶lzer, Martina; Nees, Matthias; Plinkert, Peter K; Bosch, Franz X\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe reasoned that micro-dissection of tumour cells for protein expression studies should be omitted since tumour-stroma interactions are an important part of the biology of solid tumours. To study such interactions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) development, we generated reference protein spectra for normal squamous epithelium and connective tissue by SELDI-TOF-MS. Calgranulins A and B, Annexin1 and Histone H4 were found to be strongly enriched in the epithelium. The alpha-defensins 1-3 and the haemoglobin subunits were identified in the connective tissue. Tumour-distant epithelia, representing early pre-malignant lesions, showed up-regulated expression of the stromal alpha-defensins, whereas the epithelial Annexin 1 was down-regulated. Thus, tumour microenvironment interactions occur very early in the carcinogenic process. These data demonstrate that omitting micro-dissection is actually beneficial for studying changes in protein expression during development and progression of solid tumours.\n\nStructure and functions of keratin proteins in simple, stratified, keratinized and cornified epithelia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBragulla, Hermann H; Homberger, Dominique G\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHistorically, the term âkeratinâ stood for all of the proteins extracted from skin modifications, such as horns, claws and hooves. Subsequently, it was realized that this keratin is actually a mixture of keratins, keratin filament-associated proteins and other proteins, such as enzymes. Keratins were then defined as certain filament-forming proteins with specific physicochemical properties and extracted from the cornified layer of the epidermis, whereas those filament-forming proteins that were extracted from the living layers of the epidermis were grouped as âprekeratinsâ or âcytokeratinsâ. Currently, the term âkeratinâ covers all intermediate filament-forming proteins with specific physicochemical properties and produced in any vertebrate epithelia. Similarly, the nomenclature of epithelia as cornified, keratinized or non-keratinized is based historically on the notion that only the epidermis of skin modifications such as horns, claws and hooves is cornified, that the non-modified epidermis is a keratinized stratified epithelium, and that all other stratified and non-stratified epithelia are non-keratinized epithelia. At this point in time, the concepts of keratins and of keratinized or cornified epithelia need clarification and revision concerning the structure and function of keratin and keratin filaments in various epithelia of different species, as well as of keratin genes and their modifications, in view of recent research, such as the sequencing of keratin proteins and their genes, cell culture, transfection of epithelial cells, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Recently, new functions of keratins and keratin filaments in cell signaling and intracellular vesicle transport have been discovered. It is currently understood that all stratified epithelia are keratinized and that some of these keratinized stratified epithelia cornify by forming a Stratum corneum. The processes of keratinization and cornification in skin modifications are\n\nReactivation of larval keratin gene (krt62.L) in blastema epithelium during Xenopus froglet limb regeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nSatoh, Akira; Mitogawa, Kazumasa; Saito, Nanami; Suzuki, Miyuki; Suzuki, Ken-Ichi T; Ochi, Haruki; Makanae, Aki\n\n2017-12-15\n\nLimb regeneration is considered a form of limb redevelopment because of the molecular and morphological similarities. Forming a regeneration blastema is, in essence, creating a developing limb bud in an adult body. This reactivation of a developmental process in a mature body is worth studying. Xenopus laevis has a biphasic life cycle that involves distinct larval and adult stages. These distinct developmental stages are useful for investigating the reactivation of developmental processes in post-metamorphic frogs (froglets). In this study, we focused on the re-expression of a larval gene (krt62.L) during Xenopus froglet limb regeneration. Recently renamed krt62.L, this gene was known as the larval keratin (xlk) gene, which is specific to larval-tadpole stages. During limb regeneration in a froglet, krt62.L was re-expressed in a basal layer of blastema epithelium, where adult-specific keratin (Krt12.6.S) expression was also observable. Nerves produce important regulatory factors for amphibian limb regeneration, and also play a role in blastema formation and maintenance. The effect of nerve function on krt62.L expression could be seen in the maintenance of krt62.L expression, but not in its induction. When an epidermis-stripped limb bud was grafted in a froglet blastema, the grafted limb bud could reach the digit-forming stage. This suggests that krt62.L-positive froglet blastema epithelium is able to support the limb development process. These findings imply that the developmental process is locally reactivated in an postmetamorphic body during limb regeneration. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Differentiated cells in skin epithelium and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma highly express the neuropilin-1 (NRP1) receptor. We examined the expression of NRP1 in human and mouse oral mucosa. NRP1 was significantly up-regulated in oral epithelial dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). NRP1 receptor localized to the outer suprabasal epithelial layers in normal tongue, an expression pattern similar to the normal skin epidermis. However, dysplastic tongue epithelium and OSCC up-regulated NRP1 in basal and proliferating epithelial layers, a profile unseen in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. NRP1 up-regulation is observed in a mouse carcinogen-induced OSCC model and in human tongue OSCC biopsies. Human OSCC cell lines express NRP1 protein in vitro and in mouse tongue xenografts. Sites of capillary infiltration into orthotopic OSCC tumors correlate with high NRP1 expression. HSC3 xenografts, which express the highest NRP1 levels of the cell lines examined, showed massive intratumoral lymphangiogenesis. SEMA3A inhibited OSCC cell migration, suggesting that the NRP1 receptor was bioactive in OSCC. In conclusion, NRP1 is regulated in the oral epithelium and is selectively up-regulated during epithelial dysplasia. NRP1 may function as a reservoir to sequester proangiogenic ligands within the neoplastic compartment, thereby recruiting neovessels toward tumor cells.

These epithelia are composed of three layers: basal, intermediate and keratinized. The present study showed detailed ultrastructural features of cells in particular layers of two types of keratinized epithelia on the tongue in the domestic duck and defined structural differences. TEM observations showed a gradual reduction in cell organelles in the following layers, at increasing amounts of keratin fibers. The characteristic feature of the ortho- and parakeratinized epithelium is the presence of sub-layers in the intermediate layer, i.e. the upper and lower part, which results from the different shape of cell nuclei and dye affinity of the cytoplasm. The keratinized layer of ortho- and parakeratinized epithelium is built of two types of cells such as electron dark and light cells, which undergo exfoliation. The basic difference between the keratinized epithelia is the presence of flattened cell nuclei in the keratinized layer of the parakeratinized epithelium. The differentiating feature is also an arrangement of keratin fibers in the cell cytoplasm of the keratinized layer. The analysis of the thickness of the epithelium and the keratinized layer, indicated differences between keratinized epithelia, which result from two variants of performing protective functions, either through a thick keratinized layer or by a higher epithelium. Differences in the ultrastructure of the ortho- and parakeratinized epithelium are associated with mechanical functions of the epithelium resulting from different forces acting on the tongue during feeding activities.

We demonstrate here that plastin 1 accumulates in the terminal web and interacts with keratin 19, possibly contributing to anchoring the rootlets to the keratin network. This prompted us to investigate the importance of plastin 1 in brush border assembly. Although in vivo neither villin nor espin is required for brush border structure, plastin 1-deficient mice have conspicuous ultrastructural alterations: microvilli are shorter and constricted at their base, and, strikingly, their core actin bundles lack true rootlets. The composition of the microvilli themselves is apparently normal, whereas that of the terminal web is profoundly altered. Although the plastin 1 knockout mice do not show any overt gross phenotype and present a normal intestinal microanatomy, the alterations result in increased fragility of the epithelium. This is seen as an increased sensitivity of the brush border to biochemical manipulations, decreased transepithelial resistance, and increased sensitivity to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Plastin 1 thus emerges as an important regulator of brush border morphology and stability through a novel role in the organization of the terminal web, possibly by connecting actin filaments to the underlying intermediate filament network.

The patient succumbed to the disease within one month of diagnosis. Autopsy revealed a 10-cm esophageal tumor, characterized by prominent acantholysis-like areas composed of discohesive cancer cells, along with nested growth of SCC. These discohesive cancer cells focally exhibited pagetoid extension into adjacent esophageal epithelium, comprised ~60% of the esophageal tumor volume and had widely metastasized to the lungs, chest wall, liver, spleen, right adrenal gland, bones and lymph nodes. No metastases of SCC were observed. SCC cells were immunohistochemically positive for keratin 5/6 and E-cadherin and were negative for mucin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). However, the discohesive cancer cells exhibited negativity for keratin 5/6, positivity for mucin and CEA, and diminished or no immunostaining for E-cadherin. Thus, these discohesive cells represented true adenocarcinomatous differentiation rather than acantholytic SCC cells. It was concluded that this tumor was an esophageal adenosquamous carcinoma with âpseudoâ-acantholytic adenocarcinoma components, which should be considered as a rare but distinctive type of aggressive cancer.

After explanation into either type of medium without addition of the hormone the vaginal epithelium spontaneously forms new squamous keratinising epithelium which displaces the original secretory epithelium. Addition of oestrone to the medium stimulates the growth of the new cells and hastens and increases keratin synthesis. Exposure to 200 r of x rays given one day after explanation inhibits the squamous development, suppresses keratin formation and preserves the original epithelium inmoreÂ Â» both normal and oestrone-treated explants grown in natural medium. Radiation of cultures kept in defined medium fails to influence the normal squamous differentiation and keratinisation. The mechanism of radiation action is discussed in the light of the differnet results obtained under the two conditions.

For Exp. 1, five rumen cannulated Nellore bulls were used in a 5x5 Latin square arrangement, with 14 d for adaptation and 9 d for sample collection. Treatments were: dry ground corn, dry ground sorghum, reconstituted corn, reconstituted sorghum, and control (forage-based diet). Samples of rumen epithelium from ventral sac were excised, rinsed, snap-frozen and stored at -80Â°C until total RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. In the Exp. 2, 24 Nellore bulls were assigned to a completely randomized design lasting 168 d. Experimental treatments were similar to those at Exp. 1, but without the control treatment. After the experimental period, bulls were slaughtered and rumen epithelium samples were rapidly excised for further histological analysis. Rumen epithelial tissue from animals fed reconstituted corn had lower expression of downregulated-in-adenoma (P = 0.03) and Na+/H+ exchanger 2 (trend; P = 0.09). The expression of Na+/ H+ exchanger 1 (P = 0.10) and putative anion transporter (P = 0.06) tended to be lower in rumen epithelium of bulls fed reconstituted grains. Ruminal concentration of valerate was greater for animals fed reconstituted grain (P = 0.01). Likewise, animals fed reconstituted corn tended to have greater butyrate ruminal concentration (P = 0.08). Keratinized layer thickness did not differ among treatments (P > 0.10). Therefore, reconstituted grains (especially corn) decrease the mRNA expression of genes involved in volatile fatty acids transport and pH control in the rumen epithelium.

We have found that the stratified squamous epithelium of the nonsecreting area of horse stomach is colonized by gram-positive rods. The microscopic features of a dense layer of these bacteria on the epithelium were found to be similar to those reported in mice, rats, and swine. Adhering microorganisms were isolated and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, L. crispatus, L. reuteri, and L. agilis by DNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing techniques. These lactobacilli associated with the horse, except for L. reuteri, were found to adhere to horse epithelial cells in vitro but not to those of rats. A symbiotic relationship of these lactobacilli with the horse is suggested.

It has been described in a number of different ancestral groups. To date, all reported cases of MECD have been associated with either a single mutation in one exon of the keratin-3 gene (KRT3) or a single mutation in one of two exons of the keratin-12 gene (KRT12). Each mutation leads to a predicted amino acid change in the respective keratin-3 or keratin-12 proteins that combine to form the corneal-specific heterodimeric intermediate filament protein. This case report describes a four-generation Chinese kindred with typical autosomal-dominant MECD. Exon sequencing of KRT3 and KRT12 in six affected and eight unaffected individuals (including two spouses) did not detect any mutations or nucleotide sequence variants. This kindred demonstrates that single mis-sense mutations may be sufficient but are not required in all individuals with the MECD phenotype. It provides a unique opportunity to investigate further genomic and functional heterogeneity in MECD.\n\nAutophagy and KRT8/keratin 8 protect degeneration of retinal pigment epithelium under oxidative stress.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaek, Ahruem; Yoon, Soojin; Kim, Jean; Baek, Yu Mi; Park, Hanna; Lim, Daehan; Chung, Hyewon; Kim, Dong-Eun\n\n2017-02-01\n\nContribution of autophagy and regulation of related proteins to the degeneration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remain unknown. We report that upregulation of KRT8 (keratin 8) as well as its phosphorylation are accompanied with autophagy and attenuated with the inhibition of autophagy in RPE cells under oxidative stress. KRT8 appears to have a dual role in RPE pathophysiology. While increased expression of KRT8 following autophagy provides a cytoprotective role in RPE, phosphorylation of KRT8 induces pathologic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of RPE cells under oxidative stress, which is mediated by MAPK1/ERK2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 1) and MAPK3/ERK1. Inhibition of autophagy further promotes EMT, which can be reversed by inhibition of MAPK. Thus, regulated enhancement of autophagy with concurrent increased expression of KRT8 and the inhibition of KRT8 phosphorylation serve to inhibit oxidative stress-induced EMT of RPE cells as well as to prevent cell death, suggesting that pharmacological manipulation of KRT8 upregulation through autophagy with combined inhibition of the MAPK1/3 pathway may be attractive therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AMD.\n\nSquamous epithelial proliferation induced by walleye dermal sarcoma retrovirus cyclin in transgenic mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLairmore, Michael D.; Stanley, James R.; Weber, Stacy A.; Holzschu, Donald L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nWalleye dermal sarcoma (WDS) is a common disease of walleye fish in the United States and Canada.

We have reported that the D-cyclin homologue [retroviral (rv) cyclin] encoded by WDSV rescues yeast conditionally deficient for cyclin synthesis from growth arrest and that WDSV-cyclin mRNA is present in developing tumors. These data strongly suggest that the rv-cyclin plays a central role in the development of WDS. To test the ability of the WDSV rv-cyclin to induce cell proliferation, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the rv-cyclin in squamous epithelia from the bovine keratin-5 promoter. The transgenic animals were smaller than littermates, had reduced numbers of hair follicles, and transgenic females did not lactate properly. Following injury the transgenic animals developed severe squamous epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia with ultrastructural characteristics of neoplastic squamous epithelium. Immunocytochemistry studies demonstrated that the hyperplastic epithelium stained positive for cytokeratin and were abnormally differentiated. Furthermore, the rv-cyclin protein was detected in the thickened basal cell layers of the proliferating lesions. These data are the first to indicate that the highly divergent WDSV rv-cyclin is a very potent stimulator of eukaryotic cell proliferation and to demonstrate the potential of a cyclin homologue encoded by a retrovirus to induce hyperplastic skin lesions.

Here, we characterize an in vitro model that permits analysis of the earliest steps in the transition of hESC colonies to squamous epithelium on basic fibroblast growth factor withdrawal. A set of markers (GSC, CK18, Gata4, Eomes, and Sox17) point to a mesendodermal nature of the epithelial cells with subsequent commitment to definitive endoderm (Sox17, Cdx2, nestin, and Islet1). We assayed alterations in the transcriptome in parallel with the distribution of immunohistochemical markers. Our results indicate that the alterations of tight junctions in pluripotent culture precede the beginning of differentiation. We defined this cell population as \"specified,\" as it is committed toward differentiation. The transitional zone between \"specified\" pluripotent and differentiated cells displays significant up-regulation of keratin-18 (CK18) along with a decrease in the functional activity of gap junctions and the down-regulation of 2 gap junction proteins, connexin 43 (Cx43) and connexin 45 (Cx45), which is coincidental with substantial elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. These findings reveal a set of cellular changes that may represent the earliest markers of in vitro hESC transition to an epithelial phenotype, before the induction of gene expression networks that guide hESC differentiation. Moreover, we hypothesize that these events may be common during the primary steps of hESC commitment to functionally varied epithelial tissue derivatives of different embryological origins.\n\nA Model of Early Human Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation Reveals Inter- and Intracellular Changes on Transition to Squamous Epithelium\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMalchenko, Sergey; Galat, Yekaterina; Ishkin, Alex; Nikolsky, Yuri; Kosak, Steven T.; Soares, Bento Marcelo; Iannaccone, Philip; Crispino, John D.; Hendrix, Mary J.C.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe molecular events leading to human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation are the subject of considerable scrutiny.

Epithelial cells express type I-type II keratin pairs, and K7, K8 (type II) and K18, K19 and K20 (type I) are the primary keratins found in the single-layered intestinal epithelium. Keratins are upregulated during stress in liver, pancreas, lung, kidney and skin, however, little is known about their dynamics in the intestinal stress response. Here, keratin mRNA, protein and phosphorylation levels were studied in response to murine colonic stresses modeling human conditions, and in colorectal cancer HT29 cells. Dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-colitis was used as a model for intestinal inflammatory stress, which elicited a strong upregulation and widened crypt distribution of K7 and K20. K8 levels were slightly downregulated in acute DSS, while stress-responsive K8 serine-74 phosphorylation (K8 pS74) was increased. By eliminating colonic microflora using antibiotics, K8 pS74 in proliferating cells was significantly increased, together with an upregulation of K8 and K19. In the aging mouse colon, most colonic keratins were upregulated. In vitro, K8, K19 and K8 pS74 levels were increased in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in HT29 cells. In conclusion, intestinal keratins are differentially and dynamically upregulated and post-translationally modified during stress and recovery.

This new technique uses monoclonal antibody as a primary antibody and it takes about three hours for staining. The time is much shorter than conventional absorption-elution testing or absorption-inhibition testing for the determination of ABO blood grouping. Secretor saliva samples were stained at strong intensity by the antibody, which corresponded to its blood group and anti-H. On the one hand, nonsecretor saliva samples were stained at strong intensity only by the antibody that corresponded to its blood group, and at weak intensity only by anti-H. Since human oral squamous epithelium antigens were stained specifically by this method, we can examine the ABO blood group of saliva samples and perform cytodiagnosis at the same time. Our research suggested that the EnVision+ Method is a useful technique for ABO blood grouping of saliva in forensic cases.\n\nDistribution and ultrastructural characteristics of dark cells in squamous metaplasias of the respiratory tract epithelium.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKlein-Szanto, A. J.; Nettesheim, P.; Pine, A.; Martin, D.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nDark epithelial basal cells were found in both carcinogen-induced and non-carcinogen-induced squamous metaplasias of the tracheal epithelium. Formaldehyde-induced squamous metaplasias exhibited 4% dark cells in the basal layer. Metaplasias induced by vitamin A deficiency and those induced by dimethylbenz(alpha)anthracene (DMBA) without atypia showed 18--20% basal dark cells. DMBA-induced metaplasias with moderate to severe atypia exhibited 50% basal dark cells. The labeling index of basal cells in metaplastic epithelia, regardless of the inducing agent, was 16--18%, ie, the same as that of the normal esophageal stratified squamous epithelium. The percentage of labeled dark basal cells per total dark cell population was approximately 19% in the non-carcinogen-induced metaplasias and in the DMBA-induced metaplasias without atypia. In the atypical metaplasias induced by DMA this percentage increased to 26. On the basis of ultrastructural observations, five types of dark epithelial cells could be distinguished in the metaplastic epithelia: Type I (ovoid or fusiform dark cell with abundant cytoplasmic filaments, desmosomes, and free ribosomes--dark keratinocyte type); Type II (ovoid or spherical small cell with scant cytoplasm with few organelles--basal respiratory type); Type III (irregular or ovoid, few cytoplasmic filaments and organelles and desmosomes, extremely abundant free ribosomes--dedifferentiated type); Type IV (fusiform or ovoid, large mitochondria, prominent ergastoplasm, secretion droplets--mucous cell type); and type V (irregular shape, organelle remnants, vacuoles, pyknotic nuclei--involutional-cell type). Type I was the predominant cell type in formaldehyde-induced metaplasias and was also commonly seen in DMBA-induced metaplasias without atypia. Type II predominated in metaplasias induced by vitamin A deficiency. Type III was seen in DMBA-induced metaplasias and was the predominant cell type in the atypical epithelial alterations.

The adoption of the intestine for respiratory function needs certain special modifications. In this study, we explored immunohistochemical and metabolic fingerprint features that could underlay this adaptation in bronze corydoras Corydoras aeneus. Immunohistochemical localization of the cytoplasmic domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the respiratory part of intestine demonstrated a strong positive immunoreaction in epithelial cells and connective tissue. Fourier Transfer Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics discriminated between anterior and posterior region of intestine in terms of secondary structure of proteins and the abundance of p-cresol and other phenolics. The latter were reduced in the posterior part of intestine, indicating the cessation of digestive function in this region. It has been suggested that aquatic hypoxia via endocrine cells (hypoxia-sensitive) activate EGFR, which induce proliferation of squamous epithelial cells, thereby enabling gas diffusion in the posterior part of intestine. It seems that hypoxia and normoxia are opposed conditions adjusting the production of squamous epithelial cells in this intestine. The physiological role of EGFR in the respiratory intestine of bronze corydoras is of interest not only from an evolutionary aspect but also in terms of a potential model for observations process proliferation squamous epithelial cells. Future investigations on the molecular responses to different water oxygen levels in air-breathing bronze corydoras fish are required to clarify the mechanism responsible for squamous cell proliferation.

However, there is no agreement about the epithelium of the anal canal, the anal transitional zone (ATZ) epithelium in particular. The aim of this study is to clarify the structure of the epithelium of the human lower rectum and anal canal. Intact rectum and anus obtained from patients who underwent surgery for rectal carcinoma were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy (LM and SEM). By LM, three types of epithelium were observed in the anal canal: simple columnar epithelium, stratified squamous epithelium, and stratified columnar epithelium. The lower rectum was composed of simple columnar epithelium. SEM findings showed stratified squamous epithelium that consisted of squamous cells with microridges, changing to simple columnar epithelium consisting of columnar cells with short microvilli at the anorectal line. LM and SEM observations in a one-to-one ratio revealed that the area of stratified columnar epithelium based on LM corresponded to the anal crypt and sinus. In conclusion, the epithelium of the human anal canal was fundamentally composed of simple columnar epithelium and stratified squamous epithelium. We found no evidence of the ATZ.\n\nDeregulated HOX genes in ameloblastomas are located in physical contiguity to keratin genes.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchiavo, Giulia; D'AntÃ², Vincenzo; Cantile, Monica; Procino, Alfredo; Di Giovanni, Stefano; Valletta, Rossella; Terracciano, Luigi; Baumhoer, Daniel; Jundt, Gernot; Cillo, Clemente\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThe expression of the HOX gene network in mid-stage human tooth development mostly concerns the epithelial tooth germ compartment and involves the C and D HOX loci. To further dissect the HOX gene implication with tooth epithelium differentiation we compared the expression of the whole HOX network in human ameloblastomas, as paradigm of epithelial odontogenic tumors, with tooth germs. We identified two ameloblastoma molecular types with respectively low and high number of active HOX C genes. The highly expressing HOX C gene ameloblastomas were characterized by a strong keratinized phenotype. Locus C HOX genes are located on chromosome 12q13-15 in physical contiguity with one of the two keratin gene clusters included in the human genome. The most posterior HOX C gene, HOX C13, is capable to interact with hair keratin genes located on the other keratin gene cluster in physical contiguity with the HOX B locus on chromosome 17q21-22. Inside the HOX C locus, a 2.2âkb ncRNA (HOTAIR) able to repress transcription, in cis, along the entire HOX C locus and, in trans, at the posterior region of the HOX D locus has recently been identified. Interestingly both loci are deregulated in ameloblastomas. Our finding support an important role of the HOX network in characterizing the epithelial tooth compartment. Furthermore, the physical contiguity between locus C HOX and keratin genes in normal tooth epithelium and their deregulation in the neoplastic counterparts suggest they may act on the same mechanism potentially involved with epithelial tumorigenesis.

Histologic analysis of human, primate, steer, and rabbit glands revealed evidence of keratinized epithelium extending throughout the meibomian gland duct. Characteristic ultrastructural features of keratinized epithelium identified in primate and rabbit glands included tonofilaments, keratohyaline granules, lamellar bodies, and keratinized squamous cells. Comparison of the meibomian gland duct to the pilosebaceous canal and the sebaceous duct brought out certain dissimilarities such as (1) the lack of a well-developed stratum granulosum and (2) the absence of lipid inclusions within transitional cells from duct to acini. We postulate that abnormalities of the keratinizing process may be responsible for meibomian gland dysfunction states.\n\nImmunolocalization of osteopontin in dysplasias and squamous cell carcinomas arising from oral epithelium.\n\nPubMed\n\nAravind, Thara; Janardhanan, Mahija; Rakesh, S; Savithri, Vindhya; Unnikrishnan, U G\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEarly detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains one of the most efficient ways to ensure patient survival and improved quality of life. Although specific biomarkers related to OSCC have been investigated, a useful biomarker that assesses the transition potential of potentially malignant lesion to OSCC remains to be found. Osteopontin (OPN) has been recognized as an important factor in tumorigenesis and their expression in OSCC have been investigated earlier. In the present study, evaluation of OPN expression in premalignant and malignant lesions has been carried out to assess their possible role as a biomarker in the early diagnosis and prognosis of OSCC. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of OPN as a biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of OSCC. The study group consisted of archival paraffin-embedded blocks of ten cases each of varying grades of OSCC, oral epithelial dysplasias and epithelial hyperplasias. Sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for the biomarker OPN. A positive OPN expression was noticed in epithelial dysplasias and SCC arising from the oral epithelium. A progressive increase in the intensity of staining was seen with increasing grades of dysplasias and a decrease in OPN expression with an increase in grades was observed in OSCC. The expression of OPN in full thickness of epithelium in severe dysplasias, carcinoma in situ, and in the superficial epithelium of OSCC suggest the possibility of considering OPN expression in full epithelial thickness in dysplasias as an indicator for malignant transformation.\n\nA STUDY OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE CORNIFIED EPITHELIUM OF HUMAN SKIN\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMatoltsy, A. Gedeon; Balsamo, Constance A.\n\n1955-01-01\n\nPulverized cornified epithelium of human skin was divided into a \"soluble fraction\" and a \"residue.\" About half of the \"soluble fraction\" proved to be soluble epidermal keratin (keratin A); the remainder, dialyzable substances of low molecular weight. The \"residue\" contained epidermal keratin and resistant cell membranes of cornified cells. Epidermal keratin was found to form an oriented and dense submicroscopic structure in the cornified cells. It showed high resistance toward strong acid and moderately strong alkali solutions as well as concentrated urea. In strong alkali, reducing substances, alkaline urea, and mixtures of reducing substance with alkali, epidermal keratin dissociated and yielded a non-dialyzable derivative of high molecular weight (keratin B) which resembled true proteins. The cell membranes of cornified cells showed higher resistance toward strong alkali and reducing substance than did epidermal keratin.

A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis laboratory has shown that a human urothelial cell line (UROtsa) transformed by cadmium (Cd+2) produced subcutaneous tumor heterotransplants that resemble human transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). In the present study, additional Cd+2 transformed cell lines were isolated to determine if independent exposures of the cell line to Cd+2 would result in malignantly transformed cell lines possessing similar phenotypic properties. Seven independent isolates were isolated and assessed for their doubling times, morphology, ability to heterotransplant subcutaneously and in the peritoneal cavity of nude mice and for the expression keratin 7. The 7 cell lines all displayed an epithelial morphology with no evidence of squamous differentiation. Doubling times were variable among the isolates, being significantly reduced or similar to the parental cells. All 7 isolates were able to form subcutaneous tumor heterotransplants with a TCC morphology and all heterotransplants displayed areas of squamous differentiation of the transitional cells. The degree of squamous differentiation varied among the isolates. In contrast to subcutaneous tumor formation, only 1 isolate of the Cd+2 transformed cells (UTCd#1) was able to effectively colonize multiple sites within the peritoneal cavity. An analysis of keratin 7 expression showed no correlation with squamous differentiation for the subcutaneous heterotransplants generated from the 7 cell lines. Keratin 7 was expressed in 6 of the 7 cell lines and their subcutaneous tumor heterotransplants. Keratin 7 was not expressed in the cell line that was able to form tumors within the peritoneal cavity. These results show that individual isolates of Cd+2 transformed cells have both similarities and differences in their phenotype.

In an effort to better understand these tumors we studied microRNA (miRNA) expression in tumor epithelium of never tobacco users, tumor epithelium of ever tobacco users, and nonpathological control oral epithelium. A comparison of levels among 372 miRNAs in 12 never tobacco users with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) versus 10 healthy controls was made using the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A similar analysis was done with 8 ever tobacco users with OSCC. These comparisons revealed miR-10b-5p, miR-196a-5p, and miR-31-5p as enriched in the tumor epithelium in OSCC of both never and ever tobacco users. Examination of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project miRNA data on 305 OSCCs and 30 controls revealed 100% of those miRNAs enriched in never smoker OSCCs in this patient group were also enriched in ever smoker OSCCs. Nonsupervised clustering of TCGA OSCCs was suggestive of two or four subgroups of tumors based on miRNA levels with limited evidence for differences in tobacco exposure among the groups. Results from both patient groups together stress the importance of miR196a-5p in OSCC malignancy in both never and ever smokers, and emphasize the overall similarity of miRNA expression in OSCCs in these two risk groups. It implies that there may be great similarity in etiology of OSCC in never and ever smokers and that classifying OSCC based on tobacco exposure may not be helpful in the clinic.

Nevertheless, the prevalence of HPV seems to be variable in different regions and ethnic groups. There are no reports of HPV in tonsillar carcinomas in Guatemala, and data from Brazil are scarce. The aim of this study is to analyze and compare HPV presence in samples of tonsillar SCC from these countries. This study describes the histologic features, expression of p16 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HPV by in situ hybridization (ISH) in 13 Guatemalan and 13 Brazilian patients. All cases of tonsillar SCC from Guatemala were positive for p16, 92% expressed HPV by ISH, and 75% corresponded to the high-risk genotype 16/18. From the Brazilian patients, only four expressed p16, and all were negative for HPV. Cases from Guatemala, which were mostly nonkeratinizing SCC and originated from the crypt/reticular epithelium of the tonsil, had high-risk integrated HPV, whereas in Brazilian cases, which were mostly keratinizing SCC that originated from the surface epithelium, there was no association with HPV.

An immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nFetissof, F; Arbeille, B; Boivin, F; Sam-Giao, M; Henrion, C; Lansac, J\n\n1987-01-01\n\nA systematic study of endocrine cells in the ectocervix was carried out using histochemical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Serotonin and calcitonin immunoreactive cells were demonstrated in this site. Serotonin and calcitonin immunoreactivities were coexpressed in the same endocrine cell. These distinctive cells were encountered in two main morphological varieties of ectocervical epithelium. Normal-appearing stratified squamous epithelium contained only very rare serotonin and calcitonin cells. In contrast, endocrine cells were fairly abundant in a specific epithelium termed \"transitional-like\". This type of epithelium was not only confined to the transformation zone but could also extend onto the portio as far as the vaginal cut margin. In some cases, transitional-like epithelium bore morphological resemblance to urothelium. In other cases, it could be regarded as basal cell hyperplasia or immature squamous metaplasia. Of interest, serotonin and calcitonin cells have been well-documented as normal inhabitants of some other non-squamous epithelia, such as urothelium or pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Therefore, it is suggested that certain ectocervical epithelia show some similarities to urothelium, in respect of their morphological appearance and endocrine profile. Further investigations using more objective and specific markers of urothelial cells are needed to assess the exact degree of homology connecting all these types of epithelium.\n\nImmunolocalization of osteopontin in dysplasias and squamous cell carcinomas arising from oral epithelium\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAravind, Thara; Janardhanan, Mahija; Rakesh, S; Savithri, Vindhya; Unnikrishnan, U G\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: Early detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains one of the most efficient ways to ensure patient survival and improved quality of life.

In the current study, the cases of two patients who were diagnosed with SqCC originated from skin and the breast were discussed. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy confirmed the presence of atypical squamous cells. In both cases, the microscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a malignant neoplasm differentiated into SqCC characterized by keratinizing cancer cells with abundant eosiphilic cytoplasm with large, hyperchromatic vesicular nuclei. Immunohistochemical studies showed negative for progesterone and estrogen receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Moreover, negative expression of cytokeratin 7 and 20 was confirmed. The diagnosis of the both tumors was established based on the detailed analysis of clinical, macroscopical and microscopical information. SqCC localized in the breast is a great diagnostic challenge in pathomorphology and more attention should be paid for analysis of such lesions in daily practice.

The great majority of oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas are microscopically described as kerartinizing squamous cell carcinoma (KSCC). They bear certain resemblance to keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium. Tobacco habits and excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages have been considered to be the main etiologic agents in these carcinomas. The tumors occurred in older patients more commonly affected the oral tongue and floor of the mouth with well established morphologic risk factors including tumor grade, pattern of invasion and perineural involvement. Within the last 30 years however, the advent and expanding prevalence of high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) as an important etiologic agent for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in the OP, has resulted in "
