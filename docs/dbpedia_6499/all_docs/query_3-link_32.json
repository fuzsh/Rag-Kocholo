        "text": "Use the following slides to practice identifying epithelium. Don’t worry about identify organs and major structures, just work on distinguishing the different types of epithelium discussed above.\n\nIn this slide we see a typical neurovascular bundle you may find anywhere in the body. Nerves, veins, and arteries often run together surrounded by connective tissue. For now, we will focus on looking at epithelium lining blood vessels. Endothelium is the term used to describe epithelium lining blood vessels and the heart. Endothelium is made up of simple squamous epithelium. The basement membrane can be difficult to see or not be seen at all in many light microcopy images with a typical hematoxylin and eosin stain as shown above. Hematoxylin stains nucleic acids blue/purple and eosin stains the cytoplasm a pinkish color. The bright red cells seen in the center of the vein and artery without nuclei are red blood cells.\n\nOnce you click on the specimen slide, it will guide you through different areas of the slide of importance. As you explore the slide, you’ll notice other tissue types such as connective tissue, adipose tissue, nerve fibers, and smooth muscle surrounding the endothelium. For now, just focus on looking for simple squamous epithelium.\n\nThis slide contains a coronal section of an infant kidney. The outer, curved region is the natural anatomical surface. Blood travels through the kidney to the cortex region where it begins the filtration process. You will find simple squamous epithelium lining any blood vessels and simple cuboidal epithelium lining the surrounding ducts. If you look closely at the cuboidal cells, their apical surface may have a fuzzy appearance indicating microvilli, also known as the brush border. The brush border is used to increase surface area of these cells for transport of molecules as urine is being concentrated. As you move towards the center, or medulla, you will notice tubules in longitudinal and crossection. Here, you will see more simple cuboidal epithelium and some tubules lined by simple squamous epithelium indicating the thick and thin limbs of the loops of Henle. Capillaries can also be seen carrying red blood cells and lined by endothelium. Don’t worry about identifying different structures of the kidney, just focus on identifying epithelium.\n\nThis slide contains a partial section of the gallbladder. A complete section would be closed off, like a circle. Notice the lumen of the gallbladder. You should look for the simple columnar epithelium lining the lumen. You can also scroll through other parts of the slide and find more endothelium lining blood vessels. You may also see some simple squamous epithelium on the very edge of the gall bladder, this is a mesothelial layer from visceral peritoneum which partially covers the gall bladder.\n\nThe next section contains slides with more types of epithelium and also glands to identify.\n\nThis slide contains a crossection of part of the small intestines (duodenum) and the pancreas. Use this slide to observe the simple columnar epithelium lining the lumen of the duodenum. You will see a mixture of tall columnar absorptive cells with microvilli interspersed with lighter, staining cells- goblet cells which produce mucous. The invaginating structures of tissue you see that project into the lumen are known as villi. Just deep to the villi are Brunner glands, coiled tubular glands that secrete bicarbonate and mucous. When you view the pancreas, you will find compound tubuloalveolar glands. Notice the alveoli are made up of serous cells which secrete digestive enzymes.\n\nThis slide contains 2 sections of trachea, one has been flattened out while the other maintains the natural c-shape. The trachea is a tube that runs through the neck and thorax for movement of air. Examples of hyaline cartilage can be identified which provide flexibility while maintaining an open airway. You should focus on the luminal surfaces of the trachea sections to observe the pseudostratified, ciliated, columnar epithelium with goblet cells. Think back to the definition of pseudostratified- all cells’ basal surface are resting on the basement membrane but not all cells reach the apical surface. The shorter, darkly-stained cells are basal cells which undergo mitosis to replace the epithelial cell population. The cilia seen on the taller cells are motile cilia (9 + 2 microtubule arrangement) and move mucous through the airway. Goblet cells are lighter stained and appear in a goblet shape. The trachea also has compound tubuloalveolar glands that are serous and mucous (mixed glands) found between the epithelium and cartilage layers.\n\nThe epiglottis is tissue made up of cartilage, connective tissue (CT), epithelium, and glands. It covers the opening of the trachea (airway) when swallowing to prevent food and fluid from entering the respiratory system. Use this slide to identify the surface epithelium, in some places it is not fully in tact. You can also find vessels, glands and ducts."
