        "text": "INDUCTIVE MATRIX FOR FUNCTIONAL OCULAR SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION\n\nDescription\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nNot Applicable\n\nSTATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT\n\nNot Applicable\n\nTHE NAMES OF THE PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT\n\nNot Applicable\n\nREFERENCE TO A âSEQUENCE LISTING\n\nNot Applicable\n\nSTATEMENT REGARDING PRIOR DISCLOSURES BY THE INVENTOR OR A JOINT INVENTOR\n\nNot Applicable\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention relates to the method of using materials as a transplant on the ocular surface and to restructuring and absorbable materials for such use.\n\nBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe ocular surface is an extremely sensitive and dynamic structure, the health of which is crucial for the optimal functioning of the eye.\n\nAny mechanical, chemical, or endogenous factor aggression possibly results in structural-functional dysfunction.\n\nThe understanding of the problem gave way to the exhaustive review of the literature and patents to determine the advances and limitations, to propose other approaches and provide new solutions, being necessary to start with relevant aspects of the structures (anatomical and histological), the functions and interrelationships superficial and deep structures of the eye, listed and summarized below. In the detailed examination of the ocular structures, Gipson IK (2007) specifies that the \"Ocular surface system\" is constituted by the surface and the glandular epithelium of the cornea, the conjunctiva, the lacrimal gland, the accessory lacrimal glands, and the gland of Meibomian, and its apical (tears) and basal (connective tissue) matrices.\n\nThe academic explains that in this system, all the components are functionally linked by the continuity of the epithelia, by innervation and by the endocrine, vascular and immune systems.\n\nThe researcher also highlights the importance of the tear film (multilayer fluid) that lubricates and keeps the ocular surface moist, nourishes and protects it from microbial infections.\n\nSaid author highlights that lipid make up one of the layers of said film, originated in the Meibomian glands, and that the aqueous fraction of another of the layers is produced by the lacrimal gland (with residual amounts derived from the conjunctival epithelium) and a glycocalyx basal composed of mucins.\n\nThis researcher highlights that the superficial lipid layer limits undesirable losses caused by evaporation, which ensures a uniform surface that minimizes scattering and allows precise refraction of light. [1]\n\nConjunctiva\n\nStudies on the structure and function of the conjunctiva, formed by the epithelium and the stroma (substantia propria) by Weisenthal RW, et al (2013) when specifying the locations of the conjunctival epithelium, describe three different locations: palpebral, bulbar and forniceal, with sparse cell layers thick.\n\nThey mention that this epithelium, according to the location described, consists of different types of cells: stratified cuboidal cells are found on the tarsus, columnar cells are found in the fornices, and squamous cells are found in the bulbar conjunctiva.\n\nRegarding the stroma, they point out that it is composed of loose, vascularized connective tissue, rich in elastic fibers, and a significant number of lymphocytes, which actively participate in the immune response of the ocular surface. [2]\n\nReferring to the structure and functionality of the conjunctival epithelium, the group of Fernandez, A., (2008) indicates that the corneal and conjunctival epithelia are continuous and make up the ocular surface, both made up of a keratinized non-stratified squamous epithelium, with the difference of that the conjunctival epithelium has mucin-secreting goblet cells interspersed with epithelial cells, which maintain the lacrimal layer of the ocular surface. [3]\n\nIn Copeland R.A. and Afshari N.A. (2013) describe the distribution, properties, morphology, and composition of the conjunctiva, which covers the ocular surface from the limbus to the mucocutaneous junction.\n\nIn the distribution they point out that the part that covers the sclera is known as the bulbar conjunctiva, while the palpebral conjunctiva covers the posterior surface of the eyelids.\n\nIn their composition, they report that the superficial layer of the conjunctiva is composed of nonkeratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with numerous goblet cells, columnar in the forniceal part and cuboidal in the area attached to the tarsus, where the epithelial cells are packed in two to five layers.\n\nConcerning morphology, these authors report that the number of layers of conjunctival epithelial cells changes, with the presence of six to nine layers of stratified squamous epithelium in the bulbar conjunctiva.\n\nRegarding the conjunctival stroma (substantia propria), they define it as a thin and vascularized layer that encloses scattered lacrimal glands (depending on the anatomical location), lymphatics, plasma cells, macrophages, and mast cells. [4]\n\nRegarding conjunctival epithelial tissues, studies by Rosellini A, et. al., (2007) point out that conjunctival stem cells can differentiate into mucin-producing goblet cells or epithelial cells and suggest that these arise from the fornical niche (cul-de-sac), whose presence is essential for the renewal of the conjunctival epithelium. [5]\n\nThe group of Tsai (2015) also highlights that the conjunctival epithelium continues with the cornea in the limbus, and that this site is the main corneal stem cell niche for the regeneration of epithelial cells. [6]\n\nThe properties of the conjunctiva were reviewed by the Qi H group, (2010), who highlight that its wide vascularization allows the correct flow of nutrients and liquids and point out the difficulty of specifying the source of conjunctival stem cells. These authors acknowledge that these stem cells reside in the fornical niche (cul-de-sac) and that they can differentiate into mucin-producing goblet cells or epithelial cells, evidenced in clonal culture assays. [7]\n\nCornea\n\nA detailed examination of the histological composition of the ocular surface by Sangwan, V.S. (2001) refer to the fact that the cornea, the conjunctiva, and the intermediate area, known as the limbus, are covered by a stratified, squamous non-keratinized epithelium.\n\nThe author mentions that this epithelium sits on a basement membrane and is connected to the underlying connective tissue (stroma), whose structure houses cells and allows the transit of fluids and nutrients, useful for the maintenance of the matrix and the overlying epithelium.\n\nThe author points out that the origin and proliferation of the corneal epithelium can occur in two different ways: a), derived from the adjacent conjunctiva by trans conjunctival differentiation, or b). It comes from the corneal stem cells of the basal epithelium of the limbus.\n\nThese \"stem cells\" are defined by this researcher, as any cell with a high capacity for self -renewal that extends throughout the adult life of the organism.\n\nRegarding this last situation, the author emphasizes that as the corneal stem cells originate in the limbus, any damage at this level leads to a lack of these cells, which leads to the\n\n\" conjunct! valization\" of the cornea with vascularization, the appearance of goblet cells and an irregular and unstable epithelium. [8]\n\nRamos, T., and collaborators expand some data in relation to the epithelium of the ocular surface, indicating that the cornea and sclera are covered by stratified, non-keratinized corneal and conjunctival epithelia.\n\nThey also mention that the corneal epithelium has 5-7 layers of cells, while the conjunctival epithelium has 3-5 layers of cells, and that both form the front surface of the eye (the ocular surface).\n\nThese authors highlight that the corneal epithelium centrally and the conjunctival epithelium that surrounds it, are conserved by different populations of stem cells (stem cells of the limbus for the corneal epithelium and stem cells of the conjunctival epithelium). [9] Ziaei M et al. (2018) point out the importance of the renewal of the corneal epithelium, in the continuous maintenance of function as a barrier against external environments and various aggressions.\n\nThey mention that, after trauma, exposure to toxic agents, mechanical injuries, and infections, in addition to damage to the corneal epithelium, the lesions can reach to the stroma, and in both cases the healing cascade is activated to minimize the risk infection, opacification or perforation. [10]\n\nStudies on the management of epithelial defects caused by chemical burns by Soleimani, M. and Naderan, M. (2020), highlight the important role of intact epithelium in preserving the stability of the stroma, by preventing enzymes from digesting it, which accelerates the reconstruction of the ocular surface. [11]\n\nThe studies of the Hancox group (2020) on the corneal epithelium layer reveal several interesting data such as: conformation by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, with about 5-7 layers of cells, which represents around 10% of the total corneal density.\n\nThey also emphasize that this epithelial layer includes the tear film, surface cells, wing cells, basal cells, and basement membrane cells, which is in the lower part of this epithelial layer.\n\nThis group highlights that the main function of the epithelium layer is to allow the uniform distribution of moisture to the surface of the cornea through cooperation with the tear film and the smoothness of its surface.\n\nThey attribute to the collagen lamellae and the extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by keratocytes, the maintenance of the contour and transparency of the cornea.\n\nBy specifying collagen fibers, they refer that their thin fibrils form a lamellae structure of the same size and oriented parallel to each other, which gives the cornea its shape and birefractive property. [12]\n\nExtensive research on the corneal stroma by Chen, S., et al., (2015), reveal that the main cells that inhabit it are keratocytes, responsible for the synthesis and secretion of the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the stroma, including collagen fibrils (regulated by keratocytes) whose optimal organization provides transparency and supports the necessary structure for the refraction of light. An important conclusion from these researchers refers to the fact that the finely controlled assembly of the extracellular matrix of the stroma is essential for the function and mechanical stability required to maintain the shape and curvature of the cornea. [13]\n\nStudies by Hao Y et al. (2000) mention that the stroma (connective tissue) produces multiple growth factors that determine the proliferation and maintenance of corneal stem cells and inhibit the production of fibrotic tissue by local fibroblasts. [14]\n\nIn relation to the cornea, investigations have focused on the surrounding limbal and conjunctival regions, due to their functioning as supporting tissues for it.\n\nInitial studies by Rosellini A, et. al., (2007) make special reference to the fact that the limbus of the cornea (between the corneal and conjunctival epithelium), and its limbal stem cells (LSC) are essential in the maintenance and repair of the corneal epithelial tissue.\n\nCorneal tissues are affected by the responses of inflammatory cells, the arrival of which causes the formation of scars and the destruction of the limbus area, and these authors synthesize that the main factors that threaten corneal clarity are inflammatory reactions, neovascularization, and the deficiencies of limbo.\n\nThe studies reviewed by this group, highlight that they were more focused on the characteristics of the cornea, such as the immune response, angiogenesis and cell signaling. [15]\n\nIn relation to the limbal epithelium, two groups of authors are cited, who offer a broad perspective of its constitution and function, such as Kolli, et al., (2014) and Tsai, et al., (2015), who point out its peculiar characteristics, among them that they provide the separation of the conjunctival and corneal epithelium, with a narrow border between them, highlighting that the corneal stem cells (LSC) reside in said limbal epithelium.\n\nThey describe that the limbic epithelium acts as a barrier between the centrally clear avascular cornea and the peripherally opaque vascularized conjunctiva.\n\nBoth groups state that these limbal stem cells are essential for the maintenance of the adult cornea and determining factors in the repair and regeneration of damaged corneal epithelial tissue. [16] [17]\n\nWith the intraocular application of certain products, it is intended that the healing is complete with stable epithelium, minimal scarring, and prevent coverage of the cornea by conjunctival epithelium, and neovascularization. According to De Pascalis, C., & Etienne-Manneville, S., the chemical and physical properties of the environment control proliferation, or cell differentiation, and in three-dimensional environments, cells must rapidly adapt to the physical properties of their environment.\n\nIn addition, they point out that in such a microenvironment, when a cell is related to a permissive surface, be it a substrate or another cell, it will form adhesive structures that allow it to respond to the properties of its environment.\n\nThis same group notes that cells detect two types of information: chemical signals (small molecules and soluble factors), and physical properties (stiffness of the substrate, topology, porosity, elastic behavior, or compression and traction forces).\n\nThey state that the stiffness of the substrate substantially controls the mechanical responses of the cells.\n\nResearch by the same group mentions that cells detect signals from the environment, to respond with immediate responses that generate cytoskeletal rearrangements and changes in cell shape and motility.\n\nThis reciprocal relationship between the cell and the physical property of the environment is crucial during cell propagation, migration, and adhesion. [18]\n\nOutstanding studies for educational purposes of the Ocular Surface Center Berlin (OSCB), highlight the importance of the following anatomical, histological, and reparative aspects of the ocular surface:\n\n1. âThe Conjunctiva of the eyeball is located on the outside of the sclera, and it is continuous with the moist epithelium of the Corneal connective tissue, termed as the 'Stroma'.\n\n2. The sclera makes up most of the wall of the eyeball, made up of thick connective tissue, stronger than similar corneal stroma.\n\n3. The thickness of the sclera is roughly around 1 millimeter, but it varies in different regions. It has 0,8mm thickness at the front before it transforms into the cornea.\n\n4. The building material is the protein 'Collagen', composed of bundles of collagen fibers, that have a different arrangement. The main producers of collagens are connective tissue cells called fibrocytes, or fibroblasts, which at the corneal level are recognized as \"keratocytes\". 5. The cornea is made of a protein called keratin.\n\n6. The corneal epithelium is constantly replaced and renewed, starting from epithelial stem cells located in the corneal periphery in the limbus, located in the so-called palisades of Vogt, where the epithelial rete pegs are immersed deep between the papillae of the stromal connective tissue, arranged in a radial pattern.\n\n7. The corneal stroma is composed of collagen fibrils produced by stromal keratocytes.\n\n8. The peripheral region of the cornea (limbus) preserves corneal integrity and transparency for visual function.\n\n9. A destruction of the corneal epithelial stem cells for any reason can disturb the visual function severely.\n\n10. The stem cell niche of the corneal limbus induces the continuous regeneration of the corneal epithelium, and the deficiency of these cells facilitates the excessive growth of the conjunctival epithelium on the cornea (conjunctivalization), which causes the loss of transparency and visual acuity.\n\n11. The Cornea and Sclera are continuous but differ in internal structural conformation.\n\n12. The transparency of the cornea is a direct effect of the highly ordered regular arrangement of the collagen fiber bundles and the low water content.\n\n13. In the sclera, the dense collagen structure causes stiffness and it has a higher water content.â [19]\n\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is fundamental in the understanding of ocular stromal structures, due to important actions that are highlighted below: first: its presence reduces the time of stromal restructuring and second due to newly discovered implications of immunological actions that can be aroused in the host.\n\nInvestigation of the composition and function of ECM in various tissues and imitation and construction of biological scaffolds with high biomimetic properties, have been important areas extensively studied for their influence on cell behavior, including adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, migration, and functional expression. Structures and soluble signals of ECM play a vital role in cell determination, differentiation, proliferation, survival, polarity, and migration, and it is important to address first some related concepts that need to be kept separate in thinking about and analyzing the functions of ECM as localized, multivalent cellular and signal integrators.\n\nA summary of the reports in the literature, which have focused on the extracellular matrix ECM, is made:\n\nBissell MJ, & Hall HG, Parry G (1982) provide an in-depth analysis about the structural and functional combination of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in which they highlight that its ultrastructure is made up of a diverse mixture of proteins, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans, among other molecules.\n\nRegarding the functional aspect, they point out that the (ECM) interacts in dynamic reciprocity with the cellâs resident in the cellular microenvironment and is subject to metabolic changes linked to mechanical properties, pH, oxygen concentration and other variables. [20]\n\nIngber D. (1991): ECM should be understood as a substrate that constantly changes in \"dynamic reciprocity\" with tissues, whose structural-functional support favors cell growth and signaling. [21]\n\nAlberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, (2002) have described that tissues are made up of cells and a network of macromolecules that constitute the extracellular matrix, composed of a variety of proteins and polysaccharides (locally secreted) and built in a mesh organized in connection with the surface of the cell that produced them, highlighting the active role of this structure, which influences the development, survival, migration, proliferation, shape and function of the cells that come into contact with it.\n\nThey also state that there are other proteins other than collagen in this structure, which have specific binding sites for various macromolecules of the matrix and for receptors on the surface of cells. [22]\n\nStudies by Li L, Xie T. (2005) on the organization of the ECM refer to the fact that cells can be immobilized and anchored to the matrix and highlight that this last event is essential for epithelial cells, including adult stem cells, to maintain polarity, organization, and function of tissues. [23]\n\nIn reference to the extracellular matrix (ECM), in the works of Chan, B. P., & Leong, K. W. (2008), five functions are attributed to this structure: Firstly, provides structural support and physical environment for cells residing in that tissue to attach, grow, migrate, and respond to signals. Secondly, gives the tissue its structural and mechanical properties, such as firmness and elasticity that is associated with the tissue functions. Thirdly, provide bioactive cues to the residing cells for regulation of their activities. Fourthly, may act as reservoir of growth factors and potentiate their bioactivities. Fifthly, provides a degradable physical environment to allow neovascularization and remodeling in response to developmental, physiological, and pathological challenges. [24]\n\nDaley WP, et. al., (2008) when reviewing the dynamics of the extracellular matrix, suggest that it is composed of biochemically and structurally diverse components.\n\nBiochemically, these components are divided into proteins, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins, with various individual physical and biochemical properties.\n\nThey also refer that, at the microenvironment level, cell-cell or cell-substrate contact will form adhesive structures that will allow it to respond to the properties of that environment.\n\nThese authors, when analyzing the physical properties of the ECM in cell behavior, pointed out that stiffness, porosity, insolubility, and topography are essential for the structure and integrity of tissues, and in cell migration and anchorage. [25]\n\nSeveral studies, carried out by Hynes RO, (2009) indicate that the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the environment that surrounds it, influence the function and modulation of various aspects of cell biology. [26]\n\nStudies conducted and published by Reilly GC, Engler AJ. (2010) About the extracellular matrix (ECM) denote the important role of this conformation in cell behavior and tissue function, which can vary due to its biomechanical properties, such as elasticity, from soft, docile, and rigid. [27]\n\nVotteler M, et al. (2010): the ECM acts as a deposit of structural and functional proteins, which when degraded releases \"hidden\" bioactive peptides, and serves as a niche for soluble factors and macromolecules, which allow the differentiation of stem cells and guide cell fate. [28]\n\nAn important contribution by Egeblad M, and collaborators (2010) highlighting that the orientation of the collagen fibers present in the ECM can lead in an outstanding way the migration of the cells, possibly by enhancing the growth factor receptor signaling or by mechanically enhancing cell migration. [29]\n\nLu, P., and collaborators (2011) emphasize that cell-ECM interactions are reciprocal. Thus, the change in the composition and topography of the ECM is produced by the actions of the cells that create, disrupt, reorganize, and realign the components of this structure.\n\nThey further recognized that any change in the dynamics of the ECM due to cellular activities will in turn influence adjacent cells and change their behaviors.\n\nIn abnormal ECM, involvement of the local microenvironment and activities of stromal, endothelial, and immune cells has been observed.\n\nThese authors highlight in their conclusions, that the components of the ECM are functionally diverse, with a wide range of cellular activities, and at the same time dynamic due to the constant remodeling processes in which one or more of its essential properties are modified.\n\nThey further affirm that due to cell-ECM interactions, modulation of these dynamics is an effective measure for cells to respond to environmental changes, adapt their behaviors, and maintain tissue integrity and function.\n\nThese authors refer that the properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as rigidity, porosity, insolubility and topography, determine the behavior of the cells that reside inside it, and its performance as a mechanical support favors association with the basement membrane. [30]\n\nLu P, et al. (2011): The dual ability of the ECM to modulate cellular activity while simultaneously remodeling itself during development and morphogenesis of tissues. [31]\n\nHynes RO, Naba A. (2012): ECM is a set of structural and functional components that include collagens, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, mucins, elastic fibers, and growth factors. [32]\n\nBonnans, C., et al., (2014) define that the extracellular matrix is a three-dimensional non-cellular structure present in all tissues, whose composition differs into two main types: the interstitial connective tissue matrix, which surrounds the cells and provides a structural scaffolding, and the basement membrane that separates the epithelium from the surrounding stroma and controls cell organization and differentiation through interactions with cell surface receptors and ECM proteins.\n\nIn turn, they refer to the fact that both structures have different structural proteins, so the interstitial connective tissue matrix is mainly composed of collagen I and fibronectin, and in a more complex and cohesive way the basement membrane composed mainly of collagen IV, laminins, heparan proteoglycans sulfate (HSPG) and proteins, such as nidogen and entactin, that are synthesized and secreted by epithelial and endothelial cells. [33] Brown, B. N. and Badylak, S. F. (2014): ECM is a reservoir of structural and functional proteins that direct cell behavior, phenotype, and survival, and facilitate remodeling by resident cells. [34]\n\nThe studies of Eweida AM, and Marei, (2015) on natural scaffolds for dermal regeneration, refer to the fact that they are formed by a complex mixture of structural and functional proteins, glycoproteins and proteoglycans arranged in a three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructure, and that said bioactive components retained in this structure contribute to tissue regeneration. [35]\n\nBy studies by Kweon et. al (2016) it is known that the ECM is a dynamic 3D structure, and that cells live around it in an ecological environment. [36]\n\nThe De Pascalis group, (2017) refers that the microenvironment of the extracellular matrix is composed of cells and the surrounding intercellular medium, they highlight that beyond providing structural support, it binds to soluble growth factors, which are distributed, activated, and presented to cells in the form of spatially organized and directed multivalent signals.\n\nThese authors reported that cells when migrating use adhesive structures to adapt their mechanical properties, perform movements, and relate to their environment. [37]\n\nStudies on the preparation of scaffolds from cultured cells by Chen G, & Kawazoe N., (2018) explain that the extracellular matrix (ECM) interacts with cells to control their functions and provides important signals that maintain homeostasis in living organisms. [38]\n\nLeong M, et al. (2020): the structure of the ECM stabilizes the tissues and regulates the performance of the cells that contact it, which produce the macromolecular components, including (1) glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or polysaccharide chains and (2) fibrous proteins such as collagen, elastin, fibronectin, and laminin. [39]\n\nTo understand the arrangement and actions of the conjunctival extracellular matrix, and the possible substrates to replace it, Makuloluwa and collaborators (2021) indicate that the ECM is composed of two components: the basement membrane and the interstitial matrix.\n\nRelating to the basement membrane, they explain that it is secreted particularly by epithelial cells that contain laminins and type IV collagens, and in their function, it favors the adhesion and differentiation of epithelial and goblet cells.\n\nRegarding the interstitial matrix, they indicate that it is secreted by fibroblasts in the lamina propria, and its main contribution is related to the mechanical and structural support of the tissues. [40] According to the studies from Rusenko, (13) the basement membrane zone is important for graft adhesion and stability. [41]\n\nFurthmayr cited that adequate and permanent graft take is dependent upon the formation of a complete basement membrane zone. [42]\n\nOn the architecture of the human esophageal epithelium by the studios of Watt FM, Seery JP. (2000), reference is made to the asymmetric divisions of stem cells, that occurs by the action of the basement membrane, which by inducing cell differentiation builds the general architecture of the epithelium, and at the same time, serves as a route for cell migration and functions as a defensive barrier. [43]\n\nThe basement membrane or basal lamina has been highlighted by Yurchenco P. D. (2011) because plays an important role in the morphogenesis of the tissue and the maintenance of function, that controls cell behavior. [44]\n\nImportant contribution about the orientation of cell migration through the substrate, was provided by Doxzen K, and collaborators, (2013) who indicated that cells obtain information from the environment, and from neighboring migratory cells. [45]\n\nIt has been suggested by Causa F, Netti PA, Ambrosio L. (2007) that biomaterial design has focused on creating physical and biochemical environments that guide tissue regeneration and this seems to be a reliable approach to control cellular behavior.\n\nThese authors recognize the deficiencies in the biological recognition of synthetic scaffolds for tissue regeneration, so current attention has focused on the use of natural materials as a source of analogous tissues with multiple functions. [46]\n\nChan, BP and Leong, KW (2008) highlight the difficulty of accurately imitating the extracellular matrix, derived from the multiple and dynamic functions of this structure, so that any substitute partially emulates its functions.\n\nThese same authors, when referring to the integration of scaffolds in the tissues after being implanted, is facilitated by the presence of pores for the transport of nutrients and metabolites, whose efficient vascularization and degradation rapidity coincide with that of the production of new matrix by developing tissue. [47] Freed et al. (1994) proposed that scaffolds should possess a porosity of at least 90% to allow for adequate nutrient diffusion and tissue ingrowth during in vitro culture. [48]\n\nThe studies by Mooney DJ, et. al (1996) highlight the need for scaffolds to have a geometry of open pores and perfectly interconnected, which facilitate the exchange of nutrients and waste between cells and their environment. [49]\n\nThe key characteristics of the ideal scaffold proposed by Negut, I., et.al. (2010) are essentially the same as those used by Chan, BP and Leong, KW (2008), who state that they must possess: adequate physical and mechanical properties, to allow cell adhesion, proliferation and / or differentiation, with interconnected pores that allow the formation of blood vessels, accelerate the formation of granulation tissue and subsequent re-epithelialization.\n\nThey also emphasize that the framework should preferably be biocompatible and biodegradable, with a degradation profile that is concomitant with the wound healing period. [50]\n\nIn a study carried out by Q.-M. Jin, H. Takita, T. Kohgo et al., (2000) reported the importance of pores in implants, whose presence plays a critical role in the effectiveness of their mechanical properties, and especially in their biological performance, such as cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation, and the transport of nutrients and metabolic wastes. [51]\n\nThe studies by Zeltinger J, et al. (2001) report that in scaffolds, apart from the presence and interconnectivity of the pores, their size is a determining factor in adhesion, cell proliferation and matrix deposition, and they point out that the width of these pores can affect cell infiltration and proliferation, due to their preferences at a certain size, and proposed that scaffolds with pores of less than 38 pm be used to grow the epithelial coating in vitro. [52]\n\nStudies carried out by Vassilis K, and David K. (2005) on the effects of porosity in the osteogenesis of 3D biomaterial scaffolds, make them conclude that these must be highly porous, to optimize the space that allows cell adhesion and migration. [53]\n\nThe presence of pores is a critical part of scaffolding and Salerno A and collaborators (2012) explain that open and interconnected porous networks are essential for nutrition, cell proliferation-migration, and vascularization by making use of the surrounding tissue to improve the mechanical stability of the implant. In addition, these authors indicate that the network structure of the pores helps guide and promote the formation of new tissues. [54]\n\nTan's group (2012) recommends that the pores should be large and interconnected to facilitate cellular infiltration, ECM deposition, and vascularization in the interior regions of the scaffold. [55]\n\nDiscusses the challenges and strategies for facilitating and promoting tissue repair, Bruzauskaite, I., et. al. (2016). defined in a few words, the facilitation of these processes: \"different sizes of scaffold pores, different cellular effects\".\n\nThey indicate that scaffolds with mechanical stability, biodegradability, appropriate size, surface roughness and porosity are required to generate the microenvironment that facilitates repair at the implant site.\n\nThey also explain that the size of the pore immediately influences the functioning of the implanted material, due to the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, the elimination of waste, ease of migration and cell-cell interaction inside the implant. [56]\n\nRecent report in the literature about the actions of three-dimensional scaffolds like the human extracellular matrix by Zhu, and collaborators (2017) highlight that these materials can act as an inductive template for the reconstruction of tissues and organs.\n\nThese authors also report that the architecture of biodegradable 3D scaffolds, analogs of the extracellular matrix (ECM), both at the macro and / or microscale level, should favor cell functions, including cell-matrix adhesion, cell adhesion -cell, cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, etc.\n\nThis group also contributes to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of the basement membrane, (a special type of extracellular matrix), which by adapting the tissues to a correct size-shape, and providing physical and biochemical signals to the cells, influence in the function of tissues.\n\nThey note that the regulation of biochemical signals that stimulate cells occurs through the integrin, which in turn is governed by the availability of ligands. [57]\n\nIn relation to persistent corneal epithelial defects and recurrent erosions, Goldman JN, et al., (1969) highlight that these are explained by damage to the basement membrane, which, however, is restored again. [58] In writing 2019 cutting edge article, Nikolova, M. P. and Chavali, M. S., listed the main challenges facing 3D scaffolds, including: (1) Structural surface properties optimized to improve cell adhesion and ECM deposition in the microenvironment of host tissues, (2) facilitation of vascularization to prevent implant failure, (3) Spatial and functional cellular regulation capacity, (4) Safety and simplification in procurement and manufacturing, (5) Minimize adverse effects and secondary damage, and (6) Mass production outside the laboratory environment. [59]\n\nIn the connective tissue microenvironment, dynamic and reciprocal interactions occur between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), crucial in the degradation or remodeling of the ECM.\n\nIt is understood that the ECM is subject to sustained remodeling mediated by interactions between this structure and its resident cellular components, according to the opinion of Daley and collaborators. [60]\n\nIn a study investigating ECM remodeling, Cawston TE, and Young DA. (2010) reported that proteins outside or inside a cell are subject to degradation and regulation of ECM Topography, particularly by the enzymatic action of metalloproteinases. [61]\n\nThe processes for the remodeling and degradation of scaffold materials prepared in similarity to the extracellular matrix formed the central focus of studies by Brown, BN and Badylak, SF (2014) in which the authors report that this occurs mainly by cellular and enzymatic mechanisms.\n\nThey explain that in the tissue microenvironment, these processes are mediated by inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, which produce oxidants and proteolytic enzymes that help in the degradation of the scaffold, whose effect, in turn, is the recruitment of stem and progenitor cells from the host into the site of degradation.\n\nThese authors also refer that ECM-based scaffolds, from the initial preparation, must retain their basic structure, so that constructive remodeling and subsequent degradation lead to better clinical results derived from their use. [62]\n\nLu, and co-workers [2011] explain that the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly dynamic structure, which is constantly being remodeled by components of the neighboring microenvironment.\n\nThis dynamism is essential during cell differentiation and restructuring of tissue architecture. [63] The remodeling and degradation of the extracellular matrix have become a central topic of research and Bonnans, C., (2014) and his group explain that this process is mediated by enzymes and metalloproteinases are mainly involved, whose activity increases during repair or remodeling processes and in diseased or inflamed tissues.\n\nThey also refer that certain cell, such as myofibroblasts, constantly rebuild and remodel the ECM through synthesis, degradation, reassembly, and chemical modification. [64]\n\nIn her review of the tear film and its importance in the maintenance of tissues, or adjuvant in the healing of ocular wounds, Klenkler B, Sheardown H, Jones L. explain that this is due to several biologically active growth factors secreted by the gland lacrimal and distributed through tears on the ocular surface, where they affect cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival. [65]\n\nKuhn L, (2005), associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering, University of Connecticut Health Center, presented a significant analysis on the factors that influence the non-existence of toxicity of biomaterials, which in contact with living tissues could affect them, and cites that the absence of toxicity refers to non-carcinogenic, non-pyrogenic biomaterials, non-allergenic, compatible with the blood and non-inflammatory.\n\nShe also made special mention of the value of the search in nature on the design, selection, synthesis, and manufacture of biomimetic biomaterials, which implies imitating aspects of natural materials or living tissues such as their chemistry, microstructure, or manufacturing method. [66]\n\nIn previous studies of materials intended to meet the human body (biomaterials) and biocompatibility essential to elicit an appropriate host response, Williams DF. (2008) has suggested that this attribute refers both to the compatibility of the material, as well as its ability to perform a specific function that generates the appropriate biological, chemical and mechanical acceptance, when used in a specific situation. [67]\n\nIn a study on the biocompatibility aspects of medical devices intended for prolonged contact with the tissues of the human body, Le Due P, & Wang Y. (2006) reported that it is essential that the material does not damage the tissues by chemical or biological actions.\n\nThey describe that the surface of the transplants is the one that provokes immediate biological responses in relation to the adsorption of proteins at the material-tissue interface. And they attribute this to the presence in the body fluids of ions in solution, as well as lipids, carbohydrates and proteins that can be adsorbed on the surface of the material. [68]\n\nStudies on the composition and organization in the cellular microenvironment and subsequent interrelation with one or more cells are particularly due to adherence, and the authors De Pascalis, C. and Etienne-Manneville, S. (2017), indicate that this is due to chemical signals, small molecules, and soluble factors, which encourage adhesion at the cellular level, to adapt to the properties of its environment. [69]\n\nStudies by Williams DF. (2009) on the nature of biomaterials to create neo-tissues similar or identical to the body's own at injury sites, point out that biodegradable support matrices and scaffolds are required, with structural and functional attributes that favor union cellular in wound healing events. [70]\n\nRecent studies on scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix by the groups of Vishwakarma A, et al., (2016) and Rowley AT, et al., (2019) have revealed the active participation of these materials when implanted in damaged tissues by recruiting and activating immune cells, creating a pro- regenerative immune environment, in addition to allowing the circulation of structural signals that promote cell migration and stem cell differentiation. [71] [72]\n\nAhearne, M et al., (2020): During scaffold degradation, in principle, the native ECM molecules must replace the structure without compromising its integrity or functionality. [73]\n\nA growing body of literature has examined the different methods in ocular surface reconstruction, and in this regard Espana, and collaborators (2013) include transplants of autologous conjunctiva, limbus stem cells (LSCT), oral mucosa epithelium or amniotic membrane (AM). [74]\n\nIn the repair and reconstruction of the conjunctiva and cornea with severe damage, several biological tissues have been used and Malhotra, C. and Jain, AK (2014) report that among others, oral, labial, and vaginal mucous membranes, the rabbit peritoneum, and the human amniotic membrane have been used. [75]\n\nIt has been described by Sangwan and collaborators (2007) that the amniotic membrane has been used to solve various problems of the ocular surface in at least 20 ophthalmic procedures, and among other corneal and conjunctival epithelial defects, pterygium surgery, acute and chronic chemical injuries, Steven Johnson syndrome, and in the treatment of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. [76] Also, matrix products supporting cells growth include preparations derived from Small intestinal Submucosa or SIS now commercially available, include, but are not limited to, OasisTM, SurgisisTM, Surgisis-ESTM, StratasisTM, and Stratasis-ESTM (Cook Urological Inc.; Indianapolis, Ind.) and GraftPatchTM (Organogenesis Inc.; Canton Mass.) and the ECM derived from urinary bladder (UBM).\n\nThe publication by Spaniol K, et al. (2017) describes those different materials are used for the reconstruction of the conjunctiva, including the conjunctiva itself (autologous), the mucous membrane of the mouth or nose and the amniotic membrane.\n\nThis group describes several limitations in the use of them, among which: low availability, involvement in autoimmune diseases, heterogeneity of donors and degradation in an environment with inflammation.\n\nAnd in their conclusions, they point out that according to these difficulties, new resources are necessary for conjunctival replacement. [77]\n\nIn relation to the complications and limitations of the use of the amniotic membrane, previous studies in this area of research have reported increasing uses in ophthalmology, however there are warnings of indiscriminate use since complications can occur, although infrequent.\n\nThus, the studies of the group by Dua (2004) on the use of this structure, describe that there are risks of transmission of bacterial, viral, or fungal infections if the donors are not properly examined, if the membrane is not processed under sterile conditions or if the storage is inadequate.\n\nThey also describe that the premature degradation of the membrane makes frequent repeated transplants necessary, and that on occasions, subepithelial residues persist in some cases and involuntarily opacify the visual axis. [78]\n\nIn previous studies on the treatment of chemical / thermal injuries with the amniotic membrane, Gabler & Lohmann (2000) published an article on adverse reactions secondary to its use, describing the possibility of accumulation of blood underneath it, which causes premature removal of the transplant.\n\nOther complications included in the article, indicate that granulomas have been observed around the membrane sutures. The author also reports on the formation of persistent subepithelial membranes, which by residing in the visual axis reduce their functionality and concludes that the disintegration of the membranes is also frustrating. [79]\n\nWhen evaluating 20 patients with acute chemical burns that affected the cornea and treated with Amniotic Membrane, Nubile M, Dua HS, Lanzini TEM et al. (2008), using in vivo laser scanning confocal microscopy (IVCM), evaluated the healing of the corneal epithelium after transplantation of said membrane.\n\nTheir results highlight that the amniotic epithelium was lost within 15 days after transplantation and their conclusions highlight the observation that when using the amniotic membrane as a patch, the epithelial cells migrate under the membrane instead of over it, a condition that causes the membrane to disintegrate and be lost.\n\nThey also suggest that the use of the amniotic membrane be applied as a graft with actions as a basement membrane that will promote migration and epithelial growth and not be used as a patch. [80]\n\nThe group of Clearfield E, (2016) in their studies on treatment in post-excision pterygium, when comparing the use of conjunctival autograft with the amniotic membrane, in a systematic review of Cochrane meta-analysis, the conjunctival autograft implies a lower risk of recurrence six months after surgery than the use of the amniotic membrane.\n\nBased on the results of this analysis, they conclude that the optimal treatment following removal of the pterygium is achieved with the conjunctival autograft. [81]\n\nThe human amniotic membrane is the scaffold most frequently used as therapy for ocular surface disorders, and in relation to the reconstruction of the stem cell niche of the limbus and corneal surface, the group of Yazdanpanah, (2019) experienced inconveniences in the use for this purpose, and the following stand out: First, the opacity and possible risks of infectious diseases. Second, the low tensile strength, due to the variability between batches. Third, the temporality of the benefits due to the disappearance after the transplant.\n\nThey conclude that amniotic membrane therapy may not rebuild the limbal niche in the long term. [82] U.S. Pat. No. 6,893,666 (Pag. 1, lines 45-48) discloses a composition and methods for using a tissue regenerative matrix to promote the restoration, remodeling, or repair of connective tissue.\n\nThe composition of the matrix comprises devitalized mammalian epithelial basement membrane of the intestine and tunica propria, which can further include submucosa, tunica muscularis, growth factors, a cell, or a polymer. For the purposes of this invention, devitalized means acellular or substantially acellular which differs in the present invention which preserves the cells in their natural form.\n\nDayuthapani B, & Sakthikumar D. (2017) have suggested that in the applications of polymeric products for the regeneration or replacement of native tissues, the implants must be made of biomaterials that promote cell and tissue growth through adhesion, proliferation, and cell differentiation, adapt to tissue responses, avoiding unwanted effects, and especially preventing immune responses. [83]\n\nThere is a considerable amount of literature on the design and manufacture of polymer-based scaffolds, among them those carried out by Bracaglia et al. (2017) and Li et al. (2018) who highlight that any scaffold when transplanted must facilitate one or more of the following functions:\n\n(i) Surface that favors the interaction of cells and different biochemical factors; (ii) Make it possible for said interaction to allow the adequate union and migration of cells, by exerting mechanical and biological stimuli; (iii) Enable the flow of cellular nutrients; (iv) Mimic the microenvironment like that provided by the native extracellular matrix (ECM). [84] [85]\n\nChen, FM, & Liu, X. (2016), in their research on biomaterials for tissue restructuring, define that they are devices or implants whose use allows to repair / replace native body tissues or as a scaffold to build tissues and organs.\n\nThese authors state that biomaterials for tissue regeneration can be classified into two categories: (I) living or once-living material of animal or human origin; and (II) other materials of plant or synthetic origin. [86]\n\nWilliams DF (2019) refers to mandatory and some optional specifications of biomaterials, depending on the application, such as: bioactivity, adaptation to the constantly changing microenvironment, morphological and chemical degradation at the required time, adequate elastic / viscoelastic properties, no cytotoxic, non-immunogenic and minimally pro-inflammatory. [87] Nikolova, MP, & Chavali, MS (2019), referring to the advantages of using natural polymers for 3D scaffolds, report that they exhibit better cellular interactions and lack inappropriate immune responses, and that on the contrary, synthetic polymers trigger immune responses and toxicity. [88]\n\nDolcimascolo's group, (2019) analyzes the challenges and strategies to facilitate and promote appropriate materials to produce scaffolds, which currently include different types, such as natural or synthetic polymers, ceramics, metals, or hydrogels.\n\nIn their analysis they highlight that the materials must meet the following key requirements: (i) biocompatibility, (ii) bioactivity and (iii) biodegradability.\n\nThus, they describe those biomaterials should facilitate a biomimetic environment like native tissue, capable of modulating cellular behavior and response, which, when integrated into the host's tissue, is recognized as its own, without provoking immune or inflammatory responses.\n\nIn the analysis they explain that the macrostructural properties refer to a 3D architecture that mimics the extracellular matrix (ECM), while the microstructural properties refer to the porosity of the scaffold, related to the shape, size and interconnectivity. [89]\n\nRecent report by the group of Caballe-Serrano J, (2020) recapitulates the properties that scaffolds must provide and include: (1) high biocompatibility, (2) structure with interconnected pores (to allow the entry of progenitor cells and blood vessels), (3) mechanical properties similar to native tissue and (4) degradation properties that coincide with the characteristic speed of the tissue to be regenerated. [90]\n\nMuzzio's group, (2021) outlining the processes necessary for the development of new implants and medical devices that seek to imitate cellular and tissue characteristics like the natural ECM, indicate that the interactions of different biochemical signals and their influence in cellular behavior, must be fully understood. [91]\n\nKim MS, and collaborators (2018) in their studies on cell migration in biomimetic implants to direct the formation of new tissues and originate specific cellular responses, mention that biological materials tend to provoke a favorable response in the host, by favoring the deposition of functional tissue at the desired site. [92] The advantage of using biomaterials of biological origin for the repair of ocular tissues, highlighted by Chen, F. M. and Liu, X. (2016) is since these induce the remodeling, repair-regeneration, and functional restoration of lost or damaged tissues. [93]\n\nYu X, and his colleagues (2015) studied the way in which biomaterials promote cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, and indicated that this is a consequence of the ability to interact with surrounding tissues, a term known as bioactivity.\n\nGenerally, biomaterials with a chemical composition comparable to the host tissue have high bioactivity, which benefits cell recognition and the growth of new tissues. [94]\n\nNatural biomaterials usually have excellent biocompatibility, so that cells can adhere and grow with excellent viability.\n\nThe historical review on xenotransplantation reported by Copper (2012) on the transplantation of organs between species, indicates that the efforts go back more than 300 years.\n\nCopper highlights that in 1838 the first corneal xenotransplantation (from a pig) was performed in a patient, while the first corneal allograft (from human to human) was not performed until more than 65 years later, in 1905. [95]\n\nThis same author had previously written: \"The increasing number of patients requiring organ transplantation has stimulated research on the use of animal organs for transplantation; pigs are considered the most likely potential source \". [96]\n\nThe work of Beckstead et al. (2005) who studied the behavior of esophageal epithelial cells on a variety of scaffolds is a good example illustrating the superiority of biological materials. [97]\n\nIn the detailed examination of the potential of the use of porcine xenotransplantation as sources of organs and cells by Hara and Cooper (2011), these authors listed the advantages of using pigs as a source of tissues and particularly highlighted the following aspects:\n\n1. Unlimited supply of organs, which would solve the growing and serious shortage of human organs.\n\n2. The availability of elective form of its obtaining, of healthy pigs, perfectly controlled, free of pathogens 3. The advantage of immediate transplantation to the patient with acute organic failure, which would result in significantly improved\n\nThey further highlight that Sir Peter Medawar (1960 Nobel Prize in Medicine), considered the father of transplantation immunology, declared in 1969: âWe should solve the problem [of organ transplantation] by using heterografts [xenografts] one day if we try hard enough, and maybe in less than 15 years survival. \" [98]\n\nThe most recent attention on the use of porcine materials has focused on the provision of micro and ultrafine porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM), by Wang, X., et al. (2021), using it in a model of corneal debridement wound induced in mice, in the form of sub-conjunctival injection, the results of which showed: 1. that UBM particles substantially reduced the formation of corneal turbidity compared to the group treated with Saline solution. 2. the UF-UBM suspension remained on the ocular surface for approximately 7 days, and importantly 3. they found that injection with UBM induced a potent type 2 immune response (IL-4 producing eosinophils in local corneal tissue and TH2 cells in the peripheral draining lymph node). [99]\n\nBecause of the anatomical and functional consequences that can result from inadequate treatments for eye diseases and injuries, there is a continuing need for alternative, particularly low-cost therapies that are easily accessible and easy to use.\n\nThe object of the present invention is to overcome the deficiencies of the state of the art and to provide a bioactive, biocompatible, degradable matrix with barrier functions, which guides the repair-regeneration processes for the reconstruction of the ocular surface.\n\nTo achieve the above object, the technical solution adopted by the present invention is to provide an inductive matrix for the remodeling, repair-regeneration, and functional restoration of lost or damaged ocular tissues.\n\nConstituents of the fine structure of the tissue graft composition:\n\nThe human esophagus, according to Londono & Badylak is a tubular organ that structurally, it comprises four concentric layers: the mucosa, the submucosa, the muscularis externa, and the adventitia. [100] Matrix is formed by nonviable cells of non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, basement membrane, and loose connective tissue which together form a three-dimensional integrated structure.\n\nIt is necessary to highlight the study related to this topic, carried out by Zhu and colleagues (2017) on esophageal tissues pointed out that the lumen epithelium is composed of stratified squamous epithelial cells supported by the underlying basement membrane.\n\nRegarding this structure, they indicate that it is a rough and irregular strip that consists of interlaced fibers and included in them are pores of unequal size. [101]\n\nThe author of the present invention considers that due to the intrinsic properties of this biomaterial, when being used and degraded within biological systems, damage to the host's tissues is avoided, attributed in part to the fact that both come from nature and the delicate processes of refinement during their elaboration.\n\nContributions to the world literature by Thankam's group (2020) on structures that seek to mimic the human and porcine ECM, manufactured from a variety of tissue sources, such as skin, heart, intestine, bladder, and adipose tissue, have demonstrated efficacy in tissue repair in preclinical models, clinical trials, and commercial use. [102]\n\nOne advantage is that the ECM components is generally well conserved and tolerated among species even by xenogeneic recipients according to Gilbert et al., (2006). [103]\n\nThe tissues that make up the bovine esophagus have been studied for more than thirty years by the author of the present invention, and in 1994, as co-author, obtained the patent of invention with the title Tissue equivalent membrane from bovine esophageal tissue No. US 5,300,306 and then the invention patent under the title of Biologically active graft for skin replacement therapy US 2017/0080127 Al, on 2017-03-23 (described hereinafter 0127), with variation with respect to the previous one due to the inclusion or retention of the basement membrane and connective tissue mainly intact (tunica submucosa).\n\nIn this patent (0127) the details of the elaboration of the matrix of this invention were included, highlighting the compliance with international quality and safety standards in its preparation, which are like the steps carried out in the elaboration of the matrix of the present invention. It should be noted that the inventor of the present invention was granted the invention patent with the title Serous membrane for ocular surface disorders related to the use of porcine small intestine serosa (or serous membrane), by the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) under No. PCT / IB 2016 / 054024 dated 07/05/2016 and subsequently granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (No.: US 2019/0038398 Al Date Feb. 7, 2019).\n\nDuring the time of application of said patent, it was noticed that the intestinal serosa disintegrated easily, losing its structural properties on the ocular surface in the first ten days, so the material object of the present invention was used, in authorized clinical cases (both institutional and patient) with ocular injuries, which evidenced from the first moment exceptional properties of consistency, stability, permanence and integration in ocular tissues, and this discovery was perceived by ophthalmic surgeons as an important advance in the reconstruction of the ocular surface (a real breakthrough).\n\nIn general, the method for preparing the heterologous matrix (HM) comprises the steps of obtain freshly harvested esophageal tissues of warm-blooded vertebrate, preferably porcine origin, from proper suppliers that ensure full traceability.\n\nIn all processes the standards to be met is done following Good Tissue Practices (GTP) to ensure that no contaminants are introduced into the tissue products.\n\nIt should be emphasized that in these processes, the equipment and the facilities are cleaned and decontaminated according to conventional and industry-approved decontamination procedures and all major processing are documented following industry practice, and FDA-USDA regulations standards.\n\nIt should be noted that in the process of purification and isolation of the matrix, the sophisticated processes of competitors are simplified, with lower costs and less human skill to prepare the final product.\n\nIn preparing competitive products, after the human extraction of the raw material, sophisticated laboratory equipment and manufacturing expertise is needed (for example, Engineers and personnel for the assembly and processing) before obtaining the final product.\n\nThe main limitation of these products is their expense: high price to compensate the high investment cost. The matrix of the present invention is abundant, inexpensive and the methods to process provide effortlessness to manufacture while the competitors require high degrees of synthesis which drive up costs.\n\nTo counteract the above problems, the present matrix provides a new and effective form of reconstruction of the ocular surface, by facilitating the repair-regeneration process in a structural- functional way, whose action is aimed at promoting epithelialization, reducing inflammation, and prevention of complications.\n\nDue to its intrinsic natural properties, the implant provides an anatomical and functional unit, which dynamically facilitates the union of cells and the function of the different tissues of the cornea and conjunctiva, with potential for use in a variety of ocular pathologies.\n\nThe microperforated porcine esophagus matrix accurately mimics ocular structures, whose natural template with a highly organized spatial-temporal pattern, suggesting crucial structural roles in the development and function of new tissues, being important also to highlight the bioactivity, biocompatibility, and metabolic integration.\n\nOf the properties of the matrix, the following stand out:\n\n(1) the 3D structure that favors cell adhesion, proliferation and deposition of the extracellular matrix, and the presence of pores that facilitate the transit of cells and signaling molecules or growth factors.\n\n(2) Its functional properties that generate a biomimetic tissue microenvironment equivalent to native tissue, promotes the development of new tissues in a structural-functional manner.\n\nThe porcine esophagus matrix of the present invention intrinsically possesses the basement membrane, whose pre-existing component reduces the time required for the restructuring of the injured tissues, an attribute by which its excellent therapeutic effects are achieved.\n\nThe efficiency of the natural scaffold of the present invention is attributed to the presence of interconnected pores, which, acting in harmony with local conditions, favor the passage of fluids, cells, and different molecules (growth factors, cytokines, bioactive ions, etc.) that promote the safe and effective reconstruction of a functional tissue.\n\nThe matrix after implantation is integrated with the native tissues and the accelerated response of the local vascularization is an outstanding factor for the viability and tissue reconstruction, and in the clinical evaluations carried out it is deduced that its integration and resorption is perfect, due to the type of tissues obtained in the stromal and epithelial planes.\n\nAs described above, according to the present invention, with the use of the matrix of the present invention, it is possible to improve the connective tissue of the deficient stroma, as well as to stimulate re-epithelialization on the injured ocular surface, and its effects allow to obtain a higher therapeutic level.\n\nAlthough the exact mechanisms causing such results are not yet fully understood, elucidating the precise responses that occur in its natural structure will allow for more controlled and efficient tissue repair-regeneration if progress continues.\n\nDerived from the careful preparation and sterilization of porcine esophageal tissues, this material when interacting with the host cells, generates beneficial cell responses, which exclude immune reactions, which prevents the risk of graft rejection.\n\nIt should be noted that in none of the cases of use of the matrix, both on the skin and on the ocular surface, has there been any type of xenograft rejection (hyperacute, delayed, acute or chronic cellular), and the biocompatibility of the scaffold has shown the total absence of any reaction attributed to its use.\n\nThe main indications of the matrix of the present invention are directed to transplantation to some of the structures of the anterior segment, among them: cornea, conjunctiva, and sclera.\n\nThe matrix has proven to be a very versatile tool in the ophthalmological field, and derived from the greater knowledge of its properties, it makes it possible to consider expanding the indications for its use in carefully selected patients.\n\nThere are great opportunities for the use the matrix and the author speculate that by taking advantage of the knowledge and technology of the present invention, they allow the use in the design and optimization of new materials and scaffolds.\n\nAlthough the current results are promising for its biocompatibility, mechanical resistance, high availability (mass production), manipulability and stability, more clinical trials are needed for its use in other pathologies of the ocular surface. The author strongly believes that the widespread use of the implant will contribute to the optimal resolution of complicated ocular surface pathologies in the ophthalmic community, proactively addressing the needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups through targeted interventions.\n\nFrom a social perspective, the product is accessible, for the benefit of the population that is poor and may need it in the future.\n\nFor developing countries, concerns about \"access\" to technology need to be considered.\n\nThe present invention addresses this need and solves a significant problem for less developed areas of the world with an affordable product.\n\nThe technical solutions of the present invention are further described in the following by means of specific embodiments, which are intended to facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, but the specific embodiments do not limit the scope of protection of the present invention in any way.\n\nCurrent data in the form of large, randomized, controlled trials are lacking; however, the data that is available suggests that reliable, definitive repair of complicated ocular defects are achievable. The inventor notes that for every facet in this process, further research is still needed.\n\nIn conclusion it can be stated that much progress has already been made in the past ten years, and that the results obtained thus far show great promise regarding the future clinical application of the new heterologous matrix.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention refers to a new biological and biocompatible heterologous matrix, appropriately obtained and processed, a lyophilized porcine esophagus, wherein the tissue comprises a natural three-layer structure, characterized in that: one layer is a layer of stratified epithelial tissue and the other layer is a loose connective tissue, with a highly organized pattern that precisely imitates ocular structures, which can be used as a graft (substrate) or as a 'patch' (biological dressing) in a variety of injuries or conditions in the cornea, conjunctiva and / or eyelid, after trauma, diseases or surgeries, whose action as an inductive template in the extracellular space (ECM) favors cell-cell contact, cell-extracellular matrix and signaling molecules, which leads to development and function of new ocular tissues, in which its use does not present adverse immunological conditions, whose lyophilization process prolongs its clinical use.

the esophagus of warm-blooded vertebrate in accordance with the invention is carried out by separating the mucosa, basement membrane and tunica Submucosa from the esophagus of warm-blooded vertebrate in a manner that ensures minimal disruption or damage to this natural arrangement.\n\nConservation of these components from the esophagus of warm-blooded vertebratesâ results in the preparation of a (BAG) composition that is non-immunogenic, and, thus, does not induce an adverse host immune response when it is implanted into a host.\n\nThe method comprises the steps of delaminating the mucosa, basement membrane and tunica Submucosa from the whole esophagus of warm-blooded vertebrate.\n\nAccordingly, one embodiment of this invention provides a method for preparing a natural cellular/nonliving composition comprising non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (Mucosa), basement membrane and connective tissue (tunica Submucosa) in its natural sheet forms (Ad integrum) from the esophagus of a warm-blooded vertebrate.\n\nIn another embodiment the mucosa, basement membrane and tunica submucosa for use in the (BAG) composition in accordance with the invention are typically prepared from the esophagus of a warm-blooded vertebrate harvested from animals including, for example, pigs, cattle, sheep or other warm-blooded vertebrates and does not exclude the use of the esophagus of cold-blooded aquatic animals and other marine mammals.\n\nIn another embodiment, this invention provides a process for preparing a biocompatible graft composition from the esophagus of warm-blooded vertebrate, and in general, the method for preparing the mucosa, basement membrane and tunica submucosa comprises the steps of obtain freshly harvested esophagus of warm-blooded vertebrate from proper suppliers that ensure full traceability and in a First Process the material is washed in a large volume of circulating water to remove adhering blood and residues of food, followed by immersing in 0.1 % (v/v) peracetic acid and 95.9% (v/v) sterile water for two hours.\n\nThen, in a Second Process the operator proceeds to cut the material in the longitudinal axis using surgical instruments, and carefully proceed to separate the adventitia and muscular layers in order to preserve intact the inner structures (mucosa, basement membrane and tunica Submucosa) because they are the primary material of the present invention.\n\nThen the larger pieces of esophagus can be cut in segments 8-10 cm long x 5 cm wide. Next, in each segment, the peracetic acid residue is removed by washing twice for 15 minutes with PBS (Buffered saline) (pH-7.4) and twice for 15 minutes with sterile water in order to remove any residual disinfectant-sterilizing agent.\n\nEach tissue should be packaged individually as soon as possible into a vacuum bag (multi-layer synthetic bag). Air is removed from the bag.\n\nMode for Invention (Method of Making the Biologically Active Graft composition (Description): The biologically active graft (BAG) composition is made from the esophagus of warm blood vertebrates. The esophagus comprises distinct layers.\n\nFrom the inner to the outside, these are: mucosa, submucosa, muscle, and adventitia. The mucosa and submucosa (include the basement membrane) forms the main foundation in the present invention.\n\nThe biologically active graft (BAG) composition is obtained from animals that have passed ante mortem and postmortem inspection and meet regulatory requirements for not poisonous products.\n\nOnly materials from proper suppliers that ensure full traceability should be used. Manufacturers should provide a certificate of compliance for every lot of materials should take into account the quality of tissues to be removed and their appropriate handling after removal.\n\nProcess ONE: Evisceration stages: At the site of animal sacrifice the esophagus was separated from the trachea and lungs to tie it, which allowed the lungs to be removed through the diaphragm without rupturing the esophagus.\n\nThis is primarily a hand and/or knife operation. Both the inner and outer layers of the esophagus are carefully removed, and appropriate gloves must be wearing for all procedures. After harvest the esophagus, should be inspected in relation to the smell, irregularity or abnormality in shape or color and discard the material if any such defect be present.\n\nThem the primary material is transfer torn an area that allows copious amounts of circulating fresh water for clean ing its external and internal Surfaces and mainly run water through the lumen of the esophagus.\n\nNext desirable processes of the invention involve immersing the tissue source (e. g. by submersing) in 0.1% (v/v) peracetic acid and 95.9% (v/v) sterile water for two hours.\n\nLaboratory Working Areas. The laboratory should be kept neat, clean, and free of materials that are not pertinent to the work.\n\nThe surfaces of Stainless-steel table should be decontaminated before and after each use and application of pressure with vigorous scrubbing greatly improves the removal of grease and other unwanted contaminants from a preparation surface.\n\nFreshly prepared hypochlorite solutions recommended for decontamination at 1 g/1. All instruments used during the procedure should be sterile and stored on sterile drape.\n\nProcess TWO: In the previously disinfected surface of stainless-steel table and covered with a sterile drape, the tissues may be removed from their container and laid upon table, using an aseptic technique with sterile cloths and gloves.\n\nUsing surgical scissors or scalpels proceed to cut the material completely in the longitudinal axis, to identify macroscopically the structures that make the composition.\n\nThe mucosal layer is found inside the cylindrical tube which in the normal esophagus is recognized for having smooth surface and white color. The material thus obtained was placed over the area to be processed with the mucous plane put downward.\n\nUsing Surgical instruments, such as Metzenbaum Scissors or scalpel, carefully proceed to separate the adventitia and muscular layers (which is recognized by its red color) to preserve intact the inner structures because they are the primary material of the present invention.\n\nThe mucosa, basement membrane and tunica sub mucosa are separated easily and consistently from the whole esophagus and should be examined to confirm there is minimal tissue debris on its surface. Larger pieces of esophagus tissues can be reduced in size and cut in segments 8-10 cm long x 5 cm wide (this may vary slightly according to the animal that is used as source material).\n\nNext, in each segment, the peracetic acid residue is removed by washing twice for 15 minutes with PBS (Buffered saline) (pH-7.4) and twice for 15 minutes with sterile water to remove any residual disinfectant-sterilizing agent.\n\nEach tissue should be packaged individually as soon as possible packaging into a vacuum bag (multi-layer synthetic bag). Air is removed from the bag by means of the vacuum packaging machine and the bag then is sealed.\n\nOnce received, the matrix is lyophilized and then sterilized from the manufacturers, can be stored for as long as 24 months at room temperature and it is easily available at the point of use.\n\nThe product is manufactured by a US company which specializes in the supply of various tissues including, bones, veins, corneas, eyes, brain material, joints, organs, glands, skin, blood, tendons, fetal, reproductive, and digestive materials, for research to many medical manufacturing companies and universities throughout the United States.\n\nIn the facilities of the company that prepares materials of swine origin, the pig receives ante and post-mortem inspections by the USDA and acceptance with the FDA in accordance with ISO 22442-2:2007 Medical devices utilizing animal tissues and their derivatives â Part 1: Application of risk management Part 2: Controls on sourcing, collection, and handling.\n\nRegulations to the Control of raw materials in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), ICH, and other regulations/guidance's cited below: Regarding 21 CFR 211.110 Control of in-process materials, ICH Q5A/D for cell substrates and viral safety, ICH Q7 discussing the need to check with appropriate materials specifications, ICH Q10 stating that a bio manufacturer is responsible for the quality of purchased materials.\n\nIn summary this company meets the following important aspects: adherence to regulations, quality systems emphasis, quality management, monitor/audit of the manufacturing process, aseptic techniques required during production, purity product and process-related impurities, maintenance of equipment, batch production and control records and maintenance of documentation.\n\nSterilization The lyophilized products are shipped to a contract sterilizer to terminal sterilization by any suitable medically acceptable method: for example, using gas, e.g., ethylene dioxide, exposed to gamma radiation at 17-30 kGy, or exposed to an electron beam for a period sufficient, to sterilize the tissue product.\n\nThis process pursues achieve a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) sufficient to kill at least 99.9% of bacteria or other potentially contaminating organisms.\n\nFinal Inspection\n\nSterilized product returned from the contract sterilize company, is inspected for shipment and release to the end user. Inspection will include package integrity and final labeling inspection, to name a few.\n\nThis final inspection ensure that the product contained therein matches the product specifications and inspected to determine the existence of holes, broken seals, tears, contamination, or other physical defects.\n\nUnits passing inspection are released for storage, distribution, and subsequent use. The matrix was now considered transplant ready and stored at ambient temperature conditions.â\n\nThe only additional step that is included are the micro perforations that are made to the matrix, prior to sterilization, designed to allow free transit of the ocular fluids, necessary to lubricate (tear film) and assist in the repair-regeneration of damaged tissues.\n\nExample No. 2 Heterologous matrix (HM) Placement Procedure\n\nPreventive aspect: In elective surgery, patients should abstain from taking aspirin for 10-14 days before surgery; alcohol, vitamin E, and NSAIDs for 4-5 days before surgery; and Coumadin for 3-5 days before surgery which may contribute to postoperative hematoma or seroma formation.\n\nThe Heterologous matrix (HM) is not suitable for placement onto infected wounds.\n\nThe success is dependent on the underlying condition and rigorous case selection is recommended and does not use it in primary cases of pterygium excision.\n\nIt is suggested that the specialist value the use of general anesthesia in any complicated intervention or topical anesthesia in the affected eye. When the HM is used as a 'patch' (biological dressing), it tends to disintegrate within seven to 14 days, making it a temporary bandage.\n\nWhen used as a graft (substrate) the expectation is that the basement membrane and connective tissue of the matrix will become integrated into the ocular tissues, with subsequent permanence.\n\nManagement of the recipient wound bed: this is probably the most important prerequisite for successful grafting of the Heterologous matrix (HM).\n\nIt is preferable that the matrix is used after the removal of necrotic and pathological tissues, and when applied it is done on a vascularized receptor site, free of infection and local bleeding.\n\nThe matrix requires to be rehydrated before use for 5 minutes in sterile normal saline or Ringer's lactate, and then is cut to the size of the required defect, placing it in any case with the epithelial side outwards (label indicating such orientation on the container).\n\nPressure on the product to displace the liquids underneath it and bring it closer to the injury.\n\nFixation of the matrix to the ocular surface in severe injuries is essential to prevent early detachment.\n\nA single sheet may be applied as a graft or patch at least 1 mm larger than the defect and anchored to the ocular tissues with multiple interrupted 10-0 nylon monofilament sutures.\n\nToo many suture ties can incite tissue growth, thereby inducing a granulomatous foreign body reaction and patient discomfort.\n\nAn alternative material to use in the conjunctiva is 8-0, 9-0 or 10-0 Vicryl sutures given the rapid healing ability of these tissues, and this is preferred to be placed in children.\n\nSuture less applications with fibrin glue make the procedure easier and more comfortable for the patient, although this method has not been used at the time of the preparation of this patent.\n\nThe graft and the dressings can be left in place for extended periods without detrimental effects to the underlying injury.\n\nThe basement membrane and connective tissue will be permanently incorporated into the ocular structures of the recipient host. Complications that the surgeon may encounter further than infection include seroma and/or hematoma formation, and graft contracture. Although wound infection is rare, when this is suspected, appropriate bacterial identification is obligatory and according to the cultivated microorganism's antibiotics s"
