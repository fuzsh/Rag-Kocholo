        "text": "Fig.1 Freeze frame from the âGreat Warâ title sequence\n\nThe Great Warâ television history series produced by the BBC in the early 1960s has not stood the test of time and so does not warrant broadcast 50 years on. I can give four reasons why it is dated; 1) as an artefact; 2) because of the social context in which the BBC produced and transmitted the series fifty years ago and, 3) how it compares to series produced to mark subsequent commemorative First World War milestones and 4) coverage planned by the BBC for the period 2013-19.\n\nIf âthe work of the historian closely mirrors the society in which he worksâ (Carr, 1991) the âThe Great Warâ needs to be seen in the context of the early 1960s when there was an outburst of publications as well as radio, TV and theatre on the First World War. Whilst âThe Great Warâ, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the First World War, stood out for the reception it received and audience sizes it should not be seen in isolation.\n\nThe BBC producer, Tony Essex, who conceived of and produced âThe Great Warâ, was not an historian, but a hands-on filmmaker. (Hanna 2002:02) He devised the thematic approach of âThe Great Warâ and demanded a literary style from its writer (Hanna 2002:35). He saw the series as an epic tragedy, a story âas great as that of the Bible. (Hanna 2002:38). He personally ensured the inclusion of âthe war poetsâ even suggesting that a poem commissioned from Siegfried Sassoon would feature in the opening sequence of every episode (Hanna 2002:36). As a âcreativeâ producer his intentions are most clear in Episode 17, where âPasschendaeleâ is told as a horror story with music that would be fitting in a Hitchcock thriller while the narration describes the hideousness of the worst nightmare â being wounded and slipping off the duckboards to drown in the mud. This is the tragic story that Essex wished to tell; the emotional appeal too strong for a reasoned and object history. The few seconds that is the title sequence, was designed by the producer to be an âAlice in Wonderland-likeâ tumble down a rabbit hole that lands you on a snarling skull attached to a flesh and cloth tattered body is evocative of what follows, Hanna (2002 pp.38-45). For viewers in 1964, Essex preached to the converted, fuelling the view that the war was a futile waste of young heroic lives. Essex aimed to âproselytize, if not instructâ. Hanna (2002:32) writes that the visual and emotional impact carried by the images âcemented â¦ war myths already embedded in Britainâs cultural landscapeâ, something that greatly frustrated the lead writer John Terraine as, overwhelmed by the filmâs images and music, audiences missed his revisionist views of Haig and his interpretation of the Somme and Passchendaele as an historian. John Terraine was the lead writer who wrote thirteen of the 26 episodes and co-wrote another two. Keegan (1978 pp. 664-5) describes Terraine as âthe Enoch Powell of British Military Historiansâ. The historical adviser Liddell Hart fell out with Terraine and quit the series., Hanna (2002:32) Liddell Hart published his complaints in an open letter in The Times disagreeing with how Terraine portrayed Haig and wrote about the Somme and Passchendaele. Strachan (1991 pp. 41-67) While Danchev states that Terraine is the author of a âprevailing orthodoxyâ (Strachan, 1991). Perhaps Correlli Barnett, one of the writers on âThe Great Warâ, was right when he said that âtelevision history is too superficial and âprÃ©cisedâ to be anything other than popularisation.â Barnett (2006:7)\n\nJohn Terraine said that writing for TV was different to writing history for print (Hanna 2002:51). Television, especially as broadcast in the early 1960s in Britain was to sit down to view a passing event (Moran, 2013). This rarity helped lodge it in the national psyche. Television is no longer like that.\n\nAccording to Grieves (2002), Terraine drew largely on the official histories and quasi-official memoirs and according to Hew Strachan, Terraine only saw the war in terms of a âwesterner.â For a western audience then, and a British one, in 1964, the lessons and experiences of âThe Great Warâ as expressed satisfied the prevailing beliefs; these would not satisfy the views of a British audience in 2014 that is better educated, increasingly professional and multi-cultural.\n\nIt is the interplay of images, music and words that delivers the âepic tragedyâ that Essex desired, the impression left with viewers not always that desired by the writers. In Episode 9, whatever John Terraine wanted to say in revisionist terms about Haig fighting a war of attrition, the âliteraryâ prose dramatized by the narration of Sir Michael Redgrave and backed by music composed by Wilfred Josephs that sounds like a pastiche of Samuel Barberâs âAdagio for strings Op. 11 leaves viewers with this sense of âfutility and lossâ (Hanna, 2002:7) â the overwhelming feelings experienced by audiences. For an historical perspective, although ideas such as âBritainâs new army was growing old and wise in battleâ, (Disc 4) were well grounded, the choice of images from the archive footage that the production team were limited to, made it are hard idea either to show, or to convince others of, for this different production techniques and approaches would be required, for example the conflicting views of historians openly debated, something future programmes on the First World War would do. Only through pausing and replaying a DVD can you wonder about such lines as these: âEvery citizen fought his private war of independence when he decided to uproot from Europeâ, which rather ignores the population that was already there, or African-Americans who had been taken there as slaves; or how to stirring and patriotic Elgar-like music we learn of the role of the US âMaking the world safe for democracyâ and âFighting for the Anglo-Saxon race to save the world.â In 1964 the cold war threatened the world, and such lines would be evocative for audiences then, that they could be in 2014.\n\nIn 2014 the audience, not the press are the âprodusersâ â (Bruns, 2006) they both âproduceâ and âuseâ digital media; they are the reviewers and where they find fault or points of contention they will stop, review, scrutinise, compose their thoughts and share online. If broadcast âThe Great Warâ would generate considerable debate though it is doubtful that viewers would conclude, with the exception of A.A. Gill and his Sunday Times readers, that it has âstood the test of timeâ. A.A.Gill is critical of anything on the First World War that is not âThe Great Warâ. (Hanna, 2002:55) For the fiftieth anniversary of the First World War, as for subsequent anniversaries of note, âThe Great Warâ was commissioned as public commemoration on Britainâs public service TV channel â it also made history as a piece of programme making. (Hanna, 2002:10) Four component parts equate to the experience of viewers fifty years ago: the words, the images, the music and where viewed.\n\nThe words, spoken and brought to life by benighted British Thespians such as Sir Michael Redgrave give it an âestablishmentâ tone worthy of a sermon from the pulpit. The audience are supposed to listen and not question the facts or the views. These words are evocative of a different era. The words jar to modern ears, for example, in Episode 13, Terraine wrote:â âThe British regiments marched to catastrophe. These were Lord Kitchenerâs volunteers. The eager, enthusiastic, physical, spiritual elite of the British race.â While in Episode 15, Gordon Watkins and John Williams wrote: âThe Senegalese, their chocolate faces grey with cold, were unable even to load their rifles. Caught between German artillery and their own fire they fled the field.â And in Episode 16, Alistair Horn writes of: âFighting for the Anglo-Saxon Race to save the worldâ. While in Episode 22, the soundtrack features bombastic trumpets as the bombardment starts ahead of the Americans going in with John Terraineâs words âA blood transfusion on a scale never dreamt of now beganâ.\n\nThese are words narrated by actors, not delivered by broadcasters or from the mouth of a subject matter expert. Where there are interviews some of the participants appear to have been schooled or to have learnt their lines; effort by some is made to speak in a Reithian âBBC Englishâ. Over the last fifty years regional accents have been celebrated and authenticity in interviews, especially in documentaries or news reporting, managed and edited so as not to suggest any tampering with the words spoken or opinions expressed.\n\nThe images were limited to those from the era â indicating why so little is said on the Royal Flying Corps, as there was little to show. (Hanna, 2002:47) This may also suggest why so little is said about the soldiers as conscripts rather than volunteers â they made up 50.3% of the British Expeditionary Force. (Hanna, 2002:48) Finding footage to fill nearly seventeen hours resulted in compromise â the producer is left being unable to say what cannot be illustrated. Episode One, for example, suffers from either starting or indulging the view that Europe was basking in a tranquil summer â the calm before the storm. Since 1964 the techniques for historical documentary making have developed so that greater credence can be given to the history. The BBC co-production 1914-18, (Hanna, 2002:54) transmitted in 1989, had a panel of historians advising and writing for a shorter series that is Euro-centric and puts the conflict in context in a more objective, informed and open manner. Itâs approach that shows how the history documentary genre has moved on, especially having international markets for the programme in mind and so implying that âThe Great Warâ has not stood the test of time. In Episode 19, we are shown a curiously drawn Map of the world that self-evidently gives more significance to some countries and less to others â¦ a dubious representation of the actual geographical the world as the narrator reads while the narrator reads âIt was a world war now, few countries of any stature were able to stand asideâ. Such views would jar with a British audience in 2014. Some subsequent TV productions have done worse, for example, âWorld War One in Colourâ, (Hanna, 2002:56) but âThe Great Warâ used footage shot to cover the Somme in 1916 to illustrate events across the period 1914-18. For editorial reasons âThe Great Warâ says nothing of the Armenian genocide and glosses over the French Mutiny, by doing so the orientation taken by Essex is clearly a British perspective.\n\nAs an historic artefact âThe Great Warâ was corrupted by the production process. For example, footage shot to cover the Battle of the Somme, from soldiers going into the trenches, to the wounded returning and prisoners of war, is used repeatedly to illustrate the events of 1914â18 not just of 1916 â an approach that would be considered unprofessional today and open to criticism. Filming was limited by access to the action and tainted as the authorities banned, then permitted, then censored the content that was processed, edited and distributed to cinemas. (Fraser et al. 2009) Here we enter the debate of history as truth against reflecting the views of its authors and the age, even to the worthiness of history on TV. Corelli Barnett argues that presenting the stories to millions via the TV medium is a worthwhile compromise. (Fraser et al. 2009) The music, composed by Wilfred Josephs, (Hannah, 2002:38) evoke specific emotions as one would with a drama series is often overpowering, much to Terraineâs frustration it was a combination of the images and the music that people recalled which left an impression not of a necessary endeavour, but of a futile and horrific waste of life. (Hanna, 2002:51) Music supporting the moving image controls and influences mood. In âThe Great Warâ consideration of the opening title sequence alone and its impact on audiences indicates what impact it can have. Wilfred Josephs composed music is gut wrenchingly sad, fully of tragedy, horror and drama. He went on to compose for TV drama series such as âThe Prisoner; and âI, Claudiusâ. Throughout the 26 episodes of âThe Great Warâ the images and music play off against each other in way that is far closer than that achieved by the words as the composer worked to the edited images, whereas the writers, under instructions from Essex, were kept from looking at any of the rushes chosen from the era in order to write to his demanding literary standard. (Hanna, 2002:52) As a televisual experience this is a compelling attraction of âThe Great Warâ as a piece of emotional storytelling and for this reason some would say it has âstood the test of timeâ. The impact from the choice of images and demanding music was greater than that of the words. (Hanna, 2002:35)\n\nThe sitting room was part of the experience â a tiny screen (by todayâs standards) showing a fuzzy black and white image in the corner of the room, the curtain closed, the family gather to watch together with Mum knitting and the kids look up from the floor. (Moran, 2006) The technological changes to the way TV is viewed in Britain 1964-2014 significantly impacts on whether âThe Great Warâ has stood the test of time. Is Charlie Chaplin still broadcast? In Britain, in 1964 there were two channels delivering 425 UHF or 650 VHF black and white analogue set, while in 2014 we enjoy multiple digital HD and 3D channels viewed when we like on a multitude of large or small screen static or portable devices that are linked to the Web.\n\nâThe Great Warâ set in motion a great swathe of subsequent BBC productions, from Alan Clarkeâs âCivilizationâ (1968) to David Attenboroughâs âLife on Earthâ (1972) and Jeremy Isaacs âWorld at Warâ (1974), (Hanna, 2002:52) but this is why it is difficult to view outside its historic context â it is not as a piece of programming that would be palatable to a contemporary audiences because of its dated production techniques, its preachy and overly dramatized story telling and at times its inaccurate, Anglo-centric point of view.\n\nBoth BBC radio and TV had in different ways looked at the events of the First World War. A J P Taylor had delivered a series of radio and TV lectures. (Hanna, 2002 pp. 17-18) On BBC radio âThe long, long tailâ used popular songs of the 1914-1918 era, re-versioned for the stage as âOh What a lovely warâ that in turn became an enduring movie.\n\nBritain was still a colonial, if not a global power. Baby boomers were growing up. TV was still a British, even an English dominated medium, whereas cinema had long been taken over by Hollywood and the US. The class divide of the British population is immediately apparent in the Great War TV Series owing to the use of actors as narrator and voices of prominent First World war figures â there is an onus on âreceived pronunciationâ and âthe Queenâs Englishâ, even those interviewed speak in a clipped, scripted way with regional accents so watered down they are almost indistinguishable â the early 1960s was an era when the working class took elocution lessons if they wished to ârise above their stationâ â to call upon a phrase of the First World War generation.\n\nIn 1961 only 19% of the population were in professional or managerial and technical jobs, whereas by 2011 this has increased to 49%. In 1964 there were over 100,000 veterans in their early 70s and 80s as well as a larger population that had lived through 1914-1918. The audience in 2014 is different because it is better educated and wealthier. Their views are different and less divided by class. In 1964 there was however a prevailing orthodoxy. (Danchev 2002:273) The audience for âThe Great Warâ was captive and predisposed to the interpretation.\n\nA documentary series of this scale was new to British Television; the format of âcelebrityâ subject matter expert delivering in situ to camera and conducting the interviews was yet to establish itself, dramaâreconstruction was frowned upon â old and established formats still reigned, for an example, with the transmission of a series of history lectures by A.J.P. Taylor. (Hanna, 200 pp. 17-18) The skill of scriptwriting documentary for a visual medium came from cinema and the newsreel. The Great War reflects a transition between the newsreel and the narrative documentary. (Hammond and Williams, 2011)\n\nThe 1960s is not reflected in the âThe Great Warâ. This was a decade of increasing antiestablishmentarianism, where the generation of âbaby boomersâ began to assert themselves in programmes such as âThe Week that Wasâ. Views of the First World War fell into four camps: respect, derision, attempts at objective interpretation that could only be fully informed by with the release of official First World War papers between 1968 and 1972, (Danchev, 2006:270) and opinion that ranged from the bias of a Marxist-Leninist view to fictionalised, largely anti war storytelling such as âKing and Countryâ and âOh, What a Lovely Warâ.\n\nRespect and a received point of view, inevitably came from official points of view of the war, the historical record had been written by the âvictorsâ in Soviet Russia, the French Republic and a Great Britain whose empire was in tact between the wars but described as âfizzling outâ by the 1960s while Germany still struggled to assess objectively both the execution and outcome of the First War and its role in leading to the Second.\n\nThirty years on from âThe Great Warâ the BBC marked the 80th anniversary of the conflict with a re-versioned US series 1914-18. Without bombast, shock or sensationalism this series, though there have to be gaps and prÃ©cis, took a gentler, more nuanced and considered view of events including episodes that âThe Great Warâ missed, from the Armenian genocide to the experience of African troops, to the role of women and close analysis of the personae dramatis of the French mutiny. The debate about Haig is introduced but not tackle and new themes are introduced, such as the role of national honour to fuel the war.\n\nThe choices made are considered and the product of working with a panel of historians with different specialism. It may gloss over the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, but profile of the Kaiser Wilhelm II closely while the debate regarding Haig is stated as such and then left. We gain the Armenian genocide, the role of women with profiles of Vera Britten, an American nurse and munitions workers in Britain, but there is still, as in previous television series, little on the âwar in the airâ no doubt for want of suitable footage showing how the images may still dictate the stories that are told. The poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen are closely scrutinized and there is greater social, political and cultural history. It is a âpeopleâs storyâ with the profiles of the likes of Jean JaurÃ¨s preferred over the leaders covered in previous histories. The inclusion of the African story is refreshing.\n\nWe donât watch TV the way we did in 1964, this is reflected in the planned output by the BBC to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War: every kind of genre, across platforms, for audiences from nursery school to Newsnight via Childrenâs BBC (CBBC) and the Open University (OU) with 2,300 hours of TV, Radio and Online content.\n\nIn many different ways, this addresses the issues and events comprehensively for distinct audiences rather than the family that would have been expected to sit down and view âThe Great Warâ in 1964.\n\nHistorians are âpeople of their timeâ. (Evans, 1997 pp. 257-261) The 2,300 hours of TV and Radio output from the BBC between 2013 and 2019 will reflect the way in which multiple voices, and in particular the voice of the viewer is heard. There is no more significant pointer to the character of a society than the kind of history it rights or fails to write (Carr (1991:43).\n\nâThe Great Warâ is best seen as an artefact, of historic interest for what it is. Indeed, UNESCO accepted âThe Battle of the Sommeâ documentary footage shot in 1916, into its Memory of the World register in 2005 (UNESCO, 2005) â the rushes of which feature throughout âThe Great Warâ. In turn âThe Great Warâ, created from 844,800 feet of archive footage and over 20,000 photographs, paintings, posters and contemporary newspapers from twenty countries and compiled by 33 staff. Viewing the âGreat War TV seriesâ in 2014 would best be achieved in bite sized form on YouTube on a handheld device, picking selective moments to suit the time and place â perhaps contemplating the sacrifice of soldiers in front of a memorial to the dead or on a battlefield âpilgrimageâ. The audience, without any living experience of the events, will view it through the lens of subsequent and current wars and how these are reported. They will, by choice, or prompted to do so, form an opinion by drawing on multiple alternative sources and most significantly âsit forwardâ to share and form views on social platforms rather than taking the views of the original authors as gospel.\n\nA television series is different to the printed word yet the temptation is to compare âThe Great Warâ to individually authored histories, part works or other âepicâ volumes on the events or encyclopaedic official histories. The challenge in 2014 and pertinent to the question of whether âThe Great Warâ has stood the test of time is how technology, especially digital formats on large screens and in our pockets, that allows instant sharing, feedback, and meaning construction through networking. If, as Marshall McLuhan (1962:8) suggested âtechnology extended sensesâ then the technology we hold, pocket and wear today, are a prosthesis to our senses and to the manner in which the product of these senses is stored, labelled, interpreted, shared, re-lived, and reflected upon. For this reason âThe Great Warâ, if its authors, and the owners of the copyrighted footage wish to galvanise and interest a 21st century audience, it should be posted online as an open education resource.\n\nIn 2001 Badsley spoke of âtwo Western Fronts: the Western Front of literature and the popular culture and the Western Front of Historyâ. Badsey (2001)\n\nIn 2013 we have multiple Western Fronts because of the Internet and Web 2.0 where the individual, with a second screen, sitting forward, creates, shares, and in the context of the First World War exploits what Sobchack 2002 described as âmediaophemesâ â a bite sized nugget of impression and meaning that renders itself easy to view, post, mash-up, comment on and share.\n\nThough âThe Great Warâ has not stood the test of time, it nonetheless set in train the development of the television history series. Ironically, with the advent of YouTube, the kind of lecturer that A J P Taylor gave in the 1950s and 1960s on radio then TV is exactly what is suited to the Web as a TED lecture. Other transformative platforms online include discussions around book reviews on Amazon and the massive expansion of family history. (Dixon and Porter, 2001)\n\nTo view the series an unopened DVD box set from 2002 will cost around Â£100 through Amazon. Instead go to the BBC World War One Centenary website and plan you listening, viewing and reading over the next five years.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBadsey, S.

Insights on Haig are limited â perhaps reading Haigâs diary and a biography at the same time would help. This is written by a military historian with judgement of Haigâs command key. We get little insight into the man â if there is much a a personal life to probe. His diary appears to reveal little. What does come over is how often Haig was to blame for actions that were unlikely to succeed in doing much other than expending a good deal of munitions and men â time and time again he planned an offensive that would lead to a break-through, require cavalry support and put tens of thousands of men against barbed wire, machine guns and shrapnel. His greatest skill was to climb and keep climbing the ladder of promotion and to tread carefully around events which might have led to his being passed over for promotion â¦ or his resignation asked for, or accepted.\n\nMy first read. A second read possibly to follow unless I can be pointed to a biography.\n\nNotes as iPhone/iPad pictures with annotations (Studio) and a mindmap (SimpleMinds)\n\nBritain had been preparing for war with Germany as is clear from manoeuvres, in this instance with both France and Russia, in 1912 (Harris, 2008:51). Perhaps the re-organisation of the Army to have the Expeditionary Force, however small, was part of an anxiety and vulnerability â had Britain not also contemplated conscription?\n\nAs the nature of artillery changed â longer range, great accuracy and a diversity of shells types from high explosives to shrapnel it is staggering that proper thought wasnât given to how destroyed the land was over which the armies would have to travel.\n\nTypo alert! Actually there are a couple more but I so no value\n\nWhere tactics have failed to deliver why did Haig persist? How could more of the same possibly get better results next time? What part of his mindset made him stick to this? Does he lack imagination? He appears emotionally dry or aloof â his relationship with his wife and family hardly suggests a person with a close emotional attachment.\n\nHaigâs greatest skill and purpose was to climb to the top of the Army ladder â what he did or could do when he rose to the top was another matter. This isnât what makes a great leader â he is like a career civil servant. But what would a hot headed, womanizing, gambler of a man done with this power? If Haig made mistakes they need to be considered and compared with other leaders on the Western and Eastern Fronts. Had Britain a leader like Foch, Neville, Falkenhayn or Holweg â¦ or the Russian aristocrats would we have fared better or differently? And if weâd had Robertson rather than Haig?\n\nHistory written by a military historian is different to history or biography â the audience here is expected to learn and potentially apply at staff level the lessons from past battles. Haigâs diary is revealing because in this supposedly private moments he is reveals so little: statements of the weather, not what this could mean, statement of events without reflection on what he did well or badly. Self-control in both his public and private life.\n\nTo understand Haig then we need to know who the alternatives might have been and whether in reality they could or would have behaved differently: Robertson, Du Can and Rawlinson are different men.\n\nMy impression is of a deluded fantasist with no one able or willing to stand up to him â¦ not even Lloyd George. Haig, with Royal patronage and few competing for his role, could and would do as he pleased. He resented having to play second fiddle to the French. In the early stages of the war he ignored orders or requests with potentially dire consequences yet he got away with it.\n\nHaigâs tactics: more munitions, human dynamism and officers of the âthrusterâ type â people who would risk all regardless. Is there anything we can learn from Haigâs achievements as a polo player from this? What does it require to win at polo?\n\nHaig pressed on with tactics that would leave many thousands dead for little gain and he wasnât able or willing to question what he could or should do differently.\n\nHow clear did failure have to be to get Haig to change his tactics?\n\nFailure of this kind should surely have seen Haig replaced? To what extend did his âmoral fibreâ, his otherwise untarnished character, make it less easy to remove him?\n\nOverexcited, overoptomistic, blind to failure, forever looking beyond the horizon, convinced cavalry had a role, yet able to try gas and tanks â¦ anxious for his peers and superiors to shower him in praise and his subordinates to be fawning â¦\n\nSelf-righteous and self-assured â did his religious beliefs permit his unstinting view of the world? He had the image of someone who deserved authority and respected it. He was fit, sober and in a stable marriage. He worked hard and played the game well. Born into a different age could he have survived? He lacks the flair of Montgomery or Churchill. Described as taciturn, to what degree might or could his asthma have been a controlling influence?\n\nHe looked the part and was fastidious about his health â what else could as asthmatic do in the early 20th century? Did he know what the triggers were, or had he learnt from experience to avoid certain foods and situations â not least smoking? Was he prone to chest infections?\n\nWhilst those around him realised all talk of a âbreak-throughâ was unrealistic, this is what Haig constantly planned for and expected. Or was it simply wishful thinking?\n\nStep by step is what occurred â¦ as a result from efforts to breakthrough? A case of shoot for the stars and hitting the moon? That in Haigâs eyes step by step would have equated to inconsequential nibbling?\n\nObsessive, selective, fixated, God-guided, controlling, cavalry-orientated, driven obdurate, blind â¦ consistent, controlled, tempered, magisterial â¦ aloof and with tunnel-vision.\n\nAble to comprehend, but unable to bend? Unable to think of any alternative. The world around him changed, but Haig stayed resolutely in the 19th century.\n\nChance the way the leaders played off against each other?

Although written, in some hurry, to come out in time for the 80th Anniversary of the November 1918 Armistice, âThe Pity of Warâ hardly cashes in, as it is a serious, in-depth, closely referenced and at times a specialist read.\n\nFig.1.

It is referenced every full-stop of the way. He may show a bias to having studied in German in Germany.\n\nThe audience for âThe Pity of Warâ, you imagine, is the graduate historians, or economic historian or the well-read Western Front buff. âThe Pity of Warâ flips with intricate relish some of the myths that have arisen in relation to the First World War while the toughest and most specialist read at the core of the book is a study of the financial health of the combatant nations. Needless to say, there is an overwhelming wealth of insightful detail, all of it meticulously referenced.\n\nFig.2.

He gained his MA and D.Phil in History from the University of Oxford, spending several years studying and researching at the University of Hamburg, where his interest in the personalities and mechanics and international finance in the early part of the 19th century developed, in this respect his focus naturally tends towards Germany at the expense say of France and Russia and the Balkans. Ferguson confounds what might be the ground rules of historical study by liking to second guess events, these âcounter factualsâ imagine what might have occurred âif?â Do these offer insight, or do they confuse, especially where at times Ferguson is emphatic that events would have gone a certain way if x or y had or had not happened. He edited and write for an anthology of such âcounter factualsâ so clearly believes they are a valid way to gain insight, though it may also show an interest in literature and fiction, rather than just the nots and bolts of the professional historian.\n\nFerguson is a driven, passionate, even obsessive historian determined to make his point or counter-point with a relentless catalogue of evidence. His modus operandi in this text is to get at his âtruthâ of the First World War by addressing common questions and myths. He undoes several and turns others on their head, often in a convincing way, though sometimes doubts remain, though further pursuit of the references should help the reader come to their own conclusions. The crudest structure of the book is to take ten difficult questions and query their validity â you then wonder if this has been akin to setting ten tough graduate assignments, and that answering them in his own professorial voice.\n\nHe is a mighty white, British middle-class intellect, who acknowledges the humble background of his council-house dwelling grandfather â the First World War veteran, shares with us his own grammar school education, then brushes up against the Oxford Union types of his alma mater and reveals a tone regarding officers in the war that is critical of what public schools produced at the time and is anti the British gentry of the period too.\n\nâThe Pity of Warâ receives glowing reviews in the Press and professors from leading universities have reviewed it, enjoying the challenge of meeting him square on, applauding some of his insights, but offering criticism of other conclusions.\n\nThere is no doubt âThe Pity of Warâ adds substantially to a broader and deeper understanding of the First World War, though it should be seen as a book that complements, rather than replaces texts that provide the chronology, conflict and causes in a more systematic, and less judgmental manner.\n\nFergusonâs authority can become a barrier, certainly there are parts of his thesis where it is a struggle to take on board the evidence that requires some understanding of international finance and economics. Where there are few, if any, similarly informed authorities it is difficult to know how to challenge some of his views â was Germany really more efficient at killing people? Is it creditable to put a price on a combatantâs head? Money, Ferguson argues, tells a different story to that offered by historians in the past. Easier to comprehend and therefore to engage with are his portraits of men with ambitions and efforts to blame.\n\nThe title âThe Pity of Warâ says little about the bookâs contents.\n\nThe words are not those of the author, but rather taken from one of the war poets. The âwar poetsâ are one aspect of the misconceptions that have developed around the First World War, hijacking how people felt about the war at the time with a post-war negative and sentimentalized view.\n\nFerguson picks out ten questions to scrutinise, myths to unwind, misconceptions to set straight, as well as original views of his own. Like a postgraduate making his case at the Oxford Union, Ferguson that strips out the facts and attacks each in turn often in meticulous detail, all referenced and from a single perspective. Ferguson doesnât sit on the fence, he has an opinion and makes it forcefully. For example, when he states that, âwithout the war of attrition on the Western Front, Britainâs manpower, its economy and its vastly superior financial resources could not have been brought to bear on Germany sufficiently to ensure victoryâ (KL 10193) is stated as an absolute with a counterfactual offered as the alternative â Britain would have had to comprise rather than fight on in any other way.\n\nFig.7. Grab from an annotated page from the eBook version of âThe Pity of Warâ (used the App âStudioâ)\n\nThe references is often dense, not a sentence on a page without a footnote or citation.\n\nFerguson puts the loosest of chronologies at the core of the ten questions he addresses and makes no apologies for avoiding where other authors have already been, indeed he offers a reading list for those wanting a chronology of events or the minutiae of the fields of conflict themselves. The arguments he makes are not always convincing â he appears at time to be contrary for the sake of it. There is little doubt that the book is a personal journey that though multifaceted is not comprehensive; as well as a lack of narrative or of conflict there is little said on women, on the Home Front, on the technology, not equally fascinating facets of the war from underage soldiering and the execution for cowardice of deserters. There are nonetheless some fascinating insights: Germanyâs actions where founded on fear of their weakness, not belief in their strength; the Allies were not as gung-ho for war as the Press in particular suggested at times, it was surrender, rather than economic failings or the appearance of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) that lead to Germanyâs defeat, a nation that clearly relished viciousness more so than the allies whose leaders were want to take repeated all or nothing gambles.\n\nFig.8. Grab from âThe Pity of Warâ. The citation may be correct, but the author cited did not take these photographs. They are either still from the âBattle of the Sommeâ or copies of photographs taken by the photographer who accompanied the âcameramanâ.\n\nHad as much care been taken with the images as the words then Ferguson would not have fallen into the trap of giving credit to Tropical Film Company Battle of the Somme film footage grabbed as stills by other authors in the past and offered as their own photographs.\n\nFerguson touches on, cites and lists a comprehensive range of historians, authors, dramatists, economists, poets and artists making âThe Pity of Warâ a desirable stepping off point, even learning design for a taught masters degree.\n\nFig.9. Grab from mindmap featuring possible errors in âThe Pity of Warâ\n\nHe doesnât always convince and there are errors that escape his eagle eyes (or those of his researchers). It is conjecture to say that Grey et al. exaggerated the threat of Germany despite intelligence. He suggests that a Tommy gets angry with a Jerry prisoner in the Battle of the Somme film without seeing that the man is injured and a prisoner inadvertently bumps into him, and regarding footage from this film shot he continues the calumny of authors who claim stills taken from the film footage or photographs taken by a photographer who travelled with one of the cinematographers, as Hart does, are part of their own photographic collection. Ferguson treats the movie âAll Quiet on the Western Frontâ as biography, when its author Remarque saw little of the front line and it is conjecture to suggest that the EU would have resulted had Great Britain been late or stayed our of the war. The argument that the central powers were somehow better at killing, maiming and taking prisoners ignores that they were largely on the defensive in conflicts which favoured defense. And that the loss of skilled workers to troops hugely impacted on the economy and our ability to wage war when hundreds of thousands of perfectly able women proved how good they were.\n\nFig.10. Grab from mindmap featuring possible bias in relation to the public-school educated landed gentry of the First World War era.\n\nFerguson reveals some bias when he talks about Grey, Churchill and their ilk, from their public-school educated and landed gentry backgrounds. He has a dig at a public school type suited to Empire because of their qualities of leadership and loyalty when in truth young men in these establishments are a heterogeneous lot. And with Grey he has a go a cod psychology by trying to relate Grey the fly fisherman to Grey the foreign minister, in one particular incident thinking that Grey describing the challenge of landing a heavy salmon on lightweight tackle is at all like dealing with Germany on the brink of war. In such instances Ferguson is pushing it too far, it would make amusing TV or a witty point in a live debate at the Oxford Union, but it lacks conviction on the page.\n\nFig.11. Grab from mindmap suggesting that Ferguson is something of a dilettante, though he gives little time to the media âtriviaâ that has emerged regarding the First World War on TV and in films.\n\nFerguson is dismissive of media events such as as âBlackadder Goes Forthâ, âBirdsongâ and âGallipoliâ, and goes light on the War poets and memoirs from veterans. Though he shows a magpie dilettantism with mentions of invasion stories, art history and Penny dreadfuls.\n\nFig.12.
