        "text": "All,\n\nAs usual, I'm trying to submit a monthly short article to the website (Hebrew) of The Society for the Heritage of WWI in Israel, for 'This month in the war'. Unlike the common knowledge - the months between Gaza II (April 1917) and Beersheba / Gaza III (End of October 1917) were actually full of small scale operations, almost every night. I wrote a couple of months ago about Infantry operations in the Northern sector of the front line, and this time I want to complete something I wrote about the Cavalry activity in the open areas of the Southern sector. I need some help to 'close gaps'.\n\nI'm concentrating on the activities of the 7th A.L.H. Regiment in August 1917 (maybe I'll also refer to the end of July). An interesting event is mentioned briefly in the British OH (Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 25-6) about a raid, deep behind the Ottoman lines on August 16th. The Australian OH is on one hand much more detailed, yet not very accurate.\n\nFor example - Ottoman Gaza Beersheba line?! No such animal... no date etc. The regiment's War Diary gives a much better picture, but it lacks the personal stories that are in the OH, such as the heroic act of Corporal R. G. Moore. Here is the description in the War Diary:\n\nI found nothing in Preston's Desert Mounted Corps or in The Marquess of Anglesey's A History of the British Cavalry.\n\nThe main source I'm missing is the regimental history: The history of the 7th Light Horse Regiment A.I.F. / by Lieut.-Colonel J.D. Richardson.\n\nIf anyone can help with this book and scan for me the pages that relate to July & August 1917 that would be great!\n\nThanks in advance\n\nEran\n\nI'll write in a minute another post about another event, which in a way is even more interesting\n\nMate,\n\nLike wise I have little on this;\n\nBIRD Thomas Harold 2/Lt 7 LHR A Sqn C Troop (in Army lists dated 12-14) shown A Sqn A Troop (unit RO's) 5-15 shown A Sqn 4 Troop (in Army lists dated 7-15) evac to hosp (influ) 8-15 rtn 8-18 shown T/OC A Sqn (from hyman sick) (unit RO's) 9-15 prom T/Capt C Sqn (from Richardson WIA) 9-15 (G) revert 1-16 shown T/OC A Sqn (unit RO's) 1-16 prom Capt 2ic A Sqn 3-16 prom Maj OC A Sqn (from windeyer WIA) 9-16 T/att RHQ 11-16 shown OC A Sqn (unit RO's) 11-16 DSO & MID - for his actions & command including the captured of a Turkish Div officer at 1st Gaza 26-3-17 and good work at 2nd Gaza 19-4-17 war diary reports his A Sqn captured a Troop of Turkish Cav on patrol near Wadi Imleh 23/24-4-17 shown T/att T/CO RHQ (from LtCol Onslow T/Bde CO) 12-17 T/att senior officers school Zeitoun 4-18 shown T/OC C Sqn 4-18 shown T/att T/CO RHQ (from LtCol Onslow T/Bde CO) 5-18 revert 8-18 WIA 23-9-18 R/hip accident thrown from horse near Hajla rtn 11-18 shown OC A Sqn 12-18 early repat born 20-4-88 (Sgt to prov 2/Lt D Troop CSqn/6 LH 14-10-12 CMF 6 years)\n\nCARTER John Markham 713 Pte 7 LHR 2R Tos possibly B Sqn? 5-15 evac to hosp (influ) 8-15 rtn 11-15 to T/Cpl C Sqn (from merchant) 12-15 (G) to T/SQMS B Sqn (from spencer) 4-16 prom 2/Lt A Sqn A Troop (from Waddell WIA) 8-9-16 shown A Sqn C Troop (unit RO's) 11-16 MC - for his patrol with Lt Holland's Troop which captured a Turkish patrol 24/25-4-17 and for his patrol of Abu Irgeig 6-8-17 and for his work at Beersheba 31-10-17 T/att school of Instruction (hotchkiss instructor MG course) Zeitoun 5-17 T/att school of Instruction (Topo course) Zeitoun 9-17 WIA 5/6-11-17 groin shot at Khuweilfeh RTA on medical leave to CTD 9-18 rtn 7 LHR 10-18 shown B Sqn 12-18 shown A/Adjt RHQ while in Turkey 2-19 later WWII\n\nHOLLAND Clive Edward 569 Pte 7 LHR C Sqn to L/Cpl 2-15 WIA 22-5-15 R/foot shrapnel when C Sqn att 11Bn on Bolton's ridge evac to hosp Malta 6-15 rtn 9-15 to T/Cpl (from dunn) 10-15 (G) to SQMS 12-15 to RQMS RHQ 12-15 Serbian Cross of Kara George 1st class - reported for his work at Romani Aug 1916 prom 2/Lt A Sqn D Troop (from Ryan B Sqn C Troop WIA) 6-9-16 shown A Sqn D Troop (unit RO's) 11-16 T/att school of Instruction (20th officers general course) Zeitoun 11-16 MID - for his capture of LtCol Serif Bey and staff 53rd Turkish Div at 1st Gaza 26-3-17 and for the action with Lt Carter's Troop which captured a Turk patrol 24/25-4-17 to Adjt RHQ (from Davies) 6-17 T/att school of Instruction (hotchkiss instructor MG course) Zeitoun 10-17 MID - reason not stated shown possibly B Sqn? 12-18 later WWII\n\nThese all refer to there actions during the 1st Gaza Battle and after 2nd Gaza, not during July-Aug 1917?\n\nI could find little mentioned other then a number of Accidents?\n\nDUNN William Westley 621 A/Cpl 7 LHR 1R tos C Sqn 2-15 WIA 31-7-15 R/thumb poisioned cut accident at Holly Spur (G) to Instructor A/Sgt 2 LHTR 7-16 to T/S/Sgt ATC&DC 3-17 rtn Cpl B Troop?

Night Enterprises now cheifly consisted in raiding parties toward detached posts known to be held by the Turks during the day, such as the hut near 410 (point 410), on Wadi Imlieh, Bir Ifteis and Point 630, but as the enemy was taking no chances, these were always found empty at night.\n\nPracticaly all junior officers and a number of Seniors also took their turn with these operations, purposly designed to make the enemy nervous and to detroy his initiative. An effort was made unsuccessfully to ambush his dawn patrols at point 630. A daring recon by day, by Lt Carter, of an enemy redoubt near Bir Abu Ireig, and a night recon of the Gaza-Beersheba road near point 570, by Lt Williams were particularly good pieces of work, and later were awarded with MC's.\"\n\nThe History again fails to give dates other then end of the month?\n\nThe next date is the next paragraph which starts \"On the night pf Aug 3-4, a Brigade operation---\"\n\nAs to the 27th Cav Regt, I have it on that front as Divisional Cav to a number of Units?\n\nAllied Intell reports place the regt with the 22nd Corps\n\n\"shown Jun 1917 Allied reports - Sqn 27th Cav Regt (150 men) 2xCo's 17th Pnr Bn (300 men) -\"\n\nAllied Intell show for the 16th Div;\n\nshown July 1917 Allied reports 2xCos 17th Eng Bn (300 men) 1Sqn/27th Cav Regt (150 cav)\n\nJust to add\n\n2nd Sqn 27th Cav Regt was with the 24th Div\n\n3rd Sqn 27th Cav Regt was with the 26th Div\n\n4th Sqn 27th Cav Regt around this time was with the 6th Corps and later shows up in 1918 with the 60th Div\n\nSo it was not unusual for a soldier to be transfered into another unit, I have seen this to build up the three Cav Regts of the 3rd Cav Div?\n\nBut as yet what Cav Units these 25 men were from is unknown other then 27th Cav Regt?\n\nCheers\n\nS.B\n\nEdited 5 August , 2020 by stevebecker\n\nMate,\n\nAs to the action by Cpl Moore.\n\nThe Unit History gives this;\n\n\"On Aug 14, the Brigade helped to cover an important recon from the South-West of Beersheba by the C in C by extending the left of the NZMR Brigade from point 810 between the wadi Sufi and Hanafish and 630. The Regt had a quiet day, but was ordered to remain out that night and make another attempt to place a bomb on the railway near Irgeig. The Brigade withdrew at 5 pm and the Regt remained hidden in the orchards at Karm until after dark and then moved as rapidly as possible for Kh Imlieh and point 770, which was reached shortly before midnight.\n\nC Sqn under Maj Barton, supported by \"B\" (B Sqn) was sentforward dismounted. B Sqn remained hiddin in the Wadi El Sufi and C Sqn moved on. The railway was gained and the engineers set to work placing the bomb in position. It was a task which took some time and before it could be completed a Tirkish patrol appeared. Cpl Moore and some men charged gallantly with the bayonet, but the Turks fired and gave the alam. Cpl Moore was killed but the whole enemy patrol was accounted for, four being bayoneted and two taken prisoner\"\n\nWhat Ottoman Cav Regt they were from is not found anywhere. Clearly most of the time Cav is mentioned they must be from the 3rd Cav Div, but Turkish Div Cav were at times out and about.and the 27th Cav Regt was in a number of Div's on that front?\n\nNo confirmed date is given by the Unit history other then some time after the 14 Aug 1917?\n\nBut needs more research.\n\nS.B\n\nMate,\n\nThe 6th LHR also has a bit on these actions\n\nBARROW Percival Gilbert 229 Pte 6 LHR B Sqn C Troop (680) T/att MMP 1 Div HQ 6-15 evac to Imtarfa hosp Malta (dysentry) 7-15 rtn 9-15 to L/Cpl 11-15 to T/Cpl 11-15 (G) to Cpl 12-15 to T/Sgt (from macrae) 5-16 revert 7-16 to L/Sgt (from burlace) 9-16 to T/Sgt B Sqn 9-16 to Sgt (from ross) 12-16 recom - for his actions as A/Troop leader of Flank guard in operation around the Wadi Imleh 30/31-7-17 reported killed by sniper suporting the 5 LHR during retreat of Turkish Army near Sheria buried on battlefield near pumping station and Orchard at Jemwawa or Junnawa by chaplain Maley reburied Gaza War Cemetery Palestine (shown 5 LH not in records?
