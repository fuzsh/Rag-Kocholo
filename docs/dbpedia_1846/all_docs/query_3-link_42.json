We organized one in 2018 and six in 2022 - thanks to the support of our members and growing CAASA team! Today we look at our Family Office Summit 2019. This one came about from a survey of about 20 SFOs had in membership at the time, or were at our CAASA Annual Conference 2018. We simply asked them if they‚Äôd be interested in our organizing a family office conference tailored to their requirements and with out usual Chatham House rule & extreme privacy policy. 14 of them responded almost immediately saying it was a great idea - so we did it! While not our flagship conference (CAASA Annual Conference) this has certainly been a crowd-pleaser and a great way for family members and their professional staff to become exposed to and investigate a range of alternative investments. You can view the program here: https://lnkd.in/gmqkNq6r All of our publications are available here: https://lnkd.in/gTwUCzPP We would like to note that at all of our conferences we strive for a 40% investors, 40% managers, and 20% service provider attendee break-down and have achieved this in virtually all cases. This, we believe, is a golden ratio that provides value to all attendees. We also like to keep our conferences smaller (200-250 max) and would only increase delegate maximums if we have the requisite (40%+) block of investors already registered.

It might be easier to walk through the door if you know what‚Äôs on the other side. When you visit one of our meetings, you can expect one or more members to welcome you and introduce themselves. We join Toastmasters for different reasons, and putting ourselves out there in social situations is a goal most of us have. You will also be invited to sign a guest book, and we will have a guest packet ready for you to take home, so you can find more information at your leisure. We will try to seat you near one of our club members in case you have questions before or during the meeting. It may look like we really know what we‚Äôre doing at these events, but believe us, it takes practice, and a lot of grace when things don‚Äôt go as planned. Sometimes, we‚Äôre just as nervous as you might be. There will be a printed agenda, so you can easily follow along. Our meetings start at 6:30pm, and we usually show up around 6:15 to set up and get situated. We promise to wrap up between 7:30 and 8pm, so we can all get home to enjoy the evening, or socialize for a little longer, if attendees so choose. Otherwise, at our events, we just try to support one another and have a good time while we try new challenges in front of a forgiving audience. Next time, I‚Äôll share what exactly a guest does at one of our events (spoiler - it‚Äôs only what the visitor is comfortable with). The next Palmetto Toastmasters event will be Monday, October 9, 2023, at 6:30pm. Join us at the F.W. Symmes Library, 1508 Pelham Rd. in Greenville, SC, or online via Zoom by contacting us at https://lnkd.in/gXExE69p.\n\nüí´The 'Our Year In 2023' report is here! Here at pro-manchester we are not frightened to shout about all the amazing things that we do, but we also know that numbers can really bring those stories to life. Hard facts that really demonstrate who we are, what we do and the impact we have in our community. The last time we released our impact report we were emerging from the pandemic and our lives were beginning to resemble some kind of normality. It was early days back then though and we are now two years on, I think it is safe (ish) to say we are finally beginning to leave those days behind us. That is not to say that those turbulent times didn't leave a permanent mark, a legacy of lessons and understanding that must be recognised and we are pleased to say we have embraced them with both hands. If the pandemic taught us anything, it was that we all need a community. A place to go and be with like-minded individuals. A collaborative environment where we can learn, share passions and enthusiasm. This report demonstrates in numbers and from the mouths of members that this is what we do and what we do best. Over 95% of our events activity is in person and is rated Excellent or Very good by 92% of those who attended. Over the past few years we hosted over 200 hundred events at various locations across Manchester and we engaged with over 20,000 attendees. In the past year we have welcome 90 new members to our community and we have launched several new programmes and initiatives to continue to provide more and more opportunities for our community. But whilst the numbers tell part of the story, the real gems come from the members themselves. The real life people who tell you how it is. So, yes, please do digest the numbers, but sit back and take note of the personal testimonials that really complete our story and hopefully remind you, just what it‚Äôs all for and what is in it for you.

How do we make it meaningful? üé® It‚Äôs the Beyond Borders pick for July: ‚ÄúThe Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why it Matters‚Äù by Priya Parker. Join us for a very special book club meeting on July 20th from 11-12:30PM at the Pharr Memorial Library. Book club member Joel will be facilitating! üéôÔ∏è ABOUT THE BOOK: In The Art of Gathering, Priya Parker argues that the gatherings in our lives are lackluster and unproductive‚Äîwhich they don't have to be. We rely too much on routine and the conventions of gatherings when we should focus on distinctiveness and the people involved. At a time when coming together is more important than ever, Parker sets forth a human-centered approach to gathering that will help everyone create meaningful, memorable experiences, large and small, for work and for play. Drawing on her expertise as a facilitator of high-powered gatherings around the world, Parker takes us inside events of all kinds to show what works, what doesn't, and why. She investigates a wide array of gatherings‚Äîconferences, meetings, a courtroom, a flash-mob party, an Arab-Israeli summer camp‚Äîand explains how simple, specific changes can invigorate any group experience. The result is a book that's both journey and guide, full of exciting ideas with real-world applications. The Art of Gathering will forever alter the way you look at your next meeting, industry conference, dinner party, and backyard barbecue‚Äîand how you host and attend them.\n\n** Throwback Thursday ** Let's take a look at our many conferences over the years.

We're in this for the long-haul and for member value!\n\nBeyond Overload: Simplifying Conferences for Maximum Impact üéôÔ∏è As someone who's been on both sides of the conference curtain ‚Äì as an event host and an eager attendee ‚Äì I'm here to debunk a persistent myth: the belief that a better conference means piling on more speakers, more events, and more hustle. Let's be real, though. A conference isn't a buffet where more choices necessarily mean a better experience. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Too many options can lead to a phenomenon known as \"decision paralysis.\" Imagine attendees trying to pick the perfect session from a plethora of overlapping choices ‚Äì talk about overwhelming! üòµ Quality content is the secret sauce that makes a conference truly stand out. It's not about cramming in as much as possible, but rather about curating a thoughtful selection of speakers and events that deliver real value. üéâ By keeping things manageable, we give attendees the chance to truly immerse themselves in the content. They can focus on absorbing insights, engaging in discussions, and forging meaningful connections. Because let's face it, a conference isn't just about the sessions ‚Äì it's about the conversations that spark new ideas and collaborations. üî• So, as you plan your next conference (or attend one), remember: it's not about the hustle and bustle, or the quantity of sessions on offer. It's about creating an environment where quality content shines, attendees connect meaningfully, and inspiration runs wild. üåü Catch you at the next enlightening conference."
