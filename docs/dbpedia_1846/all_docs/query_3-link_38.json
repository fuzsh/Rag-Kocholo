        "text": "John Doyle is one of the most versatile, creative, and prolific voices in folk and traditional music. His gifts as a guitarist, songwriter, vocalist, and producer have played an essential role in the ongoing renaissance of Irish traditional music. The Dublin-born, North Carolina resident has become a familiar face at Celtic Colours since first performing at the Festival in 2003. Whether playing the role of sideman, or taking centre stage as singer-songwriter, John adds a contemporary edge that finds fresh light in even the most well-worn of tunes. A past Artist in Residence, John has performed at Celtic Colours on his own and with fiddler Liz Carroll, as well as with The Teetotalers, in a trio with Michael McGoldrick and John McCusker, and for a special collaboration with Jeremy Kittel and Josh Pinkman of Kittel & Co. This will be John’s tenth time appearing at Celtic Colours. He will be playing in the Guitar Summit as well as in a trio with Mick McAuley and Oisín McAuley."
