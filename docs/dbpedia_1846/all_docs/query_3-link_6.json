        "text": "Detail from The Fate of Marsyas by John Doyle, 1838. Dayton C. Miller Collection, Music Division, Library of Congress.\n\nThis is a cartoon representing British political figures in the 1830s. It is part of a series entitled HB Sketches by John Doyle, this one being no. 557. The title, The Fate of Marsyas, refers to the mythological story of the shepherd Marsyas who challenged Apollo in a musical contest. Marsyas played the flute and Apollo his lyre and they were judged by the muses. Marsyas lost the contest and Apollo had him flayed alive.[1]\n\nMany of the political figures are identified in pencil on this lithograph, but the true meaning behind the satire needs further research. John George Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham (1792-1840), is depicted as Marsyas. In 1838, Durham was sent to Canada as the Governor General of British North America to investigate the Patriotes Rebellion. He returned to Britain five months later and wrote his report which became known as the Durham report. His recommendations undoubtedly caused controversy and he was probably \"flayed\" politically as a result, perhaps by Lord Brougham who is represented as Apollo.[2] See also 71/U and 432/U, other political cartoons by John Doyle.\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nJohn Doyle, draughtsman, painter, lithographer, and caricaturist, 1797-1868\n\nThe initials \"HB\" represent the signature of John Doyle, an English portrait painter and caricaturist, according to Bénézit and the online Catholic Encyclopedia. Doyle was born in Dublin in 1797 and died in London in 1868. He first studied under the Italian landscape painter, Gabrielli, then with Comerford, a miniature painter, at the Academy of Drawing in Dublin. He began his career in London as a portrait painter about 1821, but without success. About 1827 or 1828, he began drawing caricatures of political figures of the day, signing his work \"HB,\" made up of two pairs of his initials \"JD\" placed one above the other. Until the end of his life, few people were aware of Doyle's identity. From 1829 to 1851, he created his famous series of caricatures documenting all of the political movements of his era. These caricatures were published in The Times of London. Figures included members of Parliament, the Duke of Wellington, the Duke of York, and others. His caricatures were never mean-spirited. They were clever, sometimes biting, yet generally marked by courtesy and gentility. There are 600 of Doyle's graphic works in the Print Room of the British Museum. He retired from his professional work seventeen years before his death. His son, Richard Doyle (1824-1883), was also a caricaturist. Another son, Charles, was the father of the writer, Arthur Conan Doyle, so John Doyle was the grandfather of the man who created the famous character, Sherlock Holmes.[3]\n\nNotes"
