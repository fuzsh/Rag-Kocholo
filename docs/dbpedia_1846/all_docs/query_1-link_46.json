        "text": "Property developer John Doyle who murdered his partner hours after she had surgery for breast cancer was jailed for life.\n\nJohn Doyle, 54, strangled solicitor Sian Rees at their home after she decided to end their fraught 15-year relationship.\n\nHer body was found in his van, which he crashed on his way to dispose of it.Doyle was so drunk when he arrived at the hospital to drive Ms Rees home that she had to get behind the wheel herself, the jury heard.\n\nHe had spent the day drinking in pubs and had been seen leering at women, Exeter crown court heard.\n\nAfter she packed clothes to leave their home and stay in a hotel on June 30 last year he attacked and killed 50-year-old Ms Rees.\n\nThe next day police officers found her corpse between the front seats of his Ford Fiesta which he had crashed into a hedge. She had been dead for 12 hours.\n\nThe jury took almost two days to unanimously convict Doyle of murder. He had claimed that he accidentally killed her after she became hysterical and attacked him with a knife in the kitchen of the house in Merton, North Devon.The court heard how Doyle had previously acted in a manner chillingly similar to the attack on Ms Rees.\n\nOn New Yearâs Day in 1989 he tried to choke his then estranged wife at her home in Australia, also attacking her boyfriend. She escaped after kicking him and forcing him to loosen his grip.\n\nJudge Graham Cottle rejected Doyleâs attempt to argue self- defence in the murder of Ms Rees, who was originally from Aberdare in South Wales.\n\nThe judge said part of his story â that he had been taking her to a doctor when he crashed the next day â had been âfancifulâ.\n\nHe added: âThere is no doubt in my mind that he was planning to dispose of the body.â\n\nDoyle was jailed for a minimum of 16 years for what the judge called a âbrutalâ murder."
