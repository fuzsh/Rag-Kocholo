        "text": "Your greatest contribution is the ones you leave behind, raised on the ways and gentle kindness of a small town southern man. You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete. John F. Brooks, Sr. was our sunshine. He made us happy when the skies were grey, and he’ll never know how much we loved him. John performed his final song on May 26, when he passed away at Inspira Medical Center in Mullica Hill at the age of 87. He was born on September 5, 1935 to the late John and Myrtle Brooks (nee Hoskins) in Camden. John worked as a factory worker for Riverside Metals for many years. He loved Phillies baseball, old country music, and even played guitar in a country band.\n\nJohn is predeceased by his wife Ruth Brooks, his brothers Phillip, Clarence, Gilbert and William, as well as sisters Louise, Elva, Edna, and Margaret. He is survived and will be greatly missed by his daughters Eleanor “Nor Nor” Brooks and Diana Aber and her husband John as well as his siblings Harold, Helen, and Elizabeth, Dwayne, and John Jr. He will also be missed by many grandchildren and great grandchildren and his caregiver Bonnie.\n\nThe United States flag does not wave because the wind blew past it. The United States flag flies from the last breath of each American soldier who died protecting it. John proudly served in the United States Army, fighting to uphold the American ideals of freedom from 1954 to 1956.\n\nRelatives, friends, and fellow musicians are invited to join John’s family on Tuesday between 10:30am and 12:30pm at Creran Celebration: Etherington & Creran Funeral Homes 700 Powell Street, Gloucester City with a Remembrance Ceremony to begin at 12:30pm. We will take leave from John at Brigadier General William C. Doyle Veterans Memorial Cemetery, 350 Provinceline Road, Wrightstown, NJ 08562.
