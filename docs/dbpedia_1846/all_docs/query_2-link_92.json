        "text": "Philip Ellerker Ross (1899-1977) (WL/18/63)\n\nPhilip was born in Beverley on the 26 July 1899 and was baptised at St Mary's Church on the 3 September 1899. He was the son of Harry E Ross, a journalist on the Beverley Guardian newspaper, and his wife Eva (n√©e Welburn), who married in 1893 and lived at 101 Grovehill Road, Beverley.\n\nPhilip joined the Merchant Navy early in the war. In June 1916, in the Mediterranean, his ship SS Olive was torpedoed. All of the crew survived. The Beverley Guardian of 28 April 1917 reported that Philip's unnamed merchant ship had been torpedoed by a U-boat in the Atlantic and he had had to spend three days in an open lifeboat before being landed at Liverpool. He was then given a temporary commission in the Royal Naval Voluntary Reserve and was gazetted on 18 January 1918. Philip served in the Mediterranean and was given Second-Command of a 'submarine chaser' in the eastern Mediterranean. In late 1918 after the end of the war, Philip's vessel was sent as part of the Danube Flotilla to the Black Sea via Constantinople and the Bosphorous, and then on to Sulina in Rumania (Romania) where his vessel entered the River Danube to undertake minesweeping duties. Having cleared the mines Philip continued up the river as far as Belgrade in Serbia, arriving on 5 January 1919. He said in a report in the Beverley Guardian of 18 January 1919 that 'we are going up the river to show the flag and cheer them up a little'. The river froze and the crew were billeted in Belgrade for the rest of the winter. Philip left the service in 1920 and was awarded the War and Victory Medals.\n\nAfter the war Philip went to work in industry, reaching the position of director in a manufacturing company in Huddersfield by 1925. On the 2 September 1925, he married Mabel Alice Gabbetis at St Mary's Church, Beverley, daughter of a farmer in Etton and then living at 176 Norwood. They moved to Huddersfield and had two children. They later lived in the Stockport area where Philip died on 11 January 1977. Mabel died in 1982.\n\nJohn Chew may be one of the men in the photograph of Beverley members of the East Yorkshire Cyclists battalion heading to war via Wednesday Market, Beverley. 5th August 1914 (image courtesy of Peter Bonner).\n\nGraffiti in the southwest tower of Beverley Minster tells us that John Chew was the 'first lad in Beverley to go war...August 5th 1914'. The fact that he was on active service is corroborated in the Beverley Recorder on 31 October 1914 which lists all those local men who had gone off to war.\n\nJohn was a private in the 5th (Cyclist) Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the territorial force. He was in 'F Coy', based in Beverley at the Drill Hall, Grayburn Lane, shared with the territorials of the 5th Yorkshire Regiment. The war commenced on the evening of Tuesday 4 August 1914 and members of the Cyclist Battalion were summoned to the county headquarters at Park Street in Hull on Wednesday 5 August. It would seem that John and some other local men went off to war on this date. From Hull, they were transported to Louth in Lincolnshire and patrolled the coast on their bicycles from south of Grimsby as far as Skegness in all weathers in 8 to 9-hour shifts looking out to sea for the enemy. In May 1915 they were moved northward to Withernsea and then Roos, and patrolled the East Yorkshire coast. Later in 1916, it seems that they moved to the Northumberland Coast at Newbiggin. John signed up for the cyclists in June 1913 and was a reservist in the 2nd Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment from 1898 to 1906. His duties took their toll and on 30 September 1917 John was discharged; problems with his feet meant he was considered unfit for further service. He was given a pension and a Silver War Badge but as he had not left the UK on active service was not eligible for other medals.\n\nJohn worked as a cleaner at the Post Office in Beverley. He had earlier been a coachbuilder and a labourer. He was born in Beverley on 11 April 1880 and was baptised at Beverley Minster on the 3 June 1880, the son of George Chew and Mary (n√©e Hyde). George was from Wetwang and Mary was from Garton; they married in Driffield in 1869.\n\nJohn lived at 20 Princes Gardens, Well Lane, Beverley. On the 20 November 1904, he married Lizzie Lawtry at Beverley Minster and they had five children. After war service, John became an auxiliary postman. In 1939 the family was living on the corner of Lord Robert's Road and Wednesday Market at the YMCA. John died in 1953 and was buried in Queensgate Cemetery on 19 October 1953."
