        "text": "--\n\nThe Figo Affair: The Transfer that Changed Football (2022) It’s vastly entertaining, taking you into the very murky world of big-money, dubious businessmen and even more dubious agents who represent soccer stars. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 04, 2022\n\n99%\n\nNothing Compares (2022) Her story is extraordinary, from a bleak childhood to early stardom to enormous controversy. Raw and poignant, it’s about O’Connor’s amazing voice and the trouble it caused. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 30, 2022\n\n80%\n\nWild Card: The Downfall of a Radio Loudmouth (2020) A solid documentary about Craig Carton... A study of male ego and hidden demons. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Aug 05, 2022\n\n--\n\n700 Sundays (2014) It’s nostalgic and very personal and aimed at an audience equipped to remember the period Crystal is nostalgic about, but his personal investment in it all transcends nostalgia. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jul 22, 2022\n\n--\n\nCristela Alonzo: Middle Classy (2022) It’s a relaxed comedy set, unlikely to alienate anyone but certain to make a lot of people smile. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jul 21, 2022\n\n67%\n\nBill Burr: Live at Red Rocks (2022) His temper has cooled and he’s aiming to be reasonable and open-minded, while aware that some of his audience don’t want to go there with him. He’s transcended something that others can’t. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jul 21, 2022\n\n100%\n\nScarborough (2021) It’s a love letter but bittersweet, directed by Shasha Nakhai and Rich Williamson. It sure pulses with life. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jul 05, 2022\n\n--\n\nFanatyk (2017) This 33-minute gem is a small masterpiece of dark comedy. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted May 23, 2022\n\n100%\n\nBedlam (2019) The film has remarkable access and, throughout, Rosenberg weaves in the story of what happened to his sister, a woman who had schizophrenia. Not easy viewing, but very powerful. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted May 13, 2022\n\n97%\n\nNavalny (2022) It is more chilling and absorbing than any spy fiction, because it’s all real, and ominous, too. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 22, 2022\n\n66%\n\nWhite Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch (2022) As anyone who studies fashion knows, there is so much to extrapolate from the arena. And there is a vast amount to learn here. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 21, 2022\n\n100%\n\nWriting with Fire (2021) Everyone involved is aware of the hostility they face, and their energy and fortitude is astonishing. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 01, 2022\n\n100%\n\nAdrienne (2021) The doc is made by her husband, Andy Ostroy, and it is a glowing tribute, an act of grieving. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 18, 2022\n\n--\n\nCatherine Cohen: The Twist...? She's Gorgeous. (2022) You need an appreciation for theatricality to really savour the material and the tone, which tends toward the filthy. For others, it might be unclear if Cohen is mocking herself, or engaging in performance as therapy. A star on the rise, mind you. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 16, 2022\n\n94%\n\nLucy and Desi (2022) It is the definition of hagiography, being a loving tribute, mainly to Ball, but there is great energy in the copious amount of private footage of the couple. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 04, 2022\n\n97%\n\nThe Tinder Swindler (2022) It is tighter and more focused than many true crime documentaries on Netflix, a crisply done account of how a guy manipulated and exploited three women on Tinder. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 17, 2022\n\n70%\n\nFalling for Figaro (2020) An adorable comedy, the romance is in part about being in love with opera. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 14, 2022\n\n80%\n\nAziz Ansari: Nightclub Comedian (2022) The special, just 30 minutes long, is bracing in its skepticism and hard-shelled, morbidly funny about the mess we're all in now. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 27, 2022\n\n100%\n\nFanny: The Right to Rock (2021) A terrific and eye-opening documentary and an amendment to misconceptions. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 18, 2022\n\n--\n\nPortrayal (2020) It's a fabulous story about coming to terms with what our forefathers did and why they did it. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 07, 2022\n\n100%\n\nThe Gig is Up (2021) A disturbing look at the gig economy on four continents. It's a punchy and anger-inciting doc by Shannon Walsh - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Dec 04, 2021\n\n60%\n\nPharma Bro (2021) There isn't enough in the film about the issue of drug pricing - but it says enough to underline the difference between us here in Canada, and our neighbours to the south. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 29, 2021\n\n--\n\nMeet Beau Dick: Maker of Monsters (2017) His work as a master carver is stunning, his life was full of strange turns, and his wit and storytelling come alive in this program. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 19, 2021\n\n--\n\nFight to the Finish (2020) The power and beauty of the special (made by Barry Stevens) is its plain, uncluttered style. Made with naturalistic verve, it allows more than 50 Canadian veterans to share their memories and thoughts. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 11, 2021\n\n96%\n\nThe Dissident (2020) It unfolds like a well-told thriller and is absolutely damning in its portrait of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Not an easy watch, but a searing look at what led to the grisly murder of Khashoggi at his country's consulate in Turkey. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 05, 2021\n\n--\n\nFour Seasons Total Documentary (2021) Four Seasons Total Documentary is an absolute blast, a must-see, and a reminder of one of the more chaotic, bizarre events of the last days of the Trump presidency. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 05, 2021\n\n60%\n\nSex: Unzipped (2021) It might be the absolute worst, most terrifyingly crude and cringe-inducing thing Netflix has ever unleashed. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 01, 2021\n\n89%\n\nFour Hours at the Capitol (2021) The filmmakers will be criticized by some for giving oxygen to such views but the film's point is clear -- the strange calm of the advocates for violence is presented alongside footage of the barbaric fighting, as a subversion of their serenity. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 20, 2021\n\n82%\n\n15 Minutes of Shame (2021) It's a fascinating, even-handed look at the phenomenon, how some people are deservedly shamed for their actions and how others, innocent of any wrongdoing, have had their lives destroyed. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 08, 2021\n\n12%\n\nDiana: The Musical (2021) The cringe-inducing vulgarity of it all goes on and on. Merrily so, which is very odd, because Diana died an early death in a horrific car crash. Where's the fun in that? - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2021\n\n100%\n\nRebels on Pointe (2017) It's a charming and shrewd take on the male ballerinas of the legendary Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, part performance documentary and part portrait of the performers and the company. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 02, 2021\n\n--\n\nYou Are Here: A Come From Away Story (2018) It's an exquisite film, grave but often droll, and a timely reminder that the solace of kindness exists even in the most painful, frightening circumstances. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 13, 2021\n\n--\n\nSurviving 9/11 (2021) A remarkably powerful work. Unfussy and plain, it is unfailingly gripping by simply letting people speak about what happened to them that day. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 13, 2021\n\n93%\n\nLandfall (2020) This beautifully made doc is not about victimhood; it's a celebration of community and resourcefulness. Highly recommended. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jul 15, 2021\n\n60%\n\nBaggio: The Divine Ponytail (2021) There will never be a player with the same aura, and the film acts a perfect reintroduction (even for non-soccer fans) to the cauldron and complexity of European soccer. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 08, 2021\n\n97%\n\nThe Donut King (2020) A fine if erratic documentary anchored in a food-business phenomenon. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 01, 2021\n\n72%\n\nOslo (2021) Ruth Wilson in particular embodies a plaintiveness that's heart-wrenching. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 01, 2021\n\n67%\n\nFriends: The Reunion (2021) Friends: The Reunion has a few amusing moments but it's aimed at adoring fans who want a sentimental, unthinking journey. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 01, 2021\n\n--\n\nGenius Factory (2017) It's a terrific story, actually (made by Canadian Daryl Stoneage) and has more twists and turns than most good thrillers. Eventually, it's poignant. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted May 13, 2021\n\n--\n\nThe Trader (2018) A work of astonishing beauty, it has a genteel quietism that hides a heartrending power. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 28, 2021\n\n94%\n\nTwo Distant Strangers (2020) Unsubtle but beautifully done, this 32-minute drama sticks with you more than most nominated full-length movies. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Apr 28, 2021\n\n--\n\nExtinction: The Facts (2020) Extinction: The Facts is one of the most terrifying programs of the year. And not because there are scenes of animals being slaughtered. Rather, it's the pervading sense of dread. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 31, 2021\n\n92%\n\nTina (2021) The film is packed with archival footage of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue and puts the work in a music context. It also allows Turner herself to talk about being trapped in a life story that, publicly, is dominated by her escape from Ike. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 26, 2021\n\n70%\n\nSentinelle (2021) A lacerating revenge-thriller... There is no warmth or wit in Sentinelle; it's an exercise in unsubtle retributive justice. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 24, 2021\n\n84%\n\nPelé (2021) Pelé is a terrific examination of the player, the man, and his status in recent Brazilian history. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 24, 2021\n\n73%\n\nFake Famous (2021) Following the story of the dare is a gravely funny and bittersweet experience. Revealing, too. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 04, 2021\n\n90%\n\nTheir Finest (2016) There's a sweet love story and some wonderful work by an array of British actors. My heavens, this is charming, rib-tickling escapism. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 27, 2021\n\n78%\n\nSummerland (2020) Made with great panache, this is a real gem of understated poignancy; about summers as lovely as they are fraught. - Globe and Mail\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 14, 2021"
