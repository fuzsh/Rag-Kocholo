        "text": "This satire records a comic incident experienced by Lord Chancellor Brougham in 1834 while he was making a speaking tour. At Fareham in Hampshire members of a local philosophical institution had planned to compliment him with a prepared address but were prevented by Brougham's unexpectedly quick departure. Determinedly, they followed him to the Isle of Wight and persuaded the innkeeper at Shanklin that they were important visitors. Since the chancellor had left word that urgent messengers should be admitted (thinking he might be contacted by George IVg), the gentlemen from Fareham were shown to his room. Doyle's image conveys the self importance of the three Hampshire philosophers, perplexed demeanor of the innkeeper, and Brougham's annoyed surprise."
