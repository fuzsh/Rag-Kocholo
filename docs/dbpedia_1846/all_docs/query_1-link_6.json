        "text": "After 10 years on the Princeton Program in Theater faculty, Tony Award-winning Broadway theater director John Doyle concludes his final semester in December. On Monday, December 4, Professor of Theater Stacy Wolf will interview Doyle about his work and his Princeton legacy.\n\nDoyle is perhaps best known for his groundbreaking productions of Stephen Sondheim’s musicals, completely reimagining Sweeney Todd, Pacific Overtures, Assassins, and more. Doyle’s technique of actor-musicianship and his minimalist aesthetic, combined with his deeply human and astute dramaturgy, revived and revivified Sondheim’s shows in profound ways. Doyle’s work changed how artists, audiences, critics, and scholars understand Sondheim’s musicals. Doyle has taught and advised many Princeton students, shaping their approaches to new and classic works.\n\nTickets & Details\n\nThe conversation is free & open to the public; no tickets or registration required.\n\nDirections\n\nGet directions to the Godfrey Kerr Studio, located on the second level of the Wallace Dance Building at the Lewis Arts complex.\n\nAccessibility"
