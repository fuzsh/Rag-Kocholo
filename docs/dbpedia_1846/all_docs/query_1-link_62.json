There were many boys and young men that were led by him through the many years he coached baseball, football for 5th-7th graders, and went on to head up the Bannock Boys Baseball for a number of years. He was a VFW member and the American Legion.\n\nGene is survived by his wife of 46 years, Louise Doyle, Pocatello, ID; a son, Aaron (Diane) Doyle, Idaho Falls, ID; a grandson, Abel Doyle and sister Carol Woo of Fair Oaks, CA. He was preceded in death by his parents, Wayne and Verna Doyle and step-father George Saner.\n\nFuneral services for Gene will be held at 2PM, Friday, January 13, 2017, at Wilks Funeral Home, 211 W. Chubbuck Road, with Military Rites provided by the Pocatello Veterans Honor Guard. A viewing will be held from 5-7:00 PM, Thursday January 12th and one hour prior to the services at the funeral home.\n\nMemories and condolences may be shared with his family under the \"Share a Memory\" tab on this page. His family wishes to express their deepest gratitude to the hospice staff at Access Home Health and Hospice. We couldn't have done this latest journey without your support and wonderful staff. We especially thank Kristen and Michelle for taking such wonderful care of Gene."
