        "text": "Tim was a beloved husband, father, ‘pappy’, son, brother, uncle, and friend to many. He was humble and courageous. He was softhearted and strong. He had an infectious, joyous spirit that flooded each encounter in his life.\n\nHe spent most of his life serving and protecting others in many ways. Starting as a firefighter with the United States Air Force, then as a Chief Warrant Officer and helicopter pilot in the US Army, as a mounted and patrol officer for The City of Cincinnati Police Department, and lastly as the chief helicopter pilot for the Hamilton County Sheriff Department.\n\nOutside of his career he loved flying, vacationing, music (karaoke!), golf, and spending time with his dear friends. But most importantly to him, he adored his family and loved being with them.\n\nHis daughters, Ashley, Sarah, and Molli, and granddaughters, Noli and Willa, were his pride and joy. Along with his wife, Nancy, he proudly watched as his daughters grew into the beautiful, confident, successful woman they are today. And his grandbabies! ‘Pappy’ was wrapped around their little fingers from the moment they were born.\n\nHis mother, sisters, sisters-in-law, and nieces helped him navigate his “girl dad’ life, and he was a better man for it. But surrounded by all those women, his brother, brothers-in-law, and nephews became his lifeline, they made him laugh and brought him so much joy.\n\nAnd oh, how he loved his friends, he traveled, golfed, laughed, and just enjoyed being with them. From crazy nights with the neighborhood gang, to all the adventures with longtime friends, and the new friends he met along the way, Tim lived his life to the fullest. There are many sad, empty hearts missing their friend.\n\nAnd through it all his wife, Nancy, was by his side, sharing in the adventures, blessed to be part of the joy and the love that was Tim Doyle.\n\nHe touched so many lives and will be deeply missed by all those who loved him. He will always be in our hearts as we have been in his.\n\nTimothy C. Doyle passed suddenly and very unexpectedly at the age of 58. Tim was born on November 6, 1963 to Howard ‘Jeep’ Doyle and Marian (née Wallot) Doyle. He was raised in Mt Adams and attended Purcell High School. After graduating, he spent two years as a firefighter in the US Air Force, then eight years as a Cobra helicopter Pilot (Banshee 28) with the Air Cavalry unit of the 101st Airborne in the US Army.\n\nHe owned Ogden’s Bar in downtown Cincinnati for three years, then went on to serve the City of Cincinnati Police Department for 13 years (Jan 1997-June 2010), and the Hamilton County Sheriff Department for eight years until his retirement in 2018.\n\nTim was preceded in death by his father: Howard Doyle; and sister: Teresa Elder.\n\nTim is survived by his beloved wife: Nancy (Meyer) Doyle; precious daughters: Ashley (Chris) Greer, Sarah (Kyle Seibert) Doyle, and Molli (Michael Thompson) Doyle; and cherished granddaughters: Magnolia (“Noli”) Greer, Willa Doyle, Maleah and Selena Greer. He is also survived by his devoted mother: Marian Doyle; sisters: Nancy (Rudy) Riesenbeck, Janet (Michael) Stiens; brother: Chris Doyle, and numerous nieces, nephews, and in laws.\n\nVisitation will be held on Monday, July 11, 2022, from 5 to 8 pm at Radel Funeral Home, 650 Neeb Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45233. Mass of Christian Burial will be held on Tuesday, July 12, 2022, at 10:00 am at St. Teresa of Avila, 1175 Overlook Ave, Cincinnati, Ohio 45238. Burial will be at New St Joseph Cemetery, 4500 Foley Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45238 (Covedale Gardens).\n\nMemorials may be made to: Purcell Marion High School (2935 Hackberry St, Cincinnati, OH 45206), the James & Evelyn Meyer Scholarship Fund at Seton High School (3901 Glenway Ave Cincinnati, OH 45205), the David C Pavey Scholarship Fund at Elder High School (3900 Vincent Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45205), or Bayley Place (990 Bayley Dr Cincinnati, OH 45233)."
