        "text": "Contemporaries and historians of the Russian revolutions have often made a great deal of the Jewish role in the events of 1917. In late 1917, for instance, it was commonplace to assert that the Bolsheviks were simply part of a Jewish conspiracy. This paper takes a look at the various Russian perspectives on the revolution and its Jewish aspects, focusing in particular on the views of leading intellectuals, writers and politicians, such as S.M. Dubnov, Maxim Gorkii and Aleksandr Blok. It reveals that attitudes were not always straightforward, even amongst the liberal elements of the intelligentsia.\n\nPOWER CHANGED HANDS IN KIEV fourteen times during the revolution and civil war (1917–1920). Many of these changes of power were accompanied by anti-Jewish violence. The pogroms were committed by the Ukrainian and White armies, as well as the Polish occupation forces. I discuss in my book when and how this anti-Jewish violence began. Why were troops with such different ideologies so similar in their hatred of Jews and their justification for Jewish pogroms? Why could the large Kiev Jewish community not defend itself? What impact did the pogroms have on the Jewish population and on their perpetrators? My work also raises important questions of the responsibility of the civil and military authorities for Jewish pogroms in Kiev and Ukraine during the civil war. It rebuts the theory that these pogroms occurred spontaneously and could not have been prevented, demonstrating that most of them were the result of antisemitic propaganda spread by official mass media as well as the deliberate exploitation of antisemitism for political purposes by various political forces during the civil war.\n\nThis article explores the subject of Jewish aid work in the former Russian Empire Russian Civil War. It considers responses of Jews to the civil war pogroms in the context of Russia’s “continuum of crisis,” or nearly eight continuous years of military conflict and political instability from 1914 to 1921. It argues that Jewish aid organizations during the Russian Civil War relied on people, institutions, and practices established by their predecessors during the First World War. Jewish aid workers during the Russian Civil War looked to their immediate past as they developed tactics and strategies to navigate a period of political chaos and mass violence."
