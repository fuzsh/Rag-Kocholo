        "text": "John Doyle\n\nDepartment of Mathematics\n\nDr. John Doyle joined the Oklahoma State University faculty in fall 2020 as an assistant professor of mathematics.\n\n\"I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Georgia in 2014, then held a postdoctoral position at the University of Rochester and a tenure-track position at Louisiana Tech University before arriving at OSU. My research is generally in the field of number theory, and my research in this area has led to roughly 20 publications and funding from the National Science Foundation.\n\nNumber theory is the study of properties of number systems like the whole numbers, integers, or rational numbers. Things like prime numbers and perfect squares fall into the category of number theory. I was drawn to study number theory for a couple of reasons. Number theory is one of the oldest disciplines in all of mathematics. People were studying it more than 2,000 years ago; for example, the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid was the first person to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Many problems in number theory, though challenging to solve, are relatively simple to state. Are there infinitely many pairs of \"twin primes\" -- prime numbers that differ by two, like 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19, etc.? It's a simple enough question to ask, but we still donâ€™t know the answer.\n\nMy specific research area is arithmetic dynamics, which is a mix of number theory and dynamical systems. \"Dynamical systems\" can mean a few different things, but in this context it essentially refers to \"iterative processes\". As an example, take a standard five-function calculator, enter any positive number, then press the square root button. Press it again. And again. The repeated application of the square root function is an example of a dynamical system. (If you do this long enough, the calculator will eventually show 1; in dynamical terminology, 1 is an attracting fixed point for the square root function.)"
