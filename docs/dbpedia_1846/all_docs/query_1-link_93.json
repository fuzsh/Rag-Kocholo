Absolutely fabulous day out with the family. We had teenagers and a 9 year old with us and there was so much to do. Everyone was entertained amd this place suites ages from 1-100!

Such a great day out, took my two boys (4-7) at the time. This is a full day out, lots to see and do. The setup of the place is brilliant and easy to navigate. The sheer size of the entire exhibition blew me away, it just kept going and going! Will definitely go back again in a few years when the kids are a bit older to appreciate it all over again. 10/10 day out with the kids!\n\nread moreread less\n\nALEXHORDER\n\nI loved it Absolutely amazing, don’t really have a bad word to say. There was something to do for everyone, quite well priced. Incredibly informative but didn’t bombard you with it. Great for all ages. It turns out the tickets get you in for a full year which is great. Some of the bits about concentration camps brought a tear to my eye. It was incredibly well done.\n\nread moreread less\n\nkeelyshenton5\n\nBest day out. A very warm welcome from the staff. Everything was well laid out. The information boards were full of information. It literally is a whole day out, so it's great value for money.\n\nread moreread less\n\nGemma B\n\nAbsolutely fantastic! A must do day out Absolutely fantastic day out.

There is everything for adults, teens and young children to do. A fabulous day out, well worth it! Will definitely be back.\n\nread moreread less\n\nThe_Pilot_Wife\n\nFAMILY DAY OUT This was by far the best day out during our recent holiday. We went on the local bus from Weymouth. A lovely drive through the country on a lovely summers day. We arrived at the Tank Museum with a complete open mind - we knew there would be hundreds of tanks but the whole experience was moving, emotional and thoroughly entertaining. The history and effects were brilliant and I would definitely recommend this as a must see if you are heading down to Poole, Bournemeouth or Weymouth are.\n\nread moreread less\n\namaturediner\n\nInformative and absorbing First went to the Tank Museum in the late 50's on a school trip. A post war boys dream a giant hanger full of tanks you could crawl all over ( pre health & safety.) Later visits through the years normally as a result of rain at Weymouth have seen the museum evolve into the first class museum you can see today. You journey through the history of the Tank through time, illustrated by the actual vehicles of the period. I particularly enjoyed the individual video's about and made by the men who served. Light and airy you can take your time and not be overwhelmed by the exhibits as in the past. Would certainly return using the year ticket. Reasonably priced online tickets, plenty of parking. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable. The only downside was the restaurant , crowded service area.\n\nread moreread less\n\nRichard J\n\nAn amazing day out.
