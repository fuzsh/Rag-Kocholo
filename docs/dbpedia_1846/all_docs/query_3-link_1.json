Doyle was born in Dublin in 1797 and died in London in 1868. He first studied under the Italian landscape painter, Gabrielli, then with Comerford, a miniature painter, at the Academy of Drawing in Dublin. He began his career in London as a portrait painter about 1821, but without success. About 1827 or 1828, he began drawing caricatures of political figures of the day, signing his work \"HB,\" made up of two pairs of his initials \"JD\" placed one above the other. Until the end of his life, few people were aware of Doyle's identity. From 1829 to 1851, he created his famous series of caricatures documenting all of the political movements of his era. These caricatures were published in The Times of London. Figures included members of Parliament, the Duke of Wellington, the Duke of York, and others. His caricatures were never mean-spirited. They were clever, sometimes biting, yet generally marked by courtesy and gentility. There are 600 of Doyle's graphic works in the Print Room of the British Museum. He retired from his professional work seventeen years before his death. His son, Richard Doyle (1824-1883), was also a caricaturist. Another son, Charles, was the father of the writer, Arthur Conan Doyle, so John Doyle was the grandfather of the man who created the famous character, Sherlock Holmes.[3]\n\nNotes"
