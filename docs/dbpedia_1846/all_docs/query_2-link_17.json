        "text": "In February 1917, mob violence erupted in Murray, Kentucky, during the trial of Lube Martin who was accused of killing policeman, Guthrie Duiguid. The mob threatened to lynch Martin and then threatened the life of Circuit Judge Charles Bush and Commonwealth Attorney Denny Smith. Governor Stanley made a hurried trip to the scene to use this personal influence to avert any further violence. The Governor had no National Guard to call to take control of the situation. The governor was able to make a stand against the mob and stop additional violence. Following the event at Murray, Governor Stanley felt he needed at least part of the National Guard returned from the border, in case of additional trouble at Murray or elsewhere in the State. The governor contacted the War Department and requested three of the Kentucky National Guard companies be returned to the State, to assist in restoring and keeping order during the Martin trial. Three companies were released from Federal service and returned to the State. Once the units arrived, Company D, Third Kentucky Regiment, Hopkinsville, was ordered to Murray. The trial of Lube Martin proceeded with no further incidents.\n\nIn July 1917, strikes in the coal fields of Western Kentucky, turned to violence, requiring Governor Stanley to activate Company A, Signal Corps, Kentucky National Guard, Lexington, to Clay and Webster Counties, to restore order and protect the citizens and their property. This was just prior to the August 5th Federal activation of the entire Kentucky National Guard being sent to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, for service in the First World War.\n\nThe United States declared war against the Imperial German Government on April 6, 1917, once again, Kentucky would be without the protection and service of the Kentucky National Guard. As the National Guard units left Kentucky, local and State officials were concerned about the possibility of a reoccurrence of incidents such as what had just recently occurred in Western Kentucky. In response to that fear communities across the State were beginning to organize hometown units for self-protection.\n\nThe Federal Government enacted the Home Guard Act in 1917, which enable units to be organized in the States as part pf the National Army, their mission was to protect the wartime infrastructure of the United States.\n\nIn the latter months of 1917, Governor A. O. Stanley and James Tandy Ellis, The Adjutant General began developing on a plan to protect the State and her citizens while the Kentucky National Guard was in Federal service. On March 26, 1918, Kentucky enacted legislation allowing for the State to maintain troops other than the National Guard, the name given this new organization was the Kentucky State Guard. The name harked back to the State’s Militia organization prior to the Civil War and then again in the late 19th Century up to 1912, when the name changed to the Kentucky National Guard.\n\nThe new State Guard was to be composed of four companies of 75 men each, and no more than 500 at a given time. Its mission, to serve and protect the citizens and property of Kentucky. An initial appropriation of $20,000 for organizing the Guard was made, with an additional appropriation of $15,000 annually for three years for the maintenance of the organization. It was to continue in the service of the State during the duration of the war and one year thereafter. Companies were organized at Louisville, Company A; Paducah, Company B; Lexington, Company C; and Covington, Company D.\n\nAll the men were between the ages of 18 and 45 years, were citizens of Kentucky, and had to be able to read, write and speak the English language. They were enlisted for a term of three years. Men in the deferred classification of the draft could also be enlisted with the understanding that if called they would be discharged by the Governor from the State Guard. Many of the men, especially the officers had had prior military service and training, either in active service or the National Guard.\n\nThere is always one exception to the rules, William “Billy” Bernard O’Neal, age five was appointed the “Mascot” of Company D. He was presented a silver medal, inscribed with his rank of mascot, by Captain Louis V. Crockett. Billy attended and participated in meetings, drills, and camps of the company. During the inauguration at Frankfort in December 1919, Brigadier General James M. DeWeese, spotted young Billy with the men of Company D and asked, “Who is that stern young soldier?” when he learned he was their mascot, the General then appointed him a Colonel, and later mailed him his silver eagles to wear on his uniform.\n\nEach man in the State Guard was issued one overcoat, one khaki shirt, one pair of khaki trousers and a regulation army hat. State Guards were recognized by their green and white hat cords. In addition to the various parts of the uniform issued the men, the Quartermaster issued them blankets and rubber ponchos. The men had to furnish their shoes, which were to be of a standard army style. Enlisted men wore their rank on their sleeves, officers wore the insignia of rank of the sleeves instead of on the collar as in the Regular Army.\n\nEach community had to provide an adequate armory for the storage of weapons (older model Springfield rifles and M1911 pistols), ammunition and additional field equipment for their hometown company.\n\nWhile Brigadier General James Tandy Ellis was attempting to establish units of the State Guard, his attention was drawn to the fact that communities across the State were organizing and arming their own local military units with shotguns and various other weapons. He feared that these individuals had the best intentions, but he drew their attention to the State law prohibiting such activity. Through newspaper articles and notices the General was finally able to put a stop this unlaw activity.\n\nSection 136, of the Act of 1916, which makes it “unlawful for anybody of men, other than the regular organized militia or troops of the United States to associate themselves together as a military company or other armed organization or to drill or parade with arms anywhere within the State without license of the Governor thereof.”\n\nBefore the first company of the State Guard could be organized trouble started in the oil fields in Lee County. Governor A. O. Stanley was called upon to provide troops to put down disorder in the region. With no State troops available, the Governor quickly requested assistance from the Federal Government, however, when word got out that troops would be coming, the mob activity stopped.\n\nOn May 8, 1918, Company A, at Louisville, was mustered-into State service as part of the Kentucky State Guard. The following day at Paducah, Company B, was mustered-into service. Company C, at Lexington, was mustered on May 23, 1918, followed by Company D, at Covington, on August 6, 1918. The final unit of the State Guard was a Machine Gun Detachment organized at Leitchfield on February 12, 1920.\n\nDuring its existence, the Kentucky State Guard not only provided much needed protection and security for the Commonwealth, but preformed in numerous ceremonies, parades, and military funerals. They participated and performed at various war-time fund raising events in their communities. Companies held dances at their armories to raise funds to pay for any additional expenditures the company might incur, such as additional food, additional equipment, and encampments.\n\nThe companies normally met at their armories twice a week in the evening hours for drill and classroom work.\n\nThe Kentucky State Guard attempted one state sanctioned encampment. It was to be held in late August 1919. At the time, it was felt bringing all the units together at one location would assist in building the nucleus for the organization of the post-war Kentucky National Guard. Approval to use Camp Zachary Taylor in Louisville had been granted by the War Department, but for various reasons the decision was finally made that each company would hold its own encampment. The Kentucky State Guard never came together for one state encampment. For the 1919 encampment the State paid the Guardsmen while in camp, as well as covering all camp expenses. The men received the following pay:\n\nPrivates, $1.50 per day.\n\nCook and Sergeants (including Supply Sergeant), $2.00 per day.\n\nColor Sergeant/First Sergeant, $2.50 per day.\n\nFirst Lieutenant, $4.50 per day.\n\nSecond Lieutenant, $4.00 per day.\n\nCaptain, $5.00 per day.\n\nBelow are the dates and location for the 1919 encampments:\n\nCompany A, Camp Zachary Taylor, August 23-30. Company B, Dawson Springs, August 23-30. Company C, Fort Boonesboro, August 24-31. Company D, Spring Lake, August 25 to September 1.\n\nOn September 14, 1918, Company C, at Lexington would become the first unit to be order to active service, participating in the funeral of Kentucky Senator Joseph C. S. Blackburn. Company B, at Paducah went on active service to protect prisoner Gus Nolan in the McCracken County jail, however, there is no special order issued for this duty and all local officials claimed that they had not requested the assistance of the Guard. After two days, it was apparent there was no plan to lynch Nolan, Captain Gladstone Burns dismissed his soldiers.\n\nOn November 11, 1918, the First World War came to an end. It was hoped that soon the Kentucky National Guard would be marching home and once again take over its pre-war duties, or so it was assumed. Confusion arose over whether or not the Kentucky National Guard would automatically resume its pre-war function with its members just returning from Federal service, or that a totally new National Guard organization would take its place, and that of the State Guard.\n\nGovernor James D. Black in a proclamation dated June 24, 1919, declared that the Kentucky National Guard still exists and those soldiers who were mustered into the National Army automatically go back into the Guard when they are mustered out of the federal service. The Governor held the opinion that only he could discharge them from the Guard. Additionally, he stated, “that any man who fails to approve in writing such continuance of his status shall be automatically dropped from the Guard” and “that no officer or man who was drafted into the Army of the United States shall be permanently retained in the service of the National Guard of the State contrary to his will.” The Kentucky National Guard was re-established. However, it would be many months before it was completely re-organized and properly functioning. Until them elements of the Kentucky State Guard were still actively involved in the State.\n\nNewspapers across the State report that the sons of Kentucky had come marching home with glory and poor old dad was still in “Dutch,” facing two more years of weekly drills, etc. The Government was “not going to let him out. He is not going to be discharged, unless he loses a leg or can prove to the disability board that he is blind in one eye and has a weak back.” A new policy of strictness against “ditching” drill was announced. Members were warned to attend drill. If they failed, investigations and possible court martial would ensue, if convicted dad would be dishonorably discharged, he forfeited his right of citizenship. He would never be able to vote again. “Dad had better have a gilt-edged alibi to fool Uncle Samuel.”\n\nOn July 14, 1919, Company D at Covington received an emergency call to duty. The following is the local newspaper account of what occurred:\n\nTO ARMS!\n\nVisions of Horror Rise\n\nAs Kentucky Guards Hasten to Scene of “Lynching.”\n\nEfficiency is Demonstrated, But it’s a Long Way to Winston Hill on a Night in July.\n\nCame the sharp, clear call to arms of the burgle, breaking in upon the weekly drill of the Kentucky State Guard at the Latonia Barracks. Inside all is hurried, but orderly confusion. From mouth to mouth it is explained that a long-distance telephone message from Adjutant General Tandy Ellis at Frankfort reports the body of a man hanging from a telegraph pole at the top of Winston Hill five miles away.\n\nEighty-five members of the guard fall in at attention. “Squads right, march; double time, march!” come from the crisp commands of Captain L. V. Crockett.\n\nThe men break from a hurried shamble into a steady jog. One mile, two miles, three miles are gone. The guards are growing weary, but in their excited minds they picture the figure of the gruesome object dangling from the pole.\n\nHas Kentucky mob spirit, so long docile, reasserted itself. Has a victim paid for a dastardly crime with his life? Did the crime warrant the summary action? Who comprised the mob? Were their friends, their neighbors, mayhap their sons and brothers, participants? Will they be forced to pursue them?\n\nThese questions and a hundred other race through their brains like wildfire as their labored breathing brings them to the foot of Winston Hill. Another mile has passed, and almost another. They are on the last lap.\n\nOverhead a benign moon sends a flood of silvery light over the terrain for miles around. They can see the lonesome figure now, silhouetted in the moonlight, dangling from the cross-pieces of the pole. Beneath, the ground is spotted with red. Their worst fears are realized. Where is the mob?\n\nIn their excitement they break ranks and gather hurriedly around the figure. Who is the unfortunate? They look at the ground. Is that blood? A wrathful cry breaks from one of the members. They crowd forward to identify the victim. It is a dummy stuffed with sawdust.\n\nBack at the barracks, sweating, dusty. Tired, with a lurid string of language stretching behind them to the figure in the moonlight, it is explained the call was a test to determine the efficiency of the organization.\n\nSuch is war?\n\nIt was September 5, 1919, that Company B, at Paducah was the first company to be mustered-out of the State Guard, followed by Company A, Louisville, on October 24.\n\nBoth Company C and D were still active and were ordered on December 5, 1919, to participate in the inaugural ceremonies at Frankfort, on December 9, for Governor-elect Edwin P. Morrow.\n\nOne major event which occurred in the history of the State Guard came in February 1920. Company D of Covington was ordered to Frankfort on February 7, to escort prisoner Will Lockett, charged with murder, to the Fayette County Courthouse, to stand trial.\n\nThe day before the trial commenced, Adjutant General James DeWeese issued a warning to citizens of Fayette and adjoining counties against any demonstration at the trial in Lexington. He said:\n\n“The request to Gov. Morrow for state military force at the trial of Will locket, made by Judge Kerr, has been granted and ample forces will be present to aid the civil authorities in preserving order.\n\n“Warning is hereby given to all persons that any attempt by individuals or groups to obstruct the civil authorities in the performance of their duty or to penetrate the zone fired by the military authorities will be met with force.\n\n“Additional warning is given herewith that loitering or lingering about the approaches to the courthouse will place those persons in the danger zone should a resort to force be necessary. Individuals or groups will do this at their own peril.\n\n“The responsibility for any bloodshed at this trial will rest on those who disregard their duty as citizens and attempt to take the law out of the hands of the constituted authorities. It is confidently expected that the citizens of Fayette County will respect the law as administered by their own officials and citizens.”\n\nThe morning of February 9th an estimated 4,000 citizens surrounded the Fayette County Courthouse. The trial was to begin at 9 a. m. A shout came from the crowd, “Let’s get him,” and the mass moved towards the entrance of the courthouse, engaging policemen, deputy sheriffs and the Guardsmen in hand-to-combat. As the crowd pushed the guards to the doors of the courthouse, and after numerous commands to halt, the command, “fire” was given and following a number of volleys, the crowd finally fell back across the street. Five dead and numerous wounded were quickly removed. One of those wounded was Sergeant Elmer Moore of Company D.\n\nUpon hearing of the situation in Lexington, and fearing further violence, Governor Morrow requested Federal assistance and 400 soldiers from Camp Zachary Taylor, under the command of Brigadier General Francis C. Marshall was sent to the scene to assist and restore order. General Marshall immediately declared Martial Law for the City of Lexington. The Latonia Guards were stood down and relieved from State duty. A total of five persons were killed and twenty wounded including Guardsman Elmer Moore.\n\nIn a newspaper interview Brigadier General Marshall made the following comments concerning the actions of Brigadier General DeWeese:\n\nThe action of General DeWeese in opening fire on the crowd that tried to storm the Court House Monday was “Fine,”\n\nGeneral DeWeese faced an extremely difficult task and he handled it with credit.\n\nWhen the sober senses of Kentucky are brought to bear upon his action, it will be approved. General DeWeese is entitled to the highest credit.\n\nIn the days following the incident at Lexington, the men of Company D, were lauded for their actions in putting down the riot and upholding the law by the Governor, elected official and in the newspapers. However, there were threats made against some individuals. In an anonymous letter mailed from Cincinnati read: “Your time is coming soon, you low-lived murderer. You will be burned alive sooner or later. County Judge Bullock, Judge Charles Kerr, Capt. L. V. Crockett and also that man who calls himself Governor of Kentucky will be burned. Several men were killed in Lexington, so more will be killed hereafter.”\n\nFor a number of days additional security for those threated was maintained, but no action was taken against them.\n\nFollowing his trial and sentencing Will Lockett was moved to Eddyville Prison to await execution. February 12, 1920, Captain William Taylor, and the Machine Gun Detachment was ordered to Eddyville Prison to assist in guarding Will Lockett, prior to his execution.\n\nTowards the later part of February, a special grand jury was held to investigate the riot in Lexington. The final report released on February 27, held no one accountable for the actions of the crowd, the follow statement was made concerning the Kentucky State Guard:\n\nIn our investigations we have examined many witnesses and endeavored to ascertain as far as they could be identified those who engaged and indulged in inciting the crowd to violence by inflammatory speeches and actions, and particularly those who actually made an effort to force their way into the court house for the purpose of taking possession of the prisoner by overpowering the officers of the law and the soldiers of the State Guard, who were sent to the county by the Governor of the State to support the civil authorities in protecting the prisoner from violence and in upholding the law. . .\n\nWe believe that the Adjutant General and officers in charge of the State Guard and it soldiers, the Sheriff and his deputies and the policemen used every effort without resorting to the use of firearms until the last extremity to prevent the turbulent members of the crowd from forcing their way into the courthouse and over-powering the authorities for the purpose of taking possession of the prisoner and wreaking their vengeance upon him.\n\nThe evening before his execution, March 11, 1920, Will Lockett told reporters that he was satisfied that justice had been done and expressed appreciation to the soldiers who had saved him from the mob. He also thanked Captain Taylor, of the Leitchfield company, eight members of which had guarded the prison, and presented him with small testaments which he autographed with the words, “To remember me by.”\n\nFebruary 21, 1920, Troop A, 123rd Cavalry Regiment, Frankfort, under command of Captain James K. Dillion, became the first unit of the post-war Kentucky National Guard.\n\nDuring March and April 1920, “Night Rider” raids in the “Black Patch” tobacco region of Western Kentucky, required the assistance of the Machine Gun Detachment to restore order and protect citizens and property in Graves County.\n\nOn April 29, 1920, Company C, at Lexington, was mustered-out of the service of the Kentucky State Guard.\n\nIn May 1920, Company D, was located at Brooksville, Kentucky, to maintain peace during the trial of Thomas Marksberry, accused of murder.\n\nOn July 21, 1920, the Machine Gun Detachment was ordered to Springfield in Washington County, to protect prisoner, Robert Logan, accused of murder, during his trial.\n\nTroubles along the Kentucky-West Virginia border had been on-going for some time things erupted between the union and non-union coal miners in July 1920, necessitating a call for troops. In late July, Company D and the Machine Gun Detachment were activated to participate and restoring law and order to the area. This would be the last activation of the Kentucky State Guard. Soon after, the final two units of the State Guard were disbanded.\n\nBy the end of August 1920, the Kentucky State Guard ceased to exist, being replaced by the Kentucky National Guard. Many of the men who had served in the State Guard went on to continue to serve the citizens of the Commonwealth in the Kentucky National Guard.\n\nThanks to the laws enacted and the service provided by the Kentucky State Guard during the First World War, this state’s defense force got its beginning and began a process which has evolved over the years. At the beginning of the Second World War, legislation was enacted establishing the Kentucky Active Militia, for service during that war. Today, under Kentucky law, the Governor of Kentucky has the legal authority to activate the state’s defense force, known as the Kentucky State Defense Force, whenever any part of the Kentucky National Guard is in federal service.\n\nAttachments:\n\nFederal and State Legislation Which Led to the\n\nEstablishment of the Kentucky State Guard\n\nFEDERAL LEGISLATION:\n\n65th Congress, Session 1, Chapter 28. 14 June 1917, An Act to authorize the issue to States\n\nand Territories and the District of Columbia of rifles and other property for the equipment of organization of home guards, p. 181.\n\nAn Act to authorize the issue to States and Territories and the District of Columbia of rifles and other property for the equipment of organizations of home guards.\n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of War during this existing emergency be, and he is hereby, authorized, in his discretion, to issue from time to time to the several States and Territories and the District of Columbia for the equipment of such home guards having the character of State police or constabulary as may be organized by the several States and Territories and District of Columbia, and such other home guards as may be organized under the direction of the governors of the several States and Territories and the Commissioners of the District of Columbia or other State troops or militia, such rifles and ammunition therefor, cartridge belts, haversacks, canteens, in limited amounts as available supplies will permit, provided that the property so issued shall remain the property of the United States and shall be receipted for by the governors of the several States and Territories and Commissioners of the District of Columbia and accounted for by them under such regulations and upon furnishing such bonds or security as the Secretary of War may prescribe, and that any property so issued shall be returned to the United States on demand when no longer needed for the purposes for which issued, or if, in the judgment of the Secretary of War, an exigency requires the use of the property for Federal purposes: Provided, That all home guards, State troops and militia receiving arms and equipment as herein provided shall have the use, in the discretion of the Secretary of War and under such regulations as he may prescribe, of rifle ranges owned or controlled by the United States of America.\n\nApproved, June 14, 1917.\n\nReport of the Chief of the Militia Bureau, 1918-1919, p. 21.\n\nUnder the act of June 14, 1917, Congress authorized the issue of “rifles, ammunition, cartridge belts, haversacks, and canteens” to States for the use of home guards, State troops and similar military organizations not recognized as National Guard units, such issues to be limited to the articles cited and to the period of the emergency. Most of the States availed themselves of this provision and obtained the articles mentioned, the State authorities being bonded for their safekeeping and return and also being required to insure the property against loss by fire. Under the present law and regulations, these articles, excepting such ammunition as may have been expended, are to be returned to the Federal Government upon the termination of the war emergency. The number of arms issued to the States for home guard purposes up to June 30, 1919, aggregated 78,008.\n\nSTATE LEGISLATION:\n\nActs of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, 1918, pp. 123-125.\n\nChapter 39.\n\nAN ACT to repeal and re-act Section 12 of Chapter 43, Acts of the General Assembly, of 1916, which act is entitled, “An Act to amend and re-enact Chapter 142, of the Acts of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth, approved March 19th, 1912, entitled, “An Act to provide for the organization, armament, discipline and government of the militia,” and in so doing to provide for the organization, armament, equipment, discipline and government of a State Guard, and making an appropriation for same.\n\nBe it enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n\nSec. 12, sub-section 1.
