        "text": "A woman who lost her parrot while visiting Maine from Massachusetts is offering a $1,000 reward for finding the bird.\n\nThe parrot, named “Duckie,” escaped from her harness while on Marginal Way in Ogunquit last month and was last seen flying north toward Ogunquit Beach, according to owner Sabrina Doyle.\n\n“That day will haunt me for the rest of my life,” Doyle told Boston.com. “She’s a wonderful bird.”\n\nSince Duckie went missing, Doyle said she has been commuting back and forth from Massachusetts to Maine to search for Duckie and hang flyers.\n\n“We had strangers going up and down the trail looking for Duckie,” Doyle said.\n\nA Facebook page dedicated to finding Duckie has amassed more than 1,000 followers on the platform.\n\nDoyle said she received a message on Facebook on Sunday from someone saying they saw a man outside a Trader Joe’s in Portland holding a parrot and announcing to passersby that he had found it himself — the same day Duckie went missing.\n\nDoyle has been trying to contact the man in an effort to locate Duckie.\n\nEver since Duckie went missing, Doyle, who cares for numerous rescue birds, said Duckie’s two bird best friends call for her every morning.\n\n“It’s been like a piece of my heart has been ripped out,” Doyle said. “I’m never going to stop looking for her.”"
