Do you have\n\nthem on your tree?\n\nTom Fitzsimmons, Bismarck, North Dakota.\n\n[email protected]\n\nThanks for the interesting reading! I have a book called 'Records of\n\nthe Four Tipperary Septs' which has about 25 pages on O'Meaghers - originally\n\npublished in 1938- reprinted 1995. Also have some Tipp Star articles but\n\nthese may be extracted from the Hayes book.Was in touch with J Richardson in\n\nCa & mentiones your area to him (though he may know already). Will write\n\nagain if anything interesting to say. I have a relative who has our Family\n\ntree back to 17?? all on the same farm (my g'father was born there) in north\n\nTipp.\n\nJohn Meagher, Preston, UK\n\n[email protected]\n\nExcellent job, we enjoyed seeing Maher on www. We have just found(1 year ago)\n\nour roots near Roscre in the north of Tipperary. The home place is still\n\nstanding, although last lived in during the 1950's. It has passed to the\n\nFitzpatrick family who are decendents of my GG grandfathers wife. Our Mahers\n\nare from Ballaghmore, which is actually in county Laois, and the townland of\n\nBarnabee. This place is a few miles from Roscre. He, William J. Maher, came to\n\nNew York around 1888. He married Margaret Cosgrove around 1892. She was from\n\nShinrone, county Offaly, the townland of Corolanty. Shinrone is a few miles\n\nfrom Roscre also. We found the Cosgroves a year or so ago and have visited\n\nthem on three occasions. They hooked us up with cousins here in the States.\n\nMy wife and I went to Clonakenny last summer and visited what I think was the\n\nMaher tower house. Only one wall is standing and what looks like a plantation\n\nhouse is in ruin at the base of it. Next trip we will do a more detailed study.\n\nI would recommend you get a copy of \"Records of the Four Tipperary Septs\"\n\nwhich has just been reprinted 8/95. It has much info on the Mahers. JAG\n\npublishing. Martin Callanan, 1938. Kennys book shop in Galway is on the www\n\nand has it in stock. Costs about $20.00. Thats all for now. I am new to the\n\nweb and hope this gets to you.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\nBill (William J.)

And, maybe not\n\nso surprising, it would appear the Mahers, as it is with all Irish, may\n\nwell be descended from kings!\n\nFor some Maher trivia, I have possession of a O'Meagher family crest\n\ntaken from a turn-of-the-century wall hanging with the motto \"In\n\npericulis audax\" which means, if my Latin serves, \"In danger we excel.\"\n\nMy own interest in genealogy is personal, for I bear the name of my\n\ngrandda, who was born on the Emerald Isle and saw active service in the\n\nBlack and Tan War as a teen before emigrating (against his will, of\n\ncourse) to South Boston, Massachusetts, in the 1920s.

He is out to dinner right now but I have printed out your family\n\nlist and am leaving it on his porch. Ironic, we live in Bayonne, NJ. His\n\nmother's name was Dawson and I forgot where the Maher name comes in but will be\n\nback to you with his info soon.\n\n[email protected]\n\nDear Jack,\n\nJust discovered your site - very cool. Tried to access \"45 generations of\n\nOiliol Olum\" but received an error. Am interested in investigating Meaghers\n\nof the West Coast and Canada. Don't have a 'gedcom' file. Thanks - Shelley\n\nShelley Meagher\n\n[email protected]\n\nHello, Jack\n\nI was amused to get your note, since I spoke to my mother on Saturday and she\n\ntold me that she believes that the relationship of our family to that of the\n\nGeneral was largely a figment of my great-aunt's imagination, so I don't\n\nreally care HOW you spell it!\n\nAll she knows about the family roots is that John Ford Meagher (son of\n\nJerimiah, b. 1836, and Catherine) immigrated from County Kerry at age 14\n\nafter his parents died and settled in LaSalle County, IL. before moving to\n\nMankato MN. She thinks he had a cousin in South Dakota who spelled his name\n\nMaher or Mahar, and she recalls hearing about an argument between John F. and\n\nthe cousin that transpired in the hardware store. They were discussing the\n\npronunciation of the family name (we pronounced it Mayer), and the cousin was\n\nlivid, shaking his fist and shouting \"It was Maher in the old country and\n\nit'll be....\" at which point he fell through an open trapdoor into the\n\ncellar and broke his leg. My mother still pronounces it Mayer, though my\n\nbrother (who lives in Toronto) pronounces it Maher -- and I've opted for\n\nAdams!\n\n[email protected]\n\nJust thought I'd add My Great-Grandfather Thomas Francis Meagher was\n\nnamed for his Uncle The Thomas Francis Meagher mentioned in your page.\n\n[email protected]\n\nJack,\n\nI am just starting to learn to browse the genealogy web sites. Came\n\nacross your web site and felt the luck of the Irish with me. My Grandmothers\n\npaternal grandfather was a Meagher as was my Grandmother. I really don't know\n\nwhat I'm doing but I thought maybe you could be a start. Paternal\n\nGrandfather's name was John Meagher born in Ireland married Maria Davitt also\n\nIreland. They had 2 sons Edward and John.\n\nPlease respond if you've heard of these lads\n\nThanks ,\n\nJoanne\n\n[email protected]\n\nHey Jack,\n\nThanks for responding. I'm sorry to say that I don't much more info on\n\nJohn Meagher or Maria Davitt. I have no counties yet. There son Edward\n\n(grandmother's father) was born in Sprinfield, Mass. If you come across\n\nanything I would sure appreciate it.\n\nThanks Joanne\n\nDear Jack:\n\nMy husband, Robert William Meagher, b. 11-16-1922 in Deerpark, WA, is\n\ndescended from JAMES MEAGHER b. abt 1814, who died in Montreal, Canada\n\n9-8-1905. James Meagher married CATHERINE QUINN, b. abt 1825 in New\n\nBrunswick, Canada, who died in Montreal on 11-16-1910. Their son, JAMES\n\nFRANCIS MEAGHER (my husband's grandfather), born 8-17-1853 in Quebec, Canada,\n\nand died in Seattle, WA on 6-27-1934, married MARY MAHER, born 12-25-1853 in\n\nWashington Co., NY (and died in Seattle, WA on 5-14-1939) to TIMOTHY MAHER,\n\nb. abt 1830 in Tipperary, Ireland and MARGARET KENNEDY, b. abt 1831 in\n\nTipperary, Ireland. They both are buried in Belle Creek, MN. (Margaret's\n\nparents were JAMES KENNEDY and MARY KARNEY.) Timothy and Margaret immigrated\n\nto the US shortly before Mary's birth. (Margaret's sister, MARY KENNEDY\n\nBECKETT and two brothers, DAN AND JAMES KENNEDY, who married HOURIGAN\n\nsisters, went to Australia.) We believe that Timothy's father was TIM MAHER\n\nand his mother MARY CASEY and that he had a brother, PATRICK MAHER. Mary and\n\nPatrick are also buried in Belle Creek, MN.\n\nSo you can see my husband has Meaghers and Mahers both in his ancestry. If\n\nthe above outline information fits with anything you have on file, would you\n\nplease let me know. I use the Family Tree Maker Program, Version 3.0, from\n\nBroderbund to track our families so if you need the above in a different\n\nmanner, please advise. I am not too computer literate, but have a son that\n\nis, so he would help.\n\nMarjorie Meagher\n\n[email protected]\n\n(San Jose, CA)\n\nHello!\n\nThis is so neat that you have gotten this Meagher information together. On a recent\n\ntrip to Ireland a friend brought us back mugs with the Meagher coat of arms. Our family\n\nhas butchered the name so much that we pronounce it \"Mayor.\" My dad would be\n\ninterested in any info you have. Thanks\n\n[email protected]\n\nDear Mr. Wilson,\n\nI came across your address on the internet and thought I would drop a line\n\nto see if I could meet up with any other family members out there. Please\n\nadvise me on the best way to get my queries out. Have you come across many\n\nMaher researchers in this area of NY? Though I am no longer on AOL, I do\n\noccasionally use the free-bee disks that I get and put an add on the\n\nbulletin board. It has not turned up much. Thanks for your thoughts on this.\n\nBelow is listed the information I have on my family that came from county Queens\n\n(Leix) in the mid-19th century to Oswego, New York. No family stories\n\nsurvived about Ireland, but there are several branches of the family who\n\nhave not been located yet. Please feel free to hand out my e-mail and\n\nmailing address. J. Daniel Mahar, 41 Haight St., SF, CA 94102; e-mail:\n\n[email protected].\n\nMy ancestor Thomas Mahar (04 Oct 1834 - 21 Oct 1904) is said to have been\n\nborn in county Leix and came to the US in the mid-19th century.

Just wanted to give a big thank you for all the information! My 1st\n\nday assignment in my English class is to learn about the history of my\n\nlast name and report it tomorrow.

Note that there will be an\n\n\"Irish Brigade\" monument at Gettysburg with the likeness of T. F. Meagher\n\netc.\n\nI have discovered an \"Irish Internet Hub\" site with Irish Celtic & American\n\nCeltic Resources. It contains a number of genealogical links to pages such as\n\nyours. I had an e-mail from a Maher via the page so don't be surprised if you\n\nare asked to link.\n\nMy son has been assembling our Maher info for submission. He is a young\n\nattorney & kept very busy with the firm so it will take some time. He is a\n\ntrustee of the NJ Genealogical Society and misses the time he was able to\n\nspend on his research before the work situation. He is also working on our\n\nCree side. Cree has a page based in the UK and are members of a \"Single Name\n\nResearch Society\" or some such named association. He has also been to Poland\n\nand is organizing a Cemetery restoration project in my wife's family village.\n\nI have communicated with a two of the people on your page and may have some\n\nconnections.\n\nKeep up the great work. If you need any help I would be happy to give it a\n\nshot.\n\nBill Maher\n\n[email protected]\n\nI located your web site and found it very interesting. I note that you have\n\npart of my name on there - but not all. My full name is Ann Lamb.\n\nMay I make a suggestion? If at all possible, it would be nice if you could\n\nfind a way to post some of the names/dates/places of the Mahers of some of\n\nthe researchers on that list, rather than just a link to their e-mail\n\naddress. That way one could find out in advance if any are relevant. I could\n\ne-mail you a list of about 45 people named Maher, their dates and places and\n\nthe people they married, if that is possible. It might help somebody. Or\n\nthey might help me.\n\nHere's my first one:\n\nAnne Maher b. 1 Feb 1822 in Doon, Co. Limerick (right on the Tipperary\n\nborder), daughter of Edward and Mary.

Thanks.\n\nJanet Neal - [email protected]\n\nI have very little to go on, but here goes: I am researching Bridget Maher (Meagher) who married Denis Brereton in Ireland in early 1800's. Denis was a school teacher who was \"persecuted for teaching Gaelic\". The family \"fled to Austrailia\" c. 1860. I have found record of family traveling from Melbourne to Hobart, Tasmania in July 1861. It\n\nseems that Denis may have been in Melbourne earlier than rest of family. Children include: Mary b. 1847 in Ireland m. Redmond), Julia b. 1861in Ireland (my ancestor who married James Bannon), John (m. Katherine ?), Margaret (m. Everhardt) Ellen (m. John Condon) and Thomas who drowned coming to US from Austrailia.

He married Elizabeth Monaghan and, after her death, Mary Begley. The family of seven children later moved to New Castle, DE.

I know very little about my father's side of the family and can summarize the family story as follows: My grandfather's name was William Maher, he was born in St. Louis in 1885 and worked as a carpenter. He had a sister but her name is unknown. He married Alice Brown (b. 1889 in NY, NY) who had three brothers, Willam, Michael, and Richard, and one sister, Mamie. Alice Brown's mother was named Brigid and was almost certainly born in Ireland but when and where are unknown. William and Alice had four children, Margaret, Agnes, William J. (me da), and Thomas. That's as far as I've gotten to date. I hope to go to Ireland in '97 and would like to know more about my Maher roots by then if possible. Thanks again Jack.\n\nMy email address is [email protected].\n\nRegards, William Michael Maher\n\nThis is a great page.\n\nFYI, I'm decended from the Meaghers, Gen TF Meagher line, out of Philadelphia PA, USA. My mother was Lucy Frances Meagher (b.1917), daughter of Thomas Francis Meagher (b.1886). I'm in the process of recovering from an upgrade so my Gedcom stuff isn't quite ready yet. I suspect I'll complete it during this winter.\n\nI met up with an Alan Meagher, a distant cousin, of Minnesota fame, I believe through this web site. Its a small internet world.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\nJoe Kelly ([email protected])\n\nJohn: My name is Fred Meagher. I have just scanned the Maher/Meagher information and was surprised no mention of Meagher's Grant was made. My father did some leg work in Nova Scotia and was told it was given to the Meagher family during the Revolutionary War in exchange for fishing boats commandeered by the British army. I was wondering if anyone has any information regarding this matter. Thanks.\n\nFred Meagher\n\n[email protected]\n\nJack, I am a direct descendent of John Thomas Maher a banker in Ballinasloe b. circa 1785 and married Lucy Elizabeth (nee ?). They had at least three children Jane b.1812, John Edward (known as Edward) and my 2x great grandmother Catherine Maher b.1819. Catherine married James Forth Kempster on July 8, 1841 at St. John's Church (Church of Ireland) Ballinasloe. Both Jane and Catherine are buried at St. Matthews Cemetery in Aughrim, Co. Galway. If anyone has any information on this particular branch of the Mahers I'd be most grateful. Catherine died October 19, 1858 and Jane died November 8, 1873.\n\nThank you, Rory Kempster\n\n[email protected]\n\nG'day Jack,\n\nRather fortuitiously I have just stumbled across this page. I have been thinking of doing some serious research over the next year or so.\n\nI have some research done by others in my family but it is packed somewhere in a box. However, I can give a brief outline and will fill in the details at some later stage.\n\nI am third generation Australian having descended from John Maher and his first wife Margaret (Marra). They migrated from Tipperary some time around 1870. I do not know the town/village they came from.\n\nJohn and Margaret settled in the New England district of northern New South Wales near a small village called Bendemeer. They had four sons (John, Patrick, Michael and Daniel). Margaret died and John remarried and moved to Newcastle in New South Wales; they had about four or five children. John died around 1914 after having moved to Tamworth, a large regional city near his first place of settlement.\n\nAt the time of the research mentioned above (1986) John had 486 descendents. One can only hazard a guess how many there are now!\n\nWe also believe that John travelled from Ireland on a ship named \"Severn\" with his brother, James (?) who may have left the ship in Melbourne.\n\nI am have been living in Melbourne since 1979 but have made no serious attempt to trace the 'Melbourne\" connection - there is a large swag of Mahers in the Melbourne telephone directory.\n\nWould appreciate any information from any visitors to your page who can assist.\n\nMy wife is descended from the Caffery family but we know little about them.\n\nCheers\n\nKenneth Daniel Maher.\n\n[email protected]\n\nThis is a great page, Jack. Keep up the good work. Perhaps this information will help other or enable others to help me. My tree traces back to Cork, Ireland along the following lines.\n\nMy mother is Agnes Maher Ireland born in St. John's Newfoundland in 1922.\n\nHer father was Peter J. Maher born in St. John's Newfoundland in about 1879.\n\nHis father was William Maher born in St. John's Newfoundland. I don't know the date but probably about 1850 or so.\n\nHis father was Edward Maher born in Cork, Ireland probably around 1825.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nTom Ireland\n\n[email protected]\n\nDear Jack\n\nI visited your site in August/September this year. Now I am home again from a visit to Ireland and have a bit more time I thought I would make contact. I have had wonderful success in tracing my own family tree in Co Louth and Meath and so started on my husband's. He is Barry James Maher one of three brothers. I have quite good information on his Maher line here in Australia but have come to a temporary stop with the marriage of his Great Grandparents who were married at St Bede's Church Morpeth New South Wales on 17th January 1871. They were James Maher, Bachelor and labourer then of Morpeth and Catherine Donnelly, Spinster and domestic servant then of Ducken field new South Wales. The problem is that their marriage certificate of which I possess a copy does not show parents names nor other details. I assume that they were either immigrants from Ireland themselves or first generation Australian. John Maher and Jane Donnelly were the witnesses at the marriage. Perhaps this rather shadowy sketch may link to someone else's research. James Maher was shown as a Railway Station master in Rosewood Queensland at the time of his son's marriage to Sarah Nilan in Toowoomba Queensland in the early 1900's - I do have this information but not to hand just now. Thank you for your work on this family name\n\nLorrie Maher Queensland Australia\n\nE-mail address; [email protected]\n\nHi, Iam searching for information on the MAHER FAMILY. Any information on Anson Adlebert Maher born in Fordham New York married Christodella Henrietta Ffoulkes. He was a correspondent with Stanley on the expedition to find Livingstone at the source of the Nile. Would like info on his mother and father etc.\n\nMark Maher\n\n[email protected]\n\nDear Jack, I`m trying to find some background on my Grandfather, Liam Meagher. He was born in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, around the 1890`s. He had a daughter (my Mother, Moira Violet who died just recently, 17/11/96), with \"partner\" Mabel Spencer Leyton-Lugg nee JONES. I say \"partner\" because there is some doubt as to whether they were actually married!!! We have the JONES family tree worked out back to the 1700`s, so now I`d like to know a bit more about HIS side. They were both actors... in fact my Grandmother worked extensively with Charlie Chaplin. I`d be grateful for ANY info that comes along!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMike Long\n\ne-mail: [email protected] OR [email protected]\n\nI've traced my family history to a David Maher who I think immigrated from a Castle Connell, Ireland to Teetoborah, Canada sometime after the 1600s. I believe he may be related in some way to a Murphy who immigrated from Ireland in 1667.\n\nI think David may have married an Ellen O'Brien and been the sister of a Tereesa Maher. He may have had a son named Rudolf. If anyone may help me in tracking down my family history, please e-mail me. I hope you can help.\n\nThank you kindly.\n\nJoseph Frederick\n\n[email protected]\n\nHello!\n\nI'm very new at this, so I apologize if I'm not using appropriate format or computer etiquette! I noticed your reference to the Meagher family and wondered if I'm in the right place to share & seek info. I am a direct descendant of Capt. James Meagher, born in Tipperary in 1789. He fought with Wellington during the Peninsular Campaign, married a Portuguese wife, and came to Kingston, Ontario, in 1814. They had four sons - Jeremiah, James, John and Thomas. I'm not sure if there is a connection (cousins?) to Sir Thomas Francis Meagher. Is there somewhere that I could find out pre-1789 information? Or possibly contact other \"relatives\"? I'm aware that many Irish records were destroyed. Any advice is appreciated - many thanks!\n\nSincerely, Michele Sankar\n\n[email protected]\n\nHi,\n\nJust browsing the web today and discovered the Maher Web pages.

I'm researching Matthew Maher(m. Elizabeth Fox in 1875)in Chicago.He came here approx. 1870 from either Offaly or Tipperary county. His father was James and his mother was Mary Dunnelly or Donnelly or Quelty (very hard to read death certificate) Would you happen to be able to help me with this?

The only thing I have is a marriage certificate of my great great grandparents which is from Kerrey. I appreciate any help. Thanks\n\nbrighid\n\n[email protected]\n\nDear Mr. Wilson,\n\nMy husband's family name is \"Meager\" and according to family lore someone originally a \"Meagher\" quarreled with his folks and dropped the \"H\" in a moment of passion. Or perhaps this unnamed individual was ostracised as he was transported(?) to Australia. My husband and his family are from Victoria, Australia, although I am from Virginia. Any light you may shed on this problem would be greatly appreciated. Thank you,\n\nNancy Meager (sans the \"H\")\n\n[email protected]\n\nI feel really privilaged to be writing this e-mail as a Maher still living in Ireland. I was absolutely delighted to find your site dedicated to the Maher clan and I wish to thank you for all of your efforts in compiling and maintaining same. However, I felt really sad reading through all of the mail from the overseas Mahers and reflecting on the historical reasons as to why they came to be where they are. I must say that I feel a very strong yet uncanny affinity with all of these clan members.\n\nFor my part, I hail from Dun Laoghaire ( transalation: The fort of King Leary) on the east coast of Ireland. Seven generations on my father's side and three on my mother's come from this area. So I am very fortunate to have some significant roots right here.\n\nIf I can help you or any of your correspondents, please feel free to mail me and I will do whatever I can.\n\nThank you once again.\n\nJames (Jim) Francis Paul Maher\n\n[email protected]\n\nI was so excited when I found this web page. This is just great. My Great aunt wrote a book about 10 years ago detailing our Maher family history. An interesting note is that when my grandfather and his brothers worked for the railroad somebody made an error on their paychecks and spelled each of their surnames wrong, so my granpa's remained Maher, but his brother's last names were spelled Mahar, Magher and Meagher. They fought to get them corrected but failed. I recently visited the family plot and saw that they all kept the incorrect spellings. I have currently been trying to research my grandfather's father, John Maher Magher Meagher (we do not know how the surname was spelled in Ireland). He was born June 1833 in Limerick and he married one Ellen Nellie Noonan born 1838 in Limerick. They were married on 28 Jan 1858 in Limerick, witnesses are said to have been a Pat Maher and Ellen Noonan. I do not have the births and deaths of their parents but John's father's name was Timothy Maher Magher Meagher and his mother's was Kate Mahone. Ellen's father's first name is unknown but her mother's name was Daughter Ryan. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I have now sparked the interest of all my aunts, uncles and cousins and they are eager for some info. Keep up the good work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nErin Maher. e-mail: [email protected]\n\nHello again! I love reading all the Meagher info found here and I thought I'd write again, as our email address has been changed. My greatgrandfather was George Alfred Meagher (1866-1930), a champion figure-skater. He was the son of John Meagher (b. Kingston 1816, d. Montreal 1896), who in turn was the son of Capt. James Meagher. James was born in Tipperary in 1896 and fought in the Peninsular Campaign. It was then that he met his Portuguese wife, Maria Antonia. Their eldest son Jeremiah was born in Spain or Portugal (1813), James Jr. was born in Ireland (1814), John and Thomas in Kingston (1816, 1823).\n\nIt would be great to hear from anyone who is even remotely connected, or has any info on George, John, or James Sr. I wish I knew more about James Meagher's Irish background and parentage. Hope I can also help someone out in some way with the info I do have. Take care!\n\nMichele Sankar [email protected]\n\nHello Jack,\n\nI am just now starting some investigations into my family tree and saw your name here on the web. Perhaps you can help... I am a Caulfield. My Great Grandfather George Caulfield from Galway was married to Jane Maher. The only information I have on her is that the house she was born in is still standing at Stone Park, Glen of Aherlow, Tipperary. I would appreciate any leads, cousin\n\nThanks\n\nLeslie Caulfield [email protected]\n\nI have researched my family up to Edward Mahar. He was born 5/4/1883 in Val Cartier, Quebec, Canada. His parents were Edward Mahar and Margret Holden. I think they immigrated from Ireland. I would like to know if anyone has information on Edward Mahar and Margret Holden.\n\nGreg Mahar [email protected]\n\nJack, please add this info to your E-mail page:\n\nI am looking for information on my great great grandfather Patrick and I \"think\" his father Edmund.\n\nPatrick: I believe born 3-8 or 10-1818 -lived on a farm at \"Cullen Castle\" (Tramore, Ire.) married a Catherine Doyle (in Ireland) in 1867 - with my great grandfather (Walter Maher) born in Chicago in 5-25-1868. I believe Walter's wife Catherine had a previous marriage (Michael Cummings?)and perhaps Patrick had a first marriage. (Just before Walter died he indicated he had a half brother \"Tim\" and a half sister \"Mary\" from a previous marriage of his Dad-but it may have been his mothers first marriage.)\n\nIf I am correct on the birth date then Patrick had 8 brothers and sisters and were the children of Edmund and Bridget (Kearney) married 2-10-1805..

I know Patrick came to the USA - farmed near Waucoma, Ia and died in 1898 I believe his wife Catharine Doyle (or Catherine)came to the US in 1849 may have spent a year in Quebec and later in Vermont then husband died and she returned to Ireland (Tramore?)\n\nIf anyone has any information on a Patrick or Edmund Maher born on or near the dates listed I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nDavid/Chris Maher\n\nPS My dad is Richard and grandfather Leo (from N/E Iowa \"Lawler)\n\n[email protected]\n\nMr. Wilson:\n\nI saw your web site while browsing and would like any additional infomation that you may have regarding the Mahers.

He was born and died in Cleveland Ohio, the son of James Francis Maher (1864-1916) and Julia Gleason (1868-prior 1916). James F. Maher was born in Worcester, Mass. and died in Cleveland. James F. Maher was the son of James Maher and Anna Dwyer.\n\nI found your Maher page interesting. It is an unusual format; casual enough to be homey, yet well formated for serious research. And it provides many good contacts for people of similiar interests. Congradulations.\n\nBob Page [email protected]\n\nTuesday, 7 January 1997. HELP, HELP, HELP, HELP. I am an Historical Archaeologist. I am researching the Maher family. My grandfather was John Henry Maher (Tracey) born in Thronbrough North Queensland Australia on the 29 May 1881. John Henry died in Brisbane on 29 August 1956. He was miner and a sawmiller in Herberton, Atherton and Cairns, North Queensland. John Henry married Grace Margaret Ryan in Irvinebank on 5 March 1902. Their children were:\n\nWilliam Henry (Tracey) b. 22 May 1901, Irvinebank, Queensland.\n\nJohn Robert (Tracey) [My father] 24 January 1903, Watsonville, Queensland.\n\nAllan Richard (Tracey) b. 1 August 1905 Irvinebank, Queensland.\n\nHarold Alexander (Tracey) b. 15 September 1907 Irvinebank, Queensland.\n\nArthur Archibald (Tracey) b. 8 May 1911 Irvinebank, Queensland.\n\nEileen Catherine (Tracey) b. 4 February 1915 Irvinebank, Queensland.\n\nJohn Henry (Tracey) was born John Henry Maher. His father was John Maher (sometimes referred to as John Maher / Marr / Clark). John Maher was born in West Maitland NSW c. 1846 and was married to or living with Anne Jane Toohey. Anne Jane was the wife of Donald McPherson of Georgetown Queensland. John Maher and Anne Jane Toohey's other children were: Jessie and Maggie McPherson (twins) b. 3 November 1873 Georgetown Queensland.\n\nMargaret McPherson b. 16 September 1873 Georgetown Queensland.\n\nSarah Jane McPherson b. 8 October 1879 Georgetown, Queensland.\n\nJohn Henry Maher (Clark) b. 29 May 1881 Thornbrough, Queensland.\n\nAnne Jane Toohey was born in Dublin Ireland c. 1843 her parents were John and Mary Toohey. She married Donald McPherson, from Argyleshire Scotland, at Liverpool England on 5 June 1862. Their first child William was born at Mackay Queensland on 8 August 1824. Anne Jane died on 16 June 1881 at Thornborough. Nothing is known of John Maher after 1881. Donald McPherson was the informant for Anne Jane's death certificate. John Maher may have died at Cumberland near Georgetown on the 17 June 1887. John Maher or otherwise known as John Clark was a miner. John Henry Maher (Tracey) my grandfather was raised by Patrick Tracey and Mary Anne Ryan.\n\nI would appreciate any information on the Maher, Toohey, McPherson or Tracey and Ryan family that would assist the research into my family.\n\nMichael MacLellan Tracey, Canberra.

I'd like for our branch to be represented on this Family Tree I am also online at NYCTex@aol, but it's best to reach me here @ WAVRLYBOYZ...\n\nSo, If you don't know about the Southern portion of the family, I'd love to tell you what I know, which isn't much, unfortunately. I'm having a blast learning about the Michael who emigrated to NYC, especially since I live here myself now. Anyway, I look forward to hearing from you soon...\n\nPeace!\n\nMichael [email protected]\n\nHi Jack,\n\nWhat a wonderful project this is you've taken on.I just finished all the info i have on my Meagher family tree by using \"The Family Treemaker\" 3.0 . I was about to embark on a search through the latter day saints(Morman) research center,we haone here in Plainview ,L.I.,N.Y. but I see you've done very well for yourself.The last few days I've gotten several e-mails from fellow Meagher's and am sending them info via snail mail as they don't have a genecological format for viewing my records.I am now in the process of gathering many photo's that one of my cousins has and will try to gat them on a kodak disc format so I can add them to the file before I upload them to you.My Uncle Joseph W. Meagher,who is an author living in NYC has done most of the reasearch and i'm formatting it and adding what i can learn.I have all the records concerning Michael J. Meagher,who was born in Tipperary in 1840.He emigrated to Brooklyn,N.Y. in 1860 and became very successful in the Porter buisness at the time.He was able to afford to bring his entire family over in the 1870's ,including his father John Meagher ,born in tipperary in 1812.and his mother Anna Dalton,who was born in 1813,in Ireland ,but I don't know where? He also brought over 10 brothers and sisters starting with Thomas F. meagher, b.1871,Minnie Meagher, b.1873, John J. Meagher, b.1874, Twins-Will & Mitch Meagher, b. 1880, Etta Meagher, b. 1890-1905 ,Joseph Valintine Meagher ( my grandfather) b.1891-1964. By his 2nd wife Agnes Nugent, b. 1883-1960 ,James Meagher, b. 1883-1993 and Margaret Meagher, b.1882-?.His first wife was named Catherine O'brien, b. 1845-1887 she had the 1st 7 children. It seems after they all came over they had problems with the names pronounciation and they changed it to Maher.But my Great grandfather didn't like it so he changed it back to the original spelling.Michael J. Meagher changed to the saloon buisness and did very well owning many properties and then building a brick home for $6,000.00 in 1875.he then became Pres. of the N.Y. Liquor dealers Association for 30 yrs. He was also a democratic district leader in Brooklyn durring the Tammany Hall ( Boss Tweed) administration.I have several Narratives on the family with some interesting stories,One of which is Gen. Thomas francis Meagher being the Godfather to his first child of the same name.I'de be happy to share this with all ; I just need a little time to compile those photo's and then figure out how to upload it all for you.In the meantime any help you can give me in picking up my roots past to the parents of John Meagher and Anna Dalton who were born in 1812 & 1813 respectively. He in Tipperary and she I don't know where ??Catherine O'brien was born in Ireland in 1845 and emigrated to USA in 1867.\n\nThanks for any help you can lend.Soon you can add my GEDCOM files along with the rest.Again:thanks Jack and keep up the good work!!!!!!\n\nGary E.

I can't find further info so far on my grandfather.\n\nI can be reached at (e-mail) [email protected], (must include the underscores) or at 4606 Sutley Circle, Papillion, NE 68133.

My email is [email protected]\n\n[email protected]\n\nJack,\n\nMy mother was a Mahar, the great-granddaughter of Henry Mahar. The first record I have of him is in Hardin County, Tennessee, in 1843. He was reportedly one of four brothers who came to the US shortly before that date. Another Mahar, Joseph, was in the same county at the same time. The other two brothers have not been identified. Very few records of Henry remain, just a photo of his wife and a Masonic ring. Naturally I would like to find out anything that I can about him. If you ore any of your readers can direct me to any sources that could help me learn about him, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n[email protected]\n\nI am interesting in finding more about my Maher relatives. My great- grandfather was named William Maher and he lived in Baltimore MD until he was about 15 or 16, when he left for Texas and ending up in what is now Owyhee County, Idaho in 1863. He built a successful ranching business and passed it on to my grandfather Ambrose and his brother Bill upon his death in the early 1900's. My Grandfather, Ambrose, died in Boise in 1954 or 1955.\n\nCan you help me?\n\nTony Maher [email protected]\n\nDear Jack,\n\nThanks for the great website!\n\nIt is a wonderful opportunity for us all to connect, no matter how we massacre the name!\n\nMy descendents, great/great grandparents, left Tipperary in 1837 or 1840, and settled in Marysville, Ontario- the Bay of Quinte area.

Boy, Meaghers are really proud of their heritage and name. (Aren't all irish people?)\n\nWe have an annual Meagher reunion every year in Wisconsin. This year, it is going to be held at Milwaukee's Irish Fest, at the lakefront, in August. We plan to rent a tent.\n\nWe don't know much about the family history. Chris' father and grandfather were both named Joseph E. Meagher. Joe Sr. lived in Indiana, Illinois, and finally, Madison, Wisconsin. Joe Sr.'s father's name was Patrick. Patrick came from Ireland. We understand that many of the family history documents in Ireland were destroyed. We were wondering if anyone recognizes anything familiar about our family.\n\nChris' family lives in Madison, Wisconsin. Has anyone heard of the music store called \"Forces-Meagher\" in Madison. Chris's dad, Joe, and brother, Casey, run the place.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you and visiting your web site again.

I spent the last couple of hours going through your stuff and matching it up to the reasearch my g.grandmothers family did generations ago. I'm trying to pick back up the research and trace it back further. I was wondering if you have any more information on John O'Meagher b. 1772, d. 1844, of the 42nd generation in your research. I have traced my family back to a John Bassette Maher, who was born in Ireland around 1801. He came over to the US at an unknown time, married an unknown, but raised two children, John Bassette Jr. and Mary Charlotte. The Wife was listed as being from Mass. John Jr. was born in Conn. (1834?) and Mary born in VA (1837?). He is listed in the 1850 census for Elizabeth City County, Virginia. If you have any info. is would be greatly appreciated. Thank you\n\nJohn E. Poplin [email protected]\n\nJack:\n\nJust had a chance to spend some time again on the page. I have changed e-mail addresses and was wondering if you had a any helpful hints on doing this research.

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!\n\nLarry Maher Santa Cruz, CA [email protected]\n\nHello, and thank you for providing a great service to those of us researching MAHER roots. I believe I am descended from JOAN MAHER, who was married to JAMES HART. They had at least two children, BRIDGIT HART HAYDEN and THOMAS HART, emigrating in 1820. Both of these children settled in Perry County, Missouri upon their immigration to America. Before this immigration I know pitifully little of the HARTS or the MAHERs.\n\nThanks, all readers for your attention and any correspondence.\n\nWilliam Hart, St. Louis, Missouri email: [email protected]\n\nemail: [email protected]\n\nJack, My name is Todd Meagher. As I trace my family tree my aunt tells me my great grandfather's name was George Mahr and he was born in Ireland. As I reviewed your Meagher surname page the only close referenece to this is Maher is there any connection? With my name being Meagher now I am trying to find out if Mahr is related to Maher or Mahar? My aunt says that the schools here in the US had something to do with the new spelling. Does this mean I as a Meagher am not related to the Meaghers from Ireland? My Greatgrandfather was from Ireland, where should I go for answers? I am going to Ireland in a week and would like to find out which name to research.\n\nThanks,\n\nTodd [email protected]\n\nHi, just a line to congratulate you on the Maher page.

Looking for connection to James Patrick MEAGHER, b. 24 Apr 1859 in Tipperary (possibly Emly). Married Anastatia HAYES, b. 11 Jul 1868 in Hospital, Limerick. Married in Tipperary. Emigrated about 1902. Children were: James (1891), Grace (1892), Catherine (1894), Anastasia (1896), Mildred (1898). James remarried in US; had sons who entered the priesthood in NYC area. Any info would be appreciated. E-mail, please\n\n[email protected]\n\nDear Jack\n\nMy great grandmother was a Grace Patients Maher, who married a Samual Woods in Widnes (I believe)Cheshire England. Grace's parents eloped from Thurles to widnes after permission was refused for them to marry. The story is shroaded in family myth but I beleive that her reluctant father-in-law was a Gerry Maher, \"from a well to do family in Thurles\" I am sort of assuming her maiden name is Patients but this is only speculation. I have no idea when these events took place but I guessing they must have been around 1880-1900.\n\nCan anybody cast any light on this story. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you\n\nKevin Smith\n\n[email protected]\n\nHi there.\n\nI'm so excited to stumble upon this! I've done a wee bit of research, which I'll now go look for (I've forgotten the details)... I know my own great-great grandfather, John Maher, was christening children in the 1860's in Placentia, Newfoundland (now in Canada). (He appears to have married a local girl: though I can't find the marriage record, I did find a corresponding birth record for her in that town.) I wasn't able to go any further back in the Newfoundland record. I wonder if there are any others who've traced to Newfoundland?\n\nAnyway, I'll dig out my records, and certainly revisit this spot. We went to Ireland 2 years ago, with the knowledge that most Mahers originated in Tipperary. We're going back next summer ('98); hopefully I'll be better informed this time!\n\nThanks for putting together such an exciting spot!\n\nJoAnne (Maher) Noel\n\nVictoria, British Columbia, Canada\n\n[email protected]\n\nHello again.\n\nI had another look through the research I did in Newfoundland. There are a few Mahers there still, but as far as I know, they're mostly in the town of Argentia and also in St. John's. (How many were closely related at the time I don't know, though they show up independently in the 2 towns.) I believe I found references to the St. John's Mahers before the turn of the 19th C., but I couldn't swear to it. I know many Newfoundlanders emigrated to \"the Boston states\" in the latter part of the 19th C and the first part of the 20th C., so that may be a missing link for some Irish-Americans. (After Newfoundland became part of Canada in 1949, they started emigrating to other provinces of Canada, but that recently is still in living memory.)\n\nI am the 4th generation of my branch born in Newfoundland, that I can find. I suspect my great-great grandfather was born in Ireland, but I haven't been able to get back beyond the birth records for the generation following him. Here's what I know.\n\nJohn Maher and Mary Roach had\n\n- a son John in Argentia in 1857. (There's no prior record in that area of John Sr., that's why I assume he's the immigrant. Mary Roach was born in Argentia, Newfoundland to Patrick Roach and Elizabeth English in 1836. Given Mary's age I suspect John Sr. was born around 1830, but he's not in the Argentia parish records around that period.)\n\nThey also had\n\n- a daughter Theresa born 1861\n\n- another son John 1863 (so the John b. 1857 must have died)\n\n- a daughter Catherine, 1868\n\nJohn (b.1863) m. Bridget Duke in Argentia in 1889. They had\n\n- a son Daniel, 1891\n\n- a son, Michael, 1893\n\n- a son, (yet another) John, 1895\n\nDaniel (b. 1891) m. Gertrude Jackman in Curling, Newfoundland, in 1915\n\n- Their children, Daniel, Wilfred, William (b. 1923, my dad), Doreen, Ernestine, Ilene, James. (I don't have all the details of my dad's generation, but it's in the family bible).\n\nI have some peripheral stuff around my grandmothers, great uncles, etc., if it's of any use to anyone, though I've been focussing on the patralineal.\n\nI'd love to know about anything that can help me track down John before he was having babies with Mary in Argentia in the late 1850's.\n\nThanks.\n\nJoAnne Maher Noel\n\n(we say \"Mar\", mono-syllabic)\n\nVictoria, BC, Canada\n\n[email protected]\n\nMy great-great grandmother was Elizabeth (Libby) Maher who was born in1845.

My grandmother married Chester Williams and had five children, including my mother, Kathryn. Her father was a Thomas Francis Meagher (a fairly common name, it seems!), who died in or near Kansas City, Kansas, in 1925.\n\nMy grandmother had sisters, Ethel (McNellis), Helen (Fink) and Margaret \"Marge\" (Burgess). Ethel had several children. Helen had no natural children. Margaret had one son.\n\nMy grandmother had brothers, Joseph \"Joe,\" who administered the jail\n\nin Kansas City, Missouri, and Thomas \"Tom,\" who had a hunchback. None of the brothers had children.\n\nThere may have been other sibling, but I'm confident the name of Meagher in my family died (unfortunately) with that generation.\n\nMy grandmother's mother was Nannie Lowe. When I was a student at Santa Clara University and visited my Great-Aunt Marge in Kansas, she told me that her mother (Nannie Lowe Meagher) was from Santa Clara, California. I believe my Aunt Ethel, the eldest sibling, was born in Oakland, California. The family evidently moved East from California to Kansas and Missouri (roughly some time between 1880 and the early 1900s), generally near the Missouri River and then, two generations later, my branch of the family (the Terrys) moved back to California in the 60's.\n\nIf anyone reading this has a connection to my family history (I hope I've got most of it right!), please email me or post your testimony here.\n\nMike Terry\n\n[email protected]\n\nMy name is Angela.

She was from a large family from Simcoe, Ontario, Canada and there she was buried in the 1980's. This information might help another Meagher researcher.\n\nAs an example of a Meagher, Rhea would do you all proud. She was splendid and funny, wise and independent. She had some struggles in life but carried them valiantly. She ran her own employment agency in Williamville, N.Y. and it was there I met her. She got me my first job when I was 14 years old.

Here is some information on my Maherancestors.\n\nEllen (MAHER) LYNCH, my great-grandmother, was born in 1876 in the Townland of Tincurry, Tubrid Parish, County Tipperary (near Cahir). She came to the United States in the late 1890_s, settling in Boston. She worked a while as a housekeeper and was a dressmaker at the time of her marriage to James LYNCH, my great-grandfather, in 1907. They had 4 sons (including my grandfather) and 1 daughter and lived in various locations in South Boston and Dorchester. She was widowed in 1926 after my great-grandfather was struck by a motor vehicle while working at a subway construction site. She lived the rest of her life in Boston and died in 1963. I was 2 years old when she died and don't remember her, but I do have a couple photographs of me with her.\n\nHer parents were Michael and Margaret (WALL) MAHER. They were married in 1875. They were enumerated in the 1901 Irish Census along with their 3 youngest children as residents of Whitechurch (Townland and Parish). His age was listed as 60 and hers as 50. My great-aunt remembers being about 18 when her grandmother died in Ireland, which would have been around 1935. She also guesses her grandfather died around 1915.\n\nMy great-grandmother had 3 brothers and 3 sisters. Like her, the 3 oldest siblings emigrated to Boston. The 3 youngest ones either stayed in Ireland or lived in England, and apparently they all died in the 1920_s (the information I have on them is sketchy). My great-grandmother_s siblings were:\n\nMary (1878-1965), who married Patrick TOBIN in 1912. They had no children.\n\nJames (1880-1962), whose wife_s name was Beatrice. They had a daughter.\n\nBridget (1882-1961), who married Richard WALSH in 1912. They had 4 daughters and 2 sons (including 2 sets of twins).\n\nMichael (b. 1884). According to the birth index, a Patrick MAHER is recorded on the same page as Michael; possibly he was a twin brother who died young.\n\nMargaret (b. 1888), whose married name may have been PURCELL. She had 3 daughters and 1 son.\n\nEdward (b. 1891).\n\nIn searching through 1901 census records, I came across the following Maher families (listed ages are in parentheses):\n\nJohn (70) and his wife Catherine (50) in Kilcoran, Tubrid Parish.\n\nPatrick (30); his wife Mary (20); mother Mary (65); and children William (4), Johanna (2) and Kate (1) in Tubrid (Townland and Parish).\n\nPat (60) and his wife Mary (58) in Shonbally, Shanrahan Parish.\n\nThomas (60); his wife Johanna (60); and children Patrick (29), Ellen(25) and Thomas (23) in Kearah, Mortelstown Parish.\n\nThe e-mail address ([email protected]) is a company address, so any correspondence should be directed to me.\n\nDan Schwendenman\n\nAlbuquerque NM\n\nMy e-mail address is [email protected] My father is Michael Joseph Maher son of Michael Maher. He is one of 7 children born in Philadelphia during the 1920's. Both my grandfather Michael Maher and his wife Rose Melia Maher died in the early 1940's of TB. I'm not too clear about any of my Maher relations although I remember hearing about my grandfather staying with the Coleman family (some kind of relation) around 1914 at their funeral/family home in west Philadelphia. Don't know where to go from here for more information. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nThank you\n\nMary Rose Margaret Asher nee Maher\n\n[email protected]\n\nMy mother's maiden name was Maher. She was born to Patrick and Louie (Johnson) Maher of Ft. Worth , Texas in 1913 or so. I once read a letter written by my great g-dad to my great g-mother before they were married, and he'd just arrived from Ireland, but I don't know from where. If anyone out there has any info, I'd sure like to hear from you.\n\nThanks\n\n[email protected]\n\nHi Jack, many thanks for the web page. I am a Maher from County Carlow. My parents came here to Albany NY in 1897. and remained here. They are buried here. I have done extensive research on the Maher family and have traveled to Ireland and visited the homeland of my ancestors. If anyone would like info on the Mahers from County Carlow and County Kilkenny, they may email me. I would be glad to provide what info I know.\n\nJohn\n\n[email protected]\n\nHello! My name is Suzanne Maher. I live in Western New York and am new to the Internet. I was glad to see that there is a place where I can make contact with other Maher's. Maher is my maiden name. I became interested when I visited the Maher page and found the same coat of arms that is in my parents home. I will be visiting this page more often to read about other Maher's around the world.\n\nIt is very interesting!!\n\n[email protected]\n\nMy sister and I are researching our Maher tree. We know our great grandfather came from Ireland when he was between 5 and 16 years old. His name was John Maher. He was to join his family in Pennsylvania but did not. He ended up in Joliet, Illinois and married Margaret Hassett. He died in Emmett, SD on March 15th, 1915. He had 9 children born in Jolliet, Mayme, Elizabeth, Thomas(died as infant), John, James, Theresa, Irene, Daniel, Rose(died as infant). James married Florence Evelyn McIlvenna Jan. 20, 1920 in Beresford, SD. John married Elsie Spielmann Jan 20th, 1925 in Hartford, SD. His sons John and James(our grandfather) homesteaded in Souix county in North Dakota. Mayme married Ike Brunner. Elizabeth became a nun(Sister Joan). Theresa married John E. McIlvenna June 20th, 1920. Irene married John P. McEneaney Feb. 7th,1922 in Watauga, SD. Daniel married Ruth Selma Peace May 4, 1930 He was a policeman in Peoria, IL. James had 3 children; John, Mary, and Don. John is my father who lives in Mandan, ND.\n\nWe are having trouble finding the link to our Irish ancestors of John.\n\n[email protected]\n\nHi, I am trying to find out about my family. All I know is that my Mother is Catherine or Kathleen Obrien, born 9th nov 1947 who married Thomas Maher, born September or October 1946{i think}. Thomas Maher has a sister Moira Maher. I was born in Donnegal in 1971 and now live in England. I don't know how to start looking for my relatives. I have no family I can get info on and don't possess a birth certificate to be able to get started. Is there any one who can help me as it is very important to me. Thanks for reading this.\n\nAntoinette Maher. Email: [email protected]\n\nMy grandmother was Gertrude Ellen Meagher. She was born in Port Angeles, Washington and raised in Sumner, Washington. She had brothers and sisters in the Bay Area, California\n\nWm Seán Glen\n\n2920 E 40th St\n\nTacoma, Washington\n\n98404-5324\n\nUSA\n\nfrom [email protected] Judy Bishop, Yuma, AZ\n\nWhat a wonderful surprise, to find the Maher page! I have been searching for information about my Irish greatgrandfather for about 6 years. His name was Thomas Maher, b. abt. 1830 in Ireland. He came to the U.S. abt. 1855 and settled, first, in Muscatine Co., IA. His naturalization papers are there,dated 1860. He didn't serve in the Civil War, so no help in military records. He married Eliza Jane (Reynolds) Simpkins in 1864. They moved to Johnson Co. IA, according to the 1870 census. I have found no family mentioned except that Daniel Maher signed his oath for citizenship as a witness. Daniel is buried in Marengo, Iowa Co. IA. Thomas and Eliza Jane moved to the Marengo area abt. 1890. I have found no death date or burial information for him.\n\nDo you have a data base, which you put on the net? Several people mentioned,in their messages, that they had found connections in your information. If it is something you can share, I would appreciate receiving it. I have a Gedcom, but am a novice on the net and don't know how to send it via e-mail.\n\nWith instructions, I would be happy to try. I use PAF and Family Origins for my genealogy information.\n\nThank you for your work in making the Maher page available. I look forward to making some connections with other Iowa Mahers. (Pronounced Mayor by our family).\n\nMr. Wilson\n\nI stumbled across your page and rekindled my intrest in my family's roots. The furthest that I have been able to trace my roots is a Joseph Maher, born in Ireland and immigrated to the US in the mid-19th century, settling in Iowa. His grandson, John Patrick Maher (b. 1913?- d. 1983? Colorado Springs, CO) was my grandfather. His wife Elsa Maher has done a bit of her own research. I was surprised to see that there are other Mahers in the Twin Cities. I came here from the DC area to go to school. I can't believe that no one has made mention of perhaps the best-known Maher, Bill Maher of Politically Incorrect Fame.\n\nColin Patrick Maher\n\n[email protected]\n\nHi Jack,\n\nThis is conrad maher at: [email protected] I am one of a family of 15. Father Thomas Maher whose father was James Maher. They first settled in Monroe Wisconsin and later many of the family lived in South Dakota in the Vicinity of Brookings. My father had an Uncle named Tom Maher whom I met as an elderly gentleman in Souix Fall, S.D. in 1951. My father had brothers, Frank, Steve, John, Bernard and Jim as well as several sisters. One of Steve's daughters is apparently researching this branch of the Maher's.\n\nMy father told us that when his grandfather came to the U.S. at the time of the potato famine, he did not say goodbye to his parents because he left in the middle of the night. This was done because the parents did not tell them how old they were as they had to be 21 to indenture themselves for the passage to the U.S. The GG Dad who left Ireland at that time stood outside his parents bedroom and cried because he knew he would never see his mother again. What is so sad is that they became so busy making a go of it in the new conditions, I don't think many of them ever communicated with the parents left behind by mail. When they came to the states they came with first cousins named Cudahay who went into the meat packing business in the Chicago area and became quite successful. My grandfather James was a successful farmer in South Dakota where he and his sons farmed more than 600 acres of land(under plow) with up to 50 head of horses. They plowed in the fall until the ground froze with 8 horse teams, stopping to change teams at mid day. When the ground froze, they picked corn until the ground thawed in the spring and the remainder of the plowing and then planting was undertaken. More some other time. You can also reach me through my son\n\nConrad Christian Maher: [email protected] I will be visiting him in the near future and he will want to know some more about his ancestors.\n\nIf you would like to add your Query (sorry Maher, Mahar, Meaghers and variants only) to this page, mail your query to Jack Wilson . Please include your e-mail address in the message. Sometime they don't appear in your e-mail header. I will try to add it as soon as possible but it could take up to a month, please be patient.\n\nThis page was last updated on June 24, 1997"
