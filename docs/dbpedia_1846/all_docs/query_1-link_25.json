She also liked knitting, crochet, vegetable gardening and planted the most beautiful flower gardens. Her favorite was cooking and entertaining with family and friends for holidays and picnics. After she received her bread machine as a gift, everyone in the family and her neighborhood, including the mailman had homemade bread always! She really loved to shop and had a great sense of style. She also enjoyed sitting outside, doing word search puzzles, and chatting with her neighbors.\n\nShe was loving, caring, and generous, and always took the time to make sure her loved ones were taken care of.\n\nDaughter of the late Stanley J. and Edith (Guida) Galant, and wife of the late Richard (Dick) Doyle, she is survived by her loving daughter, Cynthia (Cindy) Beasley and Son-in-Law Hank and her beloved Granddaughter Jade Beasley of Morrisville, PA.\n\nCatherine was the oldest of six siblings.
