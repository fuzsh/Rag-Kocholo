        "text": "In the heart of the Roaring Fork Valley, a remarkable initiative took shape, driven by the spirit of service and compassion.\n\nThe Veterans Cup Foundation is a vibrant platform dedicated to empowering nonprofit organizations supporting veterans. The Aug. 6 golf tournament at Aspen Glen Golf Club creates an essential fundraising opportunity that helps enable nonprofits.\n\nThis year, the event will raise money for Warrior Saber, Huts for Vets, and Music Therapy Retreats. This effort will advance the nonprofit’s missions effectively. Money raised from this year’s Veterans Cup will help the above nonprofits gain the recognition and resources they need.\n\nThe foundation emerged from the legacy of former Pitkin County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo, who started the Sheriff’s Cup, a local event that for six years significantly benefited regional nonprofits — including Huts for Vets, which provided critical support to veterans.\n\n“Huts for Vets was supported by the Sheriff’s Cup for a long time.” said Ryan Del Grosso, a co-founder of the foundation and current president of Huts for Vets. “We asked ourselves: How we can do more to support more than one entity?”\n\nBuilding on the legacy of the Sheriff’s Cup, DiSalvo and Del Grosso — fueled by their unwavering commitment to honoring those who have served — sought to amplify their impact. They envisioned a foundation dedicated to organizing fundraising events and channeling resources to nonprofits focused on empowering veterans and supporting their needs.\n\nDel Grosso said raising money for more than one nonprofit has tertiary benefits.\n\n“(The supported nonprofits) can share services, resources, and participants,” he said. “This is more than just a golf event. This allows these nonprofits to have a high-end event and meet with potential high-end donors that they can use as a one-stop shop for new opportunities — opportunities that smaller nonprofits like these might not be able to afford on their own.”\n\nThe Veterans Cup Foundation’s mission is both clear and heartfelt: to create opportunities and drive support for initiatives that uplift veterans and their communities. As they continue their journey, their efforts promise to foster a spirit of generosity and forge a brighter future for the heroes who have defended our nation.\n\nThe Veterans Cup still has slots available for teams of four to participate. Sponsorship slots are also available. Players, sponsors, and donors do not have to be veterans themselves to participate.\n\nRegistration begins at 9 a.m. on Aug. 6 at Aspen Glen Golf Club. To learn more about the foundation, sign up to participate, donate, or sponsor, visit veteranscupfoundation.org .\n\nWestley Crouch covers the City of Aspen and general reporting for The Aspen Times.
