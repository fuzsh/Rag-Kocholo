        "text": "The issue of policing in Northern Ireland was both highly contested and of the foremost political salience for all the political parties involved in the peace process, and also for their communities. Prior to the peace process, on no other matter other than the constitutional stats itself was there such a complete and apparently unbridgeable divide between the two communities as there was on policing. Based on this reality and the subsequent proposals to ‘remake’ policing in Northern Ireland, commentators from across the political spectrum have portrayed the peace process as being built upon the basic premise that nationalists agreed to local power-sharing in the context of a constitutionally reformed UK, while in return they were given reforms in the areas of civil and human rights, including policing. This perspective has the effect of reducing the transformation of policing in Northern Ireland to the status of a concession to nationalists; it was forcefully resisted by unionists, but finally agreed once all sides believed that they had secured their constitutional preferences. Contrary to the view of policing as a lower-order concession, this chapter argues that the negotiations on policing were not at one step removed from the core disputes on sovereignty and state power; rather, the transformation of policing, as much as the new institutions of government, reflected the consociational character of the 1998 Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and its institutionalised linkages between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland."
