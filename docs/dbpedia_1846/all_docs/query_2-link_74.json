        "text": "George Bellows Quotes\n\nOn boxing\n\nBefore I married and became semi-respectable, I lived on Broadway opposite the Sharkey Athletic Club where it was possible under the law to become a ‘member’ and see the fights for a price.\n\nI don’t know anything about boxing. I am just painting two men trying to kill each other.\n\nWho cares what a prize fighter looks like? It’s his muscles that count.\n\nI do not care about the expression of the prize fighters mug. A prize fighter’s muscles are his e pluribus unum. The expression on his face is about as important as the polish on a locomotive’s headlight…Prize fighters and swimmers are the only types whose muscular action can be painted in the nude legitimately.\n\nI am not interested in the morality of prize fighting. But let me say that the atmosphere around the fighters is a lot more immoral than the fighters themselves.\n\nA fight, particularly under night light, is of all sports the most classically picturesque. It is the only instance in everyday life where the nude figure is displayed.\n\nPrizefighters and swimmers are the only types whose muscular action can be painted in the nude legitimately.\n\nAll sport is cruel. For one side’s victory presupposes the other side’s defeat. But in baseball or football, where the game covers a large area and the play is diffused, it is difficult to focus a point in the game that tells the story. In a prize fight interest centers on the two men. There is effective drama in its big moment of victory and defeat. And I have the average man’s interest in all sports.\n\nOn art and art making\n\nArt must tell a story.\n\nEvery artist is looking for news. He is a great reporter of life, keeping his eyes open for some hitherto untold piece of reality to put on his canvas. His picture chooses him. He doesn’t choose what he shall paint anymore than a writer chooses the news that shall happen or the idea that shall possess him.\n\nIt is a matter of feeling. The test of my success with a picture, to me, is whether I have been able to make other people feel from the picture what I felt from the reality.\n\nThe ideal artist is he who knows everything, feels everything, experiences everything, and retains his experience in a spirit of wonder and feeds upon it with creative lust.\n\nThe artist is the person who makes life more interesting or beautiful, more understandable or mysterious, or probably, in the best sense, more wonderful.\n\nThe aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance.\n\nArt strives for structure, and aspires for magnificence.\n\nI can’t see anything in the worship of beauty which some people seek to develop. Beauty is easy to paint; just as easy as something grotesque. What really counts is interest.\n\nLacking choice art dies.\n\nAccording to my view, drawing and painting is a language. You can be great or small, glad or sad, in its use according to what you have to say.\n\nTo be a student is to have an eternal aptitude of mind for the assimilation of understanding, impressions, and knowledge.\n\nEvery student must become at once editor and judge of who and what is for him worthwhile.\n\nMany painters specialize these days. It’s all wrong. If a man can paint at all he can paint anything that he knows or feels.\n\nI expect to change my methods entirely when I learn what I can in a new direction.\n\nI admire the man who tries to do a big thing with the implements at his hand. Even if he fails to please, he has done something worthwhile.\n\nLearning to draw or paint is comparatively an easy matter. But to say anything—you must have ideas. You can paint perfectly and still be as uninteresting as a college professor giving a dry lecture.\n\nA great school is where a great teacher is.\n\nA work of art may be described as an arrangement or ordering of forces with the motive of stimulating the emotions and the receptivity of the mind to aesthetic impression and creation.\n\nThe Big Idea: George Bellows talks about Patriotism for Beauty\n\n“I am a patriot for beauty” is George Bellows’ idea. “I would enlist in any army to make the world more beautiful. I would go to war for an ideal—far more easily than I could for a country. Democracy is an idea to me, is the Big Idea. I cannot believe that democracy can be dropped out of existence because of the purpose of one or of many nations.\n\n“I am going out to California this summer and paint my head off—and then I’ll do my stunt for democracy—if it comes out that way. I cannot put my finger on my war psychology at all. I can see clearly the beauty of France giving her blood for the ideal expressed in “Ma Patrie.” But then, too, I can see the point of view of the Pacifist who wants to lead his life in his own way, out to the end he has planned for it, and who wants to work for his children and stay with them. But where the Patriot gets it over the Pacifist in my mind is that he does not have a chance to be a coward. And the Pacifist can be either a philosopher or coward as his nature suggests—that is what troubles me about it.\n\n“I hate the thought of fighting—but I am all for democracy. You see it tangles a fellow up pretty badly. I guess most men I know would feel mighty sick at the thought of a bayonet. To me the bayonet is the worst part of war. And yet back of the bayonet is the great call to democracy.\n\n“I have been called a revolutionist—if I am, I don’t know it. First of all I am a painter, and a painter gets hold of life—gets hold of something real, of many real things. That makes him think, and if he thinks out loud he is called a revolutionist. I guess that is about the size of it.\n\n“I am deeply interested in real life. I want to see it, I want to paint it, and God knows I do not want to destroy it. But there you are. If you think, you see democracy looming large for the whole world; France is great because she is living it, Russia is great because she is starting it. If you think, you know democracy has got to win— not in this nation or in that, but freedom for the whole world. ‘\n\n“I have always felt about art, that it was freedom that counted. A man must see things and say things his own way. This is his New Imagination. No artist who thinks can spend his life trying to understand another man’s interest. It’s all right about those wise old guys in Italy and Spain. I am mighty interested in what they did, because they used their own imagination for their lives. And I want to use mine for the things I see—the Hudson, the skyscrapers, the sea at Monhegan, ship-building at Gloucester, I see wonder where the young immigrants play in the green river parks at night.\n\n“I like to paint Billy Sunday, not because I like him, but because I want to show the world what I do think of him. Do you know, I believe Billy Sunday is the worst thing that ever happened to America? He is death to imagination, to spirituality, to art. Billy Sunday is Prussianism personified. His whole purpose is to force authority against beauty. He is against freedom, he wants a religious autocracy, he is such a reactionary that he makes me an anarchist. You can see why I like to paint him and his devastating ‘saw-dust-trail.’ I want people to understand him. “When I paint the great beginning of a ship at Gloucester, I feel the reverence the ship-builder has for his handiwork. He is creating something splendid, to master wind and wave, something as fine and powerful as Nature’s own forces. I get it from him that he is impressed with his own struggle to accomplish this, and when I paint the colossal frame of the skeleton of his ship I want to put his wonder and his power into my canvas, and I love to do it. I have no criticism to make of what he does, I am filled with awe, and I am trying to paint as well as he builds, to paint my emotion about him. I call this the ‘New Imagination’—I have no other.\n\n“I tried to do something as genuine as the painting of a shipbuilder’s work when I painted a famous old man for a famous New York club house. I put my kind of imagination into it. I wanted to make him live just as he was. It seemed to me that if the club members wanted him to be painted, they would want him as they knew him. And then I made a canvas with the color that belonged to life, full of it, but the art committee of the club sent my picture back. And now I am very glad of it. I like it around, because it has come to be regarded as the best portrait I ever have painted.\n\n“It’s a queer thing about models. Do you know some people have the design of a painting in their features and bodies, and some haven’t. I have seen beautiful women whom you couldn’t paint at all, you couldn’t get a design from them, you couldn’t make their bodies compose. And along comes a little girl, not especially pretty, not striking, but you can paint her; she can make designs for a dozen paintings.\n\n“ I am always very amused with people who talk about lack of subjects for painting. The great difficulty is that you cannot stop to sort them out enough. Wherever you go, they are waiting for you. The men of the docks, the children at the river edge, polo crowds, prizefights, summer evening and romance, village folk, young people, old people, the beautiful, the ugly. Everywhere the difficulty that I have had, even when I was quite young was to stop long enough to do the thing. As a student I was always eager to do the tremendous, vital things that pressed all about me. It seems to me that an artist must be a spectator of life; a reverential, enthusiastic, emotional spectator, and then the great dramas of human nature will surge through his mind.\n\n“I do not see why a man should wait a minute to begin work after he has any security in his technique; because the way to become a painter is to paint. There are only three things demanded of a painter: to see things, to feel them, and to dope them out for the public. You can learn more in painting one street scene than in six months’ work in an atelier. My advice is to paint just as soon as you have the confidence to, and keep your ideals of art aloof to criticize your painting with. Watch all good art, and accept none as a standard for yourself. Think with all the world, and work alone.\n\n“When once you begin to work, it is amazing how people account for what you accomplish. I have been told in print that I have found my inspiration in Spain with Goya; in France with Manet and Courbet; in America with artists younger than myself, and from whom I could not have gained help because my painting began before theirs. I have been said to have come out into the painting world slowly, handicapped with my respect of old masters. I have been accused of painting without reverence for art before I had mastered my technique. It seems to me the only way is to get from the past what you can, from the present what you are bound to, to absorb it all, assimilate what you can; think, see, feel, live and work. Anyway, the great purpose of art is to develop the artist, the pleasure that he gives is secondary. If he has many big ideas and fine ideals and a technique to put them over, so much the better; but in the main, art is man’s capacity of showing his development. And every artist must do it his own way.”\n\nWe feel that Mr. Bellows has given us a very good recipe for being a painter, “watch all good art and accept none as a standard, think with all the world and work alone.” The man who can do this will indeed find his own development. He will understand what has been done the world over, appreciate it, assimilate it and forget it. There is truly no more individual young painter in America today than George Bellows, no more sincere student of art and no more genuine admirer of what has been done in art throughout the world. But as he says, “every artist must do it his own way”—and we feel that Bellows’ way is a very American one, frank and worthwhile.\n\n—George Bellows’ “The Big Idea: George Bellows talks about Patriotism for Beauty,” The Touchstone, v.1 1917. Pages 269–271.\n\nThe Relation of Painting to Architecture: An Interview with George Bellows in Which Certain Characteristics of the Truly Original Artist Are Shown to Have a Vital Relation to the Architect and His Profession\n\n“… I am sick of American buildings like Greek temples and of rich men building Italian homes. It is tiresome and shows a lack of invention. I paint my life . . . All living art is of its own time . . . Few architects seem to grasp this. Bush Terminal Sales Building is expressive of our needs. Greek temples with glass windows are foolish.”\n\n—George Bellows.\n\nIn these words is expressed a point of departure and the essence of this interview. We sought George Bellows because we believed he represented that non-conformist attitude toward tradition that most architects unfortunately lack. We talked to him with that belief in mind. It mattered little just what the exact relation of painting, as expressed purely in pieces of canvas or in mural decoration, might have to architecture. It mattered less to attempt any exhaustive or dispassionate inquiry into the niceties of that relation. What did matter was the fact that Mr. Bellows typifies an attitude toward art whereby he is enabled to produce really original work. How he does it is undeniably of interest to architects, and he has frankly given of himself in this interview to place before the architectural profession every helpful experience.\n\n“There is no new thing proposed, relating to my art as a painter of easel pictures, that I will not consider,” stated Mr. Bellows. “The fact that a thing is old and has stood the test of time has become too much a god to almost all men who can be termed artist. What it seems to me should interest the architect is exploration, not adaptation,” he explained. “I have no desire to destroy the past, as some are wrongly inclined to believe. I am deeply moved by the great works of former times, but I refuse to be limited by them. Convention is a very shallow thing. I am perfectly willing to override it, if by so doing I am driving at the possibility of a hidden truth. It seems obvious that architects should have the same attitude toward their work.”\n\nAs an example of his attitude toward the conservative acceptance of given ideas, we asked Mr. Bellows what he thought the artist should know about period styles in order more clearly to understand the work of architects. Here is the answer:\n\n“I do not believe in period style. It seems secondhand. All living art is of its own time. Few architects seem to grasp this. Period style is a reversion to past types. Originated styles of the present period would be desirable, and could vary with their locality. There would need to be no monotony. These styles, if they were devised, could be as glowing, as virile, as truly fine as any that we now worship, for they would be of our own time. We would understand them. We could do them better. They would have greater significance to the layman, for they would not be shrouded in mystery and obscure allusion.” Here was our plea for regional types, set forth in all its glory by one quite outside of the architectural profession!\n\nThen, we prompted, what would you suggest to attain that end? “The fault lies in the spirit of the times, which is reflected in the way we educate architectural students,” went on Mr. Bellows. “Schools of architecture teach conventional architecture, period architecture. I do not believe in education as an end, so much as in the opportunity for men of imagination to have opportunity. But your schools of architecture interfere with such an opportunity. If an architect tried to create something independent of “periods” he would have a hard time to place his work. And yet all the possibilities of significant form have not been exhausted, have they?” We had to admit they have not. “Why, then, should architects worship the ‘period’ as they do?” questioned Mr. Bellows. “If there are further significant forms to be originated, and every one agrees that there are, I can see no reason why we are bound to the existing forms and scorn any attempt to create the new, the original.\n\nThere are two rather distinct spirits in which a painting is created,” continued Mr. Bellows. “One has a very decided relation to architecture, the other does not necessarily have such a relation. The mural decoration per se is essentially painted for a certain place. Other picture forms are not. In the latter case, which is the infinitely larger of the two classes, an artist may be said to be fundamentally interested in developing an arbitrary space to the profoundest condition of beauty of which he is capable. This cannot be considered, then, as essentially a decoration for a wall, but must be regarded and looked at for itself alone as a thing complete. Almost we might say in the spirit of a book, the color of whose cover is the only relation to the room in which it is placed. An oil painting in particular can only be at its best under a light that gives its exact values and therefore people to whom paintings are precious must take the greatest care to arrange for such conditions. On the other hand, the mural decoration can be created by a master without these limitations affecting his spirit. A profound understanding of space can free the painter from this one genuine limitation. The other limitations, which in our day tend to spoil and make common the mural decoration, are artificial, man-made dogmas and the limiting of the artist from the point of view of subject matter, morality, etc.\n\n“On the other hand, a large percentage of architectural works must be limited by utility. These limitations seem to be even greater for the architect than for the painter in present day life. But these limitations need not prevent an architect from creating beautiful proportions among the utilities in space and texture and color. I feel that the architects themselves have been largely guilty for allowing the fashions of the past to become the fashions of the present. It is really a platitude to say that all living art is of its own time, expressive of the finest spiritual and even material necessities of its own people. It is not the expensive material that counts. But it is the men who sense the proper proportions and understand space itself that make great architects.”\n\nWhile every artist will agree that a painting may be said to have utility in a certain sense, the utility of a painting is not its essential characteristic, while the utility of a work of architecture is. Thus Mr. Bellows may say that each picture should be thought of for itself specifically, without relation to its surroundings. People speak of pictures in the home as spots of color on the wall. That is not their primary function in Mr. Bellow’s estimation. A painting may be a decoration on the wall, but it is not necessarily so. A picture, as he understands it, is a human document of the artist, and may be as little decorative as a book; the binding may or may not be decorative, but even if it is, the decorative aspect is not the prime function. One looks at etchings frequently in portfolios, isolated from their surroundings. They are beautiful in themselves. The proper attitude, Mr. Bellows maintains, is to consider nothing but the picture, not its proposed environment. If it is right it is right. It is not valueless because one cannot find a good place for it. It is a work of art, anyway.\n\nThis, related to architecture, would mean that the architect would create something subjective as “a human document” without relation to the purposes of the structure or its environment. Just what would happen if architects were to dot the landscape with works of art that have no relation to their surroundings is something that affords interesting speculation. Is it better to put a fairly dull, trivial structure in an unimportant locality for the sake of maintaining the present character, or should an architect take it upon himself to alter the character of the neighborhood by the construction of something very fine too fine like a prince among paupers. Here the proprieties war with the impulse to be free of past traditions and to express courageously one’s original ideas and individuality. Should one express oneself frankly despite another’s feelings? Need the architect of originality have his way, and compel the public to view his obtrusive personality as manifested in an overassertive building? Mr. Bellows believes that the artist-architect would be creating a landscape just as a painter creates a landscape he would do what he could to enhance its beauty. What that “what” would be is debatable.\n\nBut Mr. Bellows feels insistently that art must be original. The harking back to Greek and Roman models for today’s buildings should not, he believes, be countenanced. The machine education of the present generation is so readily obtained that it leads to mediocrity. It is no longer unusual to meet people who have a college degree. It is that very commonness of education that makes it mediocre. The man who is to be beyond the average must go very much further.\n\nThe first thing a student should learn, advises Mr. Bellows, is that all education that amounts to anything is self-education. Teachers, college, books these are only the opportunity for education. They are not education per se. Mr. Bellow’s own example is pertinent, and shows how well he practices what he preaches. As a college student, he cared nothing for the large train of compulsory subjects unless they appeared relevant to what he wanted to do. To him it mattered only that he learned what he wanted to learn. Some things were vitally interesting. Others had no apparent bearing on his work and were duly ignored. “I made some mistakes of judgment,” confessed Mr. Bellows. “I overlooked some important things that I now realize would have been valuable. But if they are important enough I learn them now, myself, and by that self-education I have a workable, usable thing.\n\n“Forget the routine thing, forget the college degree,” he challenges. “The man of vitality is naturally self-educated. Education is largely personal. The young man with initiative will try to find a great man in his own field, will attach himself to him, will even pay to accept him as an apprentice, if possible, and will stick to him. But receiving education from a teacher has its obstacles. It pre-supposes that the teacher knows better than the taught, and the teacher therefore should himself do the great work, and be the great man, instead of attempting to instruct some one else how to do that which he cannot do himself.\n\n“You do not know what you are able to do until you try,” went on Mr. Bellows, now exuberantly explaining his choicest methods. “In learning a topic, whether it be painting or architecture or any other art—and the practice of that art is constant learning—try everything that can be done. Try it in every possible way. Be deliberate. Be spontaneous. Be thoughtful and painstaking. Be abandoned and impulsive. Learn your own possibilities. Have confidence in your self-reliance! There is no impetus I have not followed, no method or technique I have not tried. There is nothing I do not want to know that has to do with life or art. Any artist, any architect, can mold his ideas on the same method. One is not a good architect unless he is an artist. Otherwise he is a mechanic. Therefore, since he is an artist, why can he not very properly practice this procedure?”\n\nVisualizing an artist working out a picture “spontaneously,” we were caught by that word, and asked Mr. Bellows if spontaneity was not inconsistent with good art. He replied very forcefully that painting need not consciously conform to law. “Most so-called laws of the arts are dogmas. Rules and regulations,” he fervently declared “are made by sapheads for the use of other sapheads! Laws may be considered judicially. Certain laws are absolute, but many others are arbitrary. The absolute laws one is naturally in harmony with and will often subconsciously adhere to in spontaneous work even better than in deliberate effort, where there is not a profound basic knowledge. The arbitrary laws do not matter. They are human, fallible and disputable points of view. The academies and art schools are full of them.”\n\nBy this time we were sensing the wide sweep of Mr. Bellow’s thought over every possible phase and aspect of the painter’s art. If, to use the vernacular, he is disposed to try anything once in the hope of finding it valuable we thought we could help him by suggesting the Hambidge theory of Dynamic Symmetry. But along with the mass of pertinent information already stored in his mind was a full knowledge of and lively interest in Mr. Hambidge’s researches. “Some of the new things I have tried,” said Mr. Bellows, “have naturally taught me nothing. From some of them I have acquired knowledge that has been priceless. For example, many of my painter friends have scoffed at Hambidge’s law of dynamic symmetry as applied to composition. Now, I am not an authority on anything, but I must use what critical judgment I have up to my measure of understanding. Hambidge has shown me a great many things that are profoundly true, and I believe that any serious architect who will take the time to study this theory will be greatly helped.\n\n“I see no contradictions in Mr. Hambidge’s contentions, nor have I ever heard one that holds water. Ever since I met Mr. Hambidge and studied with him I have painted very few pictures without at the same time working on his theory. I believe it to be as profound as the law of the lever or the law of gravitation. No man who practices the arts, and this seems to be particularly true of architecture, can, with justice to himself, ignore the research that Hambidge has made. It has never been disapproved, and the artist has but to learn and apply it in his work to know its helpfulness.\n\n“It is the expression,” continued Mr. Bellows, warming to the subject, “of the basic working of the human mind. Geometry is the picture idea of the mechanism of thinking. Not only do I regard it as of vast importance and as expressing a fundamental natural truth, but even if it were not absolutely correct, it is anyhow useful to me.”\n\nAnd it is just in this way that Mr. Bellows emphasizes the openness of mind with which he attacks every problem of his art. The fact that a thing is old and has stood the test of long practice will not interest this explorer into the unknown realms of art, as much as will some new idea to which he may bring all the resources of a fertile and well balanced mind. If there ever was an iconoclast in art it is George Bellows, but he does not destroy from the wanton motive of a doubter. When he departs from convention he can supply a reason for such departure that is so sane, so logical, that argument is silenced. When an architect will have attained, through an equally well-balanced mind, the same dauntless courage and independence, we shall hail him as the Moses who shall lead out of the Egypt of adaptation and precedent the whole of his profession.\n\nAt this point Mr. Bellows took from a large case a number of sketches and in the most convincing manner showed just how he had in every instance applied his knowledge of the Hambidge research. “Look,” said he, “how it simplifies this certain difficulty of arrangement, how it releases me from a heretofore distracting factor, and thereby permits me to concentrate all my efforts on the infinitely more difficult aspects.”\n\n“If,” continued Mr. Bellows, standing in the middle of his studio, and speaking with the earnestness that characterizes the man even when least emphatic, “a thing is made easier by technical understanding, then by so much is it true that having this particular phase made easier, your strength is conserved for those things which yet remain troublesome.”\n\nThe logic of this is incontrovertible.\n\n— George Bellows’ “The Relation of Painting to Architecture: An Interview with George Bellows, N. A., in Which Certain Characteristics of the Truly Original Artist Are Shown to Have a Vital Relation to the Architect and His Profession,” American Architect 118, December 29, 1920, pp. 847–851.\n\nThe Relation of Art to Everyday Things: An Interview with George Bellows, on How Art Affects the General Wayfarer\n\nBy Estelle H. Ries\n\nTHE curious thing about conventionality is that everybody criticizes it with many lamentations, and everybody sticks to it like a nail to a magnet. That is, almost everybody. When anyone happens to pull away out of the field of magnetic attraction—”or distraction”—the world stops talking of even the profiteer and begins to talk of the non-conformist instead. Mr. Bellows is one of the talked of, so we sought him out.\n\nMany of us will recall that George Bellows is one of the younger men, he is only about thirty-eight, who as a painter has won almost every honor that can come to an artist. His portraits hang in the National Academy of Design. His splendid, virile war pictures won acclaim everywhere. His landscapes find frequent place in important galleries throughout the country. In all of them is portrayed the spirit of independence, of self-reliance, that dominates the man, and that has been at the bottom of his success. He was born in Columbus, Ohio, in 1882, and from the time he was five wanted little but to draw and paint. This he did, consistently and energetically, with the result just set forth.\n\nIf there ever was an iconoclast in art it, is George Bellows, but he does not destroy from the wanton motive of a doubter. When he departs from convention he can supply a reason for such departure that is so sane, so logical, that argument is silenced, and this we soon discovered when we talked with him.\n\nSince we ourselves know little about art, we first asked Mr. Bellows what should be the proper attitude of the layman toward art.\n\n“The layman,” he began, “needs first of all a change of heart. He should endeavor to experience a feeling of reverence in the presence of something he does not understand; to have a suspicion that a thing which looks ‘strange’ to him may have something to it that is really worth while. Any new and original work inevitably presents an element of strangeness, but that very element of strangeness may in itself prove fascinating if it will be thoughtfully considered. Instead of looking for the expected, why should one not find a far greater joy in the unexpected?’ Instead of going at a picture in a spirit of judgment, what a greater joy it is to experience the feeling of wonder! The joy of the child, you may call this. But is not the joy of the child greater, more joyous, more wise, even, than the cynicism of our pseudo-cultured adults?”\n\nGeorge Bellows has had the courage to break with the “accepted” tenets in art. Such an act has a broad application to people everywhere who desire to be distinctively original and to express their individuality without regard to all the man-made rules of precedent. What Mr. Bellows did in painting was not to discredit or minimize the worth of the great masters of the past, but, admitting their worth as enduring masterpieces, he determines to do something of his own. This we can all do in our daily work.\n\n“I have no desire to destroy the past, as some are wrongly inclined to believe,” he explained. “I am deeply moved by the great work of former times, but I refuse to be limited by them! Convention is a very shallow thing. I am perfectly willing to override it if by so doing I am driving at a hidden truth.”\n\nA painter, like folk in other fields, has a great wealth of previous work to draw upon. We asked Mr. Bellows why he had not drawn upon the work of men like Rembrandt and Titian.\n\n“Oh, but I have drawn upon them. Strange as it may seem to you, I must testify that I have often painted as much like them, and other masters who have moved me, as I possibly could, but with this reservation: I have wished to understand the spirit and not the surface. Possibly your question arises from the fact that the idea is one somewhat generally held. There are, of course, many famous artists who are very naturally considered by the more or less thoughtless laymen as great masters, while they are in reality nothing of the sort. I am naturally influenced only by the artists of the past who, in my opinion, are significant great men. In these judgments I am often at variance not only with laymen but with a majority of our fellow artists. For instance, I don’t think that Bougereau amounted to much, and it might surprise some if I claim an influence from Botticelli.\n\n“Every great master has put his heart and his own life on his canvas; he has fed on both art and life. It is easy to imitate, just as it is easier to enjoy inventions than to make them. If an artist has a sincere will to express his own life, he will not need to bother about his originality. If added to this he be possessed of rare personality, a man both witty and wise, a profound nature, in other words, he may well be called great. For myself I cannot know what of these I possess. I must take, develop and use what I have.”\n\nThen he went ahead and did it, and his present works are the result. But let it be understood that this is not to be an exposition of Mr. Bellows’ work as a painter. It is that his work is representative of a splendid attitude toward art and life that matters, and by that attitude he is enabled to produce really original work. How he does it is of undeniable interest, and he has frankly given of himself in this interview to place before us every helpful experience.\n\nWhether we practice an art, a profession, or a regular business, whether we are housekeepers, teachers, merchants, lawyers, craftsmen or anything else, it is our attitude toward our work that gets results. What George Bellows, by sheer grit and force of character, has done in painting, we can, by similar grit and force, do in our own work.\n\n“It is resolution and determination and high intelligence that make for achievement,” he declared. “The theory of standardization is one thing. It is efficient. But it is not beautiful. To standardize our methods is to court drudgery and monotony. It is to follow the wiles of tradition whether they are reasonable or not. It is to be conventional for the sake of convention, and to kill individuality and invention for the want of initiative. Standardize, yes, our purely physical processes, the unimportant details of our daily work. But anything that is worth doing is entitled to thoughtful consideration, and to standardize it is to rob it of that variety and spirit that make it worthwhile. Or if standardizing is inevitable, let us put it on the high plane of our personal endeavor and not accept the present standards as adequate.\n\n“If we must standardize let us improve the standards. Let us improve them to their very highest development and then perhaps we may justly standardize.” What, then, does Mr. Bellows himself do to exemplify this ideal? What is the secret of his success? With his trenchant comments on art and its wide range interspersed, consider Mr. Bellows’ own words. “There is no new thing proposed, relating to my art as a painter, that I will not consider,” Mr. Bellows announced. “The fact that a thing is old and has stood the test of time has always been too much a god. What should interest us is exploration, not adaptation. Take, for example, our interior decorators, our architects, our furniture makers and many of our better craftsmen. They adhere strictly to period style, to ancient and well-worn doctrines.\n\n“Now as for me,” he went on, “I do not believe in period style. It seems second-hand. All living art is of its own time. Period style is a reversion to past types. Period styles of the present day would be desirable and would vary with their locality. There would need to be no monotony. These styles, if they were devised, could be as glowing, as virile, as truly fine as any that we now worship, for they would be of our own time. We would understand them. We could do them better. They would have greater significance for the layman, for they would not be shrouded in mystery and obscure allusion.”\n\n“Then,” we prompted, “what would you suggest to attain more general initiative?”\n\n“The fault lies with our methods of education,” replied Mr. Bellows. “Take your schools of architecture, for instance. They teach conventional architecture, period architecture. I do not believe in education as an end, so much as in the opportunity for men of imagination to have opportunity. But your schools interfere with such an opportunity. If an architect tried to create something independent of ‘periods’ he would have a hard time to place his work. And yet all the possibilities of significant form have not been exhausted, have they?” We had to admit they have not. “Why, then, should architects, or any craftsmen, worship the ‘period’ as they do?” questioned Mr. Bellows. “If there are further significant forms to be originated, and philosophy agrees that there are, I can see no reason why we are bound to the existing forms and scorn any attempt to create the new.”\n\nThe harking back to Greek and Roman models for today’s buildings should not, he believes, be countenanced. “I am sick of American buildings like Greek temples, and of rich men building Italian homes. It is tiresome and shows a lack of invention. Greek temples with glass windows are foolish.”\n\n“How would you propose to get away from that idea?”\n\n“A new spirit of education,” answered Mr. Bellows. “The machine education of the present generation is so readily obtained that it leads to mediocrity. It is no longer unusual to meet people who have a college degree. It is that very commonness of education that indicates its mediocrity. The man who is to be beyond the average must have something more.\n\n“The first thing a student should learn,” advises Mr. Bellows, “is that all education that amounts to anything is self-education. Teachers, college, books—these are only the opportunity for education. They are not in themselves education.” Mr. Bellows’ own example is pertinent and shows how well he practices what he preaches. As a college student he cared nothing for the large train of compulsory subjects unless they appeared relevant to what he wanted to do. To him it mattered only that he learned what he wanted to learn. Some things were vitally interesting. Others had no apparent bearing on his work and were duly ignored. “I made some mistakes of judgment,” confessed Mr. Bellows. “I overlooked some important things that I now realize would have been valuable. But if they are important enough, I learn them now, myself, and by that self-education I have whatever culture I have.\n\n“Forget the routine thing, forget the college degree,” he challenges. “The man of vitality is naturally self-educated. Education is largely personal. The young man with initiative will try to find a great man in his own field, will attach himself to him, will pay him some way to accept him as an apprentice.\n\n“You do not know what you are able to do until you try,” went on Mr. Bellows, now exuberantly explaining his choicest methods. “In learning a topic, whether it be painting, or housekeeping, or building, or any other art, consider every method that can be followed. Try it in every possible way. Be deliberate. Be spontaneous. Be thoughtful and painstaking. Be abandoned and impulsive, intellectual and inspired, calm and temperamental. Learn your own possibilities. Have confidence in your self-reliance!”\n\nVisualizing an artist working out a picture “spontaneously,” we were caught by the word, and asked Mr. Bellows if spontaneity was not inconsistent with good art. He replied very forcefully that painting need not consciously conform to law. “Rules and regulations,” he fervently declared, “are made by sapheads for the use of other sapheads! Laws must be used judiciously. Certain laws, the real ones, are absolute, but many others masking as laws are arbitrary dogmas. The absolute laws, like gravity, or the law of the lever, one is naturally in harmony with and can adhere to in spontaneous work as well as in deliberate effort. The arbitrary laws do not matter. They are manmade, human, fallible, disputable points of view. The academies and art schools are full of them.”\n\n“So,” we thought, “are the general schools, the lecture halls, the textbooks, the correspondence courses, the magazine articles and all the rest. It is something to look out for, this discriminating between the true and the false.”\n\nIt is just in this way that Mr. Bellows emphasizes the openness of mind with which he attacks every problem of his art. The fact that a thing is old and has stood the test of long practice will not interest this explorer into the unknown realms of art as much as will some new idea to which he may bring all the resources of a fertile and well-balanced mind. If he can find any method that simplifies a certain procedure, he adopts it.\n\nAt this point, Mr. Bellows took from a large case a number of sketches and in the most convincing manner showed just how in every instance he had applied his knowledge of a certain abstruse theory that is proving of great value to thoughtful artists. “Look,” he said, “how it simplifies this difficulty of arrangement, how it releases me from a heretofore distracting factor, and thereby permits me to concentrate all my efforts on other infinitely difficult aspects.\n\n“If,” continued Mr. Bellows, standing in the middle of his studio and speaking with the earnestness that characterizes the man, even when least emphatic “if a thing is made easier by technical understanding, then by so much is it true that having this particular phase made easier, your strength is conserved for the struggle with difficulties which must always remain immense.”\n\nThe logic of which is incontrovertible.\n\nReverting to the attitude of the layman to a picture, Mr. Bellows remarked that people often speak of pictures in the home as spots of color on the wall. That is not their primary function, he declares. “A picture can be a decoration on the wall, but is not necessarily so. Very few paintings today are made for a special place, and when they are, they are on the average worse than when they are not. It is undeniable that works of art are sensitive to the settings in which they are seen. A picture is primarily a human document, a record of the mind and heart of the man who made it, of his limitations and his greatness.\n\n—Estelle H. Ries ‘ “The Relation of Art to Everyday Things An Interview with George Bellows on How Art Affects the General Wayfarer,” Arts & Decoration, The Joseph A. Judd Publishing Company, Inc. Vol. 15 No. 3, July, 1921, pages 158–159, 202.\n\nAn Ideal Exhibition\n\nEditor American Art News.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRobert Henri’s recent (December) article in ‘Arts and Decoration” has elicited some attention from the press and much enthusiastic appreciation among many of the artists. I feel, at the idea should be given the very widest publicity and I therefore hope that through your valuable periodical attention may be called to the matter.\n\nMr. Arthur Hoeber in the “Globe” of Dec. 8 devoted his department to a discussion of the prints made by Mr. Henri and ‘exclaimed’ a number of criticisms which are perhaps typical of the contrary point of view.\n\nSelf Judging Groups.\n\n“I will not recapitulate the points made by Mr. Henri or the exceptions taken by Mr. Hoeber, feeling that all those interested in this subject will have already given the article and the criticism a thorough reading.\n\n“It would probably be well for the general reader to state that the plan, opposed as it is to the present scheme in official exhibitions of accepting works on the judgment of one jury, proposes the choosing of confreres and juries (self-judging groups) of mutually sympathetic artists of eight to twelve men, a round of groups to take their turns in the galleries, allotting definite and equally divided space to each group and each exhibitor for a period of one month, all exhibitions to change on the first day of each month for the season of nine months; no judgment or restrictions to be exercised by authority outside of the several groups themselves, except an oversight to the extent of preventing work being shown which might be legally or morally detrimental. Mr. Hoeber raised a loud cry that this is only an extension of the jury system. I wish to point out to Mr. Hoeber and to those who may have hastily agreed with him a number of considerations that they have either missed in Mr. Henri’s original article or on which the author may not have sufficiently dwelt.\n\nMany Schools of Thought.\n\n“There are in New York today, and this is a phenomenon which is ever and always present throughout the world, many groups and schools of thought, many distinct and independent individuals among whom philosophy, technique, point of view, and sympathies are either diametrically opposed or at least for all working purposes come pretty close to being so.\n\n“The National Academy of Design and many artists, not of the academy, are complaining and have been complaining for years that there is no adequate building devoted to the purpose of showing the works of American artists to the public of New York City. There is warm feeling that such a building should be erected and there is warm feeling in many quarters that it should, when erected, be better managed than our academy or any other academy has hitherto shown itself capable of managing such undertakings. This feeling has apparently been sufficient to prevent the academies’ acquisition of its longed-for public concessions.\n\nMutually Distinctive Juries.\n\n“Is it not obvious to all that any jury voting on the majority principle, if composed of men of diametrically opposite philosophies or taste, will be a mutually destructive one if equally divided? Artists are usually men of too much independent initiative for such an absolute condition to arise, but I have seen juries often approximate this condition. Some pictures will pass which are weak in every direction, but please everybody a little. The things about which the majority enthuse are accepted often with acclaim, but many works about which the majority have no understanding and which1 please the minority immensely are rejected, or, if you wish to quibble, ‘left unhung.’ It is also most important to remember that juries are selected and therefore colored by a more or less circumscribed body of men, and’ these considerations are, of course, based on the possibility that men of widely differing tendencies are able at all to find themselves elected to serve on such juries. Institutions are eternally offering the sop to radical men by appointing a useless minority to serve on juries always dominated by more or less backwater standards.\n\n“In my experience as an artist I look back on my own judgments of pictures with an enlightening interest. The meeting with men and with pictures, the opening up of new points of view, the discoveries of new techniques, the making acquaintance with more and more of the old masters, the suggestions and philosophies that I have come in contact with, have caused me to discover great beauty in certain things that hitherto I had failed to get. My outlook is continually changing. Many artists speak of a certain ‘high standard,’ but since they all fail to agree on what the standard is based it consequently does not exist. And I for one do not believe that any such standard can ever be fixed, even temporarily or in any definite idiom.\n\n“All artists are in differing stages of development, some in one direction, others in other directions, some far away, many rather close at hand; but the important fact is this, that with many roads to follow and infinite trails to be cut, many are not taken and no man can follow them all. One body of men, one official jury, will therefore never succeed even in approximating a just presentation of contemporary painting. Some other plan must be arrived at if we are to see represented in a fair mart under democratic conditions and under public or semi-public patronage the serious work of the artists of the day.\n\nHenri Scheme Simple.\n\n“Mr. Henri’s scheme is simple, and it has been put to the test and found to run smoothly and with a delightful freedom. At the MacDowell Club large numbers of artists have annually selected and been selected by mutual admirers in the formation of small, congenial groups and have hung what they themselves thought best after a thorough acquaintance with the work. Freedom has proved itself again. The exhibitions have been interesting in the extreme on certain occasions, the occasions differing, of course, with different people. Three objections which have been found in this ‘trial’ gallery, and which have kept it from being an astounding success, are objections that disappear with the blossoming of the plan on a larger scale. I refer to there being but one room, with the consequent feeling of the prospective visitor that as the gallery usually only presents one kind of thing at a time, it may or may not be the kind in which, for the visitor, interest may lie, and unless favorably familiar with the personnel of the group, in whole or in part, a visit is not attempted.\n\n“In the next place, many artists who carry the ‘official’ stamp of approval in the shape of honors, prizes, and easy acceptance do not care to show outside the glamour of officialdom or in galleries not devoted for the time to their personal glory and aggrandizement.\n\n“The third objection is merely the practical one of artificial light necessary in the MacDowell Club rooms.\n\n“A democratic public market place, such as is needed in this and every city for works of art, must not be entailed by official gentlemen who happen to work their way into positions of power and paternalism. Mr. Henri’s plan is exceedingly ‘efficient’ in the immensely enlarged opportunities of space, time, and numbers of artists given a showing, even if buildings already available were put to this use. It strikes the balance that we eternally seek between liberty and license, of freedom with restrictions. It is a plan which I recommend to the exhaustive consideration of all men interested in getting as big a slice right here and now of the ‘perfect state,’ or of Mr. Hoeber’s ‘millennium,’ which that gentleman feels rather hopeless about.\n\nWriter’s Jury Experience.\n\n“During the last two weeks I have served on four juries in three different cities, selecting works for our national exhibitions and the Panama Fair. I have seen things I liked immensely go down and out and things I disliked immensely accepted with applause. I am not a rare and strange individual; at least I find myself continually elected to such duties—fighting for what I believe in technically, or philosophically blurting out opinions, making enemies thereby; trying to push what I feel is important, making quick judgments under the rush of necessity—judgments I would often change had I better acquaintance with some of the hastily seen things—the whole business a helter-skelter of hit and miss, each man with definite or indefinite prejudices and limited understanding.\n\n“This is all unnecessary, not to say witless; so witless, in fact, that many of our most important and distinguished painters feel either disinclined to send or refuse on principle.\n\n“Time is needed to estimate any work of art.\n\n“Space is needed to show any work of art.\n\n“Congenial company is essential in the hanging of pictures together. Freedom is necessary for the development of all art: freedom to create and freedom to show.\n\n“Places in the Sun.”\n\n“It is not an answer that radicals and unique men may have the most open opportunities in private galleries. In a public institution all earnest men have an equal right to ‘places in the sun,’ and we all have a right and should have a desire to see the works of all men there. I do not believe that there will be any genius so rare that he cannot find seven disciples. This we may call the only restriction, although there is another and most important restriction not in the rules proposed. It is a fact of human nature that the mediocre or commercial person is never anxious to show with his kind, but eternally seeks the reflected light of those ‘higher up.’ There would be, therefore, the strongest retard put upon the works of mediocrity by the sheer weight of opinion, small groups of artists taking their turn with the public, a carefully considered choice of confreres and of works.\n\n“To galleries run on such a plan known quantities would attract their crowds, unknown quantities would attract the curious, the interested and the studious. Today every one knows what to expect in an academy exhibition or in an armory show. In a public institution devoted to art both should “To galleries run on such a plan known quantities would attract their crowds, unknown quantities would attract the curious, the interested and the studious. Today every one knows what to expect in an academy exhibition or in an armory show. In a public institution devoted to art both should be under one roof, with room, equal opportunities and a beautiful showing for every applicant, a place of’ constantly renewed and always varied interest, to which there would be no limit but the size of the building, which, when figures are consulted, proves surprisingly small for the undertaking suggested.\n\nMacDowell Club’s Record.\n\n“In a gallery about forty by sixty feet, the Mac Dowell Club exhibitions, changed every two weeks for a period of eight months, show approximately 1,300 works by 216 artists. With six galleries of this size and the time for each group extended to one month for the season of eight, 576 artists showing 3,456 works (room for six large canvases or more smaller ones to each) would be given place. This is hardly more than the present area ‘where the academy exhibitions are held, if as much; but, of course, we re confining ourselves to a consideration of painting only.\n\n“Finally, again, and most important of points, although, as Mr. Hoeber states, the jury system remains, it is a jury selected by the artist himself and, in addition, the artist retains the right and the opportunity of having a definite oversight in the hanging and display of his works. This plan works with out friction, without envy, without malice, or politics.\n\n—George Bellows’ “An Ideal Exhibition,” American Art News, New York, Vol. XIII, No. 12, December 26, 1914, page 2."
