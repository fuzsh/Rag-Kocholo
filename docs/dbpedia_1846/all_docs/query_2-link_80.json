        "text": "by Alethea Drexler, archives assistant\n\nmcgovern@exch.library.tmc.edu\n\nI hope you’re sitting down, because this post is gonna be a wild ride.\n\nArchivist Philip Montgomery brought me a stereoscope image a few days ago and asked me to find out whether the fact that the card on which the photographs were mounted was curved was normal, or whether the glue on the photos had contracted with age and drawn the card up. It turns out that curved stereoscope cards are normal after about 1885; the curve apparently enhances the 3-D effect when the images are seen through a viewer [1].\n\nStereoscopes [2] (notice the curved card in this photograph) or stereoviewers were a common form of entertainment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially before movies became widely accessible. They seem like a ridiculously quaint and simple concept now–good grief, they don’t even move!–but they were still very novel before anyone had any thoughts of images beyond the static photograph, never mind special effects. The two photographs on each stereoscope card are taken from slightly different angles so that, when seen through the viewer, they appear as a single, passably three-dimensional image [3].\n\nThose of us who grew up in the 1970’s and 1980’s probably remember the View-Master [4], which is a direct descendant of the stereoscope; literally, it’s what you get when you combine a stereoscope and slide film. My brother’s was red-orange plastic and we had Return of the Jedi slide wheels for it. We were into Ewoks[5].\n\nIf you’re really intrigued, here are some directions[6] for building a stereoscope of your own, and taking pictures for it.\n\nThe card Phil gave me predates Ewoks by . . . well, by a lot. The curve didn’t show up on the scan. It’s convex from the top to bottom (meaning that the top and bottom edges curve forward). The rainbow defects are reflections from the scanner light; the card and photographs are in pristine condition.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nSo, what is it we could see in three dimensions?\n\nClick on the images to see larger versions.\n\nThat would be a human evolutionary tree.\n\nLet’s take a closer look:\n\nPlease excuse that the enlarged images are fuzzy.\n\nThe original photographs were not very crisply focused.\n\nI’m actually going to skip a “generation” in the middle and then come back to it because it’s particularly interesting and deserves a little extra attention.\n\nTo begin with, this is obviously an early, and consequently not very complete, edition of our biological history. The first three “generations” are especially vague:\n\nOn the far left is Notharctus osborni, a fossil found in Wyoming and housed at the American Museum in New York. Notharctus[7] was a genus of early primate that resembled, and was an ancestor of, modern lemurs. Interestingly, the references I found to Notharctus osborni specifically were very early, 1917[8] and 1924[9]. Wikipedia has a picture[10] of it but no additional information.\n\nThe skull in the middle is Propliopithecus haeckeli[11] (spelled “Hackali” or “Heckali” here), found in Egypt in 1910 and held by the Stuttgart Museum in Germany.\n\nThe third skull in this image crop is Dryopithecus frickae. This one was discovered in northern India in 1924[12], although the first Dryopithecus fossil specimen was found in France in 1856[13]. (Incidentally, this also suggests that this particular stereoscope card is a very late one, since it would have to have been created after the mid-1920’s.)\n\nThe lowest branch of the tree reaches from the prototypal primate and anthropoid to the great apes: The gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan, and gibbon (the gibbon is hiding behind the Neanderthal bust).\n\nSplitting off just above the primitive anthropoid and terminating in a dead end is the branch of Heidelberg man and the Neanderthals. Current theories place Homo Heidelbergensis further up the twig as an ancestor of both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis.\n\nI’m having flashbacks to college anthropology classes, when I had to add endless genus and species names to my spell-checker so that my papers wouldn’t be seas of red, squiggly, underlines. Apparently “australopithecine” doesn’t make it into everyday conversation often enough.\n\nThe jury is still out on Homo neanderthalensis[15]. The poor Neanderthal has changed identities more often lately than the planet/ex-planet Pluto.\n\nThe upper branch moves on with Pithecanthropus erectus[16], the “Trinil Ape Man”. This species is now known as Homo erectus erectus, and this example specifically is now known as Java Man[17], which sounds like a flavor of Ben & Jerry’s[18] (espresso with dark chocolate chunks?).\n\nNext up the branch is Cro-Magnon[19] man, first discovered in France in 1868[20], followed closely by modern humans.\n\nI don’t want to dwell on it, but I think it’s unfair to ignore the fact that the twig bearing the “Hottentot” and “Australian Black-Fellow” splits off below the “American” and “Chinese” is, sadly, not an accident or an artistic convenience. Paleontology at this point still had a very long way to go in terms of scientific thinking.\n\nI learned something while surfing for references for this post: Cro-Magnon is defunct[21]. I grew up with the term “Cro-Magnon” and the idea that he was modern man (and, yes, I’ll admit to having been a little freaked out by the idea that that might mean that I, too, was a Cro-Magnon, when I was six or seven), but I guess I’m older than I thought because it appears that prehistoric humans have evolved since I was a kid. The current terminology is Anatomically Modern Humans or Early Modern Humans, although “Cro-Magnon” still refers to modern humans of a certain early time period.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * *"
