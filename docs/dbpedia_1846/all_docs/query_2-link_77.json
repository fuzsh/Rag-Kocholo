        "text": "Navy Lt. Dick Bowman writes from Hempstead, L. 1., where he \"polishes off a neat 30- day leave.\" He's in between transfer from duty, involving an address in Russia to another address unknown. Dick recently saw Ray Dau, now in Boston, and has heard from Bob Gensel, now an aviation cadet in Florida. Ray reports Dan Tenney still in trouble from recurrences of malaria picked up in the South Pacific.\n\nLt. Don Rainie is still assisting in the processing of troops for overseas assignments at Camp Myles Standish. Tom Todd, just commissioned from OCS at New Orleans, has been assigned to Myles Standish on permanent duty as assistant personnel officer. Don also reports encountering Bill Grimshaw, a lieutenant in an airborne outfit.\n\nHarry Hillman, just promoted to captain, is now reported missing in action following a flight over Yugoslavia on June 13. He was a pilot of a Liberator and had been flying in combat for many months. He has received the Air Medal and an Oak Leaf Cluster. Capt. Ed Giorchino was killed June 30 in a bomber crash in England and Lt. NorbertHamilton was killed in action in France on August 15. Complete stories on these two deaths appear in In Memoriam for this month.\n\nLt. Howard Ackerley is now a navigator instructor at Pueblo, Colo. He was reassigned there after eleven months in the Caribbean area on medium bombers. Tex Meyer, a first lieutenant, is a public relations officer in the Army Transportation Corps and was last reported at an invasion port in Normandy. First Lieutenant Herb Condit is assistant registrar and CO to the patients at Oliver General Hospital, Augusta.\n\nThis brings us about midway in this month's news, and the chosen spot for a note to the sixty per cent of the class whose doings always have eluded inquiring class secretaries. It seems to be a common characteristic among that sixty per cent, and probably derives from some kind of modesty hereby labeled false. My close friends, with whom I have corresponded to some extent since graduation, have joined this group since learning of my new work, and, although they continue to write, they now omit personal news, knowing that I would use it here. Now, dammit, let's start the new Magazine year right, and all you birds who owe me, or the class, a letter, get it going, and include your own doings.\n\nCapt. Hank Dahl wrote back in July from Great Bend, Kansas, enclosing news from SAE's. all over. Hank had been training for work with a B-29 outfit and was finance officer in a service group. His news included that of Capt. Keith Benson and RayHelm, both in Dayton; Keith as a finance officer and Ray with American Airlines; Lt. MerrillPrentice training in Alabama for overseas in a Liberator group; Capt. Dick Funkhouser instructing in four-engine flying at Homestead, Fla., and Lt. Wilson Flobr, now stationed in Washington.\n\nFred Michel, a new first lieutenant, is now in photo reconnaissance in the Mediterranean. He is a fighter pilot and has been overseas for a year.' He holds the Air Medal. S./Sgt. Allen Hessler, married in July, has been transferred from Camp Hale, Colo., to Camp Polk, La., in the breakup of mountain troops training recently reported. His total time, at Hale including training and instructing, was two years. Capt. Jim Tredup is back from the South Pacific and now stationed on the West Coast on temporary duty.\n\nThe following service promotions have been reported to the Alumni Records office: Major Hunter Phelan, Capt. Lloyd Blanchard, Lt. (sg) Charles Tuck, Ist Lt. James Darnely, Lt. Richard Glendinning, Lt. (sg) William Belding, Lt. (jg) Benjamin Bacon, Ist Lt. Stephen Valensi, Lt. (sg) Frederick Ewing, Lt.

Allen Hessler and Frances Winters of Denver; and Capt. Hank Dahl and Eudora Evans of Leavenworth, Wash., May 19-\n\nEngagements:—Those of Josephine Newton of Daylesford, Pa., to Lt. Chal Carothers; Alice Mac Donald of New York City to Capt. Jim Tredup; Jane Branson of Neptune, N. J., to Ens. Sid Phillips; and Mary Britley of Riverdale, N. Y., to Lt.

We record for the class, therefore, the birth of Alan Greene Mitchell on June 20 at Montgomery, Alabama. Pappy to this future Dartmouth is S/Sgt. Dick.\n\nPINS ON BROTHER'S WINGS at their first meeting in uniform. Lt. (jg) Richard Schumacher Jr. '39, USNR, congratulates his brother, 2nd Lt. Charles H. Schumacher '44 on receiving his commission at the Twin Engine School, Lemoore Field, Calif. Richard is stationed at San Diego.\n\nActing Secretary, 1 Terrace St., Montpelier, Vt."
