        "text": "I know that I am not alone in jumping for joy at the news of a new album from Andre 3000. üòé ‚ú® Like most of us, I was surprised and delighted to hear something new from such a brilliant artist. However, I was not prepared for the journey he took me on with this new album (all flutes and no rap) and the insights it brought up for me. Andre 3000 is a Grammy Award-winning rapper, singer, songwriter and producer known for his beats and clever lyricism. __________________________________________________________________________ With his latest release, he proved that it is OK to try new things, even when the world is expecting you to show up as the same \"You\" in updated packaging. This is THE most perfect example of creating something purely for yourself and challenging the status quo. Not only is he being true to himself, he is giving the world something NEW; something we didn't even know we needed. Fun fact: Aside from sounding beautiful, New Blue Sun is tuned perfectly to 432 hertz, which has proven to improve mental clarity, reduce stress and anxiety, increase creativity and strengthen the immune system. üßò‚ôÄÔ∏è Intentionality is everything.\n\nHaving a ‚Äòniche‚Äô doesn‚Äôt limit me. It gives me a framework to play in. My niche is currently: 1) Legacy Films - telling you or your businesses‚Äôs story cinematically (read: like a movie üé•) 2) Story driven social media videos for individuals and businesses Am I split down the middle? How do I focus? What I‚Äôm learning in all my business podcasts, articles, and conversations, is that it‚Äôs a great thing to have a niche. Be a specialist, baby. But you still gotta pay the bills. Ari Levertov asked if I produce animation videos for a client. Of course I do. It‚Äôs not my current niche but I‚Äôve done it before and I can do it again. There are two options: A) Promote yourself and say yes to other things if it aligns with your ways of working B) Promote yourself and say no to anything outside that. I‚Äôm still in Team A but I can see myself batting for Team B at a later date. So for now, I stand behind both of my ‚Äòniches‚Äô and I still entertain the random request. If the communication, respect, and budget are on point‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs make something awesome. PS - What about you? How do you feel about niching down? Are you afraid of focusing TOO much?\n\nThe talk today by Dr Darren Freebury-Jones was very helpful in restoring an understanding of Robert Greene as a significant Early Modern playwright in his own right. As students and scholars still wake from the lasting hangover-effects of bardolatry (spread in lasting ways throughout educational systems, and communities depending on many people with varied understandings and judgements about history), it's especially important to grapple more carefully with Shakespeare's contemporaries. One late question in the talk: Were Greene and Shakespeare really rivals? Or did they in fact influence one another in positive ways? Darren's discussion of this point was most helpful. However, I wonder, regarding special effects: Yes, it's true that both playwrights used special effects (such as the appearance of a ghost, or a divinity descending on a chair). But of these two playwrights, which recreated the story of the prophet Jonah, swallowed by a fish? (Greene). Which buried the Jonah analogy figuratively in a character's story? (Shakespeare, when Hamlet's off-stage sea-voyage involves a change of transportation, mid-sea, not from a ship to the belly of fish, but from a ship to the belly of a pirate ship, which brings him, like Jonah, back to his destiny.) Which would be more likely to have a lightning bolt kill someone to prevent an incestuous marriage? (Greene). Which may have been more likely to use naturalistic plot elements to show the consequences of such life-choices? (Shakespeare, in the deaths of Gertrude and Claudius?) So to that extent, I wonder if Greene's embrace of theatrical special effects was more thorough, and perhaps Shakespeare's more judicious? And if the contrast might be considered \"rival\" or \"competing\" approaches, perhaps not unlike Hamlet's advice to the players? Either way, it was a remarkable and most helpful presentation. I'm glad there are insightful experts like Darren around to help the rest of us overcome common myths and misunderstandings."
