        "text": "As one who has struggled intensely with scrupulosity, I can attest to the fact that it is a dreadful experience. Any seriously scrupulous person, I think, would admit that preoccupation with fear of sin, questioning whether this or that act was a sin, feeling at practically every moment a need for confession, etc., so engrosses him as to deprive him almost totally of any happiness whatsoever. Being absorbed in this way by inescapable anxiety, scrupulous persons become rather incapable of functioning normally among their peers. Worst of all, they become disinclined to the spiritual life. In short, scrupulosity is seriously harmful to the faithful who bear it as their cross. It is therefore extremely important that those who struggle with it are not left to their own devices. Through the practical advice offered here, I count this article as a way of offering them my help.\n\nBefore learning how to conquer scrupulosity, I think it is helpful to first really understand what it is. I found a marvelous essay on the topic for a college research paper that I wrote. The author of the essay, Fr. William Doyle, S.J. (1873-1917), distinguished between “two kinds of scruples”. There are “[p]urely intellectual scruples”, which, he says, “are really only doubts”. Harmless and not in need of treatment, they are scruples of the kind where, once one “become[s] morally certain that the act in question is not sinful, the scruple vanishes”. On the other hand, Fr. Doyle refers to “scruples which affect the inferior [or sensitive] part of the soul”. Emotional in nature and affecting naturally sensitive persons most often, they predominate over reason and completely distort moral judgement. They do this, Fr. Doyle maintains, through “the strong impression produced on the senses”, which draws “a force which resists the mere statement of facts” (Scruples and Their Treament, 2).\n\nThe faithful who suffer from these emotive scruples are in dire need of help. Thankfully, wise figures like Fr. Doyle have offered their advice to show them a way forward. In Scruples and their Treatment, Fr. Doyle offers five general “remedies” for those struggling:\n\nPrayer\n\nVigilance\n\nStruggle against Depression\n\nObedience\n\nGenerosity in Self-conquest"
