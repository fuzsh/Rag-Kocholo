Every country in the world and many islands, have their own two letter ccTLD Internet address, for example .NZ – New Zealand, .IE – Ireland, .HK – Hong Kong or .US – United States.\n\nCcTLDs are always two letters long and are generally managed and regulated by the respective local authorities. The requirements and restrictions of ccTLDs vary, please ensure you fulfil the criteria before attempting to register a ccTLD domain. If you’re unsure, you can ask us.\n\nRelated Questions\n\nWhat is a gTLD (generic Top Level Domain)?\n\nWhat is a nTLD (new Top Level Domain)?\n\nBrowse through the Country Code Domain Extensions\n\nHi my name’s Murray, your friendly local morepork.
