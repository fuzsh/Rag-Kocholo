        "text": "A top-level domain is the last part of a domain name after the last dot symbol. In the internet hierarchy, top-level domains are the highest ones in the Domain Name System.\n\nTake this mock URL “app.website.com” as an example. “.com” is the TLD, while “website” is the second level, and “app” is the third.\n\nThe independent organization Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, operates and oversees each TLD. It also allocates and manages IP addresses.\n\nTypes of TLD\n\nThe four types of TLDs are:\n\nGeneric Top-Level Domains: Also known as generic TLDs, they’re a popular domain extension that almost every website uses. They’re typically three characters long or even longer. Anyone can register these TLDs. The most common ones are .org, .net, and .com.\n\nInfrastructure Top-Level Domain: This domain is for Internet infrastructure only. Its domain name is .arpa or Address and Routing Parameter Area.\n\nSponsored Top-Level Domains: These domains are for specific purposes, such as government organizations or educational institutions. Eligibility is required if you want to register these domains. .gov and .edu are the common domain extensions for these domains.\n\nCountry-Code Top-Level Domains: Shortened as ccTLD, they usually belong to a particular country. For example, .us is for the United States, .uk is for the United Kingdom, .kr for South Korea, .es for Spain, and so on.\n\nHow to Choose Your TLD\n\nYou must choose the TLD well if you want your website to work. Here are some tips to consider in selecting TLDs:\n\nAudience and Purpose: Your target audience and website’s purpose matter when picking a TLD. If it’s for business, go for .com since it’s a trusted and recognized extension.\n\nLocation: Consider going for a ccTLD if you’re targeting a particular country. It helps with local search engine optimization if your website is focused on one area.\n\nBrand Protection: Register multiple TLDs for domain names to protect your brand. Other companies might register a TLD similar to yours, confusing your audience.\n\nSEO Matters: Choose a TLD that establishes your website as credible, such as .com. The more credible your website, the higher your rankings.\n\nYou don’t need to test top-level domains most of the time when you pick one. But if it’s about web development, you should test your TLDs if it’s accessible and functional.\n\nOther Facts About TLD\n\nNow that we’ve outlined the types of TLDs and how to choose them, we have some facts about TLDs that you should know:\n\nInvalid Domain Names\n\nThese domain names don’t follow ICANN’s rules for domain name registration. They often have spaces between the words and dots and have special characters, such as exclamation marks and ampersands.\n\nReserved Top-Level Domains\n\nICANN has set aside these domain extensions for future use or particular purposes. They’re not open for public registration as well. Examples include:\n\n.example: Typically used for examples and documentation.\n\n.test: Used for testing and documentation examples.\n\n.localhost: Reserved for loopback addresses to refer to the local computer.\n\n.invalid: Used in testing environments to avoid using actual domain names accidentally.\n\nInbound Links\n\nSearch engines usually use TLDs, and inbound links are a ranking factor. When the TLD gets fewer inbound links, it may be perceived as less authoritative for a source. TLDs should have more inbound links, especially those with .edu or .org domains, to be considered trustworthy.\n\nManaging Domains\n\nICANN has the authority for TLDs, while the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority manages IP addresses, and the Internet Engineering Task Force sets standard operating internet protocols. The latter two don’t manage TLDs.\n\nLet Us Help You with Domains\n\nTLDs are the last string of characters in a website’s URL. It’s an indicator of a website’s purpose and identifies the type of organization the website belongs to. When choosing a TLD, determine the website’s purpose and register many TLDs to protect your brand."
