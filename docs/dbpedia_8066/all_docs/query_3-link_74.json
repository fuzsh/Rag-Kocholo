        "text": "The first step to crafting your digital masterpiece is choosing the perfect address for your website. And what better way to do that than by selecting the perfect domain extension?\n\nLet's start with the basics of domain extensions before diving into the nitty-gritty of how they work. The final piece of your website's address is the domain extension, commonly known as the top-level domain (TLD).\n\nWhat is a domain extension? It's the URL segment that typically ends in .com,.net, or.org. And you better believe that the diminutive suffix packs quite a punch. It's the address people enter to visit your site, and your domain extension tells them a lot about the genre and focus of your webpage.\n\nBut before we dive into the nitty-gritty of domain extensions, let's first define what they are.\n\nFor example, the most familiar domain extension is .com, which stands for \"commercial\" and is typically used for businesses and e-commerce sites. .org is commonly used for non-profit organizations, and .edu is for educational institutions. Let's remember the heavy hitters, like.gov and.mil, which are reserved for government use.\n\nChoosing the right domain extension can establish credibility and trust for your website and its purpose. For example, a .edu extension for an educational website or a .gov extension for a government website can lend credibility to the site. Additionally, domain extensions can also affect the SEO of your website, as search engines may consider the extension's relevance to the site's content.\n\nThe domain extension you choose is not just an afterthought; it's an essential piece of the puzzle. Make sure to choose wisely and select a domain extension that accurately reflects the purpose and content of your website. Surely, it's worth the extra effort.\n\nA brief history of domain extensions\n\nThe history of domain extensions dates back to the early days of the Internet. In the beginning, only a handful of TLDs were available, such as .com, .net, and .org. These were created in 1985 by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), responsible for managing the global Internet's domain name system at the time. The first-ever domain name registered was symbolics.com on March 15, 1985.\n\nThe original purpose of the TLDs was to indicate the type of organization that owned the domain. For instance, .com was intended for commercial entities, .net for internet service providers and network infrastructure, and .org for non-profit organizations. However, these distinctions became less important over time as the Internet grew, and the TLDs became more widely used for any website.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was created to take over the management of the domain name system from IANA. ICANN's creation marked the beginning of a new era for domain extensions, opening the door to creating new TLDs. In 2000, ICANN introduced the first batch of new TLDs, such as .info and .biz. These new TLDs provide more options for businesses and organizations and to help alleviate the shortage of available .com domain names. In the years that followed, ICANN introduced new TLDs, such as .travel, .jobs, and .mobi. Some were created to serve specific industries or communities, while others were for general usage. In 2012, ICANN started a new round of TLDs and opened the door for companies to apply for their custom TLDs. Because of this, top-level domains (TLDs) like .apple, .google, and .amazon were developed. This new level of online visibility and brand security was made possible by these unique TLDs. ICANN also implemented country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like.ca (Canada), .tv (Tuvalu), and .co (Colombia), in addition to the new generic top-level domains (Columbia). These top-level domains (TLDs) were meant for country-specific websites, but anyone can use them. For instance, the .co top-level domain (TLD) has quickly replaced .com as a favorite among startups, businesses, and entrepreneurs.\n\nToday, there are over 1,500 TLDs available for use. While the original TLDs like .com, .net, and .org remain popular, introducing new domain extensions and custom domain extensions has provided more options for businesses, organizations, and individuals to establish their online identity. With the increasing number of TLDs, it's vital for companies and individuals to carefully consider their domain extension choice because it can affect their online visibility and credibility.\n\nFrom a modest initial offering of top-level domains (TLDs) in 1985 to the plethora of TLDs accessible today, the history of domain extensions is one of gradual expansion and diversification. By allowing for the creation of new TLDs and custom TLDs, the Internet has become more flexible regarding how businesses, organizations, and individuals can create their own unique identities online. It has helped them stand out from the crowd on the web and become more easily recognized. Since the quality and popularity of a website's online presence can be affected by its domain extension, it's important to consider this decision as the number of TLDs expands.\n\nDomain extension meanings: Top 10 most popular\n\n.com (commercial) - The king of domain extensions, fit for businesses and e-commerce sites, the one that comes to mind first for most people.

However, with the introduction of new generic domain extensions, there's a new opportunity to make your website unique and memorable.\n\nHere are 5 reasons you should consider using a new domain extension.\n\n1. Improved availability of names\n\nWith millions of websites already in existence, finding a desirable .com or .org domain is becoming increasingly difficult. However, with the release of new generic domain extensions like .shop, .blog, and .app, it's possible to snag a catchy and relevant domain name that's perfect for your business.\n\n2. Better search engine optimization (SEO)\n\nGoogle has stated that they don't treat new domain extensions any differently from traditional ones, but having a relevant and meaningful domain extension can make it easier for people to find your website through search engines.\n\n3. Distinction from competitors\n\nWith so many businesses using traditional extensions, a new one can make your website stand out and be more memorable to potential customers.\n\n4. Indicate the nature of your website\n\nDifferent domain extensions can indicate the nature of a website's content or purpose. For example, a website with a .shop extension is a store, .blog is a blog, and .app is an application. Seeing different domain extensions can tell you what the website is about and what you can expect to find there. Just like how different colors on a package can tell you what's inside, different domain extensions can display what's on a website.\n\nImage taken from Project Puncline - a Strikingly user’s website\n\n5. Location indication\n\nSpecific domain extensions can also indicate a website's location. For example, a website with a .uk extension is based in the United Kingdom. With this domain extension, you can target specific geographic regions and build credibility with local audiences."
