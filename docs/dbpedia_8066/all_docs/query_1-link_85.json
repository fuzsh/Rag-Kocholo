You launched your business in your mid-twenties, a small restaurant serving your favourite dishes from your travels across the world. You wanted to bring a taste of each unique culture and experience back to your small hometown. Your restaurant is tireless work, long hours, and full of challenges - and you love every minute of it. Since your humble beginnings, your business has blossomed into not only a successful restaurant in the community, but the brand has expanded into a television show, recipe books, and more. You're a household name, and you always reflect where your journey began, right in the U.S.\n\nYou've strived to succeed and become the American dream story that everyone yearns to be. Your business is a staple in your community, your city, your state, and your country. Share that your business is open to the American public on a .US domain name.\n\nWhy own the .US Domain Name\n\nThe country-code top level domain for the USA. The global nature of the internet makes it difficult to know when a person or business is local to a visitor's home. The .US domain tells other Americans exactly where a business is proudly from. Plus, they’re short, memorable, and widely available, making them the perfect choice for your next domain name.\n\nA Little History about .US\n\nLaunch February 15, 1985, .US was the very first Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) ever released. It's managed by [GoDaddy Registry](www.registry.godaddy), an American technology company headquartered in Virginia, USA.\n\nRestrictions on .US\n\nProspective Registrants of the .US ccTLD will certify that they have a “bona fide presence in the United States” on the basis of real and substantial lawful connections with, or lawful activities in, the United States of America. This requirement is intended to ensure that only those individuals or organizations that have a substantive lawful connection to the United States are permitted to register for usTLD domain names. If needed, more information is available from the .US Registry."
