        "text": "The FQDN serves to show the exact location of a computing resource inside the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy. An FQDN is traditionally written as a list of domain labels: the top-level domain, the second-level domain name, a subdomain (if used), and the host domain, each separated by dots or periods. The label hierarchy is read from right to left. As an example of FQDN syntax, in the address www.shop.example.com the “.com” is the top-level domain, “example” is the second-level domain name, “shop” is the subdomain, and the “www” is the hostname.\n\nThe top-level domain (TLD) is the highest level in the hierarchical structure of domain names and represents the most general categorization of the domain. In addition to .com, other common generic TLDs include .org, .net, and .info. Country code TLDs are also used: .ca (Canada), .us (United States), .de (Germany).\n\nThe second-level domain (SLD) is located immediately to the left of the TLD. The SLD is typically chosen by the owner or administrator of the domain and is often associated with the name or brand of the organization, website, or service. The combination of the second-level domain and the top-level domain creates the root domain, a distinctive and recognizable address for accessing websites and other Internet resources.\n\nSubdomains are used to organize and categorize different sections or services within a domain and provide a way to create distinct namespaces and hierarchical organizations under a primary domain. Subdomains are often used to represent distinct services, departments, or sections of a website. For example, “shop.example.com” could be the address of an online store.\n\nThe hostname is the leftmost element of a domain name. Hostnames can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying web servers (\"www\"), mail servers (\"mail\"), ftp servers (\"ftp\"), and more. For instance, www.example.com is the address of the web server associated with the domain example.com. Hostnames provide a way to organize and categorize different services within a domain.\n\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages the assignment and administration of domain names and TLDs to ensure the stability and security of the global domain name system.\n\nTraditional domain names are based on the ASCII character set, which includes the Latin alphabet and a limited set of characters. However, many languages around the world use scripts with characters that are not represented in ASCII. International domain names (IDNs) address this limitation by allowing the registration and use of domain names in local languages and scripts.\n\nIDNs are domain names that include characters from non-ASCII character sets, such as letters with diacritics or characters from non-Latin scripts. IDNs enable the use of domain names in languages other than English and support the inclusion of characters from various scripts and writing systems, promoting inclusivity and linguistic diversity on the Internet.\n\nIDNs use Unicode, a standardized character encoding system, to represent non-ASCII characters. Unicode assigns unique numeric values to characters and symbols from virtually all the world's writing systems, allowing domain names to include characters from various scripts, such as Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and many others, beyond the limited set of characters available in the ASCII character set.\n\nIn turn, another encoding system called Punycode converts the non-ASCII IDNs into ASCII-compatible representations. This allows domain names containing characters from various scripts to be represented in a format that is compatible with the ASCII character set, which is traditionally used for domain names in the DNS.\n\nA PQDN is a domain name that lacks the complete hierarchy of labels necessary to make it a FQDN; a PQDN does not provide the full path needed to locate a specific resource on the Internet. Commonly, a PQDN lacks the hostname, so while www.example.com is that site’s FQDN, “example.com” would be that site’s PQDN. Most website developers configure their site’s DNS to redirect visitors to the same page whether they key in the FQDN or PQDN."
