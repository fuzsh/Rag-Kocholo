        "text": "Who we are\n\nWe are the .gov registry. We're a team of designers, developers, and product people. We help government organizations in the U.S. gain public trust by making .gov a well-known, reliable, and secure space online. The .gov registry is part of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nWhat we do\n\nWe manage the .gov domain registry. This includes the .gov registrar.\n\nA registry contains domain names and registrant information for a top-level domain (like .gov, .com, or .us).\n\nA registrar manages domain name registration.\n\nWe are the authoritative source for all .gov domain names and registrants\n\nWe manage the authoritative record of all .gov domain names and their registrants. We ensure that .gov domain names resolve in the global domain name system (DNS). DNS maps easy-to-remember names to hard-to-recall numbers. For example, this allows us to use “cisa.gov” instead of something like “104.106.178.124.”\n\nWe manage .gov domain name registration\n\nWe manage domain name registration for .gov. You can only request and register .gov domain names through the .gov registrar. We make it easy for eligible government organizations to register .gov domains. We verify the identity and eligibility of everyone who requests a .gov domain.\n\nWe provide critical infrastructure for governments at all levels\n\n.Gov domains are critical to providing access to public services. We make .gov a trusted, secure space by:\n\nUsing multi-factor authentication for all accounts in our domain registration and management system\n\nPreloading all new domains. This action requires browsers to use a secure HTTPS connection with your website. This ensures that the content you publish is exactly what your visitors get.\n\nAdministering our domain requirements to protect the integrity of .gov\n\nPublishing the complete list of .gov domains\n\nRecommending security best practices for .gov domain holders\n\nSecuring the .gov namespace with ongoing improvements\n\nFollow our product strategy and development activities on GitHub.\n\nWe offer support for your .gov domain\n\nWhat we offer\n\nDomain registration: Start a .gov domain request or learn about the information you'll need to complete your request.\n\nDomain name consultation: If you need help coming up with your .gov domain name, contact us.\n\nDomain management support: Once your .gov domain is up and running we’ll support you.\n\nCheck the status of your domain requests and manage your registered domains.\n\nStay informed about domain security best practices.\n\nEdit information about your contacts or your domain (like changes to your DNS settings) anytime.\n\nWhat we don’t offer\n\nWhile we’re continuously improving our services, you’ll need some services to get online that we don’t offer."
