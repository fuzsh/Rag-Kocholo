        "text": "The World Wide Web was publicly launched back in 1991, though it was the late 1990s before most of us ventured online. Over the following two decades, we’ve all become accustomed to typing in website addresses without even thinking about what we’re doing, or what the various abbreviations actually mean.\n\nThe influence of top level domains might not be obvious, but it resonates with our subconscious – and also with search engines. There are several types of TLD, including the little-used sponsored or test domains. However, the principal choice is between generic or country code domains (ccTLDs). The latter identifies a country or principality where a website is hosted, while the former can be used to identify a particular type of business. For instance, .au is the ccTLD for Australia, while.gov is only available to government agencies operating at regional or national level.\n\nCertain top level domains speak volumes about a particular business. In America, however, the .us ccTLD never gained widespread adoption. Because our businesses dominated the internet’s early years, the .com gTLD was regarded in some quarters as being suitably American. In reality, most countries have made more effective use of their ccTLD than we have, particularly in Europe.\n\nEven so, quirks have developed. The United Kingdom is dominated by co.uk ccTLDs, instead of the obvious .uk suffix. This was belatedly introduced three years ago, but it’ll be 2019 before anyone can buy a .uk address if it already exists with a different domain. The owners of a co.uk site have until then to claim the related .uk domain name for their business or enterprise. India has already gone through a similar transition, and co.in is gradually being replaced by the simpler .in suffix.\n\nBoth .in and co.in are clearly Indian in origin, and either will perform better in domestic search engine results than foreign ccTLDs. This is because search engines prioritize websites with a country-specific TLD when displaying results to audiences in that country. A .fr website will be of more relevance to a Google or Bing user in France than a .ru or .it site, and as a consequence, there is real value to selecting a ccTLD when registering a new website.\n\nIf you decide to pick a gTLD, there’s never been so much choice. As the body responsible for domain name ownership and management, ICANN has introduced over 1,500 gTLDs to the market since its inception in 1998. This has alleviated demand for the handful of non-geographic top level domains originally created, which included .org, .com and .net. Far greater availability has driven up availability while pushing down prices, and WestHost is currently offering .site and .online domains for a remarkably low $1.49 a year.\n\nMore recent gTLD releases can be divided into several distinct categories:"
