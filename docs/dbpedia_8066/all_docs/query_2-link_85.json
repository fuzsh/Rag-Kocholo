        "text": "Registering domains with RouteÂ 53\n\nTLD registries have assigned special or premium prices to some domain names. You can't use Route 53 to register a domain that has a special or premium price. The TLDs that you can register with RouteÂ 53 are included in the following lists. If the TLD isn't included, you can't register the domain with RouteÂ 53.\n\nTransferring domains to RouteÂ 53\n\nYou can transfer a domain to RouteÂ 53 if the TLD is included on the following lists. If the TLD isn't included, you can't transfer the domain to RouteÂ 53.\n\nFor most TLDs, you need to get an authorization code from the current registrar to transfer a domain. To determine whether you need an authorization code, see the \"Authorization code required for transfer to RouteÂ 53\" section for your TLD.\n\nPricing for domain registration and transfers\n\nFor information about the cost to register domains or transfer them to RouteÂ 53, see Amazon RouteÂ 53 Pricing for Domain Registration.\n\nUsing RouteÂ 53 as your DNS service\n\nYou can use RouteÂ 53 as the DNS service for any domain, even if the TLD for the domain isn't included on the following lists. For more information about RouteÂ 53 as a DNS service, see How internet traffic is routed to your website or web application. For information about how to transfer DNS service for your domain to RouteÂ 53, see Making Amazon RouteÂ 53 the DNS service for an existing domain.\n\nInternationalized domain names\n\nNot all TLDs support internationalized domain names (IDNs), meaning domain names that include characters other than ASCII characters a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen). The listing for each TLD indicates whether that TLD supports IDNs. For more information about internationalized domain names, see DNS domain name format.\n\nRegistering geographic domains with TLDs\n\nThe rules for registration of geographic TLDs vary by country. Some countries are unrestricted, meaning that anyone in the world can register, while others have certain restrictions, such as residency. The listing for each geographic TLD indicates any restrictions."
