        "text": "A TLD (top-level domain) is the most generic domain in the Internet's hierarchical DNS (domain name system). A TLD is the final component of a domain name, for example, \"org\" in developer.mozilla.org.\n\nICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) designates organizations to manage each TLD. Depending on how strict an administrating organization might be, TLD often serves as a clue to the purpose, ownership, or nationality of a website.\n\nConsider an example Internet address: https://developer.mozilla.org Here org is the TLD; mozilla.org is the second-level domain name; and developer is a subdomain name. All together, these constitute a fully-qualified domain name; the addition of https:// makes this a complete URL.\n\nIANA today distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:\n\ncountry-code top-level domains (ccTLD)\n\nTwo-character domains established for countries or territories. Example: .us for United States.\n\ninternationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD)\n\nccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic or Chinese).\n\ngeneric top-level domains (gTLD)\n\nTop-level domains with three or more characters.\n\nDomains that operate directly under policies established by ICANN processes for the global Internet community, for example \"com\" and \"edu\".\n\nThese domains are proposed and sponsored by private organizations that decide whether an applicant is eligible to use the TLD, based on community theme concepts.\n\ninfrastructure top-level domain\n\nThis group consists of one domain, the Address and Routing Parameter Area (ARPA)."
