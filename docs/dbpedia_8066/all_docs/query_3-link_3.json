        "text": "As a ccTLD, the usTLD registry is not bound by ICANN policies, nor does it currently have in place any accountability frameworks or exchange of letters defining any specific accountabilities. This said, we have great respect for the ICANN global consensus process and have implemented many ICANN- supported best practices on policy and procedural matters in developing the .US Top-Level Domain.\n\nWe have become a member of ICANN’s ccNSO, which is an independent process that entails developing policies that are binding for ccNSO members within the limits of national law. We will continue to reference and consider ICANN supported policies and watch with interest the evolution of policies and practices as the Departmetn of Commerce continues to define and refine registry policies.\n\nThe usTLD registry is deeply committed to ensuring the safety, security and integrity of the .US namespace and will continue to monitor and implement best practices promoted by ICANN and other industry leaders as we move forward.\n\nIt is the official country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the United States within the global domain name system (DNS). Just as .UK is the country code domain for the United Kingdom, .US is the country code domain for the United States. Country code domains are typically denoted by only being two characters. .US is overseen by the U.S. Department of Commerce who has contracted with Registry Services, LLC to manage the namespace.\n\n.US is the online destination of choice for anyone with a dream to chase, an idea to share, a cause to champion, or a business to promote. Whoever you are, wherever you come from, the .US community is the online place to share your story, think globally and connect locally.\n\nProxy, or privatized registrations, are not permitted under current policy.\n\nThe usTLD has an ongoing interest in ensuring that its top-level domain is administered in a secure manner and that the information contained within the authoritative database is reliable, accurate, and up-to date. One of the mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the .US namespace is the through the collection of true registrant information. The usTLD Registry employs an algorithm to detect the inadvertent or intentional registration of proxy, anonymous and/or private domain name registrations, and enforces a registrar’s obligation to not offer such services to .US domain name registrants.\n\nRegistrations in the locality space reflect the oldest part of the usTLD domain namespace. These registrations represent the political geography of the United States based on two-letter state abbreviations and divided further into localities, including cities, counties, parishes, townships, or local names (e .g., Alexandria.va.us). In addition to geographical locality names, the usTLD locality space also includes certain affinity names, for example, STATE, FED, K12, LIB, and NSN (Native Sovereign Nation). Locality and affinity names collectively compose the \"locality space.\"\n\nThe usTLD Administrator currently serves as Registry, Registrar, and Delegated Manager for all undelegated third-level locality domains (i.e. all third-level locality domains that do not have an assigned Delegated Manager) and their child domains (fourth/fifth/sixth level domains). Additionally, under the current contract, the Administator becomes the Delegated Manager by default for any third-level locality domain whose existing Delegated Manager decides to relinquish management of that delegation. The usTLD Administrator provides continued administrative oversight to ensure usTLD policies and requirements are met by both Delegated Managers and their locality-based registrants."
