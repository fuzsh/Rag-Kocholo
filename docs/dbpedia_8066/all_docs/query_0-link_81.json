        "text": "Although they are often overshadowed by generic TLDs (.com, .net, .xyz, etc), ccTLDs have always been available to provide a more targeted and local extension for your website domain name.\n\nWhat are ccTLDs?\n\nA country code top-level domain (ccTLD) indicates that your website is geared towards a particular geographic regions or country. For example, .us is for the United States, .uk – for the United Kingdom, .ch for Switzerland, etc. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions as the governing body that maintains technical standards that help run the Internet – publishes a domain list of ccTLDs available.\n\nBenefits of ccTLDs over gTLDs\n\nThere are several advantages to picking a ccTLD (country code top-level domain) over a generic domain name. If you are looking to target a local market, then consider going with a ccTLD too in order to coordinate your online marketing efforts.\n\nThanks to their local nature, country code TLDs boast a number of local market advantages over global domain extensions, these advantages are as follows:\n\n1. Improve local SEO and secure a top search position in local searches\n\nSearch engines like Google always try to serve content that is relevant to users. Along with showing sites located in the country of the user, they also give priority to websites using ccTLDs.\n\nThis ties into your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) value as well. Using a ccTLD gives you a higher SEO value for country-based search results. This is because search engines return different results, including many local ones, depending on the IP address of the person doing the search.\n\nThis is because a country domain is recognized by Google as the clearest sign of what country/region a website is targeting.\n\nThat said, ccTLDs are the most powerful way to rank a website in a certain country organically.\n\n2. They target local markets easily\n\nWebsites using their local country-code extension are approached with more confidence and trust by local markets. With the help of ccTLDs, you can target specific markets even if you are not physically located there. If you are running an international business and are operating in a completely different country, you could easily target that country’s local market by registering your site under the corresponding ccTLD.\n\nFor instance, by using .de ccTLD you could target customers from Germany, without being there physically.\n\n2. Inspire loyalty and trust in your website visitors\n\nA domain name on a given country-code extension makes prospects from that country feel safer to make purchases. ccTLDs are good for credibility and they give visitors to your website more confidence. Since they consider the website to be local, visitors may feel that it’s easier to make purchases, especially if they see that the address is somewhere that they recognize rather than a foreign address. Also, many people prefer to complete transactions and visit sites in their own currency, and region. The national aura that a ccTLD adds to a site may cater to users’ patriotism and make them feel proud they support a website that they share the same culture and language with.\n\n4. Domain name hacks to getting the name you want\n\nShort, memorable and SEO-friendly domain names are usually already taken with global TLDs such as .com or .net. And even if they are available, they are usually offered at an unreasonably high price (these are known as “premium domains”).\n\nA clever trick that some companies have been using to build a strong brand around their domain name is using what’s known as a domain hack. This is when a word or name is formed using both the domain name and ccTLD together. For example, mov.ie uses the Ireland ccTLD, and press.in uses the Indian ccTLD. It can even be a phrase or call to action like check.in or save.us. There really are no limits to the variety of combinations you can come up with! Keep in mind that Thexyz offers all of the above ccTLDs, making it easy for you to come up with your very own creative domain hack.\n\n5. Creative registry operator campaigns to promote ccTLDs\n\nAlmost every single country or region in the world has its own ccTLD assigned to the domain names system. This means there are hundreds of registries that are taking care of ccTLD management. Each of these companies has their own tactics and strategies to bring generic top level domains to the attention of the public and to raise awareness about their local market benefits over the generic TLD choices. Some of the registries stand out from the crowd due to their creativity and enthusiasm in popularizing country code top level domains (ccTLDs) .\n\nWe’ve compiled a list of the top creative registries for you:"
