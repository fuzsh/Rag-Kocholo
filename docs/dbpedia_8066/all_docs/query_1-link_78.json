        "text": "A domain name is basically your address name on the web, or alternatively said the URL that people type in the browser to access your website. An example would be the domain name for our site is https://www.fastcomet.com/. Having a custom domain name gives your site the desired professional look, while also improving your brand identity, and helping visitors find you on the Internet.\n\nEven if you do not have a website, it is not a bad idea to register your branded domain name when you are certain about it, before someone else beats you to the punch.\n\nOf course! When registering a domain name, you are considered as the official domain name owner. At any time you can decide whether to switch registrar that suits your requirements better. There are many people that initially register their domain names with one web host and end up switching to another.\n\nWe offer a simple and straightforward transferring process, which ensures that your domain is transferred as quickly and effortlessly as possible. Besides the free perks that come with each domain registered with us, there are even more incentives to transfer your existing domain to FastComet:\n\nThe transfer process of your domain name with FastComet is entirely free of charge;\n\nYou can have everything centralized and manage your entire experience from the one place - both your domain and hosting services;\n\nWe will renew it for you for one year free of charge.\n\nHowever, your registered domain name has to meet some requirements. Follow our Domain Transfer step-by-step tutorial if you want to move over your domain. It’s easy to get started and we provide all of the information you’ll need to walk you through the process.\n\nAnyone that registers a domain name is required by the domain name regulator ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) to create a public record of domain ownership and the personal contact information of the Registrant in the Whois Search Directory. The WHOIS listing is a database of all registered domains. It’s searchable and available to everyone on the Internet. Without domain privacy (also referred to as WHOIS privacy protection), your entire contact information (address, phone number, name, etc.) is publicly available. Additionally, your domain name expirations, renewal and other essential data used for legal purposes will be shown. This means that hackers, telemarketers, and spammers will be able to access the addresses and phone numbers of any domain registrant.\n\nDomain ID protection (aka Whois privacy) puts your personal data with that of your official domain registry under a cloak of invisibility and hides it from the Whois database, which is globally accessible, masking it with generic data.\n\nThis service masks some of your personal details through the use of automated access points. The GDPR Whois protection is what limits a potential spammer if they want to access your first or last name, email information, and phone number by using automated measures (a.k.a. Port 43 Access).\n\nFor an existing domain name, if any one of the Registrant, Admin, Tech and Billing contacts are confirmed as being from the EU, we would mask the WHOIS output. The masking is done using placeholder details in substitution of users' personal info.\n\nCustomers from all European Economic Area (EEA) countries get to choose whether to enable or disable their GDPR Protection. The GDPR Protection is what masks a customer’s WHOIS information to comply with the GDPR requirements, from their Client Area. Nevertheless, GDPR Protection will be enabled by default for all EEA customers.\n\nKeep note that some TLD registries often display customer WHOIS details. It's also important to know that the GDPR Protection will not be available for some new and existing TLD registrations. As of May 17, 2017, these TLDs are : .AU, .BR, .CA, .CN (2nd and 3rd level), .DE (2nd and 3rd level), .EC (2nd and 3rd level), .EU, .RU (2nd and 3rd level), .UK (2nd and 3rd level), .US, .ECO, .JOBS, .NGO/.ONG, .NYC and .TEL.\n\nThe personal data of all EEA (European Economic Area) customers is hidden under GDPR Protection by default. However, the Domain privacy (ID Protect) remains as an optional purchase for all EEA registrants. Keep note that the GDPR Protection will only mask EEA registrants' data. It won't replace any emails to the registrant.\n\nThe ID Protect continues to be beneficial for all customers that are interested in having emails forwarded to them (e.g., for those interested in sales opportunities domains, transfer requests, in addition to fielding other communications) without the public display of their personal data."
