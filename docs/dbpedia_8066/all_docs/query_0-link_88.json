        "text": "Why is it worth registering a .US domain name?\n\nIs the .US extension your preferred domain name registration choice? Grab the right .US domain for you through the full-featured web hosting services offered by NTC Hosting. If you have already found your .US domain, simply transfer it over to us, since we give you a powerful Domain Manager tool for total control over your online profile.\n\nWhat makes .US so special?\n\nAs a country-code TLD, the .US domain is not as restrictive as expected. It is intended for all US related entities, including not only United States citizens, residents, or organizations, but also foreign entities presented in the United States. The domain became available in 2002 when all second-level domains were released for public registration, adding more options to the available top-level TLDs such as .COM, .NET, .ORG, .INFO, etc. Before its official release, the .US domain was primarily used by governmental agencies. After the release was a fact, that tradition was preserved to some extent, so that many registrants in the USA preferred the .com, .net or .org extensions to .us. That trend has been interrupted in recent years when a growing number of US related individuals, organizations or businesses resort first to the .US extension for their preferred domain.\n\nHow to register a .US domain name\n\nYou can register your .US domain for as many as 10 years at a time. NTC Hosting now gives you the option to reserve your preferred registration for a whole decade to ensure security for your online presence. A multi-year renewal option is supported as well. We execute both registration and transfer requests immediately. Simply tell us what your .US name should be and we'll take care of the rest. Once the domain name is registered with or transferred over to us, you can start managing it with the help of our in-house built Web Hosting Control Panel. In there, you will have access to various custom DNS settings, such as A and MX records, CNAME records and much more, giving you complete domain hosting freedom."
