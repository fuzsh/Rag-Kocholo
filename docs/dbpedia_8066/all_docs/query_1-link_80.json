Notable examples are .US, .CA, and .UK.\n\nSome ccTLDs have become so famous that are sometimes being confused with gTLDs. This is, for instance, the case of the .IO TLD very popular in the internet/tech industry, or the .CO TLD that has been widely used as a replacement for .COM.\n\nnewGTLD (New Generic Top-Level Domains): this category includes all the new domain names that have been created after ICANN/IANA decided to open the application of new TLDs to the market.\n\nThis category contains hundreds of domain names. Just to name a few: .SHOP, .EMAIL, .XYZ, etc."
