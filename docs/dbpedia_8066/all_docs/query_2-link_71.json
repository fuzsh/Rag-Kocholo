        "text": "The internet is a big place, and every site needs a way for visitors to locate them. A site’s domain acts as its virtual address, leading people from all over the world to your site.\n\nBut just like an address, no two domains are exactly the same. Not only do they feature different wording, but they also have a unique ending.\n\nWhile you may have overlooked this part of the domain before, this ending is known as the domain extension, or top-level domain, and it’s an important part of determining a domain’s unique identity.\n\nWhat is a domain?\n\nIf you think of a website as a house, where content such as a blog, photo galleries, products in a store live, the domain is the address used to locate it. This is just like the street and number used to locate a house.\n\nWe’re focusing on the top-level domain portion specifically, but for clarity, a domain is composed of a few key pieces:\n\nThe protocol (such as “https://”)\n\nThe subdomain (such as “www.”)\n\nThe domain (such as Squarespace in squarespace.com)\n\nThe domain extension (top-level domain, for example, “.com”)\n\nMore on what a domain name is\n\nDomain extensions or top-level domains (TLDs)\n\nA top-level domain, or TLD, is the end of the URL, which follows the last period. These are sometimes called domain extensions.\n\nThere are many different types of domain extensions. Among the most common you may have seen are .com, .org, and .net. The extension for a domain can be up to preference, or be related to a specific service, business, or even location.\n\nDomain names are sold by domain registrars, which are like car rental agencies for URLs. When you get a domain, you register it for a specific period. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages much of this process, ensuring that registrars follow certain standards and enforcing the different types of TLD categories.\n\nRegister a domain through Squarespace\n\nTypes of domain extensions\n\nAs mentioned, there are a few different types of domain extensions. While .com or .net are generally up to preference and availability, certain extensions denote a specific service, associate, or location. Some common types include:\n\nGeneric Top-Level Domains (gTLDs): Like .com and .net\n\nSponsored Top-Level Domains (sTLDs): Like .edu or .gov\n\nCountry Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLDs): Like .ca, co.uk, ,jp, .de, .ru, and .us\n\nThe most popular top-level domains include easily recognizable gTLDs like .com and ccTLDs like .ca.\n\nA site with a sTLD or ccTLD will still needs to meet certain requirements, but a gTLD is up to your preference. Most domains for public use fall under the gTLD category, though this will depend on your individual situation.\n\nHow to choose the right domain extension\n\nWhile top-level domains used to have very specific purposes, many restrictions have been lifted as more have been created over time. For example, .io was originally a ccTLD for the British Indian Ocean Territory, but is now a gTLD due to popular usage.\n\nCurrently, there are a few factors that go into selecting the TLD that best fits a site’s needs. These can relate to the specific business type, branding style, or even just whichever one you think looks best.\n\nWhile many standard businesses and entities will likely use a .com, or .net domain, some things to consider when determining the extension for a site include:\n\nYour site’s purpose: For example is the site for a business, or primarily informational? Maybe a .info TLD could fit.\n\nYour brand’s style: If your brand is more serious or professional, a .com or other standard TLD is more fitting than something like .party.\n\nThe target audience of your site or business: Similar to your brand style, it’s important to know what your ideal visitor will respond to best.\n\nWhether this is a nonprofit: .org is a common TLD for nonprofits, though it’s available for anyone to use. Depending on your organization, you might qualify for a .ngo or .ong TLD, but there are restrictions.\n\nThe type of service or product: For example, a restaurant might choose a .food or .pizza TLD.\n\nYour global location: Some TLDs are more common in certain locations, like .jp for Japanese websites or .ca in Canada.\n\nYour budget: Domains and TLDs are relatively inexpensive, but some cost more than others.\n\nWith the above in mind, if you run an eccentric shoe-making business for example, registering a .shoes domain could be memorable and simple.\n\nLearn how to choose a domain name\n\nDoes the TLD affect SEO?\n\nSpeaking of being able to remember or locate a site, top-level domains do not directly affect a site’s search engine optimization (SEO) ranking. However, complicated TLDs can prevent visitors from successfully searching for and finding your site. If a domain name is difficult to remember, it will likely be difficult to search for as well.\n\nChoosing a TLD that makes your site seem less trustworthy or legitimate can also impact your SEO. This isn’t likely to impact your site if you follow best practices, but if you choose a less common or recognizable TLD, people may be less likely to click on it, which can lower your search ranking.\n\nWhen registering a domain we recommend picking something easy to pronounce and remember, such as your name, or your business name.\n\nLearn more about optimizing your website’s SEO\n\nCan you use more than one domain extension for a single site?\n\nYes, any site can have multiple domains pointing to it, including variations with a different TLD. This is something business owners and brands do if someone else originally owned the domain they wanted. Once they’re able to claim it, they can own it and redirect it to their current website domain.\n\nOther business owners might want to have a more playful domain name, but hold onto a more standard TLD to be safe. So for that shoe brand owner above, it could be helpful to register a standard .com domain, but also the .shoes TLD to help keep their site easy to discover."
