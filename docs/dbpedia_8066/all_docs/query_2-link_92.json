        "text": ".com is the most popular top level Domain address\n\nIn the early days of the Internet, sites with .com addresses were businesses with the intent of selling something, either directly or indirectly. The .com suffix contrasts with .net, .gov, .edu and .org, which represent networking, government, education and organization entities.\n\nOnce Internet access spread across the globe, dot-com lost its meaning as a commercial designator. Today, anyone can purchase a URL with a .com top-level domain for any purpose.\n\nAlthough there is no technical difference between sites with different Top Level Domains, a .com URL is generally seen as more reputable than some other top-level domains, such as .info or .biz.\n\nThe .com at the end of the most popular web addresses (such as rshweb.com) is called a Top Level Domain Name. The .com ending is the world's most common generic top-level domain.\n\nThe .com TLD represents commercial, which conveys the type of content that's being published. It differs from other top-level domains that are meant for content that is more specific, such as .mil for U.S. military websites and .edu for educational websites.\n\nUsing a .com URL will not offer any special significance other than perception. When someone sees a .com address, they immediately assume it is a serious website because it is the most common TLD. However, it has no technical differences over any other Top-Level domains.\n\nHistory of .COM\n\nThe domain was originally administered by the United States Department of Defense. It was introduced as one of the first top-level domains (TLDs) when the Domain Name System was first implemented for use on the Internet in January 1985.\n\nThe .com was originally created to represent the “Commercial” intent of a Website\n\nThe first .com was claimed on March 15, 1985, by a computer manufacturer called Symbolics, Inc. Prior to this, the Internet was largely a project driven by universities and computer scientists who used the network for research and communication. As more people and institutions began to use the network, electronic communications became increasingly challenging. Figuring out how to manually route messages through gateways was something of an art form and as email loads became heavier, and people would be asked to stop using their connections.\n\nRegistering a .Com Website\n\nSix top-level domains categorized the first websites that were around at the inception of the World Wide Web. Addresses ending in .com were meant for website publishers who were trying to profit through their services in a Commercial type business\n\nThe original six are listed as.\n\n.com - Commercial\n\n.net - Networking\n\n.org - Organization\n\n.edu - Education\n\n.gov - Government\n\n.mil - Military.\n\nBuying a .Com Website\n\nDomain Registrars register or reserve Domain Names. General registrars let you choose any available TLD when you buy a domain name. In most cases, you can buy a domain name relatively inexpensively, but some highly desirable domain name extensions are available only at top-dollar prices\n\nSome of these highly desirable domains are\n\n.audio - $114.99 a year\n\n.blackfriday - $114.99 a year\n\n.sucks - $218.99 a year\n\n.hosting - $329.99 a year\n\n.flowers - $114.99 a year\n\n.game - $329.99 a year\n\n.hiv - $195.99 a year\n\n.juegos - $329.99 a year\n\n.security - $2,079.99 a year.\n\nOther Top-Level Domains\n\nThere are literary hundreds of Top-level domains and millions of websites.\n\nHaving a .com Domain does not mean your website is a legally commercial and or licensed business. The Domain registration authorities have expanded their criteria to allow anyone to have a .com address, regardless of whether the registrant harbors commercial intent.\n\nHundreds of top-level domain names are available to the general public, including .org and .net, which are used to denote nonprofit organizations and network and computer topics, respectively. Those TLDs, just like .com, are also not limited to certain organizations or individuals, they are available for anyone to purchase.\n\nMost TLDs use three letters, but there are also two-letter TLDs called country code top-level domains, or ccTLDs\n\nSome examples include\n\nFor a complete list of Internet top-level domains, see the WorldStandards.eu website.\n\nOther TLDs that are similar to .com may be sponsored or have certain restrictions on registration or use. The Root Zone Database page on the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority website serves as a master index of all the TLDs.\n\nDomain Name Search\n\nFind out instantly if your Domain Name is available. Then register it before someone else grabs it.\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing a Domain Name\n\nConsider using RSH Web Services as your Domain Registrar\n\nAnd with any of our Hosting Accounts, Domain Names are included at no extra charge.\n\nTweet Share Pin Email."
