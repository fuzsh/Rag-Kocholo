        "text": "It should be easy to identify governments on the internet and — as the U.S. federal government says on many of its websites like usa.gov — “the .gov means it’s official.”\n\nProudCity recommends all U.S.-based government organizations adopt the .gov domain, especially as there is an increasing need for the public to trust reliable information and its source.\n\nFrom the U.S. federal government:\n\n.gov is Secure.\n\nThe General Services Administration (GSA) oversees the security of the .gov infrastructure and facilitates reporting of potential security incidents to your domain points of contact\n\nUnlike any other top-level domain (TLD), we conduct HSTS preloading, ensuring use of HTTPS servers, reducing your chances of being phished or routed through a foreign website\n\n.gov is Trusted.\n\nWe manage the .gov TLD, which is exclusive to U.S. government organizations\n\nWe support all official U.S. government organizations, including federal, state, city, and county governments, native sovereign nations (NSN), and interstate and independent intrastate government organizations\n\nA .gov domain name lends legitimacy to your websites and online tools, and helps your customers trust that your content is official\n\n.gov is Authoritative.\n\nWe host the .gov domain registry and registrar, where .gov domains are housed & managed\n\nWe serve as the policy authority for .gov, overseeing the issuance of .gov domain names, i.e., evaluating each registrant’s authority over, and eligibility for, a given domain name\n\nWe arbitrate name exception requests, set requirements for a domain name’s continued use, and facilitate name transfers\n\nIf you are a U.S.-based government organization, get your .gov domain today.\n\nRelated"
