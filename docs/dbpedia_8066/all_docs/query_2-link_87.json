This ultimate guide breaks down what domain names are and how they work in relation to other important concepts such as IP, DNS and web hosting. We explore their components, the 7 types of domains and also the process and financial costs of creating and renewing a domain name.\n\nWhat is a domain name?\n\nA domain name is the easily readable name associated with an IP address that people use to access websites on the internet. For example, in the URL “https://www.bitcatcha.com”, “bitcatcha.com” is the domain name, aka “root domain”. Domain names play a critical role in internet navigation and website ownership by making internet addresses easier to remember and use.\n\nWhat is an IP address?\n\nAn IP address is the address of a physical server that is used to locate it on networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). In the context of domain names, an IP address is what the domain name points to, thus allowing browsers to access website data. IP addresses exist in two versions: IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses, and IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 is gradually replacing IPv4.\n\nWhat is DNS?\n\nDNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that functions as the internet’s phonebook by converting human-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. This conversion process utilizes DNS zones and DNS records. DNS zones are sections of the domain name space in the DNS, each managed by a specific organization. DNS records are entries within these zones that map domain names to IP addresses. Together, they ensure that typing a domain name into your browser directs you to the correct IP address.\n\nWhat are the components of a domain name?\n\nThe components of a domain name include the top-level domain (TLD) such as “.com” and the second-level domain (2LD) like “example” in “example.com”. Some domain names contain a third-level domain (3LD) component, which is often used for specific sections of a website, such as “support” in “support.example.com”. Each segment has a distinct role. The TLD identifies the domain’s type or geographical area, the 2LD typically names the actual entity or organization, and the 3LD typically designates a particular subdomain or department. These different parts are essential for structuring URLs.\n\nWhat differs domain names from URLs?\n\nWhat differs domain names from URLs is that a domain name is just one component of a URL. A URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and contains the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name, and the path. For example, in the URL “https://www.example.com/about”, “www.example.com” is the domain name.\n\nIs www part of a domain name?\n\nNo, “www” is not part of a domain name but instead akin to a subdomain. The www (World Wide Web) structure is commonly used to indicate a website’s primary domain.\n\nWhat is a subdomain?\n\nA subdomain is a prefix added to your domain name to create a separate address within your main website. They are often used to organize or navigate different sections of a site. For example, “blog.example.com” is a subdomain of “example.com”, often used to host a blog.\n\nHow do domain names work?\n\nDomain names work by associating a memorable phrase with an IP address via DNS. When a URL is entered into a web browser, it queries a DNS to retrieve the corresponding IP address from a nameserver. A nameserver is the specialized server that translates domain names into IP addresses. This entire process ensures that the browser can access and load the content associated with the specific domain names.\n\nWhat are the types of domain name?\n\nThere are 7 types of domain name:\n\nWhat is a generic TLD (gTLD)?\n\nA generic TLD (gTLD) is a top-level domain generally available to any user for registration without restrictions. Examples include .com, .info, .net, and .org.\n\nWhat is a generic-restricted TLD (grTLD)?\n\nA generic-restricted TLD (grTLD) is similar to a gTLD but imposes registration restrictions based on specific criteria. An example is .biz which is reserved for business purposes.\n\nWhat is a country-code TLD (ccTLD)?\n\nA country-code TLD (ccTLD) is a two-letter domain extension designated for specific countries or territories. Examples include .uk for the United Kingdom or .jp for Japan.\n\nWhat is an internationalized country-code TLD (IDN ccTLD)?\n\nAn internationalized country-code TLD (IDN ccTLD) accommodates non-Latin characters in TLDs, addressing specific linguistic and regional needs. Examples include .中国 for China and .россия for Russia.\n\nWhat is a sponsored TLD (sTLD)?\n\nA sponsored TLD (sTLD) is a specialized TLD managed by a sponsor representing a specific community. An example is .aero for the air-transport industry.\n\nWhat is a test TLD (tTLD)?\n\nA test TLD (tTLD) is a TLD utilized within controlled environments for purposes like software testing or other non-production uses. These are not accessible to the general public.\n\nWhat is a new TLD (nTLD)?\n\nA new TLD (nTLD) is a TLD that’s part of the expansion program by ICANN to increase the number of available TLDs in order to allow for greater customization and innovation in domain naming. Examples include .app, .blog, and .tech.\n\nHow much does a domain name cost?\n\nThe cost of a domain name typically ranges between $0.70 to $14 per year and the price of premium domain names often goes up to seven figures. The cost of a domain name varies by the following 5 factors: the domain length, domain popularity, domain extension, the domain name registrar (price setter) and whether any additional services are bundled with the domain registration. Most domain names renew at the same cost as the initial registration.\n\nCan I get a domain name for free?\n\nYes, you can obtain a domain name for free, typically as part of a web hosting package. Most of the top web host providers include a free domain for the first year. After a year has elapsed it’s necessary to start paying for the domain to keep it active.\n\nHow do I create a domain name?\n\nYou create a domain name in three simple steps. The first step is brainstorming ideas freely or with the help of tools like a domain name generator. The second step is checking domain name availability via a domain name checker. The third step is buying the domain name.\n\nHow do I buy a domain name?\n\nYou buy a domain name by registering it through a domain name registrar or a web host. The registration process requires you to pay a registration fee and select the registration duration (minimum one year). Most registrars offer an auto-renewal option. It’s important during the buying process to check that you have WHOIS privacy, which conceals your personal information from the public WHOIS database.\n\nWhat is a domain name registrar?\n\nA domain name registrar is a company that manages the reservation of domain names and assigns IP addresses to those domains. They help individuals and organizations secure their desired domain names by handling registration, and providing ongoing management services. It’s important to use an ICANN-accredited domain registrar for peace of mind when creating and buying a domain name.\n\nWhat is an ICANN-accredited domain registrar?\n\nAn ICANN-accredited domain registrar is a domain registrar that meets strict guidelines set by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Accreditation ensures these registrars meet strict data privacy and security measures. Read our ICANN-accredited domain registrar comparison to know which is the best to buy from.\n\nShould I pay for WHOIS privacy?\n\nNo, you should not pay for WHOIS privacy, aka domain privacy or WHOIS protection when buying your domain name. It comes free with domain registrations through ICANN-accredited registrars.\n\nCan I register for multiple domain names?\n\nYes, you can register for multiple domain names when buying a domain. Many webmasters do this to protect their brand or increase their online presence. This is known as domain parking and it allows you to reserve names without attaching them to active websites.\n\nCan I sell my domain name?\n\nYes, you can sell your domain name on a range of selling platforms such as GoDaddy Auction, Sedo and Flippa. The process includes setting a price, listing on a marketplace, and negotiating with buyers.\n\nDo I need a domain name for making a website?\n\nYes, you need a domain name for making a website. Acquiring a domain name is a crucial step in setting up a website as it provides a recognizable address that makes your website accessible to visitors once it’s connected to your web hosting via DNS. Maintaining access for your website audience also requires you to manage your domain name in the long term, which includes making timely renewals to prevent it expiring.\n\nWhat differs domain names from website hosting?\n\nIn the context of creating a website, a domain name provides the address, while website hosting provides the server space where your website’s files are stored and served. These two concepts are often confused so check our comparison of domain and hosting to better understand the differences.\n\nHow do I choose a domain name for my website?\n\nYou choose a domain name for your website by checking that it meets 5 criteria. First, check it aligns with your website’s niche or branding. Second, ensure it’s easy to remember. Third, avoid using hyphens. Fourth, use the appropriate TLD. The .com TLD is generally the best choice but a ccTLD may be more appropriate if your website targets specific countries. Finally, check for any trademark issues with your domain name.\n\nHow do I renew the domain name of my website?\n\nYou renew the domain name of your website by contacting your domain name registrar or web host to facilitate the renewal for you. It’s highly recommended to set up auto-renewal to prevent renewal lapses and ensure that you retain ownership over your domain.\n\nWhat happens if my website’s domain name expires?\n\nIf your website’s domain name expires, it gets deactivated and parked and this also stops associated services like email. If you do not renew it within 30 days, it may be auctioned off. If unsold by day 40, the domain returns to the registry. You can still reclaim it with additional fees until day 42, after which it is no longer recoverable and instead becomes open for new registration.\n\nCan I change the domain name of my website?\n\nYes, you can change your website’s domain name by registering a new one, pointing it to your site, and setting up redirection from the old domain to the new one.\n\n(Back to top)"
