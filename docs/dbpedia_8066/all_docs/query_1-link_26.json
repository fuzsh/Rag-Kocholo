        "text": "A ccTLD is a country code top-level domain â the last part of the domain name after the final dot â which acts as country-specific identifier. These internet country codes show the user which country the site is located in â or the locale the website is catering to in terms of language and/or localised content.\n\nThe origins of domain country codes can be traced back to 1985 when the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) approved requests by countries for the use of three cc TLD identifiers. These were .us (the U.S.), .uk (the U.K.), and .il (Israel). Sixteen more ccTLDs came online over the next three years including .fr (France), .nz (New Zealand) and .es (Spain).\n\nThe identifiers are based on the ISO 3166-1 country codes â though there are exceptions to country domains where ASCII identifiers are deployed instead. This includes .uk for United Kingdom (not .gb) and .eu for the European Union.\n\nOnly available to organisations that meet set criteria, an sTLD represents a fixed theme or particular community â such as a government agency. Only once final approval is secured can the organisation be assigned the sTLD. Examples include .gov (for use only by the US government) and .mil (for use only by the US military).\n\nÂ"
