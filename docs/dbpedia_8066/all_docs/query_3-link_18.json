        "text": "You must have seen lots of different Top Level Domains TLDs while surfing the internet, like: .com, .biz, .net, .io, .tech, and much more. You may know them as domain extensions.\n\nThose domain extensions/ TLDs help the visitor understand what your website is about. For example, .app tells the customer that your business is an application, .edu tells people you are an educational institution, and .io domains usually tell people you are a tech startup. And so on.\n\nKnowing the difference between those TLDs and what they stand for is very important when you choose your domain name.\n\nWhat is Top-Level Domain (TLD)?\n\nA top-level domain (TLD) is the part of a domain name that comes after the \"dot\" and identifies the type of organization or purpose of the website. For example, in the domain name in ae.godaddy.com the .com is the “.com” is the TLD.\n\nGoDaddy is the biggest domain name provider with 84 million registered domains and more than 21 million happy customers. Register your domain today.\n\nTypes of Top Level Domains TLDs:\n\nThere are several types of top-level domain names, including:\n\ngTLD - Generic Top-Level Domains\n\nsTLD - Sponsored Top-Level Domains\n\nccTLD - Country Code Top-Level Domains\n\nInfrastructure TR\n\neserved Top-Level Domains\n\nLet’s get into them:\n\n(1) gTLDs - Generic top-level domains\n\ngTLDs are the most common type of TLD and are not specific to any particular country or organization.\n\nExamples of gTLDs include:\n\n\".com\" for commercial websites\n\n\".org\" for organizations\n\n\".net\" for network-related websites.\n\nsTLDs are sponsored by a specific organization or community and are intended for a particular purpose.\n\nExamples of sTLDs include:\n\n\".edu\" for educational institutions\n\n\".gov\" for government agencies\n\n\".mil\" for military organizations.\n\n(3) ccTLD - Country code top-level domains\n\nccTLDs are two-letter TLDs that represent a specific country or territory.\n\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which is run by ICANN, is in charge of picking appropriate organizations in each location to manage ccTLDs.\n\nExamples of ccTLDs include:\n\n\".uk\" for the United Kingdom\n\n\".jp\" for Japan\n\n\".cn\" for China.\n\n(4) Infrastructure top-level domains\n\nInfrastructure top-level domains are used for technical purposes and are not intended for general use.\n\nExamples of infrastructure TLDs include:\n\n\".arpa\" for infrastructure purposes\n\n\".int\" for international organizations.\n\n(5) Reserved top-level domains\n\nReserved top-level domains are not used for general registration and are reserved for specific purposes.\n\nExamples of reserved TLDs include:\n\n\".example\" for use in documentation\n\n\".localhost\" for use in testing.\n\nNow that you know what TLDs are and what each stands for and which one your business needs it is time to get your own domain name.\n\n(6) Internationalized Domain Name IDNs:\n\nInternationalized domain names are domains with non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, or Chinese).\n\nDid you know that there is an Arabic new gTLD/new domain extension? well, “.شبكة” the first Arabic gTLD. It went live in February 2014 and translates literally into .web. It falls under Internationalized Domain Name.\n\nMost Popular TLD List\n\nWe learned the most common Top-level domains above, but those are a drop in the ocean. IANA updates the TLDs list on regular basis and you can view the list which has all the new tlds at any time from here.\n\nThe most popular TLDs are:\n\n.com\n\n.net\n\n.org\n\n.co\n\n.us\n\n.co.uk\n\n.xyz\n\nHow do TLDs Work?\n\nFrom a technical perspective, top-level domains (TLDs) are a part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. The DNS is responsible for translating human-readable domain names into numerical IP web addresses that computers can understand and use to communicate with each other.\n\nTLDs are the highest level in the DNS hierarchy and are used to identify the type of organization or purpose of a domain. For example, a website with a \".com\" TLD is typically a commercial website, while a website with a \".gov\" TLD is typically a government website.\n\nNote: Large corporations with regional sites that operate independently. In these cases, domain extensions serve the same purpose as a subdomain.\n\nPurpose of Having a TLD\n\nThe purpose of TLDs is to provide a standardized and organized way to identify and locate resources on the Internet. Without TLDs, it would be much more difficult for users to find and access specific websites or online resources. TLDs also help to prevent confusion and make it easier for users to remember and identify domain names.\n\nThere are currently over 1,500 TLDs available, including both generic TLDs (gTLDs) and country code TLDs (ccTLDs). The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is responsible for coordinating the assignment and maintenance of TLDs.\n\nWhich TLDs are Restricted for use?\n\nSome top-level domains (TLDs) are restricted for use and may only be registered and used by specific organizations or for specific purposes. For example, the \".gov\" TLD is restricted for use by government agencies, and the \".edu\" TLD is restricted for use by educational institutions.\n\nReserved DNS Names\n\nReserved DNS names are domain names that are not available for general registration and are reserved for specific purposes. These domain names may be reserved at the top-level domain (TLD) level or at the second-level domain (SLD) level.\n\nExamples of reserved TLDs include \".example\", which is reserved for use in documentation, and \".localhost\", which is reserved for use in testing.\n\nExamples of reserved SLDs include \"test\", which is reserved for use in testing, and \"invalid\", which is reserved for use in invalid or improperly formatted domain names.\n\nRestricted Domains\n\nRestricted domains are domain names that are not available for registration or use because they are reserved for specific purposes or are prohibited by law. These domain names may be reserved at the TLD level or at the SLD level.\n\nExamples of restricted TLDs include \".onion\", which is reserved for use with the anonymous Onion routing network, and \".local\", which is reserved for use in private networks.\n\nExamples of restricted SLDs include \"example\", which is reserved for use in documentation, and \"localhost\", which is reserved for use in testing.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions FAQs:\n\nSome answers to your Frequently Asked Questions:\n\nWhat are the 4 common top-level domains?\n\nThe four most common top-level domains (TLDs) are:\n\n.com - The \".com\" TLD is the most popular and widely used TLD, and it is intended for commercial websites. From an eligibility perspective, anyone can register a .com domain.\n\n.net - The \".net\" TLD is intended for network-related websites, such as Internet service providers and hosting companies.\n\n.org - The \".org\" TLD is intended for non-profit organizations, charities, and advocacy groups.\n\n.gov - The \".gov\" TLD is restricted for use by government agencies and is intended for official government websites.\n\nThese four TLDs are known as generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and are not specific to any particular country or region. There are also many other gTLDs available, as well as country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) that are specific to a particular country or territory.\n\nWhat is top and second level domain?\n\nA top-level domain (TLD) is the part of a domain name that comes after the \"dot\" and identifies the type of organization or purpose of the website. For example, in the domain name \"ae.godaddy.com\", the TLD is \"com\".\n\nA second-level domain (SLD) is the part of a domain name that comes before the TLD and identifies the specific organization or individual that owns the domain. In the domain name \"ae.godaddy.com\", the SLD is \"godaddy\".\n\nThe combination of a TLD and SLD forms a complete domain name, which can be used to locate and access a website or other online resource. For example, the domain name “ae.godaddy.com” can be used to access the GoDaddy website.\n\nThe TLD and SLD are important components of the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. The DNS is responsible for translating human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses that computers can understand and use to communicate with each other.\n\nWhy do we use top-level domain?\n\nTop-level domains (TLDs) are used for several reasons, including:\n\nTo identify the type of organization or purpose of a domain: TLDs provide a standardized way to identify the type of organization or purpose of a domain. For example, a website with a \".com\" TLD is typically a commercial website, while a website with a \".gov\" TLD is typically a government website.\n\nTo prevent confusion and make it easier to remember domain names: TLDs help to prevent confusion and make it easier for users to remember and identify domain names. For example, it is easier to remember \"com\" than a series of random numbers or letters.\n\nTo facilitate the organization of the Internet: TLDs help to organize the Internet by grouping similar types of websites together and making it easier to locate specific types of resources.\n\nTo enable the use of domain names in different languages: TLDs can be used with different scripts and languages, which allows users to use domain names in their own language. This makes it easier for users to find and access websites and resources in their own language.\n\nOverall, TLDs are an important part of the Domain Name System (DNS) and play a crucial role in enabling users to easily locate and access websites and online resources."
