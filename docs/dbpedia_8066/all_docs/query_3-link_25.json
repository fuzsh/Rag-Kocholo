        "text": "The Short Top-Level Domain Definition\n\nTLD stands for ‘top-level domain’ and refers to the rightmost part of every domain name. In namecheap.com, ‘namecheap.com’ is the domain name, and ‘.com’ is the TLD. If you’re looking for a TLD, check out our top-level domain list to see what you can register, or try our domain name search.\n\nIf you are brimming with questions like ‘What is the purpose of a TLD?’, our handy guide is here to provide the answers.\n\nThe Long TLD Definition\n\nIt’s now time to get started and define the top-level domain extension. Still unsure of what are top-level domains in a URL? Let’s use an example.\n\nConsider namecheap.com again. When you type it into your search bar, our website is being located by your computer, using the domain name and an IP address.\n\nEvery website on the Internet can be identified by an IP address, which is a unique series of numbers. These numbers are a set of instructions that allows a computer to access stored website data.\n\nThink of an IP address as a mobile phone number. While you may have ‘Dad’ listed in your phonebook, it’s the number that you ultimately use to connect with him.\n\nThe letters at the end of a website address are known as its top-level domain (TLD). They typically tell a story about the domain name associated with it, such as the geographical area it was created in, its purpose, or the organization that owns it.\n\nSo, what is an example of a top-level domain? There’s .ca for Canada, .biz for businesses, and .com for commercial websites. Interestingly ‘top-level domain’ is also known as a ‘URL extension’.\n\nAlthough the most popular TLD is .com, there are many others available, including .info, .dev, and even .pizza.\n\nThe Origins of TLDs\n\nThe original top-level domains were developed in the 1980s and were divided into three groups, Categories, Multi Organizations, and Countries.\n\nEvery original TLD had a unique purpose:\n\nNameEntity.comCommercial.orgOrganization.intIntergovernmental organizations.eduEducation.govGovernment agencies.milU.S. military\n\nThese days this restrictive practice has been largely lost, the meaning of domain extensions changed, and top-level domains are used in a variety of different ways. Domain registration is mostly open for all, apart from gTLDs assigned for the government, such as .gov and .mil.\n\nSo, what are a gTLD and ccTLD anyway, and what’s the difference between them?\n\ngTLDS\n\nGeneric top-level domains, (gTLDs) account for the majority of domain extensions. The most common gTLDs are .com, .org,and .net.\n\nccTLDs\n\nCountry code top-level domains (ccTLDs) are location-specific and are generally reserved for countries and some territories. Examples include .us, .co.uk, and .de.\n\nSince 2014, ICANN has released over 2,000 new extensions covering all areas from clubs and hobbies to industry, science and technology, and geographic locations. The addition of new generic top-level domains has taken some of the stress off the original gTLDs.\n\nInterestingly, the mighty .com remains one of the world’s most popular and most recognized gTLD, perhaps because it was one of the original top-level domains. Buyers place huge value on .com domain name price over the new extensions, simply because of its universal recognition.\n\nYou can learn more about domain prices in our how much is a domain name blog post.\n\nHow do TLDs work?\n\nHold onto your hats and let’s delve into the nitty-gritty of top-level domains. To successfully load a website, computers need to work through each section of a domain name to locate the data needed, starting with the top-level domain.\n\nThere are 13 root name servers that contain all the information for all of the gTLDs within that domain. For example, the name server for .com will contain information about amazon.com, but won’t contain any information regarding amazon.co.uk.\n\nSo who is responsible for managing top-level domains?\n\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) delegates the responsibility for the global coordination of domain names.\n\nA non-profit corporation, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), is a department of ICANN. IANA assigns TLDs with IP addresses, which are vital for a domain to be discovered online.\n\nWhat Types of Top-Level Domains Are There?\n\nIf you’ve been paying close attention, you’ll know that there are different types of internet domains, and you already know the answers to the following questions:\n\nWhat does gTLD stand for?\n\nWhat does ccTLD stand for?\n\nJust in case you missed it the first time, gTLDs are generic top-level domains, and ccTLDs are country code top-level domains — geographical domains that are associated with a particular area in the world.\n\nFor example, the TLD .de is associated with Germany, .io with the British Indian Ocean Territory, and .us for the United States.\n\nGeneric top-level domains are the largest group of TLDs and account for most of the newly available domains. There are older, well-known gTLDs like .com, .net, and .org, and newer options, like .club, .accountant, and .pizza.\n\nIdeal for companies and individuals, gTLDs can help you depict what your website actually does.\n\nWhat Are The 5 Most Common Domain Extensions?\n\nIn 2019, the 5 most common domain extensions according to Verisign were .com, .tk, .cn, .de, and .net. The .com remains the king of domain names, as one of the original and most popular top-level domains, it’s instantly recognizable.\n\nIf you haven’t registered one of the most common top-level domains however, it doesn’t mean that you’re automatically at a disadvantage. The beauty in having the opportunity to choose from a large array of domain names means that it’s very easy to find one that fits your purpose, whether you’re choosing from common TLDs or the more obscure.\n\nAlready got a domain extension you like the sound of? Check out our article on the cost of a domain name and how to register a domain name to find out more.\n\nHow Do You Create a TLD?\n\nIf you fancy trying your hand at creating a brand new top-level domain for people to use, the first step is to apply to ICANN. If your registration is successful, you’ll become a registrar and have the ability to decide who can use their domain on your TLD.\n\nSome TLD applications can be quite contentious. For example, Amazon has applied for .amazon and have waited years for a decision over their registrar status. ICANN has been dragging their feet due to concerns from countries with Amazonian regions, fearing specific .amazon domain names could cause confusion or touch on national sensitivities.\n\nNew Domain Extensions\n\nFrom 2012, ICANN began to accept a huge number of applications that led to the dramatic expansion of domains. As of August 2017, thousands of new TLDs were available, making it easy for small business owners and individuals to discover their dream domain names.\n\nDue to the fact that .com has been around almost 30 years, many valuable domain names have already been taken and registered.\n\nRecent extensions allow you to be more adventurous since one-word domain names are available once again. These new TLDs are being used in unique and unexpected ways.\n\nThe new gTLDs include domain extensions in different languages including Chinese, Arabic and those based on the Cyrillic alphabet such as Russian.\n\nThe .tech gTLD is the all-rounder for tech companies and startups while .shop is a nice fit for anyone interested in owning an online store.\n\nIf you own a business, a .biz might be the ideal choice. This gTLD earnt itself a bad reputation because it was introduced so early and became associated with spam sites. These days it’s considered as a viable backup gTLD.\n\nThe .club extension was a surprise hit and one of the most successful gTLDs, with over 1 million registered domains. Consider the number of leagues, organizations, nightclubs, and hobbyists this is a natural fit for.\n\nManufacturers and printers have also jumped on the new appendages with the introduction of industry-specific gTLDs such as .cards and .bike. Even the niche tattoo industry has a complimentary extension with .ink.\n\nCreative industries have plenty to choose from such as .live, .photography, and .music.\n\nBrand TLDs are on the rise. Big names across many industries like Amazon, Axa, Barclays, BMW, Canon, Google, and many others have applied for a brand-specific extension.\n\nWith the introduction of industry-specific gTLDs, site owners called for a similar gTLD available for adult websites. As a response to the interest in this field, .xxx, .sex, and .adult were considered until .xxx went live in 2011.\n\nInterested in finding out who owns a domain? It’s easy to discover site owners when you use our useful Whois Lookup Tool.\n\nChanging Your TLD\n\nIf you want to change your name, why not consider registering the same domain name, but with different extensions? It’s easy to do!\n\nImagine if you have a bustling coffee shop right by Central Park in New York, so you register for the domain name, thecoffeeshop.nyc.\n\nThe shop becomes so popular you open up more, and so decide to register thecoffeeeshop.us. Further down the line, you end up selling your own branded blend in your own trendy cafes, so you register thecoffeeshop.coffee and thecoffeeshop.cafe.\n\nIt’s also possible to register a bunch of domain names and if a customer visits the URL, they can be redirected through to one website, keeping all your content in one central, easy-to-manage place.\n\nIf you’ve got a domain name with another registrar and want to switch, why not transfer your domain name to Namecheap today?"
