Our support team will be happy to help you with any questions! What are you waiting for?\n\nBenefits\n\nOriginally, the .us domain intended for websites which provided content oriented to the United States of America. The Procurement Policy requires an administrative contact in the US in order for you to buy or register your personal .us domain.\n\nccTLD .us websites enjoy a relatively high reputation, both for search engines and for visitors. In the Americas, .com domains and .us domains are rated extremely high, which means that search engine rankings are good.\n\nIf you want to buy and register your Internet address with the ccTLD .us at easyname, you will benefit from many advantages: The ordering process is completed within a few seconds - after a final check of your data, we usually supply your domains within a single day.\n\nYour .us domain should meet the following requirements: Between 3 and 63 characters are available for your domain name - special characters except the hyphen are not allowed, numbers within the domain are allowed as well as pure numerical domains.\n\nStatistics\n\nEspecially in the US, the .us domain enjoys great popularity. It is used by both large companies and private individuals. The administration company \"NeuStar\" estimates that about 1,000 new .us domains are being registered daily - a statistic from the end of 2009 indicates about 1.5 million registered internet addresses with the ccTLD .us.\n\nThe chances of finding a suitable .us domain for companies or the private web project are relatively large. Due to the relatively low prevalence of .us domains compared to .com domains, you can buy and register your preferred Internet address at easyname to get an equivalent to the American .com standard. You can easily register and buy your personal domain online at easyname - but you should act swiftly, otherwise your competitors could secure the popular Internet addresses."
