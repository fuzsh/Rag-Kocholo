In some cases, you can only register ccTLDs with specific regional registrars.\n\nExamples of Popular ccTLDs include:\n\n.US (United States)\n\n.CO (Colombia)\n\n.CN (China)\n\n.UK (United Kingdom)\n\n.CA (Canada)\n\n.DE (Germany)\n\n.BR (Brazil)\n\n.MX (Mexico)\n\nSome countries will limit ccTLD access to government organizations or local-purpose entities. Local domain authorities can also dictate registration periods, as well as how renewals and transfers work.\n\nccTLDs and Rankings"
