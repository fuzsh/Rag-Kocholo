        "text": "When looking for a domain name for your business, personal blog or portfolio website, there are a few important things to consider. First, target a domain that’s easy for users to digest and doesn’t have misspellings, numbers or hyphens. Second, search for domain names that reflect your brand, whether that means including your name, slogan or keywords associated with your targeted niche. Last but not least, think critically about what top-level domain — aka domain extension — makes the most sense for your specific needs. With this one, it helps to know what are the five most common domain extensions. Choosing a recognizable domain extension could help with your online business branding. Here are the five most common domain extensions to consider. The domain extension you select has a much more important role than you might think. Let’s explore what are the five most common domain extensions and why you should consider that extension for your new domain. 1 .com For people wondering what are the five most common domain extensions, .com is hands-down the most popular top-level domain (TLD). It was originally used to designate for-profit businesses, but has now become the mainstay for domain extensions. When deciding on a domain extension, in almost all circumstances, you should consider .com if it’s available. The .com extension isn’t just the most popular because of its familiarity. Many SEO companies claim the .com extension can lead to more favorable search rankings. From a backlinking perspective, a domain with .com carries much more authority than one with a new or unfamiliar extension. Thus, when conducting outreach for backlinks, you’re likely to generate more interest and credibility using a domain with a .com, rather than another TLD. 2 .net Much like the .com extension, .net is open to anyone. What was originally intended for internet service providers or networks has now become a great alternative to .com. The .net might be a nice option for tech or application-based companies because it implies network and technology. Many people associate .net with web-based applications and services. If your business operates in those industries, .net makes perfect sense and can help validate and communicate your services. In addition, .net is in less demand than .com, meaning there is a greater likelihood that your desired domain is available. 3 .org The .org extension is also open to any person or entity, even though it was originally designed to represent not-for-profit organizations. It’s a popular option for many non-governmental organizations, nonprofits, politicians and political parties, and online communities. The .org extension is one of the original TLDs, so it carries a lot of the same search power as .com. Additionally, .org is less popular than .com, which means you have a good chance to acquire your perfect domain. 4 .co The .co extension is an interesting option if you’re asking what are the five most common domain extensions. It originally designated the country code for Colombia, but has become a popular option for global domains. The .co TLD is a familiar acronym for company, corporations or commercial ventures. This familiarity has led many forward-thinking businesses to build their brands on a .co. Creating a website with .co makes sense if you are a business, particularly if you’re a young startup that markets itself as original or unique. While .com might be the most popular and widely accepted, .co is newer, shorter and more in line with the brevity of younger generations. This freshness could be a great way to diversify your brand and target a younger demographic. 5 .us Another popular domain extension is .us. Unlike the domains above, which are open to anyone, .us is reserved to citizens and entities in the United States. You can be an individual, corporation or nonprofit organization, but you must be a permanent resident or have your business registered in the United States.
