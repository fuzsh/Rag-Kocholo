The United States Department of Commerce's (Department) National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) administers the contract for the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the United States, “.us” (usTLD). NTIA asked for input from interested parties on the introduction of accountability measures regarding access to the personal information of usTLD registrants. NTIA's policy goal regarding access to domain registration data is to ensure that the usTLD protects the privacy of its usTLD registrants while also enabling third parties to access usTLD domain registration data for legitimate purposes.
