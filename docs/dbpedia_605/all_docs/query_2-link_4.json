        "text": "Tipsarevic announced his comeback earlier today on Instagram and Twitter, posting a picture of him, driving his Porsche with the caption: “7 months ! 30 weeks ! 210 days… Here we go #Ostrava#Ostravachallenger #1sttournament “\n\nTipsarevic has not played a match since US Open 2016, and didn’t win a match in almost a year. Last time he won was in the first round match of qualification in Madrid against Vasek Pospisil. Currently ranked 455, the former World No. 8 will start his comeback at the challenger tour, playing the 50,000$ event in Ostrava. The Serb was given a wild card, and was drawn against the 6th seed, the Chilean No. 1 Hans Podlipnik-Castillo. Podlipnik-Castillo hasn’t had an exceptionally good year, his best results in 2016 being the quarterfinals of challengers in Turin and San Luis Potosi. This match will be available to watch on the ATP World Tour website. The winner of this match will face either Maxime Chazal or a qualifier.\n\nTipsarevic will definitely be what brings the crowd in to this tournament, and will go down in the history of the event as one of the highest-ranked players that every played the Ostrava challenger, among players like Marcos Baghdatis, Radek Stepanek and Mario Ancic. Janko Tipsarevic did not announce which tournaments he is going to play after Ostrava as of now.\n\nBelgium’s Alison Van Uytvanck has retired from tennis at the age of 30 following a battle with injury last year.\n\nThe former world No.37 has issued a statement on social media explaining her decision to do so is linked to both physical and mental struggles she has been experiencing in recent months. Van Uytvanck missed eight months of the Tour in 2023 due to a back injury and hasn’t won a WTA main draw match since returning to action last October. However, on the lower-level ITF circuit, she has won three titles which includes the $100,000 Surbiton Open in June.\n\n“Making this decision has been incredibly hard,” Van Uytvanck wrote on social media. “Over the past few weeks, I haven’t felt the same fire it takes to give my all, to fight for every point, and to travel around the world. It was not an easy choice, I have been struggling a lot last year while coming back from a serious injury, both physically and especially mentally.”\n\nVan Uytvanck is a former French Open quarter-finalist and also reached the fourth round at Wimbledon. Overall, at the major events she won 17 out of 53 matches played.\n\nOn the WTA Tour, she claimed five singles trophies between 2017 and 2021. Winning titles in Québec City (2017), Budapest twice (2018 and 2019), Tashkent (2019) and Astana (2021). She also won another three WTA 125 events.\n\n“For now I would like to focus on myself and explore the opportunities life has to offer besides tennis,” said van Uytvanck.\n\n“As a result, I can not say for certain if or when I will regain my passion for tennis as a player.\n\n“It’s been a journey full of highs and lows, it all started as a little girl with an enormous dream, like many of us I’ve always dreamed of one day being able to compete in Grand Slams. Having played numerous rand Slams, reaching the quarter-finals at Roland Garros, playing fourth round at Wimbledon and winning five WTA titles is truly the fulfillment of a dream and so much more.\n\n“It’s a part of my life for which I will forever be grateful, I was privileged to be able to enjoy a wonderful career in tennis.”\n\nVan Uytvanck is currently the fourth highest-ranked Belgian player on the WTA Tour at 225th in the world. Her final professional match took place last month at an ITF W75 tournament in Hechingen, Germany. Her last WTA event was the Prague Open.\n\nJannik Sinner fought back from one set down to beat Andrey Rublev 4-6 7-5 6-4 reaching the semifinals at the Cincinnati Open for the first time in his career.\n\nSinner turned the tables against Rublev, who won their previous head-to-head match in the quarter final in Montreal.\n\nSinner, who turned 23 on Friday, received a walkover into the quarter final from Jordan Thompson.\n\nRublev broke Sinner’s serve in the second game to open up a 5-2. Sinner broke back in the ninth game, as Rublev was serving to stay in the match. Rublev broke for the second time in the 10thgame to win the first set 6-4.\n\nSinner improved as the match went on and hit 17 winners compared to just two for Rublev, who committed 20 unforced errors in the set.\n\nSinner saved two break points on serve at 3-4 in the second set before recovering from a fall to win a 26-shot rally at 4-4. Sinner broke in the 11th game to seal the second set 7-5.\n\nSinner opened up a 3-0 lead with two breaks of serve. Rublev pulled one break back for 1-3 in the fourth game. Sinner earned his third break in the fourth game to race out to a 5-1 lead. Sinner had to hold off a late surge from Rublev, who broke serve in the eighth game, as Rublev attempted to close out the match. Rublev won three consecutive games to claw his way back for 4-5. Sinner did not face any more break points and served out the match at the second time of asking to seal the win after 2 hours and 25 minutes.\n\nBoth players combined for 51 unforced errors (28 for Sinner and 23 for Rublev) and 12 double faults. Sinner hit 32 winners to Rublev’s 15 and fired 15 aces.\n\nSinner has reached his fourth Masters 1000 semifinal this season after Indian Wells, Miami and Monte-Carlo.\n\n“It took a mental strength today. The conditions were very tough. It was very windy. In the first set he started very well and I did not play my best tennis but in the second set, I felt I had a lot of chances. I waited for my chance. I am very happy to make the semifinals”, said Sinner.\n\nAlexander Zverev moved past Pablo Carreno Busta 7-5 7-6 (8-6) to become the 10th player in history to reach 30 Masters 1000 quarter finals.\n\nZverev earned the first break in the third game to open up a 3-1 lead. Carreno Busta pulled back on serve in the 10th game to draw level to 5-5. Zverev broke for the second time in the 11thgame to win the first set 7-5.\n\nZverev opened up a 2-0 lead with a break in the first game. Carreno Busta pulled back on serve in the eighth game to draw level to 4-4. Zverev earned a mini-break to take a 3-1 lead. Carreno Busta pulled back on serve to draw level to 6-6. Zverev sealed the win with a second mini-break.\n\nZverev will face either Ben Shelton or Fabian Maroszan.\n\nZverev claimed the Cincinnati title in 2021 and reached the semifinals last season.\n\nAndrey Rublev moved past Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. Rublev fended off two break points in the first set which went on serve en route to the tie-break. Rublev earned his first mini-break to take a 3-2 lead. Nakashima pulled back on serve to draw level to 3-3. Rublev sealed the tie-break 7-5 with a second mini-break. Rublev broke twice in the second and sixth games and sealed the win on his third match point after 82 minutes. Rublev set up a quarter final match against Jannik Sinner, who advanced after Jordan Thompson withdrew from their third round match with a rib injury."
