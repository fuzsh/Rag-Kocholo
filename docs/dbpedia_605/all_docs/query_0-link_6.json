        "text": "STARS\n\nDominika Cibulkova beat Agnieszka Radwanska 3-6 6-4 6-4 to win the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California, USA\n\nJohn Isner beat Kevin Anderson 6-7 (3) 7-6 (2) 7-6 (2) to win the BB&T Atlanta Open in Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nMikhail Youzhny beat Robin Haase 6-3 6-4 to win the Crédit Agricole Suisse Open in Gstaad, Switzerland\n\nTommy Robredo beat Fabio Fognini 6-0 6-3 to win the Vegeta Croatia Open in Umag, Croatia\n\nElina Svitolina beat Shahar Peer 6-4 6-4 to win the Baku Cup in Baku, Azerbaijan\n\nDudi Sela beat Mikhail Kukushkin 5-7 6-2 7-6 (6) to win the President’s Cup in Astana, Kazakhstan\n\nSAYING\n\n“I lived on the edge all week, and seemed to come through for the good every time. It feels good to be on the right side.” – John Isner, after winning two of three tiebreakers to capture the Atlanta, Georgia, USA, tournament.\n\n“He definitely played two better tiebreakers than me; there’s no question about that.” – Kevin Anderson, after losing to John Isner in the BB&T Atlanta Open final.\n\n“In the long rallies I started to feel my breath and my legs. The last match point I was so dead, I was so tired, but I knew I could not give it up now. I knew I just had to make one, two more balls and the match is mine.” – Dominika Cibulkova, who beat Agnieszka Radwanska in the final of the Bank of the West Classic.\n\n“I didn’t use my chances when I was 4-2 up, and I paid the price.” – Agnieszka Radwanska, following her loss to Dominika Cibulkova.\n\n“I’m more than happy. I’ve been a professional for nearly 15 years and this is my 12th title, so there have not been many times with trophies. I love the emotion.” – Tommy Robredo, following his victory at the Vegeta Croatia Open Umag.\n\n“I’m very happy. When you win a tournament, it doesn’t matter how you’ve played or who you beat.” – Mikhail Youzhny, following his victory over Robin Haase in Gstaad, Switzerland\n\n“I’m here as the runner-up and that’s great. I think that the altitude fits my game and that I can handle it well. It’s tough to play against Mikhail. He’s a great player and I never beat him.” – Robin Haase, who has lost to Youzhny in all five of their career meetings.\n\n“We played a great match today again. We played two weeks in a row so now we know each other quite well. We’re very happy because we lost in the final last week and now we got the title.” – Edouard Roger-Vasselin, after he and Igor Sijsling won the BB&T Atlanta Open doubles title.\n\n“I served well and put pressure on him from the very beginning. It helped that I already played him in Hamburg last week.” – Daniel Brands, after he upset Roger Federer at the Crédit Agricole Suisse Open in Gstaad.\n\n“I got a few chances but finally couldn’t take advantage of them. I wasn’t consistent enough in the end. He was serving well and I couldn’t do enough with my return.” – Roger Federer, on why he lost to Daniel Brands.\n\n“I’m happy that I was able to play because I’ve had problems for some time now, already in Hamburg. But it didn’t get worse during today’s match. I’m positive and I felt that it was getting better during the last few days.” – Roger Federer, discussing problems with his back.\n\nSWITCHEROO\n\nDominika Cibulkova remembered the last time she played Agnieszka Radwanska – a 6-0 6-0 double-bagel to the world’s fourth-ranked player in the final at Sydney, Australia, in January. This time Cibulkova beat Radwanska in the Bank of the West Classic title match. “The difference between Sydney and today was that I made the first game,” Cibulkova said. “And after the first game I looked at my coach and was like, ‘Here we go. I’m out here, and it’s going to be good today.” It wasn’t all easy sailing for the Slovak, who lost her serve twice in the final set – both on double faults. But she won the final four games and fell to the ground in joy as her father, Milan, rushed out of the stands to hug her. “I was just so happy and he scared me,” Cibulkova laughed. “He gets emotional. I think that I have this after my parents – especially after my father – that I get into the matches sometimes so much and I just put my heart into it. And I think he did the same today.” It was Cibulkova’s third WTA title, having won in Carlsbad, California, USA, last year and in Moscow, Russia, in 2011.\n\nSMASHING TIME\n\nPerhaps John Isner doesn’t know how to play a short, quick match. In a battle of giants – Isner is 6-foot-9 (2.06m) and Kevin Anderson 6-8 (2.03m) – Isner outlasted his South African foe 6-7 (3) 7-6 (2) 7-6 (2) in the longest three-set ATP World Tour final this season: 2 hours, 54 minutes. “This is a tournament where I could have been out in my first match,” said Isner, a former University of Georgia star. He played at least one tiebreaker in all four of his matches – seven tiebreaks in all. Isner has played at least one tiebreaker in 11 of his last 13 matches prior to Atlanta and has an ATP-best tiebreaker record this season of 26-7. Against Anderson, Isner faced 11 service breaks – winning them all, often with aces. He missed his only chance to break Anderson’s serve. “I had a couple chances,” Anderson said. “He’s proven himself to serve well when it matters. He stepped it up well. Even if I was the better player in the majority of the match, he stays in there.” This was the first time in their eight career meetings that the winner of the first set did not win the match.\n\nSTUNNED AGAIN\n\nIt’s becoming habit-forming, Roger Federer being booted out of tournament by low-ranking opponents. In Gstaad at the Swiss Open, Federer fell in the second round to 55th-ranked Daniel Brands of Germany 6-3 6-4. Once the top player in the world, Federer has now lost to players ranked outside the top 50 in his last three tournaments, including Wimbledon, where he was beaten by Ukraine’s Sergiy Stakhovsky, who was ranked 116th in the world. Last week Federer fell to Argentine qualifier Federico Delbonis, the world number 114, in Hamburg, Germany. Federer, who never complains about injuries, said there was a reason behind the losses. “I’ve had serious problems with the back, I had to get some anti-inflammatories last week in Hamburg due to the back pain,” he said. “It was so tough to play and move out there today. I’ll just have to take treatment and see how it all goes.” The Swiss ace failed to reach a final in the first four months of this season before winning at the Wimbledon warm-up event in Halle, Germany. But his results in the Grand Slam tournaments have been atrocious: going out in the Australian Open semifinals, the quarterfinals at Roland Garros and the second round at Wimbledon.\n\nA day after Federer was ousted at the Swiss Open, Switzerland’s second-highest ranked player, Stanislas Wawrinka retired from his quarterfinal match at Gstaad with the same ailment: a bad back. Wawrinka stopped after requiring a medical timeout more than two hours into his match with Feliciano Lopez. The Spaniard was leading 6-4 2-6 4-3 when Wawrinka retired.\n\nFederer and Wawrinka teamed in 2008 to win the doubles gold medal at the Beijing Olympic Games.\n\nSTAYING HOME\n\nThe Spanish sport daily Marca reports that Rafael Nadal may skip the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, which is scheduled to begin on August 11. The reason is that Nadal’s left knee and left elbow may not hold up after he plays the Rogers Cup in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the week before. Both are hard court tournaments and lead to the year’s final Grand Slam event, the US Open, which is also played on hard courts. The newspaper also alleged that Nadal may not choose to play Cincinnati because “many players don’t like it because it’s geographically in the middle of nowhere.”\n\nSHARAPOVA STILL OUT\n\nInjuries suffered at Wimbledon are still being cited as the reason Maria Sharapova will not be playing the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The world’s second-ranked woman said she still hasn’t recovered from the injury sustained during a second-round loss to Michelle Larcher de Brito back in June. The Russian tumbled several times during the Wimbledon match, took a medical timeout and later said she thought she had strained a hip muscle. She also withdrew from the Bank of the West Classic played at Stanford, California, USA.\n\nSUISSE CHAMPION\n\nIt has been 18 years since a Russian has captured the trophy in Gstaad, Switzerland. But Mikhail Youzhny did just that by beating Robin Haase in the final of the Crédit Agricole Suisse Open. “My last title was at the start of last year in Zagreb, so it’s been quite long.” Youzhny said. “I’m trying everything to try and play more consistently at a high level.” He did just that against Haase, needed 68 minutes and converting his third match point for the title. “When you see the score, it looks easy, but it wasn’t,” Youzhny said. “It was only one break in each set and I didn’t have many chances to break him again. The last game on my serve was also very close.” The last Russian to win at Gstaad was Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1995.\n\nSHOULDER TROUBLES\n\nBob Bryan’s left shoulder injury has caused the world’s top-ranked doubles to pull out of the Citi Open in Washington, DC, USA. Bob and his twin brother Mike have not played since becoming the first doubles team in the Open Era to be the reigning champions in all four Grand Slam tournaments and the Olympic gold medalists. The Americans own a record 15 major championships and are seeking to become only the second men’s doubles team to win a calendar Grand Slam, matching the feat of Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgman in 1951. The American twins are currently on a 24-match winning streak and have won a record 91 doubles titles as a team.\n\nSENIOR CHAMPIONS\n\nTennis is apparently becoming an old man’s game – old being relative, of course. When Mikhail Youzhny captured the Suisse Open in Gstaad, it was the 12th time this year that a player aged 30 or over has won an ATP World Tour event. Now 31, it was Youzhny’s first title since he won the PBZ Zagreb Indoors in February 2012.\n\nSWINGING AGAIN\n\nNow that she’s been inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, Martina Hingis is spending her time back on the WTA Tour playing doubles. The 32-year-old Swiss star was inducted into the Newport, Rhode Island, USA, shrine earlier this month. Now she has two tournaments on her calendar, playing only doubles. She added the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to her schedule to go along with her return to the WTA Tour at the Southern California Open in Carlsbad, California, USA. Hingis asked for and received a wild card into the doubles in Toronto, but her partner has yet to be named. Hingis won the Rogers Cup singles in 1999 and 2000, as well as the doubles in 1998 and 2000. In her Hall of Fame career Hingis won five Grand Slam tournament singles titles and nine major doubles championships.\n\nSVITOLINA WINS\n\nElina Svitolina won her first WTA title by beating Shahar Peer in the final of the Baku Cup. It was the first time the Ukrainian had reached a title match on the main women’s tour. At 18 years, 10 months and 18 days, Svitolina is the first teenager to win a WTA title in 2013 – and the first teenager to win since Timea Babos captured Monterrey in February 2012. Svitolina dominated her Israeli opponent, her power game just too much for the veteran Peer. On match point, Svitolina hit an ace out wide to wrap up the win. The champion had won a small International Tennis Federation tournament in Pune, India, last November, her only other title as a pro. She also won the French Open junior girls crown in 2010.\n\nSAYS TESTED POSITIVE\n\nAccording to media in Zagreb, Croatia, the country’s top player, Marin Cilic, failed a drug test in April. Quoting “reliable sources,” the Slobodna Dalmacija newspaper reported that Cilic failed the test only two weeks after passing a doping control at the Monte Carlo Masters. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) is said to be probing the case and the 24-year-old Croatian, who is ranked 15th in the world, has sent his explanation to the world tennis body. The Jutarnji List newspaper reported that Cilic allegedly tested positive because of “incautious use of glucose.” Croatian newspapers said Cilic found out about the positive results during Wimbledon, adding that was the reason he withdrew from his match against Kenny de Schepper. At the time it was reported that Cilic withdrew because of a left knee injury.\n\nSEEKS APPEAL\n\nSerbia’s Victor Troicki is appealing his 18-month suspension for failing to provide a blood test to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. “This was a clear mistake from the on-site doping control officer who was also a doctor, and the person in charge to decide,” Troicki said in a statement published on his website. “I am destroyed and exhausted. This is a real nightmare.” Ranked 53rd in the world, Troicki’s suspension last through January 24, 2015, meaning he will miss six Grand Slam tournaments. Troicki said he gave a urine sample after losing a match to Finland’s Jarkko Nieminen, but declined to give blood because he felt ill and feared needles. Anti-doping rules require athletes selected for testing to comply with official requests. “The doctor in charge of the testing told me that I looked very pale and ill, and that I could skip the test if I wrote an explanation letter to ITF about it,” Troicki said. The player said he gave a blood sample the following morning to the doctor, Elena Gorodilova, and it was “negative, totally clean” like the initial urine test. The ITF tribunal said it found the 27-year-old Troicki a “confident and determined man” with “genuine belief” in the truth of what he was saying. “However, that does not mean that this account was in fact accurate,” the ruling said. “Mr. Troicki came across to us as someone prone to exaggeration in order to make his point.”\n\nSTEPPING DOWN\n\nOnce Britain’s top female player, Anne Keothavong has called it a career. The 29-year-old will join BT Sport’s tennis coverage team later this year. “I think I am leaving tennis in excellent shape with both Laura Robson and Heather Watson leading the way for Britain in the women’s game,” said Keothavong, who won 20 singles titles on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) circuit, a stop below the WTA tour. She reached a career-high singles ranking of 48th in the world in 2009. She currently is ranked 285th. “I have given my decision a lot of thought and I believe this is the right time to move on to the next stage of my career,” she said.\n\nSWITCHING COACHES\n\nWhen Heather Watson takes to the court at the Citi Open in Washington, DC, USA, she will be working with a new coach. Britain’s number two player has parted company with coach Mauricio Hadad and will work with Jeremy Bates throughout the American hard-court season. The 21-year-old Watson has fallen to 78th in the world rankings after missing two months in the spring with glandular fever. Bates is the women’s lead coach for Britain’s Lawn Tennis Association. He will work with Watson in Toronto and Cincinnati before heading to the US Open in New York City. Watson has not played since losing a first-round Wimbledon match to American Madison Keys.\n\nSOME CHANGES COMING\n\nThe Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, site of the US Open, will undergo a USD $500 million expansion. The New York City Council voted to accept a plan that allows the 46-acre tennis center to annex a small parcel of parkland in Flushing Meadows Park and in return receive more than USD $10 million for improvements to the park. Community groups that had pressured the United States Tennis Association (USTA) for concessions applauded the deal, which includes an annual job fair for local residents, allowing area high schools to hold their graduation ceremonies at the center and including tennis coaching programs for local children.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nAstana: Riccardo Ghedin and Claudio Grassi beat Andrey Golubev and Mikhail Kukushkin 3-6 6-3 10-8 (match tiebreak)\n\nAtlanta: Edouard Roger-Vasselin and Igor Sijsling beat Colin Fleming and Jonathan Marray 7-6 (6) 6-3\n\nBaku: Irina Buryachok and Oksana Kalashnikova beat Eleni Daniilidou and Aleksandra Krunic 4-6 7-6 (3) 10-4 (match tiebreak)\n\nGstaad: Jamie Murray and John Peers beat Pablo Andujar and Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3 6-4\n\nStanford: Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears beat Julia Goerges and Darija Jurak 6-2 7-6 (4)\n\nUmag: Martin Klizan and David Marrero beat Nicholas Monroe and Simon Stadler 6-1 5-7 10-7 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nCarlsbad: www.southerncaliforniaopen13.com/\n\nWashington: www.citiopentennis.com/\n\nKitzbühel: www.bet-at-home-cup.com/de/\n\nVancouver: www.vanopen.com/\n\nMontreal: www.rogerscup.com/men/english/\n\nToronto: www.rogerscup.com/women/english/\n\nAptos: http://seascapesportsclub.com/challenger/\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$1,295,790 Citi Open, Washington, DC, USA, hard\n\n$539,000 bet-at-home Cup Kitzbühel, Kitzbühel, Austria, clay\n\n$100,000 Odlum Brown Vancouver Open, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$795,707 Southern California Open, Carlsbad, California, USA, hard\n\n$235,000 Citi Open, Washington, DC, USA, hard\n\n$100,000 Odlum Brown Vancouver Open, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hard\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$2,887,085 Coupe Rogers, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, hard\n\n$100,000 Comerica Bank Challenger, Aptos, California, USA, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$2,369,000 Rogers Cup presented by National Bank, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, hard\n\nSTARS\n\nIvo Karlovic beat Alejandro Falla 6-3 7-6 (4) to win the Claro Open Colombia in Bogotá, Colombia\n\nFabio Fognini beat Federico Delbonis 4-6 7-6 (8) 6-2 to win the bet-at-home Open – German Tennis Championships in Hamburg, Germany\n\nSerena Williams beat Johanna Larsson 6-4 6-1 to win the Collector Swedish Open in Båstad, Sweden\n\nYvonne Meusburger beat Andrea Hlavackova 7-5 6-2 to win the Nürnberger Gastein Ladies in Bad Gastein, Austria\n\nFED CUP\n\nBahamas and Ecuador, topping Group B and A respectively in competition held in Santa Tecla, El Salvador, are promoted to Fed Cup Americas Group I next year\n\nSAYING\n\n“I feel like I’m dreaming. My key was to enjoy the match and enjoy playing this kind of player, because he’s the best of all time.” – Federico Delbonis, after upsetting Roger Federer in the semifinals in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n“It’s disappointing, but defeats like that happen sometimes.” – Roger Federer, after losing to Federico Delbonis.\n\n“To lose the final with match points is disappointing. But at the end of the week, the result of all the week is positive for me. It’s my first final. I beat Roger (Federer) yesterday.” – Federico Delbonis, who reached the final in Hamburg.\n\n“I wasn’t playing well at Wimbledon when I lost, so I thought, ‘OK, just remember what I did wrong there and don’t make the same mistake here.’ I really wanted to do better here in Båstad this week.” – Serena Williams, after winning in Båstad, Sweden.\n\n“I had some good chances in the first set today but didn’t take them, and when you’re playing such a good player, you need to take every opportunity you get.” – Johanna Larsson, following her loss to Serena Williams.\n\n“Only happiness that after all these injuries and illnesses I was able to be back here.” – Ivo Karlovic, talking about his emotions following his winning the Claro Open Colombia.\n\n“I’ve come here every season and I can’t believe I’ve won it now.” – Yvonne Meusburger, who won her first WTA title at the Gastein Ladies.\n\n“I was, I think, a little bit lucky. I was nervous. Today, I didn’t play really good, but I fought hard. I think that was the key. Another trophy, that’s the important thing.” – Fabio Fognini, whose victory at Hamburg, Germany, was his second in two weeks.\n\nSERENA BACK TO WINNING WAYS\n\nIt took her 53 titles before Serena Williams captured her first WTA International-level tournament by winning the Collector Swedish Open. Before she was victorious at Båstad, Williams had never come away with a title in five previous attempts at the International level – never even making it past the semifinals before. Williams is now tied with Monica Seles for ninth place for the most WTA titles in the Open Era. Sweden’s Johanna Larsson put up a strong fight before Williams unveiled the game that has made her the top-ranked player in the world. Larsson twice went up a break in the first set, but with the Swede serving at 4-3, Williams began an eight-game streak that gave her the victory. “Johanna played well and I made a lot of unforced errors in the beginning. I just hit everything out,” Williams said. “I had to kind of come back and do a little better. You just have to stay positive.” Larsson has now reached three WTA finals, but has yet to win. It was her second runner-up finish in Båstad. “Of course I’m a little bit disappointed to lose today,” Larsson said. “If I could close the first set, maybe the match would’ve been different. But overall I’m happy with the week.”\n\nSHOCKED AGAIN\n\nRoger Federer has become the feather in every other player’s cap. This time it was Argentine qualifier Federico Delbonis who shocked the former world’s number on 7-6 (7) 7-6 (4) in the semifinals in Hamburg. “He played well, he was a little more aggressive,” Federer said of his conqueror, who is ranked 114th in the world. Hamburg was Federer’s first tournament since he was upset in the second round at Wimbledon by 116th-ranked Sergiy Stakhovsky – a player who failed to qualify for the German event. Delbonis was playing in only the second semifinal of his career. But he maintained his composure and gave the 17-time Grand Slam tournament champion only two break points, one of which he saved. In the second-set tiebreaker, Federer made two straight groundstroke errors and then netted a forehand on Delbonis’ first match point.\n\nDelbonis wasn’t the only player to give Federer trouble in Hamburg. The Swiss star, who has dropped to fifth in the world rankings – the lowest he has been in a decade – was taken to three sets in two of his first three matches before he played Delbonis. Federer changed his racquet after Wimbledon, going for a bigger frame. He refused, however, to blame his equipment for the loss. “I don’t think it had much to do with the racket today,” he said. “I tried everything I could at this tournament. It’s been a difficult week throughout. But I’m happy I fought through many matches. It gives me the matches I was looking for.”\n\nSTRONG AND SWEET\n\nViral meningitis sidelined Ivo Karlovic for more than two months. Now that he’s back on the ATP World Tour, he’s back in the win column for the first time in five years. The 34-year-old Croatian won the inaugural Claro Open Colombia by stopping home favorite Alejandro Falla. Karlovic won all 61 of his service games and served a total of 104 aces during the tournament. “It was an unbelievable week,” he said upon receiving the trophy. It was the first time in three years that Karlovic had reached a final. He used two of his 16 aces to capture the final tiebreak. Falla was the first Colombian to reach an ATP Tour-level final in two years and was seeking to become the first player from his country to win a title since Mauricio Hadad in April 1995. “It was a great week for me,” Falla said. “The challenge was to reach the final and win matches, and I lost a tough final. Ivo was serving unbelievable. I tried my best every time. I take many, many positive things and I’m going to try to keep it up for the rest of the season.”\n\nSUCCESSFUL JULY\n\nUnlike Roger Federer, Fabio Fognini found a way to beat giant-killer Federico Delbonis. But it wasn’t easy. The second-seeded Italian had to save three match points in the second-set tiebreak before downing the Argentine qualifier 4-6, 7-6 (8), 6-2. It was Fognini’s second ATP World Tour title in two weeks, this time at the bet-at-home Open-German Tennis Championships in Hamburg. “It’s an amazing week,” Fognini said. “I can’t believe it right now. I just feel incredible, a real good sensation. I’m very happy.” Delbonis surprised Federer in the semifinals and took the opening set against Fognini. Playing in his first ATP World Tour final, he saved all five break points he faced, and then converted his first opportunity in the 10th game to grab the early lead. After Fognini broke serve to begin the second set, the 22-year-old Delbonis won four straight games to take a 4-1 lead. He squandered three match points in the tiebreak at 6-5, 7-6 and 8-7. “I tried to do my best on the match points,” Delbonis said. “I don’t know if I played bad. I tried to do the best on the three points. But Fabio also played well on these points.” It was all Fognini in the final set, although he was broken while serving for the match at 5-1. He then broke right back for the title.\n\nSINGLE ACHIEVEMENT\n\nLike Fabio Fognini, Yvonne Meusburger has reached the final in her last two matches. Unlike the Italian, Meusburger won her first WTA title by capturing the Nürnberger Gastein Ladies by besting Andrea Hlavackova. Meusburger didn’t drop a set in the tournament, where she has reached at least the quarterfinals every year since it was first held in 2007. Six years ago she lost the final at Bad Gastein to Italy’s Francesca Schiavone. Hlavackova, a doubles specialist, had never been beyond the quarterfinals of a WTA event before and had not won back-to-back matches this year. “Yvonne had two great weeks in a row so she was playing well,” Hlavackova said. “But I had a great week as well here and I don’t really want to go home now.”\n\nSHARAPOVA OUT\n\nA left hip injury suffered during Wimbledon was listed as the reason Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the Bank of the West Classic at Stanford, California. “Unfortunately injuries are a part of the sport,” tournament director Kim Hall said in a statement. Sharapova fell several times during her second-round loss to Michelle Larcher de Brito at Wimbledon last month. She took a medical timeout during the match and later said she thought she strained a hip muscle.\n\nSIDELINED\n\nWimbledon champion Marion Bartoli is skipping the Bank of the West Classic because of a hamstring strain. “During Wimbledon I developed a strain in my hamstring which has not healed over the past two weeks,” said Bartoli, who won the California tournament in 2009. “I have been receiving therapy and was optimistic that I would be able to participate. … It is one of my favorite tournaments on the circuit. Unfortunately, the injury has not completely healed and I will be unable to participate.”\n\nSISTERS INTO US OPEN\n\nBoth Williams sisters – Serena and Venus – are expected to play in this year’s US Open. They are two of five past champions who get direct entry into the women’s main draw. Venus Williams has won America’s premier tennis event in 2000 and 2001, while Serena, currently the world’s top-ranked player, counts four US Opens among her 16 Grand Slam tournament singles titles. Serena is the defending champion in the year’s final major. Other past champions in the field are Maria Sharapova, Samantha Stosur and Svetlana Kuznetsova, along with two-time Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka and recent Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli.\n\nSHOULDER TROUBLES\n\nShoulder injuries struck down the two top players at the Nürnberger Gastein Ladies tournament. First, defending champion Alize Cornet of France pulled out of the event with a shoulder injury. That moved Mona Barthel of Germany into the position of the number one seed. Then, in her second-round match against 725th-ranked Lisa-Maria Moser, Barthel retired with a shoulder injury while trailing 6-2 4-3. Moser was playing in her first WTA event. She broke Moser twice to take the opening set and was up a break when Moser withdrew.\n\nSHE’S BACK\n\nSix years after she retired and right after she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, Martina Hingis is returning to the WTA tour. The Swiss star, now 32, is scheduled to play doubles at next week’s Southern California Open in Carlsbad, California, USA. She will partner with Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. “I am very much looking forward to making a return to competitive play at the Southern California Open,” the former world number one said in a statement on the WTA website. “My competitive spirit is still very much alive and I love being out on court.” Hingis won nine Grand Slam tournament doubles titles and one mixed doubles title. Hingis has not played a WTA event since September 2007.\n\nSKY JUMPER\n\nStanislas Wawrinka took to the skies in the Bernese mountains – literally. The Swiss star, currently ranked 10th in the world, jumped out a plane for the second time. “At the beginning of the flight we were talking quite a lot, but just before jumping you obviously have to focus and you stop talking,” Wawrinka said. “It was a great experience. Of course, you get very nervous just before jumping off the plane, but once you are in the air it’s a great feeling.” Wawrinka is playing this week in the Crédit Agricole Suisse Open in Gstaad, Switzerland.\n\nSWITCHING SURFACES\n\nThe Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Germany, has always been played on clay. Not any more. Five courts at the Weissenhof Tennis Club are being switched to grass, and the ATP World Tour 250 tournament is being moved to the week following Roland Garros in the lead-up to Wimbledon, beginning in 2015. The Stuttgart tournament was first held in 1898, with Mercedes-Benz assuming the role of title sponsor in 1979.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nBåstad: Anabel Medina Garrigues and Klara Zakopalova beat Alexandra Dulgheru and Flavia Pennetta 6-1 6-4\n\nBogotá: Purav Raja and Divij Sharan beat Edouard Roger-Vasselin and Igor Sijsling 7-6 (4) 7-6 (3)\n\nGastein: Sandra Klemenschits and Andreja Klepac beat Kristina Barrois and Eleni Daniilidou 6-1 6-4\n\nHamburg: Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski beat Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares 3-6 6-1 10-8 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nBaku: http://bakucup.az/\n\nStanford: www.bankofthewestclassic.com/\n\nAtlanta: www.bbtatlantaopen.com\n\nGstaad: www.creditagricolesuisseopengstaad.ch/\n\nUmag: www.croatiaopen.hr\n\nAstana: http://tennis.wettpoint.com\n\nCarlsbad: www.southerncaliforniaopen13.com/\n\nWashington: www.citiopentennis.com/\n\nKitzbühel: www.bet-at-home-cup.com/de/\n\nVancouver: www.vanopen.com/\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$546,930 BB&T Atlanta Open, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, hard\n\n$535,623 Crédit Agricole Suisse Open, Gstaad, Switzerland, clay\n\n$535,623 Vegeta Croatia Open, Umag, Croatia, clay\n\n$125,000 President’s Cup, Astana, Kazakhstan, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$795,707 Bank of the West Classic, Stanford, California, USA, hard\n\n$235,000 Baku Cup, Baku, Azerbaijan, hard\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$1,295,790 Citi Open, Washington, DC, USA, hard\n\n$539,000 bet-at-home Cup Kitzbühel, Kitzbühel, Austria, clay\n\n$100,000 Odlum Brown Vancouver Open, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$795,707 Southern California Open, Carlsbad, California, USA, hard\n\n$235,000 Citi Open, Washington, DC, USA, hard\n\n$100,000 Odlum Brown Vancouver Open, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hard\n\nSTARS\n\nRoger Federer beat Mikhail Youzhny 6-7 (5) 6-3 6-4 to win the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany\n\nAndy Murray beat Marin Cilic 5-7 7-5 6-3 to win The Aegon Championships in London, Great Britain\n\nSimona Halep beat Andrea Petkovic 6-3 6-3 to win the Nürnberger Versicherungscup in Nürnberg, Germany\n\nDaniela Hantuchova beat Donna Vekic 7-6 (5) 6-4 to win The Aegon Classic in Birmingham, Great Britain\n\nSAYING\n\n“I thought I played well from the start and I really had to fight for it, in the semis against Tommy Haas and in the finals against Mikhail Youzhny. I think I did well today and they are exactly the kind of wins I need at this part of the season.” – Roger Federer, after capturing his first title of the year.\n\n“The difference was that he was better today – he’s been better all his life.” – Mikhail Youzhny, who lost to Roger Federer in the final at Halle.\n\n“He’s one of the best grass court players in the world. Me and Marin, we have played against each other since the juniors and we have had a lot of close matches and tight matches. I was lucky to come through in the end because he was playing great tennis, especially towards the end of the second set and I got a little bit lucky at the end of that set.” – Andy Murray, who beat Marin Cilic to win the title at Queen’s Club.\n\n“It was a great match from both sides, a great level of tennis. Andy showed he is capable of coming back; he’s a great fighter. Congratulations to him for a great week. It was an extremely great week for me. I enjoyed all my matches. It wasn’t easy. I had some tough fights.” – Marin Cilic.\n\n“It feels great to finally get the title. The first week on grass is always really demanding on the body, so I’m proud of how I made it through so many long matches throughout the week. And when I really needed to, I was tough mentally. I’ve been playing here since ’99, I think – it was about time I got the title.” – Daniela Hantuchova, after winning at Birmingham, Great Britain.\n\n“I have mixed emotions right now. I can’t be happy after losing a match, but it was a great week for me and I’m happy I could reach the finals. And I gave it my all today – maybe it wasn’t my best tennis, but it was the best I could do today, and Daniela was just the better player out there.” – Donna Vekic, following her loss to Daniela Hantuchova at Birmingham, Great Britain.\n\n“It is something that right now seems light-years away, something that I am not even thinking about.” – Rafael Nadal, when asked about matching Federer’s record 17 Grand Slam tournament titles.\n\n“Ten years ago I went into Wimbledon with so much pressure, even though I had lost in the first round the year before. In terms of needing to prove my point that I was a legitimate Grand Slam contender, I had incredible pressure. Now, 10 years later, I know Wimbledon, I know Halle, I know my way around and what I need to do to perform well. I’m going in with pressure because I’m defending my title. There’s always pressure because it’s a privilege to play at Wimbledon and I want to do so, so well.” – Roger Federer.\n\n“Always having a title you feel happy, especially one week away from Wimbledon. It’s the first tournament on grass this year and to win it gives us confidence.” – Santiago Gonzalez, after teaming with Scott Lipsky to win the Gerry Weber Open doubles.\n\n“I think it is disappointing for a serve-and-volley player to go down like this. It shows also how easy it is to hit passing shots or returns today.” – Roger Federer, after beating Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 in the Gerry Weber Open quarterfinals.\n\n“Andrea beat me in Romania a few years ago and I’m happy I could win against her here today. She played great and the atmosphere was great. It’s an unbelievable feeling to win my first WTA title.” – Simona Halep, who beat Andrea Petkovic in the final of the Nürnberger Versicherungscup.\n\n“There are definitely more positives than negatives. The good thing is Simona made it a little easier for me to get over the loss because she played such an incredible match. She played an almost perfect match, especially after she found her rhythm in the middle of the first set. I wasn’t playing my best tennis, but even if I was playing my best tennis, it would be a very, very tough call.” – Andrea Petkovic.\n\n“There is no one leader. If there is a guy playing better than the other, he doesn’t try to be the leader. Because that is not good. You don’t want to feel that your brother is carrying you.” – Mike Bryan, on how he and brother Bob play winning doubles.\n\n“As twins, you see your twin as an equal. You don’t want to feel like you are dominating. When one of us starts to talk and bosses the other around, that is a negative for us. It is better in big moments, when we don’t say too much.” – Bob Bryan.\n\n“I love playing as many weeks on grass as possible. Yeah, that’s why the Olympics and playing Newport (Rhode Island, USA) last year was so special to me because I could play a bigger chunk of tournaments. I think it’s a unique surface. There are certain players that play really well on it.” – Lleyton Hewitt, who is second only to Roger Federer in number of match wins on grass among active players.\n\n“Happy Father’s Day to our awesome Dad back home in California. He is the reason we fell in love with this game so many years ago.” – Bob Bryan.\n\nSTILL WINNING\n\nHalle, Germany, seemed as good a place as any for Roger Federer to return to the winner’s circle. Federer used the grass-court tournament to prepare for his defense of his Wimbledon title by rallying from a set down to beat Russia’s Mikhail Youzhny and capture his first title of 2013. “I have won a lot in my career but not recently,” said Federer, who hadn’t won since August 2012 in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. “I am happy it worked for me today.” Youzhny played brilliantly and matched Federer with hammering ground strokes. Federer took home the Gerry Weber Open title for the sixth time after playing for two hours, 2 minutes. It was his 77th career title, tying him with John McEnroe for third place in the career titles list behind Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl. “I was satisfied with my game in the past 10 months,” Federer said. “Maybe people thought I was playing badly. That was not the case. I was playing well but when it mattered the others were just better. Today it worked well.”\n\nSTRONG AGAIN\n\nAndy Murray overcame an opening-set groin strain and a strong performance by defending champion Marin Cilic to win his third Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club. In gaining his 27th career singles title, Murray rallied to defeat Cilic 5-7 7-6 6-3. It was his first tournament since he withdrew from the French Open with a back injury. “I worked very hard in the time that I had off to try and get myself in the best shape possible,” Murray said. The winner screamed in agony in the eighth game of the match when his foot slipped on the grass and he strained his groin. He continued to play without treatment. “It was just a bit sore on the groin area, but thankfully it wasn’t too bad,” Murray said. Murray also won the Wimbledon warm-up tournament in 2009 and 2011, and became the sixth player to win Queen’s Club three or more times.\n\nSLOVAKIAN CHAMPION\n\nDaniela Hantuchova was the experienced veteran and ranked higher. She was supposed to win, considering her opponent in the final was 16-year-old Donna Vekic. But even in defeat Vekic showed she could be the face of the future on the WTA tour. “This was my second WTA final and I’m still only 16,” said Vekic, the youngest player in the top 350 in the rankings. “Things have gone fast so far in my career, but I’m hoping when I make my third final I will win it. But it’s been a great week, considering it was my first grass-court event on the WTA Tour. Now I’m really looking forward to Wimbledon” where she will be making her main draw debut. The 30-year-old Hantuchova captured her sixth career title, her first since Pattaya City, Thailand, in February. This was her first win in three grass-court finals, having been runner-up in Eastbourne, Great Britain, in 2004, and Birmingham, Great Britain, in 2011.\n\nSIMONA VICTORIOUS\n\nPlaying in the fourth final of her career, Simona Halep finally came away with the big trophy. The Romanian never lost her serve as she bested former top-10 player Andrea Petkovic at the Nürnberger Versicherungscup for her first WTA title. “This is a very nice win for me, and this is a very nice tournament,” Halep said. “I’ll never forget this.” Halep became the eighth Romanian ever to win a WTA title, joining Virginia Ruzici, Irina Spirlea, Ruxandra Drogomir Ilie, Sorana Cirstea, Alexandra Dulgheru, Irina-Camelia Begu and Monica Niculescu. Petkovic entered the tournament as a wild card. Despite the defeat, her confidence is high as she heads to Wimbledon, where she received a wild card into the main draw. “Everybody knows that grass and me haven’t become a love romance yet,” Petkovic said. “But I’m working on it. A few candlelight dinners with the grass and we’ll see.” The German has never made it past the third round at Wimbledon.\n\nSECOND DOUBLE BAGEL\n\nRoger Federer was perfect in his quarterfinal match at the Gerry Weber Open. And it was Mischa Zverev who paid the price. The Swiss master posted only his second career double bagel as he blanked Zverev 6-0 6-0 at the Gerry Weber Open. “It’s not something which is easy to do,” Federer said. “You never go into a match aiming for that score. I was very surprised that it happened, especially on grass.” It took just 39 minutes for Federer to close out his easy win. “I hope he doesn’t take it too badly,” Federer said. “I just had a pretty easy time picking up his serve, and I must have made a ton of returns.” He got his first double bagel against Gaston Gaudio at the 2005 Masters Cup in Shanghai, China, and said the only time he lost a match without winning a game was his first match at the age of 8. Zverev was philosophical about the beating. “I’d rather lost 6-0 6-0 to Roger in a quarterfinal” than to a qualifier in the second round,” Zverev said. “At least there is something to talk about later.”\n\nSHOWING IMPROVEMENT\n\nOn her way to the final of the WTA event in Nürnberg, Germany, Andrea Petkovic upset top-seeded Jelena Jankovic. Both players received wild card entries into the tournament. Petkovic had missed months of action due to various injuries. Once ranked in the top 10, she had dropped to 103rd in the world. “I am glad my body has allowed me to play tennis again,” Petkovic said. “It was also mentally important for me to play such a match against a top-20 player.’” Serving for the match at 5-3, Petkovic lost the first three points, falling to a 0-40 deficit. But her Serb opponent produced error after error, giving Petkovic the victory.\n\nSOUTHERN CAL OPEN PARTNER\n\nTonic by Martina Hingis has been named the Official Clothing Partner of the Southern California Open, a WTA Premier 700 event that will be held July 27-August 4 in Carlsbad, California, USA. The youngest Grand Slam tournament champion of this era and the youngest player to be ranked number one in the world, Hingis will be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame next month. She is collaborating with Tonic to create her own signature tennis collection. The pieces were created for the high intensity movements of tennis.\n\nSIGNED UP\n\nSerbia’s top two female players – Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic – along with Italy’s Flavia Pennetta have announced they will be play in the Southern California Open, a major stop on the Emirates Airline US Open Series calendar. Others in the field include reigning Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka and 2012 Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska. The 28th edition of the Southern California Open will be played at the La Costa Resort and Spa.\n\nSICK BAY\n\nGael Monfils has pulled out of Wimbledon for “personal reasons.” The 26-year-old Frenchman has just returned to action after being sidelined with a knee injury. He said he withdrew his request for a Wimbledon wild card because he had to deal with a personal problem that could not be delayed. He didn’t elaborate. Once ranked as high as seventh in the world, Monfils fell to 119th in the ATP rankings before rebounding to 67th following a series of good results.\n\nSPOTS SECURED\n\nRafael Nadal has already earned a spot in the Barclay’s ATP World Tour Finals, which will be held in London on November 4-11. Since returning from a knee injury that sidelined him for seven months, Nadal has reached the final in all of the nine events he has played, winning seven titles, including a record eighth French Open crown. While Nadal is currently fifth in the world rankings, he is first in the current Race standings and guaranteed a top-eight finish and end-of-season showpiece event. Nadal missed last year’s World Tour Finals due to the knee injury that also forced him out of the London Olympics, the US Open and this year’s Australian Open. He has qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for nine straight yeas. In 2010, Nadal lost to Roger Federer in the title match.\n\nAlso qualifying for the season-ending event are brothers Bob and Mike Bryan, the world’s top-ranked doubles team. The 35-year-old American twins are three-time ATP World Tour Finals champions, winning in 2003-04 and 2009. The Bryans have qualified for the season finale for the 12th consecutive year. They are trying to finish the season ranked number one in the world for a ninth time and fifth consecutive season.\n\nSUSPENDED\n\nYannick Ebbinghaus of the Netherlands has been suspended for six months and fined USD $10,000 for violating tennis’s betting rules. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) said the 23-year-old Ebbinghaus admitted to 67 violations between May 2012 and February 2013. The ITF said he can cut three months off his suspension if he commits no future violations and attends anti-corruption education training. If Ebbinghaus cooperates with the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) in educating others about the ban on betting, half of his fine will be waived. Under tennis rules, players are prohibited from betting on matches.\n\nSISTERS AND SELES\n\nSisters Venus and Serena Williams will play a doubles exhibition match against Monica Seles and Canada’s Eugenie Bouchard to kick off the Rogers Cup competition in Toronto, Canada. The match will be played August 5 on the opening night of the week-long WTA tournament. A member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, Seles will be returning to Toronto for the first time since she was inducted into the Rogers Cup Hall of Fame in 2009. She won the Rogers Cup in 1995 following a two-year absence from the sport after being stabbed by a spectator at a match in Hamburg, Germany. Bouchard won the Wimbledon junior girls singles in 2012. The Williams sisters had received a wild card into the French Open women’s doubles, but withdrew because of an injury suffered by Venus.\n\nSTILL REMEMBERED\n\nThey remember Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon. Still reaping the fruits of his record 11-hour, 5-minute marathon match against John Isner in 2010, Mahut has been given a wild card into this year’s tournament. Mahut lost the first-round match 70-68 in the fifth set. He currently is ranked 224th in the world and could not have entered the main draw without a wild card. The 31-year-old Mahut teamed with fellow Frenchman Michael Llodra to reach the French Open doubles where they lost to American brothers Bob and Mike Bryan.\n\nSINGLES ACHIEVEMENT\n\nThanks to four rain delays, it took more than five hours before Sam Querrey was able to wrap up his 200th career singles victory. That came on the American’s 7-6 (11) 5-7 7-6 (5) win over Aljaz Bedene in the second round at the Queen’s Club grass-court tournament in London, Great Britain. Querrey saved a match point at 6-5 before winning the tiebreaker and wrapping up the victory. Bedene fell hard while hitting a cross-court forehand winner. He received medical attention but was not injured.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nBirmingham: Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua beat Cara Black and Marina Erakovic 7-5 6-4\n\nHalle: Scott Lipsky and Santiago Gonzalez beat Daniele Bracciali and Jonathan Erlich 6-2 7-6 (3)\n\nLondon: Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan beat Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares 4-6 7-5 10-3 (match tiebreak)\n\nNürnberg: Raluca Olaru and Valeria Solovyeva beat Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Kveta Peschke 2-6 7-6 (3) 11-9 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nEastbourne: www.lta.org.uk/\n\n‘s-Hertogenbosch: www.topshelfopen.nl/\n\nWimbledon: www.wimbledon.com\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$618,000 Aegon International, Eastbourne, Great Britain, grass\n\n$541,600 Topshelf Open, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, grass\n\nWOMEN\n\n$637,000 Aegon International, Eastbourne, Great Britain, grass\n\n$235,000 Topshelf Open, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, grass\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN and WOMEN\n\nThe Championships, Wimbledon, Great Britain, grass (first week)\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nRafael Nadal beat Roger Federer 6-1 6-3 to win the men’s singles at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia in Rome, Italy\n\nSerena Williams beat Victoria Azarenka 6-1 6-3 to win the women’s singles at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia in Rome, Italy\n\nGael Monfils beat Michael Llodra 7-5 7-6 (5) to win the BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux in Bordeaux, France\n\nLucie Safarova beat Alexandra Cadantu 3-6 6-1 6-1 to win the Sparta Prague Open in Prague, Czech Republic\n\nSAYING\n\n“I’m playing much better than I dreamed of a few months ago. I’m doing the right things to play well.” – Rafael Nadal, following his thrashing of Roger Federer in the final at Rome.\n\n“Rafa was just too good today.” – Roger Federer.\n\n“It wasn’t really easy out there. I just came up with the good shots at the right times.” – Serena Williams, following her victory over Victoria Azarenka in the women’s final at Rome.\n\n“She definitely showed incredible tennis today. But I don’t think the score says how close the match was. She was better at the key moments. – Victoria Azarenka.\n\n“I love the clay. I haven’t had many wins at Roland Garros, but I do love it. I love to slide. My goal is just to win a match there this year.” – Serena Williams.\n\n“These are emotional moments for me as I think I have managed to turn around a situation in which after many months of doubts I am able to play at a level that I would not have dreamed of four months ago.” – Rafael Nadal, following his semifinal win over Tomas Berdych.\n\n“It was a very weird match. I lost concentration and I started to play too defensively and did not convert my opportunities and I lost this match on my own.” – Novak Djokovic, after losing to Tomas Berdych in Rome.\n\n“It’s a special victory. I was on 11 defeats in a row (against Djokovic) and it had to stop.” – Tomas Berdych, who upset Novak Djokovic in a quarterfinal match in Rome.\n\n“It goes to show that’s what every player should do. Now he’s as strong as ever and is going to be the favorite for Roland Garros.” – Roger Federer, impressed with Rafael Nadal’s game.\n\n“The lady in the mirror is the ultimate opponent for me. I’m going to try and win every match and be really cautious going for every point.” – Serena Williams, referring to Roland Garros, where she was upset in the first round last year.\n\n“It’s always tough to play someone from the same country – we were in the national team together, and we trained and practiced for a long time together. It’s like being twins on the tour, and it’s tough to fight against each other on the court. But I was really happy I could beat her today.” – Li Na, after beating fellow Chinese Zheng Jie 6-3 6-1 at Rome.\n\n“Nothing is ever perfect. I learned that last year when I felt perfect.” – Serena Williams, remembering last year’s Roland Garros when she was upset in the first round.\n\nSEVENTH TITLE\n\nNot only is he back, but Rafael Nadal is back with a vengeance. Just ask Roger Federer. Nadal dominated his Swiss foe to win his seventh Italian Open title. How dominant was he? It tied for the second most lopsided win in the 30-match series between the two superstars. “For that to happen between two players with not that much difference, it has to be because one player plays very well and the other is having more mistakes than usual. That’s all,” said Nadal, who improved to 20-10 in his career against Federer. It was the Spaniard’s sixth title since returning earlier this year following a seven-month layoff because of a knee injury. “If you told me four or five months ago that after eight tournaments I would have won six titles from eight finals, I would say you are crazy,” said Nadal, who will be ranked fourth in the world in the Emirates ATP Rankings. “To win three (ATP World Tour) Master 1000 and two (ATP World Tour) 500 tournaments is more than I ever dreamed.” Nadal and Federer have met in 20 finals, tying the Ivan Lendl-John McEnroe rivalry for most championship matchups in the Open era. Until he met Nadal, Federer had sailed through the week without dropping a set. But against Nadal, nothing worked for the Swiss master as he committed 32 unforced errors to just eight for Nadal. Rome remains one of the few important tournaments that Federer has never won. He lost to Nadal in the 2006 final and to Felix Mantilla in 2003.\n\nSUCCESSFUL RUN\n\nFor Serena Williams, it’s the best time of her tennis life. The American won her fourth consecutive title and ran her winning streak to a career-best 24 matches as she put the finishing touches on her preparation for Roland Garros. She didn’t drop a set as she captured her second Internazionali BNL d’Italia title by adding Victoria Azarenka to her list of trampled opponents. “I moved better than I did all week,” Williams said after her 6-1 6-3 title triumph. “Hopefully I can stay like this. I feel really good.” Williams broke Azarenka’s service twice to begin the match and grab a 3-0 lead. She hit winners off Azarenka’s first and second serves and dictated play at every opportunity. Showing her frustration, Azarenka twice slammed her racquet to the court in desperation. Williams held a 41-12 edge in winners. It was Serena’s fourth consecutive title of the year, also winning in Miami, Charleston, South Carolina, USA, and Madrid, Spain. Until now, the longest match winning streak Williams has had in her career was 21 – and that was done twice, in 2002 and 2003 – a decade ago. And the only other time she won the Italian Open was in 2002 – the year she also captured her lone Roland Garros title.\n\nSENT HOME\n\nOn the advice of his doctor, Juan Martin del Potro has returned home to Argentina. Del Potro withdrew two weeks ago from the Portugal Open because of a respiratory illness. He then played last week in Rome, but was upset in the third round by Frenchman Benoit Paire 6-4 7-6 (3). Because he was still suffer ring from a decline in “physical and respiratory capacity” due to a bronchial spasm, the right-hander’s doctor recommended that he return to Argentina for further medical treatment to speed his recovery.\n\nSICK BAY\n\nA lower back problem was the cause of Andy Murray’s retirement from the Italian Open. The Scot stopped the match right after he won the second set to pull even with Marcel Granollers of Spain and having already received on-court treatment. “I pulled out because there is a good chance I wouldn’t be playing tomorrow,” Murray said. “We’ll have to wait for Paris. I’d be very surprised if I were playing in Paris.” Later, the official ATP website quoted Murray as saying: “I’ll need to take some days off and see how it settles down, but a few days can make a difference. I’ll try and get it sorted, but it has been an issue for some while. So I want to make sure that it’s something that I can sort out. It’s not enjoyable to play now.” Murray’s retirement came on his 26th birthday.\n\nSIDELINED\n\nSickness also caused Maria Sharapova to withdraw from her quarterfinal match in Rome against seventh-seeded Sara Errani of Italy. Seeking her third consecutive Italian Open title, Sharapova said on Twitter that she “didn’t recover after being sick last week and it got me against last night.” The Russian appeared to be in great shape the day before when she crushed 16th-seeded Sloane Stephens 6-2 6-1. The withdrawal gave Errani a spot in the semifinals, where she lost to Victoria Azarenka.\n\nIt was the second straight day Errani received help from her Russian opponents. She was leading 6-3 2-0 when Maria Kirilenko retired from their match with a left knee injury. Because of her success in her home tournament, Errani moved up to a career-high ranking of fifth in the world, becoming only the second Italian to be ranked in the top five. Francesca Schiavone made it as high as fourth in the world in 2011.\n\nSUSPENSION OVER\n\nFernando Romboli of Brazil has completed an 8½-month suspension for a doping violation. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) said Romboli tested positive for two banned diuretics – furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide – at a lower-tier ATP Challenger event in Bogotá, Colombia, last July. Denying any intent to enhance his performance, the 24-year-old said the substances came from a contaminated supplement that had been prescribed by a doctor. The ITF said he accepted Romboli’s defense and gave him a reduced penalty because there was no “significant fault or negligence.” The suspension began September 1, 2012.\n\nSTRAIGHT IN\n\nFrenchman Gael Monfils has a spot in this year’s Roland Garros, thanks to a wild card from the tournament organizers. The 26-year-old was a semifinalist at the clay court Grand Slam tournament in 2008, but has seen his ranking dropped while he suffered a string of injuries in 2012. Once ranked seventh in the world in 2011, Monfils had dropped to 119th. Other men receiving wild card entries into Roland Garros were American Alex Kuznetsov, Australia’s John Millman and Frenchmen Marc Gicquel, Nicolas Mahut, Adrian Mannarino, Lucas Pouille and Florent Serra.\n\nVirginie Razzano of France was also handed an automatic entry into this year’s two-week event, which gets underway next week. Last year, Razzano shocked Serena Williams in the opening round. Other women receiving wild cards include Aravane Rezai, Claire Feuerstein, Stephanie Foretz-Gacon, Caroline Garcia and Irena Pavlovic, all of France; Ashleigh Barty of Australia and Shelby Rogers of the United States.\n\nSISTER ACT\n\nVery few players want to see Venus Williams as their first-round opponent. It’s downright cruel and unusual punishment to have her sister, Serena, waiting in the second round in case you win. That’s what happened to Great Britain’s Laura Robson at the Internazionali BNL d’Italia. She pulled off the first feat, stopping Venus in straight sets. Little sister Serena perhaps was seeking a little revenge as she eliminated Robson 6-2 6-2. “She’s number one in the world for a reason,” Robson said of Serena. “She didn’t give me many opportunities.” Despite the outcome, Serena Williams was impressed with the youngster. “She played really well and really smart,” Serena said. “I think she has such a big future, and I really like her as a person, too.”\n\nSTYMIED\n\nCaroline Wozniacki was so close to winning her opening round Italian Open match against Bojana Jovanovski. So close several times. She was up a break in the second set at 4-3 and led 4-0 in the third set. Wozniacki served for the match at 5-4 and built a 5-2 advantage in the third-set tiebreak, two points from victory. Instead, it was Jovanovski who triumphed in the nearly three-hour match, 2-6 6-4 7-6 (5). It has been a rough stretch for Wozniacki, who lost in the first round of the Madrid Open to Yaroslava Shvedova and in her first match in Stuttgart, Germany, last month to Carla Suárez Navarro. Until her victory over the former world number one, Jovanovski had lost eight consecutive matches. The Serb had not won since mid-January at the Australian Open.\n\nSPORTS MIXER\n\nJamie Murray is proving to be as good at golf as he is in tennis. The older brother Andy Murray clinched the victory for Scotland in the inaugural Celebrity Cup at Golf Live. Murray joined with Kenny Logan, an ex-rugby star, and soccer legends Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish and Gordon Strachan as Scotland beat England, Wales and Ireland. The 27-year-old Murray, a former Wimbledon mixed doubles champion, was the hero for Scotland as he landed a pitch from 100 yards to within six feet in the nearest-the-pin shootout with England. The event helped raise nearly USD $83,500 for the Elizabeth Montgomerie Foundation, which was established in 2007 by golfer Colin Montgomerie in memory of his mother, who died of cancer.\n\nSIGNED\n\nBernard Tomic and Lleyton Hewitt, the future and past of Australian tennis, have committed to play in this summer’s Citi Open in Washington, DC, USA. Already committed to play in the event, which begins July 27, are top-ranked American John Isner and Frenchman Gael Monfils. Tomic will be making his Citi Open debut, while Hewitt is returning to the nation’s capital after a two-year absence.\n\nSOON TO BE BACK\n\nJelena Dokic, who has been ranked as high as fourth in the world, is planning to rejoin the WTA Tour after being sidelined with a wrist injury since April 2012. “I am starting with smaller events to get some more matches,” she said. “Then I will see where I am at. At this stage, it is all about being healthy and taking one step at a time.”\n\nSEEKING HELP\n\nMarcos Baghdatis, who has seen his ranking slip from eighth in the world to 38th, has begun working with a new coach. Zeljko Krajan of Croatia is working with Baghdatis on a trial basis until Wimbledon. He replaces Yiannos Hadjigeorgiou. Baghdatis had sought advice from former world number three Ivan Ljubicic on where to turn next. Ljubicic recommended his countryman, who is from the same city in Croatia as is Baghdatis’s wife, Karolina Sprem, a former player on the WTA tour. “He has worked a lot with the women’s tour,” Baghdatis said of Krajan, “but he was top 100 before on the ATP World Tour, so I think he has a lot to offer. “He’s the Croatia Davis Cup coach as well. I think he can help me a lot.”\n\nSPECIAL MAN\n\nThe only person to win the Grand Slam twice, Rod Laver will receive the Eugene L. Scott Award at the International Tennis Hall of Fame’s Legends Ball in New York City during the US Open. The award is given annually in memory of the late Tennis Week founder to an individual who has shown a commitment to tennis and has made a positive impact on the sport. Laver also will participate at this summer’s Rolex Hall of Fame Enshrinement Weekend at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, SA. He will pay tribute to Australian tennis great Thelma Coyne Long, who will be among this year’s enshrinees.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nBordeaux: Christopher Kas and Oliver Marach beat Nicholas Monroe and Simon Stadler 2-6 6-4 10-1 (match tiebreak)\n\nPrague: Renata Voracova and Barbora Zahlavova Strycova beat Irina Falconi and Eva Hrdinova 6-4 6-0\n\nRome (men): Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan beat Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna 6-2 6-3\n\nRome (women): Hsieh Su-Wei and Peng Shuai beat Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci 4-6 6-3 10-8 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nDüsseldorf: http://power-horse-cup.com/\n\nNice: www.opennicecotedazur.com/\n\nBrussels: www.wta-brusselsopen.com\n\nStrasbourg: www.internationaux-strasbourg.fr/\n\nParis: www.rolandgarros.com\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$532,623 Power Horse Cup, Düsseldorf, Germany, clay\n\n$532,623 Open de Nice Côte d’Azur, Nice, France, clay\n\nWOMEN\n\n$690,000 Brussels Open, Brussels, Belgium, clay\n\n$235,000 Internationaux de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France, clay\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN & WOMEN\n\nRoland Garros, Paris, France, clay (first week)\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nStanislas Wawrinka beat David Ferrer 6-1 6-4 to win the Portugal Open men’s singles in Oeiras, Portugal\n\nTommy Haas beat Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 7-6 (3) to win the BMW Open in Munich, Germany\n\nAnastasia Pavlyuchenkova beat Carla Suárez Navarro 7-5 6-2 to win the women’s singles at the Portugal Open in Oeiras, Portugal\n\nAdrian Ungur beat Diego Sebastian Schwartzman, 4-6 6-0 6-2 to win the Tunis Open in Tunis, Tunisia\n\nJiri Vesely beat Steve Darcis 6-4 6-4 to win the Prosperita Open 2013 in Ostrava, Czech Republic\n\nVasek Pospisil beat Michal Przysiezny 6-7 (7) 6-0 6-1 to win the Soweto Open in Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nSAYING\n\n“It’s a sensational feeling to be quite honest. It was another one of those milestones that I hoped for, to maybe win this title one year. To have done that, this late in my career, is a big highlight for me.” – Tommy Haas, after winning the BMW Open.\n\n“It feels great to have won a title again, as it was one of my goals at the start of the year. It was a challenge against a top four player. I am very happy with the way I played today. I was really focused and I made it difficult for him on my serve.” – Stanislas Wawrinka, after upsetting David Ferrer to win the Portugal Open men’s singles.\n\n“Stan played a great match. I was never close to winning.” – David Ferrer.\n\n“She was holding me back on the baseline, putting a lot of spin on the ball and moving me around. But I just tried to start playing point by point, fighting every point. It wasn’t easy, but I just tried to dig deep and fight, and that really helped me in the end.” – Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who won the Portugal Open women’s title by beating Carla Suárez Navarro.\n\n“Today I had chances to win the first set, but Nastia was playing so well at those moments, and then she played really, really well in the second set. She just kept getting better as the match went on and deserved to win today. But it was a really good week for me. I’m very happy I was able to make another final here.” – Carla Suárez Navarro.\n\n“I think today both of us were so nervous and so tight. We’re just glad it’s finally over. It wasn’t the prettiest match for both teams, but we had some good points and definitely happy to win.” – Dmitry Tursunov, who teamed with Jarkko Nieminen to win the doubles in Munich, Germany.\n\n“It feels extremely good. I don’t have that many (doubles) titles.” – Jarkko Nieminen, who won his third career ATP World Tour doubles crown.\n\nBrad Drewett\n\n“Today is a very sad day for sport and tennis in particular. Our president Brad has passed away.” – Rafael Nadal.\n\n“He was always very nice to work with. Very honest and gentle. For me, it was hard seeing him not be the same anymore towards the end physically. But we can only appreciate what he’s done for us and what he did until the last moment he really possibly could. That will never go away.” – Roger Federer.\n\n“He was a very brave man with the courage to stand up and try to change some things in our sport for the better. We remember him as a very calm, composed and intelligent man who loved this sport with all his heart while he was playing, coaching, and then as the president of ATP.” – Novak Djokovic.\n\n“His knowledge, experience and enthusiasm will be a great loss to the whole sport.” – Francesco Ricci Bitti, International Tennis Federation (ITF) president.\n\n“The recent prize money increases with the Grand Slams are perfect examples of Brad’s brilliant strategic management, and another example of how much he cared about our athletes and the sport’s long-term growth. His legacy as a leader, as a person, and as a father who always put his family first, will have an everlasting impact on tennis.” – Stacey Allaster, WTA Chairman and CEO.\n\n“The tennis world lost a strong leader, true gentleman and a great friend today in ATP Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett. Brad left an indelible mark on the game and everyone who knew him.” –David Haggerty, USTA chairman, CEO and president.\n\n“Tennis has lost a great leader and human being who accomplished so much for the sport he loved.” – Ken Solomon, Tennis Channel chairman and CEO.\n\nSAD NEWS\n\nBrad Drewett, a player, tournament director and executive chairman and president of the ATP, lost his battle with motor neurone disease, also referred to as Lou Gehrig’s Disease. He was 54. The Australian has been credited with making a number of changes within tennis and securing a greater share of Grand Slam tournament revenue for players as well as growing the sport in Asia. Recently, he was listed by the Sports Business Journal as one of the 50 most influential people in sport. Before he retired from playing in 1990, Drewett was ranked in the top 40 in singles and top 20 in doubles. In 2006, he was named ATP Chief Executive Officer for the International Group, overseeing the operations in the Middle East, Asia and Pacific regions. From 2003 to 2005 he led the region as Managing Director. In January 2012, he was named ATP executive chairman and president. This past January, he announced he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that affects voluntary muscle activity, including speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing. When he announced a new sponsor on the opening day of the Australian Open, his speech was noticeably slurred. He had planned to step down once a successor was found. He died at his home in Sydney, Australia.\n\nSENIOR STUD\n\nAge is just a number to Tommy Haas. In his 10th attempt at the Munich, Germany, tournament, the 35-year-old won the BMW Open for the first time. And he beat defending champion Philipp Kohlschreiber in the first all-German final in Munich in 48 years. “I can hardly believe that I still managed to win here after such a long career,” Haas said. He became the first 35-year-old to win an ATP Tour title since Fabrice Santoro captured Newport, Rhode Island, USA, in 2008. It was Haas’s fourth title in Germany and 14th overall. With the victory, Haas will move up to 13th in the world rankings. So far this year Haas has reached the final in San Jose, California, USA, and upset top-ranked Novak Djokovic in his run to the semifinals in Miami, Florida, USA. “Every time you win a title, it’s a reflection of putting everything together the whole week,” Haas said. “It doesn’t happen that often. You’re really proud of those moments.”\n\nSTAN’S THE MAN\n\nSwitzerland’s Stanislas Wawrinka, playing aggressively right from the start, dominated their baseline rallies to upset top-seeded David Ferrer and win the Portugal Open. “Stan played pretty well from the baseline and he had a good percentage of first services. He surpassed me in everything,” Ferrer said after losing to Wawrinka for just the fourth time in 11 career meetings. The winner won the first five games of the match and closed out the opening set in 30 minutes. With the two tied at 4 in the second set, Wawrinka broke Ferrer at 30, then held to capture his fourth career ATP World Tour title and first of 2013. “It is going to be tough to return to the Top 10, but I am definitely playing better than last year and I am improving,” said Wawrinka, who is ranked 16th in the world. “Today I got the confidence that I can beat a top four player in a final on a clay court.”\n\nSICK CALL\n\nJuan Martin del Potro withdrew from the Madrid Open because of a viral infection. Last year the Argentine reached the semifinals at the Spanish clay court event. “He has a virus and will not be fit to play. We wish him a fast recovery,” a statement on the tournament’s website said. David Goffin of Belgium took del Potro’s place in the main draw.\n\nSIDELINED\n\nBig-serving Ivo Karlovic of Croatia is recovering in a hospital in Miami, Florida, USA after being admitted with viral meningitis. Ranked as high as 14th in the world at one time, Karlovic was rumored to have suffered a stroke. But his wife Alsi said it wasn’t true. “Ivo did not have a stroke, as some outlets have stated,” she said in a statement released by the ATP Tour. “Rather, he has viral meningitis. We ask for privacy during his recovery process. We thank everyone for their support and well wishes.” The 6-foot-10 (2.08m) Karlovic last played at a Challenger in Sarasota, Florida, USA, last month.\n\nSTRING CONTINUES\n\nFor a while it looked as if Carla Suárez Navarro was finally going to beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and win a tournament title. Both would be firsts for the Spaniard. Alas, neither was to be. Suárez Navarro took a 5-3 lead in the opening set. But Pavlyuchenkova staved off three set points – one in the ninth game and two more in the 10th – before winning 10 of the last 12 games of the match. “I had a slow start, the Russian said. “I was a little bit disappointed about that. It was the third match this week I started like that. Also, Carla was playing really well.” The winner called her coach – Martina Hingis – onto the court in the first set. “I think I just needed some positive words from Martina out there,” Pavlyuchenkova said. It paid off as she beat Suárez Navarro for the fifth time without a loss and captured her fifth career title – her first on clay. Suárez Navarro fell to 0-5 in WTA finals.\n\nSTOPPED BY BACK\n\nA back problem has caused Venus Williams to withdraw from the Madrid Open. The 32-year-old American, once ranked number one in the world, pulled out of the clay-court event before her first-round match against Spanish wild card Anabel Medina Garrigues. Williams was replaced in the draw by Switzerland’s Stefanie Voegele, who lost to Medina Garrigues 6-3 6-3.\n\nSENT TO JAIL?\n\nEuropean media is reporting that Bernard Tomic’s father, John, has been arrested after allegedly head-butting his son’s training partner, Thomas Drouet. There are reports that the 29-year-old Drouet’s nose was broken after the former tour player tried to break up an argument between the Tomics. In a statement, Tennis Australia said it was working closely with ATP officials who are investigating the incident. The ruckus reportedly occurred after Bernard Tomic suffered his third first-round loss of the year, this time to Czech veteran Radek Stepanek at the Madrid Open.\n\nSAYS NO\n\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) backed the referee who awarded a Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group II tie to New Zealand because of an unplayable court. Pakistan was defaulted when their home tie played in Myanmar was halted because of a hole in the court. Pakistan had won the first match and was leading in the second when referee Ashita Ajigala of Sri Lanka ruled that the grass court in Yangon had become unplayable and dangerous. The Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) appealed the ruling, but the ITF’s Davis Cup Committee upheld the referee’s decision. There were only two grass courts at the facility where the tie was played. “The Committee noted that the poor quality of the original match court led the referee to designate the practice court as the match court,” the ITF said in its statement. The tie was played in Myanmar after New Zealand refused to visit Pakistan because of safety concerns. The PTF could still appeal to the ITF Board of Directors, the ITF statement said.\n\nSET FOR PARIS\n\nAlex Kuznetsov and Shelby Rogers have earned wild cards into the main draw at the French Open. Kuznetsov received the men’s wild card by having the best combined results at clay court Challenger tournaments in Sarasota and Tallahassee, Florida, USA, as well as Savannah, Georgia, USA. Rogers earned her wild card in the women’s singles main draw by accumulating the greatest number of WTA ranking points at two of the three USTA Pro Circuit USD $50,000 clay-court events in Dothan, Alabama; Charlottesville, Virginia, and Indian Harbour Beach, Florida, USA. The 26-year-old Kuznetsov was the junior runner-up at Roland Garros in 2004. When she was a junior, the 20-yearold Rogers won the USTA Girls’ 18s National Championship to earn a wild card into the main draw of the 2010 US Open, her only appearance in a Grand Slam tournament main draw.\n\nSHOWTIME FOR SISTERS\n\nA documentary about the Williams sisters in 2011 – Venus and Serena – will have its theatrical release this week. Serena, in a video introduction that will be shown at a theater in New York City, says that 2011 was “one of the most difficult years of my whole entire life.” The New York screening will be hosted by Billie Jean King and John McEnroe. Maiken Baird and Michelle Major spent almost four years trying to convince the sisters to participate in the first feature-length documentary on their lives. At the time of the negotiations, Serena and Venus were ranked one and two in the world. But just after the filming began in January 2011, Venus dropped out of the Australian Open with a hip injury, the first time she had ever withdrawn from a Grand Slam tournament. A couple months later, Serena was hospitalized with a pulmonary embolism. By September, Venus announced she had been diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disease that can cause muscle pain, arthritis and fatigue. The film also deals with their father, Richard Williams, and has little-seen footage from their early days in Compton, California, USA.\n\nSECRETS?\n\nChris Evert has struck back at her former fiancé Jimmy Connors, who hinted in a new book at their relationship ended because she had an abortion. “In his book, Jimmy Connors has written about a time in our relationship that was very personal and emotionally painful,” Evert said in a statement. “I am extremely disappointed that he used the book to misrepresent a private matter that took place 40 years ago and made it public without my knowledge. I hope everyone can understand that I have no further comment.” The two were at the top of tennis when they both won Wimbledon singles titles in 1974 and were due to get married later that year. In his memoir, “The Outsider,” Connors hints he broke off the relationship. “An issue had arisen as a result of youthful passion,” he wrote. “I was perfectly happy to let nature take its course and accept responsibility for what was to come. Chrissie, however, had already made up her mind that the timing was bad and too much was riding on her future. … It was a horrible feeling, but I knew it was over. Getting married wasn’t going to be good for either of us.” Evert was 19 at the time, Connors three years older.\n\nSIGNED UP\n\nDefending champion Marin Cilic, former world number one Lleyton Hewitt and American Sam Querrey will play the AEGON Championships at Queen’s Club in June. The field for the grass-court warm-up for Wimbledon also includes Andy Murray, Tomas Berdych, Juan Martin del Potro and Jo Wilfried Tsonga. The tournament begins June 10. While Cilic will be seeking a second straight title, Hewitt will be going for a record fifth crown. The Australian is tied with Boris Becker, John McEnroe and Andy Roddick with four Queen’s Club titles.\n\nTwo of the players – Andy Murray and Tomas Berdych – are already scheduled to play on finals day. Murray and Tim Henman will play Berdych and Ivan Lendl in Rally Against Cancer, a doubles exhibition to raise money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.\n\nSHOULDER SURGERY\n\nDavid Nalbandian has undergone surgery on his right shoulder. The Argentine’s shoulder was operated on by his personal doctor, Angel Luis Cotorro, in Barcelona, Spain. Nalbandian said he hopes to be recovered in time to play for Argentina against the Czech Republic in a Davis Cup World Group semifinal in September. Doctors have said it will take four months for Nalbandian to recover.\n\nSTRONG FIELD\n\nFor the first time in nine years, Rafael Nadal will play in Roger Federer’s hometown tournament. Organizers of the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland, said their field for the October 19-27 event will be headed by five-time champion Federer, Nadal and defending champion Juan Martin del Potro. The last time he played in Basel, in 2004, Nadal lost a first-round match to Rainer Schuettler of Germany. He also lost early to another Spaniard, Feliciano Lopez, in 2003, the only year he and Federer were both in the Basel field. The Swiss Indoors, played on carpet then, is now a hard-court tournament.\n\nSUGARPOVA\n\nMaria Sharapova made a one-day trip to Moscow to present her “Sugarpova” candy brand to the Russian market. She has introduced her candy to several other markets, including the United States. But she says tennis remains her main focus. “Right now tennis is the most important for me,” she said. She also said she plans to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. A small pack of “Sugarpova” sweets sells in Moscow for 175 rubles (USD $5.66).\n\nSERVING UP PORSCHES\n\nRumors are floating that the new Porsche 911 4S being driven by Bulgarian tennis star Grigor Dimitrov is a present from Maria Sharapova. The Swiss media is reporting that Dimitrov’s new vehicle is the same car Sharapova received for winning the Porsche Open in Stuttgart, Germany. “I am not a car collector, but my friend is mad about them,” Sharapova said. In his bio, Dimitrov lists cars among his hobbies. Dimitrov, who turns 22 later this month, and the 26-year-old Sharapova have been an item since the start of the year. And while neither player has confirmed the relationship, they haven’t denied it either.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nJohannesburg: Prakash Amritraj and Rajeev Ram bat Purav Raja and Divu Sharan 7-6 (1) 7-6 (1)\n\nMunich: Jarkko Nieminen and Dmitry Tursunov beat Marcos Baghdatis and Eric Butorac 6-1 6-4\n\nOeiras (men): Santiago Gonzalez and Scott Lipsky beat Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi and Jean-Julien Rojer 6-3 4-6 10-7 (match tiebreak)\n\nOeiras (women): Chian Hao-Ching and Kristina Mladenovic beat Darija Jurak and Katalin Marosi 7-6 (3) 6-2\n\nOstrava: Steve Darcis and Olivier Rochus beat Tomasz Bednarek and Mateuz Kowalczyk 7-5 7-5\n\nTunis: Domink Meffert and Philipp Oswald beat Jamie Delgado and Andreas Siljestrom 3-6 7-6 (0) 10-7 (match tiebreak)\n\nSURFING\n\nMadrid: www.madrid-open.com/\n\nCagnes-Sur-Mer: www.opendecagnes.com\n\nRome: www.internazionalibnlditalia.com/\n\nPrague: www.spartapragueopen.cz\n\nBordeaux: www.atp-primrosebordeaux.com/\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$4,404,383 Mutua Madrid Open, Madrid, Spain, clay\n\n$125,000 Kunming Challenger, Kunming, China, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$5,273,930 Mutua Madrid Open, clay\n\n$100,000 Open de Cagnes-Sur-Mer Alpes-Maritimes, Cagnes-Sur-Mer, France, clay\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$3,470,878 Internazionali BNL d’Italia, Rome, Italy, clay\n\n$111,351 BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France\n\nWOMEN\n\n$2,369,000 Internazionali BNL d’Italia, Rome, Italy, clay\n\n$100,000 Sparta Prague Open, Prague, Czech Republic, clay\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nRafael Nadal beat Nicolas Almagro 6-4 6-3 to win the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell in Barcelona, Spain\n\nMaria Sharapova beat Li Na 6-4 6-3 to win the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany\n\nLukas Rosol beat Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3 6-2 to win the BRD Nastase Tiriac Trophy in Bucharest, Romania\n\nFrancesca Schiavone beat Lourdes Domínguez Lino 6-1 6-3 to win the Grand Prix De SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem in Marrakech, Morocco\n\nSAYING\n\n“I feel very happy to lift the trophy once again here in Barcelona. It means a lot especially after the difficult year I’ve had. The conditions were very difficult today, especially in the first six games as it was raining a lot.” – Rafael Nadal, after winning the Barcelona title for the eighth time in nine years.\n\n“With the rain, the ball got heavier and it wasn’t the same for me anymore. The speed went down and he was able to stay more in the point. I fought all week to be able to be in the final and I reached my goal. Once there, you want to win, so yes I feel a bit disappointed about it, but I need to look at it positively and it’s been a great week for me overall.” – Nicolas Almagro.\n\n“We have faced each other so many times so there are really no secrets between us in our games. It’s not really about one thing we do well or don’t do well, you have to do a lot of things well on a consistent basis. It’s really about who goes out and executes best on the day.” – Maria Sharapova, after beating Li Na to win the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix.\n\n“Of course it’s sad when you lose in the final, but looking back at the whole week, it was the first clay court tournament of the year for me, so I’m happy to have reached the final here.” – Li Na.\n\n“I will remember this week. It was very emotional for me and is something special. I found a way to beat some good players and succeed.” – Lukas Rosol, who won the BRD Nastase Tiriac Trophy.\n\n“Today, I couldn’t play my game. I didn’t have enough power anymore. At the end, he was playing better than me.” – Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, following his loss to Lukas Rosol in the Bucharest final.\n\n“It wasn’t Ferrer’s best match. He didn’t play his best tennis. He had the advantage over me because he’s been playing on clay. But I played very quickly and I didn’t make it easy for him.” – Dmitry Tursunov, after upsetting David Ferrer 7-5 3-6 6-1 in the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell.\n\n“We dreamed about playing here together. We had a scare the last couple weeks with Horia being injured, so it could not have turned out better. We had unbelievable support from the crowd and Horia produced the best tennis for us to come through in this match. I’ve never been part of a doubles match with this kind of support.” – Max Mirnyi, who teamed with Horia Tecau to win the doubles in Bucharest, Romania.\n\n“This title means a lot to me. It’s very special and you cannot compare it to any other title. Playing at home is always special and the atmosphere was great this week.” – Horia Tecau, after winning the BRD Nastase Tiriac Trophy doubles.\n\n“Every week you win a tournament, it’s something special. We lost in the first round in our last two tournaments and we got through a tough first round here. We started to play better and better. Today was just a very good day.” – Alexander Peya, who won the doubles in Barcelona with Bruno Soares.\n\n“It was a great week. It was very strange and different. We played in a lot of sun the first two matches and then had to wait three days to play in the semifinals. Today, we played two unbelievable matches. In the final, they played really well and fought hard. But we stayed positive and played our best at the end.” – Bruno Soares.\n\nSAME OLD RAFA\n\nThe same old Rafael Nadal – the winning one – is back, and with a vengeance. After being sidelined with a left knee injury for seven months, the Spaniard has reached the final in all six events he has played and won four of them, most of anybody this season on the ATP World Tour. By beating fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro in the final, Nadal won the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell for the eighth time in nine years. “I’m very happy,” Nadal said. “It has been an important week for all the Spanish players here and especially for me. It is an enormous honor for me to win here again.” And again and again and again. The final didn’t start the way Nadal wanted as he lost his serve twice to fall behind 3-0. Almagro was able to win only one more game that set. The left-hander broke again early in the second set and steadily pulled away to beat Almagro for the 10th straight time and post his 39th consecutive win in Barcelona. So dominant is Nadal at Barcelona that he has won 80 of the 82 sets he has played in the tournament. “Rafa has shown once again why he is the best player in history on this surface,” Almagro said. “He is one of the greats on the tennis circuit and as Spaniards we are all very proud of him.”\n\nSHARP SHARAPOVA\n\nShe may have struggled to get to the title match in Stuttgart, Germany, but Maria Sharapova was dominating in the final as she blasted her way past Li Na in a battle of the last two French Open champions. “She was the second seed and someone who I had lost to the last time we played … so I knew it would be the toughest match of the tournament,” Sharapova said. “I really tried to do the right things from the beginning to the end and not have a letdown like I did in the other matches.” In all three of her previous matches, the top-seeded Sharapova was pushed to three sets. Li never stood a chance as the Russian right-hander burst out to a 4-1 double-break lead in the first set, then won the last four games of the match. “I think I really played my best tennis of the week today,” Sharapova said. Li agreed. “You never know what will happen when we play, it’s always 50-50, but today she was the better one,” Li said. Sharapova collected her 29th WTA title and extended her clay court streak to 16 consecutive matches, including Rome and Roland Garros last year. And while Li may have lost this time, the two finalists have some of the best records on the WTA tour. Sharapova is now 22-3 on the season, Li 20-4.\n\nSON’S TRIBUTE\n\nLukas Rosol’s father died just 10 days before the final of the BRD Nastase Tiriac Trophy in Bucharest, Romania. When Rosol beat Guillermo Garcia-Lopez to win his first career ATP title, he dedicated the victory to his father. “I wanted to dedicate this trophy to someone, so I found the energy,” Rosol said. “I felt somebody was helping me from up top. It’s not just about me. My family has always supported me and my tennis.” Beating three seeded players on his way to the final, Rosol made quick work of his Spanish opponent, taking only 67 minutes to post the win. Among his victims during the week was three-time Bucharest champion Gilles Simon of France. Rosol saved all eight break points he faced to end Simon’s 16-match winning streak in the Romanian capital. “I felt match after match my dream was coming true,” the champion said.\n\nSECURITY FEARS\n\nSecurity was listed as the reason a series of Davis Cup matches scheduled to be held in Yangon, Myanmar, have been canceled. Ties in the Davis Cup’s Asia/Oceania Zone Group III and IV were to be held this week involving players from Muslim nations such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Iraq. However, anti-Muslim riots in Myanmar last month left at least 43 people dead and there was more religious violence last week. Lay Naing, the Myanmar Tennis Federation’s secretary, confirmed the International Tennis Federation (ITF) had voiced security concerns and said: “The other participating countries have also questioned our security.” The ITF website said a new date and venue for the round-robin international competition had not been determined. Countries competing in Group III include Cambodia, Hong Kong-China, Iran, Malaysia, Oman, Pacific Oceania, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. Group IV nations include Bahrain, Bangladesh, Iraq, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Turkmenistan.\n\nA Davis Cup Zone Group II tie between Pakistan and New Zealand held in Myanmar was halted and New Zealand was declared the winner because the referee said it was an unplayable court. Pakistan has disputed the referee’s decision and the ITF’s announcement is expected in early May.\n\nSTRAIGHT TO THE BANK\n\nPrize money at Wimbledon will increase a record 40 percent this year, giving each of the singles champions a payday of USD $2.4 million. Last year’s winners – Roger Federer and Serena Williams – received USD $1.75 million each. Calling it the largest single increase and biggest total prize payout pot in tennis history, the All England Club said it will pay out USD $34.4 million, an increase of USD $9.9 million from last year. The prize money increase will also go to players who lose in the early rounds or in qualifying for the grass-court championships. A first-round loser will earn USD $35,800, up from USD $22,100 a year ago. The purse for qualifying will increase by 41 percent, while doubles players will receive a 22 percent increase.\n\nSTREET NAMED MULLOY\n\nFour times Gardnar Mulloy won the men’s doubles at the US Nationals – now the US Open. And when he teamed with Budge Patty to capture the doubles title at Wimbledon 1957 at the age of 43, he became one of the oldest players ever to take a championship on the fabled lawns. Now 99 years old, Mulloy has had a street in Miami, Florida, USA, named for him. “I think it’s fantastic,” Mulloy said. “How many people have had a street named for them?” In 1952 he was America’s top-ranked player and singles runner-up in the US National Championships. He was a member of the United States Davis Cup team in 1946, 1948-50, 1952-53 and 1957.\n\nSPECIAL TITLE\n\nPlaying in their third final as a team, Max Mirnyi and Horia Tecau finally took home the champion’s trophy. It couldn’t have come at a better place for Tecau – the BRD Nastase Tiriac Trophy in Bucharest, Romania. “This title means a lot to me,” said Tecau, who was born in Brasov, Romania. “It’s very special.” The winning team was presented its trophy by Olympic icon and Romanian gymnastics hero Nadia Comaneci. And while it may have been the first title for the Mirnyi-Tecau team, it was not Tecau’s first win at home. He teamed with Robert Lindstedt of Sweden to capture the Bucharest doubles last year. In the final, Tecau and Mirnyi beat Lukas Dlouhy and Oliver Marach, who were making their team debut.\n\nSTRING OF ERRORS\n\nPlaying in his first clay-court tournament of the year, Dmitry Tursunov upset David Ferrer in a second-round match at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, 7-5 3-6 6-1. “It wasn’t Ferrer’s best match,” Tursunov said in an understatement. “He didn’t play his best tennis.” Like Tursunov, it was Ferrer’s first clay-court match of the season. He sustained a thigh injury in Miami, Florida, USA, where he lost a third-set tiebreaker to Andy Murray in the Sony Open final. It was the Russian’s 11th win over a Top 10 player in his career. “He had the advantage over me because he’s been playing on clay,” Tursunov said of Ferrer. “But I played very quickly and I didn’t make it easy for him. Ferrer was the favorite based on surface and ranking.”\n\nSCHIAVONE VICTORIOUS\n\nIt took nearly a year, but Italy’s Francesca Schiavone has finally won another tournament. The former French Open champion captured the Grand Prix De SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem in Marrakech, Morocco, beating Lourdes Domínguez Lino in the final. The last time Schiavone took home the biggest singles trophy was at the Strasbourg Open last May. “This was a great week for me after a long, very difficult period,” said Schiavone, who now has won six career titles. “I think my two toughest matches of the week were my first match against (Petra) Martic, a very talented young player, and of course today against Lourdes. I played a really complete game today. It’s never easy to play her.” Schiavone made it look easy, however. The sixth seed never faced a break point in the opening set. And, after dropping serve in the fourth game of the second set to trail 3-1, Schiavone broke her opponent’s next two service games to gain control. “To win here is a great start to the clay court season for me and inspires me to keep working hard,” Schiavone said. “I’m just enjoying playing for these crowds and giving the fans the best that I can give.”\n\nSPECIAL SCREENING\n\nTo celebrate Billie Jean King’s straight-set victory over Bobby Riggs 40 years ago, the first and only viewing of the actual event telecast will be screened on July 14 at the Casino Theatre at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, USA. The historic telecast has been donated to the Hall of Fame for the one-time showing. King will introduce the broadcast footage, and then discuss her memories of key moments in the match, what the match meant to her personally and reflect on its lasting impact. More than 30,000 fans packed the Houston Astrodome and millions more tuned in from home to see the dramatic “Battles of the Sexes,” which King won 6-4 6-3 6-3. The screening will be the final event of the International Tennis Hall of Fame’s annual Enshrinement Weekend, when the Hall of Fame Class of 2013 will be inducted.\n\nSTOMACH ILLNESS\n\nA stomach illness has forced Juan Martin Del Potro to pull out of this week’s Portugal Open, where he is the defending champion. “It’s a shame not to have the chance to defend the title,” Del Potro said in a statement. “I had a great time when I went to Estoril, the tournament staff are the friendliest on the circuit and make you feel at home. However, I must prioritize my health and listen to the doctor’s advice.” He is expected to be recovered enough to the Madrid Masters next week.\n\nSET FOR EDGBASTON\n\nBritain’s top two women players, Laura Robson and Heather Watson, have signed up to play the Aegon Classic at the Edgbaston Priory Club in Birmingham, Great Britain, in June. “I always enjoy the grass court season and I am excited to … play in front of a home crowd,” said Robson. “It’s fantastic preparation ahead of Wimbledon. Watson has been sidelined since being diagnosed with glandular fever after the Sony Open in Miami, Florida, USA, where she complained of burnout after losing in the first round. She hopes to return to action in time for the French Open, which begins its two-week run in late May, and then the grass court season.\n\nSTEADILY IMPROVING\n\nWimbledon will put a retractable roof on its Number One Court. The grass-court Grand Slam tournament installed a roof on Centre Court in 2009 so play can continue when rain halts matches on the outer courts. Philip Brook, chairman of the All England Club, said the design process for the Number One Court roof will begin shortly and the roof installed by 2019. Brook said that despite having roofs over two courts, Wimbledon is not planning to play late night sessions. “We are not trying to turn Wimbledon into an event for night time play,” Brook said. “Roofs over our stadia will continue to be used primarily in the event of wet weather.”\n\nSKIPPING TALLAHASSEE\n\nCiting personal reasons, Mardy Fish has withdrawn from next week’s Tallahassee Challenger tournament. The 31-year-old right-hander has been contending with heart trouble as well as anxiety issues. Fish played at Indian Wells, California, USA, his first event in six months. He then withdrew from the Sony Open in Miami, Florida, USA. He entered a couple minor-league USTA Pro Circuit events in an attempt to gain clay court experience. As the top seed, he lost his first-round match at Savannah, Georgia, USA, to Ruben Ramirez Hildalgo. Fish is currently ranked 42nd in the world, but he doesn’t have any points to defend until Wimbledon, where he reached the fourth round last year.\n\nSERVING UP PORSCHES\n\nMaybe it’s because 88 percent of people who buy Porsche cars are men. Whatever the reason, the first global endorser for Porsche will be a woman – Maria Sharapova. “This says a lot about her longevity and her brand power,” said her agent, Max Eisenbud. “To have a company like Porsche that is so high-end and so meticulous to allow her to stand next to their car says a lot.” Of course it doesn’t hurt that she has won the last two Porsches given to the winner of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany. “Maria is the perfect choice,” said Porsche CEO Matthias Mueller. “Her profile and charisma are an ideal fit for Porsche.” Ranked second in the world behind Serena Williams, Sharapova makes about USD $20 million a year in endorsements, more money than any other female athlete. She also has deals with Nike, Cole Haan, Evian, Tag Heuer and Samsung.\n\nSHARED PERFORMANCES\n\nBarcelona: Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares beat Robert Lindstedt and Daniel Nestor 5-7 7-6 (7) 10-4 (match tiebreak)\n\nBucharest: Max Mirnyi and Horia Tecau beat Lukas Dlouhy and Oliver Marach 4-6 6-4 10-6 (match tiebreak)\n\nMarrakech: Timea Babos and Mandy Minella beat Petra Martic and Kristina Mladenovic 6-3 6-1\n\nStuttgart: Mona Barthel and Sabine Lisicki beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Sania Mirza 6-4 7-5\n\nSURFING\n\nOeiras: www.estorilopen.net/\n\nMunich: http://bmwopen.de\n\nOstrava: www.prosperitaopen.cz\n\nTunis: www.tct.org.tn/\n\nJohannesburg: www.tennissa.co.za/\n\nMadrid: www.madrid-open.com/\n\nCagnes-Sur-Mer: www.opendecagnes.com\n\nTOURNAMENTS THIS WEEK\n\n(All money in USD)\n\nMEN\n\n$537,109 Portugal Open, Oeiras, Portugal, clay\n\n$537,109 BMW Open, Munich, Germany, clay\n\n$125,000 Tunis Open, Tunis, Tunisia, clay\n\n$111,351 Prosperita Open 2013, Ostrava, Czech Republic, clay\n\n$100,000 Soweto Open, Johannesburg, South Africa, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$235,000 Portugal Open, Oeiras, Portugal, clay\n\nTOURNAMENTS NEXT WEEK\n\nMEN\n\n$4,404,383 Mutua Madrid Open, Madrid, Spain, clay\n\n$125,000 Kunming Challenger, Kunming, China, hard\n\nWOMEN\n\n$5,273,930 Mutua Madrid Open, clay\n\n$100,000 Open de Cagnes-Sur-Mer Alpes-Maritimes, Cagnes-Sur-Mer, France, clay\n\nBy Bob Greene\n\nSTARS\n\nNovak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal 6-2 7-6 (1) to win the Monte Carlo Rolex Masters in Monte Carlo, Monaco\n\nAlex Kuznetsov beat Wayne Odesnik 6-0 6-2 to win the Sarasota Open in Sarasota, Florida, USA\n\nFED CUP\n\nWorld Group Semifinals\n\nItaly beat Czech Republic 3-1 at Palermo, Italy\n\nRussia beat Slovak Republic 3-2 at Moscow, Russia\n\nWorld Group Playoffs\n\nGermany beat Serbia 3-2 at Stuttgart, Germany; Australia beat Switzerland 3-1 at Chiasso-Seseglio, Switzerland; Spain beat Japan 4-0 at Barcelona, Spain; United States beat Sweden 3-2 at Delray Beach, Florida, USA\n\nWorld Group II Playoffs\n\nPoland beat Belgium 4-1 at Ko"
