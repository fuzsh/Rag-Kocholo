        "text": "After a decade of working for multiple Fortune 100 companies in the financial services industry, I decided to take my talents to South Beach. Okay, technically just south of Atlanta.\n\nWhile guiding families and business owners through the intricate world of finance was gratifying, I recognized that the impact of my work shouldn't be confined to those who met certain investment minimums. I didn't want to be limited by the products my firm offered, or worse, the act of selling itself. As I embarked on starting my own firm, I had a crystal-clear vision in mind: no more sales pitches, no more commissions, and no more corporate jargon. I aimed to sit on the same side of the table as my clients, providing them with the fiduciary standard I'd want for my own grandmother.\n\nI was determined to end the era where my own cousins and fraternity brothers were deemed unfit clients simply because they didn't have a quarter of a million dollars to invest. I was weary of contributing to the cycle of the rich getting richer while others struggled to find their way.\n\nFor far too long, individuals who resemble me have been systematically denied access to the tools and resources necessary for building wealth. Although I believed I was fighting for the greater good, I realized I had unwittingly become part of the problem. So, now, I'm taking action to be the change I want to see.\n\nI invite you to join me on this transformative journey."
