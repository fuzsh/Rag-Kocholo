        "text": "The custom of wearing a ring on the third finger of the left hand dates back to ancient Egypt. The Egyptians believed that the vein in the ring finger, flowed straight to the heart. And through this vein sentiments of love and prosperity are carried.\n\nFiligrana is the Spanish word for this lace-like type of work, in English it’s Filigree.\n\nThe traditional Sardinian wedding ring is said to bring wealth and prosperity. The globules on the Sardinian wedding ring are inspired by corn ears and it’s typically flat, decorated with small drops. It’s an intricate work that dates back centuries. The ring is made from gold or silver; using fine wires or minute globules which are soldered together to form a lace-like pattern.\n\nI’ve befriended the local orafa or goldsmith a few months ago as I was in search of a new wedding ring. We spoke often throughout the weeks, planning my new filigrana Sarda. We went through many traditional ancient jewellery books looking for the one which resembled me best.\n\nThen I let the orafa work his magic in making my ring, for four long months.\n\nPatience is a virtue living on an island, and my bags are packed with it. I was in no hurry and I assured him to take his time. This was my birthday gift of last year from my husband, and I wanted it perfect.\n\nTo become a licensed Orafa (Goldsmith) in Italy, all projects must be 70% worked by hand and 30% with machines. His shop is filled with delicately made Sardinian artifacts and stunning pieces of extravagant jewellery.\n\nIn a land where everything happens domani, I was more than happy to have waited four months for my piece of perfection.\n\nComing to Sardinia and want to buy that special gift for a loved one? Look no further.\n\nValentino is a great, enthusiastic goldsmith, who can turn your dreams into a reality.\n\nARTE ORAFA\n\ndi Valentino Tansu\n\nCorso Vittorio Emanuele, 1\n\nTrinita D’Agultu (OT)\n\n07038\n\nHave you had any jewellery pieces made while on holiday?"
