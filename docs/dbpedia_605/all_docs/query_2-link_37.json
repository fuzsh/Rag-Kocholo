Hope you are doing very fine. I am quite aware that this letter of offer may astonish you as it comes from unfamiliar person. However it is all about going into joint business relationship with you. In brief, I am Mr Glenn Taylor, the Son of former Liberia leader Charles Taylor who has just been jailed by the International Court of Justice in Hague Netherlands on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. I am the fourth son and the first son from the second wife. My half-brothers being the elder sons and of course from the first wife have hijacked all our fathers properties and investment abandoning my siblings and I.\n\nThese guys are much older and have come of age during the reign of our father and eventually many properties were bought in their names, they knew our fathers secrets and right now enjoying all that belongs to all. Recently, I managed to visit our father in prison through his personal lawyer and had an opportunity to explain what was happening since his apprehension, for the first time I saw my father weeping.\n\nHe spoke to his lawyer and instructed him what to do, later, the lawyer handed me documents which he said contains deeds of lodgement with a Security Firm in Europe, He cautioned me not to waste the money or invest in England and urge me to find investment in South Africa, America, Canada, Australia or Asia for security reasons.\n\nI have through the lawyer visited the Security Firm with the documents and they confirmed everything on my favour and are ready to release upon my request. I have as well visited a few places on my father instructions, I decided to write and solicit for your assistance to help us invest this money in your country. The money in question is $31, 700, 000, 00 (Thirty One Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)\n\nI am ready now to conclude the logistics of getting the money out of the Security Firm in Europe. Please if you are interested in assisting me, contact me via details bellow, so that we can discuss the commission that will be suitable for you for your assistance and as well discuss on investment opportunities. Most importantly keep this transaction. very confidential, I am presently in South Africa now. Looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nYours Faithfully\n\nMr Glenn Taylor\n\nPrizemasters Lottery Scam\n\nView the full lottery scam (.PDF, 947KB)*\n\nA small section of the scam follows:\n\nDear ,\n\nHang on to your hat, because there's BIG news coming your way. It's the kind of news that many Prizemasters candidates simply dream about, thinking to themselves \"what if?\" and \"wouldn't it be nice?\", but never actually DOING anything about taking a BIG money chance when it comes their way. This kind of day will only ever be a faraway fantasy for those folk.\n\nHowever in your case, I can see from your record of play that you are a DOER in the true sense of the word. Sure you have your dreams, but the difference is you actually DO something about it, diligently assessing the big money opportunities and grabbing the for action moves from my hands to yours.

I have decided to reach you with the hope of building a relationship of trust, reliance and confidence which you will come to understand and appreciate in the near future. I am Mr. Don Tit Shing LIU (Deputy Chief Executive Officer) of Chong Hing Bank Ltd, Chong Hing Bank Centre, 24 Des Voeux Rd. Central, Hong Kong. Your contact details was taken from the New Zealand public record registry, in the quest for a last name similar to that of a late customer from my bank, Dr. Sudin , an oil Magnate that lived in Hong Kong for about twelve years. He passed on with his immediate family in the natural disaster (Hurricane Andrew) which occurred in August 1992, without appointing a next of kin to his estate.\n\nBefore the above mentioned ugly catastrophe that cause his death, a lump sum deposit of $65,611,281.00 (Sixty Five Million, Six Hundred and Eleven Thousand, Two Hundred and Eighty One USD) was placed under my bank's custody for safe keeping. On the condition that you bear the same last name with the deceased oil magnet, it has prompted me to present you as his next of kin to apply and claims the deposit he had with my bank, to avoid the confiscation of the said funds by the authorities and returned to the treasury of the bank of china as unclaimed proceeds of trade and deposit from late customers. Following the reasons that we operate in compliance with the Hong Kong laws, such proceeds is conferred to the government's treasury if all effort to find heirs, next of kin or members of the deceased's family proves abortive in all ways during the specified time period, required to find a beneficiary to claim the funds. However, this law is unjust and inhuman as it often creates avenues for the top officials of some financial institutions to divert such fortunes for their own selfish use. On that ground, I decided to search for any of my late client's relative which has proved abortive as he did not declare officially any Next of kin or beneficiary. However, this law is unjust and inhuman as it often creates avenues for the top officials of some financial institutions to divert such fortunes for their own selfish use.\n\nI am contacting you because you share the same last name with my late client; I know you are not related but after countless efforts to locate direct relative to the late client, due to the (6) six months final notice from the Bank to find a beneficiary to the fund, and failure to meet up with this deadline means the fund will be liquidated to the Bureau as unclaimed fund and that I forbid happening. Against this backdrop, I decided to contact you to join me to put claims on this deposit before it's forfeited to the authorities.\n\nMy suggestion to you is, I will like to present you as the Next of Kin and beneficiary to this deposit, since you are both foreign nationals and you share same last name by virtue of my position as the branch manager, I will now place your name as the Next of kin/Beneficiary to the late client and I will prepare the relevant legal documentations that will assist to facilitate the release of the fund to you without any breach of the law.\n\nNote that I have worked out all modalities to complete the transaction successfully, be rest assured that the transaction is 100% legal and risk free. Once the fund is released to you, we shall share in the ratio of 55% for me, 40% for you while remaining 5% will be set aside charitable works.

I am conscious that this is certainly not a predictable way of approach to foster a relationship of trust, but because of the circumstances and urgency surrounding this issue, I got to this point. Before the calamity; He deposited one Trunk Box of Personal Treasure, containing the sum of $9.5M (Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) to a Security and Financial Institution here in Spain and because of security and personal reasons, he did not disclose the exact content of the deposited box to the Security Firm.

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.\n\nLet me start by first introducing myself properly to you. It may surprise you receiving this letter from me, since there was no previous correspondence between us. My name is Barrister Arnold V. Pamplona, a personal Attorney to Late Eng. David . who died along side his immediate family in an air crash ;Spanair 5022 plane crash (http: //www. dailymail. co.uklnews/ article-2020703/Crew-blamed-Spanair-jet-crash-killed-154.html) which occurred on the 20th of August 2008 en route Madrid to Gran Canarias (Las Palmas), since then all my several enquiries here to locate any of my clients extended relatives, has proved unsuccessful.\n\nThus I decided to search with his name through the NEW ZEALAND public records; to locate any member of her extended family hence I saw your name. I know you may not be biologically related to him but since you both bear the same surname, I could fix it up.\n\nBefore his death, he deposited the Sum of US$6.4M (Six Million, Four Hundred Thousand US Dollars only) with a Bank here in Spain, The Bank has contacted me to present the next of kin for claims, and before the deposit gets confiscated or is reverted to the Spanish government established Bureau for Unclaimed Deposits (BUD)\n\nSo I decided to search for any of my late client's relative which has been very difficult for me, as he did not declare any other person, address, partner or relatives in the official paper works of his deposit.\n\nGiven this situation, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to my late client Eng. David , since you share the same last name so that the deposited fund will be released to you. With my position as his lawyer, I will now place your name as the next of kin to my late client. I will prepare every relevant document that will assist us, and facilitate the release of the fund to you.\n\nAll I require of you is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

Central Hong Kong\n\nFrom Mr. Yiu Lung Cheng\n\nTel: +852-8170-0471\n\nFax: +852-3017-7507\n\nEmail: ylcheng @ asia.com\n\n26th February, 2014\n\nAccept my sincere apology for this unsolicited letter to you, I am aware that this is certainly not a conventional way of approach to establish a relationship of trust but you will realize the need for my action. I have used the opportunity of a friend coming to England to send this letter to you for security reasons as I wanted to be sure my letter was not intercepted here in Hong Kong. My names are Mr. Yiu Lung Cheng, Chief Operating Officer of Wing Lung Bank Ltd, 45 Des Voeux Road Central Hong Kong. I got your contact information's through the New Zealand public records while searching for a last name similar to a late customer's. I am writing you regarding a deceased client of my bank, Engr. Rudd , an Oil Magnate who lived in Hong Kong for twenty-eight years; he died along with his immediate family during the Tsunami catastrophe which occurred December 2004.\n\nBefore his demise, he deposited the sum of ($28,980,369.00 (Twenty Eighteen Million, Nine Hundred and Eighty Thousand, Three Hundred and Sixty Nine USD) placed under our Bank Management. The institution being aware of his death have mandated me to present a member of his family (heir/inheritor)or Next of kin to make Claims of his funds with out bank otherwise, it will be forfeited, seized or confiscated by the authorities and reverts to the treasury of the Bank of China as unclaimed. Due to the fact that we operate in accordance with the Hong Kong law, such fortune is automatically bequeathed to the government if there is no heir or Next of kin to the deceased that would surface to claim the fortune within the specified time. However, this law is unjust and inhuman as it often creates an avenue for the top officials of some financial institutions to divert such fortunes for their own selfish use. On that ground, I decided to search for any of my late client's relative which has proved abortive as he did not declare officially any Next of kin or beneficiary.\n\nI am contacting you because you share the same last name with my late client; I know you might not be related but after countless efforts to locate direct relative to the late client and a (3) Three months final notice from the Bank to present a beneficiary to the fund, and failure to meet up with this deadline means the fund will be liquidated to the Bureau as unclaimed fund and that I forbid happening. Against this backdrop. I decided to contact you to join me to put claims on this deposit before it's forfeited to the authorities.\n\nMy suggestion to you is. I will like to present you as the Next of Kin and beneficiary to this deposit, since you are both foreign nationals and you share same last name by virtue of my position as the branch manager, I will now place your name as the Next of kin/Beneficiary to the late client and I will prepare the relevant legal documentations that will assist to facilitate the release of the fund to you without any breach of the law.\n\nNote that I have worked out all modalities to complete the transaction successfully, be rest assured that the transaction is 100% legal and risk free. Once the fund is released to you, we shall share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you while remaining 5% will be set aside for any expenses incurred during the cause of securing this deposit. If my proposal is acceptable to you, kindly reply via any of my emails, ylcheng @ asia.com. yCcheng @ accountant.com. or can be reached at all times on my direct telephone number Tel: +85281700471.\n\nRegards Sincerely,\n\nMr. Y L Cheng\n\nBlake Bawa inheritance scam\n\nView original letter (PDF, 73KB)*\n\nAttn:\n\nThis is a personal letter directed to you and I request that it should be treated as such. I am Blake Bawa, a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney/sole executor to the late Mr. Peter , who died in a car crash with his immediate family on the 5th of Nov 2002. Since the death of my client in Nov. 2002. I have written several letters to the embassy with an intent to locate any of his extended relatives whom shall be claimants / beneficiaries of his abandoned personal estate and all such efforts have heen to no avail. More so, I have received official letters in the last few weeks suggesting a likely proceeding for confiscation of his abandoned personal assets in line with existing laws by the bank in which my client deposited the sum of 9.8m GBP. The board of directors of the company now adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money within the next 25 official working days or forfeit the money as an abandoned fund. The company had planned to invoke the abandoned property decree of 1996 to confiscate the funds after the expiration of the period given to me but after an investigation in the finance company. I found out that some members of the company wants to divert this fund into their private accounts for their own selfish interest and only want to use the excuse of my inability to look for a relative to achieve their goal.\n\nBy virtue of my closeness to the deceased and his immediate family. I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and had thought it unprofitable for his funds to be submitted to the government of this country and the finance company where it is lodged. I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be kgally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client, which is legally possible and would be done in accordance with the laws of the land. On this note I decided to search for a credible person and finding that you bear the same last name. I was urged to contact you to crave your participation and co-operation. that I may, with your consent, present you to Ihe \"trustee\" bank as my late client's surviving family member so as to enable you put up a claim at the bank in that capacity us a next of kin of my client, so that the proceeds of this Bank Account valued at Nine Million Eight Hundred Thousand British Pounds Stirling only (9.8million) can be paid to you, before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable to the bank where this huge deposit is lodged. Therefore, to facilitate the immediate reprofiling of this fund. you need first to contact me in UK via my email address blakebawa @ live.com and contact telephone number +442070604258, Fax: + 44 207060 4259 signifying your interest and as soon as I obtain your confidence, I will intimate you with the complete detaiIs with directions on how to put up an application to the bank.\n\nHowever, you will have to assent to an express agreement. which I will forward to you in order to bind us in this transaction. Upon the receipt of your reply. I will send you by fax or E-mail the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this proposal is 100% risk and hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fears as the required arrangements have been made for the completion of this transfer since I have all vital documents that would be requested by them and that would confer you the legal right to make this claim. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. If this proposal is acceptable by you, get in touch with me through my email address and contact numbers above for better confidentiality and send to me your contact details to enable us discuss further about this transaction and hope you do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you as I require only a solemn confidentiality on this and hope you do understand what confidentiality really means.

Actually, I got your contact information through the New Zealand public records while searching for a last name similar to my late client's a business magnate by name Edwin who lived in Spain with his family for about Thirteen years before their accidental death, during the Cyclone Nargis Disaster which occurred in May 2008. However the circumstances and urgency of this claim have prone me to send you this unsolicited mail, which I humbly apologize.\n\nBefore the catastrophe; He deposited One Trunk Box/Diplomatic Personal Treasure, containing the sum of $5.8M (five MILLLION, EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS) with a Safe Security Company here in Spain, Because of security and personal reasons he did not disclose the exact content of deposited diplomatic box to the treasure house. As the attorney my late client, the security company has mandated me to present a member of his family (heir/inheritor) to make claims or the vault will be confiscated and taken to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security as unclaimed. After abortive efforts searching for a direct family member which came to no avail, I was given an ultimatum to look for some relative to put up a claim or have the Vault liquidated and made unserviceable in accordance with existing vault/security laws.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, I do suggest you stand as the next of kin. I know you may not be anyway related to my late client but having a common surname with him and the modalities I have in place, I can guarantee that if you follow my instructions (The rule of laws) the vault will be released to us.\n\nMind you, this transaction is 100% risk free; there is no atom of risk connected to this business as I have worked out all the modalities to complete the operation effectively. Once the Vault is released to you, we shall divide the content in the ration of 50% for you, 50% for me as our benefit. ($2.9 Million each)\n\nKindly indicate your response to this letter via my private email address below; you can also call or send me a fax for further clarification. Please be kind to get back to me if you are not willing to collaborate with me so that I can further my search for another partner.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nMilan San Bravo\n\nPrivate E-mail: milasabravo @ gmail.com\n\nPrize Award Commission scam\n\nView full postal scam (PDF, 591KB)*\n\nPRIZE AWARD COMMISSION\n\nMrs ,\n\nA \"savings assistance\" has been attributed to you.\n\nIn addition, during the first part of determination of the benefit, you can also now claim a total sum of $29.500.00 (or one cheque for $2,950.00 every month for 10 months).\n\nPLEASE FILL OUT ALL THE REQUIRED FORMS AND RETURN EVERYTHING AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.\n\nMrs ,\n\nPlease pay very careful attention to the content of these documents because they will not be sent a second time!\n\nIn cooperation with several financial institutions, we organise special actions to remit cheques and other benefits to certain selected people.\n\nFollowing the request of a third party, you have been declared the recipient of one of these benefits. It is a substantial allocation because it involves not less than the sum of $29,500.00 that will be paid to the declared recipient. MRS , as one monthly cheque of $2,950.00 for 10 months (10 cheques).\n\nYou should also know that, as recipient of a \"Savings Assistance Benefit\", (i) your \"cheque No.1\" can be sent rapidly, and (ii) that your claim for the Benefit of $29,500.00 must be made within 8 days. I will return to these two points below.\n\nMrs this is not a bad joke or a scam: your dossier has really been registered in our offices! I will also explain why you are the recipient of a benefit and where the $29,500.00 (10 cheques) come from.\n\nThe commission enjoys relations with influential people who are among the richest in the world. One of these people, \"Magister Davids\" (I am forbidden from revealing his true name) recently contacted us about you.\n\nMagister Davids seems to know you ... he knows things about you!\n\nHe requested that you receive special assistance. Since he is our largest shareholder, we immediately started a procedure to grant you a \"Savings Assistance Benefit\". You have nothing special to do except follow our instructions because the result is conclusive: Your \"Savings Assistance Benefit\" has been accepted. Cheque No.1 worth $2,950.00 is ready to be sent.\n\nAll I ask is that you fill out the enclosed documents in order to close out your dossier and rapidly send you cheque No.1.\n\nBut that's not all! Magister Davids is one of only four people in the world to have access to \"certain\" numerical data. These people possess the sum total of all knowledge of money markets and have the power to act on them. For example, each of these people can know the winning lottery numbers of their country in advance! I know this is hard to believe. yet there are ironclad proofs to back it up ... it is the unvarnished truth (and is well known in closed circles of \"initiates\"). They sometimes provide winning numbers just to prove they can do it. It is a \"game\" for them.\n\nTo illustrate: in the United Stated, the winning numbers were given to 100 people and there were 100 winners (no one understands how this was possible). In Germany very recently, a lottery ticket that won 2.5 million euros was not redeemed. Magister Davids was behind all that. He did this simply to prove that he could win any time he wanted to! He did not turn in his winning ticket because he has no need of money: he is a multibillionaire!\n\nThis letter is for you, really you,in which Magister Davids proposes to win the next jackpot!\n\nAt least $500,000.00 in your bank account from the winning lottery combination!\n\nDo not ask me why he is doing this, I have no idea, If you ever meet him in person, you can ask him face to face. All I know is that his method really works!\n\nMagister Davids only wants other people to be happy. The benefit of $29,500.00 destined for you is from a special fund he made available to us.\n\nYou must not miss out on this incredible chance to change your life! He is proposing this chance to be sheltered from need only once!\n\nI have enclosed a confidential form that you must fill out and that we will forward to him directly. Your form contains the code MXGAGNMILLIONS.\n\nIt probably goes without saying that this information, as well as the benefit you will receive is highly confidential. You must at all costs avoid speaking about it, otherwise you will attract jealousy and envy!\n\nPlease respond as rapidly as possible. I have just spoken to Magister Davids on the telephone and he said he must have your response very rapidly because the next jackpot draw is imminent!\n\nRoger Malcom, Prize Award Director\n\nFinkelstein & Partner prize scam\n\nView full postal scam (PDF, 492KB)*\n\nMrs .\n\nWe have $ 30,000.00 to be remitted!\n\nNumber of remittance for your prize: 344.001.250\n\nAllocation approved:OK\n\nDear Mrs ,\n\nI'm writing to you today because I would like to ask you urgently to request the prize you have already won. You don't have to go anywhere because we will send the prize to which you have a right for today directly to the following address: (removed) as soon as your reply in due form has been received.\n\nTo ask for your prize, you must urgently return to us your $ 30.000.00 Prize Authorization as well as your Personal Declaration. It is obvious that all the documents must be completed in due form.\n\nIf I don't receive your reply, I can't do anything for you,Mrs !\n\nI would highly recommend you to ask for your Certificate of Guaranteed Fortune. It's a certificate of a defined bonus with which you'll receive within 8 weeks again the same sum as the prize!\n\nProfit from this opportunity before it's too Iate because the $ 30,000.00 must absolutely be remitted!\n\nYou only need to reply to receive what is already yours. It would thus be really unforgiveable not to take a few minutes to do this ... But I'm quite sure Mrs that you'll do the necessary and that you will ask for your prize today.\n\nI'll be happy to receive your reply!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIsaac Finkelstein, Manager\n\nP.s. If you don't want to ask for your prize, for whatever reason (you never know!), I would ask you to send us a little note.\n\nStiller & Manson inheritance scam\n\nView the full postal scam (PDF, 445KB)*\n\nStiller & Manson\n\nTrust company tasked with the payment of inheritances and dividends\n\n14.01.2014\n\nSubject: Your inheritance of $ 50,478.41\n\nDear Mrs ,\n\nToday we have important news for you that will change your life. For 30 years, Stiller & Manson has been the trusted partner of its clients for the execution and payment of inheritances, dividends or varied financial transactions of substantial value. We are completely bound by strict directives concerning intercontinental financial transactions. Our work is thus verified and guaranteed to the fullest extent possible and nothing is left to chance.\n\nOur clients are transnational corporations and rich \"aristocrats\"-throughout Europe who task us with the the payment of their dividends, but also the liquidation of their assets and the accomplishment of their last wishes, in other words executing their last will and testa-ment. The latter reason is why I am contacting you today, Mrs . You are one of the beneficiaries of the inheritance of several million dollars from one of our clients!\n\nThe departed benefactor who wished to remain anonymous made his fortune in the IT field, primarily hardware and software. Deep down, he loved to tinker with computers. He took this passion to the grave, as I will explain below. Since our client had no next of kin but was a social activist, in his twilight years he wanted to create a computer programme using a complex process and taking a number of social criteria into account in order to select a number of people throughout the world with whom his fantastic fortune would be shared.\n\nHis purpose was to give a financial \"shot in the arm\" to people who have endured life's hardships and thereby donating a bit of happiness he enjoyed in his life.\n\nHere it is again in black and white since there is no doubt: you are one of these people selected, Mrs . Absolutely! You are one of the heirs that our client's computer programme named as beneficiary!\n\nBelieve it or not. Mrs . the share of the inheritance destined for you is nothing less than $ 50,478.41!\n\nFirst off, congratulations Mrs ! I hope you realise what this unexpected financial windfall could mean. The money is ready to be paid. Nevertheless, you can undoubtedly understand that as sworn executors of estates, vye must conclude several formalities before transferring the inheritance of $ 50,478.41 to you.\n\nWe have prepared everything for you on the enclosed form 3.43a \"Declaration of acceptance of inheritances and donations\". Please fill out this form completely and do not forget to sign it. Without your signature, we unfortunately cannot pay your share of the inheritance.\n\nI have enclosed an excerpt from our client's testament (this was his wish). You can read exactly what drove him to distribute his inheritance in such an unusual way. After reception and conclusive verification of your documents, we will order the immediate payment of your share of the inheritance. Please indicate how you would like to receive this payment (bank transfer, cheque or cash) in the enclosed form 3.43a.\n\nPlease return the documents before the deadline of 10 days so that we can rapidly take all steps required for payment.\n\nWhile awaiting your response,\n\nSincerely,\n\nHenry Manson\n\nPartner, Stiller & Manson\n\nAngelique Guardian Angel, clairvoyant\n\nView the full postal scam (PDF, 577KB)*\n\nBravo and congratulations for the cheque you have won! Please read further...\n\nYour \"Sacred Guardian Angel\", who will soon take you under his \"protective wings\" has again spoken. But BEFORE giving you the exact date, I have something\n\nvery important to tell you!\n\nAn extraordinary event happened after his last visit...\n\nYour guardian angel drew your face on the wall with red chalk and I knew then and there that I had to write to you immediately. I must get ready to carry out your 3 very important Actions IMMEDIATELY and absolutely FREE OF CHARGE!\n\nThis document is from your Guardian angel, drawn on the wall opposite my desk that I always look at. I see it constantly and it has penetrated deeply in me like it was seeking protection in me. I have to say honestly that I have not had this kind of feeling for another person for many years. Maybe you do not know, but most of the objects that surround us say many things about the present, the past, feelings and even the people who live with them. It's something like a \"Psychic Fingerprint\" that explains the past life and reveals the future. A clairvoyant like myself can sometimes read these signs, feel them, decode them and understand them.\n\nI saw your face and I sensed the Celestial Order from the Beyond: I had to write to you immediately to tell you what I saw. Many things made me happy, but some also troubled me ... I saw your Psychic Fingerprint in your image, so many important things that I immediately cancelled all my appointments so I could write to you today.\n\nI very clearly felt that the life you will lead very soon will have nothing to do with the one that is now bearing so heavily on you...\n\nAngele and Angelina, clairvoyants\n\nView the full postal scam (PDF, 511KB)*\n\n2 days ago, late at night ... A person you know very, well revealed a (incredible) secret ABOUT YOU, that could change your life! This is as sure as the sun rises every morning!\n\n\"I was almost sure \", was the whisper we heard. \"This person will win a lot of money at games of chance during this period. Something like this has not happened until today! With the best intentions, I cannot understand why ... \"\n\nThis is from a conversation we had yesterday evening with an astrologer friend and this conversation was about you, Mrs. (name removed)!\n\nShe was in our office and we were having a friendly relaxed discussion. We looked at our friend and asked,filled with hope: \"Why are you so sure that this person is not already rich?\" She answered with a note of deception in her voice: \"We have already communicated but today I have heard nothing. If you had won a large amount of money 1 would have been told about it and I would now be reassured\".\n\nWhile she was speaking, she removed a thick folder with sheets of paper contailling symbols, notes, images and numbers ... We looked at the notes and realised that they were items our friend used to write to YOU.\n\nAngele and I were unable to discern any major anomaly, just a few shadowy zones we attributed to the technical limits of modern astrology.\n\nShe continued: \"You know that being \"almost\" right is of little use to me. Could you help me? I want so much to help this deserving person who merits being loved. You have worked for years on a method that allows your astrological predictions to be detailed and refined. \"\n\nShe continued: \"I suppose that only celebrities and VIPs ask for your help. \" We answered: \"You should know that we have helped many people without money who really need our help, without regard for their social and financial situation ... \"\n\nThen she took out five sheets of paper covered with notes and calculations that concerned YOU, and said: \"Please read this and tell me what you think. \"We gladly gave our opinion because it concerned you, .\n\nAfter she left and I was alone with Angele, we started working right away even though it was already 11 pm. We made an incredible discovery: we were totally stupefied by the sudden planetary alignment in your astral sky and by the intense vibrations we felt. We now know why our astrologer friend spoke of your case with such urgency.\n\nYes, Mrs. , we realised that you are on the threshold of an extraordinary period of your existence!\n\nIt will LAST FOR 60 DAYS and starts next Saturday!\n\nIn no case must you miss out on this opportunity.

Man was created to be happy and satisfied, and to live in harmony with nature. This is why we decided TO HELP YOU! We are genuinely outraged that principles as simple as these are not universally accessible.\n\nYOU COULD PROFIT FROM THIS VERY FAVOURABLE PERIOD OF 60 DAYS, ESPECIALLY FOR WINNING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY!\n\nWe would like to start with this. Afterwards, if you grant us your confidence, we will tell you in detail what could be in store for you.\n\nWe verified, extended and further defined the classical astrological predictions our friend made about your future. We did this by using a method that has proven its absolute infallibility for years: THE EXACT POSITION OF THE MOON ON THE DAY OF YOUR BIRTH!\n\nUsing this method provided a precise representation from your unconscious and what we call the \"symboLic of the unconscious\" .\n\nHERE IS HOW WE WILL PROCEED!\n\nWe have enclosed a document with this letter confirming that you can win $ 29,400.00 if you return your \"ACCEPTANCE FORM FOR PAYMENT OF $ 29,400.00\" before the deadline, and your> > SPECIAL MILLIONAIRE COUPON No. 173 791 Â«.
