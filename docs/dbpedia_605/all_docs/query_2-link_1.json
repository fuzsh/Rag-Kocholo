        "text": "2011 graduate has advanced to Challenger semifinals after knocking off former No. 8 player in the world\n\nOSTRAVA, Czech Republic â€“ Former Wisconsin men's player Marek Michalicka (Class of 2011) is in the midst of a very successful professional career and added a big win to his resume this week.\n\nPlaying in the Prosperita Open as part of the ATP Challenger Tour, Michalicka rallied back to knock off the former No. 8 player in the world, Janko Tipsarevic, 3-6, 7-6 (1), 6-4.\n\nA native of Serbia, Tipsarevic has won four ATP World Tour titles and nine tournaments in the ATP Challenger Series, but couldn't get past Michalicka in the second round in Ostrava, Czech Republic.\n\nMichalicka, who is ranked No. 304 in the world ATP (career high of No. 239), took down Maxime Chazal, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, in the opening round before defeating Tipsarevic. Michalicka also toppled No. 140 Laslo Djere, 7-5, 6-2, in the quarterfinals on Friday. Up next is a semifinal match against Czech Republic native Zdenek Kolar.\n\nA three-time All-Big Ten honoree and the conference's freshman of the year in 2008, Marek Michalicka posted a 97-35 career singles record at Wisconsin and finished his career with the second-highest winning percentage in UW men's tennis history (.735). As a junior, the Ricany, Czech Republic native posted a team-best 21-6 singles record and competed in the NCAA team, singles and doubles championships, becoming the first Badger since 1991 and the third all-time to advance past the first round of the singles championship. Michalicka earned three straight NCAA tournament singles berths, becoming just the third Badger to appear in three national championships."
