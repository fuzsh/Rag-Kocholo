        "text": "Highest Rated: 97% Blood Relatives (2022)\n\nLowest Rated: 8% Sex and Breakfast (2007)\n\nBirthday: Aug 19, 1975\n\nBirthplace: Baltimore, Maryland, USA\n\nClassically trained actress Tracie Thoms appeared in several regional and off-Broadway shows, but was probably best known for her work in film and television. A veteran of such stage productions as \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" \"The Oedipus Plays\" and \"Up Against the Wind,\" Thoms made her Broadway debut in 2004 opposite Alfre Woodard in \"Drowning Crow.\" Her most notable role, however, was that of Joanne Jefferson in \"Rent\" (2005) - the filmic adaptation of the award-winning Broadway musical by Jonathan Larson. Along with her stage and movie credits, Thoms also maintained a high visibility on the small screen. Following appearances as a semi-regular on CBS's hit crime drama procedural, \"Cold Case\" (CBS, 2003-10) in 2005, the talented actress joined the cast as regular during the 2006-07 season. But it was on the big screen in Quentin Tarantino's ode to B-movie horror films, \"Death Proof\" - part of the double bill, \"Grindhouse\" (2007) - that Thoms more than just stood out - she practically stole the show as the foul-mouthed stunt driver, Kim.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n97% Blood Relatives 93% Straight Up\n\n93% Looper\n\n84% Grindhouse\n\n82% I Will Follow\n\n75% The Devil Wears Prada\n\n65% Peter and Vandy\n\n64% Grindhouse Presents: Death Proof\n\nPhotos\n\nTracie Thoms Tracie Thoms at arrivals for UNFORGETTABLE Premiere, TCL Chinese Theatre, Los Angeles, CA April 18, 2017.
