        "text": "Anti Scrunti Faction were a queercore punk trio from Boulder, Colorado. 😄\n\nIt is amazing to think back and realize how regular mail correspondence through the US Postal service was the spine of the Punk Rock movement. I can say I was a punk rock correspondent entrepreneur. This is how I met Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas of A.S.F. During the punk scene of the 1980s, tapes and correspondence were part of our lives and I was taken by the gals of A.S.F., mostly because women were not a big staple of the scene we had grown to know. I made it happen and we put out their record. Women, punk rock, politics, sexuality, racism, and abounding creativity is the loud heartfelt sarcasm that emanates from this band. I remember making vegetarian spaghetti in our kitchen with Leslie. Taking Leslie and Tracie to the beach was a real treat. I got my first tattoos with the A.S.F. girls. A contrary experience for me because at the same time we were working with the bands Doggy Style and Detox. Some of my best memories of co-running a fanzine. Leslie Mah and Tracie Thomas went on to have an interesting life creatively and I am happy for them. Look them up you may be surprised.\n\nOne can listen here…\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Anti-Scrunti-Faction-Damsels-In-Distress/release/2004128\n\n(From the original Flipside CATALOG)\n\nThis is the debut LP by Boulder Colorado A.S.F.~Anti Scrunti Faction, a joint release by Flipside and Unclean Records. “Damsels in Distress” features the very colorful artwork of Leslie Mah, the band’s bass player and singer. Inside you’ll find 18 thought provoking tunes, a lot of which deal with a woman’s view of the punk rock scene as well as the world. – and it is no wonder -two women in this band. This critically acclaimed punk classic features these songs: “Boys will be Boys.” “Sugar and Spice,” Writhe like Worms,” “Big Dick,” Resist The lies,” “Marshall Law,” “War, War, War,” “One Crashed over The Cuckoo’s Nest,” “Brain Transplant,” “Ohpmyn,” “3005 E. Euclid,” “Suicide Note,” “Another Love Song,” “Silent Death,” “In My Heart,” “Innocent Victim,” “Johnny,” and ” Slave to My Estrogen ,” A.S.F. and their song, “Slave to My Estrogen,” is featured in Flipside Video 11.\n\nA note….\n\nMIA is a Flipside Records Band too! After the Fact (LP, 1987, Flipside Records) and Flipside Vinyl Fanzine Vol. 2 (1985) includes “Just A Dream” 😸\n\nOriginally out on Flipside Records…."
