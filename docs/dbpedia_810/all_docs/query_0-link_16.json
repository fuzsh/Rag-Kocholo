This is fuelled by the partly hidden erotic connections between the two.\n\nThe queer-feminist punk classic with its grainy Super 8 aesthetics features artists from various (proto-)Riot Grrrl and queercore bands, including Anti-Scrunti Faction, Team Dresch and G. B. Jones’ own band, Fifth Column.\n\nG. B. Jones\n\nCanadian G. B. Jones is a film-maker, musician, artist, and producer of several zines. A trademark of her no-budget films is the collaboration with artists, musicians and cultural producers with whom she has links via the networks of queer and feminist underground cultures – cultures that she herself has likewise greatly influenced through her own work and her aesthetics. Jones works primarily with Super 8 and analogue video.\n\nFilms by G. B. Jones\n\nThe Dark End of the Street 2017 | The Lollipop Generation 2008 | The Troublemakers 1990"
