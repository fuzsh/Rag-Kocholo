        "text": "All This and Rock and Roll?…..\n\nWhat I know about the Colorado Punk scene could fill a thimble and so for this Post I rely on Bob Rob Medina’s book “Denvoid and The Cowtown Punks – A Collection of Strories from the 80’s Denver Punk Scene”. Get his book for the background stories behind these bands. Quote marks denote punk names. Some of these may be considered “New Wave”, “Hardcore” or “Gothic” – who knows? – To learn everything about the Colorado Punk scene go get a copy of Bob Rob Medina’s “Denvoid and the Cowtown Punks” published in 2015.\n\nWhat is really a treat (for me) in “Denvoid” are the many references and interviews relating to Wax Trax Records which sort of served a “ground zero” for the Punk crowd in Denver. There is a great interview with store co-owner Duane and quotes from his partner Dave Stidman. The fellow-traveler with Wax Trax back in the early days of Denver Punk was the nearby Mercury Café owned by Marilyn Megenity. The “venue” became a base of operations for the Punk artists and their followers, and in co-op with Wax Trax promoted Punk happenings.\n\nThe Café migrated over the years from location-to-location (often not by choice) but thrives today in it’s “LoDo” location at 2199 California Street.\n\nPunk – Hard Core or…..\n\n“Punk” popped up in the U.S. in 1974 or so according to WikipediaNew Wave is defined as emerging in the mid 1970’s and running through the mid 1980’s. But of course it had a much earlier foundation via garage bands. But it is comfortable to say that the with the arrival of the Ramones out of Queens in New York that Punk had arrived. “Hardcore” or “Hardcore Punk” is also attributed to a form overlapping with both early “Punk” and “New Wave”. The difference – What does it really matter?\n\nNow to mix things up even more, “Gothic Rock” or “Goth Rock” is attributed as a “Post Punk” genre, but is also documented as emerging in the late 1970’s. To top it all off – “Industrial Rock” popped up in the mid 1980’s but is not to be confused with “Industrial Metal”. And what about “Heavy Metal” and it’s predecessor “Death Metal”?\n\nThat’s enough of that…. So forgive and forget if some of these groups precede, transcend or supersede “Punk”.\n\nDenvoid and the Cowtown Punks by “Rob Bob Medina”\n\nClick on the image below to visit the “Denvoid” web site
