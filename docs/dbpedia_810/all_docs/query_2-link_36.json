As we mentioned in this week's music feature on Phoenix trio The Cosmeticators, the band has songs...",

        "text": "Chela: \"We'll do anything you tell us to.\"\n\nMoreno: \"If you're a robot.\"\n\nChela: \"And have money\"\n\nMoreno (after turning around to take a drink of water): \"We're not supposed to turn our backs on the audience. Sorry about that.\"\n\nChela: \"I don't care. They like looking at backsides.\"\n\nThe trio played fast and hard, but tight. They've added some new vocal harmonies to older songs like \"Apple,\" and despite the tendency to sound monotone, the \"60s girl-group harmony\" idea comes across, and works well against the band's backdrops of raging, Ramones-ish four chords. There's not a lot of showing off from the players, but Moreno did crank out a pretty cool solo during their cover of The Mighty Caesars' \"You Make Me Die.\"\n\nAfter rocking through original tunes like \"Vanna\" (an ode to Vanna White), \"Jerry\" (the aforementioned love song to Chela's dog), and \"Brand New Man\" (where Chela sings about finding a man who \"likes the dog\" and \"has a job\"), the band closed their set with a cover of The Pleasure Seekers' \"What a Way to Die.\"\n\nThe Vignettes (from Memphis, Tennessee) played next and were the last band we saw, and we were damn glad we stayed. These two gals (Francis Vignette on vocals/guitar and Freddi Vignette on drums) cranked out a super short but wildly loud and rocking set. Their songs sounded like gritty, swampy blues punk, topped with Francis' hair-raising screams and soulful wails -- somewhere between Gossip and early 80s punks Anti-Scrunti Faction. Watching Francis stomp around in cut-off jean shorts, playing her guitar behind her head and screaming \"Do you know how I rock and roll?\" while Frankie banged away diligently on the drums, rarely looking away and steady on her one cymbal, was invigorating. And as previously mentioned, a couple of their songs were about cats.\n\nThe Cosmeticators set list:\n\nLovebomb\n\nHeavy Metal\n\nInsomniac\n\nApple\n\nVanna\n\nBotox\n\nJerry\n\nDouble Man\n\nMake Me Die\n\nRoboman\n\nCosmeticators\n\nBrand New Man\n\nWhat a Way to Die\n\nCritic's Notebook:\n\nLast night: The Cosmeticators at The Trunk Space\n\nThe crowd: Mostly friends of the bands or other downtown musicians, a mix of thirtysomething females in casual attire and a gamut of guys in T-shirts (and one in a long-sleeved plaid shirt).\n\nPersonal bias: One of my favorite downtown drinking holes, The Bikini Lounge, is next to The Trunk Space, so beers between sets are totally possible.\n\nOverheard: \"It's so dry here. How do you stand it?\" (Francis Vignette to the crowd)"
