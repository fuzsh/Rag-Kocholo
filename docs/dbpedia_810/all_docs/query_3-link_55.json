        "text": "Tracie Mattivi Thomas hails from Prairie Village, Kansas, but her friends say that she‚Äôs a displaced southerner since the beaches and Lowcountry of Charleston, South Carolina, are her favorite places in the world. She grew up in Overland Park, Kansas, and has a Bachelor of General Science in Political Science and Business from the University of Kansas, Lawrence, and a Master of Business Administration from the Bloch School of Management at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. Tracie‚Äôs 30-year career working in public, private, and nonprofit organizations has taken her across the country to Washington, D.C., Cleveland, Ohio, and Madison, Wisconsin. Tracie is a business leader with expertise and passion for developing structure, creating strategic and tactical initiatives, and leading people and projects.\n\nQ&A\n\nWhat‚Äôs most inspiring about your specific position at TLI?\n\nI have the opportunity to work and collaborate with a dedicated group of professionals and to participate in building a global movement for perennial agriculture. My role allows me to participate in every part of this organization, from greenhouse to finance to the farms/fields.\n\nWhat drew you to work at TLI?\n\nClimate change and the prospect of changing the agriculture paradigm drew me to the work of The Land Institute.\n\nWhat‚Äôs one aspect of your life history that most people don‚Äôt know or wouldn‚Äôt expect?\n\nI backpacked through Europe for three months by myself. I learned a great deal about the world, had the opportunity to meet some very interesting people along the way and to visit parts of Europe that I had dreamed of visiting. I look back at that experience and realize that I learned important lessons resilience, patience, and being open to new points of views.\n\nWhat else are you passionate about (outside of work)?\n\nMy family and dogs. I love to garden, cook, and spend time outside. I love to read, especially cookbooks and mysteries!\n\nIf you were to write a book, what would it be about?\n\nIt would be a mystery about a dog, a chef, and a murder!\n\nWhat‚Äôs your motto / favorite quote?\n\n‚ÄúFind things that make your eyes light up. Do more of those.‚Äù\n\nWhat were you like at age 10?\n\nBusy playing sports, chatty to anyone who would listen, and full of laughter üòä\n\nSupport the work of Tracie and others at The Land Institute with a donation."
