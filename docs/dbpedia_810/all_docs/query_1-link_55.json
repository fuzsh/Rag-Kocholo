The PGC is billed to our customers without any mark-up and reflects approximately 2/3 of a customer’s bill.\n\nMeasurements: Natural gas is measured by “cf.” One cf equals 100 cubic feet or 1 unit.\n\nLearn More…\n\nTips on how to conserve energy to help reduce your bill.\n\nWater Customer Charge: Includes the cost of infrastructure to provide service to your address and the operating costs associated with providing that service.

Paga los costos que no varían con el uso, como la lectura/mantenimiento del medidor, los costos de facturación, el servicio al cliente, el equipo que brinda servicio a la propiedad del cliente, así como una parte del sistema de cables, postes y tuberías.\n\nCargo de Distribución\n\nEl cargo de Distribución es un costo fijo por kilovatio hora que soporta el costo de construcción, operación, mantenimiento y administración del sistema eléctrico. Este cargo no incluye el costo de la electricidad que utilizó.\n\nCarga de Energía\n\nEl cargo de energía incluye el costo de la energía que usó y Easton Utilities compró en su nombre. Como empresa de servicios públicos sin fines de lucro, Easton Utilities compra la energía que los clientes necesitan y transfiere el costo sin recargo.\n\nImpuestos y Recargos\n\nEl estado de Maryland requiere que cobremos ciertos impuestos y recargos que luego se envían directamente al estado.\n\nEsforzándose por Ahorrarle Dinero\n\nEaston Utilities compra energía eléctrica en el mercado mayorista. Las compras pueden ser contratos largo o corto plazo o precios de mercado y en “tiempo real” diarios. Para ayudar a mantener los costos bajos, podemos utilizar nuestra propia instalación de generación eléctrica. Esto significa que si los precios en el mercado se vuelven demasiado altos, podemos hacer funcionar nuestros propios generadores a un costo menor y pasar esos ahorros directamente a usted.\n\nAprende más…\n\nConsejos sobre cómo conservar energía para ayudar a reducir su factura.\n\nElectric Charges\n\nA residential electric bill is made up of four main charges: Customer Charge, Distribution Charges, Energy Charges and Taxes and Surcharges.\n\nCustomer Charge\n\nThis amount is a fixed charge per meter. It pays for costs that do not vary with usage, such as meter reading/maintenance, billing costs, customer service, the equipment providing service into the customer’s property, as well as a portion of the system of wires, poles and pipes.\n\nDistribution Charge\n\nThe Distribution charge is a set cost per kilowatt hour that supports the cost of construction, operation, maintenance and administration of the electric system. This charge does not include the cost of electricity that you used.\n\nEnergy Charge\n\nThe Energy Charge includes the cost of energy that you used and Easton Utilities purchased on your behalf. As a not-for-profit utility, Easton Utilities purchases the energy that customers need and passes the cost along without markup.\n\nTaxes and Surcharges\n\nThe State of Maryland requires that we collect certain taxes and surcharges that are then sent directly to the State.\n\nStriving to Save You Money\n\nEaston Utilities buys electric energy on the wholesale market. Purchases could be long or short-term contracts or daily “real time” and market prices. To help keep costs low, we can utilize our own electric generation facility. This means if prices on the market become too high, we can run our own generators at a lesser cost and pass those savings directly to you.\n\nLearn More…\n\nTips on how to conserve energy to help reduce your bill."
