        "text": "Words Related to riot%20grrrl\n\nAs you've probably noticed, words related to \"riot%20grrrl\" are listed above. Hopefully the generated list of term related words above suit your needs.\n\nP.S. There are some problems that I'm aware of, but can't currently fix (because they are out of the scope of this project). The main one is that individual words can have many different senses (meanings), so when you search for a word like mean, the engine doesn't know which definition you're referring to (\"bullies are mean\" vs. \"what do you mean?\", etc.), so consider that your search query for words like term may be a bit ambiguous to the engine in that sense, and the related terms that are returned may reflect this. You might also be wondering: What type of word is ~term~?\n\nAlso check out riot%20grrrl words on relatedwords.io for another source of associations.\n\nRelated Words\n\nRelated Words runs on several different algorithms which compete to get their results higher in the list. One such algorithm uses word embedding to convert words into many dimensional vectors which represent their meanings. The vectors of the words in your query are compared to a huge database of of pre-computed vectors to find similar words. Another algorithm crawls through Concept Net to find words which have some meaningful relationship with your query. These algorithms, and several more, are what allows Related Words to give you... related words - rather than just direct synonyms.\n\nAs well as finding words related to other words, you can enter phrases and it should give you related words and phrases, so long as the phrase/sentence you entered isn't too long. You will probably get some weird results every now and then - that's just the nature of the engine in its current state.\n\nSpecial thanks to the contributors of the open-source code that was used to bring you this list of riot%20grrrl themed words: @Planeshifter, @HubSpot, Concept Net, WordNet, and @mongodb.\n\nThere is still lots of work to be done to get this to give consistently good results, but I think it's at the stage where it could be useful to people, which is why I released it.\n\nPlease note that Related Words uses third party scripts (such as Google Analytics and advertisements) which use cookies.
