        "text": "SINGLE TICKETS $15!\n\nJoin us for two or more plays and save with $10 tickets. That's three play readings for the price of two.\n\nIn collaboration with The Fire This Time Festival and Watts Village Theater Company, Center Theatre Group presents a second season of Not A Moment, But A Movement, an initiative created to amplify, center, and celebrate Black voices.\n\nFor this second season, six woman-identifying or non-binary playwrights were commissioned to write new plays beginning in January 2021. Five of these playwrights— Z & Co” f/aka AzizA Barnes, Roger Q. Mason, Tahirih Moeller, Cynthia Grace Robinson, and t. tara turk-haynes—will have their resulting works read at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in a three-day festival Saturday, June 22–Monday, June 24. This will mark the first time that any of these plays will be presented to the public.\n\nThe plays deal with a wide range of themes—from personal coming of age stories and explorations of gender identity and body dysmorphia; to experiences of intimacy and joy; to complex issues about civil rights and queer identity; and the loss of independence while enduring dementia. The final play is an imagining of when Diahann Carroll, Sidney Poitier, Joann Woodward, Paul Newman, Duke Ellington, and Marlon Brando came together to make the 1961 movie Paris Blues about jazz expatriates in Paris.\n\nABOUT THE PLAYS AND PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nSaturday, June 22nd at 3pm\n\nKia Was Here\n\nWritten by Tahirih Moeller\n\nDirected by Bruce Lemon\n\nKia Was Here is about an 18-year-old named Kia and her 15-year-old niece named Kamille. The play takes place at two points in time: In the past, Kia copes with her first breakup by stealing her big brother’s (Kamille’s father’s) car to go on late-night snack runs. While Kamille struggles with her sexuality and her mother’s negative perception of her body. In the present, Kamille copes with the sudden and tragic loss of Kia by starving herself. Both Kia and Kamille experience hallucinations where food and objects come to life to give them advice on how to process grief.\n\nTahirih Moeller (she/her) is a writer-doodler from Long Beach, California who has worked with theatre companies such as Greenway Court Theatre, Long Beach Playhouse and PlayGround-LA. Her works include Actually Oranges (When life hands you lemons), a surreal comedy about a man who turns into orange juice, and Heroes of the West, a western parody following two cowgirls wrangling with misogyny. Outside of the theatre, Tahirih is a lifelong cartoon enthusiast, who is currently studying animation in hopes of merging her two loves: drawing and writing. Some of her notable accomplishments include receiving second place at the 2016 Hip Hop Theater Creator Award at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival for her play A Live Mixtape. She was also a Playwright-in-Residence with the California Repertory at her alma mater California State University, Long Beach. In 2019, she was featured in the American Theatre Magazine Role Call Series as “People to Watch.” Tahirih hopes to continue creating art that is not only entertaining but also thought-provoking.\n\nSaturday, June 22 at 7pm\n\nFKA I AM A BAD BLK PERSON\n\nWritten by Z & Co” f/aka AzizA Barnes\n\nDirected by nicHi douglas\n\nFKA I AM A BAD BLK PERSON is a continuation of the play BLKS: different characters, same question: why do i laugh when i am in pain?\n\nZ & Co” f/aka AzizA Barnes is alive on purpose in this earth drag.

Mason\n\nDirected by Nancy Keystone\n\nA young Bayard Rustin—before Civil Rights Movement fame—must choose between his private desires as a queer black man and his public calling as an agent of social justice and civic change. Set against the vibrant labor movement of the 1930s and 40s, this piece embraces the musicality, dream imagery, and liberation of jazz playwriting to explore one man's quest for complex humanity in a world that limits who we are to how we can be used for the good of others.\n\nRoger Q. Mason (they/them) was recently touted by The Brooklyn Rail as “quickly becoming one of the most significant playwrights of the decade.” Their playwriting has been seen on Broadway at Circle in the Square (Circle Reading Series); Off and Off-Off-Broadway at MCC Theatre with Carnegie Hall, La Mama ETC, New York Theatre Workshop, New Group, The Fire This Time Festival, Dixon Place, American Theatre of Actors, Flea Theatre and Access Theater; and regionally at McCarter Theatre, Center Theatre Group, Victory Gardens, Chicago Dramatists, Steep Theatre, Serenbe Playhouse, Theatre Rhinoceros, Open Fist Theatre Company, EST/LA, Coeurage Theatre, Rogue Artists Ensemble, Son of Semele and Skylight Theatre. Roger is an honoree of the Kilroys List; the Chuck Rowland Pioneer Award; The Fire This Time Festival Alumni Spotlight and the Hollywood Fringe Festival Encore Producers Award. Mason’s films have been recognized by the British Film Institute Flare Festival, Lonely Wolf International Film Festival, SCAD Film Festival, AT&T Film Award, Atlanta International Film Festival, Webby Awards and Telly Awards. They've screened at the British Film Institute Flare Festival, Lonely Wolf International Film Festival, Inside Out Festival (Toronto), SCAD Film Festival, Hollyshorts, Outfest and Outfest Fusion, Bentonville Film Festival, Outshine Film Festival and the Pan African Film Festival.

With the potential to shift the world on its cool and cultural axis, what was happening behind the scenes would be life pivots that would change them all forever."
