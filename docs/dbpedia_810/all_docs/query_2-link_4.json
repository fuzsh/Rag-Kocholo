        "text": "Anti-Scrunti Faction Damsels in Distress LP\n\nANTI-SCRUNTI FACTION champions the grunge-o-rama attack on their debut LP. The lyrics and punky spirit of this band go a long way, but the sameness of the songwriting detracts from the album’s ultimate impact. I’ll tell you one thing: if the whole album were as hot as “Suicide Note,” an impassioned thrasher, they’d have dynamite here.\n\nReviewer Steve Spinali\n\nLabel Flipside / Unclean\n\nIssue MRR #34 • March 1986\n\nAnti-Scrunti Faction A Sure Fuck EP\n\nThis mostly female combo pounds out garage punk. Vocalist sounds a bit like TEDDY of FRAT GIRLS fame, and the music is classic anyone-can-do-it stuff with personality and vim. Enjoyable, with serious subject lyrics.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Unclean\n\nIssue MRR #27 • August 1985"
