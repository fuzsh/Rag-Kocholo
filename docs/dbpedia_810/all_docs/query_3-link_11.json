        "text": "Alicia\n\nWhile Selina and her staff prepare for an Annapolis event where she will announce her candidacy, Dan gets word that SNL has done a not-so-flattering sketch on the Veep.\n\nAwful People\n\nWanting to see the faces behind the 9-1-1 calls, Maddie goes on a ride-along with Athena, while dealing with a seemingly âperfectâ dispatcher back at the call center. Meanwhile, Hen must figure out how to save her family from permanently falling apart, and the first responders deal with emergencies both at a military funeral and a movie theater.\n\nPay It Forward\n\nA series of freeway car accidents leads to a catastrophic overpass collapse that endangers the lives of civilians and members of the 118.\n\nFull Moon\n\nA full moon keeps the crew busy with some of the craziest calls yet, as Athena investigates a potential home invasion and âfaces offâ against a rabid criminal. Meanwhile, Abby helps investigate the murder of a caller, Bobby and Buck have their hands full at a yoga studio for pregnant women and Henâs past may become her future.\n\nMixed Feelings\n\nThe 118 race to the rescues with emergencies at a spin class; in a hair salon and to a husband and wife in a compromising position; Buck discovers new cognitive abilities post lightning strike; Hen and Karen are concerned when they find out Denny has been seeing his biological father behind their backs; Maddie and Chimney enlist Athena and Bobbyâs help with a suspicious neighbor."
