        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nBack when I worked at Amoeba Music, I wrote posts about all-female bands from the 1910s-1950s, all-female bands of the 1960s, and all-female bands of the 1970s. This year, for Women’s History Month, I had what I thought was the bright idea to combine them into one piece and update them. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Many people found suddenly themselves in possession of a surplus of free time. Others, myself included, have been beaten and battered by our jobs and — although I count myself lucky not to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2, it has meant that I did not have time to complete this commemoration and celebration of the overlooked contributions of all-female bands. If I’m completely honest — I may also have underestimated just how many all-female bands there have been. I knew that the number grew in the 1980s — which is why I stopped at the 1970s before.\n\nAnyway, here then is the directory, presented “in progress.” One of the nice things about writing online is that the writer can make changes, corrections, and additions that print publishers can not. Apologies to the many all-female bands currently left of or listed without details. Please bear with me as I update it as time permits.\n\nOne note before I continue. By “all-female bands,” I’m referring to bands comprised — at least at one point of their career — entirely of female musicians. This is different than “girl groups” which generally refers to musical assemblages of female singers backed by male musicians and singing, almost always, songs composed for them by men. I’m a fan of both all-female bands and girl groups, however, and both are included — alongside female composers, female solo performers, and female-fronted bands on this playlist to which you may wish to listen whilst consulting this directory.\n\nAs always, I encourage you to leave corrections and additions in the comment section.

All had played music for some time and Kaufman had previously-fronted the all-female Denise and Company.

They later (after a line-up shuffle) became the second version of a pre-existing all-female band, The Enchanted Forest.\n\nADDICTED2FICTION\n\nADHARA\n\nADICKDID\n\nLAS ADORABLES\n\nNo information available!\n\nADRIAN AND THE SICKNESS\n\nADULT MOM\n\nADVAETA\n\nADVERT\n\nADWAITH\n\nAEGIS\n\nAELLA\n\nAENYGMIST\n\nAEVAL\n\nA-FATI (AKA AMOR FATI)\n\nAFFLATUS\n\nTHE AFFECTIVES\n\nあふりらんぽ\n\nTHE AFTER LASHES\n\nAFTERMATH\n\nTHE AFTERMATH\n\nAGATHA [Italy]\n\nAGATHA [USA]\n\nA-GEN 53\n\nTHE A-LINES\n\nAGENT RIBBONS\n\nAGGI DOM\n\nAGHAST\n\nジ・アジナーズ\n\nAGNELA\n\nTHE AGONY\n\nAGONY AUNT\n\nAGORAPHOBIA\n\nAHORCATE\n\nAIAS\n\nAIRES ALTOS\n\nAISHA AND THE ASTRONAUTS\n\nAIVERY\n\nAJAH UK\n\nAKA\n\nTHE AKABANE VULGARS ON STRONG BYPASS\n\n赤い公園\n\nAKASU\n\nアカシジア\n\nAKB48\n\nLAS AKELAS\n\nLas Akelas were a Portuguese Ye-Ye band who released “Ratones de Belen” b/w “Campanas a ritmo.”\n\nAKIABANE\n\nAKKA\n\nAKRATAS\n\nAKUÃ\n\nTHE ALBANY PIANO TRIO\n\nALBION\n\nTHE ALCOHOLYS\n\nALDIOUS\n\nALICE AND THE LOVERS\n\nALICE IN DIXIELAND\n\nALIEN SHE\n\nALISON’S BIRTHDAY\n\nALIVE!\n\nTHE ALL GIRL BAND\n\nTHE ALL-GIRL BOYS\n\nTHE ALL-GIRL BOYS CHOIR\n\nALL GIRL SUMMER FUN BAND\n\nTHE ALL GIRL TOPLESS GROUP\n\nThe All Girl Topless Band formed in 1967 and accompanied comedian Godfrey Cambridge at the Aladdin Hotel.

The original line-up consisted of Kathleen Hanna (vocals), Billy Karren (guitar), Kathi Wilcox (bass), and Tobi Vail (drums). They were pioneers in the riot grrrl movement and released their debut cassette, Revolution Girl Style Now!, in 1991. They released two-full length albums, Pussy Whipped (1993) and Reject All American (1996) before disbanding in 1997. Vail played in several bands before, during, and after her stint with Bikini Kill, including Spider and the Webs, The Old Haunts, The Go Team, Some Velvet Sidewalk, and The Frumpies. Kathi Wilcox recorded an album with The Casual Dots. Billy Karren played in Ghost Mom. Kathleen Hanna recorded with Julie Ruin (originally a solo project) and Le Tigre. Bikini Kill reunited for tours in 2019 and 2020 with Erica Dawn Lyle replacing Billy Karren and thus making Bikini Kill an all-female band.\n\nLA BILIS NEGRA\n\n빌리카터\n\nビリ→部\n\nBIMBAMBOOM\n\nBINKY\n\nBINOMIO NÓMADA\n\nBIONIC FINGER\n\nBIRD\n\nBIRDEATSBABY\n\nBIRTHA\n\nLE BIRRETTE\n\nBIRU BABY\n\nBISK8\n\nBITCH\n\nBitch were from the Chicago area and were comprised of Donna Agresti (drums), Donna Kirkendall (bass), Gerre Edinger (guitar), Lorrie Kountz (guitar), and Nancy Davis (vocals).

Their debut, “The Hurtin’ Kind” b/w “Summertime,” was released on Tema in 1965. The same year they released “What a Lonely Way to Start the Summertime” b/w “Mark My Words” (as The Bitter Sweets) on Cameo.\n\nTHE BLACK BELLES\n\nBLACK CANDY\n\nTHE BLACK CATS/THE WOOPS\n\nIn 1965, Laila Larsson (vocals/bass), Lisbeth Regner (guitar), Mary-Ann Micha (guitar), and Agneta Engstrom (drums) formed The Black Cats in Malmo, Sweden. After re-naming themselves The Woops, they cut “Why” which was included on a various artists EP.

In 1921 she’d become the first woman to lead any band, the otherwise-all-male Joy Boys. As a bandleader who was both black and female in the early 20th century, she battled both racism and sexism. That band broke up in 1938 and she formed an all-female band in 1940 which, somewhat shockingly, I can’t find the name of anywhere. She retired in 1944. In the 1950s she managed a nightclub in DC. In the 1960s, she worked as DJ in Miami, Florida. She died in 1978 from breast cancer.\n\nBLANK SYMBOL\n\nBLARE BITCH PROJECT\n\nBLASFEMIA\n\nBLASHROCK\n\nBLAST ONES\n\nBLAXY GIRLS\n\nBLEACH\n\nBLEACHED\n\nBLEECH\n\nBLEEDING ON WEDNESDAY\n\nBLESSED NOISE\n\nBLINDNESS\n\n東京稲妻\n\nBLIZZARD BABIES\n\nBLKKATHY\n\nBLÓM\n\nTHE BLONDES\n\nTHE BLOODS\n\nBLOOD CAVE\n\nBLOOD HORSES\n\nBLOODSISTER\n\nBLOOD SUNDAE\n\nBLOODSWEEP\n\nBLOODY BENDERS\n\nBLOODY MARY [Austria]\n\nBLOODY MARY [Brazil]\n\nBLOODY MARY [USA]\n\nBLOODY REJECTS\n\nBLONDEWICH\n\nBLOOM TWINS\n\nTHE BLOW\n\nBLOW UP BETTY\n\nTHE BLOWDRIERS\n\nThe Blowdriers were an all-female punk band from the San Francisco Bay area who recorded the song, “Berkeley Farms” which was included on the 1993 compilation Killed By Death #13.\n\nBLOWDRYER\n\nBLOWFLIES\n\nBlowfies formed near Holstebro, Denmark in 1967.

They scored a contract with Amy and released “You’re Never Gonna Get My Lovin’” b/w a cover of Leonard Cohen’s “Suzanne” on in January, 1968. A review of one of their performances at Le Hibou in Ottawa mentions that their repertoire also drew from the Beatles and the Stones. Several of their songs were products of the partnership of Mort Schuman and Kenny Lynch, who replaced all of the original members for another version of the band after their stint in Canada. After disbanding Hunter went on to join Neil Diamond’s band.\n\nThe second line-up of Enchanted Forest consist of Missy Wolcott (keyboards/bass), Peg Porter (lead guitar/bass), Sandy Klee-Phillips (drums), and Fran DiCicco (keyboards/bass) – who’d previously played together in Act IV, another all-female New York (Long Island this time) band that had formed in 1966. Porter soon left the band and was replaced by Marilyn Pollack. In 1969 they released two singles on Variations – both with “The Word Is Love” as the A-side (The B-sides were “Cold Winds” and “I’m Not That Kind of Girl”). In 1970 they backed Tiny Tim for a tour that included a performance of The Ed Sullivan Show.

They relocated to Australia in 1970. Williams left and was replaced by June Littin and Bradfield left and was replaced by Kaye Wolfgramm. This line-up, with Faye Reid as the only original member, lasted until 1972.\n\nWolfgramm next appeared singing in the band Cruise Lane. Gray resurfaced in Noazark. Littin co-authored Maria Dallas’s “Pinocchio,” a Kiwi chart-topper in 1970.\n\nFANNY\n\nPinay sisters June Millington and Jean Millington moved to Sacramento, California from Manila in 1961.

Brandt was replaced by Alice de Buhr and they played one gig in Los Angeles in 1969 as Wild Honey before changing their name to Fanny. In 1970 they were joined by Nickey Barclay (vocals, keyboards) and the first line-up released the eponymous Fanny (1970), followed by Charity Ball (1971), and Fanny Hill (1972). In 1973, June Millington and Alice de Buhr were replaced by Patti Quatro (guitar, ex-The Pleasure Seekers) and Brie Brandt, who returned to the fold to play drums. After the release of Mother’s Pride (1973) and Rock and Roll Survivors (1974), Fanny disbanded in 1975 — by which time Cam Davis had taken over drums. Rhino compiled Fanny’s first four albums with live recordings, outtakes, and promotional material in the box set First Time in a Long Time.\n\nAfter they disbanded, the Millington’s formed a new line-up of Fanny which quickly morphed into the LA All-Stars. June Millington moved into music production and later co-founded the Institute for the Musical Arts in Bodega, California. Jean later worked as an herbalist although she and June revived Fanny to release Play Like a Girl in 2011. Patti Quatro went on to work as a session musician, Brie Brandt (now Brie Howard-Darling) has worked as a session musician with many performers and in the 1980s formed American Girls.\n\nTHE FATIMAS\n\nThe Fatimas were a California band who released “Sandstorm” b/w “The Hoochy Coo” on Original Sound in 1967.\n\nFEEBEEZ\n\nFeebeez apparently cut one single, “Walk Away” b/w “Season Come,” on Albuquerque‘s Stange Records — owned by Edward Stange Jr., apparently his daughter was the band’s drummer.\n\nTHE FEMALE BEATLES\n\nThe Female Beatles seem to have formed in Long Island, New York around 1964 and were managed by the Jolly Joyce Agency.

They were led by Linda Sanders (drummer/vocals) who was joined by younger sister Debbie Sanders (guitar), Debbie McMillan (bass), and Jeannie Foster (guitar/keyboards), who initially met one another in a music class when all were pre-teens. They were managed by the Sanders family’s matriarch, Jeanne Sanders. They gained attention in 1968 when they appeared on Happening Now and won a battle of the bands with their version of The Outsiders‘ “Time Won’t Let Me.” Their mother subsequently turned down an offer to sign with ABC Records because she wanted them to stay in school. They recorded a cover of Mouse & the Traps‘ “Crying Inside” at Robin Hood Brian’s Studio in Tyler, Texas which became their biggest hit.

In 1967, the Ross sisters were joined by a new line-up comprised of Kathy Rice on guitar, Ginny Revis on drums, and Karen Luther on keyboards and the new line-up was christened She. Revis was soon replaced by Gayle Lee and Rice by Janis Volkoff. Lee was replaced in 1969 by Reesha Scarborough.

Initially, Kleenex were assisted by Rudolph Dietrich and Gogi Düggelbach of Nasal Boys (I smell a theme here) but the core of the band was always female, revolving around the duo of Ha and Schiff. Sing (nee Ramona Carlier) left to join The Mo-Dettes and was replaced by Chrigle Freund, who was subsequently replaced by Astrid Spirit. In 1979, faced with legal action from the popular American manufacturer of snot rags, Kleenex changed their name to LiLiPUT, and no legal threat ensued from the estate of Jonathan Swift. After their dissolution, Marder wrote the book, Kleenex/LiLiPUT – Das Tagebuch der Gitarristin Marlene Marder and the band’s output was collected and released by Kill Rock Stars as LiLiPUT.\n\nTHE KLITZ\n\nThe Klitz formed in Memphis, Tennessee in 1978 and were comprised of Amy Gassner (bass), Gail Elise Clifton (vocals), Lesa Aldridge (guitar), and Marcia Clifton (drums).

The Danish band formed around 1968 (there was also a vocal trio called The Ladybirds who sang on the Benny Hill Show) and included Margit Nellemann Andersen, who’d earlier played in the all-female Les Filles. The other members were Puk Birgit Petersen, Lonni Andersen, and Michelle Beauvais. They were managed by Pierre Beauvais, formerly of The Strangers.\n\nLater line-ups included Pia Thurland, Hanne Mattson, and Marianne Hall Frederiksen (formerly of the all-female Cheetas). In 1968 they naturally opened for The New Yardbirds at Roskilde. They performed as far away as Bristol, England in 1973.\n\nTHE LADYBIRDS (US)\n\nThe Ladybirds supposedly formed in New Jersey. Although Jim Morrison often performed top-free with The Doors, The Ladybirds were hassled for doing the same. They found more receptive audiences out west in Las Vegas, at Tipsy’s in San Francisco, the Blue Bunny Club in Hollywood. They were managed at various points by Voss Boreta (husband of topless dancer Yvonne D’Angers and manager of topless dancer, Carol Doda) and professional golfer Raymond Floyd.

Two days before they performed their gender-tweaked version of The Beatles’ “I Saw Him Standing There” and “I’ll Be Your Ladybug If You’ll Be My Beatle” on that television series, they performed the former on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. I’m not sure whether or not they actually played their instruments or were a completely fictional performing act.\n\nLAVENDER JANE\n\nLavender Jane were comprised of Alix Dobkin, Kay Gardner, and Patches Attom.

I’m not sure who were the members and whether or not they were a full-fledged group or just a vocal group with backing. I would guess the former, if only because the playing on the LP is far too rudimentary to have been the work of session musicians.\n\nMANDY AND THE GIRLFRIENDS\n\nMandy and the Girlfriends were from Hull, where they formed in 1965. Mandy was Mandy Smith, who’d previously played in Mandy and the Moonrakers with her brother.
