Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t ;-)\n\nIn the coming weeks, I’ll be chatting with the beautiful and (of course) curly Traci Nicole Thoms and like with Judith Hill, I want to get your input!\n\nTraci Thoms is a stage and television actress best known for her roles in Rent, Cold Case, and The Devil Wears Prada. I’ve seen her hair in gorgeous twists, wash-n-go’s, and what appears to be rod sets.\n\nSo my lovely curlies, I’m asking you to help me structure the interview. What questions would you like answered?!\n\nLeave your suggestions in the comments below!"
