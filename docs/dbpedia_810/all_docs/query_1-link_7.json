Matt sensed that there were many musicians in the community that wanted to play their instruments, but there was no local organization in which to participate. Fifty people responded to his call to form a band. We started rehearsing weekly on September 8, 2009, and we performed our inaugural concert on Sunday, October 25, 2009 at the Elk's Lodge in Easton. The band was originally called the Easton Community Band, but in early December 2009 we changed the name to Mid-Shore Community Band to reflect the area that we intended to serve.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Matt Fullerton resigned as Music Director because he was having to miss too many famly events such as sports, concerts, recitals, etc. John Banghart became our Interrim Music Director at the beginning of 2016. EJ Oesterle, took over as Music Director in June of 2016. EJ joined Mid-Shore Community Band as a percussionist,and was the band's Music Director from 2016-2023. Matt Fullerton returned as our Music Director in 2024.\n\nContact Us:"
