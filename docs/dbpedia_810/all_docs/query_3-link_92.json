Rent is the seventh longest running show in Broadway history.\n\nRent is the story of Le Boheme retold about poor New Yorkers on Lower East Side with a different ending.\n\nThe musical, directed Michael Greif and choreographed by Marlies Yearby, currently features Adam Kantor (Mark Cohen), Will Chase (Roger Davis), Justin Johnston (Angel), Eden Espinosa (Maureen), Tonya Dixon (Joanne), Rodney Hicks (Benny), Michael McElroy (Collins), Merle Dandridge (Joanne) and Renï¿½e Elise Goldsberry (Mimi).\n\nThe show has set design by Paul Clay, costumes by Angela Wendt and lighting by Blake Burba."
