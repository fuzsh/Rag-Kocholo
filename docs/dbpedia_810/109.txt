Anti-Scrunti Faction Damsels in Distress LP

ANTI-SCRUNTI FACTION champions the grunge-o-rama attack on their debut LP. The lyrics and punky spirit of this band go a long way, but the sameness of the songwriting detracts from the album’s ultimate impact. I’ll tell you one thing: if the whole album were as hot as “Suicide Note,” an impassioned thrasher, they’d have dynamite here.

Anti-Scrunti Faction A Sure Fuck EP

This mostly female combo pounds out garage punk. Vocalist sounds a bit like TEDDY of FRAT GIRLS fame, and the music is classic anyone-can-do-it stuff with personality and vim. Enjoyable, with serious subject lyrics.
