        "meta_description": "Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal: Directed by Carlton Sherwood. With Carlton Sherwood, Kenneth W. Cordier, George Day, Jack H. Fellowes. In the mid 1960's thousands of young American men left their families, homes and jobs and went to fight for their country in Southeast Asia. Many of them never returned. Others were shot down and captured behind enemy lines. They were forced to suffer years of brutal treatment at the hands of the Communist captors. In the opinions of this political affiliation, their horrifying days of darkness, starvation and torture were made worse by the actions of a young American Officer named John Kerry.",

        "text": "Why is it that the only negative comment on this movie is the comment that is displayed at the review page of this movie. Is this once again an example of Hollywood and the Hollywood Elite trying to control American Public Opinion because \"they\" know what is best for us. Whether we want to accept their elitist views or not.\n\nAs a teenager at the Air Force Academy and as an adult who retired from the US Air Force, I can only say that this is a film every American should see.\n\nIt would help tremendously in righting the wrongs of the lies of the American Vietnam Anti-War Movement, the Hollywood Elitist, and the Liberal American Media.\n\nEvery American should realize that if the lies of the American Media and Hollywood Film Industry about the Vietnam War are not challenged, then we smear, tarnish, and drag through the mud the honor and dignity of every American Soldier in the past 228 years.\n\nAmerican Soldiers do not deserve this indignity by the Liberal Elite.\n\nTHIS FILM IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE FOR EVERY American VETERAN.\n\nGOD BLESS America, AND GOD FORGIVE JOHN KERRY."
