        "text": "We’re looking for an experienced filmmaker who wants to explore, through a short documentary, how climate change is affecting lives and work in the global south. We want to amplify new perspectives, stories and voices on our changing climate with particular focus on the economic transition.\n\nThrough Pulitzer’s Our Work/Environment initiative, journalists have documented some of the risks of rising temperatures for workers, in fields and in factories. In the past two years, reporters have traveled throughout India and across Nigeria, Ghana, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Uruguay, Paraguay and South Africa to document the impact of extreme heat and weather on some of the world’s most vulnerable workers—including women who are often heads of household—and we encourage stories that detail the interconnected nature of business, climate, and consumer choices. We want to understand workers. We want to understand companies. We appreciate accountability reporting.\n\nTo apply you’ll need to be from the global south and working in the global south. We’re particularly keen to hear creative proposals, ideas that are newsworthy, cover an underreported story, or hear from people who are often unheard and offer unexpected or rare access to working conditions and workplaces.\n\nYour film will need to be 25 minutes or less and be completed by June 2025.\n\nThe successful filmmaker will receive the following:\n\nUp to £20k funding for their film\n\nA named executive for their documentary and production support\n\nA commission from the Financial Times with their final film made freely available on the FT’s platform.\n\nGlobal promotion of their film from all three partners and associated screenings\n\nMembership of the OWM global alumni network\n\nAnd an industry mentor\n\nTo apply you’ll need to show:\n\n5+ years of evidenced experience as a documentary-maker. We want to see links to recent work, broadcast credits or festival screenings.\n\nReferences from a previous commissioner/exec\n\nA recorded pitch (3 minutes or under) – this can be filmed on your phone or an audio recording – about your idea\n\nA written synopsis of your idea with a detailed budget.\n\nIf your film is reliant on negotiating particular access or following a particular person/subject we want you to show how far along you are with these discussions.\n\nThe deadline for applications is 1 Sep 2024.\n\nWe particularly encourage submissions from underrepresented groups (people of colour, ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+, or people with disabilities)"
