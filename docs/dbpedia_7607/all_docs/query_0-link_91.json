        "text": "The true crime wave has been carrying us along its current for some time now, and it doesn't show signs of crashing any time soon. The best true crime documentaries in the world prove that humanity's darkest parts are vast and varying, from murders and theft to high-level coverups and tech-boom scams.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason why we're so fascinated with true crime. Some may say it's a way to arm themselves against the possibility of personal harm, while others may fancy themselves a kind of armchair psychoanalysers, getting into the minds of the depraved from the safety of a 30-inch screen. Whatever the reason, morbid fascination or otherwise, there are plenty of real-life misdeeds committed to film that are just a few clicks away.\n\nHere are the 20 best true crime documentaries you can stream right now.\n\n20. Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult (2020)\n\nIf there's one thing society loves more than discovering the existence of a new cult, it's learning about how people managed to get sucked into them. In 2018, the so-called ‘human development’ cult NXIVM gained international attention after a New York Times exposé revealed sexual abuse and human trafficking allegations under its leader Keith Raniere and his right-hand woman, the Smallville actress Allison Mack. Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult came out in 2020, two years after the investigation and a year after Raniere and Mack were charged for their crimes. The series is told from the point of view of India Oxenberg, a former member of NXIVM, as she tries to make sense of the cult she was consumed by and repair her relationship with her loved ones. In it, she also talks to other former members, who try to untangle the cultish power of Raniere's influence. You can watch Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult on Amazon.\n\n19. Don't F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer (2019)\n\nToo often we're sucked into something based on a really great title only to be disappointed at the actual product. That's not the case with the strikingly named Don't F**k with Cats which digs into the armchair detectives behind one of the most gruesome killers of the internet age. When an anonymous user uploads a video of himself killing two kittens (it's not shown in the series, but a warning if even proximity to animal cruelty makes you queasy), a group of animal-loving internet-literate Facebook users go on a hunt to track him down. They do everything from analysing plug sockets to tracking down specific items in the shot to see where he could have bought them. When they eventually discover him, it turns into a whole new documentary as his victim pool is about to be much bigger than a few cats. You can watch Don't F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer on Netflix.\n\n18. Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017)\n\nThe story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard is the stuff of true crime legend and one that feels ripped from the celluloid of procedural crime drama and not true life. Since her birth, Gypsy Rose was in and out of hospital diagnosed with rare, debilitating disease after rare, debilitating disease. She was wheelchair-bound, forced to eat through a feeding tube and her head was shaved due to cancer. Well, she thought. It turns out her mother, Dee Dee, had faked the whole thing in a particularly extreme case of Munchausen by Proxy, which saw her constantly fundraise and rinse funds on behalf of her daughter. When Gypsy Rose found out, she killed her mother and went to jail. Mommy Dead and Dearest digs into the entire story of Gypsy Rose and Dee Dee and explores the story from the point of view of Gypsy Rose, who does talking head explanations in her prison stripes (she is now free as of 2023). You can watch Mommy Dead and Dearest on Amazon.\n\n17. The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley (2019)\n\nBy now, Elizabeth Holme's healthcare grift is common knowledge. Between a dramatised retelling of her story in The Dropout, a stellar podcast (which the series is based around) and a book, there's nothing we don't know about Theranos and the long-con of Holmes' tech aspirations. Still, what's another version thrown into the mix for good measure?\n\nThe Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley is the documentary analysis of Holmes and her quest to rid the world of invasive blood tests and instead replace them with pinprick machines that would be available in drug stores. Before her empire came crashing down, she'd amassed billions in funding, a cover of TIME magazine and a slew of unaware victims. There are some true crime stories that, no matter how many angles you hear them from, you still will want to explore more. The hubris of Holmes is one of those stories, which makes the plethora of options available a welcome feast. You can stream The Inventor on Amazon.\n\n16. How to Create a Sex Scandal (2023)\n\nHow to Create a Sex Scandal is exactly what it sounds like, even if, on the face of it, it sounds bonkers. But the series looks at a truly remarkable case not dissimilar to the height of the 80s Satanic Panic, where people were conned into believing multiple pre-schools were running underground Satanic rings. The show follows a small town in Texas that was rocked by the testimony of five children who said they'd been groomed into sexual abuse at a local swinger's bar. The problem is, that didn't happen, but it didn't stop law enforcement from bringing down the gauntlet with the help of a manipulative foster parent on a power trip. It's a devastating look at a community torn apart by scandal, and the lives in the middle – from impressionable children to innocent people accused – affected by paranoia. You can stream How to Create a Sex Scandal on Amazon.\n\n15. Mind Over Murder (2022)\n\nMind Over Murder delivers a truly tragic picture of criminal malpractice at its most life-ruining. In 1985, Helen Wilson was raped and murdered in Beatrice, Nebraska and six people admitted to the crime. The problem is that none of them were there. Led along by the harsh currents of legal jargon and public outcry, the six defendants were coerced into pleading guilty to the murder on the basis of hokey ideas of repressed memories and the threat of the death penalty repeatedly hung over them. In 2008, the real murderer was revealed through DNA testing and the six were exonerated, but the tragedy of their lives behind bars is a stain on the criminal justice system. The six-part series chronicles the case, the trials and the civil rights lawsuit that cleared the six's names. You can stream Mind Over Murder on NowTV.\n\n14. The Devil Next Door (2019)\n\nHow well do you really know your neighbours? Could the kindly man next door, for example, actually be a war criminal? That's the crux of The Devil Next Door, which explores the 1986 capture of John Demjanjuk, a Nazi concentration camp guard who fled to Cleveland, Ohio and led a relatively peaceful life as a mechanic.\n\nAfter being extradited to Israel, he is accused of being ‘Ivan the Terrible’ a particularly gruesome figure in the landscape of Nazi crimes. The documentary is intercut with footage from his trial, with harrowing Holocaust victim statements, as well as talking head commentary from lawyers, journalists and Holocaust historians. It's your classic Netflix true crime template, but one that will have you eyeing up your neighbours a little more than usual afterwards. You can watch The Devil Next Door on Netflix.\n\n13. The Crime of the Century (2021)\n\nBy now, the devastating effects of the opioid crisis, ushered in by Big Pharma and the Sackler Family, are well known. They've been dramatised in shows like Dopesick and Painkiller, and even provide artistic license for the new Mike Flanagan horror series The Fall of the House of Usher. But if you want to know just how insidious the introduction of highly addictive medication was unleashed onto America with little regard for people and huge regard for profits, then The Crime of the Century is about as detailed as you can get. Made by Alex Gibney, who created the definitive Scientology doc Going Clear, this series takes an unrelenting look at the tragedy of a nation crippled by opioids, taking everyone from Purdue execs to government officials to task. You can stream The Crime of the Century on Apple TV+.\n\n12. Long Shot (2017)\n\nNot only is Long Shot a bonkers story about exposing a suspected killer's innocence, it's also a bite-sized 40 minutes long. Back in 2003, Juan Catalan was arrested for the murder of Martha Puebla in Los Angeles after fitting a witness composite sketch. However, he now walks free and it's all thanks to… Larry David?\n\nIn what could have been a classic case of an innocent man incarcerated, Catalan was exonerated of the crime after he appeared in the crowd in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm filmed at a baseball game at the time of the murder. Honestly, if any story calls for a Curb Your Enthusiasm sharp credits cut-in, it's this one. You can stream Long Shot on Netflix.\n\n11. Last Call: When A Serial Killer Stalked Queer New York (2023)\n\nIn the 1990s, serial killer Richard Rogers – also known as the Last Call Killer – murdered four gay men on America's East Coast. What should have been a tragic story about victims falling prey to a murderer ended up being tabloid fodder, with homophobia dripping through the examination of the crimes and biases within the criminal justice system failing victims and their families. In this four-part documentary, these victims are given what they weren't at the end of their lives – humanity. Each episode is dedicated to one of the men killed by Rogers, with testimony from family members and loved ones. In comparison to many true crime docs, the lens is planted firmly on the victims and the lives that were taken from them. While the series looks into Rogers' crimes, and how he ended up with the nickname the Last Call Killer, its aim is to focus on the men who didn't get a fair shot at the time. You can stream Last Call: When A Serial Killer Stalked Queer New York on NowTV.\n\n10. Making a Murderer (2015-2018)\n\nBack when the idea of a monoculture was still hanging on by its talons, Netflix's Making a Murderer gripped the world in a way that had barely been seen up until that point in the streaming age. Millions of us tuned in to the first season, which chronicled the convictions of Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey after they were accused of the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. Over 10 episodes, details of the crime and the potentially corrupt way the police handled the investigation whipped viewers into a frenzy, highlighting just one of the myriad cases of people chewed up by the justice system based on circumstantial evidence. The series ends up being a compelling bird's-eye look at the crime and ended up with mass outrage over the verdicts. You can stream Making a Murderer on Netflix.\n\n9. The Staircase (2018)\n\nAs true-crime series go, The Staircase doesn't innovate. It's your classic case of chronological retelling mixed with some courtroom drama, but its central case is what makes it unique and bizarre. It focuses on the death of Kathleen Peterson and the arrest of her husband Michael. In 2001, Michael called emergency services saying Kathleen had died falling down the stairs, but he was soon convicted of her murder. What inevitably comes to light are skeletons from Michael's past, including another mysterious death. The Staircase offers unprecedented access to Michael himself, giving viewers the chance to figure out just whether his eccentric charisma is the kind that could manifest in violence or just be misinterpreted. The answer is never quite clear. You can watch The Staircase on Netflix.\n\n8. The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst (2015)\n\nOne of the common complaints of the true crime boom, especially offerings centred around unsolved mysteries, is that there's never much resolution. Having consumed hours of case material and context, sometimes all you're left with is a brain full of murder. HBO's The Jinx, however, doesn't suffer that curse, as its timeline of real-world updates and weekly TV airings serendipitously aligned right before its final episode. The series follows the investigation into Robert Durst, a real estate heir tangled up in the unsolved murders of his wife, a novelist and his neighbour. The documentary gives exclusive access to someone who constantly thinks they have the upper hand until they don't. The result is some of the most satisfying and complete real-time true crime reporting ever put on screen. You can stream The Jinx on Amazon.\n\n7. The Keepers (2017)\n\nIn terms of massive societal coverups, the Catholic church is about as much of a behemoth as you can get. Over the years, endemic sexual abuse within the order has come to light despite obvious attempts to quell those stories. In Netflix's The Keepers, an investigation is launched into an under-documented element of the story, namely what happens to the people who attempt to whistleblow from inside. It follows the unsolved murder of nun Catherine Cesnik who was killed in 1969 under the belief that she'd uncovered sexual abuse by one of the priests, A. Joseph Maskell, at a Baltimore school. What could simply be your standard true crime chronology ends up being a powerful megaphone to victims, namely Cesnik's former pupils who have kept her memory, death and unachieved justice alive for more than 60 years. You can stream The Keepers on Netflix.\n\n6. OJ: Made In America (2016)\n\nOne of the most infamous murder cases in history gets an extensive and thorough examination thanks to the 5-part series OJ: Made in America. Rather than just focusing on the details of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, as well as the highly-publicised trial of OJ Simpson, the docuseries looks at the societal tension brewing around the murder case as a way to try and explain the circus around it. It chronicles the major timeline moments of Simpson's life, such as his ascent to football stardom, celebrity status, trial for murder, later acquittal and then further brushes with the law, but all the while it's shown through the lens of the racial politics of the age. While the victims of the initial crime are undoubtedly the focal point of the documentary, that lens ends up being more of a Trojan horse that instead offers one of the most in-depth and deft understandings of race and America on film. You can stream OJ: Made In America on BBC iPlayer.\n\n5. The Imposter (2012)\n\nThe Imposter is one of those true crime stories that is so farfetched that it almost has to be fiction. In fact, many of the crime procedurals that litter television have used it as almost verbatim inspiration, but make no mistake, this is a real story. The film follows the 1997 case of a French trickster named Frédéric Bourdin, who infiltrated a Texas family by pretending to be their son, Nicholas Barclay, who had disappeared three years earlier at the age of 13. In the case of this film, no synopsis can do justice to the web weaved by Bourdin to convince a family he's their long-lost son. His intricate con involves multiple international bureaus, accusations of murder and coverup and the gall to try and make people believe that he, at the age of 23 and with a French accent, was a 16-year-old American child. You can stream The Imposter on Netflix.\n\n4. Capturing the Friedmans (2003)\n\nWhat starts as a documentary about working clowns ends up being a deep-dive into abuse and familial trauma in Capturing the Friedmans, the 2003 film focusing on the 1980s investigation into Jesse and Arnold Friedman. The pair were convicted of owning hoards of child pornography and later of multiple molestations of local children who were taught computer classes in their basement. With a way into the orbit of the Friedmans 20 years later thanks to Jesse's brother David, the film makes the most of the 80s home movie boom which gives hours of insight into the daily lives of a family housing secrets. What, to many, was a cut-and-dry case, also opens itself up to further speculation as the documentary asks many unanswered questions. You can stream Capturing the Friedmans on Amazon.\n\n3. Abducted in Plain Sight (2017)\n\nAbout every three minutes watching Abducted in Plain Sight, your face will end up accidentally mimicking that shocked Pikachu meme. Just mouth open, eyes wide, unable to process what you're watching. It's one of the most bizarre true crime stories made for the screen, about a family who falls prey to the manipulative efforts of their next-door neighbour and lets their young daughter be abducted by him. Twice. On the face of it, that's kooky enough, but it only gets more unbelievable as the twists mount into some kind of neverending maze. There are aliens, adultery to save the world and parents who feel so unaware of the real-world danger they could convincingly be NPCs brought to life. See it to believe it, but even then, you might not. You can stream Abducted in Plain Sight on Netflix.\n\n2. Girl in the Picture (2022)\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms about our voraciousness for true crime is how often victims are pushed aside in their own stories. Girl in the Picture is completely about the victim, with her life so finely examined that it's not until a third of the way in that the perpetrator of her death is revealed as one of the most notorious American criminals of all time. What starts as an investigation into a seemingly simple hit-and-run uncovers an almost 30-year story of kidnapping, abuse and identity fraud. While the scale of the depravity that surrounds the victim feels almost too expansive and brutal to comprehend, the film also does an incredible job of finding the simple humanity in its subject. Hearing from people who loved her, despite the secretive cloud around her, prevents the easy trap of dehumanisation that happens when a perpetrator takes up so much of the space in a story.

Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father (2008)\n\nSo many murder documentaries follow such a similar structure that you can almost predict their beats. Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father is unlike anything else that existed before or even after its release in 2008. Filmmaker Kurt Kuenne seeks to make a film about his best friend Andrew Bagby, travelling across the world to interview friends, family and loved ones – especially his parents – as a gift for Bagby's son, Zachary. Bagby was murdered by his scorned girlfriend, Shirley Turner, who, unbeknownst at the time, was pregnant with his child. The murder, pregnancy, conviction and aftermath make up the backdrop of the film, with its intimate, posthumous portrayal of a whole and loved person ripped from the arms of those who cared about him making up the foreground. It's a beautiful memorial to a murdered person – something that is often left out of true crime retellings – but also more of a gut-punch than you could ever expect by the end. You can watch Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father on Amazon.\n\nEnjoyed the best true crime documentaries? Why not watch the best crime movies next?"
