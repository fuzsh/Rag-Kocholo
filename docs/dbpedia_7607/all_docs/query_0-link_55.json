Based on a true story.\n\nAbout the Filmmakers\n\nWriter/director Danielle Lurie graduated from Stanford University in 2000 with a B.A. in philosophy. She’s worked as production assistant on numerous features such as Terminator 3, House of Sand and Fog, as well as television shows and commercials. Her first short films Nostrum, a drama, and Harris Ranch, a mini-documentary, played at several 2004 film festivals. Lurie worked with KA-MER, (the Women’s Center of Diyarbakir, Turkey) and teamed with cinematographer Andrew Huebscher (Swallow) to make In The Morning, about the pressing issue of honor killings. Although shot in Los Angeles with an American cast and crew, the film is set in Turkey and spoken in Turkish. She is developing a feature-length version of this short.\n\nDo you also believe in the power of film to raise awareness and challenge stereotypes that limit girls’ and women’s rights?\n\nJoin The Crew, our monthly giving program, and help us bring these powerful films to worldwide audiences!\n\nWant to share films from Voices for Change with your community, school, or other network?
