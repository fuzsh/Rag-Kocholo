        "text": "Voting Now Open for Audience Choice Prize — 20 of the Year’s Most Acclaimed and Talked About Docs Named to Longlist\n\nAnnual Shorts List and Unforgettables Honorees Revealed\n\nHulu’s The 1619 Project and Showtime’s Nothing Lasts Forever Top Broadcast Nominations\n\nLos Angeles, C.A., October 19, 2023 — Cinema Eye Honors, the organization that recognizes outstanding artistic achievement in nonfiction and documentary films and series, kicked off its 17th season today with its first awards announcements for 2024. Among the announcements were the nominees in five Broadcast categories, the annual Shorts List — spotlighting 10 of the year’s top documentary short films — the 20 films on the Audience Choice Prize Long List and the unveiling of this year’s Unforgettables Honorees.\n\nHulu’s The 1619 Project and Showtime’s Nothing Lasts Forever led today’s Broadcast Film and Series announcements with three nominations each. The 1619 Project, adapted from Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones work with the New York Times and executive produced by Oprah Winfrey, scored nods in Anthology Series, Broadcast Editing and Broadcast Cinematography. Jason Kohn’s Nothing Lasts Forever, which entertainingly explores the history and future of the diamond industry, scored nods in Broadcast Film, Broadcast Editing and Broadcast Cinematography.\n\nHulu led all networks and streamers with eight nominations in all. Netflix scored five nominations, while Showtime received four. Other films and series receiving multiple nominations include Hulu’s Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields, directed by Lana Wilson; National Geographic’s Edge of the Unknown with Jimmy Chin; Netflix’s Our Planet II; FX’s Dear Mama, directed by Allen Hughes, and Peacock’s Paul T. Goldman, directed by Jason Woliner.\n\nIn addition to the Broadcast nominations, Cinema Eye also announced the Audience Choice Award Long List which includes 20 of the year’s most acclaimed and talked about documentaries. Each year, tens of thousands of nonfiction fans have the opportunity to select the final ten nominees and the ultimate winner. This year’s Audience Choice Prize Long List films include many of the year’s most acclaimed and talked about documentaries.\n\nCinema Eye also announced the ten films on this year’s Shorts List, the organization’s annual list of semi-finalists for its Nonfiction Short Film Honor. Of those ten films, five or six will be announced as the official nominees in the Cinema Eye Honors Short Film category next month. For the first time Cinema Eye will screen all ten of the Shorts List films in both Los Angeles and New York, with a screening at Vidiots in LA on Saturday, October 21 and in NYC at DCTV on Sunday, November 19.\n\nFinally, Cinema Eye announced its annual list of The Unforgettables – a category unique to Cinema Eye that celebrates the collaboration between filmmakers and the participants in front of the camera. These individuals from 15 feature films mark the first named Honorees for the 2024 awards.\n\nToday’s announcements were made at the annual Cinema Eye Fall Lunch, held in Downtown Los Angeles. The Lead Host for the Fall Lunch was National Geographic Documentary Films. Co-Hosts included Hulu, Max and Netflix.\n\nA full list of this year’s announcements and nominees follows.\n\nAudience Choice Award Long List\n\n20 Days in Mariupol\n\nDirected by Mstyslav Chernov\n\n32 Sounds\n\nDirected by Sam Green\n\nAmerican Symphony\n\nDirected by Matthew Heineman\n\nBeyond Utopia\n\nDirected by Madeleine Gavin\n\nBobi Wine: The People’s President\n\ndirected by Christopher Sharp and Moses Bwayo\n\nA Compassionate Spy\n\nDirected by Steve James\n\nConfessions of a Good Samaritan\n\nDirected by Penny Lane\n\nThe Deepest Breath\n\nDirected by Laura McGann\n\nThe Eternal Memory\n\nDirected by Maite Alberdi\n\nGoing to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project\n\nDirected by Joe Brewster and Michèle Stephenson\n\nLittle Richard: I Am Everything\n\nDirected by Lisa Cortés\n\nInvisible Beauty\n\nDirected by Bethann Hardison and Frédéric Tcheng\n\nJoan Baez I Am a Noise\n\nDirected by Karen O’Connor, Miri Navasky and Maeve O’Boyle\n\nKokomo City\n\nDirected by D.
