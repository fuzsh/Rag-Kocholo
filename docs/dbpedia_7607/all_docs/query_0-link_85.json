        "text": "UPDATED with amended description of documentary My Sweet Land. Sheffield DocFest, the U.K.’s premiere nonfiction film festival, today revealed the full lineup for its 31st edition running June 12-17. Among the highlights: the world premiere of Tilda Swinton’s feature directorial debut, The Hexagonal Hive and a Mouse in a Maze, co-directed by Bartek Dziadosz.\n\nIn the film, premiering in International Competition, Swinton and Dziadosz “travel the world to understand what it means to learn, and along the way uncover playful food for thought – for adults and young people alike.” Swinton previously directed segments in the documentaries The Seasons In Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger (2016) and The New Ten Commandments (2008).\n\nSheffield 2024 will not lack for star power. In addition to Oscar winner Swinton, Idris Elba and the team behind the upcoming National Geographic Documentary series Erased: WW2’s Heroes of Color will take part in a public talk. Elba narrates the episodic, which “sheds light on the immense contributions of over 8 million individuals who fought heroically for the Allied forces and whose stories have largely gone untold,” per NatGeo. Elba’s grandfather fought in WWII.\n\nActor Michael Sheen will record a live edition of the podcast The Last Witness, created by investigative journalists Dan Ashby and Lucy Taylor in collaboration with Sheen. It’s a true crime series involving an environmental horror story. BBC Radio 4 will begin airing the 10-parter on June 24.\n\n“It’s hard to get your head around,” Sheen tells the BBC. “This story is about the first of the forever chemicals. And there are so many of them since then. We want people to understand what they are doing right now. There were moments in this story when a little voice inside my head was screaming.”\n\nThree-time Oscar winner Walter Murch, the legendary sound and picture editor, will participate in a Master Class. As previously announced, Oscar winner Roger Ross Williams has been named this year’s DocFest Guest of Honor. He will participate in two public talks, and he also has handpicked a selection of new documentaries to play in the festival, including Daughters, Sugarcane, and Stone Mountain (the latter film is a world premiere taking part in International Competition).\n\nIn all, Sheffield DocFest 2024 is presenting 48 World Premieres, 14 International Premieres, 17 European Premieres, and 29 U.K. premieres, originating from 56 countries of production. As previously announced, the festival will open on June 12 with the world premiere of Oscar winner Kevin Macdonald’s Klitschko: More than a Fight, about former heavyweight boxing world champion Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir. Vitali’s greatest challenge has come as mayor of Kyiv, protecting the Ukrainian capital in the face of brutal aggression from Russia.\n\nThis year’s festival theme is Reflections on Realities. Scroll for the full program.\n\n“In planning this year’s edition of DocFest,” said Annabel Grundy, Sheffield DocFest managing director, “we have reflected about where we can make a difference, how our programming can counteract false narratives and over simplification, and how we can support our ecosystem at a time when independent journalism, co-authored narratives and deeply reflective works are critical in helping us make sense of the world. I am deeply proud of the team who have created a careful, compassionate and balanced program always with the filmmakers in mind.”\n\nThe Sheffield DocFest 2024 lineup totals 109 films — 80 features and 29 shorts. Films screen in three competitive categories – International Competition, International First Feature Competition, and International Short Film Competition. The festival features additional strands: Rhythms focuses on music documentaries and performances; Debates “features films on wide-ranging important topics which need to be discussed”; People & Community includes stories that celebrate “togetherness through family, friendship and communities”; Journeys includes “transformations and explorations”; Memories explores “how the past informs the present”; and Rebellions focuses on stories of people “striving for social change and fighting for what matters.”\n\nRaul Niño Zambrano, Sheffield DocFest creative director, said in a statement, “Curating a program is a collaborative effort, and I am incredibly grateful for the dedication and commitment of our international advisers, consultants, and staff who have invested their time in assessing all the films, artworks, and talks. The selection we have made together serves as an invitation for reflection, dialogue and empathy, and we can’t wait to share all these stories with our international audience.”\n\nFULL PROGRAMME LISTINGS\n\nOpening Night Film\n\nKlitschko: More than a Fight – UK – Kevin Macdonald – 2024 (World Premiere) (International Competition)\n\nInternational CompetitionHonoring films that best display strong artistic vision and courageous storytelling.
