        "text": "Wilkie Arthur\n\nEagle Legal News Media\n\n#TurksandCaicos, August 7, 2024 – She was placed on remand until October 4, 2024. That date of her remand is also the date of her Sufficiency Hearing in the Supreme Court.\n\nShe will remain in custody until an application for her release on bail is made before the Supreme Court. Her attorney, senior defense counsel, Mr. Ashwood Forbes and junior assistant Ms. Seshedi Handfield is expected to file a Supreme Court bail application shortly.\n\nThe American woman is the third visitor to the Islands to face the Magistrate’s, Court on ammunition charges in less than week in Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands. Her court appearance was Tuesday August 6.\n\nThe single charge was read to 24 year old TIANA RENAY JONES by the learned Resident Magistrate, her honor Mrs. Oreika Selver-Gardiner alleging that she had with her two different rounds ammunition on Thursday August 1st, 2024 at the Howard Hamilton International Airport.\n\nShe allegedly possessed a 7.62 ammo of which is used in high-powered assault rifles such as an AK47 and/or a Draco firearms.\n\nThe office of the Director of Public Prosecution was represented by Mr. Clement Joseph, Principal Public Prosecutor and senior public prosecutor Mrs. Nayasha Hatmin.\n\nBefore court commenced, as we were sitting waiting on the Hon Resident Magistrate, the accused young lady who was released on police bail.\n\nFriday of last week (August 2) to return back to police station this morning was casually speaking to everyone in court before the Magistrate came in. She was asked a number of questions and answered them very openly. She was asked if she knew what type of gun the 7.62 bullet is used in, and with confidence and quick intelligence, she replied “yes” a Draco, and in AK47. The young lady appears and sounds to be very knowledgeable in the use of firearm in her home state.\n\nJones, the accused, said, “You only have to be of age with a registered ID in the state of Georgia to own or possess a firearm.”\n\nNASSAU, BAHAMAS – The Perry Institute for Marine Science (PIMS) celebrated a milestone last week with the successful conclusion of its 2024 Rising Tides program, an initiative that has rapidly become a beacon of hope for marine conservation in The Bahamas. This summer, the program certified five students as PADI Open Water Divers and four as Reef Rescue Divers. Additionally, two returning students advanced to the prestigious rank of Advanced Open Water Divers, further solidifying their commitment to marine stewardship.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Rising Tides Youth Program was conceived to inspire and equip young Bahamians with the knowledge and skills necessary for careers in marine science, environmental studies, conservation, and research. The program’s balanced curriculum of classroom instruction and field studies has proven to be a potent formula for success, attracting a growing number of aspiring marine biologists each year.\n\nTransformative Experiences Underwater\n\nThe 2024 cohort, under the expert guidance of PADI Dive Instructors and coral restoration specialists from the Reef Rescue Network, achieved significant milestones. These certifications are not mere accolades but pivotal steps that pave the way for future academic and professional opportunities in various fields, from commercial diving and coral science to PhD research and rescue diving.\n\n“I thoroughly enjoyed training the Rising Tides students in their Open Water, Reef Rescue Diver, and Advanced Open Water courses. Their enthusiasm and keen interest in marine life were truly inspiring,” said Kate Harrison, PIMS’ coral restoration specialist and PADI Course Director, a highly distinguished title held by only a few hundred professional divers worldwide. “Programs like these will undoubtedly have a lasting positive impact on The Bahamas.”\n\nVoices of the Future\n\nThe program’s impact is perhaps best expressed through the voices of its participants. Mateo, a 17-year-old student, said, “This program has opened my eyes to the incredible diversity and beauty of our marine ecosystems. It’s been an unforgettable experience, and I can’t wait to continue my journey in marine science.”\n\nSeraph Gomez, an 18-year-old with a passion for sustainable technology, reflected on his time in the program. He said: “Diving beneath the surface with Rising Tides has inspired me to use technology to preserve and protect our environment. It’s been a life-changing experience.”\n\nSerenity Russell, a 16-year-old with dreams of working in marine conservation, said: “I love the learning aspect because I’m being educated on topics I find interesting. I love experiencing new things and venturing out with our group, then sharing our experiences and findings.”\n\nAlicia Wilchombe, 16, who aspires to be a professional dive instructor, valued the sense of community fostered by the program. She said: “I love learning new things about people. It’s been so enriching to not only work with but also relax with the group. It feels like we’re all friends.”\n\nA Crucial Investment\n\nThe significance of the Rising Tides program extends far beyond the individual achievements of its participants. In a world where environmental challenges are escalating, the Perry Institute’s commitment to nurturing young conservationists is a critical investment in the future of The Bahamas’ marine ecosystems.\n\n“Through Rising Tides, we aim to move environmental conservation from a niche interest to a national responsibility,” said Danielle Cartwright, the Education Coordinator at PIMS. “Our marine ecosystems, our ‘blue economy,’ is our lifeblood. We need the next generation to become its stewards. Seeing the ‘Tiders’ grow and develop their skills has been incredibly rewarding.”\n\nDr. Karlisa Callwood, the Director of PIMS’ Community Conservation, Education, and Action (CCEA) program and creator of the Rising Tides program, echoed this sentiment. She said: “We provide these students with hands-on experience necessary to deeply understand the workings of Bahamian marine ecosystems and the role they can play as conservationists personally and in their communities.” The CCEA program works towards promoting conservation through enhanced community engagement, providing tools, training, and experience to help foster a greater conservation ethic across The Bahamas, while also building the next generation of Bahamian conservation leaders.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nAs the 2024 program draws to a close, the Perry Institute is already planning for the future. Recruitment for the next cohort of Rising Tides students will commence in January 2025, with details available on PIMS’ website and social media channels. Interested Bahamian students are encouraged to apply and join a growing community of young marine conservationists dedicated to safeguarding their natural heritage.\n\nPhoto Captions: Meet the leaders behind Rising Tides: Kate Harrison, distinguished PADI Course Director and coral restoration specialist; Dr. Karlisa Callwood, Director of PIMS’ Community Conservation, Education, and Action program; and Danielle Cartwright, Education Coordinator and head instructor.\n\nAbout the Perry Institute for Marine Science (PIMS)\n\nFor over 50 years, the Perry Institute for Marine Science (PIMS) has been at the forefront of marine research and conservation in The Bahamas and the Caribbean. Our mission is clear: leading through science, we innovate solutions, create opportunities, and inspire action to protect and restore ocean life for people and the planet. Our vision? Thriving seas and empowered communities.\n\nFrom our beginnings as the most productive marine lab and field station in the world on Lee Stocking Island, we’ve evolved into a global, program-based non-profit tackling critical issues such as coral reef restoration, fisheries conservation, and the protection of mangrove and coastal ecosystems. Our holistic approach integrates cutting-edge scientific research with community education and engagement, as well as international collaboration to make lasting impacts on marine environments.\n\nAt PIMS, we’re more than just scientists—we’re educators, advocates, and partners.

The event attracted over 450 delegates and facilitated more than 200 business meetings. The CIF brand is growing and we are excited by the partnerships established and the encouraging discussions held with development partners and other stakeholders.”\n\nDuring his opening speech, newly appointed Executive Director of Caribbean Export, Dr. Damie Sinanan, spoke of the trail of devastation left in the wake of Hurricane Beryl and how its aftermath further proves the importance of the conference’s priority areas.\n\n“With this one catastrophic event we have to ask ourselves some serious questions. Once again, how do we mitigate and adapt to those climatic impacts? How does this affect our ability to feed our people and how do our Caribbean people exploit opportunities presented by new technologies, innovation and connectivity to continue to do business in times of peril? That is why since 2022 Caribbean Export has championed these core areas and it is no different this year. We believe these areas portend the greatest potential for a transformative and resilient Caribbean region.”\n\nIn his wide-ranging keynote address detailing his vision for a transformed Caribbean, President of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, His Excellency Dr Mohamed Irfaan Ali, told the packed conference hall, “Sometimes we are captured by our own size, size of population and size of market but there is nothing bigger than an idea, than innovation, than driving ideas, that can change the narrative and position us as a region of excellence and that is what we have to do. We have to go after innovation that will position us as a region of excellence, and a region of excellence requires innovative thinking, it requires investing in a knowledge economy, investing in our human resources, building the right and strong partnerships. These are the things that matter.”\n\nThe president also highlighted his country’s investment landscape, stating “Guyana offers generous and favourable fiscal investment incentives. Guyana is an open foreign currency market with low inflation and a stable financial system. In every single sector, we have outlined the investment opportunities that exist here in Guyana.”\n\nOver the two days of high level discussions and presentations, delegates learned about investment and partnership opportunities that are addressing the region’s biggest challenges and promising transformative results.\n\nConference highlights included the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) reaffirming its commitment to the Caribbean and an announcement of US$28 million in funding to the Caribbean, including an extra US$1.45 million to expand the Economic Development Activator programme in Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. The announcement came on day two during the keynote address from USAID’s Deputy Administrator for Policy and Programming, Isobel Coleman, titled ‘Building Resilience Through De-risking: Unleashing Catalytic Capital and Public-Private Collaborations in the Caribbean’.\n\nRepresentatives from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), CAF Development Bank, Regional European Union Delegation from the Caribbean and others, also reaffirmed the commitment of their individual organisations to helping the region develop in the three priority areas. Delegates learned more about the EU’s Global Gateway Strategy, and the IDB’s One Caribbean strategy.\n\nThe first day of activities featured, among other things, a keynote fireside chat on Building Tomorrow: Harnessing the Power of Green featuring the Chairman of CAG, The Carlyle Group, Dr. Gerrard Bushell, as well as a CEO Leadership Roundtable titled Caribbean Titans Unite: Fueling Resilience Through Bold Investments featuring Vice President of Citi Environmental & Social Risk Management, Ryshelle McCadney; Managing Director of Farfan & Mendes Ltd, Andrew Mendes; COO – Caribbean Office (Ag.) of African Export-Import Bank, Okechukwu Ihejirika; and Director of Global Business Development of Global Integrated FinTech Solutions, Dave Sahadath.\n\nDuring the opening of the CIF 2024 Investment Village and Blitz, Advisor for Investment Promotion at the Caribbean Export Development Agency, Tonya Cummins, told attendees, “This initiative underscores our commitment to facilitating meaningful connections and fostering an ecosystem where investment can thrive. It is designed to not only highlight the projects but also to demonstrate the immense potential and readiness of the Caribbean to attract and sustain FDI…. Our goal is to create a robust environment that supports business growth, fosters innovation, and enhances the economic well-being of our member states.\n\nThe Investment Village featured an impressive array of private sector projects ranging from USD $500,000 to USD $16 million, collectively amounting to a total portfolio value of close to USD $50 million. The projects all fell under the sustainable agriculture and digital transformation thematic areas and included Project Kiem based in Suriname, Crazy About Organics Sustainable Farms based in the Dominican Republic, Transforming Caribbean Agriculture through Innovation and Sustainability based in St. Vincent & The Grenadines, HUBU Aquafarm Phase 2/3 Development based in Guyana, Prosperina Agtech based in The Bahamas, HealthApp Solutions based in Guyana, Orbtronics Innovation Hub based in St. Lucia and GUYIMEX International based in Guyana.\n\nDelegates also heard presentations from the Carib Equity and United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), EU funded projects.\n\nOn the final day of conference activities, Grenada’s Minister for Climate Resilience, the Environment and Renewable Energy Ministry for Climate Resilience, the Environment and Renewable Energy, Kerryne James, joined the conference virtually for a ministerial spotlight on Fostering Sustainable Development Through Innovative Investment Strategies in the Caribbean: Opportunities and Challenges.\n\nLater, delegates received a much anticipated update on the Ferry Project from His Excellency Ambassador Dr. Andre Thomas, Chairman & CEO of Pleion Group Inc, Parent Group of Connect Caribe. They also heard country presentations from investment agencies representing the Dominican Republic, Turks & Caicos, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, St. Kitts, Grenada, and Dominica, which were also well received.\n\nIn her closing remarks, Guyana’s Minister of Tourism, Industry and Commerce, Oneidge Walrond, described CIF 2024 as a resounding success.\n\n“The government of Guyana is fully aware of the importance of this forum for the sustainable development of our Caribbean region. CIF has once again provided a dedicated space for global and regional interactions, many of which we hope to evolve into long-lasting partnerships and business relationships,” she said."
