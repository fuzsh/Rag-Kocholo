        "text": "Sinclair Broadcasting found itself in the middle\n\nof controversy again last week after theLos Angeles Times\n\nrevealed the company's plans to air all or part of a\n\ndocumentary attacking presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry. The\n\nfilm, Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal,\n\ncharges that Kerry's protests against the Vietnam War in the 1970s were used by\n\nthe North Vietnamese to demoralize U.S. POWs. Amid the uproar, Democratic\n\nlawmakers called for an investigation by the Federal Election Commission and\n\ndemanded that the FCC investigate whether Sinclair, the largest station group\n\nin the country with 62 outlets, is meeting its public interest obligations.\n\nFormer FCC Chairman Reed Hundt and others called on the FCC to revive rules\n\nthat once let individuals respond to broadcast personal attacks. And media\n\nactivists threaten to challenge Sinclair TV licenses. But controversy is\n\nnothing new for Sinclair. The group was accused of pro-Bush bias in April, when\n\nits ABC affiliates dropped the edition of Nightline\n\nwith Ted Koppel's reading of the names of soldiers\n\nkilled in Iraq and Afghanistan.B&C's\n\nBill McConnell talked with Mark Hyman, Sinclair on-air editorialist and VP of\n\ncorporate relations, about the latest dust-up.\n\nYou had to have known there would be complaints\n\nthat you're unfairly attacking Kerry.\n\nFrankly, I'm a little disappointed that so many people assume the\n\nprogram would be entirely negative toward John Kerry. If he came on our\n\nprogram, he would have an opportunity to make a statement that could be very\n\nstatesmanlike and sway a lot of undecided people.\n\nYou can't blame people for perceiving political\n\nbias. Editorials you deliver on The Pointare\n\npro-Bush and support the war and are circulated to all Sinclair stations. Plus,\n\nSinclair previously ordered its ABC affiliates not to carry a\n\nNightlineepisode that could have made\n\nPresident Bush look bad.\n\nI haven't hidden that I'm conservative in my political beliefs. But\n\nnobody here had anything to do with this documentary. When it was offered to us\n\nwe spent 21/2 weeks vetting the people who made allegations. We didn't forge\n\nany documents or hire fake actors.\n\nOur motivation? It looked like a news exclusive, especially if John\n\nKerry sat down with us. If John Kerry comes in, it would be a huge get for us.\n\nHe hasn't done a sit-down interview with a real news organization—with\n\nanybody besides Dr. Phil, Regis and Kelly, and Jon Stewart—since the\n\nDemocratic Convention.\n\nAre you motivated by corporate interests? Kerry\n\nsays he'd like to roll back media consolidation. You're the biggest station\n\ngroup in terms of stations. He'd be a threat if he took the White\n\nHouse.\n\nSo we would put ourselves in his gunsight? Kerry spokesman Chad Clanton\n\ntold Fox News, \"They'd better hope we don't win.\"\n\nInitial press reports said you were planning to\n\nair the entire documentary and perhaps a panel discussion afterward. When did\n\nyou decide to do a news program on the film rather than air the whole\n\nthing?\n\nThat's always been the plan. If we had just wanted to air this by\n\nitself, we could have done it without anyone knowing about it until we aired\n\nit. We told Kerry before we produced anything that we wanted his participation,\n\nand we sent him a copy of the documentary. We were quietly waiting for his\n\ncampaign to get back to us and tell us what he wanted to do when the\n\nL.A. Timesstory appeared [about Sinclair's\n\nplans to air the documentary].\n\nYour critics say Kerry would give the documentary\n\ncredibility if he showed up to discuss it, so he won't accept the invitation,\n\nand that gives you a free pass to air a hatchet job.\n\nThat's absurd. One candidate would have veto authority over the news by\n\nrefusing to participate in a program. If it's news, it's news.\n\nIsn't this a de facto attack ad against Kerry? The\n\nDemocratic Party says this should really be treated as an illegal campaign\n\ncontribution to President Bush.\n\nUnder that standard, every single news report of bombings in Iraq or the\n\ndeath of a soldier or stories of economic performance that is weaker than\n\nexpected should be considered an in-kind contribution to John Kerry.\n\nBut why go with the documentary so close to the\n\nelection? It seems a blatant attempt to hurt Kerry.\n\nThese men did not tell their story until they came forward in August. We\n\nbelieve these are important and newsworthy allegations. According to the\n\nfilmmaker [Carlton Sherwood], none of the big broadcast networks wanted to\n\nspeak with him. That's why he went shopping for other venues. We did our due\n\ndiligence on his film and saw something to it.\n\nUnlike other documentaries that received widespread media coverage,\n\nthese allegations have gotten none. Michael Moore got three days on the\n\nTodayshow promoting Fahrenheit 9/11.\n\nMoore has his critics, and so does Carlton\n\nSherwood. Democratic Party Chairman Terry McAuliffe attacked Sherwood's\n\ncredibility, noting that he had been fired from a TV reporting job and from the\n\nconservative Washington Times. Critics note\n\nthat he wrote a book lauding the paper's owner, Rev. Sun Myung Moon, and that\n\nMoon has bought tens of thousands of copies of the book.\n\nIf they can't discredit the message then they go after the\n\nmessenger.\n\nAlmost every media outlet refers to him as a former\n\nWashington Times reporter. But most of his\n\ncareer was spent with Gannett and The Philadelphia\n\nInquirer. He's won a Pulitzer. He's worked for several stations and\n\nwon TV news awards. The shortest stop in his career was less than one year at\n\nthe Washington Times.\n\nHave you ever heard of a TV reporter who was never let go from some\n\nstation? It's kind of transient industry. We verified where he'd been and what\n\nhe'd done.\n\nMcAuliffe, indirectly, suggested you got paid to\n\nair the program, perhaps by a GOP backer.\n\nThat's also absurd. To my knowledge, we didn't pay anything for it\n\neither.\n\nDo threats of FEC complaints or license renewal\n\nproblems make you rethink plans to air the show?"
