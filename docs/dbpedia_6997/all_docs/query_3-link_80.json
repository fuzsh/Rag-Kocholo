        "text": "Part 1: Introduction\n\nIf your child would like to attend a world-class, private research university in a history-filled city on the East Coast, Boston University should be at the top of their list. Founded in 1839, Boston University offers over 300 academic programs, top undergraduate research opportunities, and prestigious global recognition.\n\nThe faculty, staff, and students of Boston University hail from 50 states and over 150 countries, but all share a common passion to pursue knowledge and embrace possibilities. Aligning with its international focus, BU provides more than 80 study abroad opportunities to its students, encouraging them to embrace other cultures and become global citizens.\n\nIn the classroom, BU students are taught by Nobel Prize winners, Guggenheim Fellows, Fulbright Scholars, and Sloan Research Fellows. With class sizes averaging only 30 students, undergraduates have opportunities to take active roles in their education and develop mentorships with their accomplished professors.\n\nOn any given day, Boston University students pursue their interests in courses like “Magic, Science, and Religion”—part of the general education curriculum known as the BU Hub. Outside of classes, students gather at many different spots around campus, including the Howard Thurman Center for Common Ground.\n\nWith over 450 student groups available, the sky’s the limit when it comes to engaging in the campus community—students can pursue anything from competing in broomball leagues to delivering art education to local students. And while there’s plenty to explore in the city, Boston University has many unique on-campus traditions for students to enjoy—such as Lobster Night and the BU Pumpkin Drop.\n\nAnd after Boston University? Graduates join an alumni network containing over 400,000 members spread throughout 180 different countries. Alumni hold positions in nearly every industry—you can find Boston Terriers in roles as magazine editors, state governors, Fortune 500 CEOs and CFOs, U.S. ambassadors, and award-winning actors and actresses. With a network this expansive to support them, it’s no surprise that 94 percent of Boston grads find employment or enroll in a graduate program within six months of earning their degree.\n\nBoston University is a premier educational institution that attracts over 80,000 applicants every year. With so many high-achieving students applying to BU, you understand why your child is eager to learn how to get into Boston University. Continue reading to discover the Boston University acceptance rate, the Boston University average GPA, and how your child can boost their BU admissions odds.\n\nBoston University rankings\n\nForbes: 48\n\nNiche: 38\n\nU.S. News & World Report: 43\n\nWall Street Journal/Times Higher Education: 42\n\nWhere is Boston University located?\n\nBoston University is located in the heart of—you guessed it—Boston, Massachusetts. This iconic city, known as “the birthplace of the American Revolution,” offers students the chance to revisit and appreciate our nation’s history. But Boston is unique for its duality—not only does it remind us of the past, but it also leads us into the future through innovation and education. With Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Boston University located within a few miles of each other, Boston is one of the premier research cities in the country.\n\nBoston boasts a number of special attractions that captivate tourists and locals alike—including the Freedom Trail, Fenway Park, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the JFK Presidential Library and Museum. Fortunately for students, Boston is a pedestrian- and bicyclist-friendly city that encourages exploration and adventuring—ensuring BU students never find themselves with a shortage of things to do.\n\nBoston University setting\n\nBoston University’s campus spans 169 acres along the Charles River, just slightly west of Boston’s city center. Just by walking to the edge of campus, students can take advantage of Boston's extensive public transportation system—known commonly as “the T.” After hopping on the subway, every attraction in Boston is easily within reach of this urban campus.\n\nWhile BU’s campus is relatively small, it is also historic and picturesque. It’s intentionally open to the city, encouraging students to make all of Boston their home. And the city of Boston certainly does not disappoint, offering students diverse cultures, spirited athletic pride, and unmatched local food to enjoy. (Boston baked beans, anyone?)\n\nSeveral big industries dominate Boston’s economic landscape, including finance, research and development, healthcare, education, publishing, and government. These industries offer BU students unparalleled opportunities for career development, internships, and networking. In fact, 84 percent of students complete at least one internship while at Boston University.\n\nBoston University student population\n\nUndergraduate population: 17,744 students\n\nGraduate population: 18,476 students\n\nBoston University acceptance rate\n\nBoston University’s acceptance rate for the class of 2027 is 10.7%. This means out of 80,495 applications, only 8,612 acceptances were sent out making BU a rather selective institution. For the final class, only 3,145 of these acceptances matriculated.\n\nBoston University early decision acceptance rate\n\nBoston University’s early decision acceptance rate is roughly 25% for the class of 2027. This includes both Early Decision I and Early Decision II applicants. In the end, applicants accepted through the early decision pool comprised 57% of the class.\n\nThe early decision acceptance rate for the incoming class of 2028 is 34.1%. This figure only takes the first round of early decision into account, but it is the most recent data available. There were 3,832 applicants and 1,307 accepted.\n\nBoston University transfer acceptance rate\n\nIn recent years, the Boston University transfer acceptance rate has hovered around 50%. For the Fall 2023 entrance, BU received 6,107 transfer applications; 840 of these applicants eventually matriculated.\n\nBoston University tuition and scholarships\n\nBoston University’s 2024–2025 cost of attendance (i.e., tuition, room, board, and fees) runs $90,207.\n\nHowever, BU promises to meet 100 percent of need for first-year students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Each year, $329.5 million is awarded in undergraduate financial aid, approximately 92 percent of which is need-based.\n\nThe average institutional grant totals $57,882.\n\nBoston University freshman retention rate\n\n94 percent of freshmen students continue on to their sophomore year at BU.\n\nWho gets into Boston University?\n\nBeyond knowing the Boston University acceptance rate, the best way for potential applicants to assess their odds of getting accepted is to look at the Boston University admissions statistics for the class of 2027, which reveal that applicants are at the top of their academic game and the competition to get accepted is strong.\n\nWhen viewing the test scores below, note that 59 percent of admitted students did not submit test scores.\n\n84 percent of admitted students rank in the top 10 percent of their high school class.\n\nAverage GPA: 3.9\n\nAverage GPA range: 3.8–4.0\n\nAverage ACT score: 33\n\nACT middle 50%: 30–34\n\nAverage SAT score: 1442\n\nSAT middle 50%: 1310-1500\n\nInternational students: 24%\n\nFirst-generation students: 21%\n\nAs of Fall 2023, the largest demographic represented among BU undergrads were white students (29.2%). The next largest racial groups found in the population were Asian Americans (18.1%), Hispanic Americans (12.8%), and Black or African Americans (9%). International students were not counted among these populations.\n\nThe most popular major areas among BU students are social sciences, business administration and management, communication and media studies, Biological and Biomedical Sciences, and engineering.\n\nPart 2: Boston University admissions requirements\n\nIf your child wants to know how to get into Boston University, a good place to start is by understanding the BU admissions requirements. To find their ideal students, the BU admissions committee closely evaluates applicants’ academics, test scores, and extracurriculars.\n\nBoston University academic requirements\n\nWith over 80,000 students competing for admission, Boston University has the luxury of selecting applicants with the strongest academic potential. In order to prove your child has what it takes to succeed in BU’s rigorous curriculum and elevate its reputation as a prosperous alumnus, they should take some of the most challenging courses offered at their high school—including dual-enrollment, honors, AP, and IB classes.\n\nYou might be wondering, what’s the “right” amount of challenging classes for your child to take? Surely, you don’t want them to be overwhelmed and earn poor grades or be forced to drop their meaningful extracurricular activities. There is a balance you should aim for—take the number of classes that will stretch your child to the limits of their ability without being more than they can handle.\n\nWhen choosing which challenging courses to pursue, your child should prioritize classes relating to their interests and potential career. If they want to go into a STEM field, they don’t need to overburden themselves with AP Literature or AP Spanish courses—unless of course, they have genuine interests in those areas. But in general, Boston would prefer to see AP Chemistry, AP Biology, or AP Calculus from a STEM applicant.\n\n(Suggested reading: IB vs AP: Which One Is Better for College Admissions?)\n\nBoston University testing requirements\n\nIn response to the many test cancellations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Boston University has adopted a temporary test-optional policy for students applying for Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 admission. If applicants were able to take the SAT or ACT exams and their scores accurately reflect their academic ability, they are encouraged to submit them. However, students will not be penalized if they choose not to include SAT or ACT scores with their application through Fall 2025 and Spring 2026.\n\nBecause the average Boston University SAT scores and ACT scores of admitted students are impressively high, we encourage students to take these exams more than once and to study hard in order to maximize their scores. Taking test prep courses or receiving one-on-one tutoring are typically successful methods for students to increase their scores and their admissions odds.\n\n(Suggested reading: What is a Good SAT Score? The Definitive Guide)\n\nBoston University extracurricular requirements\n\nWhile displaying strong academic skills is an important part of being a competitive BU applicant, high test scores and GPA alone aren’t enough to earn any student an offer of admission. As Boston University makes clear, what students do outside the classroom matters, too. Ideal BU students have ambition, take risks while pursuing their passions, and engage in meaningful community service.\n\nKeep in mind the Boston University community purpose—to pursue knowledge and embrace possibilities. Then consider how your child can display these values in their extracurricular activities. One of the most effective ways to achieve this aim is for your child to determine their biggest interest areas and explore them in unique, in-depth ways. We can use an example to illustrate this approach.\n\nImagine your child’s biggest passion is playing the violin. The best extracurricular strategy would be for them to pursue this passion through methods that display leadership, service, research, and creativity. To demonstrate leadership, your child could organize a small ensemble group of peers and perform at local events. Using a love of violin for service could be as simple as giving free violin lessons to younger students or performing at homes for the elderly. As a way to connect music with research, they could assist with a study examining the effect of music therapy on depression. And to be impressively creative, your child could compose original songs, either sharing them on YouTube or recording them into an EP and selling it online.\n\nJust imagine a Boston University admissions officer reading through this list of activities on your child’s application. They would be amazed at the level of initiative. Using this extracurricular approach will set your child apart from other applicants and improve their chances of getting into Boston University.\n\n(Suggested reading: Extracurricular Activities for College Admissions: The Ultimate Guide)\n\nBoston University application requirements\n\nIf your child has the academic statistics and extracurricular history to form a strong BU applicant profile, they might be ready to apply to Boston University. Here is a list of requirements for the BU application.\n\nA completed Common Application or QuestBridge Application\n\nHigh school transcript\n\nFirst-quarter senior grades\n\nCounselor recommendation and school report form\n\nOne teacher recommendation\n\nSAT or ACT scores (optional through Fall 2025/Spring 2026 admission)\n\nIf your child is applying to the School of Music in cello, double bass, flute, viola, piano, trombone, trumpet, violin, and voice, they are required to submit a pre-screening recording.\n\nIf your child is applying to the School of Theatre or School of Visual Arts, they must complete an audition, submit a portfolio, or both.\n\n(Suggested reading: How to Write an Amazing Common App Essay)\n\nPart 3: Applying to Boston University early decision vs. regular decision\n\nBoston University offers students three different admissions options to choose from, and in order to determine which is the best choice for your child, you must first understand the distinctions between them.\n\nBU Early Decision\n\nApplication deadline: November 1\n\nAdmissions notification: Mid December\n\nEnrollment deposit due: Early-Mid January\n\nIf accepted, students must enroll at Boston University and withdraw all their applications at other schools.\n\nBU Early Decision 2\n\nApplication deadline: January 4\n\nAdmissions notification: Mid February\n\nEnrollment deposit due: Late February\n\nIf accepted, students must enroll at Boston University and withdraw all their applications at other schools.\n\nBU Regular Decision\n\nApplication deadline: January 4\n\nAdmissions notification: Late March\n\nEnrollment deposit due: May 1\n\nIf accepted, students are not bound to attend Boston University. They are free to compare acceptances and financial aid offers from different schools.\n\nHow to know if your child should apply to BU early decision or regular decision?\n\nEarly decision is the right option for your child if Boston University is their absolute top choice, if they’ve had the opportunity to visit the campus or area, and if they can create the best version of their application prior to the November 1st deadline.\n\nHowever, if Boston is your child’s top choice but they haven’t visited campus yet or they need additional time to improve their application—with new test scores, improved senior grades, or better college essays—applying early decision 2 might be the better choice.\n\nFor both early decision and early decision 2 applicants, Boston is committed to meeting 100 percent of their demonstrated financial need. So while students with financial concerns typically hold off from applying early decision because they want to compare financial aid offers from multiple schools, BU applicants can be confident that if they’re accepted through early decision, they’ll be financially able to attend.\n\nIf your child is excited about Boston University but is also still considering other schools, they should apply regular decision, wait to receive multiple acceptances, and visit their top choices one final time in the spring before choosing which one to attend.\n\n(Suggested reading: Early Action vs. Early Decision: Pros and Cons and What Your Child Should Do)\n\nPart 4: 2024–2025 Boston University supplemental essays\n\nStrong college essays can provide the final push to persuade the Boston University admissions committee that your child deserves to attend. On the other hand, poorly-written essays may be the final straw that sends your child’s application to the reject or waitlist pile. With so much riding on these BU supplemental essays, let’s look at one of the two essay prompts for this year.\n\nBoston University is dedicated to our founding principles: “that higher education should be accessible to all and that research, scholarship, artistic creation, and professional practice should be conducted in the service of the wider community—local and international. These principles endure in the University’s insistence on the value of diversity in its tradition and standards of excellence and its dynamic engagement with the City of Boston and the world.” With this mission in mind, please respond to one of the following two questions in 300 words or less:\n\nQuestion #1: Reflect on a social or community issue that deeply resonates with you. Why is it important to you, and how have you been involved in addressing or raising awareness about it? (300 words)\n\nOr\n\nQuestion #2: What about being a student at BU most excites you? How do you hope to contribute to our campus community? (300 words)\n\n2: It’s a simple question that asks for an in-depth response. Your child’s answer to this “Why Boston?” essay prompt must be unique and impactful enough to help them stand out from the crowd. To do this, they’ll want to identify the two or three things they most love about Boston University and connect them to their background, accomplishments, or future goals.\n\nBefore we get to our sample Boston University essay, let’s define the kinds of topics that should and shouldn’t be included in your child’s response. While there are no wrong reasons for wanting to attend Boston University, there are certainly wrong things to write about in this “Why Boston?” essay.\n\nWhile BU’s prestige, location, and weather are valid reasons to love it, they don’t deserve a spot in this college essay. The Boston University admissions committee wants to see in-depth knowledge and passionate enthusiasm from BU applicants. If your child doesn’t possess that yet, they’ll need to do some research to find a few truly unique things about BU they can be excited about.\n\nImpressive Boston University essays might focus on one or two of the following reasons for attending BU:\n\nA specific academic interest, such as the Kilachand Honors College\n\nA specific research lab, researcher, or study\n\nA specific extracurricular interest, such as leadership, volunteer, or creative opportunities\n\nA specific experience or defining moment from a campus visit\n\nIf you haven’t noticed, the more specific applicants are in their BU essay, the more memorable and effective their essay will be.\n\nHere’s a sample Boston University essay.\n\nPart 5: Frequently asked questions\n\nWhat GPA is needed to get into Boston University?\n\nWe often get this question from students and parents who want the complicated and varied admissions process to be simplified into a score to reach which will guarantee acceptance. Unfortunately, it’s not quite that simple.\n\nWhile a high GPA marks the majority of BU’s acceptees, it’s not the only measure of a quality candidate. BU will look closely at essays, extracurriculars, letters of recommendation, and other aspects of your child’s application when making admissions decisions. That said, the typical average GPA among acceptees is in the 3.8–4.0 range.\n\nIs BC or BU harder to get into?\n\nThe acceptance rate of Boston College is historically higher than Boston University making it generally harder to get into Boston University based solely on this metric. As we mentioned above, in 2023 Boston University’s acceptance rate was 10.7% while Boston College’s acceptance rate came in at 15%.\n\nBut this is not the only measure of difficulty to entry. It’s important to remember that acceptance rates change annually, so checking the most recent data for the school you’re applying to will give you the best idea of your chances.\n\nFurthermore, each school has specific strengths and weaknesses in addition to particular programs that may be a better fit for you. Your individual academic profile and extracurriculars may make one or the other easier for you to get into based on these factors. Both Boston University and Boston College utilize a holistic review process when making admissions decisions, so while your GPA is incredibly important, it’s not their only consideration.\n\nWhat does BU look for in applicants?\n\nWhile it’s a given that Boston University looks for academically gifted students, they also consider the entirety of a student’s application. As mentioned above, their holistic review process ensures that other aspects of an applicant’s profile are just as important.\n\nYour child will want to make sure their GPA is at least near or matching the average GPAs of acceptees to have their best chance at entry. This was in the 3.8–4.0 range in the most recent application year.\n\nAdditionally, BU will look for rigorous or challenging courses on your child’s application. Has your child taken AP or IB courses and received stellar grades? This will help them to stand out.\n\nFurthermore, your child’s extracurricular activities are extremely important. BU typically wants to see depth and dedication to a few activities rather than a wide variety of interests that only last a semester or two.\n\nFinally, BU will be examining your child’s essays for fit with their values and program offerings in addition to compelling writing skills. They’ll want to ensure that this is communicated well as this will show the admissions committee your child has researched their school and specific reasons for wanting to attend BU beyond merely wishing to be accepted into a top-tier school."
