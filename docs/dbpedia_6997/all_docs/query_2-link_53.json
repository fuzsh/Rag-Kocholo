I used their services to improve my language skills.\"\n\nAlexis Nordling\n\n\"DCTC offers opportunities and academic challenges to everyone, even non-traditional students like me. I never thought I could go back to school, but since attending DCTC, I've seen the faculty and staff's amazing commitment to expanding access to continued learning.\""
