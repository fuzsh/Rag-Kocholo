        "text": "The College of Liberal Arts is located in 31 buildings of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, primarily on the east and west banks of the Minneapolis campus.\n\nFrom our new student advising center in Johnston Hall to the world-class studios of the Regis Center for Art, from the old-world charm of Folwell Hall to glass-clad Hanson Hall, we are proud of our student-centric buildings and the educational mission they support.\n\nOur location in the center of the Twin Cities offers students countless opportunities to supplement their classroom experiences with internships at Fortune 500 companies, exposure to world-class arts, and engagement with nonprofits large and small.\n\nCrossing the Mississippi River, our campus is a mere 11-minute bus ride to the heart of downtown Minneapolis, and light rail connects us to the Minnesota State Capitol and downtown St. Paul. Fantastic business, residential, and entertainment areas are easy to find by foot, bike, or bus. In short, this is a fun and opportunity-rich place to live, work, and go to school.\n\nCampus Visits for Future Students"
