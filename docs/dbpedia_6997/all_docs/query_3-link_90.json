        "text": "The SAT is a college entrance exam measuring academic proficiency in math, reading, and writing. Scored on a scale of 400 to 1600, a 1600 is considered a perfect score on the SAT. Clocking in at only 300 points shy of the highest available score, a 1300 demonstrates that you ranked in the upper echelon of all students who took the exam and answered a large majority of questions correctly.\n\nIs a 1300 Sat Score (87th Percentile) Good?\n\nYes. A 1300 on the SAT indicates good performance in all sections of the exam and places you around the 87th percentile of all test takers, meaning you scored higher than 87% of all test takers.\n\nA score of 1300 makes it possible to apply to just about every college and university in the country and be competitive for admission at the vast majority, including a number of selective schools. One of the goals of taking the SAT is to open up a large number of college options to choose from, a 1300 is very effective with this objective in mind.\n\nWhat Colleges Can I Get Into With An SAT Score of 1300?\n\nWith a 1300 SAT score, you can competitively apply at a majority of colleges, so you can be choosy about where you spend the next 4-years. Schedule a meeting with your college counselor and ask them to suggest a list of schools that might be a good fit based on your social and academic needs. In addition, supplement this information by attending sessions with visiting admissions officers from those schools to get to know them better.\n\nIf you already have a list of 7 to 10 colleges that you’re interested in, check the commonly accepted SAT scores. Institutions typically provide two numbers, the 25th and 75th percentiles. If your score falls at, near, or above their 75th percentile, you’re in great shape and are likely a competitive applicant at the college or university. If this is the case, keep up with your classes and focus on maintaining your GPA.\n\nShould I Retake The SAT With a 1300 Score?\n\nThe only reason to consider retaking the SAT after earning a 1300 score is if you have your sights set on a very selective or elite school, such as those in the Ivy League. The 25th percentile for these institutions hovers around 1390, which means you may fall short as a competitive candidate. The good news is that you’re close to being eligible. Schedule a test date 4 to 6 weeks out and utilize free SAT prep resources online, pick up a test prep book, or even consider hiring a tutor if it’s an option. The goal for a competitive Ivy League application is 1540.\n\nDepending on where you are in your senior year, it will likely be difficult to retake the SAT with enough time to study, take the test, and receive your score before college application season starts. The good news is that a 1300 is a great score and makes you a competitive candidate at many colleges and universities. Concentrate on all other aspects of your application, your personal statement, recommendations, and GPA, with the goal of making them as strong as your SAT score.\n\n1300 SAT to ACT Equivalent\n\nEarning a 1300 on the SAT is equivalent to earning a 27 on the ACT. Colleges and universities don’t have a preference for one standardized test over the other, nor is one test harder than the other. Simply put, they’re just a bit different and depending on what type of test taker you are, you may ultimately do a bit better on one over the other.\n\nFor instance, the ACT asks you to solve more complex mathematical problems, but the SAT has a no-calculator portion, which may prove more difficult for some. On the other hand, the SAT requires line citations in the Reading portion, while the ACT tests graph and chart reading skills in the “science” section.\n\nOne of the most distinct differences between the tests, however, is the actual taking of the test — time. The ACT has a very demanding time limit, often asking takers to complete more problems than there are minutes. The SAT has a bit more wiggle room if you get stuck on a problem.\n\nScholarships for a 1300 SAT Score?\n\nMore likely than not, your potential college or university should offer a significant amount of merit aid for your 1300 SAT score, but you should also apply for as many scholarships from other organizations, business, and individuals as possible. Beyond the cost of tuition is the price for books, housing, meal plans, possibly car maintenance or public transportation, and more, so get applying!\n\nView All Scholarships\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs a 1300 a good SAT score?\n\nThe average composite SAT score is 1059, and the highest possible score is 1600, putting 1300 above average and competitive. A 1300 SAT score allows you to apply competitively to a large number of schools, making it an objectively good score for most students.\n\nWhat colleges can I get into with a 1300 SAT score?\n\nYou can apply competitively to a good number of colleges with a 1300 SAT score. Among the many you consider, you may want to look at Pennsylvania State University, Syracuse University, and University of Georgia, all of which accept students with an average composite SAT score near 1300.\n\nWhat percentile is a 1300 SAT score?\n\nA 1300 SAT score puts you at the 87th percentile, meaning you scored higher than 87% of all other test takers.\n\nWhat is the ACT equivalent of a 1300 SAT score?\n\nEarning a 1300 on the SAT is equivalent to earning a score of 27 on the ACT.\n\nWhat scholarships can you get with a 1300 SAT score?\n\nYou’re eligible to apply for a majority of merit-based scholarships requiring an SAT score. It’s best to start applying to scholarships as early as possible so you can build up some funds to help with the cost of not only college tuition, but also books, housing, meal plans, and more."
