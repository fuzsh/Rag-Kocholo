I knew I wanted to study someplace that was safe, smaller and peaceful. I joined the History Club, the International Club, and the Asian Culture Club. Every day was different, and every day was memorable!”\n\n“I plan to go into the medical field, but those programs require such big loans. The HartLand Promise brought that cost down so far that I don’t need to take out loans for my undergraduate degree.”"
