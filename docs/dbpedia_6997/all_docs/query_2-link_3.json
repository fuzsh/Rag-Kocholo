        "text": "Located in Richmond, Indiana, on the border of Ohio, IU East is a small, welcoming commuter campus that offers a flexible mix of on-campus and online classes to meet your needs and fit your schedule.\n\nAt IU East, students have the complete packageâ€”a regional campus with more than 60 academic programs, research opportunities, student leadership and employment, service learning, internships, and a full range of support programs. About 80 percent of IU East students work at least half-time, so the flexibility of online classes goes a long way to helping students complete their degrees on time. Student support services, including math and writing help, supplemental instruction, and success coaching, are available both on campus and online.\n\nSee IU East news\n\nFind out about IU East events"
