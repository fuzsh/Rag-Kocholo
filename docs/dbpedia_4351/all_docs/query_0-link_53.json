        "text": "©2009 Kathryn Gearhart (No portion of this web site may be reproduced, in any form, including Internet, electronic or print, in whole or in part.)\n\nHistorical Background\n\nIn A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 it is noted before the Norman Conquest, Manchester was one of the dependencies of the royal manor of Salford, Salford Hundred. Around 1086 it became the property of the Grelley family, which held it until it passed to the de la Warre family. Upon the death of Thomas, Lord de la Warre, in 1426 the property passed to Thomas, Lord West. Thomas West, Baron de la Warre, married Cecilia, daughter of Sir Thomas Shirley in 1596. West was the proprietor of the Virginia Company and first governor of Virginia. It should be noted that the township of Salford was developed first and in the beginning of the development of the area was more significant and larger than Manchester.\n\nIn 1579 the manor of Manchester and its dependencies were sold for £3,000 by Thomas West to John Lacy, citizen and cloth worker of London. In 1596 Lacy sold Manchester to Nicholas Mosley, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1599. Mosely and his brother were involved in the business of woolen manufacture at a time when Manchester was the major center for this enterprise. Nicholas moved to London to handle trade in the city and arrange export agreements for his company. He became an Alderman to several London wards, and was made Lord Mayor in 1599. He successfully raised money for Queen Elizabeth’s navy to defend against the Spanish Armada. He arranged to supply soldiers, provisions and munitions to support the campaign of Lord Essex in Ireland. At 72 he was knighted by the Queen. Mosley (Moseley) built Hough End Hall in Manchester, and Ancoats Hall in Manchester was their family seat. The will of Sir Nicholas Mosley, filed in 1612, was witnessed at Didbury by Robert Gee, Lawrence Crowder, Robert Barlow, and William Harrison. It may be that this is the same Robert Gee, of Derbyshire, who was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1606, receiving his BA in 1609-10 and was P.C. of Kingsley, Staffordshire in 1609.\n\nThe manor of Peover (pee-ver) Hall was held by the Mainwarings (pronounced Mannering), and the Hall was built by Sir Randle (Randell) Mainwaring in 1585. The Mainwarings included a number of lords, knights, and sheriffs of Chester. They owned several Cheshire townships.\n\nFlemish weavers, bringing their Protestant beliefs with them, settled in Salford and Manchester in the fourteenth century. They produced wool and linen, beginning the tradition of cloth manufacturing in the region. By the time of Henry VIII and the reformation, Manchester was an important trade and manufacturing center. Textile trade included commerce with Ireland and London. Lancastrians, especially men from Manchester and its surrounding region, became active in the textile trade by the early 16th century. Families with business ties frequently intermarried.\n\nFustian is a stout fabric of cotton and flax, or cotton and low-quality wool. The original medieval fustian was a stout but respectable cloth with cotton weft and linen warp, originally woven in El-Fustat near Cairo. Before the 1580’s most fustian was imported. They were known by their place of origin, with the earliest coming from Italy. Naples Fustian had many interesting name variations including ffusty apes. Milan Fustian was the best quality, but by 1660 it was seldom imported to England. Genoa Fustian, called Jean Fustian, was of much lower quality. Jean Fustian was dyed, unlike Milan Fustian. Russet was a frequent color. As with Milan Fustian, Jean Fustian seems to have disappeared in England about 1660. Fustian of Naples was different. It had two piles, one sorter than the other. German and Dutch fustians were produced by the sixteenth century and were commonly stocked in English shops. British fustian manufacture began before the end of the sixteenth century. In 1590 Giles Warren attracted weavers from London to make fustians in Ireland. The center for fustian manufacture quickly became Manchester, particularly Bolton. Stocks of ready-made garments included coats, frocks and waistcoats of fustian. It was the favorite cloth for outer wear, especially among working class people. In 1655, the will of John Gee, Fustian Maker of Middleton, Lancashire was filed.\n\nThe Leet Court met twice a year, in October and at Easter. In 1552, elected officials were the borough-reeve (bailiff), catchpoll (bailiff’s assistant), two constables, market-lookers for corn, for fish and flesh and for white meat; mise-layers (assessed and collected fees), and gatherers, sealers of leather, ale-conners, burleymen and scavengers for different portions of the town, assayers and appraisers; fifty-nine officials in all. A swineherd was appointed in 1567; a beadle for rogues (usher or one who keeps order at church) appears in 1573. In 1578 officers for wholesome bread, for fruit, for the conduit, for seeing the orders about ales and weddings were being executed, and for seeing that hats and caps were used on Sundays and holy days were appointed. As the borough grew concerns with sanitation and order dominated the official business. Among the neighboring gentry that held borages and lands in the township of Manchester were the Gees.\n\nWriting in 1581, William Camden described Manchester in these terms: Manchester, on the south side of the Irwell River, standeth in Salfordshire, and is the fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire; yet is in it [but] one parish church, but is a college (not yet a cathedral), and almost throughout double-aisled …. There be divers stone bridges in the town, but the best, of three arches, is over Irwell. This bridge divideth Manchester from Salford, the which is a large suburb to Manchester. On this bridge is a pretty little chapel…. Without the town, beneath on the same side of Irwell, yet be seen the dykes and foundations of Old Mancastel in a ground now enclosed. The stones of the ruins of this castle were translated towards making of bridges for the town.\n\nManchester Cathedral recorded the births and marriages of most of the residents in the parish, even when a closer chapel existed. This was because the Cathedral held a virtual monopoly on these sacraments. If a couple wished to be married in their local chapel, or have a baby baptized, they incurred a double fee, one for the chapel and one for the Cathedral where they were required by law to record these events. In addition, in the case of Stretford’s chapel, most burials occurred in Manchester, because the burial ground around the chapel did not have proper drainage. Most often the clerk would record the place of origin when recording information for individuals who did not live in the city, but this was not always done. It becomes clear that residents of Stretford were often recorded in Manchester but not noted as residents of Stretford. The infamous Dr. John Dee was for a period the warden of Manchester. He was involved in many quarrels with the members. Mr. Ralph Kyrke, one of the chaplains at the time, was accused of omitting prayers commanded by the Book of Common Prayer, and inventing his own instead. He was also accused of not making the sign of the cross during Baptism, not having godparents during christening. Kyrke would not allow ..Parishioners who had helped the Parish Clerk to read verse for verse with the Curate for fourtie years last paste and more, in the Morning Service, so to do, but openly commanded them to hold their peace. Mr. Kyrke died from the plague in 1605. Manchester lost one thousand from their parish to plague in 1605. That was a significant reduction in the population and it is likely not all deaths were noted.\n\n17th Century Manchester\n\nThe chapels existing in 1650 serve to indicate the chief centers of population—Blackley, Newton, Gorton, Denton, Birch, Didsbury, Chorlton, Stretford, and Salford. In 1650 the dwellings were scattered manor and farmhouses and small villages. The rural population probably then, as later, combined tillage with weaving. The trade in Manchester in 1641 was described as:\n\nThe town of Manchester buys the linen yarn of the Irish in great quantity, and weaving it returns the same again to Ireland to sell. Neither doth her industry rest here, for they buy cotton wool in London, that comes first from Cyprus and Smyrna, and work the same into fustians, vermilions, dimities, etc., which they return to London, where they are sold; and from thence not seldom are sent into such foreign parts where the first materials may be more easily had for that manufacture.\n\nA complaint made in 1676 shows the difficulties caused by increasing trade in the narrow streets. On market days, it was alleged, during the corn market at the conduit people could not pass with coach or cart or horses from Marketstead Lane to Smithy Door, which was the best way from Stockport and Ashton on one side, to Bolton, Preston, and Warrington on the other. Lest therefore the corn market should suffer, the borough-reeve was requested to remove the dealers in crockery, wooden vessels, fruit, etc. to Hanging Ditch, and to move the butchers, who had stalls at the south side of the conduit, to the place thus cleared at its north side; thereby the corn dealers would obtain the additional room they needed.\n\nDuring the English Civil War, Manchester stood with Parliament, however the Earl of Derby, Lord Strange, tried to secure the city for King Charles I. Lord Derby assembled from 2,500 to 4,200 troops at Bury, and on September 14th 1642 proposed to take Manchester. The citizens and their neighbors, rallied to the call by the Parliamentary Commissioners for a militia. Lord Derby placed ordinance on the two main roads into Manchester, at Salford Bridge, and Alport Lodge. The townsmen had set up blockades of mud walls at the ends of streets and rubble to keep out horsemen. After laying siege for a week, Lord Derby was ordered to withdraw and come to the aid of the king. The Mosleys and Prestwiches sided with the king, but the remainder of the gentry and countryside were aligned with Parliament and the puritan cause because most of the ministers in the chapels in the countryside were of the Puritan persuasion.\n\nIn 1641 the men over 18 years gathered in the townships and hamlets in Lancashire and Cheshire to take what is called the Protestation Oath after the fall of Charles I and rise of Cromwell. The Parliament declared: The High Sheriff and the Justices of the Peace of that County to meet together in one Place, as soon as possible you may, and there to take the Protestation yourselves, and then, dispersing yourselves into your several Divisions, that you will call together the Minister, the Constables, Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of every Parish, and tender unto them the Protestation, to be taken in your presence, and to desire of them that they will very speedily call together the Inhabitants of their several Parishes, both Householders and others, being of Eighteen Years of age and upwards, into One or more Places, according to the largeness of their Parishes, and to tender unto them the same Protestation, to be taken in their Presence, and to take their names, both of those that do take it, and do refuse to take the same Protestation; and to return them to yourselves.\n\nThe oath read: I, ___,do in the presence of Almighty God, promise, vow and protest to maintain and defend, as far as lawfully I may, with my Life, Power and Estate the true Reformed Protestant Religion, expressed in the Doctrine of the Church of England, against all Popery and Popish Innovations within this Realm, contrary to the same Doctrine and according to the duty of my Allegiance, His Majesty’s Royal, Person, Honour and Estate, as also the Power and Privileges of Parliaments, the lawful Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, and every person that maketh this Protestation, in whatsoever he shall do in the lawful Pursuance of the same; and to my power, and as far as lawfully I may, I will oppose and byall good Ways and Means endeavour to bring to condign Punishment all such as shal, either by Force, Practice Counsels, Plots, Conspiracies, or otherwise, do any Thing to the contrary of any Thing in this present Protestation contained; and further, that I shall in all just and honourable Ways, endeavour to preserve the Union and Peace betwixt the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland: and neither for Hope, Fear, nor any other Respect, shall relinquish this Promise, Vow and Protestation.\n\nA brief explanation of some of the terms is helpful. The Church of England was Protestant, with heads at York and Canterbury. There was a Common Book of Prayer and articles of faith that governed the liturgy. Charles I wished to formalize the church and was accused of trying to return to Catholicism. He attempted to force change on the Scots who were Presbyterian Covenanters. He was defeated. In Parliament, there sat many men of Puritan and Presbyterian persuasion. There were also those who were termed Separatists. These did not believe that the Church of England could be reformed, but chose to go their own way, to be nonconformists, and met in their own churches. These were to become the Pilgrims. The Puritan wanted strict religious discipline, a simplified ceremony and creed for the Church of England. So, one could be ordained by the Church of England and serve as a minister in one of their chapels or parishes churches, and still believe in a puritan persuasion. This was the Nonseparatist.\n\nThe presence of Flemish Protestants and trade with London may have resulted in the spread of Puritanism and nonconformity in the region. After the Reformation, Manchester evolved into a Protestant stronghold, surrounded in Lancashire by a Catholic countryside that was effectively ignored until the Civil War. In contrast Chester was a Royalist stronghold, and the environs of Cheshire nearest Manchester, such as Stockport, were Parliamentarian.\n\nManchester was regarded as a Roundhead Parliamentary stronghold. Charles Worsley the son of a wealthy merchant of Manchester, and a Gee descendent, quickly rose to power under Cromwell. He made a fortune prosecuting Royalists in Lancashire and purchasing confiscated estates. Cheshire, Lancashire and North Staffordshire were governed by Charles Worsley. He was ruthless in his campaign to bring about godly reformation in his region. Eventually even Parliamentarians in the region rebelled. Their efforts were quickly put down and the leaders were executed.\n\nGee Residents of Manchester Parish and Salford Hundred\n\nThe earliest prosperous residents of Manchester Parish were Charles, Henry, John, William and Thomas, who were probably cousins. Charles was a priest. Henry and John were evidently brothers. Henry, a property owner in Manchester, went to Chester where he acquired great wealth and position. He was the father of Edmund of Liverpool and Roundel (Randall) of Cheshire. John resided in Manchester and was the father of John, Henry, Edward, Thomas and Raphe (Rauffe or Ralph) of Manchester, and he came from Stretford and owned property in Salford Township. Thomas lived in Broughton Hamlet very near the Township of Salford. His sons were Thomas, and grandsons were Richard, Thomas, Roger, John and William. They resided in Salford and nearby Barton Upon Irewell (Eccles). William appears to have been residing in Stretford and his sons were Richard, James, John, William and Thomas of Stretford. It seems likely that descendents from Stretford also may have lived in Barton. Other descendents were in Macclesfield Hundred in Cheshire.\n\nMy approach to analyzing the data has been to keep in mind the low population figures for hamlets and townships even into the early 19th century, and to assume that people moved infrequently, particularly if they owned land or held a copyhold which were multigenerational leases. I have also worked under the assumption that sponsoring aristocracy was likely to facilitate movement between manor houses or estates, and that commerce was also the motivation for relocating, particularly to London. Consider what follows as a jumping off point for further investigation. This is all taken from secondary sources and for this reason I am certain there are errors in associations and information. The lack of sound secondary information has been a roadblock. Even as I write this I know registers which would shed light on the family kinship are being transcribed. Of particular interest is Sacred Trinity of Salford.\n\nThe Salford Hundred Tax list inventories the heads of households who were economically better off, being landed yeomen farmers, tradesmen, or merchants.\n\nSalford Hundred Tax List\n\n1524\n\nManchester Parish: Henry Gee, Thomas Gee\n\n1543\n\nManchester Parish: John Gee and Widow of William Gee\n\nBroughton Hamlet, Salford: Widow of Thomas Gee\n\n1563\n\nRichard Gee and Widow of John Gee\n\n1600\n\nJohn Gee, in lands\n\nCharles Gee, priest, was noted in 1514. He likely was born before 1480 and remained in Manchester and Stretford until 1557/8. He was provided a living by Sr. Edmund Trafforde, Knight. The Gee family would continue to be associated with the land controlled by the Trafford family for generations to come.\n\nCharles Gee, Priest 14?? – 1558+\n\nIn the Chetham Society publications, volume 59 0.5 of the records of Manchester is this reference to Charles Gee, priest: In 1514 Charles Gee, clerk to the chantry of St. Nicholas in Manchester… upon the resignation of Henry Ryle, until he resigned in 1542 as noted: Henry Ryle to the perpetual Chantry at the Altar of St. Nicholas in the Collegiate Church at Manchester, vacant by the resignation of Charles Gee, prieste incumbent ther of the ffoundacon of Sr. Edmund Trafforde Knight to celebrate ther for the sowlez of his ancestors and the saide prieste shewyth no compasicon in writinge. (compascicon = deeds to chapel property)\n\nIn 1547 ‘D’n’s Carolus Gee’ answeredBishop Bird’s visitation ‘Call’ and was at Stretford in 1557-8…. Charles resigned from Manchester and was at Stretford from 1547 to 1557, and perhaps later, although this was during the period when Henry VIII took Catholic lands.\n\nOne hundred years later another list enumerates the adult men in Lancashire. In 1641-1642 Parliament ordered all males over 18 years of age to take an oath of loyalty to the crown and the Protestant religion. It was an attempt to identify Catholics and Royalists. It is referred to as The Harmonious Accord or the Protestation. It is the most complete list of adult males in Lancashire before 1700.\n\nThe Protestation List of 1641-1642, Lancashire\n\nManchester Parish Ashton-Under-Lyne Parish Stretford Township Audenshawe Township John, Gyles, Lamuell,John and John Henry, John and Richard Manchester Township Middleton Parish George, Mr. Edmund,Joseph, Sanctus Thornham Township Chorlton Township John Nathaniel, Joseph and Jonathan Bury Parish Salford Township Bury Township Robert James Newton Township Bolton le Moors Parish Robert Bolton Township Flixton Parish Edmund and Thomas Flixton Township Eccles Parish Thomas and Ralph Thomas, Lawrence, John,William,Thomas and Gyles Winwich Parish Eccleston Parish Kenion Township Eccleston Township William and John Edward, minister\n\nHenry Gee born before 1480 d. 1540\n\nChester, Cheshire\n\n~\n\n1524 Manchester Parish, Salford Hundred Tax List\n\nAs noted above in Henry Gee, Mayor of Chester, Henry Gee was appointed in 1501 to receive the rents for the maintenance of the chantry of St. George, in Manchester, established by Robert Cheetham in 1501 along with James Shalcross. This appointment was confirmed in 1523 by the will of Cheetham’s widow. Henry is noted in 1524 with Thomas Gee in the Salford Tax List. This is most certainly the same Henry Gee who was Sheriff in Chester 1527. Henry died in 1540. His son Edmund (Edward) died in 1550.\n\nHenry Gee of Chester was probably the brother of John Gee of Manchester. The property which Henry Gee of Chester bequeathed to his daughter Elizabeth was eventually inherited by Henry Gee a son of the John Gee, noted in the Salford Tax list in 1543.\n\nJohn Gee of Stretford, Manchester,\n\nand Salford: died 1559\n\n~\n\n1543 Manchester Parish, Salford Hundred Tax List\n\nJohn Gee appears often in the mid 16th century records of the Leet Court at Manchester and is noted in 1543 in the Salford Hundred Tax list. He was also noted in 1547 in Stretford, where he was a tenant of Sir Edmunde Trafford. John gave testimony that he was 60 years of age in 1543, placing his birth in 1480, and a tenant of Sir Edmunde Trafford in Stretford. He was at the time a tenant of Sir Edmonde. Later the descendent of Sir Edmonde would sue John’s grandson for a return of the property, which, evidently was sublet to others. The suit coincided with the death of John’s son, John Gee, and likely indicates that it was a copyhold for several generations, which expired when the last holder died. John was married to Elizabeth and their children were John, Henry, Edwarde, Thomas, Raphe and Francis Gee, Alyse Pendleton, Ann Attersbye, and Elizabeth Bispham.\n\nIn 1552 John was elected as a juror for the Court Leet. Also serving that year was Richard Shalcross. In 1557 he was told to ditch from Alportstead between Alporte Park and lands of John Tetlowe. In 1559, Robert Raulyson was ordered to remove the swine coote (pen) he had built from in front of the house of John Gee, in the Deansgate, and insure “no more such thing to be there” as it interfered with the passing of others on the street. It was in that same year that John died and his wife, Elizabeth Gee, came into court in 1559 to testify that John her eldest son had been granted all her lands in Manchester and Salford. He was probably born before 1532, making him at least 14 years in 1559, a lawful age.\n\nElizabeth was noted in the Salford Tax list in 1563 as the widow of John and her death was recorded in the Manchester Register in March 1588, just three months after the death of her son John.\n\nThe Children of John Gee d. 1559:\n\nThe children were: Henry, Edwarde, John, Thomas, Raphe (Ralphe Rauffe) and Francis Gee, and daughters Alyse Pendleton, Ann Attersbye, and Elizabeth Bispham. The descendents of Thomas and Edwarde resided in Macclesfield Hundred and are detailed in the section covering that area of Cheshire.\n\nAlyse Gee Pendleton (John d. 1559)\n\nIt is through the will of Alyse Gee that we learn of the family of John and Elizabeth Gee. Alyse married George Pendleton. Their daughter was Cecily Pendleton who married John Croxton.\n\nThe will of Alyse Pendleton was written in 1588 and proved in 1591. She includes two maidservants among her beneficiaries, and clearly was a lady of substance, leaving many monetary gifts and valuable items.\n\nHer will also lists many members of her family. The will identified her brethren (brothers) as John, Henry, Edwarde, Thomas, Raphe and Francis Gee. Her will identified Elizabeth Bispham and Anne Attersbye as sisters. She named her mother, Elizabeth. Finally, Alyse listed nieces and nephews: John’s son John; Edward’s son Raphe and daughter Alyce; Henry’s sons Edward, Henry, and daughters Elizabeth, and Margret. She leaves a gift to the wife of Thomas Gee. The will of George Pendleton was made in 1585 and he appointed his brother in law Henry Gee to supervise his will.\n\nThe children of Cecily Pendleton and John Croxton were George, Geoffrey, Susanna and Alice Croxton. One of their grandsons, Thomas Croxton of Ravencroft, would become the Governor of Chester, and a Colonel in the service of Parliament. Cecilie’s second husband was Robert Mainwaring, a younger son of Henry Mainwaring, Esquire, of Carincham, Chester.\n\nEdward and Thomas Gee\n\nof Macclesfield Hundred (John d. 1559)\n\nEdward and Thomas appear to have relocated to the estate of the Leigh family in Cheshire’s Macclesfield Hundred in the Township of Adlington and the estate of the Fitton family in Gawsworth. Their family was outlined above.\n\nLanded families usually hired servants from the families of their friends or relatives. This usually happened when the young people were in their teens, not yet ready or able to marry, and the contracts ran for a year or so at a time. This system was separate from apprenticeship. The hiring gave the estate family workers on the farm and in their great hall that were considered reliable and trustworthy. Usually these young people were related through marriage, and the training and the wages enabled them to move into adulthood and marriage which usually occurred in the mid to late twenties. An example of this was previously shown in the will of Edward Janny, where he lists as his servants the sons and daughters of friends and family. It may be that the Gee family received a copyhold enabling them to farm and produce cloth for several generations. They may have possessed skills which facilitated cloth production on the estates at Adlington and Gawsworth.\n\nFrancis Gee (John d. 1559)\n\nNo information had been found regarding Francis Gee. While he was clearly alive when Alice filed her will in 1591, the records of Manchester do not indicate a marriage or death. It is likely that he was a younger son. He may have removed from Manchester as Edward and Thomas seem to have done.\n\nRaphe Gee, father of clerics (John d. 1559)\n\nRaphe (Raphe) Gee was the father of a line of clerics and his family is outlined below.\n\nHenry Gee died in 1598 (John d. 1559)\n\nHenry was the second son of John Gee, (d. 1559) and the father of Edward, Henry, and daughters Elizabeth and Margret. It is through litigation regarding the land left by Henry Gee of Chester, to his daughter Elizabeth, wife of Richard Shalcross that we learn of the familial relationship between John Gee of Manchester and Henry Gee of Chester.\n\nRichard Shalcross, of Manchester, married first Elizabeth Gee, then Anne Trafford, daughter of George Trafford, before his death in 1554. Elizabeth Gee was the mother of Elizabeth Shalcross. Anne was the mother of James Shalcross, and the younger Richard Shalcross, who were noted at the time of Anne’s death in 1573. Anne married her second husband, Hugh Traves, and upon his death she wed in 1562 John Marler. James Shalcross, gentleman of Lichfied, died in 1609, leaving a son Richard who married on June 4, 1598, Margaret, daughter of Henry Gee of Manchester. Richard, the brother of James Shalcross, married Katherine Grosvenor, daughter of Sir Thomas Grosvenor of Eaton, Kent.\n\nIn 1555 the records of the Court Leet in Manchester stipulate that Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Shalcross and Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Gee (of Chester), who was his first wife, was the heir to the burrage and appurtenances in the right of her mother. In 1557 it is noted that Richard Shalcross and Edward Janny, both deceased, had title to two houses next to each other, one occupied by Hugh Traves.\n\nIn July, 1561, Henry Gee (of Manchester) claimed, in right of the wife of Richard Shalcross, “two burrages” in Manchester, but “one Anne Traves, late widow of Hugh Traves, having great friends within the town of Manchester,” ejected him by force of arms. The wife referred to would have been Elizabeth Gee, daughter of Henry Gee of Chester. Evidently Elizabeth Shalcross, her daughter, had died. At the Court held October, 1561, Henry Gee, son of John Gee, deceased, was acknowledged to be the heir to the two burages in Manchester, that had been the holding of Richard Shalcross, deceased. Finally it was settled. Clearly, upon the death of Elizabeth Shalcross, the title returned to the most senior heir to Henry Gee of Chester, and this was John Gee of Manchester. Henry Gee, while not the eldest living heir of John Gee, had some inherited rights to these structures, and this was affirmed by the courts.\n\nIn a will dated 15 Henry VIII, Henry Gee is noted as the trustee to receive rents for the Church at Manchester. He is also mentioned in the will of Isabella, widow of Robert Chetham of Manchester, dated in 1573. Henry was elected as borough-reeve in 1581. In 1581 he was named overseer to repair the Conduit of Manchester. He was appointed Myselayer in 1588 and a juror on the Court Leet 1588, and 1589 as well as market looker for corn. In 1591 and 1592 he was once again a juror and officer for oversight of the orders to be observed for the Conduit and Conduit head. He continued in these positions until his death. In addition, in 1592, and again in 1595, he was also appointed an assessor. The court ordered that Mr. Langley, gentleman, Humffrey Haughton, Henrye Gee, Roger Bexwicke, Rycharde Ffoxe, Christopher Dones, shall gether the rest of the money for the weights and to bye the same And to deliver them to the marketlookers Accordinge to goods orders set Downe afore tyme. Henry was also a constable in 1593, and skevinger for both Marketstidds the next year, and marketlooker for corn the following.\n\nHenry frequently had difficulties with his neighbors, or with the effects his tenants had on their neighbors. In 1563 Henry was ordered to take away a privy in the use of Mr. Warden so that it would not bother the house of Hugh Oldom. He sued Robert Hulme in 1581. Again, in 1584 he was told to keep his privy adjoining the backside of the house of Hugh Oldom from being a nuisance. In 1585 James Wood and William Strangefellow were ordered to keep their privies in their gardens, and that the privies should not be a nuisance to their neighbor Henry Gee. Later that year, not having responded, they were ordered to remove the privies. In 1588, the jury found that James Marler had not removed a hen pen, timber and other moveable goods that were standing under the several (a building) of Henry Gee, as he had been ordered.\n\nIn 1591 Robert Blomeley was ordered to clean his midden on every side and to keep it clean so that it would not be hurtful to the house of Henry Gee or John Reyenshall. Henry, the same year, was ordered to make up his pale (enclosure) between Robert Marshall and himself and to keep his privy well daubed. Not to be outdone, the next year, Robert Marshall was ordered to remove his coles or other things from under the several of Henry Gee and his one several, so that the water could have its course, and not be a nuisance to Henry Gee. Once again, Robert Marshall was ordered the following year to remove his stones and timber and other things from under the several of Henry Gee so that the water could flow and it not be hurtful to Henry Gee. That not solving the problem, the court ordered Blomeley to remove his stones and timber and other things from under the several of Henry Gee so the water could flow, etc.\n\nThe problem had not been resolved when in 1597 the Jurie doe finde that thear is an old watercourse turned from the right Course upon the backside of wydowe Marshall in so much that Henrie Gee hat beene greatlie annoyed and damaged and in like manner two several privies the one in the use of wydowe Marshall the other in the use of Robte Blomely and in like manner a pale made by Roberte Marshall late deceased upon the Lands of the said Henrie Geee so that the said Henrie Gee nor any person for him Can Come to Repay his said Lands whearfore we order that the said watercourse now made throughe the myddes of the said Court of wydowe Marshall shall be from tyme to tyme so well kept and looked unto that the said Henrie maie be no more annoyed or damaged or els to make the said watercourse where it first was. And also we further order the said privies to be out of hands amended so that they be not noisome to the said Henrie Gee or his heires. And further wee order that there shall be a dore made and set in place of the pale of the indifferent charges of the said Henrie Gee and wydowe Marshall and the said Henry and his heires to have fee Course at all tymes hereafter to Come and goe about the reparing of his said freehold and other his busyness Lawfull.\n\nIn July, 1598 Robert Blomeley was ordered to take away his pale that stood under the several of Henry Gee’s house.\n\nEntries in the Manchester Register for Henry who died in 1598\n\n1592 Elizabeth died\n\n1598 Margaret married Richard Shalcross\n\nApril, 1598 wife Elizabeth died\n\nMay, 1598 Henry of Manchester, householder, died\n\nChildren of Henry Gee\n\nof Manchester, d. 1598:\n\nEdward Gee, Manchester (Henry d. 1598)\n\nAt the Court Leet in 1598 … the Jurye do the presente that Henrye Gee ys depted since the last leet, and that Edwarde Gee ys his sonne and heire and at ful age, and ys to come in and to doe his sute and service.

Also the Jurye doe fynde that Edwarde Gee ys departed since the last Courte and Rycharde Shalcrosse hath married his sister and heire and ys his nexte Cosyn and heire and ys to doe his suite and service.\n\nEdward is likely the father of John Gee who married Ann Haughton in 1582.\n\nJohn Gee, householder of Stretford,\n\nson of Edward Gee\n\nThe marriage of John Gee and Anne Haughton was recorded in the Manchester register on August 2, 1582. The register also records the births and deaths of their children. Anne died in 1592. John Gee, householder of Stretford was buried at Manchester in 1599.\n\nManchester Register entires for John Gee d. 1599\n\n1583 a son Edward\n\n1584 a dau Anne\n\n1585 a dau Elizabeth.\n\n1588 a son Rauffe\n\n1592 Ann wife of John died\n\n1599 John Gee, householder died\n\n1601 Rauffe a son of John Gee of Stretford died\n\n1605 a dau Anne died\n\nTheir youngest son was only 11 and the eldest son was 15. These children would probably have been bound out to learn a trade and provide for their maintenance. They may have lived for a while with their aunt, Margaret Shalcross. It is noted that Rauffe, a son of John Gee of Stretford was buried in 1601 and in 1605 a daughter Ann was buried at Manchester. It is not certain that this is the correct Rauffe and Anne, but no others have been located.\n\nElizabeth and Margaret Gee,\n\ndaughters of Henry of Manchester (Henry d. 1598)\n\nElizabeth died unmarried in 1592. At least a portion of Edward’s estate went to his sister, Margaret Shalcross. Margaret died in 1600 and her husband Richard Shalcross died in 1613.\n\nJohn Gee, of Deansgate, d. 1588,\n\nDraper of Manchester (John d. 1559)\n\nJohn Gee, of Deansgate, was the eldest son of John (d. 1559) and Elizabeth. John married Dorthee Jackson on June 25, 1552 at St. Leonard church in Middleton Parish, Lancashire. He was Boroughreeve in 1576 and 1578. As John Gee, draper, he was appointed constable in 1585 and skevingers for bothes to ye Smythie Door with Thomas Radcliff. In 1586 John is referred to as John Gee, senior, to delineate him from his son John. He was appointed an assessor for the court leet in 1586. In 1587 both he and his son were jurors and served as constables. He was buried at Manchester, January 23, 1588-89 as John Gee of Deansgate. Dorothie, widow of John Gee, was buried in April, 1590. John served as the deputy-receiver for the lord of the manor. Recalling that in 1547 John Gee was noted as a tenant of Sir Edmund Trafford, Knight, it would appear that this leasehold was passed down, and held by John Gee of Deansgate. Upon his death in 1588, Sir Edmund sought to recover the land. Details are given in the section that follows on Stretford.\n\nManchester Register entries for John who died in 1588\n\n1573 Jan.26 daughter Katherine died\n\n1588 Jan. 23 John Gee of Deansgate died\n\n1590 April 11 Dorothie, widow of John Gee, died\n\nIt is noted in the records of the April 1589 Leet Court that John was deceased, and John Gee was his son and heir. In his will, John Gee left the lands he held in Manchester and Salford to this son John. It is noted in his father’s Inquisition post-mortem in 1593 that John, his heir was then 37 years of age.\n\nJohn held a burrage, 5 cottages, 6 gardens, and 4 acres of land in Manchester, held of the lord of Manchester, and half an acre of land in Salford, held of the Queen. In February of 1588, shortly after his death, Sir Edmund Trafford filed a Bill in the Duchy Chancery against John Gee of Manchester and Henry Ratclyff (Radcliff), and John Gregorie of Stretford to recover a close (pasture or farm) called Wallroads in Stretford. This may be the same land that was noted in 1547, with John Gee, aged 60, as a tenant.\n\nThe only recorded instance of the intervention of the lords of Manchester in the election of the borough reeve (the ordinary title of the town officer in the later English records of these Lancashire and Cheshire boroughs) occurred in 1578. Sir William West, the lord of the manor, or rather his steward, chose one person and the Court Leet jury another. The incident shows the value of the power given to the burgesses to remove their reeve. For what the steward attempted to do was not to foist a new candidate upon the burgesses, but to secure the re-election of one John Gee, who had already been borough reeve for two years. John Gee was the only recorded borough reeve between 1553 and 1821 who held office two years in succession. The reeve witnessed all transference of property in the town. Lord West shortly thereafter sold his interest in the manor to John Lacy of London. One has to wonder why he wanted John Gee to oversee this instead of another.\n\nChildren of John Gee,\n\nDraper of Manchester and Dorthie:\n\nJohn Gee, of Deansgate,\n\nManchester and Salford (John d. 1588)\n\nJohn was born in 1556 and as a young man it is likely that he was counted in the muster of Stretford by Sir Edmunde Trafford. John married Elizabethe Smythe in 1585. After the death of his father, John was referred to as John of Deansgate.\n\nIn 1589 through 1594 John served as a juror on the Court Leet. He was Boroughreeve in 1592-93 and one of the Constables in 1595-96. In 1587 he was, as John Gee, junior, appointed bylawman for Deansgate, St. Marygate and both Marketstidds. His father died the next year and that year Sir Edmunde Trafford sought to recover the close called Wallroods in Stretford that had been held by his father and two others.\n\nIn 1597, then continuously from 1599 through 1604, and 1606, John was bylawman for Deansgate and St Marygate and both the Market stidds. From 1590 on he held other positions, including Myselayer, market looker for corn, officer to see the order performed concerning Ales and Weddings, assessor. In 1597, John Gee of Manchester was among the witnesses to the will of Thomas Leigh, of Adlington. He was noted as being in lands in 1600 in the Salford Hundred Tax.\n\nIn 1611, Manchester had a swine problem. Swine had become a nuisance, wandering in the church yard, roaming the streets, causing damage and offence. So, Robert Robinsons, Richard Foxe, Adam Smyth and John Gee were elected as officers to appoint a swineherd to drive all the swine within the town of Manchester to the Collihurst or some other common waste belonging to the town, and assess anyone in Manchester who was keeping swine for the cost of the swineherd. … If their swine wander or go about in the Church yard or streets, or lands of any other man or woman in the town, shall be fined.\n\nIn 1625 Manchester felt there were too many poor in the streets, so John Gee, Raphe Cheetham and Frances Mosely, were selected to inspect every three months and count how many laborers and poor were in the streets, that might be without employment or vagrants along Smythidoor, Deansgate, Hudson’s land and so to Salford Bridge.\n\nIn 1600 Adam Smythe was ordered by the jury to make a ditch along the nearer Alporde field so the water could have free passage, and to cleanse it, so the water could pass under the stile and along the hedge of John Gee, and the barn of Adam Smythe. The jury also ordered him to clean his dunghill. Richard Foxe was asked to repair a stile that serviced a path at the back of the Deansgate between himself and John Gee. In 1626 Henry Bate of the Deansgate, husbandman, came in the night and cut down the thorns of a hedge belonging to John and was ordered to pay John for the value of a hedge.\n\nJohn Gee of Manchester also owned land in Salford Township. In 1598 the Salford Portmote notes John Gee, gentleman, was one of the Burgesses of the court. He was also on the jury. It was at this court that Thomas Gee was sited for his dunghill. That same year, John Gee, Burgess of the Portmote was noted in the records as John Gee of Manchester. John served again in 1599. John is absent from the Portmote until 1605 and 1606 when he served on the jury. There are no further entries for John until 1613. The record of his attendance was sporadic: from 1613 to 1618 he is there for every meeting; 1618 he was excused; he was present for 1621, 1625; in 1626 he was excused for one of the two sessions; 1627 excused; present for 1628, and in 1629 he was excused. It is noted in the Portmote in 1630 that John Gee was deceased and that Edmunde Gee was his son and heir and should come and do his service at the next Leet.\n\nManchester Register entries for John Gee of Deansgate\n\n1585 April 27 married Elizabethe Smythe\n\n1586 Mar 5 a dau Jone\n\n1588 Nov 30 a son Edmunde (twin)\n\n1588 Nov 30 a son Henrye (twin) died 1591\n\n1590 Dec 13 a dau Anne\n\n1592 Nov 26 a son John to John of Deansgate\n\n1594 Sep 29 a dau Elizabeth\n\n1594 Oct 6 a son Henry died 1595\n\n1596 Jul 11 a dau Margret\n\n1597 Feb 12 a dau Katherine\n\n1599 Jan 13 a dau Alice to John of Deansgate\n\n1601 Dec 30 a son Francis to John of Deansgate died 1607\n\n1605 Jan 5 a son Josephe\n\nIn his will proved a Manchester, John Gee of Manchester, gentleman requested his burial within the parish church of Manchester “under my form wherein I do usually sit in the Church, under the great pulpit there.” He left one-third of his goods to “Elizabeth Gee, now my wife,” and two third parts to Elizabeth, Joan, Anne, Margaret, Katherine and Alice, his daughters.\n\nOut of all his burrage, land, etc. in Manchester he left to Joseph Gee, his son, ₤40; to Anne, Margaret, Katherine, and Alice Gee, his daughters, ₤10 a piece; to the son and daughter of his daughter Elizabeth and John Slater, her husband, ₤10; to the children of his daughter Joan and Richard Sherdley, her husband, ₤10; and to all his grandchildren except Richard Sherdley’s children, 5 shillings each.\n\nHis wife, Elizabeth Gee, and Edmund Gee, his son and heir, were appointed executors, and my loving kinsmen George Gee, Clerk, and George Clarke of Manchester, haberdasher, were appointed supervisors. George Gee, Clerk, of Newton was the son of Raphe Gee, John’s brother, and George Clarke had married Alice Gee in 1606 in Manchester.\n\nChildren listed in his will were: daughters Elizabeth, Jone, Anne, Margaret, Katherine and Alice; sons Edmund, being the eldest and 40 years of age in 1629, and Josephe, age 24. Not accounted for is John who was born in 1592.\n\nThe inquisition taken after John’s death stated that Edmund was his son and heir, and forty years of age. John Clarke and Steven Gee conducted the inventory of his personal goods which amounted to 53₤ 7s 7 pence. One item included in the inventory was, a seiled Coate of armes, valued at 12d.\n\nProtestation List Manchester Township 1641 over 18 years\n\nGeorge, Mr. Edmund, Joseph, Sanctus\n\nChildren of John Gee, Jr:\n\nEdmund Gee born 1588, died 1642\n\nof Deansgate, Manchester and Salford\n\nEdmunde Gee was involved in the affairs of Manchester as early as 1620 when he is listed in the proceedings before Oswald Mosely, one of the King’s Justices. Following the death of John, in 1629, his son Mr. Edmund Gee, assumed the family’s responsibilities. Edmunde was a member of the Salford Portmote beginning in 1631 through 1640. It is interesting that he was excused for every meeting and only in 1636 is there any notation that he was reprimanded for failing to attend. He certainly was not alone in the neglect of Court duties. In 1634 he signed the constable’s accounts for Manchester with George Clarke, and others. In 1638 Edmunde was appointed as an assessor, marketlooker for corn, and beginning in 1638 he was one of the inspectors of new persons in Manchester to determine if they were poor and vagrants.\n\nIn 1640 he was present for the Portmote. Among the cases he heard was a complaint that several were keeping swine in violation of the statute; Joane Pendlebury, wife of Adam, assaulted Mary Hope, wife of Peter and drew blood on her body; Alice Turner was found guilty of scoulding Elizabeth Birch; the Scavengers for the Greenegate sited Mr. Adam Byrom for not cleaning the street against his house after he was warned to do so; and Edmund Cowper, Peter Hope and George Man were sited for allowing a dunghill to lie in the Street after being warned not to do so. Things picked up at the next Portmote, which Edmunde attended. John Key was presented for drawing blood and stabbing Samuel Parcyvall and his wife Ester, and for twitching and drawing blood on Elizabeth Ffidler, Nathaniel Benton, and James Duerden. That same year Edmund was appointed scavenger for Deansgate.\n\nIn 1641 in the Accounts of George and Edward Chetham, Nephews and Executors of the Founder of Cheetham, and sons and executors of James Chetham, the Founder’s elder brother, there was a Bond notice in the settlement of James Chetham, noting that Thomas Prestwich of Hulme and Edmund Gee of Manchester were to pay James Chetham.\n\nEdmunde Gee, gentleman, is listed in 1641 as a juror of the Court Leet and the Salford Portmote. No Portmote court was held in 1642 or 1643. Mr. Edmund Gee is listed for Manchester in the Protestation List of 1641-42. The records at Manchester indicate he was buried at Manchester in November, 1642. The 1644 Portmote notes heirs to Edmunde Gee, but in the 1646 records it becomes clear that these heirs had not been identified. The Salford Portmote states Edmunde Gee is deceased and who the right heirs are to his land in Salford the Court does not know. The Portmote records continue to list the heirs of Edmunde as excused until 1652 when the notation changes to his heir is within age.\n\nThere is no record of the marriage of Edmunde Gee in Manchester. Edmunde was 56 when he died. After reviewing several sources of Court Leet, Salford Portmote, Constable Accounts and Church Warden Accounts I have come to the conclusion that Edmund left no heirs other than his nephews, the sons of Joseph. Joseph clearly held title to the lands with Edmunde and possessed the family home on Deansgate. After his death, Joseph’s his widow was the person responsible for these. The accounts after 1640 do not show anyone coming to swear fealty or as present on either the Court Leet or the Salford Portmote until John, son of Joseph came of age.\n\nJoseph Gee, born in 1604, died in 1654\n\nJoseph was the youngest son of John Gee who died in 1629. Joseph married Anne Fishe, 1627 at Manchester Cathedral. The Protestation List of 1641-42 notes both Joseph and his brother Edmund. This period in Manchester was one of turmoil and disease. The constable accounts are filled with entries about sick soldiers needing help from the newly installed town government. Often they were lent horses to travel to Stretford or elsewhere. Also listed in the constable accounts are the needs of the poor, orphans and widows, and many poor Irish. The accounts are silent regarding the Gee family for this period. In 1645 there was plague in Manchester. The constable accounts note Joseph Gee in the levey in 1648.\n\nJoseph and Ann were the parents of eight daughters and one son, John, who was born in 1643. In 1651 the Manchester levy in the constable accounts reads … Joseph Gee and for Edmund Gee in lands. This seems to make it clear that the land referred to was held by them jointly. In 1652 the Salford Portmote notes that the heirs of Edmund Gee are within age. That would seem to indicate that there was a son or nephew who was capable of assuming responsibilities. However, after this notation the Burgess list continues to refer to …heirs of Edmund, excused. It may be that Edmund had a son who lived elsewhere, perhaps London and was not able to be present. This heir appears to be Edmund Gee, although there is no record of his birth or death. Joseph’s son John appears to be the final inheritor of the lands they held jointly.\n\nJoseph Gee died in or before 1654. In 1655 is an entry regarding a hedge or fence at the head end of the Deansgate between the land of Richard Radclyffe, Esquire, and the land of the heirs of Joseph Gee which was then occupied by Anne Gee, widow. The court ordered Ann to fix the hedge or be fined forty shillings. Later Anne was fined with others for not musseling her dog.\n\nIn 1659 Mrs. Gee and Mr. Ed (it is abbreviated) Gee were levied by the Manchester Constable for lands. I believe this is Joseph’s widow being assessed for the land held by Joseph and his brother Edmund. The churchwarden’s levy in 1659 notes Mrs. Gee for Mr. Edmund Gee for lands. Ann was noted as Mrs. Gee of Deansgate in the Constable Accounts’ levy in 1659\n\nManchester Registry Entries for Joseph Gee\n\n1627 Nov. 1 married Anne Fishe\n\n1628 Dec 6 a dau Mary\n\n1630 Feb 21 a dau Elizabeth\n\n1631 Nov 17 a dau Jane\n\n1633 Dec 14 a dau Ester\n\n1636 Mar 25 a dau Martha\n\n1638 Feb 18 a dau Abigail\n\n1639 Mar 15 a dau Catherine\n\n1642 Jan 21 a son John\n\n1643 Jan 21 a son John\n\n1654 will Joseph of Manchester\n\nJohn Gee son of Joseph Gee\n\nThe Court Leet documents in 1664 noted that John Gee was heir unto his father and was now at full age and was to come into this court to do his suite and service. In 1666 John was listed as a Burgess in Salford, but he did show up. That same year the Manchester Constable accounts note John Gee of Deansgate in the Tax Levy. John married Mildred Chourlton in 1671. The will of John Gee of Manchester was filed in 1675. It appears he died without any sons.\n\nRichard Gee, of Stretford and Manchester, Clothier\n\nRichard Gee of Stretford removed to Manchester. It is likely that he was a son of William Gee who died before 1543. Richard was a Clothier. His early history, before his appearance in Manchester in 1563 occurred in Stretford. In 1563 he was appointed Scavenger for the Marketstede Lane which required him to inspect the lane for violations of the Manchester codes for cleanliness and order. Richard was noted in the Salford Hundred Tax in 1563, along with the widow of John Gee of Manchester.\n\nIn 1566 Richard was once again appointed Scavenger for the Marketstede Lane and also for the Saint Mary’s Gate. Hugh Oldham served with him. In 1569 three members of the Gee family were serving the Court Leet. Raufe was a market looker for corn, John was a scavenger for Marketstede Lane, and Richard was Birlaman for Marketstede Lane.\n\nRichard Gee is also included in the 1571 subsidy for Salford Hundred, where he was listed as an inhabitant of Manchester. He was taxed for 100 shilings for goodes. It is noted that in 1571, Richard Gee and Robert Buckley were elected Constables in Manchester. One source states this was Richard Gee, Junior, however, I believe that Richard’s on was in Stretford at this time.\n\nIn 1573 it was recorded that Richard Gee had purchased a certain plat of ground in the Mylnegate from Rauffe Hopwood and he had paid to the lord his due. In 1574 Richard Gee was appointed a scavenger of the Marketsteadlane. Richard is first recorded in the Manchester Cathedral Register in 1576 when the death of John son of Richard Gee of Stretford was recorded. It is then recorded in June, 1583 that Richard’s wife, Margret, had drowned.\n\nThe river was noted for overflowing its banks at Stretford and drownings were not uncommon. Others from Stretford who drowned included John Dombell, John Hill, a servant to Othes Boardman. In 1585, Richard of Stretford, householder died.\n\nThe jury of the Court Leet found in 1586 that the pavement in the Marketstidlane against the housed (sic) of Richard Gee, Thomas Byram, and Cecily Pendleton, widow, is broken, and not yet paved. In October, 1586 …The jury doth present that Elizabeth Gee younger, the daughter of Richard Gee late of Manchester clothier, hath of the gift and grant of the late Richard Gee her father, one burgage in the Mylnegate in Manchester, now divided into two small tenements or dwellinghouses with the appurtenances, holden of the lord of this manor of Manchester, by fealty, and the yearly rent of 6D. Elizabeth married Thomas Radcliffe, of Manchester, mercer, in the Collegiate Church on November, 1586. Thomas came to the Court Leet soon after to give his fealty to the lord of the manor in right of his wife, heir of Richard Gee.\n\nWilliam Gee, son of Richard Gee, Clothier\n\nWe have only two records for William Gee. The first is his marriage on Decmeber 7, 1606 to Anne Shawe. They evidently did not have any children. The second records that William Gee, poyntr (lace maker) was buried April 2, 1611 at Manchester. There is no record of any children in the registers for William.\n\nStephen Gee, died before 1654\n\nFrom an early period, Stephen was a person of status in Manchester, which indicates he was the son of a well to do father. It would seem he was related to George Gee, shoemaker a nephew of Edmunde Gee who died in 1640. George was named to supervise the will along with his brother-in-law, George Clarke. Stephen Gee, with Clarke, conducted the inventory.\n\nStephen married Cecily, who may have been Cecily Chourlton. Stephen resided at Smithy Door and his widow, Cecily was noted there after his death. It is likely that he was a son of John of Stretford, but there is not record of his birth. The records of Manchester note in 1659 and 1666 the widow Cecily Gee at Smithy Door. George Gee, Shoemaker of Manchester also lived at Smithy Door.\n\nStephen was sent by the Constable to Warrington to bring word whether it was infected with the plague in June, 1630. In 1639 Stephen Gee was sued by Ann Moseley concerning the rights to a pew at Manchester. Stephen and Cecily were the parents of a large family.\n\nManchester Catedral records for children of Stephen Gee\n\n1620 a son Stephen\n\n1622 a son John\n\n1627 a dau Mary\n\n1630 a dau Anna\n\n1632 a son Edward\n\n1634 a dau Margret\n\n1636 a dau Elizabeth\n\n1638 a dau Margaret\n\nIn 1654 Ann Gee married Timothy Walker, Chapman, of Manchester in September. The citation notes that Anna’s father Stephen was dead and her mother was Cecily Gee, widow. Timothy Walker was the son of William Walker, Chaplain of the Collegiate Church with Richard Hollinsworth in 1650. Ceciley’s will was filed in 1677.\n\nGeorge Gee, Shoemaker of Manchester,\n\nson of John Gee of Stretford\n\nGeorge appears to be the son of John Gee of Stretford whose birth was recorded in the Manchester Register in October, 1617. George was included in the 1641 Protestation List in Manchester. George is noted as a resident of Smithy Door in Manchester in 1659 and 1666. He lived adjacent to William Gee. Also living there was the widow Gee who was Cecily Gee.

He was dean of Lincoln; M.A. St. John’s College, Cambridge, 1683; Doctor of Divinity after 1701; rector of St. Benet’s, St. Paul’s Wharf, and Chaplain in ordinary to King William and Queen Mary in 1688; prebendary of Westminster in 1701; dean of Lincoln, 1722-1730; published Jesuit’s Memorial and A Catalogue of All the Discourses Published Against Popery.
