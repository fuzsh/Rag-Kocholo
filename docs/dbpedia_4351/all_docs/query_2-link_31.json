        "text": "It's good to see a London-set film like Song For Marion, in which you play the son of a grumpy old man, who joins his wife’s choir, being shot in the north\n\nWe found great locations, expertise and personnel in Newcastle and Durham. The spirit of the places infuses the film. As for the difference between low budget and high budget, it’s a general rule of life, never mind the film industry, that people behave better the less money and power is around to be “had”.\n\nWas there any one thing that attracted you to the project?\n\nIt was a good role; they were paying me; the film was about performance rather than special effects, and I’ve always been interested in the father/son dynamic.\n\nDo you think films such as Song for Marion, and the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel are the start of a trend aimed more at a mature audience?\n\nThe industry is missing a trick if it doesn’t exploit what is undoubtedly a growing market. Culturally it’s very, very depressing when everything is about “youth” and “physical beauty”. To quote The Smiths, “It says nothing to me about my life...”\n\nYou're no stranger to working with movie legends, but how was it working with Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave?\n\nI loved working with both of them; it was an honour. Terence and I share a passion for table tennis.\n\nCan you tell us anything about your work on Thor: The Dark World?\n\nI play Malekith, a Dark Elf, the film’s villain. No smiling allowed.\n\nIf you could go back 20 years and offer the young Christopher Eccleston a piece of advice, what would it be and would you listen to your 40-something self?\n\nI’d tell him that by the time he was 49, Manchester United would have won The Premiership 20 times and he would quite rightly think I/he was in mid-life crisis.\n\nCareer-wise, where and when were you happiest and why?\n\nIn 1996 I played Trevor Hicks in the drama/documentary Hillsborough. It is the most important piece of work I’ve been involved with, and the start of a great friendship with a very, very brave man. I hope this year Trevor and all the families will finally have justice."
