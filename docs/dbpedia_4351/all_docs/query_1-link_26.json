        "text": "Widely regarded as one of greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally, twice nominated for the Oscar and recipient of every major theatrical award in the UK and US, Ian Murray McKellen was born on May 25, 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire, England, to Margery Lois (Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen, a civil engineer and lay preacher. He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his older sister, Jean, to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theatre, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by William Shakespeare, in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian's growing passion for theatre.\n\nWhen Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\". Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theatre festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Laurence Olivier, Wendy Hiller, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Paul Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest.\n\nMcKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian's homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher's \"Section 28\" legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offense. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand. He has been active in the gay rights movement ever since.\n\nIan resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner Sean Mathias. The two men have also worked together on the film Bent (1997) as well as in exquisite stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theatre, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received Richard III (1995), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Der Musterschüler (1998) and Gods and Monsters (1998), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps in 'solidifying' his 'role' as Laurence Olivier's worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as King Lear (2008) / King Lear (2008) directed by Trevor Nunn and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \"Peter Pan\" and Noël Coward's \"Present Laughter\", as well as Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" and Harold Pinter's \"No Man's Land\" (National Theatre Live: No Man's Land (2016)), both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by Sean Mathias.\n\nMcKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in X-Men (2000) and its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, which he reprised in \"The Hobbit\" trilogy. He also reprised the role of 'King Lear' with new artistic perspectives in National Theatre Live: King Lear (2018) offering an invaluable mesmerizing experience as a natural force of stage - and screen - of infinite generosity through his unsurpassable interpretation of the titanically vulnerable king.\n\nThe son of a Lancashire bookmaker, Albert Finney came to motion pictures via the theatre. In 1956, he won a scholarship to RADA where his fellow alumni included Peter O'Toole and Alan Bates. He joined the Birmingham Repertory where he excelled in plays by William Shakespeare. A member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Finney understudied Laurence Olivier at Stratford-upon-Avon, eventually acquiring a reputation as 'the new Olivier'. He first came to critical attention by creating the title role in Keith Waterhouse's \"Billy Liar\" on the London stage. His film debut soon followed with Der Komödiant (1960) by Tony Richardson with whom had earlier worked in the theatre. With the changing emphasis in 60s British cinema towards gritty realism and working-class milieus, Finney's typical screen personae became good-looking, often brooding proletarian types and rebellious anti-heroes as personified by his Arthur Seaton in Karel Reisz's Sonnabendnacht und Sonntagmorgen (1960). His exuberant defining role, however, was in the bawdy period romp Tom Jones (1963) in which Finney revealed a substantial talent for comedy. In the same vein, he scored another hit opposite Audrey Hepburn in the charming marital comedy Zwei auf gleichem Weg (1967).\n\nBy 1965, Finney had branched out into production, setting up Memorial Enterprises in conjunction with Michael Medwin. In 1968, he directed himself in Ein erfolgreicher Blindgänger (1968) and three years later produced the Chandleresque homage Auf leisen Sohlen (1971), in which he also starred as Eddie Ginley, a bingo-caller with delusions of becoming a private eye. From 1972 to 1975, Finney served as artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre. His intermittent forays to the screen confirmed him as a versatile international actor of note, though not what one might describe as a mainstream star. His roles have ranged from Ebenezer Scrooge in the musical version of Scrooge (1970) to Daddy Warbucks in Annie (1982) and (in flamboyant over-the-top make-up) Hercule Poirot in Mord im Orient-Express (1974). He appeared as Minister of Police Joseph Fouché in Ridley Scott's superb period drama Die Duellisten (1977) and as a grandiloquent Shakespearean actor in Ein ungleiches Paar - The Dresser (1983) for which he received an Oscar nomination. For the small screen Finney essayed Johannes Paul II - Sein Weg nach Rom (1984) and was a totally believable Winston Churchill in the acclaimed Churchill - The Gathering Storm (2002). His final movie credit was in the James Bond thriller Skyfall (2012).\n\nFinney was five-times nominated for Academy Awards in 1964, 1975, 1984, 1985 and 2001. He won two BAFTA Awards in 1961 and 2004. True to his working-class roots, he spurned a CBE in 1980 and a knighthood in 2000, later explaining his decision by stating that the 'Sir thing' \"slightly perpetuates one of our diseases in England, which is snobbery\". Albert Finney was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2011. He died on February 7 2019 at a London hospital from a chest infection at the age of 82. Upon his death, John Cleese described him as \"the best\" and \"our greatest actor\".\n\nA natural at portraying complex villains, anti-heroes, and charming heavies, Ian McShane is the classically trained, award-winning actor who has grabbed attention and acclaim from audiences and critics around the world with his unforgettable gallery of scoundrels, kings, mobsters and thugs.\n\nAnd, now, a god as well!\n\nMcShane just completed his third season (as star and executive producer) on the hit Starz series, \"American Gods,\" the TV adaptation of Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel. As Mr. Wednesday, a shifty, silver-tongued conman, he masks his true identity - that of the Norse god of war, Odin, who's assembling a team of elders to bring down the new false idols. A series McShane calls \"like nothing else I've seen on television.\"\n\nIt's a comment that also befits McShane's critically-acclaimed role of the charismatic, menacing and lawless 19th century brothel-and-bar keep, Al Swearengen, in the profound and profane HBO western series \"Deadwood,\" which ran for just 36 episodes over three seasons from 2004-06. For his work on the series' second season, McShane won the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Drama (in addition to Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nominations as Outstanding Lead Dramatic Actor). He also received the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama for his work in the show's debut season (with a second nomination in 2005).\n\nIt is a role and performance the New York Times dubbed \"one of the most interesting villains on television.\" And, a recent online poll called Swearengen a more compelling onscreen gangster over the likes of Tony Soprano and Michael Corleone. After a twelve-year hiatus from portraying maybe his most iconic character (\"it was the most satisfyingly creative three years of my professional career\" he says), McShane recently reprised the unforgettable rogue when HBO resurrected the 1870s western in a two-hour telefilm, \"Deadwood: The Movie,\" nominated for the Outstanding Television Movie Emmy.\n\nAt an age when many successful thespians turn to cameo appearances and character parts, McShane's busy career (which dates back to 1962) also includes three very different starring roles on the big screen. He was seen alongside David Harbour in Neil Marshall's reimagined comic book epic, \"Hellboy.\" McShane also co-starred with Gary Carr in the Dan Pritzker drama, \"Bolden,\" the biopic of musician Buddy Bolden, the father of jazz and a key figure in the development of ragtime music (McShane portrays Bolden's nemesis, Judge Perry). And, he reprised his role (reuniting with Keanu Reeves) as Winston, the suave and charming owner of the assassins-only Tribeca hotel in the latest installment of director Chad Stahelski's action trilogy, \"John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,\" which opened to enormous box office success.\n\nYears before his triumphant role in \"Deadwood,\" McShane had compiled a long and diverse career on both British and American television. He produced and starred in the acclaimed series \"Lovejoy\" for the BBC (and A&E in the U.S.), directing several episodes during the show's lengthy run. The popular Sunday night drama (which attracted 18 million viewers weekly during its run from 1990-94) saw McShane in the title role of an irresistible, roguish Suffolk antiques dealer. He would reunite with the BBC by producing and starring in the darker and more serious drama, Madson.\n\nHe collected a second Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Miniseries for his portrayal of the scheming Waleran Bigod in Starz's Emmy-nominated \"Pillars of the Earth.\" The production, which originated on the U.K.'s Channel 4, was based on Ken Follett's bestselling historic novel about the building of a 12th-century cathedral during the time known as \"the Anarchy\" after King Henry I had lost his only son in the White Ship disaster of 1120. It's a character McShane says \"would fit into the Vatican.\"\n\nHe is also well-known to TV audiences for his roles in FX's \"American Horror Story,\" Showtime's \"Ray Donovan\" and, more recently, Amazon's \"Dr. Thorne\" and HBO's juggernaut, \"Game of Thrones\" (\"I loved the character and did it because my three grandkids, big fans of the show, wouldn't have forgiven me if I hadn't\"). And, he first worked with \"American Gods\" producer Michael Green on the short-lived NBC drama, \"Kings,\" a show (inspired by The Book Of Samuel) he calls \"far too revolutionary for network television.\"\n\nOther notable small screen roles include his appearance in David Wolper's landmark miniseries \"Roots\" (as the British cockfighting aficionado), \"Whose Life Is it Anyway?,\" Heathcliff in the 1967 miniseries \"Wuthering Heights\" and Harold Pinter's Emmy-winning \"The Caretaker.\" McShane has also played a variety of real-life subjects like Sejanus in the miniseries \"A.D.,\" the title role of Masterpiece Theater's \"Disraeli: Portrait of A Romantic\" and Judas in NBC's \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (directed by Franco Zeffirelli).\n\nMcShane, who shows no signs of slowing down in a career now entrenched in its sixth decade (\"acting is the only business where the older you get, the parts and the pay get better\"), began his career during Britain's New Wave Cinema of the early 1960s. He landed his first lead role in the 1962 English feature \"The Wild and the Willing,\" which also starred another acting upstart and fellow Brit - McShane's lifelong friend, the late John Hurt. McShane later revealed that he had ditched class at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art to audition for the role.\n\nSince that 1962 motion picture debut, McShane has enjoyed a fabulous run of character roles such as the sinister Cockney mobster, Teddy Bass, opposite Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley in \"Sexy Beast\"; the infamous pirate, Blackbeard, alongside Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\"; and Richard Burton's bi-sexual partner, Wolfie, in the 1971 heist film, \"Villain.\" He gave Hayley Mills her first onscreen kiss as a smoldering gypsy in 1965's \"Sky West and Crooked,\" was part of the stellar ensemble cast (James Mason, James Coburn, Dyan Cannon) in the Stephen Sondheim-Anthony Perkins scripted big screen mystery, \"The Last of Sheila,\" and played a retired sheriff with a violent past opposite Patrick Wilson in the gritty drama, \"The Hollow Point.\"\n\nOther film credits include Guy Hamilton's all-star WWII epic, \"The Battle of Britain,\" the romantic comedy \"If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium,\" \"Pottersville,\" \"Hercules,\" \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" and \"Jawbone\" (reuniting with fellow Brit Ray Winstone in both), \"Jack the Giant Slayer,\" Woody Allen's \"Scoop,\" Rodrigo Garcia's indie drama \"Nine Lives\" (Gotham Award nominee for Best Ensemble Performance) and the darkly perverse crime drama, \"44 Inch Chest,\" a film in which McShane not only starred, but also produced.\n\nWhile also making his professional theatre debut in 1962 (\"Infanticide in the House of Fred August,\" Arts Theatre, London), McShane appeared onstage in the original 1965 production of Joe Orton's \"Loot.\" Two years later, he starred alongside Ian McKellen and Judi Dench in the hit stage play, \"The Promise,\" a production which transferred to Broadway in 1967 (with Eileen Atkins replacing Dench). He would return to Broadway one more time forty years later (2008), starring in the 40th anniversary staging of Harold Pinter's \"The Homecoming,\" for which he shared a Drama Desk Award as Best Cast Ensemble.\n\nMcShane also returned to the West End boards in 2000, charming audiences as the seductive, sex-obsessed Darryl Van Horne while making his musical stage debut in Cameron Mackintosh's \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" an adaptation of the 1987 film. At the esteemed Matrix Theatre in Los Angeles, he appeared in Harold Pinter's \"Betrayal,\" and John Osborne's \"Inadmissible Evidence,\" earning a pair of Los Angeles Drama Critics' Awards for Lead Performance in the process. He also starred in the world premiere of Larry Atlas' \"Yield of the Long Bond.\"\n\nIn addition to his work in front of the camera, McShane is also well-known for his voiceover work, with his low, distinctive baritone on display in a variety of projects. He voiced the eccentric magician, Mr. Bobinsky, in Henry Selick's award nominated \"Coraline\" (scripted by \"American Gods\" author Neil Gaiman), lent a sinister air to Tai Lung, the snow leopard adept at martial arts, in \"Kung Fu Panda\" (Annie Award nominee), and created the notorious Captain Hook in \"Shrek the Third.\" He also narrated Grace Jones' 1985 album, Slave to the Rhythm, succumbing to producer Trevor Horn's request to take the job because, per Horn,\" Orson Welles was dead, and I needed a voice.\" The album sold over a million copies worldwide. In the virtual reality domain, he recently lent his voice to the award- winning VR animated short \"Age of Sail\" in the role of the elderly sailor, William Avery, adrift alone in the North Atlantic.\n\nAfter almost sixty years entertaining audiences across the performance spectrum, McShane admits he did not set out for a career in the footlights while growing up in Manchester, England (he was actually born in Blackburn). It was by unexpected circumstances after McShane broke his leg playing soccer that he ended up performing in the school play production of Cyrano De Bergerac where he met his life-long friend and teacher, Leslie Ryder. Before he knew it, he auditioned for the Royal Academy of Arts where he was accepted and then left a term early to appear in the film, \"The Wild and The Willing\".\n\nMcShane never looked back.\n\nDistinguished character actor David Hattersley Warner was born on July 29, 1941 in Manchester, England, to Ada Doreen (Hattersley) and Herbert Simon Warner. He was born out of wedlock and raised by each of his parents, eventually settling with his itinerant father and stepmother. He only saw his mother again on her deathbed. As an only child from a dysfunctional family, young David excelled neither at academia nor at athletics. He attended eight schools and \"failed his exams at all of them.\" After a series of odd jobs, he was accepted against all odds at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), and became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nWhen he first took up acting, it was not with the notion of a prospective career, but rather to escape (in his own words) 'a messy childhood.' Warner received some early mentoring from one of his teachers, and made his theatrical debut in 1962 at the Royal Court Theatre as Snout in A Midsummer Night's Dream, directed by Tony Richardson. A year later, he became the youngest-ever actor to play Hamlet at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Comedy may not have been his forte as much as the likes of Falstaff, Lysander and (on several occasions) Henry VI. Eventually becoming disaffected with the theatre (and plagued for some years by stage fright), Warner found himself better served by the celluloid medium. His first big break came on the strength of his small part in A Midsummer Night's Dream, courtesy of Tony Richardson who cast him in his bawdy period romp Tom Jones (1963) as the mendacious, pimple-faced antagonist Blifil, who vied with Albert Finney for the affections of Susannah York. A proper starring turn on the big screen followed in due course with the title role in Protest (1966), Warner playing a deranged artist with Marxist leanings who goes to absurd lengths to reclaim his ex-wife (played by Vanessa Redgrave), including blowing up his mother-in-law. In yet another off-beat satire, Auch Arbeit kann von Übel sein (1968), Warner played a corporate drop-out who grows psychedelic mushrooms in an automated world of the future. Combined with his two-year stint as Hamlet with the RSC, Warner became a star at age 24.\n\nBy the 1970s, he had become one of Britain's most sought-after character actors and went on to enjoy an illustrious and prolific career on both sides of the Atlantic, throughout which he rarely spurned a role offered him. Tall and somewhat ungainly in appearance, Warner excelled at troubled, introspective loners, outcasts and mavericks or downright sinister individuals. The latter have included SS General Reinhardt Heydrich in Holocaust: Die Geschichte der Familie Weiss (1978), Jack the Ripper in Flucht in die Zukunft (1979), Picard's sadistic Cardassian torturer Gul Madred in Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nächste Jahrhundert (1987), the villainous ex-Pinkerton man Spicer Lovejoy in Titanic (1997) and the evil geniuses of Time Bandits (1981) (a role turned down by Jonathan Pryce) and Tron (1982). He also essayed the creature to Robert Powell 's Seelenlos - Ein Mann spielt Gott (1984).\n\nLess eccentric roles saw him as the doomed photojournalist who literally loses his head in Das Omen (1976) (Warner later described the experience of working alongside Gregory Peck as a career highlight), the sympathetic, but equally ill-fated Klingon Chancellor Gorkon in Star Trek VI - Das unentdeckte Land (1991) and the sad, likeable fantasist Aldous Gajic, searching for the Grail in Babylon 5 (1993). Warner also appeared in a trio of films for which he was handpicked by the director Sam Peckinpah. Best of these is arguably the comedy western Abgerechnet wird zum Schluß (1970), with Warner well cast as the roving-eyed, itinerant Reverend Joshua Duncan Sloane. Warner won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series for his performance as the Roman Senator Pomponius Falco in the miniseries Masada (1981). Following a three-decade long absence, Warner returned to the stage in 2001 for the role of Andrew Undershaft in Shaw's Major Barbara. In 2004, he played the title role in King Lear at the Chichester Theatre Festival in England.
