        "text": "Christopher Eccleston is back on our screens on Tuesday night in the new BBC drama Come Home.\n\nThe three-part series sees him play a father struggling to cope after his wife unexpectedly walks out, leaving him alone with their children.\n\nIt’s the latest role for an actor who’s notched up some pretty memorable roles over the past couple of decades, from the likes of Danny Boyle’s Shallow Grave through to his short but memorable stint in Doctor Who.\n\nBorn on February 16 1964 in Salford, Lancashire, Eccleston is the youngest of three boys, and was inspired to become an actor aged 19 after watching such acclaimed TV dramas as Boys From The Blackstuff.\n\nHe trained at the Central School Of Speech and Drama and made his acting debut at the Bristol Old Vic, but held other assorted jobs – including working on a building site – while he tried to get his career off the ground.\n\nEccleston’s breakthrough role came in the critically acclaimed 1991 film Let Him Have It in which he played Derek Bentley, who was controversially hanged for the murder of a policeman in 1953 – a decision which led to a lengthy campaign for a posthumous pardon after his role in the crime was called into question.\n\nFrom there, he went on to star in Danny Boyle’s debut movie Shallow Grave in 1995, starring alongside Ewan McGregor in the story of flatmates faced with a dilemma when their new tenant dies, leaving a suitcase full of money behind.\n\nMeanwhile, Eccleston made his mark on the small screen in Our Friends In The North – widely regarded as one of the best TV dramas of the 90s – which followed the story of four friends from Newcastle over three decades, taking in some significant moments in modern history along the way.\n\nThe role landed the actor a Bafta nomination in 1996, although ultimately he lost out to Nigel Hawthorne.\n\nEccleston’s other roles included Cracker, Hearts and minds, the TV movie Hillsborough and Clocking Off – although he won himself a whole new fanbase when he was cast as the Doctor in the 2005 Doctor Who revival.\n\nHe quit after just one series and more recently said it ‘almost destroyed’ his career – and claimed that he was blacklisted by the Beeb after he left.\n\nNot that it seems to have done his career any harm, since he’s been a pretty familiar face on TV and in films over the ensuing decade – with more recent roles in the likes of Fortitude, The Shadow Line, Safe House and another big BBC drama, The A Word.\n\nYou might also have spotted him in blockbuster movies in recent years including GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Thor: The Dark World.\n\nCome Home, meanwhile, sees its central story told from different perspectives including those of his character Greg and that of his character’s wife Marie – who walks out on him and their kids – and he’s admitted he found that side of the drama appealing.\n\n‘The extreme places and situations that the characters find themselves in, it’ll be interesting to see the story from everyone’s point of view rather than it being the typical male led drama,’ he explained. ‘There are six very strong characters in this and we see it from their point of view.\n\nAway from the screen Eccleston is divorced from his wife Mischka, with whom he has two children – five-year-old son Albert and Esme, four."
