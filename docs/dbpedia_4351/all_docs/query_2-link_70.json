        "text": "Christopher Eccleston has had a long road of private and publicly processing his time on Doctor Whoâfor many years, the actor simply refused to talk about why, having helped turn the series into a sensation when it returned in 2005, he left and never looked back. But, while still largely reserved, Eccleston is now more open about his experience than everâand clearer about what itâd take for him to return.\n\nThe brusque actor went viral this week after a brief moment from a panel conducted with his Doctor Who co-star Billie Piper at the For the Love of Sci-Fi convention in Manchester, England, earlier this month. With Doctor Who itself back on screens for its 60th anniversary, and with Ecclestonâs own successor David Tennant back in the TARDIS, naturally the actor was asked about his own potential to return to Doctor Who on TV anytime soon. His list of requests was…, well, see for yourself:\n\nâSack Russell T Davies. Sack Jane Tranter. Sack Phil Collinson. Sack Julie Gardner. And Iâll come back. So can you arrange that?â\n\nQuite the ask, considering all four of those people are currently making Doctor Who again. But also a brutally understandable one, given Ecclestonâs prior opening up about his time on Doctor Who.Multiple times in the past the actor has discussed how his working relationship with the production team on season one of Whoâs revival broke down and never recovered, as well as the mental health struggles he was facing while filming. After slowly opening himself back up to the franchise publicly in the last few yearsâitâs only been in the last few years that Eccleston would really talk about Doctor Who again, let alone attend conventionsâthe constant question of his potential return makes his honesty a necessity.\n\nPlus, itâs not like Eccleston has no love for his time as the Doctor, or the character he developed at all. The actor has made a grand return as the Ninth Doctor on audio for Big Finishâa relationship heâs happy to continue, in his own trademark style. When asked if heâd ever work alongside Billie Piper again for the audio producer, Eccleston added âDepends on the money! Iâve got a mortgage. Billieâs got a mortgage. Big Finish, itâs up to you.â\n\nSo thereâs plenty of opportunities for Ecclestonâs return in some waysâjust donât expect it on TV any time soon."
