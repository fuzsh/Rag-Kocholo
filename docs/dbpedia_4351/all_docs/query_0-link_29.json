        "text": "Trending\n\nQuarter of Brits reckon they could qualify for 2028 Olympics if they start training now Emily Sergeant\n\nA new survey has revealed that a quarter of Brits reckon they could qualify for the 2028 Olympics if they start training from now.\n\nThe flame may have now gone out on the 2024 Olympics over in Paris, but all eyes are now looking ahead to 2028 when the world’s biggest sporting competition descends on the US city of Los Angeles once again.\n\nAnd apparently, more than one in four Brits (27%) believe they could be a part of it.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable image to come out of the 2024 Olympics is Turkish shooter, Yusuf Dikeç, who, in contrast to other athletes at the 10m air pistol mixed team event competing in specialised gear, became a viral meme for shooting casually with one hand in his pocket, looking like he’d just wandered in off the street.\n\nDespite him having been competing since 2001, Mr Dikec’s somewhat surprising Olympic silver medal win is likely to answer for the results in this latest YouGov poll, as the 51-year-old appears to be serving as inspiration for a quarter of Brits.\n\nIn a bid to find out how many people reckon they could become an ‘everyman Olympian’, YouGov asked the British public whether they thought they could qualify for the 2028 Olympics, in one of 25 listed sports, if they started training from today and committed to giving it all they’ve got.\n\nThe results show that more than one in four (27%) think they’re up to the task.\n\nWhen it comes to the ages of respondents, the results showed that the youngest Brits are by far the most likely to think they’ve got what it takes to compete on the world stage, with 39% of 18-24 year olds saying so, alongside 34% of 25-49 year olds, while understandably, the oldest Brits are far less certain.\n\nAlthough saying that, even still, 15% of the over-65s think they could compete in the games if they put their mind to it.\n\nThe results also show that men are slightly more likely than women (30% vs 25%) to think they could make the Olympic team in 2028.\n\nYouGov says that, while the public may appear overconfident in the survey, this is perhaps more understandable when you realise the two sports they think they could compete in require the least physical activity, as 15% of Brits say they could qualify for the 10m Air Rifle team if they started training today, and a similar 13% believe they could earn a spot on the Team GB Archery team.\n\nRead more:\n\nYou can still get FREE tickets to a huge Olympics homecoming concert at the AO Arena in Manchester\n\nKeely Hodgkinson chasing world record next following 2024 Olympic gold medal win\n\nNew Which? survey reveals UK’s best and worst airlines for customer service in 2024\n\nSo, what’s your thoughts on this then? Which sport do you think you could put four years of hard work in to before the next games?\n\nCheck out the results in full here.\n\nFeatured Image – Alexandre Aymard (via Unsplash)\n\nTrending\n\nLidl launches bargain ‘mystery boxes’ full of middle aisle items worth over £100 Emily Sergeant\n\nLidl is launching its first ever series of ‘mystery boxes’ that are each filled full of weird and wonderful middle aisle items.\n\nEvery frequent Lidl and Aldi shopper knows that the supermarkets’ legendary middle aisles are the places to make for if you want to get your hands on a wide range of unexpected bargains – with everything from coffee machines and ukuleles, to goggles, crochet kits, massage guns, and more having popped up there over the years.\n\nBut how do you fancy getting a taste of the ‘Middle of Lidl’ at its finest for just £20? Even better yet if you’re helping charity along the way?\n\nWell now you can, as Lidl is launching its very-own Mystery Boxes that are worth more than £100 each, but for the bargain price of just £20 per box.\n\nJust 1,000 limited-edition boxes will be up for grabs nationwide.\n\nWith the concept of ‘mystery boxes’ recently bursting on to the scene and gaining popularity, with brands such as Nike and Candy Kittens notably jumping on the trend, Lidl says the launch of the Lidl Mystery Box is a “celebration” of the beloved cult-classic ‘Middle of Lidl’ and all its unpredictable product offerings.\n\nThe question is though, what will you get inside the box? In true ‘Middle of Lidl’ fashion, each box presents different surprises, so shoppers could receive a Silvercrest Slushie Maker in one, or get DIY savvy with some Parkside Spanners, and even learn a few chords with a Clifton Ukulele in another.\n\nFor 50 lucky dippers, a shiny ‘Bonus Item Coupon’ will be hidden inside their box too, which unlocks a bigger item worth up to a whopping £199.\n\nEverything from a Grillmeister 2-Burner Gas Barbeque, and a Tower Air Fryer 5 in 1 Smokeless Grill, to a Livarno Garden Furniture Set, or even an Inflatable All-Round Stand-Up Paddle Board are in the mix, so keep your fingers crossed you’re one of the lucky ones.\n\nAnd if all of that wasn’t good enough as it is, all the proceeds from the sales of the 1,000 Lidl Mystery Boxes will be donated to the NSPCC.\n\nKeen to get one then? The 1,000 Lidl Mystery Boxes will be on sale from 10am this Thursday (15 August), while stocks last.\n\nHead to www.lidlmysterybox.co.uk to purchase one.\n\nRead more:\n\nAldi launches new ‘magic bags’ with £10 worth of food for just £3.30\n\nLidl’s iconic trainers have been spotted back in Manchester stores\n\nPeople are discovering a little-known hack that can score teachers tonnes of discounts\n\nFeatured Image – Supplied"
