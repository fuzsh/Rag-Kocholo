        "text": "Thursday 17 May 2018\n\nuniversity; arts-media; health-social\n\nLEGENDARY actor Christopher Eccleston is leading a public debate about how dementia is portrayed in the media.\n\nThe Doctor Who star will join a panel of experts to talk about whether the media portrays negative stereotypes of people living with dementia – in everything from soap opera story lines to news articles.\n\nSalford-born Chris will speak alongside people living with dementia and academics leading research into the condition, during the event at the University of Salford’s MediaCityUK campus on Monday May 21.\n\nThey will talk about whether the often-negative language used to describe dementia in the media has an impact on people living with the condition, as well as their families, and what society can do to improve the perception of dementia.\n\nHelping people live with dementia\n\nThe actor, who has spoken about how his father Ronnie lived with Alzheimer’s before his death in 2012, opened the Salford Institute for Dementia’s hub at the University’s Allerton building last year – providing an outreach centre for the public to access the latest research and ideas about living well with dementia.\n\nThe way dementia is presented on TV and in the news has a huge effect on people’s perception, and so it’s vitally important that we have this debate and encourage people in the media to get it right.\n\nHe said:“Dementia is a growing problem and we need families and carers to be educated and supported, and we need the general public to understand the condition. The way dementia is presented on TV and in the news has a huge effect on people’s perception, and so it’s vitally important that we have this debate and encourage people in the media to get it right.”\n\nThe debate is part of a series of events marking Dementia Action Week, the Alzheimer Society’s annual awareness campaign taking place on May 21-27, led by the University’s Salford Institute For Dementia.\n\nNordoff Robbins, the UK’s largest independent music therapy charity, and Music In Hospitals And Care will demonstrate the power of music to help people living with dementia when they share insights into their work and perform at the University’s MediaCityUK campus on the afternoon of Monday May 21. Nordoff Robbins is also leading a round table in the morning, on the therapeutic benefits of music for dementia.\n\nAndy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, and Kathryn Smith, Chief Operating Officer of Alzheimer’s Society, will visit the University’s Dementia Hub on Wednesday May 23 to see the work that takes place there.\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Research UK North West Public Engagement Event, taking place at the University’s Peel Park campus on Wednesday May 23, will provide members of the public with the opportunity to visit science labs to find out about advances in dementia research, as well as to find out more about local dementia support networks.\n\nProviding help and support\n\nProfessor Anthea Innes, Director of the Salford Institute of Dementia, said: “The events taking place at the University of Salford to mark Dementia Action Week will provide a great opportunity for anyone who’s been affected by dementia to find out about the work being done here to help people living with the condition.\n\n“We’re delighted to welcome Christopher Eccleston back to the University to talk about a subject that’s very close to his heart, and we hope as many members of public as possible can come along to these events to find out about the help and support that’s available.”"
