        "text": "FORMER Doctor Who Christopher Eccleston has launched a shock attack on his old bosses on the show.\n\nIn a scathing outburst, he says he quit as the Time Lord because he did not want to “eat sh*t” – and he also suggested there was bullying by senior staff.\n\nThe acclaimed actor played the part for just one series, when the programme returned to TV in 2005.And he now says: “I left Doctor Who because I could not get along with the senior people. I didn’t agree with the way things were being run.”\n\nHe added: “I thought to remain, which would have made me a lot of money and given me huge visibility, the price I would have had to pay was to eat a lot of sh*t.”\n\nThe 28 Days Later star, speaking during an acting masterclass at London’s Theatre Royal Haymarket on Wednesday, went on: “It’s easy to find a job when you’ve got no morals. You can go, ‘Yeah, yeah. That doesn’t matter. That director can bully that prop man and I won’t say anything about it’.”\n\nEccleston, 47, won a National TV Award as the ninth Doctor before being replaced by David Tennant, who played the part until last year.\n\nThe BBC declined to comment on Eccleston’s verbal attack."
