        "text": "BBC One's new dramatisation of classic children's novel The Borrowers has assembled an almighty cast - veteran stars like Stephen Fry and Victoria Wood appear alongside hot up-and-comers like Misfits star Robert Sheehan and Dive's Aisling Loftus.\n\nAlso on board for this 90-minute spectacular is acting legend Christopher Eccleston. The Salford-born star plays Pod, aspiring action hero and head of the Clock clan. Digital Spy recently caught up with Christopher to chat about his new role, his passion for comedy and his thoughts on the BBC's move to Manchester...\n\nHow did you get involved with The Borrowers?\n\n\"I read the book when I was seven and it was a really important book in my childhood, so when the script came in, I had an immediate connection to it. I read the script, liked it, agreed the money and did it!\"\n\nHad you seen any of the previous adaptations?\n\n\"Ian Holm did [my role] first on television, in I think the early '90s, and then Jim Broadbent did a feature film version, which I haven't seen. I saw the Ian Holm [version]. Two of my favourite actors - it's a great honour to follow in their footsteps. Ours is a very different take from the Ian Holm one, in that the Ian Holm production was very true to the original novel, in terms of setting.\n\n\"I think [the setting] was late Victorian, I'm not entirely sure. Whereas this one has been placed very firmly in the late 20th / early 21st century - in the now. So my character Pod, for instance, suggests that he's borrowed his clothes from action figures from the '80s.\n\n\"He resembles Indiana Jones a little bit, and he's in a mid-life crisis, and he's finding bigger and bigger bookcases to leap off, and scarier things to do. He's fashioned himself after an action hero.\"\n\nThe Borrowers is a fun family drama, but do you find that people still associate you more with 'serious' drama?\n\n\"I don't know - I do get recognised quite a lot in the street and the British public are just fantastic with me. They don't approach me like I'm David Stephens in the attic in Shallow Grave! What's lovely about them is that they always ask me what I'm doing next - they always ask about the future and I like that.\n\n\"Rather than harking back to the past, it's always about 'What are you doing next?'. But I don't know [how they think of me]. I don't dwell on it too much.\"\n\nBut do you enjoy having that balance in your career?\n\n\"Oh, it's lovely to play a comedic, lighter character. I think there's this myth that playing Hamlet is much harder than playing a clown, and it's nonsense. I think comedy and lighter acting is far more difficult. You're relying on great subtlety so it's a fascination to me, to play this, because there are comedic elements to Pod. He has blind spots and a kind of goofiness, which I really enjoyed doing.\"\n\nAs a veteran actor, what did you make of the up-and-comers in the cast?\n\n\"I was lost in admiration, for Aisling [Loftus] and Robert [Sheehan] in particular. I didn't work with the other young actor [Charlie Hiscock]. [But] Robert and Aisling are great actors and lovely people.\"\n\nThe Borrowers is a one-off film - do you prefer making one-offs and shorter series?\n\n\"No, it all depends on the writing. I'd do a long-running series with great happiness, as long as the quality of the writing was there, and the ambition was to be original. I'm very happy to do [something] long-running.\n\n\"Our Friends In The North - I did ten hours of television. Cracker - I did the first and second series. So I think I'm more than prepared to do long-running series. It entirely depends on the quality of the writing and whether or not there's originality there.\"\n\nYou've said in the past that you don't enjoy watching yourself, but will you be watching The Borrowers at Christmas?\n\n\"Well, there are far, far, far better actors than me who don't watch themselves! Judi Dench and Johnny Depp, to name but two. But yeah, I will watch The Borrowers - it's Christmas and I'll be able to watch it with family members, and children. I'm going to watch it, and I hope that the rest of the nation is.\"\n\nAt this stage in your career, is there still a particular role or type of role you're eager to play?\n\n\"I want to play Macbeth on stage in London. I want to play Shylock [in The Merchant of Venice], I want to play Richard III, I want to do Titus Andronicus. And on television, I want to do a lot more comedy. But also, I have to add the caveat that, as an actor, I just want to get a job! But definitely, I have huge ambitions for the stage and to do more comic stuff.\"\n\nWhy haven't you done as much comedy - do you not get offered those type of roles?\n\n\"I think it's assumed that I can't do it. If you've not done it, then people assume that you can't do it. But I can. I can learn at least - I'll get better! There was The League of Gentlemen and there's other stuff that I've done that doesn't have the visibility of Cracker and Our Friends in the North. My Hamlet was funny - I don't know whether it was intentionally funny, but it was funny!\"\n\nYou've worked with the BBC a lot over the past few years…\n\n\"What have I done? I did Lennon Naked [for BBC Four] and then I did [Jimmy McGovern drama] Accused and then I did The Shadow Line. And I'm about to do a four-hour drama playing the central character called The Fuse - which will be on BBC One in 2012.\n\n\"Written by Bill Gallagher, directed by Tom Green. I'm very excited about it. I'm playing a corrupted politician with a very bad conscience who goes on a road of addiction and hopefully redemption. It's a very stylish, psychological thriller.\"\n\nAs someone from Salford who's worked at the BBC, what are your thoughts on the corporation's move to Manchester?\n\n\"I think, as a nation, there's a problem in that sometimes it feels like everything is very centralised. I think it's no mistake that the England football team's best qualifying campaign was when they were moving around the country. I think it's a great move.\n\n\"There's a huge tradition of drama [there] and the greatest writers. Peter Flannery's from Newcastle, [he wrote] Our Friends in the North, Jimmy McGovern is from Liverpool - there's just two. So it's a great move for the BBC and it's been a long time coming.\""
