        "text": "Former Dr Who star Christopher Eccleston has spoken about his role in a new Manchester drama series that will see him reunited with a top TV writer.\n\nAward-winning Jimmy McGovern was ‘gutted’ when the team behind The Street, which was filmed in Salford, were made redundant and the series axed.\n\nNow Eccleston and McGovern have been reunited to make six-part BBC1 drama Accused.\n\nPendleton-born Eccleston, who also worked with McGovern on classic Manchester-made dramas Cracker and Hillsborough, will play the leading character in the first episode.\n\nHe stars in Willy’s Story, about a plumber and loving father who commits adultery.\n\nHe said: “It’s in the spirit of The Street but very different in concept and tone. The central character for each episode is accused of something – but it’s not a courtroom drama.”\n\nEach story opens with an ordinary individual being led to the dock to hear his fate. Viewers then learn how each one came to be there. A series spokesman said: “Are they innocent or guilty, or somewhere inbetween? And will the jury make the right judgement?”\n\nSpeaking about his new drama series, McGovern said: “In the time it takes to climb the steps to the court we tell the story of how the accused came to be there.\n\n“We see the crime and we see the punishment. Nothing else. No police procedure, no coppers striding along corridors with coats flapping.”"
