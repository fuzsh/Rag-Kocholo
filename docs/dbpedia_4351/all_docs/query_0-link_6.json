        "text": "Former Dr Who star Christopher Eccleston has spoken about his role in a new Manchester drama series that will see him reunited with a top TV writer.\n\nAward-winning Jimmy McGovern was âguttedâ when the team behind The Street, which was filmed in Salford, were made redundant and the series axed.\n\nNow Eccleston and McGovern have been reunited to make six-part BBC1 drama Accused.\n\nPendleton-born Eccleston, who also worked with McGovern on classic Manchester-made dramas Cracker and Hillsborough, will play the leading character in the first episode.\n\nHe stars in Willyâs Story, about a plumber and loving father who commits adultery.\n\nHe said: âItâs in the spirit of The Street but very different in concept and tone. The central character for each episode is accused of something â but itâs not a courtroom drama.â\n\nEach story opens with an ordinary individual being led to the dock to hear his fate. Viewers then learn how each one came to be there. A series spokesman said: âAre they innocent or guilty, or somewhere inbetween? And will the jury make the right judgement?â\n\nSpeaking about his new drama series, McGovern said: âIn the time it takes to climb the steps to the court we tell the story of how the accused came to be there.\n\nâWe see the crime and we see the punishment. Nothing else. No police procedure, no coppers striding along corridors with coats flapping.â"
