        "text": "Christopher Eccleston was born 16 February 1964 and today celebrates his 59th birthday.\n\nEcclestonâ€™s time as the Ninth Doctor was of course a notoriously short one, remaining in the role for just a single series in 2005. Nevertheless, it was a hugely important series, being the one that revived our favourite show.\n\nSo have a fantastic birthday, Chris!"
