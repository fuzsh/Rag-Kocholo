        "text": "WE spoke to Eccles born actor Benedict Wong about his work with Marvel Films and Doctor Strange.\n\nHe was born in Eccles in 1971, and spent his childhood in Salford, his youth was spent at Salford City College doing a performing arts course. This has all led up to him getting his biggest role so far, playing Wong in Marvel’s Doctor Strange.\n\nFrom humble starts on a 1993 BBC Radio show, all the way up to his role in the hit film Prometheus, it’s clear that Wong’s talent is getting the recognition it deserves. I was able to speak to him during his press junket and found out exactly what it means to be a part of something as big as Doctor Strange.\n\nHe said: “It’s just great to be a part of it really, and just to see how things are realised on the page and you just sort of know that you’re in the best hands.\n\n“The pedigree that they have, and the crew, right down to the costume design team. I’m surrounded by this amazing ensemble.\n\nI used to collect my Spiderman comics and for the ones I couldn’t afford, get the bus to Manchester and go to Odyssey Seven comic book store.\n\n“That’s what I would do, spend all my days catching up on other superhero’s until I was chucked out at 6PM.\n\n“It’s just nice to see the investment as a kid, returning back to you in your adult life really. So yeah, it’s the best of both worlds.”\n\nDoctor Strange comes out in cinemas on October 25 with Benedict Cumberbatch playing the main character Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange, and Benedict Wong plays his sorcerer sidekick Wong.\n\nThe full interview with Benedict Wong is on our Soundcloud account.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-844403577/doctor-strange-interview-with-benedict-wong"
