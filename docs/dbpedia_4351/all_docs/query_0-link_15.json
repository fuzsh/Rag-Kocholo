        "text": "Albert Finney, an iconic figure in the world of film and theater, was born on May 9, 1936, in Salford, Greater Manchester, England. Raised within a working-class family, he displayed a profound interest in performing arts from a young age. Finney's journey to stardom began at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he honed his acting skills and developed a strong foundation that would serve him well throughout his illustrious career. Finney's breakthrough came in 1960 with his lauded performance in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. His portrayal of Arthur Seaton, a factory worker who rebels against societal norms, established him as one of Britain's most promising actors. He further solidified his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed roles in successful films such as Tom Jones in 1963, Murder on the Orient Express in 1974, and Erin Brockovich in 2000. Throughout his career, Finney exhibited a remarkable ability to embody a wide range of characters, earning him five Academy Award nominations. In addition to his cinematic achievements, Finney was also a prominent figure in the theatre world. His performances in plays like Luther and A Day in the Death of Joe Egg were met with critical acclaim, demonstrating his versatility as an actor. Despite his success, Finney remained grounded, often shying away from the limelight and Hollywood's glamour. He passed away on February 7, 2019, leaving behind a legacy of memorable performances and an undeniable impact on the world of entertainment.\n\nJoanne Whalley (born 25 August 1961) is an English actress who began her career in 1974.
