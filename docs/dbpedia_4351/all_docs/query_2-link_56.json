        "text": "In this BBC TV series filmed in Manchester, Christopher Eccleston plays 35 year old lad-about-town Jim Calvert, who works at Manchester Airport and falls in love with an unmarried mother played by Sarah Lancashire. Chris was in two episodes in the first series - episode 2 (Yvonne's Story) and episode 4 (Steve's Story). A retired master car thief must come back to the industry and steal 50 cars with his crew in one night to save his brother's life. Starring Nicholas Cage and Angelina Jolie. Eccleston plays Raymond Vincent Calitri whose nickname is \"The Carpenter\" due to he's good at making caskets after he kills people for their failures. Short film by an award-winning team of poet Simon Armitage and director Brian Hill. A salesman is running late and gets a flat tyre. The tyre roles away sparking memories of when he found a tractor tyre as a boy and set it rolling. This is a 10 minute film. It was the winner of the 15th Leeds International Film Festival. Series of three drama-documentaries about great explorers. Chris plays Alexander Von Humboldt in this BBC rediscovery of the man who Darwin called ‘the greatest naturalist in the world’. The 50 min drama/documentary charts his 5 year voyage to South America and why his once great fame has now virtually disappeared. Chris plays Vincent Boyd, opposite Dirvla Kirwan in this soft romantic film from director Michael Winterbottom about a married couple who plan to have a baby. They seem unable to produce a child even with adopting a healthier lifestyle; loose clothing, green vegetables and programmed sex. Chris plays Millennium Man alongside Millennium Woman, Hermione Norris, (Karen in Cold Feet) in this film by Rochdale Director Brian Hill. They tour the country collecting items for a Millennium Bonfire, starting with a knapsack and finishing up driving a truck. The main dialogue is Simon Armitage's 1000 line Millennium Poem. Chris plays plays Gary Ellis, a young man who receives a heart transplant in Jimmy McGovarn's psychological thriller. Saskia Reeves, playing the mother of the donor, tracks him down and her obsession with the only living piece of her dead son is the central theme of this Manchester-filmed movie. Directed by Charles McDougall. Chris plays Levi in this \"psycho-sexual mindbender\" - a computer games designer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, is targeted for assassination by religious fanatics and the chase takes her into a world bordering on fantasy. Also stars Jude Law, Ian Holm, Callum Keith Rennie, Willem Defoe and Don McKellar. Directed by David Cronenberg In this Oscar winning drama about England's first Queen Elizabeth. Chris plays the nasty Duke of Norfolk, alongside Cate Blanchett. The highlight of this movie for Chris was not the number of awards the film collected but the fact he was given the opportunity to star alongside United legend-turned actor, Eric Cantona. About a young woman (played by Renée Zellweger) who is married to a devout Brooklyn Hasidic Jew, Sender Horowitz, played by Chris, and the problems that trouble their marriage because of her wanting for more out of life. Christopher Eccleston plays the character of Liverpool fan Trevor Hicks, father of two girls killed in the 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster, in this Jimmy McGovarn true story TV drama that campaigned for justice."
