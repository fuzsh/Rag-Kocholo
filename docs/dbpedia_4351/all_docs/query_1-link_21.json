        "text": "Actor Christopher Eccleston has said he hopes “nature takes its revenge” on the people who drop litter in his local park.\n\nThe former Doctor Who star - who was born in Salford, Manchester - has posted a foulmouthed rant on Instagram, raging about the “s**t” that has been dropped in Salford’s Heaton Park.\n\nEccleston, 55, fumed in the video: “I’m walking in Heaton park in Prestwich in Salford - it’s one of the most beautiful parks in the country and I’ve been coming here since I was a kid.\n\nRead more: Christopher Eccleston dishes on his BBC 'blacklisting'\n\n“It really is a beautiful place and it’s covered in s***. By people who have picnics and leave their Coke bottles and their wrappers, their s*** everywhere - used nappies! They just foul it up.\n\n“And I tell you what - I hope nature takes its revenge on you, every single one of you that leaves s*** on the floor and in the park.\n\n“What you’ve done to Heaton Park is disgusting and I hope the planet turns round and s***s on you.”\n\nManchester City Council agrees with the Thor: The Dark World actor and has staff picking up litter in the grade II-listed park every day during the summer.\n\nLuthfur Rahman, executive member for skills, culture and leisure at the council told the BBC litter dropping is viewed as \"anti-social\" and \"potentially dangerous\"."
