        "text": "Actor and one-time Dr Who Christopher Eccleston has been spotted in Bolton town centre.\n\nThe Salford -born star snapped a photo outside the Ye Olde Man and Scythe pub on Monday (June 21).\n\nA caption along the photo, uploaded to his Instagram account, read: “Ye olde man and ye olde man and scythe”.\n\nThe 57-year-old has starred in some of the most critically acclaimed projects over his career, including Doctor Who, Cracker, 28 Days Later and Our Friends in the North.\n\nREAD MORE Machete-wielding gang attack in Bolton was 'like something from GTA' say terrified witnesses\n\nOne of the oldest pubs in the UK, the first recorded mention of the Man and Scythe was in a charter in 1251.\n\nOver the last 769 years, the Churchgate building has been restructured several times and changed hands many times more.\n\nBut, for part of the 1600s, it was owned by the family of James Stanley, seventh Earl of Derby.\n\nOn May 28 1644, Stanley was responsible for more than 1,000 people being murdered in Bolton.\n\nThe incident, which became known as the 'Bolton Massacre' was said to be revenge for a siege on Stanley's home Lathom House, earlier that year, in which several Bolton men were involved.\n\nIt was not until the Battle of Worcester, seven years later, when Stanley was eventually captured and brought back to Bolton under a military escort to be put to death.\n\nStanley spent his last few hours inside his family's pub, mostly in the prayer room, and his ghost is said to haunt its cellar.\n\nTo this day, a chair he is said to have sat on remains inside the building."
