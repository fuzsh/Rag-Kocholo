She spent her first years in Cassel, but lived in Copenhagen in Denmark, where her father had a position, from the age of three; she did however have her confirmation in Hesse. Louise was educated by a governess and her Swiss chamberlain. She studied languages, art, music, drawing and painting. She was particularly talented at the pianoforte, in which she was tutored by a Miss Tuxen. Occasionally, she accompanied her father on trips to Hesse.\n\n\"Louise was very much pre-occupied with the succession of the Crown of Denmark from early childhood. In the political and dynastic conflicts that raged in Denmark during her lifetime, she consistently found herself in opposition to German nationalism and protective of Danish interests, mainly due to her upbringing and rank within the kingdom of Denmark. As a niece of King Christian VIII, who ruled Denmark between 1839 and 1848, Louise was very close to the succession after several individuals of the royal house of Denmark who were elderly and childless. As children, her brother Frederik Wilhelm, her sisters and she were the closest relatives of King Christian VIII who were likely to produce heirs. It was easy to see that the agnatic succession from King Frederick III of Denmark would probably become extinct within a generation. Louise was one of the females descended from Frederick III of Denmark, and she enjoyed the remainder provisions of the succession (according to the Semi-Salic Law) in the event that his male line became extinct. She and her siblings were not agnatic descendants of the House of Oldenburg and the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein, thus ineligible to inherit the twin duchies, since there existed a number of agnatic lines eligible to inherit those territories.\"\n\nBuried Roskilde Domkirke, Roskilde, Denmark.\n\nYou can read more about her here.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_of_Hesse-Kassel\n\nhttps://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_af_Hessen-Kassel\n\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_von_Hessen_(1817%E2%80%931898)\n\nSee also:\n\nFind A Grave: Memorial #9423489\n\nWikidata: Item Q166028"
