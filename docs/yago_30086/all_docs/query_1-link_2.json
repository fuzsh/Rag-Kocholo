        "text": "Four Kings, 1899\n\nOn the way to the antechamber one passes the so-called \"Four Kings Picture\", where the first four kings from the House of Glücksburg are gathered for the christening of Prince Frederik (IX).\n\nThyra\n\nDaughter of Christian IX and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. Duchess of Cumberland through her marriage to Ernest August of Hanover, Duke of Cumberland.\n\nThe Fabergé Chamber\n\nOn display in the Fabergé Chamber is Russian jewellery from the period 1860-1917, with a focus on the close ties between the Danish and Russian monarchies. A selection of the Danish Crown Jewels will also be exhibited.\n\nQueen Louise\n\nQueen Louise became queen in 1863. In 1842 she married Prince Christian (IX), and eventually became the first Royal Couple from the Glücksburg line after the childless Frederik VI.\n\nQueen Louise’s salon\n\nQueen Louise’s private salon is, just as the study of her husband, Christian IX, arranged in Victorian style. At the time this was considered highly tasteful, which can seem a bit peculiar to the modern eye.\n\nChristian IX’s study\n\nThe study clearly stems from the Victorian era. The many family photos bear witness to the fact that Christian IX was a dedicated family man.\n\nChristian X\n\nKing of Denmark from 1912. Christian X's long reign spanned both world wars, and during the German occupation in World War II he became a national icon.\n\nFrederik VIII\n\nFrederik VIII was to have just six years as monarch which were relatively undramatic. He is therefore a slightly overlooked figure in the Danish royal line."
