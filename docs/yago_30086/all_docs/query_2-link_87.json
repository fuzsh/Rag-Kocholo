        "text": "From the Emperor’s Desk: after my blog entry on King William III-II of England Scotland and Ireland, Prince of Orange, I wanted to write a little more about his successor.\n\nJohan Willem Friso (August 14, 1687 – July 14, 1711) became the (titular) Prince of Orange in 1702. He was the Stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen in the Dutch Republic until his death by accidental drowning in the Hollands Diep in 1711. From World War II to 2022, Friso and his wife, Marie Louise, were the most recent common ancestors of ALL current European monarchs.\n\nOn April 1709, Johan Willem Friso married Princess Maria Louise of Hesse-Cassel (1688–1765) who was one of seventeen children born to Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, by his wife and cousin, Princess Maria Amalia of Courland. Two of her siblings included King Frederik I of Sweden and Wilhelm VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.\n\nJohan Willem Friso’s grandmother mother, Princess Maria Amalia of Courland, was the daughter of Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland and Semigallia (1610–1681) and his wife, Princess Louise Charlotte of Brandenburg (1617–1676).\n\nJohan Willem Friso was the son of Hendrik Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz, and Princess Henriëtte Amalia of Anhalt-Dessau who were both first cousins of King William III-II of England, Scotland and Ireland and Prince of Orange.\n\nAs such, he was a member of the House of Nassau (the branch of Nassau-Dietz), and through the testamentary dispositions of King William III-II became the progenitor of the new line of the House of Orange-Nassau. He was educated under Jean Lemonon, professor at the University of Franeker.\n\nSuccession\n\nWith the death of King William III-II of England, Scotland and Ireland and Prince of Orange, the legitimate male line of Willem I the Silent (the second House of Orange) became extinct.\n\nJohan Willem Friso, the senior agnatic descendant of Willem the Silent’s brother, Johann VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg\n\nCount of Nassau-Dillenburg, and a cognatic descendant of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange, the grandfather of William III, claimed the succession as stadtholder in all provinces held by William III. This was denied to him by the republican faction in the Netherlands.\n\nThe five provinces over which William III ruled – Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel – all suspended the office of stadtholder after William III’s death. The remaining two provinces – Friesland and Groningen – were never governed by William III.\n\nJohan Willem Friso was the stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen where he succeeded his father, Hendrik Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz, the previous stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen. These territories continued to retain a separate stadtholder.\n\nJohan Willem Friso established the third House of Orange, which became extinct in the male line in 1890. His son, Willem IV of Orange, later became stadtholder of all United seven provinces.\n\nJohn William Friso’s position as William III’s heir general was opposed by King Friedrich I in Prussia, who also claimed (and occupied) part of the inheritance (for example Lingen). Under William III’s will, Johan Willem Friso stood to inherit the Principality of Orange. However, the Prussian King Frederick I also claimed the Principality of Orange in the Rhône Valley, of France.\n\nKing Friedrich I in Prussia claimed the Principality of Orange as the senior cognatic heir of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange through his mother Countess Louise Henriette of Nassau. She was the eldest daughter of Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange\n\nand Amalia of Solms-Braunfels.\n\nUnder the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Friedrich I’s successor, King Friedrich Wilhelm I in Prussia, ceded his territorial claim to the Principality of Orange King Louis XIV of France and Navarre, keeping only a claim to the title itself."
