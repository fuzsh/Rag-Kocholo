The chldren of Friedrich Wilhelm and Gertrud Falkenstein were given the title prince/princess of Hanau.\n\nAn interesting account of Gertrud Falkenstein published shortly after her death. She was married in 1822 or 1823 to an army officer Karl Michael Lehmann and shortly after the marriage she met Friedrich Wilhelm. Her husband Karl Lehmann apparently was induced by Friedrich Wilhelm with a sum of the equivalent of £15,000 pounds to divorce his wife Gertrud.\n\nA somewhat unflattering article on Friedrich Wilhelm shortly after his death.\n\nElector Friedrich Wilhelm I was succeeded as representative of the House of Hesse-Cassel by his second cousin Landgrave Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel(1820-1884) 45.2441 Princess Auguste Marie Gertrud von Hanau 1829 1887 Prince Ferdinand Maximilian III (Fürst) zu Isenburg-Büdingen in Wächtersbach 1824 1903 45.2442 Princess Alexandrine von Hanau 1830 1871 Prince Felix Eugen of Hohenlohe-Oehringen 1818 1900 See 22.324 45.2443 Prince Friedrich Wilhelm von Hanau 1832 1889 Auguste Birnbaum 1837 1862 Marriage registration of Friedrich Wilhelm and Auguste Birnbaum 45.2443 Prince Friedrich Wilhelm von Hanau 1832 1889 Ludowika Gloede 1840 1912 45.2444 Prince Moritz Philipp Heinrich von Hanau (1st Fürst von Hanau) 1834 1889 Anne von Lossberg 1829 1876 45.2445 Prince Wilhelm von Hanau (2nd Fürst von Hanau) 1836 1902 Princess Elisabeth Wilhelmine of Schaumburg-Lippe 1841 1926 See 43.9 45.2445 Prince Wilhelm von Hanau (2nd Fürst von Hanau) 1836 1902 Countess Elisabeth zur Lippe-Weissenfeld 1868 1952 45.2446 Princess Marie Auguste von Hanau 1839 1917 Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld 1831 1890 See 35.41\n\nPrince Wilhelm was married four times:\n\nFirst - Princess Marie von Hanau und zu Horowitz (1839-1917)\n\nSecond - Princess Juliane zu Bentheim und Steinfurt (1842-1878)\n\nThird - Princess Adelheid zu Bentheim und Steinfurt (1840-1880)\n\nFourth - Princess Auguste of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.

The Landgrave retired to bed on 13 October and his servant checked on him a couple of times in the early hours of the following day and found he was asleep in his bed. However when a further check was made early afternoon the Landgrave's bed was empty and there was no sign of him even though his servant was in attendance at his door during the night.
