        "text": "Between her wedding and mine the wedding of our relation and friend Elizabeth of Hesse Cassel (eldest sister of uncle Fischy) took place at Schloss Phillippsruh, not far from Frankfurt which her father, the Landgraf, had recently rebuilt and refurnished. Papa and Ella attended the wedding at which all the Hessian and Danish relations, including aunt Minnie of Russia and Aunt Alix of Wales, were present.\n\nThe Landgraf, who was a very excitable man, was nearly off his head at having to lodge and entertain so a large party of guests and his speech at the wedding breakfast was a remarkable one. It began: ” I do not thank ( Ich danke nicht) the Empress of Russia, my dear niece, I do not thank the Princess of Wales, my dear niece, I do not thank etc., etc. “- names of all the guests present- “for being here today, – No, I thank all! everybody!”- and, in a loud aside to his neighbour as he broke down into tears – tapping the pocket in the back of his uniform; “my handkerchief, my handkerchief!”"
