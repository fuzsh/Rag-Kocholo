Becoming crown prince in 1906, Christian led the opposition to the sale of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands) to the United States, which ultimately took place in 1917. He assumed the throne on his father’s death in 1912.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nChristian attended the first in a series of meetings of Scandinavian kings during World War I at Malmö in December 1914. In June 1915 he signed the new constitution that provided for a two-chamber parliament with equal suffrage for men and women; he also gave his assent to the federal act of 1918 making Iceland an independent kingdom. In July 1920 he received a warm welcome in North Schleswig, the part of Schleswig-Holstein ceded to Denmark by Germany under the Treaty of Versailles (1919)."
