        "text": "Queen of Denmark from 1863 to 1898\n\nLouise of Hesse-Kassel (German: Luise Wilhelmine Friederike Caroline Auguste Julie, Danish: Louise Vilhelmine Frederikke Caroline Auguste Julie; 7 September 1817 – 29 September 1898) was Queen of Denmark as the wife of King Christian IX from 15 November 1863 until her death in 1898.[1] From 1863 to 1864, she was concurrently Duchess of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg.\n\nLouise was born as the daughter of Prince William of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Charlotte of Denmark. Her siblings included Princess Marie Luise Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel, Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Auguste Sophie Friederike of Hesse-Kassel. Louise of Hesse lived in Denmark from the age of three.\n\nAs a niece of King Christian VIII, who ruled Denmark between 1839 and 1848, Louise was very close to the succession after several individuals of the royal house of Denmark who were elderly and childless. As children, her brother Frederick Wilhelm, her sisters and she were the closest relatives of King Christian VIII who were likely to produce heirs. It was increasingly obvious that the traditional male line succession might come to an end within a generation as the crown prince was childless despite two marriages. Louise was one of the females descending from Frederick III of Denmark, and she enjoyed the remainder provisions of the Danish agnatic-cognetic succession according to the King's Law in the event that Frederick III's male line became extinct.\n\nLouise and her siblings were not agnatic descendants of the House of Oldenburg. Louise was thus ineligible to inherit the Holstein throne - which was under agnatic succession. This threatened the continued existence of the joint monarchy between Denmark and the two duchies. Denmark and its fief Schleswig both followed the succession rules in the King's Law giving Louise a strong claim to the Danish throne.\n\nLouise was married at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen on 26 May 1842 to her double second cousin Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg who in 1863 became King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nThe marriage combined Christian's weak claim to the throne with Louise's senior claim. The couple lived a quiet family life but their claims to the throne were disputed for more than a decade.\n\nLouise's claim to the throne was challenged by the House of Augustenborg which held the stronger claim to the Holstein throne and a subsidiary claim to the Danish and Schleswig thrones. The House of Augustenborg argued that the King's Law was purely agnatic and presented itself as the opportunity to preserve the undivided monarchy.\n\nIn 1847, King Christian VIII decided that the throne should pass to Prince Christian of Glücksburg in the event that crown prince Frederick (the later Frederick VII) fathered no dynastic sons. This choice was communicated to the Great Powers of Europe.\n\nThe situation remained disputed and succession was a main reason for the House of Augustenburg rebelling against Denmark in the 1848-51 First Schleswig War. That house was consequently struck from the line of succession. This cemented that Prince Christian of Glücksburg would become the next monarch.\n\nLouise's mother and siblings renounced their rights to the Danish throne to her and Louise herself in turn renounced her rights in favour of her husband. In 1852, this succession order was confirmed by the Nordic countries and foreign powers in London.\n\nChristian and Louise's children would now be heirs to the Danish throne both due to compliance with the King's Law and due to international treaty. This resolved the succession to the Danish crown, but not Denmark's future relation to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. German Holstein's historic law of succession was Salic, thus exclusively male, and could not easily be reconciled with Christian's claim as long as the Augustenborgs survived and Prussia offered itself as the international champion of German nationalism. In 1864, this conflict resulted in the Second Schleswig War.\n\nBy 1853, Denmark had become a constitutional monarchy and Parliament amended the Danish law of succession proclaiming Christian Hereditary Prince of Denmark, thus cementing that he would succeed when King Frederick VII died (unless the uncle of King Frederick, Prince Ferdinand, would outlive his nephew). Although Frederick disapproved of this choice he signed it into law on 3 July 1853.\n\nLouise disapproved of Frederick VII's non-dynastic marriage to Louise Rasmussen and in turn the King disapproved of Christian succeeding him. The two couples thus had a tense relationship and spent little time together.\n\nOn 15 November 1863 King Frederick VII died and Christian became King of Denmark. The relationship between Louise and Christian seems to have been at least partially a marriage of love, and is described as happy: she supported him in his struggle to be acknowledged as heir-presumptive to the throne of Denmark, and the couple became strongly attached to each other during the years of succession struggle. Her loyalty is said to have been of great importance to him, and Christian is described as dependent upon her intelligence, judgment and psychological strength, all of which were considered to be superior to his own. Their life style is described as simple and puritan, and as this suited the contemporary view of an exemplary family life, the royal family was regarded as a morally correct role model. Because of this, the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter Thyra in 1870 became a burden; Louise took control of the situation and hid it from public knowledge by sending Thyra to give birth abroad, keeping the whole affair a family secret.\n\nAs queen, Louise lived a life isolated from the people and did not seek a relationship with or recognition from the public. She took no part in state affairs; her political interests focused on the arranged dynastic marriages of her children and were affected by her anti-German views. The high status marriages she arranged for her children secured the newly established Danish dynasty international status, connecting Denmark to Great Britain, Russia, Sweden and Greece. Known as \"The Mother-in-law of Europe,\" her annual family gatherings at Bernstorff and Fredensborg attracted more attention every year and made her a popular symbol of family life. Significant events in her life included her wedding anniversary on 26 May 1867, when she received great public praise; her birthday celebration of 1887; the wedding anniversary of 1892, and her 80th birthday in 1897.\n\nThe great dynastic success of Louise's six children was to a great extent a result of Louise's own ambitions rather than the efforts of her husband Christian IX. Some have compared Louise's dynastic capabilities with those of Queen Victoria.\n\nShe was interested in music and painting. She acted as the patron of artists such as Elisabeth Jerichau Baumann. Some of Louise's own paintings were exhibited and given as gifts to members of other royal dynasties.\n\nLouise supported 26 different charitable organizations. Among them were Vallø stift; Kronprinsesse Louises praktiske Tjenestepigeskole (The Servant Girls' School of Crown Princess Louise) and the Dronning Louises Børnehospital (Queen Louise's Children's Hospital). In 1857, she founded the Louisestiftelsen (Louise Foundation), an orphanage for girls with the purpose of raising them to a life of domestic servants, which illustrated her deeply conservative ideals. Her most known project, and one which she herself referred to as her most important, was the Diakonissestiftelsen (The Deaconess Foundation) in 1863, which introduced the Deaconess profession in Denmark. In 1891, she initiated the Foreningen til Oprettelse af Friskolebørneasyler i Kbh.s Arbejderkvarter (Foundation for the Establishment of Charter school's Asylums in the Labour Quarters of Copenhagen). She founded the Belønnings- og Forsørgelsesforeningen (The Reward- and Self-supporting Foundation) in 1881, supported domestic servants by providing financial aid to the ill, during unemployment and in retirement. Louise was deeply conservative, and her charitable work has been interpreted as a fear of socialism and the growing workers movement.\n\nQueen Louise died peacefully at Bernstorff Palace aged 81 on 29 September 1898 and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen on 15 October 1898. During her last years, she become deaf and infirm, and her needs were taken care of by two deaconesses from the Deaconess institution she founded. Louise was Queen Consort of Denmark for 35 years, longer than any other Danish Queen before her.\n\nLouise had the following six children with Christian. Eventually, they had forty grandchildren, including the illegitimate daughter of Thyra.\n\nName Birth Death Spouse Children Frederik VIII, King of Denmark 3 June 1843 14 May 1912 Princess Louise of Sweden Christian X, King of Denmark\n\nHaakon VII, King of Norway\n\nLouise, Princess Frederick of Schaumburg-Lippe\n\nPrince Harald of Denmark\n\nPrincess Ingeborg, Duchess of Västergötland\n\nPrincess Thyra of Denmark\n\nPrince Gustav of Denmark\n\nPrincess Dagmar, Mrs. Castenskiold Princess Alexandra of Denmark 1 December 1844 20 November 1925 Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale\n\nGeorge V, King of the United Kingdom\n\nLouise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife\n\nPrincess Victoria of the United Kingdom\n\nMaud, Queen of Norway\n\nPrince Alexander John of Wales George I, King of Greece 24 December 1845 18 March 1913 Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia Constantine I, King of Greece\n\nPrince George of Greece and Denmark\n\nGrand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia\n\nPrince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia\n\nPrincess Olga of Greece and Denmark\n\nPrince Andrew of Greece and Denmark\n\nPrince Christopher of Greece and Denmark Princess Dagmar of Denmark 26 November 1847 13 October 1928 Alexander III, Emperor of Russia Nicholas II, Emperor of Russia\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia\n\nGrand Duke George Alexandrovich\n\nGrand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna\n\nGrand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia\n\nOlga Alexandrovna, Duchess Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg Princess Thyra of Denmark 29 September 1853 26 February 1933 Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover Marie Louise, Margravine of Baden\n\nGeorge William, Hereditary Prince of Hanover\n\nAlexandra, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nPrincess Olga of Hanover and Cumberland\n\nPrince Christian of Hanover and Cumberland\n\nErnest Augustus, Prince of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick Prince Valdemar of Denmark 27 October 1858 14 January 1939 Princess Marie of Orléans Prince Aage, Count of Rosenborg\n\nPrince Axel of Denmark\n\nPrince Erik, Count of Rosenborg\n\nPrince Viggo, Count of Rosenborg\n\nMargaret, Princess René of Bourbon-Parma\n\nHonorary Dame Grand Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog, 7 September 1883[2]\n\nDame of the Order of the Elephant, 26 May 1892[2]\n\nRoyal Family Decoration of King Frederick VII[3]\n\nRoyal Family Decoration of King Christian IX[3]\n\nMexican Empire: Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of Saint Charles, 10 April 1865[4]\n\nGrand Duchy of Hesse: Dame of the Grand Ducal Hessian Order of the Golden Lion, 30 April 1884[5]\n\nEmpire of Japan: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Precious Crown, 12 April 1892[6]\n\nKingdom of Portugal: Dame of the Order of Queen Saint Isabel[2]\n\nRussian Empire:[2]\n\nDame Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of Saint Catherine\n\nRed Cross Medal\n\nSpain: Dame of the Royal Order of Noble Ladies of Queen Maria Luisa, 25 January 1878[7]\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n\nRoyal Order of Victoria and Albert, 1st Class[8]\n\nHonorary Lady of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem[9]\n\nQueen Louise at the website of the Royal Danish Collections at Amalienborg Palace\n\nHow Christian IX received the succession to the throne of Denmark"
