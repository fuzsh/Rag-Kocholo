It has also been reported that the couple decided to name her Louise after Louise of Hesse-Kassel, her paternal great-great-great-grandmother, as well as Queen Victoriaâ€™s daughter Princess Louise. Louise of Hesse-Kassel was Queen of Denmark from 1863 to 1898 by virtue of her marriage to King Christian IX of Denmark.

Mary is a nod to the former Princess Royal Mary, Countess of Harewood and Sophie's mother, Mary Rhys Jones.

The Earl and Countess also opted out of giving their children Prince and Princess titles, instead going for Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn.

The pair have been kept out of the royal limelight throughout their childhoods, and are usually only seen at major events such as Royal weddings and Trooping the Colour.

Buckingham Palace has said her results are private and will not be made public.

She's also shared the sweet moment Louise realised who her gran was, telling the BBC: "It happened a little while ago. It was much more of a shock to the system.

"It was only when she was coming home from school and saying, 'Mummy, people keep on telling me that grandma is the queen,' and I asked her, 'Yes, how does that make you feel?' And she said, 'I don't understand.'"

Sophie added: "I don't think she has grasped that perhaps there was only one queen."
