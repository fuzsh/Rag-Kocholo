        "text": "A journey to Salvador Dali Museum in Figueres through his surrealistic world. The Theatre Museum opened its doors in 1974 being built on the site of the original theatre. Nowadays contains the world’s largest collection of his works with over 1500 exhibits starting from his earliest creations through to his surrealist period and up to the last years of his life.\n\nThe museum has over 22 rooms containing some of Dali’s most outstanding pieces, including Port Alguer (1924), the Soft self-portrait with Fried Bacon (1941), Poetry of America-The Cosmic Athletes (1943), Galarina (1944-45), The Basket of Bread (1945), Atomic Leda (1949) and Galatea of the Spheres (1952).\n\nNot to be missed is the world’s famous Mae West Room created especially by Dalí for the Teatre Museum, the Palace of the Wind room, and the Rainy Cadillac. Dalí conceived and designed everything in the museum as he wanted to offer the visitor a stunning visual experience and the opportunity to understand and discover his fascinating world.\n\nOur DALI Museum Tour includes tickets and guided visit to Dali’s Jewels Exhibition, now a permanent display at the Museum with their fantastic designs, drawings and paintings by the artist between 1932 and 1970.\n\nCalella de Palafrugell is a small fishing village on Costa Brava with whitewashed houses, good restaurants and fishing boats on the beach and into the water. The village runs along the coast over a series of small bays and coves. As a result there isn’t a single beach, but several different beaches. El Canadell and Els Canyissos are considered the most popular and good for swimming.\n\nCalella de Palafrugell is also famous for it’s July music festival called Cap Roig Garden Festival and its sea shanty festival named Havaneras."
