It was here where Salvador Dali had his first public exhibition. The theater was largely destroyed at the end of the Spanish Civil War and remained untouched for a long while.\n\nInterestingly, the idea for the museum came from the city's mayor at the time, who was eager to create a lasting monument to honor Dali's legacy. Dali was enthusiastic about the proposal and set about designing the museum himself. He spent several years working on the project and transforming the space into the surreal wonderland that it is today.\n\nAlthough the museum opened in 1974, Salvador Dali lived in the museum from 1984 to 1989, adding his personal touch to the building. In addition to the fascinating interior, the museum's exterior is also a work of art. At the center of the museum, there is a large glass geodesic dome which was designed by Salvador Dali himself, inspired by the geodesic designs of R. Buckminster Fuller. Dali's crypt is also located within the museum, making it a pilgrimage site for fans of the artist.\n\nDali Museum Architecture\n\nThe Dali museum is spread across three floors and features a wide range of rooms and exhibits. The museum was designed by Catalan architects Joaquim de Ros i Ramis and Alexandre Bonaterra, under the guidance of Dali himself.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the museum is the enormous egg-like structure that sits atop the building, adorned with golden heads. This symbolizes the birth of new ideas, a recurring theme in Dali's work. The centerpiece of the Dali Museum is the stunning cupola, a large glass dome at the heart of the museum, and it is made from over 1,500 pieces of glass. The museum's facade is also decorated with a red tower, which adds to the eccentricity of the design.\n\nMany of the doorways and corridors in the museum are painted in a way that blurs the line between reality and illusion. The museum includes a room dedicated to Dali's interest in holography, featuring a range of holographic works. The architectural style of the Dali museum can be characterized as surrealistic and provocative, reflecting Salvador Dali‚Äôs artistic vision and passion for science.\n\nTop Highlights Of Dali Museum\n\n1Mae West Room\n\nThe Mae West Room is one of the most unique features of the museum. It is shaped like a face of the famous actress Mae West, and is designed to be viewed from a specific spot, where it appears three-dimensional. The room is decorated with a variety of objects that have been carefully placed to create the illusion of facial features.\n\n2The Palace of the Wind Room\n\nThis room features a large-scale ceiling painting titled \"Central Panel of the Wind Palace,\" which was created by Salvador Dal√≠ between 1969 and 1973. The painting is based on the poem \"L'Empord√†\" by Joan Maragall which references the Empord√† region and the Tramuntana, the northern wind . The Palace of the Wind room is known for its stunning and unique artwork that depicts Dal√≠'s interpretation of the wind.\n\n3 The Rainy Taxi\n\nThe Rainy Taxi is an installation that features a life-size automobile with two mannequin occupants. The front seat of the taxi consists of a male chauffeur with a shark head, and the back seat has a female mannequin. Inside the cadillac, there‚Äôs a system of pipes that causes \"rainfall\" within the taxi, adding to the overall surreal atmosphere of the artwork.\n\n4The Swallow‚Äôs Tail\n\nThis painting is considered as Dali‚Äôs last painting and was completed in May 1983 as part of a series based on the mathematical catastrophe theory of Ren√© Thom. In the painting, each surface is incorporated alongside the curves of a cello, set against a gentle blue background.\n\n5Dali Jewels\n\nDali Jewels is a permanent exhibition at the Dali Theatre and Museum. The exhibition showcases Salvador Dali's unique collection of thirty-seven gold and precious stone jewels, as well as twenty-seven drawings and paintings made by Dali in designing the jewels.\n\n6Leda Atomica\n\nLeda Atomica is a painting completed by Salvador Dali in 1949. It depicts Leda, the mythological queen of Sparta, with a swan. The painting incorporates different objects such as a book, a set square, two stepping stools, and an egg that float around the main figure. The painting follows a rigid mathematical framework based on the \"divine proportion\" and is organized according to a compact and clear logical system.\n\nBest Time To Visit Dali Museum\n\nDali Museum Opening Hours\n\nThe Dali Museum in Figueres is open all year round, except on January 1st.

Having travelled to most of North India when I was a kid to backpacking across South India in my adulthood, I learnt that you often find your 'self' in the most unpredicted of places. And that is my inspiration to travel. To connect with nature, people and cultures. Books are my companion and I find my soul in trees. Music, yoga and literature is my passion. I often dream of attending a Peruvian wedding or living in a quaint Hungarian town for a while. When I am not writing, I would love to go hiking or explore the hidden valleys of Himalayas. Until then, some running and some literature is enough for me to get by!"
