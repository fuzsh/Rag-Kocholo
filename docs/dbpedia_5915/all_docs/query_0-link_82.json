        "text": "The Dalí Theatre and Museum is situated in the hometown of the renowned artist Salvador Dalí, Figueres, in Catalonia, Spain. This is where Dalí resided from 1984 until his death in 1989. The museum is a tribute to his life and work, and it is also his final resting place, as he is buried in a crypt below the stage.\n\nCollection\n\nThe Dalí Theatre and Museum boasts the largest and most diverse collection of Salvador Dalí's works. Visitors can explore a wide range of his creations, including paintings, sculptures, three-dimensional collages, mechanical devices, and other intriguing objects that sprung from Dalí's imaginative mind.\n\nOther Artists\n\nIn addition to Dalí's own works, the museum also showcases a selection of pieces by other artists that Dalí himself collected. A special gallery on the second floor is dedicated to the work of Antoni Pitxot, a friend and fellow Catalan artist of Dalí.\n\nMajor Works\n\nThe Dalí Theatre and Museum is home to the largest collection of major works by Salvador Dalí in a single location. Some of the most significant pieces include 'Port Alguer' (1924), 'The Spectre of Sex-appeal' (1932), 'Soft self-portrait with grilled bacon' (1941), 'Poetry of America—the Cosmic Athletes' (1943), 'Galarina' (1944–45), 'Basket of Bread' (1945), 'Leda Atomica' (1949), 'Galatea of the Spheres' (1952), 'Crist de la Tramuntana' (1968), and 'Dalí Seen from the Back Painting Gala from the Back Eternalised by Six Virtual Corneas Provisionally Reflected by Six Real Mirrors' (1972-73)."
