        "text": "“Do you think that in three years you will have forgotten this image,” Dali asked Gala in 1931.\n\n“Having seen it once, I could never forget it,” she replied.\n\nWhich image do you think they were discussing? Any guesses?\n\nThey were discussing Gala’s reaction to The Persistence of Memory. Do you remember this painting? Gala was never wrong in judging the “authencity” of an image, Dali said.\n\nAnd, so it is.\n\nPeople are drawn to it. They might often forget the image’s name (and call it something like The Melting Clocks or The Soft Watches), but not its content. Once seen, as Gala said, it cannot be forgotten. And, so it now has “Pole” position in the Dali oeuvre as “the most famous” of his paintings. Most Famous Dali Paintings\n\nDo you remember Dali’s melting clocks? Let’s find out: Take the Dali Familiarity Quiz\n\nIt is unsurprising – therefore – that a fortnight after visiting the Theatre when I ask my mind to remember, to give me highlights to share with you, that it darts to the most familiar first.\n\n#1: “The Permanence of Memory Tapestry” – The Most Iconic\n\nI don’t think that this is Dali’s most memorable work on its own, but as displayed in the Theatre, this icon merits a premiere spot.\n\nTo include it in the Theatre Museum, Dali had the painting reproduced, in thread, as a tapestry. His tapestry, bold and bright, stands like new, transcending the hazards of time, against a haggard, faded tapestry used as a mount.\n\nDali placed the tapestry in a priviledged position – over the headboard of his bed (acquired from a famous Parisian brothel) – in his apartment rooms located on the first floor of the Theatre.\n\nA golden, guilded gorilla skeleton stands sentry on the left hand side; a metallic bath at the bed’s feet (also acquired from the Parisian brothel) and a hand-painted sofa with cabinets of surrealist curios clutter every corner. In short, Dali’s bedroom is like a “Cabinet of Wonder” (a room for interesting collections) in the old world, bending time to present the curiousities afresh to the new world of today’s visitors.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nMoving from the most iconic to the most romantic, we need to travel backwards to the reception room called “The Palace of Winds,” and get our barings.\n\n“The Palace of Winds,” said Dali, represents his apartment. To the left is his studio with experimental works; to the right his bedroom (where we started!) – and in the middle, his “works”.\n\nWe are standing in the middle of the reception room, looking up. This is the room where Dali had his first exhibition, which was a local success and he never forgot. You won’t either when you enter. You can’t help but to look up and see the earth above you in the sky.\n\nWhere does that put you?\n\nThe visitor gets spiritually showered in golden goodness and pure light. This is explosive; it is the ‘super-happy,’ mystical ecstasy that Dali writes about.\n\nHere he used six large canvases to cover the high vaulted ceiling to convey and share the ethereal experience of a soul growing upwards.\n\nBoth Dali, in blue, with an empty chest of drawers and Gala, draped in a luxurious red robe, are “larger than life”. They support the world that has gone upside down. They are the world’s ‘crutch’ – providing spiritual support for the crippled world. Click Here for more on Dali’s ‘Crutch’ Symbolism\n\nAwe-some in its totality.\n\nSomehow one doesn’t feel dwarfed, but drawn in.\n\nThe most memorable, romantic, scene in the whole Theatre Museum – to me – is literally a footnote on the side of the ceiling. Below Dali’s feet is an image that I will never forget for its poetry: it’s Romantic idealism.\n\nLet’s creep in for a close up.\n\n#2: Gala and Dali Contemplating the Ship of Destiny (just about to set sail) – The Most Romantic\n\nDali and Gala sit side by side, his arm over her shoulder. They are small and barely visible in the low level clouds, but perfectly present. They watch through the clouds a theatrical performance – destiny, the ship, voyaging out on a smooth sail thru a rocky natural arch in the form of an empty sternum of a man (referencing the ‘love is never kind’ Labyrinth painting in the Cupola). Angels herald the journey with golden trumpets. Optimism permeates. True love and belief are the foundations of everything, it seems to say.\n\nThis is eternal, happy, and triumphant love. How does this painting rate in your opinon?\n\nTake the “Favourite Romantic Painting Poll”\n\nOh, and if you need a little art history revision: Click here for Historic Love Painting Images\n\n#3 The Mae West Room, The Most Popular Room in the Theatre\n\nI like to think that everyone doesn’t go for the obvious attraction… and certainly for size, and obvious magnitism, this is it. It is a crowd pull, if not pleaser.\n\nMay West’s big red lips (the saliva-sofa), the chimney nostrils and two eyes that run with the Seine…\n\nEveryone queues to climb the camel staircase to peek through the reducing lense on its back to experience its instantenous transformation and effect.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe lasting dream?\n\nDali said, “Instead of making a surrealist dream that you forget and which vanishes in just a quarter of an hour after waking, I have preferred to produce a dream that can be used as a living room.”\n\nI don’t really go for eye-catching novelties, and we are barred from lounging on the sofa in a continuous dream-state so it now lacks the ‘authenticity’ that Gala sought.\n\nHowever, I do go for the enigmatic Paradise, which one views through a tiny peephole when entering the room. It is lush and vibrant – a place where one cannot enter but wants to!\n\nI also love the less obvious bathroom hanging, almost unnoticed, from the ceiling, and the Venus de Milo with drawers… oh and the Retrospective Bust of a Woman (1933).\n\nI agree that the May West Rooms merits being the Most Popular room – but not for its eponym.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI do wonder as I watch people race about the museum what they see, and what they don’t.\n\n#4: The Anthropomorphic Face, The Most Overlooked Installation\n\nIt is easy to miss this installation! I don’t think that it is intentional that this is not a Dali work, but one of Antoni Pitxot and Salvador Dali.\n\nYou pass through it on one of the stairway landings (leading to the space with Pitxot’s works on permanent display) and unless you look back all you see are interesting details – cobs of yellow corn, red velvet, etc.\n\nOf course, your eyes are lured forward to see the provocative Fancy Dress costumes that Dali and Gala designed and wore to a Venice ball. The black, pointed, three cornered, traditional Spanish hats are – perhaps – a play on the Opera, The Three-Cornered Hat or Le tricorne, which the Ballets Russe made popular in 1916 – 1917. It is a tragic love tale of the innocent being murdered because of false appearances.\n\nLet’s not make that mistake – don’t miss the Anthromorphic Face!\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI will conclude with a rather odd ball notion.\n\n#5: Poetry of America (The Cosmic Athletes), The Most Dispairing Painting\n\nLet’s just say that – of course – not everything is black and white but a lot of things are. Particularly in cultural attitudes.\n\nDali painted The Cosmic Athletes in 1943 – whilst living in the United States of America, in sunny Monterrey, California. What a contrast between the natural (external) world and the manmade (internal) one.\n\nMy only comment is that whatever ‘sport’ the athletes were playing (some say American Football), there is definitely not a winner. Maybe Coke as it got it’s bottle centre stage?\n\nPlease let me know what you think (or have learnt) about this painting. It is an enigma to me.\n\nDon’t worry Reader! I will not end on that sad note.\n\nWe were soaring towards eternal happiness and heaven. Let’s continue, but I ask you to journey on your own.\n\nThe Magical Round Up Slide Show:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nHope to hear from you soon about your experience.\n\nPreviously in the Dali Theatre Museum series:\n\nWhat is a ‘Theatre Museum’ – Part V – The Treasure Room – A History of Art\n\nWhat is a ‘Theatre Museum’ – Part IV – The Cupola: Entering the Labyrinth\n\nWhat is a ‘Theatre Museum’ – Part III – Coin Operated Courtyard\n\nWhat is a ‘Theatre Museum’ – Part II – The Courtyard (Centre Piece) in the Dali Theatre"
