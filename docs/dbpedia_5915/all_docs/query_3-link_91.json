        "text": "The renaissance era was usually associated with aesthetic values, although it was much more than that. In terms of the paintings and drawings produced in the time, it focused on human nature. Portrait subjects varied from Greek mythology to those more historical events. Most common portraits consisted of late or wealthy patrons, and the artist focused on the details on the everyday life and embellished them. This reminded me of the infamous app, Instagram. Users would take photos of whatever they fancied and use filters to make their photo appear more ‘vintage’.\n\nOne of the most famous artists during this era was Leonardo da Vinci. His painting ‘Lady with Ermine’, was a lot deeper than what was painted upon the canvas.\n\nAs the picture shows, the ermine was actually a secret symbol for pregnancy. Her jet jewels were clues to her lover, the Duke of Milan, who was known for his dark skin. (Daily Mail UK, 9 November 2011) It is all these little details that bring depth into the painting and makes it more interesting.\n\nIn ‘The triumph of Galatea’ by Raphael, there is a love triangle within the busy yet romantic chaos. These bodies are all swirled around, very much different to the stiff poses by the Roman paintings.\n\nMichelangelo’s painting, ‘The Last Judgement’, was a massive composition done on the ceiling of the church. It was very overwhelming to look up and see these saints and angels above you. The effect of this was that of a transcendental awareness, and even though everyone was nude, it still felt very pure and natural.\n\nAnother well known name at the time was Jan Van Eyck. His painting, ‘The Arnolfini portrait’ showed this.\n\nThis portrait shows a mixture of reality and realism. Behind the couple, van Eyck put a statement, ‘Van Eyck was here’. (The National Gallery) This early form of graffiti exposes van Eyck for the proud, arrogant artist he is, but during the time, he was a powerful character to be able to paint for these wealthy patrons, and he wanted to show that. He believed in the saying, “As I can, not as I would.” Unlike van Eyck, there was another painter at the time that very little people knew about. He was Hieronymus Bosch. His work of ‘The Garden of Earthly Delights’ was considered the earliest abstract surrealism known during the Renaissance period.\n\nI really like how his work is fantastical, and the spaces are filled with things that do not exist, even though the title was ‘Earthly delights’. The monsters within the pieces are just so weird and wonderful. Adam Barker from BBC Two explains the piece in greater detail here. (BBC Two : Renaissance Revolution, 1 December 2010)\n\nLater in the renaissance, we can see the portraits getting less realistic but getting deeper in meaning. Such is Albretch Durer’s ‘Melancholia’. Durer was a renowned engraver, was especially known for his ‘Praying Hands’. ‘Melancholia’ were a series of prints, and they were meant to represent the end of the world due to the plague.\n\nThere are many hidden meanings embedded in this engraving. For example, one is the hourglass. It is meant to represent the passing of time and death. There is also a magic square and other mathematical apparatus within the piece. These were Durer’s early comments on science and religion. The angel sitting on the furthest right hand side is clearly looking depressed and unhappy, despite being surrounded by objects of knowledge, and it as though Durer is trying to say “The smarter you are, the more depressed you come”. The sheer burden held when you attain knowledge and intellect is overpowering, as shown an in the ‘Melancholia’. I guess that’s why they say, “Ignorance is bliss“. (Thomas Gray, 1742)\n\nReferences\n\nWilson, A N, Daily Mail Online, Decoding a da Vinci masterpiece: Behind the secret symbols of The Lady With An Ermine, 9 November 2011, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2059167/Leonardo-da-Vincis-The-Lady-Ermine-Decoding-secret-symbols.html#ixzz2mKgvOm14, (Accessed 2 December 2013)\n\nThe National Gallery, Jan van Eyck : The Arnolfini Portrait, http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/jan-van-eyck-the-arnolfini-portrait, (Accessed 2 December 2013)\n\nBBC Two, Renaissance Revolution, Hieronymus Bosch- The Garden of Earthly Delights, 1 December 2010, http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vmxzx, (Accessed 2 December 2013)\n\nReference.com, Origin of ignorance is bliss, 2013, http://www.reference.com/motif/society/origin-of-ignorance-is-bliss, (Accessed 2 December 2013)\n\nDuring a talk by Caroline Erolin, she spoke about the historical and contemporary aspect of medical art. It was interesting to find out the differences between art as a social depiction or commentary, versus the illustration and and reenactment for medicinal purposes. At the time of medieval astrology, “Astrologers believed that the movements of the stars influenced numerous things on earth, from the weather and the growth of crops to the personalities of new born babies and the inner workings of the human body.” (British Library). These doctors carried special calendars to check the positions of the stars before making a diagnosis. (British Library)\n\nOther medical arts include the diagram for Chinese acupuncture.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci in was well known in the renaissance era as a anatomist as well as artist, engineer and architect. His drawings at the time were considered a huge step in accuracy. His work is both scientifically correct and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nVesalius was another anatomist and was more famously known for his medical illustration Fabrica.\n\nA lot of people think that there is a great barrier between art and science, but in reality, some of the finest artists have been working with scientists and the collaboration has been there since the renaissance era (14th century – 17th century). Vesalius believed that in order to truly understand the human body, students must not rely solely on the teachings of elders, and should explore for themselves. “The only bodies legally available for dissection were those of executed criminals. Vesalius seized every opportunity he could to gather specimens. One day, he found on a country road a poor soul among many others who had been burned at the stake, and whose remains were in a condition ideal for study.” (University of Rochester Medical centre, 2013). The determination that drove Vesalius to encourage his students to discover for themselves earned Vesalius the name of “Father of Modern Anatomy”.\n\nThe level of intricacy of the human body grew and grew as centuries past, to the famous Gray’s Anatomy’s that we all know.\n\nIt is amazing to see how medical education has gone from the basic woodcuts to rough sketches, and now there is hyper realistic human bodies produced on Photoshop. There is even an app for cystic fibrosis, where it helps patients practice their everyday exercise regime so that they “adhere to their treatment”.(Cystic.Fibrosis.org, 2013)\n\nThere was another cystic fibrosis app created by one of the students from University of Dundee, Mark Alexander Roughley (Alumni DJCAD, 2010), but this app was more for patients understanding what cystic fibrosis actually is.\n\nThese examples of virtual anatomy reminded me of Gunther von Hagen’s Bodyworlds (Gunther von Hagen’s Bodyworlds, 2006-2013). Gunther von Hagen was a controversial German anatomist who is famous for preserving the inner body after death. He exhibits these bodies in different positions and the audience is able to view them in normal everyday activities.\n\nI think it is interesting that we find this sort of exhibition controversial, because the donors willingly give their body up in the name of science. It is a little odd and ‘creepy’ to see the bodies in such natural poses when they are quite dead. When I heard of this form of medical art, it reminded me of a Dove advert, where a forensic artist, Gil Zamora, draws women by how they look like based on someone else’s description, and also by how they describe themselves.\n\nThe women portray themselves as uglier versions of themselves, but when other people were told to describe them, the contrast was immediate. We as humans have little self confidence in ourselves, but we still tell others they are beautiful. I like how because we live with ourselves everyday and are used to the ‘dull, drab view’, outsiders can give us a more realistic version of ourselves. Image is everything I guess.\n\nReferences\n\nBritish Library, Medieval Astrology (12th century – 13th century), http://www.bl.uk/learning/artimages/bodies/astrology/astrologyhome.html (Accessed 29 November 2013)\n\nUniversity of Rochester Medical Centre, Health Encyclopedia, Andreas Vesalius, Father of Modern Anatomy, 2013, http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=1021 (Accessed 29 November 2013)\n\nCystic Fibros is important, Judges blown away by cystic fibrosis app, 2013, https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/news/latest-news/judges-blown-away-by-cystic-fibrosis-care-app.aspx (Accessed 29 November 2013)\n\nDuncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, Msc Medical Art – Alumni (Mark Alexander Roughley), (2012-2013), http://www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad/programmes/postgraduate/mscmedicalart/alumni/ (Accessed 29 November 2013)\n\nGunther von Hagen’s Bodyworlds, The original exhibition of real human bodies, Mission and Objectives, (2006-2013), http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/institute_for_plastination/mission_objectives.html (Accessed 29 November 2013)\n\n“Seeing comes before words”– John Berger, Ways of Seeing, 1972.\n\nThere’s always been a saying where “A picture paints a thousand words.” (Chinese proverb, 1996) There were 3 parts during the Medieval Period; the Early Period (c.500 – 1000), the High Period (c.1001- 1300), and the Later Period (c.1300- 1500). The evolution of abstraction was present in the medieval works.\n\nMy favourite part of the Byzantine period (c.500- 1453) was the mosaic piece of Christ and Empress Zoe in the Hagia Sophia museum. She was a bit like feminist art at the time, as she had 3 husbands. I suppose this is like the celebrity of the Medieval time, as each time she was remarried, the face of her spouse was ‘updated’ to the current one. The blue robes that Constantine the Great donned were reserved for special people at the time, and the fact that he has a startling resemblance to Jesus Christ, a halo around his head and a book shows off his wealth, knowledge and literacy, and that he could be considered a god. During this time, it was the Eastern part of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the Romanesque Period (c. 1000-1150), it was more of a Westernized part of the Roman Empire. This when they had started blending stories and characters from the Greek mythology, in order to convince the audience of Christianity and to read the Bible. One example was Orpheus,whom didn’t exist, but was painted in such a light as though he was Jesus. Again, this reminded me of Constantine the Great.\n\nSant Climent (c. 1123) was a painting with strong lines and bold colours, especially with the use of red (which is a power colour). There is sort of a naivety in the imagery in that makes it look unrealistic and kind of cartoon-ish.\n\nThe shape that Sant Climent is in comes up in many different religions, and is usually reserved for Christ of virgins. This unique shape derives from the intersection of 2 circles, and is the interdependence of the world and forces the coming together of heaven and earth. The shape actually reminds me of the female genital area, and since it means “Heaven on earth”, I’m sure some people can agree that this part of the female is like heaven on earth. Something interesting is that Gucci (1921) uses this shape in their logo, and again, I am sure that some people can agree that Gucci products are like heaven on earth, in a materialistic sense. It is present most commonly in the Hindu culture, where their gods are placed within the intersection.\n\nThe level of intricacy in artwork in the Insular Art or Hiberno Saxo Period (c.500-1170) reminded me very much of the Sarawakian wood carvings. These woodcuts almost looks Celtic. I find that the similarities between Insular Art, Sarawakian wood carvings, and Celtic patterns are uncannily precise.\n\nI think there is an unspoken rule in that the more intricate the design is, the more highly skilled the artist is, and this is very much present in these pieces.\n\nApart from being skilled in presenting the final images, I think it is important to be able to consider subject matter, because (pardon the pun) the subject matters. The painting Hellmouth or ‘Mouth of hell’ (c.1121- 11.61) described a scene where the damned were swallowed by a hell mouth (which was considered the entrance to hell. The creature that ‘swallowed’ the damned were of a strange green, and I suppose this was created as grotesque and horrifying as possible in order to scare people to pray. You can see an angel outside this entrance to hell and was locking the damned in, as though to say “once you are evil, you stay there forever”.\n\nAnother approach to get people to pray using imagery was the painting of the Funeral of Lucy de Vere (c.1125), a devout nun who died. She was drawn on a 19 foot scroll, and this scroll was manually taken to people around the village to inform them of her death. (British Library).For her death, she was drawn in a more refined, pretty and clean manner, very much the opposite to Hellmouth. Knowing that you worshipped God and was good meant that you were going to heaven, so this was a more gentle approach to get people to be more religious.\n\nImagery is used in many ways (as seen above) ; to create an ideal persona for others to view, to give meaning to symbols, to inform others of religion, and most famously, for illustrating stories.\n\nIllustrations accompany the stories, myths and fables so that we understand them, as well as remember them better. The oh-so famous illustrations of seductive sirens who cause many sailors to crash their ship into the rocks are myths, but we probably only remember the myth because we remember the imagery.\n\nBringing back the point of imagery being able to “make or break” the person, heraldic emblems (c.1200 -present day) do that. Heraldic emblems are sort of codes to the family, where the family have a graphic representation of their legacy. These are strongly graphic and sometimes symbolic.\n\nThis reminded of one of the comics from Asterix and Obelix (2013), Asterix and the Class Act, by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderz, Pilote magazine, 2003. In the comic page “Obelix’s Family Tree”, there is an illustrated heraldic emblem of Obelix’s family tree, which consists of his favourite thing, wild boar. He was notoriously well known for his appetite for roasted wild boar and speech “These Romans are crazy”.\n\nThe idea of codifying myths and fables with imagery really intrigued me, and I found an example of a music video which did exactly this.\n\nThis video was about a cultural myth in Bolivian legend, where “a deaf boy fled from his abusive home and found a stray dog that accompanied him since then. After living on the streets for an undefined amount of time. he discovers that he has special talent of perceiving people’s troubles, which he can heal by screaming, which is said to be as loud as an earthquake and a tornado. One day, he finds an old man who is being stoned by villagers while being taunted and ridiculed. By screaming, the boy resolves the situation and revives the old man’s heart (in the video, by buying him a new heart). Together, they meet a disfigured man who was abused, considered a leper by society. The disfigured man reveals that he is a prophet who was cursed by a demon (El Tio) because he didn’t worship him anymore, and abandoned the society where the demon resided. El Tio is considered as the lord of the underworld, to whom mortal people offer gifts in exchange for protection, or to ease his anger. The prophet said anybody who could hear the demon would fall under his control. He told them the demon could be found in desert, where there once was a town in which people worshipped the demon and he cursed them to kill themselves. Together they go to the place where the demon should reside. They arrive at a mine where the demon is supposed to be, but everybody with their hearing intact could be cursed by the demon, thus the boy had to face the demon alone and overvoice him with his scream to stop him from cursing others.\n\nThe video ends with an open end, considering that El Tio is the lord of the underworld who rules in the mines, which were of use for people for a prolonged period of time, whom miners sacrifice a llama from time to time to avoid from being cursed, the boy could be seen as a big sacrifice to redeem the miners from El Tio’s undesirable influence.” (Wikipedia, 2013).\n\nThe imagery is being portrayed in a neutral light, unlike those before where it was clear that we would get undesirable consequences to be ‘bad’, and a much happier setting if we were good. At the end of the day, it is what we believe in as well as the image we give ourselves to think about that makes all the difference.\n\nReferences\n\nPhrases, The meaning and origin of the expression: A picture is worth a thousand words, 1927, http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words.html (Accessed 28 November 2013)\n\nBritish Library, A medieval death, c.1225 , http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126543.html (Accessed 28 November 2013)\n\nRené Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, Asterix and the class act: Obelix’s Family tree, 2003, Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote, 29 October 1959\n\nWikipedia , La la la (Naughty Boy song), 2013, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_La_(Naughty_Boy_song), (Accessed 28 November 2013)\n\n“Animation offers a medium of story telling and visual entertainment which can bring pleasure and entertainment to people of all ages everywhere in the world.” – Walt Disney\n\nFollowing the quote by Walt Disney, animation is synonymous with storytelling. The very definition of animation derives from the Latin term ‘Anima’, which means ‘soul’ and ‘breath of life’. I think this fits what animation is all about, as animation is bringing static images and characters to life.The very act of animation allows for the story to be told, from different angles.\n\nSteven Millhauser once said that ‘animation was a crafty illusion based on the accidental property of cinema… and the animated cartoon was a poetry of impossible…to let the impossible stream in…the world was nothing but an editorial cartoon.” (1943) Again, this links back to the idea that the act of animating allows things that cannot be done in real life.\n\nAnimation is not just a modern day present thing, and like all things, it started from ancient times. One of the earliest forms of animation was from an earthenware pot that had 5 images of a goat jumping up to eat leaves off a tree.\n\nWhen the pot was spun, you could actually see that it was animated. I think that illustrations, graphic design and animation are all linked in the sense that animations are moving illustrations, and graphic design are simplified illustrations.\n\nAnother example of the idea of animations being moving illustrations is the thaumatrope. The thaumatrope is a simple device that plays with the eye. The retina holds 1/10th of a second image, which causes the brain to think it is seeing a single moving image. This is the same concept with the thaumatrope.\n\nThis was progressed into the zoetrope. The zoetrope was created by William George Horner and is essentially a circle of drawings in a cylinder with slots. Again, when the drums in the zoetrope are rotated, the image is animated. Going back to the definition of animation, it is as though it is the circle of life.\n\nPixar created a 3D zoetrope, inspired by the Studio Ghibli zoetrope. This was essentially similar to the zoetrope that was first created. The only difference is that there is strobe lighting so there is no need for a moving stage.\n\nThaumatrope and the zoetrope. This led to the invention of the zoopraxiscope, praxinoscope and kinetoscope, following to the creation of the optical theatre. The zoopraxiscope allowed for there to be more than one point of view. I can see how this came to the idea of lightning sketches. Lightning sketches were as the name suggested; quick sketches that were rapidly modified into an animated piece once played. The idea of lightning sketches was created by James Stuart Blackton, an American film producer.\n\nLightning sketches remind me of ‘Draw my life’ videos, where individuals draw significant objects or scenes from their lives in rapid motion.\n\nOne of Blackton’s most famous lightning sketches was “The Enchanted Drawing”. These have humorous phases and introduce the idea of silent comedy in black and white. These were the traditional comics. Looking back, I really like the hand drawn images compared to the 3D characters that we have on the screen today. Hand drawing gives off the sense of loved labor and you can really see the difference in the feel of the character.\n\nThe computer generated animations however, are sharper, cleaner and more professional looking. To each their own, and it depends on the person at the end of the day.\n\nhttp://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/213/b/c/hand_drawn_animation_loop_by_vanipy05-d42cb0q.gif\n\nDuring the summer, I was researching deeper into Graphic Design to find out what it was all about. There seems to be an argument on what Graphic Design actually is, and especially how it is more about computers than anything else. In order to uncover the truth about this I started with the basics, to question what exactly is Graphic Design. According the Oxford dictionary, graphic means relating to visual art; especially involving drawing, engraving or lettering. The origin of graphic comes from the mid 17th century via the Latin word (from Greek graphikos) from graphé which is “writing, drawing“.\n\nDesign from the Oxford dictionary, meant a plan or drawing produced to show the look and function, or workings of a building, object, or garment before it is made. It could also be something to do with a specific purpose in mind. Design came from the late Middle English time as a verb in the sense to “designate” from Latin word designatus based on “signum“, which means “mark“.\n\nSo actually, Graphic Design means the writing and drawing that makes clear and detailed marks to that specific purpose or function in mind. This has nothing to do with computers, because before computers existed, graphic designers existed, and they were still able to create work and get jobs as current graphic designers do now.\n\nThere was one designer I was very keen on looking into, by the name of Alphonse Mucha from the Art Nouveau era. Art Nouveau was an international philosophy and movement of Art that was popular during 1890s to 1910s. “Art Nouveau” is French for a “new act”, and this was certainly true as Art Nouveau was said to be the first 20th century modern style. I like how the style is less realistic, yet still very beautiful, and they are able to transform the most ordinary of blooms into parts of great masterpieces.\n\nArt Nouveau has a specific style, and after gathering multiple images of works from that era, I have found that:\n\na) There are a lot of elongated curvy lines.\n\nb) These lines would be whiplashed.\n\nc) The flowers, leaves, roots, buds and seedpods are stylised.\n\nd) Female forms take centre stage, in Pre-Raphaelite poses and flowy hair.\n\ne) For furniture and jewelry, artists use exotic woods, iridescent glass, silver and semi precious stones.\n\nf)There is a lot of intense detail and precision.\n\ng) The works are very beautiful and feminine.\n\nSome famous names at the time were Aubrey Beardsley (although he did not conform to the idea of femininity and preferred to work in monochrome ), Charles Rennie Macintosh, Louis Rhead, and of course, Alphonse Mucha.\n\nAlphonse Mucha was a Czech painter and graphic designer. When he was a child, he had witnessed the defeat of the Austrian Empire by the Prussians, and watched as the emaciated bodies from the cholera epidemic were thrown into common graves outside the town. Perhaps because of this, he was determined to make his work beautiful and glorious and dream-like, in order to hide the ugly side of his hometown.\n\nAs Mucha was surrounded by music ( he was given a choral scholarship at the age of 12),it just emphasized his love for beautiful things. Despite being expelled from school for a poor academic performance, it did led him to be to be a professional artist for a local church. Mucha was very much taken aback by local artist Jan Umlauf’s work (1815 – 1916) and the fact that he was able to make a living through painting. It was then and there that Mucha decided to be a professional painting. In 1880, Mucha was employed as a scenery painter in Vienna, at a theatre design company. Having a background in scenery painting (pardon the pun) gave Mucha an edge as he could understand the importance of what was behind the character. In nearly all of his works, his background is often seen to be harmonizing with the main character. It is always soft and beautiful, and not overpowering the main female lead.\n\nWhat is interesting is that Mucha’s eye for detail is incredible, and even spans for being modern. The collar detail on “Champagne” is similar to our modern day fashion trend; statement necklaces. This was just something small I noticed that really piqued my interest.\n\n2 artists that come to mind when looking at Mucha’s work are illustrator Shirley Barber and fantasy artist Linda Ravenscroft. I have personally read Shirley Barber’s books, and her illustrated fairies are as delicate and beautiful as Mucha’s own. Like Mucha, she favours the graceful movement of the women and decorates them. Mucha’s style is that he outlines his women more prominently whereas Barber’s are more soft and blurred. Linda Ravenscroft’s style is more mythical and fantastical.\n\nI experimented with Mucha’s style, emphasizing his love of detail and nature.\n\nMucha also included his own typography in his posters, which I quite liked and wanted to incorporate into my own work. These images are from my sketchbook, and I’ve just done little experiments with watercolour pencils and ink.\n\nSalon De Cent was a monthly publication which featured creative arts like poetry and illustrations. Mucha was invited to design a poster for their 20th Salon De Cent.\n\nAlthough Mucha’s works didnt seem very graphical, he was clever in his approach and made it look effortless and elegant. One of Mucha’s most famous pieces were his “Job” cigarette poster. He was commissioned to design a poster for the company “Job”. “Job” was actually the initials of Jean Bardou, who invented a booklet of rolled rice paper. Because of the natural product used by Bardou, Mucha used subtle and natural ‘woodsy’ colors in the poster. Originally, the initials “J B” were separated by a diamond ” J ◊ B”, but it was referred to “Job” once the popularity of it grew. Because smoking was very much a man’s activity at the time, Mucha’s poster of a sensual woman smoking gave the product a sense of glamour.\n\nI really like how the diamond fit in with the woman, as women are usually associated with diamonds and finery. Mucha made the poster look glamourous and less feminine and this was easy to appeal with both sexes. The men would want to smoke around this woman and have her face in ecstasy, and the women would want to be seen like her, as a sensual fox and attract the opposite sex.\n\nThis poster, amongst many, show that graphic design isn’t just about sitting down at a computer and producing accurate and clean pieces of work. It is about thinking about the client, the product, and also how to be witty and work with what is given. Alphonse Mucha is a big inspiration to the creative industry as he hits all aspects in his art.\n\nReferences\n\nMucha foundation, http://muchafoundation.org/ (Accessed October 2013)\n\n“It’s not the technique, it’s the idea”– Hiraki Sawa, 2013\n\nHiraki Sawa recently came to Dundee to give a talk on his latest project regarding the Dundee Observatory Mill. He is a Japanese video and sculpture artist based in London. He arrived in 1996, at the age of 18. He has a BA from the Arts School in Essex, where he specialised in video art. His works are mainly incorporated with wide open spaces, where he projects his video onto the walls. I like his videos are like moving surrealistic images. Hiraki’s work have been on show in many different countries like Shanghai and New York.\n\nHis early Essex work in 1998 were not actually video work, but rather sculpture pieces. This was because he had enrolled in a sculpture course. His first piece was a modern building site with skyscrapers made out of old paper. He wanted to play with the idea of shadows and how they change. In order to make the light to create the shadows, one would have to cycle a stationary bicycle, and the electricity energy that comes from the dynamo in the bicycle would generate light. The light would move all around a circular rail track that surrounded the buildings and create shadows. This was called “Moon”, and one of his earliest pieces.\n\nThe rest of Hiraki’s works were based on public interaction. For example, his second year’s work was called “Sun”, and in order for this sculpture to work,people would have to put their heads up this sphere, where it was surrounded by mirrors. Natural sunlight would come into the sphere and one could see the light with their head in this giant contained sphere. However, in Essex it was cloudy and Hiraki had to replace natural sunlight with a red laser beam.\n\nFor his final year, he stacked up about a hundred cardboard boxes and there were some windows in the boxes made out of tracing paper. Behind these windows was a projector, projecting a moving image of vapour trail in the sky, once someone picked up the solitary box on the floor. Once picked up, the projector would be activated, and the lights would come in on the windows. Although this project was not as complex as his last few, it was kinetic and time based.\n\nAfter graduating from art school, Hiraki took a hiatus from his work and spent a year taking photographs of airplanes in Heathrow. This was a childhood love of his, and took pictures almost every week. I asked him what was the significance of planes in his work, and he explained that when he was young, his grandmother used to take him to the airport every time he was upset. There would be a new flight path every other week, and he would sit with her for hours on end until the planes had left and he had cheered up. He then returned to Slade School of Art and Design, but again with a Sculpting course.\n\nHis work here were mostly airplane related, but he lost heart with the creating of sculptures. A friend changed his life (literally), by asking him to help with some animation work. He taught himself how to use the video editing software and found that it came to him quite easily. He then continued to do menial tasks for his friend, in order to understand how animation worked.\n\nHis first video, “Dwelling” was created in 2002, and he was immensely happy with it. When I watched it for myself in the DCA theatre, I was enthralled how these toy airplanes had life in them, and flew in domestic flight patterns. This video had a surrealistic feel about it, in the sense that these tiny planes of all shapes and sizes were flying about his apartment, making real sounds whilst still landing in that bumpy path they usually do. Because there were no other sounds apart from the airplanes, the video felt longer than 9 minutes. I really liked how the film was in black and white, as it had a nostalgic feel about it. The video ended with a real plane flying off in the distance, which was playing with the idea of sizes.\n\nAlthough he was happy with his work, a Korean curator advised him on how to present his work, as he did not want Hiraki to be presenting his works on plain walls. By responding to the gallery space, it would make his videos more interesting, and I think because Hiraki has a background in Sculpture, he knows how to incorporate his work with his surroundings.\n\n“Elsewhere” was his next video, and this was really entertaining as regular household objects suddenly sprouted legs and strolled around the kitchen, bathroom and living room in a casual manner. I really liked how these objects had realistic human legs, each different to the next, and it just gave a really comical feel to a serious black and white film. What I also liked about it was that some objects (for example the teacup) had a slight limp to its walk, and this was interesting as everybody has a different style of walking.\n\nIt reminded me of how a child lost something, the adult would reply sarcastically, “Oh, I suppose it grew legs and moved itself!” This video was very playful, and I especially liked how the scissors was running because as children, we are always told to not run with scissors, and yet, it runs! There was even a flying book, which instantly reminded me of Alice in Wonderland, by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (known as Lewis Caroll) (1865).\n\nHe then created “Airliner“, a flipping book with the airlines going in their respective flight paths. Although his work is simple, it radiates of childish indulgence and naivety and innocence and I really like that. I really enjoyed his talk and exhibition, as he is an inspiration in the sense that our passion can really bring us places.\n\nA selection of his work can be found here.\n\nReferences\n\nCarroll, Lewis.
