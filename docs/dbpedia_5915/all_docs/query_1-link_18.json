        "text": "A detailed look at a full day tour of the museum and home of the legendary artist of surrealism Salvador Dali . . .\n\nThis Website Contains Affiliate Links\n\n​During my time in Barcelona, I was fortunate enough to take part in a tour that guides the visitor through the life and times of Salvador Dali. In one day we would view his museum, childhood town, and the house that he would later design.\n\nA Look Into the Mind of an Artist\n\n​Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dali y Domenech was born in Figueres, Spain in 1904. With his eccentric flare of artistic ability, he would go on to become one of the region's most famous artists, as well as the single most influential figure in the style of surrealism.\n\nTeatre Museu Dali in Figueres\n\nAfter an early morning departure from Barcelona, our first destination was to be the Salvador Dali Museum. This extravagant display is located in the town of Figueres, which is situated in the Costa Brava region of Spain. The building itself is a work of art, letting the visitor know just what they are in store for. Inside, every aspect of this place pays homage to the late artist.\n\n​From the moment you approach the entrance, you will realize that you are being transported into the mind of a genius. The layout can be a little confusing, but be sure to explore every inch of it, as many of Dali's notable works are stored within this labyrinthian castle. Each twist and turn will reveal something more intriguing than the average mind can comprehend.\n\nWithin these walls you will find some of Dali's most famous paintings such as The Persistence of Memory. Many other artistic designs are also incorporated into the surroundings. Though some may think of it as chaotic, I felt each item fit perfectly into place. If you venture downward, you will even find the artist himself entombed in the basement. It would be easy to spend hours wandering through this place, and I would have done so if I had been on my own time.\n\nDali's companion and muse, Gala provided the inspiration for female figures in many of his works including the Galatea of the Spheres. Another acquaintance that would find himself portrayed by the artist was Pablo Picasso. Dali and Picasso had a relationship that resembled somewhat of a rivalry. Young Salvador had been partially influenced by the already famous cubist, but thought his work to be ugly. This was expressed in the strange depiction of his artistic counterpart. Interestingly enough, Dali also painted himself in such an unflattering manner.\n\nDali's Portrait of Picasso\n\nDali's Self Portrait\n\nAfter exploring the museum, I had just enough time to take a walk around the block, quickly browse a shop, and grab an empanada. The area surrounding the museum seems really nice, with much to offer. I would love to go back and spend a couple of days exploring the town of Figueres a little more.\n\nOnward to Cadaques\n\nSalvador Dali grew up in the small coastal town of Cadaques. Much of his younger years were spent marveling at this natural scenery that would provide running themes for much of his art. It was here the tour stopped for lunch and gave us the chance to explore around a bit.\n\nA statue of Dali seems to preside proudly over his childhood town. Nearby is another interesting monument you won't want to miss. This master of surrealism seemed to have a fascination with Lady Liberty, so Dali's dual fisted version was installed to serve up a double dose of freedom to the residents and visitors of this charming little town.\n\nAcross the Hill to Port Lligat\n\nIn the tiny coastal village of Port Lligat, we finally arrived at the home of Salvador Dali. Here we would have the opportunity to thoroughly explore the artist's home and grounds. I will now take you on a tour of Dali's inner realm.\n\nAround each corner is something peculiar. At the entrance you are immediately greeted by a taxidermized, yet rather enthusiastic looking polar bear, while a small flock of birds await happily in the library.\n\nWe were guided through the house one section at a time. The inside is arranged in multiple split levels with rooms ranging from a typical looking bedroom to a circular conversation chamber with a very bizarre echo effect.\n\nOne of the most interesting rooms in the house was the place where Dali would create many of his masterpieces. The artist designed this contraption that was capable of moving the canvas up, down, and sideways as he sat comfortably in his chair.\n\nOutside you will find a rather suggestively shaped swimming pool in an area designed for the outdoor entertaining of guests. As the pathway winds on, you are taken up to higher grounds to get more of a bird's eye view of the property.\n\nFrom here we had a rooftop view of the ocean, as well as one final display of the artist's strange preoccupation with eggs. Continuing along the path, at the top of the hill was a small building that acts as a theater showcasing films about the artist. I would soon be making my way back to the van, taking in one last look at this unusual landscape knowing that these memories would last a lifetime. All thanks to the great Salvador Dali.\n\nAfter the day was done, it was explained that the tour changes with the seasons. At times the house is off limits, so this portion of the tour may be substituted with a visit to Gala's tomb. No matter what season you find yourself in Catalonia, I highly recommend the Salvador Dali Tour. It is absolutely guaranteed to satisfy the surrealist in each of you."
