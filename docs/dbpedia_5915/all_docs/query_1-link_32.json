        "text": "BARCELONA, Spain — In 1969, Salvador Dalí, the Surrealist painter, gave a derelict castle to his Russian-born wife, Gala, as a present. She welcomed his generosity but also set rules for her new home in Púbol, a village in Catalonia.\n\nGala stipulated that her husband could visit the castle only if he had received a written invitation. “Sentimental rigor and distance — as demonstrated by the neurotic ceremony of courtly love — increase passion,” an acquiescent Dalí later wrote.\n\nThe peculiar visiting ritual ordered by Gala is a well-known anecdote. But much else about Gala’s life, ambitions and desires remains unclear or subject to conflicting accounts, which probably explains why it has taken until this month for a museum to devote a full exhibition to her, even though she shared — and shaped — the lives of several key artists of the Surrealist movement. The exhibition, “Gala Salvador Dalí. A Room of One’s Own in Púbol,” runs through Oct. 14 at the National Art Museum of Catalonia, in Barcelona.\n\nThe show presents Gala as someone willing to play the secondary role of muse and model, but also eager to forge her own path as an artist. Gala “always felt more comfortable in the shadows but, like Dalí, she also wanted to become a legend one day,” said Montse Aguer, the director of the museums of the Gala-Salvador Dalí foundation, which co-organized the show."
