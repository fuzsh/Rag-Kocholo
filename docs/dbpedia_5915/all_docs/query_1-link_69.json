        "text": "Galatea of the Spheres is a painting by Salvador Dalí made in 1952. It depicts Gala Dalí, Salvador Dalí's wife and muse, as pieced together through a series of spheres arranged in a continuous array. The name Galatea refers to a sea nymph of Classical mythology renowned for her virtue, and may also refer to the statue beloved by its creator, Pygmalion.\n\nDalí had been greatly interested in nuclear physics since the first atomic bomb explosions of August 1945, and described the atom as his \"favourite food for thought\". Recognising that matter was made up of atoms which did not touch each other, he sought to replicate this in his art at the time, with items suspended and not contacting each other, such as in The Madonna of Port Lligat. This painting was also symbolic of his attempt to reconcile his renewed faith in Catholicism with nuclear physics. His friend, painter Antoni Pitxot, recalled that Dalí held in high regard the depth of perspective in the painting and the spheres he had painted.\n\nDalí wished for this painting to be displayed on an easel, which had been owned by French painter Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, in a suite of three rooms called the Palace of the Winds (named for the tramontana) in the Dalí Theatre and Museum in Figueres. It remains on display there to this day. It was transported to and exhibited at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne in 2009, along with many other Dalí paintings in the Liquid Desire exhibition.\n\nAvailable as a gallery wrapped unframed canvas panel or framed stretched canvas in a variety of sizes\n\nAll frames are made from responsibly sourced wood and are made in our Nottinghamshire workshop.\n\nSIZING\n\nSizes refer to the canvas image area. Gold and Silver Frames are approximately 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches deep. The unframed canvas panels are approximately 1.5 inches deep and the image is mirrored on all 4 sides. Rolled canvas has an additional 2-3 inch white border on all sides."
