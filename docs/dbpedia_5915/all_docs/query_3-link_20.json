        "text": "I was staring at a basket of bread.\n\nIt was perfect. Technical and visual perfection. All the cracks and crumbs and crevices. Toasted but soft. The bread came out of the page, the shadows and painted shading daring everyone who saw to touch it. To try to take a bite.\n\nSalvador Dali’s painting Basket of Bread is not one of his most fantastic works. Not by a long shot. But as I faced the painting at the Dalí museum in Figueres, Spain, I couldn’t look away. A simple heel of bread on a table had captured my attention.\n\nThis was the theme as I went through the entire Dalí museum, fascinated by his art, enthralled by it, nearly moved to emotion. I could stare at a single painting for ages. It is one thing to view his paintings online. Seeing them in person, with brushstrokes frozen in time and ripples of paint visible on the page, is a whole new ballgame. Each is more jaw-dropping than the last.\n\nEven if Dalí’s specific brand of ultra-surreal surrealism isn’t your thing, one look at Basket of Bread, or even the stranger ones like Galatea of the Spheres or The Madonna of Port Lligat, and you won’t be able to deny he was a technical genius. The more paintings I saw, the more I wanted to learn more about him."
