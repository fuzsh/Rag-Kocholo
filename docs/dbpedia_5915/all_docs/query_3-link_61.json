        "text": "The Art History tells us that the avant-gardes broke with all classicism and Raphael’s star has waned at the end of the 19th and 20th century. The cult of classical antiquity no longer dominated western culture; classical perfection was almost abhorred. However, Picasso, the main breaker, after his Cubist period, was inspired by classicism, especially by the Raphael’s Madonnas. In 1917 Picasso traveled to Rome to design sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev’s famed Ballets Russes.\n\nPablo Picasso. Mother and child (1921). Art Institute of Chicago\n\nDeeply impressed by the ancient and Renaissance art of that city, he began painting monumental figures inspired by antiquity and by Raphael. And he fell for him. Picasso states: “Leonardo da Vinci promises us heaven, Raphael gives it us.” Picasso drew like Raphael (and Ingres). He saw the beauty and dignity in Raphael’s grace and recreated it in his maternities. One of the best examples is Mother and Child. The subject was due to Picasso’s own life. Just three years earlier he had married Russian dancer Olga Khokhlova, and in 1921 their son Paolo was born. Between 1921 and 1923 he produced at least twelve maternities that remind us Raphael.\n\nJonathan Jones has linked the Raphael’s fresco The Fire in the Borgo with the Picasso’s Guernica. He affirms: “Picasso profoundly admired Raphael and the way he painted the pity of war in Guernica owes a lot to his study of Raphael”.\n\nPablo Picasso. Guernica (1937). Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid\n\nPicasso quotes the fresco in Guernica. The entire setting of the right-hand part of the painting, which Picasso made in 1937 to protest at the fascist bombing of the Basque town, is explicitly based on a Raphael fresco in the Vatican: “In The Fire in the Borgo, Raphael is suddenly not celebrating harmony. He is, shockingly, mourning its absence. As a building burns, a woman hands her baby down. In Guernica, Picasso shows the same burning building, a woman screaming in the flames.”\n\nLoggias\n\nRaphael. Christ Charge to Saint Peter (1515-1516). Cartoon for tapestry. Victoria&Albert Museum, Londres\n\nAnother one on display is The Prophets Hosea and Jonah. While in Vatican, Raphael received a commission from his leading private patron, Agostino Chigi, to decorate his family’s chapel in the church of Santa Maria della Pace in Rome. Both the subject –prophets and sibyls- and the powerful and muscular figures were responses to Michelangelo’s contemporary work in the Sistine Chapel. This preparatory study shows part of the decoration to one side of a second-story window. This drawing, with its carefully developed figures and grid for design transfer, would have been used to create the cartoon- the detailed, full-scale model used as a final template to the fresco itself.\n\nPortraits\n\nRaphael was one of the famous portraitist of his days, yet there is no such thing as a typical Raphael portrait. Almost everyone he painted, embodies the portrayed own personality. He combined realism with human ideal. Thoenes writes “He paints not just the likeness of his sitters but also the relationship he enjoys with them. Observation is married with personal involvement, different in each case. His portraits are dialogue: this make them overwhelmingly suggestive, but also- paradoxically enough- creates distance.”\n\nÀngels Ferrer i Ballester\n\nI dedicate this post to the architect, the so-called “curin” Rafael Jiménez. I could say that I dedicate it to you for your great artistic sensitivity, for your grace and sweetness and kindness similar to that of the master who bears your name. But in addition to this I dedicate it to you for your natural kindness, for your unconditional dedication to the people who need it the most and the help that I am sure you give them in these difficult times of unknown pandemic.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland, April 2020, the year of the coronavirus pandemic"
