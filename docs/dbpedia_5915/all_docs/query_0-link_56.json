        "text": "Dalí's love for his Galatea was legendary, and there is little doubt that her influence can be seen in all his work. She was ten years older than he, a strong personality in her own right, and his fiercest critic and protector. And for him, she was the subject of every work. When she died before him, the air went out of his creative tires.\n\nOne of Dalí's most successful, experiments with the interplay between mirrors, painting, and photography. Note the surprise of Dalí's face.\n\nDalí was obviously familiar with Europe's \"great art\" and the enduring (and sexy!) mythological tales that suggest great art, of which the Leda-and-Zeus-the-swan is a favorite. It's a great excuse to paint a nude woman. All women, touchingly, were Gala to Dalí.\n\nThe Dalí Museum in Figueras hangs more than Dalí, but later practitioners of \"Dalísmo\" -- which is whatever the curators say it is. Here, it is a series of strikingly well painted \"slate-lichen paintings\" that \"copy\" great Spanish Art in an intriguing yet curiously mocking way. This one mocks the innumerable stiff Grandees that stuff the Louvre and the Prado.\n\nAnother work I ached to photograph but could not -- poor lighting, no-flash rule -- was by an American, a surprisingly life-like and attractive but unremarkable sculpture of a female nude in a glass case. The photograph I wanted was of the ardently attentive viewers, in particular a statuesque beauty in white whose clothing was more revealing than the statue's nakedness -- a point Dalí would have been happy to make."
