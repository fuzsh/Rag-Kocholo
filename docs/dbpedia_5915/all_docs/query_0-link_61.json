        "text": "I live in Ireland and my son is living and working in Sydney and with the coronavirus pandemic happening globally all post to Australia from Ireland has been suspended. So for my son’s birthday this year I decided to get a 24” x 16” “Photo on Canvas” done for him of a picture of Sydney at sunset from “Watson’s Bay” I took myself when vising him last year (this picture is very special to him). I looked at all the providers of this service in Australia and finally chose Canvas Prints Perth and boy am I so glad that I did.\n\nI had a few technical issues at the outset and the help and assistance I received from Sally in Canvas Prints’s Australia at that time was exceptional. She ensured that the finished product matched my expectations and went out of her way to ensure that everything went smoothly. I have attached a picture of the “Photo on Canvas” to this review and according to my son (who is absolutely delighted with it) the picture doesn’t do justice to the finished article which he describes as “brilliant”.\n\nI can only say that I will be forever grateful to Sally and all the team at Canvas Prints Perth for all that they have done.\n\nI cannot recommend canvas prints australia enough!! From a visit to Australia 2yrs ago a friend had a print on stretched canvas which I absolutely loved, managed to find said print at Canvas Prints Perth, after realising delivery might occur while being away I contacted them to see if I could pay for express delivery and being in the UK there is of course the time difference well that didn’t seem to matter to Sally as she quickly responded to my request at gone midnight! I honestly can say I have never experienced such quick and friendly responses before! I now can’t wait to hang my stretched canvas print up! Thank you again Sally and canvas prints australia!!\n\nIm writing this review just to let you know how fantastic the service was I recieved from Canvas Prints Perth. I ordered 3 paintings on canvas by Leonod Afremov from Canvas Prints Perth a couple weeks ago. The pictures were delivered so quickly and I was’nt expecting them untill weeks later. This is because I had the pictures custom made with float frames and on top of that lived in a remote country region in a different state of australia. A big big thankyou to Sally who assisted me at Canvas Prints Perth. After sending her a photo of my space in the lounge for advice on what canvases might look nice to hang she also suggested the canvases would look great with white float frames. I was also amazed on how great the communication was. Sally always responded back to me within hours of sending an email to her and it was the same late at night and over the weekend. Im so very happy with the canvases and look absolutely wonderful hanging in the lounge. They definetely complement and complete the space. It is now my families favourite spot to sit in our home. Absolutely love them. One very happy girl “Thankyou Canvas Prints Perth”"
