        "text": "When Dalí was in his second year at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, he felt that the board of examiners were not sufficiently qualified to judge his knowledge and decided to withdraw from the art history examination. The Academy, in turn, chose to expel him. The topic in question was Raphael, the painter Dalí most admired and who he continued to revere for the rest of his life. This attitude coincided with the moment at which the young painter was searching for his own identity, whether through his physical appearance or by shaping his personal style. He had known of and admired Raphael since he was a boy, as Anna Maria Dalí wrote in her book Salvador Dalí as Seen by his Sister: \"A colour reproduction of the Madonna of the Chair by Raphael hung above his bed\". References to the painter born in Urbino, one of the best known Renaissance artists, would continue to crop up throughout Dalí's career, and in his writings, we find countless examples that reveal how Dalí found much of his inspiration in Raphael.\n\nAfter the experimental and surrealist period of his youth, Dalí decided to take his work in a different direction with the aim of \"becoming a classic\". During his stay in the United States in the 1940s, his artistic production began to reflect the powerful influence of his favourite artist. Dalí found a great source of inspiration in Raphael's paintings, particularly the Madonnas which in many cases he copied. This period also coincided with a crucial moment for Dalí, when prompted by the detonation of the atomic bomb in 1945, he developed a powerful interest in physics, particularly the atomic and subatomic world. Above all, it was from 1951 -the year he wrote his Mystical Manifesto- that Raphael's Madonnas would begin to appear in his works, mingled with elements taken from the world of nuclear physics.\n\nWhile for the Renaissance artists the main aim was to faithfully portray the reality around them using perspective, Dalí wanted to go a step further and, using optical illusions and visual effects, he attempted to create the third and fourth dimensions. During the final years of his career Dalí focused his attention on stereoscopic works and holograms, in which the presence of Raphael still shines through."
