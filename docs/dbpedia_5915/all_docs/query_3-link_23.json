        "text": "Salvador Dali was born May 11, 1904 in the small Spanish town of Figueras. Salvador had an older brother that died none months before he was born, also named Salvador. The second Salvador was seen as the reincarnation as the first, and this is why his parents chose to name him Salvador. Told this by his parents, Dali admitted later in his life that \"the ghostly memory of this lost sibling\" was to haunt him until he died (Biography). His parents saw Salvador as their second chance, and so he was spoiled growing up.\n\nWhen he was just ten years old, he began to paint, and around thirteen years of age, he was painting with astounding talent. Early in his life, his parents and also some friends of the family, the Pichot, encouraged him. This family was full of artistic people, but it was Pepito Pichot, the patriarch of the family, that influenced Salvador most. At this point, his parents also encouraged this interest in art by converting a room in the house into a studio for Salvador to paint in. During this period, Salvador was painting in an Impressionistic style. Most of his works were of the landscapes around his province of Catalunya. He started to have exhibitions of his work; the first one was arranged by his father when Salvador was thirteen years old.\n\nAfter a few more shows, Salvador started studying under the tutelage of Juan Nunez in 1918, at the age of fourteen. He experimented with Impressionism and Pointillism. In 1921, the same year that his mother died, Salvador entered the San Fernando Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid, where he became part of the young Spanish artistic elite. He started experimenting with Cubism while his peers were still studying Impressionism, which he had already mastered. Dali was seen as an odd personality around campus. The San Fernando Academy suspended him in 1923 on charges of inciting a riot against school officials. In 1924, he was imprisoned for five weeks on charges of government subversion. He returned to school in 1925, only to be expelled a year later because he refused to take his final exams. Salvadors father disowned him because of his pattern of outrageous behavior. After serving nine months in the military, Salvador traveled around Europe. It is this period in his life that was the most influential in his work.\n\nBetween 1928-1929, Salvador first read Sigmund Freuds The Interpretation of Dreams. His study of Freuds theory of the unconscious is what led him to become one of Surrealisms best painters. This is the style that he is best known for, although he experimented with Impressionism, Pointillism, Cubism, Futurism and Metaphysical painting. Miro introduced him to the French Surrealists, led by Andre Breton. He was also introduced to Gala Eluard, who was married at the time to the French poet Paul Eluard. The two fell in love instantly; Gala became Salvadors friend, companion, manager, lover and muse. She was his only female model and shows up in many of his pictures. They were married in a civil ceremony in 1934.\n\nIn 1930, Salvador expounded his Paranoic Critical method of thinking. This thinking process is the ability to simulate a paranoid state and paint the images that are seen while in that state. Dali called these \"hand painted dream photographs.\" These Surrealist paintings feature \"wild juxtapositions of animals, objects and biomorphic shapes, usually placed in the harshly lit landscapes of his native Catalan\" (Salvador Dali Prints).\n\nBetween 1934-1937, he had a formal break with the Surrealist group. The reasons given are many; according to Fine Art Painting Gallery, his political views (including the support of General Franco) and his desire to adopt a more traditional style led to his expulsion. Art Cult says that his fascination towards Hitler was responsible for the break. Salvador Dali Prints says that it was Dalis betrayal of his old friend Luis Bunuel; in his autobiography, Dali described Bunuel as an atheist and a communist, which resulted in Bunuel being fired from his job at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Whatever the reasons, Dali began to focus on more traditional and universal themes.\n\nIt is during this period that he also began to dabble in all sorts of types of artistic expression, in addition to painting. Between the late 1930s and the early 1980s, Dali wrote novels; he designed sets, costumes and wrote plots for ballets and plays; he designed jewelry; he collaborated on movies and cartoons; he contributed to journals; he illustrated books; and he sculpted. Dali also experimented with new types of visual art, like holograms and stereoscopic installation pieces.\n\nIn 1964, Dali was awarded the Grand Cross of Isabella the Catholic, one of Spains highest awards. After developing palsy in 1980 and suffering the death of his true love, Gala, in 1982, Dali went into a deep depression and severely decreased his artistic output. Spains king, Juan Carlos, gave him the title of Marques de Dali de Pubol for his contribution to Spanish culture the same year. In 1983, he painted his last picture, The Swallowtail, and in 1985 Dali started designing a plaza for the city of Madrid. The square was built in 1986, and consists of the one ton sculpture Homage to Newton. For the next few years of his life, Dali lived quietly in an apartment next to the Teatro Museo, the museum that he opened in Figueras. After his death in 1989, he was buried in a crypt in the Teatro Museo and his estate was divided between the cities of Madrid and Figueras."
