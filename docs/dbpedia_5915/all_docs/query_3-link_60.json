        "text": "“The unexpected. . .” has been my response to photography in Paris. This photograph was no different, captured while strolling the hills of Montmartre with a writer friend. As we were talking, we came upon this French, modern-day version of Carmen Miranda—large vintage glasses, headdress with a bow and fruit, red hair, red lipstick, pineapple earrings, sleeveless yellow vintage dress on a sunny, warm day at a busy café. What caught my attention were the tattoos—up to her chin, neck, arms, chest adorned with detailed pictures—and a huge smile. Irresistible.\n\nI had been living and working in Paris for three months in the spring of 2017, having exchanged apartments with a Parisian artist friend. I spent my time painting in his studio, formerly a horse stable, and photographing the unexpected daily. Every place has a certain sensibility. Paris possessed sensuality, which was evocative in its architecture, language and people. This was all embodied in the image of the tattoo woman on this hill of Montmartre.\n\nAt the moment, I am living in Barcelona for six months and photographing the unexpected in this vibrant city of Gaudi, Miro, Dali and Picasso. All the places I visit or inhabit have their own faces, and I am captivated, intrigued and curious by the differences and commonalities of what it means to be human.\n\nA New York City native, I have lived in Brazil for two years, Mexico, Brittany, Italy and France for several months. Currently, I am working on a project of images I photographed of Auschwitz and the city of Krakow.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lindakessler_/\n\nMarch is Women’s History Month. We are so popular in March! The Riverside Library in New York City, the Harlem School of the Arts, County College of Morris—all so interested in women artists in March! That’s a good thing. Let’s celebrate that! It has made us all very busy, organizing prospectuses, painting, printing, delivering, having receptions, and running here and there. I sincerely hope those of you reading NAWA News have gotten a chance to see at least one of the March exhibitions, Ev(e)olution VIII—Migration, SHELTER, and Open Horizons are a feast of wonderful artwork. And in the NAWA Gallery, a group of six members mounted their own show, “Celebrating Women!” Every one of these is a show to be very proud of!\n\nThis flurry of activity will be followed in April in the NAWA Gallery by “Painting the Corners- Three Women Artists Step Up to the Plate.” Marisol Ross, Susan Miller-Havens and I, are showing baseball-themed artwork, celebrating the players, the action, the national pastime that continues to captivate the American spring and summer gamers across the country. We are Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and New York Mets fans assembled in one Gallery! How ecumenical! I am personally very excited about this show, a wholly different theme for our gallery. You may ask, “Why?” Please come to the show and I’ll explain it to you.\n\nOur Annual Luncheon will follow in May, and we are very proud to present the artist Joanne Mattera as our keynote speaker. Ms. Mattera is well known for her chromatic work in encaustic. She is a painter, writer, blogger, and author of The Art of Encaustic Painting: Contemporary Expression in the Ancient Medium of Pigmented Wax. I always look forward to the luncheon event as it is a fine opportunity to dine and share social time with the members. I hope you will all plan to come and bring a guest!\n\nYours in creativity,\n\nJill Cliffer Baratta, MFA, NAWA\n\nNAWA President\n\nSusan G. Hammond:\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, women gained acceptance and received recognition for\n\ntheir craftwork—stenciling, needlework, embroidery, cards, crocheting, making patterns\n\nand clothing, making pillows and ornaments—but not for fine art. It was believed by\n\nmany that serious consideration of the work of women artists could only be recognized\n\nwhen it was shown in significant quantity to demonstrate that creative achievement\n\nneed carry no sex distinction.\n\nOn January 31, 1889, five women artists (Anita C. Ashley, Adele Frances Bedell,\n\nElizabeth S. Cheever, Grace Fitz-Randolph and Edith Mitchill Prellwitz), met in\n\nFitz-Randolph’s studio and established the Woman’s Art Club. It was not a social club\n\nbut rather a group that provided women the opportunity to display their artwork.\n\nThe Women’s Art Club set out to invite all professional women fine artists to join the\n\ngroup. They formed a jury to choose work for their first annual exhibition.\n\nIn 1890, the first annual exhibition took place at the Berkeley Athletic Club in New York,\n\nthe second at 9 East 17 th Street, NYC. The third and most acclaimed show was held at\n\n9 West 10th Street, NYC. This 10 th Street location was down the street from the famous\n\nTenth Street Studio Building, the heart of the New York art world at the time.\n\nThis exhibition included the artwork of nearly 300 women artists in a wide range of\n\nmedia including: oil painting, watercolor, pastel, etching and crayon drawing. This show\n\nwas not exclusively for members nor only for women artists in NYC. It included work by\n\nnational and international artists. The catalogue includes Mary Cassatt, who lived in\n\nParis at the time, a “Miss Bertha, Art of Brussels,” and Louise Bresleau of Paris.\n\nEach successive Annual Exhibition drew praise and important reviews.\n\nThe Woman’s Art Club closed the 1890s with its ninth annual exhibition at the National\n\nArts Club on 37 West 34 th Street, NYC. Membership had doubled, and women artists\n\nstarted to receive awards and recognition for their fine art work.\n\nBriAnna Olson\n\nBriAnna Olson is a film and video artist, director and producer currently residing in New York City. Inducted into NAWA in November, 2017, she is a busy innovator having created and directed live video art projections and music videos for chamber-pop band Gem Club and performing with them at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In collaboration with filmmaker Michael Pope, she co-wrote and directed a one-man show that had a month-long run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Her media projects have included works for Girl Scouts of America, Sony BMG, Children’s Hospital Boston and a film commission for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Her independent creative studies have taken her to Iceland, Mexico, Berlin, Egypt and Tehran.\n\nQ & A with BriAnna Olson:\n\nQ. How did your passion for art begin taking shape for you—at home, school, a mentor? What other artists inspired you? Is there a personal experience that started the fermenting process?\n\nA. Warner Brother’s Merrie Melodies was certainly a big inspiration for me in terms of the study of color, motion and rhythm, as well as Disney’s animated feature films. And seeing the visual command of Michelangelo Antonioni opened a new world of possibilities for me.\n\nQ. How would you describe your artwork in terms of materials or mediums? Has it changed or evolved since formal training, and what are your goals for it?\n\nA. I would say I am a video artist first. Second, I am an assemblage artist, and third I am what I call a circuitous found object. That’s a good way to sum what I am doing at any given time. I’m very inspired by the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze. I plan to keep experimenting and hope to continue to project my work in big spaces.\n\nQ. Has being a woman affected your work and others’ perception of it? How do you feel about being part of a woman’s art organization?\n\nA. I think my looking is decidedly a woman’s, and people see this. My work is haunting and enchanting in a feminine way. I’m honored to be a part of National Association of Women Artists.\n\nJanet Indick\n\nCongratulations to Janet Indick for her 2017 Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award. Ms. Indick is a contemporary sculptor who explores the expressive possibilities of steel, other metals, wood, and clay in abstract sculpture for indoor and outdoor sites. Her exhibits include many solo, juried and invitational exhibitions in New York, New Jersey, and other states. Internationally, her metallic sculpture has been on exhibit in museums in Germany, Paris, Poland Finland, Canada, and Scotland. President of NAWA in 1997-1998, her vision was to give the artists more opportunities to show their work by offering both juried and non-juried exhibits in museums, colleges, and corporations all over the country. She added that “it is always important for NAWA to grow and adapt to new challenges in technology.” As an artist and a woman, she reacts to nature, art, architecture, music, history, and current events to create her metal sculptures. She transforms rigid raw materials by manipulation of simple geometric shapes. “Like a choreographer, I connect these parts into a fluid whole that exhibits movement, energy, symmetry and balance. Themes of creation, nature and biblical stories, as well as heroism, humor and the holocaust are recurrent in my works.”\n\nJoanne Mattera\n\nJoanne Mattera paints in a style that is chromatically resonant and compositionally reductive. She has had solo shows in New York City at the Stephen Haller Gallery (1995) and OK Harris Works of Art (1996 and 2007). In recent years, she has participated in exhibitions at DM Contemporary, the Elizabeth Harris Gallery, and Margaret Thatcher Projects. Her 30th career solo, Silk Road, took place in 2015 at Kenise Barnes Fine Art in Larchmont, New York. I Always Return to Hue followed the next year at Arden Gallery, Boston. Mattera’s paintings and works on paper are in the collections of the New Britain Museum of American Art, Connecticut; Montclair Art Museum, New Jersey; University Collections, State University at Albany; Connecticut College Print Collection; the U.S. State Department; and institutional and private collections.\n\nMattera also writes and curates regularly. Her popular Joanne Mattera Art Blog offers a visual look at exhibitions and art fairs in New York City and elsewhere. Her most recent curatorial efforts include Depth Perception, a 19-artist exhibition that considered dimension in physical or implied space for the Cape Cod Museum of Art, 2017 and A Few Conversations About Color, a visual discourse among seven artists, for DM Contemporary in New York City, 2015.\n\nMattera divides her time between Manhattan and Massachusetts. She is a member of American Abstract Artists and exhibits regularly with them.\n\nwww.jmresume.blogspot.com\n\nwww.joannemattera.com\n\nwww.joannematteraartblog.blogspot.com\n\nShipping Dos and Don’ts\n\nYou may have heard stories about artwork shipping disasters—sculptures getting lost in the mail, frames breaking or falling apart etc. When having an artwork shipped, you can avoid the most common mishaps by following the recommendations below.\n\nPack work with adequate padding. Use a box slightly larger than the artwork, so there is not much room for movement. DO NOT USE PEANUTS. Use enough bubble wrap to secure the art. Bubble wrap is great for padding your art, but it should not touch the actual paint, especially if varnished.\n\nUse a box no more than 3” inches larger than your piece on all sides. Add a thicker, stiffer layer of protective cardboard if possible. This inner layer of cardboard is going to create a second layer that will greatly diminish the possibility of having a foreign object pierce or scuff your artwork. The second cardboard layer will also help absorb shock if the package is dropped. NAWA does not have much space to store boxes, so larger ones than necessary present a problem for us.\n\nShipping watercolors, photography, prints, or anything else behind a panel of glass is another challenge. Artwork behind glass is almost infinitely more difficult than shipping anything else. Glass is so susceptible to cracking in transit that some carriers refuse to insure anything that involves it. Use extra bubble wrap.\n\nPrepare a good, sturdy box. Even a brand new box is going to show signs of wear and tear when it arrives at a gallery. But using an old box is inviting trouble. You are also sending a gallery a message if you show them that you feel the artwork isn’t worth the cost of a reliable box.\n\nWe’re all on budgets, but do not skimp on packing tape for your art. Packing tape is important. Buy the best you can afford. Use large “fragile” stickers on every shipment. The freight company might not pay much attention to them, but they will make you feel better.\n\nJust like any other shipment, use the tracking number to monitor your artwork in transit and estimate its arrival time. Though it happens rarely, you’ll be glad to have this information if your artwork shipment is delayed or headed to the wrong address. Always include a return shipping label. If it is not addressed to you, please write your name on the box with a marker. This helps identify into which box to return the artwork.\n\nIt is standard practice to buy insurance when shipping artworks or any other high-value item. The costs vary depending on the artwork’s worth, weight, and size. Insurance is an added but necessary expense. It ensures that you will be reimbursed if something happens while your artwork is in transit.\n\nShipping artwork can be a challenge and a frustration, but it has actually never been easier to ship. With the right tools, supplies and shipping procedures, you can ship your artwork safely and efficiently.\n\nCompiled by Susan B. Phillips\n\nNAWA Gallery Coordinator, 2018\n\nI am proud to be leading NAWA’s Massachusetts Chapter into its fifth year. NAWA’s history, mission and longevity impress me deeply. I was thrilled to be accepted to this historical organization of women artists in March 2014. The NAWA chapters are an important way to extend the organization’s reach as it allows members outside of NY to participate more frequently in exhibiting their works and supporting our mission. I work with an incredible board of dedicated, hard working, and talented women who assure the success of the chapter.\n\nIn reflecting on the beginnings of the Massachusetts Chapter, Nella Lush was instrumental in bringing it alive with founder Liliana Moonie in 2013. She worked tirelessly in building a hard-working board of directors and cultivating members.\n\nAs a new member, I worked with the exhibitions committee. A curated exhibition was proposed and accepted at South Shore Art Center. Shortly thereafter, I was invited to join the board of NAWA MA. The show was reviewed in Artscope magazine and received good local publicity.\n\nOne of the pivotal exhibitions that included NAWA MA members was Strokes of Genius: Women in the Arts, Past and Present at Rockport Art Association and Museum. It included past artists such as Cecilia Beaux, Emma Fordyce MacRae, Marie Danforth Page and Elizabeth Wentworth Roberts, founder of ConcordArt. American Art Review magazine covered the show, and a catalog was published.\n\nSuccessful exhibitions gave the MA Chapter greater visibility. We forged a relationship with Artscope magazine which enabled us to advertise our exhibitions, our members, and call for artists to apply to the chapter.\n\nAt the time, the calls for entry, images and list of works were all being kept by hand, which was labor intensive. Through my work experience at South Shore Art Center, I was using Smarter Entry to handle calls for entry, Constant Contact to keep in touch with our membership, and Paypal to collect various fees. Research on implementing these applications to streamline our own process was set forth to the board. We had meager funds to work with, but after thoughtful discussion, we took a leap of faith and signed up with Smarter Entry and Constant Contact. This has eased the record keeping and allowed us to move forward with more exhibition opportunities. It was a big step for us as it allows more members to easily participate in the local shows.\n\nOur roster of exhibitions in 2018 has already included Thompson Gallery, Weston, Wedeman Gallery, Lasell College, Galatea Fine Arts, @artlery160, Boston. Future exhibitions include @artlery160 at Harrison-Lobdell Gallery in Saratoga Springs, NY; Trustman Art Gallery, at Simmons College and Hess Gallery at Pine Manor College, Chestnut Hill. We continue to explore more venues.\n\nThis spring, we will offer our first scholarship awards! We continue to cultivate relationships with artists in the community, arts organizations, educational institutions, and galleries. This has been rewarding in so many ways, and we have met amazing people who support the organization as a result.\n\nThe Massachusetts chapter has grown to over 125 members and our “Social” events are an opportunity for members to meet, share ideas and network with one another. We are optimistic and excited for what the future will bring.\n\nRadical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985 at the Brooklyn Museum (Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art and the Morris A. and Meyer Schapiro Wing)\n\nSomething very significant “south of the border” is brewing at the Brooklyn Museum and we think you should know about it. It is the first exhibition to explore the groundbreaking contributions to contemporary art of Latin American and Latina women artists during a period of extraordinary conceptual and aesthetic experimentation. Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985, on view from April 13 to July 22, focuses on their use of the female body, ranging from painting and sculpture to photography, video, performance, and other new mediums. Many works were realized under harsh political and social conditions under which these artists prevailed.\n\nOrganized by the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles and in Brooklyn by Catherine J. Morris, the Sackler Senior Curator and Assistant Curator Carmen Hermo, the exhibition features more than 120 artists from 15 countries, including such innovative artists as Lygia Pape, Ana Mendieta, Marta Minujin and many others, who should be at last out from under the radar and in the spotlight.\n\nIt’s been a real pleasure to see the emails we’ve received from our inaugural quarterly newsletter requests—you’re an inspiration to all our NAWA membership. We’ve received a flood of responses for your solo and two-person exhibits, as well as other news you wanted to share.
