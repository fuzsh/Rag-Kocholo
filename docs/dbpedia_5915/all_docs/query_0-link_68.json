        "text": "During the week of Oct. 8 to Oct. 12, the Media Center hosted an art exhibit featuring work by Salvador Dali, a Spanish surrealist painter. According to media specialist Andrea Lamphier, Dali's art was selected in order to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. The exhibit, planned by the media specialists and the world languages department, encouraged students to learn about Hispanic art and analyze artwork through various activities. Throughout the week, teachers brought their classes to the Media Center to participate in the activities.\n\nAmong the paintings displayed in the Media Center were \"The Persistence of Memory,\" which depicts the relativity of space and time, and \"Galatea of the Spheres,\" which demonstrates Dali's passion for science and disintegration of the atom. The exhibit also showed videos about Dali and how to analyze forms of art.\n\nLamphier hopes the exhibit provided students the experience of viewing art in a museum-like setting. \"We want students to stand in front of reproductions of art, understand its history and use the skills necessary to understand how to view art critically,\" she said."
