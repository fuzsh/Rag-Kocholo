        "text": "“With this exhibition, the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya and Fundació Gala-Salvador Dalí intend to reveal Gala: muse, artist and a key figure in twentieth-century art. Companion to Dalí and before that, to the poet Paul Éluard, admired sometimes, sometimes ignored or slighted, Gala is undoubtedly a key figure of the vanguards. Without her, the surrealist playing board is missing a piece. Paintings by Max Ernst, photographs by Man Ray and Cecil Beaton and especially the works by Salvador Dalí are much more than portraits: they make up an autobiographical journey where, as a postmodernism heroine, Gala imagined and created her own image.\n\nMoreover, this exhibition will also allow us to follow Salvador Dalí’s evolution as a painter and brings together a significant collection of his works, some 60 in total, including oil paintings and drawings. The exhibition will also present a selection of paintings, drawings and photographs by other artists who were part of the surrealist universe, such as Max Ernst, Picasso, Man Ray, Cecil Beaton and Brassaï. An interesting collection of letters, postcards and books will also be on display for the first time, as well as dresses and objects from Gala’s personal boudoir. In total, the exhibition will present approximately 180 pieces that reconstruct Gala’s complex and fascinating character.\n\nThe exhibition will unveil a Gala who camouflaged herself as a muse while forging her own path as an artist: she writes, imagines and creates her own image, in addition to playing an essential role in Dalí’s artistic development.” — Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya\n\nExhibition is organized and produced by Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, Barcelona, and Fundació Gala-Salvador Dalí. Curated by Estrella de Diego, professor of Art History (UCM)\n\nImages courtesy Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya."
