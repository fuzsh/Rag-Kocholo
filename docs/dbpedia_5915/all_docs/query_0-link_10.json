        "text": "Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dali i Domènech, better known as Salvador Dali, was an incredibly creative, passionate, ingenious and eccentric artist, who based his art in the surrealism movement.\n\nHe was born in Figueres, Catalonia in May the 11th 1904 and was a genius ahead of his time. He spent his childhood in the Empordà, an area close to the French border.\n\nPersuaded by his mother, he found a taste for painting during his summer holidays in Cadaques. He studied in Madrid, became friends with Federico García Lorca; he then moved to Paris where he met Pablo Picasso. He had a strong influence from Spanish phttps://www.winenium.com/product/heights-winery-and-cadaques/ainter Diego Velazquez, who painted El Greco, Las Meninas amongst some, and so, he acquired a Velazquez style moustache.\n\nHis artwork include pieces like “The Persistence of Memory” with the melted clocks; “Galatea of the Spheres” a female face made with circles; “Mae West Lips” red sofa. Some of these may be found at his official home, named the Dali Theatre Museum, only 2 hours away from Barcelona; a perfect day trip from Barcelona, whilst on holiday.\n\nThe Dali Jewel exhibition next door, includes a display of 37 fine and exquisite jewellery made in gold and precious stones. It is located at the rear of the same building and it has a separate entrance. Pieces such as “The Eye of Time” is a clock inside a blue eye with a dropping tear; “The Royal Heart” is a amazing piece which has an inner ticking real looking heart inside a romantic shape of a heart.\n\nDali purposely created and decorated this building during his lifetime, for it to become not just his museum, but his mausoleum.\n\nVisiting The Dali Theatre Museum is an opportunity to have a sense for the place, experience and admire the artwork of one of the most influencing artists of surrealism, an emblematic artist of the 20th century.\n\nCheck our experiences in the area:\n\nWine, art & Dali experience with Winenium is a visit to the Dali Theatre Museum, vineyards and wine taste visit and a wholesome Catalan lunch, with a pick up from your door.\n\nHeights winery & Cadaques experience with Winenium is a visit to a wine cellar laying in the most fantastic setting in the Cap de Creus natural park and a visit to Cadaques, Dali´s summer holiday spot where to have the best seafood meal in the Costa Brava, with a pick up from your door."
