        "text": "Running the projector was the film’s creator, a thirty-four-year old former textile salesman named Joseph Cornell. His film, Rose Hobart – a re-edit of East of Borneo and named after that movie’s leading lady – combined scenes from the jungle melodrama with stock footage and other shots from unidentified films. Cornell showed the film at ‘silent speed’ (slowed from 24 to 16 frames per second), projected it through a blue glass filter, and replaced any traces of the original soundtrack with samba music, played from a record he had bought at a flea market. Even today, watching Rose Hobart is like finding yourself in a weird dream, the kind you wake from clawing the nightstand for a pen and paper. In the past month I’ve probably watched it at least a dozen times.\n\nThe film opens with a crowd gazing at an eclipse (a scene that is not in East of Borneo), then immediately cuts to a tense encounter between the movie’s romantic leads and crackles to a blank screen. Three seconds later, it restarts in disconnected sequences showing Rose asleep; wandering through palm-filled rooms; standing on a balcony; being courted and menaced in a lavish palace, and in one bittersweet scene, confiding in a captive monkey. Cutaways to a candle flame, moonlit clouds, windswept palms – shots which usually signal plot points or segues – disengage these scenes even further, and our focus shrinks to Rose. The film’s pace and swaying accompaniment compel us to follow her, but as she reacts to characters and events we cannot see, her experiences appear more and more discrete, each enclosing the next like Chinese boxes. The more we look for narrative causality in Rose Hobart, the less we find any.\n\nTilly Losch (made around 1935 and titled several years later) features a Victorian girl floating above the Alps, suspended by delicate strings, as if she were not only travelling aboard an unseen balloon, but actually suspended from it, like a gondola. In A Dressing Room for Gilles, Cornell suspended Pierrot by a single ribbon within a narrow, mirrored box surrounding Watteau’s clown with harlequin reflections. Then, in an untitled homage to Tamara Toumanova, he imagined the Russian ballerina as a deep sea explorer riding a nautilus shell, crowned with a spirula. And in one of the first Soap Bubble Sets (his longest running series) seashells appear on glass discs ‘bubbling’ from a clay pipe, like specimens under a microscope. His iterations of hot-air balloons, ballerinas, stars and seashells reflect key interests, but also a fascination with certain abstract and metaphysical concepts, such as enclosure, suspension, and transcendence.\n\nArguably, Cornell’s talent lay not in his hands (he never drew, painted or sculpted anything, per se), but in his eye and his grasp of the associative power of words and objects. He explored Manhattan and the outer boroughs like Atget in nineteenth-century Paris, his senses attuned to the ephemeral, looking for the small, overlooked or discarded details that seen in the right context describe the whole.\n\nHe wrote down his daily experiences in notes, diaries and letters. He collected photographs, postcards, maps and charts, advertisements, bits of typography, lines and articles cut from magazines and books, and countless objects gleaned from job lots, manufacturing surplus, warehouse clear-outs and rubbish bins.\n\nWhat’s more, he catalogued everything, not according to any conventional hierarchy or taxonomy, but by type (‘watch parts’, or ‘cordials’ for the tiny glass goblets he used), or by correspondence to certain symbols or narratives (‘centre of the labyrinth’ or ‘childhood regained’). Late at night, at his kitchen table and later, his basement studio, he drew words, images and objects from this vast archive of unwanted stuff and arranged them in glazed wooden boxes.\n\nPartly inspired by his friendship with Tamara Toumanova (whom he’d seen dance the role of Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty), in Setting for a Fairy Tale, he transformed his usual display cabinet into a proscenium opening onto a tiny, coherent stage set. His magic castle is a photostat reproduction of a sixteenth century engraving, and behind its cut-out façade, a black backdrop throws a forest of painted twigs into sharp relief. He added to the illusion of depth by enclosing the castle within a shaped black frame painted onto the glass. Finally, bits of mirrored glass in the window frames draw us into the work only to wink back reflectively, making us accidental performers in an imagined drama.\n\nCornell made at least nine of these palace constructions, perhaps because he not only understood how fairy tales endure in adult psychology, but that their resonance is part of our shared experience and not, as some surrealists argued, a sort of secret knowledge. His use of coloured glass to cast a unified glow over disparate objects and particular fascination with Sleeping Beauty encourages us to look for dream logic and symbolism. We root through these works like an old shoebox pulled from under the bed, and as we do we time travel, looping between actual recollection and nostalgia. Cornell couldn’t have read The Uses of Enchantment, but these boxes illustrate one of Bruno Bettelheim’s key theories: fairy tales endure because they reflect our innate desire to become better people.\n\nEssentially, Cornell’s boxes preserve specimens of an idealised past, a logical progression from his bell jar objects. But certain recurring architectural themes suggest he imagined them as more than vitrines. In 1933, inspired by a handful of stereoscopic slides, he wrote a kind of screenplay, Monsieur Phot, a collection of scenarios set in a hotel involving a fictional nineteenth-century photographer and his struggles to capture life in still images. Cornell never made the film, but a few years later, he made Object: Hotel Theatricals by the Grandson of Monsieur Phot Sunday Afternoon.\n\nEven more minimalist is his homage to the pilot-inventor, Louis Blériot, where with only a watch spring, some doweling and a bit of blue stain, he evoked the Frenchman’s hand built biplane and the ocean waves it crossed. Around 1942, Cornell met Antoine de Saint-Exupéry during the two-year period he lived in the United States. The two men became friends, and Cornell’s dossier of notes, clippings and ephemera dedicated to Saint-Exupéry includes several sketches for the book, including one of The Little Prince himself, drawn on a cocktail napkin.\n\nCornell had read Saint-Exupéry’s memoir, Wind, Sand and Stars, where he described how flying for Aéropostale - via notoriously dangerous routes between North Africa and France - opened his eyes to the nature of friendship, solidarity and the meaning of life in a world that increasingly ignored humanity. He described the world as ‘a wandering planet’, limned by coasts and schisms, behind which nevertheless ‘lies something vaster … a path, a portal or a window opening on something other than itself.’\n\nWhile Cornell’s own geography remained fixed, he shared Saint-Exupéry’s ageless curiosity and faith in the transcendental. What’s more, like the Little Prince, he never recognised hierarchies. He valued everything as being part of the warp and weft in a greater whole, and never developed a ‘grown-up’ sense of the generic. Stars could be celestial bodies mapping time and space or flesh-and-blood film stars, but neither definition had precedence. As the Little Prince tells the Pilot, stars are just tiny lights to most people; to travellers, they’re signposts, and to scholars, merely problems to solve: ‘but those stars are silent … You, though, you'll have stars like nobody else... since I'll be laughing on one of them, so for you it'll be as if all the stars are laughing.’\n\nCornell has been called a recluse or even an ‘outsider’ artist, but this is inaccurate or just flat-out wrong. Shy and self-taught, he neither married, nor aligned himself with any particular group. But he knew, befriended and exhibited with Abstract Expressionists, Minimalists and Pop Artists, and eventually he became a kind of lodestar for the American avant-garde. Most of the time he met friends, colleagues, curators and critics one-on-one at his home on Utopia Parkway in Queens. He befriended Duchamp, Pavel Tchelitchew, Dorothea Tanning, Lee Miller and Yayoi Kusama, made films with Stan Brakhage and Rudy Burckhardt, exhibited with Isamu Noguchi, shared his archives with Walter de Maria and Robert Whitman, and mentored Lawrence Jordan. He granted few interviews, but was invariably described as a gentle, generous, witty, intensely perceptive man with a weakness for cheap pastry and long Proustian digressions.\n\nThe additional shots (i.e. none is in East of Borneo) are the opening crowd scene; a close up of a candle flame; light behind clouds (repeated and expanded); a splash with ripples (repeated and expanded); windswept palms (various); a chalice, and an eclipse. These shots bookend Cornell’s film, and interspersed with Rose’s reactions and encounters, build a second world around her.\n\nWe’re not drawn into Rose Hobart; we’re dropped right into it, and throughout the film Cornell directs our point of view and imagination. When we first see Rose she is reacting nervously to the Prince, but with no sound or dialogue, we have no idea why. A rough fade out distils this tension, sparking both prurient curiosity and concern for her predicament. The following tracking shot finds Rose asleep in a jungle camp. A candle burns. She awakens and emerges from the mosquito nets. A ball of light glows in the night sky. Then we see Rose again with the Prince, looking into the distance as she wrings her hands, but the scene cuts away to find her alone, walking through a palm-filled room. Something draws her to the balcony; she looks down. Cut to a shot of something unseen falling into a pool. The slow-motion splash and ripples elide the scene, making it unclear whether it’s something she actually sees, or merely remembers. She shakes her head, as if telling herself not to imagine things, but her smile fades as she raises her head and looks into the distance.\n\nScene follows scene, connected only by Rose’s gamut of emotions as she wanders through the same rooms, emerging discontinuously in strands of the preposterous original plot. One of Cornell’s more surrealistic additions interrupts a seduction scene: a close-up of a full chalice with a small cup bobbing on the surface. The cup appears filled with something white and not quite solid, which, as it sinks, reveals itself to be a sieve full of cotton wool.\n\nFor nearly twenty minutes, we follow Rose, transfixed by the film’s artificially slowed pace and constant tonal shifts. Shots of windswept palms - a relief from East of Borneo’s ornate sets and frequent night scenes - redirect our attention to the sky. As the film progresses, the edits become more abrupt, flickering between Rose’s reactions and those of the other characters before cutting away once again to the glow in the night sky: the lunar eclipse. As the eclipse peaks and wanes, the film ends with a repeat of the pond-splash, now expanded to include the fallen object, and slightly sped up to dissipate the ripples, smoothing the pond’s surface to reflect the moon.\n\nInitially, Rose Hobart met with mixed reviews, except for one unequivocal reaction from Salvador Dalí, who screamed at Cornell calling him a thief, ranting that he had stolen the film from Dalí’s dreams. Then he tried to kick over the projector.\n\nCornell never employed direct symbolism. If objects, words and forms meant anything beyond themselves, it depended upon layered, highly subjective associations, in other words, dream logic. But if he actively looked to dreams for inspiration, it was because he recognised them as a common language. As Michael Pigott noted: ‘If the Surrealists hoped to use dreams as a means to disrupt the everyday, then … Cornell harboured a utopian desire to use dreamtime as a starting point for a re-appraisal of the everyday.’[7]\n\nRose Hobart is a delightfully strange film not because of any specific story it tells, but because it completely rejects narrative. At first, we see Rose through a lens of retro glamour and melodrama, but we end up identifying with her because Cornell’s editing encourages us to see things through her eyes. So, as we watch, we find ourselves like Rose, framed inside events that go seem to go nowhere, but might, if read individually, reveal some meaning.\n\nCornell’s Rose exists not only outside of any story but outside of time. I think he understood that we seldom plot precise moments in our own experiences. When we recall events that shaped us, we do so through our senses, through memories triggered by the material world, one we furnish, each, according to our own detritus.\n\nLike his signature boxes, Cornell’s Rose Hobart draws us into a world recalled from another time, another life, or maybe just from a really great dream. It’s an oddly comforting film.\n\nNB, My title is taken with gratitude from Jennie-Rebecca Falcetta’s essay comparing Cornell’s work with the poetry of Marianne Moore.
