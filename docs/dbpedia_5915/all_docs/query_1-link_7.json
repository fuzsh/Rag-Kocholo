        "text": "Figueres isn’t a very nice town (sorry Figueres!). With some utterly enchanting towns to visit in the area of Costa Brava, there really is little reason to go. Or at least there was little reason to go. Dalí was born in Figueres and at the beginning of the 60’s, Ramon Guardiola, the town’s mayor, on realising that they do not have a painting by their most famous citizen in their local museum, asked Dalí to donate one to the town. Dalí quickly replied that he wont give a single work but an entire museum.\n\nThe artist treated the museum as one single Surrealist art object. Inaugurated in 1974 on the remains of the former Municipal Theatre of Figueres (yes, the other reason for the world ‘Theatre’, and is considered to be the last great work of Salvador Dalí. Everything in it was conceived and designed by the artist so as to offer visitors a real experience and walk through the creative mind of this great artist.\n\nIt is a great way to discover the works of Dalí with a route around the rooms that allows visitors to capture his first artistic experiences, Surrealism, Nuclear Mysticism (with the advent of the atom bomb) and his passion for science, up to his final works, including the museum itself. Though it might seem a bit dated to audiences accustomed to high tech solutions, with some displays that rely on perspective, one can still really appreciate that he was entirely ahead of his time with ‘experiential art’ like Face of Mae West Which Can Be Used as an Apartment (Pictured).\n\nThere are other works there, on the other hand, that make one really wonder how on earth he didn’t use a computer! Such as with Apparition of the Figure of Vermeer on the Face of Abraham Lincoln (pictured) where one sees a picture of a nude but if you squint, you will see the face of Lincoln, or the slightly disturbing Galatea of the Spheres (pictured)."
