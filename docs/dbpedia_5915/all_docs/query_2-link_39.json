Some of the best-loved works on paper in The Dalí Museum’s permanent collection, these astonishing works transform traditional renderings of fruits and flowers, reimagining them as surreal creations at the height of the Pop era.\n\nThe Dalí Museum’s Dalí Alive 360° is an immersive experience celebrating the life and creative genius of one of the most influential and inventive artists of the modern era, Salvador Dalí. This multi-sensory art experience will envelop visitors in 360 degrees of light and sound, within a monumental new Museum space: The Dalí Dome.\n\nUsing the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Ask Dalí allows visitors to ask any question to a recreated Salvador Dalí.\n\nThe Dalí provides a space where Museum staff can share their creative endeavors with each other, the community and beyond."
