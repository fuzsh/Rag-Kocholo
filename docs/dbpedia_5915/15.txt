Some personal ramblings:

Dali was both, emotionally disturbed and an artistic genius. How endearing, that he cherished his wife (Gala) and made her the object of many artistic works.

The visual centre of the painting directs us, not toward Gala's eyes (which are closed) but to her mouth. (He would have kissed this mouth many times and it was a mouth that would have soothed him with comforting words. Despite criticism levelled at her, she did prove to be a stabilising influence to Salvador.) From her mouth, flows a perfect procession of infinite spheres, being replicated like cells in living tissue.

We get the impression of motion and speed with some spheres, consistent with the evident speed of real objects, orbiting in outer space and inside the atom.

In reality, both the smallest and largest aspects of the visible creation are designed along similar principles. This is most apparent in the organisation of atomic particles and galaxies. Both of their structures involve spheres, maintaining precise orbits and spatial distribution. It is almost as if an atom contains its own miniature universe.

In the painting I appreciate the idea of replication and infinity. How many atoms exist in the Universe? What actually is the smallest material particle that exists?

Mankind is composed from the elements of the earth and these elements are recycled when each person dies. "For dust you are and to dust you will return".

To our creator, we are only dust .... but potentially gold dust!
