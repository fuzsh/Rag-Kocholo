The Dalí Museum in Figueres

The Dali Museum, "Teatre-Museu Dali," is located in Figueres, the artist's hometown.

The Dali Museum embodies Figueres's ancient and modern history: it was constructed over an ancient Roman theater, creating a unique space to display works from every period of Dalí's life.

Highlights include "The Spectre of Sex Appeal" (1932), "Poetry of America - The Cosmic Athletes " (1943), "Leda Atòmica" (1949) and "Galatea of the Spheres" (1952). Dalí expressly requested that the museum displayed specific works, as well as paintings by El Greco, Duchamp, Fortuny and more.
