Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, 1st Baronet (born July 20, 1804, Rochdale, Lancashire, Eng.—died May 26, 1877, London) was a physician, public-health reformer, and chief founder of the English system of publicly financed elementary education.

Kay studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and obtained his medical degree there in 1827. His subsequent work as a physician among various social classes in Manchester demonstrated to him the social and educational needs of the poor in Britain’s industrial towns. In 1835 he became an assistant poor-law commissioner, and his efforts to educate pauper children in workhouses convinced him of the need for a national system of education and teacher training.
