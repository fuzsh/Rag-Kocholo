        "text": "Notes for Frances \"Fanny\" Waggener:\n\nFrom a Kay- Woods family Bible dated 1839, which was posted for sale on-line at E-Bay. The seller was an apparent broker of old and rare books. There were fourteen pages from the Bible containing family information, which had been photographed and posted on-line. The Bible was clearly authentic and I was able to read and transcribe most of the information from the photographs. The Bible was purchased by Myra Daniel, who confirmed the authenticity of the Bible and the information in it . Myra said that it was her intention to eventually donate the Bible to the Library of Virginia. The Bible had initially been in the possession of Robert K. Woods (1820-1874) and his wife Susan Eleanor Berry (1820-1903). Robert K. Woods was a grandson of Francis and Gabriel Kay. Most of the information in the Bible pertains to Frances and Gabriel and their descendants. It appears that many of the entries for the 1840's and 1850's were made first hand, and that the older dates and some of the other dates were transcribed or gathered from other kinds of source. The last dates recorded were from the 1880's. The first two pages contained entries pertaining to Frances, Gabriel and their children:\n\n\"Births, dates of Marriage & death of the children of Gabriel and Francis Waggener\n\nGrandfather and Grandmother of Robert K. Woods\"\n\nGabriel Kay was born 10 May 1774\n\nFrances Waggener was born 2 Oct. 1782\n\nElizabeth A.

Kay and Elizabeth Allinsworth were married 31 Decr. 1839\"\n\n===============\n\nAlthough the Bible records above document many of the event dates for Frances, Gabriel, and their children; they do not list the locations of any of these events. I did have a little information about them before and with the help of these records above, I have been able to find more.\n\nFrances would have been born to her parents in Culpeper County, Virginia. I believe that her parent's plantation was near to the town of Rapidan along the Rapidan River. Frances would have grown up there, and she must have met and married Gabriel Kay Culpeper County, Virginia. They seem to be listed there in Culpeper County in the 1810 census.\n\nFrom the later census records of the locations of births for the children of Frances and Gabriel, it appears that they left Culpeper County around 1815, and moved to Kentucky. I am pretty sure that they moved to the area of Christian County and/ or Todd County, Kentucky. About this time, Frances' sister and Gabriel's brother, Sarah and James Kay, moved to Christian County. Also around this time, Frances' and Sarah's uncle, Thomas Waggener, moved to Christian County. Frances' parents, James and Elizabeth Waggener, moved to Todd County around 1820. I also know that their brother, Stokley Towles Waggener, ended up in this area around this general time frame.\n\nFrances' husband Gabriel Kay, died in Christian County, Kentucky in 1818. I have not been able to figure out where Frances was after 1818. I know from the Bible record that she died in 1839, and I believe it was in this same area of Kentucky. Some of the children of Frances and Gabriel moved on, but several of them lived the rest of their lives in the Todd/ Christian Counties area.\n\nNotes for James Kay:\n\nFrom Tyler's Quarterly, Genealogies of Virginia Families, Vol. 2:\n\nJames Kay moved in 1817 to Christian County, Kentucky, where his will is on record (Will Book \"I\" 1835-37, p. 147). In this will, he mentions his wife Sarah, children Robert G. Kay of Illinois, William Kay of Tennessee, Gabriel Kay, James Kay, Thirza, Bernard, wife of J.C. Bernard of Illinois, Helen Kay, Lucy Ann Kay, Mary Frances Kay (the last 3 under age), and grandaughter Mariam Cornelius Ingram \"daughter of Jesse Ingram and Margaret Ingram, his wife (who before marriage was my daughter and who is now dead) of Stewart county, Tennessee\".\n\n=================\n\nFrom the 1810 Federal Census of Culpeper County, Virginia; from ancestry.com, image #50 of 94:\n\nJas. Kay; 3 males under 10 years (Robert, William, and Gabriel), 1 male 26-44 years (James); 1 female 26-44 years (Sarah); 8 slaves\n\nJames seems to be listed near to the households of his father and brother Gabriel. Gabriel was married to Fanny Waggener, sister to Sarah.\n\n==================\n\nFrom the 1820 Federal Census of Hopkinsville, Christian County, Kentucky; from ancestry.com, image #17 of 23:\n\nJames Kay; 1 male under 10 years, 2 males 10-15 years, 1 male 16-18 years, 2 males 16-25 years, 1 male 26-44 years (James), 1 male 45 years and older; 3 females under 10 years, 1 female 26- 44 years (Sarah); 9 persons engaged in agriculture; 6 male slaves under 14 years, 2 male slaves 14- 25 years, 1 male slave 26-44 years; 5 female slaves under 14 years, 2 female slaves 14-25 years, 2 female slaves 26-44 years\n\n=================\n\nFrom the 1830 Federal Census of Christian County, Kentucky; from ancestry.com, images #91 & 92 of 94:\n\nJames Kay; 1 male 50-59 years (James); 1 female under 5 years, 2 females 5-9 years, 1 female 10-14 years, 2 females 15-19 years, 1 female 40-49 years (Sarah); 1 male slave under 10 years, 2 male slaves 10-23 years, 1 male slave 36-54 years; 3 female slaves under 10 years, 4 female slaves 10-23 years, 3 female slaves 24-35 years\n\n=================\n\nFrom \"The Kay-Pendleton-Neel Families\" by George and Margaret Rose; published by J. Grant Stevenson, Provo, Utah, 1969:\n\n\"James Kay, the younger son of Robert Kay and his wife, Margaret Long-Kay was born in Culpeper County on January 19, 1778 as is shown in the Bible of his father. He married August 12, 1802 in Culpeper County, Virginia, Sarah, the daughter of James Jones Waggoner and his wifeElizabeth Garnett-Waggoner. His will dated August 21, 1835 and proved October 26, 1835 confirms the entries made in the family Bible and shows that by his wife, Sarah, who survived him he had ten children.\"\n\n\"The above Bible record started in the Bible of Robert Kay and continued by his son James Kay went, in turn, to his son Robert Garnet Kay, and thence into the hands of Robert Garnet Kay II. It will be shown presently that it was in the household of Robert Garnet Kay, brother of William Kay that William and his wife Caroline Pendleton visited in the summer of 1851 at Payson, Illinois, near Quincy. A similar record was kept by Julia Kay, daughter of William Kay and has a few additional items touching upon the brothers and sisters of William Kay. Her entries show that both Robert Garnett Kay and his brother, Gabriel Kay lived at Payson, Illinois, that William Kay married not only Mary Bayliss, but that he also married (2) Sallee Bailey, and married (3) Caroline Augusta Pendleton. James, who married Eliza Bailey, resided in St. Joseph, Missouri. Thurza, who married James Bernard resided in Quincy, Illinois. Margaret married Carter Ingraham (Bible record shows Jesse C. Ingram) and resided in St. Joseph, Missouri. Helen married Captain Frank Kerchival and resided in St. Joseph, Missouri. Lucy married M. Atkins and lived in Clarksville, Tennessee. Mary Frances married Dr. William Clements and lived in St. Joseph, Missouri. The fact that so many of the children of James Kay resided in St. Joseph may be explained by the fact that Sarah Waggoner-Kay, their mother, took up residence in St. Joseph at the death of her husband.\"\n\nWILL OF JAMES KAY OF CHRISTIAN COUNTY, KENTUCKY, WILLS I, Page 147\n\nIn the name of God amen-- I James Kay of the Town of Hopkinsville County of Christian and State of Kentucky being of sound mind and memory & knowing the certainty of death & the uncertainty of life do make and publish this as my last will & Testament hereby revoking all other wills heretofore by me made--\n\nI will that all my just debts be paid, and that all my landed estate & negroes be sold and converted into money at such times and such manner as my Executors hereinafter named may deem most prudent & most advisable for the interest of my children, and the money coming from the sale of land & my negroes & such other sums as may be collected that is now due may be put out on interest at a safe way at the discretion of my Executors(???)

He would have been born to his parents James Jones Waggener and Elizabeth Garnett, in Culpeper County, Virginia. I do not know when he left Virginia, but his parents left Virginia around 1821, to go to Todd County, Kentucky. I do not know why Robert ended up in New Madrid County, Missouri, but he seems to have been there before 1830. I found the record of the deed in 1829, which involved him selling property in Todd County. He and his wife Zelia are described as living in New Madrid at the time. He apparently met and married his wife Zelia Olive there in Missouri, since she was born in Missouri. The fact that he owned property in Todd County, Kentucky seems to show that he initially went to Todd County and lived there for some period of time. I can't seem to locate him in the 1820 census, so I don't know if he came to Todd County, before his parents, with his parents, or after his parents. Since their first child Virginia was born in 1829, it seems logical to presume that they married one or two years earlier. Extending this logic further, it would be reasonable to think that Robert had moved to New Madrid a year or two before this.\n\nRobert and family are listed on the 1830 and 1840 censuses in New Madrid County. Robert is not listed with Zelia and the family in the 1850 census in New Madrid County, which must mean that he died there before then. I have determined that Robert and Zelia had five children, but I only know the names of four of them: Virginia, Heloise Josephine, Benjamin Franklin, and Edmund L. There must have been an older son, possibly named James or Joseph. I have not been able to find him on further records and verify this. Perhaps he died around the time Robert did, or he left the area. Although there is apparently no headstone still standing, it seems very likely that Robert is buried near to his wife in the Dawson Cemetery in New Madrid County, Missouri.\n\n=============\n\nFrom the Deeds of Todd County, Kentucky, 1820-1842; Deed Book F, Page 27:\n\nDated February 22, 1829; Robert G.

At September Court, 1825, Samuel Churchill, Harrison Arteburn, James W. Thornberry, William Meriweather and Jesse Swindler were appointed to divide and allot to Elizabeth Waggoner the widow of her dower of one-third of the plantation on which said James lived and died, on Salt River Road, and to divide the remainder between David B. Phillips and George C., Elizabeth and Elseff (Elesis?) Waggoner, children and infant heirs of James. Division of land, about 232 acres, was made December 7, 1825, allotting to the widow 72 acres, to the children 20 acres and balance to Phillips. Recorded January 4, 1826.\n\nNotes for Stokeley Towles Waggener:\n\nStokeley must have been born to his parents James Jones and Elizabeth (Garnett) Waggener, on their estate in Culpeper County, Virginia. This was apparently near to the town of Rapidan along the Rapidan River. He was one of his parent's youngest children. I know that Stokeley's parents moved to Todd County, Kentucky in 1820 or 1821, and that his father died there in about 1822. I'm not sure when Stokeley moved to Todd County, but it appears as though he might have moved before his parents. He reportedly married his first wife, Ann Elizabeth Anderson in Todd County on December 19, 1820. Stokeley and Ann are listed as witnesses to the marriage of his sister Eliza in nearby Christian County, in 1824.\n\nStokeley apparently lived in or near the town of Trenton in Todd County, up until about 1859. He reportedly opened up a tailor shop in Trenton around 1830. Shortly thereafter he began operating some kind of general store in Trenton, which he continued to operate until he left. Stokeley had two children with Ann, after which she apparently died. Apparently by about 1840, he married his second wife, Elizabeth Ross. Stokeley and Elizabeth had at least eight children. Most prominent of his children was his son Leslie, whose career included being a Civil War hero, a college professor, and the first President of the University of Texas.\n\nFrom the family letters I have obtained, Stokeley seems to have served as a sort of patriarchal figure for the family. It also appears that he was quite well off. He is listed on the 1850 census in Todd County as a merchant and farmer, with property valued at $6,000. In the 1860 census he is listed in Logan County with real estate valued at $9,180, and personal property valued at $45,000.\n\nAround 1859 Stokeley and Elizabeth moved to the Russellville area of Logan County. They lived there on a farm for the rest of their lives. Stokeley died in Logan County, Kentucky in July of 1886. He and Elizabeth are buried there in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Russellville.\n\n===================\n\nFrom Dodd, Jordan. Kentucky Marriages to 1850.

(the rest of the transcription of this record was cut off at the bottom of the page).\n\n================\n\nFrom a series of transcribed family letters sent to my by Judy Senter:\n\n****** There is a letter written by Elizabeth (O'Neil) Waggener (widow of Stokeley's brother James Waggener, who died in 1822) to her son George C. Waggener and his wife Mary Frances (Anderson). The letter is headed: \"December 17th, Todd Co, near Trenton.\" It seems to have probably been written in 1838.\n\nElizabeth talks about Stokeley and his wife Ann (Anderson) Waggener. They apparently lived near Elizabeth in Trenton and ran some kind of store. Stokeley seems to have been some kind of family patriarchal figure, who apparently subsidized or supported a number of extended family members. Elizabeth obviously thought very highly of them, and chided her son and daughter-in-law to, \"follow the footsteps of Stokeley and Ann in many things.\" Stokeley's wife Ann was the sister of Mary Frances (Anderson) Waggener. She apparently died in the next couple of years, and Stokeley was remarried to Elizabeth Ross.\n\n==================\n\nFrom the 1840 Federal Census of Todd County, Kentucky, page 273; from ancestry.com, images 69 & 70 of 71:\n\nWagner, S.

According to the biography of his son Leslie, Leslie graduated from Bethel College in Russellville, in 1860.Perhaps this had something to do with why they moved. Leslie was only 18 years old at the time. Stokeley and Elizabeth remained in Russellville the rest of their lives. This census also shows that Stokeley and Elizabeth were fairly wealthy.\n\nIt would seem that Ellen must have been listed as Babe on the 1850 census above. Also, Jemima is not here or on the 1870 census below, which might well indicate that she was deceased. James was not listed on the 1850 census above. It seems possible that he was somehow mistakenly listed as Jemima on 1850, and that there never was a Jemima.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nS.T. Waggener is listed with 13 slaves, on page 26 of the Slave Schedule in Russellville District No. 2, Logan County, Kentucky:\n\n60 year old black female, 50 year old black male, 40 year old black female, 19 year old black male, 17 years old black female, 16 year old black male, 15 year old black male, 14 year old black female, 12 year old black female, 10 year old black female, 2 year old black female, 18 year old black female, 6/12 year old black female\n\n====================\n\nThere are a series of four deeds in Montgomery County, Tennessee involving Stokeley. They seem to involve two tracts of land that Stokeley purchased for his daughter Olive and her husband Frank W. Waller. The deeds are dated 1865- 1867, but it appears that the first 33 acre tract was initially purchased in 1861, which probably would have been soon after Olive and Frank married. Montgomery County, was directly south of Logan County, Kentucky, in Tennessee. I have included the transcriptions of the deeds in the notes for Olive.\n\n===============\n\nFrom the 1870 Federal Census of Russellville Confederation, Logan County, Kentucky, taken August 24, 1870, page 511, household 170; from ancestry.com, image 507 of 530:\n\nWagoner, Stokley T.; age 71, male, white, occupation- farmer, real estate- $8,000, personal property- $8,000, born- Virginia\n\n------ Elizabeth T.; age- 53, female, white, occupation- keeping house, born- North Carolina\n\n------ Ellen; age- 20, female, white, born- Kentucky (from David Wagoner: m.

This included saving the life of Stokeley's son Leslie, after he was shot and wounded during the battle of Shiloh, in the Civil War. Reportedly Thomas found the wounded Leslie on the battle field, begged the doctors to help him, and spent many months nursing him back to health. Thomas was affectionately known as \"Uncle Tom,\" and apparently lived there until his death. It seems quite likely that some of the other servants listed here were also former slaves.\n\n=================\n\nFrom the same series of transcribed family letters, written about 30 years later, sent to my by Judy Senter:\n\n****** There is a letter written by Stokeley's daughter, Olive K. Waller, who is writing from Clarksville, Tennessee on January 26, 1876, to her aunt, Mary Frances (Anderson) Waggener, who was in Hancock County, Illinois. Clarksville is about 20 mile south of Trenton, just across the border. Olive writes about a recent visit from her father:\n\n\"... Pa stayed some time with me last fall. He is in good health and more cheerful than usual. He often spoke of you and enjoyed seeing you so much. Nothing gives him such pleasure as to meet with those he knew in early life, his happiest days as he says....\"\n\n***** There is another letter written by Olive, to her cousin Mary O. Waggener, who is apparently in Illinois. Olive is apparently still not too far from Trenton. The letter was written August 29, 1877. Speaking of her father Olive writes:\n\n\"... I went to se Pa last month. His general health is very good though he is quite feeble. He was 78 years old last April. He told me he had written a long letter to Cousin Ell months ago in which he spoke of old times and associations. He asked her to be sure to answer and if she couldn't, for your Ma or Pa to do so, as the letter was intended for them too. He has never received as answer. I do hope some of you will write to him. It is a great task for him to write now and he feels hurt that his letter was not noticed. Nothing affords him more pleasure than to talk about old times and people he knew. He rarely even meets with any....\n\n===========\n\nFrom the 1880 Federal Census of the Town of Russellville, Logan County, Kentucky, district 164, page 41/ 431A, taken June 1, 1880, household 1; from ancestry.com, image 1 of 45:\n\nWaggener, Stokley T.; male, age- 82, head of household, married, occupation- farmer, born- Virginia, parents born- Virginia\n\n------ Elizabeth T.; female, age- 64, wife, married, occupation- keeping house, born- Tennessee, parents born- North Carolina\n\n------ Bell; female, age- 30, daughter, single, born- Kentucky, father born- Virginia, mother born- Tennessee\n\n------ Ida; female, age- 20, daughter, single, born- Kentucky, father born- Virginia, mother born- Tennessee\n\nWaller, Olive H.; age- 44, daughter, widowed, born- Kentucky, father born- Virginia, mother born- Tennessee\n\nGloen, Eliza; female, age- 40, servant, widowed, occupation- servant, born- Kentucky, parents born- Kentucky\n\nHolland, Emma; female, age- 21, servant, single, occupation- servant, born- Tennessee, parents born- Tennessee\n\nListed next door to the household is the same Thomas Waggener, who was listed in the household in the 1870 census.\n\n============\n\nFrom Hopkinsville New Era, dated July 1886\n\nMr. Stokeley T Waggener an aged and respected citizen of Russellville, died at his home on Monday last at 10 o'clock a.m. from the effects of a stroke of paralysis received several days previously.\n\n============\n\nFrom Kentucky Cemetery Records, Vol 1, compiled by the Kentucky Records Research Committee, Kentucky Society DAR, 1960:\n\nListed in the Maple Grove Cemetery, Russellville, Logan County are \"Stokley F. Waggoner, b. April 11, 1799, d. June 1888; wife Elizabeth Ross, b. October 1818, d. August 1882\"\n\nNotes for Armistead Waggener:\n\nArmistead must have been the next to the youngest child of his parents James Jones Waggener and Elizabeth Garnett, and their youngest son. From the census records below, I have determined that he must have been born between 1802 and 1804. His parents were living in Culpeper County, Virginia at the time, so he must have been born there. His parents moved to the area of Todd County, Kentucky just after the census in 1820, and it seems likely that Armistead moved with them. In the record below from 1822, he seems to have gone to to Jefferson County, if for nothing else than to help the wife of his brother James, deal with the death of her husband. Armistead seems to be back in Todd County in 1825, where he married Martha Jane Street. He also is listed on a couple of other deeds there in 1825, apparently involving some money he borrowed in lieu of his inheritance from his parents. Armistead is also listed on the census in Todd County in 1830, apparently with his wife Martha and three children. I do not know the names of any of their children and do not have any further information about what became of Armistead and Martha.\n\n===============\n\nIn the 1820 Virginia Census of Culpeper County, Virginia, page 103; found at ancestry.com image #37 of 53, Armistead seems to be listed in the household of his father, \"James Waggoner,\" as1 male 16-18 years and 1 male 16-25 years,\n\n==============\n\nThe following record was taken from the Kentucky Earlier Settlers, the Records of Jefferson County, Kentucky; from the Filson Club History Quarterly, Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., 1988:\n\n****** From the Calendar of Early Jefferson County, Kentucky Wills; Will Book No. 2, pg. 193:\n\nWill of James Waggener, dated July 27, 1822, proved October 15, 1822, recorded November 18, 1822.\n\nTo brothers, Armstead and Reubin Waggener, estate, in trust, for wife Elizabeth and her three children George, Mary and Elesis Waggener. Executors:None named.\n\nWitnesses: Ben W. Johnston, William Lewis.\n\nThis would seem to show that Armistead was in Jefferson County, Kentucky in 1822. He apparently moved to Todd County, Kentucky sometime between 1822 and 1825.\n\n==============\n\nFrom Dodd, Jordan. Kentucky Marriages to 1850. [database online] Provo, UT: Ancestry.com, 1997.

Waggoner, James Waggener, Richard Waggoner, Reuben Waggoner, Stokely T. Waggener, Anthony F. Read, who is assignee of Armstead Waggoner, claiming his part by purchase and Thomas I. Walker and Eliza his wife who was Eliza Waggoner all heirs and representatives of the Estate of James Waggoner, dec'd....\"\n\nThis document involves Armistead's mother, Elizabeth (Garnett) Waggener, dividing and distributing the estate of her and her husband James Jones Waggener, amongst their children. It had been bequeathed to Elizabeht in James' will in 1821. It appears that all three deeds listed above are related and that they seem to show that Armstead had borrowed money from Anthony F. Read, in exchange for his inheritance. I don't have any other details and can only speculate about the circumstances of this situation. Since Armistead had married earlier in the year, perhaps he had purchased property.\n\nAnother interesting feature of this deed is that is appears to list the children of James and Elizabeth Waggener in the order of their birth. This supports the fact that Armistead was the next to the youngest child, and that the birth date that I have determined for him, between 1802 and 1804, is probably accurate.\n\n============\n\nFrom the 1830 Federal Census of Todd County, Kentucky, page 376; from ancestry.com, image #37 of 68:\n\nArmistead Waggoner; 1 white male under 5 years, 1 white male 5-9 years, 20-29 years (Armistead); 1 white female under 5 years, 2 white females 20-29 years (Martha); 2 male slaves under 10 years, 1 male slave 10-23 years; 2 female slaves under 10 years, 1 female slave 10-23 years, 1 female slave 36-54 years\n\nI do not yet have the names of any of the children of Armistead. There appear to be 3 children listed here in 1830."
