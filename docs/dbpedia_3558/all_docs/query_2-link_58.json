        "text": "ROCHESTER, Mich. - The No. 14 Golden Grizzlies men's basketball team will look to grab its first-ever Round of 64 win in the NCAA Tournament as it's set to face No. 3 Kentucky at the PPG Paints Arena, live on CBS with tip-off set for 7:10 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Golden Grizzlies (23-11, 15-5 HL) won its first-ever Horizon League Tournament title against Milwaukee, 83-76, for its fourth bid into the NCAA Tournament (2005, 2010 and 2011). The Golden Grizzlies were last a 14-seed during its run in 2010 as it fell in the first round against Pittsburgh. The Golden Grizzlies made its tournament debut as a 16-seed at the 2005 tournament, while its highest-seed coming in 2011 as a 13-seed.\n\nIn its Horizon League Championship game March 12, Oakland held on to its halftime lead in the beginning of the second but the Milwaukee Panthers came clawing back. Both teams kept it close as Trey Townsend took control of the game and scored 18-straight points for the Golden Grizzlies in 6:24 time to give Oakland a four-point lead with 2:00 minutes to play. Oakland held its lead as Townsend iced the game with a pair of free throws, followed by a block on the Panthers last shot attempt to take the title game, 83-76.\n\nTownsend led the Golden Grizzlies in its Horizon League Championship game with 38 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes of play. He joined a short list of him and Kevin Durant (Texas, 2007) to score 35+ points, 10+ rebounds and play 40+ minutes in a conference championship game in the last 25 years. With five assists, he's the only player in the last 15 years to record at least 35 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a regulation conference tournament game.\n\nALL-LEAGUE\n\nTrey Townsend, Jack Gohlke and Blake Lampman all earned All-League honors as Townsend became the fourth Oakland player to earn Horizon League Player of the Year since joining the Horizon League. He joins the list of Jamal Cain, Kendrick Nunn and Kay Felder, all of which have played in the NBA, as Cain last won in 2022. Townsend also earned a First Team All-League nod. Gohlke became the second Golden Grizzly to earn Horizon League Sixth Man of the Year as Max Hooper earned the award in 2016, the same year Felder earned Player of the Year. To round it out, Lampman was named to the second team for the first time of his career.\n\nRECORD WATCH\n\nJack Gohlke ranks sixth in the Golden Grizzlies single season record book for most three-point field goals made with 121, as Travis Bader (2013-14) leads with 147. Travis Bader (2011-12) is ahead of him in fifth with 124. He also sits fifth in three-point field goals per game with 3.56 and third in three-point field goal attempts with 327, as Kendrick Nunn (2017-18) is ahead of him with 340.\n\nGraduate student Blake Lampman set the all-time school record against Detroit Mercy on March 2 for most games played in a Golden Grizzlies uniform with 138 and currently has 141. He's also in the fifth spot career wise in three-point field goals made with 276, as Brad Buddenborg (1998-02) is ahead in fourth with 286, while Lampman is third in attempts with 831, as Erik Kangas (2005-09) is ahead with 861 attempts.\n\nTrey Townsend has played and started in 127 games to date, which puts him second in the Oakland record book for most games started and is fourth overall in the books in minutes played with 4,416. In games started, Townsend is behind Johnathon Jones (2006-10), while Corey Petros (2011-15) is third in minutes played with 4516. The senior also finds himself seventh overall in offensive rebounds (279, Jalen Hayes (2013-18) is sixth with 280), fourth in defensive rebounds (585, Corey Petros (2011-15) in third with 664) and seventh in total rebounds (864, Ronald Brown (1969-73) in sixth with 866). He's also t-eighth in career double-doubles with 19 alongside John Henderson (1985-89), as Tom Eller (1990-94) is ahead with 20.\n\n1K Club\n\nThe Golden Grizzlies have four players with 1000 career NCAA points (Townsend - 1653, Gohlke - 1127, Watts - 1017, Lampman - 1003) which is t-9th in the NCAA for most active 1000 point scorers on the same team as St. John's (NY) leads with six. Watts and Lampman recorded their 1000th career-point in the same game.\n\nDQ Cole amassed 1145 points in his career prior to joining the Golden Grizzlies, with Schoolcraft Community College and Henry Ford College, that both compete in the National Junior College Athletic Association level. Although NJCAA points don't count towards NCAA career point totals, Cole is nearing the 1500-point club as he currently sits with 1442.\n\nOF NOTE\n\n- The Golden Grizzlies had the 25th hardest non-conference schedule in Division I basketball. Its non-conference opponents included four that earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament and include: No. 3 Illinois, No. 7 Dayton, No. 9 Michigan State and No. 10 Drake.\n\n- Trey Townsend, who earned First Team All-League, became the 18th Golden Grizzly in-a-row to receive first team honors as only Gonzaga has a longer streak.\n\n- Trey Townsend is the son of Skip Townsend who played basketball for Oakland University. Skip also played under Greg Kampe as Trey grew up going to Oakland basketball games, camps, etc.\n\n- Oakland was one of 11 (out of 32) number one 1 seeds to win its conference tournament and defeated the No. 8, No. 7 and No. 6 seeds which all had over 20 wins, for the first time at the Mid-Major level that a one-seed beat an eight, seven and six-seed with 20+ wins en route to a conference championship.\n\n- Head coach Greg Kampe is the fifth DI Men's Basketball head coach to coach 40 seasons at one school and lead the team to the NCAA Tournament 4 times.

Among those 15 include: Two Round of 32 finishes, one Sweet 16 finish, three Elite Eight finishes, two Final Four finishes and one national championship (2012). Besides the 2011-12 season, Calipari coached the Wildcats to a near perfect 38-1 record before it fell in the Final Four in 2015.\n\nTo date, the Wildcats have had 112 total players selected in the NBA Draft, with 48 first-round picks and three No. 1 overall. Kentucky has won eight NCAA titles for second most in the NCAA, three behind UCLA. In recent years, however, the Wildcats haven't made it to the second weekend as it fell as the No. 2 seed in 2022 to Saint Peter's, 85-79, while losing to No. 3 seed Kansas State, 75-69, as a No. 6 seed in the Round of 32 last season.\n\nThis season, the Wildcats fell in the quarterfinal round of the 2024 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament, 97-87, after it rattled off five-straight, including an 85-81 win over current No. 2 seed Tennessee. Six of the team's nine losses this season have come from the hands of NCAA Tournament teams.\n\nThe Wildcats are led by NABC All-District honoree Antonio Reeves who tallies 20.0 points per game and shoots at a .508 clip from the floor with 79 makes from range for a team high. Tre Mitchell leads Kentucky with 7.0 rebounds per game as Reeves is close behind with 4.2.\n\nKentucky ranks second in the NCAA in scoring offense with 89.4 points per game, but 334 (out of 351) in scoring defense, giving up 79.7 points per game. The team also ranks third overall in blocks per game with 6.3, first in three-point percentage, hitting at a .419 clip, and fifth in field goal percentage with a .497 clip.
