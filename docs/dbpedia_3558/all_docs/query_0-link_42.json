        "text": "The continued presidency of Donald J. Trump is a grave risk to our democracy.\n\nDonald Trump’s refusal to abide by the judgment of the American people has sabotaged a peaceful transfer of power from his Administration to that of President-Elect Biden. He has continued to lie about the trustworthiness of the national election, sought to enlist state officials in illegal manipulation of election results, and has undermined the constitutional process of the electoral college. And while the nation watched, a lawless, insurrectionist mob stormed the United States Capitol pursuant to his incitement and support.\n\nDonald Trump has violated his Oath “to faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States” and to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.”\n\nAs professors of law and as citizens, we care deeply about the rule of law and the viability of our constitutional republic.\n\nWe call on the United States Congress, Vice President Mike Pence, and the Cabinet to remove President Donald J Trump from office immediately, through the impeachment process or by invoking the 25th Amendment. His removal should be undertaken urgently, before further violence takes place or even greater damage is inflicted on our democracy.\n\nSignatories as of January 11, 2021[*]\n\nSusan Abraham, Professor of Law, New York Law School\n\nMichael Abramowicz, Oppenheim Professor of Law, George Washington University Law School\n\nNancy Abramowicz, Professor of Practice, American University Washington College of Law\n\nKathryn Abrams, Herma Hill Kay Distinguished Professor of Law, University of California, Berkeley Law School\n\nRobert Ackerman, Professor of Law, Wayne State University\n\nLeah Adams, Director, CDO and Adjunct Professor of Lawyering Skills, University of the Pacific, McGeorge School of Law\n\nJabeen Adawi, Director of Family Law Clinic, University of Pittsburgh School of Law\n\nNadia Ahmad, Associate Professor of Law, Barry University\n\nMaryam Ahranjani, Law Professor, University of New Mexico\n\nJanet Ainsworth, John D.
