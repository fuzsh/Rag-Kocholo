        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - Alabama families now have more options when it comes to where your kid goes to school. Governor Kay Ivey wasted no time signing the CHOOSE Act into law Thursday.\n\nSupporters of the bill call it a win, while opponents compare it to segregation. In a nutshell, it works like school vouchers. Eligible families will be able to get up to $7,000 to send their kids to private schools or $2,000 for home school.\n\nAlabama’s CHOOSE Act is now law and is not sitting well with educators like Birmingham’s American Federation of Teachers chapter president Richard Franklin.\n\n“I just think it’s disingenuous for our governor and our legislators to pass a bill like this,” said Franklin.\n\nThe legislation creates an education savings account. It gives families access to up to $7,000 to send their kid to private school, transfer to another public school, or pay for tutoring. There’s also the option of $2,000 for home schooling.\n\n“It would be focused on children with special needs. That would be the first constituency that would be addressed. Then after that, it would be folks that are in the 300% poverty group,” said the bills sponsor, Arthur Orr, in a previous interview.\n\nThat means a family of three making roughly $77,000 annually falls into that category. According to the legislation, the first 500 slots are also reserved for families of students with disabilities. Everyone else would be eligible in 2027 with low income families taking priority.\n\n“They’ve never fully funded education and made it equitable for all children, so this taking money away - all this does is this is going to help the wealthy kids,” said Franklin.\n\nWhen asked what he means, he replied, “You can go through the history of private schools. They created private schools during the time where they didn’t want to go to school with us as African Americans.”\n\n“They can’t discriminate but they have to take the children if they come to them and if any child wants to come and their borders are open so to speak so that’s kind of the plan,” said Orr.\n\nHe adds private schools would have to test their children with nationally recognized testing and be accredited by a nationally known accrediting institution.\n\n“Can’t be for us, because the majority of us are going to stay in traditional public schools,” said Franklin.\n\nAt the signing ceremony, Governor Ivey said this new law will not only work for Alabama families, but will work for the sate and will be effective for generations. She also reiterated her commitment to public education, saying she wants every Alabama student -- no matter the zip code -- to have a quality education.\n\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here."
