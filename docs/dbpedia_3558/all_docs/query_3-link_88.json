        "text": "Schools for the working classes\n\nSince the state was still unwilling to provide mass education, it was left to the working classes to provide their own schools or to rely on others - mostly the churches - to supply some basic education for their children. By 1750 'schools of some kind were within geographical reach of all but comparatively few children' (Stephens 1998:1).\n\nIn England and Wales there was a wide range of elementary schools, some private, some connected with parish churches; while in Scotland most towns had charity and private schools alongside the burgh and parish schools.\n\nMost of the Scottish public schools were, in practice, mainly elementary but, unlike the vast majority of elementary schools south of the border, might also provide post-elementary instruction, including mathematics and Latin, and send boys at 15 or younger to the universities (Stephens 1998:1).\n\nThe types of school described below were not mutually exclusive: elementary schools were often monitorial schools, for example.\n\nCharity schools\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, most charity schools trained poor children for a specific status in society and for particular occupations, while the endowed schools sought to provide both basic literacy and a higher education in the classical tradition. However, the demarcation between the education of the poor and the middle classes was not always clear. In Lancashire, for example,\n\nthe attendance of middle-class children at a charity school such as the one in Lancaster, and of poorer children at a grammar school such as the one in Bury, made the two kinds of school barely distinguishable. ... Some schools maintained the uneasy balance, most gravitated in one direction or the other (Lawson and Silver 1973:238).\n\nFew charity schools were endowed in Scotland, where bequests for educating poor children in existing schools were preferred.\n\nExceptions, however, existed in the so-called hospitals founded for orphans, mainly in towns, and in schools set up in remote parts of the highlands by the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (virtually an arm of the Church of Scotland) and supported by the government (Stephens 1998:2).\n\nScottish charity schools varied greatly: they all taught religion; most taught reading, writing and sometimes arithmetic; some 'offered a broader education embracing also modern subjects, book-keeping, navigation, music and drawing'; others, especially in towns, 'became middle-class preserves, teaching the classics and preparing some pupils for the universities' (Stephens 1998:3).\n\nWhile the charity schools continued to provide education for the poor, often in the form of schools of industry, they were soon to be superseded by the monitorial schools, which could teach more children, more cheaply.\n\nDame and private-venture schools\n\nThe dame and private-venture schools provided 'a large quantity of poor-quality education' (Lawson and Silver 1973:280). Most of the dame schools were run by women for infants. They taught reading and sometimes a little writing. The private-venture schools took pupils up to around the age of ten and 'covered the 3Rs plus sewing and knitting for girls and perhaps grammar, geography and other subjects for older children' (Stephens 1998:1-2).\n\nBoth in age range and curriculum,\n\nthe distinction between these two types of school was often blurred. They probably multiplied in the eighteenth century and in England and Wales remained an important aspect of working-class culture well into the following century, especially in industrial areas (Stephens 1998:2).\n\nIn 1834-5 Manchester Statistical Society found them\n\nin the most deplorable condition. The greater part of them are kept by females, but some by old men, whose only qualification for this employment seems to be their unfitness for every other (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:280).\n\nOne Yorkshire teacher, for example, who was hunchbacked and 'very deaf and ignorant', had been appointed by parish authorities to save them the cost of supporting him. His case was 'not untypical' (Lawson and Silver 1973:280).\n\nDame and private-venture schools began to decline in numbers in the 1830s and 1840s as new types of school were developed in response to the demands of a changing society.\n\nChurch schools\n\nEngland and Wales\n\nUnlike some influential taxpayers and those who benefited from employing children, the Church of England was in favour of mass education - as 'a means of combating the influence on the working classes of nonconformity and the consequences of Catholic emancipation and Irish immigration' (Stephens 1998:13).\n\nIn 1811 it set up the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church (which, for obvious reasons, became generally known as the National Society), with the aim of providing a school in every parish. Local clergy 'often took on this initiative wholeheartedly' (Gates 2005:16), with or without the benefit of special donations. The curriculum of the schools was basically the 'three Rs' plus religion:\n\nThe inclusion of the fourth \"R\" of religion, alongside the other three (reading, writing and 'rithmetic), was simply assumed as right. It took the form of the Bible, catechism and prayer book services (Gates 2005:16).\n\nOther Christians, along with liberal Anglicans and some Roman Catholics and Jews, preferred a less denominational approach and in 1814 founded the British and Foreign School Society for the Education of the Labouring and Manufacturing Classes of Society of Every Religious Persuasion (the British and Foreign School Society). Its schools drew on the pioneering work of Joseph Lancaster (of whom more below). They taught Scripture and general Christian principles in a non-denominational form.\n\nA third group, who wanted religion kept out of schools altogether, formed another organisation, the Central Society of Education, in 1836. This attracted little interest, however, and it was the rivalry between the other two - the National Society and the British and Foreign School Society - which 'delayed the introduction of a fully comprehensive school system funded by public taxation' (Gates 2005:16).\n\nThis rivalry was often vicious. In 1814, for example, the Bishop of London proclaimed that 'Every populous village unprovided with a National School must be regarded as a stronghold abandoned to the enemy' (ie the nonconformists), while a vicar described British schools as 'dreadful machines ... full frought with moral and religious evil to Church and Country' (quoted in Stephens 1998:13-14).\n\nThe government was unwilling to intervene or take the lead for fear of appearing to promote one group over the other, so in 1833 it began giving annual grants towards school provision to both the National Society and the British and Foreign School Society. From 1846 similar grants were given to Baptists and Congregationalists (subject to an agreement about the reading of Scripture), from 1847 to Wesleyan Methodists and the Catholic Poor School Committee, and in 1853 to the Manchester Jewish community (subject to an agreement about the reading of at least part of the Bible) (Gates 2005:16).\n\nThe Church of England resisted the introduction of a 'conscience clause' which would have allowed children of dissenters to attend its schools without fear of religious offence. And a ruling that only the Authorised Version of the Bible was acceptable delayed the granting of aid to Roman Catholic schools. The 1861 Newcastle Report (of which more in the next chapter) noted the problems these rulings caused in areas where there was only one school, such as villages.\n\nVillage schools, which were 'of great importance in the overall pattern of education' (Lawson and Silver 1973:249), often became National Society schools:\n\nSome were supported by the parish or subscriptions, some were established as charity schools, others were decayed endowed schools or indistinguishable from dame schools. The majority of them were Church of England schools and became National schools, often adopting the monitorial system in spite of their small size. It was not uncommon throughout the century for village schools to have average attendances of twenty or thirty, though many were very much larger. Those village schools which were sponsored in this way, and found an adequate financial basis, continued in many cases with only small changes through to the mid-twentieth century (Lawson and Silver 1973:249).\n\nScotland\n\nThe 1696 Act for Settling of Schools had required every parish in Scotland to have a school, and the 1803 Parochial Schools (Scotland) Act had laid down rules regarding schoolmasters' salaries and conditions of employment.\n\nInter-church rivalry, however, was as prevalent in Scotland as in England. Fearful of losing its influence over the young, the Established Church campaigned in the 1820s and 1830s for a stronger public-school system under its own control but financed by the government.\n\nThe refusal of the government to agree to this arrangement led the church to begin opening its own 'assembly' schools and was a contributory factor in the 'Disruption' of 1843, when evangelicals left the Established Church and formed the Free Church, which then established several hundred of its own schools.\n\nBoth the Established Church and the Free Church, as well as the other churches which set up schools in Scotland at this time, regarded schooling, in part at least, as a means of retaining members' loyalty, initiating the young in their traditions and proselytizing the poor (Stephens 1998:13).\n\nIn the Scottish parochial schools 'it was always accepted that older pupils should be able to enjoy an extended curriculum and that schoolmasters should be capable of preparing pupils for the universities' (Stephens 1998:17). In 1826 more than half the parochial schools in the highlands and islands were said to be teaching Latin and book-keeping, a third were teaching Greek and English grammar, while around a quarter of the schools included modern languages, mathematics, geography, mensuration, navigation and other subjects in their curriculum.\n\nThus, though many poorer pupils were taught little more than religion and the 3Rs, 'the opportunity for social advancement through a broader education was there for the children of those who could afford to keep them at school' (Stephens 1998:17).\n\nSunday schools\n\nSunday schools have often been regarded as a spin-off of the charity school movement, their creation credited to individuals such as Hannah More, Sarah Trimmer (1741-1810) and Robert Raikes (1736-1811). But Rosemary O'Day argues that 'no single person can be credited with the beginnings of the movement, for it was rooted, somewhat obscurely, in the past' (O'Day 1982:255).\n\nHowever, Raikes was certainly an important influence. An evangelical churchman and editor of the Gloucester Journal, he founded four small Sunday schools in Gloucestershire in 1781, and in 1783 published an account of his work with street urchins. His example was followed by Methodists, evangelicals and the wider church, and the movement quickly spread nationwide, with some factory owners opening schools at their works. The (predominantly Anglican) Sunday School Society, set up in 1785, spread information and gave spelling books and Bibles - and occasionally grants - to individual schools. By the later 1780s, however, 'the Sunday schools had become a much more frequent recipient of middle-class benefactions' (O'Day 1982:255).\n\nThe purpose of the schools was simple: to teach the poor - both children and adults - to read the Bible and, in Hannah More's words, 'to train up the lower classes in habits of industry and piety' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:239). They did not teach writing or arithmetic or any of the 'more dangerous subjects' which were 'less necessary or even harmful' (Williams 1961:136). Hannah More believed writing was an 'unnecessary accomplishment for the poor' (Lawson and Silver 1973:240), a view which was widely held, especially by the Wesleyans. She taught only from 'safe books' - approved catechisms, prayers and tracts. 'The child was never taught to think critically, and was not encouraged to become actively literate' (O'Day 1982:256).\n\nHannah More and others who founded Sunday schools in the later eighteenth century saw the schools as a way to giving poor children or children from immoral homes what middle-class and wealthy children were obtaining from their home or school life. They did not see the Sunday schools in terms of social control but of religious revival. ... The schools were neither an educational nor a social charity by intent (O'Day 1982:256).\n\nWhile the Sunday schools of the late eighteenth century 'did not cater exclusively for members of the working classes, let alone the pauper classes', in the nineteenth century, the movement 'exclusively belonged to working-class culture' (O'Day 1982:256). The schools were popular in large industrial cities, especially in the midlands and the north. Manchester's interdenominational Sunday school had 1,800 pupils in 1784 and by 1788 that number had trebled (O'Day 1982:256).\n\nBut the schools were also strong in many rural communities, and it has been estimated that, by the 1820s, almost all working-class children had attended Sunday schools at some time, with an average attendance of four years. Under largely working-class teachers, they studied reading, spelling and religion for between four and six hours every Sunday (O'Day 1982:256).\n\nThere were widely differing views about the Sunday schools. Despite their very limited aims, they were regarded by some as subversive. In the 'Blagdon Controversy', one of Hannah More's schools became the focus of hostility from a hard-line conservative faction in the church and was eventually forced to close in 1804 (Lawson and Silver 1973:241).\n\nOthers, however, valued the work of the Sunday schools. In 1841, an inspector described Norfolk's Sunday schools as 'until recently the chief instrument of instruction, and in many parishes still such' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:280). And the biographer of infant-school founder David Stow (of whom more below), writing in 1868, said the Sunday schools had been 'by far the most efficient instrument for excavating a portion of the heathen population from the general mass of ignorance and depravity' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:280).\n\nIt is difficult to assess the Sunday schools' effect on literacy levels. In 1800 the schools had around 200,000 pupils, not all of them working-class. O'Day argues that, while some of these might have learned to read anyway, many more would not have done so had it not been for the revival of the Sunday schools (O'Day 1982:258).\n\nSome Sunday schools began to open on weekday evenings and this led to the next phase of development - the monitorial schools.\n\nMonitorial schools\n\nThe monitorial system was effectively the industrialisation of the teaching process. Two rival systems (though in practice there was very little difference between them) were devised by the Quaker Joseph Lancaster (1778-1838) and the Scottish Episcopalian priest Dr Andrew Bell (1753-1832). Between them, they created 'a piece of social machinery that was both simple and economical, an instrument suited to the needs and outlook of the times' (Lawson and Silver 1973:241). Bell called his system 'the steam engine of the moral world' (quoted in Williams 1961:136). (Young and Hancock (1956:830) ascribe this quotation to Henry Brougham).\n\nLancaster opened his first school for poor children, at Borough Road, Southwark, in 1798. It attracted widespread interest because, as one supporter put it, its organisation made possible 'the education of every poor child in the kingdom at a very trifling expense to the public' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:241). Ten years later Lancaster was in severe financial difficulty and the Royal Lancasterian Society was formed to continue his work. In 1814 this became the British and Foreign School Society.\n\nBell, meanwhile, had conducted a monitorial experiment in Madras, which he described in his 1797 book An Experiment in Education. The Church of England adopted Bell's system when, in 1811, it set up its National Society in opposition to Lancaster's non-denominational schools.\n\nThere were many heated debates about which of the two men had the greater claim to have founded the monitorial (or 'mutual') system, and about the relative merits of their slightly different regimes. Despite the arguments, the system dominated popular education for half a century: British (Lanacasterian) and National (Church of England) schools competed with one another - often with some hostility - all over the country, with the National Society being by far the larger of the two societies (Lawson and Silver 1973:242).\n\nEach school contained a single large schoolroom, so that 'the master could keep the whole school under scrutiny' (Lawson and Silver 1973:242). In Lancasterian schools\n\nthe central area was filled with rows of benches for writing drill, and the surrounding space, where the bulk of the time was spent, was occupied by 'drafts' of children standing for instruction by their monitor, usually with the aid of cards hung on the wall (Lawson and Silver 1973:242).\n\nIn Bell's schools this arrangement was effectively reversed:\n\nthe desks for writing occupied the outer space, facing the wall, and the central area was used by classes of children standing in squares for instruction by their monitors (called 'teachers' and 'assistants' under the National system) (Lawson and Silver 1973:242).\n\nThere were usually ten children under a monitor, though in National schools there could be as many as twenty. Reading (from the Bible or other religious texts), writing and arithmetic were taught in boys' schools, plus needlework in girls' schools. The master taught the monitors, who were usually aged about ten or eleven, and they then passed on this teaching to their groups, recommended pupils for promotion, and kept order.\n\nThe process was regulated by a system of rewards and punishments. Typical rewards included a penny for the best boy of the week in a class or a halfpence for being promoted; a monitor might earn up to two pence a week, 'merit tickets' or books (Lawson and Silver 1973:242-3). Punishments were given for 'swearing, lying, quarrelling, talking, coming to school dirty or late, playing truant, telling tales, being disobedient or absent from church' (Lawson and Silver 1973:243). Typically, these included being shut in a dark cupboard or suspended in a basket, being handcuffed or washed in public, wearing a fool's cap or expulsion. Corporal punishment, however, was rarely used.\n\nLike their predecessors, monitorial schools aimed to discipline 'the infant poor to good and orderly habits, to train them to early piety' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:243). A typical expression of the purpose of a National school (in this case Kennington, south London, in the 1820s) was\n\nto confer upon the Children of the Poor the Inestimable Benefit of Religious Instruction, combined with such other Acquirements as may be suitable to their Stations in Life, and calculated to render them useful and respectable Members of Society (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:243).\n\nFor newly-industrialised England, the monitorial system seemed ideal - it was simple and inexpensive and it provided 'at least a modicum of education, in a way that no other system could have done at the time, and where otherwise none might have existed' (Lawson and Silver 1973:246). It was enthusiastically supported by Bentham and the utilitarians, and was adopted by some schools outside the two societies - even by Charterhouse in 1813.\n\nBut the system had two significant weaknesses. First, as Henry Craik noted in 1896, pupils\n\nwho were little more than infants, without training, without special instruction, with no qualifying test, were set to waste their own time and that of their still younger companions under the nominal supervision of the teacher (Craik 1896:33 quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:245).\n\nAnd second, there was a lack of adequately trained teachers. Although both societies offered some training, this amounted to little more than mastering the mechanics of the system. Indeed, teachers who were trained for National Society schools were forbidden to depart from 'the beautiful and efficient simplicity of the system' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:241).\n\nFor William Thompson, the 'radical defect in the systems of Bell and Lancaster' was that 'the understanding is by them altogether sacrificed to the memory'. As a result, pupils were trained 'to co-operate with existing institutions in forming passive habits of blind obedience' (quoted in Simon 1974:207-8).\n\nThe quality of education did not improve until the monitorial system declined and 'a new approach to the training of teachers was inaugurated at the end of the 1830s' (Lawson and Silver 1973:246).\n\nBentham's Chrestomathic School\n\nA small group of thinkers led by Jeremy Bentham and Francis Place, impressed by developments in Scotland, Prussia, France and Holland, sought to establish higher grade elementary schools and monitorial secondary schools to meet the needs of the class immediately above the very poor. Bentham's 'Chrestomathic Scheme' for the education of 7 to 14 year olds, devised around 1816, included science and technology as an integral part of the curriculum - 'indeed the central core of the educational process' (Simon 1974:80).\n\nAfter a preparatory stage learning the three Rs, science forms the major part of each of the five stages of instruction advocated; study begins with the descriptive and classificatory sciences (mineralogy, botany, zoology), proceeds through the various branches of mechanics, chemistry and physics (concentrating especially on electricity) and ends with the application of these sciences in the 'school of technology' (mining, surveying, architecture, husbandry, etc.). History, geography, and languages are taught from the second stage onwards; at the fourth stage 'the art of preserving as well as restoring health, including the arts and sciences thereto belonging' forms the body of teaching. Mathematics, on account of its difficulty, is postponed to the end of the course (Simon 1974:80).\n\nBentham justified the teaching of these subjects by reference to their utility in ordinary life. (Chrestomathic comes from two Greek words meaning useful and learning.) Knowledge, he argued, must serve the social function of preparing children to earn their living. Furthermore, the educational process must be systematic: 'The body of knowledge which the child is expected to master, set out in the encyclopaedic table, is systematised and, of course, imposed by the educator' (Simon 1974:81).\n\nHe was also concerned about school management, and defined forty-three principles which would 'provide the conditions necessary to ensure that learning took place with maximum efficiency' (Simon 1974:81). Many of these were derived from the ideas of Andrew Bell; others are of interest because they presaged what was to become common practice. 'Symptomatic of the capitalist epoch is the great emphasis put on individual competition as the main incentive for work' (Simon 1974:81).\n\nBentham's plan to open a Chrestomathic school in Leicester Square was opposed by local shopkeepers, but there was more widespread hostility to his insistence on the exclusion of religion. Clerical influence ensured that those who at first encouraged the project later abandoned it (Simon 1974:82) and the Chrestomathic school never came into being.\n\nRobert Owen's infant schools\n\nHaving spent his childhood in a Welsh village, Robert Owen (pictured) moved to Manchester and joined the Literary and Philosophical Society where he learned the language and ideals of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment.\n\nBy the 1790s he was one of the town's leading cotton spinners, and then in 1800 he moved to Scotland to become director of the New Lanark cotton mills, which he made 'one of the showplaces of Europe' (Lawson and Silver 1973: 246).\n\nLike the philosophic radicals, Owen was\n\nchiefly concerned to find the solution to the problem of pauperism. But his approach was, by comparison with that of Bentham and Mill, not merely rational within the limits of the iron laws of political economy, but broadly humanist (Simon 1974:193-4).\n\nHis two books, A New View of Society (1813) and Report to the County of Lanark (1821), represent one of the earliest statements of socialist principles to be published in Britain and clearly illustrate Owen's humanity and compassion:\n\nShall the well-being of millions of the poor, half-naked, half-famished, untaught and untrained, hourly increasing to a most alarming extent in these islands, not call forth one petition, one delegate, or one rational effective legislative measure? (Owen 1813:108).\n\nAdult working hours were still entirely unregulated and children as young as five were worked to the point of exhaustion in factories and mines, sometimes at night. In his article On the Employment of Children in Manufactures, published in 1818, Owen wrote:\n\nWe are unacquainted with any nation, ancient or modern, that has suffered its hundreds of thousands of children of seven to twelve years of age to work incessantly for 15 hours per day, in an overheated unhealthy atmosphere, allowing them only 40 minutes out of that time for dinner and change of air, which they breathe often in damp cellars or in garretts, in confined streets or dirty lanes (quoted in Simon 1974:171-2).\n\nHe argued that to talk about the diffusion of knowledge or universal education under these conditions was 'little more than self-deception if a little less than hypocrisy' (Simon 1974:172).\n\nFundamental to Owen's educational approach was his conviction that a man's character was formed by the circumstances in which he lived. This idea was not, of course, new:\n\nIt was this theory that Joseph Priestley had developed, that Godwin held, that James Mill explained in detail in his famous article. In this sense, Owen gives expression to the materialist view stemming originally from Hobbes and Locke, developed by Hartley and the French sensationalists Helvetius and Condillac, and perfected in the late eighteenth century primarily by the French philosophes (Simon 1974:195).\n\nWhat was new in Owen's contribution to education was the humanism with which he applied the theory:\n\nHe was not concerned to use education to inculcate particular beliefs or theories, nor with happiness conceived of in an abstract way, but sought rather to educate children as human beings capable of applying their reason to nature and society and of enjoying all aspects of life. In the New Lanark schools these ideas were translated into practice (Simon 1974:195).\n\nOwen regarded the monitorial system as an important development and gave Bell and Lancaster financial support, but he was critical of the lack of well-trained teachers in their schools. In 1816 he told the Select Committee on the Education of the Lower Orders in the Metropolis: 'it is impossible, in my opinion, for one master to do justice to children, when they attempt to educate a great number without proper assistance' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:246).\n\nHe decided to show that it was possible to do better and, as part of his scheme to improve the lives of his workers and their families, he opened his first infant school around 1813. Children were admitted at the age of two or three and cared for while their parents were at work in the local cotton mills. The instruction of children under six was to consist of 'whatever might be supposed useful that they could understand, and much attention was devoted to singing, dancing, and playing' (Hadow 1931:3).\n\nInfant schools were thus at first partly 'minding schools' for young children in industrial areas; but they also sought to promote the children's physical well-being and to offer opportunities for their moral and social training and to provide some elementary instruction in the three Rs, so that the children could make more rapid progress when they entered the monitorial school.\n\nOwen's schools catered for children up to the age of ten (the age at which many started work in the mills). By 1816, three hundred were attending his schools during the day, with another four hundred taking part in evening studies and activities. Ten or eleven teachers were employed in the day schools; two or three in the evenings.\n\nOwen's schools were significantly different from the monitorial schools in terms of their ethos, curriculum and organisation:\n\nThe children were governed 'not by severity, but by kindness'. There were no rewards or punishments. What the children had to learn was 'conveyed to them in as pleasant and agreeable a manner as can be devised'. The curriculum consisted of reading, writing and arithmetic, sewing, natural history, geography, history, religious knowledge, singing and dancing. The infants spent half the time in small groups doing simple lessons, and half the time, under supervision, 'they are allowed to amuse themselves at perfect freedom, in a large paved area in front of the Institution' (Lawson and Silver 1973:247).\n\nOwen regarded his work at New Lanark as incomplete and imperfect, but his infant schools were to become 'one of the outstanding educational phenomena of the nineteenth century' (Lawson and Silver 1973:246). They were important because they convinced others that it was possible to overcome the problems of industrialisation and change. 'The memory of New Lanark and its infant school was strong in popular movements right through the century' (Lawson and Silver 1973:247).\n\nA group led by the radical Whig politician Henry Brougham and the historian and philosopher James Mill (both Scots) established an infant school on Owen's lines in London in 1818, and imported a teacher from New Lanark.\n\nIn 1824, Owen's nonconformist partners insisted on changes with which he was clearly unhappy because a year later he left for America, hoping to establish there the ideal co-operative community. The project failed and he returned to England in 1828 to find that his social and educational ideals were already being taken up by others. Workers had begun to set up co-operative communities in which education was seen as fundamental. The Chartists and other radical movements adopted these ideas in the 1830s and later.\n\nOwen's work also led to the birth of several societies for the creation of infant schools. The Infant School Society, founded in 1824 by Samuel Wilderspin (1792-1866), spread nationwide. Wilderspin's system of infant education left its mark for many years on the curriculum and buildings of elementary schools. This may not have been entirely a good thing, since he had 'a mistaken zeal for the initiation of children at too early an age to formal instruction' (Hadow 1931:3). A Glasgow Infant School Society was founded by David Stow (1793-1864) in 1827.\n\nIn 1836 Charles Mayo (1792-1846) and his daughter founded the Home and Colonial Institution (later known as the Home and Colonial Society) to establish infant schools and to train teachers for them. These schools reflected the influence of continental educators, particularly the Swiss educational reformer Pestalozzi (1746-1827), and the 'object lesson' became a major feature of nineteenth-century English schooling. The temptation, however, was to regard the infant school as a 'moral training centre and preparatory department' for the monitorial school (Lawson and Silver 1973:248). Mayo, for example, suggested that an object such as a leaf or a flower would\n\nform an interesting groundwork for a lesson. Alive to impressions made through their senses, the little ones will by such means be roused to attention, and when the intelligence is awake and stirring, the teacher should gradually lead them to the moral lesson or the holy doctrine, connected in Scripture with the object he has shewn them (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:248).\n\nThe religious and moral purposes of the infant school were 'intensified in the 1840s' (Lawson and Silver 1973:282). In 1845 an inspector described the work of the British Society's infant schools as being 'wholly drawn from, based in, or illumined by the words of Holy Writ' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:282). And in 1846 the Home and Colonial Infant School Society defined the 'primary object of early education' as being\n\nto cultivate religious principles and moral sentiments; to awaken the tender mind to a sense of its evil dispositions and habitual failings, before it is become callous by its daily intercourse with vice (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:282).\n\nMany infant schools used a variety of apparatus and books, and their curriculum 'combined formalized scripture lessons with reading, writing and arithmetic (often taught by monitors), and varying degrees of physical exercise and play' (Lawson and Silver 1973:282). Nonetheless, the focus was still on religious instruction and by the age of seven an infant was expected not only to have a range of intellectual accomplishments, but to be 'be able to regulate his own conduct by the precepts of morality and religion' (Currie 1862:174-5 quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:282).\n\nThe ideas of Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852), the German educationalist, came to England in the mid-1850s. They\n\nwere immediately the source of experiments, but they were only taken up by the Home and Colonial Society and the British Society in the 1860s and 1870s; from then on they formed the basis for the reinterpretation of infant and junior teaching that was central to the new education movement at the end of the century (Lawson and Silver 1973:283).\n\nStephens argues that the infant school movement was\n\nless significant for its immediate impact on the education of the poor than for its initial pioneering of progressive pedagogical methods associated with Wilderspin, Stow, Pestalozzi and Froebel. These influenced advanced teaching methods in later periods but in practice the schools themselves failed to replace the dame schools in working-class favour and most gradually succumbed to traditional rote-learning and moral and religious instruction, losing any distinctive reason to exist (Stephens 1998:10).\n\nElementary schools\n\nThe question of how to organise children above the age of six in elementary schools was first addressed by David Stow, who began his work around 1824. In addition to founding Glasgow's Infant School Society, he opened the Glasgow Normal School for training teachers and became a significant figure in the development of educational theory and practice. He believed that in primary education the living voice was more important than the printed page, so he laid great stress on oral class teaching (Hadow 1931:6).\n\nHe conceived a graded system of elementary education, with an initiatory department for children of two or three to six years of age, and a juvenile department for children between the ages of six and 14, itself divided into junior and senior divisions. He described this scheme in his 1836 book Training System of Education for the Moral and Intellectual Elevation of Youth, especially in large Towns and Manufacturing Villages (Hadow 1931:6).\n\nThere were several practical objections to his system: it was costly, the school life of most children was short, and teachers could not be obtained in sufficient numbers. As a result, few schools were established using Stow's system, and the usual arrangement was an infant department for children up to the age of six, and a senior department for 6-12 year olds. In each case the master or mistress was assisted by monitors (Hadow 1931:7).\n\nSmall 'all-age' schools for children between 6 and 12 often developed into schools with three or more classes, in which one teacher took a section for an oral lesson, while assistant teachers took other sections for written work in arithmetic and for exercises in reading, dictation and composition. This system became common after about 1856 (Hadow 1931:7).\n\nKay-Shuttleworth recognised the shortcomings of the monitorial system and made an important contribution to the general development of primary education by introducing a modified form of the pupil-teacher system (see the section on Teacher training below), so preparing the way for a large supply of adult teachers (Hadow 1931:7).\n\nImpressed by the practical work he had seen in Swiss schools, Kay-Shuttleworth also attempted to introduce more practical instruction into England's elementary schools. In the Regulations for the education of pupil teachers and stipendiary monitors, which he submitted to the Privy Council in December 1846, it was provided that pupil teachers at the end of their fourth year should be examined by the Inspector 'in the first steps in mensuration with practical illustrations, and in the elements of land surveying and levelling'; while the women pupil-teachers in every year of their course were expected 'to show increased skill as seamstresses, and teachers of sewing, knitting, etc' (quoted in Hadow 1926:9).\n\nHowever, Kay-Shuttleworth's efforts had little effect on the great mass of elementary schools, in which vocational training took second place to academic studies. There were several reasons for this:\n\nfirstly, most elementary schools were set up and run by university graduates with literary and scientific interests. They wanted more culture in the schools, and there was a noticeable tendency to emphasise the superiority of a general non-manual education over any sort of vocational training such as that given in the schools of industry (Hadow 1926:9);\n\nsecondly, it was soon discovered that any effective form of practical instruction cost much more than the teaching of the three Rs;\n\nthirdly, it was almost impossible to arrange for practical instruction in large classes taught by monitors; and\n\nfourthly, owing to the growth of commerce and sea-borne trade in the mid-nineteenth century, there was a great demand for clerks, and in schools where advanced work for older pupils was attempted it was found much easier to train them for clerical work than for manual occupations.\n\nMatthew Arnold, writing about 1858, considered that the humane studies in the upper classes of the best elementary schools were by far the most interesting part of the curriculum (Hadow 1926:10).\n\nVocational education\n\n'Schools of industry' were set up to provide the poor with manual training and elementary instruction. Such a school opened at Kendal in the Lake District in 1799. The Records of the Society for Bettering the Conditions of the Poor (III. 300-312) show that\n\nthe children were taught reading and writing, geography and religion. Thirty of the older girls were employed in knitting, sewing, spinning and housework, and 36 younger girls were employed in knitting only. The older boys were taught shoemaking, and the younger boys prepared machinery for carding wool. The older girls assisted in preparing breakfast, which was provided in the school at a small weekly charge. They were also taught laundry work. The staff consisted of one schoolmaster, two teachers of spinning and knitting, and one teacher for shoemaking (Hadow 1926:3-4).\n\nThe government established a 'Normal School of Design' in London in 1837 and, from 1841 onwards, made annual grants for the maintenance of some provincial schools of design. In 1846 it also began making grants to day schools of industry towards the provision of gardens, trade workshops, kitchens and wash-houses, and for gratuities to the masters who taught boys gardening and crafts and to the mistresses who gave 'satisfactory instruction in domestic economy' (Hadow 1926:9).\n\nHowever, because the Industrial Revolution had given Britain a head start in world trade, the government saw no reason why the state should be involved in the training of industrial recruits, so modernisation of the old apprenticeship system was left to voluntary agencies.\n\nIt was only when the Great Exhibition of 1851 drew public attention to the lack of facilities for technical education in England, compared with those provided in various continental countries, that the government felt compelled to become more involved.\n\nIn 1852 a Department of Practical Art was created under the Board of Trade. In 1856 this was moved into the Education Department as the Department of Science and Art, and in 1859 it began setting examinations - for both teachers and students - in branches of science related to industrial occupations (Spens 1938:51).\n\nMeanwhile, the 1854 Literary and Scientific Institutions Act (11 August) facilitated the establishment of institutions for the promotion of literature, science and the arts.\n\nThe education of girls\n\nSchooling for girls 'broadened in these decades, but with the same defects' (Lawson and Silver 1973:286). Needlework was 'ubiquitous' (and a condition of grants after 1862), and often replaced arithmetic.\n\nThe Annual Report on the State of the Charity Schools of the Kennington District for 1832 found that the girls spent four afternoons a week doing needlework provided by 'several respectable families in the neighbourhood'. In 1831 profits had been used to provide 'Forty of the deserving Girls with Cloaks, Frocks, Bonnets, and Tippets, in which they appear at Church on Sundays' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:287).\n\nSome of the endowed schools made provision for girls, and the mechanics' institutes and social movements, notably the Owenites, often provided adult education for women. But it was the Sunday schools which probably made 'the greatest contribution to improving literacy among girls in the early and middle nineteenth century' (Lawson and Silver 1973:287).\n\nStephens notes that in 1851 a smaller proportion of girls than boys aged 5-14 attended school in every English county. In agricultural areas girls tended to stay longer at school than boys, but in areas with high levels of female industrial employment - notably in the textile factories - girls' attendance at school was more irregular than that of boys and they left at an earlier age (Stephens 1998:38).\n\nLiteracy rates reflected the different experience of schooling of boys and girls. In some places boys enjoyed higher standards of instruction than girls. Also, the fact that many girls left school earlier than boys meant that 'they did not reach the stage when writing instruction began, and anyway the curriculum for girls was less directed towards writing and often paid more attention to sewing' (Stephens 1998:38). In the early 1850s almost ninety per cent of all children in England and Scotland were learning to read; but, while just over sixty per cent of boys were learning to write, the figures for girls were 56 per cent in England and 52 per cent in Scotland (Stephens 1998:38-9).\n\nEducation in Wales\n\nIn October 1846, in response to a motion in the House of Commons, the Committee of the Privy Council on Education appointed three Commissioners to inquire into The State of Education in Wales. The motion asked Her Majesty\n\nto direct an inquiry to be made into the state of education in the Principality of Wales, especially into the means afforded to the labouring classes of acquiring knowledge of the English language (page i).\n\nThe Commissioners' reports, published in 1848, are an invaluable resource for both educational and social historians. They paint an appalling picture of what life was like for the poor in mid-19th century Wales (and no doubt in the rest of the UK). Many families lived in hovels hardly fit for animals, sometimes with heaps of human excrement outside the front door. The children were often poorly fed and dressed in rags. And if they were lucky enough to receive any education at all, it was usually little more than learning by rote the church catechism and other religious claptrap. Indeed, it seems to me it that much of it was mental cruelty verging on child abuse. (But then I write as an atheist: you are, of course, perfectly entitled to take a different view.)\n\nThe very poor\n\nThree types of school - workhouse schools, ragged schools and industrial and reformatory schools - attempted to educate the very poorest children.\n\nWorkhouse schools\n\nThe religious revivalists of the late eighteenth century had a more positive view of the value of all children than many of those who ran the workhouses. Even the evangelists, however, did not call for full-time education for the working-class child. The general view was that academic education for the poor was a bad thing; what was needed was industrial and 'useful' training. Social mobility was therefore impeded rather than increased (O'Day 1982:259).\n\nThis view continued to be prevalent for much of the nineteenth century. The 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act (14 August) - 'designed to be a harsh deterrent' (Lawson and Silver 1973:283) - proposed that all relief should be given in workhouses, and that pauper children should receive education on a daily basis. However, many poor-law guardians were hostile to the idea of educating pauper children so the Act was limited in its effect. Further legislation in 1845, which permitted the establishment of district schools where children from workhouses in different parishes could be educated, was equally unsuccessful - only six of these district schools had been opened by 1859.\n\nFrom 1846 the government granted £30,000 a year towards the salaries of workhouse teachers in an attempt to improve their wretched conditions:\n\nIn 1847, an inspection of forty-one workhouses in the northern counties found that the teachers in twenty-five of them were themselves paupers, most of them 'grossly incompetent, cannot write, or spell, or ask a question in a proper manner' (Lawson and Silver 1973:283).\n\nCampaigners realised that education was virtually impossible for children living in the workhouse environment. In 1861 Louisa Twining wrote:\n\nthe utter helplessness and incapacity of workhouse children has become almost proverbial ... Their acquaintance with life is bounded by the four blank walls of their school and dormitory, and their dreary yard called a playground (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:283).\n\nDespite the many concerns, the practice of keeping children in workhouses with adults continued until the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nRagged schools\n\nAround 1818 John Pounds (1766-1839), a Portsmouth cobbler, collected together a group of ragged children and tried to give them some care and training. His initiative was later taken up by others, notably Lord Shaftesbury, who helped to form the Ragged School Union in 1844. Horace Mann said the ragged schools aimed 'to convert incipient criminals to Christianity' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:285), but in practice they were\n\na blend of Christian mission and the need to provide a simple level of care for the most deprived children, if education was to be possible at all. Some of the schools lodged the children, most fed them. They sought out vagrant children and used whatever makeshift accommodation they could find. They helped the children to work as shoeblacks and some of them to emigrate (Lawson and Silver 1973:285).\n\nScottish ragged schools, and a few in England and Wales, were nondenominational day schools. They taught the 3Rs but their emphasis was on industrial training for potential delinquents. Most English ragged schools, however, concentrated on the 3Rs and 'strongly evangelical religious instruction'. In these, 'humanitarian care for the destitute overshadowed anti-delinquent motives' (Stephens 1998:10). More than thirty provincial and Welsh schools developed along these lines.\n\nFrom the 1850s those ragged schools which provided craft training received government grants and were absorbed into the penal system as 'certified' industrial schools. After 1870, some ragged schools were taken over by school boards, and the Union concentrated on ragged Sunday schools up to the 1890s.\n\nIndustrial and reformatory schools\n\nDuring this period, industrial schools became schools to which children under fourteen could be committed as vagrants. They provided a basic education, plus some craft training for boys and domestic skills for girls.\n\nReformatory schools, for offenders under sixteen who had served a minimum of fourteen days in prison, were given official recognition by the 1854 Youthful Offenders Act (10 August). 'Not until the 1890s was the reformatory school made a complete substitute for a prison sentence' (Lawson and Silver 1973:285).\n\nScotland\n\nScotland also suffered the problem of vagrancy.\n\nEdinburgh's workhouses, which had been open since the 1740s, housed boys and girls separately from adults and were 'comparatively well run with low mortality rates by the standards of the time' (O'Day 1982:252). The Charity Workhouse of Edinburgh (1743), supported by the Scottish Society for the Preservation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), emphasised religious, vernacular and technical training. The Canongate and West Kirk workhouses, opened in 1761, each had a teacher: Canongate taught vocational subjects and catechism; West Kirk additionally offered the three Rs and church music.\n\nThe city's orphan hospital, which had opened in 1733, gave religious instruction and industrial training plus some reading, writing, arithmetic and church music. By 1784 it had 130 orphans.\n\nThe SSPCK's three working schools in Edinburgh, founded in 1758, taught mainly spinning, stocking knitting, the three Rs and church music:\n\nThese three charity working schools formed one part of an agreement with the Edinburgh town council whereby the town council supported four English schools with a schoolmaster and curriculum approved by the presbytery. The high fees asked by English schools in the city were blamed for the low literacy levels among the poor of Edinburgh (O'Day 1982:252).\n\nThe\n\nThe education of the middle and upper classes\n\nThe grammar schools\n\nAs we saw in the previous chapter, by the middle of the eighteenth century the endowed grammar schools were in decline. They faced falling pupil numbers as parents, unhappy with the schools' outdated curriculum, began sending their sons to private academies which offered a wider range of subjects. The grammar schools were also often inefficient, as Nicholas Carlisle discovered when he conducted a survey of them for his 1818 book The Endowed Grammar Schools: many repeatedly failed to reply to his questions (Lawson and Silver 1973:250). Furthermore, in many of the schools 'the level of work was still elementary' (Lawson and Silver 1973:251), with children being admitted as young as six or seven.\n\nFurthermore, some of the schools were accused of maladministration. The Select Committee on the Education of the Lower Orders in the Metropolis, set up in 1816 to examine schools for the working class, also investigated the conduct of various grammar schools, including Eton, Winchester and Westminster. The Committee found flagrant abuses in the administration of many of the schools: 'endowments were often misapplied, some masters took salaries without performing any teaching at all, such teaching as there was, was often of the lowest standard' (Simon 1974:95).\n\nAs a result of the Committee's findings, a Commission of Inquiry into Charities was established in 1818. Commissioners toured the country for the next two decades, 'amassing an immense amount of information which, all in all, strongly substantiated the original findings' (Simon 1974:95).\n\nMany governing bodies, they reported, were failing to fulfil their duties.\n\nAt Great Blencowe in Cumberland, an investigation in 1821 found that the trustees had not met for thirty years and no accounts had been kept since 1797. 'The management of the property had been left to the schoolmaster - a not uncommon arrangement' (Roach 1986:42).\n\nAt Berkhamstead two clergymen - father and son -\n\nexploited between them a revenue of £3,000 a year belonging to the school; neither had done any teaching for years, indeed the son lived in Hampshire, but there was no governing body to remedy the matter (Simon 1974:95).\n\nAt PockIington, two thirds of the school's income of over £1,000 had been paid to the master who had not attended the school for a year and, because his assistant was deaf, the children had been sent to other schools (Simon 1974:96).\n\nLeicester's ancient grammar school, once attended by three hundred pupils, was found to have one boarder and three or four day boys (Simon 1974:96).\n\nSome legal action was taken as a result of these investigations, and some financial abuses were corrected. The overall effect on educational standards, however, was limited. (Lawson and Silver 1973:253).\n\nWith regard to the curriculum, most of the grammar schools were failing to respond to the changes taking place in society as a result of the Industrial Revolution, and those that did try to do so often found themselves restricted by their statutes. Faced with growing public criticism and finding it increasingly difficult to attract pupils for classical subjects, some of the old local foundations therefore began to cater for a different clientele by broadening the curriculum, usually by charging fees for the non-classical subjects.\n\nOundle Grammar School, for example, which had no pupils at all in 1791, was revived when the headmaster offered forty-five boys (including twenty-one boarders) a mixed curriculum of classical subjects, geography, surveying, merchants' accounting and drawing (O'Day 1982:201).\n\nManchester Grammar School continued to prepare some boys for university, but also offered a commercial curriculum. Most of its pupils were\n\ndrawn from the artisan and shopkeeping classes, with a smattering of boys from professional, merchant and rural middle-class homes. As a reflection of this intake, a high proportion of Manchester pupils went into industry and commerce (O'Day 1982:201-2).\n\nAt Rugby, pupil numbers rose from 66 in 1778 to 245 in 1794, when the school offered a modified classical curriculum:\n\nThe traditional diet of Latin and Greek was served, with side dishes of Biblical, Roman and English history, the study of Milton, modern geography and mathematics. As additional fare, writing, arithmetic and French were offered (O'Day 1982:203).\n\nA handful of schools were successful in getting their statutes changed to allow for the expansion of the curriculum. The 1774 Macclesfield Grammar School Act, for example, included a clause empowering the governors to appoint masters paid out of the school's revenues to teach\n\nnot only in Grammar and Classical Learning, but also writing, arithmetic, geography, navigation, mathematics, the modern languages, and other branches of literature and education (quoted in Simon 1974:103).\n\nOther schools followed this example, including Bolton (1784), Haydon Bridge (1785) and Wigan (1812).\n\nHowever, an attempt to modernise the curriculum at Leeds Grammar School was frustrated. In 1805 the governors sought to use part of the school's endowment for teaching modern subjects, including French and German. In the Court of Chancery they argued that\n\nthe Town of Leeds and its neighbourhood had of late years increased very much in trade and population ... and, therefore, the learning of French and other modern living languages was become a matter of great utility to the Merchants of Leeds (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:252).\n\nBut the Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon, accepted Dr Johnson's definition of a grammar school as one 'for teaching grammatically the learned languages' and declared the purpose of the original charity to be the 'free teaching thereof' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:252). He ruled that it was illegal for the governors of the school to spend endowment funds on teaching modern and commercial subjects and the school was forced to continue with its classical curriculum.\n\nThe Eldon judgement 'greatly strengthened the resistance of masters of schools to any attempt by the middle class to introduce curricular changes and discouraged further efforts to transform the grammar schools' (Simon 1974:107).\n\nA few more schools were allowed to amend the terms of their endowments. The Birmingham Grammar School Act of 1831, for example, empowered the governors to use what had become 'a vastly increased endowment' to build a new school, next to the grammar school, to teach modern languages, the arts and sciences.\n\nHere, as the Quarterly Journal was quick to point out, was concrete recognition of the principle that endowments originally settled to provide a grammar school could be turned to new ends (Simon 1974:108).\n\nConcerns about the traditional curriculum were reflected in the publications of the Central Society of Education. In Education Reform, published in 1837, Thomas Wyse (1791-1862) gave a vivid picture of the state of secondary education at the time:\n\nIn no country is the strife between the new and the old educations more vehement - the education which deals with mind as spirit and that which deals with it as matter. In no country are there greater anomalies - greater differences not merely in the means, but in the ends of education ... it runs through the entire system (quoted in Spens 1938:18-19).\n\nHe went on:\n\nIf we find in the country and town schools little preparation for occupations, still less for the future agriculturalist or mechanic, we find in the Grammar Schools much greater defects. The middle class in all its sections, except the more learned professions, finds no instruction which can suit its special middle class wants. They are fed with the dry husks of ancient learning when they should be taking sound and substantial food from the great treasury of modern discovery. The applications of chemical and mechanical science to everyday wants - such a study of history as will show the progress of civilisation - and such a knowledge of public economy in the large sense of the term as will guard them against the delusions of political fanatics and knaves, and lead to a due understanding of their position in society, are all subjects worth as much labour and enquiry to that great body, as a little Latin learnt in a very imperfect manner, with some scraps of Greek to boot - the usual stunted course of most of our Grammar Schools (quoted in Spens 1938:19).\n\nFaced with this sort of criticism, more schools began broadening their curriculum by charging fees for non-classical subjects. Thus in 1838 the head master of Newcastle upon Tyne Free Grammar School reported that the school was teaching, in addition to Classics,\n\nFrench, Writing, English Grammar and Composition, History and Chronology, Geography and the use of the globes, practical and mental Arithmetic, Euclid, Algebra, Trigonometry, Analytical Geometry and Mechanics, etc. (quoted in Hadow 1923:5).\n\nFrench was taught without extra charge; the fees for instruction in the other subjects were £1 a quarter.\n\nSchools which followed this pattern invariably admitted fewer 'free' or poor scholars. From information about pupils in Carlisle's The Endowed Grammar Schools (1818), and the Digest of Grammar Schools (1842), which summarised the Charity Commissioners' reports, it is clear that by charging fees the schools were excluding the very children for whom they had been established. 'The earlier broad social basis of the schools was rapidly being eroded' (Lawson and Silver 1973:253) and the grammar schools were becoming 'more completely middle-class preserves' (Lawson and Silver 1973:252).\n\nIn broadening their curriculum, but tending to introduce fees for subjects other than the classical languages, the schools were consolidating their status, achieving a certain stability and competing more favourably with the private academies. At the same time they were becoming more remote from the children of the poor (Lawson and Silver 1973:253).\n\nRoach suggests that 'very few of the grammar schools, apart from a few of the richest foundations, survived on the strength of the endowment alone' (Roach 1986:7). The reports of the Charity Commission repeatedly indicate that schools were successful when the master succeeded in attracting boarders and fee-paying day pupils. 'In other words all grammar schools were private schools as well, and those which flourished did so because they had been able to develop the private side' (Roach 1986:8).\n\nThe 1840 Grammar Schools Act (7 August) 'allowed for the modification of the purely classical curriculum in individual schools' by permitting them to introduce modern subjects. However, it laid down that such steps could only be taken on the death of the master, so few schools benefited. Most 'remained peacefully in their former state of stagnation' (Simon 1974:319).\n\nOne school that took advantage of the Act was the grammar school at Basingstoke in Hampshire, which had been 'in a decayed state' (Roach 1986:88) for some years. When the master died in 1849, a public meeting resolved that grammar school boys should be prepared not only for the learned professions, but also for trade and commerce.\n\nas regards the town of Basingstoke it would be highly beneficial to the inhabitants if the system of educn and instruction of the Youth and Boys at the Free Grammar School of the Town called the Holy Ghost Grammar School was not confined to the dead languages but extended to the other branches of literature and science in order to a more substantial fulfilment of the intentions of the Founders and the requirements of the present age (quoted in Roach 1986:88-9).\n\nSimilar initiatives were taken by the town councils at Wotton-under-Edge (1854) and Warrington (1858), by the mayor and others at Bury St Edmunds (1855), and by parents at Bury in Lancashire. 'By the 1860s the concept of local control had influential advocates. Local boards of education were recommended by both the Newcastle and Taunton Commissions' (Roach 1986:89).\n\nIn his 1854 report on education, based on the 1851 Census of Great Britain, Horace Mann dealt largely with popular education, but also provided statistics of 'collegiate and grammar schools' and of private schools.\n\nHe listed 566 'collegiate and grammar schools' supported by endowments, educating 32,221 boys and 3,391 girls. The sources of income were given for 304 of these schools with 17,725 scholars. The total income was £128,693, of which £87,631 came from permanent endowment and £28,000 from payments by scholars. Of the same group of schools 71.5 per cent taught ancient languages, 44.6 per cent modern languages and 67.6 per cent mathematics, almost all of them teaching the basic subjects and geography (Roach 1986:92).\n\nPrivate schools and academies\n\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century there were many privately-run academies. Notable examples in London included those at Hackney, Kensington, Little Tower Street, Soho and Islington.\n\nHackney Academy 'possessed large premises, including a cricket field, and offered students excursions to study natural history and the opportunity to appear in theatrical performances as well as an elite group of companions' (O'Day 1982:208-9).\n\nJames Elphinston's academy at Kensington (1764) had extensive grounds, a good library and a garden with an allotment for each pupil. A wide range of subjects was taught.\n\nLittle Tower Street Academy grew out of John Bland's tuition in commercial and vocational subjects:\n\na classical curriculum was added to please a wealthier clientele, which included one of the sons of the Duke of Montrose, but the commercial/vocational subjects remained to attract boys from humbler circumstances (O'Day 1982:209).\n\nThe Soho Academy catered for commercial and business interests but also attracted artists and actors, including Joseph Turner (1775-1851).\n\nIslington Academy advertised that:\n\nYouth are generally boarded, tenderly treated, and expeditiously instructed in the languages, writing, arithmetic, merchants' accounts, and mathematics, with dancing, drawing, music, fencing and every other accomplishment requisite to form gentleman, scholar and the man of business upon the most reasonable terms which may be known by applying as above: under one general price, the whole expenses may be included for board, education and necessaries, or otherwise a fixed price for board and education only ... (quoted in O'Day 1982:209)\n\nSome academies, including the Randall Academy in York, the Naval Academy in Chelsea, and the Military Academy of Little Chelsea, prepared boys for the military. Others, such as the City Commercial School and the Newcastle upon Tyne Mathematical School, specialised in commercial subjects (O'Day 1982:209).\n\nDissenting academies expanded rapidly in the second half of the eighteenth century. They provided a wide range of professional training and 'a good general practical education for youths entering the world of business' (O'Day 1982:214).\n\nWarrington Academy, for example, established in 1757 with the support of leading manufacturers in Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, provided a modern education for laymen as well as training for dissenting ministers. Joseph Priestley lectured there in the 1760s on the theory of language, oratory and literary criticism. He initiated a course on the history, laws and constitution of England, and encouraged his students to debate issues freely. 'This was the first regular introduction of history as an academic discipline in a higher educational institution' (Simon 1974:29). Priestley 'further revolutionised the curriculum by introducing the study of chemistry, anatomy, history, geography, languages and belles Lettres' (O'Day 1982:215).\n\nPractical and financial difficulties forced Warrington to close in 1786, but it was replaced by Manchester Academy, established in the same year, which was intended to complement the Manchester College of Arts and Science (1783) by providing full-time education for students, while the College provided part-time education for those in employment.\n\nIn the College, says Brian Simon,\n\nwe have a new specialised institution which, though shortlived, is full of significance for the future; a forerunner of the Owens College of seventy years later, which eventually evolved into Manchester University (Simon 1974:58).\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, middle-class parents dissatisfied with the grammar schools had a range of options for the education of their sons. Roach argues that the private schools of the period fall into four separate but overlapping sectors. He lists these as:\n\nthose run entirely for private profit by the masters or mistresses who owned them. These varied enormously, both in terms of the standard of education they offered and in the fees they charged;\n\nthose founded by bodies of proprietors in the 1830s and 1840s, mostly in towns where there was no grammar school or where the grammar school had ceased to meet the needs of local middle-class families;\n\nthe 'religious' schools, notably those run by the Quakers (Bootham, Ackworth and The Mount etc) and by Roman Catholic nuns; and\n\nschools which aimed to provide an appropriate education for skilled artisans, shopkeepers, clerks and small farmers. These included the schools run by some mechanics' institutes (Roach 1986:104).\n\nA good example of an early nineteenth-century private school was that in Percy Street, Newcastle, opened in 1802 by the brothers Edward and John Bruce, who were self-educated. In 1803 they published an introduction to geography and astronomy which became a very successful textbook. John Bruce was a good teacher of mathematics. Among his pupils was Robert Stephenson, who later wrote that 'it is to his tuition and methods of modelling the mind that I attribute much of my success as an engineer' (quoted in Roach 1986:122).\n\nAnother noteworthy school was Queenwood College in Hampshire, run by the Quaker George Edmondson. In addition to the usual classical and modern subjects, the school taught 'Book-keeping, Surveying, Geometry, Algebra, Mechanical Drawing, the elements of Chemistry, Botany, Geology and Mineralogy' (quoted in Roach 1986:131). Edmondson also taught older students chemistry, civil engineering and agriculture, so the school was effectively both 'an ordinary private school and a technical college for young men' (Roach 1986:131).\n\nIn January 1819 the Leicester Journal carried advertisements for three private schools.\n\nIn the Reverend Nicholson's 'old-established seminary', young gentlemen were 'expeditiously instructed in every branch of classical, polite and useful literature, as may best suit their future destination, whether the Church, Army, Navy, Commerce, or the more retired scenes of private life' (quoted in Simon 1974:112) at a cost of 30 to 35 guineas per annum, or as parlour boarders, 50 guineas.\n\nThe Classical and Commercial Academy at Billesdon, run by a dissenting minister, claimed to be\n\npatronised by gentlemen of high respectability ... Instruction is communicated on an improved system, which has been tried for years with success, which expedites the student's progress, and which embraces every kind of education usually in request. While suitable exertions are made to promote the improvement of the pupils in French, and in classical literature, those parts of learning more necessary to trade and in commercial pursuits, receive a large share of attention. Many young gentlemen have left the seminary highly accomplished in English grammar, a qualification of peculiar importance in every respectable station in life ... The situation is retired, pleasant and healthy. Terms, 21 guineas per annum (quoted in Simon 1974:113).\n\nAnd the Classical, Commercial and Mathematical Academy in Leicester advertised a 'regular course of lectures on the leading branches of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, illustrated by extensive apparatus, delivered to the pupils gratis' (quoted in Simon 1974:113).\n\nFaced with this sort of competition, says Brian Simon, 'it is not surprising that the endowed grammar school at Leicester finally expired in the 1830s' (Simon 1974:113).\n\nA private school which embodied much that Jeremy Bentham held dear was Hazelwood School in Birmingham, founded in 1819 by the brothers Matthew and Rowland Hill. The Hill brothers, believing in the value of self-education and self-government, gave the boys control over many aspects of the school, including the monitoring of discipline. In 1822, with a third brother, Arthur, the Hills published Public Education in which they set out their views on education.\n\nIndividual emulation was the main incentive; pupils were placed in sets according to their proficiency in different subjects, might study optional subjects, were actively involved in learning; there was a concrete approach to teaching, a wide curriculum, precise organisation and controlled movements about the school; an earnest approach to moral development. Above all, in contrast to the typical endowed school, here was a vitality and purposefulness which paralleled - and so prepared for - the active, bustling life of the middle-class manufacturer (Simon 1974:109).\n\nLooking back on his time as head of Hazelwood, Rowland Hill wrote that\n\nIt was the height of my ambition to establish a school for the upper and middle classes wherein the science and practice of education might be improved to such a degree as to show that it is now in its infancy (quoted in Simon 1974:109-10).\n\nHazelwood, suggests Simon, was 'the utilitarian conception of education in operation in one of the main centres of industry' (Simon 1974:110). The school had a library, printing press, extensive playgrounds and a swimming bath.\n\nGreat stress was laid on practical methods. In arithmetic boys were to work from concrete objects like marbles before they depended on words and figures. Trigonometry was to be learnt through practical surveying. In learning languages boys should learn examples before rules or general principles (Roach 1986:124-5).\n\nSchools like Hazelwood provided for the more affluent among the middle classes and 'played an important part in the early education of men who were to take the leadership in science and industry as well as in public life' (Simon 1974:111).\n\nAnother type of school which flourished in the early nineteenth century was the private boarding school. The Society of Friends (the Quakers) had opened one at Ackworth in 1777 'for the education of children of parents not in affluence'. It had gained a high reputation among the Friends: the liberal statesman John Bright (1811-1889) was educated there in the 1820s, and the school's historian records that\n\nsterling men and women emanated from the Ackworth scholars of the twenties and thirties. They were successful in business, several founding firms of world-wide repute (quoted in Simon 1974:112).\n\nThe Quakers opened three more boarding schools between 1808 and 1815. These schools\n\nshowed a noticeable tendency to break away from the trammels of the traditional curriculum. Special attention was devoted to the study of English and particularly to oral reading and composition, and the pupils were frequently required to write descriptions of excursions, lectures and other incidents of school life. Considerable attention was also given to natural history, elementary natural science, geography and manual work of various kinds (Spens 1938:20).\n\nOther religious groups, including the Presbyterians, Methodists, the Moravian community and Roman Catholics, also established boarding schools.\n\nA report on 'superior private and boarding schools' in a northern industrial city, produced by the Manchester Statistical Society in 1834, revealed that there were thirty-six boys' and seventy-eight girls' schools with a total of 2,934 pupils; just under 7 per cent of the total number of children attending school in Manchester. Most of these schools had been established since 1820 and a high proportion of the teachers were dissenters. The average boys' school provided teaching in 'reading, writing, grammar, arithmetic, geography, history, mathematics and languages, up to the age of about fifteen' (Simon 1974:113).\n\nSuch schools, successors of institutions which had developed in the eighteenth century, evolved 'a new approach to the content of education to meet the needs of the class they served' (Simon 1974:114). Some no doubt provided a good education, but they 'varied greatly in quality' (Simon 1974:112).\n\nThe private school was, of necessity, an ephemeral institution, depending for its very existence on individual initiative: for its owner-schoolmaster it was essentially a means of livelihood and not all schoolmasters were scrupulous as to the means employed in securing a profit. Further, lack of capital meant that schools were often small and ill-equipped. The Quarterly Journal sharply criticised the quality of assistant teachers in private boarding schools, many of whom were utterly incompetent and whose moral character was open to question. Undoubtedly many such schools gave a very limited education, while some were unbelievably bad (Simon 1974:114).\n\nA new type of private school - the day proprietary school - began to appear in the 1820s.\n\nThe method used was that of establishing a joint stock company; one such school, for instance, was financed by £25 shares bearing interest at 5 per cent. This implied the banding together of like-minded people, and circles connected with the Church of England as well as the nonconformist middle class were now active in the matter (Simon 1974:115).\n\nAmong the most important schools of this type were the Liverpool Institute (1825), King's College School (1829), University College School (1830), Blackheath Proprietary School (1831), the City of London School (1837) and Liverpool College (1840) (Spens 1938:24).\n\nTwo features of the Liverpool Institute schools deserve special comment. Firstly their supporters were very proud of their position about religious teaching. They had, claimed George Holt in 1857, 'given a perfect example upon a large scale of the successful education of 1,000 to 1,500 young people of both sexes upon non-sectarian principles'. Secondly, they were very early to take advantage of the new University Local Examinations which began in 1857-58 (Roach 1986:201).\n\nUniversity College School served as a model for others, particularly for schools inspired by the radical middle class.\n\nHere there was no religious teaching whatsoever, nor any flogging. Benthamite principles were also applied in the organisation of teaching, there being no rigid 'form' system but 'setting' for different subjects. Further, no subjects were compulsory, a free choice was open to the children most of whom, however, studied Latin, many German, and practically all French. English was especially emphasised and applied mathematics, chemistry, physics, botany, physical geography and social science were also taught (Simon 1974:116).\n\nThe proprietary schools 'marked not only a sharp break with the traditional educational institutions of the country, but also represented, in the minds of many, a threat to their continued existence' (Simon 1974:117). However, many of them survived for only a decade or two: the development of the railways and the changing political and social scene in the mid-1840s led the middle class to turn to the boarding schools. 'During the period 1830-40, however, the day proprietary schools fully embodied their educational aspirations' (Simon 1974:117).\n\nThe private schools varied greatly in the quality of education they offered and in their treatment of their pupils. Some were probably as bad as the fictional Dotheboys Hall portrayed in Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby (1838-9). William Shaw's Bowes Academy, for example, with up to three hundred boys, suffered an outbreak of ophthalmia in 1823 and Shaw had to pay damages to parents whose sons lost their sight (Roach 1986:150).\n\nThe public schools\n\nLawson and Silver argue that 'the demarcation line between public and grammar school in this period is uncertain' (Lawson and Silver 1973:254):\n\nThe great schools like Eton and Winchester remained an identifiable group, patronized by the aristocracy and the gentry, with Rugby and Shrewsbury acquiring something of their eminence by the early 1800s. Between these schools and the classical grammar schools the differences were ones of status and social composition. Differences of curriculum or teaching methods were insignificant (Lawson and Silver 1973:254).\n\nShrewsbury had been in decline for a century and a half, and when Samuel Butler (1774-1839) became head in 1798, it had just eighteen boys. Butler reversed the school's fortunes and by 1817 there were 130 boys, 'about a third of them free scholars on the foundation' (Lawson and Silver 1973:253).\n\nCharterhouse's fortunes also fluctuated wildly: it averaged about 80 boys before the 1780s, reached 480 in the 1820s, fell to 90 in 1833 and was back up to 173 in 1844; while numbers at Westminster had fallen over a long period and stood at 67 in 1841 (Lawson and Silver 1973:254).\n\nMill Hill School, founded by nonconformists in 1807, had a broader curriculum than the other public schools, comprising mathematics, including algebra, Euclid and trigonometry; French, taught by a Frenchman; lectures on natural and experimental philosophy; drawing, taught by 'an artist of respectability'; and history, English reading, elocution and ancient and modern geography (Spens 1938:20).\n\nThe public schools suffered periods of disorder, sometimes in response to flogging and cruelty, sometimes as a result of the influence of revolutionary France, but mostly related to their autocratic structures. There was a student rebellion at Eton in 1768 and five serious rebellions at Winchester between 1770 and 1818. In 1771, when boys at Harrow attacked the governors, destroying the carriage of one of them, it took three weeks to restore order. There were other rebellions at Eton, Harrow, Charterhouse, Merchant Taylors' and Shrewsbury, while Rugby had a 'near-rebellion' in 1833 (Lawson and Silver 1973:254-5).\n\nConcerns about the public schools began to be expressed. Like the grammar schools, they were accused of abuses (such as the diversion of endowments away from poor scholars), and of being degrading, inefficient and irrelevant. Criticism focused on 'the classical curriculum, and the immorality and brutalizing effect of the schools' (Lawson and Silver 1973:255).\n\nAs early as 1810, Sydney Smith (1771-1845), a former pupil of Winchester, argued that every boy was 'alternately tyrant and slave' and that the older boys were given 'an absurd and pernicious opinion of their own importance'. The schools were too big, supervision was lax and most pupils were given little incentive to improve themselves. 'Boys, therefore, are left to their own crude conceptions, and ill-formed propensities; and this neglect is called a spirited and manly education' (quoted in Roach 1986:235).\n\nThe public schools, however, were unwilling to adapt and modernise. In 1856 James Pillans (1778-1864), Professor of Humanity at Edinburgh University and a former private tutor at Eton, gave an account of the schools as they were in the 1820s:\n\nIn the great schools of England - Eton, Westminster, Winchester and Harrow, where the majority of English youth who receive a liberal and high professional education are brought up - the course of instruction has for ages been confined so exclusively to Greek and Latin that most of the pupils quit them not only ignorant of, but with a considerable disrelish and contempt for, every branch of literature and scientific equipment, except the dead languages. It may be said that there are in the immediate neighbourhood of the College, teachers of Mathematics, Writing, French and other accomplishments to whom parents have the option of sending their sons. But as these masters are extra-scholastic - mere appendages, not an integral part of the establishment - and as neither they nor the branches of knowledge they proffer to teach are recognised in the scheme of school business, it requires but little acquaintance with the nature of boys to be aware, that the disrespect in which teachers so situated are uniformly held extends, in young minds, to the subjects taught and is apt to create a rooted dislike to a kind of instruction which they look upon as a work of supererogation. And this, we venture to say, is all but the universal feeling at Eton (Pillans 1856:271 quoted in Spens 1938:18).\n\nBy the 1830s such criticism had become widespread. The Quarterly Journal and the Westminster Review renewed their attacks on the public schools, particularly Eton. One article commented:\n\nBefore an Eton boy is ready for the University, he may have acquired, at a place of education where there is much less effective restraint than at the University, a confirmed taste for gluttony and drunkenness, an aptitude for brutal sports, and a passion for female society of the most degrading kind ... (quoted in Simon 1974:101).\n\nAnd in 1833 the writer and politician Lytton Bulwer (1803-1873) complained that\n\nReligion is not taught - Morals are not taught - Philosophy is not taught - the light of the purer and less material sciences never breaks upon the gaze. The intellect of the men so formed is to guide our world, and that intellect is uncultured! (quoted in Roach 1986:235).\n\nBut changes began to be made, notably by Samuel Butler at Shrewsbury (1798-1836), and Thomas Arnold at Rugby (1828-1841).\n\nAt Shrewsbury, Butler attached much importance to private reading; he also introduced promotion by merit and periodical school examinations for the fifth and sixth forms, whose studies included English, geography, algebra, Euclid and English history (Spens 1938:22).\n\nArnold's aim at Rugby was 'the re-establishment of social purpose, the education of Christian gentlemen' (Williams 1961:137). On his appointment, he said his object would be 'if possible, to form Christian men, for Christian boys I can scarcely hope to make' (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:301).\n\nIt is this view that accounts for his stress on the sixth-form prefects, through whom he promoted the ideal of the Christian gentleman, and for the severity with which he treated offences such as lying. Without sound religious principles and a sense of gentlemanly conduct he considered intellectual attainment valueless (Lawson and Silver 1973:301).\n\nIn the sixth form, the classics were still the foundation of the curriculum, but French and mathematics (including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry), English, German, ancient history and modern European history were also taught (Williams 1961:137).\n\nRoach argues that Arnold\n\nwas much more of a reformer in political theory than in the practical affairs of school. Essentially what he did at Rugby was to take the traditional system, to broaden it and to refine it. He did not in essence change it (Roach 1986:246).\n\nNonetheless, the work of Arnold and other heads (Arnold's was featured in Thomas Hughes' 1857 novel Tom Brown's Schooldays) restored the prestige of the large boarding schools among the middle class, who welcomed the social and moral training which they offered. The demand for more boarding schools of the public school type coincided with the rapid increase in the wealth of the middle classes and the construction of the railways.\n\nAs a result, a considerable number of new boarding schools were established, the most famous of which were Cheltenham College (1841), Marlborough College (1843), Rossall School (1844), Radley College (1847), Wellington College (1853), Epsom College (1855), Bradfield College, (1859), Haileybury (1862), Clifton College (1862), Malvern School (1863) and Bath College (1867). These institutions, described in the Report of the Public Schools Commission (1864) as proprietary schools, were 'designed to make boarding schools accessible to those sections of the middle class who found difficulty in paying the fees of the older and more expensive Public Schools' (Spens 1938:24).\n\nTo the same end, in 1848 Canon Nathaniel Woodard (1811-1891) founded the Woodard Society to provide Anglican boarding schools of different grades for the various sections of the middle class. Lancing, opened in 1848, was for the gentry and had 'two separate class divisions, paying different fees and using separate halls' (Lawson and Silver 1973:302); ten years later Ardingly opened as a school for the lower middle class. By 1890 there were eleven Woodard schools - 'a remarkable achievement for a man who had begun with no social and academic advantages, and had in 1847 launched his first day school in the dining room of his parsonage house at New Shoreham in Sussex' (Roach 1986:167).\n\nWoodard, however, was not an innovator:\n\nMy view is not to introduce new elements either into our religious or educational departments, but rather to try our strength on the present system, which has stood the test for many generations (quoted in Lawson and Silver 1973:302)\n\nThe 'great' public schools had 'defined themselves more strictly in social terms by separating off the sons of tradesmen and the lower orders' (Lawson and Silver 1973:300), but the new public schools were a response to increasing demand and 'the fillip given to boarding education by the railways' (Lawson and Silver 1973:300). Furthermore, they were not restricted by the statutes of founders and in most cases had no endowments, so they were able to respond to popular needs and offer an education which was partly liberal but also vocational (Spens 1938:24).\n\nMarlborough opened in 1843 with two hundred boys; five years later it was second only to Eton in numbers. Wellington, created as a memorial to the duke, who died in 1852, was intended mainly for the orphans of army officers but it soon became a traditional public school. Some of the new schools (such as Cheltenham and later Malvern) 'explicitly defined their function as places of education for the sons of gentlemen' (Lawson and Silver 1973:301). Many of the newer schools quickly established academic reputations equal or even superior to those of the older schools.\n\nCheltenham College had, from its opening in 1841, a Modern (or Military and Civil) Department intended primarily to prepare boys for the entrance examinations for Woolwich and Sandhurst, for appointments in government offices, for engineering, or for commercial life. The main study was mathematics, there was some Latin but no Greek, natural science was introduced, and greater stress was laid on modern languages (Spens 1938:25). The curriculum, even for the lower forms, was surprisingly broad, and included mathematics, Latin, English, history, geography, French, German, Hindustani, physical science, drawing, fortification and surveying.\n\nA recognition of the importance of English and aesthetic subjects, especially music and art, was a feature of the curriculum at Uppingham School, which Edward Thring (1821-1887) transformed from a small grammar school into a public school 'of some eminence' (Lawson and Silver 1973:301). Thring was an old Etonian but had a low opinion of the great public schools, referring in his diary (19 November 1869) to their 'inefficiency and lying efforts and lying glory' (quoted in Roach 1986:250).\n\nUnder his leadership at Uppingham (1853-1887) classics, English composition and grammar, Scripture, history and geography were taught in the morning; in the afternoon the boys studied music and one or two optional subjects such as French, German, chemistry, carpentry, turning and drawing. Thring was one of the first heads to give music a prominent place in the curriculum. He made attendance at singing classes and music lessons compulsory and subject to the same discipline as any regular school subject. He also attached great importance to systematic physical exercises and to hobbies; the Uppingham gymnasium, opened in 1859, was the first of its kind in any English public school, as were also the workshops, laboratories, school garden, and aviary (Spens 1938:23).\n\nThring was also important for his sympathetic attitude towards children:\n\nThe pupil learning Latin and Greek was for him often 'the unintelligent dealing with the unintelligible'. He was dedicated to the study of English, opened the first public-school gymnasium and made music commonplace at the school. He believed every child could do something well. 'If a stupid lad excelled in the carpenter's shop,' said a former pupil, 'or a fool in form made good hits to leg, or took his hurdles easily, or a duffer at Greek prose bowed his violin well, we had the feeling that the Headmaster looked on him as a good fellow' (Lawson and Silver 1973:302).\n\nIn the 1850s, the public schools faced renewed pressure to modernise their curricula as a result of the introduction of new examinations. These included the London Matriculation Examination, the examinations for the Indian Civil Service (first held in 1855), the Oxford Local Examinations (from 1857), the Cambridge Local Examinations (from 1858), and the Examinations of the College of Preceptors, which was established in 1846 for the promotion of middle-class education and for the training and certification of teachers (Spens 1938:36).\n\nA number of writers urged further reform.\n\nIn a series of articles written between 1854 and 1859 (and issued in book form in 1859) the philosopher Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) attacked the existing curriculum. He argued that natural science should form the basis of formal education and strongly advocated systematic physical training (Spens 1938:39).\n\nA volume of Essays on a Liberal Education, published in 1867 under the editorship of Frederic Farrar (1831-1903), then assistant master at Harrow, also reflected the widespread dissatisfaction with the conventional curriculum. Among the contributors, Professor Henry Sidgwick and Canon JM Wilson (science master at Rugby) stressed the importance of science (Spens 1938:40).\n\nAnd in his Essays, published in the 1860s and 70s, the biologist TH (Henry) Huxley (1825-1895) advocated a curriculum consisting of natural science, the theory of morals and of political and social life, history and geography, English literature and translations of the greatest foreign writers, English composition, drawing, and either music or painting (Spens 1938:40).\n\nSome of the criticism appears to have had an effect. By the 1870s the public schools, which had long been attacked for their poor moral and religious standards, were being praised as 'the training grounds for a more moral and more serious generation of future leaders of the nation and Empire' (Roach 1986:261).\n\nThis change was due partly to the work of Thomas Arnold, who forged 'a link between religion, education and character training which had not existed before' (Roach 1986:261), and partly to the schools' stress on character training through games, which was 'very important to the development of the public school ethos' (Roach 1986:267). Organised games became part of the curriculum in the 1850s, particularly at Marlborough and Harrow, and quickly attained something of a cult status.\n\nOne aspect of this was the belief that games promoted the desirable moral qualities - co-operation and team spirit, the ability to win gracefully and to lose without complaint, the power to endure fatigue and physical pain.\n\nThe army, the Empire and public service were the great fields of action for the moral values proclaimed by the public schools and tested on their playing-fields (Roach 1986:268).\n\nMeanwhile, private education for boys at home declined during the nineteenth century, though at the end of it 18 per cent of Cambridge students were still recorded as having had their previous education by 'private tuition or home' (Lawson and Silver 1973:300).\n\nPreparatory schools\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century - between around 1830 and 1865 - a number of 'quasi-preparatory schools' were established to prepare boys for education at the great public schools, which they usually entered at about the age of thirteen. These included Charles Mayo's school at Cheam.\n\nBut the private preparatory school - the upper-class equivalent of the elementary school - really developed towards the end of the century. Cheam, for example, became explicitly a preparatory school under RS Tabor (1819-1909) who was head from 1855 to 1890 (Roach 1986:148).\n\nBlyth argues that the term 'preparatory', though never legally established, has been 'invested by tradition with a very precise and important meaning which is still current and influential' (Blyth 1965:30):\n\nit implies in name what 'junior elementary' often implied in fact, that the education of younger children is mainly to be conceived in terms of preparation for the later stages of education rather than as a stage in its own right (Blyth 1965:30).\n\nThe education of girls\n\nFor centuries, a girl's education - if she was lucky enough to have one at all - had consisted of religious instruction, reading, writing and grammar, and the occasional homecraft such as spinning. In the eighteenth century French, Italian, music and drawing were sometimes added in the few boarding schools open to girls, but the regime in these schools was often austere and in many cases the curriculum amounted to little more than 'coaching for success in the game of matrimony' (Lawson and Silver 1973:256).\n\nA few schools did attempt to do more. The Abbey House School in Reading had about sixty boarders in the 1790s. Its curriculum included 'the three Rs, English, French and Latin languages and literature, history and geography and, for some, Greek and Italian' (O'Day 1982:189). At the end of the century it moved to Chelsea where its pupils included Lady Caroline Lamb, Mary Sherwood and Jane Austen.\n\nAmong the pupils at Crofton Old Hall near Wakefield was Richmal Mangnall (1769-1820) who went on to become its headmistress around 1808. In 1798 she published (anonymously at first) Historical and Miscellaneous Questions for the use of young people. This went through many editions and became a 'great stand-by of the Victorian schoolroom' (Roach 1986:156).\n\nAmong the first girls' schools to teach science were those of Mrs Margaret Bryan, who gave lectures on astronomy and mathematics at Blackheath (1795-1806) and Hyde Park Corner (1815). In the same period, the wife of JB Florian Jolly kept a girls' boarding school in Leytonstone, where the curriculum, modelled on that of her husband's boys' academy at Bath, included arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, geography and general science (O'Day 1982:189).\n\nBut 'such examples are rare indeed' (O'Day 1982:189). Furthermore, it seems clear that 'more schooling for girls did not mean more and wider vocational opportunities for women in society' (O'Day 1982:189). Women were still restricted to a 'private, domestic vocation', and the case for a more academic education for girls was based on the argument that 'well-educated women would mean well-brought up children and contented husbands' (O'Day 1982:189).\n\nLittle had changed by the early years of the nineteenth century, as Sydney Smith noted:\n\nThe system of female education as it now stands aims only at embellishing a few years of life which are, in themselves, so full of grace and happiness that they hardly want it, and then leaves the rest a miserable prey to idle insignificance (quoted in Hadow 1923:22).\n\nMany middle- and upper-class girls were instructed by ill-trained private governesses or at the private schools for girls which were now numerous and of very variable quality. Their education was 'scanty, superficial and incoherent' (Hadow 1923:22).\n\nThere were no accepted standards to which girls might work. The teachers were untrained and, even more than in the case of men, many of them had drifted into the work with little enthusiasm because there was nothing else they could do. Since middle-class girls looked forward to no career other than that of marriage there was none of the stimulus provided in boys' schools by the pressures of the job-market and the need to earn a living (Roach 1986:151).\n\n'No doubt many girls' schools of the early Victorian period were inefficient', says Roach, but 'their pupils did learn something'. The curriculum in most of the schools included 'the English subjects, arithmetic, French, geography, history, needlework and accomplishments such as music and drawing' (Roach 1986:152). Some schools also taught science and mathematics, classics and modern languages.\n\nA school established in Edinburgh in the 1830s offered 'English and geography, writing and accounts and the languages', 'the ornamental branches - which include music, singing and drawing', and courses in chemistry, natural philosophy, botany and geology. 'This was clearly quite an ambitious plan' (Roach 1986:153).\n\nIn 1844 the Liverpool Mechanics' Institution opened a school for the daughters of tradesmen, clerks and shopkeepers. Two years later it had 291 girls in the senior school and 52 infants. In its early days it taught 'the English subjects, including geography and history, arithmetic, writing, drawing and needlework. A few girls also learned French' (Roach 1986:153).\n\nThe great weakness of many girls' schools in the early nineteenth century was that there was no systematic training for mistresses. 'They could not teach what they had not learned' (Roach 1986:158).\n\nThe girls' schools came under severe criticism, most of it justified, but there were exceptions to the general rule of mediocrity where good work was being done. ... By mid-century, however, there were many able women and some men who were determined on radical changes to increase the opportunities open to their"
