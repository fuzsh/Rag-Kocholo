        "text": "On Sept. 16, 2022, Dr. Mike Williams was formally inaugurated as the University’s sixth president in nearly a century.\n\nLearn more about President Williams\n\nMeet Dr. Williams\n\nInauguration was a historic event where our community came together to celebrate the beginning of Dr. Williams’ presidency. It was an exciting opportunity to hear from our new president and express gratitude for our rich heritage and hope for a bright future.\n\nThe inauguration was the culmination of a series of events celebrating the beginning of Dr. Williams’ tenure.\n\nSept. 15, The Legacy Relay began in Morrilton, Arkansas, at Harding’s original campus. Nearly 40 students — led by the cross-country team — ran more than 70 miles to Searcy, just as the founders passed the torch of Christian education on to the next generation. Many students also were positioned at key points along the route to cheer on their classmates.\n\nAs the last runner, freshman Abby White, crossed the finish line at the Harding College arch, the University community gathered to welcome her home. Then, as one, everyone walked the final leg of the relay across campus to Bison Park.\n\nHarding’s story has been shaped by men and women with resolute faith and unwavering tenacity who sacrificed greatly to build a school on the foundation of Jesus Christ. For the last century, each generation has been tasked with taking up the mantle and forging ahead, continuing to serve with compassion and boldness.\n\nMany Spirit-led mentors have shepherded students throughout their experiences in the Harding community. Their sacrifices have brought the University into the present. This is the time for current students, faculty and staff, alumni, and administration to decide how the legacy will continue.\n\nThe Inauguration Celebration\n\nOn Sept. 16, we began the day in prayer, led by Dr. Mike Justus, Todd Gentry and Cade Williams at a prayer breakfast in Cone Chapel. The celebration in the Benson Auditorium was livestreamed so the entire Harding community could participate in the historic occasion of inaugurating our sixth president. In his inaugural address, Dr. Williams revealed his presidential motto: “Inspired Purpose.”\n\nAfter the inauguration, a coffee blend, “Inspired Conversations,” was launched with a coffee reception in the C.L. Kay Plaza outside the Benson Auditorium. The day concluded with each academic college holding a celebration with alumni guests. The entire community continued the festivities through Family Weekend."
