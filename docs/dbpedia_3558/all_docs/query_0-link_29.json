Presented at the Western Society of Criminology.\n\nLee Gilroy, Ph.D.\n\nPsychology Program Director\n\nAssociate Professor of Psychology\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Gilroy graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor's degree in psychology from Florida Atlantic University in Davie, Florida. During this time he also collaborated with faculty at the University of Miami, conducting research into mechanisms of visual perception. He then completed his Masters and Ph.D. degrees in psychology at the Boca Raton campus of Florida Atlantic University, concentrating on experimental, cognitive, and perceptual psychology, neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Subsequently, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Here he completed additional research and training, working at the Vanderbilt Vision Research Center, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Following this, his career path led him into teaching, where he has held various appointments before settling at Lincoln Memorial University.\n\nAcademic and Research Interests\n\nDr. Gilroy's research interests concern human visual perception, with emphasis on motion perception. The human visual system is able to transform changes in patterns of light stimulating the retina into coherent perceptions of objects moving within our environment. Understanding this seemingly effortless process, which is critical for performing even the most basic of everyday tasks, provides important insights into the functioning of the visual system, and the brain in general. Hisprogram of research explores the principles under which the visual system operates to perceive motion and utilizes motion paradigms to investigate dynamical pattern formation, perception of 3D shape, cue combination, perceptual bistability, and conscious awareness. His main approach involves performing psychophysical experiments in concert with computational modeling to develop theoretical accounts of visual perception grounded in known neurophysiological mechanisms.

She received her MSW in Clinical Social Work from the University of Oklahoma and PhD in Criminal Justice and Criminology from the University of Florida. While these are diverse fields of study, they have all been useful in her criminal justice/criminology interests. The research at Purdue provided a foundation for BioSocial Criminology studies, (a current advancement in theoretical research into the reasons people commit crime). Scholars are finding that there are genes that code for behavior shaped by different types of environment. Dr. Thrush's second interest while studying for her PhD was BioSocial Criminology. As a clinical social worker in private practice, she was well prepared to work in the California prison system. She supervised social workers who went into the state prisons in order to interview mentally ill inmates. This very successful program served as a bridge between prison and parole. Dr. Thrush has two sons, one who lives on a boat near Key West Florida and the other lives in Cincinnati, Ohio with his wife and two daughters. Currently, Dr. Thrush lives with her two dogs, Max (a hairless Chinese Crested) and Sam, (a multicolor poodle).\n\nAcademic and Research Interests\n\nDr. Thrush's research interests include policing and social media, Restorative Justice, and the role of emotions in Criminal Justice and Criminology.\n\nPublications/Presentations (last 5 years)\n\nPresentations:\n\nUnderstanding anger's relationship to deviance: Three Perspectives.
