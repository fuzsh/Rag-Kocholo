Crane (R-IL), Chairman, Subcommittee on Trade of the Committee on Ways and Means, today announced that the Subcommittee is requesting written public comments for the record from all parties interested in the extension of permanent normal trade relations (NTR) to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos). BACKGROUND: At present, Laos is listed in general note 3(b) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) among those countries that are denied normal tariff treatment. As a result, Lao products are subject to the higher tariff rates in column 2 of the HTS, which has the practical effect of excluding Lao products from the U.S. market. Legislation is required to amend the HTS in order for NTR to be extended to the products of Laos. Laos is not subject to Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``Jackson-Vanik amendment'') because it did not become a Communist country until after the effective date of that law. In 1997, the United States concluded a bilateral trade agreement providing market access for U.S. goods and services in the Lao market and protection of intellectual property rights. In addition, the United States reached agreement with Laos in 1997 on a bilateral investment treaty, the first to be negotiated with a Southeast Asian country, to provide U.S. investors with the right of national treatment. In 1998, U.S. imports from Laos were valued at $21 million, while U.S. exports totaled $3.7 million. Top imports from Laos in 1998 were miscellaneous manufactured articles, while leading U.S. exports included chemicals, and machinery and transportation equipment.

Crane, Chairman Subcommittee on Trade House Committee on Ways and Means 1102 Longworth House Office Bldg. Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Crane: The American Legion opposes the granting of the Jackson-Vanik waiver to Laos. We believe that the Lao government is not doing as much as it could to seek the resolution of the POW/MIA issue. The opportunities offered from Jackson-Vanik to U.S. business should not be granted until the Lao government shows notable improvement in their assistance with U.S. accounting efforts. As with Vietnam, we believe that the United States should not let commercial interests take priority over the accounting of our missing servicemembers. The Lao will lose the incentive to increase cooperation with accounting efforts if they see that the current U.S. Administration is dedicated only in words and not in deeds. The Pathet Lao have yet to unilaterally provide credible information on American POWs last known alive in their control. Although U.S. officials, veterans and family organizations have for several years urged the Lao government to commence an oral history program in order to elicit information that would be helpful in resolving cases, questionnaires have just recently been developed and distributed. As of now there is no guarantee that any significant information will be forthcoming. Joint Task Force--Full Accounting is carrying out joint field activities in Laos in cooperation with the Lao government, although it is being done on a restricted--North to South--basis. The Lao have permitted a few exceptions to this, but for the most part hold to the restricted pattern of operation. Aside from the joint field activities, there is a paucity of unilateral cooperation on the part of the Lao government to provide information to resolve cases and repatriate remains of missing Americans. Unless and until the Lao government is held accountable by the Clinton Administration, there is no reason for Vientiane to exert any meaningful unilateral cooperation. Until this happens, we cannot support the Jackson-Vanik waiver. Sincerely, JOHN F. SOMMER, JR. Executive Director Statement of Charles Andreae III Having represented clients internationally for 10 years, I can appreciate the value of extending Normal Trade Relations in an effort to promote free trade. I have seen firsthand the positive aspects of granting Normal Trade Relations which help to achieve American interests overseas. Laos presents new opportunities for many American businesses seeking to expand their foothold in Asia. These opportunities in the Laotian market will create new jobs in the United States, foster closer diplomatic relations, and enable Laos to continue down the path of further economic liberalization. To protect its interests in peace and stability and access to markets in Asia, the U.S. must create an environment that encourages Laos to integrate into the international system as a responsible member. Given population trends in Asia, Laos is certain to have an impact on the international system and American interests in Asia. For Laos to become a full participant in the international system and uphold international rules and norms, Laotian leaders must see that doing so will best serve Laos' interests. This can be accomplished only if Americans interact with, rather than isolate, Laos. Establishing Normal Trade Relations provides the interaction necessary to bring Laos into greater conformity with international rules and norms especially now when the Laotian government continues its New Economic Mechanism. Furthermore, by granting Normal Trade Relations to Laos, the United States is showing a continued commitment to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a group which encompasses 500 million people with a combined $1 trillion dollar gross domestic product and a two way trade with the U.S. of over $250 billion. Normal Trade Relations with Laos would provide a firm foundation for a healthy and growing American economy. NTR would also help promote a stable and secure world in which political and economic freedom, human rights, and democratic institutions can flourish. These interests allow the U.S. to maintain a system of healthy, cooperative, and politically vigorous relations with allies and friendly nations and Laos is no exception to this rule. NTR for Laos will play a fundamental role in advancing these enduring American interests in Asia. Most-favored-nation treatment is the normal tariff treatment that the United States provides to all but a handful of its trading partners. It is a principle which undergirds the open international trading system that the U.S. has labored for decades to expand. NTR has been, in fact, a key ingredient of America's global strategy since World War II and the purpose of this strategy has been to build a cooperative free-trade environment within which America's businesses and economy can prosper. Statement of Hon. Mark Green, a Representative in Congress from the State of Wisconsin As the Subcommittee on Trade considers this controversial issue, I believe it is essential that the committee members be aware of a serious situation involving a constituent of mine-- Mr. Houa Ly of Appleton, Wisconsin. Nearly five months ago, Mr. Ly disappeared near the Thai- Lao border. According to eyewitnesses who were traveling with Mr. Ly, Lao government authorities are responsible for this disappearance. These eyewitnesses have shared with me the following account of Mr. Ly's disappearance: On April 19 of this year, a party of four Hmong-American men--Mr. Houa Ly, Mr. Michael Vang, Mr. Neng Lee and Mr. Hue Vang--were traveling in Thailand near the city of Chiang Khong. The group, having been advised that the nearby Thai-Lao border was open to tourists and the public, crossed the Mekong River into Laos. Once across the border, the party split into two groups. Mr. Ly and Mr. M. Vang began speaking to several men, some of whom identified themselves as authorities in the Lao government. Mr. Lee and Mr. H. Vang briefly left the area. When they returned, Mr. Ly and Mr. M. Vang were missing. After a brief search, Mr. Lee and Mr. H. Vang witnessed Mr. Ly and Mr. M. Vang being forced onto a boat by Lao men. The boat, with Mr. Ly and Mr. M. Vang aboard, sped away on the Mekong River. Mr. Ly and Mr. M. Vang have not been heard from since. On May 4, upon their return to Chiang Mai, Thailand, Mr. Lee and Mr. H. Vang reported this incident to the American Consulate. Two days later, according to Mr. Lee and Mr. H. Vang, an American official from the consulate informed them he had received reports that both men had been imprisoned and that Mr. Ly may have been killed. Subsequent independent reports have indicated that the two men are currently imprisoned by Lao government authorities. Although the Lao government continues to deny any knowledge of Mr. Ly's entry into Laos or his current whereabouts, I believe they have not been completely forthcoming with U.S. authorities charged with investigating this case. At best, the communist Lao government has been less than fully cooperative in this situation. At worst, individuals who are authorities of the Lao government are responsible for the seizure--and possibly the execution--of U.S. citizens traveling abroad. The latter would represent a grave and reprehensible act against citizens of the United States. The Lao government's actions surrounding this case must be taken into account when reviewing possible Normal Trade Relations status for the Lao People's Democratic Republic. It is my belief that this case is yet another piece of a larger body of strong evidence demonstrating that Laos is not yet ready to join the family of nations enjoying NTR status with the United States. Statement of Xiong Chuhu, Executive Director, Hmong International Human Rights Watch, Chicago, Illinois Chairman Crane and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Xiong Chuhu, Executive Director of Hmong International Human Rights Watch. Our organization represents Hmong victims of human rights abuse, so everything I have to say is on their behalf. To understand the Hmong people's problems in Laos today it is important to point out their role during the Vietnam War. Since the Hmong population was located in a very strategic place along the mountainous Laos/Vietnam border, many thousands of Hmong were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to fight against the invading North Vietnamese Army (NVA). The Hmong became known as the C.I.A.'s ``secret army'' and were formed into Special Guerilla Units, which were used to sabotage enemy supply lines along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, call in bombing strikes, and help rescue downed American pilots. This was all done at great risk to the Hmong. Towards the end of the war, the Hmong had suffered so greatly that they had to sacrifice children as young as 10 years old to become soldiers, since many of the older recruits had either been killed or wounded. The Hmong have been credited with tying up 2-3 of the NVA's best fighting divisions, which would otherwise have been used to fight against American soldiers in South Vietnam. Though the Vietnam War ended nearly 25 years ago, the genocide of the Hmong continues to this very day throughout the jungles of Phou Bia mountain and the surrounding countryside. In 1975, the newly formed Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) renamed the Hmong homeland region of Phou Bia, Muang Cha, Muang Om, and the Hmong capitol of Long Cheng (all formerly located in Xieng Khouang province), and designated this area Saysomboun Special Zone (See map--Attachment A). No foreigners or international monitors have been allowed access to this region for the past 25 years. The LPDR has used this secluded area to launch repeated military assaults against these displaced Hmong. Since 1975, over 40,000 Hmong have been killed here and another 60,000 have been displaced into the jungles of Phou Bia. The former Hmong capitol of Long Cheng has been completely wiped out and is now overgrown with dense forest. At present, there are still more than 10,000 Hmong hiding out in the Phou Bia area waiting for the Hmong Killing Fields to end (See video tape--Attachment B). In 1979, the LPDR launched heavy military attacks and used chemical weapons against the Hmong living in this area. Again, in June 1990, the LPDR launched more air attacks inside Saysomboun Special Zone. In February 1998, the LPDR began another series of artillery attacks. The war has ended but the Killing Fields of the Hmong continues to this very day. Recently, the LPDR has installed 3 new military camps at Phou Bia mountain, so the killing of the Hmong people continues on and on. The Lao military has moved in and destroyed all the Hmong rice fields and has turned them into mine fields. On May 25, 1998, an aircraft carrying 26 high ranking Vietnamese and Lao military leaders crashed in Saysomboun Special Zone. They were in the process of planning genocidal attacks against the Hmong population taking refuge in this area. Again, in July 1999, the LPDR began launching heavy military attacks to wipe out the total Hmong population taking refuge in the Phou Bia jungles of Saysomboun Special Zone by the year 2000. This ongoing genocide of the Hmong people must stop! The international community must immediately intervene to save the Hmong civilian population. Although the lowland Lao have freedom of movement within the country, this is not so for the ethnic Hmong. For example, the Hmong at La Khai camp, Xieng Khouang province, and those in Muang Cha, Muong Ong, and Muong Ao, Saysomboun Special Zone are not allowed to move outside of these areas. Whoever is caught will either be tortured, imprisoned, or killed. An example of this is Boua Vang Lee who was killed by LPDR police officers Thao Khaman and Thao Khamkeuth on October 20, 1996. After he was killed, his father, his wife, his younger brother, two of his sons, and six Hmong village chiefs sued the LPDR government asking for 9,379,600 kip (equivalent to $13,400 U.S. dollars) in compensation for funeral costs and the loss of his life. The LPDR later retaliated against his family killing his wife and crippling his little 2 year old son in January 1998, just because of the lawsuit that was filed. Because of the continuing intimidation by the LPDR government they can no longer safely follow through on the case, so have asked our organization to bring their it to the attention of the international community. We are requesting that the LPDR should pay $1 million in damages to cover the expenses of the funerals and the loss of life of Boua Van Lee and See Xiong, along with the permanent crippling of his young son and the psychological trauma that the family has been put through and continues to face to this very day. (See photos of Boua Van Lee and his wife & son--Attachment C) We are requesting that international monitors, along with Hmong International Human Rights Watch, be granted official unrestricted access to Saysomboun Special Zone so that the Hmong Killing Fields may be put to an end. There has been no durable solution to this problem for almost 25 years. Why? It is because this issue has never been properly addressed. The United States must play a critical role in pressuring the Lao government to withdraw its troops from Saysomboun Special Zone before any consideration of granting Normalized Trading status to Laos. The LPDR has gone all out to promote this year and next year as ``Visit Laos Year'' to attract many foreign tourists from different countries. It is ironic, for the past 25 years thousands of it's own Hmong citizens are still blacklisted and not allowed visas to enter the country. It is still impossible for Hmong Americans to do business in Laos because of the continuing discrimination by the Lao government. We request that this blacklist of Hmong, who have resettled in a second or third country, be made available to the U.S. Department of State and Hmong International Human Rights Watch, along with the reason why these Hmong are not allowed visas to enter the LPDR. Those who attempt to operate a business are later bamboozled out of their investments and kicked out of the country. Some good examples of this are the cases of James Xiong (Classic Travel), Lilly Thao and Dr. Sam Thao (brick factory), Doua Yang (foundry factory), Mr. Seng Moua and Mr. Doua Yang (Ban Phak Seng Souk hotel), Bee Xiong (car imports to Laos), etc. We request that these businessmen/women be brought to testify in front of the Subcommittee on Trade so that you can hear from their real life experiences. Our organization would be more than glad to contact these people to testify. The LPDR laws change from day to day on the whims of officials. Tactics such as bribery and intimidation are a very common practice. At the moment there are no such laws in the LPDR which protect foreign investments. An Arbitration Committee should be formed consisting of the U.S. and LPDR governments, Hmong International Human Rights Watch, along with foreign investors before any kind of Normalized Trading Relations are established. Any type of dispute between foreign investors and their Lao counterparts must be arbitrated under this committee. This is the only way the investment capitol of foreigners can truly be protected. In the past, the LPDR government and Lao business counterparts always used various tactics to frame foreign investors, kicking them out of the country and taking over their business assets. The Hmong are still being denied equal access to education. Hmong students do not have the opportunity to travel abroad for higher education even though many lowland Lao are allowed this luxury. Comparing the Hmong population in the U.S. to the lowland Lao population in the U.S. there is a noted higher percentage of Hmong possessing high level degrees. This achievement shows what great value the Hmong place on education and should be reflected in the number of Hmong candidates in Laos allowed to study abroad. At the present time, Hmong written language is not allowed to be taught in public schools. This should be changed so that the Hmong language can be taught at any public school. Discrimination against the Hmong goes beyond just party politics. We have documented many cases of high ranking Hmong LPDR officials who have either been imprisoned, tortured, killed, or forced to step down from their positions for no other reason than being ethnic Hmong. Boua Chong Lee, who is currently being held in a Lao prison, is a good example of this. He was the former LPDR military leader of Luang Prabang province until being forced into retirement. He stated that ``now the situation for the Hmong in Laos is much worse than it was for the Hmong during French colonial times'' [quoted just before his arrest July 1995--videotape in the possession of H.I.H.R.W.]. Boua Chong Lee was severely beaten then arrested just because he voiced his opinion about how the LPDR treats the Hmong minority. Other Hmong who are currently in jail without a trial are: Vue Mai, Yang Va, Boua Yeng Vang, Wa Kou Vang, Houa Lee, and Michael Vang. These prisoners should be immediately released before Normal Trade Relations are granted to Laos. (See photos of high level prisoners who need to be immediately released--Attachment D) The lingering problem of the remaining 30,000 Hmong refugees living in Thailand has not been effectively addressed. This is because their situation is directly related to the current political climate in Laos. The reason these 30,000 Hmong are now living at Wat Thamkrabok (15,000), Khet Noy village, Phetchaboun (6000), Tak, Chieng Rai, and other provinces in northern Thailand is because they left the UNHCR sponsored refugee camps. Why did they leave the safety of the refugee camps? They left the camps because of a legitimate fear of forced/coerced repatriation. There are also over 1100 Hmong refugees still living in Napho refugee camp. They too fear repatriation. Part of this is due to the ongoing problems Hmong are having with their land allocations at Ban Pha Thao. The UNHCR and the LPDR have also not fulfilled their promise to the Hmong returnees at Ban Na Saat repatriation site. In 1994, these refugees returned from Napho refugee camp because an irrigation project and electricity were promised to them by the UNHCR and the LPDR. They must fulfill these promises. These Hmong returnees are also discriminated against by special marks on their LPDR citizen I.D. cards, which disables them from fully integrating into Lao society. They cannot obtain government employment, nor engage in business ventures, nor continue higher education, plus they also have travel limitations. (See Hmong returnee I.D. card--Attachment E). We request that this discriminatory I.D. card be immediately abolished for the more than 27,000 repatriates before Normal Trading Relations with the LPDR is established. A new and non- discriminatory I.D. card should be issued to all Laotian citizens. Before Normal Trade Relations are granted to Laos the LPDR must withdraw all of their troops from Saysomboun Special Zone. The above refugees should be escorted and protected by the UN Army so that they can return to their homeland at Saysomboun Special Zone. They should also be helped out financially with their resettlement. The major problem, and again I have to really stress this important point, is the unresolved issue of Vue Mai's disappearance in Laos. Vue Mai was the former leader of Ban Vinai refugee camp. He agreed to support the repatriation program and return to Laos only after the UNHCR had guaranteed his and the other returnees safety. By doing this he took an immense and unselfish risk so that the UNHCR's Hmong repatriation program would run smoothly. Therefore, it is essential that the United Nations seriously follow up on the investigation of Vue Mai's case. This can be done by first making use of the confidential report Hmong International Human Rights Watch has sent to the U.N. in Geneva (received by UNHCR Oct 22, 1998), which details events leading up to the time of Vue Mai's arrest by the LPDR's secret police. We are also requesting a list from the UNHCR of all the Hmong refugees who have repatriated to Laos, so that we can check to see how they are doing. Vue Mai must be released from prison before any attempts to Normalize Trading Relations with the LPDR. The Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian refugee problems have been solved, but the issue of the Hmong refugees is still not solved and never will be until Vue Mai is released from prison. Hmong International Human Rights Watch is strongly opposed to Normalized Trading Relations or Most Favored Nation trading status with the Lao People's Democratic Republic unless all of the above conditions are met with first. Sincerely, Xiong Chuhu, Executive Director [Attachments are being retained in the Committee files.] Illumination Technologies, Inc. East Syracuse, NY 13057 September 8, 1999 Chairman Philip M. Crane Subcommittee on Trade U.S. House of Representatives 1102 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Subject: Extension of normal trade relations (NTR) to Laos Dear Chairman Crane: I am writing you to ask for your help in seeking the extension of normal trade relations (NTR) for Laos. I am a chemist and an entrepreneur. Asia is our largest foreign market accounting for a third of the company's revenues. I am also a partner in another company, in Syracuse, specializing in developing advanced illumination instrumentation for use in machine vision applications--namely, automated manufacturing processes. I also have interests in other businesses. Southeast Asia is a significant market for the products of these enterprises that employ Americans and bring wealth to the US. Laos is a part of the Southeast Asian market. I plan to invest in Laos. I strongly urge you and the members of the Subcommittee on Trade to grant Laos normal trade relations (NTR) for the following reasons: The United States and Laos have maintained uninterrupted diplomatic relations in the last four decades. Despite severe destruction to Laos resulting from heavy bombardment by the US during the war, Laos has cooperated fully with the US in finding its MIA's and a plethora of other issues. NTR will foster a closer tie between the two countries. The US has signed a favorable trade agreement with Laos that the US has been unable to obtain from any other country in Southeast Asia. Without NTR, this trade agreement has remained ineffective. Without legal protection or the protection of the US, small US investors such as myself have been unable to invest in Laos. Yet, without acceptance from Congress, Laos has extended to US companies large economic concessions--especially in natural resources exploration and development--making the US the second largest investor. NTR will open Laos for further concessions and maintain the US as both a major benefactor and beneficiary of a developed Lao economy. Though, presently undeveloped, Laos is the crossroads of a huge market: China to the North, Vietnam to the East, Cambodia to the South, and Thailand and Burma to the West. Laos is developing a free-market economy. Its border is now fully open. With half a million expatriates of Laos as US citizens, the US is presented with a unique advantage to compete by utilizing her enormous economic and political assets and the direct link of its citizens with the citizens of Laos. I have seen products in the US market that were produced in Laos, but packaged in Thailand. As such, these products have benefited Thailand, but not the people of Laos and the American consumers because the producers in Laos were paid very little and the American consumers had to pay much higher prices. With NTR, these and other products can be made in Laos and shipped directly to the US at a better price for both the people of Laos and the American consumers. Laos' strategic location as a buffer state between China and Southeast Asia dictates a geopolitical consideration. Laos presents no threat to the US. Laos is simply an unexplored asset with a substantial reserve of natural resources, but sandwiched between powerful rivaled neighbors. A well-to-do, stable and secure Laos will create and preserve stability in Indochina and the region. An economically disadvantaged Laos will be conducive to political instability and vulnerable to outside destabilizing influences--specifically from regional contending powers. NTR will extend to Laos, in the eyes of other nations, the full recognition and partnership of the Superpower (the US). Furthermore, it will provide Laos with the necessary resources to solidify her economy and strengthen her territorial integrity and sovereignty. Despite the lasting effects of war, in the last 25 years, Laos has taken steps to improve itself: Adopting a constitution written by an American law expert. Introducing democratic reforms with a parliament and universal suffrage at its core. The people of Laos now choose their representatives. Further reforms are on the way. Introducing law and order as its basic operating system. Bringing its minorities to share power in the government. Joining the international community through various organizations, including ASEAN, thus accepting the international standards and codes of conduct. Introducing a free-market economy and establishing trade links with countries around the world. Laos is integrating itself into the global economy. It has to be clear that, after 1975, as the result of the flight of its citizens to other countries, Laos was left with an enormous brain drain. Its intellectual, technical and entrepreneurial capacity was devastated. Laos lost almost its entire educated population. The leadership of Laos came out of the jungles after two decades of war with guns and bullets, but had no experience managing a modern nation or economy. Laos had to start from scratch. Despite continuing security problems, Laos has opened up its border and striven to join the rest of the world. Undeniably, Laos still has much to improve. Equally undeniable, Laos has made substantial progress in the last 25 years despite enormous hardship. As a Hmong-American having countless number of relatives in Laos, only a prosperous Laos can improve the quality of their lives. Only a peaceful Laos can prevent human rights violations. An internationally involved and open Laos will be subject to international standards and scrutiny, thus ensuring greater freedom and better treatment to its citizens. NTR for Laos will clearly and unequivocally demonstrate not only a good will and a moral imperative, but moreover, an unmistakable signal of US's willingness to assist Laos in its painful attempt to raise the living standard of the people, to participate fully in the family of nations, and to advance democracy and stability in Laos and the entire region. I have learned that Congress failed to approve NTR for Laos the last time due to questions regarding human rights violations. Certainly, there are bound to have human rights violations in any country at the level of development of Laos. These issues must be addressed by the government of Laos. The international community must hold the leaders of Laos responsible. However, the larger questions still beg for answers: How can any society at subsistence level (where self- preservation is the order of the day) avoid violence? It cannot. Violence breeds abuses and impedes democracy. How can a country confronting with the remnants of internal strife and external hostilities avoid the use of force and therefore the abuses of human rights? It cannot. Peace and security are the basis to uphold human rights. Next, how can the denial of NTR to Laos stop human rights violations? It cannot and in fact it promotes the abuses by depriving the people of Laos the means to develop and to empower themselves. By denying NTR to Laos, who are being penalized? Definitely, not the few old leaders of Laos, but the people of Laos. By keeping the people poor, uneducated and weak, the power of the few leaders is reinforced. The people of Laos ought not be held hostage because of the leaders of Laos. These leaders will soon be gone. The people of Laos will forever remain. What can NTR do for Laos? Laos has a very small economy and is considered one of the poorest countries in the world. NTR will foster substantial trade and investment by Hmong/Lao-Americans and others in Laos. By also increasing trade with the US, the people of Laos will earn the resources and capacity to develop Laos. Development is the key to the preservation of human rights and the upholding of democratic values. I was a Hmong refugee from Laos who had lost many loved ones while trying to escape to Thailand, I am therefore well qualified to speak against Laos. Yet, I believe that the people of Laos and the American people are best served by improving relations, but not the continuation of a policy of alienation and estrangement. Economic reliance on trade with the US will empower the US to deal more effectively with the government of Laos. By contributing to the development of Laos through strong trade relations and political engagement, the US and the Hmong/ Lao-Americans will be in a much stronger position to influence and shape the future of Laos. The large majority of the half million Hmong/Lao-Americans, like all Americans through history, now wish to see a better life and future for their fellow brothers and sisters in the old country. They also wish closer relations between their country, the US, and their motherland, Laos. NTR is a step in the right direction. The rate of democratic reforms in Laos rests upon the rate of its human resources and economic developments. NTR is essential in accelerating the process. I am now asking for your support and the use of the power of your office as Chairman to impress upon your fellow committee members and the members Congress to approve the extension of normal trade relations (NTR) to Laos. My profound thanks for your help. Respectfully, Teng Lee Chairman, Illumination Technologies, Inc. JBC International August 2, 1999 A.L. Singleton, Chief of Staff Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives 1102 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Dear Mr. Singleton, Pursuant to the request of the Honorable Phillip M. Crane, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade of the Committee on Ways and Means, JBC International submits comments in support of the extension of unconditional normal trade relations (NTR) to the Lao People's Democratic Republic. JBC International is a trade-consulting and lobbying firm that provides government relations services to businesses worldwide. We extend representation and advocacy services to businesses and governments throughout the world. JBC International builds industry and government coalitions to leverage trade negotiations. Most importantly, we promote the removal of trade barriers and the opening of foreign markets. Extending normal trade relations to the Lao People's Democratic Republic could only benefit the US. Laos imports approximately $3.7 million annually in chemicals, machinery and transportation equipment from the United States. The Lao PDR also has several investment opportunities in transportation, energy, contracts, private property, inheritance, state banking, accounting insurance, and labor relationships. In addition to current import and investment opportunities, the government has allowed the privatization of state owned enterprises, which may be acquired by foreign and domestic organizations. The country also holds significant deposits of natural resources. Approximately 47% of the country is forested with a variety of commercial species which may be used easily for commercial production. Gem deposits include sapphire, zircon, and amethyst. Valuable mineral deposits include gold, iron ore, tin, potash, limestone, silver, lead, zinc, copper, bauxite, coal and lignite. The Lao PDR shares boarders with Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China. Extending normal trade relations to Laos would increase US trade stability and indirectly improve opportunities for trade to neighboring countries and improving diplomatic relations in the region. Therefore, US business relations are not the only benefit of extending normal trade relations with the Lao People's Democratic Republic. We thank you for the opportunity to express our comments in support of the extension of normal trade relations to the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Extending NTR is one more important step to becoming a global free market economy. Yours Truly, James B. Clawson Chairman and CEO Lao Human Rights Council, Inc. Eau Claire, WI 54702 September 2, 1999 The Honorable Bill Archer, Chairman House Ways and Means Committee The Honorable Philip Crane, Chairman Subcommittee on Trade U.S. Senators, U.S. Senate and, Other Members of the U.S. Congress U.S. House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairmen Archer and Crane, U.S. Senators, and all Members of the U.S. Congress: On behalf of the Hmong and Lao American people and communities whom we represent in the United States, we are hereby inform, request and appeal to the U.S. Congress to reject and denounce the granting of ``Permanent Normal Trade Relations'' (NTR) and economic and foreign assistance to the Communist Lao government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) because of the following reasons: Witnesses and other people in Laos have reported that the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government killed more than 300,000 people in Laos in the past 24 years. Those witnesses and other people in Laos have continued to report that the war, killing fields, genocide, human rights violations and oppression against Hmong and Lao people are still going on in the countryside in Laos today. Witnesses in Laos reported that the Communist Vietnamese government and the Communist Lao government are conducting ``biological and chemical weapons warfare'' and an ethnic cleansing war against Hmong and Lao people in Laos today. Witnesses in Laos reported that the Communist Vietnamese government, the Russian government, and other governments have been providing and supplying biological and chemical weapons, military materials, weapons, guns and equipment to the Communist Lao government to conduct war and genocide against Hmong and Lao people in Laos. Witnesses in Laos reported that Mr. Latsami Khamphoui, Mr. Feng Sakchittaphong, Mr. Pang Thong Chokbeengboun, Mr. Wang Kou Vang, Mr. Boua Yeng Vang, Mr. Nhia Yee Yang, Mr. Youa Pao Herr, Mr. Youa Her Vue, and Mr. Xia Dang Thao are nine (9) of the 25,000 Hmong and Lao political prisoners in Laos today. Witnesses in Laos reported that the Communist Lao government is seeking foreign aid and assistance in order to finance the Communist armed forces to conduct an ethnic cleansing war against people in Laos, especially the Hmong ethnic group. Therefore, the U.S. Congress must not grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations and economic and foreign assistance to the Communist Lao government. Witnesses in Laos reported that the Communist Lao government committed ``international terrorism'' against Mr. Houa Ly and Mr. Michael Vang in April 1999. These two gentlemen are Hmong American citizens. Witnesses in Laos reported that the Communist Lao government has committed ``crimes against peace and crimes against humanity and war crimes'' in Laos. The Communist Lao government has violated the Vientiane Agreement on Laos of 1973 and international human rights law. Witnesses in Laos reported that there are about 30,000 to 70,000 Vietnamese soldiers and advisers who assist, support, and direct the Communist Lao government to conduct war against Hmong and Lao people in Laos. Nine-Point Proposal for Peace and Human Rights The U.S. Congress should consider the following nine (9)- point proposal for peace and human rights for people in Laos: 1. The U.S. Congress must not grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations nor economic and foreign assistance to the Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government because these two governments have committed ``war crimes, crimes against peace and crimes against humanity'' in Laos. 2. We appeal to the U.S. government and the United Nations to demand that the Communist Lao government, Communist Vietnamese government, Russian government and other governments must immediately and unconditionally stop the use of biological and chemical weapons warfare against Hmong and Laotian people in Laos. 3. We appeal to the U.S. government and the United Nations to investigate and stop the ethnic cleansing war, genocide, oppression and human rights violations against Hmong and Laotian people in Laos. 4. We appeal to the U.S. government and the United Nations to bring the Communist Lao government and its Communist leaders, officials, agents, supporters and conspirators and the Communist Vietnamese government and Communist Vietnamese leaders and officials to the International Military Tribunal Court (World Court) to trial for ``war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity'' against Hmong and Laotian people in Laos. 5. We appeal to the U.S. government, International Red Cross and international relief agencies and human rights organizations and international communities, and to the United Nations to send food and medical supplies, and to provide other basic human needs to those Hmong and Laotian people who escaped and have been living in the countryside because of Communist oppression, terrorism, genocide, the killing fields, ethnic cleansing war, human rights violations and biological and chemical weapons warfare committed by the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government. 6. We appeal to the U.S. government, United Nations, and international human rights organizations to demand the Communist Lao government to release Mr. Latsami Khamphoui, Feng Sakchittaphong, Wang Kou Vang, Nhia Yee Yang, Boua Yeng Vang, Youa Pao Herr, Youa Her Vue, Xia Dang Thao, Pang Thong Chokbengboun, and many other thousands of Hmong and Laotian political prisoners in Laos. 7. We appeal to the U.S. government to bring true peace, democracy, freedom, human rights and national reconciliation to people in Laos. 8. We appeal to the U.S. government, Royal Thai government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to stop the repatriation of Hmong and Laotian refugees in the Napho Camp, Thailand, and other displaced locations inside Thailand to return to Communist Laos because the Communist Lao government has committed genocide, oppression and human rights violations against Mr. Vue Mai, Chong Moua Thao, Yong Vang Lor, Nhia Yee Yang, and many hundreds of other returnees in Laos. We appeal to the U.S. government, Royal Thai government, and the UNHCR to provide more food, medical supplies, and other basic human needs to Hmong and Laotian refugees in the Napho Camp, Thailand. We appeal to the U.S. government, UNHCR, international organizations, and the Communist Lao government to provide more food, medical supplies and other basic human needs and land for returnees in Laos. 9. We appeal to the U.S. government to continue opening the door of opportunity for Hmong and Laotian refugees in the Napho Refugee Camp, Thailand, to resettle in the United States because of political reasons, family reunification, and genocide in Laos. Between June and July 1999, the delegation of the Lao Human Rights Council, Inc., in the United States went to the border between Thailand and Laos. People, witnesses and returnees from Laos met with us. They reported and certified that the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government have conducted war and genocide against Hmong and Lao people because of the legacy of Hmong-American relations, cooperation, and connection during the Cold War. Witnesses in Laos reported that the Communist Lao government has imprisoned Mr. Xia Dang Thao, Nhia Yee Yang and more than 300 Hmong returnees in Laos. Witnesses said the Communist Lao authorities arrested and tortured and killed Mr. Vue Mai, a leader of Hmong returnees in Laos. Those witnesses reported that officials of the Communist Lao government, U.S. Embassy, and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Laos did not report the true situation in Laos to the U.S. Congress and the rest of the world. People in Laos appealed to the Lao Human Rights Council, Inc., to report to the U.S. Congress and the rest of the world that the Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government cooperate together to exterminate and kill Hmong people. They said the war, genocide, killing fields, and human rights violations against people in Laos, especially the Hmong people, are going on in the countryside. This is the true situation in Laos. Thank you so much for your consideration of the above proposals for true peace, human rights, justice and liberty and democracy. Respectfully, Dr. Vang Pobzeb Executive Director Enclosure Appendix I Reasons and Request for Justice and to Stop Genocide, Human Rights Violations and War in Laos Lao Democratic Movement and Freedom Fighters in Laos March 1, 1999 The U.S. Government The United Nations Dear U.S. Government and the United Nations: I am former Captain Nhia Herr Vang. I am 62 years old. From 1961 to 1975, I served in the Special Forces (SGU), under Regiment 25, Battalion 225, Company 2252, Second Military Region, under General Vang Pao and the American CIA in Laos during the Vietnam War. As I am aware, between 1958 and 1960, American CIA advisors and officials contacted and requested General Vang Pao to recruit and lead Hmong and Lao people to cooperate with the U.S. government to stop the aggression and expansion of Communism throughout Southeast Asia. Therefore, we cooperated with the U.S. government. In 1973, the Paris Peace Agreements on Indochina and the Vientiane Peace Agreement on Laos required that all foreign soldiers and advisors withdraw completely from Laos. These agreements state that the political and military problems in Laos have to be solved by Lao people. The U.S. government complied with these agreements. The U.S. government completely withdrew all its advisors and soldiers from Laos. However, to the contrary, the Communist Vietnamese government did not comply with these two agreements. In May 1975, the Communist Vietnamese soldiers and the Communist Pathet Lao soldiers cooperatively took over the Kingdom of Laos with armed forces and aggression. After the Communist Vietnamese government and Communist Lao Movement took over Laos, they exterminated, oppressed, suppressed, killed and imprisoned many thousands of SGU soldiers and officials of the American CIA and Royal Lao government and other people in Laos. The Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government arrested, rounded up and sent many thousands of soldiers, officials and other people to death in many reeducation camps and concentration camps in Laos. In the area I occupied, in June 1975, I was arrested and forced to be reeducated in Seminar Camp where I stayed for four days. Fortunately, I escaped from the reeducation camp. Genocide, human rights violations, war and extermination by the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government against CIA soldiers, officials and other people in Laos were causal factors and reasons for people in Laos to form the Democratic Movement to fight against Communist aggression and oppression in Laos. Our struggles are self-defense for survival, freedom, democracy and human rights. In my village, the Communist Lao and Vietnamese soldiers tortured and killed two Hmong families composed of ten people. The heads of these two families and victims were CIA and SGU soldiers. Therefore, people in my village and many other locations in Laos formed the Democratic Movement to defend ourselves for survival. Between 1975 and 1976, the Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government and soldiers used biological and chemical weapons to kill many CIA and SGU soldiers, officials and other people in Laos. Many more people suffered. Many people died. Therefore, about 1,000 Hmong people surrendered to the Communist Lao government. The Communist Lao government arrested, imprisoned, tortured and killed those people. About 500 Hmong people fled Laos to Thailand and they sought resettlement in the United States. According to our statistical figure, there were 8,000 Hmong people in the village of Phou Ma Thao, Muang Mouk, Xieng Khouang Province, in 1975. In 1999, there are 1,500 people who survived and live in this village because the Communist Lao and Vietnamese soldiers killed more than 6,000 people in this one village. According to many reliable reports of many witnesses in Laos, the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government have killed about 300,000 people in Laos between 1975 and 1999. Of these victims, more than 40,000 were former CIA and SGU soldiers and officials of the CIA and Royal Lao government. The Communist Lao and Vietnamese soldiers burned and destroyed villages, houses, forests, farms and animals. They killed Hmong and Lao people and animals using biological and chemical weapons. In 1998 and 1999, there are more than five (5) Vietnamese military divisions stationed inside Laos. The Vietnamese soldiers are direct, support and assist the Communist Lao government to conduct the war, genocide and biological and chemical warfare against people in Laos. There has been neither peace nor stability inside Laos for the past 24 years, because the Communist Vietnamese government and Communist Lao government is violating the Paris Peace Agreements on Indochina and the Vientiane Peace Agreement on Laos of 1973. Because of the inhuman atrocities against our people by the Communist Lao government, I am calling upon the U.S. government and the United Nations to recognize that the Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government have violated the Charter of the United Nations and the international human rights laws and principles. Nine-Point Proposal for Peace in Laos In order to bring a true peace, justice, human rights and stability to Laos, we people in Laos propose the following nine-point proposal to the U.S. government and the United Nations to consider: 1. To request the twelve (12) signatories (nations) and the United Nations who signed and witnessed the Paris Peace Agreements on Indochina on March 2, 1973, to guarantee and bring a true peace to Laos. 2. To request the U.S. government and the United Nations to demand that the Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government must immediately stop the war, genocide and human rights violations against people in Laos. 3. To request the U.S. government and the United Nations to demand that all the Vietnamese soldiers and advisors must withdraw from Laos immediately and unconditionally. 4. To request the U.S. government and the United Nations to send international peacekeeping forces to stop the war and keep the peace and to supervise free elections in Laos. 5. To request the U.S. government and the United Nations to bring a true peace, justice and human rights to Laos. 6. To request the Royal Lao family, Dr. Khamphai Abhay, General Vang Pao, General Thonglith Chokbengboun and many other Laotian leaders to return to Laos in order to guarantee and maintain peace and stability for people in Laos. 7. To request the U.S. government and the United Nations to establish a ``safe haven zone'' and ``liberation zone'' for people, including the freedom fighters in Laos. The international communities should provide medicine, food and other basic human needs to people in these zones. 8. To request the U.S. government, the United Nations, and international human rights organizations to send investigators to investigate, monitor and stop genocide and human rights violations in Laos. 9. If all steps above fail to bring peace to Laos, the U.S. government and the United Nations must give an opportunity for CIA and SGU soldiers, officials and their family members and associates in Laos to seek political asylum and resettlement in the United States because of political reasons, genocide, human rights violations and war by the Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government in Laos. On behalf of the Lao Democratic Movement and Freedom Fighters in Laos, I appeal to and request the U.S. government and the United Nations to consider the above proposals to save the lives of people in Laos. We need the U.S. government and the United Nations to bring a true peace, justice, human rights, and stability to Laos. We hope to receive assistance and support from the U.S. government and the United Nations in the near future.

Appendix II Affidavit and Statement of Mr. Blia Yang Chang to the U.S. Government and the United Nations on the True Situation in Laos March 9, 1999 Dear Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Mr. Blia Yang Chang. I am a former political prisoner in the Sam Khe political prison in Vientiane area, Laos, from September 10, 1997 to October 1, 1998. I was a captain and soldier under the American CIA and General Vang Pao in Laos from 1961 to 1975. Many thousands of people in Laos and I were happy to serve the U.S. government during the Vietnam War. I would like to report the following on the true situation in Laos to the government of the United States; government of France, government of the United Kingdom; the United Nations and international community; and international human rights organizations as follows: War and Genocide in Laos 1. In May 1975, the U.S. government withdrew from Laos completely. The U.S. government did not inform our Hmong and Laotian soldiers about the change of its foreign policy in Laos and Southeast Asia. Many thousands of Hmong and Laotian soldiers and civilians were arrested, imprisoned, and murdered or executed by the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government and soldiers. The Communist government sent the King, Queen and many thousands of people to death in many concentration camps in Laos in the past two decades. In 1975, many thousands of people, including myself, could not escape to Thailand. We were subject to arrest, imprisonment and death by the Communist Lao soldiers and North Vietnamese soldiers. We saw the Communist soldiers kill many people in Muang Cha and many of the villages in Xieng Khouang Province, Laos. 2. As a result, I and many thousands of other people escaped to Mount Bia (Phoum Bia) in Xieng Khouang Province. I stayed in Mount Bia from 1975 to 1996. I saw the communist Lao and Communist Vietnamese soldiers massacre and kill more than 500 Hmong people in Mount Bia. The Communist soldiers used heavy guns and other weapons, and warplanes, to kill many thousands of people in many other locations. The Communist Vietnamese government and Communist Lao government used Soviet warplanes to drop many chemical weapons and bombs to kill many thousands of Hmong people in Mount Bia and many other locations in Xieng Khouang Province and many other provinces in Laos. I saw the Soviet warplanes drop many chemical weapons and bombs to kill Hmong and Laotian people in Laos. 3. The Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government and soldiers launched and have been conducting war, genocide, human rights violations, oppression, and ethnic cleansing warfare against our Hmong and Laotian people in Xieng Khouang Province and many other provinces in Laos from 1975 to the present time in 1999. In 1975, the Vietnam War was over for the U.S. government and American people, but the war is not yet over for Hmong and Laotian people. 4. The Communist Vietnamese government did not withdraw its Communist troops and soldiers from Laos. In 1999, there are still many thousands of Vietnamese soldiers, advisors and other Vietnamese people in Laos. The Vietnamese soldiers changed from military uniforms to civilian clothes and uniforms. Therefore, foreigners in Laos do not understand who are Laotians and who are Vietnamese people. The Communist Vietnamese government and Russian government have continuously supplied military materials, equipment, guns and weapons to the Communist Lao government to conduct war against people in Laos from 1975 until today. 5. Today, there is a war going ion in Mount Bia and other locations in Xieng Khouang Province and many other provinces in Laos. The Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government and soldiers continue to carry on war against Hmong and Laotian people in Laos. 6. Many thousands of former CIA soldiers and their family members and other people have continued to escape to the countryside in order to avoid the genocide, persecution and imprisonment which are being committed by the Communist Lao government. Many people have died in the countryside from hunger, disease and war. 7. The Communist Lao government has continued to issue announcements and propaganda throughout Laos that those Hmong and Laotian people who escaped to the countryside can and should come back to live peacefully with the Communist Lao government without punishment and without revenge. Therefore, in 1996, I brought a document of amnesty which the Communist Lao government issued to me and to other people. We surrendered to the Communist authorities. I came to live in peace with my family members of the village of Phoum Ghan II, Vientiane area. However, on September 10, 1997, the Communist Lao authorities arrested and imprisoned me. Mr. Ya Xiong Chang and Nhia Lue Chang were also arrested and imprisoned by the Communist Lao government. The Communist Lao government imprisoned us at the Sam Khe concentration camp, Vientiane area, Laos. I witnessed that there were more than 250 Hmong and Laotian political prisoners in the Sam Khe concentration camp and in other political prisons in the Vientiane area. There are many thousands of Hmong and Laotian political prisoners in Laos. Conditions and food in the prison are the worst. Prisoners do not get enough food to eat and do not get clean water to drink. 8. Many other people in Laos and myself estimate that the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government and soldiers have killed more than 300,000 people in Laos in the past 23 years. The war and killing fields in Laos are still going on in the countryside in Laos. 9. The true situation in Laos is that the Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government and soldiers have been cooperating together to carry on war, genocide, human rights violations, oppression and killing fields against Hmong and Laotian people in Laos. The people in Laos need peace, freedom, democracy, human rights, food, basic human needs, medicine, and economic development. The people in Laos do not need war, genocide, oppression and human rights violations. Five-Point Peace Proposal for Laos Therefore, as I am a former Hmong political prisoner in Laos and a friend of the U.S. government, I would like to propose the following five points to the U.S. government and the United Nations and international rights organizations to consider for peace for the people in Laos: 1. The people in Laos and I appeal that the U.S. government and the United Nations must demand that the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government and soldiers stop the war, genocide, human rights violations and biological and chemical weapons warfare against Hmong and Laotian people in Laos. 2. The people in Laos and I appeal to the U.S. government and the United Nations to bring a true peace, democracy, freedom and human rights to the people in Laos. 3. The people in Laos and I appeal to the U.S. government and the United Nations to pressure the Communist Vietnamese government to withdraw all its soldiers and advisors from Laos completely and unconditionally. 4. The people in Laos and I appeal to the U.S. government, the United Nations and international humanitarian agencies to bring food, basic human needs, clothes, and medicine to Hmong and Laotian people in the countryside who escaped to there in order to avoid genocide and punishment. 5. The people in Laos and I appeal to the U.S. government and the United Nations and international human rights organizations to send delegates and representatives to Laos on fact-finding missions on the problems of genocide, human rights violations, war and peace in Laos. I swear and certify that the above statements and reports are true and correct. I tell and report the true situation in Laos to the U.S. Congress, U.S. government, American people and the United Nations. Respectfully, Name: Mr. Blia Yang Chang Signature: Notice: This English version is a translation from the verbal Hmong language of Mr. Blia Yang Chang. Appendix III Hmong Refugees Request Human Rights from U.S. Government Napho Forced Repatriation Camp Nakhon Phanom Province, Thailand, No. 014 June 2, 1999 Dear President Bill Clinton, President of the United States: Dear Members of the U.S. Congress and Senators, Washington, D.C.: Dear General Vang Pao, Hmong Leader: Dear Dr. Vang Pobzeb, Lao Human Rights Council, Inc. in the United States: We, the Hmong refugees in the Napho Forced Repatriation Camp, Nakhon Phanom Province, Thailand, are writing this letter and petition to you regarding the problems of Hmong refugees in this camp. The purpose of this letter is to request true human rights and freedom. We request resettlement in the United States. Our requests, purposes and reasons are as follows: 1. On April 19-20, 1999, officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) from Laos and Thailand and the Thai government have announced in the Napho refugee camp in Thailand that there is peace in Laos and are pressuring Hmong refugees in this camp to register to return to Laos. These officials have announced that each refugee who voluntarily registers to return to Laos will receive at least $100 from the U.S. government and 2,000 baht (Thai currency) as well as other assistance and support, in order to pressure refugees to return to Laos. However, they also announced that those refugees who refuse to register for voluntary repatriation from the Napho Camp, Thailand to Laos will not receive any assistance and help from the UNHCR and other parties involved in the repatriation to Laos. The officials stated that the Napho refugee camp will be closed down in 1999 and that they will force refugees from Thailand to Laos in 1999. 2. We Hmong refugees respectfully ask the Royal Thai government and you to recognize that between May and June 1987, General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, Thai Supreme Commander of the Thai Armed Forces, contracted and used Hmong refugees in Thailand to cooperate in helping the Royal Thai government fight against the Communist Lao government during the Thai-Lao border war in the three villages and Luong Kao, border between Laos and Thailand. Major Chong Her Xiong was our military commander (company 201) who led more than 250 Hmong soldiers in cooperation with the Thai armed forces (company 6). We cooperated with the Thai government to help to defend its national security and sovereignty. The Thai government won the war because of our support and cooperation. Therefore, General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh gave videotape equipment, 30,000 baht in Thai currency, and many other awards to our Hmong soldiers. Therefore, we Hmong refugees are not willing to return to Laos, because we fear that the Communist Lao government shall imprison and kill us because of the above reasons. 3. The Communist Vietnamese government sent about 70,000 Vietnamese soldiers to cooperate with the Communist Lao government to wage war, genocide, ethnic cleansing warfare, and human rights violations against people in Laos. Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, and continuing in 1999, the Communist Vietnamese government and Communist Lao government has killed more than 300,000 people in Laos. The ``killing fields'' in Laos are still going on in 1999. The Communist Lao government has imprisoned 25,000 to 30,000 people in Laos, and continues to arrest, imprison and kill more Hmong and Lao people in 1999 without fair trials or reasons. These arrests, imprisonments and deaths are evidence that the Communist Lao government has been exterminating ethnic groups, especially Hmong people. 4. In 1993, the Communist Lao government arrested, imprisoned, tortured and killed Mr. Vue Mai, a leader of Hmong returnees in Laos. On April 6, 1999, the Communist Lao government arrested and imprisoned Mr. Vang Thai Xiong, another group leader of Hmong returnees in Laos. There are many other cases which are similar to the cases of Vue Mai and Vang Thai Xiong in Laos. We Hmong refugees in the Napho Camp, Thailand, are political refugees. We are former soldiers and family members of former soldiers and associates of the U.S. government and CIA during the Vietnam War. Therefore, we declare that we shall not return to death in Communist Laos. 5. We Hmong refugees appeal to the UNHCR, Thai government and the U.S. government to solve our problems in Thailand in accordance with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of the United Nations. Chapter 1 and Article 1 of the Convention defines who are ``refugees'' (please see the Convention of 1951). We are legal refugees and political refugees under the definition of the 1951 Convention. 6. There are 1,286 Hmong and Lao refugees in the Napho Camp, Thailand, who endorsed and agreed with this petition and letter. We appeal to Dr. Vang Pobzeb, Lao Human Rights Council, Inc., to bring our requests to the U.S. government, the UNHCR, and the Thai government for consideration of our requests for human rights. Thank you for your help and assistance.

Appendix IV Request for Human Rights and Democracy July 4, 1999 Dear President of the United States, U.S. Congress General Vang Pao Mr. Vang Pobzeb, Lao Human Rights Council, USA I am Mr. Moua Yia. I am 42 years old. I am a leader of the Democratic Movement and Freedom Fighters in Phou Bia (Mount Bia), Laos. I am hereby reporting on the true situations in Laos from 1975 to 1999 to you. The true situations in Laos for the past 24 years and also in 1999 are that the Communist Lao government and the Communist Vietnamese government have continued to commit war, genocide, human rights violations, oppression, extermination, ethnic cleansing war and biological and chemical weapons warfare against Hmong and Lao people in Laos. On October 12, 1975, the Communist Lao government arrested, tortured and killed my father, Mr. Nhia Toua Moua, a 45-year-old leader of the village. The Communist Lao government also tortured and killed four CIA soldiers, including Mr. Moua Bee, 35 years old; Mr. Boua Fue Moua, 38 years old; Mr. Moua Xiong, 33 years old; and Mr. Youa Lue Lor, 37 years old. The Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government have cooperated to kill many thousands of Lao and Hmong people in Laos because of the legacy of the Hmong-American relations during the Vietnam war. The Communist Lao government and Communist Vietnamese government killed about 350,000 people in Laos in the past 24 years. The war, genocide, human rights violations and biological and chemical weapons warfare against Hmong people are still going on in Laos in 1999. Therefore, I respectfully request the U.S. government to stop the war in Laos and to save the lives of our people, because we do not want to die by war anymore. We are former soldiers under the American CIA and General Vang Pao. Therefore, we request that the U.S. government must save our lives. We do not want to die by the Communist war. We need peace, democracy and human rights like the American people and other people in the world have. We appeal to and request the U.S. government and international human rights organizations to stop the war, genocide and human rights violations against people in Laos. Thank you so much. Respectfully requested, Signed by Mr. Moua Yia Leader of the Democratic Movement and Freedom Fighters Phou Bia (Mount Bia), Xieng Khouang Province, Laos cc: (1) The U.S. government (2) U.S. Congress (3) General Vang Pao (4) Mr. Vang Pobzeb, Lao Human Rights Council, Inc., USA Notice: The above English version is a translation from the Lao language, which was written and signed by Mr. Moua Yia on July 4, 1999.

Appendix V THE LAOTIAN PAPER February 10, 1998 Mr. Khamtai Siphandon Prime Minister Office of the Chairman Council of Ministers Vientiane, Laos To Prime Minister Siphandon From: The Laotian People This letter is sent to you to demand that you immediately order your troops to cease fire against the Lao people in the Northern, Central and Southern provinces of Laos. You cannot hide the fact that from December 1, 1997 to the present time, countless of innocent Laotian men, women, and children in those provinces have been killed by your government's 105 mm guns, chemicals, air raids, and by other military attacks. We have witnesses that on January 28-29, 1998 you ordered Russian-made B8 helicopters to drop lethal chemicals on the Lao-Hmong at Phoubia, Phaphai, Phoula, Phou La Phao, Mouang Cha, Mouang Mok, and other areas in Xiengkhouang province. These drops of red and yellow chemicals and the poisoning of specific water sources have immediately killed thousands of Lao civilians, including men, women and children. Furthermore, your troops captured large groups of women and children. All the children were killed immediately. The women were raped and killed by your soldiers who left them dead and naked. Mr. Prime Minister, you and your colleagues cannot afford to pay the price for this genocide. We were born in Laos and are Lao citizens. We claim the rights for life and to live freely in our own country. For twenty-two years, the Pathet Lao regime has conducted genocide against the Laotian people. We demand that you and your fellow leaders immediately withdraw your troops which were deployed to murder Lao civilians in the regions mentioned above. These killings must be immediately stopped. Otherwise, you and your colleagues must bear responsibility and all the consequences. Be aware, that once the truth is brought to the attention of the international community, you and your cohorts will be held responsible for this genocide by millions of Lao citizens as well as the international community. We, the survivors of your genocide have concrete evidence, and we are willing to testify before our fellow Lao citizens and the world, that you and your cohorts are conducting the most bloodthirsty murder campaign against your own citizens and the greatest violation of human rights in our history. Mr. Prime Minister, the Laotian people have suffered enough from decades of war. We want a government that respects peace, human rights and which is able to stimulate economic development for the benefit of the people. We do not deserve any more of the crazy and bloody war that you and your cohorts created. The Laotian people deserve to live in peace. You will not win and will not be able to totally wipe out the civilians whom you consider your opposition. We, the Lao citizens, give you and your colleagues our last warning to either cease fire immediately or we will have no choice but to assert our rights as citizens to condemn your administration and bring you before an international court of law. When this happens, you and your fellow leaders cannot deny responsible for what you have done to the Laotian people. This letter is executed in Laos this 10th day of February 1998 by the Laotian people, your fellow countrymen.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you, as well as the honorable Members of the Trade Subcommittee, for the special invitation extended to the Lao Veterans of America to submit comments today in the U.S. House of Representatives regarding Laos. We appreciate your role in the debate over whether or not to extend Normal Trade Relations (NTR) to the regime currently ruling Laos, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR). We believe that the freedom-loving people of Laos will benefit, one bright day in the future, from your devotion to the democratic institutions and deliberative processes that have made America a great nation and a leader in the international community. Indeed, our deepest prayers and aspirations are to help to give voice in this testimony to the vast silent majority of the population in Laos--the countless individuals living in despair, poverty, discrimination and oppression in the LPDR because of decades of misguided policies forced upon them by a militaristic regime that has bankrupt the people, like the peoples of Eastern Europe under Communism, both economically and spiritually. I. About the Lao Veterans of America The Lao Veterans of America (LVA) is a non-profit veterans organization created to educate the general public and U.S. policymakers about the historic contributions made by the Lao and Hmong veterans of the U.S. Secret Army in Laos who served with U.S. clandestine and military forces during the Vietnam War. The LVA was founded and established with visionary leadership from Colonel Wangyee Vang and a very dedicated group of individuals. It enjoys an active advisory board and the participation of many distinguished American leaders, including many Members of Congress as well as those who served in senior policymaking positions during the Vietnam War. Major General Vang Pao and General Thonglit Chokbenboun are Honorary Co- Chairmen of the LVA. The Lao Veterans of America has chapters throughout the United States and represents over 60, 000 Laotian-Americans and their families. It has been recognized repeatedly by the U.S. Congress, Administration officials and the news media for its outstanding contributions to U.S. national security interests during the Vietnam War as well as its ongoing positive work in Washington, D.C., Southeast Asia and communities throughout the United States. For nearly a decade, the Lao Veterans of America, working in cooperation with other like-minded organizations that share similar goals, has played a significant role in helping to shape U.S. policy toward Southeast Asia as well as domestic policy toward the Lao-America and Hmong-American community. The LVA has had a major impact in the public arena and participated in the national dialogue regarding vital issues, including, but not limited to: 1.) organizing numerous research and U.S. Congressional fact-finding missions to Southeast Asia; 2.) hosting the first national recognition ceremonies for the Hmong veterans and their families, including the awarding of Congressional citations and the establishment of a memorial in Arlington National Ceremony; 3.) opposing the forced repatriation of Laotian refugees in Southeast Asia and bringing thousands of additional veterans and their families to the United States; 4.) encouraging Congress to successfully introduce and develop support for legislation granting citizenship to Hmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. Secret Army; 5.) urging Congress to introduce legislation that helped to successfully restore SSI to the Hmong and Lao veterans and their communities; and, 6.) playing a leadership role in the effort to urge Congress to reject the granting of MFN and NTR trade status to the LPDR regime by working to educate Members of Congress about the current situation in Laos and requesting that they continue to reject the granting of normal trade status to the regime in Laos until it undertakes basic economic and political reforms. In July and August of this year, the Lao Veterans of America conducted two major research missions to Southeast Asia in cooperation with Members of Congress, Southeast Asian government officials as well as various non-governmental organizations. Some of the research mission findings are contained in this testimony. II. The LPDR's Failed Efforts To Gain Special Trading Status in Recent Years Mr. Chairman, in 1997, the LPDR aggressively sought for the first time--in a bold step, unprecedented since the collapse of Laos to the communists in 1975--what was then called Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status from the U.S. Congress. Hitherto, granting MFN or NTR trade status to the LPDR regime had not been considered by Congress given the regime's horrific record on numerous issues. It is important to note that by 1997, the Lao communists were in a desperate situation and fearful that--like their former Warsaw Pact allies in Eastern Europe--events would spin out of control and they would lose their domestic grip on power to the forces of freedom, reform and market economics. In the face of deplorable, and steadily worsening economic conditions in the LPDR, the regime went abroad begging for financial aid, first from its former Cold War allies, including remarkably Cuba (whom, astonishingly, the LPDR actually asked for economic assistance from its nearly bankrupt ally--predictably, without result), and then, in desperation, from the United States. Sadly, Laos under the communists had become an economic basket case broken from decades of corruption and mismanagement in a Soviet-style command economy as well as the political and economic collapse of it largest foreign aid patron, the former Soviet Union. The U.S. Department of State, instead of pressing for systemic political and economic reform in Laos when significant potential leverage existed at the end of the Cold War and the difficult years for the regime that followed, apparently simply urged the LPDR to increase its efforts, in cooperation with the State Department, to obtain MFN trade status from the U.S. Congress. Moreover, the State Department worked to provide other forms of U.S. assistance to the Lao communists. Astonishingly, no significant conditions to encourage political and economic reform were placed on the LPDR regime by the U.S. Department of State in return for these generous concessions and Administration efforts to help obtain MFN trade status from Congress. Instead the State Department seemed to turn a blind eye to the regime's excesses and aggressively defended the LPDR and its policies from its critics in the United States and abroad. Hiring for the first time an American lobbyist, the LPDR vigorously pursued its effort to obtain MFN trade status on Capitol Hill with a number of its allies in the business as well as the Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) community in Washington, D.C. White-washing the horrific ongoing nature of the LPDR and its behavior, they seemed overly eager to curry favor, with elements of the ruling elite in the Lao regime. The LPDR regime and its allies in Washington, D.C., as well as some elements within the State Department, also vigorously worked to attempt to discredit and smear the work of organizations, activists, journalists and ordinary public- spirited individuals in America and abroad concerned about the plight and ongoing suffering of the Lao people; some of those targeted included people who had lost family or loved ones in Laos because of the regime's brutality. These efforts on the part of the LPDR failed miserably and, in fact, backfired on the regime's plans to obtain MFN trade status. The apparent worst enemy of the Lao government, in terms of its efforts to obtain MFN trade status for the first time seemed to be the Lao government itself. It continued to engage in reckless and unbridled behavior with regard to international norms and the mistreatment of its own people. For example, it was even so imprudent at the time as to crackdown publicly on religious practice, arresting and imprisoning dozens of Christians in Laos, including American missionaries. Moreover, the LPDR regime strangely sought to justify its inexcusable actions with a bizarrely worded press release posted on its Embassy's internet site in Washington, D.C.; this after over fifty Members of Congress signed a letter in protest to the religious crackdown against the Christians in Laos. Mr. Chairman, tens of thousands of Lao and Hmong-Americans across the United States and internationally rallied against the LPDR regime and its efforts to obtain MFN trade status in the 105th Congress. News reports filled the American press as well as the international media about opposition to the LPDR's trade efforts by the Hmong and Lao people. The Lao Veterans of America was pleased to help in this regard as well as to urge Members of Congress to review the situation more closely and to organize, for the first time, an actual hearing exclusively on the situation in Laos from the perspective of the victims. It is to the credit of many in the U.S. Congress that sound reason, the light of factual information, and the enduring values that have made America the great nation that it is, were finally able to prevail and pierce the dark deception of the LPDR's propaganda and disinformation effort in Washington, D.C. In July 1997, on the same day that the MFN legislation for Laos was voted on by the Trade Subcommittee, the first hearing since the Vietnam War was held in Congress regarding the situation in Laos. The Congressional Human Rights Caucus in cooperation with the House International Relations Committee, under the combined leadership of Chairman Ben Gilman, Congressman Tom Lantos, Congressman John Porter, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, Subcommittee Chairman Chris Smith, Congressman Bruce Vento and Congressman George Radanovich organized and hosted this important hearing. Lao and Hmong victims and survivors of the LPDR's brutality and atrocities testified about their experiences before the Congress. Also providing testimony were noted experts on the current situation in Laos such as T. Kumar from Amnesty International and Colonel Wangyee Vang, National President of the Lao Veterans of America. III. Opposition by the Lao Veterans of America and the Vast Majority of Lao and Hmong-Americans to the Granting of NTR Trade Status to the Lao Regime Mr. Chairman, undoubtedly in our view, and in the sentiments firmly held by the vast majority of Lao and Hmong- Americans, it would be premature and unconscionable for the U.S. Congress to provide the LPDR regime in Laos with Normal Trade Relations (NTR) at this time. Although highly coveted by the Lao Peoples Revolutionary Party (LPRP)--particularly its coercive state organs of control, including its military and security forces, whose morbid Stalinist institutions would be transfused with fresh supplies of foreign investment capital-- such a move by Congress to grant NTR status to Laos would clearly not be in the interest of either the people of Laos or the United States in the current dispensation. We base our staunch opposition to granting NTR to the Lao government on the significant body of information regarding the ongoing rogue conduct of the LPDR regime, which includes, but is not limited to, the following points listed below. IV. Overview of the Regime in Laos--The Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (LPDR)--A Threat to Civil Society in Communities in South East Asia, the United States and the Internationally. The Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (LPDR) is a one-party communist state ruled by the Lao Peoples Revolutionary Party (LPRP). The LPRP exercises absolute control over the State and its institutions. It is intolerant of political diversity and the existence of political and religious groups or organizations with differing viewpoints. The communist party enjoys a monopoly on power at all levels of society in Laos. All other political parties outlawed. Military and security forces consume a disproportionately large amount of the State's annual budget and are tasked with crushing all forms of free thought that might emerge to challenge the policies or power of the State or its leadership--including political, religious, social and economic thought. The LPDR retains close working relationships on security and other maters with rogue, or Stalinist regimes in North Korea and Cuba. For example, in 1995, the government of Laos took a delivery of 20 busts of its communist Party founder, Kaysone Phomvihane from North Korea-- whose sculptors produced similar busts of the former Korean Dictator Kim IL-Sung. Currently, these busts are being placed in newly constructed memorial squares in all of the provincial capitals of Laos as well as other LPDR designated locations throughout the country. It is, therefore, no surprise that the LPDR remains one of the most corrupt, repressive and backward nations in Southeast Asia and, indeed, the world. In the last decade, the LPDR and its leadership have become more obsessed with absolute control of the State, and have heighten coercive efforts against political, ethnic and religious dissidents and opposition groups in Laos, especially after the Berlin Wall was brought down and the economic and political collapse of its chief patron--the former Soviet Union. LPDR military and security forces engage in ethnic and political cleansing of dissident and minority elements who challenge the LPRP's policies or leadership. Dissidents or members of suspect ethnic minorities are often jailed or executed extrajudicially--many simply disappear. Independent human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Asia Watch are barred from Laos by the government. Foreign journalists are assigned ``minders'' by the LPDR security services to monitor their movements and activities. Frequent reports by Lao and Hmong families living in the United States or abroad regarding allegations of the persecution or killings of their relatives still residing in Laos by the regime are sometimes difficult to confirm independently because of these restrictions and the often secretive nature of the LPDR regime. V. Ongoing Ethnic Cleansing Operations by the LPDR Regime Against the Hmong and Other Minority Groups in Laos. There are numerous and ongoing large-scale and small-unit ethnic cleansing operations being conducted by the LPDR military and security forces against Hmong, Khmu, Mien and other minority enclaves in Laos. Accurate numbers as to the casualties killed and wounded in Laos by the government remain elusive due to the closed nature of the LPDR regime as well as the remoteness of the regions and the primitive conditions that exist in many parts of Laos. In the 1990s, however, conservative estimates place the number of minority people killed annually in Laos by the government in these operations at several thousand. Numbers were far higher on an annual basis in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s following the collapse of the Royal Lao government and the takeover by the communists in 1975. In the 1980s, large-scale operations by Vietnamese military forces in Laos, in coordination with LPDR security forces, probably accounted for the deaths of tens of thousands of Hmong and other minority peoples on an annual basis. Moreover, tens of thousands of Hmong and Lao people also fled the country as refugees across the Mekong River to Thailand during these years. Mr. Chairman, currently military operations are being conducted by the LPDR in northern Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, against some 8,000 Hmong people that are largely surrounded in two major defensive pockets. International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman raised serious concerns about this issue with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of Thailand in August of this year after his staff conducted research interviews with Hmong leaders and representatives from this area. Thai officials and key leaders in the United States Congress remain concerned about the possible need to provide humanitarian assistance for a potential refugee influx that the ongoing LPDR ethnic cleansing operations might generate. In Southern Xieng Khouang Province (including what the LPDR established as the ``Xiasomboun Special Zone''), Bolikhamsai Province and Khammuan Province, Laos, some 1500 Hmong are being hunted by special LPDR ethnic cleansing units tasked with exterminating them. In the Southern panhandle of Laos, hundreds of Khmu people who oppose the LPDR's policies are subjected to military attacks by the regime that have claimed the lives of hundreds of people over the last several years. Many have begun to take up arms against the government or flee to the jungle in self- defense. Mr. Chairman, currently, in 1999, it is estimated that at least 12,000 minority people are currently in imminent danger of extermination in Laos by LPDR ethnic cleansing units. The Hmong people continue to be singled out for attack by the LPDR which still often mistrusts them, given their role in support of anti-communist efforts with U.S. clandestine and military forces during the Vietnam War. The main targets of ethnic cleansing by the LPDR regime are almost exclusively civilians living in villages in various remote areas of Laos--where people wish to live in freedom, and resistance and opposition forces continue to seek safe-haven from the regime. Current, LPDR tactics do not seek to discriminate between civilian and resistance targets. Suspect or unspecified ethnic minority groups in their traditional rural or mountain homelands are attacked by military and security forces with the apparent intent to kill all of the inhabitants. Entire villages are attacked indiscriminately with seemingly no regard for civilian lives--especially those of women and children who, if they survive the initial attack, are often raped, mutilated or summarily executed. For such operations, the LPDR routinely deploys for airborne support its older, but still quite lethal, Soviet-built MI-6 and MI-8 ``HIP-E'' attack helicopters--in tactical combat formations of four to six helicopters-- sometimes equipped with 57 mm rocket pods, machine guns and cluster munitions. It is also worthy to note that the LPDR is deploying, in larger numbers, ethnic battalions of communist or conscripted Hmong and other minorities against people of their own ethnicity in an effort to obtain better intelligence as well as divide and conquer these groups. Currently, one battalion each of communist or conscripted Hmong are reportedly deployed in Xieng Khouang and Khammuan provinces respectively to assist LPDR ethnic cleansing units with their operations. LPDR troops often suffer from severe discipline problems and low morale due to conscription and lack of pay for months on end. These problems have been exacerbated in recent years with the economic crisis in Laos. Consequently, LPDR troops are frequently known to loot, plunder and rape in many of the areas where they operate. The military and security forces are thus viewed with ever increasing suspicion, contempt and hostility by many Lao people. Underground political and armed opposition groups continue to develop and grow in such an environment. Astonishingly, the LPDR regime apparently continues to aggressively desire military support and senior-level advice from Vietnam for its military operations against the Hmong people in Xieng Khouang Province. On May 31, 1998, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported that the Voice of Vietnam in Hanoi had announced the crash in Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, of a very senior delegation of Vietnamese military officials, on "
