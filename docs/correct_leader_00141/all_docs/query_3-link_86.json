        "text": "Editable Lesson Plans\n\nEvery teacher needs a carefully drawn lesson plan, irrespective of the training, experience or competency. A lesson plan is required to assist the students in achieving the learning objectives, on the short term and long term as well. Having a lesson is exactly like having a complete and clear picture of how a learning process is going to take place and how students are able to grasp and retain what is being taught to them ...\n\nWork Sheets\n\nWorksheets offer a unique learning avenue to kids. They are not only fun to do but even facilitate ease of learning and knowledge retention in young minds. As an assessment tool, worksheets can be used by teachers to understand students' previous knowledge, the outcome of learning, and the process of learning; at the same time, they can be used to enable students to monitor the progress of their own learning ...\n\nExam Past Papers\n\nStudying past papers are a valuable part of exam preparation and help keep revision focused on important themes whilst practicing exam style questions. Past exam papers are one of the most helpful tools available to prepare for both internal and external examinations as they provide students with practical insight into how the forthcoming exam paper is likely to look and the key themes or subject areas most likely to be covered. Before starting revision for a subject it is always worth taking time to seek out past papers ...\n\nEducational Public Service Documents\n\nPublic service is a service intended to serve all members of a community. It is usually provided by the government to people living within its jurisdiction, either directly or by financing provision of services. The following are Forms that are used for data records for public service staff in the ministry of education. Public Service is noble! ...\n\nLesson Schemes\n\nA syllabus is derived from the curriculum. It is about that list of topics to be taught and learned for a specific period, or programme, while the scheme of work is drawn from the syllabus and broken into pieces to be taken on a termly basis. The lesson plan is a further breaking down of work to be done. The scheme of work also guides supervisors of schools in determining the efforts of the schools and teachers towards meeting the societal demands on them. The scheme of work is aimed at serving the following purposes: A Guide to the teacherFor organisational conveniencekeeping records of what is taught and what ought to be taught (Okai, 2010). The scheme of work is broken into unit plans per month or per week. A unit plan breaks down further the scheme of work into smaller portions that can be treated within a period of a week. The unit plan can, therefore, be described as the organised sequence of content and learning experience derived for an analysis of the scheme of work designed to be covered by the class within a period of week (Okai, 2010) ...\n\nSyllabi /Curriculum\n\nA Syllabi is a document that communicates information about a specific course or subject and defines expectations and responsibilities for the leaner and a teacher. A curriculum is broadly defined as the totality of student experiences that occur in the educational process. The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student’s experiences in terms of the educator’s or school’s instructional goals ...\n\nEducational Books\n\nFor students, it is worth saying that: “A room without books is like a body without a soul.” A good book is like a good friend; the more you read it, the more interesting it will be. They have always benefit to the reader. The benefits of reading books range from improving mental health to improving physical health, to creating healthy habits, and it’s no wonder that books and reading are so high up on the list of personal entertainment. Though books have been around for an incredibly long time, they have not lost their importance throughout the years ..."
