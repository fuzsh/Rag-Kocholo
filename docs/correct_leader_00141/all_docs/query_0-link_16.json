Purposes\n\nThe Law on Enterprises determines the principles, procedures and measures for the incorporation, operation and management of enterprises in the Lao People's Democratic Republic with the aims of promoting production, business and services in all economic sectors to develop the workforce [engaged in] production and production relationships1, and [or promoting] national socio- economic growth to contribute to national development and improvement of the livelihood of the multi-ethnic people.\n\nArticle 2. Definitions\n\nTerms used in this Law on Enterprises shall have the meanings ascribed below:\n\nâ¢ An enterprise [refers to] a business organisation of individuals or legal entities which shall have a name, capital, an administration and management, and an office, and which is registered as an enterprise under this law. An enterprise is also referred to as a âbusiness unitâ;\n\nâ¢ A business [refers to] a business activity in any specific undertaking, either as part of or as the whole of the process from production to services, for the purpose of seeking profit and serving the societyâs common interests;\n\n1 This is a literal translation of the Lao term, which has the connotation of opening up the possibilities for different relationships in the ownership of means of production.\n\n1\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nâ¢ The list of controlled businesses2 [refers to] the list of business types that are highly sensitive to national stability, social order, and fine national traditions and to the environment, which require the permission of, and inspection3 by, the relevant authorities prior to the registration of the enterprise;\n\nâ¢ A sole-trader enterprise4 [refers to] a form of enterprise owned by an individual. A sole-trader enterprise operates under the name of its owner who holds unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise;\n\nâ¢ A partnership enterprise [refers to] a form of enterprise5 established on the basis of a contract between at least two investors who contribute capital to joint business operations for the purpose of sharing profits;\n\nâ¢ A general partnership enterprise [refers to] a form of partnership enterprise which is jointly operated by the partners primarily based on mutual trust and where all partners have joint and unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise;\n\nâ¢ A limited partnership enterprise [refers to] a form of partnership enterprise in which some6 of the partners have unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise and are referred to as âgeneral partnersâ, and the other partners have limited liability and are referred to as âlimited partnersâ;\n\nâ¢ A company [refers to] a form of enterprise established through the division of its capital into shares, each share having equal value. A shareholder is only liable for the companyâs debts up to an amount not exceeding the unpaid portion of [such shareholderâs] shares;\n\nâ¢ A limited company [refers to] a form of company with at least two and no more than thirty shareholders, except in the cases described in paragraph one, Article 85 of this law, and a limited company with a single shareholder is called a âone-person limited companyâ7;\n\nâ¢ A public company [refers to] a form of company with at least nine shareholders who are the promoters, and the companyâs shares can be freely transferred and openly offered to the public;\n\n2 This term is sometimes also referred to as the ânegative listâ.\n\n3 In the Lao language, the same word is used to represent all of the following related (but slightly different) concepts: âcontrolâ, âinspectionâ, âsupervisionâ, âauditâ and âmonitoringâ. The translators have chosen âinspectionâ (and its variants) as the most appropriate English equivalent but readers should note and bear in mind the other meanings that might have been intended.\n\n4 This term is sometimes also translated as âsole-proprietorship enterpriseâ.\n\n5 In the old Business Law, this form of enterprise was called a partnership company. In this law, the term has been changed to âpartnership enterpriseâ.\n\n6 There must be more than one general partner in this type of enterprise.\n\n7 This term is sometimes also translated as âsole limited companyâ.\n\n2\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nâ¢ A public offering of shares [refers to] an offering of shares to the public in the stock exchange market or outside the stock exchange as described in laws and regulations;\n\nâ¢ A State company8 [refers to a company] established by the State and managed under rules applicable to companies and it shall not sell more than forty-nine percent of its shares9;\n\nâ¢ A joint company [refers to] a company jointly established between the State and another sector10[,] whether domestic or foreign[,] in which each party holds fifty percent of the shares;\n\nâ¢ Shares represent the capital of a partnership enterprise or company and may be divided into unequal or equal value depending on the form of partnership or company as stipulated in this law;\n\nâ¢ An ordinary share [refers to] a type of share which the owner cannot redeem;\n\nâ¢ A preferred share [refers to] a type of share which the owner may redeem, and which has specific rights and obligations that are different from ordinary shares;\n\nâ¢ A share certificate [refers to] an important legal document of title representing the rights and the proportion of ownership of a partner in a partnership enterprise or a shareholder in a company;\n\nâ¢ A debenture [refers to] a loan certificate issued by a company without collateral which gives the debenture holder legitimate rights that guarantee the repayment of principal and interest as agreed;\n\nâ¢ A dividend [refers to] the money distributed to partners or shareholders from the net profit generated by a partnership enterprise or a company after deduction of the cost of capital, expenses and debts;\n\nâ¢ A quorum [refers to] the minimum number of participants in a meeting required to convene a meeting;\n\nâ¢ Commercial confidentiality [refers to] important information about the production process, business or services of an enterprise that may result in loss to the stability and financial status of that enterprise if they are disclosed;\n\nâ¢ A liquidator [refers to] a person appointed by the court or an enterprise to perform rights and duties in the attachment of the assets of a dissolved or bankrupt enterprise in order to pay the creditors and distribute the remaining amount to the owners11, partners or shareholders of the concerned enterprise.\n\n8 This entity is different from a State-owned enterprise in the old Business Law.\n\n9 The literal translation of this phrase is âmay sell shares up to less than 50%â.\n\n10 The literal translation on this phrase is âwith a party from the non-governmental sectorâ.\n\n11 This term is not limited to investors but rather could include, e.g., the owner of a sole-trader enterprise.\n\n3\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 3. Right to Establish Enterprise\n\nLao citizens, foreign residents, apatrids12 residing in the Lao PDR and foreigners, including their organisations, are entitled to establish enterprises or participate in business transactions in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Lao PDR.\n\nArticle 4. Equality in Business Transactions\n\nAll economic sectors, domestic and foreign, are equal before the law in business activities, and may compete and cooperate in expanding production forces, [and in] extending their production, business and services.\n\nArticle 5. Obligations of Enterprises\n\nEnterprises have the obligation to conduct their business operations in accordance with their business purposes, to keep accounting books, to perform fiscal obligations towards the government, to protect the workersâ legitimate rights and interests, to preserve the environment, and to uphold other relevant laws and regulations of the Lao PDR.\n\nArticle 6. State Policy and Protection of Rights and Interests of Enterprises\n\nThe State encourages and promotes domestic and foreign persons and organisations to establish enterprises or to participate in business activities in all non-restricted sectors by issuing customs and tax policies, regulations, [and] measures, [and by] providing information, services and other facilities to enterprises to contribute to socio-economic development.\n\nThe legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, namely their capital and property, are protected by laws.\n\nArticle 7. International Cooperation\n\nThe State promotes international relations and cooperation in business activities by exchanging lessons and information, by mobilizing capital, sciences, technologies and experience in business management that is advanced13, [and also promotes] the opening up of the market, [and] regional and global integration.\n\n12 Readers may wish to refer to the Law on Lao Nationality for the distinction between aliens, apatrids (i.e. persons unable to certify their nationality) and foreign individuals.\n\n13 In the original Lao text, it is unclear whether this adjective qualifies business management or all other nouns preceding it.\n\n4\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 8. Scope of Application\n\nThis law applies to private enterprises, both domestic and foreign, State enterprises14 and joint enterprises established and operating in the Lao PDR.\n\nCooperative enterprises and small retail traders do not fall under the scope of application of this law and will be dealt with in detail separately.\n\nPart II Enterprises\n\nChapter 1 Types, Forms and Categories of Enterprises\n\nArticle 9. Types of Enterprises\n\nThere are four types of enterprises in the Lao PDR: private enterprises, State enterprises,15 joint enterprises and collective enterprises.\n\nA private enterprise may elect to use any form or category of enterprise stipulated in Article 10 and Article 11 of this law for the establishment and operation of its enterprise.\n\nA State enterprise and a joint enterprise may be established and operated in the form of a company only. A State enterprise is referred to as a âState companyâ and a joint enterprise as a âjoint companyâ.\n\nArticle 10. Forms of Enterprises\n\nThe form of an enterprise [refers to] the business organisation that is the basis for the establishment and business operations of all types of enterprises.\n\nEnterprises are classified in three forms:\n\n1. Sole-trader entreprise; 2. Partnership enterprise; 3. Company.\n\n14 The Lao term here is a different word from âState companyâ.\n\n15 In the original Lao text, the same words are used here for State-owned enterprises and mixed enterprises as were used in the Business Law. However, the translators have used different English words for these enterprises in this law because the nature of these entities is different.\n\n5\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 11. Categories of Partnership Enterprises and Companies\n\nPartnership enterprises and companies are classified in the following four categories:\n\n1. Partnership enterprises are classified in two categories:\n\nâ¢ General partnership enterprise; â¢ Limited partnership enterprise.\n\n2. Companies are classified in two categories:\n\nâ¢ Limited company, including one-person limited company; â¢ Public company.\n\nChapter 2 Registration of Enterprises\n\nArticle 12. Registration of Enterprises\n\nEnterprise registration [refers to] the acceptance of a notification for enterprise registration16 as lawful recognition by the State of an individual or legal entity, either domestic or foreign, that is established and is operating a business in the Lao PDR.\n\nThe procedure for enterprise registration is separately regulated.\n\nAn enterprise is registered once throughout the period of operation of such enterprise.\n\nArticle 13. Filing of Notification for Enterprise Registration\n\nAny person intending to conduct business in the Lao PDR shall file a notification for enterprise registration with the concerned State agencies as specified under this law.\n\n16 The term ânotification for enterprise registrationâ (rather than âapplication for enterprise registrationâ) is used in the Lao text and has the connotation that enterprise registration should generally be a matter of notifying the relevant authorities of, rather than seeking permission for, the establishment of a business unit.\n\n6\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 14. Procedures and Timeframe for Consideration of Enterprise Registration\n\nUpon receipt of a notification for enterprise registration, the commercial sector17 shall examine whether the type of business to be registered falls in the list of controlled or non-controlled businesses. If the proposed business is not in the controlled list, the enterprise registration authority of the commercial sector shall consider18 issuing a certificate of enterprise registration no later than ten official working days from the date of receipt of the notice.\n\nIn the event that the type of business submitted for registration falls within the list of controlled businesses, the commercial sector shall immediately forward the application to the concerned authority19. Such authority shall consider and respond no later than ten working days, except in the case of certain businesses that require a longer technical review process. Thereafter, the commercial authority shall consider issuing an enterprise registration certificate no later than three working days.\n\nIn the event that the enterprise registration certificate is not issued, a written response with reasons shall be given to the applicant for enterprise registration.\n\nThe list of controlled businesses and the timeframe for the technical review process as stipulated in paragraph two of this article shall be approved by the government only.\n\nArticle 15. Invalid Registration of Enterprises\n\nAn invalid registration of an enterprise [refers to] the registration of an enterprise where part or the whole content of [such] registration does not conform to the form, category [or]20 reality, and that needs to be corrected. Such correction may be made by amendment.\n\nIn the event that the correction cannot be made, the enterprise shall be dissolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this law.\n\n17 The term âsectorâ is used in many Lao laws to refer to the cluster of government ministries or agencies engaged in a particular activity.\n\n18 This term has the connotation of having the power to approve.\n\n19 This is a reference to the authority regulating the controlled industry.\n\n20 The Lao word âandâ is sometimes used in a disjunctive sense, often when the authors wish to emphasize the importance f all items in the disjunctive list. Here the literal translation is âandâ, but it is clear that the disjunctive âorâ meaning is intended.\n\n7\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe registration of an enterprise [granted] to a person restricted by law or the registration of an enterprise in contravention of any law or regulation shall be invalid.\n\nThe invalidity of any enterprise registration or the dissolution of the enterprise shall not terminate the liabilities of the enterprise.\n\nArticle 16. Effects of Enterprise Registration\n\nThe registration of an enterprise has the following effects:\n\n1. Creates a legal entity of a partnership enterprise or a company that is separate from its shareholders, having rights, duties and responsibilities within the scope of its purposes and bylaws21;\n\n2. Enables the enterprise to carry out business activities within the business sectors indicated in its enterprise license without requiring further approval or review from the relevant authorities, except for certain types of businesses specified in the list of controlled businesses, as provided in Article 14 of this law;\n\n3. The contents22 that were filed with the notification for enterprise registration shall be disclosed, and any interested person may see such application as described in paragraph one, Article 19 of this law;\n\n4. The enterpriseâs name and tax registration are registered.\n\nArticle 17. Effects of Failure to Conduct Business Operations\n\nAn enterprise shall commence its business operations within ninety days from the date of the enterprise registration. In the event that an enterprise fails to operate within that period or suspends its operation and fails to perform its fiscal obligations over twelve months continuously without reasons, the relevant enterprise registration officers shall notify such enterprise to clarify the reasons[.]23 If such enterprise fails to meet the registration officers within ten working days from the date the notice is received or at the meeting no sufficient reason is given, such enterprise shall be considered suspended and [shall be] dissolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in this law.\n\n21 This is a reference to the internal regulations of the company.\n\n22 This is a literal translation. The intention is to refer to âthose matters that must be includedâ. See Article 11 of the Contract Law for a similar use of âcontentsâ.\n\n23 For readability, the punctuation of this sentence has been modified.\n\n8\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 18. Modification of Contents in Enterprise Registration\n\nAny modification of the contents in the enterprise registration after registration, such as the purpose or the registered capital, shall be notified to the relevant enterprise registration officers within one month after the decision on such modifications has been made, except for the modification of contents in the enterprise registration relating to the types of business falling within the list of controlled businesses, which shall comply with paragraph two of Article 14 of this law.\n\nAny enterprise that provides invalid contents in its enterprise registration or gives notice of a modification later than the period specified in paragraph one of this article, whether intentionally or not, shall not be entitled to assert [such deficiencies] as an argument for the release from liability for its acts against third parties acting in good faith.\n\nArticle 19. Public Disclosure of Contents of Enterprise Registration\n\nIndividuals and legal entities may access or request a copy of filed registration documents from the enterprise registration officers. Such registration documents refer to documents filed by the enterprise for enterprise registration as required under this law. A person requesting a copy of such documents shall pay fees as stipulated.\n\nOther than the documents described in paragraph one of this article, disclosure shall be permitted only with the prior consent of the concerned enterprise, unless otherwise provided by the laws.\n\nArticle 20. Registered Capital of Enterprises\n\nThe registered capital of a sole-trader enterprise is the capital declared by the owner to the enterprise registration officer in its enterprise registration.\n\nThe registered capital of a partnership or company is the value of all shares as defined in item 4 of Article 33 and item 4 of Article 81 of this law. Such registered capital is also referred to as the âstated capitalâ of the partnership or the company.\n\nFor certain types of businesses, as necessary, the relevant sector has the authority to set the minimum required registered capital for enterprise registration, provided that approval from the government has been obtained.\n\nThe declared registered capital must truly exist in the Lao PDR, as prescribed by the laws. In the event of a breach, the breaching party shall be responsible under the laws for the offence of making false statements to a government authority.\n\n9\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nChapter 3 Name of Enterprise\n\nArticle 21. Selection of Name of Enterprise\n\nAn enterprise may select the name or surname of one or several persons or may use other names as agreed. Any enterprise first subscribing for a name shall have priority over other enterprises. The name of an enterprise shall at all times indicate the form or category of such enterprise.\n\nA subscribed name shall terminate if the subscribing enterprise is not accepted for enterprise registration.\n\nUpon the registration of an enterprise, the business operator shall display a sign with its name.\n\nArticle 22. Forbidden Names\n\nForbidden names are:\n\n1. Names causing confusion, [names that are] similar or identical to the names of other enterprises within the same province, [or] city[,] or names of other enterprises that are widely known;\n\n2. Names that conflict with the fine national culture and traditions or with social order;\n\n3. Names that contain the name of any country, [or] international organisation, or the name of any symbol of cultural identity or national sacred site;\n\n4. Names that are identical or similar to a form or category of enterprise.\n\nArticle 23. Allowing other Persons to Use Name or License of Enterprise\n\nAny authorisation to another person to use the name or enterprise license for business activities shall be made in writing and in accordance with the Contract Law of the Lao PDR.\n\nIn the event that there is no written authorisation for the use of a name or enterprise license but there is sufficient evidence indicating that the owner of the name or enterprise license knew but did not complain or object or supported such use, it shall be deemed as due authorisation.\n\n10\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 24. Liability for Allowing other Persons to use Name or License of Enterprise\n\nAny person who authorises others to use its name or enterprise license shall be responsible to third parties in accordance with the agreed contract24 or as provided by the laws.\n\nAny person who authorises a person having no capacity25 to use its name or enterprise license shall be liable for the act of such persons.\n\nAny person who authorises an individual or legal entity that is subject to legal restrictions to use its name or enterprise license shall be jointly liable for the acts of that individual or legal entity. Any business operations carried out by the authorised persons shall be deemed to be business operations [conducted] without an enterprise registration.\n\nA State company may not authorise any individual or legal entity to use its name or enterprise license. In the event of any violation, it shall be personally liable to the third party.\n\nArticle 25. Transfer and Restrictions on Transfer of Name\n\nA name may be transferred only when:\n\n1. It is transferred together with the transfer of the whole enterprise, including its rights and obligations;\n\n2. It is the name of an enterprise that has been entirely and lawfully dissolved.\n\nUpon the proper transfer of a name in accordance with item 1 above, the transferee shall notify the debtors and creditors of the enterprise within sixty days and notify the relevant enterprise registration officers within five working days from the date of the transfer.\n\nAny improper transfer of a name in any form, including monopolizing the market through the transfer of any name, is forbidden. In the event of any violation, the transferor and transferee shall be liable for their acts in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of the Lao PDR.\n\nA State company is not permitted to transfer its name to any other type of enterprise.\n\n24 This appears to be a reference to the contract between the owner of the name or license and the permitted user of the name or license, as referred to in Article 23.\n\n25 This term refers to legal capacity and mental capacity.\n\n11\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 26. Cancellation of Name\n\nA name shall be cancelled together with the dissolution of the enterprise. Upon termination of a name, the owner of the name shall remove the sign of its name within seven days from the date of the notice of termination.\n\nAny individual or legal entity still using a cancelled name or enterprise license shall be deemed to be conducting business without a proper enterprise registration.\n\nPart III Sole-Trader Enterprises\n\nArticle 27. Filing of Notification for Enterprise Registration\n\nAny person intending to register a sole-trader enterprise shall submit an application with the following details:\n\n1. The name and kind of business; 2. The name, address and nationality of the enterprise owner and\n\nmanager; 3. The location of the enterprise; 4. The registered capital.\n\nArticle 28. Rights and Duties of Owner\n\nThe owner of a sole-trader enterprise has the following rights and duties:\n\n1. To administer and manage the enterprise himself26 or to employ other persons to administer and manage the enterprise;\n\n2. To decide by himself the use of profits or other matters relating to the enterprise;\n\n3. To keep accounts as provided by the Law on Enterprise Accounting; 4. To perform obligations towards the State; 5. To perform other rights and duties as provided by the laws.\n\n26 Readers should note that the Lao language does not distinguish between genders in pronouns. In this translation, a reference to a gender is a reference to all genders, unless the context requires otherwise (as is the case in some Articles). The translatorsâ decision to use the male gender pronoun as the default translation was made in the interests of simplicity and consistency.\n\n12\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 29. Manager\n\nThe manager of a sole-trader enterprise may be the owner himself or one or several third parties27 employed as managers. An external employed manager is remunerated as agreed with the owner of the sole-trader enterprise.\n\nA sole-trader enterprise with several managers may appoint one manager as the overall supervisor who shall solely have authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the sole-trader enterprise with third parties. Such manager is called the âgeneral managerâ. This provision is also applicable to managers of partnership enterprises and one-person limited companies.\n\nA manager performs all his tasks on the basis of the rights and duties described in the contract and under the supervision of the enterprise owner.\n\nA manager may assign certain of his tasks to other assistants.\n\nArticle 30. Managerâs Employment Contract\n\nA managerâs employment contract shall be made in writing as provided by the Contract Law. The contents of the employment contract shall describe the rights, duties, remuneration and responsibilities of the contracting parties and how the contract may be terminated.\n\nRelations between the enterprise owner, manager(s), and third parties are governed by the relevant laws.\n\nArticle 31. Dissolution and Liquidation\n\nA sole-trader enterprise is dissolved in the following cases:\n\n1. The sole-trader enterprise owner decides to dissolve the enterprise; 2. Dissolution by court order; 3. Bankruptcy28; 4. Death or lack of capacity29 of an enterprise owner who has no heir.\n\nIn the event that the sole-trader enterprise is dissolved, its owner shall have the obligation to liquidate the enterprise by himself or to appoint third parties as liquidators, except when the dissolution is ordered by the court or the sole-trader enterprise is in bankruptcy, in which case only the court shall appoint the liquidator.\n\n27 The literal translation of this term is âpersons outside of the companyâ.\n\n28 This is a reference to final declaration of bankruptcy by the court.\n\n29 This term has the connotation of mental capacity.\n\n13\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nPart IV Partnership Enterprises\n\nChapter 1 General Principles Relating to Partnership Enterprises\n\nArticle 32. Partners of Partnership Enterprise\n\nInvestors in a partnership enterprise are called âpartnersâ.\n\nPartners in a partnership enterprise may be individuals or legal entities.\n\nArticle 33. Partnership Contract\n\nA partnership contract shall be made in writing and shall be consistent with the Contract Law of the Lao PDR.\n\nA partnership contract shall describe the following primary contents: 1. The name of the enterprise; 2. The business purpose; 3. The names [and] locations of the headquarters and all branches, if\n\nany; 4. The stated capital or value of shares of the partnership enterprise\n\ndivided into cash, kind or labour; 5. The names, addresses and nationalities of the partners of the\n\npartnership; 6. The names and signatures of all partners of the partnership.\n\nThe stated capital described in item 4 of this article is the registered capital of the partnership enterprise.\n\nArticle 34. The Status of Partnership Enterprise as Legal Entity\n\nThe indices of the status of a partnership enterprise as a legal entity comprise:\n\n1. The name of the partnership; 2. The names [and] locations of its headquarters and all branches, if any; 3. The assets and capital; 4. The bylaws of the partnership enterprise; 5. Liability for debts according to the form of partnership enterprise; 6. The legal capacity to exercise rights and obligations, and to be a\n\nplaintiff or defendant [in legal proceedings] in the same manner as natural persons.\n\n14\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 35. Branches of Partnership Enterprises\n\nA partnership enterprise registered in the Lao PDR is not required to further register its branches and such branches shall not have the status of a separate legal entity from the partnership enterprise.\n\nEach branch office shall notify the enterprise registration officers at that location.\n\nA branch of a foreign partnership enterprise operating in the Lao PDR is required to register the enterprise in accordance with this law.\n\nThe establishment of a branch of a Lao partnership enterprise in a foreign country shall be governed by the laws of that country.\n\nIn the event that the branch of a domestic or foreign legal entity is sued in the Lao PDR, such suit shall be deemed to be against that legal entity. This provision covers foreign legal entities that have branches in the Lao PDR.\n\nArticle 36. Bylaws of Partnership Enterprises\n\nThe bylaws of a partnership enterprise shall contain the following main items:\n\n1. The matters specified in item 1 to item 5 of Article 33 of this law; 2. The names, addresses and nationalities of the managers of the\n\npartnership enterprise. In the event that other partners are not co- managers, restrictions on the use of power of the managers may be defined;\n\n3. The method for the distribution of profits and responsibility for the partnershipâs losses;\n\n4. The method and schedule of payment for shares; 5. Administration and management; 6. Meetings and rules for the adoption of resolutions; 7. Resolution of disputes; 8. Dissolution and liquidation.\n\nThe contents of item 1 of this article must be included in the notification of enterprise registration, but30 the partnership enterprise may [decide to] include additional contents.\n\nThe bylaws of a partnership enterprise must be signed by its manager.\n\n30 The literal translation of this phrase is âexcept that the partnership enterprise shall decide to include additional contentsâ. The idea here is that only item 1 is mandatory and must be included in the application; items 2 to 8 are optional.\n\n15\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 37. Modification of Establishment Contract31 or Bylaws\n\nAny modification to the contents of the establishment contract or bylaws of a partnership enterprise shall be made by unanimous consent of all partners, except as otherwise agreed.\n\nResolutions on the amendment or modification of such establishment contract or bylaws shall be notified to the relevant enterprise registration officers within ten working days from the date of the partnersâ meeting adopting such resolution on modification.\n\nChapter 2 General Partnership Enterprises\n\nA.

Capital Contributions\n\nThe capital of a general partnership enterprise is contributed by the partners. Such capital contribution may be provided in cash, in kind or in labour.\n\n31 This contract appears to be the same as a partnership contract.\n\n32 The translators are aware that there are slightly different references in this Article, namely, to the previously mentioned process of ânotification for registrationâ (see also footnote 16), to an application form, and to an application for giving notification of registration. It would appear that this article aims to spell out in greater detail the process commonly referred to generally as ânotification for registrationâ.\n\n16\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nCapital contributed in kind or in labour shall be appraised in monetary terms. Capital provided in labour shall not be recorded in the balance sheet of the general partnership enterprise.\n\nThe methods and schedule of payment for shares specified in paragraph one of this article shall be agreed among the partners.

Manager\n\nAll partners in a general partnership enterprise may act as co-managers or appoint one or more partners to be managers.\n\nThe manager is the representative of the general partnership and of the other partners. The manager shall not receive a salary or bonuses for the performance of his duties, unless otherwise agreed.\n\nThe manager of a general partnership enterprise may be a third party. A third party appointed as manager shall be remunerated with a salary or bonuses as agreed by the partners.\n\nArticle 42. Appointment or Removal of Manager\n\nThe appointment or removal of the manager requires the unanimous vote of all partners, unless otherwise agreed. Each partner has one vote.\n\nThe partner to be appointed or removed as manager is not entitled to cast a vote.\n\n17\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 43. Rights and Duties of Manager\n\nThe manager has the following rights and duties:\n\n1. To fully and faithfully perform his duties33 for the best interests of the general partnership enterprise;\n\n2. To exercise the rights and perform the duties described in the bylaws of the general partnership enterprise;\n\n3.

Each person shall have one vote.\n\nIn the event that there is a single manager, such manager shall have the sole authority to administer and manage the general partnership enterprise, unless restrictions are otherwise provided.\n\nThe restrictions referred to in paragraph three of this article shall have no effect upon third parties if such restrictions are not stipulated in the enterprise registration filing.\n\nArticle 44.

To receive a portion of contributed capital and profits as agreed when the general partnership enterprise is dissolved.\n\nArticle 45. Acceptance of New Partners and Transfer of Shares\n\nA general partnership enterprise may not accept new partners and each partner may not transfer shares among themselves, unless otherwise agreed.\n\n33 The literal translation of this term is âto fully perform his duties and with loyaltyâ.\n\n18\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nIn the event that the partners agree to accept a new partner or to allow the transfer of shares, unanimous consent is required from all partners.\n\nThe acceptance of new partners may be carried out by transferring shares to third parties or by allowing a third party to acquire a portion of newly issued shares.\n\nUpon a decision to accept a new partner or to transfer shares to another [partner], [the partnership enterprise] shall notify the relevant enterprise registration officers within five working days from the date of the decision on such acceptance or transfer.\n\nIn the event that only one partner remains in the general partnership enterprise as a result of the transfer of shares or for any other reason, the general partnership enterprise shall be dissolved.\n\nIn the event that the name of the general partnership enterprise includes the names of partners, when one partner withdraws, the general partnership enterprise is entitled to delete such partnerâs name from its name.\n\nArticle 46.

Exemptions from Restrictions\n\n[A partner] may be exempted from the restrictions described in Article 46 of this law when:\n\n34 The literal translation of this term is âhaving unlimited liabilityâ.\n\n19\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\n1. [He has] obtained the unanimous consent of all other partners; 2. Such act or business transaction by the partner was carried out prior\n\nto [his] joining the partnership and the other partners did not object.\n\nB. Relationship between General Partnership Enterprises and Third Parties\n\nArticle 48. Liability for Debts\n\nEach partner shall have unlimited liability for the debts of the general partnership enterprise. A creditor may claim for payment of debt from each partner but only after it has made a claim against the general partnership enterprise which remains unsettled.\n\nAll partners may agree on the proportion of each partnerâs liability for the debts or losses of the general partnership enterprise, but such agreement shall have no effect on third parties.\n\nPartners are liable for the debts of the partnership only when:\n\n1. Such debts arise from the performance of duties of the manager or other partners in accordance with bylaws of the general partnership enterprise;\n\n2. Such debts arise from the performance of any duty to achieve the purpose of the general partnership enterprise and such acts were approved by all partners.\n\nArticle 49.

Merger of General Partnership Enterprises\n\nArticle 51. Merger of General Partnership Enterprises\n\nA general partnership enterprise may merge with one or several other general partnership enterprises into either the original partnership enterprise or into a new general partnership enterprise.\n\nGeneral partnership enterprises may merge only when the following conditions are met:\n\n1. Unanimous consent was obtained in a meeting of all partners of the general partnership enterprises to be merged, unless otherwise agreed. The resolutions adopted by such meeting shall be registered with the enterprise registration officers within ten working days from the date of the resolution to merge;\n\n2. The merger has been published through appropriate mass media at least once within ten working days from the date the resolution to merge is adopted to inform and allow creditors to oppose the merger within sixty days from the date the creditors receive the notification, and creditors fail to oppose or respond within the stipulated period of time;\n\n3. The enterprise has been registered again.\n\nArticle 52. Objection to Merger and Effects of Merger\n\nIn the event that a creditor objects to the merger of a general partnership enterprise, [the general partnership enterprise] cannot merge, unless all debts have been paid to that creditor only.\n\nA merger of general partnership enterprises does not result in the dissolution of the enterprises [or]35 the lapse of previous rights or responsibilities.\n\nD. Dissolution of General Partnership Enterprises\n\nArticle 53. Grounds for Dissolution\n\nA general partnership enterprise may be dissolved on three grounds: dissolution by agreement between the partners, dissolution by court order and dissolution by operation of law36.\n\n35 See footnote 20.\n\n36 The literal translation of this term is âdissolution by legal effectâ.\n\n21\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe enterprise registration officers shall be temporarily notified37 of the dissolution of a general partnership enterprise on any grounds within ten working days from the date the grounds for dissolution occurred.\n\nArticle 54. Dissolution by Agreement between Partners\n\nA general partnership enterprise may be dissolved by unanimous agreement of the partners.\n\nArticle 55. Dissolution by Court Order\n\nAny partner of a general partnership enterprise may request the court to consider the dissolution of the general partnership enterprise when he finds that:\n\n1. The general partnership enterprise has suffered losses and cannot solve [the problem];\n\n2. An event of force majeure occurs making it impossible to continue the business of the general partnership enterprise;\n\n3. Such partner has been misled or forced to become a partner; 4. A partner has committed an act or is acting with the intention to\n\nbreach the partnership contract or the bylaws or is acting in gross negligence and causing severe damage to the general partnership enterprise.\n\nThe partner requesting the court to consider the dissolution shall not be the partner causing the aforementioned events.\n\nOther partners may request the court to order the partner at fault to pay compensation or to withdraw from the partnership enterprise instead of ordering dissolution. In such event, the general partnership enterprise shall distribute the assets of the enterprise to such partner at the current value of such assets after deducting the damage caused by such partner, unless otherwise agreed by the partners.\n\nArticle 56. Dissolution by Operation of Law\n\nA general partnership enterprise may be dissolved on any of the following legal grounds:\n\n1. Dissolution in accordance with the contract or bylaws of the general partnership enterprise;\n\n2. Only one partner remains in the general partnership enterprise; 3. A partner dies, becomes bankrupt or has no legal capacity, except as\n\notherwise agreed;\n\n37 This is a literal translation. It appears to be a reference to temporary dissolution upon the occurrence of the events set out in Article 53 as opposed to permanent dissolution under Article 67.\n\n22\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\n4. Dissolution stipulated in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of Part II of this law.\n\nIn the event that a partner dies but the general partnership enterprise is not dissolved, the heir of the deceased partner is entitled to receive the full distribution of dividends or assets of the deceased partner.\n\nArticle 57.

Appointment or Removal of Liquidator\n\nLiquidation of a general partnership enterprise may be carried out by the manager or all partners as joint liquidators or by appointing a partner or a third party to act as the liquidator. Such appointment shall require unanimous approval from all partners.\n\nIn the event that the votes cast by partners for the selection of the liquidator are not sufficient as required in paragraph one of this article, the partners of the general partnership enterprise may request the court to appoint the liquidator.\n\n23\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe liquidator specified under this article and Article 60 of this law shall be removed in the same way he38 was appointed.\n\nArticle 60.

To collect all assets, and to create a balance sheet;\n\n38 For readability, these provisions have been translated as if the liquidator is a natural person; however, in practice, liquidators can be legal entities or natural persons.\n\n39 The time limit qualifies both the written notice and the announcement.\n\n24\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\n3. To continue to complete pending business of the general partnership enterprise;\n\n4.

First, to refer to the meetings held by the directors. Second, to refer the âbody of directorsâ attending such meetings. The second meaning is intended here and in similar provisions dealing with shareholdersâ meetings.\n\n46\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe removal of directors elected by cumulative voting may only take place if the votes for his removal53 are at least equal to the number of votes that elected that director.\n\nOrdinary voting is the vote to elect one director where one share is equal to one vote.\n\nThe elected candidate under paragraph four of this article is the person who receives over half "
