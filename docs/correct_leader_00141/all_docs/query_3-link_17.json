His el- evation closed the books on a long period of uncertainty during which the health of his predecessors and the succession question seemed to dominate Soviet domestic politics. The succession differed from the previous ones in significant respects-the speed with which it took place, the unusual nature of the speech by Foreign Minister Gromyko nominating Gorbachev, and the low profile of the military in the proceedings. The elevation of the youngest member of the Politburo to the post of general secretary is a major watershed in the transfer of power from the generation of Soviet leaders that rose in the party leadership under Stalin. Over the past three years most of the inner core of the leadership that ruled the Soviet Union during the Brezhnev regime has passed from the scene. In overseeing the completion of this transition, Gorbachev appears to be in a favorable position to build a solid base of power and move on to address domestic problems that his predecessors were unable to tackle. Despite the obligatory reaffirmation of continuity in foreign policy, Gorbachev gave early hints that he was prepared to try to accelerate changes begun under Chernenko and to take new initiatives in some areas that have long been neglected. At the same time, Gorbachev exhibited an energetic leadership style by meeting with an unprecedented number of foreign dignitaries at the Chernenko funeral. Gorbachev's most dramatic move was his meeting with the Chinese represen- tative-the first such meeting in more than 20 years. The new regime also in- dicated that it was prepared to look for ways to improve relations with the West and with former adversaries in the communist movement. Gorbachev's rhetorical restraint and the Soviet media's nonpolemical coverage of his meeting with Vice President Bush suggested that Moscow will continue the ef- fort begun under Chernenko to ease tensions with the United States. 1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Emergence of Gorbachev Mikhail Gorbachev rose to the post of general secretary in part by being at the right place at the right time, and he does not appear to have an independent base of political power. After serving as a full Politburo member for only two years and working only in agriculture, he emerged as a contender for the lead- ership of the party during the regime of Yuriy Andropov, who apparently turned to Gorbachev as one of the few young members of the Politburo and Secretariat who could help him gain control over the party apparatus. The public record of Gorbachev's advancement during this period suggests that Andropov relied increasingly upon the younger man as his own health deteriorated: ? In April 1983 Gorbachev's name began to appear with those of other senior Politburo members on obituaries for a wide range of officials, and he delivered the annual Lenin Day speech-an honor given to Andropov in 1982 and Chernenko in 1981. ? By June, when he helped install a new party leader in Leningrad and a new RSFSR premier, it was evident that he had assumed responsibility for the key area of personnel matters. ? In August 1983, shortly before Andropov was removed from public life by his illness, the general secretary symbolically gave Gorbachev special attention among the leaders of the new generation. Andropov and Gorba- chev were the only party leaders that addressed a meeting of older cadres at which Andropov made a special plea for orderly transfer of power and authority to younger leaders. When Andropov died in February 1984, the party leadership again put off handing over power to a member of the younger generation and turned instead to 72-year-old Konstantin Chernenko, the senior-ranking member of the Secretariat. The transfer of power nevertheless involved another big boost for Gorbachev, who assumed most of the responsibilities Chernenko had been exercising as second secretary under Andropov without giving up any of his previous duties: ? He took over supervision of ideological matters from Chernenko, for example, succeeding him as chairman of the Politburo commission on education reform. 2 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 ? He began playing a lead role in economic planning, addressing meetings on long-term planning in mid-1984. ? He succeeded Chernenko as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the USSR Supreme Soviet Council of the Union and made a widely publicized trip to Britain in December 1984. By contrast, Grigoriy Romanov, the only other full Politburo member also in the Secretariat, and Gorbachev's chief rival in the succession, apparently assumed no new responsibilities outside his sphere of secu- rity matters and heavy industry. More- over, despite the vacancies in the Secretar- iat, no new secretaries were named, leaving Gorbachev a free hand. Gorbachev speaking at Chernenko funeral. (Soviet televi- sion 13 March 1985) Under Chernenko there were persisting signs that some members of the leadership were trying to slow Gorbachev's rise. There were inconsistencies in his ranking in the leadership throughout the period, and although he was ranked third-after Chernenko and Tikhonov-on many im- portant occasions, he sometimes appeared below Kremlin elders Gromyko, Ustinov, and Grishin. During October and November signs of resistance to Gorbachev increased, and for a brief period it appeared that Romanov was being advanced at Gorbachev's expense. At an 18 October award ceremony attended by the Politburo, Gorbachev appeared in an unusually low ranking position, while Romanov stood in Gorbachev's usual spot. During the same period Romanov played a much more active public role, while Gorbachev was conspicuously absent from several key leadership meetings. Gorbachev resumed a high profile in early December, and by the time of Chernenko's death on 10 March he was the best placed to succeed him. He was the second-ranking party secretary and was already exercising oversight responsibility for most key areas of party work. Foreign Minister Gromyko re- vealed in his nominating speech that Gorbachev had \"led\" the Secretariat and chaired Politburo sessions in Chernenko's absence. 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 The option of again turning to a member of the older generation had largely disappeared: Defense Minister Ustinov died in December; Premier Tikhonov is almost 80; 75-year-old Foreign Minister Gromyko has had no experience in domestic affairs; 70-year-old Moscow party leader Grishin, a more likely candidate, has never worked in the central party apparatus. Moreover, the deaths of Ustinov and Chernenko had significantly reduced the voting power of the older generation in the Politburo. Transfer of Power Departures from precedent during the leadership transition reveal something of the politics and character of the new regime. The transition took place much faster than after the deaths of Brezhnev and Andropov, projecting an image of efficiency and suggesting that there was no serious opposition to Gorbachev's selection. Gromyko's unusual nominating speech was marked by a personal tone totally unlike the set-piece nominating addresses delivered at the two earlier plenums. The meager role of the military in the transition was also a break with the past. Timing of Succession: Leadership Moves With Unusual Speed The current transfer of power was faster than previous transitions in .a number of respects.' The announcement that Gorbachev would head Chernenko's funeral commission came earlier than the comparable announcements after the deaths of Brezhnev and Andropov. In all three cases the person who would be named general secretary headed the commission, suggesting that the Politburo had discussed the decision about the new general secretary before the announcement was released. The CPSU plenum that elected Gorbachev was convened hastily, the day after Chernenko's death, with the result that many Central Committee members not already in Moscow probably were unable to attend. Not even all the Politburo members were present- Ukrainian party chief Vladimir Shcherbitskiy was leading a parliamentary delegation to the United States and did not return to Moscow until the day af- ter the plenum. The plenum had been held one day later following the deaths of Brezhnev in 1982 and Stalin in March 1953, and three days later following Andropov's death last year. Chernenko's funeral was also held one day earlier than the ceremonies for Brezhnev and Andropov. ' Table 5 provides details on the timing of the last three Soviet successions. 4 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 CPSU Plenum: Nominating Speech Breaks With Past Gromyko phrased his nominating address in direct, colorful idiom totally unlike that normally used on formal party occasions. Unlike the nominating speeches for Andropov and Chernenko, delivered respectively by Chernenko and Tikhonov, Gromyko's speech was not publicized in Soviet mass media, al- though it was published in a pamphlet on the proceedings of the plenum, released on 14 March. Its intriguing statements about Gorbachev aside, the unique character of Gromyko's speech is apparent in the ways it differed from the nominating speeches in 1982 and 1984: ? Gromyko did not once mention Chernenko. By contrast, Tikhonov devoted half of his speech to praising Andropov before he nominated Chernenko, and Chernenko spent more than half of his nominating speech for Andropov praising former General Secretary Brezhnev. ? Gromyko claimed to be revealing the \"content\" and \"atmosphere\" of the Po- litburo meeting that selected Gorbachev to replace Chernenko. Previous nominating speeches included stock phrases about the Politburo's belief in the worthiness of the candidate, but otherwise did not purport to reflect the discussions among the top party leaders. Gromyko's accolades for Gorbachev were far different from the dry records of party service and qualities of character that were marshaled in speeches nominating Andropov and Chernenko. His emphasis on pragmatic qualities of intelligence and reason was so atypical of Soviet statements that it may have reflected his personal enthusiasm for Gorbachev. Other areas discussed in the speech-Gorbachev's abilities and attitudes in foreign affairs and security matters-may have been stressed by Gromyko not only because of his own ex- pertise in these fields but also because Gorbachev's public record and experience are so thin in these areas. Outlining what he presented as the view of the Politburo, Gromyko praised Gorbachev as a \"man of principle\" who speaks his mind directly, has a \"keen profound intellect,\" and approaches problems analytically. Noting that poli- tics will \"just stand still\" without more than analysis, he also maintained that Gorbachev had demonstrated \"many a time\" in the Politburo and Secretariat that he also had the ability to draw conclusions. Appearing to suggest that Gorbachev would not be dogmatic, Gromyko maintained that he does not see 5 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 issues in terms of \"black and white\" but in \"intermediate colors.\" At the same time, Gromyko described Gorbachev as a man of \"strong convictions\" who \"states his position frankly,\" whether or not others agree. He also said the Po- litburo agreed that Gorbachev was gifted in organizational and communica- tion skills. ---- In the area of foreign policy, Gromyko spoke in more personal terms and used language apparently designed to allay mis- givings about Gorbachev's experience. He stated that by virtue of his own service it might be \"clearer\" to him than to \"certain other comrades\" that Gorbachev \"grasps very well and rapidly the essence of the processes taking place outside our coun- try,\" and he added that Gorbachev had repeatedly drawn \"correct, party conclu- sions\" in foreign affairs. Gromyko also offered assurances about Gorbachev's views on defense, asserting that Gorbachev had argued at Politburo sessions that the Soviet Union must \"keep its powder dry\" Foreign Minister Gromyko at Cher- and that defense must be kept \"at the nenko funeral. (Soviet television, 13 March 1985) necessary level.\" Going unusually far in acknowledging Soviet concern about the impact of the succession on world opinion, Gromyko also warned that the world was watching, looking for \"cracks of some kind in the leadership.\" He affirmed that the Politburo was unanimous in the opinion that the leadership \"will not allow our political opponents any satisfaction on this score.\" The Election In reporting the election of Gorbachev, the plenum communique published in Pravda used an unusual term in characterizing the decision as unanimous. Rather than the term used to describe the elections of Andropov and Chernenko, yedinoglasno (a unanimous vote), the communique used the less precise term yedinodushno, implying full agreement. Yedinodushno had been used to describe Brezhnev's reelection as general secretary at the plenums in 1971, 1976, and 1981 but has rarely been used in accounts of plenums in recent years. The implications of this terminology are not clear. The two terms have appeared to be used interchangeably on some occasions in the past-for example, at the conclusion of the 1981 CPSU congress Pravda on 4 March 6 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 used both terms to describe Brezhnev's election. At other times, there appears to have been a distinction: An account of the June 1983 Central Committee plenum contained in the plenum's stenographic report suggests that yedino- dushno means approval by acclamation rather than by vote. Chernenko, who was chairing the plenum, used both terms in describing approval for a draft resolution on the nomination of Andropov as Supreme Soviet Presidium chairman. Chernenko characterized the \"stormy applause\" that greeted the resolution as \"unanimous (yedinodushnoye) acceptance\" of the resolution. But he added, \"In view of the importance of the question, I consider it advisable to have a vote.\" The plenum then approved the resolution yedinoglasno. Gorbachev's Gorbachev's plenum speech was more conventional Acceptance than Gromyko's nominating speech, assuring his audi- Speech ence of his commitment to collective decisionmaking and the maintenance of Soviet defense capabilities, as Chernenko and Andropov had done in their speeches to the plenums that elected them: ? On collectivity, Gorbachev pledged to implement policies \"elaborated collectively\" and appealed to the rest of the leadership, saying he was \"counting on the support and active help of the Politburo members, candidate members, and Central Committee secretaries and of the party's Central Committee as a whole.\" Chernenko, in his acceptance speech, had similarly pledged that he would \"exert every effort\" to work \"together\" with other members of the leadership and would further advance \"by collective efforts\" the work initiated by Andropov. Andropov's acceptance speech is not known to have been publicized by Soviet media, but in his opening speech to the plenum he observed that \"the collective wisdom of the party, its collective leadership\" must play an important role in policymaking. ? On defense, Gorbachev pledged to maintain Soviet defenses \"at a level such that any aggressors\" will recognize that attempts to encroach on the security of the USSR or its allies \"will be met with a crushing retaliatory strike.\" To accomplish this, he said, the armed forces would continue to receive \"everything necessary.\" Chernenko had similarly pledged to \"further see to it that our country's defense capability is strengthened so that we should have enough means to cool the hot heads of belligerent adventurists,\" calling this \"a very substantial prerequisite for preserving peace.\" Andropov paid direct tribute to \"the invincible might of the Soviet Armed Forces\" as the 7 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Military leaders stand honor guard at Chernenko lying-in-state ceremony; left to right: Main Political Directorate Chief Yepishev, Warsaw Pact Commander in Chief Kulikov, General Staff Chief Akhromeyev, Defense Minister Sokolov.

Given the highly symbolic implications of the ceremonies sur- rounding successions, it is unlikely that the changes in the protocol of the fu- neral can be explained merely by the fact that the defense minister is no longer a member of the Politburo or by Chernenko's lack of military rank. The exclusion of the military comes in the wake of earlier indications of reduced military influence in the political leadership. The military's role in the public ceremonies has declined successively in each of the last three transfers of power: ? The military was most prominent at Brezhnev's funeral in November 1982 when Defense Minister Ustinov delivered a eulogy and was the only 8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Politburo member other than General Secretary Andropov to speak. The next four ranking senior officers-First Deputy Defense Ministers Ogarkov, Kulikov, Sokolov, and Main Political Directorate Chief Yepishev-were also present on the mausoleum with party leaders and the members of the funeral commission. ? At Andropov's funeral in February 1984, the military was given less symbolic importance. Ustinov shared the limelight with Foreign Minister Gromyko as supporting speakers at the funeral. Ogarkov, Kulikov, and Yepishev again stood on the mausoleum, but Sokolov was apparently away from Moscow. ? Military leaders had no role at Chernenko's funeral. Only civilians stood on the mausoleum and delivered eulogies. Defense Minister Sokolov was not even named to the funeral commission. (Ustinov was on the commissions for Brezhnev and Andropov along with all the other Moscow-based Politburo members.) By contrast, in 1953 Defense Minister Vasilevskiy was named to Stalin's funeral commission even though he was not a Politburo member. The military leaders' only public role during the Chernenko funeral was a brief appearance in the honor guard during a lying-in-state ceremony shown on television on 12 March. New Regime Gorbachev is in a highly favorable position to influence the composition of the top leadership. Additions to the Politburo and Secretariat over the past three years have not kept pace with departures, bringing the size of both bodies to their lowest levels in two decades; other leaders can be expected to depart soon.' In addition, Ustinov's replacement as defense minister is 73 and clearly intended to be an interim choice. As the party prepares for the 27th CPSU Congress in the coming year, Gorbachev will also be able to influence the composition of the Central Committee and the regional party leadership. An early indication of Gorbachev's political strength could be the handling of the chairmanship of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet. When Gorbachev nominated Chernenko for the post in April 1984 he linked the 2 In the past three years nine Politburo and Secretariat members have died or resigned: Suslov, Brezhnev, Kirilenko, Rashidov, Kiselev, Pelshe, Andropov, Ustinov, and Chernenko. Many of the remaining members are old: Kuznetsov is 84, Ponomarev is 80, Tikhonov is 79, and Gromyko is 75; Kunayev, Solomentsev, Grishin, and Kapitonov are all in their early 70's. 9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY office with that of general secretary, stating that it was in the national interest for the same person to hold both posts. He maintained that the Central Committee, proceeding from the interests of Soviet society and government, \"recognized the necessity\" for Chernenko to hold both posts and that this arrangement had \"great significance\" for the conduct of foreign policy. Having thus made an institutional case for linking the two positions, Gorbachev would suffer an important loss of prestige if he were not also elected head of state, an office held by Brezhnev (since 1977), Andropov, and Chernenko. Leadership Rankings: Continuity on Top, Confusion Below There were no signs of change in the power relationships among top leaders in the immediate aftermath of Chernenko's death. Aside from Gorbachev's rise to the top spot, the senior Politburo members remained in their presuccession order during all the formal lineups connected with Chernenko's funeral, with Tikhonov coming first, followed by Gromyko, Grishin, and Romanov. Roma- nov was in a more prominent position during graveside ceremonies where the ranking was less formal, standing on one side of Gorbachev while Tikhonov stood on the other.

(Soviet television, 11 March 1985) In contrast to the clear lineup of the top five, the rankings of other members of the Politburo and Secretariat were inconsistent. There were nine lineups during the lying-in-state and funeral ceremonies, and no two were alike.' At least one anomaly may have some significance: Vorotnikov, who normally appears in last place among full Politburo members, had a more prominent spot at the 11 March lying-in-state ceremony following the plenum when he stood on one side of Gorbachev, while Tikhonov and the other top leaders stood on the other. Gorbachev's appearance in this same position at a lying-in- state ceremony following the plenum that elected Chernenko apparently reflected his increased status, but it is too early to tell if the parallel will hold true for Vorotnikov. aniildinng a Coalition: Gorbacbev's Allies and Opponents Among the elders in the Politburo, Gromyko and Grishin have given Gorbachev the strongest public show of support-Gromyko with his impas- sioned nominating speech and Grishin by referring to Gorbachev as the head ' See Tables 1 and 2 of this report. 11 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY of the Politburo in a speech reported in Moskovskaya Pravda on 19 March. Gorbachev may get his firmest backing from the younger members of the leadership brought in under Andropov: Vorotnikov, Ligachev, and Ryzhkov.

Vorotnikov The leader with a public record closest to Gorbachev's on economic issues is 59-year-old Politburo member and RSFSR Premier Vitaliy Vorotnikov, who had the most meteoric rise of any leader under Andropov. For reasons that are unclear, Vorotnikov was removed as RSFSR first deputy premier and exiled as ambassador to Cuba in 1979. He was brought back into domestic politics in mid-1982 when Andro- pov's KGB campaign against corruption brought down Krasnodar First >,,,,._ 7111M,,_11111 Secretary Medunov, an apparent crony of Brezhnev; Vorotnikov was installed in his place and carried out a vigorous purge of local officials. In June 1983 he was elected premier of the RSFSR, after being nominated by Gorbachev, and candidate member of the Politbu- ro. He was promoted to full membership in the Politburo with unusual speed in December 1983. Like Gorbachev, Vorotnikov has publicly stressed a need to stimulate initiative through economic incen- tives and administrative decentralization. As RSFSR premier, he has vigorously shaken up the republic ministries and promoted economic management reforms, including a major economic experiment in the services sector that is designed to reduce planning controls and stimulate initiative and quality work. In a speech in Turkmeni- stan, reported in the 23 December 1984 Pravda, Vorotnikov called for a new approach to solving economic problems at all levels, \"from the worker and kol- khoznik to the minister.\" According to the 27 November 1984 Zarya Vostoka, he \"highly praised\" economic experiments being conducted in Georgia during a November 1984 visit to the republic and stated that this ex- perience should be \"disseminated in other parts of the country.\" In recent years Gorbachev has also shown more interest in Georgia's economic experi- ments than any other national-level leader. 12 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Ligachev Yegor Ligachev, 64, is Gorbachev's direct subordinate in the leadership. He was brought to Moscow to head the Central Committee's Party Organization Work Department in April 1983, and by June 1983 there were clear signs that Gorbachev was overseeing this department. Ligachev was raised to Central Committee secretary at the Yegor Ligachev December 1983 plenum and succeeded Gorbachev as chairman of the Council of the Union's Legislative Proposals Commission in April 1984, when Gorbachev moved up to chairman of the council's Foreign Affairs Commission. Prior to Chernenko's death Gorbachev seemed to be relying on Ligachev to fill some gaps in the Secre- tariat. Ligachev appeared to be taking on duties in the agricultural sector as Gorbachev assumed more and more responsibilities. For example, in January this year in a keynote address to a conference in Leningrad, Ligachev kicked off a campaign called for by Gorbachev to introduce the collective contract system of labor organization throughout the country's farms. On two occasions he also intruded into police activity, a sphere supervised by Romanov, most recently attending a 4 March conference of internal affairs ministers as the only representative of the leadership. Ryzhkov Nikolay Ryzhkov, a 55-year-old economic specialist, has probably also been working directly under Gorbachev. In November 1982 he became a CPSU secretary-and head of the Central Committee's new Economics Department and became involved in Nikolay Ryzhkov efforts to work out changes in the methods of planning and management. During 1984 Gorbachev apparently took over supervision of this department. Ryzhkov and Gorbachev's subordinate Ligachev were the only party secretaries to attend Gorbachev's February 1985 elec- tion speech. Ryzhkov also appears to support changes in economic management. Like Gorbachev and Vorotnikov, he has visited Georgia to observe economic experiments. Ac- cording to the 24 September 1983 Zarya Vostoka report on his visit, he praised innovations in the republic as a positive example for other areas. In speeches in February 1984 and February 1985 Ryzhkov praised national economic experiments begun in 1983 that increase the independence of enterprises. 13 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Romanov As the only other senior CPSU secretary, 62-year-old Grigoriy Romanov is Gorbachev's most obvious rival for political power. As overseer of the military-industrial complex and machine-building sector he is the chief spokesman for defense interests and will be a key actor in debates over allocation of resources. Even before he as- sumed this role Romanov was one of the strongest advocates in the leadership for the defense sector. If he is not constrained by political rivalry, Romanov may side with Gorbachev in efforts to change economic policy. He has long pressed for economic incentives and promoted many economic experiments. Shcherbitskiy Noted for his obvious ambition and his strong opin- ions, 67-year-old Ukrainian party leader and Politburo member Vladimir Shcherbitskiy may have sharp conflicts with Gorbachev. Shcherbitskiy has been outspoken in upholding defense interests and has often taken a hard line in foreign policy matters. In two September 1984 speeches he lobbied for beefing up defense, criticized reliance on trade with the West, and urged a big effort to develop Soviet technology independent of the West's. Shcherbitskiy's sharpest disagreement with Gorbachev may be in the sphere of economic policy. In a November 1984 Kommunist (No. 17) article he took po- sitions which appeared opposed to Gorbachev's calls for transferring more rights to plants and increasing \"self-management.\" He argued that any weakening of central planning and turn to market forces would disrupt economic production, would be conducive to the \"restoration of capitalism,\" and could not be called \"genuine people's self-management.\" Shcherbitskiy has not opposed all changes in economic management, however. In fact, he has cultivated an image of innovator in experimenting with new methods of advancing scientific and technological development. Dolgikh As a Politburo candidate member and the third or fourth ranking secretary (after Gorbachev, Romanov, and perhaps Ponomarev), 60-year-old Vladimir Dolgikh also is an important political figure. He has been most closely associated with Brezhnev, Kirilenko, and Chernenko. Although Dolgikh was the ranking secretary for economic questions when Andropov took over, Andropov bypassed him, naming Ryzh- kov secretary for economic planning and later bringing in Romanov to be senior secretary for industry, outranking Dolgikh. Dolgikh has not been an enthusiastic advocate of economic innovation and may not share Gorbachev's approach to improving economic performance. 14 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Military Role: Evidence of Decline Initial indications are that the military's influence in political matters will be minimal in the Gorbachev regime. This was suggested by the military's exclusion from a prominent role in the transition, against the background of apparent efforts by the party leadership to reduce the influence of the military under Chernenko. Gorbachev's own views on the military are largely un- known: He has no experience in military affairs, having never even served in the army, and has not taken clear public positions on defense matters. The most significant reduction of military influence in the leadership was produced by the death of Defense Minister and Politburo member Ustinov in December 1984 and the selection of a replacement who seemed to have been chosen precisely because he would be relatively weak and ineffectual. Ustinov's successor, 73-year-old Sergey Sokolov, was the oldest and least controversial of the three first deputy defense ministers and cannot be expected to rise to a position of power comparable to Ustinov's. Before too long, Gorbachev will probably have an opportunity to influence the choice of a new defense minister. The change in the Ministry of Defense came against the background of other indications of reduced military influence during the Chernenko regime. With the demotion of Chief of the General Staff Ogarkov three months before Ustinov's death, the party leadership removed a forceful advocate for defense interests from contention for the post of defense minister. Ogarkov's removal on 6 September was accompanied by the appearance of a formula in editorials in Pravda and the military paper Krasnaya Zvezda that asserted that funds would not be diverted from the consumer to meet defense needs, suggesting that a key resource decision that went against military interests had just been made. 15 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 New Dynamism in Foreign Policy Like Andropov and Chernenko before him, Mikhail Gorbachev began his tenure as general secretary by vowing to continue the broad outlines of foreign policy that he had inherited. While his public statements and actions during his first days in power supported this pledge in many key areas of Soviet inter- national relations, including U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations, there were also a number of signs that he will impart a more dynamic style to foreign pol- icy and that he may be significantly more open to changes in Soviet policy than his predecessor. Gorbachev's energetic leadership style was most evident in the unprecedented number of meetings he held with foreign dignitaries attending Chernenko's funeral.' Whereas Chernenko had met separately with 13 heads of state delegations at Andropov's funeral and Andropov with only seven at Brezh- nev's, Gorbachev met individually with 25 heads of state delegations as well as with UN Secretary General Perez de Cuellar and the heads of delegations from the Italian and Japanese Communist Parties. In addition, like Chernenko in February 1984, he met collectively with the six leaders of the other Warsaw Pact member-states. In a further indication of personal style and willingness to bend protocol, Gorbachev spent more time than planned with several foreign leaders, according to Western press accounts, forcing reshuffling of the schedule. Despite repetitions of the usual pledge of continuity in foreign policy, the new Soviet regime has given hints that it might both accelerate changes begun un- der Chernenko and take new initiatives in some neglected areas of foreign re- lations. In its most dramatic move to date, the Gorbachev regime made an im- portant symbolic gesture toward China when the new general secretary met with the Chinese representative at the funeral-the first such meeting in 20 years. Soviet actions in other key areas have contrasted less sharply with previous practice, but nevertheless have created an impression of movement toward both improved relations with the West and closer ties with several former adversaries in the communist movement: ? Gorbachev's conciliatory statements and nonpolemical Soviet press reporting of his meeting with Vice President Bush suggest that Moscow may want to give new impetus to the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations that began during the last few months of Chernenko's rule. ' For a list of meetings between the Soviet general secretary and foreign heads of delegations at the Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko funerals, see Tables 3 and 4. 16 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 ? The Soviet media's positive portrayal of Gorbachev's meetings with West European leaders, including West Germany's Chancellor Kohl, may reflect Gorbachev's interest in cultivating even stronger ties to the region. ? The breakthrough with China and an apparent effort to court the Yugoslavs suggest that higher priority will be given to improving Soviet relations with ruling communist states and parties outside the Soviet bloc. ? Gorbachev's meeting with the heads of delegations from the Italian and Japanese Communist Parties also raises the possibility that the new general secretary will push for a more accommodating approach toward dissident nonruling parties. Chernenko's passing may have little immediate effect on the conduct of Soviet foreign policy: ? In the authoritative tributes paid to him during the funeral period, Chernenko was credited with a comparatively minor role in the formulation of foreign policy, suggesting that Moscow wants to give the impression that Gorbachev and others in the present leadership were involved in and committed to the foreign policies followed over the past year. This character- ization may be genuine, given the high level of activity the Soviet leadership, particularly Gromyko, maintained during Chernenko's final period of grave illness and incapacitation. ? Gorbachev has relatively little experience in foreign affairs and may rely heavily on more experienced advisers, such as Foreign Minister Gromyko. Soviet media publicized Gromyko's presence at an overwhelming majority of Gorbachev's meetings with foreign leaders. Moscow has not yet identified any Gorbachev personal aide for international affairs although Andrey Aleksandrov, a foreign policy aide to every general secretary since 1966, and Viktor Sharapov, a specialist in relations with communist countries original- ly added to the general secretary's staff by Andropov, were judging by pictures shown on Soviet television-also involved in most of Gorbachev's meetings. In the previous two successions, Soviet media at comparable meetings explicitly identified aides to the general secretary. Despite the continuity lent by Gromyko's presence in the foreign affairs leadership, however, there are signs that continuity may be less in vogue than 17 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 it was in the previous two changes of general secretary. Pravda's handling of the question as well as remarks by a highly placed commentator point to the new regime's greater receptivity to change: ? An alteration in Pravda's handling of the question of continuity in its two editions on 13 March suggested a desire to avoid overplaying that theme in either domestic or foreign policy. In a sentence that in the first edition said Gorbachev's election had been seen both at home and abroad \"as yet more proof of the CPSU's unshakable loyalty to the Leninist course of creation and peace and as evidence of complete continuity in the party's policy,\" the second edition deleted the word \"complete.\" ? Izvestiya political observer Aleksandr Bovin, a member of the party's Central Auditing Commission and an influential foreign affairs journalist who is widely reported to have close contacts with the Soviet leadership, also appeared to indicate that continuity would not be accentuated as heavily under Gorbachev. Bovin told listeners to a domestic radio discussion program on 24 March that the regime's rhetorical devotion to \"consistency, continuity, and stability\" should not be interpreted as \"immobility.\" No foreign policy can be immobile \"if it wants to be effective,\" he said. Moscow's commitment to \"stability of principles\" does not rule out but \"presupposes,\" he argued, \"flexibility and the ability to alter one's actions depending on changing circumstances.\" United States: Moderate Stance Gorbachev adopted a moderate public posture toward the United States during his first days in power and reaffirmed Moscow's interest in arms control negotiations, particularly the U.S.-Soviet talks that opened in Geneva two days after Chernenko's death. Soviet leadership treatment of the United States traditionally has been circumspect in the early days of a new regime, but Gorbachev has been more restrained than Andropov was in 1982 and Chernenko in 1984. Gorbachev's first statement on foreign policy as general secretary, in his 11 March speech to the CPSU Central Committee, seemed calculated to reinforce the warming trend in U.S.-Soviet relations in recent months. He echoed positive statements about detente that had been made in two of the last 18 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 public statements attributed to Chernenko and avoided even the indirect criticism of the West that had marked early speeches by Andropov and Chernenko: ? Gorbachev used powerful images of U.S.-Soviet cooperation that had been invoked in Chernenko's 22 'February RSFSR Supreme Soviet election address and his 28 February reply to U.S. war veterans. He endorsed the \"success of detente achieved in the 1970's,\" affirmed that the Soviet Union was \"prepared to participate in a continuation of the process of establishing peaceful, mutually beneficial cooperation between states,\" and added that \"new steps in this direction\" would be a fitting commemoration for the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II. ? In arguing for arms control, Gorbachev warned that a \"frightful threat\" faces mankind but did not go on to blame the West explicitly for the problem. Both Andropov and Chernenko had been more critical on similar occasions, although both, like Gorbachev, had avoided any direct reference to the United States. In his funeral eulogy for Brezhnev, Andropov had accused the \"forces of imperialism\" of trying to \"push mankind onto the road of hostility and military confrontation.\" Chernenko, in his speech to the extraordinary plenum that elected him, had denounced the \"threat created today to humanity by the reckless, adventurist actions of imperialism's aggressive forces.\" Arms Control Gorbachev signaled that arms control will be given a high priority by devoting more attention to the subject in his 11 March plenum speech than to any other foreign policy issue. He said that \"the only sensible way out of the present situation is an accord between the forces opposed to each other on the immediate cessation of the arms race,\" particularly regarding nuclear and space arms. In describing Moscow's approach to the U.S.-Soviet talks in Geneva, he adopted the formulation used in Chernenko's election speech last month, saying that the Soviet Union does not seek \"unilateral advantages,\" wants a \"termination\" rather than \"contin- uation\" of the arms race, and endorses a mutual \"freeze\" on future nuclear missile deployments and a \"real and major cutback\" in stockpiled armaments on both sides. In keeping with the traditional constraints of the occasion, Gorbachev did not raise questions about U.S. earnestness toward the Geneva negotiations, as he had done in his election speech last month, but simply called on Washington to reciprocate the Soviet approach to the talks. 19 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 The attention devoted to arms control in Gorbachev's speech stands in marked contrast to the treatment of the issue in Chernenko's plenum acceptance speech in February 1984, at a time when Moscow was refusing to return to the negotiating table in Geneva. Chernenko spoke only in general terms of Soviet readiness for peaceful settlements of all disputed international problems through \"serious, equal, and constructive talks\" and, without naming the United States, complained that \"some leaders\" in the West \"do not realize or do not wish to realize\" the unprecedented need for cooperation to limit armaments. Vice President Bush and Secretary of State Shultz meet in the Kremlin with General Secretary Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Gromyko. (Soviet television, 14 March 1985) Meeting With Vice Soviet media took a slightly more positive approach to President the United States in coverage of the general secre- tary's 13 March meeting with Vice President Bush than they had taken during the two previous successions. The authoritative TASS report on the meeting said that Gorbachev had \"noted the importance of Soviet-U.S. relations\" and expressed Moscow's \"readiness, provided the U.S. side also was ready, to work in practice to improve them.\" TASS also re- ported that the Vice President similarly expressed Washington's desire to \"have better relations with the Soviet Union.\" In contrast, the TASS reports on the similar meetings with Chernenko and Andropov had not cited views 20 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 expressed by Vice President Bush, reporting only remarks by the Soviet leaders. Both Chernenko and Andropov were said to have insisted that bilateral relations be based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in internal affairs, and Chernenko had implied that U.S. failure to adhere to these principles was the key obstacle to an improvement in relations. Soviet media took the unusual step of calling attention to optimistic remarks by the Vice President after his meeting with Gorbachev and gave some indirect signals that Moscow may be receptive to the idea of a summit meeting between Gorbachev and President Reagan. A TASS dispatch from New York, quoted on Soviet television on 14 March, cited UPI in reporting that the Vice President had brought away from his conversation with Gorbachev \"a hope for an improvement\" in relations and had expressed the opinion, which he said was shared by President Reagan, that a summit would be \"useful.\" Soviet me- dia discussion of the possibility of a summit meeting has been rare in the re- cent past and has adhered to the position articulated by Gromyko in June 1983 that any such meeting must be adequately prepared in advance and that certain prerequisites must be met, including some degree of mutual understanding on major questions. West Europe: Stress on Improved Relations The Kremlin's treatment of West Europe during and immediately after the Chernenko funeral suggests that Moscow will continue to encourage improved ties with most West European countries and to promote opposition to U.S. de- fense policies. Soviet coverage of West German Chancellor Kohl's meeting with Gorbachev was markedly less critical than Moscow's accounts of other recent Soviet-West German meetings.. Following the example set by Chernenko at the time of Andropov's funeral, Gorbachev met with the delegation heads, of the major West European countries, including Britain, France, Italy, Spain, and West Germany. Authoritative TASS reports on these meetings avoided polemics and appeared to, reinforce' the effort to improve relations that characterized Gorbachev's December 1984 trip to Great Britain and Gromyko's' recent visits to Italy and Spain. 21 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 France As at the time of Andropov's funeral, Moscow re- served its warmest comments for the 13 March meet- ing between the new general secretary and the head of the French delegation. Gorbachev was quoted by TASS as referring in the meeting with President Mitterrand to the \"traditional sentiments of friendship and affection\" between the Soviet and French peoples, and both leaders were cited as endorsing the \"extension of political dialogue\" between them as an important factor affecting \"the political climate in Europe and elsewhere.\" Italy The official Soviet account of the new Soviet leader's meeting with Italian President Pertini and Foreign Minister Andreotti was somewhat warmer than the TASS report on their meeting with Chernenko in February 1984, avoiding criticism of Italy's support for NATO's INF deployments. As in the report on the Soviet-French meeting, it affirmed that Italy and the USSR intended to broaden their political contacts \"so as to promote the restoration of detente in Europe.\" Spain The reception Moscow gave the Spanish delegation indicated Soviet interest in strengthening ties with Madrid. Last year Spain sent a lower ranking delegation, headed by a deputy prime minister, which was not received by any of the top leadership. This year Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez journeyed to Moscow for the funeral and was received by the new general secretary. As in Soviet media treatment of Gromyko's recent visit to Madrid, the TASS report on Gorbachev's meeting with Gonzalez portrayed Spain as siding with the USSR in opposing the arms race \"in space,\" even though the Spanish Government has not adopted a formal public position on this issue. Great Britain Gorbachev's remarks to British Prime Minister Thatcher paralleled his statements during his visit to Great Britain last December and seemed designed to encourage improved relations. The report on the post-funeral Gorbachev-Thatcher meeting credit- ed both sides with an interest in \"political dialogue\" and in stepping up cooperation in economic, scientific, and other fields. As he had done in Britain, the new Soviet leader was reported by TASS as expressing opposition to the \"arms race in space ... and on earth,\" and he called on London to \"make a contribution toward changing the world situation for the better.\" Like the TASS description of the Soviet and British leaders' meeting after Andropov's funeral last year, the TASS report on the Gorbachev-Thatcher conversation did not mention INF. 22 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 General Secretary Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Gromyko pose with West German Chancellor Kohl prior to their Kremlin meeting. (Soviet television, 14 March 1985) West Germany Although Moscow aired a sterner depiction of Chan- cellor Kohl's 14 March meeting with Gorbachev than of any of the other meetings with West European leaders, the Soviet account was notably milder than Moscow's characterization of other Soviet-West German meetings over the past year: Last year, Moscow signaled its irritation with Bonn in its treatment of the Chernenko-Kohl meeting that took place after Andropov's funeral. Cher- nenko, according to TASS, drew attention to West Germany's support for NATO's missile deployments and restated the USSR's \"principled\" opposi- tion to them. By contrast, the report on the 14 March meeting between Gor- bachev and Kohl failed even to mention the INF issue. The contrast was even more striking between Moscow's treatment of the Gorbachev-Kohl meeting and its description of the meeting 10 days earlier between Foreign Minister Gromyko and West German Foreign Minister Genscher during his 4 March visit to Moscow. The latter report cited Gromyko as calling for an end to U.S. missile deployments in West Germany and warning Bonn that its cooperation with the United States in strategic defense research would lead the USSR to regard it as an 23 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 \"accomplice in the violation of the treaty on antiballistic missile defense.\" The TASS account of Gorbachev's remarks to Kohl failed to mention either the strategic defense issue or U.S. missile deployments in the FRG. TASS added, however, that the Soviet side emphasized that the \"decisive\" element in Moscow's posture toward Bonn was West German policy on matters concerning the \"security interests\" of the USSR and its allies. ? Although Soviet leaders have referred sporadically to West German \"revan- chism\" in their speeches over the last 10 months, the TASS account of Gorbachev's talks with Chancellor Kohl made no mention of this subject. This was in line with the official Soviet pronouncements on other leadership- level exchanges with the West Germans since last spring, when the \"revanchism\" campaign got under way. However, judging by the communi- que issued after East German Foreign Minister Fischer's 19-20 March visit to Moscow, the Soviet Union is still determined to impress on its East European allies-and particularly East Germany-its concern over the contacts with Bonn. The communique pointedly noted that the Soviet Union, the GDR, and \"all the fraternal socialist states\" are determined to deal the \"most resolute rebuff\" to \"manifestations of revanchism\" in West Germany. Japan: Evidence of Strains Predominates Moscow's account of Gorbachev's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the first between a Japanese prime minister and a Soviet general secretary since 1973, provided no evidence that Gorbachev is more flexible than his predecessors about the longstanding substantive differences between Moscow and Tokyo. Gorbachev's reception of Nakasone on 14 March represents an elevation in Soviet treatment of Japanese delegations compared with the previous two successions. In 1982 then Prime Minister Suzuki attended Brezhnev's funeral but was not received by any Soviet leader, although Gromyko received then Japanese Foreign Minister Sakurauchi. In 1984 Gromyko met with Foreign Minister Abe, who led the Japanese delegation to the Andropov funeral. Despite the change in the level of the meeting, it is not clear that the Soviets were eager to raise bilateral contacts to the top level. According to Japanese press reports citing Nakasone himself, Moscow agreed to the meeting only 24 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 General Secretary Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Gromyko together with Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone at 13 March reception. (Soviet television, 13 March 1985) after the Japanese prime minister refused to meet with Prime Minister Tikhonov, as the Soviet Foreign Ministry proposed, and threatened to go home without meeting any Soviet leader unless Gorbachev received him. The authoritative TASS report on the Gorbachev-Nakasone meeting suggests that Moscow is maintaining its critical, inflexible position on Soviet-Japanese relations. The report, one of the sternest of the many TASS reports on Gorbachev's,meetings with foreign visitors, indicated that the Soviet side had dismissed Nakasone's expression of good will toward the Soviet Union and \"stressed\" that Japan was \"artificially\" creating \"difficulties and limitations\" in bilateral relations. \"Japan's pursuit of a peace-loving policy in practice would undoubtedly be conducive to improving relations and good-neighborli- ness,\" the Soviet side was reported to have added. This year's TASS report was similar in tone to that of the TASS report at the time of Gromyko's meeting with Abe at the Andropov funeral. That report had said the Soviet side had expressed regret that there was \"no sign\" of Japa- nese readiness to reciprocate a Soviet desire for relations of \"good-neighborli- ness and cooperation.\" 25 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 East Europe: Positive Image Projected Gorbachev moved swiftly to underscore ties with Moscow's East European allies and to encourage cordial relations with Yugoslavia. His meeting with Warsaw Pact leaders on 13 March was portrayed as more substantive than a similar gathering following Andropov's funeral in 1984. The TASS report on the meeting, which it said took place in an atmosphere of \"cordiality and un- animity,\" indicated that many domestic and international topics were dis- cussed and that participants expressed determination to improve cooperation. They also emphasized a need to \"strengthen unity and cohesion\" and \"step up coordination of action in the international arena.\" By contrast, the report on the 1984 meeting noted only a \"cordial, fraternal\" atmosphere and said nothing about the content of the discussion. Warsaw Pact Most congratulatory messages to Gorbachev from Countries Warsaw Pact countries did not differ significantly from comparable messages sent to his predecessors, but those from the GDR and Poland were notable: ? Possibly in an effort to dispel tensions that arose last year when GDR party chief Honecker canceled a visit to the FRG under Soviet pressure, Honecker departed from past protocol to assure Gorbachev that the GDR is Moscow's \"loyal\" and \"reliable\" ally and a \"firm member\" of the socialist community. No such assurances were included in Honecker's messages to Chernenko a year ago and to Andropov in November 1982. ? The message from Polish leaders Jaruzelski and Jablonski assured the new Soviet leader that the Polish party and government would \"do everything possible to increase Poland's contribution to our joint cause\"-a statement that could be taken as a response to complaints in recent years that Poland was not fulfilling its CEMA obligations. Perhaps acknowledging Gorba- chev's relative lack of experience, the message omitted a statement con- tained in messages to Andropov and Chernenko that those leaders \"under- stood Poland's problems.\" East European media comment on the succession revealed differing views on the new Soviet leader: ? A Prague radio commentary on the 17th seemed to reflect apprehension in its defensive insistence that Soviet domestic and foreign policy would not 26 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 change under Gorbachev and that Western conjectures on this score were \"only wishful thinking.\" ? By contrast, effusive Hungarian comment seemed to reflect relish for the prospect of change. An article in the trade union daily Nepszava on 12 March described at length what it claimed was Gorbachev's \"expert\" interest in new Hungarian agricultural and industrial methods during a 1983 visit. The party paper Nepszabadsag on the 16th, in a dispatch from a Moscow correspondent entitled \"Continuity and Dynamism,\" portrayed Gorbachev as having energy, aptitude, and \"composure and openness\" and described his speeches as presaging a \"needed decisive change\" in the Soviet economy. Yugoslavia Gorbachev's apparent desire to improve relations with the Yugoslavs was underlined by a 12 March Belgrade radio report that he had personally telephoned the Yugoslav delegation that day to express thanks for their attendance at the funeral and for their condolences. Soviet and Yugoslav reports on the delegation's meeting with Gorbachev on the 13th noted a cordial and friendly atmosphere and the readiness of both countries to promote further all-round cooperation. The Tanjug account of the talks reported that \"both sides stressed that Yugoslav-Soviet relations are developing successfully based on the principles of the Belgrade Declaration of 1955 and the Moscow Statement of 1956, which were also confirmed in subsequent joint Yugoslav-Soviet documents at meetings at the highest level.\" Moscow, as on past occasions, avoided reference to the specific agreements, with TASS noting only that cooperation between the two countries and two parties would be based on \"joint documents and accords.\" TASS also omitted the information, supplied by Tanjug, that Gorbachev had accepted an invitation to visit Belgrade and extended a similar invitation to the Yugoslav leadership to visit the Soviet Union. No meeting between Chernenko and the Yugoslav delegation was reported a year ago, although Andropov had met with the Yugoslavs at the time of Brezhnev's funeral. The descriptions of the atmosphere of the 1982 meeting were similar to the present one, although the reports on the meeting were much shorter. The Yugoslav message to Gorbachev appeared to reflect a warmer climate than at the time of the previous successions. Yugoslav party leader Sukrija's message implied that bilateral relations were good by voicing the \"conviction\" 27 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 that ties would \"continue to develop successfully.\" Yugoslav messages in 1984 and 1982, by contrast, had expressed Belgrade's readiness to improve relations. Yugoslav media comment on Gorbachev was less restrained than that following the accessions of Andropov and Chernenko. Stressing that Gorba- chev's work style differs from that of his two predecessors, Tanjug's Moscow correspondent on the 17th said that the new Soviet leader's initial speeches and meetings with foreign visitors showed him to be a \"modern-concept politician.\" The daily Politika on the 13th enthused that Gorbachev has a \"statesman's personality\" marked by \"resoluteness, clarity, and authority.\" Albania Following past practice, Albania briefly reported with- out comment the death of ~ Chernenko and election of Gorbachev. Presumably to project an image of Soviet collusion with the United States, however, Tirana radio on the 14th reported that \"the Kremlin's new boss, Mikhail Gorbachev,\" met with Vice President Bush. In 1982 Tirana waited almost a month to comment on Andropov's rise to pow- er. A 7 December article in the Albanian party paper declared that Albania had no relations with Khrushchev or Brezhnev and would have none with Andropov \"or anyone else who might come to lead the revisionist Soviet Union.\" Gorbachev gave special attention to Albania last year in a speech at an anniversary celebration in Sofia, published in Pravda on 10 September, in which he affirmed that the Soviet Union \"favors normalization of relations with the Peoples Socialist Republic of Albania.\" Although his statement reflected official Soviet policy, he was breaking with convention by raising the issue explicitly. No ' other 'Soviet leader has directly discussed the question of relations with Albania since Brezhnev, in a speech to a 25 October 1976 CPSU plenum, affirmed that the Soviet Union was prepared to restore relations with Albania. Tirana is not known to have commented on Gorba- chev's remark at the time. China: Ground Prepared for Fundamental Change The Soviet succession, provided the stage for a historic drama in Sino-Soviet relations, as.

While both sides unmistakably signaled their desire to accelerate the.pace of improving ties, it is not yet clear whether these important symbolic actions presage fundamental changes in relations.

Any radical change in doctrine or relations may provoke controversy and opposition in either party. Moscow Gorbachev set forth policy on China with a simple declaration in his 11 March CPSU plenum address: \"We would like a serious improvement in relations with the PRC and consider that, given reciprocity, this is fully possible.\" He underlined his apparent seriousness three days later when he met with Chinese delegation head Vice Premier Li Peng. It was the first such meeting between a Soviet general secretary and a Chinese official since Brezhnev met with Zhou Enlai in November 1964, when the Chinese premier came to Moscow following the ouster of Khrushchev to explore the possibility of overcoming differences with Moscow., Gorbachev's formulation of policy toward China was more positive than any used by Chernenko during his tenure as general secretary. While Chernenko had expressed hope for improved relations, his statements tended to be linked with criticism of the Chinese or qualified with assertions that the interests of \"third countries\" could not be prejudiced. Gorbachev avoided such a link, but did reflect similar concerns in his conversation with the Vietnamese delegation to the funeral on 14 March. In an implicit reference to China, reported by So- viet media, he offered support to Vietnam's struggle against \"the intrigues of imperialism and those who abet it.\" (Emphasis added) Pravda gave the authoritative TASS report on the 14 March Gorbachev-Li Peng meeting the prominent treatment that accorded with such a significant meeting and with an effort to improve relations. It published the report of the meeting on page one together with reports on meetings with such Soviet friends and allies as Mongolia, Vietnam, Laos, Afghanistan, Angola, South Yemen, and Mozambique. The report on Aliyev's meeting with Wan Li in February 1984 appeared on page two of Pravda between reports on leadership meetings with the delegations from Malta and Japan. The report on Gromy- ko's meeting with Huang Hua in November 1982 was on page four, isolated from other reports on bilateral meetings. Beijing sent State Councillor and Foreign Minister Huang Hua to Brezhnev's funeral in 1982, and he was received by his counterpart, Gromyko. To represent China at Andropov's fu- neral in 1984, Beijing sent Vice Premier and Politburo member Wan Li, a leader of state rank equivalent to Huang Hua but of considerably greater political stature. Wan received less favorable treatment, however, meeting with Geydar Aliyev, who held comparable government and party posts but was lower in stature than Gromyko. 30 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY The TASS report on the Gorbachev-Li Peng talks indicated that the general secretary had reiterated his plenum formulation on relations. Otherwise, the report followed the pattern of accounts of Sino-Soviet meetings in 1982 and 1984, conveying little of the substance of the meeting beyond noting that the Chinese side had also expressed an interest in improving relations. Four days later, however, Pravda printed excerpts of a much warmer Chinese report. Not only did Pravda note that Li had \"agreed with the statement made by Comrade Gorbachev\" at the CPSU plenum about the desirability of improving relations, but it recorded the key Chinese statements that reflected Beijing's willingness to grant the Soviet Union socialist status and to communicate informally between party leaders. Citing the Chinese party paper Renmin Ribao, Pravda reported that Li Peng had conveyed congratula- tions to Gorbachev from Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang, had referred to the Soviet Union as a \"socialist\" country, and had \"stressed\" that China was prepared to assist the further development of relations in the \"political\" as well as other spheres. Moscow may see China's gestures in this regard as responding to Soviet sensitivities expressed late last year in an article written under pseudonyms as- sociated with the USSR Foreign Ministry. Appearing in the prominent foreign policy journal Mezhdunarodnaya Zhizn (International fairs) under the names \"I. Alekseyev\" and \"F. Nikolayev,\" the article chided Beijing for refusing to recognize the USSR as \"socialist.\" By publishing the markedly different accounts of the meeting without further explanation, Moscow reinforced a public appearance of uncertainty about China policy: Earlier, Pravda and Izvestiya had omitted Gorbachev's state- ment on China in their otherwise thorough reviews of his plenum address in their 13 March editorials. Pravda included a reference to the \"authoritative statement\" at the plenum calling for better relations in its followup editorial three days later, but the formulation was not cited in similar editorial reviews of the speech in Izvestiya on the same day or in the military daily Krasnaya Zvezda on the 15th, 16th, and 21st or in the Russian republic paper Sovetskaya Rossiya on the 15th. Despite these mixed signals, there are tentative signs of central direction to Soviet media to soften their treatment of China-a tactic employed on many occasions by Moscow in the past to encourage an improved atmosphere in re- lations. There has been little critical comment on China, and the TASS 31 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY report on U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Michael Armacost's 17-19 March visit to China failed to mention that Sino-Soviet relations were discussed. Moscow also encouraged the impression that efforts on normalization would continue to move forward, reporting on such bilateral contacts as Gromyko's 22 March meeting with the Chinese ambassador, First Deputy Premier Ivan Arkhipov's meeting on 21 March with a Chinese economic official and on the 26th with the Chinese ambassador, and First Vice President Vasiliy Kuznet- sov's meeting on 12 March with a Chinese parliamentary delegation. Accord- ing to a Soviet television news report on Gromyko's reception of the PRC am- bassador, both sides expressed an interest in normalization, and the Soviet side again \"drew attention\" to Gorbachev's plenum statement on relations. In addition, a Soviet expert on China, Lev Delyusin, in an interview with the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun, published on 23 March, encouraged the restoration of CPSU-CPC relations. Delyusin said he did not think the issue could be \"solved right away,\" but he noted that the Gorbachev-Li Peng meeting showed that party leaders on both sides were \"concerned about the development of friendly, comradely\" party relations and that it did not make sense for relations between \"two socialist countries\" to improve while their party relations remained frozen. Background There is nothing in Gorbachev's record of public statements on China that anticipated his initiative to meet with Li Peng or that might have prompted Beijing's effusive response. He is not known to have ever made a public statement on relations with China. The few statements in which he mentioned China were delivered at formal party occasions abroad-such as the Vietnamese Communist Party congress in March 1982-and offered only conventional Soviet criticism of Chinese policies. Judging by published reports, he said nothing about China in his RSFSR Supreme Soviet election speech last month. Despite the meager Gorbachev record on the China question, his apparent ties with Andropov and Gromyko associate him with a perspective that has given more priority to improving relations than did Chernenko. Different approach- es to the China issue may explain some of the twists and turns in Soviet policy and behavior since Brezhnev's call in March 1982 for improved relations and his affirmation that China had a \"socialist system\": ? Polemical attacks on China were dropped from Soviet media in September 1982 shortly before Brezhnev's death that November, and Andropov 32 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 reaffirmed Moscow's interest in better relations with China in a plenum speech 10 days after becoming general secretary. Andropov referred to China as \"our great neighbor\" and said that the USSR pays \"great attention to every positive response\" to Soviet efforts to \"overcome the inertia of prejudices.\" The November 1982 speech did not criticize China, and all Soviet leaders refrained from direct polemical attacks on Beijing during Andropov's tenure, although Soviet media did resume lower level criticism by the end of 1983-at a time when Andropov's terminal illness may have reduced his influence. ? Chernenko was less positive than Andropov in his first public remarks on China after becoming general secretary in February 1984. In his 2 March USSR Supreme Soviet election speech, he affirmed an interest in improving relations but noted that \"differences on a number of questions of principle\" remain and ruled out any agreements that would \"prejudice the interests of third countries.\" Moreover, while stating that \"the Soviet Union stands for the level of contacts being raised,\" he added that this should take place \"to the extent acceptable to both sides.\" ? By April 1984 low-level criticism of China was becoming more serious, and on 4 May Moscow released an authoritative TASS statement excoriating Chinese \"military provocations\" on the Sino-Vietnamese border. ? An effort at higher level contacts was aborted in May, when Moscow postponed a scheduled visit to Beijing of First Deputy Premier Arkhipov-a move seemingly designed to demonstrate displeasure with Chinese policies toward Indochina and the United States. ? In June Chernenko publicly attacked Chinese policy in Southeast Asia during visits by Vietnamese and Lao party leaders, condemning Beijing in stronger terms than had been used by any Soviet leader since October 1982. ? By the fall of 1984 Soviet media had toned down their attacks on China, al- though criticism still appeared in scholarly journals. ? Chernenko was also milder in his rhetoric in remarks during a visit of a Mongolian delegation in October. In his first comment on China since June, using the most positive language that he employed during his tenure as general secretary, he stressed the importance of normalization of relations 33 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 and asserted that \"we always keep open the door to constructive talks with China.\" His only criticism of China was implied when he stressed that socialist countries must \"hold clear-cut class positions in international affairs.\" ? Gromyko, who has a consistent record of temperate formulations on China in recent years, was even more positive in his 6 November address marking the anniversary of the October Revolution. He stated that the Soviet Union's commitment to \"normalizing and improving\" relations with China \"has repeatedly been confirmed by us, even at the very highest level,\" and added that \"we consider a continuation of contacts between representatives of the two countries useful and important.\" ? In December the Arkhipov visit to Beijing was revived amid signs that Beijing was attempting to mollify Moscow on issues that had led to postponement of the visit the previous spring. Both Beijing and Hanoi renewed publicity for clashes on the Sino-Vietnamese border as Vietnam's dry season offensive in Cambodia began, but the level of Beijing's protests was distinctly lower and their tone more restrained than they had been the previous April. While Arkhipov was in Beijing in late December, Beijing conspicuously avoided previously routine denunciations of Moscow on the anniversary of Moscow's intervention in Afghanistan, marking the occasion only in early January. ? From late January to mid-February 1985, Soviet media increased criticism of China in the wake of the visit to the PRC of Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General Vessey. Much of the Soviet criticism was pegged to a Kabul protest about alleged Chinese involvement in the Afghan conflict. A 14 February article in Izvestiya by \"I. Alekseyev\" also complained about the \"ambiguous\" Chinese leadership approach to the Soviet Union. It noted that Beijing had \"verbally\" declared its desire to normalize relations and allowed limited progress but was raising preconditions, had undertaken action \"harmful to the interests of world socialism,\" and was even posing a \"threat to the security of socialist states.\" The article advocated bilateral dialogue and normalization of relations and observed: \"We would like to believe that common sense and a correct understanding of the Chinese people's interests will sooner or later gain the upper hand in Beijing.\" ? The last speech attributed to Chernenko-a 22 February USSR Supreme Soviet election address that was read for him because he was too ill to ap- pear-was positive about the need for normalization of relations and noted 34 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 there should be \"efforts by both sides,\" but again pointed to \"serious political differences\" dividing Moscow and Beijing. Beijing In marking Chernenko's death and welcoming Gorba- chev's succession, Beijing violated strictures against confusing party and state relations with Moscow that it had scrupulously observed for nearly two decades. Taken together, these departures from precedents and practices rigidly observed in the past appear intended to convey dramatically a new Chinese assessment of the potential for fundamen- tal change in Sino-Soviet ties: ? Beijing extended congratulations to Gorbachev on his succession as CPSU general secretary. The congratulations were extended not only by a Foreign Ministry spokesman on 12 March, according to Xinhua that day, but also personally by several Chinese leaders. As recorded by Xinhua, these include National People's Congress (NPC) Chairman Peng Zhen in his condolence call at the Soviet Embassy in Beijing on the 12th, Vice Premier Li Peng di- rectly to Gorbachev in Moscow, and CPC General Secretary Hu Yaobang, as conveyed to Gorbachev by Li Peng. At the time of Andropov's and Chernenko's successions, Beijing observed constraints in place since the break in CPC-CPSU ties in 1967 and did not extend congratulations of any sort-either from party or state spokesmen. ? On meeting Gorbachev at the reception for foreign delegations attending Chernenko's funeral on the 13th, according to Xinhua the same day, Li Peng wished the USSR well in \"socialist construction.\" In his meeting with Gorbachev the next day, by Xinhua's account, Li described China and the USSR as \"great neighbors and socialist countries.\" These references to the \"socialist\" character of the Soviet Union are the first in authoritative Chinese public statements in at least 18 years. The closest Beijing had come to such an acknowledgment appeared in Xinhua's account of CPC Politburo Standing Committee member Chen Yun's meeting with Soviet Deputy Premier Arkhipov last December, in which Chen observed that China and the USSR \"practice economic planning and are neighbors.\" ? In his meeting with Gorbachev on the 14th, Li expressed Beijing's readiness to improve relations in the \"political\" sphere as well as in the economic, technical, and cultural fields. Although Beijing has routinely in the past three years indicated a readiness to improve cooperation in these latter 35 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Li Peng meeting Gorbachev and Gromyko in the Kremlin on 13 March. (Renmin Ribao, 15 March 1985). fields, it has not previously done so in the \"political\" arena. The closest it has come to doing so also emerged from Arkhipov's visit to China last December, when, according to Xinhua, Premier Zhao Ziyang suggested that \"problems in the political relations\" between the PRC and USSR should \"not be difficult to solve\" if both sides took the same \"positive\" ap- proach that they have adopted in cooperation in other areas. In reporting Peng Zhen's call at the Soviet Embassy on the 12th, Xinhua's English-language report cited the Soviet ambassador's expression of grati- tude for Chinese congratulations to \"Comrade\" Gorbachev. Reports on the same event by Beijing radio and by Xinhua's Chinese service, as published in Renmin Ribao, went even further, citing Peng Zhen himself as extending congratulations to \"Comrade\" Gorbachev. Since the break in party ties, PRC media ordinarily have shunned reference to Soviet leaders as \"comra- des,\" regardless of the speaker. The only known exception again emerged from Arkhipov's visit to Beijing last December, when Chinese media repeatedly cited Chinese leaders calling Arkhipov \"comrade.\" Judging by the context in which they were made, these references appear intended to convey Beijing's gratitude for Arkhipov's contributions to the PRC's development as supervisor of Soviet aid to China during the heyday of Sino- Soviet cooperation in the 1950's. 36 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 ? The condolence message sent by President Li Xiannian and Peng Zhen on behalf of the NPC on the 11th, Peng Zhen's remarks in his call at the Soviet Embassy and comments by the Foreign Ministry spokesman on the 11th and 12th, as reported by Xinhua, all praised Chernenko for his work as an \"outstanding\" and \"supreme leader\" of both the Soviet party and state. By contrast, comparable authoritative statements had called Brezhnev \"an outstanding statesman of the Soviet Union\" and Andropov \"supreme leader of the Soviet Union.\" ? The party newspaper Renmin Ribao on the 12th carried on its front page pictures of both Chernenko and Gorbachev together with Xinhua's reports on the condolence message sent by Li Xiannian and Peng Zhen and on the CPSU plenum that elected Gorbachev. NPC condolences on Brezhnev's and Andropov's deaths and Xinhua reports on Andropov's and Chernenko's successions were also carried on Renmin Ribao's front page, but there were no pictures. Chernenko's picture was also framed in black-treatment that the Chinese press normally reserves only for the CPC's own leaders and for leaders of ruling foreign communist parties. Other Gestures These departures from longstanding practice indicate that China has begun to apply to the Soviet Union some of the protocol trappings it ordinarily confers on socialist countries, but other signs suggest that it has not yet resumed party links with the CPSU. Li Xiannian and Peng Zhen's condolence message, for example, was sent only in the name of the NPC to the USSR Supreme Soviet and not also in the name of the CPC Central Committee, as was the practice before 1967. Chinese media also were scrupulous about referring to Li Peng as head of a Chinese government delegation. The PRC-owned Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao on 16 March cited a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment, not reported in PRC media, that Hu's greetings to Gorbachev as conveyed by Li do not mean that CPC-CPSU relations have been formally resumed. The highly suggestive changes in Chinese practice do, however, appear designed to convey to Moscow the potential for fundamental change in Sino- Soviet ties. The gestures were complemented by other Chinese signals in the same direction. At no time in statements and comment on the Soviet leadership succession did Beijing raise the three \"obstacles\" that it long has insisted block fundamental change in bilateral relations-Moscow's military buildup along the Soviet and Mongolian border with China, the Soviet 37 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 .AnRR=X54 api x NA?Em~gR+xfX qi' a# k}XEQ RZP n ~Nfl fAeX.A siaxn}REE.A 71N amiAnnanen F7 ieiF}a-4f... i:nxntomu`-m -~ fl.MtanR?mW ii.....%a.W RYW.@wa., imXRt .tf. x..? ?ea ;a tttt~a ~ af.l. t -.....w...Y RaltFa. ?t t.a.Y@4xn;!

By contrast, Xinhua cited Vice Premier Wan Li raising them in his meeting with Soviet Deputy Premier Aliyev after attending Andropov's funeral last year. Beijing's choice of leaders to attend the funeral in Moscow and to convey con- dolences at the Soviet Embassy in Beijing seems calculated to convey a cautiously positive message. In terms of state rank-which in view of the gap in party relations is the only protocol strictly appropriate-both choices were marginally lower in level than the leaders chosen when Andropov died.' However, in both cases Beijing may have had reason to believe that the Soviets would be pleased with the selection: ? Although Li is marginally outranked by Wan Li in state protocol and vastly in terms of party level (Wan is a full Politburo member, Li is not), his selec- tion is important symbolically in terms of his youth and education. Li was promoted to vice premier as part of Deng Xiaoping's reform effort to invigorate the Chinese party and state apparatus with a successor generation of leaders competent technically and administratively to guide PRC modern- ization. In his early 50's, Li is of the same generation as Gorbachev. Li, ac- cording to the biography Xinhua publicized when he was promoted in 1982, was also educated in the Soviet Union and presumably speaks Russian. ? Although marginally outranked by Ulanhu in state protocol, Peng Zhen far outranks Ulanhu in party stature. Peng is normally listed among the four veteran Politburo members named after the Politburo Standing Committee members and ahead of the rest of the Politburo members. Ulanhu falls among the latter. Judging by his public statements-during Arkhipov's China visit, for example-Peng may also be more flexible in his views on Sino-Soviet relations than others in the Chinese leadership. Implications Beijing's readiness to treat the USSR as a socialist country effectively overthrows two decades of pessi- mistic media assessments about the potential for positive change in Soviet state and society. The traditional Maoist critique of Soviet \"revisionism\" (Beijing's term for Moscow's abandonment of class struggle in both the foreign 6 Li Peng and Wan Li are both vice premiers of the State Council, but Wan Li as a veteran is always named ahead of Li in lists of public appearances by state leaders. Similarly, Peng Zhen as NPC chairman ordinarily follows PRC Vice President Ulanhu-who led the leaders paying respects at the Soviet Embassy on Andropov's death last year-in name lists following strict state protocol. 39 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 and domestic spheres under Khrushchev) and its pursuit of \"social-imperia- lism\" (the harnessing of the resources of a society organized formally along so- cialist lines to pursue imperialist aggression externally) saw little possibility of fundamental change because Soviet leadership policies drew on attitudes embedded in Soviet society itself and on predilections deeply rooted in Russia's tsarist past. Soviet leaderships could come and go, according to this critique, but there was little prospect of fundamental changes in policy. Public acknowledgment of the \"socialist\" character of the USSR implies, conversely, that Soviet policies can change for the better, particularly when the Soviet leadership chooses to do so. By the same token, the revised placement of the USSR in Beijing's political taxonomy introduces a deep cleavage in the foundations of China's foreign policy, which long has included the principle that a socialist country cannot also be \"hegemonist.\" As Deng Xiaoping moved in recent years to dismantle Mao's ideological legacy on China's domestic scene, he attempted to remove the same ideologi- cal constraints from PRC foreign policy, and particularly as applied to the USSR, while still upholding Mao's anti-Sovietism. From this process of demaoification emerged a new body of ideological principles that Beijing has used to distinguish real socialist parties and states from false ones. In recent years Beijing's rare public analyses of the origins of Soviet foreign policy have reaffirmed the pessimism of the Maoist critique on prospects for change. The traditional Maoist critique of Soviet \"revisionism\" was aban- doned not because of a changed attitude toward the USSR, but clearly because of Beijing's reassessment of the role of class struggle under socialism in its own domestic context. In its place there emerged a Dengist critique of Soviet social imperialism based on an analysis of Soviet \"hegemonism.\" These changes are recorded in the CPC's most authoritative documents. The landmark resolution on party history adopted by the Central Committee in 1981, for example, reaffirmed China's \"just struggle\" against Soviet \"big- nation chauvinism\" in the 1950's and 1960's, the formulation of the \"correct strategy\" of the \"three worlds theory,\" and the PRC's pursuit of \"genuine in- ternationalism,\" and not hegemonism, as \"indelible contributions\" of Mao Zedong and the party leadership. The prevailing CPC constitution, adopted at the party congress in 1982, formally enjoins the party to unite with all progressive parties and groups in the world on the basis of proletarian internationalism in the \"common struggle\" against hegemonism. 40 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90T01298R000200290001-1 Approved For Release 2010/03/29: CIA-RDP90TO1298R000200290001-1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Although Beijing since Mao's death has moved gradually to reestablish ties with foreign communist parties, it has done so on the basis of a series of four principles that together, according to Beijing comment, advance its struggle against Soviet hegemonism. These four principles are mutual respect, equality, independence, and noninterference in the internal affairs of other parties. As Beijing has articulated and applied them in resuming ties with parties it once dismissed as revisionist-as in Yugoslavia and West Europe-or in exploring the possibility of ties with those it formerly regarded as Soviet pawns-as in East Europe-the emphasis has been to encourage independence from Mos- cow and its \"hegemonic\" ambitions within the international communist movement. As applied to the CPSU itself, the new critique of Soviet hegemonism-and the four principles Beijing has enunciated on that basis for interparty ties- has provided the foundation for continued explicit criticism. On the basis of the four principles, Beijing says it is no longer appropriate for China to criticize Soviet domestic policies, but asserts that it remains obliged to criticize Soviet hegemonism in the international communist movement and in international affairs generally. Hu Yaobang was cited by Xinhua in 1983, for example, dismissing the CPSU's claim to being a socialist party in view of Moscow's pursuit of hegemonism in Afghanistan, citing Lenin's observation that a proletariat that inflicts the slightest degree of coercion on another nation cannot be a \"socialist proletariat.\" With respect to state relations, Soviet hegemonism as a \"difference in principle\" between the two countries is embodied in the \"three obstacles\" that Beijing asserts impede full Sino-Soviet normalization. Beijing's recent public treatment of the USSR as a socialist country, therefore, appears to be fundamentally inconsistent with the ideological framework of its appr"
