It is wide enough to cover sites, ideas, practices and objects. The Lao word is therefore a concrete, count noun unlike the English abstract noun. Where possible, the translators have translated this term in the singular form as “heritage” without further qualification but in some places it has been necessary to add a qualifier such as [items] or [locations] to make sense of the text. Readers should, in any event, always note that the Lao word has a different semantic and grammatical structure from its English counterpart. 3 The literal translation is “identifying”.\n\n1\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nNational heritage includes items existing in the country and abroad.\n\nArticle 3.

Cultural Heritage in Intangible Items\n\n7 Readers may wish to refer to the Law on Lao Nationality for the distinction between aliens, apatrids (i.e. persons unable to certify their nationality) and foreign individuals.\n\n8 These are two specific examples of weave patterns, which are listed in the law. The spelling of many of these transliterations of Lao words can vary. The translators have adopted the English translations used by the Lao Tourism Organisation where these are available. In other cases, the translators have attempted to provide transliterations that are as close to the Lao word as possible.\n\n9 In Lao, using three dots in punctuation implies “etc.” or “and others”.\n\n4\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe cultural heritage in intangible items refers to [items of] intangible heritage which are of high outstanding value from a cultural point of view, such as: local innovation, knowledge, public philosophies, beliefs, fine traditions which are expressed in livelihood practices, social behaviour, languages, alphabets, numbers, scripts10, legends, novels, proverbs, poems, traditional music, traditional dances, songs, melodies, folk songs, formulas of traditional medicine and others which are inherited from generation to generation.\n\nChapter 2 Historical Heritage\n\nArticle 10.

Inscriptions may be on physical objects (e.g., in caves or on rocks).\n\n11 The three dots at the end of the sentence implies “etc.” or “and others”.\n\n12 The Lao term connotes non-physical, mental, conscious and spiritual.\n\n13 The literal translation is “brave fight without surrender”.\n\n5\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nCultural and historical heritage at the national level refers to [items of] heritage which are of outstanding national value located in any area of the Lao PDR, and which have become the heritage of the national community, such as: That Luang, Wat Xieng Thong, Viengxay district, Lumvong dances, Seosavath and Sang Sinh Say novels, and others.\n\nArticle 19.

Administrative Regulations\n\nThe State centrally and uniformly administers the national cultural and historical heritage throughout the country, including those [items] in the representative offices of the Lao PDR abroad, by registering, and by dividing [responsibility for their] administration among sectors17 and local administrations18.\n\n15 The literal translation is “prosper”.\n\n16 The connotation of the Lao text is that these national icons should prosper or flourish as long as the country does.\n\n17 The term “sector” is used in many Lao laws to refer to the cluster of government ministries or agencies engaged in a particular activity.\n\n18 The same Lao term may be translated as both “local administrations” and “local administrative authorities”. The translators have generally applied the following convention: (i) if the term is used in a sentence in juxtaposition to a reference to some specific agency within the line ministries, the term has been translated as “local administrations”, referring only to the bodies responsible for local administration discussed in the Law on Local Administration; and (ii) if the term\n\n8\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe State protects the property [and] copyright [subsisting in items of] Lao national cultural and historical heritage which are outside the territory of the Lao PDR, which are in the illegitimate possession of other countries, or [in respect of which foreign countries have illegitimately asserted] copyright.\n\nArticle 28. Registration\n\n[Items of] national cultural and historical heritage which are possessed by individuals or organisations shall be registered.\n\nThe State conducts surveys, and collects the [items of] heritage to evaluate, classify and register [them], while encouraging possessors of heritage [items] to propose them for registration in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n1.

Maintenance, Restoration and Rehabilitation\n\nis used alone in a sentence, it has been translated as “local administrative authorities” to indicate that it may be wide enough to cover local administrations as well as local divisions, offices or units of line ministries. However, the reader should note the alternative meaning that may have been intended.\n\n9\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe State promotes individuals and organisations to participate in the maintenance, restoration and rehabilitation of the national cultural and historical heritage.\n\nThe maintenance, restoration and rehabilitation of [items of] national heritage shall be approved by the organisations with which they are registered.\n\nArticle 30.

New Creations\n\nIndividuals and organisations intending to create monuments or sculptures of their ancestors, leaders, [or] national heroes, shall obtain approval from the government.\n\nFor the creation of religious places, approval shall be obtained from the provincial governor or city mayor, in coordination with concerned authorities.\n\nFor the sculpting of Buddhas, [and] the sculpting of monuments of an individual’s ancestors, approval shall be obtained from the information and culture sector.\n\nArticle 32. Exhibition\n\nThere are three main types of exhibition of national heritage:\n\n• Exhibitions open to the public; • Exhibitions for the purpose of obtaining contributions for the\n\nprotection and restoration [of the national heritage]; • Exhibitions for commercial purpose.\n\nThe exhibition of national heritage may be conducted within the country or abroad.\n\nThe exhibition of national heritage within the country shall require the approval of the information and culture sector, after coordination with the concerned local administrations.\n\n10\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe exhibition of national heritage abroad shall require the approval of the government, by a proposal through the Ministry of Information and Culture.\n\nArticle 33. Seen and Discovered\n\nIndividuals or organisations that, during the conduct of any activities, see any national heritage shall immediately report to the local administrations and the concerned information and culture sector, and shall suspend such activities until approval for continuation is granted.\n\nIndividuals or organisations that have discovered sites, received information on existing sites, or suspect that any [item of] national heritage or holy relic exists, shall immediately report to the local administrations and the information and culture sector, and shall be prohibited from exploring them prior to obtaining the approval of the information and culture sector.\n\nArticle 34.

Export for Analysis\n\nThe export to other countries for analysis of parts or objects that are the national cultural and historical heritage that are of high value, shall require the approval of the government. For parts or objects that are other national heritage, approval from the Ministry of Information and Culture is required.\n\nArticle 36. Import, Display or Distribution\n\nThe importation, display or distribution of cultural products of other countries shall be examined and approved by the information and culture sector.\n\n19 The term “policies” is often used as an indirect way of referring to “incentives’ or “privileges”. In this context, it is unclear whether that use is intended or whether “policies” is being used in the sense of “strategies and measures of governance”.\n\n11\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nTangible cultural products of other countries, especially Buddhas, or intangible items that contradict the culture, [or] fine national traditions of Laos will not be permitted to be imported, displayed or distributed.\n\nArticle 37.

Purpose of Use\n\nThe use of national cultural and historical heritage has the following purposes:\n\n1. As the basis for national prosperity, as the driving force for social expansion, and for the development of a strong and wealthy nation;\n\n2. To educate citizens to love their nation, to be unified and proud of historical efforts, to be creative, to bravely struggle, and to be united as one with the multi-ethnic Lao people in the protection and development of the nation;\n\n20 The Lao word is a compound word: “buy-sell”.\n\n12\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\n3.

Administrative Agencies\n\nThe State centrally and uniformly administers the national heritage throughout the country by assigning tasks to the Ministry of Information and Culture as the focal point, in coordination with concerned sectors and with concerned local authorities.\n\nThe national heritage administrative agencies are divided into four levels as follows:\n\n1. The Ministry of Information and Culture; 2. The information and culture divisions at the provincial and city\n\nlevel; 3. The information and culture offices at the district and municipal\n\nlevel; 4. The village administrations.\n\nThe administration of [items of] Lao national heritage that have become world heritage or regional heritage shall be administered by special\n\n23 The literal term is “obligations”.\n\n24 The translators are aware that it is awkward to speak of “the first paragraph” of Article 60, which has only one paragraph (with several points, point 1 of which does not appear to set out any purpose). Instead, this reference in Article 61 appears to be a reference to the lead-in language at the start of Article 60.\n\n25 In the Lao language, the word roughly meaning “the entire organisation of responsible governmental agencies” is capable of being translated as any one of the following English words: “organisation”, “agency”, or “authority”. In choosing which English word to use, the translators have adopted the following convention. Where the governmental agencies in question have in practice adopted an English term for themselves (e.g., the Tax Authority), the translators have used that term. Otherwise, the translators have used the generic term “organisation” or, as in this law, “agency”.\n\n20\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\norganisations, such as: the committee for national heritage, the local heritage committees and the office of world heritage, the establishment and activities of which shall be separately regulated.\n\nArticle 63. Rights and Duties of the Ministry of Information and Culture\n\nIn the administration of the national heritage, the Ministry of Information and Culture shall have following main rights and duties:\n\n1. To conduct research, lay down policies and strategies, and issue legislation on the national heritage, in particular, on the cultural and historical heritage;\n\n2. To conduct surveys, gather data, analyse, [and] explore each type of national heritage;\n\n3. To disseminate and educate on the policy directives, laws and regulations relating to the national heritage;\n\n4. To supervise, encourage, monitor, [and] inspect the information and culture divisions in their implementation of laws, regulations, plans, [and] projects on the national heritage;\n\n5. To supervise, [and] encourage the offices of regional and world heritage in their implementation of laws, regulations, plans, and projects on regional and world heritage;\n\n6. To register and issue licenses relating to national heritage within its responsibility;\n\n7. To build up human resources relating to national heritage; 8.

To extend relations and cooperation with foreign countries and international organisations on activities relating to national heritage;\n\n10. To summarise reports and provide evaluations on the implementation of activities relating to national heritage to the government and Prime Minister;\n\n11. To exercise other rights and perform other duties as regulated by laws and regulations.\n\nArticle 64. Rights and Duties of the Information and Culture Divisions\n\nIn the administration of national heritage, each information and culture division at the provincial or city level shall have following main rights and duties:\n\n1. To elaborate on the laws, regulations, plans, [and] projects of the Ministry in its own regulations, plans, projects and implementation;\n\n26 This is a literal translation. The translators are aware that it is awkward to speak of “implementing national heritage”. It is possible that this is a reference to implementing “activities” regarding national heritage. A similar provision in Article 64(4) spells this out. However, this Article 63(8) does not contain the word “activities”.\n\n21\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\n2. To conduct surveys, [and] gather data on the national heritage within its area of responsibility;\n\n3. To disseminate [and] educate on the policy directives, laws and regulations on national heritage;\n\n4.

To summarise reports and provide evaluations on the implementation of activities relating to national heritage to its higher authority;\n\n8.

To exercise other rights and perform other duties as regulated by laws and regulations.\n\nArticle 66.

To inspect the implementation of plans, projects, laws and regulations relating to the administration of national heritage, including contracts and international conventions that the Lao PDR has signed and or to which it is a party;\n\n2. To inspect the resolution of proposals by individuals or organisations relating to national heritage;\n\n3. To exercise other rights and perform other duties as stipulated by laws and regulations.\n\nArticle 69. Types of Inspections\n\nThere are three types of inspections of national heritage:\n\n1. Regular systematic inspections, which are carried out based on the operational plan, on a regular basis and at a specified time;\n\n2. Inspections with advance notification, which are inspections outside the operational plan in the event of necessity and of which notice shall given in advance27 to the person inspected;\n\n3. Emergency inspections, which are emergency inspections without advance notice to the inspected person.\n\n27 The literal translation is “of which prior notice shall be given in advance”.\n\n23\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nPart IX Policies and Measures28\n\nArticle 70. Policies\n\nIndividuals or organisations with outstanding performance in the administration, protection, conservation, restoration and development of national heritage will receive awards and other appropriate policies.\n\nPersons who have seen, discovered, researched or given useful information on national heritage, in addition to receiving awards, will receive other benefits in accordance with the laws and regulations.\n\nArticle 71.
