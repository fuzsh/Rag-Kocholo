        "text": "The diverse and widely-spread nations of the South Pacific spent many of the post-war years under the continued rule of various colonial administrations. Whilst superficially the situation was \"back to normal\" after the defeat of the Japanese, in practice the Pacific War had changed the region forever. Much of Pasifika was exposed to modern industrial technology, goods and alternative methods of governance and organisation which disturbed the traditional tribal way of life of the indigenous peoples.\n\nOf the three major Pacific island subregions (Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia), Melanesia experienced the most turbulent post-war history. The Republic of South Maluku (Republik Maluku Selatan, RMS), supported by the West, won it's independence from Indonesia and aligned itself with the Oceanian Treaty Organisation (OTO), joining the collective security community in 1955, to the outrage of Indonesia and later Revolutionary Nusantara, which denounced the RMS as an \"ersatz national liberation movement cobbled together by a conspiracy of feudal rulers and international financial interests\". The South Moluccan economy largely revolves around the extraction of relatively high-value natural resource extraction: cloves and nutmeg, a cornerstone of the local economy since the colonial period (where the region was known as the 'Spice Islands'), continued to be extracted. Fishing, pearl diving and lobster harvesting also constitute significant sectors of the economy, along with logging of ironwood, teak and ebony for use in the production of luxury furniture. With a high proportion of military-trained males, well-known for their martial skill, South Maluku also earned notoriety as a significant source nation for mercenaries, serving throughout the Pasifika region and beyond.\n\nSelf-administration in West Papua, then known as Netherlands New Guinea, was first established in 1960, and incrementally expanded to include more duties until 1975, where West Papuan independence was dated to coincide with the independence of Papua New Guinea. Whilst there was some discussion about the possibility of uniting West Papua with Papua New Guinea, in practice such plans were not seriously pursued, largely as a result of divergences dating back to the colonial administration. In the years following Indonesian independence (and accelerating after the Communist seizure of power in Indonesia), the Dutch engaged in mass resettlement of Indos (people of mixed European and Indonesian, primarily Javan and Sundanese descent) in the West Papuan coastal regions. The relatively affluent and educated Indos rapidly dominated business and administrative life in the territory (also assimilating many ethnic Chinese). After independence, West Papua struggled to maintain a balance between the Indo-dominated commercial and bureaucratic spheres, and the Papuan-dominated military and political sectors. Whilst some progress has been made over time, this de facto social segregation has persisted, contrasting with the more cosmopolitan Papua New Guinea. West Papua maintained the constitutional monarchy after independence, retaining Queen Juliana of the Netherlands as Queen of West Papua.\n\nPapua New Guinea, the site of prolonged contention between the Japanese and Australian forces during WWII, remained under Australian administration until 1975. Whilst prospects for the maintenance of democracy appeared poor, Papua New Guinea surprised many commentators by dealing with political issues smoothly via the constitutional process. Part of this could be ascribed to the fact that political powerbases in the country were generally very small, and thus whilst the coalition governments which governed PNG were often shaky, there was no ability for any ambitious strongman to emerge and seize power. The biggest challenge to the fledgling nation was the unilateral declaration of independence of the island of Bougainville as the 'Republic of the North Solomons\" a mere five days before Papua New Guinea was scheduled to achieve full sovereignty. The secessionist sentiment on the island was motivated by both cultural and economic concerns. The local \"blackskins\" considered themselves distinct from the Papuan \"redskins\" and balked at the idea that their destiny should be chosen by these \"foreigners\". The Roman Catholic Church, the most powerful organisation in the islands, endorsed the separatist move. Furthermore, the Papuan government derived a significant chunk of their income from the Panguna open mine on Bougainville, operated by Australian company Conzinc Rio Tinto. The locals received less than 1% of the revenue from the mine, which also caused significant ecological damage. Many Bougainvilleans had also been displaced by mining prospecting activities. The Republic of North Solomons was unrecognised by Australia and Papua New Guinea, and the leader of the secessionist movement, John Momis, entered into negotiations with the Papua New Guinean government, securing an agreement where Bougainville would be granted significant autonomy. Nevertheless, tension regarding the operation of the Panguna mine would flare again in the late 1980s.\n\nThe Panguna mine, source of the Bougainville conflicts​\n\nIn the Solomon Islands, local councils were established in the 1950s as a step towards eventual self-rule. By 1970 a constitution was introduced and elections were held. This constitution was contested and a new, more popular constitution was adopted in 1974. Full self-government was granted by the British in 1976, with independence following in 1978, although the British monarchy was retained.\n\nThe political landscape of the New Hebrides underwent a seismic shift after WWII. The experience of industrial goods and the stationing of American forces, as well as their (from the local perspective) rapid departure prompted the development of 'cargo cults', largely revolving around a messianic \"John Frum\" figure who would supposedly return and bring prosperity to the islanders. These cargo cults often developed into political movements, espousing 'self-help' philosophies and communal cooperation. Many of these movements sought the end of colonial rule, as the British and French had, in the natives' eyes, proved incapable of bringing the kind of prosperity that \"John Frum\" would bring. Whilst Britain sought to decolonise entirely after WWII, the French were more pugnacious in their desire to retain the New Hebrides as a colonial possession, largely due to fears that Hebridean independence would encourage agitation by New Caledonian natives, where a greater French settler population existed. The first political party in the country was established in the early 1970s, the New Hebrides National Party. Renamed the Vanua'aku Party in 1974, the party pushed for independence. In 1974, the Vanua'aku Party dispossessed foreign land and asset owners, who were compensated financially. Two rebellions occurred in the prelude to Hebridean independence, in Tanna and Espiritu Santo. Tanna had sought independence in 1974 as the Nation of Tanna, but was suppressed by the Anglo-French authorities. In 1980, there was another attempt at secession, with the declaration of the Tafea Nation, it's name derived from the initials of the five islands it sought to incorporate (Tanna, Aniwa, Futuna, Erromango and Aneityum). This prompted a stand-off between British and French troops, the former of which had been sent to reinstate the authority of the government, whilst the latter was present to protect the fledgling Tafea Nation. Whilst there was no deaths in the standoff, French paratroopers fired warning shots, with the British Scotsguardsmen coming close to returning fire. Eventually, the British Colonial Office backed down, allowing Tafea to gain independence, but the British government, as well as the Australian and New Zealand governments, refused to recognise Tafea [161]. In May 1980, the Nagriamel movement, led by Jimmy Stevens, declared an independent Republic of Vemerana on Espiritu Santo, the largest island in the Hebridean archipelago. Stevens was backed by private French interests and the Phoenix Foundation, an organisation of American libertarian businessmen who sought to create a haven in the South Pacific territory. France recognised Vemeranese independence on June 3rd, and on June 5th Vemeranese tribal chiefs elected French ambassador Philippe Allonneau \"King of Vemerana\", whilst Jimmy Stevens became Prime Minister. The capital, Luganville, was renamed Allonneauopolis. The Port-Vila government, lacking an army, requested assistance from Papua New Guinea to repress the rebellion, but the Papuans refused after it became known that the French had stationed a small force of Garde Mobile on Espiritu Santo [162]. Recognition for Vemerana and Tafea was limited to each other and France. The New Hebrides, renamed Vanuatu, was granted independence on 7th July 1978, although British and French presence remained until the secession of Tafea and Vemerana led to the expulsion of French influence from the remainder of the islands, with British (and later Australian) troops based in the remaining islands as a countermeasure to French intrigues.\n\nNagriamel supporters, Vemerana​\n\nIn 1946, New Caledonia had become an overseas territory, with French citizenship extended to all New Caledonians, regardless of ethnicity, by 1953. The 1969-1972 nickel boom saw an influx of Europeans and Polynesians, reducing the Melanesian majority to a plurality. By this time, pro-independence forces were becoming more organised. The largest pro-independence group was the Caledonian Union (UC), which had shifted from an autonomist group to a full-fledged nationalist organisation by the mid-1970s. The more radical, Marxist wing of the independence movement was the Party of Kanak Liberation (Palika). French authorities proved hostile to the independence movement, but allowed the UC to campaign whilst the Palika organisation was driven underground [163].\n\nFiji's future was from the beginning uncertain. In the prelude to independence, Indo-Fijians, descendants of Indians brought to the islands to harvest sugar, began to outnumber the native Fijians. Fearful of being dominated under a democratic system, many of the native chiefs agitated for a continuation of British rule. The British refused to stay, and sought to establish a sustainable political equilibrium through the formation of a bicameral parliament, with the Senate dominated by Fijian chiefs, whilst the House of Representatives would be composed of popularly-elected politicians, with quotas for Indians, Fijians, Rotumans and other groups.\n\n---\n\n[161] IOTL the French gave less support, and as such there was not a military stand-off.\n\n[162] Similarly as in [161], although the French were in favour of Vemerana IOTL, they did not support them militarily. There were no French troops there IOTL, and the presence of Papuan troops dissuaded rebellion.\n\n[163] IOTL the Palika organisation was active, but was not banned.\n\nFor more information on Indochina, see https://www.alternatehistory.com/fo...rnative-cold-war.280530/page-17#post-10989768\n\nand\n\nhttps://www.alternatehistory.com/fo...rnative-cold-war.280530/page-17#post-10999005\n\n===\n\nHaving achieved regional dominance through military intervention in the neighbouring states of Laos and Kampuchea and the reunification of Vietnam, the Vietnamese Communists spent the 1970s consolidating their power, both internally and amongst their client states. This would eventually culminate in a controversial regional integration policy. Several critics, amongst them their nominal allies the Chinese, considered Vietnamese hegemony over Kampuchea and Laos to constitute 'social imperialism'. By contrast, the Vietnamese saw themselves as liberators, disestablishing 'feudalism' and acting as the 'vanguard' for the construction of socialism in Indochina. The local view of the Vietnamese presence was often more complicated.\n\nThe seizure of Cambodia and the toppling of the Lon Nol government was met with outrage by the American and Thai representatives at the United Nations. The Soviet and Congolese delegations defended the Vietnamese particularly vigorously, although the Chinese were conspicuously silent on the issue. Whilst Vietnamese aggression towards Cambodia was clearly blatant expansionism, criticism was largely silenced with the return of Prince Norodom Sihanouk to his country. Sihanouk denounced Lon Nol and his rightist allies, entering into an alliance of convenience with the Vietnamese in order to retain his throne and his privileged position in the country. Aware of the high standing of the Prince in the eyes of his people, the Vietnamese sought to utilise Sihanouk to legitimate their occupation in the eyes of the Cambodian people. The Khmer Rouge, the local Communists, were installed into power, led by Nuon Chea, who revealed a new flag and renamed the country 'Democratic Kampuchea'. The leadership of the Khmer Rouge countered anti-Sihanouk sentiments, pushed by figures such as Saloth Sar, by claiming that Kampuchea was still in essence a feudal society and required the unity represented by the monarch to pursue \"internal national liberation\" and provide both legitimacy and stability to the new regime. \"In our country, the peasant need not know the dialectic\" said Chea, \"he need only that the Prince know it, or at least follow it\".\n\nPeople's Republic of Kampuchea​\n\nFrom the beginning, Kampuchea proved a problem for the Vietnamese. Whilst dependent on Hanoi, the Khmer Rouge noticeably chafed at their leash. Compared with the Pathet Lao, the Kampuchean Communists were downright rebellious, often openly contradicting and even disrespecting the Vietnamese in meetings between the Communist parties. Despite this fact, the Khmer Rouge leadership knew who their control depended on, and the more vocal and radical anti-Vietnamese Khmer Rouge such as Saloth Sar were sidelined within the Party[167]. Aside from being a political weak link for the Vietnamese, it was also an area of constant guerrilla warfare. Khmer nationalists, primarily from the Khmer Serei issarak continue to strike at Vietnamese occupation forces from the Thai border, where they received support from the Thais and Americans in the form of arms, food and training. In response to these attacks, the Vietnamese regularly engaged, with assistance from Kampuchean forces, in raids deep into Thai territory. Diplomatically, the Vietnamese dismissed these instances as cases of accidental 'hot pursuit' over the border by its forces, but Vietnamese persistence eventually resulted in skirmishes with Thai forces, who more often than not were ambushed or fired upon first by the Vietnamese. In response the Thais situated artillery in sites along the border. In a sense, some of these skirmishes illustrated the callousness of proxy conflicts during the Cold War, with the Thais training artillery on refugee camps inhabited by anti-Communist Khmers, knowing that the Vietnamese would be drawn to these camps as targets. The resulting barrages often killed more Khmers than Vietnamese. Recognising that these raids were both ineffective and risked escalation, and uncertain whether they would be able to decisively defeat the Thais should it come to all-out war, the Vietnamese changed their defense strategy in Kampuchea. Le Duc Anh, commander of the PAVN forces in Kampuchea, was architect of the K5 Plan, known in the West as the 'bamboo curtain'. The plan involved clearing long patches of tropical forest as well as slashing and uprooting tall vegetation in order to cut a 700km-long, 500m-wide swathe along the Kampuchean-Thai border, bristling with anti-tank and anti-personnel mines at a density of 3,000 mines/km of frontage. This solution was expensive and irritated local farmers, who were tasked with cutting down regrowth. Eventually, the local farmers were resettled in plots confiscated from landholders in other parts of the country, and prisoners were used to cut the regrowth. The K5 Plan, whilst ambitious, was largely ineffective. Constant maintenance proved a drain on resources and it failed to effectively deter Khmer guerrillas, who persistently found gaps along the 700km border. Nevertheless, there was little doubt that it would prove a formidable obstacle should the Thais attempt an offensive into Kampuchea[168].\n\nPathet Lao soldiers in Vientiane, 1973. At this point, Caltex had not operated that particular gas station for a few years​\n\nIn neighbouring Laos, the Communist takeover was followed by a period of severe repression. Whilst the Pathet Lao declared a moderate policy, pleasantly surprising much of the population, particularly the small professional and business classes, Souphanouvong, half-brother of Prince Phetxarat and leader of the Pathet Lao, soon went back on his word and demanded immediate change. Prince Souvanna Phouma, leader of the Neutralists and Prime Minister of Laos, resigned and King Sisavang Vatthana was forced to abdicate. The King and his immediate family would die in a re-education camp near the Vietnamese border. Souphanouvong became the figurehead President of the newly-declared Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR), although the real power lay with Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihane. The inception of the Pathet Lao regime saw the cessation of printing of non-Communist newspapers and a large-scale purge of the civil service, army and police. Thousands were sent to \"reeducation camps\" deep in the remote jungles of Laos. The professional and intellectual classes fled en masse, and anticommunist leader Vang Pao led thousands of his Hmong fighters and their families into Thailand. Those Hmong that remained were discriminated against severely, granted few of the relatively rudimentary rights of ordinary Lao citizens. Political power in the LPDR was concentrated in the hands of four men: Prime Minister and General Secretary Kaysone Phomvihane; economics chief Nuhak Phumsavon; planning minister Sali Voykhamxao; and security chief Khamtai Siphandon. This small clique, with the acquiescence and assistance of the Vietnamese, monopolised governance of the LPDR. Unchallenged as leader of the LPDR, Kaysone introduced collectivisation of agriculture. All land was declared state property and farms were merged into cooperatives. Unlike in states like China however (and even Vietnam), there existed no real feudal landholder class in Laos. Most of the farmland in Laos was owned by smallholders, meaning that there was little benefit that could be gained from collectivisation at all. The productive farmland was also primarily situated in areas inhabited by the culturally-dominant Lowland Lao. The Pathet Lao had always relied not on the Lowland, but the Highland Lao for support. Thus most of the Lowland Lao farmers, who already had no particular loyalty to the Communists, were alienated by their land reform. Rebelling against collectivisation and rice procurement, many Lao farmers sold their crops at low prices in Thailand. As state procurements fell sharply in both volume and value, and with the cutoff of US aid being replaced by a mere trickle of Soviet, Chinese and Vietnamese aid, shortages, unemployment and economic hardship emerged in the towns. Of even greater concern to the Pathet Lao regime, the royalist Lao National Revolutionary Front began to operate from bases in Thailand. In response, the Lao government began to restrict movement, institute tight censorship and curtail \"decadent\" activities such as cinema entertainment or nightlife. By 1977, recognising the failures of their repressive mode of governance, controls on movement were limited and agriculture was decollectivised.\n\nIn Vietnam itself, the Communists sought to institute a socialist system throughout the country. The newly-annexed south was gradually communised, although initially some degree of private enterprise was deemed necessary to maintain international trade. The Second Five Year Plan, from 1976 to 1980, set unrealistically high goals for the average annual growth rate of industry (set at 16 to 19%), agriculture (8 to 10%) and national income (13-14%). Development plans were to focus equally on both agricultural and industrial development, intended to allow Vietnam to bypass the capitalist stage of development. The influence of Trotskyist groups in southern Vietnam on this policy is disputed by historians. Whilst on the surface such a policy appears Trotskyist, not only had the Trotskyists been decimated in the immediate postwar period by the Viet Minh, but the DRV engaged in a purge of many 'left communist' Viet Cong groups, including Maoists and those that appeared to hold \"Trotskyist ideas\" (even though no group claimed affiliation with the Fourth International). Regardless, collectivisation and repossession of crops had a negative impact on economic development, which stagnated. With the death of Mao Tse-Tung and the rise of the Hua Kuo-feng clique in China, the Vietnamese, concerned with the developing Sino-Soviet Rapprochement, sought a means to permanently tighten its hold on Laos and Kampuchea, precluding any struggle with China over regional hegemony. In order to do so, Pham Van Dong resurrected Ho Chi Minh's idea of an \"Indochinese Socialist Federation\". In 1979, the Hue Declaration was announced, where Vietnamese, Laotian and Kampuchean leaders declared the Socialist Federation of Indochina (SFI), comprised of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (as the DRV was renamed in 1976), Democratic Kampuchea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Each nation maintained their own head of state (for instance, Sihanouk in Kampuchea) and even their own armed forces, although they were all under the overall command of the Minister of Defence (always Vietnamese). The Khmer Rouge and Pathet Lao became the Indochinese Communist Party-Kampuchea and Indochinese Communist Party-Laos respectively, but their operation stayed largely the same. The SFI was largely a project that limited the ability of the Kampuchean and Laotian elites to act independently of Hanoi, but ensured military, financial and diplomatic support from Vietnam to the elites of Kampuchea and Laos. In 1978, collectivisation in Vietnam began to be reversed, although it was maintained in Kampuchea into the 1980s.\n\nA Laotian propaganda poster showing revolutionary women of Laos, Kampuchea and Vietnam standing in solidarity, gazing towards a brighter future​\n\n---\n\n[167] I thought sidelining Pol Pot would be much better than doing something corny like killing him. I assume that in difference circumstances (i.e. where the Vietnam War didn't happen) that even though anti-Vietnamese sentiment will still be there in the Khmer Rouge (and Cambodian society in general), that the radicals like Pol Pot should be able to be sidelined. That goes double without Mao being able to poke his nose in too much.\n\n[168] The K5 plan was done IOTL, and is the primary reason why the modern Thai-Cambodian border is one of the most heaviest-mined on the planet. Unfortunately a lot of people have been killed or disabled by unexploded ordinance and mines. IIRC more so in Cambodia than in Vietnam. Anyhow, ITTL the plan isn't abandoned as it was IOTL, due to the more permanent nature of Vietnamese presence."
