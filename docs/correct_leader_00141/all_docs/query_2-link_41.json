Role of the Penal Law\n\nThe role of the Penal Law is to safeguard the political, economic and social system of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the property of the State, collectives and individuals, the life, health, rights and freedom of the people, and the national security and public order; to counter and prevent offences; and to educate all citizens to respect the laws.1\n\nIn order to implement this role, this law defines certain acts as offences2 and subjects the perpetrator to penalties.\n\nArticle 2. (New) Basis of Penal Responsibilities\n\nAn individual can only be charged with and punished for an offence based on intentional or negligent acts deemed dangerous for society as defined in the Penal Law or in other laws of the Lao People's Democratic Republic that define criminal penalties, and [such individual can be punished] only when a decision is rendered by a court.\n\n1 For readability, the punctuation in this sentence has been modified.\n\n2 The terms âoffenceâ and âinfractionâ are used to refer generally to criminal acts. There are three levels of such criminal acts as set out in Article 8. âMinor offenceâ, âmajor offenceâ and âcrimeâ are used specifically to refer to those three levels. The translators are aware that the Specific Part of the Penal Law does not in fact categorise offences into these three levels.\n\nOfficial Translation by National Assembly 1\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nChapter 2 Territorial Scope of Penal Law\n\nArticle 3. (New) Application of Penal Law within the Territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic\n\nThis law is binding in the territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. An individual who commits an offence within the territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic may be charged and punished in accordance with the Penal Law or other laws of the Lao People's Democratic Republic that define criminal penalties.\n\nIn the event that diplomatic representatives or individuals benefiting from the diplomatic immunity conferred by international conventions commit offences in the territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, these cases shall be solved through diplomatic channels.\n\nArticle 4. Application of Penal Law outside the Territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic\n\nLao citizens who commit offences outside the territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic shall be charged with and punished for such offences if they are defined [as offences under] the Penal Law of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.\n\nAliens and apatrids residing in the Lao People's Democratic Republic3 who commit offences outside the territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic shall also be charged and punished.\n\nForeign individuals who commit offences outside the territory of the Lao People's Democratic Republic shall be charged and punished as provided in the Penal Law of the Lao People's Democratic Republic if such a case is provided for in international conventions.\n\nArticle 5. [Period of Effectiveness of] the Penal Law\n\nThis law enters into force on the day it is promulgated.\n\nAny new law calling for lighter penalties or eliminating any offence provided in former laws shall take retroactive effect.\n\nNew laws stipulating new offences or calling for heavier punishment than that provided in an earlier law shall not take retroactive effect.\n\n3 Readers may wish to refer to the Law on Lao Nationality for the distinction between citizens, foreign individuals, aliens and apatrids (i.e., persons unable to certify their nationality).\n\n2\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nChapter 2 Offences and Offenders\n\nArticle 6. (New) Definition of Offence\n\nAll acts and abstentions deemed dangerous to the political, economic or social system of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, to the property of the State, collectives or individuals, to the lives, health, integrity, rights or freedom of the people, or to national security or public order as provided in the Penal Law or in other laws of the Lao People's Democratic Republic that define criminal penalties shall be considered offences.\n\nAll acts or abstentions with all the components of offences but resulting in damage under 500,000 Kip shall not be considered offences, except for acts of recidivism or acts performed as a profession.\n\nArticle 7. (New) Components of Offences\n\nThe components of an offence [refer to] those objective and subjective characteristics of behaviour that the Penal Law defines as together constituting an offence.4\n\nAn offence consists of four components as follows:\n\nâ¢ Material component5; â¢ Objective component; â¢ Subjective component; â¢ Actorâs component.\n\nThe material component of an offence [refers to] the social relationship that is regulated by the Penal Law, and that is affected by the offence.\n\nThe objective component of an offence [refers to] the external characteristics of the behaviour that has caused, or [is evidence of] an intention to cause, damage to a social relationship that is regulated by the Penal Law, including the time, location, vehicle6, equipment, circumstances and means used for committing the offence.\n\n4 Although it only refers to the Penal Law, this provision is not intended to prohibit offences from being defined in other laws.\n\n5 The translators understand that the idea of âmaterial componentâ is based on a socialist concept of materialism and refers to the social importance of the relationships (which may include the relationship between a person and property) to be regulated.\n\n6 In the Lao language, the same word is used for âinstrumentsâ, âvehiclesâ and âmeansâ in their conceptual sense (e.g., âwords are the vehicles of meaningâ) and also to refer to physical, tangible instruments and vehicles. Generally, the translators have used the more neutral âmeansâ rather than âvehiclesâ, which is likely to be understood as tangible, motorised vehicles, unless the context clearly indicates that vehicles is intended.\n\n3\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe subjective component of an offence [refers to] the characteristics of the attitude and state of mind of the offender regarding his act of offence, as expressed externally through the behaviour that constitutes the offence.\n\nThe actorâs component of an offence refers to the fact that in order to be liable, the offender must be mentally competent, must not be insane, and must have reached the age of majority, that is, at least 15 years of age7.\n\nArticle 8. (New) Categories of Offences\n\nOffences are divided into three categories:\n\nâ¢ âMinor offencesâ8 are offences punished under the law by public criticism or fine;\n\nâ¢ âMajor offencesâ9 are offences punished under the law by re- education without deprivation of liberty, and imprisonment from three months to ten years, and fines; [and]\n\nâ¢ âCrimesâ10 are offences punished under the law by imprisonment from five years up to the death penalty.\n\nArticle 9. Intentional Offences\n\nIntentional offences are voluntary acts or abstentions of the offender, which are undertaken with full knowledge of their dangerous nature for society and their consequences.11\n\nArticle 10. Negligent Offences\n\nNegligent offences are acts or abstentions of the offender undertaken carelessly with full knowledge that such acts or abstentions might be dangerous for society, and where the consequence is expected and possible to anticipate, although the offender [himself] does not believe or expect that such consequence would take place.12\n\n7 The translators are aware that the specific age referred to in this article (15 years) is different from the age of majority specified in other laws.\n\n8 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n9 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n10 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n11 For readability, the structure of this sentence has been modified. There are two principal requirements under this article â voluntariness and knowledge of consequences.\n\n12 For readability, the structure of this sentence has been modified.\n\n4\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 11. Offences Pertaining to Several Categories\n\nAn offence pertaining to several categories refers to an act or several acts of infraction committed by an individual, [where such act or acts are] classifiable under two or more categories,13 transgress several articles of the Penal Law, and with respect to which a decision shall be rendered at the same time and in the same court.\n\nArticle 12. Recidivism\n\nRecidivism refers to an intentional offence committed by an individual while he14 is still serving his sentence for a previous intentional offence, or an intentional offence committed by an individual within a period of five years after serving a sentence for the same or a similar intentional offence.\n\nArticle 13. Preparation to Commit Offences\n\nâPreparation to commit an offenceâ15 refers to the preparation of materials, conditions or other factors in order to commit an intentional offence.\n\nSuch preparation to commit an offence shall only be charged or punished if deemed dangerous for society, as provided in the specific part of this law. 16\n\nPreparation to commit offences shall be punished according to the articles prescribing penalties for the offence itself.\n\nArticle 14. Attempts to Commit Offences\n\nâAttempt to commit an offenceâ17 refers to the taking of intentional acts which are components of an offence but where the offence was not completed because of circumstances outside the control of the offender, making such acts not successful.\n\n13 There is insufficient textual evidence to confirm whether this comma should be interpreted as âandâ or âorâ.\n\n14 Readers should note that the Lao language does not distinguish between genders in pronouns. In this translation, a reference to a gender is a reference to all genders, unless the context requires otherwise (as is the case in some Articles). The translatorsâ decision to use the male gender pronoun as the default translation was made in the interests of simplicity and consistency.\n\n15 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n16 Readers should not assume that all preparations and attempts to commit an offence are punishable. Rather, the articles in the specific part of this law specifically prescribe whether preparation or attempt of an offence is punishable.\n\n17 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n5\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nSuch attempts to commit an offence shall only be charged or punished if deemed dangerous for society, as provided in the specific part of this law.18\n\nAttempts to commit an offence shall be punished according to the articles prescribing penalties for the offence itself.\n\nArticle 15. Voluntary Abandonment of Offences\n\nAny individual who voluntarily abandons the completion of an offence during its preparation or attempt shall not be charged or punished, unless [any act of preparation or attempt which he has taken] is itself a [separate] offence as provided in this law.\n\nArticle 16. Definition of Offender\n\nAn offender is an individual who has committed any acts or abstentions that cause danger to society and [where such acts or abstentions] satisfy all the components of an offence as provided in the laws.\n\nArticle 17. (New) Participation in an Offence\n\nâParticipation in an offenceâ19 refers to intentional participation in an offence by two or more persons.\n\nParticipants in an offence are:\n\nâ¢ Authors; â¢ Implementers; â¢ Inciters; and â¢ Accomplices.\n\nThe author is the one who has planned, organised or given instructions to commit the offence; The implementer is the one who has directly committed the offence; Inciters are persons persuading others to commit offences; [and] Accomplices are persons who have intentionally assisted in the offence, or who have previously agreed to hide the offender, to hide instruments and tools of the offence, to efface traces of the offence or to conceal any proceeds from the offence.\n\n18 Ibid.\n\n19 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n6\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nChapter 4 Exemption from Charge and Punishment\n\nArticle 18. (New) Circumstances that Lead to Exemption from Penal Liability\n\nCircumstances that lead to exemption from penal liability are as follows:\n\n1. Force and threat; 2. Legitimate defence; 3. State of necessity; 4. Performance of professional duty; 5. Implementation of order; 6. Playing of sports; 7. Offences against which complaints must be lodged by the\n\ndamaged parties; 8. Expiration of the term of prosecution.\n\nArticle 19. Force and Threat\n\nAny individual committing an offence under force or threat in circumstances where such force or threat could not have been avoided shall not be charged or punished.\n\nIn the event that such offence is a crime, [the] force or threat shall only constitute extenuating circumstances regarding punishment.\n\nArticle 20. Legitimate Defence\n\nActs of âlegitimate defenceâ20 refers to acts taken by an individual to safeguard the interests of the State or society, [or to safeguard] his own or another individual's life, health, [or] legitimate rights and interests against acts of aggression dangerous for the society; but such acts of aggression must be truly existing and dangerous, and the acts of legitimate defence must be contemporaneous with and proportionate to the acts of aggression.\n\nActs of legitimate defence are not considered offences.\n\nArticle 21. State of Necessity\n\n[An act taken in a] âstate of necessityâ21 refers to an individualâs act which is necessary to avoid threats against the interests of the State or society, [or against] his own or another individual's life, health, [or] legitimate rights and interests, where such threats cannot be avoided by other methods and are\n\n20 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n21 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n7\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nnot created by such individual, and where the damage caused by such act is less than the damage that would have resulted from the threat.\n\nActs taken in a state of necessity are not considered offences.\n\nArticle 22. (New) Performance of Professional Duty\n\nThe âperformance of a professional dutyâ22 shall be regarded as a circumstance that leads to exemption from penal liability if it meets the following criteria:\n\n1. The act shall be within the scope of the rights and duties [of the actor];\n\n2. The act shall be in conformity with professionalism and with laws and regulations.\n\nArticle 23.

The person implementing the order shall implement the order\n\nwithin the scope of the order and in conformity with laws and regulations.\n\nArticle 24. (New) Playing of Sports\n\nThe âplaying of sportsâ24 shall be regarded as a circumstance that leads to exemption from penal liability if the playing of sports is conducted within the rules of the sport.\n\nArticle 25. Offences Against which Complaints Must be Lodged by the Damaged Parties\n\nNo criminal proceedings may be brought [in respect of] offences that are not dangerous for society and [in respect of which] the damaged party does not lodge any complaint, including the following matters: physical violence between close relatives without serious injury or physical disability; libel,\n\n22 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n23 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n24 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n8\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nslander, insult, and outrage to the body or the reputation of the dead; infraction of property rights of close relatives; and violation of domicile and privacy.25\n\nThe withdrawal of a complaint lodged by the damaged party shall terminate such criminal proceedings.\n\nArticle 26. Effectiveness of Prosecution\n\nProsecutions shall not be considered effective unless filed within:\n\nâ¢ One year, in the case of minor offences; â¢ Seven years, in the case of major offences; â¢ Fifteen years, in the case of crimes.\n\nThe [filing period for] effectiveness of a prosecution starts from the day the offence is committed. In the event a second offence is committed while legal proceedings are pending in respect of an earlier offence, the [filing period for] effectiveness of the [first] prosecution shall [re-start] from the day the later offence is committed. In the event of evasion of court proceedings, [the filing period for] effectiveness shall start from the day the offender presents himself or is arrested.\n\nChapter 5 Penalties\n\nArticle 27. Purposes of Penalties\n\nPenalties do not only aim to punish offenders, but also to re-educate punished individuals to bear a pure spirit towards work, to comply correctly and strictly with the laws, to respect the discipline of social life, and to avoid recidivism on the part of the punished offender and other individuals.\n\nPunishment does not aim to generate physical suffering or to outrage human dignity.\n\nArticle 28. Categories of Punishment\n\na /. Principal penalties\n\n1. Public criticism; 2. Re-education without deprivation of liberty; 3. Deprivation of liberty; 4. Death penalty.\n\n25 For readability, the punctuation and structure of this sentence have been modified.\n\n9\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nb /. Additional penalties\n\n1. Fines (in certain circumstances, it might become a principal penalty);\n\n2. Confiscation of items [connected to the offence]; 3. Confiscation of property; 4. Deprivation of election rights; 5. House arrest.\n\nThe confiscation of property and house arrest shall be inflicted on the offender only when such penalty is provided in the specific part of this Penal Law.\n\n[In addition to] the principal and additional penalties, the court can request relevant authorities to withdraw driving licenses or other permits, to relieve the offender from [performing] or forbid [the offender] to perform a function or duty, to withdraw orders, medals or titles, and to deport the offender.\n\nArticle 29.

Deprivation of Liberty\n\nDeprivation of liberty may be imposed for three months to twenty years or life imprisonment.\n\nLife imprisonment may not be imposed on offenders who are less than eighteen years old and on women in a state of pregnancy when the offence is committed.\n\n10\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nArticle 32. Death Penalty\n\nThe death penalty is the specific punishment to be imposed on offenders in especially serious cases as stated in the specific part of this law.\n\nThe death penalty is carried out by shooting.\n\nIt is forbidden to inflict a death sentence on offenders who are less than eighteen years old at the time of the offence, and on women who are in a state of pregnancy at the time the offence is committed, when the court makes its decision, or when the sentence is imposed.\n\nArticle 33. Fines\n\nFines are financial penalties determined by the court according to the cases26 and within the limits as stated by this Penal Law.\n\nThe fine must be computed in accordance with the gravity of the offence on the basis of the offender's economic status. In the event that the offender does not have the capacity to pay the fine, the court may commute such fine into the penalty of re-education without deprivation of liberty.\n\nIt is forbidden to commute a fine into deprivation of liberty and vice versa.\n\nArticle 34. Confiscation of Property and [Connected Items]\n\nâConfiscation of propertyâ27 refers to the confiscation by the State of part or all of an offenderâs property without any compensation.\n\nA sentence of confiscation of property may only be imposed in serious cases as stated in the specific part of this law.\n\nIn the event that the confiscation of all of the offenderâs property is imposed, exception must be made for property necessary for the livelihood of the offender and his family according to the list attached to this law. In the event that partial confiscation of property is imposed, the court must set up a clear list of the property to be confiscated.\n\nâConfiscation of items [connected to the offence]â refers to [the confiscation] by the State of items that were used in the offence or in the preparation for the offence, or that were obtained from an intentional offence. Items belonging to other individuals used in the offence shall be confiscated by the State if the owner lending them is not in good faith or if confiscation is deemed necessary for national security.\n\n26 An offence under an Article may attract different levels of punishment or fine, depending on specified circumstances. For each offence, the Article sets out the different âcasesâ of circumstances and the respective punishments for such âcaseâ.\n\n27 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n11\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nItems belonging to the State or collectives shall not be confiscated but shall be returned to the relevant authorities.\n\nArticle 35. Suspension of Right to Vote and to Be Elected\n\nSuspension of the right to vote and to be elected is inflicted on offenders committing crimes.\n\n[Where the offender has also been sentenced to deprivation of liberty,] the penalty of suspension of the right to vote and to be elected must not exceed five years from the day after he has finished serving his sentence.\n\nArticle 36. House Arrest\n\nHouse arrest forbids the sentenced offender from leaving a place of residence or from entering other territories as assigned or forbidden by a decision of the court.\n\n[Where the offender has also been sentenced to deprivation of liberty,] house arrest must not exceed five years from the day after he has finished serving his sentence.\n\nThe sentence of house arrest may not be imposed on offenders who are less than eighteen years old and on women in the state of pregnancy or women in charge of small children who are less than eight years old at the time the offence is committed.\n\nHouse arrest is defined in the specific part of this law.\n\nChapter 6 Prescription of Penalties\n\nArticle 37. General Regulations on the Prescription of Penalties\n\nThe court prescribes penalties on the basis of legal provisions on the punishment of offences. In prescribing penalties, the court must consider the nature and degree of the social threat posed by the offence, the personality of the offender, and circumstances conducive to the reduction or the increase of penal responsibilities.\n\nArticle 38. (New) Characteristics of Dangerous Offences\n\nAn offence is characterised as dangerous based on the category [of the offence] and the method [used to commit] the offence.\n\nArticle 39. (New) Levels of Danger of an Offence\n\nThe level of danger of an offence depends on the resulting loss to life, health, integrity, and property caused by the intentional or negligent offence.\n\n12\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThere are three levels of loss to property as follows:\n\n1. Low level or minor loss is from 500,000 Kip to 20,000,000 Kip; 2. Medium level or medium loss is from more than 20,000,000 Kip\n\nto 50,000,000 Kip; 3. High level or high loss is from more than 50,000,000 Kip.\n\nArticle 40.

An offence committed under the strong emotional shock generated\n\nby an illegal act of the victim; 5. An offence committed under force or threat; 6. An offender acts to prevent damage from being caused by his\n\noffence or compensates for the damage voluntarily and in good faith;\n\n7. An offence committed because of the offender's own or of his family's seriously difficult situation;\n\n8. An offender expresses remorse and surrenders to officials, and acknowledges and reveals offences committed by himself and others;\n\n9. A first offence, if it does not cause serious danger to society; [and] 10. An offender has shown merit towards the nation.\n\nIn the prescription of penalties, the court might take into consideration other factors not provided in this article but [which would commonly be considered relevant] to reduce penal responsibilities.\n\nArticle 41. Circumstances Conducive to the Increase of Penal Responsibilities\n\nCircumstances conducive to the increase of penal responsibilities are\n\n1. Recidivism; 2. Offences committed by organised groups; 3. Offences committed from greed; 4.

Initiation of minors into committing or participating in offences; 6. Barbarous or outrageous acts of infraction towards the victim; 7. Offences with serious consequences; 8. Offences committed during calamities; 9. Offences committed through methods dangerous to the public;\n\n13\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\n10. Offences committed in a state of drunkenness or drug abuse, and based on the nature of the committed offences, the court has the absolute right to decide whether or not to increase the penal responsibilities;\n\n11. Intentional imposition of guilt on honest persons; [and] 12. Offenders guilty of concealing other offences or using violence to\n\nescape.\n\nArticle 42. Prescription of Penalties for the Preparation of and Attempts [to Commit] Offences\n\nPrescription of penalties for the preparation of and attempts [to commit] offences must take into consideration their nature and degree of social threat, the degree of implementation of the offender's ill intentions, and the causes of such unsuccessful offences. The court may impose sentences with lighter penalties than those legally prescribed.\n\nArticle 43. (New) Prescription of Penalties for Accomplices to and Inciters of Offences\n\nPrescription of penalties for complicity in and incitement of offences must be considered on an equal basis as other forms of participation in such offences, but, taking into consideration the nature and degree of the complicity and incitement, the court may sentence lighter penalties than those prescribed.\n\nArticle 44. Prescription of Penalties for Young Offenders\n\nPrescription of penalties for a child [offender] who was under 18 years of age at the time of the offence shall take into account the level28 and characteristics of such offence, [but] the court may prescribe penalties under the level that is defined by the laws.\n\nArticle 45. Prescription of Penalties for Offences Pertaining to Several Categories\n\nWhere the same act [or set of acts] constitutes an offence pertaining to several categories,29 the prescription of penalties must be made on the basis of the legal provision providing for the heaviest punishment.\n\nThe prescription of a [total] penalty for several offences pertaining to several articles [in this law] must be made by adding the penalties for each separate offence, but the final result must not exceed the highest penalty that could have been imposed for the most serious offence among such offences.\n\n28 The Lao word translated as âlevelâ in this article is not the same as the words that have been translated as âcategoryâ and âcaseâ in other articles. It may refer to the âlevel of dangerâ of an offence but this is not clear from the original text.\n\n29 An âoffence pertaining to several categoriesâ is defined in Article 11.\n\n14\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nAdditional penalties may be added to the principal penalties in the event that such additional penalty is provided for in the specific part of this law.\n\nIn the event that a court decision has been issued and become final, or the offender has served the sentence in whole or in part, but it is determined that additional offences had previously been committed by the offender, the prescription of penalties must be made according to the above mentioned procedures.\n\nIn the event that the offender commits an offence after a court decision has been issued and become final or while he is serving his sentence, the court may add the remaining part of the penalty which is still due to be executed in whole or in part to the newly sentenced penalty.\n\nFines must be executed one by one, and are not subject to the above- mentioned procedures for adding and consolidating penalties.\n\nArticle 46. Prescription of Penalties on Recidivism\n\nAn offender guilty of recidivism in major offences shall be punished by adding half of the maximum penalty prescribed for major offences under this law to the penalty sentenced by the court for the current offence.\n\nRecidivism in crimes is conducive to an increase of penal responsibilities as stated in Article 41 of this law.\n\nArticle 47. Stay of Execution of Penalty\n\nThe âstay of executionâ30 of deprivation of liberty, re-education without deprivation of liberty or fines as the principal penalty, refers to the suspension of the execution of such penalties for a period of five years. If during such period, the offender is not convicted of any other intentional offence, the penalty shall be lifted. But in the event of a second intentional offence, if the offender is sentenced to be deprived of liberty and such a sentence is final, the offender must execute the new penalty in addition to the one which has been suspended.\n\nThe suspension of the execution of a penalty can be in whole or in part. Recidivists, those offenders sentenced to three years of deprivation of liberty or more, or those sentenced for crimes cannot benefit from a stay of execution of penalties.\n\nArticle 48.

Limitation Period for Execution of the Court's Decision\n\nPenalties shall not be imposed by the court unless executed within the following limitation periods:\n\nâ¢ One year for minor offences; â¢ Seven years for major offences; â¢ Fifteen years for crimes.\n\nThe limitation period starts on the day the court's sentence becomes final. In the event that the offender commits a new offence, the limitation period for execution of the courtâs decision in respect of any previous unexecuted sentence shall re-start on the day the second offence is committed. In the event that the offender evades penalties during the period of effectiveness of the sentence, the limitation period shall re-start from the day the offender presents himself or is arrested.\n\nArticle 52. Conditional Liberation before Term\n\nâConditional liberation before termâ,31 based on the suggestion of the reformatory centreâs responsible committee, may be granted to progressive, repenting, and exemplary working offenders, who have served half of their sentences in the case of offenders who were less than eighteen years old when the offence was committed, two thirds of the sentence in the case of adult offenders and fifteen years for offenders sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n31 The quotation marks have been added and are not in the original text.\n\n16\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nThe local people's court executing the sanction of sentences is entitled to consider the grant of conditional liberation before term and to outline the conditions to be imposed upon the liberated offender. If within a period of five years, the offender who is granted conditional liberation before term has correctly complied with the outlined conditions and has not committed any further offences, the remaining punishment shall be lifted.\n\nIn the event that the outlined conditions are not respected during such period [of 5 years], the offender who is granted conditional liberation before term [shall be liable] to serve the remaining sentence. In the event that a new offence is committed during such period [of 5 years], the offender [shall be] liable to serve the new sentence in addition to the former remaining sentence.\n\nRecidivist offenders or offenders sentenced to a death penalty commuted into imprisonment cannot be granted liberation before term.\n\nChapter 8 The Courtâs Measures of\n\nRe-education and Medical Treatment\n\nArticle 53.

Require [the child] to request the damaged party's pardon by appropriate means;\n\n2. Require the parents or guardians to pay civil compensation; 3. Send [the child] back to the person(s) having charge of the child\n\nfor re-education; or 4. Send [the child] to administrative authorities and social\n\norganisations for re-education.\n\nThe court may apply the above-mentioned measures to children between fifteen and eighteen years old who commit minor and major offences.\n\nArticle 54. Measures Applied by the Court towards Mentally Disturbed Offenders\n\nOffenders committing offences under a state of mental disturbance or offenders in possession of their full conscience [during the offence who become] subject to mental disturbances before a sentence is imposed by the court or while serving the sentence, may benefit from measures pertaining to medical treatment, such as being sent to psychiatric hospitals or specific medical care centres.\n\nAfter recovering from such a disturbance to his state of mental health, the offender must be brought back and sentenced by the court or the sentence must be executed if the lodged complaint or the court's decision is still valid.\n\n17\n\nTranslation Endorsed by the Law Committee of the National Assembly of the Lao PDR\n\nSPECIFIC PART\n\nChapter 1 Offences against National Security\n\nAnd Social Orderliness\n\nArticle 56.
