The\n\ntranslators have chosen “inspection” (and its variants) as the most appropriate English equivalent but\n\nreaders should note and bear in mind the other meanings that might have been intended.\n\n5 The translators are aware that the sentence is circular in its logic.\n\n6 The translators are aware that Article 35 does not stipulate any authority.\n\n7 The term “policies” is often used as an indirect way of referring to “incentives’ or “privileges”\n\nand the term “measures” is often used as an indirect way of referring to “sanctions”.\n\n8 Here, “re-education” does not mean the same as “re-education without deprivation of liberty”\n\nreferred to in the Penal Law."
