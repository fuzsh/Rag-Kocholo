        "text": "OK, how many unreconstructed communist one-party states are there left from the old eastern bloc days? It's easy to name four: China, because it's huge; Vietnam, because it's resonant; Cuba, because it spooks the Americans; North Korea, because it spooks everyone. But there's a fifth, of which we hear almost nothing.\n\nThat's partly because it's small, obscure and distant, and partly because its leaders have skilfully kept the place out of the limelight. There are no journalists in the country, excluding the poor saps whose job is to regurgitate what the party tells them.\n\nThis, however, is a big month in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, otherwise known as Laos, the country tucked away inland from Vietnam. Tomorrow is National Day and there will be a huge parade to mark the 25th anniversary of the communist takeover on December 2 1975. Nine days later the foreign ministers of Europe (or underlings like Britain's John Battle) will meet their south-east Asian counterparts at a summit in the capital, Vientiane.\n\nFrom their hotel and limousine windows, they will glimpse somewhere wholly at odds with the conventional notion of any Asian capital, still less a communist one. Vientiane is a strange and dreamy place. English villages have more traffic. There are thousands of dogs, but one rarely summons enough vigour to bark. The city bakes in the sun and the Mekong River drifts by, between sandbars, as lazy in the dry season as everything else. And this is the bustling heart of Laos. The lovely former capital of Luang Prabang apart, the rest is mostly mountains and tropical forest. No one has had the energy to chop it all down yet.\n\nLaos was always like this, apparently. \"The Vietnamese plant rice,\" went a French colonialist saying, \"the Lao listen to it grow.\" And the torpor affects everyone. \"Europeans who come here to live soon acquire a certain, recognisable manner,\" wrote Norman Lewis in 1951. \"They develop quiet voices and strange, rapt expressions.\"\n\nVientiane feels like one of those small South American towns where Butch and Sundance might ride in to rob a bank. Not that they would find much worth stealing: the currency is almost worthless. It is called the kip (which ought to be divided into 40 winks). The national monument is called the Great Stupa, which sums up the mood. Except when a bomb goes off. Which happens frequently.\n\nIn the past seven months, 12 devices have exploded round the city, at places where tourists and ordinary Laos congregate: a backpackers' cafe, the morning market, the airport. There have certainly been serious injuries. Estimates of deaths range from zero to 10. Nobody knows. Nobody even knows who is planting the bombs or why.\n\nBy the end of my third day in the country, I have heard nine separate explanations and am working on a 10th myself. A senior minister, asked who did it, replies: \"Bad people.\" The randomness of the attacks makes it hard to argue.\n\nBut nobody knows anything in Laos. Not a thing. For instance, there is no consensus among observers on who wields the power inside the politburo: the president, Khamtay Siphandone, or someone else. It is like the Moscow of 30 years ago, when outsiders only got a clue that a leader had been ousted when he failed to show up on May Day. But even in the Soviet Union it was possible to agree on a few fundamentals.\n\n\"Let's get this right,\" I say to one analyst. \"Laos is a country of five million people . . .\"\n\n\"Well, maybe,\" he replies. \"Something like that. They've never been counted properly. So how would anyone know?\"\n\n\"OK,\" I say. \"And it's about the size of Britain . . .\"\n\nHe looks pained.\n\n\"Surely we know how big Laos is . . .\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. They're just starting on the demarcation of the Chinese border. The Vietnamese border goes through deep jungle and it's completely unclear where the line might be. And then there's the Mekong, which keeps shifting.\"\n\nThose borders have been the country's damnation for ever. Everyone has come in and rained on the gentle Lao: the Chinese, the Burmese, the Siamese, the French (who invested nothing), the Lao royal family (\"degenerate\" is the kindest description I hear), the Americans (from a great height) and finally the communists and their Vietnamese patrons. It was said that the US dropped more bombs on Laos when the Vietnam war spilled over than were dropped in the whole of the second world war. They made no difference.\n\nThe governing creed behind American involvement was the domino theory: if Vietnam went communist, neighbouring countries would topple; even Japan and Australia might soon be threatened.\n\nAnd this was proved partially right. Laos fell, not as brutally as Cambodia, but brutally enough. The royal family was taken away and never reappeared. At least 30,000 others - maybe many more - were sent away for re-education. For 10 years, stern neo-Stalinism was enforced. On National Day 1985 the masses were instructed to be on the parade ground at 4am to hear hour-long speeches starting at six, followed by a march-past by men and women in boiler suits.\n\nBut those permeable borders had advantages. East European dissidents had to risk their lives trying to breach the iron curtain; Cubans and Vietnamese died en masse while trying to escape in small boats. But it is impossible to patrol the Mekong. At very low water, there are places you can paddle across. Anyone who really wanted to go could be in Thailand in no time. Many left at once, including the fighters from the Hmong minority in the north, who had thought they were playing safe by throwing in their lot with the CIA. The Mekong has been a major smuggling route since the middle ages: spices, opium, slaves, escapees, whatever. No system could change that.\n\nAnd eventually the ancient traditions began to dilute the ideology. Most urban Laos are followers of Theravada Buddhism, a stoical branch of a stoical religion, which helped them endure the early years. The leadership then gave up persecuting Buddhism (though Christian missionaries are still barred), and appropriated Buddhist symbolism for the state. Laos become a unique flower, a red-and-saffron hybrid. And for a time it looked like flourishing.\n\n\"In the early 90s, inch by inch, this place really was coming out of the dark ages,\" one Vientiane-based businessman tells me. \"We thought we might even have free elections.\" He was spectacularly wrong, which is why he (and everyone else who speaks to me) cannot be named.\n\nPolitically, Laos remains almost a client state of Vietnam, the exact state of dependence - like everything else - being unclear. Its leaders are elderly and anonymous. They do not terrorise the people, but they permit no argument. And, as in Vietnam, the economy nosedived in the late 90s. Officially, this was because of the Asian economic crisis. According to critics, it was because the government insisted on fuelling inflation at the worst possible moment. Now the kip is mainly good for wallpaper: the largest note, a 5,000, is worth just over 40p. Government salaries did not go up to compensate, so Buddhism and Leninism had to be replaced by a new official state religion: kickbackism.\n\n\"We're being squeezed all the time,\" says the businessman. \"It's not tax, it's bribes. You don't just bribe at the top. You bribe everybody from the cleaner upwards or you don't get anything at all. If you want a licence for something, you need $40,000, or in every office there'll be a problem. So if you're a foreign investor, you say, 'Here's a market of 5m people, 3m of whom are lost in the forest. Is it worth it?' You think 10 times about coming here.\"\n\nThere is a charitable way of regarding the bribery. Laos could be described as a functioning kleptocracy. The collapse of the kip means a mid-ranking civil servant now earns about £15 a month. Even ministers might earn only double that. That's if the pay actually turns up. Since the government cannot afford to increase the salaries, Laos has absorbed the canker into its system and developed a pay-as-you-go civil service. Since life for the peasantry goes on as ever, and the private sector operates in dollars or Thai bahts, the only people really being screwed are those, such as teachers, who are not considered worth bribing.\n\nTourist dollars are welcome, too, and numbers are slowly increasing - perhaps up to 5,000 Britons will visit this year. Indeed, backpackers now dominate the centre of Vientiane, and the gaudy Buddhist temples are being outnumbered by the tourists' own shrines, the internet cafes. There they worship for hours, seeking answers from their own god, all-knowing, even of the third-division football results.\n\nThese are more innocent diversions than used to be the norm. Poppies are a major cash crop. Before the US embassy got heavy and threatened the aid programme, Vientiane was perhaps the easiest capital in the world to get an opium hit. The Vang Vieng area, north of Vientiane, is reputedly still full of opium dens, though I suspect they are run by police to entrap tourists who then have to bribe their way out.\n\nBut who needs drugs here? Breathe the air and you fall into a trance. And when the breeze blows along the Mekong it feels very close to heaven. After an hour at a forest temple, I have mentally composed my letter to the editor (\"As you will have expected for some time, I am resigning from the Guardian to become a Buddhist monk\"). I defer posting it after talking to one of my prospective colleagues, who mentions the 4am starts and the absence of food after midday. But the monks, I feel, are the most enviably spirited people in Laos. \"I hate the communists,\" says my friend, \"but they leave us alone.\"\n\nLife for an expatriate does seem rather terrifying. The English-language paper suggests nothing except a Sunday game of \"Touch Ruby\", which sounds most exciting until I realise there is a g missing. Norman Lewis said the chief diversion in 1950 was a trip to the slaughterhouse. Even now, there is a semi-official midnight curfew. The handful of discos and bars are shut by 11.30 and there is nothing else to do except snog on the riverbank, an enchanting prospect, especially at full moon (a time of great propitiousness in Lao culture), at least until a policeman shows up. Extramarital sex between foreigners and Laos is illegal; marriage requires years of bribing officials.\n\nBut through it all, the shadows of the bombers. Who and why? The following are named to me as possible perpetrators:\n\n1. Disaffected Hmong.\n\n2. Royalists.\n\n3. The Chinese, bent on conquest.\n\n4. A business dispute.\n\n5. An internal dispute between governmental factions.\n\n6. The CIA.\n\n7. The army - to get at the police.\n\n8. Vice versa.\n\n9. A lovers' tiff.\n\nWe have gone beyond the point where the lovers' tiff explanation is credible. I offer instead my own thought that the incidence of bombings went down as the river levels went up in the wet season - suggesting that the perpetrators might be Lao exiles coming over from Thailand.\n\nBetween attacks, life drifts on. There is none of the furious ambition that drives China or Vietnam. The people are not starving, as in North Korea. The regime seems to have the same air of gentle, drifting futility as the people. Perhaps this will be the last communist state, because no one will feel motivated enough to topple it. Or maybe one huge bomb at tomorrow's parade will blast the whole government apart. You cannot begin to guess.\n\nThe businessman still has flashes of optimism. Mountains, forest, a history of trade . . . \"This place could be the Switzerland of Asia,\" he says.\n\n\"Be careful,\" I warn. \"They used to talk about the Switzerland of Africa. That was Rwanda.\"\n\n\"No, that would never happen here,\" he says. \"Even the military's got no money and no arms. They'd have to ask the Vietnamese to do the fighting.\""
