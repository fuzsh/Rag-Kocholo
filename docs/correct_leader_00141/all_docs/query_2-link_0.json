        "text": "Laotian politician (born 1924)\n\nGeneral Khamtai Siphandone (Lao: ຄຳໄຕ ສີພັນດອນ; born 8 February 1924) is a Laotian politician who was Chairman of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party from 24 November 1992 to 21 March 2006 and President of Laos[1] from 24 February 1998 to 8 June 2006, when he was replaced by Choummaly Sayasone. He was a member of the Communist Party of Indochina in 1954 and a member of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party in 1956.\n\nSiphandone was born on 8 February 1924.[2] He comes from a peasant family from the far south of Laos. His first job was as a postman. He joined the national liberation movement Lao Issara after the end of the Second World War, which stood for the independence of Laos and against the return of the French protectorate administration. Before the French regained control of Savannakhet in March 1946, Siphandone seized the entire provincial fund (150,000 piastres). He became an officer of the armed wing of the movement and in 1948 their representative for southern Laos. After the split of Lao Issara in 1950 he joined the Viet Minh-backed Pathet Lao.[3]\n\nIn 1954 he became a member of the Communist Party of Indochina, and in 1955 the Lao People's Party, whose central committee he was from 1957. He was considered a close confidant of the first Secretary-General Kaysone Phomvihane. In 1962 he became his successor as chief of staff of the armed units of the Pathet Lao. In 1966 he became commander-in-chief of the resulting \"Lao People's Liberation Army\", which fought with North Vietnamese support, in the Laotian Civil War against the royal troops. In 1972 he rose to the Politburo of the LPRP.[3]\n\nSiphandone was the military commander of the Pathet Lao rebellion.[4] After the successful Communist takeover in 1975, he became the Minister of Defense and a Deputy Prime Minister of Laos.[4] During the 5th Party Congress in 1991, Siphandone was the third highest-ranking member of the party leadership, after Kaysone Phomvihane and Nouhak Phoumsavanh.[5] On 15 August 1991, he succeeded Kaysone as Prime Minister of Laos, who had left office to become President. After the death of longtime party leader Kaysone in 1992, Siphandone became Chairman of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party.[4]\n\nSiphandone succeeded Nouhak Phoumsavanh as president in 1998.[6] At the 8th Party Congress in 2006, he became an advisor to the LPRP Central Committee.\n\nSiphandone remained as party leader until 21 March 2006, when he was replaced by Choummaly.[7] He stepped down as president in June,[8] following the 2006 Laotian parliamentary election.\n\nSiphandone is married to Thongvanh Siphandone.[9] His son Sonexay joined the LPRP Politburo in 2016[10] and became Prime Minister of Laos in 2022.[11] His daughter Viengthong currently serves as President of the State Audit Organization.[12]\n\nOn 8 February 2024, he turned 100, and was sent congratulatory messages by General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyễn Phú Trọng and President of Vietnam Võ Văn Thưởng. The Vietnamese ambassador to Laos Nguyen Ba Hung presented a birthday gift to Siphandone to his son Sonexay.[13][14]\n\nLaos:\n\nNational Gold Medal\n\nOrder of Phoxay Lane Xang\n\nBrunei:\n\nFamily Order of Laila Utama (2004)[15]\n\nVietnam:\n\nGold Star Order\n\nSoviet Union:\n\nOrder of the Red Banner (1984)[16]"
