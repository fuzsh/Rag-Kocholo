Basilio Kitiya Prompa Seth Phiriyawiwatwong Editorial Board: Associate Professor Dr. Kanokwan Manorom Associate Professor Sommai Chinnak Assistant Professor Dr. Watcharee Srikham Assistant Professor Dr. Pinwadee Srisupan Assistant Professor Dr. Ram Prasansak Assistant Professor Ananthana Methanont Dr. Jiraporn Smyth Dr. Saowanee T. Alexander Dr. Surasom Krisnachuta Introduction The Third MSSRC International Conference on the Mekong Region and ASEAN in Transition: People and Transborder Issues, organised from 11-12 September 2014 brought scholars from different disciplines within the humanities and social sciences to share their research findings. Focusing on three themes—the changing shape of ASEAN countries, closer social and economic cooperation between member countries, and people and transborder issues—this international conference was crucial and timely. The papers in this collection of proceedings is a frozen-in-time record of the socio-economic situations of the different, yet connected, contexts of the ten ASEAN countries before the ASEAN economic integration in 2016. We have reviewed over 30 interesting articles from the conference, and we regret that we are not able to include all the articles in these special proceedings. Nevertheless, the set we include here consists of a wide range of studies, both in terms of research focus as well as methodology. Like many studies in the humanities and social sciences these days, we found our selections criss-crossed each other in nature, each incorporating theories and methodologies from more than one discipline. We have native specialists of many member countries as well as outsiders who have examined the socio-economic events in the Mekong Region. We hope that, apart from the inherently interesting focus of their research, this combination of researchers will also make these proceedings a good read. Diverse as they are, it is hard to group the articles into unified themes. In trying to do so, we decided to leave the differences in methods apart and instead group articles according to their issues of focus. As a result, three main groups of issues emerged: development programs, economies, and identities. We must admit, however, that there are some overlaps. To facilitate the reader, we have provided an introduction for each of the three sections with a short description of the theme as well as summaries of the studies. It is important to note, although it is probably not necessary, that the views expressed in this volume represent the views of the specific authors. Despite the fact that all articles passed our review process, neither reviewers nor members of the editorial team are responsible for any shortcomings or inaccuracies.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the economic development that has occurred in the East Asian region has been the influential role of the state in directing its course. Vietnam is also following this well-worn path of state-led developmentalism. The principal contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we place the Vietnamese experience in comparative historical and conceptual perspective. It is suggested that the structure of the Vietnamese state itself and the distinctive nature of the policies it has undertaken are reflections of the country’s traumatic recent history and the fact that its leadership is notionally ‘‘communist.’’ Our second contribution is to detail some of the more important aspects of this process. We provide two case studies which focus on the role of state-owned enterprises and decentralisation initiatives which demonstrate that, despite the frequently ad hoc and contingent nature of the developmental project and an absence of the sort of state capacity that distinguished the likes of Japan in its heyday, the Vietnamese government is overseeing economic development in creative and surprisingly effective ways.\n\nThis article argues that power politics and the contending institutional contestation are key to understanding Mekong’s complex dynamics. It is structured in four main parts. The first discusses China’s struggle for predominance in the Mekong, known as Lancang in Chinese. The second part examines the parallel and competing subregional institutional architectures. The penultimate part explores how the US and other extra-regional development partners have responded to the changing configuration of power in Mekong. The last part concludes with the ways forward, by addressing how to transcend the geopolitical trap in the Mekong Basin. It calls for the riparian states to search for a sustained and robust regional architecture through a political construction of security community. Within the subregional security community, every Mekong actor should be seen as an equal partner and winner.\n\nThis report seeks to challenge the “success story” narrative of development in the Mekong region by considering rural people’s actual experiences of economic change in the “transition” economies of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Under the Asian Development Bank’s ambitious multibillion dollar program for regional development, the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) framework, fastpaced economic growth – underpinned by large-scale infrastructure development, economic integration and resource extraction – has been heavily promoted as the solution to entrenched poverty in the region. However, the livelihoods, culture and environment of too many have been seriously compromised by economic change in the Mekong. Although the claimed mandate of development has been to help poor people and improve their livelihoods, difficulties for many, most notably the multitudinous ethnic minorities of the Mekong, have been exacerbated. This is borne out in the literature reviewed for this report, which includes academic journal articles, research institute studies and reports by donors and non-government organisations published since 2001. In particular, the report draws on a number of key, localised, empirical studies which give detailed accounts of the circumstances, changes and implications for people living in Laos, Cambodia and the uplands of Vietnam. Specialised studies in aquatic resources, resource governance and health are also referenced which contribute important areas for consideration. The three main sections of this report reflect the critical themes that feature consistently across the studies. The first documents the changing experience of access to natural resources – gricultural land, forests and rivers – which forms the foundation of rural livelihoods in the Mekong. Changes in ownership of and access to these resources has been one of the fundamental components of GMS economic change, and it is in this area which the poor have experienced the greatest vulnerability. The second section examines experiences of the new economy, in particular those associated with agricultural transformation and new opportunities for commerce and trade, and considers some of the unintended consequences. The third section explores some of the impacts of economic change on cultures and their implications for people’s experience of poverty and wellbeing. Culture is one of the least considered aspects of development and poverty alleviation yet it is central to all that defines our humanity and therefore to the meaning of a concept such as poverty.\n\nToday, the Mekong Region (or the Greater Sub-region Mekong) 1is attracting the most attention in Asian International Development. The Mekong Region means transnational region that includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and Yunnan Province in China. There are roughly two major reasons of attention. Firstly, the Mekong Region is underdeveloped area because of the Southeast Asia’s Cold War. Secondly, this region attracted attention owing to the chance of international development in post-cold war scenario. In the early 1990s, transportation network was underdeveloped, but the east-west corridor and, the north-south corridor have been completed in 20 years. This means the awakening of the regional economic development and the regional economic integration. However, this development causes bad influences in social as well as environmental aspects. For example, Large-scale undocumented migrant workers, abuse of workers by multinational companies, trans-boundary environmental destruction by international development, problem of resource use of an international river, and so on. In this trend, efforts have begun towards the problem through regional cooperation. On the other hand, the cross-border civil society networks against these issues are emerging. Image of traditional Asian regional integration2 was centrism of politicians, bureaucrats and low institutional integration, in comparison to the EU. But, I would suggest that the qualitative changes were caused to Asian regional integration by the spread of regional economic integration and social integration. This paper attempts to show changes of Asian regional integration and new model. I'd consider important issues such as large dam issue and undocumented migrant workers in the transnational development in the Mekong region. This study purposes the making idea from empirical facts rather than theoretical examinations.\n\nAt its apex, the Khmer empire was Southeast Asia’s largest and most influential civilization: its civilizational reach stretched across several of today’s nation-states, and its core contained one of the world’s largest pre-industrial urban complexes. The roots of 9th-14th century Angkorian civilization appeared in the Mekong delta more than a millennium before Jayavarman II declared himself the universal Khmer monarch in 802 CE. At the start and to the south was the early polity that 3rd century Chinese emissaries called Funan, and that contained urban centers, walled palaces, libraries, and rulers. The earliest Khmer writing appears in the 7th century in this region, or nearly four centuries after the Han Chinese reports of Funan. By the 7th century, Khmer elite inscribed their legitimacy onto brick shrines and temples they commissioned to honor Indic gods across the delta’s landscape. Elite sponsorship of the construction and maintenance of ritual spaces required wealth; so did their support for ritual practices at these places, which materialized order that structured pre-Angkorian society. The rise of the pre-Angkorian Khmer state occurred during a period of fluctuating international trade in goods and ideas, and previous models have emphasized international trade as the catalyst for early state formation. This chapter studies early state formation instead through the development of the Mekong Delta’s 6th-8th century monumental art and architecture. Brick constructions, their dedicatory inscriptions, and the statuary they housed created symbols of cultural commonality that linked formerly autonomous communities into coherent regional systems. The Lower Mekong Archaeological Project survey area includes the early urban center of Angkor Borei. Research described here emphasizes archaeological patterning in social power to offer Southeast Asian perspectives on the articulation between ideology and social order in early states."
