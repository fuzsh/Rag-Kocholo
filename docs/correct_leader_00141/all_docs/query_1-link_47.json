        "text": "The president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is the head of state of Laos. The current president is Thongloun Sisoulith, since 22 March 2021. He was previously elected as the General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, Laos' most powerful position in January 2021, ranking him first in the Politburo.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe office of the President of the People's Democratic Republic traces its lineage back to Prince Souphanouvong, the first President of the People's Democratic Republic, a member of the deposed royal family and one of the Three Princes, who became President when the former Kingdom of Laos was overthrow by the Pathet Lao in 1975, at the end of the Laotian Civil War.\n\nDuties and rights[]\n\nTerm limits[]\n\nThe president is elected by the National Assembly for a term of five years, with no term limits. A candidate must receive at least two-thirds support from lawmakers present and voting in order to be elected.\n\nRole and authority[]\n\nThe president represents Laos internally and externally, supervises the work as well as preserving the stability of the national governmental system and safeguards the independence and territorial integrity of the country. The President appoints the prime minister, vice president, ministers and other officials with the consent of the National Assembly. Additionally, the President is the commander-in-chief of the Lao People's Armed Forces.\n\nHowever, as Laos is a one party communist state. The highest and the most powerful political position is the general secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, not the President. The general secretary controls the Politburo and the Secretariat, Laos' top decision-making bodies, making the officeholder as de facto leader of Laos. However, the offices have often been held concurrently.\n\nSince Laos is a one-party state, all the presidents of the People's Democratic Republic have been members of the party while holding office.\n\nList of presidents[]\n\nNo. Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death)\n\nTerm of office Election Prime minister(s) Took office Left office Time in office 1 Souphanouvong (1909–1995) 2 December 1975 29 October 1986 10 years, 331 days - Kaysone Phomvihane – Phoumi Vongvichit (1909–1994) - Acting 29 October 1986 15 August 1991 4 years, 290 days 2 Kaysone Phomvihane (1920–1992) 15 August 1991 21 November 1992 1 year, 98 days 1991 Khamtai Siphandon 3 Nouhak Phoumsavanh (1910–2008) 25 November 1992 24 February 1998 5 years, 91 days - Khamtai Siphandon 4 Khamtai Siphandon (born 1924) 24 February 1998 8 June 2006 8 years, 104 days 1996 2001 Sisavath Keobounphanh Bounnhang Vorachith 5 Choummaly Sayasone (born 1936) 8 June 2006 20 April 2016 9 years, 317 days 2006 2011 Bouasone Bouphavanh Thongsing Thammavong 6 Bounnhang Vorachit (born 1937) 20 April 2016 22 March 2021 4 years, 336 days 2016 Thongloun Sisoulith 7 Thongloun Sisoulith (born 1945) 22 March 2021 Incumbent 2 years, 297 days 2021 Phankham Viphavanh Sonexay Siphandone\n\nSee also[]"
