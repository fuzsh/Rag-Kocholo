The results, starting from an extremely low base, were striking - growth averaged 7% in 1988-2001 except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial crisis beginning in 1997. Despite this high growth rate, Laos remains a country with a primitive infrastructure; it has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The economy will continue to benefit from aid from the IMF and other international sources and from new foreign investment in food-processing and mining.\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity -$9.2 billion (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate: 5% (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $1,630 (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - composition by sector:\n\nagriculture:53%\n\nindustry: 22%\n\nservices:25% (2000 est.)\n\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 10% (2001 est.)\n\nLabor force: 2.4 million (1999)\n\nby occupation: agriculture 80% (1997 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 5.7% (1997 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nrevenues : $211 million\n\nexpenditures: $462 million, including capital expenditures of $NA (FY98/99 est.)\n\nIndustries: tin and gypsum mining, timber, electric power, agricultural processing, construction\n\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.5% (1999 est.)\n\nElectricity - capacity: 261,000 kW (1995)\n\nElectricity - production: 1.02 billion kWh (2000)\n\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 690.6 million kWh (2000)\n\nAgriculture - products: sweet potatoes, vegetables, corn, coffee, sugarcane, cotton; water buffalo, pigs, cattle, poultry\n\nExports:\n\ntotal value: $325 million (2001 est.)\n\ncommodities: electricity, wood products, coffee, tin, garments\n\npartners :Thailand 20%, France 7.5%, Germany 5.9%, UK 4.1%, Belgium 4% (2000)\n\nImports:\n\ntotal value: $540 million (f.o.b., 2000 est.)\n\ncommodities: food, fuel oil, consumer goods, manufactures\n\npartners: Thailand 52%, Singapore 3.9%, Japan 1.6%, Hong Kong 1.5%, China 0.8% (2000)\n\nDebt - external: $2.53 billion (1999)\n\nEconomic aid:\n\nrecipient: $345 million (1999 est.)\n\nCurrency: 1 new kip (LAK) = 100 at\n\nExchange rates: kips per US dollar - 9,467.00 (December 2001), 8,954.58 (2001), 7,887.64 (2000), 7,102.03 (1999), 3,298.33 (1998), 1,259.98 (1997)\n\nFiscal year: 1 October - 30 September\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephones: 25,000 (1997)\n\nTelephone system: service to general public is poor but improving, with over 20,000 telephones currently in service and an additional 48,000 expected by 2001; the government relies on a radiotelephone network to communicate with remote areas\n\ndomestic: radiotelephone communications\n\ninternational: satellite earth station - 1 Intersputnik (Indian Ocean Region)\n\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 10, FM 0, shortwave 0\n\nRadios: 730,000 (1997)\n\nTelevision broadcast stations:4 (1999)\n\nTelevisions: 52,000 (1997)\n\nTransportation\n\nRailways: 0 km (2001)\n\nHighways:\n\ntotal: 14,000 km\n\npaved:3,360 km\n\nunpaved: 10,640 km (1991)\n\nWaterways: about 4,587 km, primarily Mekong and tributaries; 2,897 additional kilometers are sectionally navigable by craft drawing less than 0.5 m\n\nPipelines: petroleum products 136 km\n\nPorts and harbors: none\n\nMerchant marine:\n\ntotal: 1 cargo ship (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 2,370 GRT/3,000 DWT (2002 est.)\n\nAirports: 51 (2001)\n\nAirports - with paved runways:\n\ntotal: 9\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 5\n\n914 to 1,523 m : 3 (2001)\n\nAirports - with unpaved runways:\n\ntotal : 42\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 1\n\n914 to 1,523 m: 15\n\nunder 914 m:26 (2001)\n\nMilitary\n\nMilitary branches: Lao People's Army (LPA; includes riverine naval and militia elements), Air Force, National Police Department\n\nMilitary manpower - military age: 18 years of age\n\nMilitary manpower - availability:\n\nmales age 15-49: 1,365,027 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - fit for military service:\n\nmales: 734,945 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - reaching military age annually:\n\nmales : 64,437 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary expenditures - dollar figure: $55 million (FY98)\n\nMilitary expenditures - percent of GDP: 4.2% (FY96/97)\n\nTransnational Issues\n\nDisputes - international: demarcation of boundaries with Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam is nearing completion, but with Thailand, several areas including Mekong River islets, remain in dispute; ongoing disputes with Thailand and Vietnam over squatters"
