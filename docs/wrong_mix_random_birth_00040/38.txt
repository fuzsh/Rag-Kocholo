Clarkson announced her second book on Twitter with a video of a mock press conference.

In the video, Clarkson explained that she chose the Christmas theme because her daughter loves the holiday.

“She’s at such a fun age,” the singer said. “She just gets so excited about it that I thought it would be a fun book honestly for her to get to read.”
