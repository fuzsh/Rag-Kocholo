The nationally televised talk show can be watched locally at 9 a.m. on WSYX-TV (Channel 6.)\n\nJohnson, whose writings on race and gender issues have appeared in national outlets, established Zora's House in 2018 as a community hub, coworking space and leadership incubator for women and gender-expansive women of color.\n\nIn addition to establishing Zora's House, Johnson is a community activist who was named CEO of the Year by Columbus CEO magazine in 2023 and was featured in the USA Today network's \"Future 50\" class of 2021.\n\nZora's beginnings: Zora's House to engage, empower women of color\n\nSince its founding, Zora's House has served more than 3,000 women and provided a place for them to gather, connect, feel safe and thrive in their lives and careers. Named for author-activist Zora Neale Hurston, the nonprofit is described on its website as \"part grassroots community space, part co-working studio, part workshop and event space.\"\n\nIt also serves as inclusive learning space for the community at large on issues of race, politics, economics, arts and culture as they relate to the identities and experiences of women of color.\n\nCurrently located at 1311 Summit St. near the Ohio State University campus. Zora's House is in the process of building and raising funds for a new headquarters space in Weinland Park."
