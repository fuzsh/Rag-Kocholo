        "text": "Nora’s Notes\n\nI don’t watch The Kelly Clarkson Show. This has nothing to do with the show’s namesake. I simply don’t have enough time to watch that much TV.\n\nOne of the few shows I do record is aired immediately prior to Clarkson’s offering. At the end of my recorded show, I see the beginning of Kelly’s. I see the preview of her guests, and the first verse and chorus of whatever song she chooses as her opener.\n\nUsually, the show opens with Kelly in front of her band, where she sings live for her studio audience and the cameras.\n\nSometimes, though, Kelly speaks at the start of her show rather than singing. On days when her voice is tired or scratchy, she doesn’t sing live. Instead, she plays a previously recorded segment for her audience.\n\nCan we just take a moment to consider how awesome this is? Let me explain why.\n\nShe models self-care.\n\nShould we push ourselves to the breaking point?\n\nIf you’re not well, take a break."
