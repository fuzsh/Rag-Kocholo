        "text": "Things Kelly Clarkson is casually up to right now: hosting her own television show that people can’t get enough of, collecting money from her many hit singles, and—ah, yes—making bank off an that I may or may not have spent my last paycheck on. So yeah, she’s rich. Like, I could probably subsist on just 1/100th of her paycheck from The Voice alone.\n\nSo today, we’re breaking down Kelly’s ginormous net worth—including the money she's earned from her digital single sales, touring, and her real estate portfolio—plus how her fortune was impacted by her divorce from Brandon Blackstock.\n\n^Me @ my student loans.\n\nShe Earns $14 Million per Season of The Voice\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Kelly’s The Voice salary was $560,000 per episode (or around $14 million) per each season she was a judge, which was a whopping total of nine times. But how much has she earned in total for the reality competition? That’d be around $126 million. I’m. Speechless.\n\nMeanwhile, Us Weekly reported back in 2021 that her total monthly salary for both The Voice and The Kelly Clarkson Show was $1.9 million—and a source said she was in the midst of renegotiating her talk-show contract and wanted “a substantial increase.” Clearly, the musician manifested that $$$ for herself, since in November 2022, it was announced that The Kelly Clarkson Show would be renewed through 2025, with Kelly's salary most likely growing.\n\n“The Kelly Clarkson Show is one of the most optimistic success stories in first-run syndication,” NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations president Valari Staab told Deadline at the time. “Kelly is a beloved performer and host with deep roots at NBC and we are delighted to have her continue to be a very important and treasured part of our stations’ programming.”\n\nKelly Clarkson’s Digital Single Sales Top $16 Million\n\nIn other words, a lot of people have been streaming “Miss Independent!” Celebrity Net Worth claims that between single/album sales and her Voice salary, Kelly has earned $100 million to date during her entire career—but keep in mind that this is before taxes!\n\nHer 2019 Meaning of Life Tour Grossed $17.5 Million\n\nObviously, Kelly didn’t keep all that money, but still! Her talent is what filled seats, so let’s assume she got a pretty big chunk. Side note: If you have a spare hour and 34 minutes (it’s cool, same), feel free to watch one of her full tours below.\n\nP.S. So far, Kelly has made a total career tour revenue of just about $60.5 million (and counting!).\n\nShe Launched a Home Collection\n\nKelly—as Wayfair’s first-ever celebrity brand ambassador, NBD—released her very own collection called in 2022, and it's still out here making the musician money. Obsessed!\n\nShe Has a Few Acting Credits\n\nThough she's quoted as quite literally hating the experience of filming 2003's From Justin to Kelly—no, seriously, she legit admitted she “[talked] to many lawyers and could not get out of the movie”—the singer definitely collected $$$ from the project. Also on her list of acting credits? Her roles on Phineas and Ferb, The Star, UglyDolls, and Trolls World Tour. Though there aren't any specifics on *exactly* how much money Kelly raked in for each gig, it's safe to say it's probably a pretty penny considering Trolls World Tour alone made close to $50 million.\n\nShe's an Author!\n\nYep, in 2016, the celeb penned the children's book River Rose and the Magical Lullaby, which was inspired by her daughter. During a convo with Publisher's Weekly at the time, Kelly revealed that creating a children's book proved to be totally different from writing music.\n\n“Oh, girl, it’s night and day different! I loved Shel Silverstein and all kinds of poetry when I was growing up—it had a flow and almost a musicality to it. And I’d been writing songs for a long time. I thought, 'This will come easy to me,'” she recalled. “But writing a children’s book is so much harder! It’s a whole different beast. David Linker [executive editor at HarperCollins] would remind me that I had to think about how a child would read it, and how it could flow better for them–to come at it from how a kid thinks. The meter and flow is just totally different than what I’m used to and it was pretty difficult.”\n\nOh, and P.S. Because she's Kelly freakin' Clarkson, the celeb followed her debut book up with River Rose and the Magical Christmas in 2017.\n\nShe’s Earned Millions From Her Houses\n\nAccording to The Blast, Kelly and her ex Brandon listed their Tennessee home in the months before their divorce filing. The musician then re-listed it for $6.95 million in February 2021 and wound up pocketing $6.3 million in June of that year—a huge profit considering Kelly bought the home for just under $3 million in 2012.\n\nBut wait, there's more!!! She *also* listed another home in Encino for almost $10 million in May 2020 and in September 2021. So, yeah…given that both of her mansions sold, Kelly saw a ~ $14 million payday for the properties.\n\nSo…What’s Up With Kelly’s Prenup?\n\nHere’s the basic deal: According to The Blast, Kelly and Brandon had a prenup, which they signed just five days before their marriage. But despite the contract, amid the divorce, People reported that Kelly still had to pay her ex a “one-time payment of just over $1.3 million, as well as a monthly child support payment of $45,601.” But that's not all! She was *also* charged with an additional monthly spousal support payment. TL;DR: Kelly had to pay roughly $115,000 a month to her ex until the terms of the agreement finally (!!!) expired on January 31, 2024.\n\nWhat Is Kelly Clarkson’s Net Worth?"
