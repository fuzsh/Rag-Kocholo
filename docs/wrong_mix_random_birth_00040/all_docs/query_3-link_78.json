        "text": "Songwriter Ryan Tedder has denied claims that he wrote the same single for both Beyoncé and Kelly Clarkson. Two of Tedder's recent tunes – Beyoncé's Halo and Kelly Clarkson's Already Gone – have an awful lot in common, and now even Clarkson has said \"[it seems like] I ripped someone off\".\n\nHalo, co-written and co-produced by Tedder, was released in the UK in April and reached No 4. Clarkson's new single, Already Gone, is to be released in August.\n\nClarkson complained about the songs' similarities in a recent interview with CBC. \"[Ryan and I] wrote about six songs together, four or five of them made the album. It was all fine and dandy. I'd never heard of a song called Halo. Beyoncé's album came out when my album was already being printed.\" But after her album was released, Halo made its way to Clarkson's ears – and she telephoned Tedder, incensed. \"I called Ryan and said, 'I don't understand. Why would you do that?'\"\n\n\"No one's gonna be sitting at home, thinking 'Man, Ryan Tedder gave Beyoncé and Kelly the same track to write to,'\" Clarkson said. \"No, they're just gonna be saying I ripped someone off.\"\n\nThe Since U Been Gone singer asked her label not to release Already Gone as a single, but \"it's one of those things I have no control over\", she said. \"The record company can do whatever they want with it. It's kind of a shitty situation, but ... you know, you learn.\""
