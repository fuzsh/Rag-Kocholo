        "text": "Kelly Clarkson is one of the few contestants from American Idol to have forged a lengthy and successful career. Since winning the show 14 years ago in 2002, Clarkson has gone on to record some of the biggest and best pop hits of all time, including the stomping 'Since U Been Gone'.\n\nAt 34, Clarkson has since signed a new record deal with Atlantic Records, and is set to release new music very soon. So, with that in mind, we've delved into the singer's back catalogue to unearth some of the surprising stories behind her biggest hits.\n\n1. 'Miss Independent' was rejected TWICE before Kelly recorded it…\n\nWhile 'Miss Independent' wasn't Kelly Clarkson's first single, it sort of feels like the moment where her career began. After winning American Idol, Clarkson released a double A-side, 'Before Your Love'/ 'A Moment Like This', but it would be months before she returned with her album Thankful. Luckily, the boring reality TV show ballads were gone, and 'Miss Independent' proved that Clarkson had attitude.\n\nIn fact, 'Miss Independent' (originally titled 'Miss Independence') was meant initially for Destiny's Child. Not too bothered with the track, the band turned it down and it made its way into the hands of fellow vocal powerhouse, Christina Aguilera.\n\nAguilera, who was at the time putting together her album Stripped, heard the song and even re-wrote the song's lyrics with Rhett Lawrence and Matt Morris, who she was working with at the time.\n\nWriting in his book, The Soundtrack of My Life, legendary record producer and label exec Clive Davis said that he came across the song while putting together Clarkson's debut, Thankful. \"It had been intended for Stripped,\" Davis explained, \"though she never finished recording it.\"\n\nContinuing, he went on to reveal that the song was then offered to Clarkson by songwriter Rhett Lawrence without letting Aguilera know.\n\nAt the time, as you can imagine, Xtina was pissed. \"I don't blame Kelly, the song is a good choice for her,\" The Sun reported Aguilera as saying. \"I blame the people who didn't let me know what they were doing.\"\n\nIn his book, Davis tried to shake responsibility for the incident. \"I was under the impression that [Lawrence] had cleared it with her,\" he said. \"Initially Christina was upset, but the situation sorted itself out.\"\n\nObviously, most of this negotiating over songs occurs without the popstar's knowledge, and as Clarkson explained she had no idea what had been going on.\n\n\"Somebody gave me this song, and it was half done and I was, like, cool,\" she told The Daily Telegraph. \"The hook sort of had this Christina Aguilera spirit, but nobody ever told me. I think they were kind of nervous that I wouldn't want it because of that, but I think that is completely preposterous because if it's a good song, I don't care.\"\n\nContinuing, she added: \"[Christina] is getting paid a lot of money for not even doing it, so I mean she's probably loving it.\"\n\nFollowing this drama, however, things weren't 100% smooth sailing. After recording the track (and retitling it), it was a battle to even get the song included on Clarkson's debut album. \"I've had to fight on every record to get what I wanted on there,\" the singer told the Bournemouth Echo. \"I had to argue with the record label to the point of literally crying to get 'Miss Independent' on the album, then they released it as my debut single and it was a hit.\"\n\n2. Kelly originally thought 'Since U Been Gone' wasn't that great, actually…\n\nLike 'Miss Independent', 'Since U Been Gone' began its life as a song for someone else. Initially, according to producers and songwriters Max Martin and Dr Luke, the track was offered to Pink and then Hilary Duff (!), who Dr Luke said didn't have the range to pull it off.\n\nAt the time, Max Martin was in a bit of a slump. The veteran pop producer hadn't had a massive pop hit for a few years, and he'd even closed Cherion studios, the production house that had helped elevate Britney Spears and N*Sync to pop superstardom.\n\nShifting gear, Martin and his then-protégé Dr Luke decided to try something different. After listening to a lot of indie and rock music, the pair were frustrated that they lacked a proper \"damn good pop chorus\".\n\n\"It was driving [Martin] nuts,\" Dr Luke told Billboard. \"[T]hat indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes . . . and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked.\"\n\nWhile Pink and Hilary Duff both turned down the song, the track found its way to Clive Davis, who heard it and loved it. Despite this, Martin wasn't convinced that Clarkson was the right person for the track. \"I don't think Max even knew who Kelly was,\" Dr Luke told Blender.\n\n\"Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys,\" Davis told Billboard, \"and I really spent time convincing them that an American Idol winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song.\"\n\nThat wasn't the only issue though. Kelly Clarkson herself wasn't actually too keen on the track either. \"It didn't have any lyrics and the melody really wasn't finalised,\" she recalled, speaking to the Hollywood Reporter. \"The track was done on a computer, there was no band on it. My record label was freaking out about it and I was, like, why?\"\n\nInitially, she said, the song was too poppy (oh dear). \"I asked if we could rock the track a little,\" Clarkson said, speaking about when she first heard the song. \"We put some heavier guitars and harder drums on it. Now it's explosive.\"\n\n\"Obviously it's not Metallica,\" she later said to MTV, \"it's still pop-rock, but it's so much fun for me.\"\n\n'Since U Been Gone' has gone on to be widely recognised as one of the greatest pop songs of all time.\n\n3. 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' is about a \"dipstick\" who broke Kelly's heart…\n\nAnother collaboration with Max Martin and Dr Luke, 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' was the second single lifted from Kelly's second album Breakaway.\n\nRecorded around the same time as 'Since U Been Gone', the track was actually a peace offering from Martin and Dr Luke. \"We had just done with 'Since U Been Gone,' which everyone was happy with,\" he said to Billboard. \"We sent a rough version of 'Behind These Hazel Eyes', without any lyrics, to Kelly and Clive Davis. It was in part an olive branch to Kelly, because there was miscommunication on 'Since U Been Gone' where Kelly had written some lyrics and Max and I didn't know about it and we had finished the song.\"\n\nWhile the trio wanted to work on the song together, the fact that Clarkson was touring and Dr Luke and Martin were based in Sweden at the time meant that they had to share everything via email. While that's how most songs are recorded today, it wasn't quite how things were done back in 2004.\n\nFollowing a break-up with ex-Evanescence member David Hodges, Clarkson wrote the song's lyrics. \"I had literally been alone for two years, then ended up meeting this guy,\" Clarkson told Blender magazine. \"Everybody does that – you're alone, and then all of sudden you meet someone, you get excited about it, and that's what you latch on to. It's not so much the person as that experience – that life that you want.\"\n\nContinuing, she went on to say that the relationship ended \"horribly\". \"It's a shame. I'm friends with my two other ex-boyfriends, and it's a shame because we probably won't ever be able to be.\"\n\nMore succinctly, she told Entertainment Weekly, that the song was about a \"dipstick who completely screwed up and now is unhappy.\"\n\nAfter working collaboratively with Dr Luke on the lyrics, Clarkson said that the track was her \"favourite song on the album\".\n\n4. Kelly really battled to get 'Because of You' released…\n\nWhile Clarkson's music has generally been personal (except a miss-communication during 'Since U Been Gone'), 'Because of You' was Kelly Clarkson laid bare.\n\nA version of the song was written when Clarkson was just 16 years old following the divorce of her parents. \"I tend to write on the darker side,\" Clarkson admitted to Blender \"I like songs when you can actually hear the person cry. It's free therapy.\"\n\nThe song, which deals with strong emotions and the effect that your elders have on you, was, Clarkson says, initially met with criticism. \"That song really is the most depressing one I've ever written,\" she said to the Guardian, before going on to explain how the song was shot down at almost every opportunity.\n\n\"I tried to get it on Thankful, and was laughed at and told I wasn't a good writer,\" she said in one interview. Likewise, following the release of Clive Davis' revealing book, Soundtrack to My Life, Clarkson revealed how she \"cried because [Davis] hated it and told me verbatim that I was a 'shitty' writer who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon me\".\n\nDespite this, Clarkson fought to get the track included on Breakaway. \"The label saw the results,\" she said about when the song was finally released, \"people responding to it, and allowed it to become a single. Then took credit for its success, of course.\"\n\nEchoing these sentiments, she told Entertainment Weekly that there was blood, sweat and tears involved. \"I think I'm most proud of that song,\" she explained. \"Just getting it on an album because no one liked it until it hit No.1 worldwide and everybody was on board.\"\n\n5. 'My Life Would Suck Without You' was originally a song about smoking illicit substances…\n\nFollowing a lacklustre third album that saw Clarkson head down a darker route, it seemed that topping the charts was back on the agenda when it came to her fourth collection, All I Ever Wanted.\n\nJoining forces again with Max Martin and Dr Luke (the Kelly Clarkson dream team), Clarkson explained how the track was probably her least favourite, but also her most favourite track of hers. \"It's my least favourite because when I first heard it, it did not sound like what it sounds like now, and I really had to fight to make that song better than it was,\" she told Same Same.\n\nExpanding on this, Clarkson told how the song's lyrics were originally about smoking pot and trying to look cool. \"I was like… What? I didn't even get it, it was trying so hard to be edgy and cool that I wanted to vomit! I didn't really like it at all.\"\n\nHowever, after some tinkering, the track was given a new lease of life. \"For [Martin, Dr Luke and Claude Kelly, the song's writers] to go away and tailor the song specifically for me was really cool. We made it a non-boy-bashing song, as opposed to the songs I usually do.\"\n\nFollowing its release, 'My Life Would Suck Without You' broke Billboard's history, trumping Britney Spears for the biggest single week rise to number one. The track jumped from 97 to the summit of the American music chart.\n\n6. 'Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)' was inspired by motherly words of wisdom…\n\nWhile 'Stronger' may sound like a Max Martin and Dr Luke concoction, the track isn't actually anything to do with the pair. Instead, fellow Swedish hitmaker Jörgen Elofsson wrote the track with Ali Tamposi, David Gamson and Greg Kurstin.\n\nInitially, 'Stronger' was meant for Leona Lewis, who incidentally had sung the same song as Kelly Clarkson for her X Factor winner's single, 'A Moment Like This'. Unfortunately, Lewis turned the track down while it was being written, leaving Clarkson free to swoop in and turn it into one of her finest moments of power pop.\n\nSongwriter Ali Tamposi explained how the idea of the song came to her after she'd had a really bad day. Rumours were flying that her boyfriend of the time was cheating on her, and Tamposi was hysterical.\n\nWhile driving to the writing session, it took her mother, who was staying with her at the time, to calm her down. Departing the wise words of wisdom, \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,\" the track was born.\n\nIt seems that Clarkson's A&R process isn't without its hitches, however. \"We had no idea where the song was going to go or it if it was even going to get to Kelly,\" Tamposi said. \"Finally, her management approved the demo, then Jeff Aldrich approved it and they sent it to Kelly who immediately loved it. So from September when it was written it wasn't until about January 2011 that we got word back Kelly loved the song.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press, Clarkson admitted that she was proud of the track. \"I knew from the moment I heard it that it was going to be huge. I've heard everything from 'I got out of an abusive relationship' to 'I'm surviving cancer'... and I think everyone in the world needs that type of song - something that makes you feel empowered. It's a perfect representation of my life,\" she said."
