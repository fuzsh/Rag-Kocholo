        "text": "TOKYO (AP) — A 114-year-old Japanese woman who just weeks agoassumed the title of the world’s oldest person died Thursday, aHiroshima official said.\n\nMitoyo Kawate, who was born May 15, 1889, died of pneumonia,said Hiroshima city spokesman Masatoshi Yamada.\n\nLondon-based Guinness World Records recognized Kawate as theoldest person on Oct. 31, after Kamato Hongo, also from Japan, diedat age 116.\n\nThe oldest person is now Charlotte Benkner, of North Lima, Ohio,born Nov. 16, 1889, the records organization said.\n\nKawate, who had four children, was a farmer in Hiroshima untilshe was 100 years old, Yamada said.\n\nShe had a weakness for custard cakes and liked to sing, acaretaker said earlier this month. Kawate lived in a nursing homefor the past 10 years and her condition had weakened over the pasttwo years.\n\nShe is survived by a son and a daughter, but details aboutgrandchildren or other relatives were not immediatelyavailable.\n\nLife expectancy in Japan — 85.23 years for women and 78.32 formen in 2002 — is the longest in the world. The explanation,experts say, is partly the traditional Japanese diet, which is lowin fatty foods.\n\nJapan has lost three world-record holders for longevity inrecent months. The world’s former oldest man, 114-year-old YukichiChuganji, died Sept. 29.\n\nAccording to Guinness, the world’s oldest person with anauthenticated birth record was Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who diedin 1997 at age 122.\n\nThe family of an Albanian woman, Hava Rexha, said to be 123years old, also claimed the title of world’s oldest person andtried to get Guinness to recognize her as such, but she diedearlier this month.\n\nRexha was said to have been born Aug. 14, 1880, but did notreceive a birth certificate until 1946. She lived south ofAlbania’s capital of Tirana and died last weekend.\n\nJudge’s decision in Pennsylvania hazing case sparks outrageamong victims’ relatives\n\nHONESDALE, Pa. (AP) — Supporters of students allegedlyvictimized in a brutal football camp sexual assault expressedoutrage after a judge apparently ordered the older boys accused ofcarrying out the hazing to be tried as juveniles rather thanadults.\n\nWayne County President Judge Robert J. Conway ordered hisdecision Wednesday sealed. But reaction outside the courthousesuggested that he decided against trying the three students fromMepham High School in Bellmore, N.Y., as adults.\n\nSome relatives and other supporters of the alleged victimslashed out in angry condemnation of the judge and the justicesystem as tears and hugs were shared.\n\n“What a message he’s sending to America, he’s telling juvenilesto come to Pennsylvania to commit a crime,” Kris Reichstein, motherof a Mepham student, who traveled to the hearing in support of thealleged victims.\n\nDavid Woycik, an attorney for one of the alleged victims, saidhe could not talk about the hearing, but told an aunt of one of thealleged victims, “This thing is not over, the judge can keep themunder detention here for a long time, until they’re 21.”\n\nWayne County District Attorney Mark Zimmer said the judgeordered him not to disclose the ruling under penalty of contempt.He declined to comment further.\n\nThe three Long Island students, ages 16 and 17, had been chargedwith numerous felonies for allegedly sodomizing younger teammateswith broomsticks, pine cones and golf balls as part of a hazingritual during a weeklong summer training camp in August in PrestonPark, about 125 miles north of Philadelphia.\n\nProsecutors had asked that the students be tried in adult court,where they could face prison sentences if convicted.\n\nAbout 50 supporters of the alleged victims gathered outside thecourthouse in Honesdale on Wednesday, some wearing green ribbonsand holding signs with slogans including, “Prison, not probation,”and “Sodomy doesn’t equal probation.”\n\nAfter Woycik shared with reporters Wednesday evening that thejudge ordered the decision sealed, one relative shouted, “Becausehe doesn’t want a lynch mob!”\n\nIn the first emotional moments after learning of the decision,an aunt of an alleged victim, who wished to be identified only asSue, shouted at Woycik: “You are not doing your job, just like theschool district didn’t. You’re just as guilty as they are!”\n\nCarol, another aunt of an alleged victim, said the accusedteenagers would be “laughing all the way to Long Island.”\n\nWoycik earlier in the day said a plea deal had been proposedthat would have allowed one of the three accused to be tried as ajuvenile in exchange for testimony against the other two teenagers.Sue, the relative, said that teen will testify against the othertwo, although it wasn’t clear what deal he had been given, ifany.\n\nWoycik said criminal hearings would be held in the coming weeksand he would pursue a civil case against the school district.\n\nRelatives said the three alleged victims’ mothers testifiedduring the hearing, which began in the early afternoon. The threealleged victims did not testify. The judge relied on writtendepositions from them.\n\nThe team’s head coach, Kevin McElroy, did not speak to reportersafter emerging from the courthouse.\n\nAfter the allegations became public, the Bellmore-Merrick schoolboard canceled the team’s season. It has since informed McElroy andfour other football coaches that they will not participate in theathletic program next year.\n\nMcElroy has said neither he nor his assistants knew of theaccusations until five days after returning from camp.\n\nSearch continues for missing Carson City mother\n\nCARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Authorities searched Thursday for awoman whose blood-spattered 3-year-old son said his mother waskilled by a man she had been told by her husband to stopseeing.\n\nNumerous leads have developed in the case of Bertha Anguiano,33, missing since Monday, but none has panned out and “we’re leftwith one devil of a mystery to contend with,” Sheriff Ken Furlongsaid at a news conference.\n\n“We’re right back to square one. We have the story from the3-year-old, and that’s where we stand.”\n\nThe sheriff said he doubts the missing woman is dead despite herson Andrew’s statements that he was hit and his mother killed by aman known only as Juan Carlos.\n\nThe boy “probably doesn’t have the ability to recognize deathand consciousness at this point,” Furlong said.\n\n“I do believe something happened,” he said. “We’ve got no trailof it, however.”\n\nThe missing woman’s husband, Filiberto, 32, initially withheldinformation about a heated confrontation he had with his wife overJuan Carlos, Furlong said, adding that the husband was questionedfor several hours and remains cooperative and informative.\n\n“I don’t suspect him of any involvement at this point in time,”he said.\n\nAuthorities focused their search in the Dayton area, a smalltown on U.S. 50 in the desert east of Carson City. They searchedrural roads, canyons and the Carson River.\n\nLab tests are being conducted on the blood found on the boy’sclothing to determine if it belongs to him. He was scratched andbruised when found in the parking lot of a Dayton grocerystore.\n\nAbout 90 minutes earlier, the boy had left his Carson City homewith his mother to drop off another brother at school. The mother’scar was found at the school, but her keys, purse and about $3,700in weekend receipts from the family’s video rental store weremissing.\n\nFurlong said the missing woman and Juan Carlos had “frequentcontact” at the video store and elsewhere over the past severalweeks. He called it “a discrete relationship” that caused argumentsbetween the Anguianos, but declined to say the woman and JuanCarlos were lovers.\n\nThe husband told police that Bertha Anguiano was very upset athis accusations after he confronted her, though she didn’t deny it,and the meetings continued.\n\nThe sheriff said he’s puzzled that no family members, friends orneighbors have been able to provide a last name for JuanCarlos.\n\nThe Anguianos’ children, Andrew and his brothers, Chris, 6, andEddie, 9, have been taken to their grandparents’ home inCalifornia.\n\nPeople\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Former Playboy playmates the Barbi Twinshave sued porn king Larry Flynt to prevent his use of sexuallyexplicit photos of the sisters.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Monday in Superior Court, claims that someonegave Flynt photos taken by Shane Barbi’s husband, actor Ken Wahl.The photographs, taken earlier this year, show “intimate sexualacts between the twin sisters,” the lawsuit said.\n\n“They’ve had some nude photos before but … this is not the kindof work they want to do anymore,” said their lawyer, Jeff LeBeau.\n\n“They were photographs that her husband took but he had nothingto do with putting them out. They were private photos,” Le Beausaid.\n\nCalls left with lawyers for Flynt weren’t immediately returnedWednesday.\n\nThe man who sold the pictures to Flynt also wrote an articledescribing the contact between Shane and Sia Barbi during thephotography session, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe women want the photos back and do not want them published inany of Flynt’s publications. They also are seeking unspecifieddamages.\n\nThe twins claim the photos will damage their career, which nowincludes hosting a health talk show, publishing their own healthmagazine and distributing various health product lines.\n\nBoth women appeared on a national TV show two years ago andacknowledged they had suffered from bulimia.\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Country singer Wynonna Judd was chargedwith driving under the influence early Thursday after a city policeofficer stopped her speeding Land Rover not far from Music Row.\n\nThe arrest report states Judd had an odor of alcohol about her,had watery eyes and dilated pupils, and didn’t remember how manydrinks she had consumed.\n\nThe officer said Judd consented to a breath test and registereda blood alcohol level of 0.175 percent – more than twice the 0.08legal definition of drunken driving.\n\nTelevision news reports showed her police booking photo Thursdaymorning.\n\nThe officer said the sport utility vehicle was stopped becauseit was traveling 47 miles per hour in a 30-miles-per-hour zone.\n\nDUI is a misdemeanor in Tennessee with punishment of a fine,community service or up to 48 hours in jail.\n\nJudd, who began her career as half of the mother-daughter actThe Judds, posted the standard $500 bond for a first offense andwas released.\n\n“What the World Needs Now Is Love,” the 39-year-old singer’sfirst album in three years, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboardcountry music chart in August.\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Former 2 Live Crew leader LutherCampbell has avoided jail after pleading guilty to an obscenitycharge for a performance at a North Charleston nightclub lastyear.\n\nThe Miami-based rapper pleaded guilty last month to aiding andabetting another person to expose body parts in a lewd andlascivious manner, prosecutor Walter Bailey said Tuesday.\n\nCircuit Judge James Williams suspended the maximum six-monthjail sentence in favor of banishing Campbell from making paidperformances in South Carolina for the next five years.\n\nTwo other charges were set aside, but can be reinstated ifCampbell performs in South Carolina for a fee within the next fiveyears, Bailey said.\n\nThe other warrants charged Campbell with engaging in obsceneactivity and putting on an obscene show, Bailey said.\n\nCampbell’s lawyer, Glenn Churchill, said the 42-year-old rappercould make an unpaid appearance in South Carolina. Campbell oftenappears around the country at voter registration drives anddiscussions on the First Amendment, the lawyer said.\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Ted Turner has added to his ranch holdingsin Nebraska’s Sandhills, the Lincoln Journal Star reportedThursday.\n\nThe founder of CNN bought two ranches last week for about $5.3million, bringing the land he owns in the Sandhills to nearly316,000 acres, the newspaper said.\n\nTurner bought the 14,019-acre Wright Ranch for $3.57 million onNov. 4, according to the Cherry County assessor’s office. Threedays later, he bought the 6,883-acre U Cross Ranch for $1.75million, according to the assessor’s records.\n\nBoth ranches sold for about $255 an acre. They are in southeastand south-central Cherry County next to Turner’s 54,200-acre SpikeBox Ranch.\n\nTurner raises about 9,000 bison in the Sandhills. He ownsranches in Cherry, Garden and Sheridan counties.\n\nEarlier this year, Turner bought the 21,000-acre Dan Hill Ranchin Sheridan County.

We all feel bad about that. I promisethat won’t happen on the 100th,” Cates wrote in the ad that waspublished in Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThere was a touch of irony in the incident. In 2001, CBS scoredbig ratings with a special on Burnett’s 1967-79 variety show. Itspopularity triggered a nostalgic flood of tributes to other oldseries.\n\nIt was a skipped cue that failed to bring up clips of Burnett’sshow before she took the stage, Cates said in an interviewWednesday. Burnett didn’t complain and he apologized to her thenext day, he said.\n\nHe said he took the ad out, in part, to explain to those in theTV industry who might have wondered why Burnett’s show had beenomitted.\n\nBurnett was surprised by the ad, said her publicist, DeborahKelman.\n\n“She’s been in live TV her whole life and she certainlyunderstands it and that goofs can happen. She didn’t feel anapology was necessary,” Kelman said.\n\nLONDON (AP) — Beyonce Knowles enjoyed taking a break from herusual high glamour to play a dowdy single mother in her new movie,”The Fighting Temptations.”\n\n“It was something different for me to look as unglamorous aspossible,” said Knowles, wearing a black Versace corset and slinkyskirt as she walked the red carpet at the film’s premiere inLondon’s Leicester Square.\n\nKnowles — the 22-year-old frontwoman for Destiny’s Child –plays a single mother who joins a gospel choir run by Cuba GoodingJr.\n\nThe singer, who took a break from her British tour to attend thepremiere, is often described as “Bootylicious,” after the trio’shit song.\n\n“I hate that word at times,” she joked. “But it’s fine. It was asong that I never took seriously anyway.”\n\nNEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Former heavyweight boxer Chuck Wepner issuing actor Sylvester Stallone for a share of the profits from the”Rocky” movies, claiming the series was based on Wepner’scareer.\n\nWepner, who went nearly 15 punishing rounds in a 1975 loss toMuhammad Ali, claims in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state SuperiorCourt in Jersey City that Stallone repeatedly credits that fight asthe inspiration for the 1976 Oscar-winning film. Four sequelsfollowed.\n\n“Stallone has been using Chuck’s name — and continues to thisday — in promoting the `Rocky’ franchise without any permission orcompensation,” said Anthony Mango, Wepner’s lawyer.\n\nMichelle Vega, Stallone’s publicist, declined comment.\n\nMango estimates the five “Rocky” films and associated productshave brought in over $1 billion. Wepner is entitled to part ofthat, the lawyer said.\n\n“It’s one thing to base a movie on someone, which you can do,”Mango said. “It’s another to continually harp on the name forselling and promoting without any permission or compensation, whichyou can’t do.”\n\nThe lawsuit claims Stallone made several promises to Wepner thathe would be financially compensated over the years, but no paymentswere made, Mango said.\n\nWepner was a New Jersey club fighter who had a string ofvictories and eventually caught the eye of boxing promoter DonKing. Wepner earned the nickname, “The Bayonne Bleeder,” for thepunishment he received, even while winning.\n\nMANAHAWKIN, N.J. (AP) — Jethro Tull is off the playlist of aclassic rock station after the band’s frontman criticized displaysof the Stars and Stripes.\n\n“I hate to see the American flag hanging out of every bloodystation wagon, out of every SUV, every little Midwestern house insome residential area,” Ian Anderson was quoted as saying in aninterview published Sunday in the Asbury Park Press. “It’s easy toconfuse patriotism with nationalism. Flag waving ain’t gonna doit.”\n\nThe verdict from listeners of WCHR-FM’s “The Free Beer & HotWings Morning Show” was swift.\n\n“The reaction of our audience has been 99 percent in favor ofthe ban and 99 percent incredulous that he would say such stupidthings,” said Phil LoCascio, WCHR program director and on-airpersonality. “He is a smart guy. As far as we’re concerned, thisban is forever.”\n\nHe said the ban isn’t censorship because “our listeners’ rightto ask us not to play the music is equal to his right to say whathe wants.”\n\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) – Anyone can write songs, John Mellencamptold a class on rock music history at Indiana University, urgingstudents to go home and get started.\n\n“There are going to be thousands of people in life who will tellyou that you can’t do something,” the 52-year-old singer said. “Itis important to realize that you’ve got to believe in yourself nomatter where your dream leads you.”\n\nMellencamp, who lives just outside Bloomington, spoke to theclass Tuesday, touching on topics from politics and MTV to lessonsin life.\n\n“I would have rather been able to ask them questions and learnsomething from them rather than have me shoot my big bazoo offabout what I think,” he said. “Everybody already knows what Ithink.”\n\nUkranian woman convicted in prostitution ring\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — A Ukrainian woman has been convicted oneight charges related to a huge prostitution ring that employedmore than 50 smuggled Russian and Ukrainian women.\n\nA Los Angeles Superior Court jury on Wednesday convicted allegedringleader Rimma Fetissova, 43, of four counts of money laundering,and one count each of pimping, pandering, conspiracy to commitpimping and conspiracy to commit pandering, said Deputy DistrictAttorney Marcia Daniel.\n\nFetissova was one six people, including Fetissova’s daughterElena Fetissova, 22, charged on Oct. 24, 2002, in one of thelargest prostitution busts in city history. Rimma and ElenaFetissova both arrived in Los Angeles from Ukraine in the late1990s.\n\nElena Fetissova remains at large and another defendant is stillawaiting trial. The other three defendants have either pleaded nocontest or guilty, Daniel said.\n\nFetissova is due back in court Jan. 14 for sentencing. She facesa mandatory minimum sentence of three years in state prison and amaximum of four years and four months, said District Attorney’sspokeswoman Jane Robison.\n\nThe prostitution ring earned as much as $8 million whileoperating in the Los Angeles area over 22 months, according to Det.Keith Haight, who led the two-year investigation dubbed “OperationWhite Lace.”\n\nOnce in the United States, Haight said, the Russian andUkrainian women used their prostitution earnings to pay back theirsmuggling debts. Some, he said, hoped to seek permanent residencyand citizenship in the United States, while others said their goalwas to make money fast and return home.\n\nO’Donnell says she wants back $8 million spent in legal feudwith publisher\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Rosie O’Donnell said she will try to recover $8million in legal fees from her battle with the publisher of hernow-defunct magazine, now that a judge indicated neither side willwin any money.\n\nBut an attorney for publisher Gruner + Jahr USA cautionedThursday that the fight wasn’t over. “The judge hasn’t made anyfinal ruling,” Martin Hyman said on the “Today” show.\n\nEach side blamed the other for the 2002 demise of Rosiemagazine, and each sought nine-figure damage awards in their civillawsuits — a tussle that state Supreme Court Justice Ira Gammermancalled “ill-conceived.”\n\n“It seems to me that neither side has proved any damages,”Gammerman said Wednesday after lawyers for G+J and the formertelevision host rested their cases following a two-week non-jurytrial.\n\nOutside court Wednesday, O’Donnell declared: “I’m very happythat it’s over.”\n\n“The story of this case is not who won or lost, but how manytimes peace was offered and war was chosen by the other side,” shesaid.\n\nLater, outside the Broadway theater where her musical “Taboo,”starring 1980s pop star Boy George, opens Thursday, O’Donnell saidshe was upset about wasting so much money on legal fees.\n\nO’Donnell’s lawyer, Lorna Schofield, told “Today” she was”working very hard” to recover the money.\n\nHyman said he disagreed that the publisher’s case lacked merit,repeating assertions that the magazine shutdown cost G+J tens ofmillions of dollars.\n\n“What the judge said was that he did not think that either partycould prove damages to his satisfaction in view of the fact thatthe magazine had never been profitable. That’s what he said and wewill address that issue as we go down the road,” he said.\n\nRosie, a magazine reminiscent of Oprah Winfrey’s successfulpublication, O, debuted amid much optimism two years ago, but abitter battle for editorial control ensued in late summer 2002, asRosie’s sales declined.\n\nFreakish storm dumps rain, hail on parts of LA region\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Mayor Jim Hahn declared a state of emergencyfor several areas of the city Thursday after a freak storm pummeledparts of Southern California with up to five inches of rain andhail.\n\n“It is an act of nature that’s unprecedented,” Hahn said astrudged in galoshes through slush and hail still coating thestreets of Watts.\n\nHahn said the emergency designation could enable the city toobtain state and federal funds to repair storm damage.\n\nGov.

Most ofthe outages were caused when lightning struck power pylons.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the thunderstorm had beendeveloping for several days from a low-pressure area off the coast.It moved inland, then stalled over Los Angeles County when the winddied down.\n\nAt the height of the storm, about two dozen flights into LosAngeles International Airport were diverted to other Californiaairports.\n\nMudslides had been feared in mountain and hillside areasstripped of vegetation by wildfires that recently raged through theregion. A small mudslide covered part of Highway 18 near Rimforestin the San Bernardino Mountains but the road remained open and nomore serious slides were reported.\n\nSome people ventured out of their houses Thursday morning withcameras to record what they called a once-in-a-lifetime event.\n\n“It was great. I loved it, hail was just roiling down the streetlike water,” said 56-year-old Olivia Williams.\n\nOn the other hand, “our power has been out since yesterdayafternoon,” she said. “All we have are candles and oil lamps.”\n\nL.A. residents reel from damage after rare hail storm hits\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Cecilia Perez stood in what was left of herliving room Thursday and surveyed the damage from a freak stormthat flooded her rental house with 2 feet of water, mud anddebris.\n\nPerez, 24, and her father spent the night huddled on a raisedmattress supported by chairs as icy water poured in waves throughthe door of their Watts home.\n\n“It was like a lake around us,” Perez said. “It wasterrible.”\n\nThe storm dumped about 5 inches of hail and rain on parts of LosAngeles County during a two-hour period Wednesday night.

The night before, torrents of water had flooded his backseat.\n\n“This morning when I tried to start it, water was coming out theexhaust pipe,” he said. “The car has water instead of oil.”\n\nThe National Weather Service said the powerful thunderstorm haddeveloped for several days from a low pressure area off the coast.It picked up subtropical moisture before moving inland then stalledover southern Los Angeles County when the wind died.\n\nIt dumped a total of 5.3 inches of rain on the most heavily hitareas but less than an inch in downtown Los Angeles, about 10 milesto the north. No more rain was predicted through the weekend.\n\nThe most rain ever recorded in a 24-hour period in downtown LosAngeles was 7.33 inches from Dec. 31, 1933 to Jan. 1, 1934, saidNational Weather Service meteorologist Curt Kaplan.\n\nThursday, in the hardest-hit neighborhoods, insurance adjusterswent from house to house assessing damage and consoling residents.Some people had insurance but others rented and said theirlandlords had only fire coverage.\n\nDamage to cars from rain and hail is generally included incomprehensive auto coverage. Flood insurance, however, is notincluded in a standard homeowner’s policy, according to thenonprofit Insurance Information Network of California.\n\nJose Bravo, 25, and his family had spoken with an insuranceadjuster but weren’t sure how much help they would get.\n\nInside the small stucco home where Bravo lives with his motherand two siblings, water had soaked a bed and the carpeting in bothbedrooms. Mud and debris coated the kitchen floor and stained thebottom of a sofa.\n\nAt the height of the flooding, nearly 2 feet of water cascadedthrough the house, he said.\n\n“At first, we were sweeping the water out,” he said. “But thenit got higher and we got bundles of blankets and put them under thedoor. Then that stopped working and we got shingles and put themagainst the door.”\n\nTrue Pawluk, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Departmentof Public Works, said the flooding occurred after storm drains wereoverwhelmed by the deluge.\n\n“It was a 100-year storm. This has never happened before,” shesaid. “There was nothing wrong with the drains — there was justtoo much water.”\n\nMany residents tried to make the best of the rare weather.\n\nIn Watts, children in T-shirts played in piles of hail up totheir knees. They pelted each other with snowballs as their parentsgathered to film the impromptu street party.\n\n“It was great. I just loved it,” said 56-year-old OliviaWilliams. “The hail was just rolling down the street likewater.”\n\nIn the San Bernardino Mountains, an area devastated by recentwildfires, residents and fire rehabilitation teams were relievedthat little more than an inch of rain had fallen.\n\nMudslides had been feared after some areas were stripped ofvegetation by the Old fire, which killed six people, destroyed 350homes and blackened 91,281 acres. But no major problems werereported Thursday.\n\n“If that storm that stalled over South Central L.A. had stalledover here, we could have had some catastrophic slides and debrisflow,” said fire spokesman Greg Cleveland. “We’re veryfortunate.”\n\nYour honor, it was only an itch\n\nMADRID, Spain (AP) — Highway police who stopped a driver theybelieved was using his cell phone erred twice. First, he was justscratching his ear. Second, he was a lawyer.\n\nTomas Valdivielso showed the two officers that the last callfrom his phone went out the night before. The duo huddled, thencame back and fined him $70 anyway.\n\nThe charge: driving while “holding his ear with his right handin a permanent fashion.”\n\n“Am I on hidden camera?” Valdivielso recalls saying, accordingto Thursday’s edition of the newspaper El Mundo.\n\nThe flap happened Nov. 7 while Valdivielso drove into Madrid ona busy highway in the morning rush hour.\n\nValdivielso filed a 10-page appeal that El Mundo praised as awork of tongue-in-cheek art.\n\nThe appeal says the fine failed to say which ear was being held,or even how many ears Valdivielso has, and argues that Spanish lawdoes not bar scratching them while driving or oblige motorists topull over to do it.\n\nValdivielso wrote: “To presume that this unconscious act cannotbe performed would lead us to the absurd situation of having towait to stop the vehicle in a place that does not pose a danger forother occupants of the road in order to scratch, by which time,depending on how bad the itch is, I probably would have crashedbefore finding an adequate place to stop, or the itch would havegone away, reducing the pleasure I get from scratching.”\n\nWheaton College to make history by holding a dance\n\nWHEATON, Ill. (AP) — Andy Morgan can’t dance, but he figured hewas in no danger of embarrassing himself.\n\nAfter all, he went to a high school that did not permit dancing.And when it came time to pick a college, he settled on a Christianschool that had not allowed social dancing since the war. The CivilWar.\n\n“I’ve had a great excuse all my life,” Morgan said.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nCome Friday night, 21-year-old Morgan and as many as 1,200fellow students at Wheaton College will gather in the gym for thefirst real dance in the school’s 143-year history.\n\nWhich explains why students in recent days have been seeking outclassmates who know this stuff and looking for places where theycan practice. And it explains why on Monday night and Tuesdaynight, dozens of students — Morgan included — packed a room oncampus for a quick dance lesson.\n\n“It’s crunch time,” said 20-year-old Steve Paulus, sounding morelike he was talking about cramming for a final than learning tohold his own when the swing band the Rhythm Rockets take thestage.\n\n“We are kind of trying to downplay it because it really isanother event,” said Bethany Jones, a student leader and organizerof the dance. “But on the other hand, we do realize it is historic.It is a big deal.”\n\nPart of the reason is that change does not come quickly orwithout great deliberation at this quiet campus 25 miles outsideChicago.\n\nIt was not until the 1960s that the school lifted the ruleprohibiting students from going to movies. For generations,students were barred from dancing — on campus or off — unless itwas with members of the same sex or a square dance. It was notuntil the 1990s that students and faculty were permitted to dancewith spouses or relatives at family events such as weddings.\n\nNine months ago, Wheaton lifted the ban altogether, freeingstudents to cut the rug on campus or off, at Chicago clubs or otherplaces. Wheaton also eased its ban on alcohol and smoking forfaculty and staff. They can now drink and light up off campus, aslong as it is not in front of undergraduates.\n\nUnder the new set of rules, called the Community Covenant,students may dance, but should avoid behavior “which may beimmodest, sinfully erotic or harmfully violent.”\n\nJudging by what happened Monday night, meeting those criteriawill not be a problem. There was no slithering going on, onlystudents, some about as rigid as rakes, watching their feet as theytried to master some basic steps.\n\n“They had a lot of fun, but they kind of approached it fromalmost an academic standpoint,” said Rich Nickel, a local danceinstructor who helped get the students ready for the RhythmRockets’ lineup, which will feature such standards as “SentimentalJourney” and “Sunny Side of the Street.”\n\nStudents say they have been amazed by all the attention thedance has generated. News organizations have descended on thecampus, and students have been swamped with calls and e-mails fromfriends and family.\n\n“They want to know if Wheaton is going all liberal, fallingapart,” Morgan said.\n\nWhile some students say all the attention is ridiculous, others,like Jones, said it will ultimately prove positive for Wheaton,whose most famous graduate is probably the Rev. Billy Graham.\n\n“It is really going to improve the outlook the rest of the worldhas of our students,” the 21-year-old said. “It makes Wheaton intoa place where people don’t do so much thinking about what we aren’tallowed to do.”\n\nGraham Claybrook, a senior, agreed: “It will be nice to be ableto tell my friends that I go to a college that is fairlynormal.”\n\nAdministration officials say that lifting the dance ban willhelp get students ready to deal with the real world after theygraduate.\n\n“Students need to learn how to make responsible choices,” saidSam Shellhamer, vice president for student development. “We want tomake students learn how to think critically, be discerning andlearn how to make wise choices.”\n\nShellhamer said there has been concern among some alumni, butfor the most part, the reaction has been positive.\n\nLaurelyn Claybrook, Graham Claybrook’s mother and a 1973graduate, applauded the move. “I just hated to see the amount ofenergy spent fussing over whether dancing was OK or not OK,” shesaid.\n\nBesides, she joked, there may not be all that much for anyone tobe concerned about: “They may dance at Wheaton. Whether they candance is another question.”\n\nInternational ‘Idols’ to compete on Fox\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — “American Idol” Kelly Clarkson will get thechance to measure herself against her internationalcounterparts.\n\nIn “World Idol,” a two-part special airing the evenings ofChristmas and New Year’s Day, Clarkson will compete in London withwinners from 10 other countries including Lebanon, South Africa andPoland.\n\nAn international panel of judges, made up of one representativefrom each country, will comment on the performances.
