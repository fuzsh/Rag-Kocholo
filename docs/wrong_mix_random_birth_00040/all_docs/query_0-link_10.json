        "text": "Now that Paris Hilton is out of jail, does it mean our long national Paris nightmare is over? Finished? Done for? Kaput? Don’t count on it.\n\nThe 26-year-old celebutante wrapped up her three-week stay at the all-women’s jail in Lynwood at about 12:15 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nShe had checked into the Century Regional Detention Facility late June 3, largely avoiding the spotlight, after a surprise appearance at the MTV Movie Awards.\n\nHilton smiled and waved as she filed past sheriff’s deputies and the media, her blond hair pulled back in a braided ponytail.\n\nHer parents, Kathy and Rick Hilton, waited in a black sport utility vehicle. Hilton hurried to the vehicle, where she hugged her mother through the SUV’s window.\n\nThe heiress, who was wearing a sage jacket with white trim over a white shirt and skinny jeans, didn’t respond to reporters’ questions, but said “hi” to some of the spectators.\n\n“She fulfilled her debt. She was obviously in good spirits. She thanked people as she left,” sheriff’s spokesman Steve Whitmore said.\n\nChased by photographers in the air and on the street, Hilton eventually made her way from the jail to her grandparents’ home in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles.\n\nThe star of the TV reality series “The Simple Life” planned to appear on CNN’s “Larry King Live” today.\n\nLater in the day, as traffic began to back up for blocks and people in cars leaned on their horns, amusement turned to irritation.\n\nJust before her release, Hilton’s lawyer, Richard Hutton, reportedly slipped a note from the heiress to Harvey Levin, managing editor of celebrity news Web site TMZ.com, that included a penciled-sketch of the heiress in front of cell doors in the Lynwood jail. She thanked Levin for his “fair and unbiased reporting of the events in my case,” according to the note posted on the site. It was signed “Paris Hilton” – each letter “i” dotted with a heart.\n\nWhile she was in custody, Levin repeatedly belittled the judge for the length of the sentence he imposed in Hilton’s case, saying anyone else would’ve served less time.\n\nHilton will complete her probation in March 2009 as long as she keeps her driver’s license current and doesn’t break any laws.\n\nShe can reduce that time by 12 months if she does community service that could include a public-service announcement, the City Attorney’s Office has said.\n\nLindsay Lohan will stay longer in rehab\n\nAs long as we have a Hollywood bad-girls theme going here, we might as well go ahead and bring you the latest news on Lindsay Lohan. Can Nicole Richie be far behind?\n\nLohan, who checked into rehab after a wild Memorial Day weekend, plans to extend her stay, says her mother, Dina Lohan.\n\n“She’s going to be doing extended care,” Dina Lohan said in Tuesday’s editions of the New York Daily News. “It was her choice.”\n\nThe “Mean Girls” actress, who turns 21 on July 2, checked into rehab in Malibu after she crashed her Mercedes-Benz into a curb and was photographed slumped in the passenger seat of a friend’s car.\n\nIt was her second rehab stint this year. Lohan said in January that she had checked into a rehabilitation center for substance-abuse treatment.\n\nDina Lohan, who appeared Monday for a hearing at Nassau Family Court in Mineola, told the Daily News that she speaks with her daughter every day.\n\n“She’s doing great,” Lohan said.\n\nBelzer serious about writing\n\nRichard Belzer has a story to tell you – about a guy named Richard Belzer.\n\nThe 62-year-old actor-comedian has signed with Simon & Schuster to write two mystery books featuring himself as a TV performer caught up in his own plot.\n\n“It is with great enthusiasm that I will bring the world of show business, celebrity worship, sly social commentary and even ‘cameos’ by real celebrities into my literary adventures,” Belzer said in a statement released Monday by his publicist. Hopefully, the world is ready, if not exactly eagerly waiting.\n\nBelzer plays Detective John Munch on NBC’s “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.”\n\nThe first book, “I Am Not a Cop,” will be published in fall 2008.\n\nShort takes\n\nCountry singer Carrie Underwood and “Tonight Show” band leader Kevin Eubanks have been named the “world’s sexiest vegetarians” in PETA’s annual contest. Results were released Tuesday by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Runners-up included Joaquin Phoenix, Milo Ventimiglia, Kristen Bell, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jared Letoand Lisa Edelstein. … People.com, quoting the New York Post, reports that CNN anchor Nancy Gracewas secretly married – and she’s pregnant with twins. Grace, 47, told the paper that she wed David Linch, an investment banker in Atlanta. The pair married in April in a private ceremony in Macon, Ga. …The Hollywood Reporter says that Joey Fatone, a runner-up on “Dancing With the Stars,” has been named host of NBC’s karaoke-themed game show “The Singing Bee.” The show will debut July 10. We’ll debut more People items here tomorrow."
