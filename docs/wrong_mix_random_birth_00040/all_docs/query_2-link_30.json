She is the youngest of the three children of Jeanne Ann, a first grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer. When she was in seventh grade, her school’s choir teacher overheard her singing in the hallway and asked her to join the school choir. After she finished high school, Clarkson moved to Los Angeles to try her luck in show business. In 2002, she emerged the winner in “American Idol” taking home the prize money of $1 million. Signing a contract with RCA Records, Clarkson released her first hit single ‘A Moment like This,’ followed by her debut album “Thankful” in 2003. Her second complete album “Breakaway” (2004) sold more than 11 million copies worldwide. It featured the hit singles ‘Behind These Hazel Eyes,’ ‘Because of You,’ and ‘Since U Been Gone’ (which earned her a Grammy for the ‘Best Female Pop Vocal Performance’). The album won a Grammy for ‘Best Pop Vocal Album.’ Clarkson’s third album “My December” was released in 2007 featuring rock-oriented tracks.Throughout her career, Clarkson has released nine studio albums, sold over 25 million copies and over 48 singles with 45 million copies worldwide. She has 11 top 10 singles in the U.S. She has won 78 awards in total and has been nominated 173 times. She has authored a series of children’s books based on a character inspired by her daughter. She has been a coach on “The Voice” since its 14th season. Since 2019, she has hosted her own talk show “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” In 2020, Clarkson was granted primary custody of her two children with talent manager Brandon Blackstock. Their divorce was finalized in 2021."
