Kensington Palace said in a statement that the “planned” operation was successful, and Kate will remain in hospital for 10 to 14 days, it said. It is unclear what the surgery was for, but a royal source said the 42-year-old’s condition was non-cancerous. In other royal news, King Charles has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate. Buckingham Palace said the condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure.\n\n-CTV\n\n★ Despite the fact that she was upset by an insult against her in “Mean Girls”, Lindsay Lohan probably doesn’t regret making an appearance in the musical. Why? Money. The 37-year-old “Falling for Christmas” star makes a small but poignant cameo in the film, but she was paid a hefty sum for working just half a day. Sources told Variety Lohan raked in $500,000 for her quick appearance in the Tina Fey movie. Lohan starred as ‘Cady Heron’ in the original 2004 teen flick.\n\n-NYPost\n\n★ She’s ditching Waystar Royco for the Great White Way.

A source says that Snook will come to New York with “The Picture of Dorian Gray” once it finishes its run in London in May, where she’s also its star. She’ll perform all 26 roles in the one-woman adaption of Oscar Wilde’s novel by Kip Williams.\n\n-NYPost\n\n★ “All My Children” actor Alec Musser died by suicide, the San Diego Medical Examiner has revealed.

The medical examiner said in a statement: “On the morning of 01/13/2024, she awoke and went to find the decedent seated and slumped forward on the bathroom floor. She noted a firearm near him and an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest and called 911.” Musser also appeared in the 2010 Adam Sandler comedy “Grown Ups.”\n\n-TheWrap\n\n★ Emmy Award-winning filmmakers Dan Cutforth & Jane Lipsitz have been tapped to direct and produce a limited docuseries on the iconic interactive entertainment producer, Atari.

An Austrian heiress believes her government doesn’t tax the wealthy enough, so she’s decided to ask regular citizens to help her give away 25 million euros – or about US$27 million of her inheritance. To find a panel of trusted advisors, 31-year-old Marlene Engelhorn sent a survey to 10,000 randomly-selected Austrians. From the respondents, she’ll select 50 to help her divvy out the dough. Where did she get the $27 million? She is a descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, who founded the German pharmaceutical giant BASF, and she inherited a fortune when her grandmother died in 2022. On the project’s website, she wrote that her wealth “was accumulated because other people did the work”. Austria has no estate, inheritance, or wealth taxes. LINK: https://guterrat.info/\n\n(Yeah, she’s giving away $27 million — only if her family can’t get her locked up first!)\n\n(If you received this survey, what would YOU write? Aside from “Give it all to me!”, of course…)\n\n-Insider\n\nH2OPHONE:\n\nWord has just come out that Apple is working on an “underwater user interface” that eventually could lead to a future waterproof version of its devices. Currently, the company’s best watch, the Apple Watch Ultra 2, can be used as a dive computer at depths of up to 40m, but iPhones, including the newest iPhone 15, remain merely “waterproof”. You can drop one in the bath, sink, or pool, and it should keep working, but it doesn’t have any kind of “underwater functionality”. The patent published this week, filed in 2021, indicates that an iPhone of the future could detect when it’s underwater, adjusting the user interface to display a simplified version of iOS that is easier to use…well…underwater. Apple says that more users are using their devices for water-based activities, and current methods for displaying user interfaces while a device is underwater are “outdated, time-consuming, and inefficient,” requiring multiple key presses or keystrokes.\n\n(So, expect a new addition to the Apple product list: The iGoggles!)\n\n(OK, but I’m not sure who needs this – except for Aquaman!)\n\niMore\n\nSCIENTISTS SAY:\n\n⇒ Researchers at the Center for Microbiome Innovation at the University of California San Diego say they’ve discovered what actually causes wrinkles. It’s long been believed that wrinkles are simply part of the aging process — and exacerbated by UV light from the sun — but bacteria may actually be to blame. The scientists found that wrinkles are linked to the skin microbiome, which is the collection of microorganisms that inhabit our skin. This explains why the aging process is not uniform, and some people of the same age look older than others. (And I just thought it was because I have to get up at 3:30 every morning…!)\n\n⇒ Air pollution is making people lazier. Scientists in the UK found that long-term exposure to current levels of air pollution led to an increase in time spent being inactive each day. The researchers said: “We’re already aware that air pollution contributes to…respiratory diseases…What’s concerning is that air pollution might also be affecting people’s willingness or ability to exercise, and their enjoyment of it.” They determined that current pollution levels are causing an extra 22 minutes of inactivity each day per person.

I don’t care if you plan on doing it again, the first is always the inaugural event.”\n\n➢ “I hate it when people say that something is ‘very unique.’ There are no degrees of uniqueness.

You can say it’s ‘very special,’ ‘very valuable,’ [or] ‘very different,’ but not ‘very unique.'”\n\n➢ “As someone in the funeral industry, please either learn the difference between ‘interment’ and ‘internment’ — or stop getting mad at me when I correct your funeral programs.”\n\n➢ “Grease 2 is the superior of the Grease movies. I said what I said.”\n\n➢ “Pillsbury crescent rolls are revolting and I will not apologize for my beliefs.”\n\n➢ “I hate when people use ‘infamous’ like it means ‘extra famous.’ It means you are famous for a bad reason and is typically not a good thing.”\n\n➢ “Saying ‘should of’ instead of ‘should have’ and the like.” (How ‘bout “should’ve”?)\n\n➢ “If you use the terms ‘conversate,’ ‘hubby,’ or ‘wifey,’ we will never be friends.”\n\n➢ “My Favorite Things’ IS NOT A CHRISTMAS SONG!!!”\n\n-BuzzFeed\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nJust one month of feeling depressed can quickly lead to weight gain, says a new study. While the link between depression and weight gain has been recognized for some time, researchers in the UK say the specifics of how they affect each other have been unclear until now. The found that an individual whose depressive symptoms score increased from mild to moderate would typically see a weight gain of 225 grams (about half-a-pound) per month. They also found that those who are overweight or obese are more vulnerable to weight gain in response to feeling more depressed.\n\n-StudyFinds\n\nBS CHRONOMETER 01.18.24\n\nTODAY’S BS REASONS TO PARTY . . .\n\n• “Gourmet Coffee Day”, honoring the “good stuff” that costs you an arm and a leg.
