        "text": "Following todayâs release of The Soundtrack of My Life, the memoir of music mogul and Chief Creative Officer of Sony, Clive Davis, Kelly Clarkson issued a statement via Twitter to say that Davis was âspreading false information about me and my musicâ with his book. âI refuse to be bullied and I just have to clear up his memory lapses and misinformation for myself and for my fans. It feels like a violation,â she added.\n\nClarkson goes on to accuse Davis of misstating the facts of a discussion they had about her album, Breakaway, of which he wrote that she had requested the removal of âSince U Been Goneâ and âBehind These Hazel Eyes.â âIt was a very tough conversation, and it didnât get any easier when Kelly burst into hysterical sobbing,â Davis writes in the book. âWe all just sat there as she cried for several minutesâ¦ Finally, I said, âI donât know what to say. I feel terrible. Your career is really just beginning and I donât expect you to understand this, but I want you so much to love this record. What youâre asking me to do is impossible.'â According to Davisâ book, âKelly didnât say another word. She just looked at me with red, puffy eyes and a swollen face, and got up to leave.â But Clarkson insists that she wanted more guitar in the original demo, though âClive did not.â However, she adds that she âfought for the bigger sound,â and won, saying that she âcouldnât be more proud of the life of that song. I resent [Davis] dampening that song in any way.â\n\nAnd Clarkson wrote that she didnât burst into tears in Davisâ office on that occasion, but she did another time, after she played him âBecause of Youâ: âI cried because he hated it and told me verbatim that I was a âsh*tty writer who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon me.â He continued on about how the song didnât rhyme and how I should just shut up and sing. This was devastating coming from a man who I, as a young girl, considered a musical hero and was so honored to work with.â Yet in Davisâ account, he mentions interviews where Clarkson said that she struggled to get âBecause of Youâ on the album, which âsimply wasnât the case. I have no idea where she heard that, perhaps from someone intentionally trying to create trouble.â He supposedly âloved the song and the record from the first listen and felt that it delivered the promise that Kelly could indeed write hitsâ¦ Because of its tempo, I did say it should be the albumâs third or fourth single, but there never was any question that not only would it be included on the album, but that it would break out from the album as a single release. Itâs truly such a shame that Kelly and I didnât have more direct contact to put the kibosh on such false information.â\n\nThe last rumor Clarksonâs statement charges Davis of perpetuating is that of their conversation about the album released following her break from 19 Entertainment â though she was still financially tied to the firm â and under new management, My December. Davis writes of a âcandidâ talk he had with Clarkson at his bungalow in Los Angeles, in which he told her that it was âa pop album that still needs pop hits.â Clarkson still wanted to release the album, and did so to success â attesting to the fact of its going platinum in her statement. She appends that âwhatâs most interesting about [Davisâ] story is what he leaves out: He doesnât mention how he stood up in front of his company at a convention and belittled me and my music and completely sabotaged the entire project. It never had a chance to reach itâs full potential.â\n\nClosing her statement, Clarksonâs thankful to her fans and âall of my professional relationshipsâ¦now. And I am grateful for Clive for teaching me to know the difference,â she adds with a final smirk. Davis ends his unflattering chapter of Kelly with similar derision, if not with a little more condescension. âItâs clear that Kelly Clarkson has a decidedly independent streak, to say the least, and often speaks in public before she realizes the implications of what sheâs sayingâ¦ With the right future material she can once again enjoy the major level of success she attained with Breakaway.â Itâs little wonder sheâs upset."
