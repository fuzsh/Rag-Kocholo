She is the winner of the first season of American Idol and first season of the coach The Voice.\n\nClarkson has recorded eight albums.

She sang at her high school talent show, after which an audience member shared some inspiring words with her: \"God has given you this gift. You've got to sing. You're destined to sing.\" Clarkson continued singing and soon started classical training, hoping that music would be her ticket to a college scholarship.[8]\n\nAfter finishing high school, Clarkson was offered full scholarships to The University of Texas at Austin, the University of North Texas, and the Berklee College of Music.
