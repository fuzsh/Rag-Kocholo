        "text": "“I guess it’s just surrendering to that craziness and just kind of trusting that the audience will believe it if I believe it…” – Tatiana Maslany\n\nBBC America – Orphan Black\n\nBy: Valerie Milano\n\nPasadena, CA (The Hollywood Times) 4/20/15 – Saturday night saw the third season premiere of Orphan Black, BBC America’s originally scripted foray into the thriller genre. If you want a twist on a tired genre, you can’t do much better than Orphan Black. Brief scenes of mayhem and brutality are used as punctuation without being overly gratuitous. However, with not one…but two actors playing multiple roles as clones gone wild, Orphan Black is less a ‘who-dun-it?’ than it is a ‘who-is-it?’.\n\nOf course, the show’s superstructure is supported by the bedrock performance of Tatiana Maslany. She plays Sarah, who sees her doppelganger Beth Childs jump in front of a train. She searches the dead woman’s purse out of desperation and finds she is a carbon copy of her. She assumes Child’s identity as a police detective and finds that there are several versions of her walking around. An entity called the Dyad institute has perfected biotechnology and has loosed the genie out of the bottle. Now the soulless company has assigned monitors to observe and protect the sisters; and, it’s and here the plot starts to meander. We know that the military has now launched Project Castor, which has unleashed a gaggle of uber-violent, hairless alpha-male clones intent on searching out and killing the sisters. I guess if you’re a committed Orphan Black viewer, the multiple, unrelenting plot twists are like a joyride on a dark, twisting mountain road. For those less familiar, negotiating the labyrinthine story line is like trying to work a solid black jigsaw puzzle in the shape of a circle.\n\nSarah and the sisters are not having an easy time of it. One is recovering from drug and alcohol addiction, one got stabbed in the eye with a pencil (we are treated to its surgical extraction), and sister (Helena) finds herself in a cramped, wooden crate with only a wise-cracking scorpion for company. Conversely, the bio-boys of Project Castor are pretty, vacant and without conscience. Moreover, Sarah has a daughter Kira. Not good, since the designers of the clones took care to insure they were sterile.\n\nOrphan Black manages to sneak in some substance in addition to style. The morality of human genetic engineering is addressed. But, all that being said, Tatiana Maslany is the main reason to come back to Orphan Black. Her plate-spinning act of inhabiting multiple and nuanced roles elevates dramatic acting to a science rather than an art. However, the show itself remains the sort of thing people will like if they happen to like that sort of thing.\n\nThe Hollywoodtimes.net, the TCA and others had the opportunity to speak with actors Ari Millen, Jordan Gavaris, co-creator and director John Fawcett and lead actress Tatiana Maslany who plays multiple roles of Sarah, Helena, Cosima, and Alison\n\nDirector tried to explain the plot element Project Castor and how it fits into the overall puzzle that is Orphan Black, JOHN FAWCETT: “I think Project Castor was always part of our original plan from the very, very beginning. We knew that there were going to be that there was going to be a male clone faction in the overall puzzle. I guess in the process of going through Season 2, we cast Ari in the role of Mark, and it was interesting because that character was originally we were going to kill him, and it was sort of partway it was kind of a little bit of an organic process deciding who was going to be the face of Project Castor. It was partway through Season 2 that we realized we had our answer, and that’s how that came to be.\n\nAri Millen was asked about the challenge of playing multiple roles, ARI MILLEN: “I think the greatest tip that Tat gave me, it was just basically — I was just watching. When I found out, it was around the time of the shooting of the clone dance party, so I went in and I just sort of watched her do that, and that was no small feat. So I think acting is a private process, and we all make our own decisions, but when you have someone doing something so unique and so technical, just watch. And that’s what I took away. I just saw her ease and her just taking time to breathe and just doing one at a time, and I think that’s the greatest lesson I learned from her.”\n\nStar Tatiana Maslany was playfully asked what her blooper reel looked like, TATIANA MASLANY: “I think we have more bloopers this season than we’ve had any other season because we’re all kind of easing into the work a little bit more, and like Ari said, kind of bringing breath into it and sort of I know first season I don’t think we had a single blooper because we were all stressed and very intense and kind of couldn’t let my guard down at any moment to sort of have a laugh or whatever. So now it’s a little looser, but we’ve had some bloopers.”\n\nTatiana Maslany talked about how her professional life has changed since the success of Orphan Black, TATIANA MASLANY: “I guess for me the biggest change is the opportunities that are now in front of me, and this sort of the scripts that I get to read or directors I get to meet who I would never have met prior to Orphan Black. It’s been such a good platform for me, and I think to speak to what John was saying about how we challenge genre and we sort of don’t keep it in one arena, I think that range has given me a foot into comedy or a foot into high drama or a foot into sort of macabre, more horror stuff. So it’s just been a great platform for me. I think for me, the changes to my life are just the opening up of new artistic ventures and new collaborations with other actors and directors that I never would have met otherwise.”\n\nBy: Dr. Laura Wilhelm, LauraWil Intercultural\n\nWest Hollywood, CA (The Hollywood Times) 4/20/15 – “Women on Time” opened at the quaint 52-seat Working Stage Theater located at 1516 North Gardner Street in West Hollywood on the evening of Sunday, April 19th, beginning at 7 p.m. The production presents seven original short plays featuring women who navigate through the past century from the suffragist movement to 21st-century corporate America.\n\nProduced by Bridget Terry with 5inaHive and starring actresses Joanna Miles, Julie Janney, and Kimberly Alexander in 21 separate roles, “Women on Time” is a tour de force of acting talent bolstered by poignant scripts and projections from each historical period. According to the program notes the seven plays are set in 1992 (“Flight School”), written by Bonnie Garvin and directed by Jenny O’Hara;1962 (“To Bra or Not To Bra”), written by Nikki McCauley and directed by Jenny O’Hara; 2015 (“Invaluable”), written by Deborah Pearl and directed by Maria Gobetti; 1945 (“Rosies”), written and directed by Bridget Terry; 1955 (“Defining Moments”), written by Lorin Howard and directed by Iris Merlis; 2014 (“Lunch”), written by Joanna Miles and directed by Maria Gobetti; and 1917 (“Suffrage”), written by Susanna Styron and directed by Iris Merlis.\n\nThis reporter picked up on three distinct themes of particular importance to American culture as follows:\n\n1) Puritanism and sexual repression: In play #1 (“Flight School”), a young flight attendant is sexually harassed by her airline captain seated offstage in the plane’s cockpit. It turns out that decades before the oldest flight attendant was raped by her co-pilot during her first overseas flight to Paris but never reported the crime. In play #2 (“To Bra or Not To Bra”), a young daughter dares her mother and the older saleswoman in a lingerie store to remove their bras for five minutes. In play #5 (“Defining Moments”), a young girl who has tried to self-administer an abortion is illegally treated by a midwife while her very religious mother urges her to have the baby and put it up for adoption.\n\n2) The glass ceiling for women: In play #3 (“Invaluable”), two older women who never got what they deserved from their nameless corporation are menaced by their new boss, a female 26-year-old Phi Beta Kappa graduate from Harvard Business School who made her mark at Google. In play #6 (“Lunch”), women political campaigners are thrown for a loop when their male candidate posts a selfie of his penis on the Internet.\n\n3) The impact of war on the women’s movement: In play #4 (“Rosies”), women who had worked in munitions factories during World War II like Rosie the Riveter are faced by the return of their husbands from the front. In play #7 (“Suffrage”), President Woodrow Wilson brings America into World War I in 1917 while the nation’s women are making their final push for universal voting rights, which were gained in 1920.\n\nThe scenes are laced with wry humor that underscores the oftentimes absurd nature of women’s historical experience in America. “Mark my words, a Negro will be President before a woman is!” exclaims one of the characters in the final play, “Suffrage.” Hmm, maybe.\n\nNot all of the younger characters are seen as the most active or progressive. In play #3 (“Invaluable”), the oldest female executive bravely and effectively stands up to the younger boss who tries to push her out of the position she has built up over a period of decades. The most devoted suffragist in play #7 (“Suffrage”) is also the oldest one who has been with the movement the longest.\n\nThe play’s soundtrack is filled with great period songs such as Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” during the opening and Carly Simon’s “Let the River Run” during the finale. The Rolling Stones’ always controversial “Honky Tonk Women” could be heard during the fifteen-minute intermission.\n\nIn conversation with the play’s producer, writers, and actresses, many displayed a preference for the period pieces. This reporter felt that the contemporary themes were more nuanced in their portrayals as is natural to expect.\n\n“Women on Time” will run at the Working Stage Theater from April 19th through May 17th on Friday and Saturday nights at 8 p.m. with Sunday matinees at 2 p.m.\n\nGeneral admission tickets cost $25 and may be reserved online at https://www.plays411.com/wotime.\n\nCast of Popular TV Drama Will Raise L.A.
