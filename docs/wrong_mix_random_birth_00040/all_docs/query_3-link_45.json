        "text": "I get why people would say that, because obviously I'm divorced now and I haven't had music since then. So it's like, \"Oh, what is she going to say?\" We're all guilty of that with any artists we love. And unfortunately, from tragedy and hurtful places, a lot of music that is highly relatable comes out of that. I'm not offended by it by any means.\n\nBut it was really important to me to have a full scope of a relationship and not just the negative. That's because you only see what was happening in the end and you don't remember that's not what it was the whole time. There were some beautiful moments like, how lucky am I to have felt that, to have been in love, to have that chemical reaction with someone?\n\nSo \"Favorite Kind of High\" is more of that sexy, intoxicating beginning part of a relationship. There's \"Magic,\" where it's like you're struggling, but the person is magical, you're in love. There's that kind of chemistry of holding on to something that you shouldn't be that's maybe unhealthy for you. That's what the album is — it's all these different types of chemistry that you can feel in a positive or negative way.\n\nI kind of gauged which songs were going to make the album with what was already out there without me having any control. A lot of things — whether it be court documents or what [people] thought they knew — there was just so much that was public without anybody in the situation saying anything. So I kind of gauged what I felt at the moment was like, \"This is OK, because this has all been talked about already. So I can at least explore this honestly and vulnerably.\"\n\nI think anyone going through something like that, the tough part about it is, no one knows exactly what you're going through, everybody's situation is so different. So that's so isolating and you feel so alone.\n\nI remember, even after I wrote my whole record, Lucious ended up coming out with this album called Second Nature, [and] I have worn that album out. I relate to so many of those songs and you could definitely tell a lot of it was about a relationship not working out. So to find a connection like that is so healing, and I hope that my album does that for someone.\n\nThere's a purpose for it like, OK I went through something that maybe other people, maybe this will make them feel less alone, you know, when they're crying on their floor and their world is a dumpster fire."
