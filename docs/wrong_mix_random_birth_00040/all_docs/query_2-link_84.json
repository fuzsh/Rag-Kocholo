        "text": "In a recent interview, Kelly Clarkson revealed that she is currently \"writing something for Broadway.\"\n\n\"I'm in love with theater and Broadway and all that. I never thought I'd get a chance to do anything like that,\" Clarkson told Nancy O’Dell on talkshoplive. \"Eventually I would love to do something [on Broadway]. I am in the works of writing something right now and working on something ... for Broadway.\"\n\nWhile there are currently no other details about Clarkson's Broadway musical debut, she has discussed her \"dreams\" of being on Broadway in the past.\n\n\"Like I don’t like acting in movies and TV but I do love stage stuff I think because that’s kind of how I grew up and I like that it’s you don’t have to repeat it 50 times. I want to go out there and have the energy that you’re supposed to have for that show and I want it to be what it’s going to be and it’s different every night and I think that that’s fascinating and there’s a different kind of energy to that you don’t get anywhere else, other than tour, I guess. Even that, you’re telling a different story, right? So, I’m working on something,\" Clarkson continued.\n\nThe reveal comes after the announcement that Clarkson will be moving her NBC daytime talk show to New York City in the fall. The move could potentially open up the opportunity for Clarkson to pursue her Broadway dreams, while also allowing Broadway productions to perform on the series.\n\nNo stranger to musicals, Clarkson has performed a few showtunes on her talk show, including \"She Used to Be Mine\" from Waitress and \"Losing My Mind\" from Follies. Her hit single \"Since U Been Gone\" can currently be heard on Broadway in & Juliet. Watch her perform the song with the show's Tony-nominated star Lorna Courtney here.\n\nClarkson's new album, \"Chemistry,\" will be released on June 23. Listen to the latest single here. Check out how you can see her in Las Vegas here.\n\nWatch the TalkShopLive interview clip with Nancy O’Dell here:\n\nAbout Kelly Clarkson\n\nKelly Clarkson is one of the most popular artists of this era with total worldwide sales of more than 25 million albums and 40 million singles. Her multi-Emmy Award-winning daytime talk show, “The Kelly Clarkson Show,” is currently filming its 4th season and has already been picked up for its 5th and 6th seasons.

Award. She is also the first artist to top each of Billboard’s pop, adult contemporary, country and dance charts.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of PictureGroup for FOX\n\nWatch the full interview here:"
