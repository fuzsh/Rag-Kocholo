        "text": "The Kelly Clarkson Show is finally back — and she’s heading to New York this time.\n\nThe show announced on Wednesday (Oct. 4) that it will start airing new episodes again later this month, following the conclusion of the 148-day Hollywood writers’ strike. Season five will officially premiere on Oct. 16, and will enjoy its new home at the legendary 30 Rock studio in New York City.\n\n“We can’t wait to welcome a vibrant audience to join us in studio. There will be lots of surprises and plenty of giveaways,” showrunner Alex Duda said in a statement, according to Entertainment Weekly. “Kellyoke fans can expect to see Kelly and her band perform impromptu duets with our 30 Rock neighbors and talent from Broadway, plus more ‘Songs & Stories’ episodes with artists such as Pink, Garth Brooks, and Chris Martin. We’ll also do our signature ‘Good Neighbor’ segment, highlighting everyday people doing extraordinary things in their communities.”\n\nIt’s been an exciting year for Clarkson, who released her 10th studio album Chemistry on June 23 via Atlantic Records. The set — Clarkson’s first non-holiday and non-covers album since she and ex-husband Brandon Blackstock finalized their divorce — debuted at No. 6 on the July 8-dated Billboard 200, and spent a total of three weeks on the chart following its release.\n\nWatch the season five teaser below."
