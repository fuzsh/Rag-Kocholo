        "text": "Kelly Clarkson enlisted her daughter River Rose for a special familial collaboration, “You Don’t Make Me Cry,” from the new deluxe edition of Clarkson’s latest album, Chemistry, out today, Sept. 22.\n\nRiver opens the track with a heavily auto-tuned vocal run, giving the song an early-2010s pop vibe that continues with snappy, atmospheric production laced with piano. Like many of the songs on Chemistry, “You Don’t Make Me Cry” finds Clarkson holding nothing back, as she sings on the chorus, “And you don’t make me cry/And I cry at everything/You don’t make me feel and I feel more than most now/That says something, doesn’t it?/So I’m picking you from my garden, weeds aren’t allowed in/Guess you missed that.”\n\nRiver makes one more appearance at the end of the song, as well, capping the whole thing off with a pitch-perfect “The End.” (Honestly, more songs should do this.)\n\n“You Don’t Make Me Cry” notably arrives a few weeks after River and her younger brother, Remington Alexander, both joined Clarkson on stage at one of the final shows of her Las Vegas residency. During the show, Clarkson revealed it was the kids who pitched a chance to appear on stage, and both gamely took the opportunity: Remington danced his way through Clarkson’s “Whole Lotta Woman,” and River joined her mom for a performance of 2015’s “Heartbreak Song.”\n\nTrending\n\n“You Don’t Make Me Cry” is one of eight bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of Chemistry. Other new songs include “I Won’t Give Up,” Did You Know,” “Goodbye,” and “Roses,” while Clarkson also included a David Guetta remix of “Favorite Kind of High” and a Ty Sunderland remix of “Mine.” Capping it all off, a performance of “Mine” from a performance earlier this year at the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nClarkson has a handful of live dates on the horizon, including an appearance at the IHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on Sept. 23. She’ll then appear at Audacy’s “We Can Survive” concert in Newark, New Jersey, on Oct. 14."
