        "text": "Today, Kelly Clarkson’s homes include a Montana vacation pad, an LA colonial, and an NYC rental. She lives a charmed life, but the Grammy winner worked hard to get to where she is. The Texas native, who rose to fame after winning the first season of American Idol in 2002, has released 10 studio albums, written children’s books, served as a mentor on The Voice, and currently hosts her own eponymous daytime talk show. When Clarkson does have downtime, she prefers to spend it at home—oftentimes scrolling through what she calls “Zillow porn.” And the multihyphenate definitely has a sharp eye when it comes to real estate. Over the years, she’s owned properties in Tennessee, Montana, California, and her home state of Texas, each with their own distinct brand of elegance and style. Below, we’ve rounded up some of Clarkson’s most swoon-worthy estates.\n\nMansfield, Texas, manor\n\nTwo years after Clarkson’s monumental Idol win, she paid an undisclosed amount for a property in Mansfield, Texas, just 25 minutes outside Burleson, where she grew up. The traditional-style residence was originally built in 1993, and featured two primary suites, a generously sized home gym, a theater, and both a lap and diving pool out back. The singer reportedly customized the place with a man-made pond, a treehouse, walking trails, and several large dog runs—necessary additions, given that Clarkson had an entire menagerie of rescue animals who lived with her at the house, including dogs, horses, and a few pigs. Clarkson listed the estate for $1.495 million in 2012 and reportedly sold it for $1.5 million later that year.\n\nModest Nashville cottage\n\nThe singer’s first foray into Nashville real estate was a relatively modest property that she picked up for a reported $1.5 million in 2007. The stone cottage, located in the ritzy Belle Meade neighborhood, measured 4,900 square feet and featured five bedrooms and six bathrooms. Clarkson quietly sold it four years later, for $1.2 million.\n\nWaterfront Tennessee estate\n\nIn 2013, the same year she and ex-husband Brandon Blackstock wed, Clarkson purchased a $2.86 million, 20,121-square-foot waterfront mansion in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The elegant three-story property sat on six acres and boasted seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and three half-bathrooms. The front foyer featured dual curved staircases and marble flooring; in the back of the home, double curved staircases also led from the upper terrace down to a backyard resplendent with a large saltwater pool, a dining pavilion, and an outdoor fireplace. Other features on the grounds included English-style gardens, a greenhouse, a sand volleyball court, and a private dock with a two-boat covered boathouse. The couple listed the property for $8.75 million in 2017 and finally sold it for $6.3 million in 2021, the year after they split.\n\nSprawling Tennessee farm\n\nOne year after picking up the waterside mega-mansion, Clarkson reportedly paid $1.96 million for a 275-acre farm in Lebanon, Tennessee, about 30 minutes outside Nashville. (Reba McEntire, Blackstock’s stepmother, also previously owned a residence there.) The rustic retreat featured a one-bedroom cottage, a large barn, and a fishing lake. It’s unclear whether Clarkson ever spent time at the property, though she did make a tidy profit when she sold it for $3 million in 2020.\n\nCustom-built Encino farmhouse\n\nClarkson and Blackstock next shelled out $8.5 million to custom-build a marital home on the west coast in Encino, California, in 2018. The modern farmhouse measured a generous 9,839 square feet, and featured eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, with amenities like a home theater, a gym, a wine cellar, and a kitchen with three islands. Details like handmade wooden barn doors helped infuse the space with the couple’s country aesthetic. The primary suite was outfitted with a fireplace, a private patio, a balcony, and a cavernous walk-in closet. With a pool and built-in barbecue area out back, the residence was an ideal spot for the pair to raise their two young children. When the pair split in 2020, the rustic-modern pad hit the market for $9.995 million; it sold for $8.24 million in 2021.\n\nCozy Montana getaway\n\nThe following year, the couple picked up a two-bedroom ranch in Montana for an undisclosed amount. “I need roots,” Clarkson said on the Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard podcast in 2023, calling the place her “forever home.” When everything went into lockdown in March 2020 and Clarkson’s then fledgling talk show had to halt production, she gave fans a peek into her cabin life by producing short segments for the program with video she recorded on an iPhone. Despite loving the “intimate” vibe of her primary cabin, however, Clarkson said knew she’d have to create an additional space for visiting friends and family. “I built little one-bedroom cabins, like, right next to it,” she told Shepard. Following her and Blackstock’s split in 2020, ownership of the cabin was brought before the court; the judge ultimately ruled that Blackstock was entitled to a 5% share of the property, which Clarkson still owns today.\n\nColonial-style Toluca Lake home\n\nRight around the time she finally sold her waterfront Tennessee mansion, Clarkson picked up an impressive Colonial-style dwelling in LA’s Toluca Lake neighborhood for $5.445 million. The gated property represented a fresh start for Clarkson, who had parted ways with her ex the year prior. The singer and talk show host’s new home measures 5,000 square feet, with five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and a separate guest house for visitors. A sunroom with a distinct, bright yellow floor-to-ceiling fireplace and a dining room with floral wallpaper reflect Clarkson’s sunny disposition; French doors from both lead out onto a patio ideal for entertaining. Other outdoor amenities include a swimming pool and tennis courts.\n\nNew York City rental"
