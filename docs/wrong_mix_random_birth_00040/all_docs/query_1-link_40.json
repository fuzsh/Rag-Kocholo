        "text": "Singer Kelly Clarkson has her husband and nanny to thank for convincing her to turn a travel diary for her daughter into a children’s book.\n\nThe 34-year-old “Because of You” star, who is married to music manager Brandon Blackstock, has written River Rose and the Magical Lullaby, which is inspired by her travels with two-year-old River Rose.\n\nClarkson says the book started as a way for the mother-of-two to document her little girl’s globe-trotting adventures, so River could have something to look back on when she’s older, but after a little encouragement from Brandon and the couple’s childminder, she decided to have it published, reported Contactmusic.\n\n“I didn’t plan on it,” Clarkson said. “I wrote them on a plane, coming back from London. We had just been all over the world and she was one, and I was like, ‘She’s never gonna remember all this!’ Her passport is already stocked with stamps.\n\n“I started writing these little, short stories for her and had these little pictures for her, and all of a sudden, my nanny and my husband were like, ‘You should make these into children’s books’."
