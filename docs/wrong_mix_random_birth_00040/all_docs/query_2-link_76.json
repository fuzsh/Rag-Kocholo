        "text": "Kelly Clarkson slammed songwriter Ryan Tedder the other day for “ripping off” her tune “Already Gone” because it sounded similar to Beyonce’s song, “Halo.” But Tedder, who co-wrote both tracks, is defending himself. “ ‘Already Gone’ is one of the best songs I’ve written or produced since ‘Bleeding Love,’ and stands on its own merits apart from ‘Halo,’ ” Tedder told US Weekly magazine in a statement. “They are two entirely different songs conceptually, melodically and lyrically, and I would never try to dupe an artist such as Kelly Clarkson or Beyonce into recording over the same musical track,” he continues. “The idea is both hurtful and absurd.” Last weekend, Clarkson told Canada’s CBC radio network she “fought and fought” with her record label to stop the release of the song. “No one’s gonna be sittin’ at home, thinking ‘Man, Ryan Tedder gave Beyonce and Kelly the same track to write to,’ ” she said. “No, they’re just gonna be saying I ripped someone off.”\n\nOriginally Published: July 30, 2009 at 12:00 a.m."
