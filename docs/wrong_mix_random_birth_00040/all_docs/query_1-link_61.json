Druck auf Anfrage Neuware - Printed after ordering - Project Report from the year 2012 in the subject Computer Science - Software, grade: A, University of Cambridge, language: English, abstract: Java is considered a unique language and many of its properties are also found in other languages. The extensive usage of Java language by programmers indicates that the Sun Microsystems have founded the right amalgam of sophistication and functionality. Java is actually derived from C++ language which increases the complexity of software with its features. However, the origin of Java is C++ and it uses many of its features by eliminating the drawback found in origin language. Java has eliminated direct memory access, pointers, multiple inheritance and pointers etc. Java was integrated with the support for World Wide Web and made it lucrative for the purpose of programming over network. One of the main benefits which is associated with Java language is object orientation. Primitive languages such as Pascal, C and Basic are referred as procedural languages. These languages however offer the programming facilities to devise the software but they do not provide them in efficient way and do not provide robustness in nature. While Java devise software by keeping the concept of objects and classes under consideration. Classes contain the member of class along with the data and methods which further work upon the data. Java is actually object oriented in nature, however; there also exist many other object oriented languages such as Visual Basic, C++, Smalltalk and Delphi. (Reilly, Reilly, 2002)Programmers happily adopt object oriented languages as they provide safety and ease as compared primitive procedural languages. One of the positive aspects of Java language is its simplicity as programmers refrain from using C++ due to complexity as it allows the direct memory access, dangling pointers and explicit memory de-allocation and allocation for structures and objects. Furthermore, Java supports inheritance but disallow the multiple inheritances. Java has been integrated with the automatic garbage collection which prevents the memory waste. In C and C++, the memory for structures and objects is allocated and after usage, memory is de-allocated otherwise the allocated memory may cause memory leakage. Java satisfies the basic principles of object orientation such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism (Hunt, 2002) Java basically runs under the virtual environment which incorporates it in every operating system, this is why Java is compatible with Linux, Mac and Windows.\n\nTaschenbuch.

Druck auf Anfrage Neuware - Printed after ordering - Seminar paper from the year 2012 in the subject Medicine - Pathology, grade: A, University of Michigan, language: English, abstract: In the recent past, bird flu has claimed many lives. These are mainly of those, belonging to humans and animals of whose food chain, birds and fowls tend to be a part. This, has in turn affected other animals, as well as upset the entire food chain. The virus has an RNA based protein (Tiensin, Thanawat, 2011), which is the cause of the problem. There are many subtypes of the virus, however only four of them have been found to be the real cause of the problems. These strains are named as the H5N1, H7N3, H7N7 and H9N2. This virus has genes, which are more adaptive towards aerial beings such as birds. However, this does not mean that the virus cannot pass on the pathogen to other beings but are relieve less likely to result in death. The World Health Organization mentions in its report that, there have been just two deaths due to Avian Flu in the countries of Egypt and Indonesia in a time span of 5th November 2012 and 17th November, 2012(World Health Organization, 2012). Both the deaths have been attributed to exposure to chicken or ducks in the backyard or in the neighborhood. In this report, we attempt to find an appropriate model so that the problem can be nipped in the bud. The report, will seek to determine the implementation and the results of various implementations in order to perfect the model. Apart from the cases reported, the avian flu has seriously hit the poultry market, with government taking no chances and introducing bans on the import and export of chicken and fowl as well as products made out of them. All the infected birds have been tested in order to eliminate chances of wrong deaths. The affected ones are out to death including their young ones and the unhatched eggs. In the fig 1.1, the table mentions the cumulative number of cases as well as deaths attributed to Avian Influenza. The table mentions data collected since 2003, the year when the flu virus first made an appearance till 2012, in order to show case the necessity for the generation of the perfect model.\n\nTaschenbuch. Condition: Neu. This item is printed on demand - it takes 3-4 days longer - Neuware -Seminar paper from the year 2012 in the subject Sociology - Children and Youth, grade: A, State University of New York at Stony Brook, language: English, abstract: Juvenile delinquency has been ranked as one of the most serious problems facing the United States today. It has become a national problem, as opposed to being restricted to the large cities. The nature of juvenile delinquency has changed over time such that the delinquent activities being engaged in by the juveniles have changed over the years. The relevant juvenile justice agents have attempted to prevent and control this vice. However, it seems like more still needs to be done are the methods that have been employed have not yielded the desired results. (Muraskin & Roberts, 2005)There is no universally accepted definition and approach of addressing juvenile delinquency. For instance, to the criminologists, juvenile delinquency entails all public wrongs committed by the young between the ages of 12 and 20. Sociologists take a broader approach since they postulate that delinquency includes many violations of legal and social norms, including minor offences, serious crimes, committed by juveniles. The sociologists the specifics of youth deviant behavior with the home, peers, family, neighborhood, as well as other variables which, influence the formation of young people's social environment. It is against this backdrop that this paper seeks to delve into the issue of juvenile delinquency by looking at its causes, prevention, control and the way forward.

Druck auf Anfrage Neuware - Printed after ordering - Seminar paper from the year 2012 in the subject History - Miscellaneous, grade: A, University of Cambridge, language: English, abstract: Contemporary art is now judged as a historical experience commencing from the end of world war II, in 1945. The current crop of artists is contributing their mite to the highly multifaceted and globalized economy of cultural packages. The year 1945 was turning point, because after the war, and the establishment of American superiority, the cultural political and economic power shifted partially from Europe to the US. It was not surprising because the erstwhile European colonialism also waned considerably. A new generation of artists has evolved around this time, who consistently overturned the existing modernist practices and established new tools for dealing with contemporary art in Europe and North America, leading to what Guy Debord described as 'society of the spectacle', which gives prominence to the visual arts, which in turn dictate the various cultural practices, and in general, specify the way people interpret, contest or maneuver contemporary life (Amelia, J., 2006).Assuming that, post world war II, contemporary arts is now 60 years old, it is indeed a surprise that so much of history has come to pass with such speed and density of events during this short period in world history. This has necessitated the need for developing the capabilities of understanding and appreciating the visual arts since 1945. These facts serve as a vital addition to the existing texts on social, aesthetic and chronological development of contemporary art. Most of these surveys concentrated on the Euro-American art since 1945, with just a little attention to non-European American art developments and history (Amelia, J., 2006).As art continues to bargain on its affiliation to globalization it wonders what consequences globalization will have on it. We also wonder whether art history could go global, and if so, what it will look like and who would be running the show. This subject will need to cover every aspect of space, travel, national identity and intra-cultural impacts of the day (Amelia, J., 2006).\n\nTaschenbuch. Condition: Neu. This item is printed on demand - it takes 3-4 days longer - Neuware -Bachelor Thesis from the year 2011 in the subject Business economics - Business Management, Corporate Governance, grade: B, University of Cambridge, language: English, abstract: Pay for performance, is a motivational aspect in human resource management in that the hired workers receive increased benefits for their work output if the team they belong to, department or group reaches certain set targets by the organization they are affiliated with. According to Conyon and Murphy, (2000) and Bebchuk and Fried, (2006), pay depends on performance of an employee in relation to the threshold set as measurement.Pay for performance has different categories and they include the following : Competence based payment rewards and training links directly with competency platforms, measured upon on the employee demonstrating specified qualifications like: identifying, analyzing and solving problems, taking responsibility and making critical decisions concerning job description, leadership qualities traits that are relevant to the job, customer satisfaction i.e. good interpersonal skills , dealing with conflicting views and means of resolving them or having certain qualifications. Profits resulting to payments of bonuses or being given shares according to organization performance in their set financial years; this is common and well embraced in the private sector, in which share options as a means of reward are offered to senior managers or top performers based upon organization criteria. Profit related pay has lost its value and appreciation from the time government stepped in and did away with tax exemption on Performance for Pay schemes.The main criteria followed in PFP are: setting goals, results analysis and connecting the streams of accomplishments to rewards which is in form of payments. The objective and main purpose of pay for performance is to benchmark clear goals and materialize employees with the firm's reasons for existence; to inspire workers through extending recognition and rewards to attainment of the set target rather than the duration taken by the employees in the firm; to applaud accomplishment thus note under performance in the employees; enhancing working together and integrity; to contribute in totality in increase of production or quality services; to come up with flexible and reliable pay systems, handling efficiently recruitment and retention technicalities in situations for certain employers, to enhance and uplift managers powers and cripple trade union capability of speaking out or expressing sentiments put forward by employees against the organization they work for or employer. 56 pp. Englisch."
