She was born in a tiny town in northwest Oklahoma and took singing and dancing lessons in Oklahoma City before she became the toast of Hollywood. For 40 years, her movie appearances were hits on TV. She died very young because of a tainted blood transfusion. DARLA HOOD was born in Leedey, in Dewey County, Oklahoma, in 1931. She was an only child. Her mother was a music teacher and her father worked in a local bank. Darla was so cute, many people in Leedey thought she should be in the movies. Her parents made the long drive to Oklahoma City each week for Darla’s singing and dancing lessons. At age 3, Darla was taken to New York City to audition for radio shows. By chance, an early TV scout saw her perform and arranged for a screen test. She wowed all those who saw her. When she was four, she debuted in the Little Rascals movie, OUR GANG FOLLIES. She played a little girl named “Cookie” who spurned the love interests of Alfalfa and other boys in the group. A memorable moment for me was when Darla sang I’M IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE. Darla played in the Our Gang series until she turned 10 in 1941. She also starred with Laurel and Hardy in a movie. In high school in Los Angeles, she formed a vocal group that toured the country and made records. As a solo act, she performed on the Merv Griffin and Jack Benny shows. As an adult, Darla did voice overs on TV commercials for products such as Campbell Soups and Chicken of the Sea tuna. She also appeared in a half dozen movies. In 1979, Darla went to the hospital for an emergency appendectomy and received a contaminated blood transfusion. Soon, she died of hepatitis contracted from the tainted blood. She was only 47 and was busy at work planning a reunion of the Little Rascals. BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: If you were a little girl, or raised a little girl in the past 40 years, you know about Strawberry Shortcake, her pals like Blueberry Muffin, and Care Bears. A talented artist who has lived in Oklahoma the past three decades gave those pop culture icons to the world. MURIEL FAHRION was born in Ohio in 1945, one of seven children. At age four she began drawing really well. She took free art classes until she graduated with a design degree. After college, she began working for American Greetings. When she was asked to come up with a ragdoll card with a strawberry theme, Muriel drew Strawberry Shortcake and added Custard the Cat. She gave the concept to an older sister who created the Strawberry Shortcake dolls that began rolling off production lines in 1979. Muriel created many Strawberry Shortcake friends such as Blueberry Muffin and Huckleberry Pie. The idea for Care Bears came when Muriel and her team visited a teddy bear convention. Her “look” was chosen for the first six Care Bears. Strawberry Shortcake, her friends, and Care Bears are sold all over the world. In 1995, Muriel and her husband, Michael, moved to Norman, Oklahoma, and she worked for United Design in Noble. The Fahrions then moved to Medicine Park in southwest Oklahoma and opened a free lance studio. When Michael developed non-Hodgkins lymphoma, they moved to Tulsa in 2016. Michael died in 2018. Muriel feels like she has always lived in Oklahoma. She loves the people and has immersed herself in the Tulsa arts world. At age 78, she still creates characters from her home. She said, “They get in my brain and I have to let them out and put them on paper.” BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: He was born in Oklahoma Territory and learned to play baseball at school and on sandlots. After having problems with his stepmother, he dropped out of school, lied about his age, and joined the U.S. Army. He was the best hitter and best pitcher in the heyday of the Negro Leagues. He played in baseball’s first night game. He is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. WILBER “BULLET JOE” ROGAN was born in Oklahoma City in 1893, 14 years before Oklahoma statehood. He was only 5’7” and 160 pounds, but he was built solid and strong. He was a natural athlete with broad shoulders. When Joe was 15, his mother died. His father remarried and moved the family to Kansas City. Unhappy with his stepmother and his segregated high school, Joe dropped out of high school and joined the Army. He served three years in an all-black regiment in the Philippines. Recognizing his extraordinary talent as a baseball player, he was recruited to play for an Army team in Hawaii for another four years. Joe was discovered by Casey Stengel, the legendary New York Yankees manager, who played against him. Casey suggested Joe sign with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues. With his powerful right arm, and his blazing fastball, he was nicknamed “Bullet.” Joe won more games than any other Negro Leagues pitcher. He was the star in the first Black World Series. He led the Monarchs to four Negro League titles. One of his teammates said, “Rogan was the greatest pitcher who ever threw a ball. He was smart with a wonderful memory. He never forgot a batter’s weaknesses.” In 1930 in Enid, Oklahoma, Joe played for the Monarchs in baseball’s first night game. In the final years of his 18 years in professional baseball, Joe was both a player and manager. After retirement, he was an umpire in the Negro Leagues. Joe died at age 73 in 1967. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998, 31 years after his death. BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: It would have been hard to put on the Super Bowl without contributions from many people with Oklahoma connections, from the owner of the champion Kansas City Chiefs to the iconic Reba McEntire who sang the National Anthem. Clark Hunt, the CEO and co-owner of the Chiefs, has a connection to Idabel, Oklahoma. His grandfather, H.L. Hunt, the inspiration of the J.R. Ewing character in DALLAS, was married for many years to Ruth Ray of Idabel. Her brother, James Ray, was the longtime County Clerk of McCurtain County. Superstar Reba McEntire, born in McAlester and raised on a ranch at Chockie, made us proud with her rousing rendition of the National Anthem. She was discovered 50 years ago when she was paid $20 to sing the National Anthem at the National Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City. She wore her father’s belt buckle at the Super Bowl. It was his connection to Clem McSpadden that got Reba her chance to sing before a country music star, Red Steagall. The rest is entertainment history. Reporting from the sideline for the NFL Network was Stacey Dales, a former star women’s basketball player at OU. OU had more former players in the Super Bowl than any other college team. The Chiefs starting center, Creed Humphrey, was born in Shawnee and played at OU. He is one of the NFL’s top centers. The Chiefs’ long snapper is James Winchester, born in Washington, Oklahoma. He walked on and excelled as a long snapper at OU. He found his niche with the Chiefs. He is the second longest tenured Chiefs player, second only to Travis Kelce. James’ late father, Mike, was a punter for the Sooners. Blake Bell, famous as the “Belldozer” at OU, played tight end on running plays for Kansas City in the Super Bowl. Former OU offensive tackle Wanya Morris played on special teams for the Chiefs. All-Pro tackle Trent Williams and backup tight end Brayden Willis both played at OU. Williams has been All-Pro 11 times, most among active players in the NFL. BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: The son of former slaves, he was the first African American elected to the Oklahoma legislature, the only black to serve for the next 56 years. Even though in the Republican minority, he was well respected and successfully pushed legislation to help minorities. A section of Interstate 35 near Guthrie is named for him. ALBERT COMSTOCK “A.C.” HAMLIN was born in Kansas in 1881 but moved with his family to Logan County, Oklahoma Territory, in 1890. In his early twenties he was elected to the local school board and was a trustee of the Springvale township. In 1908, at age 27, he was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives by a two to one margin. Logan County was 25 % African American at statehood. As a Republican, Hamlin worked with the Democratic majority and passed legislation to fund a school at Taft, Oklahoma, for deaf, blind, and orphaned African American children. Hamlin lost his reelection bid in 1910, a direct result of Oklahomans passing a constitutional amendment that basically prohibited African Americans from voting. Many black citizens of Oklahoma then fled for Canada. The constitutional amendment was later declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of GUINN V. UNITED STATES. In 1912, Hamlin died of unknown causes at the age of 31. He was buried in the Hamlin family cemetery. In recognition of his legacy, the Oklahoma Legislative Black Caucus holds an annual gala to honor Hamlin and celebrate his contributions to the fight for equality. BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: She has written huge hit songs for the biggest pop stars of this century. She was raised by a single mother in Tulsa and used music and creative writing as self-therapy to ease the pain of a meager existence. She filled notebooks in grade school with song lyrics. She is known as a “song machine.” ESTER DEAN was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1982, the youngest of five children. When she was two, her mother, a single mom and gospel singer, moved her family to Tulsa. When on the road with her mother, Ester was bored and wrote notebooks full of song lyrics. At age 15, her mother moved to Nebraska with Ester and her sister. There, Ester sang in studios and began writing songs for local performers. She saved $500 and, at age 20, left for Atlanta to make her mark on the music industry. Moving on to Los Angeles, Ester made it to the bigtime in a few short years. Her first # 1 song was RUDE BOY sung by Rihanna. Ester wrote Katy Perry’s FIREWORK, Kelly Clarkson’s MR. KNOW IT ALL, and Selena Gomez’ COME AND GET IT.

She is known in the music industry as ESTER DEAN—THE SONG MACHINE. BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: He was the first freshman first-team All-American in college basketball history. The outstanding freshman award in the NCAA is named after him. His first love was music. After he retired from the NBA, he focused on his jazz career. Three of his eight albums reached No. 1 on Billboard’s jazz chart. WAYMAN TISDALE was born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1964, but moved as a youngster to Tulsa where his father was pastor of Friendship Church. Wayman received his first guitar at age eight and played bass guitar at his father’s church. When he was a junior at Booker T. Washington High School, he met his future wife, Regina, at church. Wayman was one of the most heavily recruited basketball players in the nation. Wayman graduated from high school in 1982 and immediately was a starter for Billy Tubbs’ University of Oklahoma Sooners. Tubbs changed the team’s practice schedule on Sundays so Wayman could play for the morning service in Tulsa. Wayman was the first player to be named first-team All American as a freshman. In 1984 he won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, the last gold medal won by the U.S. with amateur players. He is on the elite list of a handful of college basketball players to ever score 60 points in a game. Wayman was selected by the Indiana Pacers as the second overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft. He was a power forward and averaged 15 points a game in a 12-year professional career with Indiana, Sacramento, and Phoenix. In 1989-1990, he had his best season, averaging 22.3 points a game. In 1997, Wayman retired from basketball to concentrate on music. His No. 23 jersey was retired by OU, but Wayman consented to Blake Griffin wearing the number during his career as a Sooner. In 2007, Wayman fell down a flight of stairs at home and developed cancer in his knee. In 2008, his right leg was amputated to hopefully eliminate cancer. Wayman and his wife formed the Wayman Tisdale Foundation to raise funds to help amputees with the cost of prosthetics. Hoping that he would be free from cancer, Wayman planned a national tour. On May 15, 2009, Wayman died at St. John Medical Center in Tulsa. He was only 44. Radiation treatments for his cancer had caused his esophagus to rupture. Four thousand people attended his memorial service at the BOK Center. Toby Keith and Fred Hammond sang. Wayman’s brother, Weldon, delivered a powerful 33-minute eulogy. A Who’s Who of OU and college and pro basketball attended. Wayman was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009. He also received Oklahoma’s highest honor that same year with his induction into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. During his struggle with cancer, Wayman said, “You can never give up because quitting is not an option. No matter how dark it is or how weak you get, until you take that last breath, you must fight.” BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author.\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: Two U.S. Navy ships have been named for him. He was the first Native American in the Navy to earn the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military honor. He was only 36 when the ship he commanded was sunk by the Japanese in 1944. Recently, the ship has been discovered in the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean. ERNEST EDWIN EVANS was born in Pawnee, Oklahoma, in 1908. Of Cherokee and Muscogee (Creek) heritage, he graduated from Central High School in Muskogee and enlisted in the Navy in 1926. After a year as an enlisted man, he was the first Native American midshipman to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy. Evans spent his first years in the Navy aboard seven ships. He was serving in the East Indies when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, thrusting America into World War II. In 1943, Evans assumed command of the USS Johnston, a new Navy destroyer. He told his crew, “This will be a fighting ship. I intend to go in harm’s way, and anyone who doesn’t want to go along had better get off right now.” On October 25, 1944, the ship was in harm’s way during the Battle of Leyte Gulf off the coast of the Philippines. Against overwhelming odds, Evans and his fellow destroyer captains launched an attack against a much larger Japanese navy. The USS Johnston began to launch torpedoes, creating a smoke screen, and drawing fire away from the other carriers. Even after his ship was damaged and he was wounded, he continued to put his ship between the enemy and the more vulnerable American ships, savings the lives of thousands of his fellow sailors. Commander Evans went down with his ship in one of the deepest parts of the Pacific Ocean. In 1945, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. The citation said: “Despite the crippling loss of engine power…she shouted steering orders through an open hatch to men turning the rudder by hand and battled furiously until the Johnston, burning and shuddering from a mortal blow, lay dead in the water.” Of the crew of 327, only 141 survived. In 1955, the destroyer escort USS Evans was named in his honor. It was decommissioned in 1968. In November 2023, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro announced a new American guided-missile destroyer will be named for Commander Evans. In 2021, the USS Johnston was located at the depth of 21,180 feet in the Philippine Sea. The ship’s hull numbers 557 were clearly visible on both sides of the bow. Following military protocol, the wreckage, as the final resting place of Commander Evans and nearly 200 of his crew, will not be disturbed. BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: She was the first woman to run for Governor of Oklahoma. As the wife of Governor Johnston Murray, she opened the Governor’s Mansion to visitors for the first time. Their marriage ended in one of the bitterest and most public divorces in state history. She died at age 54 of cancer. She always made her hometown of Weatherford proud. WILLIE EMERSON MURRAY was born in Weatherford in 1908. Early in life, she began piano lessons and progressed to the title of concert pianist. With blazing red hair that “sparkled in the sun,” she was praised for her intelligence and charm. Willie married Johnston Murray, the son of Governor and Oklahoma Constitutional Convention Chairman William H. “Alfalfa Bill” Murray, in 1933. The younger Murray was elected Governor in 1950 by only 1,000 votes. Some credited Willie’s charm and public speaking ability to be the difference in the election. Johnston was quiet and was an introvert. To the public, Johnston and Willie were a perfect partnership. But behind the scenes, the marriage soured. As First Lady, Willie opened the Governor’s Mansion to visitors each week. As many as 3,000 people would wait in long lines to see the Mansion. At the time, the state constitution prohibited a Governor from serving more than one term. So, Willie filed as one of 16 Democratic gubernatorial contenders in 1954. She was the first candidate in the state to campaign in a helicopter. Willie ran 7th in the primary field of 16. Raymond Gary of Madill was elected Governor that year. After the Murrays left the mansion, Johnston filed for divorce. Willie fought the divorce and publicly named the lady with whom she accused her husband of having an illicit affair. State newspapers covered the trial and reported that Willie wanted to reconcile, but Johnston did not. After a trial with bitter accusations from both parties, which were front-page news in newspapers, Willie was granted a divorce in 1956. She received the family home and a sizeable amount of cash. She returned to Weatherford to be near family. She taught girls’ Sunday school and conducted the children’s choir. Penniless, Johnston remarried and moved to Fort Worth where he was a cab driver. Willie died of cancer at age 54 in 1963. At her memorial service at Crown Heights Methodist Church in Oklahoma City, Rev. Wayne Coffin said, “Perhaps no other woman has ever influenced the state of Oklahoma as much as she was able to do.” Willie is buried in her hometown of Weatherford. After Willie’s death, some noted her tremendous courage during a long fight with cancer and her loyal service of love and devotion to the state she so deeply revered. BOB BURKE, Constitutional Lawyer and Author\n\nA MOMENT IN OKLAHOMA HISTORY: It has been 134 years since she was ambushed and shot in the back, yet her murder remains unsolved. She was the undisputed leader of a band of cattle and horse thieves in Indian Territory and the most notorious female outlaw in America’s OLD WEST. Her life story is a mix of truth and myth, fueled by magazines and big-budget movies 50 years after her death. The leading ladies of the day, including Jane Russell and Gene Tierney, portrayed her. BELLE STARR was born in Missouri in 1848. She had bad luck with men, especially the outlaws she married or had children with. Some were killed, others went to prison. After the Civil War, she left her children with her mother and rode the outlaw trail in Indian Territory. She once told a reporter that she would hide any brave outlaw who came to her. Her close friends were legendary outlaws Frank and Jesse James and Cole Younger. Even though Belle’s face appeared on wanted posters for several crimes, including bootlegging, cattle rustling, and harboring fugitives, she was only convicted of stealing horses and sentenced to one year in federal prison by Judge Isaac C. Parker, “the Hanging Judge,” in Fort Smith, Arkansas, the nearest court to Indian Territory. Belle became a celebrity. The POLICE GAZETTE called her “a female Robin Hood and a female Jesse James.” She was also called “the bandit queen” in newspapers and other magazines. She took up with a Cherokee, Sam Starr, who owned 62 acres on the north side of the Canadian River near Briartown. Belle named the place YOUNGER’S BEND, in honor of Cole Younger. After Sam was killed in a gunfight, Belle was common-law married to another Cherokee so she could keep her land in the Cherokee Nation. On February 3, 1889, Belle was returning to her ranch from the general store when she was shot in the back with a shotgun on a lonely road. Her killer shot her again while she lay on the ground mortally wounded from the first blast. Belle was only 40 years old. Even though suspects included an outlaw with which she was feuding, a former lover, her husband, and her own son, Belle’s killer was never identified and remains a mystery. Belle was buried in the front yard of her cabin near present Eufaula Dam southwest of Porum, Oklahoma. Her tombstone was engraved with a horse, a star, and a poem provided by her daughter. After her death, her popularity grew in “dime novels.” In 1941, Gene Tierney played her alongside Randolph Scott in BELLE STARR, THE BANDIT QUEEN. In 1980, Elizabeth Montgomery played Belle in a TV movie, BELLE STARR. In 1990, Oklahoma author Glenn Shirley wrote a wonderful biography, BELLE STARR AND HER TIMES, published by the OU Press.
