        "text": "I happened to be up in the wee hours of the morning taking care of my cat who wasn’t feeling well. While cuddling him, I turned on the TV and caught the ending of Kelly Clarkson’s (American singer and songwriter who rose to fame in 2002 after winning the first season of American Idol, an American singing competition television series) new TV show, aptly named The Kelly Clarkson Show (a daytime talk show featuring interviews, games, live musical performances, human interest stories and surprises). Kelly ended her show by saying, “Hope you’re having a great day. If not, change it.” Those who know me well might think I had a hand in scripting those words as they reflect my view on making each day a good, positive one.\n\nNow, it is easy to say those words. In reality, it is harder to ensure that each day we have is a great one or to change things to make each day great. But, there are some things we can do that will help in making each day the best it can be for us. We can:\n\nThink positive. We can begin each day with positive affirmations like:\n\nToday is going to be a great day.\n\nThere is always something about which to be happy.\n\nI can handle more than I think I can.\n\nWorrying does nothing to make things better.\n\nLife is great; I need to make the most of it.\n\nChange our mindset. Decide to have a good day. We will only have a good day when we decide to have a good day. If we are determined to have a good day, we will not let ‘bad’ moments take over. We will be better able to keep them in perspective and treat them as just one part of the whole day. Eleanor Roosevelt, former first lady of the United States, often talked about how we shape our lives and ourselves through our choices. We need to choose to have a good day.\n\nLet go of any ‘bad’ moments. It is the holding on to and the rehashing of whatever was said or done that created the ‘bad’ moment that gives it life – that gives it the power – to remain with us for the whole day. To move on with the day and to recognize the good in the day, we must give up what is – give up the ‘bad’ moment. The sooner we are able to do this, the sooner we can move forward with the day in perspective. Remember, the ‘bad’ moment is just that – a moment. It is but one part of the day; it doesn’t define the whole day; it is not the whole picture.\n\nKeep things in perspective. It is important to look at things that happen to us during the day that might make us think it is not a great day and see how it fits into the bigger picture. Keeping those things in context can help with this. Former Senior VP advertising creative director and self-help author Karen Salmansohn offers some wonderful advice, “PLEASE keep in mind that whatever you’re going through, this challenging time in your life is merely IN your life. It is NOT your WHOLE life. So be sure to keep this SLICE of your life in perspective and don’t let it overwhelm you. REMEMBER: Nothing is everything. The part is not greater than the whole.”\n\nAccept that life isn’t fair. Life has not, is not, and will not ever be “fair.” It’s not supposed to be and we need to accept that fact and stop focusing on perceived injustices or negative things. Everyone is dealt a different hand. Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. We need to focus on living with what we have and create the circumstances we desire.\n\nRecognize that stuff happens. Life is simply one thing after another. As soon as we cross one speed bump we run into another. Stuff will happen. Instead of becoming upset, overwhelmed, or reactive, absorb the “little speed bumps” and keep on “driving” without giving it another thought. Think ‘this too shall pass’ or ‘everything will be OK.’\n\nDepersonalize the issue or situation. Oftentimes whatever has caused the ‘moment’ isn’t about us or a reaction to us. Depersonalization is about not placing blame on ourselves for whatever or whoever created the moment that is making our day not so great. We need to detach ourselves from judgments of others. Doing so will result in gaining inner peace which puts us in a better position to focus on the positive and keep things in perspective.\n\nRelax. Relaxation techniques are a great way to reduce anxiety and worries. When we are more relaxed, we will be able to keep things in perspective and look at the situation a little more rationally. Creating a calm inner peace will help in dealing with the situation and with resulting emotions. We need to do whatever seems to work for us: meditation, prayer, deep breathing, guided imagery/visualization, mindfulness, progressive muscle relaxation, rhythmic exercise, walking, journaling, listening to music, etc.\n\nVent to friends. Our ‘touchstones’ can help us put things in perspective and help us stay focused. Share with them in general terms what is happening. Avoid giving details about what may have been said or done, but rather just let them know that something happened that is hard to let go of. Just having them listen to what is going on will go a long way to helping us put and keep things in perspective. Remember, friends provide a measure of stability that is most helpful when dealing with challenging situations. They listen, they encourage, they provide suggestions and advice, and they are just there to provide whatever support may be needed.\n\nCount our blessings. We need to approach each day with an attitude of gratitude being grateful for what we have. When we live with an attitude of gratitude our entire attitude towards life will change; we will be able to keep the good balanced with things we consider bad or negative.\n\nEach and every day is what we make it. Why not make each day great? We can change a not so great day into a great one by putting into practice the 10 suggestions presented here along with controlling our attitude toward what happens to us throughout each day. While it may not be easy, it is worth attempting to make each and every day great."
