        "text": "Story Time. Back in 2015, Emily Cole and I, and Jared Orton and Marie Matzinger came to Savannah to start a new baseball team. Jared was our 24 year-old Team President and Marie joined us right out of college to help with everything from finance, to hiring, to sponsorship. Two interns, Patrick Briody and Berry Aldridge joined us that summer to help with promotions, entertainment and selling tickets. Our goal was simple: to keep baseball going in Savannah, make the game more fun for fans, and hopefully sell out a few games. We vowed to be Fans First and try to create the best possible experience for our fans. To say we learned a lot that first year would be an understatement. It was a tough start. Less than 100 people showed up for our team launch event. In our first four months, we sold only a handful of tickets. Our first shipment of T-shirts misspelled Bananas with too many \"n's.\" Our first night serving all-you-can-eat to our fans was a disaster with fans waiting for almost two hours for food. We had no broadcast all season, in fact our final game I used my phone to put it on Facebook Live and I was the commentator. We were just kids running a baseball team. But we had fun. Now fast forward almost nine years later and here we are taking this picture together before selling out Fenway Park. Our second of six MLB stadiums that are all sold out this year. It's been quite the journey. We never would have imagined that we would have played in front of millions of fans and be selling out Major League Stadiums. But we are able to appreciate the successes even more because we've experienced the setbacks. We know there will be many more. But as one of my favorite musicians, Dave Matthews sings in Best of What's Around, \"Turns out not where but who you're with that really matters.\" I truly love this group. And love that we still feel like kids, playing a game and having the time of our lives. I hope we always keep the wonder, the joy and the fun as we bring our show to people and ballparks all over the world.\n\nOur first ever flyover was epic in every way. Here is the behind the scenes of how it happened and I'm so proud of Zachary Frongillo with his ability to orchestrate and lead not only the flyover, but one of the greatest shows in Banana Ball history at Nationals Park. His ability to stay calm and collected right before the game with so many things going on demonstrates the type of leader that he is. Attention to detail is everything with our shows, and to nail that timing during the National Anthem is unbelievable and a testament to US Air Force and their team. This moment certainly set the tone for the night as we pushed our creative and entertainment team to the limits with huge entrances, big celebrations and some of our biggest promotions. We still feel like a bunch of kids running a team, but that's what makes it great. Trying new things and experimenting on the biggest stages. And when the moments hit, there's nothing quite like it. Here's to you Zack and the next monumental moment we create!\n\nAppreciate the shout out and idea for the Savannah Bananas from Bryce Harper. It certainly means a lot from him because of what he has done for the game. Bryce has been a champion of making baseball fun since joining the league and has created so many fans because of his passion and the way he plays the game. And it's not a bad idea. We are certainly open to any new ideas that can create more fans and bring the game of Banana Ball to more people around the country. Over the last few years, we've heard from a lot of people about doing something around the Major League Baseball (MLB) All Star game. And you never know. We'd be open to it, if it could be a great partnership with MLB and most importantly a great fit for our fans. In the meantime, we are going to keep growing the game organically by bringing it to different ballparks around the country. But seeing the support from a player like Bryce who for many is the face of the game, truly means a lot.\n\nShedding a lot of tears the last 24 hours as the world just lost a truly great man and I just lost one of my biggest mentors in Pat Williams. Known for being the founder of the Orlando Magic but it was first his books that changed my life. When I was 23 years old I read How to be like Walt and Marketing Your Dreams by Pat and they inspired me to follow my dreams and work hard to become the leader I am today. A few years later, I wrote him a thank you letter and he called me and invited me to meet him for lunch. As a young person in the industry, I was impressionable to say the least, but he was so engaged with me and brought books as gifts and encouraged me to keep going and working hard in the game. Fast forward years later to 2022, and Don Yaeger brought him to his first Savannah Bananas game and that is when this picture was taken. The next day he called me and left the most supportive and encouraging voicemail, sharing about the impact of our experience on him. Since then we’ve talked regularly sharing our dreams. Even at 84 years old he continued to have big dreams with the goal to start an MLB team in Orlando. This past March after the Bananas sold out our first MLB stadium I sent him a video sharing my gratitude towards him and why part of the reason we were there and able to accomplish this dream was because of him and all his inspiration. His voicemail later that night was the most heartfelt message I've ever received as he went on and on praising me and lifting me up with the impact he said that I’m making on the game…he then said how proud he was of me and that he loved me. Hearing that from him and the person he is and with what he had accomplished in his life, as a parent to 19 kids, with 14 adopted, and everything he's done in the sports world, meant more to me than I can describe. I saved that message and listened to it this morning and couldn't hold back the tears. Pat was a believer. He believed in himself. He believed in the impossible. But most importantly he believed in others. The greatest gift you can give anyone is to lift them up. Pat did this daily to everyone he touched and especially me. He has lifted me up with his words, his encouragement and his love since the first book I read of his, until his last message he gave me. Pat, I appreciate you more than you know and will never stop being inspired by you and leading with my heart and dreaming big.\n\nBefore the biggest game in Savannah Bananas history at Nationals Park, I spoke to our group of 200+ people about the importance of doing more than just their job and how that is always been the Fans First way. I shared how the reason we are where we are today is because of that little extra and how are job is always bigger than just our job. I've been so inspired by watching everyone on our team from interns to my wife Emily Cole with how our people have always found a way to go out of their way for our fans and their teammates. With this now being our third MLB stadium and the expectations continuing to rise, I wanted our team know that giving that little extra was more important now than ever. Later that night after one of our most magical shows and experiences, our entire team and front office met and shared so many stories, shout outs and fans first moments that they created. I'm proud to say that their \"little extra\" shined bright at the Nation's Capital and for the 42,000 fans that went Bananas with us at Nationals Park.\n\nOne of the most amazing moments I've ever experienced with the Savannah Bananas. Three years ago to the day from when we were playing in DC, RobertAnthony Cruz got signed by the Washington Nationals and surprised his Dad at work with the news and gave him a Nationals hat. His Mom filmed it all happen as his Dad got emotional with the news and the video went viral receiving millions of views and covered by all the national media. Now, three years later, in front of a sold out Nationals Park, we shared the video in front of 42,000 fans but this time RAC met his Dad at home plate and gave him a Bananas hat. I along with many of us in the dugout got emotional and shed some tears at the power of that moment, seeing them hug on this stage. But then it became even more of a storybook night for RAC and his family, as he came up to the plate for his last at bat and hit a towering home run. You couldn't have scripted it any better at that stadium and that moment as he ran around the bases holding an American Flag and celebrated with the team, singing Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue. So many of us as kids want to make our Dads proud. Seeing RAC live out his dreams with us in Banana Ball in front of his Dad and his family was beyond special. I personally felt that moment as deep as any moment I've felt on a baseball field. I was so proud of RAC and continue to be proud of everyone on our team for the work they've done to get us here to have the opportunity to create these moments.\n\nBeyond words for the love and support Banana Nation gave us in DC. With over 42,000 fans it was the largest crowd in Banana Ball history. But it's the special moments that I’ll never forget. From an epic fly over to start the game, to the emotions with RobertAnthony Cruz and his Dad topped off with a storybook home run, to Val Perez and Ashton Lansdell facing off and the amazing response from the fans, to the firefighters and military honored, to the helicopter entrance for Danny Hosley to the final stand by me with the whole stadium singing, it was one of the greatest shows we’ve ever put on as a team. So proud of Zachary Frongillo for leading the effort with our tremendously hard working entertainment team and our entire cast and players for continuing to go all-in on fans first and entertaining always. Banana Nation truly brings out the best in all of us. We could feel the energy and love more than ever in DC. With everything that is going on in the world, we remain dedicated to spreading joy and bringing people together for the years to come.\n\nBanana Ball has made it to the Nation's Capital. Beyond excited to bring our game to a sold out crowd of over 42,000 fans to Nationals Park, making it our largest game in history. Also, our newest team, The Firefighters get their first opportunity to play at an MLB Stadium. This group has earned this stage with what they've done so far on this tour. From epic trick plays to playing the fastest game in Banana Ball history...they certainly know how to take the game to the next level. On this national stage we've got some big plans in store. We will be doing a lot of things we've never done before, and doing even more experiments with our show and the experience. The one thing for sure we know is that the more we do, the more we learn. We are set to learn a lot in front of 42,000 fans. Let's do this DC. This is going to be special!"
