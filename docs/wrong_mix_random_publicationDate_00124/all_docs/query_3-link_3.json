They are overwhelmed with the thoughts and prayers they have received and send their appreciation,” Veronica Buenrostro said in a statement.\n\nBravo, who has born Jesus Melgoza, was rushed the emergency room of the Centro Medico Dalinde in Mexico City on Saturday afternoon with a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, the statement said. Bravo suffered an acute myocardial infarction after complications, which caused his death.\n\nHis funeral took place Sunday and he will be cremated, the statement said. A memorial service will also take place in Los Angeles.\n\nHandler paid tribute to Bravo on her Instagram page Sunday.\n\n“I loved this nugget in a big way, and I took great pleasure in how many people loved him as much as I did and do. @chuybravo gave us so much laughter and I’ll never forget the sound of his laughter coming from his office into mine,” Handler said.\n\nOn Monday, she posted a clip from her show, which aired on the E! network, saying it was “a reminder of why he was so loveable.”"
