        "text": "Chelsea Handler will embark on a comedy tour this spring in support of her new memoir, Life Will Be the Death of Me, which will be published April 9th via Spiegel and Grau (pre-order here).\n\nHandler’s 17-city trek – billed as a “Sit-Down Comedy Tour” – will kick off April 11th at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts and wrap June 1st at the Masonic in San Francisco, California. Per a statement, each stop will feature Handler “in conversation, discussing stories from the new memoir and more.” Tickets are on sale now and each ticket will include a copy of the book.\n\nLife Will Be the Death of Me marks Handler’s first memoir and first book since her 2014 collection, Uganda Be Kidding Me. The book chronicles Handler’s “Year of Self-Sufficiency,” which she embarked upon after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.\n\nTrending\n\n“In a torpor of despair, [Handler] decides that she’s had enough of the privileged bubble she’s lived in and that it’s time to make some changes, both in her personal life and the world at large,” a description reads. “Where have I been all my life? is the question that guides her as she embarks on a ‘Year of Self-Sufficiency.’ She learns how to work the remote, pick up dog shit, find the toaster. She goes into therapy with an intellectually simpatico psychiatrist who makes her go deep and confront a childhood marked by love and loss. In the process, she discovers what matters most: family, friends, engaging with the world, and opening to love.”\n\nThe statement teases a handful of anecdotes from Life Will Be the Death of Me, including bits about a shaman, weed edibles and “an overweight, emotionally withholding Chow Chow.” The book will also find Handler opening up about her emotional experiences in therapy, uncovering childhood trauma and “finding her mojo as an activist.”\n\nChelsea Handler Tour Dates"
