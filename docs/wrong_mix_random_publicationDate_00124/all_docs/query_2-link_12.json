CALIGARI: A LIVE SOUNDTRACK EXPERIENCE New Music Works kicks off its 34th season with this presentation of Robert Weine’s 1919 German Expressionistic masterpiece about a demented carnival fortune-teller who keeps a somnambulist in a permanent trance-like state to do his evil bidding. Breathtakingly bizarre visuals like extreme chiaroscuro and menacing forced-perspective interiors and exteriors add to the sense of haunting weirdness.

Also on the bill is GHOSTS BEFORE BREAKFAST, a surreal 1927 short by Dadaist filmmaker/artist Hans Richter, accompanied by the composition “Revenge Before Breakfast” (1982) by Henry Brant, and AT LAND (1944), an experimental short by Maya Deren, featuring Deren and John Cage, accompanied by the composition “John Cage, 4:33” (1952). The NMW ensemble will also perform Erik Satie’s 1920 composition, “Furniture Music.” Dress up as a character from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or your favorite piece of furniture; prizes awarded for best costumes!

Susan Sarandon, Brit Marling, and Tim Roth co-star for writer-turned-director Nicholas Jarecki. (R) 100 minutes. (★★★1/2)—Greg Archer.\n\nARGO Quite simply one of the best films of the year. Argo surpassses expectations and manages to do the unlikely job of morphing into both a political thriller and social commentary—and one that is oftentimes humorous. While most of the applause should go to Ben Affleck, who stars and directs this wonderfully executed fact-based tale about a covert CIA operation to rescue six fugitive American in Tehran during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, the screenplay pops. Everything from the dialogue to the pacing is simply pitch perfect. Written by Chris Terrio, based on a selection from “The Master of Disguise” by Antonio J. Mendez and the Wired magazine article “The Great Escape” by Joshuah Bearman, this is one film you should not miss. Watch how well both the screenwriter and Affleck draw us deep within the tale as the story chronicles the aftermath of Iranian militants seizing the U. S. embassy, taking 52 members of the U. S. diplomatic corps hostage. Bryan Cranston and Alan Arkin may get Oscar noms for supporting roles. (R) 120 minutes. (★★★★)—Greg Archer.\n\nEND OF WATCH Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena star as LAPD partners, patrolling the men streets of South Central Los Angeles in this gritty slice-of-life cop drama that plunges the viewer into the midst of the action via surveillance cameras, video footage, and various other hand-held devices. Anna Kendrick and America Ferrera co-star for director David Ayer (Training Day). (R) 109 minutes.\n\nFRANKENWEENIE If you love dogs, you’ll love Tim Burton’s homage to James Whale’s horror classic about a boy and his (recently deceased) dog. When sweet, loyal Sparky gets hit by a car, young Victor sews him up and reanimates him in his attic lab. Burton revinvents a short he made back in film school as a black-and-white, 3D, stop-motion animated feature full of monster movie in-jokes, funny gags, and genuine resonance about the bond between peoole and their beloved pets. Deliciously clever, from a classroom of junior monster movie stereotypes to the tombstones in the pet cemetery, to a finale featuring an enlarged and reanimated Turtle-zilla. (PG) 87 minutes. (★★★)—Lisa Jensen.\n\nHERE COMES THE BOOM Kevin James stars in this comedy as a onetime college wrestler, now a biology teacher in an underfunded high school, who starts moonlighting as a mixed martial arts fighter to earn money for the school’s imperiled music program. Henry Winkler and Salma Hayek co-star for director Frank Coraci. (PG) 105 minutes.\n\nHOTEL TRANSYLVANIA It’s a monster’s ball in this animated family comedy about a plush resort run by Count Dracula where monsters can get away from pesky humans and relax. But trouble brews when an ordinary guy accidentally comes across the hotel and falls for the count’s daughter. Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, and Steve Buscemi head the voice cast. Genndy Tartakovsky directs. (PG) 92 minutes.\n\nTHE MASTER While it seems to have its own wildly original vitality at first, it’s soon clear that filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson is relying on powerhouse acting to distract the audience away from the lack of substance or meaning or plot in his script. Alcoholic postwar lost soul Joaquin Phoenix and imperious nutball cult leader Philip Seymour Hoffman spend over two hours engaged in a bizarre danse macabre that fails to drive the movie anywhere. (Only Jonny Greenwood’s jittery, propulsive music provides an illusion of dramatic intensity.) Once they meet, that’s it for story development. The rest is skilful tracking shots, elaborate vistas (in 70mm), and improbable details, all adding up to not much. (R) 137 minutes. (★★) —Lisa Jensen\n\nLOOPER Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues do no wrong in the roles he takes on lately. In this futuristic time-warp thriller he morphs into a hitmam for the mob. His job: eliminate “Loopers” like himself when their allotted time comes to an end and they must be sent back in time to get murdered. (His next target is himself, which sends the plot sailing in wild directions, of course.) It does bring up the question: Why not just eliminate the Loopers in the future instead of sending them back in time? (Time travel is such a bitch, anyway.) There would be no reason to watch this mindbending and, at times, gripping caper if the plot unfolded that way. But for all of its loopy plot points, the film can’t keep you stimulated or invested all of the time. Best bets: the acting, surprisingly. Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, and Jeff Daniels co-star for director Rian Johnson (Brick). That said, I wouldn’t be surprised if the film develops a cult following. (R) 108 minutes. 137 minutes. (★★1/2) —Greg Archer\n\nMOONRISE KINGDOM This could be Wes Anderson’s (Rushmore; Fantastic Mr. Fox) to date. it’s a quriky little love story revolving around two 12-year-olds and boy, does it have a lot of heart. Set in 1965 in a sleepy New England coastal community, the two young ones run off together. Meanwhile, the entire town is tossed into an upheaval trying to find them. Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Jason Schwartzman all co-star. Willis plays the island cop; Norton a troubled scout master and Murray/McDormand the young girl’s mother. Newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward so beautifully inhabit their roles that you don’t want them to leave the screen. Anderson also co-wrote this outing, which, could turn into one of the summer’s more memorable offerings. (PG-13) 97 minutes. (★★★1/2)—Greg Archer.\n\nTHE PAPERBOY In this Southern gothic film noir from director Le Daniels (Precious), investigative reporter Matthew McConaughey dives into the psychic swamp of 1960 South Florida to try to prove a Death Row inmate (John Cusack) innocent of murder. Heating up the action are Zac Efron as the reporter’s kid brother, and Nicole Kidman as a bombshell with a thing for prisoners. (R) 106 minutes.\n\nTHE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER Anyone who’sever felt like an outsider in high school can relate to Stephen Chbosky’s adaptation of his own YA novel sensation about a troubled teen entering his freshman year desperately searching for someone to connect with before his internal demons swallow him up. Given some dark themes, the tone is surprisingly benign through most of the picaresque vignettes that make up the storyline, buoyed by solid performances from protagonist Logan Lerman and co-star Emma Watson. But Ezra Miller steals the movie as Lerman’s irreverent, gay mentor and friend. (PG-13) 103 minutes. (★★★)—Lisa Jensen.\n\nSAMSARA Ron Fricke and filmmaking partner Mark Magidson (Baraka) are back with another breathtaking, if at times uneven visual tone poem on who we are and how we live in the world. Shot over five years, in twenty-five countries on five separate continents, it was also shot entirely on 70 mm film, which means the images are captured with astonishing clarity, color, and nuance. As long as Fricke sticks to the natural world—steaming volcanoes, vast drifting deserts of sand or canyons of snow—or contemplates the inanimate majesty of, say, ancient ruins, his results are literally awesome. It’s only when he succumbs to the urge to over-editorialize his images (either with staged sequences or obvious juxtapositions) that the movie’s spell is broken. (PG-13) 102 minutes. (★★1/2)—Lisa Jensen.\n\nSEVEN PSYCHOPATHS Martin McDonagh won a well-deserved screenplay Oscar in 2008 for his scathingly funny, fiercely moral In Bruges. Now he’s back with more boys behaving badly in this dark comedy about a struggling Hollywood screenwriter (Colin Farrell) drawn unwillingly into the LA criminal underground after his nutball buddies (Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell) steal a mobster’s prize Shih-Tzu. Woody Harrelson, Abbie Cornish, Tom Waits, and Olga Kurylenko co-star. (R) 105 minutes.\n\nSINISTER Ethan Hawke stars as a true-crime novelist trying to solve the mystery of how and why a family was murdered in his new home—before his family suffers the same fate—in this supernatural horror thriller. Juliet Rylance and Fred Dalton Thompson co-star for director Scott Derrickson (The Day The Earth Stood Still). (R) 110 minutes.\n\nSLEEPWALK WITH ME Real-life stand-up comedian Mike Birbiglia co-wrote, co-directed and stars in this inventive narrative comedy about an aspiring stand-up comic who also—you guessed it—sleepwalks thanks to a sleep disorder. But there’s so much more to this amusing tale than that as he comes to term with what direction to take his life—on all levels. Lauren Ambrose also stars,. while battling an increasingly intrusive—and metaphorical—sleep disorder. (Not rated) 90 minutes (★★★)\n\n—Greg Archer"
