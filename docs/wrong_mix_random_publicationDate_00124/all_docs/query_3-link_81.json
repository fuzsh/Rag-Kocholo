From embarking on a quest to become more self-sufficient to meeting a psychiatrist for therapy sessions to finding her voice as a political activist, Chelsea keeps readers laughing while inspiring them to uncover what really matters in their lives.\n\nHandler’s “Life Will Be the Death of Me” podcast will feature interviews between the comedian and her inner circle of friends recorded live from her current book tour. In addition, it will also continue to highlight themes from her memoir as she chats with prominent TV and film personalities, news anchors and authors about her life, her work and how her year of self-discovery has shaped where she’s headed next. Handler, determined to create something that matters, helps us all get real about grief, recovery and taking back control of your life.\n\nIf there was ever a human born to have a podcast, it’d be Chelsea Handler, so listen to the trailer now and follow the podcast for episode updates on iHeartRadio!"
