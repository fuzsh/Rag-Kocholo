        "text": "Shannen Doherty, who led shows like Charmed and Beverly Hills, 90210, has died. She was 53. Her publicist, Leslie Sloane, issued a statemnt to Variety. “On Saturday, July 13, she lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease,” she wrote. “The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie. The family asks for their privacy at this time so they can grieve in peace.”\n\nDoherty was a megastar of the 80’s and 90’s, starring as Brenda in 90210 and in films like Heathers and Mallrats. Her role as Brenda put her under intense media scrutiny, and the type of anti-fandom people make docuseries reckoning with today. Her talent was undeniable, with Aaron Spelling shaping Charmed around her despite the acrimonious circumstances under which she left 90210."
