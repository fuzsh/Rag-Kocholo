She has penned six best-selling books, five of which have reached #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list, including 2019’s Life Will Be the Death of Me. She will executive produce and star in a TV adaptation of the book under her production banner, Chelsea Handler Productions.\n\nIn 2022, Handler made her return to Netflix with her critically acclaimed comedy special Revolution.
