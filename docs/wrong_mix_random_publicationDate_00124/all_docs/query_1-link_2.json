Is it a rumor, or does he have a thing for leading ladies? Either way, Cruise has been linked to multiple women over the years, even before he made it big in the 1980s. With three marriages, several relationships, and a slew of rumored hookups, one can imagine what Cruise’s little black book looks like.\n\nWhile the actor is one of the biggest names in Hollywood, he’s quite private about his love life, especially in the past decade after his shocking divorce from his third wife Katie Holmes. Since his third divorce, he’s been linked to multiple co-stars, fellow Scientologists, and models over the years, but it seems the Top Gun star is keeping his dating life away from prying eyes. From the good, the bad, and the disturbing, we found all we could about Cruise’s dating life.\n\nCheck out all of the women Cruise has married, dated, or has been linked to since the 1980s below:\n\nA version of this article was originally published on March 2017.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nTom Cruise Is Facing 'the Most Stress' in His Career Ahead of Mission: Impossible 8 Release\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\n21 Surprising Celebrities That Were In or Linked to a Cult\n\n41 Women Over 50 Whose Bikini Photos Prove That Age Is Just a Number\n\n11 Strict Rules Jennifer Lopez & Ben Affleck Allegedly Follow in Their Marriage\n\nElsina Khayrova\n\nCruise was first linked to Russian socialite Elsina Khayrova in December 2023 when they were spotted looking close at a London party.\n\nWhile they were never actually photographed together, the pairing caused quite the stir with Khayrova’s ex-husband, a Russian oligarch, even weighing in to warn Cruise about her “expensive and luxurious tastes.”\n\nTheir romance fizzled out March 2024.\n\nMonica Barbaro\n\nIt seems Tom Cruise has his eyes on his co-star Monica Barbaro. Insiders alleged to InTouch Weekly, “Tom thinks she’s stunningly beautiful. He’d like to explore a relationship with her. People around Tom believe they’re a great match. But he genuinely wants her to succeed.”\n\nWhile it’s seemingly only a crush, many are keeping an eye on this potential romance.\n\nElsina Khayrova\n\nIn December 2023, it was reported that the actor had been seen “canoodling” socialite Elsina Khayrova. The 36-year-old is the daughter of a prominent Russian member of parliament and ex-wife of diamond-trading oligarch, Dmitry Tsetko.\n\nThey reportedly met each other’s kids and were seemingly close-knit until late Feb 2024, when insiders claimed that the two decided to cool things down. As of March 9, 2024, they seemed to have broken things off after she turned down his alleged proposal.\n\nIt was later confirmed in March 2024 that they ended their relationship after three months, with sources claiming it was because his team was afraid of her talkative ex-husband.\n\nHayley Atwell\n\nIn late 2020, The Sun reported that Tom Cruise and his Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One co-star Hayley Atwell were secretly dating. Many conflicting reports came in the next two years, some claiming they broke up, were never together, and even reconnected in early 2022. However, Atwell set the record straight and said nothing happened between the two!\n\nAnnabelle Wallis\n\nAnnabelle Wallis may be 20 years Cruise’s junior, but that didn’t stop romance rumors from springing up left and right when it was announced in Spring 2016 that these two were starring in The Mummy together. Cruise was apparently so smitten with Wallis that he sent her flowers ahead of filming and asked her personally to audition for the part.\n\nSofia Boutella\n\nAs soon as it was rumored that Sofia Boutella could be Cruise’s co-star in The Mummy, the romance rumors began. Of course, she did end up landing the part in the movie, but it appears neither of them landed a relationship out of the deal.\n\nLola Kirke\n\nAccording to rumors back in Summer 2015, Cruise was so into his American Made co-star Lola Kirke, the sister of Girls star Jemima Kirke, that he was ready to make her wife No. 4. These romance rumors were never confirmed by either duo and seemed to fizzle once filming wrapped.\n\nVanessa Kirby\n\nAfter rising to fame in The Crown, in which she portrays Princess Margaret, Kirby was cast opposite Cruise in Mission: Impossible – Fallout and soon came the romance rumors after photos emerged of them kissing while filming a scene for the movie.\n\nMany reports came in that Cruise was smitten with her, saying she’d be “perfect to be his next wife.” But Kirby, who also starred in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and will star in its successor, denied the rumors.\n\n“The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t,” she told Marie Claire UK. “None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.”\n\nCameron Diaz\n\nTom Cruise and Cameron Diaz starred in two films together, Vanilla Sky and Knight and Day, so, obviously, they were madly in love (we speculate, of course). Of course, nothing ever came of the rumors, and Diaz claims they were nothing more than friends.\n\nLaura Prepon\n\nBack in 2013, Tom Cruise and Laura Prepon were seen dining together in Los Angeles, and almost a year later, Page Six reported that the duo had been “secretly dating” for months, but both of their representatives denied this.\n\nOlga Kurylenko\n\nRumors went into overdrive when photos of Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko kissing hit the internet, but Kurylenko quickly denied the rumors and claimed the photos were from their movie Oblivion.\n\nYolanda Pecoraro\n\nRight after his breakup with Penelope Cruz, Tom Cruise allegedly had his eyes on Yolanda Pecoraro, who was around 23 years younger than him. It’s alleged that the Church of Scientology had their eyes on her to be his next wife, per Nicki Swift. He was reportedly “head over heels” for her and allegedly paid for her Scientology courses. Their affair only lasted a couple months in the early 2000s.\n\nAbbey Lee\n\nModel Abbey Lee and Tom Cruise were linked to one another back in 2012 after a raunchy photoshoot, and per Daily Mail, he called her to arrange a meeting back in 2017. The report said, “When he (Tom) found out he was coming to Australia to promote his new film The Mummy, the first people he called was Abbey to arrange a catch-up.”\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nTom Cruise and Katie Holmes‘ whirlwind romance started in 2005, and within two months, they were ready to tie the knot. When Holmes first got into Hollywood, she told Seventeen in a now-deleted interview, “I think every little girl dreams about (her wedding). I used to think I was going to marry Tom Cruise.”\n\nThe pair welcomed their child Suri Cruise on Apr 18, 2006, and later married on Nov 18, 2006, in Italy. Soon after getting together, Holmes converted to Scientology for him. However, she left the Church and filed for divorce allegedly due to fear of Cruise abducting Suri into the Church of Scientology. They divorced in 2012.\n\nSofía Vergara\n\nBack in 2005, Tom Cruise and Sofía Vergara were seen out on what appeared to be a date. According to Foreign Policy, Vergara received a call from Cruise, where he gave her an invitation to his upcoming birthday party. He allegedly showered her with gifts, and the two seemed to really hit it off. But he allegedly tried to convert her to the Church of Scientology, and she refused.\n\nIn 2023, it was even rumored that Cruise had his sights set on Vergara once again after her split from Joe Manganiello but that speculation never amounted to anything.\n\nNazanin Boniadi\n\nSo Nazanin Boniadi and Tom Cruise didn’t technically date at first, but a 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed the Church of Scientology tried to set the Iranian-born actress up to be Cruise’s wife before Katie Holmes. The Church allegedly auditioned her to be his wife across several months before they ended the brief romance. Boniadi reportedly left the Church soon after.\n\nPenélope Cruz\n\nOne of Cruise’s more high-profile co-star romances was with his former co-star Penelope Cruz. Cruise and Cruz met on the set of their film Vanilla Sky in 2000 and began dating in 2001. They amicably split after three years together and reportedly remain friends.\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nNicole Kidman and Tom Cruise met on the set of the hit film Days of Thunder and tied the knot a year later on Christmas Eve in 1990 in Telluride, Colorado.\n\nThey starred in two more films together, and even adopted two children together named Isabella Jane in 1992 and a son named Connor in 1995.\n\nShe joined the Church of Scientology for him but left in 1997, and even got him to leave for a brief period of time, according to The Daily Beast. This later caused a strain in their relationship, and she was reportedly blindsided when he filed for divorce from her in 2001.\n\nBefore Kidman became the superstar she is today, she told Marie Claire per Goalcast that she felt like a trophy at the beginning of their marriage. “I thought, I don’t deserve to be here. We would go to the Oscars, and I would think, I’m here to support [Tom]. I felt it was my job to put on a beautiful dress and to be seen and not heard.”\n\nMimi Rogers\n\nMeet Mimi Rogers: Tom Cruise’s first wife and the person that got him into Scientology. In a previous interview with Rolling Stone, Cruise revealed how they met: “I met her at a dinner party about a year ago, when I was developing Top Gun. She was dating a friend, and, uh, I thought she was extremely bright.” However, Roder told a different story to Sun Senintental.\n\nThe two dated in 1986, and later married a year later, in 1987. They divorced officially in 1990, and while it’s unclear why they decided to call it quits, Rogers did give a hint to a big part of their strained relationship. She said to People, that it was hard to be known as just his wife. She said “no matter what the article is, it’s ‘Tom Cruise‘s wife…”\n\nCher\n\nThis one is as shocking as it gets. Turns out, Tom Cruise and Cher originally met at Sean Penn and Madonna’s wedding. Not much is known about their brief affair in 1983, but Cher has given a few hints over the years. On an episode of Watch What Happens Live, she listed Cruise in her top five lovers of all time.\n\nPatti Scialfa\n\nBruce Springsteen’s now-wife Patti Scialfa and Tom Cruise ended up dating for a very brief period of time in 1985, per an old People profile.\n\nRebecca DeMornay\n\nAccording to Tom Cruise and Rebecca DeMornay’s former Risky Business co-star Curtis Armstrong’s book Revenge of the Nerd, he alleged the two had an “intense affair,” which DeMornay later confirmed in an interview with Celebrity Page in 2018. She said, “He came to grow on me because we wound up together for two and a half years after that film.” The two were together from 1982 to 1985.\n\nHeather Locklear\n\nSo Heather Locklear and Tom Cruise weren’t an item, but they did star together back in the 1980s, and even went on one date!\n\nIn a 2013 interview on Chelsea Lately, Handler said they had both “auditioned for something” together, back when Tom “didn’t have friends” in Hollywood in the early ’80s. “You know in ‘Risky Business’ where he does that dance in his underwear and does the splits? We were dancing at a club and he went into that. He starting doing the splits,” she said. “You just kind of stand there and don’t know what to do. Do you dance around him? So, I was like, ‘I’ll just sit down and you can.’”\n\nMelissa Gilbert"
