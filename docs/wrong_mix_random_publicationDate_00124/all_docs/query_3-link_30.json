He was 63.\n\nFollowing the tragic news, Chelsea Handler took to Instagram on Monday to pen a heartfelt tribute to her late castmate of seven years. In her post, she notes that she took “great pleasure” in sharing her love for the comedian as many others did.\n\n“I loved this nugget in a big way, and I took great pleasure in how many people loved him as much as I did and do,” Handler prefaced the post. “@chuybravo gave us so much laughter and I’ll never forget the sound of his laughter coming from his office into mine. Or his 'business calls' with his 'business manager,' or his shoe rack with all his children-sized shoes.”\n\nHandler then recalled a touching Christmas story involving Bravo, stating, “I’ll never forget him coming to Christmas with my family one year in the Florida keys, and when my niece who was 5 or 6 at the time—saw him, she ran in the other direction saying she was scared.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n“My sister and I were mortified and were apologizing to Chuy, who told us, ‘it’s ok, lots of little kids get scared when they see big kids coming their way,’” she continued.\n\nShe then ended the touching post with a resounding, “I love you, Chuy!\""
