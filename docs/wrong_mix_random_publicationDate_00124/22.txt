Chelsea Handler's 2019 memoir, Life Will Be The Death Of Me, is being turned into a show at Peacock.

The 46-year-old comedian is executive producing and starring in the upcoming 30-minute sitcom series project.

The show follows Handler on her journey to self-improvement as she seeks therapy to become a nicer person and untangles her childhood trauma.

According to Deadline, other executive producers on the project include Liz Tuccillo - who has written on Sex and The City and Divorce - Sue Naegle, Megan Ellison, and Molly Burke.

This isn't the first time the New Jersey native is working with Peacock.

In 2020 she sold Wiped Out - a half-hour from Charles Morris - to the streaming network. That same year she also sold Blair - series based on the comic strip by Mo Welch - to HBO Max.

The star has had a great start to the year. She recently celebrated adding more dates to her comedy tour Vaccinated and Horny by posting sexy bikini pictures in the snow.

'I just found out that due to popular demand we are adding a SECOND show on May 5th,' she captioned the risqu√© post.

The comedian also won a People's Choice Award for Best Comedy Tour, after traveling the country and performing her standup routine.

'Can you believe that??? This is one of the happiest times of my life and I owe it to each and every one of my fans and to the man of the hour @jokoy,' she wrote on Instagram, referring to her boyfriend - and fellow comedian - Jo Koy.

The pair have known each other for many years, but started officially dating in 2021.

The star spoke about the relationship on her podcast Dear Chelsea, in October 2021, revealing why it took so long for them to start dating.

'I was just not in touch with myself to understand, I knew I liked talking with you and having you in my life because you're positive and upbeat. It's infectious and I loved all of that. But I wasn't like oh my God, this desire to have something happen,' she told Koy.

She then added that he reminded her of her late brother Chet, who passed away in 1984.

'You have a lot of similar qualities that my brother had. So, in many ways, like I just feel so completely safe. And I feel like, "oh, this is family," like I've always felt that way about you, that you're family,' she said.
