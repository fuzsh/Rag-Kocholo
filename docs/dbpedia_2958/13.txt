Big River Man (2011) - Rich Ragsdale by PicturesUp

This is a Sundance award-winning documentary by acclaimed art-house director John Maringouin. The story follows Martin Strel, a Guinness World Record holding Slovenian long-distance swimmer, best known for his 1K mile swims for environmental awareness. As a "thoroughly engaging and genuinely fascinating documentary", Rich Ragsdale's score is no less of an achievement as it defines Strel and his comedic yet serious struggle in swimming 3,300 miles down the Amazon. Going from a Pendereckian aesthetic to even post-rock and orchestral minimalism, this score is contagious in its ability to take you on a comedic yet dark subconscious emotional journey of Big River Man's eclectic protagonist. Composed & Conducted: Rich Ragsdale Producers: Andrew P. Alderete, Rich Ragsdale, Jeff Johns Executive Album Producer: Andrew P. Alderete http://www.2m1records.com/bigriverman
