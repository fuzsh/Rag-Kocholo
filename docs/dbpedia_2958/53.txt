Big River Man (12A)

Very much in the tradition of the Oscar-winning Man On Wire, here's an engaging, scenically spectacular documentary about one of the world's most extraordinary eccentrics.

He has already swum down the Danube, Mississippi and Yangtse. At 53, he's attempting something no one has done before, and for good reason - to swim the length of the Amazon.

He's Martin Strel, a paunchy gambler and part-time teacher of flamenco guitar, who has set world records for marathon endurance swims, often while drunk.

Latterday Falstaff: Martin Strel

He's as jolly and cheerfully irresponsible as a latterday Falstaff. He's reminiscent of Desperate Dan as he tucks in to Slovenian horseburgers, and there's something frankly deluded about his belief that if he learns to think like an animal he will not be eaten by one.

Narrated by his long-suffering son Borut, this is the story of his historic swim, braving the Amazon's whirlpools, floating logs, alligators, anacondas and piranha.

The film shows that just as dangerous to him were his own high blood pressure, sunburn and madness exacerbated by a larval infection of the brain.

John Maringouin's documentary starts off as a jolly romp, but becomes increasingly jumbled and expressionistic as Martin loses what remain of his marbles and ends up swimming robotically, regardless of danger and unable even to remember his name.

It's a memorable portrait of a genuine eccentric, which will remind many of Werner Herzog's films Fitzcarraldo and Grizzly Man. I was left unconvinced by Martin's claims to be an eco-warrior, and ultimately he comes across as an insane egotist, Slovenia's answer to Borat.

But eco-political pretensions aside, this is a memorable account of one man's extraordinary obstinacy, and his willingness to swim into his very own heart of darkness, however massive the odds against him emerging from the other side.

Verdict: Superior doc about a larger-than-life character
