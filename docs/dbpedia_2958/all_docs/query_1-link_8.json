        "text": "River Suir through Carrick (thanks to Chris Keane 2019)\n\nThis week‚Äôs blog post is on a favourite song of mine, \"Big River\", a song written and performed by English singer and actor Jimmy Nail, The big river referred to in the title is the River Tyne that runs through Nail's home town, Newcastle upon Tyne. The song is an elegy to the days when shipbuilding and industry in general were at their height in Newcastle and laments the later decline of the industry and therefore the decline of the importance and activity of the Tyne itself. However, in the last chorus, the song takes a more hopeful turn, declaring that, \"the river will rise again\". The guitar work on the song was provided by Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler, who features in the music video.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine living in a town or city without a river. Some of my earliest memories are holding my mother‚Äôs hand as we crossed from the end of Bridge Street onto the Old Bridge in Carrick-on-Suir. And when I say ‚Äúold bridge‚Äù I mean old bridge as a bridge has stood here since 1447 ‚Äì before Columbus went to America! The river is so much a part of Carrick that it‚Äôs even included in its name. Carraig na Si√∫ire, in Irish means 'rock of the Suir'. How many times have I crossed the River Suir? For school, work, shops. To meet friends. Saying ‚Äúwell!‚Äù to everyone I met. And for the last 30 years I‚Äôve lived near the River Liffey in Dublin. Another great river. How many times have I walked across its bridges to work, shop and play? Though not as big as the Big River in Jimmy‚Äôs song, both the Suir and the Liffey have played a big part in my daily life.\n\nSuir at Sunset (by Hugh Faulkner)\n\n‚ÄãSome might see the rivers as divisive, separating Carrick-M·Ωπr from Carrick-Beg; the Southside from the Northside. But, river towns to me are all about connection, bridges bring us across to the other shore. You cannot but be aware of the movement and flow of life. Attracting graceful swans and water birds; agile salmon and trout. As children we often stood on the Old Bridge watching in respectful awe as the Suir in full flood thundered underneath. In 1974 we moved house and I started crossing the New (Dillon) Bridge instead. Not that it‚Äôs new ‚Ä¶ it dates from 1879‚Ä¶.but it‚Äôs new compared to the Old Bridge üòäand when I first started using it regularly in 1974 it was being reconstructed. We had to walk on a temporary wooden walkway constructed under the bridge for the duration of the works. It was the scariest thing ever when the Suir was in flood.\n\nNew Bridge, Carrick-on-Suir with wooden walkway beneath - c.1974\n\nBut flow it did and we took it for granted that the river would be there every day‚Ä¶.but never the same water twice‚Ä¶.always moving forward to the sea. Making us aware of the passage of time. The river ‚Äì whose waters change every second of every hour of every day, carving new shorelines with every flood of its banks ‚Äì reminds us that nothing is stagnant.\n\nBack in the day, the River Suir was a major source of commerce for the town of Carrick with goods being transferred downstream from Clonmel to Waterford. Several families made a living from the river; boat builders/ repairers, rope makers, fishermen. But the river in flood often brought destruction with flooding of properties, drownings and loss of life. We treated it with respect. Often too, back in the day, we used rivers as an organic waste disposal system for sewage and industrial waste but thankfully today both the Suir and the Liffey are cleaner than I ever remember and smell much better.\n\nSunrise on the Liffey - taken on my way to work from Talbot Memorial Bridge 16 Sept 2015\n\nThe song, Big River, resonates with me as, like Jimmy‚Äôs dad, ‚Äúmy father was working man, he earned a living with his hands, he had to cross the river every day, he picked up his Union card ‚Äú. Except my dad worked in a factory making leatherboard (used for shoe insoles) ‚Äì Ferrersflex a subsidiary of the Tannery. He cycled to and from work across the river every day, coming home for his dinner in the middle of the day. It was hard physical labour but he loved it and he loved the guys he worked with. When he died at almost 94, one of his prized possessions was his union card from the job.\n\nMy Dad\n\n‚ÄãIn 1978 he took voluntary redundancy at the age of 63. The Tannery and subsidiaries closed for good in 1984 which was a huge blow for the town. Instead of crossing the river for work the men now gathered to chat on the bridges contemplating life as the Suir flowed beneath. The town went through a period of decline but like the river the town never gives up. Carrick still has the river and along its picturesque bank has been developed the Blue Way for visitors and locals alike. Carrick still has community, parks, art, culture and history. Carrick still has spirit and like the river lives on. ‚ÄòCause to quote Jimmy ‚Äúthis is a mighty town‚Ä¶built upon solid ground‚Äù. Happy Christmas to all!\n\nSo without further ado, here's \"Big River\" with Jimmy Nail:\n\n‚Äã\n\n‚ÄãLyrics of Big River by Jimmy Nail\n\nWalking on cobbled stones, little bits of skin and bone\n\nJumping on a tram car for a ride\n\nI can remember when, I was a just a boy of ten\n\nHanging around the old Quayside\n\nNow all the capstans and the cargo boats\n\nAnd stevedores are gone\n\nTo where all the old ships go\n\nBut memories, just like the sea live on\n\n'Cause that was when coal was King\n\nThe river was a living thing\n\nAnd I was just a boy but it was mine\n\nThe coaly Tyne\n\nThis was a big river\n\nI want you all to know\n\nThat I was proud\n\nThis was a big river\n\nBut that was long ago\n\nThat's not now, that's not now\n\nMy father was a working man\n\nHe earned a living with his hands\n\nHe had to cross the river every day\n\nHe picked up his Union card, out of the Neptune yard\n\nMouths to feed and bills to pay\n\nThere came a time for him to sail across the sea and far away\n\nAnd finally when the war was won\n\nThey brought him home and home he stayed\n\nAnd when his days were done\n\nUnder a golden sun\n\nThey took him back to where he longed to be\n\nBack to the sea\n\nThis was a big river\n\nI want you all to know\n\nThat I was proud\n\nThis was a big river\n\nBut that was long ago\n\nThat's not now, that's not now\n\nThe Neptune was the last to go\n\nI heard it on the radio\n\nAnd then they played the latest number one\n\nBut what do they do all day\n\nAnd what are they supposed to say\n\nWhat does a father tell his son?\n\nIf you believe that there's a bond between our future and our past\n\nTry to hold on to what we have\n\nWe build them strong, we built to last\n\n'Cause this is a mighty town\n\nBuilt upon solid ground\n\nAnd everything they've tried so hard to kill\n\nWe will rebuild\n\nThis is a big river\n\nI want you all to know I'm so very proud\n\nThis is a big river\n\nBut that was long ago\n\nThat's not now\n\nThis is a big, big river\n\nAnd in my heart I know it will rise again\n\nThe river will rise again"
