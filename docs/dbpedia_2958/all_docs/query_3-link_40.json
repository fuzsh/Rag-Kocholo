Protection can be achieved by building dikes or seawalls and by maintaining natural features like mangroves or coral reefs. Communities can also adjust by reclaiming land from the sea and adapting buildings to cope with floods. However, all measures have their limits, and once these are reached people may ultimately have to retreat. Choices made today influence how coastal ecosystems and communities can respond to sea level rise (SLR) in the future. Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would not just reduce risks, but also open up more adaptation options.\n\nGlobal Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is rising and it will continue to do so for centuries. Sustainable development aspirations are at risk because many people, assets and vital resources are concentrated along low-lying coasts around the world. Many coastal communities have started to consider the implications of SLR. Measures are being taken to address coastal hazards exacerbated by rising sea level, such as coastal flooding due to extreme events (e.g. storm surges, tropical cyclones), coastal erosion and salinisation). However, many coastal communities are still not sufficiently adapted to today’s ESLs.\n\nScientific evidence about SLR is clear: GMSL rose by 1.5 mm yr-1 during the period 1901–1990, accelerating to 3.6 mm yr-1 during the period 2005–2015. It is likely to rise 0.61–1.10 m by 2100 if global GHG emissions are not mitigated (RCP8.5). However, a rise of two or more metres cannot be ruled out. It could rise to more than 3 m by 2300, depending on the level of GHG emissions and the response of the AIS, which are both highly uncertain. Even if efforts to mitigate emissions are very effective, ESL events that were rare over the last century will become common before 2100, and even by 2050 in many locations. Without ambitious adaptation, the combined impact of hazards like coastal storms and very high tides will drastically increase the frequency and severity of flooding on low-lying coasts.\n\nSLR, as well as the context for adaptation, will vary regionally and locally, thus action to reduce risks related to SLR takes different forms depending on the local circumstances. ‘Hard protection’, like dikes and seawalls, can effectively reduce risk under two or more metres of SLR but it is inevitable that limits will be reached. Such protection produces benefits that exceed its costs in low-lying coastal areas that are densely populated, as is the case for many coastal cities and some small islands, but in general, poorer regions will not be able to afford hard protection. Maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems, like mangroves, seagrass beds or coral reefs, can provide ‘soft protection’ and other benefits. SLR can also be ‘accommodated’ by raising buildings on the shoreline, for example. Land can be reclaimed from the sea by building outwards and upwards. In coastal locations where the risk is very high and cannot be effectively reduced, ‘retreat’ from the shoreline is the only way to eliminate such risk. Avoiding new development commitments in areas exposed to coastal hazards and SLR also avoids additional risk.\n\nFor those unable to afford protection, accommodation or advance measures, or when such measures are no longer viable or effective, retreat becomes inevitable. Millions of people living on low-lying islands face this prospect, including inhabitants of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), of some densely populated but less intensively developed deltas, of rural coastal villages and towns, and of Arctic communities who already face melting sea ice and unprecedented changes in weather. The resultant impacts on distinctive cultures and ways of life could be devastating. Difficult trade-offs are therefore inevitable when making social choices about rising sea level. Institutionalising processes that lead to fair and just outcomes is challenging, but vitally important.\n\nChoices being made now about how to respond to SLR profoundly influence the trajectory of future exposure and vulnerability to SLR. If concerted emissions mitigation is delayed, risks will progressively increase as SLR accelerates. Prospects for global climate-resilience and sustainable development therefore depend in large part on coastal nations, cities and communities taking urgent and sustained locally-appropriate action to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to SLR\n\nD\n\nDownload Chapter 4\n\nShare\n\nDownloads\n\nDownload Chapter 4\n\nDownload Chapter 4 Supplementary Material\n\nES\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nShare\n\nThis chapter assesses past and future contributions to global, regional and extreme sea level changes, associated risk to low-lying islands, coasts, cities, and settlements, and response options and pathways to resilience and sustainable development along the coast.\n\nObservations\n\nGlobal mean sea level (GMSL) is rising (virtually certain) and accelerating (high confidence). The sum of glacier and ice sheet contributions is now the dominant source of GMSL rise (very high confidence). GMSL from tide gauges and altimetry observations increased from 1.4 mm yr–1 over the period 1901–1990 to 2.1 mm yr–1 over the period 1970–2015 to 3.2 mm yr–1 over the period 1993–2015 to 3.6 mm yr–1 over the period 2006–2015 (high confidence). The dominant cause of GMSL rise since 1970 is anthropogenic forcing (high confidence). {4.2.2.1.1, 4.2.2.2}\n\nGMSL was considerably higher than today during past climate states that were warmer than pre-industrial, including the Last Interglacial (LIG; 129–116 ka), when global mean surface temperature was 0.5ºC–1.0ºC warmer, and the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; ~3.3 to 3.0 million years ago), 2ºC–4ºC warmer. Despite the modest global warmth of the Last Interglacial, GMSL was likely 6–9 m higher, mainly due to contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (GIS and AIS, respectively), and unlikely more than 10m higher (medium confidence). Based on new understanding about geological constraints since the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5), 25 m is a plausible upper bound on GMSL during the mPWP (low confidence). Ongoing uncertainties in palaeo sea level reconstructions and modelling hamper conclusions regarding the total magnitudes and rates of past sea level rise (SLR). Furthermore, the long (multi-millennial) time scales of these past climate and sea level changes, and regional climate influences from changes in Earth’s orbital configuration and climate system feedbacks, lead to low confidence in direct comparisons with near-term future changes. {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, 4.2.2, 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.5, SM 4.1}\n\nNon-climatic anthropogenic drivers, including recent and historical demographic and settlement trends and anthropogenic subsidence, have played an important role in increasing low-lying coastal communities’ exposure and vulnerability to SLR and extreme sea level (ESL) events (very high confidence). In coastal deltas, for example, these drivers have altered freshwater and sediment availability (high confidence). In low-lying coastal areas more broadly, human-induced changes can be rapid and modify coastlines over short periods of time, outpacing the effects of SLR (high confidence). Adaptation can be undertaken in the short- to medium-term by targeting local drivers of exposure and vulnerability, notwithstanding uncertainty about local SLR impacts in coming decades and beyond (high confidence). {4.2.2.4, 4.3.1, 4.3.2.2, 4.3.2.3}\n\nCoastal ecosystems are already impacted by the combination of SLR, other climate-related ocean changes, and adverse effects from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). Attributing such impacts to SLR, however, remains challenging due to the influence of other climate-related and non-climatic drivers such as infrastructure development and human-induced habitat degradation (high confidence). Coastal ecosystems, including saltmarshes, mangroves, vegetated dunes and sandy beaches, can build vertically and expand laterally in response to SLR, though this capacity varies across sites (high confidence). These ecosystems provide important services that include coastal protection and habitat for diverse biota. However, as a consequence of human actions that fragment wetland habitats and restrict landward migration, coastal ecosystems progressively lose their ability to adapt to climate-induced changes and provide ecosystem services, including acting as protective barriers (high confidence). {4.3.2.3}\n\nCoastal risk is dynamic and increased by widely observed changes in coastal infrastructure, community livelihoods, agriculture and habitability (high confidence). As with coastal ecosystems, attribution of observed changes and associated risk to SLR remains challenging. Drivers and processes inhibiting attribution include demographic, resource and land use changes and anthropogenic subsidence. {4.3.3, 4.3.4}\n\nA diversity of adaptation responses to coastal impacts and risks have been implemented around the world, but mostly as a reaction to current coastal risk or experienced disasters (high confidence). Hard coastal protection measures (dikes, embankments, sea walls and surge barriers) are widespread, providing predictable levels of safety in northwest Europe, East Asia, and around many coastal cities and deltas. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is continuing to gain traction worldwide, providing multiple co-benefits, but there is still low agreement on its cost and long-term effectiveness. Advance, which refers to the creation of new land by building into the sea (e.g., land reclamation), has a long history in most areas where there are dense coastal populations. Accommodation measures, such as early warning systems (EWS) for ESL events, are widespread. Retreat is observed but largely restricted to small communities or carried out for the purpose of creating new wetland habitat. {4.4.2.3, 4.4.2.4, 4.4.2.5}\n\nProjections\n\nFuture rise in GMSL caused by thermal expansion, melting of glaciers and ice sheets and land water storage changes, is strongly dependent on which Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenario is followed. SLR at the end of the century is projected to be faster under all scenarios, including those compatible with achieving the long-term temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. GMSL will rise between 0.43 m (0.29–0.59 m, likely range; RCP2.6) and 0.84 m (0.61–1.10 m, likely range; RCP8.5) by 2100 (medium confidence) relative to 1986–2005. Beyond 2100, sea level will continue to rise for centuries due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass loss of the GIS and AIS and will remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence). Under RCP8.5, estimates for 2100 are higher and the uncertainty range larger than in AR5. Antarctica could contribute up to 28 cm of SLR (RCP8.5, upper end of likely range) by the end of the century (medium confidence). Estimates of SLR higher than the likely range are also provided here for decision makers with low risk tolerance. {SR1.5, 4.1, 4.2.3.2, 4.2.3.5}\n\nUnder RCP8.5, the rate of SLR will be 15 mm yr–1 (10–20 mm yr–1, likely range) in 2100, and could exceed several cm yr–1 in the 22nd century. These high rates challenge the implementation of adaptation measures that involve a long lead time, but this has not yet been studied in detail. {4.2.3.2, 4.4.2.2.3}\n\nProcesses controlling the timing of future ice shelf loss and the spatial extent of ice sheet instabilities could increase Antarctica’s contribution to SLR to values higher than the likely range on century and longer time scales (low confidence). Evolution of the AIS beyond the end of the 21st century is characterized by deep uncertainty as ice sheet models lack realistic representations of some of the underlying physical processes. The few model studies available addressing time scales of centuries to millennia indicate multi-metre (2.3–5.4 m) rise in sea level for RCP8.5 (low confidence). There is low confidence in threshold temperatures for ice sheet instabilities and the rates of GMSL rise they can produce. {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, and Sections 4.1, 4.2.3.1.1, 4.2.3.1.2, 4.2.3.6}\n\nSea level rise is not globally uniform and varies regionally. Thermal expansion, ocean dynamics and land ice loss contributions will generate regional departures of about ±30% around the GMSL rise. Differences from the global mean can be greater than ±30% in areas of rapid vertical land movements, including those caused by local anthropogenic factors such as groundwater extraction (high confidence). Subsidence caused by human activities is currently the most important cause of relative sea level rise (RSL) change in many delta regions. While the comparative importance of climate-driven RSL rise will increase over time, these findings on anthropogenic subsidence imply that a consideration of local processes is critical for projections of sea level impacts at local scales (high confidence). {4.2.1.6, 4.2.2.4}\n\nDue to projected GMSL rise, ESLs that are historically rare (for example, today’s hundred-year event) will become common by 2100 under all RCPs (high confidence). Many low-lying cities and small islands at most latitudes will experience such events annually by 2050. Greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation envisioned in low-emission scenarios (e.g., RCP2.6) is expected to sharply reduce but not eliminate risk to low-lying coasts and islands from SLR and ESL events. Low-emission scenarios lead to slower rates of SLR and allow for a wider range of adaptation options. For the first half of the 21st century differences in ESL events among the scenarios are small, facilitating adaptation planning. {4.2.2.5, 4.2.3.4}\n\nNon-climatic anthropogenic drivers will continue to increase the exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to future SLR and ESL events in the absence of major adaptation efforts compared to today (high confidence). {4.3.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9}\n\nThe expected impacts of SLR on coastal ecosystems over the course of the century include habitat contraction, loss of functionality and biodiversity, and lateral and inland migration. Impacts will be exacerbated in cases of land reclamation and where anthropogenic barriers prevent inland migration of marshes and mangroves and limit the availability and relocation of sediment (high confidence). Under favourable conditions, marshes and mangroves have been found to keep pace with fast rates of SLR (e.g., >10 mm yr-1), but this capacity varies significantly depending on factors such as wave exposure of the location, tidal range, sediment trapping, overall sediment availability and coastal squeeze (high confidence). {4.3.3.5.1}\n\nIn the absence of adaptation, more intense and frequent ESL events, together with trends in coastal development will increase expected annual flood damages by 2-3 orders of magnitude by 2100 (high confidence). However, well designed coastal protection is very effective in reducing expected damages and cost efficient for urban and densely populated regions, but generally unaffordable for rural and poorer areas (high confidence). Effective protection requires investments on the order of tens to several hundreds of billions of USD yr-1 globally (high confidence). While investments are generally cost efficient for densely populated and urban areas (high confidence), rural and poorer areas will be challenged to afford such investments with relative annual costs for some small island states amounting to several percent of GDP (high confidence). Even with well-designed hard protection, the risk of possibly disastrous consequences in the event of failure of defences remains. {4.3.4, 4.4.2.2, 4.4.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9}\n\nRisk related to SLR (including erosion, flooding and salinisation) is expected to significantly increase by the end of this century along all low-lying coasts in the absence of major additional adaptation efforts (very high confidence). While only urban atoll islands and some Arctic communities are expected to experience moderate to high risk relative to today in a low emission pathway, almost high to very high risks are expected in all low-lying coastal settings at the upper end of the likely range for high emission pathways (medium confidence). However, the transition from moderate to high and from high to very high risk will vary from one coastal setting to another (high confidence). While a slower rate of SLR enables greater opportunities for adapting, adaptation benefits are also expected to vary between coastal settings. Although ambitious adaptation will not necessarily eradicate end-century SLR risk (medium confidence), it will help to buy time in many locations and therefore help to lay a robust foundation for adaptation beyond 2100. {4.1.3, 4.3.4, Box 4.1, SM4.2}\n\nChoosing and Implementing Responses\n\nAll types of responses to SLR, including protection, accommodation, EbA, advance and retreat, have important and synergistic roles to play in an integrated and sequenced response to SLR (high confidence). Hard protection and advance (building into the sea) are economically efficient in most urban contexts facing land scarcity (high confidence), but can lead to increased exposure in the long term. Where sufficient space is available, EbA can both reduce coastal risks and provide multiple other benefits (medium confidence). Accommodation such as flood proofing buildings and EWS for ESL events are often both low-cost and highly cost-efficient in all contexts (high confidence). Where coastal risks are already high, and population size and density are low, or in the aftermath of a coastal disaster, retreat may be especially effective, albeit socially, culturally and politically challenging. {4.4.2.2, 4.4.2.3, 4.4.2.4, 4.4.2.5, 4.4.2.6, 4.4.3}\n\nTechnical limits to hard protection are expected to be reached under high emission scenarios (RCP8.5) beyond 2100 (high confidence) and biophysical limits to EbA may arise during the 21st century, but economic and social barriers arise well before the end of the century (medium confidence). Economic challenges to hard protection increase with higher sea levels and will make adaptation unaffordable before technical limits are reached (high confidence). Drivers other than SLR are expected to contribute more to biophysical limits of EbA. For corals, limits may be reached during this century, due to ocean acidification and ocean warming, and for tidal wetlands due to pollution and infrastructure limiting their inland migration. Limits to accommodation are expected to occur well before limits to protection occur. Limits to retreat are uncertain, reflecting research gaps. Social barriers (including governance challenges) to adaptation are already encountered. {4.4.2.2, 4.4.2.3., 4.4.2.3.2, 4.4.2.5, 4.4.2.6, 4.4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9}\n\nChoosing and implementing responses to SLR presents society with profound governance challenges and difficult social choices, which are inherently political and value laden (high confidence). The large uncertainties about post 2050 SLR, and the substantial impact expected, challenge established planning and decision making practises and introduce the need for coordination within and between governance levels and policy domains. SLR responses also raise equity concerns about marginalising those most vulnerable and could potentially spark or compound social conflict (high confidence). Choosing and implementing responses is further challenged through a lack of resources, vexing trade-offs between safety, conservation and economic development, multiple ways of framing the ‘sea level rise problem’, power relations, and various coastal stakeholders having conflicting interests in the future development of heavily used coastal zones (high confidence). {4.4.2, 4.4.3}\n\nDespite the large uncertainties about post 2050 SLR, adaptation decisions can be made now, facilitated by using decision analysis methods specifically designed to address uncertainty (high confidence). These methods favour flexible responses (i.e., those that can be adapted over time) and periodically adjusted decisions (i.e., adaptive decision making). They use robustness criteria (i.e., effectiveness across a range of circumstances) for evaluating alternative responses instead of standard expected utility criteria (high confidence). One example is adaptation pathway analysis, which has emerged as a low-cost tool to assess long-term coastal responses as sequences of adaptive decisions in the face of dynamic coastal risk characterised by deep uncertainty (medium evidence, high agreement). The range of SLR to be considered in decisions depends on the risk tolerance of stakeholders, with stakeholders whose risk tolerance is low also considering SLR higher than the likely range. {4.1, 4.4.4.3}\n\nAdaptation experience to date demonstrates that using a locally appropriate combination of decision analysis, land use planning, public participation and conflict resolution approaches can help to address the governance challenges faced in responding to SLR (high confidence). Effective SLR responses depend, first, on taking a long-term perspective when making short-term decisions, explicitly accounting for uncertainty of locality-specific risks beyond 2050 (high confidence), and building governance capabilities to tackle the complexity of SLR risk (medium evidence, high agreement). Second, improved coordination of SLR responses across scales, sectors and policy domains can help to address SLR impacts and risk (high confidence). Third, prioritising consideration of social vulnerability and equity underpins efforts to promote fair and just climate resilience and sustainable development (high confidence) and can be helped by creating safe community arenas for meaningful public deliberation and conflict resolution (medium evidence, high agreement). Finally, public awareness and understanding about SLR risks and responses can be improved by drawing on local, indigenous and scientific knowledge systems, together with social learning about locality-specific SLR risk and response potential (high confidence). {4.4.4.2, 4.4.5, Table 4.9}\n\nAchieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and charting Climate Resilient Development Pathways depends in part on ambitious and sustained mitigation efforts to contain SLR coupled with effective adaptation actions to reduce SLR impacts and risk (medium evidence, high agreement).\n\n4.1\n\nSynthesis\n\nShare\n\n4.1.1\n\nPurpose, Scope, and Structure of this Chapter\n\nThis chapter assesses the literature published since the AR5 on past and future contributions to global, regional and ESL changes, associated risk to low-lying islands, coasts, cities and settlements, and response options and pathways to resilience and sustainable development along the coast. The chapter follows the risk framework of AR5, in which risk is assessed in terms of hazard, exposure and vulnerability (Cross-Chapter Box 1 Chapter 1; Box 4.1), and is structured as follows (Figure 4.1):\n\nSection 4.1 (this section) presents a high-level synthesis of our assessment and provides entry points to more specific content found in the other sections.\n\nSection 4.2 assesses the current understanding of processes contributing to mean and extreme SLR globally, regionally and locally, with an emphasis on new insights about the AIS contribution.\n\nSection 4.3 assesses how mean and extreme sea level changes translate into coastal hazards (e.g., flooding, erosion and salinity intrusion), how these interact with socioeconomic drivers of coastal exposure and vulnerability, and how this interaction translates into observed impacts and projected risks for ecosystems, natural resources and human systems.\n\nSection 4.4 assesses the cost, effectiveness, co-benefits, efficiency, and technical limits of different types of SLR responses and identifies governance challenges (also called barriers) associated with choosing and implementing responses. Next, planning, public participation, conflict resolution and decision analysis methods for addressing the identified governance challenges are assessed, as well as practical lessons learned in local cases.\n\n4.1.2\n\nFuture Sea level Rise and Implications for Responses\n\nFor understanding responses to climate-change induced SLR, two aspects of sea level are important to note initially:\n\nClimate-change induced GMSL rise is caused by thermal expansion of ocean water and ocean mass gain, the latter primarily due to a decrease in land-ice mass. However, responses to SLR are local and hence always based on RSL experienced at a particular location. GMSL is modified regionally by climate processes and locally by a variety of factors, some driven or influenced by human activity. Of particular relevance for responding to SLR is anthropogenic subsidence, which can lead to rates of RSL rise that exceed those of climate-induced SLR by an order of magnitude, specifically in delta regions and near cities (4.2.2.4). In these subsiding regions, one available response to prepare for future climate-induced SLR is to manage and reduce anthropogenic subsidence (4.4.2).\n\nThe combination of gradual change of mean sea level with ESL events such as tides, surges and waves causes coastal impacts (4.2.3). ESL events at the coast that are rare today will become more frequent in the future, which means that for many locations, the main starting point for coastal planning and decision making is information on current and future ESL events. One important response for preparing for future SLR is to improve observational systems (tide gauges, wave buoys and remote sensing techniques), because in many places around the world current frequencies and intensities of ESL events are not well understood due to a lack of observational data (4.2.3.4.1).\n\nAfter an increase of sea level from 1–2 mm yr–1 in most regions over the past century, rates of 3–4 mm yr–1 are now being experienced that will further increase to 4–9 mm yr–1 under RCP2.6 and 10–20 mm yr–1 at the end of the century under RCP8.5. Nevertheless, up to 2050, uncertainty in climate change-driven future sea level is relatively small, which provides a robust basis for short-term (≤30 years) adaptation planning. GMSL will rise between 0.24 m (0.17–0.32 m, likely range) under RCP2.6 and 0.32 m (0.23–0.40 m, likely range) under RCP8.5 (medium confidence; 4.2.3). The combined effect of mean and extreme sea levels results in events which are rare in the historical context (return period of 100 years or larger; probability <0.01 yr–1) occurring yearly at some locations by the middle of this century under all emission scenarios (4.2.3.4.1; high confidence). This includes, for instance, those parts of the intertropical low-lying coasts that are currently exposed to storm surges only infrequently. Hence, additional adaptation is needed irrespective of the uncertainties in future global GHG emissions and the Antarctic contribution to SLR.\n\nBeyond 2050, uncertainty in climate change induced SLR increases substantially due to uncertainties in emission scenarios and the associated climate changes, and the response of the AIS in a warmer world. Combining process-model based studies in which there is medium confidence, it is found that GMSL is projected to rise between 0.43 m (0.29–0.59 m, likely range) under RCP 2.6 and 0.84 m (0.61–1.10 m, likely range) under RCP 8.5 by 2100 (Figure 4.3). The range that needs to be considered for planning and implementing coastal responses depends on the risk tolerance of stakeholders (i.e., those deciding and those affected by a decision; 4.4.4.3.2). Stakeholders that are risk tolerant (e.g., those planning for investments that can be very easily adapted to unforeseen conditions) may prefer to use the likely ranges of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for long-term adaptation planning. Stakeholders with a low risk tolerance (e.g., those planning for coastal safety in cities and long term investment in critical infrastructure) may also consider SLR above this range, because there is a 17% chance that GMSL will exceed 0.59 m under RCP2.6 and 1.10 m under RCP8.5 in 2100. Process-model based studies cannot yet provide this information, but expert elicitation studies show that a GMSL of 2 m in 2100 cannot be ruled out (4.2.3).\n\nDespite the large uncertainty in late 21st century SLR, progress in adaptation planning and implementation is feasible today and may be economically beneficial. Many coastal decisions with time horizons of decades to over a century are made today (e.g., critical infrastructure, coastal protection works, city planning, etc.) and accounting for relative SLR can improve these decisions. Decision-analysis methods specifically targeting situations of large uncertainty are available and, combined with suitable planning, public participation and conflict resolution processes, can improve outcomes (high confidence; 4.4.4.2, 4.4.4.3). For example, adaptation pathway analysis recognises and enables sequenced long-term decision making in the face of dynamic coastal risk characterised by deep uncertainty (medium evidence, high agreement; 4.4.4.3.4). The use of these decision-analysis tools can be integrated into statutory land use or spatial planning provisions to formalise these decisions and enable effective implementation by relevant governing authorities (4.4.4.2).\n\nBeyond 2100, sea level will continue to rise for centuries and will remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence; 4.2.3.5). Only a few modelling studies are available for SLR beyond 2100. However, all studies agree that the difference in GMSL between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 increases substantially on multi-centennial and millennial time scales (very high confidence). On a millennial time scale, this difference is about 10 metres in some model simulations, whereas it is only several decimetres at the end of 21st century. The larger the emissions the larger the risks associated with SLR as already assessed in SR1.5. Under RCP8.5 the few available studies indicate a likely range of 2.3–5.4 m (low confidence) in 2300. With strong mitigation efforts (RCP2.6), SLR will be kept to a likely range of 0.6–1.1 m (Figure 4.2). Regardless, ambitious and sustained adaptation efforts are needed to reduce risks.\n\n4.1.3\n\nSea Level Rise Impacts and Implications for Responses\n\nRising mean and increasingly extreme sea level threaten coastal zones through a range of coastal hazards including (i) the permanent submergence of land by higher mean sea levels or mean high tides; (ii) more frequent or intense coastal flooding; (iii) enhanced coastal erosion; (iv) loss and change of coastal ecosystems; (v) salinisation of soils, ground and surface water; and (vi) impeded drainage. At the century scale and without adaptation, the vast majority of low-lying islands, coasts and communities face substantial risk from these coastal hazards, whether they are urban or rural, continental or island, at any latitude, and irrespective of their level of development (Section 4.3.4; Figure 4.3; high confidence). In the absence of an ambitious increase in adaptation efforts compared to those currently underway, high to very high risks are expected in many coastal geographies at the upper end of the RCP8.5 likely range. These include resource-rich coastal cities, urban atoll islands, densely populated deltas, and Arctic communities (Chapter 4 Box 4; Figure 4.3 and Section 4.3.4). At the same time coastal protection is very effective and cost-efficient for cities but not for less densely populated rural areas. Some geographies, such as urban atoll islands and Arctic communities face high risk even under RCP2.6 (medium confidence).\n\nIn many places, however, non SLR-related, local environmental and human dimensions of exposure and vulnerability play a critical role in increasing exposure and vulnerability to coastal hazards (Section 4.3.2.5). For example, the ability of morphological and ecological systems (Sections 4.3.3.3 and 4.3.3.5) to protect human settlements and infrastructure by attenuating ESL events and stabilising shorelines is progressively being lost due to coastal squeeze, pollution, habitat degradation and fragmentation (Section 4.3.3.5.4; high confidence). Hence, an important near term response to RSL rise is to reduce these adverse environmental and human dimensions of exposure and vulnerability. In addition, the drivers of exposure and vulnerability vary across different coastal contexts ranging from resource-rich cities to small islands (Sections 4.3.3, 4.3.4). Accordingly, effective responses need to be context-specific, and address the locality-specific drivers of risk.\n\n4.1.4\n\nResponse Options, Governance Challenges and Ways Forward\n\nResponding to SLR refers to reducing hazards, exposure and vulnerability of low-lying coastal areas. It can be approached in fundamentally different ways and five major categories are described in this chapter (Box 4.3): Protection reduces coastal risk and impacts by blocking the inland propagation and other effects of mean or extreme sea levels hazards (e.g., through dikes, seawalls, storm surge barriers, breakwaters, beach-dune systems, etc.). Advance creates new land by building seawards (e.g., reclamation of new land above sea levels or planting vegetation with the specific intention to support natural accretion of land). Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) provides a combination of the benefits of protect and advance strategies based on the conservation and restoration of ecosystems such as reefs and coastal vegetation. Accommodation includes a diverse set of biophysical and institutional responses to reduce vulnerability of coastal residents, human activities, ecosystems and the built environment (e.g., raising buildings, planting salt tolerant crops, insurance and EWS for ESL events). Retreat reduces exposure to coastal hazards by moving people, assets and human activities out of the exposed coastal area.\n\nEach type of response has particular advantages and disadvantages, and may play a synergistic role in an integrated and sequenced response to SLR. For example, hard protection needs less space and its effectiveness is more predictable than for EbA (high confidence; 4.4.2.2.4, 4.4.2.3.4). EbA has advantages of contributing to conservation goals and providing additional ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and improved water quality (4.4.2.2.5). EbA can become more effective over time, because coastal ecosystems can migrate inland with rising sea levels, provided this is not restricted by infrastructure (4.4.2.2.4). In practise, hard, sediment-based and ecosystem-based protection responses are often combined and there is high agreement that such hybrid approaches are a promising way forward (4.4.2.3.1). Advance is an option widely practised when land is scarce and offers the opportunity to finance adaptation through land sale revenues, but can also increase exposure and destroy coastal wetlands and their protective function (4.4.2.4). Accommodation measures such as flood proofing buildings, flood forecasting, early warning and emergency planning have high benefit-cost ratios, which means that implementing them is much cheaper than doing nothing (4.4.2.5.6). Retreat, and avoidance of development in some locations, are the only types of responses that eliminate residual risks, assuming there is sufficiently safe alternative land to retreat to or develop (4.4.2.6, Cross-Chapter Box 9).\n\nGiven diverse geographies and contexts (4.1.3), and the pros and cons of different responses, there is no silver bullet for responding to SLR. Rather, each coastal locality requires a tailor-made response that uses an appropriate mix of measures, sequenced over time as sea level rises. Possible integrated response strategies are illustrated for two contrasting types of settlements: densely populated urban and sparsely populated rural coasts.\n\nFor densely populated urban low elevation areas, including continental and island cities and megacities, hard protection has played and will continue to play the central role in response strategies (4.4.2.2, Box 4.1). In general, it is technologically feasible and economically efficient to protect large parts of cities against 21st century SLR (high confidence; 4.4.2.2.4, 4.4.2.7). However, questions of affordability remain for poorer and developing regions (4.3.3.4, 4.4.2.2.3). In cities, advance can offer a way to finance coastal protection through revenues generated from newly created land (4.4.2.4), but raises equity concerns with regard to the distribution of costs and access to the new land (4.4.2.4.6). Where space is available, EbA can supplement hard protection (4.4.2.3), except in situations where other human interventions, like infrastructure and pollution, interfere with EbA, especially for RCP8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 9). Retreat may currently be favoured over rebuilding in the aftermath of major flooding disasters, but in densely populated areas protected by hard infrastructure, general retreat need not be considered until later in the century once it is known whether or not SLR will reach the higher end of the projections (1.1 m or more by 2100; 4.4.2.6).\n\nAlong sparsely populated rural coasts, safeguarding communities by conserving coastal ecosystems and natural morphodynamic processes, and restoring those already degraded, is the central element of an integrated strategy. Intact coastal ecosystems can protect settlements and, in some contexts, natural sedimentation processes and avoiding sand mining can help to raise exposed land (4.4.2.2). Hard coastal protection can lead to flooding or erosion elsewhere (4.4.2.2.5), and the destruction of ecosystems and the coastal protection they offer (4.3.3.5). Ecosystem health can be further maintained by reducing non-climatic drivers such as those that interrupt sediment flows in deltas and estuaries (4.3.2.3). Hard protection may be appropriate for areas containing high value assets (e.g., settlements and cultural sites). Retreat is worth considering now where coastal population size and density is low, risks are already high, and the economic, cultural and sociopolitical impacts of retreat and resettlement are carefully considered and addressed by at-risk communities and their governing authorities.\n\nDesigning and implementing an appropriate mix of responses is not only a technical task but also an inherently political and value-laden social choice that involves trade-offs between multiple values, goals and interests (Section 4.4.3). Specifically, distinctive features of SLR together with this complex nature of social choices give rise to five overarching governance challenges (Section 4.4.3.3):\n\nTime horizon and uncertainty associated with SLR beyond 2050 challenge standard planning and decision making practises (high confidence).\n\nCross-scale and cross-domain coordination linking differing jurisdictional levels, sectors and policy domains is often needed for effective responses (medium confidence).\n\nEquity and social vulnerability are often negatively affected by SLR and also responses to SLR, which can undermine societal aspirations such as achieving the SDGs (high confidence).\n\nSocial conflict (i.e., nonviolent struggle between groups, organisations and communities over values, interests, resources, and influence or power) caused or exacerbated by SLR could escalate over time and become very difficult to resolve (high confidence).\n\nComplexity, reinforced by the combination of the above challenges, makes it difficult to understand and address SLR (high confidence).\n\nThese governance challenges can be addressed through an integrated combination of well-established and emerging planning, public participation and conflict resolution practices (Section 4.4.4.2), decision analysis methods (Section 4.4.4.3) and enabling conditions (Section 4.4.5). For example, iterative planning and flexible, adaptive and robust decision making (RDM) can help coastal communities to plan for the future and account for SLR uncertainty. Planning can also enable thinking and action across spatial, temporal and governance scales and thus help to coordinate roles and responsibilities across multiple governance levels. Public participation approaches can be designed to account for divergent perspectives in making difficult social choices, enhancing social learning, experimentation and innovation in developing locally appropriate SLR responses. Conflict resolution approaches have considerable potential to improve adaptation prospects by harnessing the productive potential of nonviolent conflict.\n\n4.2\n\nPhysical Basis for Sea Level Change and Associated Hazards\n\nShare\n\nAs a consequence of natural and anthropogenic changes in the climate system, sea level changes are occurring on temporal and spatial scales that threaten coastal communities, cities, and low-lying islands. Sea level in this context means the time average height of the sea surface, thus eliminating short duration fluctuations like waves, surges and tides. GMSL rise refers to an increase in the volume of ocean water caused by warmer water having a lower density, and by the increase in mass caused by loss of land ice or a net loss in terrestrial water reservoirs. Spatial variations in volume changes are related to spatial changes in the climate. In addition, mass changes due to the redistribution of water on the Earth’s surface and deformation of the lithosphere leads to a change in the Earth’s rotation and gravitational field, producing distinct spatial patterns in regional sea level change. In addition to the regional changes associated with contemporary ice and water redistribution, the solid Earth may cause sea level changes due to tectonics, mantle dynamics or glacial isostatic adjustment (see Section 4.2.1.5). These processes cause vertical land motion (VLM) and sea surface height changes at coastlines. Hence, RSL change is defined as the change in the difference in elevation between the land and the sea surface at a specific time and location (Farrell and Clark, 19763). Here, regional sea level refers to spatial scales of around 100 km, while local sea level refers to spatial scales smaller than 10 km.\n\nIn most places around the world, current annual mean rates of RSL changes are typically on the order of a few mm yr–1 (see Figure 4.6). Risk associated with changing sea level also is related to individual events that have a limited duration, superimposed on the background of these gradual changes. As a result, the gradual changes in time and space have to be assessed together with processes that lead to flooding and erosion events. These processes include storm surges, waves and tides or a combination of these processes and lead to ESL events (see Figure 4.4). In this section, newly emerging understanding of these different episodic and gradual aspects of sea level change are assessed, within a context of sea level changes measured directly over the last century, and those inferred for longer geological time scales. This longer-term perspective is important for contextualising future projections of sea level and providing guidance for process-based models of the individual components of SLR, in particular the ice sheets. In addition, anthropogenic subsidence may affect local sea level substantially in many locations but this process is not taken into account in values reported here for projected SLR unless specifically noted.\n\n4.2.1\n\nProcesses of Sea Level Change\n\nSea level changes have been discussed throughout the various IPCC assessment reports as SLR is a key feature of climate change. Complex interactions between the oceans and ice sheets only recently have been recognised as important drivers of processes that can lead to rapid dynamical changes in the ice sheets. Understanding of basal melt below the ice shelves, ice calving processes and glacial hydrological processes was also limited. Projections of future sea level in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4; Lemke et al., 20074) were presented with the caveat that dynamical ice sheet processes were not accounted for, as our physical understanding of these processes was too rudimentary and no literature could be assessed (Bindoff et al., 20075). In AR5 (Church et al., 20136), a first attempt was made to quantify the dynamic contribution of the ice sheets, although still with modeling based on limited physcis, relying mainly on an extrapolation of existing observations (Little et al., 20137) and a single process based case study (Bindschadler et al., 20138). Here the focus is on sea level changes around coastlines and low-lying islands, updating the GMSL rise by including a new estimate of the dynamic contribution of Antarctica. The mechanism driving past and contemporary sea level changes and episodic extremes of sea level is explained, and confidence in regional projections of future sea level over the 21st century and beyond is assessed.\n\n4.2.1.1\n\nIce Sheets and Ice Shelves\n\nThe ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica contain most of the fresh water on the Earth’s surface. As a consequence, they have the greatest potential to cause changes in sea level. Figure 4.4 illustrates the size of land ice reservoirs and the most important processes that drive mass changes of ice sheets.\n\nIce sheets change sea level through the loss or gain of ice above flotation, defined as the ice thickness in exceedance of the smallest thickness that would remain in contact with the sea floor at hydrostatic equilibrium. The GIS is currently losing mass at roughly twice the pace of the AIS (Table 4.1). However, Antarctica contains eight times more ice above flotation than Greenland. Furthermore, a substantial fraction of the AIS rests on bedrock below sea level, making the ice sheet responsive to changes in ocean-driven melt and possibly vulnerable to marine ice sheet instabilities (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3) that can drive rapid mass loss.\n\nIce sheets gain or lose mass through changes in surface mass balance (SMB), the sum of accumulation and ablation controlled by atmospheric processes, the loss of ice to the ocean though melting of ice shelves, and by calving (breaking off of ice bergs) at marine-terminating ice fronts (see Chapter 3). Ice shelves, the floating extensions of grounded ice flowing into the ocean (Figure 4.4) do not directly contribute to sea level, but they play an important role in ice sheet dynamics by providing resistance to the seaward flow of the grounded ice upstream (Fürst et al., 20169; Reese et al., 2018b10). Ice shelves gain mass through the inflow of ice from the ice sheet, precipitation, and accretion at the ice-ocean interface. They lose mass through a combination of calving and by melting from below, especially where basal ice is in contact with warm water (Paolo et al., 2015, Khazendar et al., 2016). Calving rates at the terminus of marine terminating ice fronts are governed by complex ice-mechanical processes, the internal strength of the ice, and interaction with ocean waves and tides (Benn et al., 200711; Bassis, 201112; Massom et al., 201813). Sub-ice shelf melts rates are controlled by ice-ocean interactions involving the large-scale circulation, more localised heat and fresh water fluxes, and micro (mm)-scale processes in the ice-ocean boundary layer (Gayen et al., 201514; Dinniman et al., 201615; Schodlok et al., 201616). Ice shelves are also impacted by surface processes. Where surface melt rates are high, ice shelves not only lose mass, they can collapse (hydrofracture) from flexural stresses caused by the movement of the meltwater and the deepening of water-filled crevasses (Banwell et al., 201317; Macayeal and Sergienko, 201318; Kuipers Munneke et al., 201419). These complex ice-ocean interactions, calving and hydrofracture processes remain difficult to model, particularly at the scale of ice sheets.Our understanding of ice sheets has progressed substantially since AR5, although deep uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1) remains with regard to their potential contribution to future SLR on time scales longer than a century under any given emissions scenario. This is particularly true for Antarctica.\n\n4.2.1.2\n\nGlaciers\n\nGlaciers outside of the GIS and AIS are important contributors to sea level change (Figure 4.4). Because of their specific accumulation and ablation rates, which are often high compared to those of the ice sheets, they are sensitive indicators of climate change and respond quickly to changes in climate. Over the past century, glaciers have added more mass to the ocean than the GIS and AIS combined (Gregory et al., 201320). However, the mass of glaciers is small by comparison, equivalent to only 0.32 ± 0.08 m mean SLR if only the fraction of ice above sea level is considered (Farinotti et al., 201921). Sections 2.2.3, 3.3.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2 provide a detailed discussion of glacier response to climate change.\n\n4.2.1.3\n\nOcean Processes\n\nIn general, increasing temperatures lead to a lower density (‘thermal expansion’) and therefore the larger its volume per unit of mass. Thus, warming leads to a higher sea level even when the ocean mass remains constant. Over at least the last 1500 years changes in sea level were related to global mean temperatures (Kopp et al., 201622), partly because of ice mass loss, and partly because of thermal expansion. Models and observations indicate that over recent decades, more than 90% of the increase in energy in the climate system has been stored in the ocean. Hence, thermal expansion provides insight into climate sensitivity (Church et al., 201323). Findings from sea level studies and the energy budget are consistent (Otto et al., 201324). As thermal expansion per degree is dependent on the temperature itself, heat uptake by a warm region has a larger impact on SLR than heat uptake by a cold region. This contributes to regional changes in sea level, which are also caused by the water temperature and salinity variations (e.g., Lowe and Gregory, 2006; Suzuki and Ishii, 201125; Bouttes et al., 201426; Saenko et al., 201527). Regional patterns in sea level change are also modified from the global average by oceanic and atmospheric (fluid) dynamics (Griffies and Greatbatch, 201228), including trends in ocean currents, redistribution of temperature and salinity (sea water density), buoyancy, and atmospheric pressure. An analysis of these trends in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs; Yin, 2012) demonstrates the potential for >15 cm of SLR by 2100 and >30 cm by 2300 (RCP8.5) along the east coast of the USA and Canada from fluid dynamical processes alone. However, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) GCM simulations are not yet available for an updated analysis of these processes in SROCC.\n\n4.2.1.4\n\nTerrestrial Reservoirs\n\nGlobal sea level changes are also affected by changes in terrestrial reservoirs of liquid water. Withdrawal of groundwater and storage of fresh water through dam construction (Chao et al., 200829; Fiedler and Conrad, 201030) in the earlier parts of the 20th century dominated, leading to sea level fall, but in recent decades, land water depletion due to domestic, agricultural and industrial usage has begun to contribute to sea level change (Wada et al., 201731). Changes in terrestrial reservoirs may also be related to climate variability: in particular, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a strong impact on precipitation distribution and temporary storage of water on continents (Boening et al., 201232; Cazenave et al., 201233; Fasullo et al., 201334).\n\n4.2.1.5\n\nGeodynamic Processes\n\nChanging distributions of water mass between land, ice and ocean reservoirs cause nearly instantaneous changes in the Earth’s gravity field and rotation, and elastic deformation of the solid Earth. These processes combine to produce spatially varying patterns of sea level change (Mitrovica et al., 200135; Mitrovica et al., 201136). For example, adjacent to an ice sheet losing mass, reduced gravitational attraction between the ice and nearby ocean causes RSL to fall, despite the rise in GMSL from the input of melt water to the ocean. The opposite effect is found far from the ice sheet, where RSL rise can be enhanced as much as 30% relative to the global average.\n\nOn time scales longer than the elastic Earth response, redistributions of water and ice cause time-dependent, visco-elastic deformation. This is observed in regions previously covered by ice during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), including much of Scandinavia and parts of North America (Lambeck et al., 199837; Peltier, 200438), where glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) is causing uplift and a lowering of RSL that continues today. In other locations proximal to the previous ice load, and where a glacial forebulge once existed, the relaxing forebulge can contribute to a relative SLR, as currently being experienced along the coastline of the northeast United States. Water being syphoned to high latitudes as the peripheral bulges collapse leads to a widespread RSL fall in equatorial regions, while the overall loading of ocean crust by melt water can cause uplift of land areas near continental margins, far from the location of previous ice loading (Mitrovica and Milne, 200339; Milne and Mitrovica, 200840). Rates of modern VLM associated with these post-glacial processes are generally on the order of a few mm yr–1 or less, but can exceed 1 cm yr–1 in some places. Because these gravity, rotation, and deformation (GRD) processes control spatial patterns of SLR from melting land ice, they need to be accounted for in regional-to-local sea level assessments. GRD processes are also important for marine-based ice sheets themselves, because they locally reduce RSL at retreating grounding lines which can slow and reduce retreat (Gomez et al., 201541; see 4.3.3.1.2 and Cross-chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3; Larour et al., 201942).\n\nVLM from tectonics and dynamic topography associated with viscous mantle processes also affect spatial patterns of relative sea level change. These geological processes are important for reconstructing ancient sea levels based on geological indicators (Austermann and Mitrovica, 201543; see SM4.1). Along with other natural and anthropogenic processes including volcanism, compaction, and anthropogenic subsidence from ground water extraction (Section 4.2.2.4) these geodynamic processes can be locally important, producing rates of VLM comparable to or greater than recent climate-driven rates of GMSL change (Wöppelmann and Marcos, 201644). In this chapter, GIA and anthropogenic subsidence are used, and other components of VLM are ignored unless explicitly stated.Changing distributions of water mass between land, ice and ocean reservoirs cause nearly instantaneous changes in the Earth’s gravity field and rotation, and elastic deformation of the solid Earth. These processes combine to produce spatially varying patterns of sea level change (Mitrovica et al., 2001; Mitrovica et al., 2011). For example, adjacent to an ice sheet losing mass, reduced gravitational attraction between the ice and nearby ocean causes RSL to fall, despite the rise in GMSL from the input of melt water to the ocean. The opposite effect is found far from the ice sheet, where RSL rise can be enhanced as much as 30% relative to the global average.\n\n4.2.1.6\n\nExtreme Sea Level Events\n\nSuperimposed on gradual changes in RSL, as described in the previous sections, tides, storm surges, waves and other high-frequency processes (Figure 4.4) can be important. Understanding the localised impact of such processes requires detailed knowledge of bathymetry, erosion and sedimentation, as well as a good description of the temporal variability of the wind fields generating waves and storm surges. The potential for compounding effects, like storm surge and high SLR, are of particular concern as they can contribute significantly to flooding risks and extreme events (Little et al., 2015a45). These processes can be captured by hydrodynamical models (see Section 4.2.3.4).\n\n4.2.2\n\nObserved Changes in Sea Level (Past and Present)\n\nSea level changes in the distant geologic past provide information on the size of the ice sheets in climate states different from today. Past intervals with temperatures comparable to or warmer than today are of particular interest, and since AR5 (Masson-Delmotte et al., 201346) they have been increasingly used to test and calibrate process-based ice sheet models used in future projections (DeConto and Pollard, 201647; Edwards et al., 201948; Golledge et al., 201949). These intervals include the mPWP around 3.3–3.0 Ma, when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were similar to today (~300–450 ppmv; Badger et al., 201350; Martínez-Botí et al., 201551; Stap et al., 201652) and global mean temperature was 2ºC–4ºC warmer than pre-industrial (Dutton et al., 2015a53; Haywood et al., 201654) and the LIG around 129–116 ka, when global mean temperature was 0.5ºC–1.0ºC warmer (Capron et al., 201455; Dutton et al., 2015a56; Fischer et al., 201857) and sea surface temperatures were similar to today (Hoffman et al., 201758). Updated reconstructions of GMSL (Dutton et al., 2015a59) based on ancient shoreline elevations corrected to account for geodynamic processes (4.2.1.5), and geochemical records extracted from marine sediment cores, indicate sea levels were >5 m higher than today during these past warm periods (medium confidence).\n\nMost estimates of peak GMSL during the mPWP range between 6 and 30 m higher than today (Miller et al., 201260; Rovere et al., 201461; Dutton et al., 2015a62) but with deep uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1) and few constraints on the high end of the range. The large uncertainty is contributed by uncertain GIA corrections applied to palaeo shoreline indicators (Raymo et al., 201163; Rovere et al., 201464), dynamic topography, the vertical land surface motion associated with Earth’s mantle flow (Rowley et al., 201365), and possible biases in geochemical records of ice volume derived from marine sediments (Raymo et al., 201866). Estimates of GMSL >10 m higher than today require a meltwater contribution from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in addition to the GIS and West Antarctic Ice Sheets (WAIS; Miller et al., 201267; Dutton et al., 2015a68). Pliocene modelling studies appearing since AR5 (Masson-Delmotte et al., 201369) demonstrate the potential for substantial retreat of East Antarctic ice into deep submarine basins (Austermann and Mitrovica, 201570; Pollard et al., 201571; Aitken et al., 201672; DeConto and Pollard, 201673; Gasson et al., 201674; Golledge et al., 201975), as does emerging geological evidence from marine sediment cores recovered from the East Antarctic margin (Cook et al., 201376; Patterson et al., 201477; Bertram et al., 201878). However, the range of maximum Pliocene GMSL contributions from Antarctic modelling (Austermann and Mitrovica, 201579; Pollard et al., 201580; Yamane et al., 201581; DeConto and Pollard, 201682; Gasson et al., 201683) remains large (5.4–17.8 m), providing little additional constraint on the geological estimates. Land surface exposure measurements on sediment sourced from East Antarctica (Shakun et al., 201884) suggests Pliocene ice loss was limited to marine-based ice, where the bedrock is below sea level and possibly prone to marine ice sheet instabilities (Cross-Chapter box 8 in Chapter 3). The total potential contribution to GMSL rise from marine-based ice in Antarctica is ~22.5 m (Fretwell et al., 201385). Combined with the complete loss of the GIS, this could conceivably produce ~30 m of GMSL rise. However, this would require maximum retreat of GIS and AIS to be synchronous, which is not probable due to orbitally paced, inter-hemispheric asymmetries in Greenland and Antarctic climate (de Boer et al., 2017). As such, 25 m is found to be a reasonable upper bound on GMSL during the mPWP, but with low confidence.\n\nAn updated estimate of maximum GMSL during the more geologically recent LIG ranges between 6–9 m higher than today (Dutton et al., 2015a86). This is close to the values reported by a probabilistic analysis of globally distributed sea level indicators (Kopp et al., 200987), but slightly higher than AR5’s central estimate of 6 m. Like the mid-Pliocene, the LIG estimates also suffer from uncertainties in GIA corrections and dynamic topography. Düsterhus et al. (2016)88 applied data assimilation techniques including GIA corrections to the same LIG dataset used by Kopp et al. (2009)89 and found good agreement (7.5 ± 1.1 m likely range) with Kopp et al. (2009) and Dutton et al. (2015a), but the upper range remains poorly constrained. Their estimates of peak LIG sea level are sensitive to the assumed ice history before and after the LIG, consistent with the results of other studies (Lambeck et al., 201290; Dendy et al., 201791). Austermann et al. (2017) compared a compilation of LIG shoreline indicators with dynamic topography simulations. They found that vertical surface motions driven by mantle convection can produce several metres of uncertainty in LIG sea level estimates, but their mean and most probable estimates of 6.7 m and 6.4 m are broadly in line with other estimates.\n\nGreenland and Antarctic climate change on these time scales is influenced by inter-hemispheric differences in polar amplification (Stap et al., 201893), changes in Earth’s orbit, and long-term climate system processes. This complicates relationships between global mean temperature and ice sheet response. On Greenland, the magnitude of LIG summer warming and changes in ice sheet volume continue to be contested. Extreme summer warming of 6ºC or more, reconstructed from ice cores (Dahl-Jensen et al., 201394; Landais et al., 201695; Yau et al., 201696) and lake archives (McFarlin et al., 201897) is in apparent conflict with a persistent, spatially extensive GIS reconstructed from ice cores and radar imaging (Dahl-Jensen et al., 201398). Maximum retreat of the GIS during the LIG varies widely among modelling studies, ranging from ~1 m to ~6 m (Helsen et al., 201399; Quiquet et al., 2013100; Dutton et al., 2015a101; Goelzer et al., 2016102; Yau et al., 2016103); however, the models consistently indicate a small Greenland contribution to GMSL early in the interglacial, implying Antarctica was the dominant contributor to the early interglacial highstand of 6 ± 1.5 m, beginning around 129 ka (Dutton et al., 2015b104). An early LIG loss of Antarctic ice is consistent with recent ice sheet modelling (DeConto and Pollard, 2016105; Goelzer et al., 2016106). Due to its bedrock configuration and susceptibility to marine ice sheet instabilities (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3), the WAIS would have been especially vulnerable to subsurface ocean warming during the LIG (Sutter et al., 2016107). However, most evidence of WAIS retreat during the LIG remains indirect (Steig et al., 2015108) and firm geological evidence has yet to be uncovered. A recent analysis of East Antarctic sediments provides evidence of some ice retreat in Wilkes subglacial basin during the LIG (Wilson and Forsyth, 2018109), but the volume of ice loss is not quantified.\n\nGMSL during the LIG was at times higher than today (virtually certain), with a likely range between 6–9 m, and not expected to be more than 10 m (medium confidence). Due to ongoing uncertainties in the evolution of atmospheric and oceanic warming over and around the ice sheets, and low confidence in the relative contributions of Antarctic versus Greenland meltwater to GMSL change, the LIG is not used here to directly assess the sensitivity of the ice sheets under current or future climate conditions. There is low confidence in the utility of changes in either mPWP or LIG sea level changes to quantitatively inform near-term future rates of GMSL rise.\n\nAn expanded summary of recent advances and ongoing difficulties in reconstructing these time periods in terms of climate, sea level, and implications for the future evolution of ice sheets and sea level is provided in SM4.1.\n\n4.2.2.1\n\nGlobal Mean Sea Level Changes During the Instrumental Period\n\nObservational estimates of the sea level variations over past millennia rely essentially on proxy-based regional relative sea level reconstructions corrected for GIA. Since AR5, the increasing availability of regional proxy-based reconstructions enables the estimation of GMSL change over the last ∼3 kyr. The first statistical integration of the available reconstructions shows that the GMSL experienced variations of ±9 [±7 to ±11] cm (5–95% uncertainty range; Kopp et al., 2016110) over the 2400 years preceding the 20th century (medium confidence). This is more tightly bound than the AR5 assessment which indicated a variability in GMSL that was <±25 cm over the same period. This progress since AR5 confirms that it is virtually certain that the mean rate of GMSL has increased during the last two centuries from relatively low rates of change during the late Holocene (order tenths of mm yr–1) to modern rates (order mm yr–1; Woodruff et al., 2013111).\n\nOver the last two centuries, sea level observations have mostly relied on tide gauge measurements. These records, beginning around 1700 in some locations (Holgate et al., 2012112; PSMSL, 2019113), provide insight into historic sea level trends. Since 1992, the emergence of precise satellite altimetry has advanced our knowledge on GMSL and regional sea level changes considerably through a combination of near global ocean coverage and high spatial resolution. It has also enabled more detailed monitoring of land ice loss. Since 2002, high precision gravity measurements provided by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On missions show the loss of land ice in Greenland and Antarctica, and confirm independent assessments of ice sheet mass changes based on satellite altimetry (Shepherd et al., 2012114; The Imbie team, 2018) and InSAR measurements combined with ice sheet SMB estimates (Noël et al., 2018115; Rignot et al., 2019116). Since 2006, when the array of Argo profiling floats reached near-global coverage, it has been possible to get an accurate estimate of the ocean thermal expansion (down to 2000 m depth) and test the closure of the sea level budget. The combined analysis of the different observing systems that are available has improved significantly the understanding of the magnitude and relative contributions of the different processes causing sea level change. In particular, important progress has been achieved since AR5 on estimating and understanding the increasing contribution of the ice sheets to SLR.\n\n4.2.2.1.1\n\nTide gauge records\n\nThe number of tide gauges has increased over time from only a few in northern Europe in the 18th century to more than 2000 today along the world’s coastlines. Because of their location and limited number, tide gauges sample the ocean sparsely and non-uniformly with a bias towards the Northern Hemisphere. Most tide gauge records are short and have significant gaps. In addition, tide gauges are anchored on land and are affected by the vertical motion of Earth’s crust caused by both natural processes (e.g., GIA, tectonics and sediment compaction; Wöppelmann and Marcos, 2016117; Pfeffer et al., 2017118) and anthropogenic activities (e.g., groundwater depletion, dam building or settling of landfill in urban areas; Raucoules et al., 2013119; Pfeffer et al., 2017120). When estimating the GMSL due to the ocean thermal expansion and land ice melt, tide gauges must be corrected for this VLM, where VLM = GIA + anthropogenic subsidence + (tectonics, natural subsidence). This is possible with stations of the Global Positioning System (GPS) network when they are co-located with tide gauges (Santamaría-Gómez et al., 2017121; Kleinherenbrink et al., 2018122). However, this approach provides information on the VLM over the past two to three decades and has limited value over longer time scales for places where the VLM has varied significantly through the last century (Riva et al., 2017123).\n\nAR5 assessed the different strategies to estimate the 20th century GMSL changes. These strategies only accounted for the inhomogeneous space and time coverage of tide gauge data and for the VLM induced by GIA (Figure 4.5). Since AR5 two new approaches have been developed. The first one uses a Kalman smoother which combines tide gauge records with the spatial patterns associated with ocean dynamic change, change in land ice and GIA. It enables accounting for the inhomogeneous distribution of tide gauges and the VLM associated with both GIA and current land ice loss (Hay et al., 2015124; Figure 4.5). The second approach uses ad hoc corrections to tide gauge records with an additional spatial pattern associated with changes in terrestrial water storage to account for the inhomogeneous distribution in tide gauges. It also accounts for the total VLM (Dangendorf et al., 2017125; Figure 4.5). Both methods yield significantly lower GMSL changes over the period 1950–1970 than previous estimates, leading to long-term trends since 1900 that are smaller than previous estimates by 0.4 mm yr–1 (Figure 4.5). Different arguments including biases in the tide gauge datasets (Hamlington and Thompson, 2015126), biases in the averaging technique and absence of VLM correction (Dangendorf et al., 2017127), or in the spatial patterns associated with the sea level contributions (Hamlington et al., 2018128) have been proposed to explain these smaller GMSL rates. There is no agreement yet on which is the primary reason for the differences and it is not clear whether all the reasons invoked can actually explain all the differences across reconstructions. As there is no clear evidence to discard any reconstruction, this assessment considers the ensemble of AR5 sea level reconstructions augmented by the two recent reconstructions from Hay et al. (2015)129 and Dangendorf et al. (2017)130 to evaluate the GMSL changes over the 20th century. On this basis, it is estimated that it is very likely that the long-term trend in GMSL estimated from tide gauge records is 1.5 (1.1–1.9) mm yr–1 between 1902 and 2010 for a total SLR of 0.16 (0.12–0.21) m (see also Table 4.1). This estimate is consistent with the AR5 assessment (but with an increased uncertainty range) and confirms that it is virtually certain that GMSL rates over the 20th century are several times as large as GMSL rates during the late Holocene (see 4.2.2.1). Over the 20th century the GMSL record also shows an acceleration (high confidence) as now four out of five reconstructions extending back to at least 1902 show a robust acceleration (Jevrejeva et al., 2008131; Church and White, 2011132; Ray and Douglas, 2011133; Haigh et al., 2014b134; Hay et al., 2015135; Watson, 2016136; Dangendorf et al., 2017137). The estimates of the acceleration ranges between -0.002–0.019 mm yr–1 over 1902–2010 are consistent with AR5.\n\n4.2.2.1.2\n\nSatellite altimetry\n\nHigh precision satellite altimetry started in October 1992 with the launch of the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of spacecraft. Since then, 11 satellite altimeters have been launched providing nearly global sea level measurements (up to ±82° latitude) over more than 25 years. Six groups (AVISO/CNES, SL_cci/ESA, University of Colorado, CSIRO, NASA/GSFC, NOAA; Nerem et al., 2010;138 Henry et al., 2014139; Leuliette, 2015140; Watson et al., 2015141; Beckley et al., 2017142; Legeais et al., 2018143) provide altimetry-based GMSL time series. Since AR5, several studies using two independent approaches based on tide gauge records (Watson et al., 2015144) and the sea level budget closure (Chen et al., 2017145; Dieng et al., 2017146) identified a drift of 1.5 (0.4–3.4) mm yr–1 in TOPEX A from January 1993 to February 1999. Accounting for this drift leads to a revised GMSL rate from satellite altimetry of 3.16 (2.79–3.53) for 1993–2015 (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018147; see Table 4.1) compared to 3.3 mm yr–1 (2.7–3.9) for 1993–2010 in AR5. Compared to AR5, the revised satellite altimetry GMSL estimates now show with high confidence an acceleration of 0.084 (0.059–0.090) mm yr–1 over 1993–2015 (5–95% uncertainty range; Watson et al., 2015148; Nerem et al., 2018149). This acceleration is due to an increase in Greenland mass loss since the 2000s (Chen et al., 2017150; Dieng et al., 2017151) and a slight increase in all other contributions probably partly due to the recovery from the Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991 (Fasullo et al., 2016152) and partly due to increased GHG concentrations e.g., (Slangen et al., 2016153; high confidence). The current sea level rise is 3.6 ± 0.3 mm yr–1 over 2006–2015 (90% confidence level). This is the highest rate measured by satellite altimetry (Ablain et al., 2019154; medium confidence). Before the satellite altimetry era, the highest rate of sea level rise recorded was reached during the period 1935–1944. It amounted 2.5 ± 0.7 mm yr–1 (estimate at the 90% confidence level from sea level reconstructions; Church and White, 2011155; Ray and Douglas, 2011156; Jevrejeva et al., 2008157; Hay et al., 2015158; Dangendorf et al., 2017159). This is expected to be smaller than the current rate of sea level rise, making the current sea level rise the highest on instrumental record (medium confidence).\n\n4.2.2.2\n\nContributions to Global Mean Sea Level Change During the Instrumental Period\n\nThe different contributions to the GMSL rise are independently observed over various time scales. They are compared with simulated estimates from climate model experiments of CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012160) when available (see Table 4.1). The observations are compared with experiments beginning in the mid-19th century, forced with past time-dependent anthropogenic changes in atmospheric composition, natural forcings due to volcanic aerosols and variations in solar irradiance (Taylor et al., 2012161). The objective is first, to assess understanding of the causes of observed sea level changes and second, to evaluate the ability of coupled climate models to simulate these causes. It enables the evaluation of the confidence level there is in current coupled climate models that form the basis of future sea level projections.\n\n4.2.2.2.1\n\nThermal expansion contribution\n\nThe ocean thermal expansion is caused by excess heat being absorbed by the ocean, as the climate warms. Thermal expansion is estimated from in situ ocean observations and ocean heat content reanalyses that rely on assimilation of data into numerical models (Storto et al., 2017162; Sections 1.8.1.1 and 1.8.1.4; WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018163). Full-depth, high-quality and unbiased ocean temperature profile data with adequate metadata and spatio-temporal coverage are required to estimate thermal expansion and to understand drivers of variability and long-term change (Pfeffer et al., 2018164; Section 5.2.2.2.2).\n\nHistorically, however, observational gaps exist and some ocean regions remain under-sampled to date (Sections 1.8.1.1 and 5.2.2.2.2; Figure 1.3; Appendix 1.A, Figure 1.1). Other factors also introduce uncertainty in estimates of thermal expansion like changes in instrumentation, systematic instrumental errors, changes in the quality control of the data and the mapping method used to produce regular grids (Section 5.2.2.2.2; Palmer et al., 2010165). In the upper 700 m, the largest sources of uncertainty for estimates of global mean thermal expansion from 1970 to 2004 are the choice of mapping methods (Boyer et al., 2016166), followed by the choice of bias correction for the bathythermographic observations (Cheng et al., 2016167; Section 5.2.2.2.2). From 2006 onwards, the uncertainty is considerably reduced (Roemmich et al., 2015168; von Schuckmann et al., 2016169; Wijffels et al., 2016170), because the Argo array reached its targeted near-global (up to ±60° latitude) coverage for the upper 2000 m in November 2007 (Riser et al., 2016171; Section 5.2.2.2.2).\n\nSince AR5, in a community effort, the (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018172) revisited the global mean thermal expansion estimates based on observations only. On the basis of a full-depth 13-member ensemble of global mean thermal expansion time series developed with the latest data and corrections available, they estimated that the global thermal expansion was 1.40 (1.08–1.72) mm yr–1 for 2006–2015, 1.36 (0.96–1.76) mm yr–1 for 1993–2015 (see Table 4.1). While the relative contribution of the upper 300 m did not change (~70%) between 2006–2015 and 1993–2015, the 700–2000 m contribution increased around 10% over the Argo decade (2006–2015), when observations for that depth interval soared (Figure 1.3; Appendix 1.A, Figure 1.1). This suggests that observed changes for 700–2000 m may have been underestimated for 1993–2005. Before 1993, estimates are based on a smaller ensemble of 4 datasets in which no thermal expansion is assumed below 2000 m because of lack of data (see Section 5.2.2.2.2 for more details). This ensemble shows a thermal expansion linear rate of 0.89 (0.84–0.94) mm yr–1 for 1970–2015 (see Table 4.1).\n\nCoupled climate models simulate the historical thermal expansion (see Table 4.1). However, for models that omit the volcanic forcing in their control experiment, the imposition of the historical volcanic forcing during the 20th century results in a spurious time mean negative forcing and a spurious persistent ocean cooling related to the control climate (Gregory, 2010173; Gregory et al., 2013174). Since AR5, the magnitude of this effect has been estimated from historical simulations forced by only natural radiative forcing. Then it has been used to correct the historical simulations forced with the full 20th century forcing (Slangen et al., 2016187; Slangen et al., 2017b188). The resulting ensemble mean of simulated thermal expansion provides a good fit to the observations within the uncertainty ranges of both models and observations (Slangen et al., 2017b189; Cheng et al., 2019190; Table 4.1). The spread, which is essentially due to uncertainty in radiative forcing and uncertainty in the modelled climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake efficiency (Melet and Meyssignac, 2015191), is still larger than the observational uncertainties (Gleckler et al., 2016192; Cheng et al., 2017193; Table 4.1). Compared to AR5, the availability of improved observed and modelled estimates of thermal expansion and the good agreement between both confirm the high confidence level in the simulated thermal expansion using climate models and the high confidence level in their ability to project future thermal expansion.\n\n4.2.2.2.2\n\nOcean mass observations from GRACE and GRACE Follow-On\n\nThe ocean mass changes correspond to the sum of land ice and terrestrial water storage changes. Since 2002, the GRACE and GRACE follow-on missions provide direct estimates of the ocean mass changes and thus they provide an independent estimate of the sum of land ice and terrestrial water storage contributions to sea level. Since AR5, GRACE-based estimates of the ocean mass rates are increasingly consistent (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018194) because of the extended length of GRACE missions’ observations (over 15 years), the improved understanding of data and methods for addressing GRACE limitations (e.g., noise filtering, leakage correction and low-degree spherical harmonics estimates), and the improved knowledge of geophysical corrections applied to GRACE data (e.g., GIA). The most recent estimates (Dieng et al., 2015b195; Reager et al., 2016196; Rietbroek et al., 2016197; Chambers et al., 2017198; Blazquez et al., 2018199; Uebbing et al., 2019200) report a global ocean mass increase of 1.7 (1.4–2.0) mm yr–1 over 2003–2015 (see also Table 4.1). The uncertainty arises essentially from differences in the inversion method to compute the ocean mass (Chen et al., 2013201; Jensen et al., 2013202; Johnson and Chambers, 2013204; Rietbroek et al., 2016205), uncertainties in the geocentre motion and uncertainty in the GIA correction (Blazquez et al., 2018205; Uebbing et al., 2019206). The consistency between estimates of the global mean ocean mass on a monthly time scale has also increased since AR5.\n\n4.2.2.2.3\n\nGlaciers\n\nTo assess the mass contribution of glaciers to sea level change, global estimates are required. Recent updates and temporal extensions of estimates obtained by different methods continue to provide very high confidence in continuing glacier mass loss on the global scale during the past decade (Bamber et al., 2018207; Wouters et al., 2019; Zemp et al., 2019208), see Section 2.2.3 and Appendix 2.A for a detailed discussion also on regional scales). Updates of the reconstructions of Cogley (2009)210, Leclercq et al. (2011)211 and Marzeion et al. (2012)212, presented and compared in Marzeion et al. (2015)212, show increased agreement on rates of mass loss during the entire 20th century (Marzeion et al., 2015213), compared to earlier estimates reported by AR5. The contribution of glaciers that may be missing in inventories or have already melted during the 20th century is hard to constrain (Parkes and Marzeion, 2018215), and there is low confidence in their estimated contribution. These glaciers are thus neglected in the assessment of the sea level budget (Table 4.1).\n\nWhile the agreement between the observational estimates of glacier mass changes and the modelled estimates from glacier models forced with climate model simulations has increased since AR5 (Slangen et al., 2017b216), there is only medium confidence in the use of glacier models to reconstruct sea level change because of the limited number of well-observed glaciers available to evaluate models on long time scales, and because of the small number of model-based global glacier reconstructions.\n\n4.2.2.2.4\n\nGreenland and Antarctic ice sheets\n\nFrequent observations of ice sheet mass changes have only been available since the advent of space observations (see Section 3.3.1). In the pre-satellite era, mass balance was geodetically reconstructed only for the GIS (Kjeldsen et al., 2015217). These geodetic reconstructions empirically constrain the contribution of the GIS to SLR between 1900 and 1983 to 17.2 (10.7–23.2; Kjeldsen et al., 2015218). During the satellite era, three approaches have been developed to estimate ice sheet mass balance: 1) Mass loss is estimated by direct measurements of ice sheet height changes with satellite laser or radar altimetry in combination with climatological/glaciological models for firn density and compaction, 2) the input–output method combines measurements of ice flow velocities estimated from satellite (synthetic aperture radar or optical imagery) across key outlets with estimates of net surface balance derived from ice thickness data, 3) space gravimetry data yields direct estimate of the mass changes by inversion of the anomalies in the gravity field (see Section 3.3.1 for more details). AR5 concluded that the three space-based methods give consistent results. They agree in showing that the rate of SLR due to the GIS and AIS’ contributions has increased since the early 1990s. Since AR5, up-to-date observations confirm this statement with increased confidence for both ice sheets (Rignot et al., 2019219; see Section 3.3.1). The assessment of the literature since AR5 made in Section 3.3.1 shows that the contribution from Greenland to SLR over 2012–2016 (0.68 (0.64–0.72) mm yr–1) was similar to the contribution over 2002–2011 (0.73 (0.67–0.79) mm yr–1) and extremely likely greater than over 1992–2001 (0.02 (0.21–0.25) mm yr–1). The contribution from Antarctica over 2012–2016 (0.55 (0.48–0.62) mm yr–1) was extremely likely greater than over the 2002–2011 period (0.23 (0.16–0.30) mm yr–1) and likely greater than over the period 1992–2001 (0.14 (0.12–0.16); see Section 3.3.1 for more details).\n\nHere, the approach of Section 3.3.1 is followed, using the two multi-method assessments from Bamber et al. (2018)220 and the IMBIE team (2018) to evaluate the contribution of ice sheet mass loss to SLR over 1993–2015 and 2006–2015 (see Table 4.1). These two studies agree with results from the WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group (2018). For the estimation of the AIS contribution, Bamber et al. (2018)221 and the The IMBIE team (2018) use similar but not identical data sources and processing. Both studies find consistent results within uncertainties over both periods. In Table 4.1, the results of these two studies were averaged, and weighted the average on the basis of their uncertainties, because there is no apparent reason to discount either study. For the estimation of the GIS contribution only the Bamber et al. (2018)222 estimate is used, as there is no other multi-method assessment available.\n\n4.2.2.2.5\n\nContributions from water storage on land\n\nWater is stored on land not only in the form of ice but snow, surface water, soil moisture and groundwater. Temporal changes in land water storage, defined as all forms of water stored on land excluding land ice, contribute to observed changes in ocean mass and thus sea level on annual to centennial time scales (Döll et al., 2016225; Reager et al., 2016226; Hamlington et al., 2017227; Wada et al., 2017228). They are caused by both climate variability and direct human interventions, at the multi-decadal to centennial time scales. Over the past century, the main cause for land water storage changes are the groundwater depletion and impoundment of water behind dams in reservoirs (Döll et al., 2016229; Wada et al., 2016230). While the rate of groundwater depletion and thus its contribution to SLR increased during the 20th century and up to today (Wada et al., 2016231), its effect on sea level was more than balanced by the increase in land water storage due to dam construction between 1950 and 2000 (Wada et al., 2016232). Since about 2000, based on hydrological models, the combined effect of both processes is a positive contribution to SLR (Wada et al., 2016233). Decreased water storage in lakes, wetlands and soils due to human activities are less important for ocean mass changes (Wada et al., 2016234). Overall, the integrated effects of the direct human intervention on land hydrology have reduced land water storage during the last decade, increasing the rate of SLR by 0.15–0.24 mm yr–1 (Wada et al., 2016235; Wada et al., 2017236; Scanlon et al., 2018237; WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018238). Over periods of a few decades, land water storage was affected significantly by climate variability (Dieng et al., 2015a239; Reager et al., 2016240; Dieng et al., 2017241). Net land water storage change driven by both climate and direct human interventions can be determined based on GRACE observations and global hydrological modelling. They indicate different estimates of the rate of SLR. Over the period 2002–2014 GRACE-based estimates of the net land water storage (i.e., not including glaciers) show a negative contribution to sea level (e.g., Scanlon et al., 2018) resulting in the negative value after 2006 in Table 1while hydrological models determined a slightly positive one. The reasons for this difference between estimates are not elucidated. There is scientific consensus that uncertainties of both net land water storage contribution to sea level and its individual contributions remain high (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018242). The differences in estimates and the lack of multiple consistent studies give low confidence in the net land water storage contribution to current SLR.\n\n4.2.2.2.6\n\nBudget of global mean sea level change\n\nDrawing on previous sections, the budget of GMSL rise (Table 4.1, Figure 4.5) is assessed with observations over 4 periods: 1901–1990 (which corresponds to the period in the 20th century that is prior to the increase in ice sheet contributions to GMSL rise), 1970–2015 (when ocean observations are sufficiently accurate to estimate the global ocean thermal expansion and when glacier mass balance reconstructions start), 1993–2015 (when precise satellite altimetry is available) and 2006–2015 (when GRACE data is available in addition to satellite altimetry and when the Argo network reaches a near-global coverage). The budget of GMSL rise is also assessed with sea level contributions simulated by climate models over the same periods (Table 4.1, Figure 4.5). The periods 1993–2015 and 2006–2015 are only 23 and 10 years long respectively, short enough so that they can be affected by internal climate variability. Therefore, it is not expected that observations over these periods will be precisely reproduced by climate model historical experiments. For the contribution from land water storage, the estimated effect of direct human intervention was used, neglecting climate-related variations until 2002 (Ngo‐Duc et al., 2005). From 2002 to 2015, total land water storage estimated with GRACE was used. In general, historical simulations of climate models end in 2005. Historical simulations were extended here to 2015 using the RCP8.5 scenario. This choice of RCP scenario is not critical for the simulated sea level, as the different scenarios only start to diverge significantly after the year 2030 (Church et al., 2013243).\n\nFor 1993–2015 and 2006–2015, the observed GMSL rise is consistent within uncertainties with the sum of the estimated observed contributions (Table 4.1). Over the period 1993–2015 the two largest terms are the ocean thermal expansion (accounting for 43% of the observed GMSL rise) and the glacier mass loss (accounting for a further 20%). Compared to AR5, the extended observations corrected for the TOPEX-A drift (see Section 4.2.2.1.2) allow us now to identify an acceleration in the observed SLR over 1993–2015 and to attribute this acceleration mainly to Greenland ice loss along with an acceleration in Antarctic ice loss (Velicogna et al., 2014244; Harig and Simons, 2015245; Chen et al., 2017246; Dieng et al., 2017247; Yi et al., 2017248; see also Sections 4.2.2.2.2, 4.2.2.3.4, 3.3.1). Since 2006, land ice, collectively from glaciers and the ice sheets has become the most important contributor to GMSL rise over the thermal expansion with mountain glaciers contributing 20% and ice sheets 33% (see Table 4.1) . Over the periods 1993–2015, the sum of the observed sea level contributions is consistent with the total observed sea level within uncertainties at monthly-scales (not shown, e.g., Dieng et al., 2017). This is also true for the period 2006–2015, when uncertainties are significantly smaller. This agreement at monthly time scales represents a significant advance since the AR5 in physical understanding of the causes of past GMSL change. It provides an improved basis for the evaluation of models. Given these elements there is high confidence that the current observing system is capable of resolving decadal to multidecadal changes in GMSL and its components (with an uncertainty of <0.7 mm yr–1 at decadal and longer time scales, see Table 4.1 and for example, WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). However, despite this advance since AR5 there are still no comprehensive observations of ocean thermal expansion below 2000 m, in regions covered by sea ice and in marginal seas. The understanding of glacier mass loss can be improved at regional scale and the understanding of the land water storage contribution is still limited. Thus, for smaller changes in sea level of the order of a few tenths of a mm yr–1 at decadal time scales and shorter time scales there is medium confidence in the capability of the current observing system to resolve them (e.g., WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018).\n\nBefore 1992, observations are not sufficient to confidently estimate the ice sheet mass balance and before 1970, the space and time sampling of ocean observations are not sufficient to estimate the global ocean thermal expansion. For these reasons, it is difficult to assess the closure of the GMSL rise budget over 1901–1990 and 1970–2015 (Church et al., 2013249; Gregory et al., 2013250; Jevrejeva et al., 2017251; Meyssignac et al., 2017c252; Slangen et al., 2017b253; Parkes and Marzeion, 2018254). For the period 1970–2015, the thermal expansion of the ocean represents 43% of the observed GMSL rise while the glaciers’ contribution represents 22% (see Table 4.1). This result indicates a slightly smaller contribution from glaciers than reported by AR5. If the GIS contribution and the Antarctic SMB is added, then the sum of the contributors to sea level is in agreement with the low end observed SLR estimates over 1970–2015 (Frederikse et al., 2018255). This result suggests that the contribution of Antarctica ice sheet dynamics to SLR has been small, if any, before the 1990s.\n\nSince AR5, extended simulations along with recent findings in observations and improved model estimates allow for a new more robust, consistent and comprehensive comparison between sea level estimates based on observations and climate model simulations (e.g., Meyssignac et al., 2017c; Slangen et al., 2017b256; Parkes and Marzeion, 2018257). Compared to AR5, the simulated thermal expansion from climate models has improved with a new correction for the volcanic activity (see Section 4.2.2.2.1). The glacier contribution from glacier models forced with inputs from climate models is updated with a new glacier inventory and improvements to the glacier mass balance model (Marzeion et al., 2015258). The simulated Greenland SMB is estimated with a new regional SMB-component downscaling technique, which accounts for the regional variations in components of the Greenland SMB (Noël et al., 2015259; Meyssignac et al., 2017a)260. In addition, an updated groundwater extraction contribution from Döll et al. (2014)261 is now used for the land water storage contribution.\n\nFor the periods 1970–2015, 1993–2015 and 2006–2015 the simulated contributions from thermal expansion, glaciers mass loss and Greenland SMB explain respectively 84%, 81% and 77% of the observed GMSL (see Table 4.1). For all these periods the residual is consistent within uncertainty with the sum of the contribution from land water storage and ice discharge from Greenland and Antarctica. For each period the consistency is improved compared to AR5 (see Table 4.1) although the uncertainty on the residual is slightly larger because of a larger uncertainty in simulated Glaciers and Greenland SMB contributions.\n\nFor the period 1901–1990 the simulated contributions from thermal expansion, glaciers mass loss and Greenland SMB explain only 60% of the observed GMSL and the residual is too large to be explained by the sum of the contribution from land water storage and ice discharge from Greenland and Antarctica. The gap can be explained by a bias in the simulated Greenland SMB and glacier ice loss around Greenland in the early 20th century (Slangen et al., 2017b262). When the glacier model and the Greenland SMB downscaling technique are forced with observed climate from atmospheric reanalyses, rather than the simulated climate from coupled climate models, simulated SLR becomes consistent with the observed SLR (see the dashed blue line on Figure 4.5). This is because atmospheric reanalyses show an increase in air temperatures in and around Greenland over the period 1900–1940, which lead to increased melt in Greenland (Bjørk et al., 2012267; Fettweis et al., 2017268) and surrounding glaciers in the first half of the 20th century. This increase in air temperature over 1900–1940 is not reproduced by climate models (Slangen et al., 2017b269). It may be because this increase in air temperature was due to internal climate variability on temporal and spatial scales that cannot be precisely reproduced by climate models. It may also be due to a bias in atmospheric circulation in climate models (Fettweis et al., 2017270), or an issue with the spatial pattern of the historical aerosol forcing.\n\nIn summary, the agreement between climate model simulations and observations of the global thermal expansion, glacier mass loss and Greenland SMB has improved compared to AR5 for periods starting after 1970. However, for periods prior to 1970, significant discrepancies between climate models and observations arise from the inability of climate models to reproduce some observed regional changes in glacier and GIS SMB around the southern tip of Greenland. It is not clear whether this bias in climate models is due to the internal variability of the climate system or deficiencies in climate models. For this reason, there is still medium confidence in the ability of climate models to simulate past and future changes in glaciers mass loss and Greenland SMB.\n\n4.2.2.3\n\nRegional Sea Level Changes During the Instrumental Period\n\nSea level does not rise uniformly. Observations from tide gauges and satellite altimetry (Figure 4.6) indicate that sea level shows substantial regional variability at decadal to multi-decadal time scales (e.g., Carson et al., 2017; Hamlington et al., 2018271). These regional changes are essentially due to changing winds, air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes, atmospheric pressure loading and the addition of melting ice into the ocean, which alters the ocean circulation (Stammer et al., 2013272; Forget and Ponte, 2015273; Meyssignac et al., 2017b274). The addition of water into the ocean also change the geoid, alter the rotation of the Earth and deform the ocean floor which in turn change sea level (e.g., Tamisiea, 2011; Stammer et al., 2013275).\n\nSea level is rising in all ocean basins (virtual"
