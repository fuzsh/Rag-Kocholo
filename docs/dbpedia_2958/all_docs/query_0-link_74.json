        "text": "Follow the Drinking Gourd\n\nDuring February, Black History Month, Buhl Planetarium presents a true pre-Civil War story about slaves escaping to freedom in the north by following the Big Dipper\n\nIn Carnegie Science Center's planetarium show Follow the Drinking Gourd the \"drinking gourd\" signifies the Big Dipper, which slaves escaping from plantations in the South before the Civil War followed northward to freedom in journeys lasting as long as a year. The show is derived from a children's book by Jeanette Winter which tells the story of a family of slaves that escapes a plantation through the Underground Railroad. Based on actual history, it tells of a sailor named Peg Leg Joe, a secret conductor on the Underground Railroad, who traveled throughout the South singing a song that cryptically gave slaves directions for escaping to the North.\n\nHow was it done? Slaves escaping to the North used the Big Dipper and its relation to the North Star to orient themselves, while they followed a long and difficult route to freedom, as many as 800 miles, much of it on foot, from Mississippi to the Ohio River. The lyric \"When the sun comes back, and the first quail calls,\" refers to migrating quail which returned in the springtime, when slaves typically began their journey. \"The old man is a-waiting,\" was a clue to look for the old sailor, Peg Leg Joe. The \"riverbank\" in the second passage is the Tombigbee River which leads north from the Gulf of Mexico to Tennessee. \"Left foot, peg foot, traveling on,\"-refers to drawings of a peg leg and a foot-drawn on dead trees on the trail so escaping slaves would know they were on the right path. \"When the great big river meets the little river\" is the junction of the Tennessee and Ohio rivers, where fugitive slaves could find guides who would take them further north.\n\nThe show will be presented daily at 2:00 p.m. in February. After that, the show will remain available through\n\nthe end of the school year for school groups. Call 237-3400 for more information.\n\n-Mark Petruzzini\n\nWhen the sun comes back, and the first quail calls,\n\nFollow the drinking gourd.\n\nFor the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom\n\nIf you follow the drinking gourd.\n\nThe riverbank makes a very good road,\n\nThe dead trees will show you the way.\n\nLeft foot, peg foot, traveling on,\n\nFollow the drinking gourd.\n\nThe river ends between two hills,\n\nFollow the drinking gourd.\n\nThere's another river on the other side,\n\nFollow the drinking gourd.\n\nWhen the great big river meets the little river,\n\nFollow the drinking gourd.\n\nFor the old man is a-waiting for to carry you to freedom\n\nIf you follow the drinking gourd.\n\nFlashback to the Future\n\nPlanetarium Show Celebrates Space Age Firsts\n\nTravel through time and relive events that represent the Space Age during the Henry Buhl, Jr. Planetarium's latest production Flashback to the Future, 40 Years of Space Exploration...and Counting, showing now through March 6.\n\nAudiences ride along with the Soviet pioneers who made space history when they launched Sputnik, a 23-inch metal sphere containing a radio beacon, on October 4, 1957. Elvis Presley was all the rage, Eisenhower was sending troops to Little Rock and the Cold War was an ominous threat to world peace as this first satellite orbited Earth. Few scientists believed the Soviets had the sophisticated hardware to achieve such a technological marvel, but their feat shocked the world and they continued to dominate the record books for another 40 years.\n\nAll that changed on May 25, 1961, with President John F. Kennedy's \"Address to Congress on Urgent National Needs.\" This speech launched the space race to the moon, culminating in Apollo 11's landing on the lunar surface July 16, 1969.\n\nProducer James Hughes says the show is \"not just a profile of hardware and launches, but a unique representation of the events that changed our world and how we look at the other worlds in our solar system.\" Indeed, Flashback to the Future depicts the important cultural influence of the space program on the world's population.\n\nSifting through hundreds of hours of NASA film footage, rarely seen Russian launch sequences and the artifacts of popular culture, the program lifts out highlights from the history of rocketry. Beginning back at the dawn of humankind and flashing forward to a manned mission to Mars, a unique multimedia experience awaits planetarium show audiences.\n\n-Jen Sever, Carnegie Science Center\n\nTest Your Knowledge Space \"Firsts\"\n\n1.
