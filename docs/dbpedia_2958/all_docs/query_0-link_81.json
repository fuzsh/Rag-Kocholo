And what are they supposed to say? What does a father tell his son? If you you believed that there's a bond between our future And our past Then try to hold on to what we had, We build them strong, we built to last 'cause this is a mighty town, It's built upon solid ground And everything they tried so hard to kill, We will rebuild This was a big river I want you all to know that I was proud This was a big river, but that was long ago, That's not now This is a big river, And in my heart I know it will rise again The river will rise again"
