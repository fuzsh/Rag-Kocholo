        "text": "Happy Wednesday and welcome to another installment of my weekly feature taking a deeper dive on a song I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date. This time, I decided to turn to Johnny Cash. Even at the time when I ignorantly dismissed country as hillbilly music, The Man in Black always represented something special, with a coolness factor that wasn’t far off from my childhood idol Elvis Presley. And, believe me, it really couldn’t get better than Elvis. This was before I discovered those four lads from Liverpool!\n\nMy specific song pick is Big River, which was written by Cash and first released as a single in March 1958 on Sun Records, the very same label in Memphis, Tenn., where Elvis first recorded. And Roy Orbison. And Jerry Lee Lewis. And Carl Perkins. And the list goes on. When you look at all these names and recognize they all sounded really cool, you know this can’t be bad, even if it would be hillbilly music!\n\nAs the song starts to play, the first thing you notice is a neat-sounding guitar riff played by Luther Perkins. Meanwhile you hear that cool upright bass by Marshall Grant slapping in the background. Then Cash comes in singing the brilliant lines, Now I taught the weeping willow how cry/And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky. I mean, what a great way to kick off a song!\n\nEvidently, American audiences liked it as well. The tale about a man chasing a lost love along the course of the Mississippi River from Saint Paul, Minn. all the way down to New Orleans, La. peaked at no. 4 and no. 14 on Billboard’s country and pop charts, respectively. Big River marked Cash’s fifth top 5 hit on the country chart since his June 1955 debut Cry! Cry! Cry! and his second top 20 song on the pop chart.\n\nHere’s a great live version from the Johnny Cash Show, which aired on ABC Television between 1969 and 1971. The clip doesn’t indicate in which year this footage was captured, but based on comments Cash made during the performance, it looks like it should be 1971. Notably, he sang a third verse that didn’t make the original recording. Cash was backed by The Tennessee Three who at the time featured Bob Woottoon (lead guitar), Grant (bass) and W.S. Holland (drums).\n\nBig River has been covered by numerous other artists. Wikipedia lists more than 15. One of them was none other than Bob Dylan who recorded two takes with The Band in 1967 during The Basement Tapes sessions. Here’s Take 2:\n\nEven better, Dylan also recorded a rendition of Big River during his 1969 sessions with Johnny Cash. This version was officially released in November 2019 on Dylan’s The Bootleg Series Vol. 15: Travelin’ Thru, 1967–1969. Of course, this was way too great to skip. I absolutely love how Dylan and Cash sound together!\n\nFor additional insights, let’s turn to Songfacts:\n\nJohnny Cash was on a touring break when he picked up an article titled “Johnny Cash Has the Big River Blues in His Voice.” Soon after, he wrote a lovelorn country tune about a man who is so smitten by a woman and her irresistible Southern drawl that he pursues her down the Mississippi River – and misses her at every turn. Cash is backed by Luther Perkins on guitar, who delivers an electrifying solo, and Marshall Grant on bass. The single peaked at #4 on the country chart.\n\nCash had a much different sound in mind for the tune before Sun Records founder Sam Phillips got a hold of it. “When I wrote ‘Big River,’ I wrote it [to be sung] real slow, not up-tempo as I did it on record,” he explained in a 1988 interview with biographer Steve Turner. “There was a guitar player named Roy Nichols, who later worked with Merle Haggard, and he used to play that song with me, and he played some really black blues on it. It sounded like a real blues song. Sam Phillips wanted it upbeat, and he made it sound like a rockabilly song.”\n\nCash uses poetic imagery to express his heartache, opening the song with the verse “I taught the weeping willow how to cry, and I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.” The song made a big impression on his daughter Rosanne Cash, who recorded it in 1980 for the album Right or Wrong. She said:\n\n“I think my dad’s ‘Big River’ is one of the most eloquent pieces of American poetry ever written. It is so layered and cinematic. It’s a narrative that starts at the top of the Mississippi River, in St Paul, Minnesota, and ends in New Orleans. It was written about a time when travel was still full of surprises, when it was an exotic trip to go from St Paul to Memphis or New Orleans. He uses alliteration in a thrilling way.\n\nThe first line of the last verse always gives me a thrill. It is positively Shakespearean. I like knowing my dad was so moved by the river, the South, the Delta and the music that arose from that area.\n\nIt inspires me he had such an intuitive and refined sense of narrative and language, that he created a cinematic landscape, a testosterone-fueled chase of a woman down the river, and that he wrote such a driving back beat to hold it together. This is a song that could never be written today, and so it is also a piece of American history and part of the legacy of my family and my country.”\n\nA demo recording included an extra verse that was omitted from the single, but was sometimes included in live performances. The Outlaw Country supergroup The Highwaymen, of which Cash was a member, recorded this in 1985 with each member taking turns singing a verse. Waylon Jennings sang the missing piece:\n\nWell, I pulled into Natchez, next day down the river\n\nBut there wasn’t much there to make the rounders stay very long.\n\nWhen I left it was rainin’ so nobody saw me cry.\n\nBig river, why she doin’ me this way?\n\nCash and Jennings joined Trick Pony on a cover for the country band’s debut album in 2001.\n\nWhen Tom Petty was honored at the 2017 MusiCares gala, he said, “You want to be a songwriter? Listen to ‘Big River’ about 60 times, and you’ll write something.”\n\nBob Dylan also thought the tune was an exceptional piece of songwriting. “There are so many ways you can go at something in a song,” he said. “One thing is to give life to inanimate objects. Johnny Cash is good at that. He’s got the line that goes, ‘A freighter said, ‘She’s been here, but she’s gone, boy, she’s gone.’ That’s great. That’s high art. If you do that once in a song, you usually turn it on its head right then and there.”\n\nThe country folk duo Secret Sisters released this as a single in 2010, backed by Jack White on guitar.\n\nThis was used on the TV show NCIS in the 2007 episode “Requiem.”\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube"
