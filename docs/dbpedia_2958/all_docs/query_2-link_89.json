        "text": "By sheer luck, I’d flagged him down at what he deemed an enviable campsite, with a narrow grass strip abutting some stone ruins and a view of northern Manhattan across the river. He began to settle in, especially after examining a New York State road atlas and concluding that he’d traveled nearly a dozen miles since dawn. “Golly, I did well this afternoon,” he said. “I ain’t going no further. That’s a good day’s work.”\n\nThe atlas itself was a marvel, its pages covered in blue ink—tidy block letters, all caps—such that in places you could scarcely make out the underlying map details. It could have passed for the work of an outsider artist. “I started keeping a regular journal, but I found that I was so tired at the end of the day,” he said. “So what I do is, I keep notes as I go, and that way I don’t have to remember things at night.” He had a computer buried deep in a drybag so that he could type up “a prose account” of the journey when it was complete. “I’ve written three books,” he said. “I’m just not published. Because, by the time I get done writing, I’m so tired of living in the city that I’m ready to go out on another trip!” His notes on the atlas included descriptions of wind and current and waterfowl, as well as of various social interactions and other stray thoughts. Up by the Indian Point nuclear plant, he’d written “Drowning Mona,” the title of a comedy, set nearby, in which a character played by Bette Midler mysteriously drives off a cliff to her death in the Hudson River.\n\nAt night, meanwhile, instead of journaling, he read novels, seeking an escape from his escapism. “Now I’m reading Clive Cussler, something about treasure,” he said. “When I’m home in Montana, I don’t read fiction. I read history and scientific works. Archaeology, physics, astronomy: things that are real. But my life there is, like, sedate. When I get out here, my days are filled with rational thought. It’s constant intellectual and physical interaction with my environment: with the weather, with the river, with the rocks. So I’m totally immersed in reality during my daylight hours, and when I go to camp at night, I do something I don’t do at home: I read these novels. I stop in little towns. At the local library, they have this thing they’ve been doing the past few years—in the front of the library, there’s usually free books. I think they get donated? So I get the authors I like, and when I’m done with ’em, I either throw ’em away or burn ’em in a campfire.” He must have noticed a faint twitch of disapproval on my face, because he quickly added, “What I can’t do is take ’em with me after I’m done.”\n\nWe both looked over at his canoe, with its tarped mounds, and Conant smiled. He seemed to suggest that he was strategically, not wantonly, overloaded. He had a half-dozen gallon-size jugs onboard, capable of carrying up to 50 pounds of water weight, and he stowed them around the bottom of the hull in varying arrangements as ballast to counteract wave action, having learned from some towboat captains down south that they sometimes used more fuel pushing empty barges than full loads, because of the effort required to hold a steady course. When he was anticipating turbulence, he drank deeply without replenishing to increase his canoe’s buoyancy. He was doing that right now, in fact, because the harbor in the city was likely to present “confused seas—waves coming from one direction and another—and if I’m more buoyant I can rock and roll a lot better.”\n\nIt was a delicate calculus—thirst insurance versus maneuverability—especially given that he had long since reached the brackish stage of the river, with salinity increasing by the mile, which ruled out boiling his means of conveyance as a last resort. He said he’d resorted to that option twice while upstate. But an urban environment such as he was now approaching seemed likely to promise spigots or grocery stores, he figured. “I don’t expect to hit anyplace that’s really remote until I get to central New Jersey.”\n\nI grew up in New Jersey. Not central New Jersey, but I’ve got a lifetime’s experience with the fact that most people from elsewhere don’t much care to parse the regions. It is, of course, the most densely populated state in the country. There is the New York City part of Jersey and the Philadelphia part of Jersey. And the shore, but that’s not what he meant; he said the salt concentration in ocean water activated skin allergies, and was best avoided. The idea that you could lose yourself in the middle—that an accomplished Montana outdoorsman, no less, could manage to conceive of sliding inland on inevitably polluted watercourses and anticipate a feeling of remoteness—was, to this product of Sopranos territory, enchanting. Was it even possible to traverse the state by boat? I’d never considered it. The ever-shrinking woods I used to try to disappear in as a boy, while hoping for absolution from travel soccer, abutted a condominium development called Rio Vista, which was a kind of quintessential Jersey joke: there was no view to speak of, and certainly no river.\n\nLooking back at his atlas and at a tide chart by his side, Conant shifted his focus to the more immediate challenges of an industrial environment: the city and the harbor ahead, where the biggest problem, aside from confused seas, was finding accessible and suitably private campsites. To the extent possible, he preferred not to trespass or to appear “slovenly,” as he put it. “People get offended if you sleep out in the open,” he said. “I can travel at night, if necessary—or, you know what I did once? On the Mississippi, I was coming up to a dam, and these signs that said, ‘Do not go further.’ So I pulled up to this arsenal. You know, ‘Do not enter. U.S. government property.’ I had no choice. I tied myself off to a tree and to a log that was horizontal, and I went to sleep right in the boat. And I actually got shut-eye, too!”\n\nI visited again the next afternoon and found Conant “dreaming,” as he soon put it, amid a spread of cheese and condiments. “If you get thirsty, let me know,” he said. Before long, I noticed him pouring capfuls of Tabasco and sipping soy sauce straight from the bottle—“Energizing the flavor buds,” he explained.\n\nHe was eager to apologize for something he’d said the day before, and he hoped that I wasn’t offended. I couldn’t fathom what he was referring to. As I was leaving, he reminded me, he had said that he didn’t care whether or not I managed to publish an article about his voyage. It was a harmless remark—sweet, even. As I understood it, he had meant to emphasize that he valued the companionship and my interest in his adventures more than any esteem publicity might bring him. (“I love telling about my trips,” he’d said.) He was trying to absolve me of any obligation to labor further on his behalf.\n\nApparently, though, he’d been worrying about it ever since. For one thing, he now explained, it wasn’t true. He recognized having one’s work published as a form of professional success, and he wished to contribute to mine. (“This is your life’s work!”) And then there was the matter of his own manuscripts—two of which, he now said, he was carrying with him on flash drives. “I was going to give you one, but I thought, nah, that’s going over the edge,” he said. “But you know what I can do is, if we develop a certain email rapport, so to speak, I’ll send you a snippet, I guess. Maybe 20 to 30 pages? Something particularly neat that you might like.”\n\nMy interest this day was more transactional. Though I had enjoyed hearing his stories maybe as much as he had enjoyed sharing them, I now had some basic logistical questions. “When the time comes,” I began, “is there a way that we can get in touch with you?”\n\n“No,” he said, and chuckled, as though the idea were indeed laughable. “I got a cellphone, but I rarely charge it,” he went on. “You know, on my other trips, I didn’t have one at all.” Whatever the case, he wasn’t interested in using his phone for my convenience. I admit that I was more impressed than annoyed and a little envious of his self-possession.\n\nI was left with my digital recorder and the hope that I might get him on the record addressing anything I thought readers might conceivably want to know. Like, for instance: “When you go on a trip like this, you’re gone for a long time. Do you give up your apartment for the time being? Or your house?”\n\nHe laughed again, more nervously this time, and paused. “That’s kind of sensitive,” he said. He paused some more, mumbled about how he supposed it would “get out anyhow,” then took a deep breath and said, “Well, one of the reasons I go on these trips is because I don’t have an apartment.” I’d planned to ask next about how he financed his travel, but he kept going and answered without my prompting. “I was discriminated against in both housing and employment,” he continued. “I was having a rough time. And I managed without going to jail or getting thrown into a mental hospital. Now I’m old enough where I can collect Social Security—and going on a trip like this? It’s cheap. Even though I make very little on Social Security, on a trip like this I can actually save big dollars.” He laughed again. “Like I said, this is much too sensitive. But! It’s the truth.”\n\nBoth of his parents were dead. He had a large number of siblings with whom he seemed to be in only sporadic touch. (“That way they don’t worry.”) The lone stabilizing force in his life, as he now talked about it, seemed to be the “unusual” woman he’d met in Livingston the year before he settled across the mountain pass in Bozeman. This was near the start of yet another river trip, from the Yellowstone to the Missouri to the Mississippi: Montana to the Gulf. Her name was Tracy—“And I don’t want to give you her last name,” he said. “We’re not legally affianced or nothing.” He described their relationship as “very strange but constant” and acknowledged that it was difficult to explain, in light of his itinerant ways. “I very close to proposed to her within five minutes,” he said. “And then I was on my way down the river.”\n\nAt some point, after I’d lost control of the interrogation and submitted once more to the undammed stream of his consciousness, he launched a torrent of a monologue that began with a smoked sausage he’d bought at a grocery store in Minnesota, five years earlier. “I pickled it like I pickle my other stuff, but unfortunately it had a bug,” he explained. “Many microbes will not live in that acetic acid and salt and garlic, but this particular bacteria thrived in the pickle juice. Anyhow, as I was getting down towards, oh, mid- and southern Missouri, I ate some of that, and I got sick as a dog.”\n\nHis sickness coincided with his arrival at a teardrop-shaped island in the Mississippi called Jones Towhead, downriver and around the bend from Chester, Illinois, the commemorative home of Popeye the Sailor. He set up camp in a glade on the northern end, under a light canopy of 80-foot trees. “At the same time, within the nearest surrounding—I think it was 17—counties, in Missouri and Illinois, they had this deluge, just a magnificent rainfall, about five inches of rain that lasted over about two days,” he went on. “And I had dysentery. Not only do you have to evacuate all the time, but I lost my energy completely. And as the river was rising, I had to move my tent and my gear.\n\n“So I’d go to sleep and wake up in the morning, and the water would be lapping at my feet, and I’d have to get up and move my tent again. But the dysentery was so bad that I could only move like 20 feet at a time, and I’d collapse. When I say collapse, I mean totally on my face in the mud. Can’t get up. Had to wait another 20 minutes to get enough—I think it’s ATP?—into my muscles to where I could move again.” (ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is a molecule that transports energy within cells.) “It was the most devastating thing. And so that’s what I’d do: I’d get up, move my gear, fall down, wait for it to pass, get up, move my gear. Make about four or five trips, then collapse in my tent again. Drink water, try to stay hydrated, go back to sleep. Wake up, the water would be at my feet again. It was just—the water kept rising.”\n\nHe stuck twigs upright in the mud to chart the river’s rate of encroachment. “This went on for about two more days. The river level rose about 20 feet. Finally, I got to the top of the towhead, and I thought, ‘Oh my god, when’s this river gonna stop?’ There was only maybe 18 inches of elevation left.” He looked up, and his heart sank: there was driftwood suspended in branches above his head, evidence that it could get much worse. The river, meanwhile, was delivering not just tree limbs but washing machines and the sides of barns swiftly past him.\n\n“The Mississippi is just—I call it the Behemoth,” he said. “I was lucky that it stopped. Anyhow, I had to stay on that island for about ten days to recuperate. I ran out of water, so I collected rainwater off the roof of my tent, and I boiled some river water.” Boiling the Mississippi was a cumbersome project, involving stages of centrifugal sloshing and straining, to reduce sediment “and heavy metals and other noxious chemicals that cling to the mud.” During his convalescence, he watched the ground beneath the canopy blossom into a fragrant carpet of daisies, and he observed the resumption of barge traffic as the trash flushed out. He felt like Odysseus when he was enticed by the Sirens: “The water is calling me but I should not go.” He forced himself to wait until his appetite had returned, and he tested his strength by hauling ever-larger logs—200 and then 300 pounds apiece—to his bonfire.\n\n“I was scared,” he said. “I had made it through a tremendous challenge, but I just had more respect for the river than I had ever had before. And by the time I got to—oh, what’s the name of that town? General Grant had his headquarters there before he went to Columbus…” He meant Cape Girardeau, Missouri. “I forget the name of it. But I got acquainted with the townspeople, and almost—well, I got acquainted with a young woman, but I didn’t fall in love, let’s just put it that way. I was tempted to. I was so glad to be around a woman. And I think it was the fear of dying that I had gotten on that towhead that made me enjoy this person’s presence. It made me feel alive again.”\n\nIt was at this point that what had sounded to me like a survival narrative turned out to be a meditation on the redemptive power of constancy and faith. With his ego and self-confidence restored, he said, he got back on the river—“Told her, ‘I really got to go, I’m not coming back’”—and not long after, during a stopover in the Missouri Bootheel, he received a surprise visit, not for the first time, from Tracy, who was camouflaged in a wig. He had a wistful smile as he recounted the episode and trailed off without mentioning what happened next. “She’s looking to see if I’m healthy and alive,” he added. “I appreciate that. I really do. Nobody else does that.”\n\nA group of teenage boys on dirt bikes had arrived at the beach near Conant’s campsite, and one of them began idly tugging at a set of wheels, for portaging, in the bow of the canoe, while maintaining eye contact with me from a distance of maybe 30 feet, as if to assert his fearlessness. If Conant saw the boy, he didn’t let on. He was lying back again, his tongue energized with the residue of Tabasco and his cheeks flushed with longing. Stung by the poignancy of that nobody-else-does-that remark, I’d hoped to wait until the teens moved on before taking my leave. But daycare pickup loomed. “I wish we could get better acquainted, but time is of the essence,” Conant said, excusing me. “You’re a family man.”\n\nExcerpted from Riverman by Ben McGrath.
