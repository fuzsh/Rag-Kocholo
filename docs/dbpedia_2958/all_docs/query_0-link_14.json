        "text": "In February 2007 Martin Strel, also know as “the hero in a speedo”, began an insane attempt to be the first person to swim the entire length of the world’s most dangerous river, the mighty Amazon. Martin is an endurance swimmer from Slovenia, who swims rivers – the Mississippi, the Danube and the Yangtze to date – to highlight their pollution to the world. Martin is also a rather overweight, horseburger loving Slovenian in his fifties who drinks two bottles of red wine a day… even when swimming.\n\nWhen asked about his special diet by TIME Strel loosely replied:\n\nI drink my wine every day. This is special wine made in Slovenia, you can’t buy it outside the country. Even though I drink a little more than usual, it has less alcohol and sugar, so it’s good for me. This is my idea, not my doctor’s idea.\n\nI understand you also do this while you’re on a swim.\n\nIt helps me a lot, believe me. I could swim 10-12 hours every day like this. I tested many different sorts of wines, and I found this one in 2000. My feeling was, “Beautiful,” and we’ve been together ever since.\n\nHow much wine do you drink a day?\n\nMax is two bottles.\n\nDefinitely one of the world’s few remaining true heroes this ‘no limits’ slovenian wacko’s adventure has been greatly covered by an award winning documentary called Big river man.\n\nRottentomatoes states: Four-time world record-holding endurance swimmer Martin Strel attempts to swim all 3,375 miles of the mighty Amazon River as filmmaker John Maringouin follows him on every stroke of his treacherous and fantastic journey. Over the course of 66 grueling days, the hard-drinking, overweight, 52-year-old Strel draws on sheer willpower to accomplish his lofty goal as a hand-picked group of faith-healers, outsiders, and drunks cheer him along from the shoreline. The resulting film not only focuses on the trials that Strel endured on his record-breaking swim, but also draws much-needed attention to the Amazon Rainforest — a landscape that faces an uncertain future due to the combined stresses of progress and pollution\n\nCheck out the movie’s trailer and get ready to be impressed. Very impressed.\n\nA true hero indeed!"
