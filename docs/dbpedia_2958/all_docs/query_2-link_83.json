        "text": "For my first ever blog post, who better to look at than national treasure Johnny Cash – someone whose genius everyone can agree on. It goes without saying that it’s impossible to pick a favorite Johnny Cash song. But I chose “Big River,” a song he and the Tennessee Two took to #4 on the country charts very early in his career in 1958 (his backing band became the Tennessee Three when drummer W.S. Holland joined in 1960). This is a song that finds its way into many\n\npeople’s top ten favorite Johnny Cash songs. It has been covered by Ian & Sylvia, Hank Williams, Jr, Bill Monroe, Lemmy & Friends, Rosanne Cash, and the Secret Sisters w/ Jack White, and has been somewhat of a staple at Grateful Dead shows over the years.\n\nJohnny Cash grew up in the Mississippi Delta in Dyess, Arkansas and the river loomed large in his psyche. His family farmed the area’s gumbo soil, and their livelihood was subject to the whims of the river. Throughout his career Johnny made other songs about the Mississippi. “Five Feet High and Rising”’ and “The Mississippi Delta Land” both talk of the harshness of the river or its surrounding land, underscoring the fact that it was at once home but at the same time a betraying force.\n\nOf course, the music of the Mississippi Delta provided the foundation for what would become popular Rock music during Johnny Cash’s early years at Sun Records in Memphis. During his speech at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where he played “Big River” onstage, he spoke of the early influences on his music: “I bought some of the recordings by Alan Lomax, who did some field recordings back in the ’30s and ’40s – he took his wire recorder into the alleys and honky-tonks in Mississippi and South Carolina and Louisiana, and I listened to those by the hour and by the day, by the week, and the month, and they influenced a lot of my writing — songs like “Big River” and “Get Rhythm.” Some of the earlier songs that I wrote were influenced by people like Sister Rosetta Tharpe and by Pink Anderson and Blind Lemon Jefferson, and some of the Carolina Street Singers.”\n\nIn an interview on CBC’s The Hour, acclaimed songwriter Rosanne Cash talks of studying “Big River.” She describes it as one of the greatest pieces of songwriting, as even “one of the best pieces of American poetry” that she knows. She remarks about how listening to the song she was able to learn about her father as a young man “fueled by testosterone,” on a chase for a woman. She notes that his cinematic vision of Southern landscape as laid out in “Big River” is comparable to Faulkner’s.\n\nThere is so much I love about this song, but one of my favorite things is the phrasing – many of the rhymes are held about ¾ of the way into the lines, rather than at the ends, with the ending of the lines sung as asides, or as though they are in parentheses. The words he uses are genius – he met her “accidentally,” he heard that she was “cavortin’,” – truly the words of this song each convey so much depth, beauty and precision. They remind me of the best of today’s hip hop and it is clear how much the songwriters of our current day have been influenced by the masters of yesterday.\n\nJohnny Cash is well known for train songs, of which he wrote and/or performed dozens throughout his career. “Big River” has a pulsating, pushing forward, adrenaline-fueled feeling that puts it right into step with those songs both sonically and lyrically. The river in this song is thundering, not languishing, and could just as easily be a train. And though he names off towns along the riverbanks, it is not easily categorized as a travelogue or city “roll-call” type of song. These cities are not the stars of the song. And rather than highlighting the protagonist’s conquests, they are a listing of his woman’s conquests, or the Mississippi’s conquests, with the protagonist seen as a much more passive entity along their shores. He knows that you know that while he can talk a big talk, the truth is he is the loser of this story.\n\n“Big River” also fits into a genre of love triangle songs about betrayal , but what’s so cool about this song is that the protagonist is not only betrayed by the woman, but even more so by the damn river that is both his nemesis and also maybe his own unrequited love. “She loves you, Big River, more than me.” She loves the river more than she loves the protagonist. But the river also recognizes that the woman’s affection for the river out-does the protagonist’s love for the river, leaving him as the third wheel. It is interesting that he speaks of the woman in third person, but the “you” figure in this song is the river – which leads me to feel his sense of being betrayed is felt more strongly to it than to her.\n\nTo deal with his lowly status of being betrayed not only by his woman but also by his river, the protagonist becomes a blustery braggart. He uses larger than life language to describe himself – in fact describing himself the way Johnny Cash would eventually come to be viewed in America as a ridiculously larger than life figure. Like a god sitting atop the earth, he is responsible for the weeping of the willow tree and the movement of the clouds; his tears are so great that he can flood a river.\n\nBut even though we see right through his boasting, we aren’t left with a pity party. The end of the song provides a nod to redemption. The final verse is a repeat of the first, but upon close inspection there are two additional words added. Rather than teaching the willow how to cry, the protagonist says he taught it to “cry, cry, cry.” This is clearly a reference to Johnny Cash’s first hit single, “Cry, Cry, Cry.” That was another love gone wrong song, and in it the protagonist starts out crying but by the end the woman who wronged him is the one who is going to cry. The addition of “cry, cry” forecasts this song’s protagonist as going through the same evolution as the narrator of that other song, such that we can infer that he is really going to be just fine in the end.\n\nBig River lyrics by Johnny Cash\n\nWell I taught the weeping willow how to cry,\n\nAnd I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.\n\nAnd the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River.\n\nAnd I’m gonna sit right here until I die.\n\nI met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nAnd it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.\n\nThen I heard my dream was back downstream cavortin’ in Davenport,\n\nAnd I followed you, Big River, when you called.\n\nThen you took me to St. Louis later on, down the river.\n\nA freighter said she’s been here but she’s gone, boy, she’s gone.\n\nI found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff.\n\nShe raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.\n\nNow, won’t you bat it down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.\n\nTake that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.\n\nGo on, I’ve had enough; dump my blues down into the Gulf.\n\nShe loves you, Big River, more than me.\n\nYes, I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry\n\nAnd I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.\n\nAnd the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River.\n\nAnd I’m gonna sit right here until I die."
