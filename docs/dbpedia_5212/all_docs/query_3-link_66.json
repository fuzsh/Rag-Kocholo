To avoid confusion, I use the terms ‘Savoy’ and ‘Savoyard’ to refer specifically to the duchy of Savoy, while ‘Piedmont-Savoy’ and ‘Sabaudian’ are used for the composite possessions of the duke of Savoy. ‘Lorraine’ designates the composite state of the dukes of Lorraine, except where I have indicated a distinction between the duchy of Lorraine and the duchy of Bar. Equally problematic is the rendering into English of Lorrain/Lorraine, which is both an adjective of nationality and the word for a native of Lorraine; in the interests of simplicity I use the form ‘Lorrain’ for both, e.g. the Lorrain nobility, a Lorrain.\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 8\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI am very grateful to the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the British Academy and the Scouloudi Foundation for their financial support when I was carrying out the research for this book.

Louis XIV’s reign has naturally been the focus of much of this, as the Sun King presided over the acquisition of several new provinces which added significantly to the kingdom’s dimensions. Traditionally, the small states such as Lorraine and Piedmont-Savoy that were conquered, absorbed or dismembered along the way were ignored.Yet in the shadow of both the cultural and transnational ‘turns’, historians have begun to look anew at the way states and societies along the kingdom’s frontiers reacted to growing French influence. French territorial ambitions and c­onsequent military activity during the reign of Louis XIV ensured that a number of territories bordering on France were subject to military occupation for strategic reasons from the 1660s onwards. That these territories were conquered and subsequently handed back to their original rulers is something that historians have so far failed to address. It is the purpose of this book to investigate the occupations of two of these territories, Lorraine and Savoy, both of which were occupied twice during the course of Louis’s personal rule: Lorraine in 1670–97 and 1702–14, Savoy in 1690–96 and again in 1703–13. Part of the reason for the neglect of this topic lies in the curious nature of military occupation: a product of warfare but distinct from the conduct of hostilities.2 This is especially true for the early modern period, when military occupation was a relatively new concept and its definition still imprecise. After 1500, it became widely accepted that rulers could further their war aims through the temporary domination of foreign territory, whereas earlier, during the High Middle Ages, conquest alone made a change of ruler both lawful and lasting. The term occupatio bellica appeared in the seventeenth century as part of the evolution from the medieval theory of just war (bellum iustum) to the theory of legal war (bellum legale publicum), an evolution which occurred in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.3 The conqueror’s rights to dispose of the\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 1\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n2\n\nabsolute monarchy on the frontiers\n\nterritory were upheld by theorists such as Grotius. The rationale was that the conqueror was allowed to reap his just military rewards during the prosecution of war itself. Grotius conceded far-reaching rights and powers to the conqueror over the lives and the freedom of the people of the conquered territory and their movable goods.4 He nevertheless advised moderation in the treatment of conquered populations, and argued that it was better to leave them to govern themselves if this did not interfere with the interests of the conqueror, as this would be beneficial to both parties in the long term.5 As so few studies of societies under occupation in the early modern period have been undertaken in any depth,6 it is necessary to draw on some of the methodological questions that have arisen in the study of more recent military occupations. One particularly useful development is the ambition to open up a comparative study of territories under occupation. In the conclusion to their highly influential publication of the proceedings of a 1990 conference held in Paris, Jean-Pierre Azéma and François Bédarida suggested the importance of studying the comparative history of European countries during the Second World War, adding: ‘In short, far from wishing to erase the differences, comparative history has had as its principal function to bring them very much to the forefront’.7 Philippe Burrin, moreover, has argued that, ‘a comparative method, in aiming to establish similarities and differences, requires an effort at conceptualization that may well lead historians to new questions’.8 Burrin has also shown how Nazi Europe represented a patchwork, as Hitler settled each situation by the expedients dictated by the political, strategic and ideological interests of the moment, hence the variation in the forms of domination, exploitation and persecution.9 Policies of occupation can vary greatly, as is evident if the Nazi ‘patchwork’ is compared with the relative (though by no means straightforward) uniformity of the occupation policies of Napoleon. Tim Blanning also followed this method in attempting to identify the most important similarities and differences between the experience of the Rhineland and that of other parts of Frenchoccupied Germany in the 1790s. The role of the French army was central to that comparison: military exploitation was a common experience shared by all who came under French occupation, but there was considerable variation in the political framework that came with it.10 Such a comparative approach applied to the occupations of Louis XIV’s reign will show whether the Bourbon monarchy applied a uniform structure to its occupations of foreign lands, or whether its methods varied according to time and place. New approaches have also focused on the face-to-face interaction between occupier and occupied, on the levels of both the lived experience and symbolic representation.11 In 2005, for instance, Jacques Hantraye produced a study of the allied occupation of France of 1815–18. This work concentrated on the meeting\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 2\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nof different peoples, and the effects that this had on the collective psychology of both the occupiers and occupied, discussing the complexity of feelings and hesitations, and the confusion of attitudes, caused by the new experience of invasion and occupation. As Hantraye pointed out, ‘this dive into the mass of the population offers many suggestions to those who are interested in earlier occupations’.12 Though the wealth of private letters and journals available to the historian of the modern period is not available for the early modernist, this nevertheless highlights the importance of attempting to reconstruct attitudes in order to understand the way occupations progressed. Historians of the Grand Règne have so far failed to adapt to these methodological developments. Consequently, studies of territories under occupation in this period still tend to focus almost exclusively on the military, legal or administrative aspects of occupation.13 The inherent problem with this approach is that it shows only the official view, and the intentions of the occupier often differed greatly from reality.14 Inadequacies of supply for instance (a chronic problem in the later wars of Louis XIV’s reign, given the ramshackle state of the French economy) meant that, whatever the government’s objectives might have been, soldiers had no choice but to take their subsistence into their own hands.15 Lorraine and Savoy constitute ideal case studies for an initial comparative analysis of French occupations in the reign of Louis XIV. Both territories had much in common with France in language, culture, institutions and social structures. They were also almost exclusively Catholic,16 which largely precludes the need to factor French policy towards Protestants and Jews into the analysis. In many ways, Lorraine and Savoy presented far fewer challenges to French administrators than did Roussillon, Alsace or Flanders, which were all occupied and then permanently annexed.17 In short, Lorraine and Savoy have sufficient in common to make a comparative study of them manageable, but there are also sufficient differences between them to make such a study worthwhile. Furthermore, neither territory has been subjected to recent historical analysis for the period in question.18 An overview of the occupations of Lorraine and Savoy would therefore be valuable in itself. These territories were among the last territorial additions to mainland France: Lorraine was officially annexed on the death of its last duke, Stanislas Leszczyński, in 1766, and Savoy following a plebiscite in 1860. French scholars have devoted much attention and a sizeable quantity of scholarly works to Lorraine. This interest must in part be ascribed to the importance of the region in the national psyche, arising from its partial loss to the German Empire in 1871, together with the long-held historiographical concern about ‘natural frontiers’. English-speaking historians, in contrast, have largely ignored Lorraine, perhaps not fully understanding the situation of this sovereign duchy. Like PiedmontSavoy, it was a state in its own right and a home-grown patriot literature existed:\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 3\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n4\n\nabsolute monarchy on the frontiers\n\nLorrain chroniclers of the eighteenth century wrote virulently anti-French accounts of Louis XIV’s occupation of 1670–97, accounts which had a lasting influence on later historians. These made out that the occupation was almost an act of brigandage, perpetrated with as much bad faith as brutality.19 Nineteenthcentury historians, such as Haussonville, predictably focused excessively on the lives and actions of the princes, rather than the situation in the duchies. However, in 1931, Edgar de Lanouvelle published a re-examination of the official correspondence and a different tale began to emerge: the French governor Marshal Créqui, it was now argued, completed a thankless task with ‘vigour and moderation’.20 But this was still only part of the story. Guy Cabourdin provided an excellent synthesis of existing works on the French occupations of Lorraine in his Encyclopédie illustrée de la Lorraine, but we still lack an up-to-date account based on thorough archival research.21 For Savoy, there exists no systematic study in French or English of the French occupations of 1690–96 and 1703–13. As part of a larger composite state, the duchy of Savoy as an entity in itself has been the subject of few studies.22 Finding things of relevance to the French occupations of the duchy therefore involves usually unrewarding consultation of locally written micro-histories with limited geographical and conceptual focus.23 Moreover, the tradition of local studies as part of French (and Italian) historiography, together with the political destiny which separated Savoy and Nice from Piedmont in 1860, meant that there were until recently few works that dealt with the Savoyard state as a whole: French scholars studied Savoy and Nice while their Italian counterparts studied Piedmont. Recent English-language studies of the Savoyard state, notably those of Geoffrey Symcox and Christopher Storrs, have begun to overcome this limited perspective. Though dealing with the territories of the House of Savoy as a whole, they devote some attention to the importance of the regions, where particularism still held sway against uniformity well into the reign of Victor Amadeus II. Storrs’s work also assesses the impact of the French occupations of Savoy on state formation. Both Storrs and Symcox therefore provide, up to a point, the necessary ‘state-wide’ context in which the duchy of Savoy must be placed.24 Studies of Lorraine and Savoy under occupation also have the potential to reveal much about the workings of the French state, through an investigation of the ways in which the local elites collaborated with the centre, on what terms, and why. Since the 1960s, revisionist historians have discredited the old idea of a powerful, autonomous, absolute monarchy reducing unruly society to obedience in the name of modernity and progress. While Louis XIV succeeded in drawing the state and France’s elites closer together after the Frondes, he was a traditionalist who maintained stability entirely through the effective use of traditional modes of governance.25 Yet there remain sizeable gaps in the work of the\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 4\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nrevisionists: in particular, there is a lack of diversity in provincial studies.William Beik and James Collins provided important studies of Languedoc and Brittany respectively, but both of these provinces were pays d’états; equivalent political studies of the pays conquis have tended to lack the same depth or breadth of vision, with the exception of Georges Livet’s study of Alsace of 1956 and Daryl Dee’s more recent work on the Franche-Comté.26 Another large gap in our understanding of French politics under Louis XIV arises from a still considerable neglect of the crisis-filled second half of the reign. Only very recently have historians begun to analyse the effects of prolonged warfare on the development of the absolute monarchy;27 and based on these initial findings it looks increasingly likely that some of the conclusions of the revisionists – particularly their emphasis on co-operation and compromise – are relevant only to the first half of reign, as the monarchy resorted to more coercive measures after 1688. The occupations of Lorraine and Savoy together span forty-four years of Louis XIV’s personal rule, with Lorraine occupied around the time Louis was developing a new relationship with the pays d’états, and Savoy occupied during the two great wars later in the reign. They therefore offer a particular, if unusual, platform from which to view any evolution in the crown’s relations with the local elites, should any such evolution exist. Another debate to which the study of these occupations can contribute is that of Louis XIV’s policy towards France’s eastern frontier.With the noteworthy exception of Daniel Nordman, most historians in recent years have steered well clear of the issue.28 The topic has been imbued with so many erroneous agendas over the past century and a half, be they nationalist, étatist or whiggish, or simply resulting from an insufficient grasp of archival material, that many have been daunted by the task and decided to leave well alone. While twentiethcentury historians such as Gaston Zeller broke with the old ‘exultant and emphatic’ vision of the national past, they left an extremely fractured picture.29 Historians nowadays tend to agree that no early modern decision maker had any grand strategies for the conduct of foreign relations; as Andrew Lossky put it, ‘Most were pragmatically willing to take advantage of developments to achieve whatever gains were possible.’30 The most recent treatments stress that Louis’ ideas on foreign policy were often disjointed or incompatible, and the changes in his views through his reign were profound. Furthermore, in the field of international relations it has recently been argued that second-rank powers like Piedmont–Savoy helped circumscribe the options of major powers, whose policies may have been more reactive than hitherto appreciated.31 One further theme contributes to the overall shape and content of this book. Lorraine and Savoy were frontier societies, situated in the borderlands between the kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. Though these boundaries were invisible, relations between the French on one side and the\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 5\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n6\n\nabsolute monarchy on the frontiers\n\nLorrains and the Savoyards on the other were conditioned by long-standing and deeply-held preconceptions of each other. These conceptions would have a decisive impact on the course of the occupations. Historians working in the field of frontier studies have called for approaches to and analyses of frontier societies from a local rather than centrist perspective.32 This study therefore aims to provide as much local perspective as possible. It is notoriously difficult, however, for historians of early modern societies to gauge the mood of a large group of people, even using modern methods such as prosopography. The present study does not, therefore, claim to tell the story of these occupations with equal emphasis on both points of view. This would be impossible, given the relative paucity of sources available for the occupied populations in this period. Its focus is principally on France’s policy towards occupied territories.Yet it will become clear that, to fully understand the formulation of French policy, one must take into account the attitudes and priorities of the occupied populations themselves. This study draws upon a wide range of sources, including archival material from Paris, Vincennes, Nancy, Chambéry, Annecy and Turin, as well as relevant secondary literature. Yet, as with many comparative studies, the same quantity and variety of sources are not available for each case study. In the French war archives, the volume of ministerial correspondence grows exponentially during the 1690s and 1700s, but is comparatively scant for much of the earlier period of the occupation of Lorraine, particularly between the Treaty of Nijmegen (1679) and the outbreak of the Nine Years War (1688). Furthermore, the suppression of the sovereign courts of Lorraine in early 1671 meant that the companies kept no records for almost the entire period of the French occupation, effectively depriving the Lorrain elites of any collective voice. By contrast, the periods of occupation of Savoy have left more abundant records, both from the French administrators and from the Savoyard elites. These disparities mean that the behaviour and motivations of both the French and the occupied populations are easier to understand in some periods and in some contexts than in others. Chapter 1 provides some necessary background in terms of French frontier strategy during the seventeenth century, and also relations between France, Lorraine and Piedmont-Savoy in the longer term; it includes a brief account of the occupation of Lorraine under cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin, to provide useful comparison with an earlier occupation. Chapter 2 then gives a narrative analysis of the occupations from the point of view of France’s strategic priorities. Chapters 3 and 4 consider the administrative side of the occupations, in terms of the structures and personnel put in place by the French regime and the financial and security burdens imposed on occupier and occupied. In Part III, the final chapters of the book investigate French policy towards elite groups, and their reactions to French occupation. Chapter 5 looks at the ways in which\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 6\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nthe nobilities responded: whether they chose to collaborate with or resist the French, and what forms that collaboration and resistance took. In Chapter 6, attention turns to those who held offices in occupied territories, in the sovereign courts – where they continued to exist – as well as in the lower, subaltern courts and the towns. Finally, Chapter 7 considers the church: French policies towards, and the responses of, the episcopate, the religious superiors and the lower regular and secular clergy. By taking a thematic, comparative approach to the occupations of Lorraine and Savoy, this book attempts to identify the key similarities and differences between the way the French governed these territories and behaved towards the native populations. It considers the range of dynamic factors that influenced the course of the occupations, placing equal emphasis on issues of geopolitics (i.e., the reasons for the occupations and the reasons for relinquishing the territories), frontier administration and the socio-cultural factors which determined relations between France and the local populations. In doing so, it provides an original perspective on the aims and intentions, and also the limitations, of the early modern French state.\n\nNotes\n\n1 F. Braudel, The identity of France, trans. S.

Through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the rulers and elites of these frontier territories found themselves caught in the ongoing power struggle between the Valois/Bourbons and the Habsburgs, who jostled for influence in these small but strategically vital territories.1 Subject to frequent French military intervention over the centuries, both were occupied either wholly or partly on two separate occasions during the personal rule of Louis XIV. This chapter examines the background to the conquest and occupation of these territories during the reign of the Sun King. It begins with a brief exploration of French Government policies on the eastern frontiers of the kingdom in this period, with the aim of identifying the priorities and mindset of the king and his ministers. This context is essential in understanding the occupations of Savoy and Lorraine. This chapter also seeks to establish the political, social, economic and cultural circumstances of the territories themselves. Historians of more recent military occupations have demonstrated that, to fully comprehend the priorities and attitudes of both occupier and occupied, it is essential to understand the regime that preceded the occupation.2 Lorraine and Savoy were not, as they have sometimes been portrayed, wayward frontier provinces of France. Both were components of larger politico-dynastic sovereign entities which had their own ancient, separate histories.The dukes of Lorraine and Savoy ruled over ‘composite’ states (though they were composite by varying degrees),3 which comprised disparate lands held together principally by bonds of dynastic loyalty. The internal dynamics of these composite political structures would have an important effect on the way these territories responded to foreign occupation, as will become clear in Part III of this book.\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 11\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n12\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nFrench frontier strategy under Louis XIV The first three decades of Louis XIV’s personal rule saw significant territorial additions to the kingdom of France. At the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659, the Spanish province of Rosselló and part of the Cerdanya region were annexed and became the province of Roussillon. In the north, the border was gradually pushed back as parts of the Spanish Netherlands were annexed piecemeal at the Peace of the Pyrenees and the treaties of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668) and Nijmegen (1678), and Lorraine, the Franche-Comté, Strasbourg, Luxembourg and other réunion territories on the north-eastern frontier were conquered in the 1670s and early 1680s (see Map 1). Current thinking on the strategy behind these acquisitions is that Louis XIV was continuing the principal concern of French rulers for centuries: securing the kingdom’s borders through the acquisition of buffer zones and more defensible frontiers.4 The Valois and Bourbon kings had gained territories and fortifications on the Rhine and at strategic sites in northern Italy as a means of pursuing offensive and defensive warfare more effectively. As Gaston Zeller put it, ‘the ideal frontier was not only, nor even principally, that which sheltered the French from invasion; it was above all that which would permit them to carry their arms outside of the kingdom’.5 The real Leitmotiv of Louis XIV’s reign, it now seems, was ensuring the security of the Bourbon dynasty and the maintenance, if not strengthening, of the kingdom by boosting French prestige and influence. Partly this could be attained by the acquisition of territory to further develop these ‘strategic frontiers’ and partly by bringing surrounding smaller states directly into France’s orbit. Louis’s strategic goals were in many ways a continuation of the all-embracing concept of ‘long-term security’ seen in the assertive foreign policy of Cardinal Richelieu, whereby the cardinal sought to gain the greatest possible territorial and strategic advantages for France.6 In particular, Richelieu’s government was preoccupied for much of the early 1630s with the threat of an invasion across France’s eastern frontiers, and adopted the geostrategic concept of ‘gates’ – points of secure entry and exit for troops operating in Germany; he also occupied territories on France’s frontiers as a means of guaranteeing communications with France’s allies while disrupting Habsburg communication routes. Although the French crown routinely advanced dynastic claims to further its strategic aims on the frontiers throughout the seventeenth century, these claims had largely become a mere matter of form. Dynastic ambition was without doubt still a driving force in French foreign policy, but by Louis XIV’s reign it was tempered by a more general stress on considerations of raison d’état.7 These policies also reflected contemporary notions of the frontière, which by the seventeenth century denoted a liminal space at the extremity of the realm, a zone that could shrink, expand or shift location following territorial\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 12\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nlorraine, savoy and the frontiers of france\n\n13\n\nchanges.8 Yet such concepts were far from static through this period. Despite a revisionist stress on limited change in international relations before and after the Peace of Westphalia, improvements in mapping in the second half of the seventeenth century led to a firmer grasp of the nature both of the frontier and of political sovereignty.9 This evolution in mentalities was certainly reflected in policy: from the 1670s, strategists such as Vauban advocated the creation of more linear frontiers and, over the course of Louis XIV’s reign, the northern border which stretched from the North Sea to the Meuse was successfully squared off.10 But in spite of these trends, many of France’s borderlands remained irregular, riddled with enclaves, exclaves and pays indivis (territories where sovereignty was shared), and whose shape was still determined by feudal fief boundaries, well into the eighteenth century.11 This was especially the case in the northeast, where innumerable overlapping feudal jurisdictions meant that the frontier continued to be undefined and confused.12 Linked with these changes, an idea gained currency that the kingdom’s ideal form should constitute a space bounded and enclosed by nature. As Vauban put it in 1693, ‘All the ambitions of France should be contained within the summits of the Alps and the Pyrenees, the Swiss and the two seas: it is there that she should intend to establish her boundaries by legitimate means according to the times and the occasions.’13 While the concept of ‘natural frontiers’ as a guiding principle in Louis XIV’s foreign policy came to be dismissed by historians, thanks to the work of Gaston Zeller, more recent developments in methodology have meant that the debate over France’s ‘natural frontiers’ rumbles on, though with somewhat different points of emphasis. Peter Sahlins has argued that natural frontiers were, in a way, pivotal to French frontier policy, ‘not as boundaries but as passages’.14 Furthermore, Daniel Nordman has pointed out that Zeller ignored the importance of many publications in the seventeenth century, especially by Jesuits, which helped to make natural frontiers such as the Rhine a common image which permeated all levels of society from the nobility to labourers. While this may not have directly influenced the policy of Louis XIV, Nordman argues that the wide extent to which it informed contemporary preoccupations towards territory and strategy should not be ignored.15 Such geographic ‘visions’ of France’s frontiers in the popular consciousness extended not only to the Rhine, but to the entire limits of ancient Gaul, which extended in the south-east to the Alps and the Var.16 Prominent in the popular consciousness though such images may have been, the legitimating discourse in French expansionism in this period was not nature but a combination of history, dynastic inheritance and feudal law. In seventeenth-century Europe, brute conquest alone was rarely seen as sufficient for annexation, and territorial changes needed to be explained and justified by reference to both history and legal titles.17 The French were sensitive to\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 13\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n14\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nthis: under Richelieu, if circumstances dictated the permanent occupation of territories to which France had no dynastic claims, for instance in the towns of Alsace, the concept of military and diplomatic ‘protection’ was used instead; this shielded France from the reputation of Sweden, which was notorious for having claimed territory by right of conquest alone.18 To facilitate its strategic objectives, the French crown developed and maintained an arsenal of jealously guarded claims to territories on the kingdom’s frontiers, which needed to be kept alive, if hibernating, and could be activated whenever necessity dictated. The ‘use and abuse’ of history and feudal law to legitimise French expansionism had come into its own under the cardinal ministers: the annexations of Alsace and Roussillon, for example, were presented as ‘reunions’ of the crown’s legitimate patrimony to the kingdom.19 By the time Louis XIV assumed personal control of his government, therefore, there was already ample precedent for activating latent claims on titles to legitimise a French monarch’s control of conquered territory, which could be strengthened by the invocation of history and the laws of dynastic succession. At the French court, views on frontier states such as Lorraine and Savoy were conditioned also by the presence of a cohort of princes belonging to cadet branches of the ruling dynasties, such as the Lorraine-Guise, the SavoyNemours and the Gonzaga-Nevers. As Jonathan Spangler has recently suggested, these princely clans could be of great use to France in its cross-frontier links in several unofficial ways.20 Their continued presence and importance at court meant that the French Government had a channel of influence to Lorraine and Piedmont-Savoy, by which it could exert pressure and bind the Lorrain and Savoyard rulers to France. These links were also maintained by the presence in these borderlands of elites who belonged to a shared ‘geo-cultural landscape’ and whose family, property and material interests transcended the idea of the linear frontier, as Part III of this study details.21 Yet beyond the ‘society of princes’ and the elites who surrounded them, ideas about occupation, annexation or interstate relations with foreign territories just beyond the frontier did not extend into popular consciousness at this time; French public concepts of these territories were generally limited to crude stereotypes.22 Overall, factors conditioning French relations with Lorraine and Savoy were driven most of all by strategic and dynastic interests, and to a lesser extent by changing concepts of the frontier.The next section investigates these relations in further detail: it looks at diplomatic relations between the rulers, at the ties that existed across the frontier, and also at how France was viewed from within Lorrain and Savoyard societies.\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 14\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nlorraine, savoy and the frontiers of france\n\n15\n\nLorraine and France, c.1552–1670 Lorraine sat at the crossroads of Europe – from the Middle Ages it had been open to influences from Germany, Italy, the Low Countries and France, flourishing culturally and artistically through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Its location, at a strategically vital point on the frontier between France and the Holy Roman Empire, heightened its relative importance. The multiple influences and pressures upon it had made the territory extremely complex in terms of overlapping frontiers: feudal, administrative, judicial, financial and religious – as one historian has said, Lorraine was ‘not one, but multiple’.23 Within what was termed ‘Lorraine’ were: the duchy of Lorraine proper (which had been a legally independent ‘protectorate’ of the Empire since 1542); the duchy of Bar, half of which (the Barrois mouvant) fell under the jurisdiction of the Parlement of Paris, while the other half (the Barrois non-mouvant) was under the full sovereignty of the dukes; and various small territories in the Holy Roman Empire. Further complicating the picture was the status of the Trois Evêchés – the towns of Metz, Toul and Verdun, which had been conquered by the French in 1552 and which were officially received into French sovereignty at the Treaty of Münster in 1648. These three bishoprics and their hinterlands came to be organised into a French généralité with its own intendant and governor, and the presence of these French exclaves meant that the Lorraine region was officially shared between two sovereignties, a fact which would prove to be of great diplomatic and strategic consequence, as these sovereignties were bound, by their orientation and interests, to compete against each other (see Map 2). The complexity and incertitudes of the political geography of the region did not predispose Lorraine to a centralised regime. Furthermore, the feudal nobility, naturally associated with public affairs thanks to the practice of holding yearly meetings of the Estates General, still wielded significant influence in the running of the state into the seventeenth century. The Lorrain nobility traditionally administered much of the justice in the state through the feudal Cour des assises, over which the duke had very little control.24 Though the sixteenth century had seen conflict between the duke – who wished to exert greater control over the state and its institutions – and the ancienne chevalerie (akin to the French ‘sword’ nobility), the continued existence of the tribunal of the assises attests to the place the nobility conserved for themselves in Lorrain society.25 In the Barrois, however, neither the chevalerie nor the assises existed, and government institutions were in general closer to the French model.26 Families of the ancienne chevalerie were also an important link between Lorraine and France. Among them were the Choiseul, Apremont and Nettancourt families, all originally from Champagne, the Ludres from Burgundy and the Beauvau family, who came from Anjou in the fifteenth century.27 The\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 15\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n16\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nHaraucourts, Lenoncourts and other high nobility married into French grandee families, creating dynastic alliances.28 Many of these families had long traditions of French military service and several – the Stainville-Couvonges, Lenoncourts and Nettancourts – fought on the French side in the Thirty Years War.29 The Barrois elites were particularly close to France. Many married into French society and became francisised in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, a trend that continued despite – or because of – the ensuing French ­occupations.30 Economically, too, the Barrois was orientated towards the neighbouring French province of the Champagne, partly because its rivers flowed into the Marne and Meuse, whereas Lorraine looked east and was traditionally geared more to Rhenish trade networks than to France.31 Yet the French occupation of Metz, Toul and Verdun from 1552 contributed to the economic stagnation of both duchies. After its sixteenth-century peak, Lorraine’s economy declined significantly and commerce was severely hampered by an under-developed industrial sector. While the Trois Evêchés enjoyed significant trade and were home to a fairly cosmopolitan bourgeoisie, including many Protestants and Jews,32 society in ducal Lorraine remained overwhelmingly Catholic and rural, its towns few and small, its scattered bourgeoisie scarcely constituting a political or social force. Lorraine’s overlapping jurisdictions deprived it of strength and unity, and made it vulnerable. Moreover, due to its location it was caught, from the sixteenth century onwards, in a precarious position between France and the Holy Roman Empire. French rulers pursued a policy of dynastic alliances with Lorraine through the second half of the sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries, as a means of maintaining and extending their influence there.33 Henri II’s occupation of the Trois Evêchés in 1552 gave France a firm military foothold in the region, curtailing Lorraine’s ability to pursue an independent foreign policy. This became increasingly apparent in the ThirtyYears War.34 In the mid-1620s a succession crisis in the duchy raised tensions between France and Lorraine, intensified in 1629 when Gaston d’Orléans went into open opposition to Richelieu and took refuge in Nancy. Given the increasingly volatile situation in Europe, the hostility of Duke Charles IV towards France presented Cardinal Richelieu with the alarming prospect of a potential imperial place d’armes in Lorraine. Attempts at forcing protectorate status on Lorraine proved fruitless after the duke repeatedly showed himself to be unreliable and unable to adhere to French terms.35 An irritated Cardinal Richelieu decided to solve the problem of Lorraine with a pre-emptive strike. Louis XIII occupied Bar in August 1633, meeting very little opposition; after a brief siege, Nancy fell in mid-September.The whole of Lorraine, including its fortresses, was in French hands by the middle of 1634.36 As David Parrott has argued, Lorraine’s importance for France originated in Richelieu’s strategic, fiscal and logistic requirements. The aim was to spare France as much as possible\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 16\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nlorraine, savoy and the frontiers of france\n\n17\n\nthe burdens of war, while increasing costs for the Spanish and the Imperials, and the key to this policy was to seize large swathes of enemy territory.37 These provinces could then serve as places d’armes: military zones in which occupying French armies could systematically plunder all resources they required from the local population, while also denying them to the enemy. Several months before the conquest of the duchies, the French had created the Parlement of Metz. This new institution, which started work in August 1633, marked a major development of the French Government’s influence and control in the region.38 After the suppression of a short-lived Conseil souverain in Nancy in 1637, the Parlement became the linchpin of French administration in Lorraine.39 Also in 1637, central authority was bolstered with the creation of an intendant residing in Metz.40 Yet the occupation rested very much on native services: the Chambres des comptes of Nancy and Bar were maintained, along with the bailliages and prévôtés (local courts). This reflected Richelieu’s intention to encourage collaboration with the Lorrain elites, and set the tone for French policy towards them for the rest of the occupation.41 Cardinal Mazarin maintained the same system of administration in Lorraine as established by Richelieu: governors and intendants were supe­rimposed on an indigenous local administration, collecting established taxes and making troops live off the province.42 Despite initial French military success, Croats de bois ravaged the country and these raiding parties tied down many French soldiers. Writing several decades later, the marquis de Beauvau claimed that these Lorrain brigands did far more harm to their compatriots than the French troops did, reducing the peasantry to a ‘deplorable misery’ and bringing famine: ‘one even saw many women reduced to the necessity of eating their own children so as not to starve’.43 A new governor, the comte de La Ferté-Senneterre, appointed in 1643, served for eighteen years. Though rapacious and avaricious, he re-imposed order on the duchies and put an end to much of the activity of the raiding parties, pointing to a shift in style from Richelieu’s era.44 The problem of Lorraine was not resolved at the Peace of Westphalia. Cardinal Mazarin wavered, uncertain whether to annex the duchies or return them demilitarised to the duke.45 The French therefore engineered the exclusion of the Lorrain envoys from the peace negotiations, and, as Charles IV was closer to the Spanish than to the emperor, the imperial negotiators would not make the return of Lorraine a precondition of peace. Furthermore, the duke had to watch from the sidelines as the emperor handed sovereignty of Metz, Toul and Verdun to the French monarchy. As the war between France and Spain continued, no solution could be found, and Lorraine’s fate was now more closely than ever tied up with the conflict. For the time being, the duke could do little other than go on supporting the Spanish side, and Lorraine remained under French rule.\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 17\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n18\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nThe assimilation of Lorraine into the French monarchy continued, but it remained fragile and superficial.46 The French simply lacked the time and resources required to fully impose their political or juridical authority on the duchies. Though in theory they had superimposed a new top layer of administration while co-opting the rest of the duchies’ traditional apparatus, this strategy was in practice frustrated by a laxity of control from Paris. Conditions were favourable to clandestine maintenance of the ducal-aligned administration, alongside that imposed by the French.Wherever French garrisons were not close, Lorrain tribunals loyal to the duke continued to function and exercise justice in Charles IV’s name, and still commanded much respect from the population.47 Furthermore the Cour souveraine of Lorraine continued to sit in exile in Luxembourg, ‘the soul of resistance to the French presence in Lorraine’, judging cases and reciprocally annulling the decrees of the Parlement of Metz. It also raised contributions for Charles IV, showing the ineffective control exercised over the duchies by the French.48 The example of Lorraine shows that French strategies of administering conquered provinces under the cardinal ministers were deeply problematic. It would be for Louis XIV and his ministers to study the mistakes of their predecessors and ensure they were not repeated. Despite a brief, partial reconquest of Lorraine during the Frondes, Charles IV remained exiled and, for the second half of the 1650s, imprisoned by the Spanish. During his captivity, the Lorrain regiments under the duke’s brother Nicolas-François passed into French service, playing an important role at the siege of Montmédy in 1657, and at the Battle of the Dunes the following year. As a result, fewer troops were quartered in Lorraine and the French authorities started a process of pacification and economic reconstruction.49 In 1659 Charles IV was not permitted to send emissaries to the peace negotiations between France and Spain. By the terms of the Peace of the Pyrenees that year, Lorraine would be returned to its duke defortified, and the Barrois was to be annexed by France. Along with these humiliations, the French were to have military rights of access through Lorraine, and the duke was to be obliged to quarter and provision French troops when necessary.50 Outraged by the Spanish sell-out of his interests, Charles refused to accept these terms and upon his release went to Paris to put his case to Mazarin directly. He succeeded in getting Louis XIV and Mazarin to re-open negotiations for the future of Lorraine, and discussions continued through 1660. Finally, on 28 February 1661, the dying Cardinal Mazarin solved the ‘Lorraine problem’ by concluding the Treaty of Vincennes, the terms of which differed considerably from those of the Peace of the Pyrenees. Most notably, Charles IV was to receive back the duchy of Bar, while the French gained certain villages in Lorraine which created a ‘French corridor’, allowing their troops to pass from France into Germany without hindrance. Lorraine had regained its independence, but had lost much of its territorial integrity,\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 18\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nlorraine, savoy and the frontiers of france\n\n19\n\nthough this had been somewhat curtailed even before 1633. Henceforth the duchy of Lorraine would be indefensible; at any moment French soldiers could intervene.51 Through the conflict, Lorraine had been ravaged by enemy troops, plague and brigandage.52 As a consequence of nearly thirty years of occupation and hostilities, it suffered a demographic and economic catastrophe, perhaps losing as much as two thirds of its population.53 It is a striking feature of this occupation that the miseries it brought affirmed ‘le patriotisme lorrain’.54 Popular sentiment towards France was envenomed further by the confiscations of property of those who remained loyal to Charles IV. Mazarin’s policy at Vincennes of preparing the way for a future annexation had failed. Indeed, the prospect now seemed more distant than ever; as Braun put it, ‘thirty years of occupation, far from consummating the voluntary union of peoples which language, values and history had for a long time brought together, actually sowed in Lorraine the feelings of defiance, hostility and rancour … which did not disappear until the Revolutionary era’.55 Though the Lorrains had ceased to look to Spain to protect their interests after Westphalia, they were in no mood to throw in their lot with the French. Charles IV’s restoration, 1661–70 As the French regime was dismantled, a power struggle developed between the restored duke and the old elites of the duchy. No sooner had Charles signed the Treaty of Vincennes than he was forced to deal with the ancienne chevalerie of Lorraine which had, without his permission, met in Liverdun to discuss how to recover their old rights and privileges, lost during the war. He had the newly reconstituted Cour souveraine – established to abase the powers of the assises – issue an arrêt banishing the baron de Saffre – one of the principal leaders of the Liverdun assembly – and his family, giving them eight days to leave his states.56 Charles dealt harshly with members of the old elites who resisted his assaults on their privileges: exile and property confiscations were not uncommon.57 The duke also created new senior officers whose competence covered both duchies, in an attempt to reinforce the links between them. But he further alienated the old nobility from 1663 by appointing lower nobles and recently ennobled bourgeois to new judicial offices.58 They were also upset by Charles IV’s refusal to call the Estates General. The abolition of the tribunal of the assises deprived Lorrain noblemen of the possibility of supporting the interests of their corps, and Charles IV also divided them with the distribution of favours, appointing a new generation of nobles to state offices (a generation which had never known local liberties in their full existence).59\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 19\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n20\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nIn February 1662 Louis XIV and Charles IV signed the Treaty of Mont­­ martre, which was intended to unite Lorraine and France by peaceful means. By its terms, Charles IV ceded his sovereign rights to the duchies of Lorraine and Bar, allowing France to annex the duchies on his death. In return he and his entire family would be aggregated to the royal family of France and placed in line to the French throne. The king was eager for gloire at this stage of his personal reign, and was more than willing to aggrandise the Lorraine-Guise family, for whom he had great respect, in exchange for strengthening the unstable northeastern frontier.60 French propaganda immediately presented the impending acquisition of Lorraine as the ‘reunion’ of an ancient French province. As the author of one such tract wrote to Louis, ‘You have not acquired Lorraine, you have only recovered it’, and he extolled the virtues of the king for beginning to give back to the French monarchy its ancient territorial limits.61 However, the treaty met with strong resistance in many quarters, including the Parlement of Paris, the Cour souveraine of Lorraine, the Imperial Diet, the French princes du sang, the duke’s heirs Nicolas-François and his son Prince Charles, and the whole of Lorrain society.62 Within a year the treaty had been completely abandoned as a dead letter due to the strength of opposition. The duke sent emissaries to the Imperial Diet to request the formal annulment of the treaty, but neither the emperor nor the German princes wished to upset Louis XIV, so the treaty was left in juridical limbo – something the French would later try to capitalise on.63 Strife would only increase. In 1663, citing one of the clauses of the Treaty of Montmartre, Louis XIV invested the fortress of Marsal. The duke had little choice but to agree to hand over the fortress. With Marsal occupied, future occupations would be just a case of a simple march forward. Further antagonism grew out of the uneasy relationship between Charles IV and the intendant of the Trois Evêchés, Jean-Paul de Choisy. On many occasions, Charles IV complained of Choisy’s lack of deference towards him, and relations between the two men became increasingly uncomfortable; Charles IV dubbed Choisy ‘the artillery’, and the French war minister Louvois was prompted to rebuke the intendant for his lack of respect.64 Essentially this antagonism was the manifestation of a more fundamental anxiety for both France and Lorraine: that of assuring their respective sovereignty and security. The decade saw repeated clashes over territorial control of certain towns, over rival claims to the appointments of benefices, and over Charles IV’s attempts to circumvent French ecclesiastical domination over his states by the creation of a new bishopric. More significantly still, Choisy was given orders to actively research all the titles and deeds which could prove the rights of the king in Lorraine, research which would ultimately prove the basis for the ‘reunions’ of the 1680s. If French intentions were driven by long-term interests such as this, the duke’s methods were driven by ill-will towards France. The later 1660s saw a\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 20\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nlorraine, savoy and the frontiers of france\n\n21\n\nmarked anti-French stance in Charles IV’s foreign policy. During the War of Devolution (1667–8), Charles negotiated a treaty of neutrality that served to allow Spanish soldiers from Luxembourg to use the duchies of Lorraine as a base from which to pillage the Trois Evêchés.65 Irritated by this, Louis XIV demanded the help of Lorrain troops for the Flanders campaign. Charles was understandably hesitant about military collaboration with France, obliging Louis to send his envoy d’Aubeville to Nancy to apply more pressure on the duke.66 In the end, the duke reluctantly agreed, but managed to frustrate Louis’s plans by sending only a part of the contingent he had promised, composed of inexperienced and badly armed recruits. From 1667, Charles also sought an alliance with England, Sweden and Holland to counter-balance the over-powerful position of France. His patience quickly dwindling, Louis XIV in January 1669 ordered Charles IV to disarm, threatening to invade his states if he did not comply. Confronted by an army of 15,000 French troops on his doorstep at Metz, the duke backed down and disarmed.67 But his intrigues continued, first negotiating a defensive alliance with the archbishop of Cologne and several German counts, and then attempting to obtain an alliance with the emperor and Spain.68 The closer relations between Lorraine and the Dutch Republic, facilitated by Prince Charles of Lorraine’s candidacy for the throne of Poland in 1669, was a further cause of worry for Louis XIV.69 Faced with this, Louis XIV charged his secretary of state for foreign affairs, Hugues de Lionne, with devising a plan to depose the duke. Choisy’s advice to Lionne was annexation of the duchies, but Lionne’s own project envisaged replacing Charles IV with his brother Nicolas-François, and fixing the succession on the descendants of Prince Charles.70 The dire state to which Franco-Lorrain relations had sunk by the end of 1669 was compounded in 1670 by a string of provocations on the part of Charles IV. Ducal agents raised customs on commerce between Charles’ lands and the Trois Evêchés, paralysing commerce and leading to a retaliatory French trade embargo. The duke’s position was now desperate, and he appears to have counted on the success of negotiations with the emperor and Holland to save him. Matters came to a head in April 1670 when rumours reached Paris that Lorraine had joined the Triple Alliance of England, Holland and Sweden, while popular unrest broke out in Metz as people suffered under the new customs barriers. As the situation in the Evêchés became more and more untenable, the position of the French Government finally shifted, and military occupation was decided upon, in either late July or August.71 With war against the Dutch Republic looming, it was impossible to leave a ruler as untrustworthy as Charles IV in possession of this strategically vital point for the security of both the frontier with Germany and the French lines of advance down the Meuse and Rhine. For this reason the occupation of Lorraine was a necessity for Louis XIV. Yet it had never been an inevitable course of action. To the king and his minis-\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 21\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n22\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nters, the actions of the duke amounted to a succession of needless provocations. Louis XIV, in his frustration, ultimately had little option but to impose a military solution. Of Charles IV, Louis would probably have shared Saint-Simon’s view that the duke’s life was ‘a tissue of perfidies’ and that through his sheer deceitfulness he had squandered the opportunity for peaceful co-existence between Lorraine and France.72 But the French king was equally to blame for the breakdown in relations during the 1660s, through his arrogant and overbearing behaviour. Thus, despite Louis’s attempts during Charles IV’s restoration to bring Lorraine into France’s political orbit, the House of Lorraine grew ever closer to the Habsburgs, and the kingdom’s north-eastern frontier remained weak and exposed. Moreover, for the population of Lorraine, thirty years of occupation had reinforced feelings of defiance and hostility towards France, which would remain strong and unyielding for the remainder of Louis XIV’s reign.73 Savoy and France, c.1559–1690 Far to the south things were no easier. In the late seventeenth century the House of Savoy ruled over the principality of Piedmont, the county of Nice, the principality of Oneglia, the duchy of Aosta and the duchy of Savoy, which comprised the provinces of Savoy proper, the Genevois, Faucigny, the Chablais, the Tarentaise and the Maurienne (see Map 4). The dynastic union grouping together these culturally and politically disparate territories straddled not only the Alps, but also the internal juridical boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire.74 By its vital geostrategic position the Sabaudian state inevitably found itself uncomfortably squeezed between France and the possessions of the House of Austria, and its dukes spent the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries alternating between support of one or the other. A long period of French occupation of Savoy and Piedmont (1536–59) was concluded by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, whereby France and Spain recognised that the existence of an independent Sabaudian state, guardian of the passages of the Alps, was necessary to maintain the European equilibrium.75 From that point, the French monarchy hoped – as it did in Lorraine – to bind the interests of the dukes of Savoy closer to their own through a series of dynastic alliances, beginning with the marriage of Emmanuel Philibert to Marguerite de Valois, the sister of Henri II. Despite these marriages, the dukes continued to pursue an opportunistic foreign policy, attempting to capitalise on French weaknesses whenever they could, resulting in two further, brief, French occupations of Savoy by Henri IV in 1600–01 and Louis XIII in 1630–31. But, following the death of Charles Emmanuel in 1630 and the signature of the Treaty of Cherasco, the Sabaudian\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 22\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nlorraine, savoy and the frontiers of france\n\n23\n\nstate was placed decisively in the political orbit of France. The French notably gained the fortress of Pinerolo, twenty miles west of Turin, giving them a bridgehead into Italy and a powerful military presence near the ducal capital. First Cardinal Richelieu, and then Cardinal Mazarin and Louis XIV profited from the regencies and periods of influence of the dowager duchesses Marie Christine (1637–48) and Marie Jeanne Baptiste (1675–80) to transform Piedmont-Savoy into a satellite of the French crown. Both women were naturally pro-French in inclination, the former being Louis XIII’s sister, and the latter belonging to the House of Savoy-Nemours, princes étrangers who had been resident in France since the sixteenth century. Through the marriage of Victor Amadeus II to Anne Marie d’Orléans in 1684, Louis XIV believed he could consolidate French tutelage of the Sabaudian state through the traditional method of dynastic alliance. In the context of the twists and turns in Franco-Sabaudian relations, the position of the duchy of Savoy to the west of the Alps made it a perpetual hostage to fortune. In light of this, Duke Emmanuel Philibert abandoned Chambéry and moved his capital to the more secure setting of Turin in 1563. This decision would be of great consequence, as the divide between Piedmont and the duchy of Savoy became increasingly pronounced thereafter. Despite the dynastic union tying them together, the two territories had little in common: while Piedmont was Italian in both language and culture, the essentially francophone duchy of Savoy was influenced more and more by France – particularly after the occupation of 1536–59.76 The French had used this occupation to impose institutions after their own governmental model, notably the introduction of a French-style Parlement in Chambéry.77 In 1560, Emmanuel Philibert reconstituted this court as the Sénat, which thereafter followed French usages, adapted to local customs. The Chambre des comptes of Chambéry, which supervised fiscal, monetary and economic policy in the duchy, was also raised to the status of a sovereign company in 1560. In both courts, the majority of magistrates had trained at the university of Valence in France, and the libraries of Savoyard magistrates were comparable with those of their provincial French colleagues.78 Though Savoy retained a mixture of French and Italian cultures, French was increasingly dominant: by the seventeenth century, the French language was used exclusively, even in official correspondence with Turin.79 French influence also permeated deep into the ecclesiastical sphere in Savoy. The duke nominated the archbishops of the Tarentaise and their suffragans at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne and Geneva/Annecy, but Chambéry and the province of Savoy proper belonged to the diocese of Grenoble, whose bishops were appointees of the French crown. Moreover, the absence of any seminaries in the duchy until the end of the seventeenth century meant that almost all ecclesiastics in Savoy, with the exception of Jesuits, were recruited from Lyon or the papal territory of Avignon, although the duke insisted that the superiors\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 23\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n24\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nof Savoyard religious houses be native subjects of his.80 Savoy was therefore exposed to the same religious currents that circulated in southern France, though substantial differences remained. In particular, despite the duchy’s position between Geneva, Lyon and the Valdesi valleys, Protestantism had failed to make inroads into Savoy, and since François de Sales reconverted the Chablais in the late 1590s, it had been entirely Catholic. Indeed it became, like Lorraine, a bastion of ‘Counter-Reformation’ Catholicism.81 Savoy was orientated to the French economy too, using the French unit of account (the livre tournois), while Piedmont had adopted the lire (similarly of 20 sols) in 1632.82 Though placed at a crossroads of international transit, Savoy was economically under-developed due to its lack of industry and produce.83 The principal source of wealth in Savoy was land, and the duchy’s economy relied heavily on the movement of people and goods. Its meagre commerce was based on cheese and seasonal fairs of livestock and horses, meaning that many Savoyard peasants were forced to work part of each year in neighbouring Piedmont or the Dauphiné in order to make enough money to subsist. Though the duchy had been spared from invasion and occupation for most of the seventeenth century, its inhabitants were forced to pay to lodge French troops during periods of international conflict, and their tax burden could be very heavy. This was aggravated by economic and demographic crises, and the last two decades of the seventeenth century in particular saw prolonged periods of climatic catastrophes.84 The condition of the peasantry of Savoy appears to have deteriorated significantly during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and depopulation, abandonment of land and community indebtedness became chronic.85 In terms of finance, the duchy supplied only a small part of the duke’s revenues: in 1689, 5.9 million lire, or 75 per cent, came from Piedmont, while Savoy brought in only 1.7 million.86 Over the course of the seventeenth century, Savoy’s elites felt increasingly adrift from the ducal court at Turin. Only a small number of senior noble families had a presence there, such as that of the marquis de Sales, who functioned as the leader and representative of the nobility of the duchy of Savoy.87 Moreover, since the Estates General of Savoy ceased to be called at the end of the sixteenth century, the nobility’s collective political role in the state had diminished.88 Links between the nobility and the sovereign were henceforth of a more personal nature – notably in the strong tradition of military service in Savoy, though opportunities for service were rare and many therefore served foreign princes, of whom Louis XIV proved by far the most accommodating.89 The divide between Savoy and Piedmont was exacerbated during the personal rule of Victor Amadeus II, as Savoy became increasingly sidelined in the Sabaudian state. Since the time of Emmanuel Philibert, no native Savoyards had worked as local officials east of the Alps, but increasingly in the 1680s Victor\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 24\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nlorraine, savoy and the frontiers of france\n\n25\n\nAmadeus employed Piedmontese as his representatives in Savoy.90 Even where local Savoyards were appointed in Chambéry, it did not enhance autonomy: in 1687 the duke appointed the Savoyard marquis de Bellegarde to the dual role of premier président of the Sénat and military commander of the duchy, and ­Bellegarde proved himself the most loyal henchman in the programme of greater central control at the expense of Savoy’s autonomy.91 As part of this drive, new structures were imposed on the duchy: the first moves were made in 1686, with the installation at Chambéry of the comte de Tarin as intendant général d’artillerie et des bâtiments, with a right of inspection of bridges and roads. By his appointment, the Chambre des comptes at Chambéry was deprived of its traditional role in matters of bridges and roads, as well as fortifications and military provisioning. It subsequently lost its right of inspection of étapes (military staging posts on set routes), as well as the farming of gunpowder and the management of vacant ecclesiastical benefices.92 Quickly, through a combination of pride and self-interest, the Chambre associated itself more and more with the duchy’s nobility, and so the duel with the intendant took on other dimensions: the Chambre became the focus of opposition to ducal policy and the defender of Savoyard particularism.93 Over the decades, the loss of pre-eminence in the Savoyard state hit the duchy hard, and there was a growing sense that its fortunes were in decline due to its neglect in favour of Piedmont.94 By contrast its links with France, cultural, economic and religious, continued to develop. Louis XIV, Victor Amadeus II and the road to war These links did not, though, make for easier relations between the duke and the king, relations which were under severe strain by the mid-1680s. Louis XIV’s foreign ministry did not possess a monopoly on diplomacy with foreign states: the war ministry under the marquis de Louvois was dominant in relations with Piedmont-Savoy from 1675 until 1690.95 Louvois’s character, authoritarian and imperious, was therefore a significant factor in determining France’s relations with the Sabaudian state. As John Lynn explained,‘in the 1680s Louvois’s tendency to favour force over finesse in the international arena encouraged Louis to bully his adversaries in ways that were both unnecessary and unwise’.96 The substantial body of correspondence between Louvois and the French envoy to Turin, and also with senior members of the Sabaudian court, testifies to overbearing French influence in Sabaudian affairs in this period.97 Weak ducal authority allowed this to happen. Victor Amadeus succeeded to the throne at the age of nine in 1675. He assumed power in 1684, ousting his mother, Marie Jeanne Baptiste, but soon\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 25\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n26\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nbecame aware of the extent of French influence in his affairs. France had acquired a vice-like grip on Turin when in 1681 Louis XIV took control of the Gonzaga fortress of Casale in the Montferrato, while continuing to control Pinerolo where the Alps met the Piedmontese plain.98 The permanent spectre of French intervention or interference was a source of much frustration for Victor Amadeus. On a personal level, the duke was pathologically secretive, and his desire for personal autonomy became, as Geoffrey Symcox noted, linked with ‘a fundamental maxim of Savoyard policy: to undo the treaty of Cherasco, end French influence, and regain sovereign independence’.99 But he was driven just as much by closely-related dynastic aims – most significantly, the ­recognition of his house’s royal status, and the expansion of his territorial base. Louis XIV showed himself to be stubbornly opposed to giving the duke and his family the traitement royal, as he saw the interests of the House of Savoy as subordinate to those of the House of France. He also had little faith in Italian rulers, believing that left to their own devices they might permit the r­ esurrection of Imperial power in northern Italy ‘by their own stupidity’.100 What was more, Victor Amadeus had a serious claim to the Spanish succession, and if he were allowed to become stronger he would pose a threat to the claims of Louis’s son, the grand dauphin.101 It was clear that as long as the French were a permanent presence east of the Alps, the duke’s ambitions would be frustrated. From 1687 the duke’s policy became increasingly anti-French, as he searched for a way to assert his aspirations and concerns. The opportunity came in 1688, with the outbreak of war between France and a coalition of the major European powers. Initially, the duke wished to remain neutral in the conflict, but he was not allowed to do so.102 For the French Government, their own strategic needs and dynastic pride were far more important than Victor Amadeus’s rights or even diplomatic niceties. Louis’s intention was that the Sabaudian state would remain politically and militarily dependent on France, and as such should focus on strengthening its fortresses along its border with the Spanish Milanese, leaving the direction of its army to the French generals. When Spain joined the war against France in March 1689, the need to secure the loyalty of Victor Amadeus was more acute than ever. Yet Louis’s blatant insensitivity towards the duke and disregard for Sabaudian interests in the spring of 1690 actually ended up driving Victor Amadeus into the arms of Louis’s enemies.103 In March 1690 the king ordered his general Catinat to march through Piedmont to attack Spanish Lombardy – with or without the permission of Victor Amadeus.104 In May, as word got to Versailles that the duke was planning to sign an alliance with Spain and the emperor, Catinat was ordered to proceed to Turin to deliver an ultimatum: Victor Amadeus was to hand over 2,000 infantrymen, three dragoon regiments, the citadel of Turin and the fortress of Verrua, further down the Po. He was informed that, if he did not, he would\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 26\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\nlorraine, savoy and the frontiers of france\n\n27\n\nbe ‘punished in such a manner that he remembers it for the rest of his life’.105 After temporising to build up his forces and conclude the necessary alliances with the Spanish and imperial envoys, Victor Amadeus formally declared war on France on 4 June.106 And, of all the European states of the Grand Alliance ranged against Louis XIV in the Nine Years War, it was the Sabaudian state, a third-rank power in the 1680s, which caused Louis ‘a hugely disproportionate amount of trouble’,107 despite his occupation of significant portions of the duke’s lands in the years to come. Conclusions The most pragmatic and immediate concern of Louis XIV’s government in terms of frontier policy was to ensure the territorial security of the kingdom. This could be achieved in part by the acquisition of more territory and partly by bringing adjacent smaller states within the French orbit. The latter policy was predicated on the basis that these small states would benefit from French protection at the cost of surrendering their autonomy in matters of foreign policy – and, in some cases, their domestic policy as well. But Louis’s lack of sensitivity to and respect for the interests of their rulers ultimately led to its failure.Throughout his personal rule his tactics towards Lorraine and PiedmontSavoy were characterised by intimidation and arrogance: in the War of Devolution, Louis forced Duke Charles IV of Lorraine to hand over part of his army to fight alongside the French, and parallels can be seen in 1690 and 1703 when he made similar demands on Victor Amadeus II of Savoy. Guy Rowlands has recently suggested that this reflected a deliberate desire to undermine relations between untrustworthy neighbouring princes and their elites – hardly a gesture that would persuade wavering allies to return to the fold.108 By failing to accommodate the interests of these rulers, Louis ­effectively forced them into the arms of his enemies; in so doing, he inadvertently ­destabilised France’s eastern frontiers and created for himself new military commitments. But the strategic threats posed by Lorraine and Piedmont-Savoy were far from equal. Despite the striking similarity between these two small intermediary states, this resemblance should not be exaggerated: their g­ eostrategic situations were very different. The duc de Saint-Simon compared them with characteristic acuity at the turn of the eighteenth century: Piedmont-Savoy was ‘a separate state, independent without constraint, separated by the Alps, and always in a position to be powerfully supported by its neighbours’, whereas Lorraine was ‘an isolated and enclaved country, invaded whenever France wishes, an open country without fortification, without liberty to have any fortification … a country which can only subsist at France’s pleasure.’109\n\nMcCluskey_AbsolMonarchy.indd 27\n\n12/03/2013 16:10\n\n28\n\nthe eastern frontiers of france\n\nThe two states were also extremely different internally. Savoy’s governing institutions had a long history of autonomy and strength going back over a century, while those of Lorraine lacked that level of prestige and authority, having been re-established only in the 1660s. Relations between the rulers and their elites were conditioned by wholly different assumptions and expectations, particularly given the long exile of the duke of Lorraine from the 1630s to 1661. Furthermore, the experiences and attitudes of their inhabitants vis-à-vis France were poles apart: the traumatised population of Lorraine harboured a deep hostility to the French, retaining in its collective memory for decades to come the devastation of Richelieu and Mazarin’s occupation. The importance of these differences, particularly in terms of past experiences with France, will become clearer in Part III of this book, which deals with relations between the occupied populations and the French occupiers. Nonetheless, Lorraine and Savoy bore at least one thing in common: both had the misfortune of bordering France in an era of almost continuous warfare. Their strategic positions made entanglement in Louis XIV’s European conflicts almost inevitable. The involvement of France in these territories over the period of Louis’s personal rule reflects, as we shall see, the successes and failures of French foreign policy, as well as the material needs of its war effort.\n\nNotes\n\n1 The best overviews of the two territories in this period are Cabourdin, Encyclopédie, i: ‘De la Renaissance à la guerre de Trente Ans’; and R.
