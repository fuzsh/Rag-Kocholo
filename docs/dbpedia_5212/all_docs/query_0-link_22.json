Xo attempt has been made to treat the wider topic of French influence in England in its litraniy and social aspects (this has already been dime by competent hands), tfaongh this aide of the question is naturally touched upon occasionally by way of reference or illostration, I gladly take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to Professor L. £.

This enterprising student was John Palsgrave, \" natyf de Londres et gradué de Paris,\" whose work, entitled L'Esdarciseement de la langue francoyse, was published in 1630. It is an enormous quarto of over a thousand pages, full of elaborate, detailed and often obscure rules, written in English in spite of the French title. It was no doubt the solid value and exhaustiveness of Palsgrave's work which won for it the reputation of being the earliest grammar of the French language.^ Tet Palsgrave himself informs us that such was not the case, though he claims to be the first to lay down ' absolute ' rules for the language. The kings of England, he declares, have never ceased to encourage^ \" suche clerkes as were in theyr tymes, to • prove and essay what they by theyr dylygence in this matter myght do.\" \" This like charge,\" he continues, \" have dyvers others had afore my dayes . . . many sondrie clerkes have for their tyme taken theyr penne in bande. . . .

Giles Duwes, tutor in French to Hemy VIII, and other members of the royal family, frequently invokes the authority of the ' olde grammar.' The poet Alexander Barclay, in bis French Grammar of 1521, informs us that \" the said treatyse hath ben attempted of dyvers men before my dayes,\" and that he had \" sene the draughtes of others \" made before his time ; moreover, in times past, the French language \" hath ben so moche set by in England that who hath ben ignorant in the same language hath not ben reputed to be of gentyll blode. In so moche that, as the cronycles of englande recorde, in all the giamer scoles throughout englande small scolars expounded theyr construccyons bothe in Frenche and Englysshe.\" Thus the French grammarians in England in the early sixteenth century were acquainted with, and to some extent indebted to, a series of mediaeval treatises on the French language, — a type of work which, even at the time they wrote, was unknown on the Continent.^ That England, before other countries, took on herself the study erf the French language, was the result of évente which followed the Conquest. From that time French had taken its place by the side of English as a vernacular. It was the language of the upper classes and landed gentry, the cultivated and educated ; English was used by the masses, while all who read and wrote knew Latin, the language of clerks and scholars. For nearly three centuries after the Conquest almost all writings of any literary value produced in England were in French, though the bulk of composition was in Latin ; English never ceased to be written, but was used in minor works for the most part. It is not surprising, therefore, to And that from an early ' The giammu of Jooqaee Sylviiu or Dabois appenisl ia 1931. s ysu- niter Pb1>- grave^B.

There are stiU extant examples of this onstom,' dating from the twelfth oentnry ; for instance, a version of the psalter, in which the French words are placed above tiie Latin without any r^ard to the order of the Frmoh sentence.* Others are found in some of the first vocabularies written for the porpoae of teaching Latin,* which consist of lists of words grouped round subjects said arranged, ae a rule, in sentence form. Two of these works seem to have been particulariy well known, judging from the number of manoBcripts still in existence— those of the English scholars, Alexander Neckam (1167-1217) sjid John de Garlande, both of whom were indebted to France for most of their learning. Neckam, who in 1180 had attained celebrity as a Professor of the University of Paris, was the author of a Latin Vocabulary — De UtensUibua — which was glossed in Anglo-French.* In this he enumerates the various parts of a house and the occupa- tions and isaJlingB of men, and gives scenes from feudal and agricultural life. The Dictionariiu (c. 1220) of John de Giar- lande, a student of Oxford and Paris, and one of the first pro- fessors of Toulouse University, deals roughly with the same topics.\" It is glossed in both French and English — the sign of a filter period — as was also a Latin vocabulary or nominate of the names of plants,' dating from a little later in the same century, though probably existing in earlier manuscripts. At the univerùties a decided preference for French was ' One of tbe ohiei efleots of the ConqiHst in the «hooli it uid to have bren the ■abstitDtiiHiaiNonnuiti» English Bhoobduten (Leach, SthxiU t^f M aiiattud England, 1916, p. 103). * The maioritj of eariy Istin TooabnlariM eitant; howevsr, ue sooompuiied bj Engliih tnusbldong (ep.

The speaking of French waâ encouraged in aome of the colleges at both Oxford and Cambridge, chiefly those belonging to the second set of foundations.* The scholars and fellows of Oriel could use either Latin or French in their familiar conversation and at meals. Similar in- junctions were in force at Exeter and Queen's. Among the Cambridge colleges ^ the statutes of Feterhouae allow French to be used for \" just and reasonable cause \" ; at King's it was permitted on occasion, and at Clare Hall French was countenanced only if foreigners were present as visitors. At Pembroke, founded by a Frenchwoman, Mary de Valence, special favour was shown to Frenchmen in ^e election of Fellows, provided that their total number did not exceed a quarter of the whole body.' The cosmopolitanism of the mediaeval centres of learning encouraged a number of such French students to come to England. In 1259, for instance, Owing to the disturbed state of the University of Paris, Henry III. invited the Paris students to come to England and take up their abode wheresoever they pleased ; * no doubt those who accepted his invitation settled at one or other of the two English universities.

The fact that the fusion between conquerors and conquered was then complete,' and that at the same time French was very popular on the Continent undoubtedly helped to make its position in England stronger. It was then that the Italian Brunetto Latini wrote his Livres dou Trésor (12S5}, in French rather than in his native tongue, because French was \" plus deUtable et plus commune à toutes gens.\" During the same century French came to be used in correspondence on both sides of the Channel.* Little by little it was recognized as the most convenient medium for official uses, and the language most generally known in these sections of society which had to administer justice.* In the second half of the thirte^ith century Robert of Gloucester complained that there was no land \" that holdeth not to its kindly speech save Englonde only,\" admitting at the same time, however, that ignorance of French was a serious dis- advantage. An idea of the extent to which the language was current in England may be gathered from the fact that in 1301 Edward I. caused letters from the Pope to be trans- lated into French so that they might be understood by the whole army,* and in the previous year the author of the Miroir dea Justices wrote in French as being the language \" le plus entendable de la oomuu people,\" French, indeed, appears to have been used among all classes, save the I Quoted, E.

While it was in the unusual position of a vernacular gradually loaing its power as ^oh, there appeared the earliest extant treatise on the language. This, and those that followed It, were to some extent lessons in the vernacular ; yet not entirely, as may be nidged from the fact that they are set forth and explained m Latin, the language of all scholarship. The first work on the French language, dating from not later than the middle of the thirteenth century, is in the form of a short Latin treatise on French conjugations,* in which a comparison of the French with the Latin tenses is instituted.' As it appeared at a time when French was becoming the literary language of the law, and was being used freely in correspondence, it may have been intended mainly for the use of clerks. A treatise of considerably more importance composed towards the end of the century, appears to have had the same purpose. That he did not intend it exclusively for clerks, however, the author showed by adding rules for pronunciation, syntax and even morphology as well as for orthography. Like most of the early grammatical writings on the French language, . this Orthographia Gallica is in Latin. The obscurity of many of its rules, however, called forth commentaries in French which appeared during the fourteenth century, and exceed the size of the original work. The Orthographia was a very popular work, as the number of manuscripts extant and the French commentary prove. The difierent copies vary considerably, and there is a striking increase in the number of rules given ; from being about thirty in the earliest manuscript, they number about a hundred in the latest.* ' Mftiiltoid, CoHlOfd Papcra, Iflll, ii. p, 437.

It is not surprising that these early writers, in spite of much patient observation, should almost always havei.^ failed to grasp fundamental laws, and group a series of oorre- J sponding facts into the form of a general rule. We continually find rules drawn up for a few isolated examples, with no general application. The most striking feature in the treat- ment of ï^nch orthography in this work is the continual reference to X^tin roots, and the clear statement of the principle that, wherever possible, the spelling of French words 1 should be based on that of Latin. i The Orthographia does not by any means limit its observa- tions to spelling ; there are also rules for pronunciation, a subject which in later times naturally held a very important place in French grammars. written for the use of Englishmen, - while orthography became one of the chief concerns of French grammarians. That orthography received so much attention at this early period in this country, is explained by the fact that these manuals were partly intended for \" clerks,\" who would frequently have to write in French. As to the pro- nunciation, we find, amongst others, the familiar rule that when a French word ending in a consonant comes before another word beginning with a consonant, the first consonant is not pronounced. An s occurring after a vowel and before an m, writefl tiie author, in another rule, is not pronounced, as in mandaames, and Î coming after a, e, or o, and followed ; by a consonant is pronounced like u, as in m'aîmi, îoialment, I and the like.

Thus we are told to use me in the accusative case, and moy in all other cases ; that we should form the plural of verbs ending in t in the singular by adding z, as il amet, U list become vous amez, v<ni8 lisez ; that when we ask any one for something, we may say wms pri without je, but that, when we do this, we should write pri with a J/, as pry, and so on. The claim of the Orthographia Gallica to be the first extant work on French orthography, has been disputed by another treatise, also written in Latin, and known as the Tradatas IOrihographiae. More methodicaUy arranged than the Ortho- graphia, this work deals more particularly with pronuncia- tion and orthography.^ It opens with a short introduction announcing that here are the means for the youth of the time to make their way in the world speedily and leain French pronunciation and orthography. Each letter of the alphabet is first treated in tum,^ and then .come a few more general observations. Like the author of the Orthographia, the writer of the Tradatua would have the spelling of French words based on that of Latin whenever possible. He claims Uiat his own , French is \" secundum dulee Gallicum \" and \" secundum usum ; et modum modemoram tam partibus transmarinis quam ■ cismarinis.\" Though he apparently places the French of England and the French of France on the same footing, it is noteworthy that he carefully distinguishes between the two. The TracUUua OrthograpMae bears a striking resemblance to another work of like nature, which is better known — ^the Traciaiua Ortkographiae of Canon M. T. Coyfurelly, doctor in Law of Orieans '■ — and for some time it was thought to be merely a rehandhng of Coyfurelly's treatise which did not ' Edited by Mi» III. K.

But Coyfurelly admits that his work was based on the labours of one ' T. H. Pariaii Studentis,' and there appears, on examination,^ to be no doubt aa to the priority of the anonymous Traciaiua descril>ed above, which, on the contrary, is evidently the treatise rehandled by Coyfurelly, and the work of ' T. H. Student of Paris.' Besides being the original which Coyfurelly recast in hl^ TroiUatus, it also appears that T. H. may reasonably dispute with the author of the Orthographia OaUica, the honour of being the first in the field. Hia work shows no advance on the rules given for pronunciation in the Orthographia, while the orthography is of a decidedly older stamp. Ât about the same time as these two treatises on ortho- graphy, probably a few years earlier, there was composed a work of similar purpose but very different character. It is of particular interest, and shows that, towards the end of the thirteenth century, French was beginning to be treated as a foreign language ; the French is accompanied by a partial English gloss, and the author states that \" touz dis^l troverez-vouB primes le Frauncois et pus le Engleys suaunt.\" . The author, Gautier or Walter de Bibbesworth,^ was an English- man, and appears to have mixed with the best society of the day. He was a friend of the celebrated statesman of the reign of Edward I., Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincobi. The only work by which his name is known to-day, in addition to the treatise in question, is a short piece of Anglo-Norman verse,' written on the occasion of the expedition of Edward I. to the Holy I^nd in 1270, shortly before he came to the throne. We gather from letters of protection granted him in that year that Bibbesworth himself took part in this venture. In this poem he is pictured discussing the Crusade with Lacy, and trying to persuade Ms friend to take part in it.

The large number of manuscripts still n existence* suggest that it was a popular text-book among the children of the higher classes of society. The treatise reproduces, as might be expected, the chief characteristics of the vocabularies for teaching Latin. In addition to giving a collection of words and phrases arranged in the form of a narrative, it also incidentally aims at imparting some slight grammatical information. Its contents are of a very prac- tical character, and deal exclusively with the occurrences and occupations of daily life. Beginning with the new-bom child, it tells in French verses how it is to be nursed and fed. Rime was no doubt introduced to aid the memory, as the pupil would, in all probability, have to learn the whole by heart. The French isaccompanied byapartial interlinear English gloss, giving the equivalent of the more difficult French words. This may, perhaps, be taken as an indication of the ext«nt to which French was regarded as a foreign language.* After describing the life of the child during its earliest infancy, Bibbesworth goes on to teU how it is to be taught French as soon as it can speak, \" that it may be better learned in speach and held up to scorn by none \" : ' OoÎBiAir of Poieni RoUt, 1301-1307, p. 3B. * She died in 1304 ; her father wu one of the leaders on the king's side at the battle of Lewea (1261). * IlieTe are many MSS. in the British Musenm ; others nt Oiford and Cambridge, uid one in the Library of Sir Th.

In acoordance with this programme the parts of the human body, which almost invariably forms the central theme in this type of manual, are enumerated. Special care ia taken to distinguish the genders and cs,aes, to teach the' children ' ' Kaunt deivunt dire moun et ma, soun et sa, h et la, moy et jo . . . ,\" and to explain how the meaning of words of similar sound often depends on their gender : lippe and an hare Vous avet la levers et le levere, a pound a book - Et la livere et le livers. La levere ei enclost les dens ; Le levere en boys se tent dedens ; La livete gart en marehanndye ; Le livere noua aprent clergye. lliroughout Bibbesworth seizes every opportunity to point out distinctions of gender of this kind, regardless, it appears, of the difference between the definite and indefinite articles. When the pupil can describe his body, the tea«her proceeds to give him an account of \" ail that concerns it both inside and out \" (\" kaunt ke il apent dedens et deores \"], that is of its olothii^ ttnd food : Vestat vos drape mea ohers euiaune, Chaucez vos braya, BOulers, e gaung ; Mettet le chaperoun, covrez le chef, etc. —a passage which illuatrates the practical nature of the treatise, Bibbesworth's aim being to teach children to know the properties of the things they see (\" les propretez des choses ke veyunt \"). When the child is clothed, Bibbesworth next feeds him, giving a full account of the meals and the food which is provided, taid, by way of variety, at the end of the dinner, he teaches his pupil the names given to groups of different animals, and of the verbs used to describe their varions cries. (\" Homme parle, cheval hennist,\" etc.).

From the fields he posses to the woods and the river, where he learns to hunt and to fish, sabjeots which naturally lead to the introduction of the French names of the seasons, and of t^e beasts and birds that are supposed to present themselves to his view. During the whole of this long category the verse form is main- tained, and the intention of avoiding a vocabulary pure and simple is manifest. How superior this method was to the more modem lists of words separated from the context is also evident. Besides giving a description of all the objects with which the child comes in contact, and of all the actions he has to perform, as well as examples for the distinctions of genders and of moy andjo — difficulties for which he makes no attempts to draw up rules — ^Bibbesworth claims for his work that it provides gentlemen with adequate instruction for conversa- tional purposes (\" tot le ordre en parler e respoundre ke checun gentyahomme covent saver \"). And as he did not wish to neglect any of the items of daily life, he finally gives a description of the bxulding of a house and various domestic arrangements, ending with a description of an old English feast wil^ its familiar dish, the boar's head : Aa primer fust apporté a boria heaed La teste de un sengler tot anné, |A« «noue ait ban«fM offivrt E au gioyn le colère en banere ; , E pus venejBOun, ou la fourmenté ; AsRez par my la mesoun laÂ<n of gre» iyme De treste du fermeyson.

As time vent on a conscious effort was made to retain the use of the French language in England. Higden, writing at about the middle of the fourteenth century ,i informs us that English wae then neglected for two reasons : \" One is byeause that children than gon to schole leme to speke first Englysshe and then ben compelled constrewe tber lessons in Frenaah \" ; \" Also gentilmene children ben lemed and taught from theyr yougtbe to speke frenaah.'

There were special teachers who, although not enjoying the privil^es of those lecturing in tiie usual academic subjects, were none the less recognised by the University. They had to observe the Statutes, and to promise act to give their lessons at times which would interfere with the ordinary lectures in arts. The French teachers were imder the superintendence of the masters of grammar, and had to pay thirteen shillings a year to the ^testers in Arts to compensate them for any disadvantage they might suffer from any loss of pupils ; if there was only one teacher of French he had to pay the whole amount himself.

In the meantime, more treatises for teaching French appeared ; Bibbesworth's book soon found imitators, and early in the new century an anonymous author, clearly an English- man, made free use of Bibbesworth in a treatise called The Nominate sive Verbaie in OaUida cum expositione ejusdem in Anglicis.^ This anonymous writer,' however, thought it necessary to make the interlinear English gloss much fuller than Bibbesworth had done, which shows that French had become more of a foreign language in the interval between the two works. He also placed the English rendering after the French, instead of above it. The later work differs further from the earlier in the order of the subject headings, as well as by the introduction of a few new topics. Enumerat- ing the parts of the body,* as Bibbesworth had done, the author proceeds to make his most considerable addition to the subjects introduced by Bibbesworth in describing \" la noyse et des faitz que homme naturalment fait \" : Homme parle ot espire : Man «pekylh et vndyth.

From about the middle of the fourteenth century a feeling of discontent mth the prerogative of the French language in England beoomes prominent. The Iobb of the greater part of the French possessions, and the continued state of hostilitieB vitb France during the reign of Edward LEI. brought home forcibly to the English mind the fact that the French were a distinct nation, and French a foreign tongue. This tardy recovery is aufScient proof of the strong resistance which had to be overcome. Chaucer is the greatest representative of the I new movement. \" Let Frenchmen endite their quaint terms I in French,\" he exclaims, \" for it is kindly to their mouths, but let OS show our fantaisies in suche words as we learned from our dames' tongues.\" His contemporary, Gower, was less quick to discern the signs of the times. Of the four volumes of his works, two are in Latin, one in French, and one in English ; but the order in which he uses these lan- guages is instructive — ^first French, then Latin, and lastly English. Some writers made a compromise by employing a mixture of French and English.^ French, however, continued to hold an important place in prose writings until the middle of the fifteenth century ; but such works are of I little literary value. The reign of French as the literary ' language of England, as Chaucer had been quick to discern, was approaching its end. Hie same period is marked by a growing disrespect for Anglo-French as compared with the French of France. The French of England, cut off from the living source, had de- veloped apart, and often with more rapidity than the other French dialects on the Continent. What is more, the language brought by the invaders was not a pure form of the Norman dialect ; men from various parts of France had joined in William's expedition. The invaders, always called ' French ' by their contemporaries, brought in a ' Eomania, ir. p. 3S1. iiiii. p. 22.

Moreover, during Norman and Angevin times, craftsmen and others immigrated to England, each bringing with him the dialectal peculiarities of his own province.^ Thus no r^olar development of Anglo- French was possible, and it can hardly be regarded as an ordinary ditdect, notwithstanding its literary importance.' This disparity in the quality of Anglo-FrenÂ is illustrated in a remarkable way by the literature of the period. Those who had received special educational advantages, or had ^ travelled on the Continent, spoke and wrote French correctly ; others used forms which contrasted pitiably with contmental ,.-• FrMieh. Moreover, the fourteenth century saw the triumph — of the lie de France dialect in France ; the -otlier dialects ceased, as a rule, to be used in literature,^ and this change was not without effect on Anglo - French, which shared their degradation. Chaucer lets us know the poor opinion he had of the French of England ; his Prioress speaks French \" full fayre and fetisly,\" but After the scole of Stiatford atte Boire, For Freoch of Paris wae to her imknowe. William Langland admits that he knew \" no frenche in feith, but of the ferthest ende of Norfolke.\" * As early as the thirteenth century English writers had felt bound to apolc^pze as En^ishmen for their French. Nor were their excuses superfluous in many cases ; William of Wadington, the authoi ,' of the Manuel dee Péchiez, for example, wrote : * De le françois ne del rimer Ne me doit nuls hom blâmer, ; Car en Engleterre fu né \\ Et nurri lenz et ordiné. Such apologies became all the more necessary as time went on. Even Gower, whose French was comparatively pure,* owing no doubt to travel in France in early life, deemed it advisable to explain that he wrote in French for \" tout le monde en general,\" and to ask pardon if he has not \"de François la 1 W. dumiughun.

At about the same time the aaonymoos atithoriof the Testament of Love finds fault with the English for their persistence in writing in bad French, \" of which speech the Frenchmen have aa good a fantasy as we have in hearing of Frenchmesi's English.\" 1 The notoriety of the French of Englishmen reached Frimce. Indeed this was a time when the English were more generally known in France than they were to be for several hundreds of years afterwards — until the eighteenth century. E^lish- men filled positions in their possessions in France, and during the long wars between the two countries in the reign of Edward III. J^ many of the English nobility resided in that country with their families. Montaigne refers to traces of the English in Guyenne, which still remained in the sixteenth century : \" H est une nation,\" he writes in one of his Essays, \" a laquelle ceux de mon quartier ont eu autrefois si privée accointance qu'il reste encore en ma maison aucune trace de leur ancien cousinage.\" * The opinions formed by the French of the English were naturally anything but flattering. We find them expressed in songs of the time.^ But the recrimina- tions were mutual, and the English had already hit upon the epithet which for centuries they appUed to Frenchmen, and most other foreigners indiscriminately : Franche dogue dit un Ângloia. Vous ne faites que boire vin. Si faisons bien dist le François, Hais voua buves le lunnequin. (bière.)* Even in the Soman de Renart we come across traces of familiarity with English ways, and also of the English It is not surprising, then, that Anglo-French was a subject of remart in France, especially when we remember that already in the thirteenth century the provincial accents of the different parts of France herself had been the object of ■ T.

In the Roman de JeJum et Blonde, the jnmng Frenchman's rival, the Duke of Qloncester, is made to appear ridiculous by speaking bad French ; and one of the tricks ph^ed by Benart on Ysengrin, in the Soman de Renart, is to pretend he is an Eànglistiman : ' Ez vOB kenart qui le salue : \" Godehelpe,\" fait il, \" bel Sire ! Kon sBver point ton reaon dire.\" And Ysengrin answers : Et dez Bdut vos, bau dous amis 1 Dont est«s voa T de quel pais T Vou» n'estas mie aée de France, Ne de la no il A fabliau of the fourteenth century * pictures the dilemma of two Englishmen trying to make their French understood in France ; <Hie of them is ill and wotdd have some lamb : His friend sets out to try to get the ' and ' or ' lamb ' ; but no tme understands him, and he becomes the laughing-etock of the villagers. At last some one gives him a ' small donkey ' instead of the desired ' agnel,' and out of this he makes a dish for the invalid who Snds the bones rather large. In the face of a reputation such as this it is no wonder that the English found additional encouragement to abandon the foreign language and cultivate their own tongue.

There were a few public documents issued in English at the end of the century, but the Acts and Records of Parliament continued to be written in French for many years subsequently. English first made its way into the operative parts of the Statutes, and till 1503 the formal parts were still written in French and Latin. Proteste were made to Henry VIII. against the continued use of French, \"as thereby ys testyfied our subjectyon to the Normannys \" ; yet it was not before the eighteenth century that English was exclusively used in the Law Courts, and for many years French, in its corrupt form, remained the literary language of the English law. Till the seventeenth century works on jurisprudence and reports on cases were mainly written in French, Lea Caees de Gray's Inn shows I French in accounts of discussions on difficult legal cases as ; late as 1680.^ Sir John Fortesoue (1394 Î-1476), Lord Chief ' Justice of the King's Bench, in his i>e Lavdibus Legvm Angliae, suggests that this Law French is more correct at bottom than ordinary spoken French, which, he contends, is much \" altered by common use, whereas Law French is more often writ than spoken.\" In later times no such illusions prevailed. Swift thus estimates the value of the three languages of the EngUsh Law : ' Then from the bat harangues the bench, In English vile, and viler Frenoh, And Latin vilest of the three. At about the same time as Swift wrote, the ' frenchified ' Lady, then in fashion, who prided herself on her knowledge of the \"language à la mode \" is described as being able to \" keep the field against a whole army of Lawyers, and that in their own language, French gibberish.\" * And long after French ceased to be used in the I*w many law terms and l^al and official 1 F.

And John ap Rhys, visitor of monasteries in the icdgn of Henry VIII. viote to Cromwell regarding the monastery of Laycock in Wiltshire, that he had observed one thing \" worthy th'adver- tisement ; the ladies have theii Rule, tii'institutee of their Religion and the ceremonies of the same written in the Frenche tongue, which they understand well and are very perfyt in the same, albeit that it varieth from vulgar Frenche that is now used, and is moche like the Fienohe that the common Lawe is written in.\" ^ During this same period English b^an to be used occasion- ally in correspondence ; but here again its progress was slow. Some idea of the extent to which French was utilized for that purpose may be gathered from the fa^ that three extant letters of William de Wykebam, addressed to Englishmen, are all in that tongue. Not till the second and third decades of the fifteenth century were English and French employed in correspondence to an almost equal ext^it, and during the following years, especially in the reign of Henry VI., English gradually became predominant.* French remained in use longer in correspondence of a public and ofiicial nature, but became more and more restricted to foreign diplomacy. Towards the middle of the fourteenth century, at the banning of the long vtaa with France, French lost ground in England in yet another direction. Edward III. is said to have found it necessary to proclaim that eH lords, barons, knight«, burgesses, should see that their childr^i learn French for political and military reasons ; ' and when the enalom. * BatHon, Jf olimnt £ivli»i, p. 342 ; W^rUm, Bitbxy of Snglith Poetry, p. 10 n. * EOix, Oriffirutl LeUer; 3rd Mriea, 1S46, L p. xL * H.A.E.

But syth it is somdde ohaunged. Now (i.e. 1387) they leave all Frensoh in Bcboles, and use all construction in Englisch. Wherin they have advantage on way that they leme the soner ther gramer. And in another disadvantage. Foi nowe they leme no Frenssh no can none, whiche is hurte foF them that shall passe the see,\" and thus children of the grammar schools know \" no more French than knows their lefte heele.\" Thus the custom of translating Latin into French passed out of use early in the second half of tiie fourteenth century. No doubt there had been signs of the approaching change in the preceding period, sua it is of interest here to notice that while Neckham's Latin vocabulary, which dates from the second half of the twelfth century, is glossed in French alone, that of Qarlande, which belongs approximately to the third decade of the ftdlowii^ century, is accompanied by translations in both French and English. In the universities, however, where French had been slower in gaining a foothold, it remained longOT ; in the fifteenth century teachers of French were still allowed to lecture there as they had done previously, hut it is to be noticed that In all the colleges founded after the Black Death (1340), from which the change in the grammar schools is dated, the r^ulations ^iconraging the sprâking of French in Hall are absent. The change appears also to have affected the higher clafises, who did not usually frequent the grammar schools fuid universities, but depended on more private methods of instruction. Trevisa here again adds a correction to the earlier chronicle, and informs us that \" gentylmen haveth now myche lefte for to teach their children Frenach.\" We thus witness the gradual disappearance of the effects of the Norman Conquest in the history of the use of the . French language in England. The Conquest had made ! Norman-French the language of the Court, and to some extent, , of the Church ; it had brought with it a French literature which nearly smothered the national literature and replaced it temporarily ; it had led to the system of translating Latin qnoj il en fuisHnt plna ftTeo et plug ooatamiet ena leun ghsms \" (Frciuut, qooled b; BehniiB, o^. eiL p.

In the later fourteenth century French was no longer the chief language of the Court, and the king spoke English and was addressed in the same tongue. In the Church the employment of French had been restricted and transitory, though, as has been mentioned, it lingered in some of the monasteries until the sixteenth century ; yet Latin never found in it a serious rival in this sphere, and the ecclesiastical department of the law never followed the civil in the adoption of the use of Flench. How French lost ground in the other spheres has already been traced : in all these cases its employment may be regarded as a direct result of the Conquest. This great event had also indirect results. French became the official langut^ of Elngland, and the favourite medium / of correspondence in the thirteenth century, when the fusion between the two races was complete. But it is highly im- probable that French would have spread in these directions if the Conquest had not in the first place made French the vernacular of a considerable portion of Englishmen, and that the most influential . With its use in official documents uid in correspondence, may be classed the alight encouragement French received at Oxford. In all these spheres it remained longer than it had done where its status had been a more direct result of the Conquest. Meanwhile the desire to cultivate and imitate t^e French of France had been growing stronger and stronger; and when, towards the end of the fourteenth century, the older influences were getting feebler, and in some cases bad passed away, the influence of the continental French, especially the French of Paris, now supreme over the other dialects, became more and more marked. And it is this languf^e which henceforth Englishmen strove to learn, gradually relinquishing the corrupt idiom with which for so long their name had been associated. Digitized ty Google CHAPTER II THE FDTBBNTH CBNTtlBT These great changes which took place in the status ol French in England did not, hovever, affect fundamentaUy the popu- larity of the language : they had to do with Anglo-French alone. French, ae distinct ^m this and as a foreign language, received more attention than ever before, especially from the higher classes, and from travellers and merchants. It was the language of poUteneea and refinement in the eyes of Englishmen, not only as a result of the Conquest, but for its inherent qualities ; and so it retained this position when it gave way to English or Latin in other spheres where its predominance had beeat due, either directly or indirectly, to the Conquest. French had enjoyed a social reputation in Engluid before the arrival of the invaders,^ and had already made some prt^jress towards becoming the language which the English loved and culti- vated above all modem foreign tongues, and to which they devoted for a great many years more care than they did to their own. \" Doulz francois,\" writes an Englishman at the end of the fourteenth century in a treatise for teaching the language,^ is the most beautiful and gracious language in the world, after the Latin of the schools,' \" et de tous gens mieulx prisée et amée que nul autre ; quar Dieu le fiât se doulce et amiable principalement a l'oneur et loenge de luy mesmes. Et pour ce il peut bien comparer au parler des angels du ciel, pour la grant doulceur et biaultée d'icel \" — a more eloquent tribute even than the more famous lines of Bmnetto Latini.

All the best text-books of the end of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries endeavour with few exceptions to impart a knowledge of the French of Paris, \" doux françois de Paris \" or \" la droite language de Parie,\" as it waa called, in conti;a£t with the French of Strat- ford-atte-Bowe and oUier parts of En^Uind. Those authors of treatises for teaching French of whose lives we have any details, had stodied French in France, at Paris, Orleans, or some other University town. The fact that many of their productions still contain numbers of words belonging to the Norman and other dialects does not liimiTiiRh the import- ance and significance of their more ambitious aims. These pioneer works on the Fr^ich language, written in England by Englishmen without the guidance of any similar work produced in France, were bound to c<mtain archaisms as well as anghcisms.' Fluency in speaking French was the chief need of the ' clafises of society in which the demand for instruction was greatest.

No doubt moat of the early ' teachers shared the opinions of their auccesaors, that rules and theoretical information were of little avail in teaching the 'sounds of the language, compared with the practice of imitation imd répétition ; nevertheless, many of them attempted to supply some information on t^e subject. When, in the second decade of the fifteentii century, another writer based a new treatise for teaching French on the vocabulary of Bibbeeworth, which had then been current for well over a century, the chief point in which it differed from its original was precisely in the provision of guidance to facilitate pronunciation. This new treatise was styled Femina} because just ob the mother teaches her young child to speak his native tongue, so does this work teach children to speak French naturally.* It covers almost exactly the same ground as the vooabuluy of Bibbesworth, but, as in the case of the earlier imitation of the same work, the Nomituile, the order of arrangement varies, and the whole is permeated with a lively humour which makes it at least equal in interest to the work on which it is based. The French lines are octosyllabic and arranged in distichs, each pair being followed by an English translation, which is given in full, contrary to tlie practice in the earlier works of the same kind. The author endeavours to teach the Fr^ich of France ' as distinguished from that of England, and, although he lavishes provincialisms from the local dialects of France — Norman, Picard, Walloon— in the main Aey are French provincialisms, and many of them may be due to errors on the part of the scribe. To assist pronunciation notes are provided at the bottom of the page, giving pseudo-EInglish equivalents of the sounds of words written otherwise in the text.

In the meanwhile the grammatical study of French wa.s not neglected. There are still extant numerous small treatises ^ dealing with different aspects of French grammar, chiefly the flexions, and belonging to the end of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The conjugation of verbs receives special attention, and there are several manuscripts providing paradigms and lists of the chief parte of speech — often very incorrect, and of more value as showing the interest taken in Frenoh in England than as illustrating any development in the history of the conjugations of French verbs. The usual verbs described in these fragmentary works ^ are amo, habeo, sum, voh, facio, and the French paradigms are generally accompanied by Latin ones, on which they are naturally baaed, and which were intended to help the student to under- stand the French (\" com expositione earundem in Latinis \"}.

Dove, who also wrote eome Regutae de Orthographia Oaliica in Latin,' which show considerable resemblance to those of the earlier Ortho- graphia OaUica. The same is true of some of the rules devoted to orthography in the Liber Donati, which also owes some- thing to the work of 'T. H., Student of Paris,' either in the original form, or, more probably, in the recast, due to Canon Coyfnrelly. In this respect, Coyfurelly continues the efforts of the earher writer to purify English spelling of French — efforts which at this time would meet with more success than was the case earher.^ Another topic touched on in the Regviae of B. Dove is the formation of the plural of noons, and of the feminine of adjectives. The substance of one of these rules may be quoted, aa an example of the failure of these early writers to graap general principles. All nouns ending in ge, like lange, says the grammarian, take s in the plural, as langea ; all nouns ending in urc, as bourc, have z or a in the plural and drop the c, as hours ; all nouns ending in nyn, as amyn, take a in the plural, as chemyna ; all nouna ending in eyn, as peyn, form their plural by adding a, as peyna. Such ia the rule for the formation of the plural of noons, and that for the feminine of adjectives, which follows, is on the same lines. Pronouns also received Bome attention from these early grammarians. The Liber Donati* contains a few remarks cm the personal, demonstrative and possessive pronouns, giving the different forms for the singular and plural and the various cases ; thus it tolls ns that jeo and sometimes moy are used for / (ego) in the nominative case, and in other oases moy or m« in the singular, while nous is used for the plural in all cases, and so forth. We thus see that the verbs, nouns and pronouns received consideration, varying in degree, at the bands of these pioneers in French grammar. Neither were the indeclinable parts of speech neglected ; at the end of the lAber Donati there is a list of some of these as well as of the ordinal and cardinal numbers in both Latin and French, while the Donail gives the numbers only. Some manuscripts contain lists of adverbs, < Brit Mm, Sloans MS. 513, pp. 13S-13g. ' Brit Mna. Blo&ne BIS. 613. fid. 139.

Of these small treatises that which nearest approaches the form of a comprehensive grammar is the Liber DonaH, which includes observations on the orthography and pro- nunciation, on verbs and pronouns, and lists of adverbs, conjunctions, and numerals. But there appeared at the beginning of the fifteenth century, before 1409, a more com- prehensive treatise of some real value — the Donait fnmçoie pur briefment entroduyr les Angloia en hi droit langue du Paris et de pais la d'entour,^ a work which but for it« very many anglicisms might be placed on a level with some of the similar grammars of the sixteenth century.* The origin of this Douait is interesting. A certain Englishman, John Barton, bom and bred in the county of Cheshire, but a student of Paris, and a passionate lover of the French language, engaged some good clerks to compose the Donait, at his own great cost and trouble, for the benefit of the English, who are so eager (\" embrasez \") to learn French.' Judging from the lines with which Barton closes his short but communicative preface, the work woe intended mainly for the use of young people — the \" ohers enfants\" and \"très douces pucellea,\" ' hungering ' to leam French : \" Pur ce, mes chiers enfantz et ti^sdoulcez puselles,\" he writes, \" que avez fam d'apprendre cest Donait scaohez qu'il est divisé en belcoup de chapiters si come il apperera cy avole.\" Barton then retires to make way for his ' clerks,' whose remarks are entirely coflfined to gram- matical teaching and who, like Barton, writ« in French. Most of the early treatises on French grammar which appeared in England are written in Latin. Latin appears ' Cuob. Uoiv. Libr. MS., Et 1, 20 i Oxfoid. AU Souls, US. 182. ■ Brit. Mus. MS.

THE FIFTEENTH CENTUEY 38 to have been the medium through which French was learnt and explained to a large extent, although in the caae of Uie riming vocabularies En^gliah was used for teaching the young children for whom these nomenclatures were chiefly written. But granunar, probably intended to be learnt by older etadenta, was usually studied in Latin, which was, also found to be a help in learning French. Students are told to base French orthography on that of Latin, and there are constant references from French words to their Latin originals. The Donait aoloum douce franceia de Paris is apparently the only work of any importance written in French before that of Barton. English was not uaed for this purpose before the sixteenth century, when it was almost invariably employed, even by Frenchmen. A grammar such as Barton's would, no doubt, be read and translated with the help of a tutor ; and it is highly probable that the children for whom it was intended would have previously acquired some practical knowledge of French from some such elementary treatise as Bibbesworth's vocabnlary. Moreover, French was so generally in use in the higher classes of society, and had been for so long a kind of semi-naticoiat tongue, that it would hardly be approached as an entirely foreign language, as in latw times. In writ ing a French grammar in French, Barton and those who followed the same course merely adopted for the teaching of French a method in common use in the teaching of Latin. The advisability of writing French grammars in French was a question, as we shall see, much discussed in Uie sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as well as in much more recent times. The clerks employed by Barium made free use of the observations on French grammar which hod appeared pre- viously. But their work had an additional value ; the rules are stated with considerable clearness and are usnaUy correct.* The opening chapters deal with the letters and their pronunciation, set forth, like the rest of the grammar, in a series of questions and answers : Quanteï letters est il !

An early bibliographer ^ includes in his list of Lydgate'e works one entitled PraecepUonea Lingvae GaUicae, in one book, of which no further tra^e remains to-day. Lydgate, however, was well acquainted with French ; he made the customary foreign tour, besides visiting Paris again on a later occasion in attendance on noble patrons, and put his knowledge of the language to the test by translating or adapting several works from the French, like most con- temporary writers.* The same eariy authority informs ns that, as soon as Lydgate returned from his travels, he opened ^ \" Cy flodroit il fault pTendr« gaide qa^en pariant fVancoia on He infltt« pu iid« penoone pour une soltre ai oome font les setlei gena, diaantz aioai }ê firta pour jt /wTOy . . . .\" ^ We paaa From the nnmbeis of nonna to th« peima of verbe, tbed to tba genden and kLnda (proper, sppellatire) of nonna and their cases, aii in number on the analogy of Latin, which a aatmally the basis of the terminology of thia work and fJl oâiers for many yeara after ; Chen oome otnervationa on the degrees of compariBon. aft«r de^ with the parla of apeeoh ; the four indeolinablea (adTeriH, prepoaitiona. oon- jimatLona. and interjeoCJona) are merely mentioned.

Probably Lydgate wrote a French grammar tor the use of these young noblemen, who would oertainly have to learn the language ; and, after serving their immediate pmrpose, these rales, we may surmise, were lost and soon foi^tten. In the fifteenth century, inatruetdon in French epistolary style of all degrees continued to be supphed in' collections of model letters ; and at the end of the fourteenth c^itury a new kind of book for teaching French appeared — the Manière de Langage or model conversation book, intended for the use of travellers, merchants, and others desiring a conversational and practical rather than a thorough and grammatical know- ledge of French. Contrary to the custom, prevalent at this later period, of providing English translations, the earliest of these contain no English gloss, but simply the French text without any attempt at even the slight grammatical instruc- tion provided in the vocabularies. Their sole purpose was to give the traveller or wayfarer a supply of phrases and expressions on the customary topics ; grammatical instruction could be sought elsewhere. The earUest of these ^ is the first work for teaching French to which a definite date can be assigned. A sort of dedication at the end is dated from Bury St. Edmunds, \" la veille du Pentecôte, 1396.\" We have not the same definite information as to the author.^ The anghcisms make it clear that he was an Englishman, while the references to Orleans and its university, and the trouble there between the students and the townspeople in 1389, suggest that he was a student of that university, then much frequented by the English and other foreigners, especially law students. He may have been Canon M. T. Coyfurelly, Doctor of Law of Orleaiis,^ and author of the contemporary recasting of T. H.'s treatise on French orthc^raphy. The author tells us he undertook his task at the request of a \" très honore et très gentil sire \" ; that he had learnt French \"es parties la mere,\" and that he wrote according to the knowledge he acquired there, which, he admits, may not be ' Preserred in t, considerable namber of MSS. : Brit.
