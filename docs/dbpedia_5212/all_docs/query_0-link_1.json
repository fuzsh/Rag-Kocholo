        "text": "A \"collÃ¨ge\" education followed by law studies\n\n(This Musing provides supplementary information about the education that Marc-Antoine Charpentier can be presumed to have received. For information his enrollment in the Law Faculty in 1662,\n\nsee my Musing on the law school register signed by Charpentier)\n\nA brief summary of the type of studies that Marc-Antoine Charpentier had completed by the time he was eighteen will not only help us understand his mature years, it will also shed light on why his contemporaries considered him to be savant -- \"savant\" primarily in the compositional art, but also far more learned than the typical musician or composer.\n\nLaw studies, an open-sesame to a career in the Church\n\nAs a background to our understanding of the family politics underlying Marc-Antoine Charpentier's studies in a collÃ¨ge and his embarking on the three years of university studies that would lead to a doctorate in law, we can profit from Joseph Bergin's tableau of the typical education of seventeenth-century French prelates -- and of their subordinates in the Gallican Church.\n\nIndeed, it was during his research for Crown, Church and Episcopate under Louis XIV (New Haven and London, 2004) that Bergin came upon Marc-Antoine Charpentier's inscription in the register of the law faculty. Although his chapter entitled \"College, University and Seminary\" (especially pp. 81-104) talks primarily about bishops and archbishops, Bergin points out that many of his findings apply not only to prelates and their relatives, but to cathedral canons as well. Since one of Marc-Antoine Charpentier's cousin by marriage was Sevin, bishop of Cahors, and since his paternal uncle, Pierre Charpentier, was a canon at the cathedral of Meaux, Bergin's observations can shed light on why Marc-Antoine -- although not a \"younger son\" -- may have been directed toward the law by his parents and/or guardian: \"Younger sons destined for clerical careers were rarely without uncles or older relatives already in the church, whether bishops, canons, or mere curates. Family understandings ... usually placed some responsibility on those clerical shoulders for educating younger members in due course\" (p. 84).\n\nBy the mid-seventeenth century, university studies -- either a doctorate in theology or a doctorate in law -- had become a prerequisite for advancement in the church (p. 81). Bergin's research revealed that, until the mid- to late-1660s, more future churchmen studied law than theology (pp. 93-95); and that the study of canon law far exceeded the study of civil law. \"By choosing canon law for their degree, even those who were steering clear of theology were nevertheless committing themselves to a career in the church\" (p. 96).\n\nWhile there is no evidence to suggest that his uncle in Meaux or his Sevin cousins in Cahors shaped Marc-Antoine Charpentier's education in any way, the fact that he signed up to study with Jean Doujat, a respected scholar in canon law, suggests that, at nineteen, Marc-Antoine (or his guardians) was \"committing himself to a career in the church\" -- or was at least keeping open that possibility. That is to say, once Marc-Antoine had earned his doctorate in law, if he was fortunate enough to be offered a position as \"agent\" for a powerful churchman, he could take the requisite vows and be tonsured. If ecclesiastical fortune did not smile on him, he could still earn a livelihood in a post requiring an ability to \"read\" and \"write' either canonical or civil law.\n\nIn this context, Bergin's observations about the role played by the Society of Jesus in educating churchmen are therefore very thought-provoking. The Jesuits were always on the lookout for talented young men to along; and if the collÃ¨ge where a youth began his studies was weak in the subject in which he excelled, arrangements would be made for him to continue his studies elsewhere: \"Out of fifty-seven bishops for whom information survives, twenty-eight had been to a Jesuit college ...\" (p. 86). \"One of the features of these networks of colleges [principally those run by the Doctrinaires, the Jesuits, the Oratorians] was the possibility that individual students could be singled out, sometimes at an early age, for their ability or future prospects, and then 'forwarded' to better-placed or better-known institutions. ... The active 'sponsorship' of their brightest pupils (in the broadest sense) by the Jesuits, Oratorians and other orders cannot be underestimated\" (p. 87).\n\nThrough their family friend, Marie Talon, the Charpentiers had close ties to the Jesuits. (See my Portraits around Marc-Antoine Charpentier, pp. 95-98.) It is therefore quite likely that at some point in his education the Jesuits either \"singled him out\" or ensured that he would be \"forwarded\" to an institution where his intellectual and musical talents would be nourished.\n\nA \"college education\" in the 1650s and 1660s\n\nFor an overview of what was involved in Charpentier's \"college education\" -- that is, his ten years of study that culminated in his admission to the law faculty at nineteen -- we can scarcely do better than to consult Roland Mousnier's sketch of the course of study and the pedagogy of a Parisian collÃ¨ge and his tableau of the Paris law school, Les Institutions de la France sous la Monarchie absolue ( Paris: PUF, 1974), vol. 1, pp. 552 ff. (Another very useful publication is George Huppert's, Public Schools in Renaissance France, Chicago: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1984, passim.) A summary of the principal points in Mousnier's broadly-brushed tableau follows.\n\nThe duration of the course of study in a typical collÃ¨ge\n\nThe basic course of study lasted eight years. After having studied what was known as \"grammaire,\" the student progressed to sixiÃ¨me, cinquiÃ¨me, quatriÃ¨me, troisiÃ¨me, and finally to the \"humanitÃ©s.\" After that he moved on the final two years of study, known as the \"premiÃ¨re\" or \"rhÃ©torique\"\n\nAt this point, most students left school. In fact, the ones who stayed on for rhÃ©torique were usually those \"qui jugeaient nÃ©cessaire de conquÃ©rir licence et doctorat dans les facultÃ©s.\" These select few took a year of \"philosophie,\" studying \"la logique et la morale.\" During the second year of these supplementary studies, they studied \"physique\" and \"mÃ©taphysique.\" At that point, they were awarded a \"maÃ®tre Ã¨s arts\" and could be admitted to specialized faculties such as theology, law or medicine.\n\nIn other words, to be admitted to the FacultÃ© de Droit, Marc-Antoine Charpentier almost certainly had passed the examinations for a maÃ®trise Ã¨s arts, and this accomplishment had been validated by the University of Paris. He clearly had done this by the summer of 1662, when he was still eighteen or had newly turned nineteen. This means that he had mastered the entire cursus of one of the Parisian collÃ¨ges -- ten years of study. In other words, at the age of eight or nine, he had been enrolled in a collÃ¨ge, perhaps as a boursier, that is, a scholarship student, or perhaps as an externe or non-boarder (the less costly option).\n\nThe subjects studied, the pedagogy employed\n\nThe goal of the first six years was to \"former le cÅur de l'homme, d'exercer et entraÃ®ner son esprit\" by means of \"les humanitÃ©s, les grands auteurs latins et grecs. Il s'agissait de s'en imprÃ©gner, de les imiter, de rivaliser avec eux, de les dÃ©passer et, par de petits changements, de les renouveler. La mÃ©taphore des abeilles qui vont puiser le suc des fleurs en en font leur miel est constante chez les auteurs qui prÃ©conisent cet enseignement.\"\n\nThe pedagogical exercise used for beginners (and for more advanced classes as well) was the \"prÃ©lection.\" Students listened as the teacher gave a \"leÃ§on magistrale\" that would prepare them for studying the text. The teacher himself would read the text aloud, to bring out its meaning; and then he would explain the argument of the selected excerpt within the context of the whole. He would read a phrase in Latin, paraphrase it, and explain difficult passages; he would discuss the style, turn the phrases about, etc.\n\nIn the lowest classes, the attention was on the words themselves. But the focus gradually moved to syntax, and mythological allusions were explained. When the students had advanced to the \"humanities\" classes, style and speech rhythms were discussed. \"Les humanitÃ©s reposaient sur l'explication des poÃ¨tes: beautÃ© des formes, propriÃ©tÃ© et variÃ©tÃ© des termes, Ã©lÃ©gance et originalitÃ© de l'expression, Ã©clat et couleur des images, musique des rythmes, qui dÃ©chaÃ®nent l'Ã©motion, l'enthousiasme, ouvrent l'imagination du cÅur.\"\n\n\"RhÃ©torique\" brought the study of orators and historians, and the students learned elocution, composition, and oratory. They also analyzed the moral aspects of the text.\n\n\"Il semble que les rÃ©gents ne dictaient pas mais qu'il parlaient. Les Ã©lÃ¨ves prenaient des notes. Le texte des auteurs Ã©taient prÃ©sentÃ© en feuilles, nu, sans note, avec de larges interlignes et des pages intercalaires blanches pour noter.\"\n\n\"Apres la prÃ©lection, venait le travail personnel de l'Ã©lÃ¨ve, la revue.\" The student studied both his notes and the texts themselves; he noted which passages were not clear to him, so they could be explained again; and he summarized the master's explanations. He copied down the author's text and learned it by heart before going to bed. Every morning the students would declaim the text with the appropriate gestures (this exercise was called the \"recitatio\"). Then they would re-do the prÃ©lection, with the master interrupting to ask questions about grammar, syntax, meaning, etc. All this had to be done with a clear and accurate pronunciation of Latin (Latin pronounced Ã la franÃ§aise, of course). \"Tout l'enseignement Ã©tait donnÃ© en latin. Les Ã©lÃ¨ves parlaient le latin.\" They likewise wrote their compositions in Latin. In addition, they learned the art of letter-writing, and of writing poems and speeches.\n\nWe can therefore assume that Charpentier knew Latin quite well (and had mastered some Greek), and that he had studied the principal classical authors for about six years.\n\n\"Les Ã©lÃ¨ves tenaient des cahiers de loci communes ou sentences, locutions, comparaisons, images, dÃ©finitions, proverbes, maximes, fables, adages.\" They carefully selected these \"commonplaces\" that would serve them later when they were called to reflect upon one theme or another. \"Cet enseignement avait des vertus. Il permettait l'acquisition de ce qu'il y a de plus beau et de meilleur dans l'humanitÃ©. Il aidait Ã la libÃ©ration de ce qu'il y a de meilleur dans l'homme. Il exerÃ§ait Ã pÃ©nÃ©trer au plus profond du cÅur humain, mÃªme des ses replis le plus secrets. Il apprenait toute une mÃ©thode pour conduire l'esprit: sous les mots, chercher la pensÃ©e et ainsi fuire la psittacisme [\"parroting\" words, without understanding the ideas the words represent]; sous l'idÃ©e, chercher la rÃ©alitÃ© et ainsi Ã©carter les formules creuses; sous la rÃ©alitÃ©, chercher les essences et ainsi Ã©viter l'empirisme, ses limites et sa dispersion; poursuivre les rapports multiples entre les objets et les idÃ©es, trouver sous ces rapports un monde qui paraissait s'harmoniser et s'unifier Ã partir d'un centre unique, Dieu. Une recherche de Dieu s'opÃ©rait Ã partir des belles formes et Ã travers la beautÃ© spirituelle des grandes Ã¢mes qui ont voulu s'exprimer par ces formes. -- Toute recherche peut Ã©chouer.\" There were, of course, drawbacks to this approach, so teachers tried to overcome them by livening up the more abstract lessons with practical exercises, for example the astrolabe, measuring devices, the compass, maps, etc.\n\nMarc-Antoine Charpentier's use of \"Aliquando bonus Homerus...\" in the Beretta mass is strong evidence that he had compiled a book of commonplaces.\n\nThe Law Faculty and the intellectual formation of statesmen and administrators\n\nMousnier addresses the sort of education that was expected of future lawyers -- a category that, we now know, included Marc-Antoine Charpentier. There were, he says, no special schools to train magistrates or civil servants of all sorts. \"Les hommes [que l'Ãtat] emploie dans ses conseils, ses Cours de justice, ses bureaux reÃ§oivent d'ordinaire la formation commune des collÃ¨ges, complÃ©tÃ©e ensuite par des Ã©tudes de droit. Tout le monde a une teinture de thÃ©ologie, car la religion catholique, apostolique et romaine constitue un fonds commun, qui donne les vues d'ensemble nÃ©cessaires sur l'Univers, la destinÃ©e de l'homme, sa conduite en ce monde.\" Some high magistrates, he continues, hired preceptors so that their sons could be taught at home, but what the boys learned at home differed little from the curriculum of the collÃ¨ge -- be the collÃ¨ge a university school or be it run by a religious order.\n\n\"Les futurs magistrats frÃ©quentaient plus encore les collÃ¨ges des JÃ©suites, en particulier le CollÃ¨ge de Clermont Ã Paris, qui devint CollÃ¨ge Louis-le-Grand en 1682 ..., les collÃ¨ges des Oratoriens, surtout celui de Juilly, les collÃ¨ges des Doctrinaires. En fait, tous enseignent Ã peu prÃ¨s comme les collÃ¨ges de l'UniversitÃ© de Paris, modo parisiensis.\"\n\n\"La plupart des futurs officiers et des grands commis poursuivaient des Ã©tudes de droit, quelques-uns des Ã©tudes de thÃ©ologie. Turgot estimait que seuls les thÃ©ologiens savaient raisonner.\"\n\nLaw studies -- including those at the Paris faculty, until Doujat began shaking up the moribund institution -- were often \"mÃ©diocres.\" Many universities awarded the licence and doctorate in exchange for money. \"Mais les Ã©tudiants trouvaient beaucoup de leÃ§ons donnÃ©es par des docteurs-rÃ©pÃ©titeurs qui Ã©taient des gens de pratique, Ã©vÃªques, maÃ®tres des requÃªtes, conseillers au Parlement, aumÃ´niers de la Cour, avocats au Parlement.\" Ces \"siffleurs\" enseignaient soit chez eux, oÃ¹ il groupaient jusqu'Ã vingt Ã©lÃ¨ves, soit en leÃ§ons particuliÃ¨res. Ã la facultÃ© ou en rÃ©pÃ©titions, c'Ã©tait presque toujours la mÃªme mÃ©thode: une demi-heure de dictÃ©e, une demi-heure d'explication de la dictÃ©e, une demi-heure d'interrogation et de discussion. Des mÃ©thodes imprimÃ©es donnaient des conseils pour le travail personnel: revoir la dictÃ©e et les notes prises au cours des explications, les rÃ©diger, lire les textes citÃ©es, les Ã©tudier; lire ensemble les codes d'oÃ¹ ces textes Ã©taient tirÃ©s et les livres des grands auteurs sur la question; se faire des cahiers d'extraits, mÃ©thodiquement classÃ©s. En somme tout ceci reposait sur un trÃ¨s bon principe: le recours perpÃ©tuel aux sources, leur Ã©tude personnelle et directe pour s'en pÃ©nÃ©trer. L'enseignement Ã©tait complÃ©tÃ© par des discussions, oÃ¹ les antagonistes argumentaient en forme: les disputes.\"\n\n(In short, the pedagogy at the law school was a prolongation of the pedagogy of the collÃ¨ge. Thus a serious nineteen-year-old -- and we assume that Marc-Antoine Charpentier was serious -- would have felt quite a home in his new environment.)\n\nFrench law -- that is, \"droit civil\" -- did not become part of the curriculum until 1679. In Marc-Antoine Charpentier's day studies focused on canon law and Roman law/customary law.\n\nTo become a \"bachelier en droit, il fallait deux ans d'Ã©tude, subir un examen et soutenir une dispute de deux heures; pour devenir licenciÃ©, un an de plus, un examen et une dispute de trois heures; pour le doctorat, un an encore, une explication de texte et une dispute de quatre heures.\"\n\nBut Marc-Antoine Charpentier withdrew from the faculty without having done more than dip his toe into the deep waters of the law."
