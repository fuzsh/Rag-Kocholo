        "text": "Problem solving is a critical component of a comprehensive 21st century education. This study investigates the perceptions of students of taking a university liberal education course designed to develop problem-solving skills. We describe how the participants in the study created their own understanding of what problem solving skills are and why they are important. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data collected before, during and after the course, students reported increased communication skills, increased awareness of the importance of problem-solving skills in their major, and significantly increased confidence in their problem-solving abilities. They also demonstrated a strong awareness of how the skills they acquired transfer to both academic and real-world environments.\n\nThis research aims to analyze studentsâ€™ problem-solving ability in terms of sociomathematical norms. Data was collected using questionnaire sociomathematical norms, ability description tests, and interviews. The total subjects in the research were six students consisting of two students with high sociomathematical norms, two students with moderate sociomathematical norms, and two students with low sociomathematical norms. In this research, there are four indicators, namely understanding the problem, planning the problem, solving the problem, and re-examining the answer. The results showed that subjects who had high sociomathematical norms were able to solve questions on all indicators. Subjects with moderate sociomathematical norms are able to solve problems on the indicators of understanding, planning, and solving problems, but there are errors in the indicators of re-examining. Subjects who have low sociomathematical norms are able to solve problems on the indicators of understand...\n\nA problem is a situation, in which a person tries to find a solution and does not exactly know how but still tries to solve it. One of the important elements of problem solving skills that individuals should have is to choose the appropriate strategy in the solution of the problems, which is important in terms of achieving success in solving problems. The research question of the study is \" what are the levels of sixth and seventh grade students' problem solving skills? \" The aim of this study was to investigate the problem solving and problem-solving strategies levels of secondary school students. The study was carried out through method with a total of 72 students from the two provinces in the Black Sea region of Turkey selected by random in the second term of the 2014-2015 academic year. In this qualitative research for the case study, content analysis was applied. The study group consists of 50 students in Samsun province and 22 students in Sinop province in the Blacksea region, 35 of the students are females, whereas 37 of them are male students. Turkish by the researchers, were used as the data collection tools. The problems applied were evaluated according to Polya's stage of problem solving. The problems were evaluated according to stages such as understanding the problem, choosing a strategy, applying the chosen strategy, and evaluating the solution. While examining students' problem solving papers, it was observed that they were more successful at solving problems, with which they came across before or are similar to the ones they had solved. It was observed that majority of the students had difficulty in solving non-routine problems. It is believed that this results from the fact that mostly routine problems are discussed and solved in the curricula."
