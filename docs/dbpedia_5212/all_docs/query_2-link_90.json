        "text": "The stylistic role of music in The Birth of Tragedy presupposes the relation Nietzsche had uncovered between “music and words” in his theory of meter and rhythm in ancient Greek. This is Nietzsche’s architectonically quantitative, measured and timed, theory of words and music for his courses on rhythm and meter as well as his discussion of tragedy and music in his first book. A recollection of the meaning of the spirit of music also reviews the logical questions of metaphor and truth and invites a parallel with The Gay Science with regard to language and the alchemical art of love, likewise in terms of both music and science. This inquiry entails the purely philosophical questions of knowledge and truth yet the discussion to follow takes its point of departure from classical philology, reviewing what Nietzsche himself held to have been his most scientific “discovery” on the terms of his own discipline. Although we have become accustomed to view Nietzsche as the perfect embodiment of the academic outsider, his discovery concerning Greek prosody is standard in his field (so standard as to be received without fanfare or indeed, although it is not disputed, routine acknowledgment as such).\n\nas early as 1869, in his notes from Basel, Nietzsche had paralleled the musical culture of ancient Greece and the song culture of medieval Europe precisely for the sake of an understanding of Greek lyric poetry and tragedy. Thus Nietzsche declared that “for the Greeks, text and music were so intimately joined that without exception one and the same artist created both of them.” Nietzsche further observed that the marriage of text and music was “in no way a rarity: think of the troubadours, the Minnesänger, and even the guild of Meistersingers” (Fruehe Schriften Vol 5, p. 308; cf. p. 367).\n\nI dive into Nietzsche's first book and try to understand his view on Greek dramatic tragedy and the role of music in the ancient art form. I also contrast his view with a Hegelian view of music. The role of the ancient Chorus is also discussed. I also address the destablizing and positive aspects of Socrates on Nietzsche's philosophy of music. The influence of Schopenhauer is also addressed. I also sketch the history of Ancient Tragedy and how it evolved out of the east and dating back to the time of Homer and other famous Greek poets noted by the author. In my view \"Birth of Tragedy\" is a highly underrated book by Nietzsche.\n\nSince the first appearance of The Hirth ofTragedy Ollt ofthe Spirit of Music, Nietzsche has arguably proved to he amongst the most influential intellectuals upon European artistic practice. Indeed, four musicians with strong Nietzschean traces who immediately come to mind are Richard Strauss (Also Sprach Zarathustra, 1895) and Gustav Mahler (Symphony NO.3 in D Minor, 189511896), Frederick Delius (A Mass of Life, 19°4119°5) and Arnold Schoenberg (Der Wanderer in E~&#39;tht Songs, Opus 6, 19°3119°5). Yet this paper is not concerned with the vicissitudes of Nietzsche&#39;s influence upon musicians over the last four or five generations, let alone with the influence of a Richard Wagner or a Georges Bizet upon him, nor, for that matter, with his own attempts at composition. The Birth ofTragedy, in common with Nietzsche&#39;s other publications, verges upon the potentially intimidating. Even on a cursory reading, it presents its readers with significant problems of how they are to orient ...\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) was not only a philosopher who loved and wrote about music; he was also a musician, pianist, and composer. In this ground-breaking volume, philosophers, historians, musicians, and musicologists come together to explore Nietzsche’s thought and music in all its complexity. Starting from the role that music played in the formation and articulation of Nietzsche’s thought, as well as the influence that contemporary composers had on him, the essays provide an in-depth analysis of the structural and stylistic aspects of his compositions. The volume highlights the significance of music in Nietzsche’s life and looks deeply at his musical experiments which led to a new and radically different style of composition in relation with his philosophical thought. It also traces the influence that Nietzsche had on many other musicians and musical genres, from Russian composers to current rock music and heavy metal."
