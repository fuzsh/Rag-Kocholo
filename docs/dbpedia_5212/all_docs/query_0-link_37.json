Axi com celh que del tot s’abandona. II. Mos cors se mor lenguen, mays morts non es. Lorsque je publiai ici raeme (Romanic Review, XI (1920), pp. 195-222) une etude sur “Un poeme inedit de Peyre Cardinal: Si tots temps vols esser valents e pros,” je dus faire connaitre que l’attribution de cette piece au virulent troubadour du Puy avait ete courtoisement, mais nettement contestee et que M. G. Bertoni la croyait de Peyre Cathala. Cette objection avait ete pour moi d’autant plus troublante et inattendue que je ne connaissais rien de Peyre Cathala. L’ceuvre de ce troubadour venait, en effet, d’etre revelee aux chercheurs, il y avait a peine quelques annees, par M. J. Masso Torrents dans sa belle Bibliografia dels antics poetes Catalans (Barcelone, 1914, p. 65 ) ; mais aucun texte n’avait encore ete publie faisant connaitre l’esprit de cette oeuvre. Je soumis done l’opinion de M. Bertoni a l’examen de M. Masso Torrents lui-meme, et Ton sait ce que me repondit en sub- stance le consciencieux catalaniste et provengaliste : “ Les pieces de Pere Catala ne sont pas dans le genre de celle que le meme ma- nuscrit attribue a Peyre Cardinal” (Rom. Rev., ibid., p. 197). M. Masso ne se contenta point d’exprimer si clairement son opinion. II voulut bien se donner la peine de relever les textes des deux premiers poemes de P. Cathala et de me les envoyer en faisant remarquer que le second contenait des vers elogieux a l’adresse de Guillem Auger, et en exprimant l’espoir que je parviendrais a identifier ce personnage. Je suis heureux de pouvoir faire connaitre a M. Masso en lui Digitized by ^.ooQle 2 The Romanic Review exprimant ma plus vive gratitude, que son souhait s’est realise et qu’une nouvelle page absolument inedite peut ainsi etre inscrite dans l’histoire litteraire des troubadours. I. — Premier Po£me Le premier poeme se trouve dans le manuscrit n°. 7 de la Biblioteca de Catalunya (A de Mila et H* de Masso Torrents). II est signale dans la Bibliografla de Masso sous le n°. 49 et par la notice suivante : “ p. 81, fol. lxij. Apenes visible. Pere Cathala ? “Axi com celh . . . bondar . . “ i r vers de la 2* cobla: “ Si col signes qui no xanta ni crida.” “ 5 cobles de 1 1 versos, 1 tomada de 5.” On voit, par ces renseignements, que le nom du troubadour et les premiers vers sont difficilement lisibles. Cela provient de ce que le poeme commence une page et que le manuscrit a ete fortement deteriore par l’humidite dans la tranche superieure. Le second poeme, qui suit immediatement le premier, a la page 84, a subi le meme sort. Cependant, a la seconde lecture, M. Masso a pu nettement dechiffrer le nom de Pere Cathala. Un nouveau troubadour prend done ainsi definitivement sa place dans les annales de la poesie provengale et l’on verra que l’etude des poemes permettra de ca- racteriser son oeuvre, de la faire vivre a une epoque nettement deter- minee et de lui trouver des emules et un protecteur. M. Masso put aussi reconstruire clairement les premiers vers effaces. Une seconde legon du poeme se trouve, en effet, dans un autre manuscrit, celui que M. Masso designe par la lettre E, et qu’il decrit aux pages 36-39 de sa Bibliografla. Le manuscrit a ete recueilli dans la bibliotheque particuliere de Stanislas Aguilo, a Palma de Majorque. C’est un recueil factice remontant au XIV* siecle, qui comprend des fragments de trois chansonniers et le Compendi d’En Castellnou. La le poeme qui nous occupe figure au f. 48 v°; le texte en est tres lisible, et le premier vers est le suivant : Axi com cell qui del tot s’abandona. Digitized by ^.ooQle Deux Poimes de Peyre Cathala 3 Aussi, M. Masso, grace a cette nouvelle le?on a-t-il pu retrouver nettement le debut qui est efface dans H\\ Mais le manuscrit E attribue la piece a P. Vidal, et cette circon- stance a deja fait publier la leqon de E. M. J. Anglade, professeur de langue et de litterature meridionales a l’Universite de Toulouse, avait, en effet, sur les indications de M. Masso, examine ce texte lors d’un sejour a Barcelone en mai-juin 1916, l’avait transcrit et l’avait insere l’annee suivante dans le bel article de melanges sur les troubadours qu’il fit paraitre dans le Bulletin de la Socitte archi- ologique du Midi de la France (Toulouse, Privat, n°. 45, novembre I9 I 5~ juillct 1917, pp. 195-245). La, le texte, accompagne d’une etude tres soignee et d’une traduction, figure aux pages 218-223. M. Anglade ne s’est pas laisse tromper par l’attribution a P. Vidal. “ La piece, dit-il, n’est pas ecrite dans la maniere de Peire Vidal; il y a ici de la pretention et de la recherche, mais on n’y trouve pas, on n’y sent pas du moins ce je ne sais quoi par ou les chansons du poete toulousain se distinguent de celles des autres troubadours. Nous ne croyons done pas que l’attribution du ma- nuscrit soit exacte.” Cette perspicacite a eu sa recompense. Quand je communiquai le nouveau texte a M. Anglade, celui-ci fut visiblement satisfait et m’ecrivit (1\" aout 1921) : “ Oui, j’ai publie la piece en question que M. Masso voulait attribuer a P. Vidal, mais qui evidemment n’etait pas de sa faqon.” M. Anglade avait regrette, d’ailleurs, que son poete ne fut pas l’auteur de la piece et avait cherche le mobile qui a pu egarer le copiste: “II semble difficile qu’on puisse l’attribuer au troubadour toulousain, et e’est dommage, d’ailleurs, car elle est d’un poete un peu pretentieux et recherche, mais d’un vrai poete. Le copiste qui la lui a attribute devait avoir present a la memoire le debut de la chanson : Amors pres sui de la bera; cf. le vers 8 : ans sui pres de la mort.” Voila done, cette fois, une question d’attribution nettement elucidee ; et il semble que nous pourrions nous dispenser de republier un poeme qui a ete deja si heureusement edite. Mais la nouvelle legon est legerement superieure a celle du manuscrit E, au moins en ce qui conceme la graphie. Elle foumit aussi quelques variantes Digitized by ^.ooQle 4 The Romanic Review interessantes, et permet peut-etre de bien comprendre la tornada qui a un instant embarrasse M. Anglade lui-meme. C’est Tavis de M. A. Jeanroy a qui j’ai soumis le nouveau texte. L’eminent romaniste de la Sorbonne m’ecrit, en effet: “Le texte foumit quel- ques bonnes variantes a celui publie par M. Anglade/ 1 Un rapide .rapprochement des deux textes fournit sans effort ces variantes et nous les signalerons par la methode ordinaire, au bas du texte, en les faisant suivre de la lettre E (=manuscrit de Majorque).

Traduction I De meme que celui qui s’abandonne completement Pour bien vivre et pour rapidement mourir, Et qui entre en un lieu d'ou plus tot il peut sortir 4 Sans grand peril (souci) d'y perdre la vie, De meme je fais moi, qui, pour vivre joyeux Et pur et franc, patient et amoureux, J'aime en tel lieu dont aucun reconfort Digitized by ^.ooQle Deux Po&mes de Peyre Cathala 7 8 Je ne puis avoir ; meme je suis pres de la mort Si done Amour, bienveillance et merci — Et ma Dame, qui est fleur de tous biens — n Ne me veulent donner rapidement salut et vie. II Ainsi que le cygne, qui ne chante ni ne crie Jusqu’a ce qu’il est venu pres de la mort, (Car il est si habile a chanter 15 Que jusqu’a ce qu’il meurt il n’oublie pas son doux chant) Aussi peu j’oublie, moi, les chants et les amours, Ni ma Dame ou sont Merite et Valeur. Puisque, tout ainsi que Talouette d'ete 19 Qui, au temps de ses amours, vit de peu d’aliments, Ainsi je suis, moi, et d'ete et d’hiver, Tellement je me nourris de peu de chose; 22 Et Amour me nourrit avec un fruit qui murit tard. III Comme la calandre, qui est d’une nature telle Qu’elle ne regarde point le malade quand ce malade doit mourir, Avec son regard ma Dame ne veut pas me guerir ; 26 Au contraire, quand je la vois, elle me tue et fait empirer mon mal. Mais j’imite la roue du moulin, Qui, tout en toumant, ne sort pas de sa place. Et je renonce aussi peu a aimer d’amour parfait. 30 Au contraire, je me reconforte, quand je sais que ma Dame est la plus aimable. Aussi fais-je comme fait le bon pecheur Qui patiente jusqu’a ce qu’il tire du poisson de la mer. 33 Ainsi, je me prepare une noble joie avec Tesperance. IV Comme le basilic, qui, voyant son image Pres du miroir, meurt en se regardant lui-meme, Ainsi je meurs moi en contemplant ma Dame 37 Par le desir que j’ai de son amour. Car elle est comme le soleil qui Thiver comme Tete, Enleve la vue (clarte) a ceux qui regardent son rayon. Ainsi ma Dame me Tenleve par son clair regard, 41 Par Teclat de son visage blanc comme fleur de lys, Fine comme Tor, belle et d’une allure elegante Et meme plus, puisque aucune bonne qualite ne lui manque! Digitized by ^.ooQle The Romanic Review 8 \" 44 C’est pour cela que j 'attends son amour jusqu'a ce que merci me vienne en aide. V Comme celui qui a repousse du champ de bataille Plus fort que soi, si bien qu'il arrive a vaincre, Ainsi je fais moi; pourtant je rends mes armes 48 A [la plus] aimable pour qu'il lui faille de moi Avoir merci, comme Dieu l'eut du larron Lorsqu’il lui donna le Paradis quand il eut demande pardon, Ainsi lui demande- je merci comme terrasse et vaincu. 52 Mais Amour parfait qui m'amene l'esperance Veut que je fasse comme font les laboureurs Qui labourent jusqu'a ce qu’ils ont fruit et fleur 55 Aussi je laboure jusqu'a ce que j'obtienne du fruit. VI Mon Gai a une aureole et une couronne qui reluisent D'une beaute pure m'apportant une joie Qui est toute accomplie en merite parfait. Aussi, ai-je du plaisir a peindre ses louanges, 60 Car ce m'est un honneur de retracer sa beaute. Noto. — Je traduis la tomada autrement que M. Anglade, non seulement £ cause des variantes que pr^sentent les textes de E et de H a ; mais parce que la tomada du second poeme montrera que le senhal est forme par l'e mot Gays seul, et qu 'appelhs signifie a pelhs “ a des cheveux, une aureole.” Void comment M. Anglade avait compris: “ Mon bel Appel et Chapel, qui reluit d'une beauts par- faite qui m’apporte la joie, qui est omee de parfaite gaite, j’ai plaisir a dire ses louanges, car ce m’est un honneur de retracer sa beaute.” II est vrai que M. Anglade n’etait point satisfait de sa traduction et qu’il ecrivait en note : \" Cet envoi est bien banal, et, sous la forme actuelle, incorrect : faut-il mettre un point d’exclamation apres CapellsT Peut-etre avons-nous affaire a une interpolation (cf. la repetition de la rime et presque de Tidee aux vers 52 et 57).” Or, nous l’avons remarque aux variantes, dans le texte de if* cette repetition n’existe plus : rime du vers 52, me duts; rime du vers 5 7, m’odutz. Et capelh n’a plus l’s du cas sujet. L’incorrection signal^e disparait done £ son tour. II. — Le Deuxi^me Poeme 1 Ce deuxieme poeme suit immediatement le premier dans le ma- nuscrit H*, et, comme il commence au haut d’ une page (84 v°), il a subi la meme alteration : il est illisible au debut, parce que la page a ete deterioree par 1’humidite. Le nom de Peyres Cathala est presque efface, et, dans sa Bibliografta, M. Y. Masso Torrents 1 Pour le texte constitue et un essai de traduction de ce poeme cf. les pp. 14-17. > Digitized by ^.ooQle Deux Pokmes de Peyre Cathala 9 (p. 65) avait ecrit prudemment a cote: apenes llegible. Le premier vers restait tronque dans cette premiere indication: Mon cors se mor lengen . . . non es C’est a la seconde lecture que M. Masso a dechiffre les mots mays mort. Le second vers n’etait pas plus intelligible, puisque M. Masso a ecrit, meme apres sa nouvelle lecture: C si fos mort mort moren mage estort. Le C du debut est ensuite devenu E; mais on voit que la cor- rection n’est pas suffisante: le copiste a respecte presque constam- ment la regie du cas sujet et de l’attribut. 11 faut done ecrire les deux vers avec l’orthographe suivante : Mo[s] cors se mor leng [u] en, mays mort[s ] non es; [E], si fos mort[s], mort[s ] moren m’ag [r 1 ] estort. M. Masso, pour donner, dans sa Bibliografta, une indication sure, reproduisit done, en outre, le premier vers de la seconde strophe : Tan duramen sa doug’ amor me pres, laissant, a mon avis, encore une faute au mot amor qu’il faut ecrire o»»0r[j] (cas sujet). Enfin, tant le texte est encombre de telles difficultes que M. Masso, rebute un instant dans son travail ingrat, n’ avait pas compte exactement le nombre des vers. II disait dans sa Bibliografta: “6 cobles de 8 versos.” C’est “ 9 versos ” qu’il fallait dire. Heureusement, aux pages 85-95 l e manuscrit a ete, un peu plus qu’auparavant, epargne par l’humidite, si bien que le poeme est lisible meme au debut de la cobla IV (p. 85) et de la tomada (p. 86). 11 resulte de cette breve comparaison, la seule que nous puissions faire, que nous ne saurions pretendre foumir un texte definitif. Et voici les remarques que nous devons soumettre au lecteur avant de transcrire une legon unique qu’il ne nous est pas possible d’etablir d’une maniere satisfaisante. Au vers 6 se trouve le mot fau pour fay ou fas ( 1® pers. sing, du present indie, du verbe faire). II n’y a pas a le modifier; nous Digitized by ^.ooQle 10 The Romanic Review avons trouve dans le premier poeme, contrafaug et contrafau (v. 27), f au (vv. 3 ° 47 )* C’est la forme felibrienne modeme; mais elle date de loin; elle est employee regulierement, meme a la troi- sieme personne, par Auzias March, dans les verbes en -aire comme plaire et sostraire: Ja tots mos cants me plan metr* en oblit . . . Si Deu del cors la mi arma sostrau . . . Au meme vers 6, en rime, se trouve le mot estia. II est corrompu, puisqu’il rime avec camisa du vers 9, et devrait s’ecrire estisa . Mais estisa est un vocable inconnu aux lexiques. Comme il s’agit, dans la phrase, d’un feu (foch) qui consume “ maints purs amants aimes ” ( Mants fis aymants amats ), on peut songer a atisa “ attise,” qui est parfaitement provengal. Mais je crois qu’il faut lire estrisa (= consume, fait deperir, eteint). Ce mot n’est pas non plus sig- nale dans les vocabulaires et Raynouard ne lui a pas consacre de notice dans son Lexique roman . Le meme oubli s' est produit pour destrisa, quoique Raynouard ait trouve Texpression dans le passage suivant d’une tenson entre Guizo de Cabanes et N Esquileta : N Esquileta, quar m’a mestier, M’aven a cercar mant seignor. E, sitot non sai, entre lor, Cridar : \" A foe ! 99 per En Roger, Ben eu conosc que prez destrisa E fina valors abriza. E, ses cridar, sai en cort, conoissen. Ben dir dels pros e mal de Tavol gen. Raynouard, Choix v, 176 “ Seigneur Esquileta, comme j’en ai besoin, — II m'arrive de chercher maint seigneur. — Et, si je ne sais point du tout, parmi eux — Crier : “ Au feu ! \" pour le seigneur Roger, — ^Je discerne bien que le merite s’ eteint — Et que la parfaite valeur disparait. — Or, sans crier (au feu!), je sais, dans une cour, en connaisseur — Dire du bien des preux et du mal des gens avilis.” On voit que le sens de destrisa, qui conceme ici le feu comme dans notre texte, est bien celui qui nous convient, et estrisa est evidem- ment le generateur de destrisa. Raynouard, sans accorder de notice a destrisa, a cependant traduit le mot ( Lexique roman, II, p. 261). Digitized by ^.ooQle Deux Poimes de Peyre Cathala ii Le mot amen, du vers 7, n’est pas une legon claire. Si c’est le subjonctif du verbe atnar, ce qui est possible, il se rapporte a mants fis aymants amats, et il faut comprendre: “Maints amants aimes parfaits [pourvu qu’ils] aiment Amour.” Mais on peut interpreter plus simplement am’ en amor “ j’aime en amour,” qui convient aussi bien et se prete egalement au rapprochement de.mots que cherche le poete. Au vers 10, on le sait, M. Masso avait lu d’abord duramen, qu’il a remplace par dougamen a la seconde lecture. Et dougamen se prete, en effet, a la derivation de mots que le poete recherche. Mais duramen s'accorderait tres bien avec le sens du vers 11, ou il est question d’un “regard (dur) qui epouvante.” La suppression de Ye initial dans Esguard et Espaverdan (v. 1 1 ) n’est pas une negligence, mais une habitude du copiste et meme une regie de la langue catalane au XV\" siecle. Cf. dans le premier poeme: v. 15 sgart E; 33 speranga E; 36, sguardan H\\ sgarda E. Cf. ci-apres, v. 35 stamen; v. 36, smenda. Mais spaverdan est probablement une legon legerement alteree qu’il faut remplacer par tspavordan, un derive de pavor “peur.” Je ne parviens pas a comprendre la construction tant fort mort du vers 12. La rime exige mort sans s. Mais alors mort qualifie cor dont il faut le rapprocher, et la construction n’est plus claire. Le rapprochement de cor et de mort ferait lire mon cor mort pres tant fort, ce qui ne convient pas a la rime, puisque fort rimerait avec lui-meme (v. 11). Si mort est un substantif, sujet de pres, le sens est clair “que la mort avait pris immediatement mon coeur si fort . . .” Mais alors la grammaire exige mort[s] (cas sujet). Il faudrait encore ecrire mort[s], si l’on interpretait tant fos morts “ comme s’il etait mort”. On comprendra done que ma traduction reste hypothetique. Je me resigne a interpreter, malgre ma repu- gnance : Que dese hac pres tant fort mon cor mort. Fermats et Hats, du vers 15, sont aussi des mots qu’il est dif- ficile d’interpreter. Les lexiques ne les signalent pas comme substan- tif s; or, ils semblent bien etre ici des complements pluriels de Fferman, et je ne peux comprendre que “arretant (tenant ferme) les prisonniers et les enchaines ”. Digitized by ^.ooQle 12 The Romanic Review Car, au vers 16, parait etre un mot rare, et signifier “ chere- ment ” apres le verbe trasch. Deus, du vers 21, n’est pas sans exemple. Je le trouve dans un vers de Torcafol jusqu’ici mal compris, parce qu’on n’avait pas identifie Lo Capil “ le Chapieu. ,, Et an vos claus lo cortil Sil queus son deus Lo Capil. “ Et ils vous ont clos le courtil ceux qui vous dominent sur le Chapieu.” Lo Capil (le Chapieu) etait un chateau du Gevaudan qui dominait la ville de Mende, et c’est la que, vers 1187, Torcafol ( alias Bertran de Rocafolh ), Montlaur et les ennemis de Teveque de Mende, tenaient en echec Gavin d’Apchier, qui defendait le clerge. Le mot deus signifie done “au-dessus, au-dela, jusqu’a . . et il devra passer dans les lexiques. Cest, d’ailleurs, probablement une forme de daus, contraction de devas, “vers, jusqu’a”. II manque une syllable au vers 25, et cov[in]en, qui se presente d’abord a Tesprit pour remplacer coven, ne convient guere puisqu’il signifie surtout “ convention, accord, engagement ” et non “ as- semblee ”. II y a done lieu de donner un qualificatif a coven et je propose gay, foumi, d’ailleurs, par la tornada. Le mot attendutz a parfois le sens d’ “ espoirs ”, et le vers 28 devient assez clair avec ce sens. Mais fferms et fermats du vers 29 ramenent une obscurite pareille a celle du vers 15. Le pronom que (faut-il lire qui?) dans Texpression que-s vol augmente encore la perplexite, et la phrase Fferms ten fermats que s vol est pour moi la plus inintelligible du poeme. Le vers 32 a une syllabe de trop, et je propose de supprimer cor dans ses cor fals cuts ou il ne signifie rien. Per que’b amor (v. 45) est une graphie nouvelle pour Per qufab amor. Le copiste semble Taffectionner et parait avoir ecrit que’b si au vers 13 (cf. le vers 21 du premier poeme). Au vers 46 apparait, a mon avis, une inversion extraordinaire. Le verbe a (present de aver) semble etre rejete au debut du vers: A celh quez es ab los fis affinatz Digitized by ^.ooQle Deux Pohnes de Peyre Cathala 13 II est vrai qu’on pourrait interpreter : A celh quez es ab los fis a ffinatz en donnant a ffinatz (=finatz) le sens de compagnons” ou “emules assembles”, puisque finar ( Lexique roman, III, p. 29) a parfois le sens de reunir. Plausen, du vers 49, serait un mot nouveau en langue d’oc, s’il n’etait pas une transformation de plasen ou plaisen, comme plus haut (v. 6) fau est une forme de fay. Au reste le mot ne serait pas une expression etrange, puisqu’il deriverait directement de placedere, dont le supin est placesum. II signifierait “ qu’on doit applaudir ”, comme plaisen signifie “ qui cause du plaisir.” Le “ senhal ” Mos Gays ( tornado ) est commun aux deux poemes et semble caracteriser les poesies de Peyre Cathala. M. Anglade a ecrit (p. 219) : “Le senhal qui apparait dans la tornado, quelle qu’en soit la forme exacte, ne se recontre pas chez Peire Vidal, ni, a ce qu’il semble, chez aucun autre troubadour”. On sait qu’il avait etendu ce senhal a Mos hells Appels e Capells, qu’il avait traduit, sans enthousiasme, par “Mon bel Appel et Chapel.” Mais ici les mots appelhs et capelhs ne peuvent pas etre des noms propres, puisqu’ils ont pour complements determinatifs de gang, d’onor . . . etc. II faut done traduire : “ Mon Gai a une aureole et une couronne de bonheur, d’honneur . . .”. Pelhs, dans le sens de “ chevelure ” et, au figure, d’ “aureole,” d’ “eclat”, est un mot courant. Le manuscrit donne appelhs, unissant le verbe aver (a) avec le nom, et redoublant la consonne initiale p, comme cela se produit souvent. L’expression on que sia, du vers 55 est une repetition due a la distraction du copiste, puisqu’elle se trouve aussi en rime au vers precedent, mais je ne vois pas par quoi on pourrait la remplacer. Au vers 56, entiers ne doit pas avoir l\\j du pluriel, puisqu’il rime avec requier et que, d’ailleurs, le mot frets (merite) est presque toujours singulier. Et cette longue suite de remarques montre immediatement que ma traduction sera, en grande partie, hypothetique. J’ai meme, pour cette raison, longtempts hesite a publier le poeme. Le style, artificiel et precieux avec ses rencontres de mots derives les uns des autres, me repugnait aussi, et il est impossible d'en conserver Digitized by ^.ooQle 14 The Romanic Review les artifices et les figures en frangais. Les jeux de mots, dans toutes les langues, sont comme les proverbes, le plus souvent in- traduisibles. Mais une raison superieure a fait disparaitre tous mes scruples.

Fabre Le Puy-en-Velay ( A sulvre ) Digitized by ^.ooQle SOME EARLY TREATISES ON FALCONRY W ORKS on falconry occupy a not inconsiderable place in the literature of the later Middle Ages, whether in Latin or in the various vernaculars. Interesting as a phase of the court life and manners of the period, these are also significant in the history of mediaeval science, not only as illustrating the current medical no- tions, but also as marking the growth of knowledge based upon de- tailed personal observation. For the most part these treatises con- sist of collections of remedies for diseases, in which traditional lore, superstition, and practical experience are curiously mingled. Many of them describe with some fulness various species of birds of prey and their uses, and in the later period the actual practice of falconry receives minute attention. There is much translation and much bor- rowing back and forth, and the interrelations of the several works constitute an exceedingly intricate subject. As no survey of this lit- erature has been attempted since the study of Werth in 1888, 1 it may not be out of place to call attention to certain unknown or little known manuals, chiefly of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which have come to my notice in the course of a study of the most famous of such treatises, the De arte venandi cum avibus of the Em- peror Frederick II. 2 I. — Adelard of Bath The earliest treatise on hawking so far identified in western Europe was written in England in the time of Henry I. Its author, Adelard of Bath, was not only attached in some fashion to the Eng- lish court, but had studied in France, southern Italy, and the Mo- 1 H.

Moreover, it refers specifically to earlier writings on the subject, the libri Haroldi regis, probably books once in the possession of the last Anglo-Saxon king . 4 The beginning of Adelard’s treatise indicates that it was an interlude in the more serious studies represented by the author’s Questiones naturales, also in the form of a dialogue with his nephew. The nephew begins : 8 Quoniam in causis disserendis rerum animus noster admodum fatigatus* est, ad eiusdem relevationem id magis delectabile quam grave interponendum est. Intellectus enim similiter ut arcus si nun- quam cessas tendere mollis erit. Quare in eo iudicio tale ad quod et iocundum et utile sit eligendum est. Id autem recte fieri spero si de accipitrum natura et usu 7 elegantius aperias, precipue cum et nos Angli sumus genere et eorum inde scientia pre ceteris gentibus pro- bata sit et ea deinde scientie qualitas constat* ut® quanto pluribus dividitur tanto magis efflorescet.

Tuum itaque sit inquirere, meum explicare. It ends: Hec habui que de cura accipitrum dicerem. Ceterum si tibi vel alicui alii suam addere sententifam] placet, non invideo. Adelard’s little work does not seem to have been widely used. 8 For Adelard’s biography, see my articles in the English Historical Review, XXVI, pp. 491-498 (1911), XXVIII, pp. 515 f. (1913); and Lynn Thorndike, History of Magic and Experimental Science (New York, 1922), ch. 36. 4 See my note on “ King Harold’s Books ” in the English Historical Review, April, 1922. 8 Vienna, MS. 2504, f. 49 (ca. 1200). 8 MS. fatigatitus . 7 Corrected from usque ad . 8 MS. et stat. 9 MS. ett (?). 10 MS. individua. 11 The scribe may have tried to correct the a into an 0 or vice versa. 12 MS. paritus. Digitized by ^.ooQle 20 The Romanic Review The only complete copy I have found is in MS. 2504 of the Nation- albibliotek at Vienna (ff. 49-51). The greater part is incorporated into a compilation of the thirteenth century to which we shall come below (Clare College, Cambridge, MS. 15, ff. 185-187). The ear- lier portion at least is used by the author of an Anglo-Norman poem in the British Museum (Harleian MS. 978). 18 No other treatise connected with the Anglo-Norman court is known to have survived. Daude de Pradas, writing his Romans dels ausels cassadors early in the thirteenth century, 14 cites : En un libre del rei Enric d’Anclaterra lo pros el ric, que amet plus ausels e cas que non fes anc nuill crestias, trobei d’azautz esperimens on no coue far argumens. 15 Whether the reference is to Henry I or Henry II it is impossible to say, though the latter is more likely. This would be a particularly interesting treatise to recover. II. — William the Falconer Like the Norman kings of England, the Norman rulers of Sicily were mighty hunters and hawkers, and the first who bore the royal title, Roger II (1139-54), is said to have had a falconer, Wil- liam, whose precepts are frequently cited. Thus Albertus Magnus, in the chapters of his De animalibus devoted to falcons, 10 cites in three passages William the falconer, in one instance specifically as 18 Compare the extract given by Paul Meyer in Romania, XV, 278 f., with the passage from Adelard printed below, note 36. 14 The biographical data on Daude given in the standard works are very meagre. He dedicates his poem on the cardinal virtues to Stephen, bishop of Le Puy (1220-31) ; and Torraca has found him attesting as canon of Rodez in 1214-18: Studi su la lirica italiana del duecento (Bologna, 1902), pp. 244 f. 15 Ed. Monaci (in Studi romansi, V, pp. 65-192), lines 1930-35; ed. Sachs (Brandenburg, 1865), lines 1905-10. Werth (XII, pp. 154 f., 166-171) thinks he can identify other passages in Daude derived from the libre del tex Enric. The incantations of lines 1937 ff. reappear in Albertus Magnus, c. 19. 16 Bk.

These citations can be identified in a brief treatise which in sev- eral manuscripts 18 follows the Latin text of the so-called “ Dan- cus.” 19 The last chapter of “ Dancus ” runs : Iste magister non fuit mendax sed verax, iste medicine sunt bone et perfecte et multum probate. Guilielmus falconerius qui fuit nu- tritus in curia regis Rogerii qui postea multum moratus fuit cum filio suo et habuit quendam magistrum qui vocatus fuit Martinus qui fuit sapiens et doctus in arte falconum, et iste discipulus suus Guil- ielmus scivit omnia que ipse scivit et tanto plus quod ipse composuit libellum unum de arte ista cuius principium tale est.

Falcones qui prius apparuerunt in mundo ipse bene agnovit. Falcones nigri prius apparuerunt. Venerunt a Babilonia in Montem Gebeel et deinde venerunt in Sclavoniam et deinde venerunt ad Pa- lunudum 20 quod est in pertinentiis Policastri. Magister Guillelmus is again quoted in chapter 22 : Propter carnem non perdet voluntatem venandi set propter san- guinem tantum, et hoc probavit magister Guillelmus qui plus modo fecit quam aliquis qui vivat. The treatise ends with the chapter on ysmerli cited by Albertus Magnus : 21 Sed tamen si bonus est magister potest eos facere capere grues tali dieta et tali custodia ut alii falcones, et si vult capere grues oportet habere duodecim ysmerlos. Apparently we have not William’s manual in its original form, but extracts from it, which, however, have something of the brevity to be expected from a practical falconer of the early period. The connection with Sicily is clear, not only in the statements respecting the king and the Neapolitan falconer Malgerio, but, more certainly, in the reference to the region of Policastro. If the treatise in its original form should be discovered, we should probably have one of the important sources for later writers. III. — The Court of Frederick II and his Sons In the thirteenth century the chief centre of literary activity on subjects of falconry was the court of the Emperor Frederick II. A tireless sportsman from his youth, the emperor called in expert fal- coners from many lands and devoted long years to the observation of birds and the practice of the art. He had the treatise of Mo- amyn, and probably that of Yatrib, translated from the Arabic under his personal supervision, and appears in general to have systemat- ically collected the authorities on the subject. After thirty years of preparation he dedicated to his son Manfred the De arte venandi cum 20 Lat. 7020 has Palumbidum; Reg. lat. 1446 interlines in a later hand Paludinum.

In the form known to us the De arte consists of a systematic account of birds in general and falcons in particular, followed by a detailed examination of lures and the methods of hunting with the several types of falcons. There is reason for thinking that the emperor also discussed hawks and the diseases of falcons, but this part of the work has not been recovered.** Besides half a dozen manuscripts of the Latin original, in a six-book edition and a two-book recension by Manfred, we have two different French versions made before the end of the thirteenth century.** Frederick’s favorite son Manfred inherited in large measure the intellectual interests of his father. We learn from the preface that Frederick’s De arte was finally put into form at Manfred’s request, and it was he who later searched out the notes and loose sheets of the author which are incorporated in his recension.** Another son, Enzio, well known in the literary circle of the Magna Curia, was likewise a patron of writers on falconry.

It covers the training, diseases, and species of birds of prey, beginning with falcons and ending with hawks, and is particularly full in distinguishing the varieties used in Italy. Thus the species of hawks include those of Ventimiglia, Slavonia, Calabria ( calavresi ), Istria, Sardinia, Ger- many, and the Alps ( alpisiani ) ; °° while among astures we find those of Tuscany, Lombardy, the March, Apulia, Germany, and Sicily: (f- 74v ) Incipit liber avium viventium de rapina et [de] morbis et curis et generationibus eorum. 88 On this collection see Bethmann, in Pertz's Archiv, XII, pp. 409-415. 84 MS.

Digitized by UjOOQle RENEE, A SIXTEENTH CENTURY NUN T HE late war taught us among other things that woman, whether as ministering angel or helpful coadjutor, must have method, determination, training, commingled with her ten- derness, if she is to be effective in either role. Even Florence Nightingale, we now learn — though it was as the “lady of the lamp” that she became an ideal figure in the soldiers' eyes — brought about, by practical resourcefulness, mastery of her sub- ject, methodical work and political sense, the reforms which ac- tually mitigated their lot and set the standard for the future. To struggle with cabinet ministers and committees, to secure the passage of acts of parliament, calls for gifts and qualities the very opposite of those that used to be considered exquisitely feminine. Investigation reveals that the same is true of her predecessors, the few — the very few — women who by force of character and unceasing effort changed the course of events. As we look down “the dark backward and abysm of time” to seek out these few solitary figures we may appropriately recall the dramatic tradition that the protagonist of a tragedy must be a king or other powerful person whose energies are untrammeled, for they alone are free to enter upon a telling struggle with fate; for the women who have achieved in the past are the women whom fortune has placed at an advantage even greater than that possessed by Florence Night- ingale: Lady Mary Wortley Montague (an ambassador's wife), the Empress Catherine of Russia, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Marguerite of Navarre; — the only exception seeming to lie with nuns, whose situation as they arrived at the headship of a religious house gave them scope and opportunity. The Mere Angelique, Catherine of Sienna — who by the way and not Mme. Rosika Schwimmer was really the first woman ambassador — Saint Theresa of Spain are obvious examples. These nuns were religious, devout and even mystical no doubt, but none the less they were active, practical, determined executives. And such also was the subject of this sketch, the Abbess Renee de Bourbon. 23 Digitized by CjOOQle Renee, A Sixteenth Century Nun 29 Between Saumur and Loudun in France lies a vast and beauti- ful group of buildings dating from different periods, some as early as the twelfth century, the most striking from the sixteenth, some from later periods. They form with their towers, spires, walls, and buildings large and small, a harmoniously arranged vil- lage, or rather small town. This was the ancient great convent of Fontevrault — the Royal Convent it was called. Now it is a bar- racks or official asylum of some sort, and its former inhabitants, the religious, live in exile in Spain. The very name of Fontevrault is romantic, derived as it is from that of an outlaw robber who in the eleventh century defied the world in the forest where it now stands. And romance clung always to it. Whenever the light of recorded history falls upon it, it is to reveal some brilliant or bizarre incident or personality. The strange history of the convent began with its foundation at the end of the eleventh century when Robert d’Arbrissel broke in on the forest solitude of the robber Evraud and converted him to piety. Robert was a brilliant university professor, a dignified cleric, a preacher extraordinarily eloquent, a man of great personal charm. It is a tribute to his powers of magnetism that when he went to live and pray in solitude near the robber Evraud’s fountain, he was followed by about three thousand people of both sexes. Solitude and prayer were not compatible with this company, but its advent gave the anchorite a different pious opportunity. He preached the crusade to them and thus got rid of a large number. Those who did not go crusading, and those who kept freshly flock- ing in, he formed into religious communities of men and women to whom he ministered, coming from his own solitude for the purpose. The thing became the rage ; the rich and great flocked into the former wilderness to serve God with prayer and silent physical toil, for the rule of silence (Robert must have found it a solace!) was enjoined upon them from the first. Soon the forest began to blossom, and gifts poured in, buildings were erected, land dedicated, and then a great original idea struck Robert d’Arbrissel, one that set Fontevrault apart from every other religious community. It was that the Head of the Order should always be a woman — that the monks must obey her alone — in fact Digitized by ^.ooQle 30 The Romanic Review part of their rule provided that their father confessor must give no penance which would in the least interfere with obedience to the Mother Superior. Was Robert expressing his sense of wo- manly worth or was he seeking out a discipline for men of a char- acter singularly exasperating to their amour propre? However that may be, the striking fact remains' that, in the words of the Convent’s own historian: “The submission of men to a woman is the seal, the spirit, the mark and the essential distinction of the Order of Fontevrault.” From the very first the convent was popular with the great Its first prioress was a ruling noble ; one of its subsidiary priories — and it began early to found subsidiary establishments — was pre- sided over by a queen ; its later Superiors were almost all royalties, who not only enhanced its prestige but added to its treasury orna- ments, tapestries and money. Royal Mothers Superior were not the sole claim of the convent to distinction. It was chosen also as a royal burial-place; for the Plantagfenet Kings were there interred and their tombs and statues in the Cimetiere des Rois, as it was called, became one of the glories of the place. Its reputation rested, moreover, no less upon religious than upon earthly grandeur. It was — so legend told — a Fontevrault nun whose place, when she ran away from the convent, was miraculously taken by the Vir- gin Mary during her fifteen erring years. As the Fontevrault nuns tell the story: “The angels, seeing Mary leaving Heaven, cried out : * Mary so loves the Fontevrists that she has descended among them to live their life and wear their habit!”’ It was a Fonte- vrault nun, again, who, loved at sight by an English prince, asked his messenger what poor charm of hers could have moved him. Hearing that it was her eyes that had fired him, she tore them out and sent them to him bn a dish. The jprince, repenting of his rash wishes, built a priory where this martyr of chastity was \"I or the rest of her life tended at his expense. Distinguished by such glories, religious and secular, the fame of Fontevrault spread far and wide. Dependent abbeys sprang up, and through their intercourse with Flanders and England and Spain lifted the convent quite above the conditions of ordinary monastic life. There were some thirty-four of these dependences Digitized by ^.ooQle Rente, A Sixteenth Century Nun 3 * when, in 1491, Renee de Bourbon became its Mother Superior, suc- ceeding Anne, sister of the French King Louis XII, who left all her treasure to the Abbey. Renee was herself of royal blood. The daughter of Jean de Bourbon, Count of Valois, she was, by the marriages of her seven brothers and sisters, connected with all the great families of France. From the family of one brother indeed issued the great Henri IV of France. In her own person Renee was a strange and attaching figure. When she was a child of ten a serious illness, some mysterious “catarrh,” permanently stunted her growth. But this did not — the Convent records assure us — mar the elegance and beauty of her aspect nor the sweet agreeable majesty which was naturally hers. Delicate and of a sickly habit, she was active and energetic and, as the sequel will show, of a most determined temper. Her soul, we are told, seemed almost free of the body, so spiritual was she, so ethereal. Her retentive memory, her powerful mind, her speech vivacious yet so restrained, distinguished her among other nuns. Moreover, she spoke “nothing lightly nor inadvisedly, nothing without modesty, as she did nothing ill-considered, nothing hasty, nothing without prudence.” We may fancy the young abbess of twenty-three, her black veil and white habit shrouding that tiny figure as she moved about her new domain with the soft practiced step of the accustomed nun. She was young, but she had taken the veil at the age of eight before that disastrous illness struck her, and she was used to convent ways. Now she found herself in an enviable situation — at the head of a rich community, with its many subsidiary convents and monasteries looking to her for guidance; in touch with intelligent correspond- ents all over the realm and indeed out of it; with a full treasury to her hand and that a free hand; her Convent visited, admired, imitated by the greatest in the land. These came to see for them- selves the routine of the Royal Convent or to bring sisters or daugh- ters to take the veil, or merely to do honor to their kinswoman, the Abbess. Her sister-in-law, Marie de Luxembourg, came accom- panied by a son, the Cardinal de Bourbon and five grandchildren, one of whom became a novice. The famous Chevalier Bayard was one of her visitors, and Marguerite of Navarre, the gifted and Digitized by ^.ooQle 32 The Romanic Review adored. At another time, Marguerite’s lumbering, good-natured, stingy sister-in-law, the Duchess of Alengon, brought one of her thirteen children to take the veil at Fontevrault. The King’s mother, Louise of Savoie, came on a pilgrimage and the King’s first wife Claude, and even the King, that great, irresistible charmer, Francis I himself. He brought with him a young ab- bess, his natural sister, to see and admire the rule of the Abbey. And there were swarms of lesser Valois, Bourbons, Montmo- rencies, d’Albrets, — Renee might drink her fill of earthly distinc- tion. Yet Renee’s mind dwelt on other things than power and pres- tige. She had ideals for her Convent and she had also immediate problems and obstacles to deal with. These concerned abuses, even rebellion, — but to grapple with such things was not necessarily, it may be said, a distasteful effort to one of her temper. After the first years — or the first century — of the Order’s existence, when ardor had had time to cool, the convents had slipped into easy ways. The monks, above all, digesting ill what seemed to them that unnatural rule of their Founder’s about man’s obedience to woman, fell away from their duty to the Abbess and drew off to manage alone their own affairs as men and monks. It is easy to see, once rebellion became precedent, what a front en- trenched prejudice must have offered to any Abbess who should attempt to bring it to terms. Throughout the thirteenth and four- teenth centuries, laxity of discipline and rebellion were constantly in evidence. One Superior after another made attempts — mostly abortive — to restore discipline and order. In the fifteenth century at least one, Marie de Bretagne, set her hand sternly to the task, induced the Pope to have the convents visited, and even secured from him a bull authoritatively restoring the Abbeys to their Founder’s rule. As token of her satisfaction she left to the Order a splendid fortune. But Fontevrault had, under her successors, relapsed into the old easy recalcitrant ways, and Renee when she “made her entry and was inducted into her Abbey,” cast on it a disapproving eye and determined on a most thorough reform. It was an arduous undertaking enough, for she not only aimed at seeing that the Founder’s rules were enforced and her own au- Digitized by ^.ooQle Rente, A Sixteenth Century Nun 33 thority rendered absolute, but was minded to further the ends of piety by cloistering her nuns, which thing had never been done be- fore. She began, wisely enough, by endeavoring to persuade the subsidiary establishments to accept reform, strict “ clausure ” and obedience. With this end in view, she undertook, in her litter, long journeys which were, in those days, most difficult and danger- ous, and her untiring efforts, added to those of her predecessors, were crowned with a full measure of success. The dependent monasteries accepted reform one after another with more or less grace, but Fontevrault, alas ! — the crown and jewel of all — remained recalcitrant, even after twelve years of effort. But Renee was determined. If she dealt with Fontevrault last it was to be the more sternly. Off she set in 1 503 to Paris in her indefatigable litter and got the Parliamentary Court to pass a de- cree legalizing her attempts at reformation. Having on her return “ declared to the nuns her wishes and intentions,” and, recognizing that they were as determined as she was, that they meant to defy her, to go their own way and to support the monks in going theirs, Renee, “guided,” we are told, “by great and marvellous zeal for the honor of God and the augmentation of holy observ- ance, gathered together at great expense a company of wise and powerful persons, both monks and laymen, and, by their aid and counsel, expelled the rebellious nuns ” who resisted her reform and packed them off in litters “honorably accompanied, to pass the rest of their lives religiously and devoutly ” in her other reformed convents, where — it is to be inferred — they could do no harm. Meanwhile she imported more docile nuns from outside convents, sending as far as Normandy and Paris to secure the most devout or the most nialleable. But this was not all. Renee had in her mind stern ideas of the cloister, and with these in view she began to build around the monastery a great wall, which, by the King’s own command — Francis I, strict in piety if lax in manners, had become 4 thoroughly interested in her projects — was to be finished by a grille and tower. The Royal Officers were beginning to set up the grille when the rebellious monks, helped by such discontented nuns as remained, interposed repeated physical resistance. Renee appealed to the law — got in fact the sixteenth century equivalent Digitized by Google 34 The Romanic Review of an injunction — and then persuaded her brother to lend his soldiers, the King’s Swiss guard, for the purpose of bringing force to bear. The soldiers and guards “cast out” a number of the guilty nuns and their leaders, important members, holding in- deed the chief offices of the Community. “ Madame,” the chron- icle reads, “had them led off in litters carried by monks, and in chariots also and all at her own expense.” Thereupon the King’s officials set the grille and completed the tower. We might, mutatis mutandis, be reading of local authorities dealing with a strike in our own time. Even though the Convent was thus, by the departure of such numbers, reduced almost to a solitude, it still — so it appeared — harbored rebellion. Inspired by some of the remaining nuns, the expelled monks who had returned by stealth helped by certain townsmen entered one of the monks’ dormitories, drove out the dutiful brethren who had remained, broke down the tower and grille, and openly defied their feminine Superior. She was quite equal to the situation, entirely undaunted in fact, and she took such measures — of their nature we are not informed — that, under their compulsion, the rebellious monks appeared crestfallen and contrite before her in front of the great grille and, under the eyes of the military authorities, humbly asked her pardon. The Abbess received them into her grace, after which no one again ventured to create disorder of the kind. Shortly after this incident, Renee set a practical example of her teaching by herself taking the vow of the cloister, “ which no Su- perior of the Order had ever done before.” We may imagine what it cost her! For that active and indefatigable spirit so to restrict herself was as if a formidable pugilist should tie one hand behind his back. Journeys to seek the aid of courts or of the great, or to secure the support of other convents, were thereafter of course out of the question. Renee was left to fight it out with her subordi- nates on her own ground with such support only as she could ob- tain by correspondence. And she felt the change. The troublesome monks began to practice the intrigue for which there is always room in secluded establishments and succeeded in getting the ear of sisters who were Digitized by ^.ooQle Renee, A Sixteenth Century Nun 35 in her confidence. Through them they brought pressure upon her to leave to the monks that authority over their own affairs which they had gradually gained before her attempts at reforming them. They threatened that, if she did not yield, they would — as was apparently in their power — use their suffrage to make her office merely triennial. Renee — for the sake of peace and for the very sake and safety of her reform — was obliged to concede much and to come to terms at last somewhat humiliating. Worse, when she fell grievously ill, the rebels wrested from her in her weakness nearly all their demands — practical nullification of her reforms and a great diminution of her own powers — by the threat that when she was dead her successors should be chosen triennially and not in perpetuity. That she felt herself forced by this threat to yield, “ to the unsupportable prejudice of her authority ” is evidence that her concern was for her community and not for her own power; but the Convent records shed another light upon her character by adding simply enough that as soon as she was well again she re- voked her concessions! She had strength enough for that and, with whatever constant strain and struggle, she held her own from thenceforth to the end. She occupied her time in endless correspondence, successfully at- tempting to secure the legal sanction of her reforms. She received it in 1519 after fifteen years of unceasing effort “by all ways and manners possible” — and after five further years of tireless appli- cation she secured a Papal bull to support the legal sanction. As a last triumphant move she got the King’s Council to send to Fonte- vrault a commission consisting of six neutral monks from other Convents on whose report the Council added its final sanction to the rest. That was the crown of her efforts. We may fancy her secure, justified, triumphant, settling down to enjoy, so far as Convent vows permit enjoyment, the remnant of her days. It was cer- tainly not without its satisfaction. Renee spent it in building “with great charm and without vulgar ostentation.” She sold all her personal treasures and with the proceeds of the sale added splendor to the fine mass of the Convent buildings, the number of whose devotees she had by her vigorous disciplinary measures so remarkably diminished.

The noble edifices which she left behind are her best, indeed her only, monument. They make a claim on the gratitude of generations quite ignorant of the other task which Renee so zealously performed, for she, as little as any of us children of fate, knew which of those efforts that her heart was set upon should, on the one hand, serve humanity and which, on the other hand, was dedicated to nothingness. Caroline Ruutz-Rees Digitized by ^.ooQle THE ORCHARD SCENE IN TYDOREL AND SIR GOWTHER I N an article on the Lay of Yonec, which appeared in this review, X (1919), pp. 123 sq., I called attention to a group of stories dealing with a theme, analogous to that of Marie’s poem, in which a supernatural being,, god, angel or devil, appears to a mortal woman, maid or wife, begets a child, and before his departure from her gives her a name which she is to bestow upon the child which she will bear. My evidence showed that this theme, which may be called that of the Supernatural Father, was, on the one hand, very common in oriental and classical literature, and, on the other, was wide-spread and popular in the west before the Lay of Yonec was written. I suggested, also, that the detail of the bestowal of the name derived ultimately from sacred story, whether Lives of the Saints, or, more probably, directly from apocryphal versions of the birth of Christ. These same apocryphal Gospels furnish us also, it seems to me, the source of another episode which is found in some stories dealing with the theme of the Supernatural Father, and it may not be amiss to summarize briefly the story of Christ’s birth as it is told in the so-called Pseudo-Matthew. This Latin version of the Gospel story was derived either directly from a Greek version, the Protevangelium Iacobi, dating not later certainly than the 3rd cen- tury, or from the same sources as the latter; and was current as early at least as the 5th century. Upon it in turn was based another Latin Gospel, the Evangelium de Nativitate Mariae . 1 The Pseudo-Matthew begins with an account of the parents of Mary, Anna and Joachim. The latter was a wealthy shepherd who had been married to his wife for twenty years. In spite of their prayers for a child, they had had no issue, and one day, when 1 These Gospels are edited by Tischendorf, Evangelia Apocrypha , 2nd ed. f 1874.

Joachim, therefore, in the deep sorrow of his heart, left his wife and home and departed with his flocks to a distant land, so that for five months he was able to hear no word from his wife. She, in the meanwhile, was filled with grief, and one day weeping bitterly she went out into the orchard of her house and poured forth her soul to God in prayer. Raising her eyes to heaven she saw a nest of sparrows in a laurel tree, and she cried aloud to God that He would give her, as He had given to these birds and to the beasts of th? field, a child which, male or female, she might consecrate to His service in His temple. As she spoke there appeared suddenly before her a handsome youth, who declared himself to be an angel of the Lord, sent to tell her that she would have issue, and that what she should bear would be the wonder of the world without end. About this time also the same angel appeared to Joachim, who was with his flocks on the hills, and told him that his wife had conceived from his seed, which God had quickened, and that she would bring forth a daughter who would have a place in the temple of God ; that in this daughter the Holy Spirit would abide, and that she would be blessed above all women; the angel then bade him return to his home. Joachim obeyed, and in the fulness of time a daughter was bom to Anna and she named the child Mary. The writer indulges, thereupon, in a long description of the re- markable powers of this precocious child, matter which may be omitted here since it does not concern the question in hand. When she' was fourteen years of age, the High Priest announced that, according to the law, a woman of that age could not remain in the temple, but must be given in wedlock to some man of one of the tribes of Israel. The husband was to be chosen by divine lot, and the lot, denoted by the flowering of his staff, fell upon Joseph, an old man. He enters a disclaimer on the ground of his age, refus- ing to marry a girl who was not any older than his grandchildren. He consents, however, to keep Mary under his charge until he might learn from God to which one of his sons he should marry her. The High Priest decides, however, that Mary can marry no one else, and he appoints five maidens to stay with her in Joseph’s house until he has made up his mind to obey the Lord’s command. Digitized by ^.ooQle The Orchard Scene in Tydorel and Sir Gowther 39 So to Joseph’s house went Mary attended by the five maidens, but Joseph departed to a distant place to engage in his work as carpenter. One day, while Mary was standing by the well waiting to fill her urn, there appeared before her an angel of God, a young man, who declared to her that a light from heaven would come and abide in her; and a second time, while she was in her room, the same angel, in the shape of a handsome youth, appeared, and made a similar declaration, adding that she would bring forth a king who would reign for ever and ever. After nine months had passed, Joseph returned, and noticing the condition of Mary, concludes that she has been unfaithful. He questions her attendants, but they assure him that no mortal man has been near her, that they have watched over her carefully, that daily came angels of God unto her and conversed with her; and that, in short, no one except the angel of God could be responsible for her condition. Joseph expresses doubt of this and suggests the possibility that some one might have disguised himself as an angel and thus deceived her. He decides, therefore, to withdraw from the eyes of men, but the angel appears to him in a dream, bids him take Mary without fear, and tells him that she has conceived by the Holy Spirit, and will bring forth a son : “ and his name will be called Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.” The account given in the De Nativitate Mariae differs, as far as our theme is concerned, only slightly from this. In the story of Anna and Joachim it adds the incident of the bestowal of the name upon the child before birth, but omits this detail in the case of the child of Joseph and Mary. In the latter story it omits, also, the meeting between the angel (who is expressly named Gabriel) and Mary at the well. 2 That these stories are based upon the wide-spread belief* that 2 In the Protev. Jacobi, ch. XI, the angel does not, as in Ps. Matth., appear in person to Mary while she is at the well, but only as a voice, and not until she reaches her room does he come in bodily shape. The specific name for the angel comes from Luke, I, 26. On the part which is assigned to Gabriel in Gnostic and other writings, cf. Bauer, op. cit., pp. 52 sq. * Cf. the references cited in my earlier paper, pp. 137 sq. ; Hartland, Primi- tive Paternity, I, pp. 16-17; Weinreich, Der Trug des Nektanebos, Leipzig, 1911, p. 1, n. 4. Weinreich does not bring the apocryphal Gospels into his discussion, although Joseph’s reply to the maidens, when he questions them concerning Digitized by ^.ooQle 40 The Romanic Review supernatural beings can have intercourse with mortal women, there can be no doubt. The maidens who attend Mary in Joseph’s house were sure that an angel and no mortal man was responsible for her condition. As far therefore as the fundamental idea is concerned, this story of the birth of Mary is to be compared with Marie’s Yonec and similar stories in oriental and classical literature such as I cited in my former article, which deal with the theme of the Supernatural Father. There are, however, several details which differentiate the story of Anna and Joachim very decidedly from the Yonec and similar tales. Whereas in the latter group the woman, whose barrenness and longing for a child are never empha- sized, is in her room — either of her own volition or because she is confined there by a father or a jealous husband when the divine being appears to her, in the former, and in the Ps.-Matthew version of the Mary story, she is out of doors when the supernatural being approaches her . 4 Anna, brokenhearted by the disgrace which has come upon her husband because of her barrenness, goes out into her garden (irapaSeurw in the Greek version, pomerium in the Latin), and casts herself down in prayer beneath a laurel tree. Mary likewise is out of doors, standing by the well, when the angel first appears to announce her approaching motherhood. There are, however, two well-known stories of the Middle Ages dealing with our theme in which these very details are made prom- inent, in which are emphasized the barrenness of the woman, her grief over her childless state, and her longing 6 for a child, and in which the woman, instead of being in her room when the super- natural being appears, is in her garden or orchard, under a tree. The first of these stories is the French poem, the lay of Tydorel, Mary’s condition, affords interesting evidence for the existence, outside the Alexander story, of tales dealing with a mortal’s masquerade as a god. 4 In numerous other stories also, which, however, are generally to be as- signed to a different type of tale, the meeting between the supernatural being and the mortal takes place by a spring, well, or river. Such a setting is natural in stories which originated among southern peoples and is common in oriental and Greek literature. Cf. the references cited in my article on “The Stag Messenger,” A. J. P. XXXVII, 1916, pp. 387 sq. 5 This feature is, of course, common and characterizes a group of tales to which Breul, who has studied the cycle in his Sir Gowther, eine Englische Romanze aus dem XVten Jahrhundert, Oppeln, 1866, applied the name “ Kinder- wunsch”; cf. Crane, Rom. Rev. V, 1914, pp. 55 sq. Digitized by ^.ooQle The Orchard Scene in Tydorel and Sir Gowther 41 certainly posterior to Marie’s Yonec and influenced by it. 6 In this poem a king is away from home hunting; his wife, who has been barren during their ten years of wedlock, goes one day into her garden, sits down under a fruit tree, and falls asleep. Upon awak- ening she is confronted by a handsome youth who confesses his love for her, carries her away upon his steed across a lake, tells her that she will bear him a son, whom she will name Tydorel, and that he will become great. The other story is the English romance, Sir Gowther , a version of the well-known Robert the Devil story. 7 Here a duke and his wife are childless and grieve much on this account. The latter, “ preyd to god and Mare mylde, Schuld gyffe hur grace to have a chyld, On what maner scho ne ro3th.

A nangell com fro hevon bryght, And told me so pis same nyght, Y hope, was godus sand.” This is the only version of the Robert the Devil story in which the meeting between the woman and the supernatural being takes place in a garden, or orchard, under a tree, and many years ago Professor Kittredge called attention 8 to the similarity between this scene in Sir Gowther and that in the lay of Tydorel to which I have referred. He cited as a parallel another English poem, Sir Orpheo, 6 Edited by G. Paris, Rom. VIII, 1879, pp. 66 sq. Cf. Miss Ravenel, P. M. L. A. XX, 1905, pp. 152 sq. 7 Edited by Breul, op . tit.

In this poem Heurodys, the queen — whether she is barren or not, we are not told — is sleeping under a tree in her orchard when the fairies come and carry her off to their abode. In this case, moreover, her husband is with her and a large band of knights; nor is the theme connected in any way with the theme of the Supernatural Father. Professor Kittredge was sure, however, that Sir Orpheo owed many of its details to Celtic literature, and he included among these details this scene in the orchard. This conclusion he supported by the following evi- dence : — the orchard scene occurs in Tydorel, which is, therefore, a Celtic lay because it contains an orchard scene similar to that in Sir Orpheo, and because, in some English ballads, a mortal man is asleep under a tree when the fairies come to him. Sir Gowther, therefore, because it contains an orchard scene similar to that in Sir Orpheo and Tydorel, and because this scene occurs in no other version of Robert the Devil, and because in all other versions of the latter story Robert is devoted to the devil before his birth, whereas in Sir Gowther he is the son of a daemon, must be derived, in regard to these details, from Celtic literature. These conclusions might be deemed plausible if there was cited from Celtic literature any story — any story, that is, the Celtic or, more specifically, Irish origin of which rests upon a sounder foun- dation than mere assumption — in which, as in Tydorel and Sir Gowther, a woman who is barren and longs for a child is visited, during the absence of her husband, by a supernatural being while she is in a garden or an orchard under a tree. Not only, however, is no such story cited, but in an early Irish tale which deals with the theme of Robert the Devil, the orchard scene has no place. 9 Of the ultimate source of this scene there can be, it seems to me, no doubt. No one can read the lines from Sir Gowther, with their emphasis upon the sadness of the man and the wife over their childless state, the wife’s prayers to “Mary mild,” the description of the scene in the orchard, the appearance of the supernatural lover whom she describes as an angel bright, and her expressed hope that •This tale forms the first part of the Imram Htii Corra, edited and trans- lated by Stokes, Revue celtique, IX, 447 sq.; X, 50 sq.; cf.

Digitized by Google The Orchard Scene in Tydorel and Sir Gowther 43 he prove to be the son of God, without catching the echo of the old Apocryphal story of Anna, the wife of Joachim. It is evident, also, that the similar scene in Tydorel derives from the same source or from some version of it. The universal popularity of these Apocryphal Gospels throughout the Middle Ages is attested not only by the many versions of them in the vernacular, but by the wide use made of them generally, 10 and nothing is more natural than that such a feature as this orchard scene should have passed from them into profane literature. Whether in the case of Tydorel and Sir Gowther the borrowing was direct, as I am inclined to think was true of the latter, 11 or whether the episode had already become traditional and been carried from story to story per ora virutn, to be caught finally by a poet who gave it literary treatment, cannot be settled definitely, and no one cares ; we can say decisively, however, that Celtic literature had nothing whatever to do with the origin of the orchard scene.

According to Miss Ravenel, op. cit.. Sir Gowther is the result of a fusion of elements drawn from Robert le Diable and the Lai de Tydorel, and she apparently accepts the conclusion of Professor Kittredge in regard to the provenience of the orchard scene.

The earlier travellers tell us that in the more primitive houses there were no windows, the only light coming from the open door or the opening in the roof above the hearth. 1 Adams writes from Bilbao, January 15, 1780: “The houses, as well as everywhere else, were without chim- neys, fires or windows; and we could find none of those comforts and conveniences to which we all had been accustomed from the cradle, nor any of that sweet and quiet repose in sleep, upon which health and happiness so much depend.’’ Even where there were windows, there was in many cases no glass, nothing but the wooden shutter to be opened or closed at will. Adams describes the two windows in his room at Castellano as “port holes, without any glass” with two wooden doors to open and shut before them. 2 In the houses of the villages through which Mrs. Cushing passed on her way from Inin to Tolosa there was no glass. Sometimes there was an iron grating, but usually she found only chinks cut in the wall to admit light. 8 Even at the Fonda del Obispo in Toledo there was no glass in the windows. When the shutters were closed the room was perfectly dark and when opened thoroughly chilled. 4 While she found that the houses of the better class had balconies, the windows opening upon these did not always * This article is part of an extended study of the impressions of American travellers in Spain, of which it will form a single chapter (provisionally chapter V) . 1 John Adams and Mrs. A.

On a journey from Granada to Barcelona in 1829, Irving makes the following entry in his journal at Lorca on the third of August : “ No glass in these parts of Spain.” 6 In the miserable venta of Esteras where the anon- ymous author of Scenes in Spain stopped in 1831 there was but one small window and this was of oiled parchment. 7 Cheever tells us that the room he occupied at one of the inns between Colmenar and Granada had only one grated window. This was without glass but had a wooden shutter to keep out the damp air. 8 Sometimes there were small panes of glass set in the wooden shutters. The sitting- room of a venta where Bryant stopped in 1857 was so lighted but the sleeping rooms were dark. 9 The discomfort caused by the lack of windows was augmented in many cases by the peculiar arrangement of stable and living rooms. Frequently in the vent as, mules and other animals were kept in the same room as the guests, and during the greater part of the period we are studying, the stable, even in the cities, was usually found under the same roof as the living rooms. Arthur Lee was much disgusted during his short visit to Spain in 1777 at finding the living rooms over the stables. 10 Adams found in Galicia a similar arrangement of the kitchen on the same floor as the stable. “On the same floor with the kitchen was the stable, but this was always open, and the floor of the stable was covered with miry straw like the kitchen. I went into the stable, and saw it filled on 5 Ibid., p. 49- *The Journals of Washington Irving (from July, 1815, to July, 1842); ed. by William P.
