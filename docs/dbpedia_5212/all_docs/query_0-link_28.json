In the interest of consistency, I have modernized the orthography of early modern texts throughout, whether they are quoted from original or modern editions.\n\nPreface\n\nThis is not a book about Louis XIV. Although I invite the reader to join me in close scrutiny of texts and paintings that focus intently on portraying the king, and whose production is often commissioned and supervised— sometimes even in part effectuated—by the king himself, my goal in doing so is not to offer yet another study of the man monumentalized at Versailles. The inquiry will certainly take us to Versailles, to its symbolic core in Charles Le Brun’s paintings on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors celebrating the exploits of the king. It will also lead us to the inner secrets of the workings of absolutism as laid out by the king and his team of secretaries in the radically understudied Mémoires written for his oldest son, the Dauphin. Furthermore, we will look closely at some written portraits of the king that may seem so excessive, so outlandish, so absurd to modern readers that it has proved next to impossible for scholars not to take them as subversive mockery. They are not. It is in fact a central claim of this book that these seeming absolutist absurdities are driven by the same logic that we find at the heart of absolutism, both in the king’s secret Mémoires and in its public self-expression in the Hall of Mirrors. Their absurdity, rather than a deviation or failure of the logic of absolutism, is constitutive of political absolutism itself. However, instead of measuring them anachronistically against modern standards of political rationality, I argue that we as modern readers can see them much more meaningfully as different expressions of the same dream. A dream propelled by its own logic, shot through with ideals about glory, exemplarity, and excess. A dream of absolutism that the king, his image-makers, the court, if not the whole nation, dreamt together collectively and that perhaps remains latent in the collective political imaginary today to a larger extent than we would like to think. Rather than about Louis XIV, this book is about that dream.\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nOn the face of it, the project of this book is thus quite straightforward: an exploration of three very different yet complementary windows into the dream and logic of absolutism—namely, the king’s Mémoires (chapter 1), Le Brun’s paintings in the vault of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles (chapter 2), and two particularly exuberant written portrayals of the king (chapter 3). In this sense, the proof is in the pudding: the import and impact of the project depends mainly on the execution of these analyses and on the pertinence of what they yield. However, as an intervention in the scholarship on the culture of French absolutism widely construed, my enterprise is more controversial, more provocative than this description makes it seem. The book asks us, as modern readers, to suspend for a moment what we think we know not only about absolutism but also about these artifacts and their way of communicating. My premise is that in order to discern the logic of absolutism, we need to analyze closely those cultural expressions that might sit uncomfortably with our modern democratic sensibility. These are cultural artifacts that inevitably strike a post-Romantic observer as lacking in originality and serving as mere propaganda. To our cognitive categories, they register, as if by default, either as expressions of unapologetic subservience or, conversely, as subversive vehicles. But they are neither. Instead, they are witnesses to a still-premodern way of figuring the authority of the monarchical ruler, a figuring that needs to be approached as expression and manifestation— what I call here the dream of absolutism—rather than as the more familiar representation, construction, or fabrication.\n\n•\n\nIntroduction\n\n•\n\nThe first plate of this book takes us directly to the heart of its argument.1 Seemingly, the inscription under this famous painting by Charles Le Brun captures the essence of absolutism: “Le Roi gouverne par luimême, 1661” (The King governs on his own, 1661). The image condenses this essence in the gesture of the king’s right hand, firmly holding the rudder of the ship of state after the death of Cardinal Mazarin in 1661. It showcases the foundational moment of French absolutism, while itself being a monument of this very moment displayed at the heart of absolutist France: the central detail of the central painting in the vault of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. However, as I argue in chapter 2, the simplicity in the message is itself a retroactive projection. It is so, first of all, in the sense that the king’s 1661 decision only became decisive in retrospect, while the contemporary sources tell a much more complex story. Designed in the late 1670s and completed in the early 1680s, this painting’s imposition of 1661 as an absolute beginning is therefore itself already a dream. A dream about absolutist self-creation dreamt collectively by painter, court, king—reemerging across media in all the other sources this book explores and repeated by modern scholars. But the simplicity of the message is also complicated by the painting itself, and even by its original inscription. The pithy line is another retroactive projection from the following century, while the long-lost original tripartite Latin inscription shifts our attention to the king’s attention: his gesture, as condensed in the reach of his left arm and the direction of his gaze, is directed toward what drives him to his foundational action. As he seizes the helm of the state, the king is “burning with love for glory” (“gloriæ amore incenditur”)—entirely consumed by future glory, as figured in the painting by the Roman god of war, Mars, pointing to the female 1. See the color gallery following page 124.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nallegory of glory up on the cloud. That cloud itself belongs more properly to the realm of dreams, and the ex nihilo origin of absolutism emerges from this dream, is this dream. We join the dream when our retrospective gaze on the painting somehow mirrors the king’s prospective one in the painting, as he looks longingly toward the future, which is the present of the beholder at Versailles (including, as we shall soon see, the present of the king himself)—if not the past, as in our case. The dream of absolutism is, in other words, there from the beginning; it is itself the beginning, but at the same time also already ours, in our willingness to dream along. This first glimpse at the central constellation of Charles Le Brun’s iconographic project in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles is not yet an interpretation or even the beginning of an analysis, which will have to wait until chapter 2. But it already bears the promise of a layered complexity and conceptual richness to be explored. There is a peculiar logic at work here, which I call “the dream of absolutism”: a dream that is not only displayed but also enacted, a dream that the painting itself dreams. But if this is so, why haven’t the conceptual complexity and richness at the symbolic center of Versailles already been examined? Indeed, how to explain that none of the artifacts of absolutism analyzed in this book have been taken seriously by the rich scholarship on the culture of absolutism in France? This book is born from the realization that these questions have a very simple answer: The material is virtually unexplored because it is almost unthinkable that it has anything pertinent to tell us. Taken out of context, such a statement could perhaps come off as polemical, controversial, or confrontational, but as formulated here, it serves as a mere observation of fact. And yet, this unthinkability needs to be thought through and understood before turning to the exploration of absolutist artifacts in the later chapters of the book. Therefore, the first half of this introduction proposes something quite different from a traditional survey of the scholarship on absolutism and absolutist culture: rather than situating the project in a wider field, my goal is to uncover habits of thought that foreclose the possibility of submitting this corpus of absolutist artifacts to serious analysis. Less than an introduction proper, doing preliminary groundwork, the aim of the first two sections is a clearing of the ground—in this case the groundwork for a very different kind of approach, presented in the second half of the introduction. The intervention this book seeks to make is therefore not limited to the outcome of the specific explorations in its three chapters. Beyond the individual conclusions, what is at stake is the status of the artifacts, the methodology used to examine them, and ultimately the concept of abso-\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nlutism itself. In what follows I start with the latter, making my case for the “problem” of absolutism in the way that the concept is normally deployed, arguing that its analytical application relies on an already modern—and, as I shall demonstrate, therefore contradictory—apprehension of absolute kingship. Paradoxically, this approach has led to an inability to engage seriously with the corpus discussed here and, even more importantly, to an inability to reckon with the phantasmal or dreamlike compulsion that may yet draw us in the twenty-first century toward absolutism even after absolutism. Second, I make a more technical argument about how this misconception positions the modern observer or scholar in relation to the culture of absolutism in a way that will easily lead us to reduce absolutism’s artifacts to mere propaganda. As I argue, this reduction to propaganda is so omnipresent that we do it without noticing and without weighing what we thereby exclude from our thinking about absolutist culture. For example, this reduction may take the form of a seemingly innocent application of a modern communication model (analyzing the artifact as the communication of a message), without taking proper consideration of questions of diffusion and intended recipients. This is the surprising case of the Cordouan Lighthouse discussed later in the introduction (19–20) and much of the material in the following chapters. The two incursions into the concepts of absolutism and propaganda in the first half of the introduction are necessary in order to open a space for thinking differently and non-reductively about what I call expressions of absolutism in the second half of the introduction. Importantly, the framework brought forth here is not at all of my own making. Instead, it implies a return to the period’s own thinking about kingship through the radically under-explored categories of royal glory and royal exemplarity (section 3) and, finally, the notion of the dream (section 4).\n\n1. The Problem with Absolutism The main problem when discussing absolutism is not so much that modern scholars and observers don’t really know what it is about—or better, what it was about—but rather that we are so convinced that we do. Absolutism is something of the past, to be sure, but we relate to it as a close and recognizable past. Unlike modes of governing from an unequivocally premodern era or from a non-Western culture, we approach absolutism with the assumption that our modern political conceptual categories are applicable when we make sense of it. It is the past’s moment of becoming modern, as characterized in the specific context of absolutism in the age of Louis XIV through a long series of processual nouns, including\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nmodernization, secularization, rationalization, instrumentalization, bureaucratization, centralization—if not as a more abrupt transition, as in revolutions in communication, in the management of information, in the control of human life processes, in the waging of war, and so on. All of these processes and developments are certainly well documented and their study important; however, it is my claim that it is not obvious that they promote our understanding of absolutism as such. What if absolutism were not really the fixed, fetishized moment constructed by these processes (so familiar to us because already carried by a modern rationality)? What if these modernizing constructions in fact impede or preclude our access to what absolutism was? What if absolutism were located in the unfamiliar moment prior to the temporal block constituted by this modernization, driven by a premodern logic from whence all these processes flow? This series of questions lies at the heart of a central paradox in the scholarship on French absolutism. As modern historians have long noted, the study of the reign of Louis XIV has resulted in “the contradiction of an absolutism that we know incomparably well in its [historical] details but without a good grasp of its [conceptual] totality and coherence.”2 Yet this absent “totality and coherence” will not, cannot be found either in the political treatises of the period (there is no theory of absolutism) or through an abstraction from the details on the ground (which do not, in any meaningful way, constitute an archive of absolutism). Absolutism has no room for prehistory; it emerges, as shown in my first brief look at the central painting in the Hall of Mirrors, from a retrospectively constructed point of origin, erasing not only what came before it but also the historicity of its actual process of becoming. As I show repeatedly throughout this book, absolutism writes, paints, dreams its own origin.3 As an analytical 2. “[O]n en est arrivé à cette contradiction d’un absolutisme qu’on connaît incomparablement dans son détail, sans qu’on en saisisse bien l’ensemble et la coherence.” Cosandey and Descimon, L’absolutisme en France, 296. For three important contributions to the scholarship on French absolutism from recent years, see Drevillon, Les rois absolus; Jouanna, Le Pouvoir absolu; and Jouanna, Le Prince absolu. 3. This statement does not imply, of course, that French absolutism is not part of a larger history. There is certainly a French theorization of sovereignty in the century before Louis XIV (most importantly by jurists like Jean Bodin and Cardin Le Bret) that can be—and has indeed been—considered to prepare for the advent of absolutism. However, the realization of absolutism with Louis XIV transcends the prior theorization of sovereignty to such an extent that the “totality and coherence” of absolutism need to be sought elsewhere. In other words, the prehistory of absolutism becomes visible as such only through the reign of Louis XIV, whose absolutist “totality and coherence” are, in part, predicated upon the erasure of this prehistory.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\ntool, therefore, absolutism is useful because it brings into focus the practices of monarchical power’s self-representation, rather than because of its indexical value, pointing to a stable definition or sparking discussion on what that definition should be. Indeed, the only place where absolutism incontestably exists is in its manifestations, in the image of itself that royal power projects both outward and inward, in the dream that absolutism is. What I call “the problem with absolutism” has its origin in a temporal disjunction in the concept of absolutism itself, between what is being observed and the point of observation. Scholars know that the term has always been used retrospectively, since a first attested use by François-René de Chateaubriand in 1797. It later came to prominence in the nineteenth century both in French and English, generally as part of an opposition to what came after it, be it enlightenment, revolution, modernity, or later forms of un-absolute (constitutional) monarchy. It is true that the use of the nominalized form “absolutism” is so close to actual seventeenthcentury French political uses of the adjective absolu (with pouvoir absolu [absolute power] and roi absolu [absolute king] attested as early as 1636) that the imposition of the noun might feel like only a very light anachronism, naming a practice of government that was incontestably there at the time. Nevertheless, the specific emergence of the term still bears the risk of reducing the phenomenon observed to a less advanced, less rational, or less modern precursor of what it is opposed to. Confined to its place in prehistory, it is defined mainly by what it is lacking, as compared to more recent modes of governing. This is still the case in the way the term is used today, starting with the nearly identical primary definitions in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and the French Grand Robert: “The practice of absolute government; absolute authority, despotism.”4 To our modern sensibility, there is only a comma separating “despotism” and “absolutism.” At the same time, any informed observer is of course aware of what is missing here, as spelled out in the much more historically accurate definition of absolutism in the French Trésor de la langue française (TLF): “System of government where the sovereign holds 4. OED, “absolutism.” The definition in the Grand Robert runs as follows: “Système de gouvernement, régime politique où le pouvoir du souverain est absolu, n’est soumis à aucun contrôle.” (System of government, political regime where the power of the sovereign is absolute, not subject to any control.) The proximity to despotism is highlighted by a list of cross-references including terms such as “autocracy,” “despotism,” “dictatorship,” “tyranny.” Grand Robert, “absolutisme.” The wider discussion of the conceptual history of the notion of absolutism in this paragraph relies on the sources mentioned in n. 2 above (particularly the introduction in Cosandey and Descimon, L’absolutisme en France), in addition to the dictionaries quoted in this and the following note.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigur e 1. “Rex.

Or at least, unthinkable for the concept of absolutism. Indeed, it is as if the concept’s temporal disjunction itself served to obfuscate the premodern foundation of the structure it describes, as if the core of the historical phenomenon the term is meant to describe were excluded from its very concept. The result is a contradiction rendered visible in a well-known drawing by William Makepeace Thackeray (fig. 1). From the vantage point of 1840, Thackeray decomposes a representation of King Louis (“Ludovicus Rex”) in all his splendor, clearly inspired by Hyacinthe Rigaud’s 1701 iconic painting (fig. 2), into the royal adornment and finery on the one hand (“Rex”) and the unadorned old man on the other (“Ludovicus”). The drawing appears in Thackeray’s Paris Sketch Book, where he comments upon it at length in the essay “Meditations at Versailles” in the following way: 5. “Système de gouvernement où le souverain possède une puissance de droit divin et sans limites constitutionnelles.” TLF, “absolutisme”; my emphasis.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nIn Louis [XIV], surely, if in any one, the majesty of kinghood is represented. But a king is not every inch a king, for all the poet may say; and it is curious to see how much precise majesty there is in that majestic figure of Ludovicus Rex. In the plate opposite [here, fig. 1], we have endeavoured to make the exact calculation. The idea of kingly dignity is equally strong\n\nFigur e 2. Hyacinthe Rigaud, Louis XIV (ca. 1701).

As for the little, lean, shrivelled, paunchy old man, of five feet two, in a jacket and breeches, there is no majesty in him, at any rate; and yet he has just stept out of that very suit of clothes. Put the wig and shoes on him, and he is six feet high;—the other fripperies, and he stands before you majestic, imperial, and heroic! Thus do barbers and cobblers make the gods that we worship: for do we not all worship him? Yes; though we all know him to be stupid, heartless, short, of doubtful personal courage, worship and admire him we must; and have set up, in our hearts, a grand image of him, endowed with wit, magnanimity, valour, and enormous heroical stature.6\n\nThackeray’s passage further develops the point made so boldly in the drawing through the emphasis placed on “equally strong.” The sense of majesty and dignity associated with the king is not only supported by “the wig, the high-heeled shoes, and cloak, all fleurs-de-lis bespangled”; the trappings and fripperies of majesty are all there is. His “majestic figure” is only figure, in the archaic sense of external form or shape, without any underlying substance. By way of decomposition and analysis, the inquiry into “how much precise majesty” there is in the king’s “majestic figure” leaves Thackeray with the conclusion that “there is no majesty in him, at any rate.” But is this really “the exact calculation” of absolutism, as Thackeray implies? It is, but only after the fact, only after absolutism. What is missing is the idea—and more than the idea, the lived experience—of the incarnation of a divinely invested dignity in the king. Thackeray’s “exact calculation” is possible only after the loss of faith in a god whose ways were not so mysterious that absolutist theologians couldn’t identify his will and decipher his hand in history all the way up to Louis XIV. Therefore, while the Rigaud painting depicts what absolutism was, within the present of its existence, Thackeray’s drawing only shows what absolutism looked like in retrospect, from an external perspective, somewhere between them and us in time. It is my contention that much of the scholarship on absolutism remains within the mode of Thackeray’s “exact calculation,” viewing its object of study with a modern demystifying gaze, as if the decomposition that it performs and that the drawing illustrates so starkly were valid in Louis XIV’s time, as if this truly were all that absolutism was.7 Such an ap6. Thackeray, The Paris Sketch Book, 2:281–82. 7. For a similar argument regarding the modern scholarly approach to the Holy Roman Empire, see Stollberg-Rilinger, The Emperor’s Old Clothes, esp. the introduction.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nproach is exactly that: a calculation, and more precisely a calculation that cuts down any element to fit into its model and measurement. If majesty and royal dignity were nothing more than their external trappings, scholars could analyze the whole of absolutist culture in modern terms as an instrument of manipulation, as propaganda. But not so as long as the subjects (and the king) still believed in the divine investment in their king and kingdom; not so in a world where royal dignity was still perceived as a given—or more precisely, a pregiven—truth prior to any legitimizing act or calculation. This, then, is the exact nature of the contradiction central to the enterprise given flesh and form in Thackeray’s drawing: it is an attempt at calculating the truth of a time before calculation. The result is certainly a truth, but our truth, not their truth, about absolutism. A few precisions are in place at this point. I do not claim, of course, that calculations into the communicative effect of absolutist expressions were absent from the politics of a Colbert or any skillful operator of absolutist politics. On the contrary, they were all accomplished practitioners of the art of rhetoric and persuasion. Nor do I exclude the possibility that the analysis of specific practices or artifacts could fruitfully mobilize a framework relying on concepts like manipulation, instrumentalization, or even propaganda. I do claim, however, that by resorting to such a framework by default, we risk uncritically reiterating the reduction inherent in the concept of absolutism itself, without even considering whether our modern analytical categories are appropriate when making sense of absolutism’s premodern logic. As if expressions of absolutism could be nothing but mere propaganda. Such a reduction to propaganda is somewhat of an unquestioned commonplace in much of the current scholarship on the culture of absolutism, and this default is interrogated in the next section. There is, however, another layer to my argument about the problem with absolutism. I contend that when we let Thackeray’s “exact calculation” be our only guiding approach to absolutism, we avoid confronting something that perhaps makes us uncomfortable in its unruly excess, something awkwardly close to the pleasure or joy that propels the dream of absolutism. Yet grasping the “totality and coherence” of absolutism itself requires grappling with that excess and recognizing its alterity. Interestingly, this last perspective is very much present in the passage from Thackeray, which is in reality richer and less reductive than what a first reading might indicate. There is, in the quoted passage and in the essay to which it belongs, an exuberant fascination with all things related to the king and Versailles. Even while disparaging him, the text betrays a very detailed historical knowledge. “[F]or do we not all worship him,”\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\ndespite having performed “the exact calculation,” despite knowing the truth that his majesty is consubstantial with its trappings and “fripperies,” produced in its entirety by “barbers and cobblers”? “Yes,” Thackeray answers, thereby attesting to a continued effectiveness of absolutism after absolutism. It is as if Thackeray were writing—and drawing—to convince himself of what his reason knows very well, but that his heart refuses to accept. Here is the dream of absolutism: “in our hearts, a grand image of him, endowed with wit, magnanimity, valour, and enormous heroical stature.” Approached this way, the passage from Thackeray invites the reader to reflect on this post-absolutist admiration and worship of absolutism, then and now, as well as on the nature of the compulsion to give in to it (“worship and admire him we must”; my emphasis). A compulsion that, despite the author’s demystifying calculation, brings us full circle from the critical “no majesty in him, at any rate” (Thackeray’s emphasis) back to the final “grand image of him” (my emphasis) “in our hearts,” an image that, importantly, we ourselves “have set up.” Although the materials analyzed here all date from the reign of Louis XIV (with one notable exception), this book aims nonetheless to extend a similar invitation to the reader to reflect on the post-absolutist afterlife of the dream of absolutism.\n\n2. Beyond Mere Propaganda What does it mean to approach a cultural artifact celebrating the glory of Louis XIV in terms of propaganda? Propaganda certainly is glorification; so why shouldn’t glorification be considered propaganda? While circumspect scholars of an earlier generation have voiced their hesitations and qualms in regard to its applicability, the term seems to have imposed itself as a natural part of the current critical vocabulary, in no need of any provisos or reservations. Already in 2000, Pierre Zoberman observed in regards to the age of Louis XIV that “[c]onfronted with the elaboration of a positive image of the King and Monarchy, and with a program for the inscription and diffusion of such an image, the period’s historians [i.e., the present-day historians of the period]—whether they concentrate on the Monarchy itself, on mentalities, or on literature—routinely identify this process as propaganda.”8 While the adverb “routinely” is used by the author to stress this identification as something that happens “regularly” or “typically,” the routine qualification is nonetheless already marked in the more precise sense of happening “without proper thought” or “unthink-\n\n8. Zoberman, “Eloquence and Ideology,” 303.\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\n9\n\ningly,” as the OED explains. Today, “propaganda” functions as a critical shorthand, useful because of its seeming clarity and self-evidence. The category is seldom central enough to be thematized or reflected upon. Instead it tends to appear as part of assertive qualifications and striking formulations made in passing, and even more often in blurbs, introductions, conclusions, or section titles. The term’s trenchant and pugnacious qualities make it particularly effective for programmatic statements. It is a critical shorthand that will lend a critical edge to a critical juncture. But exactly because of that, it also risks saying more and doing more than what is immediately obvious. Notice the slight unease in the following observation by Ellen Welch at a crucial point of her magisterial 2017 inquiry into the intersection of performance and diplomacy in seventeenthcentury France: “In describing the form and content of these entertainments of the height of Louis XIV’s reign, it is difficult to avoid painting them as displays of force and pieces of effective propaganda.”10 Although Welch’s subtle analysis questions the effectiveness of these performances, and at times is close to inquiring whether effectiveness was their purpose in the first place (at least in the current sense of the term), the language of propaganda seems to impose itself, malgré elle. It is as if the notion itself exerts the force that it pinpoints.11 It is against the background of this self-producing force in the concept’s routine applications that it becomes important to take a step back and interrogate the meaning of the gesture of labeling something as propaganda.12 9. All these synonyms are taken from OED, “routinely.” 10. Welch, A Theater of Diplomacy, 148; my emphasis. The example quoted above is one of at least three occasions where Welch registers unease with the “traditional characterization [of practices like these] as propaganda” (85 and 106; 106 for the quotation). 11. This sense of the category of propaganda imposing itself is confirmed by a quick consultation of a select corpus of important books exploring the culture of absolutism published during the last decade or two. In none of these books is the notion of propaganda in any way close to the central argument being made, but the survey still reveals a diffuse yet rather uniform presence of an unquestioned use of the term. Indeed, it is my contention that it is difficult today to write about cultural expressions of absolutism at any length without at some point making the appeal to propaganda. 12. This paragraph has been sharpened by the many stimulating insights in Evonne Levy’s reflection on the function of labeling something as propaganda in art history, in the introduction to Propaganda and the Jesuit Baroque, 7–10. Otherwise, the project of Levy’s book is in many ways the opposite of mine here: a valiant attempt at “mak[ing] propaganda a productive and appropriate tool of art historical analysis” (12), while I seek to demonstrate that the routinely deployed notion of propaganda is an unproductive and inappropriate tool for the material I will look at.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the context of absolutism, qualifying an artifact as “propaganda” in an open, unqualified sense—which normally means as “mere propaganda,” “nothing but propaganda”—implies diverting the critical attention away from the artistic object in front of us toward the message it is carries: a message that is considered clear-cut and unambiguous, preexisting the artifact. In other words, it is a way of indicating that the signifier and the signifying gesture that brings it about can both safely be ignored in favor of the pregiven signified. Eminently expected, the message conveyed by the propagandistic object can, by definition, never surprise the modern scholar. It is always a repetition or confirmation of a predetermined meaning. Using the label of propaganda is therefore a way of, if not a cue for, closing down the inquiry. It implies the tacit permission to put the artifact safely away, discreetly indicating that it is time to move on to something more worthy of our critical energy. It is always the last word about the artifact, rarely the beginning of a further discussion, and even less the subject of a detailed analysis. As such, it is the not exactly analytical category for that which does not need analysis. Although much of the scholarship on the cultural production under Louis XIV’s personal rule in the past two decades has deployed propaganda as a ready-at-hand, unanalyzed critical term, it wasn’t always this way. In preparing the ground for moving beyond the paradigm of propaganda, it is therefore worth attending to the reservations and hesitations of an earlier generation of scholars. The two English-language classics in the field are both interesting for the way in which they betray an attraction to the potency of the concept while also marking a critical distance. Orest Ranum’s monumental study of the career of five different writers who toiled for the seventeenth-century Bourbon kings in Artisans of Glory (1980) is particularly important in this regard. Writing in the years following the publication of two more pointed examinations of French absolutist culture in terms of royal propaganda, the concept is certainly on his radar.13 The fullest formulation of his book’s project immediately follows an initial observation regarding the trivial results that an analysis guided by the notion of propaganda will often lead to when applied to a corpus like his: Very quickly we realize the impossibility of deciding what is propagandistic and what is not, unless it is possible to discern the conscious acts of a 13. See Solomon, Public Welfare, Science, and Propaganda; and Klaits, Printed Propaganda; both referred to by Ranum, Artisans of Glory, 253n61, and 294 and 315, respectively.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nwriter who knew he was publishing a work intended to influence public opinion in an ideological way. Instead of taking this approach, I hope to capture the feelings and expressions of dependency among writers.14\n\nThroughout his book, the notion of propaganda occasionally reappears in the discussion of certain aspects of the dependency of the writers in question.15 But so, too, do Ranum’s reservations as to the pertinence of the category widely construed, especially regarding the contributions by Paul Pellisson, Jean Racine, and Nicolas Boileau to the history of Louis XIV.16 There is thus a deep ambivalence running through the text, since it is not at all obvious that the instances of a more specific analytical use of the term would withstand the broader critique voiced elsewhere. Ranum’s methodological qualms and reservations only take on their full meaning when approached in light of the striking endpoint of his own inquiry, which runs as follows: The inflated claims by the men of letters may not have seemed so inflated during the long reign of Louis XIV, for they restated French family history in ways that obliged the monarch to carry out politics he could never empirically examine. There was literally no language or conception of kingship or of the state beyond those webs of myths and facts spun by writers, webs that bound the prince to the pursuit of gloire.17\n\nWhat looks inflated to us may not have been perceived as such at the time. In a certain sense, this is of course just another reminder of the danger of 14. Ranum, Artisans of Glory, 22–23. 15. See, for example, Ranum, 149, 253, 260–64, 270, 294. 16. Regarding the case of Pellisson: “It is anachronistic to refer to this literature [the writing of history to the glory of the king]—when its principal subject is the head of state—as propaganda. As a descriptive term, ‘propaganda’ does not help to define the nature of either historical or other literary genres in the reign of Louis XIV; for in a sense fidélités—royal, aristocratic, and parlementaire—encompassed virtually all literary activity.” Ranum, 252. And more hard-hitting still, regarding the charges of propaganda and naïveté from modern readers of Racine: “Propaganda his history is, but only in the sense that it conformed to the dominant beliefs and aspirations of the political culture of which he was part. By standing for the principle of recording only the truth, Racine and Boileau sincerely hoped to curb the excessive praise that writers were heaping on the Sun King. Their results, with all the restraints imposed by the ars historica, would have been no more and no less propagandistic than histories written by others whose political cultures sustained ideological perspectives on the past.” Ranum, 315. 17. Ranum, 337.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nanachronism: we cannot necessarily trust the pertinence of our own precritical affective reaction to the material at hand from where the charge of propaganda first emerges.18 But it is only now, at the end of the journey, that the reader fully realizes the extent to which the title of the book, Artisans of Glory, points from the outset to something empirically more elusive than what notions such as propaganda can possibly seize. Other tools are needed in order to even start analyzing the stakes of the “webs of myths and facts” structuring the symbolic reality and aspirations of prince and writers alike. In his seminal study The Fabrication of Louis XIV (1992), Peter Burke shares with Ranum the explicit methodological ambivalence toward the concept of propaganda. The concept first occurs in a wider discussion of the dangers and benefits of anachronism, when Burke states that “[a]nother modern way of describing this book would be to call it a study of ‘propaganda’ for Louis XIV.” However, although Burke stresses that “[i]f the term propaganda is defined broadly enough, for example as ‘the attempt to transmit social and political values,’ it is difficult to object to its use about the seventeenth century,” he is quick to stress the risk that such a use can lead to reductionism by “encouraging author [Burke himself] and readers alike to interpret the poems, paintings and statues representing the king as if they were nothing but attempts to persuade.” Although Burke concludes that “ ‘[p]ropaganda’ is one useful modern concept [among] others,” he largely refrains from using it in the rest of the book, adding in his introductory discussion that “[i]t might be more exact to say that the representations of Louis were commissioned to add to his glory.”19 This last remark, reminiscent of Ranum’s work, seems to have inspired the choice of title for the 1995 French translation of Burke’s book: Louis XIV: Les stratégies de la gloire (Louis XIV: the strategies of glory).20 However, unlike Ranum, Burke in the end opts resolutely and un18. In Ranum’s stark formulation: “our own repugnance for Ludovician political culture” (24). 19. Burke, The Fabrication of Louis XIV, 4–6. 20. Burke, Louis XIV: Les stratégies de la gloire. In the 2010 Festschrift for Burke, Nicole Hochner criticizes the title of the French translation in the following way: “The book in French surprisingly became Louis XIV: les stratégies de la gloire, wrongly alluding to a warlike tactic of glory and pomp, concealing the fact that Peter Burke had made only a limited case for propaganda.” Hochner, “Against Propaganda,” 235. This characterization is based on a surprising conflation of glory and propaganda, which is not reflected in Burke’s book. Hochner goes on to comment on “the very different connotations of the two titles: the English suggests a process of making, while the French evokes more a propaganda device” (235n22). However, it could be argued that the change of semantic field from fabrication to glory rather brings the\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\napologetically for an anachronistic approach. He distinguishes between two rival models in the approach to rulers and their images: on the one hand, what he calls a “cynical” view (whose demystifying gaze identifies instrumentalism and manipulation, but at the risk of reductionism), and, on the other, an “innocent” view (taking the royal image seriously at its face value, but at the risk of suppressing actual manipulation, instrumentalism, and dissent).21 Could there possibly be a third way that would resolve the tensions and oppositions between these two models toward a productive synthesis? Yes, Burke seems to imply, through an approach like the one he is adapting in his book: The king and his advisers were well aware of the methods by which people can be manipulated by symbols. After all, most of them had been trained in the art of rhetoric. However, the aims in the service of which they manipulated others were of course chosen from the repertoire offered by the culture of their time. The aims as well as the methods are part of history, and part of the story told in this book.22\n\nTheir aims and their methods were certainly part of history, but Burke’s own aims and methods were not. With the final programmatic statement of his introduction, Burke aligns himself with “the analysts of communication in our time,” marking as his goal “the attempt to discover who was saying what about Louis to whom, through what channels and codes, in what settings, with what intentions, and with what effects.”23 Therefore, it is not immediately clear how this approach is different from the “cynical” view evoked by Burke himself, except that the execution of the study of manipulation here is carefully, comprehensively, and masterfully historicized. Unlike Ranum, Burke’s choice of title firmly situates the book within the cynical paradigm. It is true that Burke tries to have it both ways in the introduction, by insisting that the word “fabrication” is meant to point to the processual character of image-making across time and media. Yet the need to disclaim other interpretations of the title before making this statement suggests that the natural way to understand it might be different: the word “fabrication” was chosen not “to deconstruct or demolish the king” nor “to imply that Louis was artificial while other people are title further away from propaganda, as suggested, for example, by Ranum’s analyses in The Artisans of Glory. 21. Burke, The Fabrication of Louis XIV, 11–13. 22. Burke, 13. 23. Burke, 13.\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\n24\n\nnatural.” However, the book tells a slightly different story, starting well before the disclaimers in the introduction. Just after the title page and dedication, on the left page opposite (hence before) the table of contents, the reader encounters Thackeray’s drawing discussed above. It appears above the following truncated quotation from Thackeray’s text, which takes on the function of a caption: “You see, at once, that majesty is made out of the wig, the high-heeled shoes, and cloak . . . Thus do barbers and cobblers make the gods that we worship.” Burke never comments upon this visual and verbal deconstruction of the king, with a function halfway between frontispiece and epigraph, in the main body of the text, despite a second full-page inclusion of the drawing halfway through the book.25 This is not exactly an omission, since in a certain sense the whole book is a comment on and a working out of what Thackeray called “the exact calculation” of absolutism. At the very least, such is the impact it has had on a generation or two of scholars for whom it has been and still is the main introduction into the making of the image of Louis XIV. Within this framework, the output from the royal image-makers is nothing but communication, nothing but persuasion, nothing but propaganda. What precedes is in no way meant to detract from the synthetic force of the exposition nor from the immense richness of the materials analyzed by Burke. The Fabrication of Louis XIV certainly is a summa and a most influential work in the field. Rather, my point here has been to bring attention to the largely unnoticed way in which this force has itself contributed in shaping the field in the following decades through its framework and approach. In many contexts, Burke’s unquestioned reliance on the communication model does not make much of a difference, while in some cases the cynical view is certainly warranted and serves to sharpen the analysis. At other points, however, it leads to a slippage, a lack of nuance, to interpretive possibilities being excluded without consideration. Here is one example of such a blind spot from the very last paragraph of the book: “Louis claimed to derive his power from God, not from the people.”26 Is Burke’s claim about this being Louis’s own claim as unproblematic as this sentence makes it seem? Indeed, doesn’t the word “claim” shift the source of Louis’s authority from the realm of self-evidence to the realm of persuasion?27 24. Burke, 10–11. 25. Namely, Burke, 124, opposite the first page of chapter 9, “The Crisis of Representation.” 26. Burke, 203. 27. For a second example of such a blind spot, see the following slippage in a programmatic paragraph from chapter 2, titled “Persuasion”: “As for the function of the image [of the king], . . . the aim was to celebrate Louis, to glorify him, in other words\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nBut what more, what else could there possibly be? What is it that we do not see when we only see propaganda and persuasion? What is it that may be lost by automatically characterizing the cultural expressions of absolutism as propaganda or even as modern political communication? To begin answering these questions, I make a quick detour by way of methodological discussions related to the celebration of power in imperial Rome. The prominent French historian of ancient Rome, Paul Veyne, draws attention to the way in which Trajan’s Column in Rome poses a radical challenge to the communication model: modern scholars had long interpreted its famous spiral bas-relief, commemorating Trajan’s victory in the Dacian Wars, as imperial propaganda, in spite of being for the greater part invisible from the ground. How to make sense of a message without an actual audience? The reason for this radical indifference to the legibility of the monument is simple, Veyne explains, once we liberate ourselves from the blinders of the communication model: “the column is an expression of imperial pomp and not a piece of propagandistic information communicated to the spectator.”28 The same holds for premodern mobilizations of the arts for the celebration of monarchic glory all the way to Versailles, Veyne adds in the following sweeping statement: The cult, the incense, the “flattery” that surrounded Elizabeth I or Louis XIV officiated the celebration of their glory [célébraient l’office de leur gloire] without serving to place them on the throne; the palace of Versailles may have made Louis XIV a greater king than the others, but it could not make him more of a king: if it can be said, he was king “always already.”29\n\nThrough this “always already,” the king’s dignity is never in doubt or at stake: “Pomp is an expression of self that does not seek to make an to persuade viewers, listeners and readers of his greatness.” Burke, 19; my emphasis. Does the reduction of glorification to persuasion go without saying? 28. “[L]a colonne est une expression de faste impérial et non une information de propagande communiquée au spectateur.” Veyne, “Buts de l’art, propagande et faste monarchique,” 389. Burke alludes to an early version of Veyne’s argument in The Fabrication of Louis XIV: “As the ancient historian Paul Veyne recently suggested, some works of art are created to exist rather than to be seen. The reliefs on Trajan’s Column, for example, are invisible from the ground” (5). 29. “Le culte, l’encens, la ‘flatterie’ qui entouraient Élisabeth d’Angleterre ou Louis XIV célébraient l’office de leur gloire et ne se proposaient pas de les installer sur le trône; le château de Versailles pourra faire de Louis XIV un roi plus grand que les autres, mais non pas le rendre plus roi: il l’était, si l’on peut dire, ‘toujours déjà.’ ” Veyne, “Buts de l’art, propagande et faste monarchique,” 412.\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nimpression and that, precisely because of this, makes one, appearing to be a product of royal nature, indifferent, like nature, to the existence of spectators.”30 Such a gesture can of course still be considered as communication, and nothing stops a modern observer from trying to nail down a message. However, the nature of what is communicated refuses to enter into the framework of the modern “analysts of communication,” as invoked by Burke. In effect, what is communicated is in part this refusal itself: a communication that doesn’t care about its immediate recipient, a message that declares loudly but without a precise audience in mind, “Because I can.” Two recent revisionary monographs confirm in unexpected ways the pertinence of Veyne’s insight for the monarchical culture of seventeenthcentury France. Both explore the notion of “visual history” but are otherwise extremely different both in approach and scope. On the one hand, Robert Wellington’s Antiquarianism and the Visual Histories of Louis XIV (2015) is itself an antiquarian inquiry without any pretension to challenge the way we think about the political dimension of absolutism.31 Nevertheless it does exactly that through the compelling case it makes for the “visual histories” produced by Louis XIV’s image-makers as being intended not for a contemporary audience but for posterity. These objects are “artifacts for a future past,” as the subtitle of the book puts it. It is not that the production of the king’s visual history was not part of a tightly supervised plan, coordinated by Jean-Baptiste Colbert and the Petite Académie; it was, but in a very different way than what our modern tools and categories allow us to seize. On the other hand, in the supremely ambitious Les rois imaginaires (2016), Yann Lignereux pursues the role of the imaginary as a constitutive dimension of monarchical French politics from the late fifteenth century through the reign of Louis XIV. In the final synthesizing chapter, the diachronic analysis brings Lignereux to a conclusion along the lines of Wellington’s: “The first and true audience of the royal imaginary is posterity.”32 Importantly, however, this is not Lignereux’s final word. Rather, it is the point where he radically 30. “Le faste est une expression de soi qui ne cherche pas à faire de l’effet et qui, précisément pour cela, en fait, parce qu’il semble être une production de la nature royale, indifférente, comme l’est la nature, à l’existence de spectateurs.” Veyne, 413. 31. “This study looks beyond a self-evident political reading of the iconography of Louis XIV to discover an artistic process deeply entrenched in a sophisticated intellectual and connoisseurial culture.” Wellington, Antiquarianism, 4. 32. “Le premier et le véritable public de l’imaginaire royal, c’est la postérité.” Lignereux, Les rois imaginaires, 293.\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nexpands, if not explodes, the framework by reawakening the question of audience in Veyne’s reflection while replacing the latter’s main point of reference in Trajan’s Column in second-century imperial Rome with an underestimated monument of French absolutism itself. Located at the Cordouan plateau four miles into the sea off the mouth of the Gironde estuary, just north of Bordeaux, the Cordouan Lighthouse was built in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century on the order of Henri III and Henri IV, then carefully maintained through the reigns of Louis XIII and Louis XIV (fig. 3). It is a richly ornamented edifice that in its original design stood nearly forty meters tall, with exterior circular galleries, a sculpted front, and a monumental entrance leading into a lavishly decorated interior, with an “apartment of the king” on the first floor and a vaulted chapel on the second, above which the lighthouse proper sat.33 Although no French king ever visited the lighthouse, the edifice is a celebration of royal glory, as is legible in the decorative program, from the omnipresence of royal emblems, monograms, and initials to the sculptures of Louis XIV and Louis XV. It was at once a “wonder of the world” and a “monarchical monument.”34 But—and this is the exact place of Lignereux’s intervention—for whom? Who is saying what to whom by way of this monarchical monument whose exterior is inaccessible and whose interior is entirely invisible, to say nothing of the symbolic message inscribed in its details? One could certainly try to make the case that this is a magnificent piece of royal propaganda, expertly diffused by engravings like the one reproduced in figure 3, but only to be left wondering about its rhetorical efficacy. As Lignereux points out, these images “shut the public out from the splendor of its sacrosanct.”35 Sometimes called the “Versailles of the seas,” the Cordouan Lighthouse still stands today, less out of sight and reach to us thanks to modern technology than it was back then, and so all the more present as a monumental reminder of the limitations of our modern methods for thinking about royal monuments of the past. 33. This description follows closely the one given by Lignereux (294–96). See also the references given in the next footnote. Most of the structure described here still stands today, but the part above the chapel was radically expanded in the late eighteenth century so that the edifice now measures sixty meters. The lighthouse is still in operation, fully automatized since 2006. For further information and sources, see also the official website of the lighthouse: https://www.phare-de-cordouan.fr. 34.

In the original etymological meaning of the term as “that which should be propagated,” the emphasis remains, importantly, on the entity that is to be propagated, broadcast, diffused, expressed—and not yet on the recipient. But this\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nis not to say that the modern meaning of persuasion and even manipulation is not latent, especially since the term emerged in the very precise institutional setting of the Catholic Counter-Reformation.36 This more neutral use of the term is still possible today, with an emphasis on the propagating mission as an obligation toward the entity in need of propagation: in the original use, the Christian faith; in the absolutist context, the glory of the king. However, as I have shown, the word resonates today so strongly with the instrumental focus on manipulative impact alone that such a rehabilitated notion would hardly be an adequate conceptual tool. Hence the need to move beyond the traditional framework of propaganda, which can now no longer be more than mere propaganda.\n\n3. Approaching Absolutism Differently: Royal Glory and Royal Exemplarity How to home in on the dream of absolutism, then? How to approach the most extravagant artifacts of absolutism in a less reductive manner than what an approach in terms of propaganda or any modern communication model would entail? How might these artifacts be taken up in a way that allows us to get at the “totality and coherence” of absolutism (per Fanny Cosandey and Robert Descimon)? Indeed, how to start accounting for the force and efficacy of the dream of absolutism, not only in its time but long after it? The analyses in this book rely on the recuperation of the premodern categories of “royal glory” and “royal exemplarity.” Although both these expressions make intuitive sense at a surface level, the conceptual work they refer to may be less than obvious, even to seasoned students of early modernity, due to a systematic neglect in the scholarship. The reason for this scholarly disregard is related to the discussion above. Modern scholars have ignored them for the same reason as the corpus I am studying here, in which they feature prominently: an uncomfortable whiff (to a 36. The modern word has its faraway origin in the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, founded in 1622 by Pope Gregory XV in the context of the Catholic Counter-Reformation and often known quite simply as Propaganda Fide (from the Latin title: Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide). The term wasn’t politicized in the precise technical sense of manipulation until the French Revolution. Therefore, it should not be surprising to find the term used by Voltaire in its original meaning of “toute institution qui a pour but la propagation d’une croyance religieuse” (every institution which has as its purpose the propagation of a religious belief).

And yet, if we modern readers look more closely, as I will in what follows, it becomes obvious as we move beyond the framework of mere propaganda that royal glory and royal exemplarity are of paramount importance in understanding the dynamics of symbolic authority at work in the wider culture. They are central categories in the cultural practices undergirding the strict verticality of the absolutist society’s symbolic hierarchy, contributing decisively in the processes that make power real in the person of the king. In short, they are the stuff of which the dream of absolutism is made. I will tease out the exact function and working of the two categories in the course of the chapters through close scrutiny of central absolutist artifacts across different media. But before turning to the analysis, it is necessary to prepare the ground by introducing the two categories in some depth. In the case of royal exemplarity, this is essential since the concept may seem somewhat abstract and technical at the outset. As for royal glory, the situation is, in a certain sense, the opposite. It seems to speak with a self-evidence fueled by the pomp and splendor of Versailles, but it is in reality a complex and multilayered concept. Although the two categories are not exactly overlapping, they converge incessantly in the material studied here in the exuberant celebration of the glorious royal exemplar. In light of the discussion above, the notion of royal glory would seem like a promising place to start looking for alternatives to propaganda when discussing artifacts of absolutism. After all, the writers and artists whose work is analyzed in what follows were all “artisans of glory” in the way examined by Orest Ranum, and they were instrumental in redeploying “those webs of myths and facts [. . .] that bound the prince to the pursuit of gloire”37—webs of examples within a culture of exemplarity, as I shall soon return to. My starting point is a privileged testimony from Louis XIV himself about the extent to which the importance of this pursuit was on his mind from the early years of his personal reign. Here is his often-quoted statement to the members of the Petite Académie in charge of overseeing the production of the royal image across media: Vous pouvez, Messieurs, juger de l’estime que je fais de vous, puisque je vous confie la chose du monde qui m’est la plus précieuse, qui est ma gloire: je suis sûr que vous ferez des merveilles; je tâcherai de ma part de 37. Ranum, Artisans of Glory, 337, as discussed above, 13–14.\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nvous fournir de la matière qui mérite d’être mise en œuvre par des gens aussi habiles que vous êtes.38 (You may, Gentlemen, judge the appreciation I have for you, since I entrust you with the thing in the world which is the most precious to me, namely my glory. I am sure you will do marvels; I will try on my side to provide you with matter which deserves to be given form [mise en œuvre] by people as competent as you are.)\n\nThis assertion is important not only for its brazen expression of youthful confidence anticipating glorious exploits ahead of him, but also for the place accorded to the arts in this enterprise. In the dichotomy between form and content that the king suggests, there is an implicit promise about artistic glory to come for the academicians: by giving shape to his glorious exploits, they will achieve their own. It could therefore be tempting to read the statement as the recognition of a transactional interdependence; for all practical purposes, couldn’t the royal glory at stake here be reduced to the construction and propagation of reputation or renown? Nothing is less sure. Rather, one could wonder whether the brazenness of the royal utterance is carried by a sense of heaven-sent entitlement. “Ma gloire”: instead of reputation to be established or fabricated, this would be a preexisting glory to be made visible and given form, to be expressed, externalized, and confirmed by further glorious exploits. It is “the thing in the world which is the most precious to [him],” but that might be so precisely because it is not entirely of this world. The glorious matter to be provided by the king calls for the making of “marvels.” Although this marvel-making task—which is thus both the king’s and the artists’—is formulated in the future tense, the glory of the king exists here, now, in the promise (or the dream) of marvels to come. The scene is thus structurally similar to the one in the central painting in the Hall of Mirrors, evoked in the opening of the introduction, where the king is not looking out in the world but into himself, with a gaze that itself dreams the glorious dream of absolutism.39 The concept of royal glory needs to be front and center in any discussion of French absolutism’s self-image and processes of self-representation. It 38. The anecdote is reported by Charles Perrault in Mémoires, xxv–xxvi; my emphasis. The anecdote is quoted by Ranum, 279. 39. For a further discussion of this anecdote, see chapter 3, 184. It also occurs in passing in chapter 2, 129.\n\n24\n\nIntroduction\n\nis therefore not at all controversial to speak of the Petite Académie as a “ministry of glory,” although, importantly, this does not make it a “historical research team for political propaganda,” as Jacob Soll would have it.40 And yet, a synthetic work proposing a thorough exploration of the concept in the context of French absolutism still seems far away. Significant preparatory work has certainly already been done within more widely defined projects, most prominently by Robert Morrissey on the historical side and by Giorgio Agamben in political theology.41 Olivier Chaline also covers important ground in his landmark biography on Louis XIV (2005).42 It is a testimony to the difficulty and urgency of the task that the perspectives of Morrissey, Chaline, and Ranum, on the one hand, and of Agamben, on the other, seem incompatible, if not mutually exclusive. If analyzed at all, the early modern logic of royal glory is generally reduced to remnants of aristocratic notions of feudal honor or a nostalgic revival of a Roman culture of renown. The crucial theological impulse behind the pursuit of royal glory—which, as Agamben shows, is much more than (indeed, fully independent of) the moralist denunciation of vainglory—is still largely unaccounted for in the scholarship. My aim here is hardly one of filling this lacuna. However, the importance of the task and its first outline can be suggested already by a quick incursion into a key resource from late seventeenth-century France— namely, the rich and evocative article on the term in Antoine Furetière’s 1690 dictionary. According to Furetière, the first meaning of the word gloire is “Majesté de Dieu, la vue de sa puissance, de sa grandeur infinie” (God’s majesty, the sight of his power or infinite greatness).43 This is the theological concept of glory, from the Latin gloria, which itself is a translation of the ancient Greek doxa (and kabod in Hebrew). Notably, Furetière uses a political language here, with terms such as “majesty” and “power.” In the context of this discussion of royal glory specifically, I would like to insist on a layer of meaning in the Greek term that remains implicit in the Latin (and thus in the French and also the English) translation but is explicit in the German. The term Herrlichkeit’s root, hehr, evokes a general idea of highness but is at the same time closely linked 40. Chaline, Le règne de Louis XIV, 1:354; Soll, The Information Master, 128. 41. Morrissey, The Economy of Glory; Agamben, The Kingdom and the Glory. 42. Chaline, Le Règne de Louis XIV; the first volume of this two-volume work carries the subtitle Les rayons de la gloire (The rays of glory). See especially the sections “La gloire du roi” (The glory of the king) and “Les institutions de la gloire” (The institutions of glory) (156–77 and 354–87). See also by Chaline the important article “De la gloire” and the edited volume La gloire à l’époque moderne. 43. Furetière, Dictionaire universel, “gloire.”\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nto the two substantives Herr (master, lord) and Herrscher (sovereign), in such a way that (divine) glory literally evokes the manifestation of God’s absolute lordliness and sovereignty.44 In the second definition of the term gloire, Furetière evokes man’s duty to God: “gloire, se dit aussi de l’honneur qu’on rend à Dieu, des louanges qui lui sont dues.” (glory is also said about the honor one gives to God, the praise due to him.) This is glory as rendered to God by the faithful in adoration through an act of glorification. Again, the German term Verherrlichung serves to make explicit the vertical positioning of this activity: it necessarily happens from an inferior position. It is an act of subjection, the celebration of vertical inferiority. Furetière’s third definition finally reaches the human level and, as the last of a series of examples, royal glory: gloire, se dit par emprunt et par participation, de l’honneur mondain, de la louange qu’on donne au mérite, au savoir et à la vertu des hommes. La gloire du monde n’est qu’une fumée. Ce Triomphateur est revenu comblé, tout couvert de gloire. Cet ouvrage a acquis beaucoup de gloire à son Auteur. Ce Prince a tiré beaucoup de gloire de cette action de clémence, de justice.45 (glory is said, by borrowing and participation, about worldly honor, praise of the worth, knowledge and virtue of men. Worldly glory is only smoke. The Victor returned replete with, wholly covered in glory. This work has earned much glory for its Author. The Prince garnered much glory from this act of clemency and justice.)\n\nHere, the primary meaning of the word gloire is obviously very close to notions of honor, praise, renown, and reputation. This is certainly the case in the final example from the princely realm. The glory of this exemplary prince is attributed to his virtuous act and to the specific virtues it demonstrates (his clemency and justice). At the same time, the exact formulation of the sentence may appear perplexing in that it seems to invite a suspicion as to his motives. To a modern reader, the verbal locution “tirer gloire” already gives off a whiff of hypocrisy: there seems to be an indication of agency and intention that would risk turning a virtuous act into a mere superficial and virtuoso show of virtue. This would be Furetière’s fourth definition of gloire, which establishes the link to vain44. Schlüter, “Herrlichkeit. I,” 1079–80. 45. Furetière, Dictionaire universel, “gloire.”\n\n26\n\nIntroduction\n\nglory and boasting: “gloire, signifie quelquefois, Orgueil, présomption, bonne opinion qu’on a de soi-même. [. . .] On dit, qu’un homme fait gloire d’une chose, lorsqu’il s’en vante, qu’il s’en fait honneur.” (glory, meaning sometimes Vainglory, presumption, high self-regard. [. . .] One says that a man glorifies himself in a thing when he brags about it or honors himself with it.) However, at the time, “tirer gloire” still tended to qualify the objective outcome of an action rather than its intention. Therefore, the glorious act of the prince in the example is an objective reason for praise and even pride; it is exemplary not only in the trivial sense that it serves as an example in a dictionary, but also with the full moral weight of the term. That said, it should be added that the difference between the positive “tirer gloire de” and the negative “faire gloire de” from the fourth definition was subtle already at the time (while the reflexive form “se faire gloire de” didn’t appear until the twentieth century). Furthermore, the place of the princely example as the last element in the enumeration, and in that sense closer to the fourth definition than to the third that it serves to exemplify, seems to accentuate the slipperiness of judgment of his action. It is as if this example stages the ambiguity of worldly glory— and also, as I will soon return to, the ambiguity of princely exemplarity as such. The concept of worldly glory, as it is presented in the definition and examples from Furetière, may seem far removed from the theological sense given as the first meaning of the term. Indeed, there appears to be a rift in the French concept of gloire, harking back to a similar tension between theological and pre-Christian moralist layers of meaning in the Latin gloria, closer in meaning to the Latin notion of fama (itself closer in meaning to the Greek concept of kleos) than to the theological concept. Hence a tendency in the scholarship on early modern France in general and on absolutist culture in particular to ignore the theological layer of meaning all together and reduce the discussion of glory to a problem of heroic virtue and renown within—and more precisely, toward the peak of—a social hierarchy. This is certainly a rich and rewarding topic, as demonstrated most recently in Robert Morrissey’s magisterial exploration of the cultural and literary history of glory in the long eighteenth century, from Louis XIV to Napoleon, unearthing “the ‘economy of glory’ Napoleon sought to implement in an attempt to heal the divide between the Old Regime and the Revolution.”46 And yet, as Morrissey himself observes early in his inquiry in relation to Louis XIV, there is another conceptual layer beyond the tradition of glory as fama discussed in his 46. The quotation is from the dust jacket of Morrissey, The Economy of Glory.\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\nbook: “An essential element of this configuration [of court society]: the glory of the king of France is the reflection of that of God.”47 Furetière’s article on gloire announces this same ontological analogy in the concept of glory itself: human glory signifies “par emprunt et par participation” (by borrowing and participation) from the primary sense of divine glory, a theological Herrlichkeit that, as I just have shown, resonates with an otherworldly majesty, lordliness, and sovereignty. Glory as such is thus closely linked at once to the essence of God and the essence of kingship, first in its theological formulation, which is already political, and then a second time in the divine right invested in the French crown. It is therefore not surprising that the most exuberant and excessive celebrations of French absolutism under Louis XIV seem to be carried by a concept of royal glory that sits uneasy with the traditional framework of human glory understood as merely renown (fama), as will be shown repeatedly in the close analyses in this book. At this point, I would like to shift attention to an overlapping concept that better catches the participatory, collective aspect of absolutism and that is of crucial importance in understanding the continued fascination with the dream of absolutism even after absolutism. Again, my starting point is a privileged testimony attributed to the king himself, this time regarding the political importance of exemplarity under absolutism. The following remarkable passage appears in the Mémoires that Louis XIV (assisted by his ghostwriters) wrote for the instruction of his oldest son, the Dauphin, in a discussion of the political importance of the royal display of religious humility. It is thus the king who says “je” (I), and the possessive pronoun “notre” (our) that opens the quotation englobes himself and his son: Notre soumission pour lui [Dieu] est la règle et l’exemple de celle qui nous est due. Les armées, les conseils, toute l’industrie humaine seraient de faibles moyens pour nous maintenir sur le trône, si chacun y croyait avoir même droit que nous, et ne révérait pas une puissance supérieure, dont la nôtre est une partie. Les respects publics que nous rendons à cette\n\n47. Morrissey, 38. The theological perspective opened by this sentence is brought back to the ethical discussion of glory as a heroic ideal of virtue with the observation that this “vision was perfectly compatible with the ideal of the profane hero developed by the Catholic Reformation” (38). Such a delimitation makes sense within the project of Morrissey’s book, but it also leaves the question about the deeper politico-theological implications of the reflections of God’s glory on to the king’s largely unexplored.\n\n28\n\nIntroduction\n\npuissance invisible, pourraient enfin être nommés justement la première et la plus importante partie de notre politique, s’ils ne devaient avoir un motif plus noble et plus désintéressé. (Our submission to Him [God] is the rule and the example for that which is due to us. Armies, councils, all human industry would be feeble means for maintaining us on the throne if everyone believed he had as much right to it as we and did not revere a superior power, of which ours is a part. The public respects that we pay to this invisible power could indeed justly be considered the first and most important part of our entire politics if they did not require a more noble and more disinterested motive.)48\n\nThis paragraph and its context pose arguably the politically most complex yet most significant passage of the whole Mémoires and will be analyzed at length in chapter 1. The stakes of the lesson couldn’t be higher. As the royal father points out, the stability of the societal hierarchy hinges on the subjects’ belief in the king’s divine right to his position. Hence the urgency of the visible example of “submission” and “public respects” offered by the king and his son to a higher invisible power: it becomes exemplary of the submission to figures of authority in general. In this sense, exemplarity is “the first and most important part” of absolutist politics insofar as it is the principle that grounds and conserves orderly, hierarchical life in the polis. In other words, the main lesson from father to son is that the force of exemplarity is the glue that holds the ancien régime society together. The last sentence quoted betrays an unease with the seeming instrumentality in this example of religious humility. Isn’t the public royal submission recommended here itself close to propagandistic manipulation in its emphasis on royal self-interest? It is, but as will be demonstrated in the detailed analysis, the king himself here shows an acute awareness of the dangers of what modern readers would call a propagandistic approach and of anything close to Thackeray’s “exact calculation.” Somewhat surprisingly to a modern reader, according to the royal father, the crucial sincere bottom-up buy-in by the subjects seems to depend on the sincerity of the prior submission of the sovereign. Hence the necessity of\n\n48. Louis XIV, Mémoires, suivis de Manière de montrer les jardins, 104–5; Louis XIV, Mémoires for the Instruction of the Dauphin, 57.

It is important to stress that my emphasis on royal exemplarity in this book does not at all mean the introduction of a new concept. Rather, it is an attempt at recovering a way of thinking that was ubiquitous and unavoidable at the time but lost to us. According to John D. Lyons, the “period from the fifteenth through the early seventeenth centuries [merits] the appellation ‘the age of exemplarity.’ ”49 This is certainly true if one looks at elite culture and the ways in which ancient examples were at the heart of the humanist project as a source of political, ethical, and aesthetic models (in the mode of the Ciceronian historia magistra vitae). Lyons’s scholarship on the topic belongs to a first wave of research exploring early modern exemplarity that revealed the extent to which Renaissance texts by authors such as Montaigne, Erasmus, and Machiavelli not only belong to such a culture of exemplarity, but at the same time profoundly question it. Inside such a framework, the late Renaissance is marked by a “crisis of exemplarity,” most prominently voiced by Montaigne, and the end of the period indicated by Lyons coincides with René Descartes’s radical rejection of ancient books and examples in Discours de la méthode. This model of crisis, however, neglects to note the continued centrality of exemplarity for absolutist political culture of the late seventeenth century. Absolutist culture under Louis XIV was incontestably a culture of exemplarity in the sense that at once political, moral, and artistic choices were still largely justified through reference to the authority of concrete models from the past. Despite scholarly reports about an earlier “Renaissance crisis of exemplarity,” the example remained the crucial figure in the cultural construction of authority, the way in which the past is extended into the future through actions in the present. And within this broader culture of exemplarity, the glorious royal exemplar occupied a more central place than ever.50 In this light, it is not surprising that many of the most important cultural polemics of the age, known as Querelles, can in fact be viewed as 49. Lyons, Exemplum, 12. 50. For “the Renaissance crisis of exemplarity,” see the special issue of the Journal of History of Ideas with that title (59, no. 4), especially the introduction by Rigolot, but also important articles by Cornilliat, Hampton, Lyons, Stierle, and others. See also Hampton, Writing from History. For Descartes’s position, see Lyons’s subtle reading of the new exemplarity of the Discours in chapter 4 of Exemplum (156–70). See also the more recent collective volume Giavarini, Construire l’exemplarité. For the lack of emphasis on royal exemplarity within this rich body of scholarship, see my discussion below.\n\n30\n\nIntroduction\n\nbattles in an ongoing cultural war about the way in which exemplarity is constructed. This is the case for the Querelles on theater, monuments, inscriptions, and even the notorious polemics opposing Jesuits and Jansenists. And most of all, it was the case for the most notable one, the “Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes” (the Battle of the Books). Here, the point of contention was precisely the status of the ancient example, not only when it came to the choice of models for artistic creation, but also in terms of authority and legitimacy more broadly construed. Indeed, chapter 3 argues that what was at stake among the learned men of the French Academy and beyond can productively be approached as a polemics about how best to celebrate the royal glory of Louis XIV. I read the Querelle as a symptom of a wider cultural unease about exemplarity and argue that for the notion of a “crisis of exemplarity” to be fruitful, it needs to be recast as a crisis of royal exemplarity and studied in the most potent self-justifications of absolutism.51 These observations are all indications that the logic of exemplarity is under a certain pressure, with a constant need to be renegotiated. They do not mean, however, that the dominant role of exemplarity is diminishing or that the absolutist “siècle de Louis XIV” breaks with an exemplary culture. In a society more and more turned toward the example of the court, behavior and desires were increasingly modeled inside a rigorous hierarchy of curial exemplarity under labels such as etiquette, politeness, and civility. This brings me back to the above quotation from Louis XIV’s Mémoires and the position of the initial royal submission as at once the linchpin and the apex of exemplarity’s hierarchy. At this point, it is interesting to observe that the logic of exemplarity itself is in fact dependent on a similar structural elevation or exception as the one conserved through the royal example here. In an important sense, all exemplarity is royal, and the logic of exemplarity itself stands in a relation of solidarity with that of kingship. This solidarity between exemplarity and kingship can first of all be observed in treatises of rhetoric and logic, where the exemplarity of examples (what turns a sample into a model) is likened to the exemplarity of kings. The figure of the great king is omnipresent in theoretical de51. For the political implications of the “Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes,” see the chapter “Modernity and Monarchy,” in Norman, The Shock of the Ancient, 89–98. For the two other related Querelles, see, for example, Vuilleumier Laurens and Laurens, L’Âge de l’inscription; and Blanchard, “Ménestrier and the ‘Querelle des Monuments.’ ”\n\nIntroduction\n\n31\n\nscriptions of the rhetoric of example from Aristotle’s Rhetoric through Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole’s Logique de Port-Royal (1662) to Jacques Bénigne Bossuet’s Logique du Dauphin (1677). In both Aristotle and Bossuet, the king appears as the very first example of how reasoning through example works. Here is the example given by Bossuet after a short initial statement linking example to induction in moral matters, in a sentence that recalls the quotation from the Mémoires above: [A]insi, pour faire voir à quels désordres l’amour porte les hommes, on représente ce qu’il a fait faire à Samson, à David, à Salomon, comme il a pensé faire périr César dans Alexandrie, comme il a fait périr Antoine, et mille autres événements semblables.52 (Thus, in order to show the types of disorder to which love carries men, one represents what it made Samson, David, and Salomon do, how it nearly made Cesar perish in Alexandria, how it made Anthony perish, and a thousand other similar events.)\n\nThe same point could certainly have been conveyed through “mille autres événements semblables”—by a thousand other examples. And yet, the royal example still seems to stand out as more representative, not only for Bossuet, who here writes for the Dauphin, but also for ordinary people, as expressed through the use of the French impersonal subject pronoun “on”: one turns to Samson, David, and Salomon. Somehow, this series of royal examples seems to communicate more efficiently the general rule, which the reader is made to see (faire voir). Therefore, the choice of examples here undermines the conception that examples are mere induction. Rather, it would be tempting to speak of a certain solidarity between kingliness and exemplarity, both implying, as Alexander Gelley has said about the example, “the elevation of a singular to exemplary status.”53 It is as if the exemplarity of examples were most forcefully communicated by analogy with the exemplarity of the great king, just like in the political realm, where the elevation of the king above his subjects is most efficiently justified through exemplarity, as Louis XIV explained to his son. Whereas early modern exemplarity in general has given rise to an impressive body of scholarship in the last few decades,54 the question of royal exemplarity as such has remained virtually unexplored. While 52. Bossuet, Logique du Dauphin, 142. 53. Gelley, Unruly Examples, 2. See 32n55 for the relevance of this quotation. 54. By scholars such as Lyons, Hampton, Rigolot, and many others, cf. 29n50.\n\n32\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe scholarship just mentioned has been immensely helpful for a broad understanding of the early modern culture of exemplarity, the insights most important to understanding the logic of royal exemplarity can be found in a transhistorical analysis, namely, in Gelley’s introduction to a collective volume entitled Unruly Examples from the mid-1990s. Gelley’s decisive intervention consists in his distinction between two competing impulses in the workings of exemplarity: on the one hand, an Aristotelian impulse, a descriptive, “horizontal” understanding (example as sample or induction); and, on the other hand, a Platonic movement, which elevates a normative, “vertical” dimension (example as the exemplary status of an elevated entity). Gelley’s work does not address the political value of exemplarity as such, but to me it is obvious that in an early modern context these two impulses converge in the body of the royal exemplar.55 In other words, in my reading, the symbolic relationship between kingship and exemplarity maps onto the two impulses of exemplarity studied by Gelley. The king is an individual among many, who through his exemplarity appears as chosen, elevated, fated, in a way that erases the traces of contingency, the inductive and the empirical in this selection. The absolutist king is always already exemplary through his elevation. This means that the constructed nature of this royal exemplarity is invisible, unthinkable not only for the king’s subjects but also, crucially, for himself (as least as long as the new king follows the advice of his father, as discussed above and in more detail in chapter 1)—an important point that gets lost inside a modern framework where we consider the production of the royal image as nothing but propaganda and conscious manipulation. Through the power of example, the dignity of the king appears as given by nature, or even by God: an evident royal power, the rule of one, instituted by the One. Royal exemplarity is thus the process through which the sovereign naturally appears as the temporal incarnation of the eternal sovereign principle, or, expressed through the language of another passage from Louis XIV’s Mémoires to which I will return, as the living image of the almighty, in a way that leads his subjects to spontaneously express that “Le caractère de la divinité est empreint sur son visage, etc.” (“The character of 55. The juxtaposition of kingliness and exemplarity is thus mine; in its original context, the quotation from Gelley above only refers to the workings of exemplarity. The juxtaposition could easily be extended to the two sentences following the quotation: “Is the example [or the king] merely one—a singular, a fruit of circumstance—or the One—a paradigm, a paragon? The tactic of exemplarity [or kingliness] would seem to be to mingle the singular with the normative, to mark an instance as fated.” Gelley, Unruly Examples, 2; author’s emphasis.\n\nIntroduction\n\n33\n\ndivinity is stamped on his face, etc.”), as Blaise Pascal famously observed.56 And conversely, it is only when exemplarity is reduced to mere induction and representation, without carrying the imprint of divine choice and the aura given by fate—in other words, when the celebration of his royal glory appears as mere pomp and propaganda—that the contingency of the selection becomes visible as such. In this instance, and only in this instance, the subjects can see that the king (or the emperor) has no clothes, in the manner of Thackeray’s “exact calculation”: that he is a partly exemplary, partly non-exemplary human being like themselves. The French Revolution becomes conceivable once the king’s body loses its exemplary glory, once the character of divinity is no longer stamped on his face, and all of a sudden he is one body among many, as a sample or representative, but without the authority of his God-given elevation. Royal glory and royal exemplarity coincide in the celebration of the glorious royal exemplar and never have they coincided more perfectly than in the case of Louis XIV. But this is also the point where exemplarity threatens to break down. I already discussed how in Louis XIV’s Mémoires the example of royal submission to the divine was presented as a model for imitation. But what are we to make of depictions of the royal exemplar that are so glorious, so exemplary that he becomes inimitable and incomparable? In the corpus discussed in this book, there is a recurrent emphasis on—and a phantasmal pull toward—the point where the king takes the place of all other examples. Read in sequence, the three chapters trace a progression from center to periphery, from the sublime to the seemingly banal, in their examination of this absolutist obsession. In the first chapter, I analyze closely such a moment in the opening of the king’s own Mémoires, when he suggests to his son that his book might very well replace all other books in the Dauphin’s education. In the second chapter, I explore the choice of decorative program for the vault of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, when the plan to portray the king’s glorious exploits in the guise of Apollo or Hercules was replaced by a direct depiction of the king himself. In both cases, a direct and literal mirroring of the king in his own (textual or visual) portrait replaces the passage by the tradition of examples from the past (known as “mirrors for princes”). As I shall argue, this new pedagogical mirror structure is actually thematized 56. Pascal, Pensées, fragment 59. The italics are introduced by Pascal’s modern editor as a way of indicating the presence of a citation or quasi-citation. Pascal’s inclusion of the final “etc.” is significative, since it suggests that this specific utterance is only one of many similar examples.\n\n34\n\nIntroduction\n\nat the symbolic center of the Hall of Mirrors, in a surprising—and surprisingly understudied—mirror scene included in the depiction of the birth of absolutism in Le Roi gouverne par lui-même, 1661, first mentioned in the opening of this introduction. But it is in the seeming “absolutist absurdities” discussed in chapter 3 that this coincidence is explored the most forcefully. On the one hand, in Claude-Charles Guyonnet de Vertron’s 1685 Parallèle de Louis le Grand avec les princes qui ont été surnommés grands (Parallel between Louis the Great and the other princes who have been named great), whose curious conclusion runs as follows: “Louis resembles all the Great princes, although none of these Greats resemble him, because only he is similar to himself, and the Great prince par excellence.” On the other, in Jean de Préchac’s 1698 fairy tale “Sans Parangon” (“Without equal” or “Without example”), which recounts the life of Louis XIV very thinly veiled as that of Prince Sans Parangon, whose actions are dictated by increasingly difficult challenges from an invisible Princess Belle Gloire (Beautiful Glory). These texts may seem so exuberant as to be completely over-the-top, but in their very excess they provide a window to the inner workings of absolutism.\n\n4. The Dream of Absolutism So far in this introduction, the term “dream” has been used in a loose, intuitive, metaphorical sense. From the outset, the “dream of absolutism” points to a conception that is more capacious and supple than the modern scholarly concept of absolutism. The logic at work in the absolutist expressions analyzed here is dreamlike in that it seems to imply the dimming of certain rational exigencies and allows for the integration of contradictions. Or better, with a tiny twist on a well-known aphorism: like the heart in Pascal’s original coinage, the dream, too, has its reasons that reason doesn’t know.57 This rewriting is very much faithful to the meaning of the original, despite the rosy romantic connotations the latter may have for modern readers. Read in context, it is clear that Pascal posits the heart as the site of an extra-rational cognition operating according to a different logic and oriented by a higher principle of love, either divine love or self-love. In the present case, the dream is the site for a similarly larger extra-rational realignment; one where thought and feeling, reason and emotion square off differently; one where bodies move and are moved in a numinous setting, where strong visual manifestations impose 57. “Le cœur a ses raisons que la raison ne connaît point.” (“The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know.”) Pascal, Pensées, fragment 680.\n\nIntroduction\n\n35\n\nthemselves as if scripted from the outside and given from above; one where a space is opened for a phantasmagoric sense of truth outside any fixed experience of time. In this sense, the dream carries an extra-rational, premodern knowledge. The dream here stands for the other of demystification and of Thackeray’s “exact calculation”; the other of the modern reduction of absolutist artifacts to mere propaganda. At the same time, it is important to emphasize that the idea of absolute power is itself dreamlike. Only a dream?
