        "meta_description": "This chapter deals with the way the military occupations developed, from conquest to ideas of possible annexation. It explores how they relate to French strategy for the north-eastern and south-eastern frontiers during Louis XIV's personal reign. If in the second half of Louis XIV's personal rule France maintained some control over Lorraine without too much difficulty, the picture was far messier when it came to the lands of the duke of Savoy. After Nijmegen, French frontier strategy, as directed by Louvois and Vauban, centred on the creation of the pre carre, a more defensible geometric frontier marked by a more linear fortress barrier. The great defences created by Louvois and Vauban on the Lorraine frontier comprised Phalsbourg, Longwy and Sarrelouis, strengthened by the acquisition of Strasbourg in 1681 and Luxembourg in 1684.",
