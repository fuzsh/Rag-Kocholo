        "text": "George Harris\n\nGeorge Harris was born in Westminster in 1721. It seems that he spent part of his childhood in Wales with his father, John Harris, who was appointed bishop of Llandaff in 1729. Shortly before his father’s death, in June 1738, George was matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford. In 1745 he obtained the degree of Bachelor in Civil Law and five years later a doctoral degree. Later the same year, on 23 October, Harris was admitted to the College of Advocates, and he began a legal practice. During his long-term membership, he performed many administrative functions: register (1763–4), librarian (1765–6) and treasurer (1767–70; 1781–2). In addition, he was involved in the administrative and judicial organisation of many dioceses. It was noted in his obituary published in The Annual Register that Harris was chancellor of the dioceses of Durham, Hereford and Llandaff as well as the commissioner of Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey. This list can be supplemented with two more chancellorships in Bangor and Winchester. It seems that most of these appointments were held by Harris almost until his death.\n\nIt is possible to locate some traces of Harris’s practice as advocate. Archival investigation indicates the survival of several legal opinions presented by Harris. Most of them concern ecclesiastical matters, primarily regarding staffing of offices. Lambeth Palace Library possesses three such opinions dated 1770/1, 1784 and 1787. Another two opinions are held by the local archives in Yorkshire (1764) and Devon (1780).\n\nLike many other eighteenth-century civilians, Harris was also involved in judicial work. For many years he was a judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. Through the press testamentary reports, it is possible to see that Harris was performing judicial duties as early as March 1759, when he proved the will and codicils of Henry Hawley. He was still acting as a judge in 1790 when he proved the will of the well-known eccentric John Elwes.\n\nBesides the Prerogative Court, Harris was also acting as a judge while he was holding the diocesan offices. While he was a commissioner of Surrey, then part of the diocese of Winchester, Harris was engaged in an unusual case. At the time, the bishop of Winchester was visitor of Magdalen College, Oxford. He exercised his powers through the commissioner. In 1769 Harris was presiding over a hearing in a case regarding the deprivation of Ambrose Kent of his Doctor of Divinity degree and fellowship at Magdalen College. It seems that these hearings were partly informal since they were taking place in such different locations as Harris’s chambers, the common-hall of Doctors’ Commons and the bishop’s home in Chelsea.\n\nHarris’s judicial activity on behalf of the Winchester diocese was perpetuated by John Wentworth. By the end of the eighteenth century, this barrister and member of the Inner Temple published several volumes regarding judicial proceedings. The matters discussed were illustrated with actual examples from practice. During the analysis of the writ of prohibition, Wentworth included in his book a motion to grant a writ, the writ itself signed by George III, as well as Harris’s declaration of admitting the writ, all concerning the 1777 case.\n\nKent’s was not the only university case in which Harris was involved. In 1793 Jesus College, Cambridge sent a request to the civilian for an opinion regarding an appropriate interpretation of the College statute. The proceedings concern the publication of a treatise by William Frend entitled Peace and Union Recommended to the Associated Bodies of Republicans and Anti-Republicans. Although Harris was not called to appear in the Vice-Chancellor’s Court, his opinion was used during the hearing.\n\nAs a diocesan official, Harris was also acting widely as an administrator of different ecclesiastical legal matters. For example, as a commissary of Surrey, Harris was involved in the discussion regarding the dispute between the bishop of Winchester and the vicar general of the Province of Canterbury in issuing marriage licences (1765). At another point, Harris was presiding on behalf of the archbishop of Canterbury over proceedings regarding applications for medical licences.\n\nFurther, like many other civilians at the time, Harris did not limit his practice to ecclesiastical law. He was also an advocate in the Admiralty, where he gained an important position and held the post of Admiralty Advocate between 1764 and 1782.\n\nGeorge Harris was professionally active until his death. The archives of Lambeth Palace possess documentation of a 1795 case pending in the Arches – the provincial court of the archbishop of Canterbury – wherein Harris was acting on behalf of the diocese of Winchester. Harris died only a few months later, on 19 April 1796. He left a last will in which he disposed of his huge wealth. He established several trusts, including two major ones on behalf of two London hospitals – one worth £20,000, the other £15,000. This is, in fact, not surprising, since Harris was involved in charity work during his lifetime. He was a member of the Corporations of the Sons of Clergy, which financially supported poor ecclesiastics and their families.\n\nTranslation of the Institutes: Content\n\nHarris began his opus with an extensive dedicatory note addressed to Sir George Lee, then the dean of the Arches. In a typical panegyric manner, the civilian praised the merits of the judge for the development of English law as well as for his intellectual qualities. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Harris packed the note with all possible flattery. As an illustration, two passages can be quoted: ‘and, as I have the honor to attend those courts, in which you so eminently preside, I may hope to avail myself of the many opportunities of instruction, which must continually offer themselves’ and ‘the benefits, conferred by you, are not confined to individuals; your conduct as a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, and the satisfaction it gave the public, are sufficiently known’.\n\nIt seems that Harris here had a pragmatic purpose. Not only was George Lee, as the dean of the Arches, the presiding member of the College of Advocates, but he was also the head of the court before which the civilian appeared. It should not be ruled out that Harris’s actions were parts of his efforts to obtain a judgeship in the Arches. If this really was the case, it may be that these efforts were successful. The dedicatory note was signed by Harris on 25 February 1756. Less than three years later, in March 1759, the lawyer was already a surrogate-judge for the dean of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. It is true that at the time the Arches had a new dean, Sir Edward Simpson, but Lee had died only a few months earlier.\n\nAfter the dedication, Harris placed the advertisement, where he pointed out his main aims in preparing his translation. He emphasised that his work should be treated as an introduction to the Institutes’ edition and commentary written by Arnold Vinnius. The second paragraph of the advertisement contains a short explanation regarding the notes added by Harris to the translation. He pointed out that the majority of them concern English law. He admitted also that they were not perfect but added that they should arouse the curiosity of a ‘young reader’. He hoped that these notes could also rouse the desire of the readers to study more deeply their national law as well as the Civil law, described by Harris as ‘the Master-work of human policy’.\n\nFinally, the introductory part is crowned with the already-mentioned ‘A Brief Account of the Rise and Progress of the Roman Law’. Starting from the earliest stages of Roman legal history, Harris presented first the semi-legendary stories of the legislative activity of Romulus, a gathering of the leges regiae by Sextus Papirius and finally the exile of Tarquinius Priscus from Rome. In the opinion of Harris, the subsequent events that led to the creation of the republic were the times of ‘great incertainity in respect to law’. Arbitrary decisions of the magistrates brought widespread discontent among the people. As a consequence, the patricians succumbed to the plebeians and decided to appoint the ten men – decemviri – who would eventually propose a project to enact a law that would be partially based on Greek laws and partially on previous Roman laws. Next, Harris presented the circumstances that led to the appointment of another decemviri committee and to shape the final version of what would be known as the law of the Twelve Tables.\n\nThe story told by Harris is focused on the republican period. He noticed that shortly after the enactment of the lex duodecim tabularum, its provisions started to be changed due to their severity. In his opinion, the Senate was primarily responsible for these changes, as well as the plebeians who voted during their assemblies. It is curious, from a modern point of view, that he did not mention the role played by the far more important legislative body of the republican period, the popular assembly, and their statutes (leges). Instead, Harris pointed out the important role played by the learned jurists, by what he calls ‘auctoritas prudentum’. Harris went on to state that after the promulgation of the law of the Twelve Tables, the Roman system of actiones was constituted. At first, they were unknown to the public until Flavius made them public. Shortly thereafter, Sextus Aelius introduced a newer, much improved system of the legal actions.\n\nHarris then suddenly changed the course of his arguments to focus on the pretorian edict. He explained that although the edict lost its authority after the one-year term of office of the pretor, nevertheless ‘many of them were so truly valuable for their justice and equity, that they have been perpetuated as laws’.\n\nAfter these extended deliberations regarding the republican period, Harris dealt with the principate in just one paragraph. He declared that after the ‘re-establishment of monarchy’ by Augustus, the Roman law gained new types of sources – the imperial constitutions and the responses of the lawyers. The details regarding their issuing were, however, not interesting to him. Instead, he skipped about three-hundred years and proclaimed that at that time the number of the imperial constitutions was so great that it was necessary to codify them. He listed the names of the lawyers Gregorius and Hermogenes (sic), who compiled private collections of the constitutions during the reign of the emperor Constantine. Next, he emphasised, an official collection was promulgated on the command of Emperor Theodosius. Harris summed up this part of ‘A Brief Account’ by saying that all the foregoing attempts to fix the state of imperial legislation were imperfect. Due to this, the great work of Justinian’s codification was necessary.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, Harris presented the stages of the works of codification carried out by the forces appointed by the emperor. He mentioned that the laws created on behalf of the emperor should be unchangeable and that they should not be summarised or excerpted. In a separate paragraph, Harris pointed out that Justinian had continued his legislative efforts by issuing novels and edicts which were written in Greek rather than Latin. He explained that it was a consequence of the greater popularity of Greek language in the Eastern Empire. He finished these deliberations by mentioning the release of the Basilica.\n\nHarris devoted the last part of ‘A Brief Account’ to the problem of later knowledge of the codification in Western Europe. He explained that it was not commonly known in the former Western Empire, and after the Lombard invasion it was nearly forgotten. Both Code and Pandects were missing until their rediscovery in the twelfth century, respectively in Ravenna and Amalfi. Since that time, however, they have been a subject of constant studies.\n\nThere are no doubts that the history of Roman law and its sources presented by Harris is disputable, especially when compared with twenty-first-century knowledge of Roman legal science. Harris’s knowledge, especially about the archaic and pre-classical Roman law, is rather simplified and based more on conjectures and legends than scientific arrangements. Other matters, like the rediscovery of the Digest in Amalfi were still unverified. It is important to remember, however, that ‘A Brief Account’ was only a short introduction and should precede further reading of Vinnius’s commentary .\n\nAfter ‘A Brief Account’, the main section of Harris’s book starts: the translation equipped with numerous notes. His pattern is as follows: he first gives the original Latin text, followed by the English translation typed in italics. Where he believed it was necessary, he included a short commentary and the explanation of the pivotal terms at the end.\n\nOne of the characteristic features of Harris’s translation was his inclusion of a reference to the parallel segments in other parts of Justinian’s codification at the start of every title in the Institutes. For example, beneath the name of the first title of the first book of the Institutes (De iustitia et iure) Harris indicated the designation ‘D. 1 T. 1’ that redirects the reader to the first title of the first book of Justinian’s Digest, which bears the same name. In another place, beneath the eighteenth title of the second book of the Institutes (De inofficioso testamento) the translator indicated the parallel places both in the Digest and the Code. Such practice was characteristic for English civilian literature in the eighteenth century. It can be observed in various places throughout the century. Francis Dickins, the Regius Professor of Civil Law in Cambridge (1714–55) used it, for example, in his lecture notes. In the 1770s the same method was exploited by Samuel Hallifax in his textbook.\n\nAnother characteristic of Harris’s work was the addition of informal subtitles clarifying the content of the following segment of the Institutes. A good example is the already-mentioned title De inofficioso testamento. It was divided into the following subtitles: Ratio huius querelae (I. 2, 18, pr.); Qui de inofficioso agunt (I. 2, 18, 1); Qui alio iure veniunt, de inofficioso non agunt (I. 2, 18, 2); De eo, cui testator aliquid reliquit (I. 2, 18, 3); Si tutor, cui nihil a patre relictum, pupilli nomine legatum acceperit (I. 2, 18, 4); Si de inofficioso nomine pupilli agens succubuerit (I. 2, 18, 5); De quarta legitima partis (I. 2, 18, 6–7). Although the addition was unique in comparison with other civilian works of the epoch, it was not Harris’s independent idea. The names of the subtitles were borrowed from Vinnius’s commentary.\n\nThe publication of the English translation of Justinian’s Institutes was a very important event in the history of the English science of Roman Civil law. A crucial component of that translation was the notes. In fact, they were arguably the most significant element of the translation. Close analysis of them shows that Harris was a very well-read independent scholar who knew both older and more recent legal literature well. His reading was not restricted to Civil law. On the contrary, Harris also reveals extensive knowledge of the English legal system. It is noteworthy that the works to which Harris referred very often represented other disciplines and are a good manifestation of the lawyer’s comprehensive knowledge.\n\nThese legal sources are quoted by Harris on many different occasions. He had an extensive orientation in all parts of Justinian’s codification. In many notes it is possible to find direct references to parallel passages of the Digest, Code and Novels . Quite often he based his argumentation also on Theophilus’s Paraphrase. The Theodosian Code, by contrast, was used infrequently. Harris also quoted non-legal sources. Besides the Cicero orations, he also referred to Tacitus’s Annales, Suetonius and Aulus Gellius. Among the Greek authors, he used the works of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Herodotus, Plutarch and the Homeric epics.\n\nAs for the scholarly works, Harris referred to a great number of Roman Civil law authors who represent different traditions. It is possible to find in the notes citation of the following authors: Bartolus, Philibert Bugnyon, Diego de Covarrubias y Leyva, Cujacius (Cujas), Jean Domat (quoted both in the original version as well as in the English translation by William Strahan), Jean Doujat , Claude-Joseph de Ferrière, Simon van Groenewegen van der Made, Johann Friedrich Gronovius, Grotius, Heineccius, Joachim Hoppe, François Hotman, Gilles Ménage, Joachim Mynsinger von Frundeck, Matthew Wesenbeck and, naturally, Arnold Vinnius. In addition to these Continental scholars, Harris referred to only three English civilians, all of whom were living in the eighteenth century, namely Robert Eden, John Taylor and Thomas Wood.\n\nA separate group, much more interesting than the English civilians, is made up of writers on English law, whom he used extensively. This is a rather surprising occurrence, especially given that Harris had never been trained in Common law. It can be assumed, however, that he was quite well self-educated in this field of knowledge. Besides the oldest English legal treatises, i.e. Glanvill and Bracton, Harris referred also to another medieval text – Britton. The lawyers of later epochs cited by Harris are: Matthew Bacon, Thomas Blount, Edward Coke, John Cowell, Anthony Fitzherbert, John Fortescue, Matthew Hale, William Hawkins, Thomas Littleton, John Rastell, Thomas Smith, Christopher St German and Thomas Wood.\n\nHarris was also keen to refer to English ecclesiastical lawyers, including Edmund Gibson, John Godolphin and Henry Swinburne. In addition, in one of the notes, Harris referred to a work entitled Ordo iudiciorum but did not insert the name of the author. The context of Harris’s statement, however, suggests that he was referring to the work published in 1728 by Thomas Oughton. Pre-Reformation literature was not exploited by Harris, except that he referred three times to Gregory IX’s Liber extra. The ‘ecclesiastical’ context was strengthened by Harris referring to passages from the Bible as well as the theological literature. It is interesting that among that last type of references it is possible to find a citation of the Catholic theologian, Peter Faber, a Jesuit priest and the disciple of Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nAs to English law, it has to be emphasised that Harris devoted much of his attention to the problems of legislation and court practice. This last feature of the translation is especially fascinating. The oldest law reports quoted by Harris date back to the sixteenth century. These are the reports of the judge Sir James Dyer, those known as Keilway’s Reports as well as those of the lawyer Edmund Plowden. From the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries come another three law reports: Sir Edmund Anderson’s, Sir Edward Coke’s and Sir George Croke’s. The seventeenth century is represented by the reports by Thomas Hardres, Thomas Siderfin and John Vaughan and the collection known as Levine’s King’s Bench and Common Pleas Reports 1660–1697. The turn of the seventeenth and eighteenth century is represented by the reports series Modern Reports and the reports collected by William Salkeld, whilst the eighteenth century is witnessed by the reports authored by Sir Jeffrey Gilbert, Lord Raymond and Sir John Strange. The activity of the Chancery is attested by Harris through the quotation of four reports series: an anonymous A General Abridgement of Cases in Equity, Argued and Adjudged in the High Court of Chancery etc., the Chancery Cases and the Chancery Reports, as well as the reports of Thomas Vernon. The ecclesiastical judgments are quoted only once, when Harris referred to the reports collected by Edward Stillingfeet.\n\nQuite unique are the references to the experience of Scottish institutional writers – Sir George Mackenzie and Lord Stair. In both cases Harris referred to their Institutions. Also, in one place, it is possible to find a mention of Norman customs of the Channel Islands.\n\nObviously, Harris was also using some secondary, auxiliary literature. Among these works, it is worth mentioning the historical pieces Basil Kennett’s Antiquities of Rome and John Potter’s Archaeologia Greca or the Antiquities of Greece. Besides, Harris was using philosophical works, like Tetrachordon by John Milton and Montesquieu’s De l’esprit des lois. Among the dictionaries can be mentioned Thesaurus linguae latinae by Robert Estienne and Thesaurus eruditionis scholasticae by Basil Faber.\n\nFollowing the translation of the Institutes, Harris added a single supplement to his work. It was an English translation of the Novel 118, decreed by Justinian in 543. The imperial constitution was part of the famous changes that the emperor introduced in the field of the intestate succession. The reason for its attachment to the translation of the Institutes is not clear, as Harris did not explain his action in this regard. It seems natural, though, that the translation could have been dictated by practical reasons. After all, ecclesiastical courts – the domain of the civilians’ activity – were mainly preoccupied with testamentary inheritance cases. The Novel and its translation cover a little over ten pages. The text was presented in three ways. First, Harris presented the Greek version of the constitution. Second, the Latin translation of the constitution was added. Finally, beneath these two versions, an English translation was included.\n\nJust as with the Institutes, the lawyer equipped the Novel with extensive commentaries. The apparatus is varied again. Among the civilian works it is possible to find the two pieces already mentioned before – written by Domat and Ferrière. In addition, Harris also used two other civilian treatises authored by Petrus Gudelinus (Pierre Goudelin) and Johannes Voet. English law is again represented by Glanvill, Littleton and Coke, and in addition by the work on criminal law written by Sir Michael Foster. Finally, the law reports were used by Harris. Only the reports of Lord Raymond were reused. In addition, another three were used by Harris for the very first time: the reports prepared by Sir John Holt, Sir Bartholomew Shower and William Peere Williams.\n\nWhat were the origins of such a wealth of literature? The translation was published in 1756. Even, if it is assumed that this project was initiated by Harris while still at Oxford, the 1749 edition of the translation does not reveal much about Harris’s interest in constructing elaborate notes. It seems plausible that the notes were mostly already written after Harris’s graduation, while he was a member of the College of Advocates. Besides a private library which was definitely continually expanded by Harris, it is most likely that his main supplying source was the library of the Doctors’ Commons. This conclusion can be partially confirmed by juxtaposing the list of works used by Harris with the library catalogue of Doctors’ Commons published in 1818. Although not all the works to which he referred can be found in the catalogue, many of them were in the College’s possession. While he was living in London, it is possible that Harris also had access to Lambeth Palace Library as well as the libraries of the Inns of Court. Finally, it is plausible that he used bishops’ or cathedrals’ libraries while he was travelling around the country to fulfil his professional duties ."
