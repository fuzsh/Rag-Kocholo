        "text": "Category Archives: Abandoned\n\nAs somewhat of a connoisseur of Hidden London’s underground tours of abandoned London Underground stations, I’ve seen some excellent historical sites in my day. However, even I wasn’t prepared for the treasure trove of historical information and preservation that is London’s abandoned Down Street tube station. Down Street is possibly the best visit of what […]\n\nAfter 112 years of history and emotion, it’s time for myself and thousands of others to say goodbye to a beloved part of our lives. The Boleyn Ground, home to West Ham United, is being demolished for flats as part of West Ham’s upcoming move to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford. West Ham United originally […]\n\nLast September, as part of Open House London, a wonderful piece of London’s history was opened to the public – an abandoned Victorian subway that served as part of Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station in the area of South East London which is now commonly known as Crystal Palace. It’s a stunning time capsule of […]\n\nAs part of the Hidden London tours of wonderful abandoned stations around London, I was lucky enough to jump on one of the practice tours of the hidden and abandoned pieces of Charing Cross underground station. Most of Charing Cross is still in operation, but this tour into one of the most complex station assemblies […]\n\nThe High Line is New York’s latest architectural triumph; a formerly abandoned elevated railway from the 1930s which has been transformed into an excellent park in which visitors are able to travel over viaducts and rails that once were used to deliver goods to the city. The history of this abandoned railroad starts in the […]\n\nThe London Transport Museum are currently running a series of Hidden London excursions to abandoned sites on or near tube stations. Last weekend Mr. @enjoytheviewEU and I headed deep underground to visit the Clapham South Deep-Level Shelter. Below you’ll find the history of and images of this incredible abandoned site in London. The Tunnels and […]\n\nBanksy’s Dismaland has been the subject of much hype in the art world. It’s effectively an “anti-Disney” theme park in which themes of capitalism and ironic commentary on society run riot throughout a carefully curated selection of both gaudy and subtly clever artwork. This bleak theme park is perfectly situated in a derelict and abandoned […]\n\nThere’s a gem for travel geeks nestled deep in the hills of Los Angeles’s Griffith Park. Travel Town is a dedicated patch of land full to the gills with old train stock, engines, trolleys and other travel-related paraphernalia. It was founded in 1952 and has an impressive collection which is sure to delight kids and […]\n\nThe museum is cleverly housed in an abandoned subway station, Court Street. Court Street was originally opened in 1936 as part of the Independent Subway System, and served as a branch line or shuttle train to other nearby destinations. Low passenger numbers and a plethora of other stations to chose from led to the closure […]"
