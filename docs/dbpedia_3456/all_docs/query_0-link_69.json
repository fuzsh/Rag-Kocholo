        "text": "METROPOLITAN LINE WALK 11\n\nCHALFONT & LATIMER walk to CHESHAM\n\n2 1/2 hours\n\nThe train line opened originally as a suburban railway line in 1889. London Underground took over the line together with the whole Metropolitan network in 1933, which explains why the Underground runs in this case outside of London borders, Chesham being the station located furthest from London in the entire network.\n\nRouting note: This walk connects to walk 10 in Chalfont & Latimer.\n\nMy route uses unpaved public footpaths and is likely to be muddy after rain. The Chess Valley Walk and the different public footpaths are usually signposted but not in a reliable manner. I use primarily the route description given in the leaflet issued by the local authorities. It has also a schematic map to be found unter http://www.riverchessassociation.co.uk/chess-valley-walk.html\n\nPlease note that both stations on this walk are outside of normal London transport fare zones and that your travelcard might not be valid at these stations. Depending on where you start, you might want to check whether an Oyster card would be cheaper or not than a one-day travelcard valid for all zones.\n\nCHALFONT & LATIMER\n\nThe station opened together with the train line in 1889 and was originally called Chalfont Road. The present name was given in 1915. A junction towards Amersham was added in 1892. The Amersham line being also served by a long-distance railway, it soon became the main line while the Chesham branch was downgraded to a shuttle service. As this caused congestion issues, including with park & ride facilities, the two lines have been set back on an equal footing in 2010 and both have direct connections with London.\n\nThe station building is a very plain, low brick building like all stations on the 1889 line. It does have an awning, in this case supported by wooden posts that give it an appropriate, slightly rural look. The more interesting look is along the platforms with the valance supported by elaborate cast iron pillars, a design also used for the other stations on the line.\n\nThe following descriptions are taken from the leaflet mentioned above. I use a different script in order to make the source clear.\n\nFrom the station ticket hall, cross the access road and go down the steps opposite to Bedford Avenue. Turn left for around 100 metres and then first right up Chenies Avenue. At the junction with Elizabeth Avenue go straight across, walk all the way to the end and then take the path into the woods. Bear half right, cross over a bridleway and through a barrier. There are two paths ahead, take the left-hand one down to a wide track. Turn right and almost immediately left and follow this down to go through a gate. Turn left and follow the fence to a gate at the road. Cross it and go through the gate the other side. Cross the field, through the next gate and along the driveway. Go over the bridge and then follow the driveway uphill towards a lane. Near the top, turn left through a gate to join the main Chess Valley Walk.\n\nIf you are interested in a short detour, you can walk a few yards up the road to the church in order to look at Latimer before coming back.\n\nThe village is made up of a number of 17th and 18th Century houses around a village green.\n\nYou can also have a look inside the church if it is open; it is a 19th century neo-gothic structure with a few monuments due to the connection with the lords of the manor.\n\nLatimer House (Place) was built in 1863 after the original Elizabethan house was destroyed by fire. Once the seat of the Cavendish family, during World War 2 the house became an interrogation centre for senior prisoners of war , including Rudolf Hess. It is now the Latimer Place conference centre and hotel. Below the house is Latimer Park Farm which from the 1st Century was the site of a Roman farm villa.\n\nPass through the gates and walk past the front of Latimer Place. This section has the finest views of the whole walk. Go through the next gate and follow the path along the edge of the wood uphill around the top of the field. After about a third of a mile, as the path descends, look for a gate on the right. Go through, turn left and continue downhill to another gate at an entrance to a field. Cross that and, keeping to the right of the hedge, continue all the way to Blackwell Hall Lane. Bear left down the lane.\n\nBlackwell Hall: The site of the ancient manor of that name, the current house dates from the tudor period. From medieval times, the manor had its own corn mill the last of which was demolished around 1860.\n\nAfter a few paces turn right along the gravel driveway to Blackwell Lodge. Go around to the left and then ahead through a gate into a field. Continue in the same direction through three further gates to drop down to a bridleway. Turn left onto a busy road and then left along it past the recycling centre.\n\nTurn right into Holloway Lane. Where this bends left, bear half right along a track to the right of Watercress Cottage. After around 300 metres look for a possibly hidden metal gate on the right and take the path as it winds its way through an industrial site. Cross a metal bridge and turn immediately left to walk along the river bank to the site of Canons’ Mill.\n\nCanons’ Mill: This was the site of a Saxon corn mill, referred to in the Domesday Book. It was owned by the canons of Missenden Abbey from the early 12th century . It last worked in 1937 and was demolished around 1960.\n\nHere, turn left and immediately right to follow the riverside walk. The path then emerges from the trees onto Chesham Moor, follow the river to take the small concrete footbridge at the end.\n\nChesham Moor: The Moor (an old english name for marsh) is actually a larg e island. It was created in the 10th century by Lady Elgiva who diverted the Chess and built Lord’ s Mill.\n\nGo over Bois Moor Road and past the tennis courts and swimming pool. At the end of the terraced houses, cross the road and then turn left to follow the river bank all the way to the roundabout at the main road.\n\nCross to a brick wall, turn right and, after a few paces, left into Meades Water Gardens.\n\nMeades Water Gardens: Originally the location of the leat for Amy Mill, of which now only the sluice gate remains, the site was then converted for use as watercress beds and later ornamental gardens. In 2008 the river was restored as part of a project to regenerate the gardens.\n\nFollow the path through the Gardens to emerge into Germain Street. There is an option here to turn right and follow Germain Street into the High Street and the Station. Otherwise, turn left and then right down Water Lane. At the end turn right past the Queens Head and then right again along Church Street.\n\nAfter 150 metres, cross the road and then take the path to the right of the entrance to The Bury.\n\nThe Bury: Built as a country house for William Lowndes, Secretary to the Treasury , the Bury was completed in 1716. Nearby Lowndes Park was once part of the grounds of the older manor Bury Hill House (now demolished). The park was donated by the Lowndes family to the people of Chesham in 1953.\n\nGo through two sets of iron gates into Lowndes Park. Take the main path ahead and turn right downhill just before the end. Go through the entrance, over the pedestrian crossing and along Blucher Street into the Broadway shopping area. Turn right into the High Street and then left up Station Road to finish the walk at the Metropolitan Line Station.\n\nChesham is a significantly larger town than Amersham (about 50% more residents) but has never been a market town and was not on a coaching road. As a result, it did not develop a historical townscape. The only local landmark is the clock tower at the lower end of High Street, actually a copy from 1995 as the original one from the 19th century was demolished together with the old town hall.\n\nCHESHAM\n\nThe station opened in 1889 as a temporary terminus on the new suburban train line from London. The Metropolitan Railway intended to continue the line towards Tring but changed its mind and built the railway through Amersham and Aylesbury instead so that Chesham remained a terminus.\n\nBecause it was meant as a rural through station, it only got a small brick shed as a station building. An awning supported on wooden posts was added like in Chalfont & Latimer and provides a rural look in line with the character of the area. The station is listed, but this is more linked to the fact that it has also kept ancillary buildings like the nice point control building.\n\nMETROPOLITAN LINE WALK 10\n\nCHORLEYWOOD walk to AMERSHAM\n\n3 1/4 hours\n\nThe train line between Chorleywood and Chalfont & Latimer opened originally as a suburban railway line in 1889. The extension towards Amersham opened in 1892. London Underground took over the line together with the whole Metropolitan network in 1933, which explains why the Underground runs in this case outside of London borders.\n\nRouting note: This walk connects with walk 9 in Chorleywood and with walk 11 in Chalfont & Latimer. Another suggestion if you are looking for a really serious walk is to walk back to Chorleywood using the route from my WAAL series (first half of walk 16, passing through lovely Chalfont St Giles).\n\nMy route uses unpaved public footpaths and is likely to be muddy after rain. The different public footpaths are often signposted but not in a fully reliable manner. I think my description will nonetheless be clear enough.\n\nPlease note that all three stations on this walk are outside of normal London transport fare zones and that your travelcard might not be valid at these stations. Depending on where you start, you might want to check whether an Oyster card would be cheaper or not than a one-day travelcard valid for all zones.\n\nCHORLEYWOOD\n\nThe station opened together with the train line in 1889 and was originally called Chorley Wood. The name was changed to “Chorley Wood & Chenies” in 1915, shortened again in 1934 and modified to the present spelling in 1965.\n\nThe station building is a very plain, low brick building like all stations on the 1889 line. It does not even have an awning.\n\nExit Chorleywood station using the side entrance to the car park from the outwards platform. Walking along the fence, you immediately reach a long flight of steps leading to the high street as the village is much lower than the tracks. Turn right into the high street and follow the direction for about 500 yards as the road becomes a mere residential street (Whitelands Avenue) after a crossroads. This is a nice suburb with well kept houses and flowers in the front gardens.\n\nYou can ignore the three first streets that branch off on the left after the crossroads where the high street turned more modest. Some way after the third street, you will find a public footpath between two houses on your left providing access to the forest. The aim is to continue in the same direction, but now within the forest along the back fences of the gardens. The path is pretty obvious; unfortunately, it may be quite muddy as it is very popular with people walking their dogs. The path is actually signposted as a public footpath from time to time; when it finally leaves the garden fences, it continues slowly downwards within the wood towards a subway under the tracks.\n\nCross under the tracks and continue straight ahead using the muddy farm track, going slowly uphill towards a major road. Cross the road with due care. Continue along the country lane in front of you marked “Chenies” all the way to the village green and turn left at the green to go to the church. The houses around the village green look rather well kept.\n\nThe reason is that the village was a private property of the lord of the manor so that he chose who was allowed to live on the village green and made sure that the houses were kept in good order. The village was sold in 1954 by the last owner, the Duke of Bedford, who was facing inheritance duties in excess of 400 million £ (and a pound was worth much more in 1954).\n\nI was lucky enough to find the church open when I passed it. If you are as lucky, do visit.\n\nThe church goes back to the 15th century and houses a corresponding collection of memorials as well as Norman fonts from the 12th century. The family chapel of the Dukes of Bedford is normally closed off but can be seen through the railings. It was built in 1556 and houses a magnificent series of family monuments as well as a gothic statue of Saint Andrew.\n\nYou are also welcome to visit the castle and its well-known gardens between Easter and October if you can spare the time.\n\nMost of the castle was built in the 16th century. A giveaway are the inventive shapes of the many brick chimneys, a popular embellishment in Tudor times.\n\nBoth Henry VIII and Elizabeth I paid visits to the owners. According to some reports, this is the castle where Katherine Howard, one of the wives collected by Henry VIII, indulged in the activities that led to the king being furious enough to have her beheaded. To be honest, she was queen for little more than a year (in 1541).\n\nThe king was obese and suffered under an illness causing him to smell disgusting, but the family was still willing to consider an affair for Katherine for political reasons (they saw themselves as a leading family in England but had suffered a drop in reputation because of their supposed involvement in the misdeeds of Anne Boleyn, a cousin of Katherine).\n\nThe young queen had already been unduly interested in a series of teachers, musicians, secretaries and courtiers when she was a teenager and she was also not particularly bright: she could just about read and she stupidly insisted not having signed her engagement to a specific courtier, the solution that the king would have used to cancel the royal wedding (because of bigamy) and to send her in exile instead of having her put to death.\n\nTake the road between the manor and the church, it continues as a byway keeping on higher ground above the river Chess. The tracks gives you nice views of the valley. The village in the background on the second picture is Latimer, which you skirt on my route 11. Actually, the picture is cheating because I used powerful lens.\n\nThe byway ends at a small car park at the edge of the wood\n\nWalk L along the car park, then directly R into the next public footpath between meadows (signposted).\n\nAt the end near the stile L on the next public footpath\n\nAhead Chessfield Park (a road)\n\nHalf R along the main road (A404 Amersham Road)\n\nThe road leads directly to the station\n\nCHALFONT & LATIMER\n\nThe station opened together with the train line in 1889 and was originally called Chalfont Road. The present name was given in 1915. A junction towards Amersham was added in 1892. The Amersham line being also served by a long-distance railway, it soon became the main line while the Chesham branch was downgraded to a shuttle service. As this caused congestion issues, including with park & ride facilities, the two lines have been set back on an equal footing in 2010 and both have direct connections with London..\n\nThe station building is a very plain, low brick building like all stations on the 1889 line. It does have an awning, in this case supported by wooden posts that give it an appropriate, slightly rural look. The more interesting look is along the platforms with the valance supported by elaborate cast iron pillars, a design also used for the other stations on the line.\n\nUse the “private footpath to Bedford Avenue” opposite the station building, actually a set of steps\n\nL along Bedford Avenue\n\nWalk parallel to the tracks and to the end of the car park\n\nAhead on a public footpath along the tracks, merging at the end into Marygold Walk (a residential road)\n\nAt the end of Marygold Walk R into Cavendish Close\n\nR across the small open space to reach Elizabeth Avenue, L along the avenue\n\nAt the end R and immediately L on the signposted public footpath through the strip of wood\n\nAt the end L on a public footpath towards the tracks\n\nAhead across the tracks using the footbridge\n\nAhead along a small recreation ground\n\nR White Lion Road\n\nL White Lion Close\n\nThe road turns into a public footpath. Continue ahead turning slightly R\n\nThe path ends with a short section across a wood\n\nCross the main road (A404 Stanley Hill) into the next public footpath (signposted)\n\nAt the end L Quarrendon Road\n\nAt the end ahead using the passage towards First Avenue (near house number 129)\n\nAt the end of the avenue L down the main highway towards the bridge over the river\n\nBefore the bridge R on the riverside path. It is initially paved and well signposted\n\nContinue along the river until you see the church\n\nThere is not much in the church that would be really old, although there are a few nice glass windows. What I enjoyed more in the church is a number of interesting memorial sculptures and brasses. By the way, I have been wondering why memorial brasses are quite frequent in English churches while they are unknown on the Continent – I suppose this might be due to European authorities appropriating the metal for war efforts on a regular basis.\n\nThe church is particularly noted for several monuments devoted to the Drake family, who settled in Amersham in the early 17th century and pretty much lorded over the whole town, owning most of it, naming the vicar and representing it in Parliament. The oldest monument, showing blind William Drake (look at his eyes) mentions that his mother was supposedly the only surviving of 32 siblings – difficult to believe.\n\nThe two other monuments I took pictures of are apparently not related to the Drake family. Taking into account the style of the columns and the wig of the gentleman, they will be from the 18th century.\n\nIf you can afford the time, I suggest you detour here past the church to the main street and have a look at the different interesting buildings. You are in the middle of a historic town as Amersham was part of the dowry of the queen under William I and was awarded market rights as early as 1200. My picture shows a plaque set by the local historical society and giving an overview of notable events.\n\nThe main street is extremely unusual compared to any other town in the London area: it is very wide with large gateways enabling coaches and carriages to turn around easily. This is actually the same idea as in pioneer towns in the American Far West. The house fronts are from a number of different periods but many of the properties have walls going back to the 14th century, particularly those facing the inner yards.\n\nI have also heard thay many of the walls are painted with medieval frescoes. As the town is so ancient, it features regularly in films and box-office success “FourWeddings and a Funeral” was filmed in one of the town inns. The roughly paved sections in front of the buildings are not part of the public pavement; they were originally an important part of the houses as they were used by the merchants to show their merchandise.\n\nThe Guidhall dates back to 1682 but had to be modified: the clock had to be moved because it was too distracting for the workers in the brewery in the back street and the arcades had to be closed off in order to get rid of vagrants. I was lucky enough to get a look at the upper level as it housed an art exhibition when I visited, but the outside impression is actually the main attraction.\n\nDo not hesitate to turn right along the high street to have a look at the many beautiful houses, ending at a water mill on the right at the end of the urban area.\n\nOnce you are back at the guildhall, continue down the high street passing a small house on the right side with a quaint sign threatening “Common Beggars, Ballad Singers and other Vagrants” with being “apprehended”. The sign is dated 1811 and therefore historic enough in its own right.\n\nOn the left side, you walk past a pleasant flower garden around the town memorial. This is the right place to remind you that the last woman who was hanged in England is buried in Amersham. In addition, eight heretics were burned at the stake here in 1521. It is interesting that Henry VIII had these protestant heretics burned, proving indeed that his only reasons for the anglican schism from Rome were his worries about an heir and his greed – you could argue greed was understandable as Henry VIII had good reasons to fear an expensive war against either the French king or the German emperor (a close relative of the woman he had divorced).\n\nIf you wish detailed information about the buildings, you can visit the Amersham Museum (but the opening times are extremely restricted) or you can more conveniently look at their remarkably detailed website http://www.amershammuseum.org.\n\nCome back afterwards to the church and walk to the end of Rectory Drive where you can cross the river\n\nL and soon R along the edge of the cemetery\n\nAhead on the paved public footpath uphill all the way through a wood until you reach the railway tracks. Before reaching the wood, turn around to enjoy the view, one of the most bucolic you can enjoy on any of my Tube walks.\n\nR along the tracks to the station\n\nAMERSHAM\n\nThe station opened together with the new train line in 1892. Metropolitan line services, operated as a suburban railway, continued beyond Amersham towards Aylesbury. This line is now operated by a long-distance train company. Between 1922 and 1937, the station was called “Amersham & Chesham Bois” but this obviously caused confusion with the actual Chesham station.\n\nThe station building is a very plain, low brick building like the other stations on the line. It does not have an awning with posts but it has a small valance in the typical late Victorian style.\n\nMETROPOLITAN LINE WALK 8\n\nMOOR PARK walk to RICKMANSWORTH\n\n1 3/4 hours\n\nThis line opened originally as a suburban railway line in 1889. London Underground took over the line together with the whole Metropolitan network in 1933, which explains why the Underground runs in this case outside of London borders.\n\nRouting note: This walk connects in Moor Park with walk 7 (the more convenient connection of the two due to the way I wrote the description) and with walk 11. It connects in Rickmansworth with walk 9.\n\nMy route uses a public footpath across a golf course over a longer section. The path is unlikely to be very muddy but may well be wet and pets have to be kept on a short leach.\n\nPlease note that Rickmansworth is outside of normal London transport fare zones and that your travelcard might not be valid at this station. Depending on where you start, you might want to check whether an Oyster card would be cheaper or not than a one-day travelcard valid for all zones.\n\nMOOR PARK\n\nThe station opened in 1910 on the existing train line. It was rebuilt in 1925 when a junction towards Watford was added. Originally, the station was called Sandy Lodge after the nearby golf course and non-golfer traffic was minimal. The name changed to Moor Park & Sandy Lodge in 1923 as a large private estate was being built near the station. The name was simplified to Moor Park in 1950.\n\nThe station building is from a large refurbishment project in 1961. It looks very modest and suburban with even wood cladding over the brick walls. This is appropriate considering the wood behind the station but very unusual. In terms of shape, the building is not very inspiring.\n\nExit the station and walk ahead across the roundabout\n\nAhead Main Avenue\n\nThis road crosses a private estate built in the 1930s. The development aimed at the upper middle class, offering life in a privileged environment between three large golf courses. According to press reports, the area has become particularly popular with Asian residents. You might notice that most houses do not have a fenced front garden, just an open lawn. This was imitated from American suburbs and also inspired the garden suburb movement.\n\nAt the end L Astons Road\n\nsoon R Track across the golf course towards the club house\n\nThere are actually two golf courses, one on either side of the central mansion. The upper course is a well-known championship course. Obviously, if you are just walking across the courses following the main tracks, you still need to pay attention to players and errant shots. The golf courses are unsurprisingly private property but there is a restaurant open to the public in the main building and you should not encounter difficulties if you keep to the official roads.\n\nThe mansion is an imposing pile in the typical neo-classical style of the mid 17th century, including many columns from ground floor to the roof eaves, a balustrade hiding the roof and an oversize portico marking the main entrance. Based on the Internet site of the golf course, there is a magnificent staircase and main hall with trompe-l’œil frescoes from the 1680s, but you are not allowed to walk around inside except on very occasional guided tours.\n\nThe mansion and the grounds were purchased by the local authorities in 1923 like many aristocratic properties in the suburbs when owners decided they could not afford the maintenance costs of properties they seldom used. The golf course operator first leased the grounds and bought them outright in 1994.\n\nWhen you reach the mansion used as a club house, turn L on the access road. It merges at the end into Anson Walk (a minor road)\n\nNote the regal arch marking the exit from the golf course property. It was very obviously built at the same time than the mansion. There were a few other scattered remnants of the time when the grounds were a park around the mansion but they were later collected and are now displayed close to the mansion in order to ensure they are not damaged accidentally.\n\nAt the end R along the main highway A404 (Batchworth Heath Hill a.k.a. London Road). This is a busy road but there is initially a very wide grass shoulder you can walk comfortably on. Later on, there is a paved path separate from the road itself.\n\nAt the start of this section, I noticed an amusing coincidence. Just opposite the exit from the golf course grounds, a little house announced proudly “exotic dancers”. You might wonder whether the golfers are the typical clientele of this establishment, but the location is probably rather due to the fact that the roundabout is easy to reach from several directions. By the way, the house is a not uninteresting construction: it is built in flint, an unusual material for anything else than a large public building like a church or palace.\n\nSoon R Park Close\n\nSoon L into public footpath S4 (there is a signpost at the road bend)\n\nThe public footpath crosses the whole length of two golf courses and ends after the club house of the second golf course on the access road\n\nYou have many very pleasant views of the golf courses from the footpath. At one point, you also overlook the mansion you walked past before. Towards the end of the path, you also get a very nice view of the Chess River valley.\n\nExit the golf course area following the access road\n\nL Moor Lane (cross the road first in order to be on the side with the houses)\n\nKeep R along the roundabout\n\nAhead along A404 (a divided highway also called London Road) in order to cross the canal\n\nYou soon walk past the brick building of the pumping station. The part that houses the machinery has tall windows that remind me of a mansion orangery. It was actually typical architecture for pumping stations as there is a very similar version in Tottenham.\n\nShortly afterwards, you cross the Grand Union Canal just downstream of a lock.\n\nThe canal was built around 1800 because the only former solution for companies from the Midlands sending goods to London was by using the Thames after Oxford, a difficult situation as the river was often too low and too unreliable for heavy barges. Most canals declined in the late 19th century as an increasing proportion of goods could be carried more cheaply by railways, but the Grand Union Canal survived thanks i.a. to coal transportation to London factories and is now used by many leisure craft and house boats.\n\nThere is a very cute miniature canal with locks and old-fashioned billboards just below the lock.\n\nFrom the road bridge, you get a good view of the Rickmansworth lock. The river that joins the canal here is the river Chess, the original river course in the valley. There are some very nice properties along the river but they have to be well protected against rising water levels as the Chess is notorious for floods after heavy rains. This is now kept in check better by a large number of artificial lakes converted from former sand and gravel mining activities.\n\nI also noticed a cute bascule bridge over the river. The water arm gives access to a marina, explaining the necessity for such a bridge. They were commonplace in the 19th century, particularly around docks, and some were even used on major railway lines (such as in Sète in France). Except in the Netherlands, they are rare nowadays and might remind you primarily of a well-known painting by Van Gogh showing such a bascule bridge in Arles.\n\nAhead Church Street\n\nYou walk past St Mary’s parish church, an unusual church that is shared between the official Anglican faith and the Methodist church. Few parish priests are willing to allow such sharing with what they consider as a somewhat deviant denomination. The church originates in the 13th century but I don’t think the present building is particularly old.\n\nAt a bend in Church Street, you walk past nice old buildings, one a pub and the other one an interesting property with windows in the neo-gothic style of the 1820s. Rickmansworth was a sizeable town in the 18th century with several successful textile businesses. Its decline was brought about by the railways when the main line to the Midlands was built through Watford rather than trough Rickmansworth. One disadvantage of the town was the climate as the area along the river is prone to cold fog in winter: the town holds the record for the largest temperature swing in Britain when fog dissipated one morning in 1936 and the temperature rose from 1° to 25° over one single day.\n\nL High Street\n\nAt the end R Station Road\n\nAfter the underpass L for the station\n\nRICKMANSWORTH\n\nThe station opened as a the terminus of the new suburban train line in 1887. It became a through station in 1889 when the line was extended towards Chorleywood and Chesham. A junction towards Watford was added in 1925 although trains to Watford bypass the station normally.\n\nThe station building is a plain, low brick building quite typical for a late Victorian minor suburban station. A rather unusual cast iron awning was added later on in order to enliven the building and this is a good idea.\n\nMETROPOLITAN LINE WALK 6\n\nHARROW ON THE HILL walk to NORTHWOOD HILLS\n\n2 3/4 hours\n\nThis line opened originally as a suburban railway line. The section from Harrow to Pinner opened in 1885, the section from Pinner to Northwood Hills in 1887. London Underground took over the line together with the whole Metropolitan network in 1933.\n\nRouting note: This walk connects in Harrow-on-the-Hill with walk 3 and in Northwood Hills with walk 7. It connects in Harrow also with walk 4 but the way I have written the route makes this connection less convenient.\n\nPlease note that this walk uses longer sections of unpaved tracks. The riverside paths in particular can be quite muddy depending on the weather. In order to feel comfortable that you can follow my directions, I suggest you take a copy of the Local Cycling Guide 3 available free of charge from TfL as it is perfectly reliable for the more confusing section between Eastcote House and Northwood Hills.\n\nHARROW-ON-THE-HILL\n\nThe station opened in 1880 on the new train line from Baker Street. It also became a train station on a long-distance line between Marylebone and the Midlands in 1899. It is now used both by the Metropolitan line and by Chiltern Railways. A branch railway opened in 1904 linking Harrow with Uxbridge.\n\nThe station was called plain “Harrow” at the start but the Metropolitan Railway wanted to pre-empt competition on other lines that had stations named after Harrow (“Sudbury Hill Harrow” as well as “Harrow & Wealdstone”). It therefore tried to stress the vicinity to the hilltop town by renaming the station Harrow-on-the-Hill. It is said that the tracks were actually planned to run closer to the hill but that the management of elite Harrow School objected to the disturbances to be expected from whistling and steam belching locomotives (they may also have been worried about too easy an access to the distracting pleasures of London for students old enough to take a train).\n\nThe present station building is obviously Art Déco but more in the style of Scandinavian Art Déco. This involves a very limited grid of geometric shapes. The access from the south is the nicer one but is also a rather subdued design. It is also very inconvenient for such a major junction as travellers have to go up and down long flights of stairs to access the platforms.\n\nExit the station through the main (North) exit. On this side, you have to walk through a shopping centre.\n\nL College Road\n\nAt the end of the road, follow the footpath as it turns R and drops beneath the main road. Cross under the roundabout into Roxborough Road\n\nThis is a really unusual roundabout. It is obviously quite expensive to build elevated roads on pillars and it also has the unpleasant consequence of exposing the higher levels of the surrounding buildings to an additional level of noise. The space reserved for pedestrians and cyclists underneath the road risks being gloomy and attracting unsavoury characters. Surprisingly enough, this does not seem to be the case in Harrow.\n\nSoon L into Harrow Recreation Ground as indicated by a small brown signpost\n\nThe entrance to the grounds is protected by a rather elaborate cast iron gate from 1911. I am not sure which style the designer was inspired by, probably 17th century Renaissance from France or Italy.\n\nWhen you reach the cemetery fence, turn R along the edge of the recreation ground\n\nYou can detour into the cemetery at one point\n\nContinue otherwise on the path along the edge of the open space passing a pavilion, a bowling green and tennis courts.\n\nHarrow Recreation Ground was originally farmland and was purchased by a group of residents and gifted to the borough in 1885 in order to ensure sufficient greenery and sports facilities close to the quickly growing centre of the suburb. This explains why the grounds are significantly larger than the neighbourhood parks the Metropolitan Railway set aside when it planned new suburbs on the land it owned. The park has few flowers, mainly a few rose bushes, and the trees are nice but not particularly impressive. It is just a nice place to walk through.\n\nExit the open space at the very northern end through a short passage\n\nL Cunningham Park\n\nAhead Kingsfield Avenue\n\nL Allington Road\n\nWhen the road turns R, continue ahead into Apsley Close\n\nAt the end ahead on a public footpath\n\nYou are here in the midst of a typical Metropolitan Railway development. The company had managed to include in the authorisation law that it would be allowed to hold land. Parliament realised later that this could significantly impede urban development and create local monopolies, so that later railway companies were only allowed to hold land they actually needed for operational reasons.\n\nThe Metropolitan Railway owners and managers created a sister company that undertook the development of the large farming estates the company had bought. The extremely profitable real estate business was done in an industrial manner, with large areas of land being covered in identical houses of a size deemed appropriate for the likely purchasers. Focal points like local parks and shopping parades were located at carefully calculated distances (about every 1/2 mile).\n\nPeople started to look for a life in the suburbs after World War I. On the one hand, the economy was growing quickly and created better paid jobs in services like trade and insurance rather than just poorly paid industrial jobs. On the other hand, stable jobs enabled banks to develop mortgage offers.\n\nMetroland (the name used by the company in advertisements) was very successful but caused problems. As long as people went to the shops and walked to the park every day, the streets were reasonably lively. But the increasing use of cars and the possibility to store food in refrigerators led people to increasingly isolate themselves in their houses with gardens. Nothing in the straight, boring streets attracted people outside. The lack of a sense of community contributed to domestic problems and disputes between neighbours. Urban planners turned in the late 1930s to a different concept, that of the garden suburbs.\n\nat the end R Canterbury Road\n\nL Durham Road\n\nsoon R Cumberland Road\n\nAt the end half L on the main road (Station Road) for\n\nNORTH HARROW\n\nThe station opened in 1915 on the line built 30 years before when real estate development started to justify it. It is a rather unusual case of a station being opened during World War I when it was actually more customary to close individual stations due to staff shortages.\n\nThe station concourse is hidden below the tracks and the entrance is only marked through an inconspicuous neo-classical stone lining.\n\nCross under the tracks at the station\n\nR Northumberland Road\n\nAfter Suffolk Road, you reach a brook flowing through a narrow open space\n\nFollow the clearly signposted cycling route using the riverside path, you are in Yeading Brook Open Space\n\nYeading Brook (named after the village where it flows into the river Crane) is a minor undertributary of the Thames. The nice thing about it is that Metroland planners were worried about possible floods and kept a narrow band of open space free of construction along most of the course of the river. It is possible to walk along the river for a longer distance (with detours due to railway lines) but explorers need to take into account that the path is usually neither paved nor signposted. I have used it for several of my routes when convenient. In this particular section, the riverside open space is landscaped as a neighbourhood park and there is even a rather cute footbridge at the southern end.\n\nThe path crosses a minor road and bypasses a roundabout\n\nAt the end of the path R across the brook into Whittington Way\n\nR into Pinner Village Gardens Recreation Ground\n\nThis is a typical Metroland park planned together with the suburb in the 1920s. As such, it is primarily an open grassy space with pleasant trees lining paved paths. The trees do not rise to spectacular size because the park is actually not very old. The one interesting detail is a bird fountain in the middle of a shallow pond.\n\nThe park website mentions raised flower beds and a rose garden, which I find confusing. I think the flower beds towards the Marsh Gate exit are meant; I might possibly have missed the flowers because I was there in late autumn and because grasses were extremely fashionable with park managers in that year. I give you a picture of the exit towards Marsh Road also because it has an airy atmosphere rarely seen in suburbs. The trees in the backgound are rather unusual in London and might be Caledonian pines.\n\nCross ahead to the northern exit\n\nL Marsh Road\n\nCross under the tracks. The station is up a short ramp right after the underpass\n\nJust before reaching the underpass, I noticed an interesting building used currently by a pub. The freestanding house is nicely symmetrical with a generous splattering of cornices and other decorative features built out of bricks. The colour mix is quite typically late Victorian but the elaborate cornice under the roof eaves is really unusual and may well be Arts & Crafts, a style very seldom used for pubs.\n\nPINNER\n\nThe station opened in 1885 as a temporary terminus on the new line coming from Harrow. It became a through station in 1887 when the extension of the line towards Moor Park opened.\n\nThe station building is the original one and is a plain, low brick building with very little in terms of decoration. The architectural style reminds much more of a modest suburban train station than of an Underground station and this corresponds to the image the Metropolitan Railway had of itself. Although its trains continued beyond the Baker Street terminus all around central London, the company saw itself as a suburban company and tried to avoid nationalisation in 1933 by using this argument.\n\nKeep on Marsh Road and cross the brook\n\nYou are here quite in the middle of Pinner, a seriously affluent part of the borough that grew around an old village. Because it was still a somewhat rural area in the Metroland era, the borough managed to pass conservation orders in time and keep a lovely high street with a series of old buildings with just one upper floor. As usual, medieval looking buildings with wooden beams painted black will be pubs (which does not necessarily mean that the front is as old as it looks but it will look good on your nostalgy album).\n\nOne of the pubs does not play the game of mock medieval because it does not need to, being in an actual building from 1580 – that’s what it says on the street front, at any rate. The protruding first floor is indeed an old design as Victorians could not do this with the bricks they usually used for walls.\n\nFrom the roundabout, you can have a look uphill to the parish church partly hidden by an other mock-medieval pub (easy to spot as the black beams are suspiciously regular and perfectly symmetrical). Do not hesitate to detour the few yards to the church as it has a nice old tower from the 15th century. Most of the walls were rebuilt in Victorian times. As my picture shows, there are somewhat unusual roof level windows. They were added in 1880 at a time when mock-Tudor was actually not particularly fashionable and may be influenced rather by the Arts & Crafts interest for old handicraft.\n\nThere are a few interesting details inside if you find the church open. I did not pay too much attention to the monuments but I did notice a nice piece of embroidery showing many village landmarks. It is quite a good design and the workmanship is exceptionally good for such amateur work, with extremely fine design lines rendered without any blurring. I saw similar embroideries in a few other London churches but rarely of that quality.\n\nWhen you leave the church, don’t miss the seriously quirky monument in the churchyard in form of a section of pyramid with a coffin protruding from one side. It was designed by a botanist in the 18th century.\n\nL Chapel Lane passing again under the tracks\n\nL into Pinner Memorial Park\n\nThis park is the starting point of a walking route for which the borough has published a useful leaflet. The Celandine Route is named after a local flower but is actually more or less a Pinn River Valley walk, leading along the river for most of its course between Pinner and Ickenham. My route follows this walk for over a mile and I therefore copy here in italics the descriptions from the leaflet. They might help because the walk is only signposted occasionally.\n\nThe park comes with a small mansion. Both were bought by an association of wealthy Pinner residents, put into a trust and gifted to the borough. The name of the park comes from the intention to commemorate the victims of the two world wars. The mansion has a faintly distinguished history, having been the property of a grandson of admiral Nelson in the 19th century. It is now used as a community centre and also houses a small museum devoted to a leading early 20th century illustrator, Heath Robinson, who lived in Pinner for 10 years until 1918. Please note that the museum charges admission and has limited opening times.\n\nThe park is very nice indeed with a lovely pond and a number of interesting flower beds. The overall concept is inspired by the typical three-tier system used by gardeners in the royal parks but the choice of vegetation is very different. Instead of contrasting colour blocks made of formal flowers, you have lavender and high rose bushes in carefully coordinated colours. I give you pictures taken in June and others taken in late October, showing that the park does not look interesting only in summer.\n\nHere the route leaves the river for a while as it disappears underground. Walk along the path through the park and turn left at the play area and before the aviary to walk around the edge of the lake.\n\nTurn to the left of West House and follow the path to the gate passing the small dog cemetery dating from the 19th century.\n\nCross West End Lane with care and turn left past the school. On your left is Rose Cottage with its rose decoration on the front. This cottage was built when West End was part of a hamlet.\n\nContinue along the road crossing two other roads until Cranbourne Drive, then turn right and enter Cuckoo Hill allotments.\n\nHere the walk rejoins the river. Walk straight ahead along a wide path through some woodland and on reaching the open grass area keep to the path on the left. In spring a common yellow flower called celandine can be seen here and at many places along the walk.\n\nMany of the open spaces between Eastcote and Ickenham are managed as hay meadows, to encourage wildlife, and increase biodiversity.\n\nYou are now entering the London Borough of Hillingdon.\n\nCross Cheney Street and enter Long Meadow open space where cows used to graze; walk ahead past a group of poplar trees.\n\nThese trees are called Hinman Copse named after Margaret Hinman who was a great benefactor to Eastcote during the 1940 and 50s. Here a bird called the treecreeper may be seen.\n\nAt the wooden bridge it is possible to cross the river and enter Eastcote House Gardens containing 16th Century buildings, such as the Stables, Dovecot and Walled Garden. The Walled Garden has recently been replanted as has the rockery in the orchard.\n\nEastcote House itself was demolished in 1964 as it was derelict after having been used for a number of government bodies over the previous decades. I give you pictures of the different attractions mentioned in italics just above. One attraction not mentioned in the leaflet is the row of well maintained topiary.\n\nReturn to the road and cross Eastcote High Road with great care. Walk through Haydon Hall grounds; on the left there are the remains of an old lake now enjoyed by local young cyclists.\n\nWalk past the large sequoia tree and other conifers and go through gate. Cross road with care, turn left along Joel Street to bridge and T-junction. Turn right to walk past tennis courts, and a mock Tudor building (a substation).\n\nWalk through Forge Green Open Space which used to be the site of a blacksmiths forge.\n\nTurn right over footbridge and then immediately left with the river on the left. Follow the riverside path as it crosses over two roads and enter King’s College Playing Fields.\n\nYou need to leave the riverside path when you reach the next road and an athletic track. Turn R on Kings College Road\n\nWhen the road ends at the second roundabout, continue ahead on a track across Park Wood.\n\nThis is one of five woods managed by the borough. Although they are separated by roads or open spaces, they can be understood as one single stretch of countryside that is quite important for wildlife. Some of the woods were little used in past centuries because there was no large settlement nearby and are considered quite similar to what natural wood would have looked like in neolithic times. This is indicated by the mix of trees including wild service trees. In areas that were used more, the dominant tree is hornbeam. My picture shows that the more accessible stands were coppiced: they would be cut near the ground every 20 years or so, encouraging growth of many thin trees that could be used for a number of tools as hornbeam wood is particularly hard.\n\nContinue straight ahead as long as possible. At the end, you reach a miniature railway on the bank of Ruislip Lido reservoir.\n\nR along the miniature railway for a short distance. Ignore the first path to your R but take the second one, walking towards the North-East.\n\nWhen you exit the wood, you have a nice view over the lower ground with the Pinn River valley. The hill opposite on the other side is Pinner Hill with the particularly elegant suburb of Pinnerwood Park, graced with numerous sizeable villas in manicured gardens.\n\nThe path reaches the end of Wiltshire Lane. Ignore the road and continue on the wood path in about the same direction as before. Continue on the path until you reach a cycle path and a recreation ground with a pavilion. You can see the tracks a bit further in front of you\n\nR to exit the recreation ground, then L on Highland Road towards the tracks.\n\nThe road turns R a first time. When it turns R a second time and switches to York Road, turn L on the unmarked footpath\n\nCross the main road for\n\nNORTHWOOD HILLS\n\nThe station opened in 1933 on the existing line in order to encourage real estate development in the area.\n\nThe station is a simple brick structure like the neighbouring stations but it has an elaborate roof that reminds a little of a country cottage and therefore works better as a focal point within the suburb.\n\nMETROPOLITAN LINE WALK 5\n\nRUISLIP walk to UXBRIDGE\n\n3 hours\n\nThis Underground line opened in 1904.\n\nRouting note: This route connects in Ruislip with walk 4.\n\nPlease note that my route includes extended sections with no path or just unpaved traces. Sturdy shoes are recommended and the ground is likely to be muddy after rainy weather.\n\nRUISLIP\n\nThe station opened together with the train line in 1904.\n\nThe station building does not look at all like an Underground station and would feel perfectly appropriate on a suburban train line in the southern suburbs. It is indeed the original design from 1904 at a time when the Metropolitan operated more like a suburban railway who just happened to own an underground line in central London. The valance over the porch and the window surroundings are painted white, contrasting strikingly with the subdued grey brick walls. This was a very popular style in Edwardian times.\n\nExit on the main forecourt and take the station approach\n\nL Pembroke Road\n\nAhead across High Street into Kingsend\n\nThis is a somewhat lengthy section along a straight road but you are in the outermost suburbs and this means there is room for interesting houses rather than for the ubiquitous developer terraces. The first picture shows a very unusual type of house that reminded me much of Northern Germany. The extremely tall roof with a broken line in particular is very intriguing. You might think it is a converted barn but the perfectly straight wooden beams come from a factory and the ugly plastic window frames let me think the house was built from scratch.\n\nFor the sake of contrast, the second picture shows a building that could have been built in a similar manner several hundred years ago. There are similar historical buildings in Cheam for example. You will notice that the window frames have been integrated much more carefully in the clapboard front.\n\nThe third building is actually plain brick painted white but I found the small room over the door quite intriguing. I have been wondering whether the dark wood used for paneling is old wood retrieved from a demolished building or is just designed on a computer in a manner supposed to look old.\n\nAt the roundabout ahead into Ickenham Road\n\nR Hill Lane, the access road for a golf course\n\nAhead on the public footpath, leaving the access road when it turns L\n\nWhen the lane forks, continue ahead along the golf course on Clack Lane. This is a narrow unpaved path, an old link between isolated farms and the village of Ickenham.\n\nWhen the lane reaches a brook, turn L on the riverside path without crossing the brook.\n\nThe path is called officially the Celandine Path, a local walking trail named after a wild flower. Signposts are not perfectly reliable and I borrow the instructions from the Hillingdon borough website:\n\nThis area is very popular with many bird species including the winter visitors such as redwings and fieldfares. The west meadow is an excellent area for wild flowers such as ragged robin.\n\nDo not cross the next footbridge but continue straight under the railway line, keeping the river on your right.\n\nThe river is the river Pinn, a minor undersubsidiary of the Thames that gave its name to the suburb of Pinner. The railway line over the viaduct is outside of London tariff zones and carries trains from London Marylebone towards High Wycombe.\n\nThis stretch of the river is a favourite feeding place for grey wagtails and kingfishers are often seen.\n\nAt the next footbridge, near a play area, it is possible to cross the river and turn right and walk back to the site of the old Pynchester Moat which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nContinue past the play area to Swakeleys Road (dual carriageway). Cross at the traffic lights and enter gate.\n\nWhen you reach tennis courts and a small playground, leave the riverside path\n\nL Milton Road (away from the brook). The road is unmarked at this end but is the only one leading clearly away from the brook\n\n2nd L Milton Court\n\nThere is a sizeable open space in the middle of the small development. You are clearly far from central London as no developer would leave such ground unbuilt in the inner suburbs. It reminds actually a little of the style of garden suburbs planned in the 1950s.\n\nCross the small green space and continue to the end of the road\n\nR Almond Avenue\n\nBefore continuing ahead towards the station, you might wish to go on a short detour L to the parish church\n\nSt Giles Ickenham is a nice old parish church with a gothic nave from 1335. The windows, the porch and the tower really give the feeling of an old church in a rural setting. I was unable to enter the church but there are apparently a few details of interest inside. I read a peculiar story about the construction of the north aisle of the church in the late 16th century: it was financed by a parishioner who insisted that it was a loan and not a gift. When he died, he did offer that the debt be reduced by a small amount for each member of his family buried in the church (rather than in the churchyard). The gentleman sounds a bit greedy and I do not know whether the debt ended up being repaid in the end. I also give you a picture of an interesting grave. The maid “proved herself a faithful, honest servant for upwards of 20 years”. I am not sure what I should think about someone being remembered in this manner.\n\nOtherwise ahead Glebe Avenue passing\n\nICKENHAM\n\nThe station opened in 1905 on the underground line built the previous year. The local authorities had quite a few difficulties convincing the Metropolitan company that the investment was justified and it was just a halt with a short platform at the start. The stop proved unexpectedly popular for weekend outings and a full station opened in due course.\n\nThe original building at road level was replaced in the 1970s by a small brick box. The lower part is left natural while the upper part is painted white, an unusual scheme for an Underground station.\n\nThe avenue turns slowly L further on passing a school\n\nJust after the bridge over the tracks, the large brick building housing the Compass Theatre is actually the old Ickenham Hall, bought by the borough in 1948 and converted to a youth and arts centre. The building was of limited interest, with Georgian shapes but extended later.\n\nAfter the school R Austin’s Lane (a farming lane accessible through a kissing gate)\n\nWhen you reach the brook, turn R on the riverside path without crossing the river.\n\nYou are now in Ickenham Marsh, a nature reserve managed by the borough. The river across the marsh is the Yeading Brook, an interesting river that runs for 16 miles. It is possible to walk along the river for longer sections and I use the opportunity on several of my routes. The Marsh is one of the wildest sections of the valley and the picture taken in summer with a goat herd is a really surprising view for London.\n\nThe path crosses under a motorway and its access road\n\nR on the cycling path along allotments and the motorway slip road called Western Avenue\n\nAt the end R Long Lane across the motorway passing\n\nHILLINGDON\n\nThe station opened in 1923 on the existing line. The name was initially just Hillingdon, but it was extended to Hillingdon (Swakeleys) in the 1930s because the station is actually located a good distance away from the core of the village. The station recovered its original, simpler name in the 1950s. It was relocated by a short distance in 1992 because of the construction of the motorway.\n\nThe present station building is logically also from 1992 and was designed with the idea of making a bit of an architectural statement. This idea started in the 1930s with a number of Piccadilly line stations, had been forgotten in the 1970s for cost reasons but came back with the improvement in the economy. Hillingdon fits in with other stations built later like those on the Jubilee line extension.\n\nThe building has actually rather simple shapes, a bit like a set of oversized barns fitting with the half rural location, but the use of glass and steel all painted white makes it very unusual. It was actually considered a very interesting and innovative design at the time. The station is not located along the main road but quite far back in order to give more room for a large car park; for this reason, there is a surprisingly long elevated passage for pedestrians between the station building and the road. The colour and the materials remind a little of passages in tropical countries.\n\nContinue across the motorway and the tracks\n\nL Swakeleys Drive\n\nThe name is taken from Swakeleys House, a sizeable mansion located behind a row of houses on your right-hand side. You might be able to walk up to the manor house using the access road opposite a road called “The Grove”. It is an important historical building built in 1638 in the Jacobean style. The style is rare in London, with Charlton House being the only other important exponent in London. At the time of construction, the house was criticised for being a little showy with too many pediments.\n\nThere is supposedly some remarkable decoration inside but the mansion was converted to offices and may be converted to a private residence. In any case, it is not possible to see the fine interiors although you can have a look at the website where they are shown (www.swakeleys.org).\n\nThe grounds of such a mansion obviously included all elements needed for a pleasant life in the countryside such as a boating pond fed by the river Pinn. You do see the lake from my walk.\n\nCross the river and turn directly afterwards L into the cycling path\n\nThe path runs parallel to (but not directly along) the river, passes tennis courts and turns then R in order to reach an overpass over the motorway.\n\nAt the end of the ramp, you are in a large open space. Take half L along sports grounds, going away from the motorway.\n\nThe sports amenities included for about 25 years a ski slope that was demolished in 2002. This particular equipment was faddish for a certain time but was extremely expensive to maintain (you had to cool water to produce snow) and therefore impossible to manage profitably. Actually, ski slopes in urban areas remain a rarity both in Britain and on the Continent. Flights to the French Alps are just so cheap nowadays and there are more opportunities for boozy après-ski and overpriced pizza in the Alps than in Hillingdon.\n\nCross the road at the end of the path into Uxbridge Common, keeping along North Common Road\n\nThis is a pleasant green space with a nice little pond on one side.\n\nAt the end R Gravel Hill\n\nAt the end L for a few yards\n\nSoon R into a public footpath (there is a dark green signpost) towards Fray’s Bridge\n\nCross the river using the footbridge\n\nThe river looks natural but is actually an artificial arm of the much larger river Crane diverted in order to feed a number of water mills.\n\nL along the river, the path turns later into a paved road (Braybourne Close)\n\nAt the end of the road, you will need to turn L into High Street. If you have time, you can also add a short detour R across bridges to have a look at the nice setting of Uxbridge Lock.\n\nWalking towards the locks, you cross both the main arm of the river Crane and the Grand Union Canal, also fed by the river. The waters give a nice backdrop for the office buildings built between them and there is also an island with a sculpture.\n\nYou then need to turn around and come back.\n\nBefore climbing the hill, you walk past a pub called the “Crown and Treaty”. It is the main historical building in Uxbridge as representatives of King and Parliament met here in 1644 to negotiate a peace treaty during the Civil War. No agreement was reached though. Uxbridge had been chosen as a location because it was an important Parliament town defending the access to London from the West.\n\nWalk uphill on High Street\n\nUxbridge was a busy market town until the 19th century but there are no old buildings except for the former market hall, a large Georgian building from 1785 with typical market arcades and a clock tower. The building has apparently been streamlined later.\n\nAlways ahead for\n\nUXBRIDGE\n\nThe original terminus opened in 1904 on the new Underground line but it was located a few yards further. It was relocated directly on High Street in 1938.\n\nAs the new terminus was served not only by the Metropolitan line but also by the Piccadilly line which was just being rebuilt with impressive stations, Uxbridge got a nearly exact copy of the other Piccadilly line terminus (Cockfosters). The central platform has a raised roof with light coming in through openings over the lower roofs that shelter the tracks. This is much more pleasant and helps save on lighting costs; it is actually the same technique already used in medieval cathedrals.\n\nLike in Cockfosters, the material used throughout is concrete without any covering, something that went completely out of fashion for many decades afterwards (it just starts to become popular again now that engineers have found surface treatments ensuring the concrete does not degrade due to water seepage).\n\nThe big difference between Cockfosters and Uxbridge is the street front. In Uxbridge, it is the middle of a mildly curving shopping parade marked by an elegant black and gold portico and sculptures on the eaves. They show winged wheels, a popular motive in the 1930s when speed and modern transportation were very exciting.\n\nOn an amusing note, I was able to take a picture of a very old-fashioned cigarette automat in the station hall. It had obviously not been used for a very long time considering the price indications and I suppose it has been taken away since.\n\nMETROPOLITAN LINE WALK 4\n\nHARROW-ON-THE-HILL walk to RUISLIP\n\n3 hours\n\nOriginally, no train line was planned between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Ruislip via Rayners Lane. The District Railway wanted to build a line reaching Ruislip from its terminus at Earl’s Court, running through Acton, South Harrow and Rayners Lane. But this was a very large investment and the company was unable to raise sufficient funds, so that it only built the section to South Harrow (now a Piccadilly line branch) and sold the section between Rayners Lane and Ruislip to the Metropolitan Railway.\n\nThis obviously implied that the Metropolitan would need to build a connection between Rayners Lane and its main line through Harrow. The full line from Harrow to Ruislip and Uxbridge opened then in 1904.\n\nIn 1910, the two companies agreed to build the short missing link between Rayners Lane and South Harrow, using the original District line plans. The Metropolitan then allowed the District to run trains over the whole originally planned route and this explains why some Piccadilly Line trains run all the way to Uxbridge and some have their terminus at Rayners Lane.\n\nRouting note: This route connects conveniently in Harrow with Metropolitan line walk 3. The connection with walk 6 is less convenient. The route then connects at Rayners Lane with Piccadilly Line walk 15 and finally more conveniently in Ruislip with Metropolitan line walk 5.\n\nMy route crosses a number of green spaces. Some paths are not paved and the ground might be soggy after heavy rains.\n\nHARROW-ON-THE-HILL\n\nThe station opened in 1880 on the new train line from Baker Street. It also became a train station on a long-distance line between Marylebone and the Midlands in 1899. It is now used both by the Metropolitan line and by Chiltern Railways. A branch railway opened in 1904 linking Harrow with Uxbridge.\n\nThe station was called plain “Harrow” at the start but the Metropolitan Railway wanted to pre-empt competition on other lines that had stations named after Harrow (“Sudbury Hill Harrow” as well as “Harrow & Wealdstone”). It therefore tried to stress the vicinity to the hilltop town by renaming the station Harrow-on-the-Hill. It is actually said that the tracks were planned to run closer to the hill but that the management of elite Harrow School objected to the disturbances to be expected from whistling and steam belching locomotives (it may also have been worried about too easy an access to the distracting pleasures of London for students old enough to take a train).\n\nThe present station building is obviously Art Déco but more in the style of Scandinavian Art Déco. This involves a very limited grid of geometric shapes. This is particularly obvious on the picture taken from the upper deck of a bus with the rounded staircase being the only break in the long horizontal line of the concourse. The access from the south is the nicer one but is also a rather subdued design. It is also very inconvenient for such a major junction as travellers have to go up and down long flights of stairs to access the platforms.\n\nExit the station through the smaller southern exit towards the car park\n\nAhead along Lowlands Recreation Ground\n\nThis is a very small open space, not much more than a courtyard for the station access\n\nCross busy Lowlands Road into The Grove Open Space\n\nKeep near the right edge of the open space\n\nThis open space is more sizeable but you don’t stay long in it. My walk number 3 spends much more time in it. The open space is part of a large set of green spaces that cover most approaches of old Harrow village located on the top of the hill. They have been preserved partly because many were bought early on by Harrow School to ensure sufficient distance from the riffraff of suburban life.\n\nR into the signposted Public Footpath no. 63\n\nAhead past the church on the signposted “Public Footpath Roxborough Road” (do not take Roxborough Avenue)\n\nThis church is a very surprising building because it was erected by the Roman Catholic church. The location was chosen with the secret hope that it may lure some Harrow School pupils away from the Anglican parish church located not very far away at the top of the hill. This hope was not so far-fetched as Cardinal Manning, the catholic Bishop of Westminster in 1873, had studied at Harrow School.\n\nThe original chapel was converted to a sizeable parish church in 1894. It is an extremely rare example of a Roman Catholic church in the neo-gothic style. English Catholics usually wanted to stress how different they were from the official church and therefore built their churches in a style that might remind for example of Italian or Oriental churches. This being said, neo-gothic was still the flavour of the day for churches while it had become a bit tired for private and official buildings.\n\nAhead on Public Footpath no. 68 along the edge of Church Fields open space\n\nFrom the footpath, you get a pleasant view of the site of Harrow village above you at the top of the hill. The thin spire marks the Anglican parish church and is a popular landmark. It marks also the highest built-up location in the old county of Middlesex. Most of the hilltop around the church is devoted to the many buildings of Harrow School but you do not see them from so far below.\n\nL Bessborough Road\n\nSoon R Whitmore Road\n\nThe road runs along a large cricket ground. It is fenced in, which is not unusual for this particular sports, but I do not know whether it is part of Harrow School or whether it belongs to the borough or to a club. Most Harrow School sports facilities are actually on the southern slope of the hill, where the climate is a little bit milder.\n\nBetween houses 32 and 34, R into a footpath between the houses\n\nThis is actually a rather pleasant footpath as it is wide enough not to be squeezed between fences. Looking at a map, it is difficult to be sure what the footpath was supposed to link. It may have been the link between an isolated farmhouse and the village on the hilltop.\n\nThe footpath merges at the end into Bowen Road\n\nAt the end L Vaughan Road\n\nWEST HARROW\n\nThe suburban train line had opened in 1904 but the station did not open before 1913 when real estate developments started to justify it.\n\nThe station building is obviously not from 1913. Such brick sheds with a glass roof were quite normal in the 1980s. The plain style is surprising for an Underground station and reminds more of a suburban train station.\n\nDo not cross the tracks at West Harrow station\n\nInstead L Wilson Gardens\n\nAhead across West Harrow Recreation Ground, exiting at the other end\n\nThis park is a typical product of the real estate development organised by the Metropolitan Railway. The company built houses along a rather boring grid of roads and included a neighbourhood park about every 2/3 mile. This implies that residents would find a park within 15 minutes of their home. This type of suburb was criticised later on for being lifeless and having no sense of community, partly because most people would end up staying in their gardens.\n\nWest Harrow Recreation Ground is a bit special because it is close to the central part of the borough. It has several sports facilities, a pavilion and a café. The trees are not very impressive in my opinion, possibly because the ground is not well drained. There is also a small flower garden, a luxury awarded to a minority of parks in the outer suburbs.\n\nAhead Welbeck Road, turns later L\n\nBetween houses 80 and 82 into a short footpath\n\nAt the end R Twyford Road\n\nSoon L Strongbridge Close\n\nAhead across a modern estate along the central reservation with a playground\n\nAt the end on the footpath along the tracks, crossing them a little later\n\nThis is a very enjoyable footpath because of the greenery on both sides. Actually, the wild bushes and the trees are just linked to the fact that you are walking between two sets of Tube tracks until you come closer to the station and see them merging. From the footbridge, you get a good understanding of the consequences of powering the Underground through a third rail.\n\nIt makes junctions very delicate if you want to be sure that sparks don’t jump between rails that are not supposed to be electrified. The advantage was that it was much cheaper to build than electrical overhead lines and that bridges could remain much lower, giving just enough clearance for the carriages. Overhead power is only used in the London area on a very small number of train lines while it is ubiquitous in Europe for trains (less so for Underground networks because of the tunnel size).\n\nThe footpath ends just opposite the station\n\nRAYNERS LANE\n\nThe suburban train line through the station was opened in 1904 and the station itself was added in 1906 in order to encourage suburban development and therefore commuter traffic. A junction was added in 1910 in order to provide access to the railway to Acton and Westminster, operated at the time by the District Railway. Both lines were taken over by the Underground and the District Line branch switched to the Piccadilly Line in 1933.\n\nThe original station building was rebuilt in 1932. By that time, the Underground had its own architect, Charles Holden. He is admired for his many Art Déco designs from the 1930s, those on the Piccadilly Line being the most celebrated. He often designed station concourses as big, very simple geometric boxes. Here, it is a cube. The large clerestory (vertical) windows were considered very important at the time with the intention to bring sunlight into buildings, which was both deemed healthier and cheaper than artificial lighting. If your ticket allows it, have a look from the platforms at it shows even better how much glass Charles Holden liked to use.\n\nDo not cross the tracks, turn L along the main road for a few yards\n\nYou need to cross this busy road and there are no traffic lights. Be very careful !\n\nBefore leaving the main road, have a look at the spectacular front of the zoroastrian centre, a former film theatre. It was customary to give theatres an impressive front in the 1930s because they were the most exciting activity proposed in the suburbs and were supposed to stand out from the normal shops. Most theatres have moved now to commercial zones with large car parks but some of the buildings were listed and were converted to bingo halls or often to places of worship like here.\n\nI mentioned before how architects loved curving shapes in the 1930s in order to break the grid effect caused by the windows and the vertical towers. This particular theatre is one of the most spectacular examples and architecture lovers might be reminded of baroque churches with the interplay of curves and countercurves. This exuberant form of Art Déco was expensive and disappeared soon because of the economic crisis.\n\nThe shopping parade that abuts the film theatre is also an interesting example of Art Déco, but it is on a more normal scale and is similar to such parades in many suburbs of the time such as Hendon. In the case of Rayners Lane, the architect chose a stepped design rather than a single curving line. What is a bit strange is the idea to put boxed windows over all the shops, a little like wintergardens or loggias. Bow windows were a staple idea in residential houses but they would be round, not square.\n\nSoon R High Worple (a residential road)\n\nWhen you reach the roundabout at the end of the road, take the narrow road ahead marked as a cycle path (blue signpost)\n\nCross the brook into Roxbourne Park\n\nRoxbourne Park is a bit special among the parks planned in the suburbs developed by the Metropolitan Railway. It is actually a park in two parts linked by a thin ribbon of greenery along a brook. The upper part of the park you cross first is a standard suburban park with limited amenities. It would have been enough for normal development purposes but the developer realised that building houses directly along the brook was risky in terms of flooding and damp.\n\nAs a result, nearly the whole course of the brook was kept as a narrow strip of open spaces. The borough of Uxbridge, which you reach in the lower part of Roxbourne Park, has published a leaflet describing the “Hillingdon trail”, a large section of which is actually the waterside path along Yeading Brook. I use the path on several routes.\n\nYou have a choice here. If the ground is very soggy, turn L along the brook\n\nIf the ground is dry enough, you can add a minor detour through a nature reserve. For this, keep to the cycling track as it runs first along the tracks and then towards the next park exit.\n\nR up Cannon Lane walking towards the bridge\n\nL before the tracks into Roxborough Rough through a wooden gate\n\nKeep walking along the tracks until you are forced to turn L because of garden fences\n\nAhead along the fences until you are back in Roxbourne Park near the brook\n\nRoxborough Rough Ecological Park is the small part of the Yeading Brook area that belongs to the borough of Harrow. It is screened from roads by dense growth but the core of it is actually a large meadow that tends to get muddy in rainy weather because the main path is just a trace. The difference between an ecological park and a normal park is that the first one has a meadow instead of planted grass. In winter, there is not much difference.\n\nIndependently of your routing choice, walk now downstream along the brook\n\nNow that you are in the lower part of Roxbourne Park and in Uxbridge borough, you encounter a lovely amenity. Miniature railways were quite popular in the 1930s and several clubs of enthusiasts popped up in the suburbs. The problem was to find grounds where they would be allowed to lay tracks. In this particular case, the club used grounds in other locations in the borough of Harrow until it was offered the present location because the borough was planning landscaping work anyway and could integrate it (the ground needs to be stable enough for laying tracks, which is not the case in a normal park without some preparatory work).\n\nIn order to see trains running, you need to be there on a Sunday afternoon in summer. The route of the tracks is not overly exciting but there is an impressive number of perfectly maintained machines.\n\nExit the park near the miniature railway\n\nUse the road bridge to cross the brook, then directly R before the allotment fence on the footpath along the brook\n\nAs you can see on the picture, the path is narrow and unpaved, which is more enjoyable if you wear appropriate shoes. You can also see how small Yeading Brook is. There are actually three parallel water courses in the area (the two others are the Roxbourne Brook, which strangely enough does not run through Roxbourne Park, and the River Pinn) so that all three are small.\n\nWhen you reach an other road bridge after passing a playground, cross the brook again and continue downstream using the narrow open space before the first house\n\nThe footpath ends a little later at a service road\n\nR on the road, then across Whitby Road into Bessingby Playing Fields\n\nThis is just a large open field used for sports. I read that renting a field costs 55 £ but I suppose this only applies to clubs. It does not sound cheap to me; assuming a match every weekend and three training sessions per week, every team would cost the club about 7,000 £ in rental fees per season. Obviously, being member of a club is still cheaper than watching a professional team in a stadium, which often costs 100 £ and more per match.\n\nAhead along the fields, then across Pine Gardens (an extension of Bessingby Park looking very similar)\n\nTurn slightly R in order to continue across open spaces, this is now Cavendish Recreation Ground\n\nThis is a separate park because it was originally the property of a retail company that had built sports facilities for their staff here. This was quite common in the 1950s until companies started to cut costs. Nowadays, you do see large companies sponsoring sports for their staff again, but they will rather do it in the form of sponsoring an independent club. Only fancy industries like IT build company facilities, particularly fitness rooms that have the advantage that staff can continue discussing business while sweating and is kept close to their desks and computers.\n\nThe rather impressive size of the pavilion in the recreation ground and the fashionable mock-Tudor eaves show that the retail company was serious about giving employees an enjoyable place. The pavilion has a reasonably large rose garden but I think it would look better if the rose bushes were planted closer to each other.\n\nExit the grounds near the tennis courts and the pavilion\n\nL Field End Road passing the station\n\nEASTCOTE\n\nLike Rayners Lane, the station opened in 1906 on the line built two years earlier in order to encourage real estate development. The managers of the Metropolitan line had a vested interest in this as they also owned a very active real estate development company. The obvious conflict of interest was a specialty of the Metropolitan because it was the only company who was allowed to buy and keep land wholesale; Parliament forced all subsequent train companies to own only the land needed to built the tracks.\n\nThe station was rebuilt in 1939 and Charles Holden was again the designer. His style had changed slightly since Rayners Lane seven years earlier and he combines here his signature brick geometry and the very large glass window with lovely rounded pavilions on either side of the station porch. Rounded ends to buildings had become extremely popular in order to break the somewhat boring straight lines of pure Art Déco; they were also supposed to remind people of ocean liners and plane cockpits. There is actually a rounded end in Rayners Lane as well but it is much less conspicuous.\n\nYou might notice here that the station parade looks much more traditional than in Rayners Lane. It is just a plain row of identical houses, the only unusual detail being the balcony running all the way from one end of the parade to the other. It is actually not a balcony but the normal access corridor for the flats. This was quite common for council estates but is a bit strange along a main road.\n\nAfter crossing the tracks L Elm Avenue\n\nR Lime Grove\n\nSoon after crossing Myrtle Road L into Warrender Park\n\nKeep to the left edge of the park (or go back there after walking around)\n\nWarrender Park is an other one of the planned parks set by the developer at regular distances. Like the other neighbourhood parks, it has much grass and a few lines of trees around the perimeter. There are two small beds with rose bushes near the entrance; like in Cavendish Recreation Ground, they look a bit scraggly.\n\nAt the end of the park, turn L and cross Myrtle Road into a public footpath . The footpath starts where Myrtle Road meets The Uplands (the continuation of the same road actually but there are clear signs)\n\nIgnore the first road you cross. On reaching the second road, R Park Way (do not cross the tracks)\n\nThere is a pleasant strip of greenery along most of Park Way until you reach a row of shops\n\nIf you have a bit of time left, you can continue ahead on Pembroke Road for a short distance. This gives you an opportunity to see the local Roman Catholic church. It is not spectacular but is worth comparing with the church you saw at the start of the walk in Harrow. Here, the style is clearly reminiscent of medieval Italian cloisters with a low, squat basilica. This is actually the style Roman Catholics found more appropriate in general, partly because it stressed the link with the Pope.\n\nNearly opposite the church, there is a small but well maintained recreation ground with box hedges and flower beds. Once you have enjoyed the place, come back to the traffic lights in order to go to the station. The station is on your right coming from the church, on your left if you did not go on the small detour\n\nTake Victoria Road to reach\n\nRUISLIP MANOR\n\nThe station opened in 1912 on the line built in 1904 but this was a bit premature as there was very little traffic until the 1930s.\n\nLooking at the bricks and at the shapes, I think the station building is a design from the 1930s, when it started to make sense to have a fully fledged station. It has certainly been influenced by Charles Holden who was responsible for the whole network, but the architect did not enjoy much designing stations when tracks were on an embankment like here as the shapes of the building would be overshadowed by the massive bridge and embankment. As a result, the boxy shapes are subdued and there is no convenient place to put large windows.\n\nCross under the tracks\n\nAfter the shopping parade R Shenley Avenue\n\nVery soon R into Shenley Park\n\nTurn L within the park as you are otherwise blocked by the tracks\n\nExit into Willow Grove\n\nShortly before the road turns L, take the marked public footpath R towards Ruislip station. I think you cannot access the station directly; you will have to climb the stairs at the end of the path and take the main road bridge over the tracks. The station is easy to see from the bridge.\n\nRUISLIP\n\nThe station opened together with the train line in 1904.\n\nThe station building does not look at all like an Underground station and would feel perfectly appropriate on a suburban train line in the southern suburbs. It is indeed the original design from 1904 at a time when the Metropolitan operated more like a suburban railway who just happened to own an underground line in central London. The valance over the porch and the window surroundings are painted white, contrasting strikingly with the subdued grey brick walls. This was a very popular style in Edwardian times.\n\nMETROPOLITAN LINE WALK 3\n\nWEMBLEY PARK walk to HARROW-ON-THE-HILL\n\n2 1/2 hours\n\nThe Metropolitan Railway operated originally a train line between London main line termini. It decided to compete with long-distance train companies and built a train line between a new terminus at Baker Street and market towns like Harrow, Watford and Amersham. When the line opened in 1880, it was crossing rural areas and no stops were considered necessary between London and Harrow. Intermediary stops were created later for the Metropolitan line, turning it into a suburban service, while a long-distance company continues to use the tracks without stops between its London terminus (Marylebone, close to Baker Street) and Harrow.\n\nRouting note: This route connects at Wembley Park with Metropolitan line walk 2 and with Jubilee line walk 3. It connects in Harrow with Metropolitan line walks 4 and 6.\n\nWEMBLEY PARK\n\nThere was no stop here when the line was opened in 1880 between London and Harrow. The Underground station opened in 1894 when an amusement park was built here by the chairman of the company as a separate commercial venture (therefore “park”). The grounds were re-used in 1924 for the British Empire Exhibition and are now the core of the stadium precinct. An additional branch opened in 1932 towards Stanmore (now the Jubilee line).\n\nThe original station building was replaced in the 1940s by a new structure because of the increasing traffic expected for the 1948 London Olympics. The station building is a plain brick building with just two small gables showing the train company logo. This was a style considered appropriate in the suburbs built in the 1930s, reminding more of a cottage than of a public building.\n\nWhen Wembley Stadium was rebuilt and considerably extended in 2007, it was obvious that the old station building would not be able to accommodate the expected crowds and a new access was built. The glass and steel awning at the top of a particularly grand staircase was designed in a style reminding of the stadium with a lattice of thin steel tubes painted white.\n\nTake the station exit on Bridge Road (not the main exit towards Wembley Stadium)\n\nL on Bridge Road\n\nAhead Barn Hill\n\nBarn Hill is a very good example of the suburban developments of the 1920s advertised as Metroland. Being the first suburban railway company authorised by Parliament, the Metropolitan Railway had managed to insert a clause that it was allowed to retain the land it did not need directly for the line construction. When the booming economy drew many people into the London suburbs after World War I, the company decided to develop the land it had kept idle for half a century. Technically, the developer was an independent company, but the owners and managers were the same.\n\nTargeting the lower middle class that was looking for houses with gardens that could be financed with the growing availability of reasonably cheap mortgages, the company advertised heavily for new suburbs, extolling the quiet, the greenery, the clean air and the nostalgic details on the houses such as decorative wooden beams (the “mock-Tudor” style). This was extremely successful. You get a very good feeling for the typical Metroland suburb in the middle section of Barn Hill with identical, prim houses. In the upper section, the houses are larger and the road becomes a narrow lane lined with trees, which is a more upmarket version.\n\nThe Metroland suburbs were criticised heavily after World War II for having empty streets and no sense of community. Indeed, the boroughs were left with awkward plots for public buildings away from the core of the developments and very few parks were provided as all houses had gardens. In addition, residents had to walk long distances to shops and stations with bus services being difficult to organise due to the street layout so that using a car became unavoidable and made life less convenient than planned for commuters.\n\nAt the end ahead on a public footpath across Barn Hill Open Space, passing a pond at the top of the hill\n\nThis is the only large open space in a large portion of Metroland. It was a farm until it was bought in 1927 in order to prevent development. The railway had not been able to buy it because it really could not argue that it might need this land for the construction of the line. Like other hilltops in London, it was an important site in antiquity and there is evidence that some of the paths date back to Saxon times. Barn Hill is set apart from most hilltops in that it has a pond on the summit, a rather illogical occurrence.\n\nAhead down the hill towards the footbridge over the tracks\n\nYou can see on my picture that the public footpath appears in a slightly different shade of green on the ground. This is due to the fact that trampled grass regenerates differently, with the ground being more packed and retaining humidity here (in some other cases, the path is more barren due to the packed ground draining water faster). The view north is over the core of Metroland towards wooded hills that mark the edge of London.\n\nThe path continues along a small open space and merges into May Lane\n\nThe open space on this side of the tracks is a small neighbourhood park used for sports.\n\nAt the end L The Mall (a road)\n\nAhead Preston Hill\n\nAhead down Woodcock Hill\n\nL Silverholme Close\n\nAhead on the path across Tenterden Sports Grounds\n\nThis is again a neighbourhood sports grounds. It is located very close to an Underground station but was not developed in the 1920s. I guess the railway company intended first to keep it and develop it into valuable commercial properties at a later point in time, but it might also have been needed as reserve land in case the company would need additional technical facilities for the railway.\n\nThe path merges at the end into Preston Waye\n\nAt the end R Preston Road\n\nPRESTON ROAD\n\nThe station opened in 1908 under the cumbersome name “Preston Road halt for Uxendon and Kenton”, the halt being necessary to serve sports facilities used in the 1908 London Olympics. Increasing real estate development justified keeping the station opened but the name was simplified.\n\nThe station access is surprising, it is just a porch within a suburban shopping parade from 1931. It is interesting to compare such a parade with shopping streets from the 1960s (shops with large glass windows reached by a pedestrian passage protected from cars) or the 1990s (individual big stores set in the middle of huge car parks). As people would have to buy groceries every day because they seldom had refrigerators, shops would be located conveniently at the exit of the Underground on the way home.\n\nJust after crossing the tracks R into Grasmere Avenue\n\nSoon L Longfield Avenue\n\nSoon R Glendale Gardens\n\nAt the end L College Road\n\nR Carlton Avenue\n\nR into Preston Park Recreation Ground\n\nThe park is a typical neighbourhood park with sports facilities, grass and trees. The size of the park is quite typical for Metroland, with the developer planning such a park about every 2/3 mile. This shows that walking about 15 minutes to a place such as a shop, a school, a station or a park was considered normal. We have got much more comfortable, with many people using their cars if the walk is longer than 3 minutes.\n\nExit the park on the western side near the pavilion and the tennis courts\n\nR Montpelier Rise\n\nSoon L on a marked public footpath leading to Allonby Gardens\n\nAt the end R Windermere Avenue\n\nThe road passes a pub just near the station. In this case, there is no shopping parade near the station, just a pub. This is because it is a minor station added on an existing line; there is an other station with many convenience shops quite close nearby. The architecture of the pub is an interesting style rarely chosen for pubs. It has simple shapes and many windows, a typical Art Déco feature from the 1930s, but the gables in the Dutch Renaissance style are very unusual for that period. Pubs normally are built very differently, trying to attract customers with a touch of countryside nostalgy (flower pots, wooden beams, old signs) and to retain them inside by having few windows (you are therefore not aware that it is already much later than planned).\n\nSoon L under the tracks using the underpass for South Kenton station. This is one of very few locations in London suburbs where two Underground lines cross without an interchange. Normally, lines were designed a little like a star radiating from central London in order to serve different suburbs and avoid unprofitable competition. This is also the reason why Underground lines were seldom allowed in areas already well served by existing trains. The Metropolitan Railway came away in this case with the argument that Harrow was badly served by the existing line (now the Bakerloo line).\n\nThe underpass leads to The Link\n\nR Nathans Road\n\nEnter Northwick Park and turn L keeping along the edge of the park\n\nThis flat area is part of the very large expanse of Northwick Park. This is former farm land bought by Harrow school in 1905 in order to prevent development in close vicinity of this particularly exclusive institution. The borough bought additional land in 1936 to add to the original park. It is not really a park, more a wide open space used for sports.\n\nThe path reaches soon a paved access road (The Fairway)\n\nR towards the car park\n\nAhead on a track called Proyers Path\n\nThe track ends at the station\n\nNORTHWICK PARK\n\nThe station opened in 1923 on the existing line under the name “Northwick Park & Kenton” and the name was shortened in 1937.\n\nBecause the station was built long after the tracks, it is squeezed between the tracks on the top of the embankment and the station building is actually a brick shed on the platform, reminding much more of a suburban train line than of London Underground. The access is very modest but looked a bit better originally before the windows on both sides of the entrance were bricked up.\n\nTurn around, going back a few yards on Proyers Path\n\nThe path forks soon. Take the smaller path along the edge of the open space and the University building fence\n\nThis university campus belongs surprisingly to the University of Westminster, the main campus of which is located logically in the borough of Westminster. Actually not far from Euston train terminus, where it could be built on open land back in the 1840s. It was a polytechnic (an institution delivering a national degree, a little like French universities, rather than an institution having to rely on its stand-alone reputation) and became very quickly leading in scientific and engineering specialties. The Harrow campus was built much later for the media, arts and design courses. There is apparently a campus gallery showing contemporary art but I was not aware of it and it is difficult to reach from my route because of the fences.\n\nAfter leaving the open space, turn R on the footpath between the University of Westminster and an hospital access road\n\nThe hospital was an important project that enabled the NHS to close an outdated site in Central London in 1970. By now, the buildings are clearly outdated and an inspection body found a large number of significant issues to criticise in 2016. The architecture is particularly ugly, reflecting the budget constraints at the time of construction.\n\nAt the end L Watford Road\n\nCross this dangerous road at the next traffic light. The start of the next public footpath is well signposted near the lights. Take the path across Harrow School Playing Fields (more precisely between Upper Redding Field and Ducker Fields)\n\nYou are starting here to cross a very special place. Harrow School is one of the most renowned, most exclusive and most expensive schools in Britain. It looks back proudly to being founded in 1572 and accepts only boys, dressing them in 19th century uniforms and expecting them to behave like public school boys – we had better not look too closely into the pranks and experiences the boys gather over the years, particularly at night in the boarding houses… The large size of the sports fields is partly due to the fact that education in Britain includes a lot of sports, but also specifically to the fact that the school has many boarders who need to be occupied in a sensible manner after normal school courses.\n\nThe track leads uphill towards the school buildings. Ignore the car parks and turn R a little later into marked “public footpath no. 59 to Peterborough Road”, called also Music Hill\n\nThe path turns into a minor road further up the hill, this is now Football Lane\n\nThe school built many independent buildings over the year and is one of few schools of such standing that cannot prevent you from walking across the grounds due to the numerous public footpaths towards the parish church. I was interested by the sculpture that stands on your left while you climb Football Lane. The standing stones remind a lot of megalithic sites.\n\nOpposite the standing stones, the small building with a large stained glass window framed by a neo-classical design is obviously devoted to arts. It must be a 19th century pavilion and imitates Italian Renaissance palaces with roundels depicting celebrities. The buildings were obviously built over time in contemporary fashion without paying much attention to the existing ones, but neo-gothic is overall the main style because the late 19th century was the heyday of public schools in terms of financial resources.\n\nAt the end L further uphill, walking past a chapel and ornate stairs\n\nFrom the crossroads, you can enter the front garden of the most elegant building of the school, the Old Speech Room built in 1821 and extended in 1876. Part of the complex houses a collection of items of museum quality but I don’t think you can visit this unless by special appointment. The collection is primarily used for teaching purposes.\n\nAnother part of the building is a very grand Victorian hall used to train students to hold speeches – a sensible idea if many of your pupils can be expected to be Members of Parliament and influential businessmen later on. From outside, the building is not really neo-gothic and the style is closer to that of Elizabethan manors, trying to connect with the times when the school was founded.\n\nThe garden around the hall is very well kept as the school can afford professional gardeners. The most interesting item is a fountain with brass boulders. I have not checked whether these ones can actually turn; there was a fashion for a time in the 1980s with large boulder fountains, the water making it possible to move the boulder. The scheme became less popular later on due to the cost of pumping water. There might also have been issues with children climbing on the boulder, slipping and potentially getting hurt.\n\nAfter the stairs R up Church Hill\n\nL through the lychgate in order to reach the church\n\nThe parish church of St Mary’s is one of the most venerable churches in the London suburbs and lies in a privileged location in a wooded churchyard at the top of the hill.\n\nThe view extends up to 15 miles towards Canary Wharf, Crystal Palace and Windsor although it is usually easier to identify Heathrow Airport.\n\nSome of the walls go back to the 13th century "
