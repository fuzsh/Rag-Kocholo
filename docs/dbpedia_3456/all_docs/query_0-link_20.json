        "text": "Ready to travel fast? Before every Top Sight Tour be sure to have a topped up Oyster card that will give you access to all the sights of the city! Below are facts about train stations that offer a historic view of London, and also act as travel hubs for tourists and commuters alike. See if your local is on the list!\n\nActon Town\n\nAlphabetically, the first tube station on the network!\n\nAldgate\n\nIs built directly on top of a vast plague pit, where 1000’s of bodies are apparently buried. No-one knows quite how many.\n\nAldgate East\n\nWhile engineers worked on lowering the track level, trains kept running as the existing line was precariously suspended on wooden trestles from the ceiling.\n\nAlperton\n\nHas the only remaining wooden escalators on the network, bricked up behind a wall.\n\nAmersham\n\nThe highest station on the network, at a solid 147m above sea level.\n\nAngel\n\nHas the Underground’s longest escalator at 60m/197ft, with a vertical rise of 27.5m. In fact, they’re the 4th longest in Western Europe.\n\nArchway\n\nHidden in the green & cream tiling pattern at Archway station, there are black arches.\n\nArnos Grove\n\nThe design of the station – which is Grade II listed – was inspired by the Stockholm Public Library.\n\nArsenal\n\nThe only station in the UK named after a football team.\n\nBaker Street\n\nHas the most platforms of any tube station – 10\n\nBalham\n\nBalham is the only Underground station that doesn’t have any of the letters of the word ‘underground’ in it.\n\nBank\n\nHas the most entrances/exits of any tube station with 12.\n\nBarbican\n\nThe tube’s first rail disaster happened here – 4 people died in 1866 and the trains were running again within half an hour.\n\nBarking\n\nCurrently has a direct freight service running 7,500 miles direct to & from the city of Yiwu, on China’s east coast.\n\nBarkingside\n\nIs the only station on the network with an ornate, medieval-style Hammerbeam Roof (usually only used in great halls or cathedrals).\n\nBarons Court\n\nMahatma Gandhi lived at 20 Barons Court Road, a few yards from the station, while studying law.\n\nBayswater\n\nWas originally called Queen’s Road (Bayswater), but the name was changed to avoid confusion with Queensway, which was also called Queen’s Road. And the kicker? There is no Queen’s Road in Kensington.\n\nBecontree\n\nWhen Beacontree was first built in the interwar period, it was the largest housing estate in the world – and a railway station was built specifically for it.\n\nBelsize Park\n\nBelsize Park has a sign claiming that the stairs have 219 steps, but there are actually 189.\n\nBermondsey\n\nIs a perfect anagram of “Snob Remedy”.\n\nBethnal Green\n\nIn Anglo Saxon, Bethnal Green literally means “happy corner”.\n\nBlackfriars\n\nIn January 2014 the Blackfriars Railway Bridge became the world’s largest solar-powered bridge, having been covered with 4,400 photovoltaic panels providing up to half of the energy for the station.\n\nBlackhorse Road\n\nDespite the black horses depicted in station murals, it’s actually named after a nearby black house.\n\nBond Street\n\nHarry Selfridge drew up proposals for a direct subway connecting the station to his store, and for the station to be renamed ‘Selfridges’. The proposals were declined.\n\nBorough\n\nAs an architectural shortcut, it was essentially a replica of Kennington station when it was first built.\n\nBoston Manorr\n\nThanks to its Art Deco design, the station appeared on a postage stamp in 2013.\n\nBounds Green\n\nName-dropped in the lyrics to Has it Come to This? by The Streets.\n\nBow Road\n\nThe steepest gradient on the tube network at 3.6%. Insanity.\n\nBrent Cross\n\nBrent Cross station was named after the shopping centre when it opened nearby in 1976, not the other way around.\n\nBrixton\n\nThere’s a mural in the station of a pyramid of bricks, which is a visual pun of a ton of bricks (or a ‘bricks ton’).\n\nBromley-by-Bow\n\nIn EastEnders, the fictional Walford East tube station takes the place of Bromley-by-Bow.\n\nBuckhurst Hill\n\nThe only through station in zones 1 to 6 on the Underground to be in a zone on its own – passengers travelling from the station leaving in either direction must cross a zone boundary.\n\nBurnt Oak\n\nThe first ever Tesco was opened just down the road from the station, in 1929. The tins had no labels to keep cost down.\n\nCaledonian Road\n\nNamed after an asylum for Scottish children built nearby in 1828. Not as in mentalasylum, but as in safe asylum. To be clear.\n\nCamden Town\n\nBecause the station is so busy at weekends, they’re planning on rebuilding it, and demolishing Camden Market in the process (don’t panic though, that doesn’t include the Stables Market, The Lock Market, the Inverness Street market, etc.).\n\nCanada Water\n\nDesigned by the same architect as the Millennium Dome. Who was clearly copying his own homework.\n\nCanary Wharf\n\nThe busiest station to serve a single line, and it’s had at least one wedding celebrated in it.\n\nCanning Town\n\nThere was another Canning Town station north of Barking road, but when the DLR came along, instead of adding a platform to the existing station, they simply demolished the whole thing and built a new one from scratch.\n\nCannon Street\n\nThe name first appears as ‘Candelwrichstrete Street’ in 1190. The name was shortened over 60 times, and eventually settled on Cannon Street in the 17th century. It is therefore not related to the firearms.\n\nCanons Park\n\nNamed after Cannons, a vast house built on the site in 1724 at the cost of £28m (adjusted for inflation). It was demolished and sold off brick by brick 20 years later. And therefore not related to the firearms, either.\n\nChalfont & Latimer\n\nThe longest single journey between neighbouring stations: 9 mins on average to Chesham.\n\nChalk Farm\n\nThe Roundhouse next door used to be a railway turntable servicing the station.\n\nChancery Lane\n\nIn the ’70s, the former air raid shelter built underneath the station was turned into a telephone exchange with 200 staff, its own restaurant, bar, and games room, all 200ft below the surface.\n\nCharing Cross\n\nModern day Charing Cross is an amalgamation of two old stations: Trafalgar Square and Strand.\n\nChesham\n\nFurthest away from any other station, at 3.8mi to the nearest neighbour.\n\nChigwell\n\nServes the town of Chigwell, which Charles Dickens described as “the greatest place in the world”.\n\nChiswick Park\n\nOnce known as Acton Green – the name was changed due to there being 7 other Acton stations already.\n\nChorleywood\n\nThe name literally means “peasant’s wood” (and currently has one of the highest qualities of life in the country).\n\nClapham Common\n\nFor 2 weeks in September 2016, all of the adverts used in the station were replaced by photos of cats.\n\nClapham North\n\nWas the test site for the UK’s first underground farm, housed in its deep level bomb shelter. The company now grows food under Clapham High Street.\n\nClapham South\n\nThe station was originally to have been called ‘Nightingale Lane’ and this name still exists hidden behind the blue bars on the platform roundels.\n\nCockfosters\n\nBeing the final/first station on the line, it has a tunnel designed to mirror the one at Uxbridge at the opposing end of the line.\n\nColindale\n\nWas frequently used by T.E. Lawrence (AKA Lawrence of Arabia), who used the pen name ‘Colin Dale’ during his journalistic career.\n\nColliers Wood\n\nThe pub opposite is named after the architect who designed the station itself, Charles Holden. In fact, he designed a great many stations in his time.\n\nCovent Garden\n\nLondon Underground’s standard £4.80 single cash fare for the journey between here and Leicester Square equates to £29.81 a mile, making the fare for this particular journey more expensive per mile than the Orient Express.\n\nCroxley\n\nA story is told of how a year after the opening of the station in 1926, a group of ladies was directed to it by Croxley’s policeman P.C. Haggar. He bade them a cheery “Good-night” – to learn shortly afterwards that they were a band of suffragettes who had set fire to the new station.\n\nDagenham East\n\nWas the site of a rail crash in 1958 due to fog – and the train that caused it is still active on the Severn Valley Railway.\n\nDagenham Heathway\n\nDespite being smaller, and having fewer platforms, gets twice the number of passengers per year as Dagenham East.\n\nDebden\n\nDebden station was the setting for the Victorian ballad “The Chigwell Stationmaster’s Wife”. Not Chigwell.\n\nDollis Hill\n\nDollis Hill played a part in the Second World War, as the code-breaking computer used at Bletchley Park was built here.\n\nEaling Broadway\n\nPlatforms 8 & 9 still contain some of the pre-roundel logo designs.\n\nEaling Common\n\nHas a heptagonal ticket hall, one of only two on the network.\n\nEarl’s Court\n\nThe site of the last remaining blue police telephone box – radios took over in the 1970s.\n\nEast Acton\n\nNot actually in the borough of Acton, it just took the name to be part of the trend – there are seven Acton stations on the network.\n\nEast Finchley\n\nJerry Springer was born in the station during an air raid in WW2.\n\nEast Ham\n\nBetween 1851 when the station wan built, and 1911, East Ham’s population grew by 7585%.\n\nEast Putney\n\nOn 1 April 1994, it was sold to London Underground for the princely sum of £1.\n\nEastcote\n\nWas originally called Ascot.\n\nEdgware\n\nWas supposed to connect to Mill Hill East, and you can still see the disused track that leads to it…\n\nEdgware Road\n\nHas a “living wall” wall of plants outside the station, the only one in the underground network.\n\nElephant & Castle\n\nNamed after a nearby pub, which itself was name-dropped in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.\n\nElm Park\n\nCelebrations to mark the opening of the station in 1935 included a performance by the Dagenham Girl Pipers – they performed in Nazi Germany around the same time, and Hitler is said to have remarked: “I wish I had a band like that.”\n\nEmbankment\n\nHas a huge, empty substation attached to it, abandoned since 1957. Called ‘Pages Walk’ it’s behind a blast door in the station, and is so large it’s been proposed as a possible nightclub location.\n\nEpping\n\nHas the largest public London Underground station car park with 519 spaces. It’s usually still full by around 6.30am each day though.\n\nEuston\n\nHas a bench made from 450million year old stone outside of it.\n\nEuston Square\n\nWas the place that the very first piece of work on the underground – or any underground railway on earth – took place. A shaft was sunk in January 1860 there.\n\nFairlop\n\nThe only tube station named after a tree. Apart from, technically Burnt Oak.\n\nFarringdon\n\nOriginally designed to transport livestock to Smithfield market – there are still cattle ramps onto the street West Smithfield for this purpose.\n\nFinchley Central\n\nHas an original copy of the Harry Beck Tube map on display; he lived nearby and used the station frequently.\n\nFinchley Road\n\nAnalysis of earth removed when tunnelling towards the station revealed that its site was the southern limit of a glacier which covered Britain in one of the Ice Ages.\n\nFinsbury Park\n\nDue to confusion with popular duelling site Finsbury Field, when it opened the station was decorated with mosaics of duelling pistols. They’re still there today.\n\nFulham Broadway\n\nIt’s the station in 1998’s Sliding Doors where reality changes because of a missed train.\n\nGants Hill\n\nThe easternmost station to be entirely below ground on the London Underground network.\n\nGloucester Road\n\nHas a disused platform that’s used as a permanent art exhibition. (…Technically making it a used platform?)\n\nGolders Green\n\nWas the last station on the Northern line to retain semaphore signals, replaced in 1950.\n\nGoldhawk Road\n\nThe line running through Goldhawk Road station was active as early as 1864, yet no station opened there until 1914.\n\nGoodge Street\n\nNot actually on Goodge Street – it’s closer to both Tottenham Street and Whitfield Street.\n\nGrange Hill\n\nDestroyed by a V1 “doodlebug” bomb during WW2.\n\nGreat Portland Street\n\nDespite having three lines run through it, it only has one pair of tracks, making it one of the most intensely used parts of the network.\n\nGreen Park\n\nNamed after the park, which itself is said to have originally been a swampy burial ground for lepers from nearby St James’ hospital.\n\nGreenford\n\nUsed its original, century-old wooden escalator right up until 2014.\n\nGunnersbury\n\nOn 8 December 1954 the station was damaged by a tornado which ripped off the roof and injured six people.\n\nHainault\n\nThe lifts are the shallowest on the London Underground network, having a descent of just 0.67 metres.\n\nHammersmith\n\nTechnically, it’s two stations – one District/Piccadilly, one Hammersmith & City/Circle. And to get from one to the other without walking would require a minimum of 10 stops and 3 changes.\n\nHampstead\n\nThe deepest station on the line, at 58m below ground – that’s more than Nelson’s Column.\n\nHanger Lane\n\nIn a reversal of most other stations, it has to be entered underground, but the station itself is entirely above ground.\n\nHarlesden\n\nIs almost twice as far away from Harlesden town centre as Willesden Junction is.\n\nHarrow & Wealdstone\n\nTechnically the oldest station on the network: the mainline station was built in 1837, predating Baker Street by 24 years. It was opened for Underground trains in 1917.\n\nHarrow-on-the-Hill\n\nIt’s actually on Green Hill, north of Harrow Hill.\n\nHatton Cross\n\nOn its opening in 1975, Hatton Cross was one of 279 active stations on the London Underground, the highest ever total; the number of stations in the network has since decreased to 270.\n\nHeathrow Terminal 4\n\nIt is the only station on the network to have one-way train service.\n\nHeathrow Terminal 5\n\nDespite being underground, the ceiling is made from laminate panels, allowing natural daylight to illuminate it.\n\nHeathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3\n\nBack when it opened in 1977, it was the first time that an airport had been directly served by an underground railway system.\n\nHendon Central\n\nWhen it was first built, the station was surrounded by fields – the town was essentially constructed around it.\n\nHigh Barnet\n\nIs situated on the hill that’s thought to be the inspiration for the nursery rhyme The Grand Old Duke of York.\n\nHigh Street Kensington\n\nOnce had a waiting room for passengers who didn’t fancy the platform. This was changed into a break room for drivers.\n\nHighbury & Islington\n\nDespite being hit by a V-1 flying bomb during WW2, the original station building stayed in use until it was demolished in 1960.\n\nHighgate\n\nThe disused platforms and tunnels have sometimes been used for filming and have appeared in several productions including the feature film Paperhouse, and the television series EastEnders and Waking the Dead.\n\nHillingdon\n\nThe name Hillingdon is Middle English, and means “Hill’s hill”.\n\nHolborn\n\nWas used to store British Museum treasures during WW2. A newspaper even offered a cash reward to anyone who dared spend the night there in the 60s amid rumours of a mummy ghost – nobody took them up on it.\n\nHolland Park\n\nBuilt with a flat roof in order for a retail unit to be built on top of it. 115 years later, there is still no retail unit.\n\nHolloway Road\n\nUsed to have a spiral escalator (which is now stored in the Acton depot).\n\nHornchurch\n\nIn the 80 years since the station was built, Hornchurch’s population increased by x43 times.\n\nHounslow Central\n\nReplaced Hounslow Town tube station, which was open for just three years.\n\nHounslow East\n\nIn the 1700s, the nearby heath was notorious for successful Highwaymen – which is a neat coincidence, because Hounslow East is a perfect anagram for ‘outlaws shone’.\n\nHounslow West\n\nDue to the nearby military barracks, Winston Churchill used to frequent this station.\n\nHyde Park Corner\n\nThe station is located entirely underground, with no surface presence – though there is an old station building that has since been used as a pizza restaurant and a hotel. The lifts from that building are now ventilation shafts.\n\nIckenham\n\nSaid to be haunted each Christmas since the ’50s by a woman in a red scarf, who was electrocuted there. She flails her arms, apparently.\n\nKennington\n\nStay on a terminating Northern line train heading south at Kennington and you’ll go round in a loop, arriving back at Kennington and heading north. People who are drunk/asleep have been known to end up in Edgware, rather than in Morden.\n\nKensal Green\n\nIn December 2006, the station was hit (or at least grazed) by a tornado.\n\nKensington (Olympia)\n\nThe station’s old name, ‘Addison Road Station’ still appears sculpted into a wall on the eastern pedestrian exit.\n\nKentish Town\n\nThere used to be a South Kentish Town tube station down the road. It became disused after strike action from the power station supplying it caused it to shut down, and they simply never re-opened it, even when the power came back on.\n\nKenton\n\nBoth Kenton, Kennington, and Kensington are, by total coincidence, derived from the same name – Keninton.\n\nKew Gardens\n\nThe Tube’s track is crossed by Kew Gardens Station Footbridge, a Grade II listed feature in its own right – it was designed specifically to prevent smoke from steam trains getting into people’s clothing.\n\nKilburn\n\nAt the turn of the 20th Century the station was going to be replaced with “a type of subterranean monorail roller coaster”, but plans were (sadly) abandoned.\n\nKilburn Park\n\nThe first station to be designed around escalators, rather than lifts.\n\nKing’s Cross St. Pancras\n\nHas the shortest lift shaft on the network, at just 2.3 metres\n\nKingsbury\n\nWas originally on the Metropolitan Line, before being transferred to the Bakerloo Line, and finally landing on the Jubilee Line.\n\nKnightsbridge\n\nSuffered huge congestion problems, which were solved when they built an exit specifically for Harrods.\n\nLadbroke Grove\n\nWas originally called Notting Hill, but the name was changed to avoid confusion with Notting Hill Gate. There’s now a movement to change the name to Portobello Road, despite the fact that it’s not on Portobello Road. It’s on Ladbroke Grove.\n\nLambeth North\n\nHas been called Kennington Road, Westminster Bridge Road, and finally Lambeth North.\n\nLancaster Gate\n\nDespite its name, the station is close to the Marlborough Gate entrance to Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens, about 300m to the east of the Lancaster Gate entrance.\n\nLatimer Road\n\nIs actually located half a kilometer away from Latimer Road.\n\nLeicester Square\n\nOn all four platforms, film sprockets are painted down the entire length and on the top and bottom of the display area (blue on the Piccadilly line platforms, and black on the Northern line platforms), due to the four premiere cinemas in Leicester Square.\n\nLeyton\n\nIs home to one of the most accident-prone stretches of the Underground network: the line between Leyton & Stratford has had several fatal crashes, including one in 1953 in which 12 people died, the worst accident on the tube at the time.\n\nLeytonstone\n\nFeatures 17 mosaics of Alfred Hitchcock films & famous moments.\n\nLiverpool Street\n\nBuilt on the original site of the Bethlehem (Bedlam) mental asylum.\n\nLondon Bridge\n\nIs the only station on the entire London Underground network with the word “London” in its name.\n\nLoughton\n\nThe station was originally built so that City workers would have easy access to Epping Forest.\n\nMaida Vale\n\nWhen Maida Vale station opened on 6 June 1915 it was entirely staffed by women due to shortages of male staff in the war.\n\nManor House\n\nOf its street-level entrances, three are in Hackney, and one is in Haringey.\n\nMansion House\n\nHas all five vowels in its name.\n\nMarble Arch\n\nThe marble arch opposite the station was originally going to be the entrance to Buckingham Palace.\n\nMarylebone\n\nVery nearly wasn’t built because it might have disturbed the cricket played at Lords. It took an act of parliament to finally push construction through.\n\nMile End\n\nIs named so because it’s exactly one mile from the eastern boundary of The City of London.\n\nMill Hill East\n\nFeatures a viaduct in which trains travel 18m above ground – the highest point on the Underground network.\n\nMonument\n\nIts original name, Eastcheap, lasted precisely one month before it was changed to Monument.\n\nMoor Park\n\nHas a “secret” unmarked entrance adjacent to a golf course.\n\nMoorgate\n\nHas a virtually unknown second underground network/line which starts here – the Northern City Line runs from Moorgate to Finsbury Park, and is’t run by TFL.\n\nMorden\n\nIs the start of the longest tunnel on the Underground network, running 27.8 kilometres (17.3 mi) to East Finchley via the Bank branch.\n\nMornington Crescent\n\nIs the subject of a deliberately incomprehensible gameshow on BBC Radio 4, in which there are no rules.\n\nNeasden\n\nThe Tube celebrated its centenary here in 1963 with a series of events including a parade of underground trains.\n\nNewbury Park\n\nThe bus shelter attached to it is Grade II listed. The station isn’t.\n\nNorth Acton\n\nStation staff regularly participate in Transport for London’s annual Underground in Bloom competition, and in 2010 won first prize in the Fruit and Vegetable category, for their sweetcorn and strawberries.\n\nNorth Ealing\n\nIs not actually north of Ealing, but east of it.\n\nNorth Greenwich\n\nDespite its name, it is not in the area historically known as North Greenwich, on the Isle of Dogs, north of the River Thames; an entirely different North Greenwich station used to be there, between 1872 and 1926.\n\nNorth Harrow\n\nHas been awarded the “Best Customer Service” trophy at the London Transport Awards – no surprise, the station master is called James Bond.\n\nNorth Wembley\n\nThe safest tube station on the entire network, according to the MET.\n\nNorthfields\n\nThe 5th president of the US, John Quincey Adams lived next to the site of the station for two years.\n\nNortholt\n\nNorthala park next door features four man-made hills, constructed from the waste rubble of Wembley stadium.\n\nNorthwick Park\n\nIs only 350m from Kenton station, making it the closest tube station pair outside zone 1.\n\nNorthwood\n\nIs actually at a higher level than Northwood Hills.\n\nNorthwood Hills\n\nBefore it opened in 1933, there was a competition to name it. This was, apparently, the winning entry, despite the station being lower than Northwood.\n\nNotting Hill Gate\n\nThe reason it’s called Notting Hill Gate is because it was literally a gate: it used to be a toll road.\n\nOakwood\n\nThe booking hall originally had a plaque claiming that the station occupied ‘the highest point in Europe in a direct line west of the Ural Mountains of Russia’, which is a very strange way of saying that it’s 300 feet above sea level.\n\nOld Street\n\nIt’s buried in soil so acidic that the cast iron tunnel linings had to be replaced in the ’90s due to corrosion.\n\nOsterley\n\nThis building replaced the earlier Osterley & Spring Grove station, 300 metres away, which is now Osterley Bookshop. Inside the bookshop the archway to the platforms is still visible, but blocked off, and the platforms behind are still in place.\n\nOval\n\nThe first railway station to employ electrified tracks in London.\n\nOxford Circus\n\nIn 1969, to celebrate the opening of the new Victoria Line, The Queen ‘took the wheel’ of a train, and drove it from Green Park to Oxford Circus.\n\nPaddington\n\nThe track running towards Bayswater passes under 23-24 Leinster Road – a facade constructed to match neighbouring terrace houses. disguising where the original house was demolished to allow a gap in the tube system for steam trains to er …let off steam.\n\nPark Royal\n\nThe station plaforms aren’t actually level – they slope up from south to north.\n\nParsons Green\n\nIs an anagram of “passenger ron”.\n\nPerivale\n\nIs an anagram of “rail peve”.\n\nPiccadilly Circus\n\nA world map in the station ticket hall, dating from the 1920s, contains a linear clock that shows the time in all parts of the world.\n\nPimlico\n\nOriginally named after Ben Pimlico, a Hoxton brewer famous for his nut brown ale. It was so insanely popular with the residents of Pimlico, the place became named after him.\n\nPinner\n\nIn 2009, a Pyrenean Mountain Dog named Rufus became a minor celebrity for his daily commute from Pinner to Baker Street due to his enormous size.\n\nPlaistow\n\nPrior to the station being put in, Plaistow was “a whole day’s coach ride” to Westminster. Afterwards, it took less than half an hour.\n\nPreston Road\n\nWas originally named “Preston Road Halt for Uxendon and Kenton”, which would have made it easily the longest name on the line, and the only one with an actual instruction.\n\nPutney Bridge\n\nTechnically not in Putney – it’s on the Fulham side of the Thames.\n\nQueen’s Park\n\nThe site of the only “carriage shed” on the tube line: a wooden garden shed-like tunnel that you pass through on the northward part of your journey.\n\nQueensbury\n\nThe name Queensbury did not, when it was chosen, refer to any pre-existing area. It was coined by analogy with the adjacent Kingsbury station.\n\nQueensway\n\nNamed Queen’s Road originally (because Queen Victoria was born nearby), but people thought that ‘lacked distinctiveness’, so was changed.\n\nRavenscourt Park\n\nThe least Instagrammed station in London, with zero posts for the whole of 2016.\n\nRayners Lane\n\nWhen the station first opened, there was only one single house nearby, owned by a farmer named Daniel Rayner. The station was duly called Rayner’s Lane.\n\nRedbridge\n\nDuring WW2, the train tunnels at Redbridge were used as an aircraft parts factory.\n\nRegent’s Park\n\nA parliamentary law originally declared that no station could be built at the current site – it was overturned, but there’s still no surface station here.\n\nRichmond\n\nBuilt from Portland Stone – a Jurassic era limestone from Dorset used in the construction of Buckingham Palace, St. Paul’s Cathederal, and the UN Building in New York.\n\nRickmansworth\n\nIs a surprising hub for film locations: scenes for both Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Last Crusade were filmed literally two minutes north of the station, as well as Bridget Jones and the Edge of Reason, and Blackadder.\n\nRoding Valley\n\nThe quietest tube station on the line, each year transporting the same number of passengers as Waterloo does in one day.\n\nRoyal Oak\n\nNamed after a nearby pub (still there, but now called The Porchester).\n\nRuislip\n\nDue to the convoluted tracks, it’s actually possible to reverse trains here, but it takes up both platforms, so it’s not done at peak hours.\n\nRuislip Gardens\n\nThe station achieved poetic immortality in Poet Laureate John Betjeman’s poem Middlesex.\n\nRuislip Manor\n\nSuffered heavy aerial bombardment by the Luftwaffe during WW2, due to its proximity to RAF Northholt.\n\nRussell Square\n\nThe sign lists the number of steps as 175. There as in fact, 171. Quite why no-one double checked is a mystery.\n\nSeven Sisters\n\nNamed after seven elm trees which have stood in the neighbourhood since the 1730s. The current trees were planted by five families of seven sisters.\n\nShepherd’s Bush\n\nThe station has no lifts because, due to nearby utilities, they would cost £100m to install.

It crosses it via aquaduct.\n\nSouth Kensington\n\nBetween South Kensington and Knightsbridge, the tube steers away from following the road above it in order to avoid a large plague pit.\n\nSouth Kenton\n\nIts platform was built too high for the trains, and never corrected.\n\nSouth Ruislip\n\nThe concrete, glass and granite chip frieze in the booking hall is one of the earliest public works by glass artist, Henry Haig, who would go onto become one of Britain’s most revered stained glass artists.\n\nSouth Wimbledon\n\nOpening in 1926, the originally proposed name was Merton Grove, but it was renamed South Wimbledon to try and sound classier.\n\nSouth Woodford\n\nThe only station in which the name on the station’s own roundels is different to the official name – they call it South Woodford (George Lane).\n\nSouthfields\n\nThe station platform undergoes a makeover each year to coincide with the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Wimbledon station doesn’t.\n\nSouthgate\n\nWhen it first opened, local residents were given a free return ticket to Piccadilly Circus to encourage them to use the service.\n\nSouthwark\n\nSouthwark Station’s blue cone wall, built as part of the Jubilee line extension’s new generation of stations, was inspired by an 1816 stage set for The Magic Flute.\n\nSt. James’s Park\n\nIs a Grade 1 listed building, making station improvements considerably difficult.\n\nSt. John’s Wood\n\nFamously, the only station on the Underground network not to share any letters with the word “mackerel”.\n\nSt. Paul’s\n\nDuring the Second World War, the electricity grid control room for the entire of London and Southeast England was housed here, in the lift shaft.\n\nStamford Brook\n\nThe first tube station to have an automatic ticket barrier installed on 5 January 1964.\n\nStanmore\n\nWas a secret outstation for Bletchley Park during WW2 – in fact, the crosswords decorating the station house are a reference to the test WW2 codebreakers had to pass to qualify for consideration: completing the Times crossword in under 12minutes.\n\nStepney Green\n\nA Tudor-era bowling ball was unearthed during the Crossrail excavations under the station.\n\nStockwell\n\nJust below the station platforms, there is an air raid shelter comprised of two tunnels, both six times the length of the platrforms themselves. They’re currently used as a secure archive.\n\nStonebridge Park\n\nThe booking hall is the only original feature – the rest has been destroyed by WW2 boming, and two major fires.\n\nStratford\n\nHas the shortest escalator on the network, with a vertical rise of 4.1m.\n\nSudbury Hill\n\nThe station is said to have one of the highest levels of ‘pigeon customers’ in the whole London Underground network. Staff often have to chase large numbers of the birds out of the ticket hall.\n\nSudbury Town\n\nHas a barometer hanging above the ticket hall from the 1930s – in fact, it’s the only station with a barometer still in it.\n\nSwiss Cottage\n\nNamed after the nearby pub.\n\nTemple\n\nOn the columns at Temple station, there are small temple-shaped emblems at the bases.\n\nTheydon Bois\n\nIs the only part of Theydon Bois that has street lighting – the rest of the town has none in order to maintain ambiance.\n\nTooting Bec\n\nHas a crater on Mars named after it.\n\nTooting Broadway\n\nThe big statue of Edward VII at the entrance was paid for entirely by the public when it was made in 1911.\n\nTottenham Court Road\n\nWas originally called Oxford Street (before Oxford Circus opened).\n\nTottenham Hale\n\nHas been the site of no less than five collisions & derailments.\n\nTotteridge & Whetstone\n\nWas originally named ‘Whetstone and Totteridge’, owing to the fact that it is in Whetstone. But the name was switched, for reasons we still can’t tell.\n\nTower Hill\n\nKing Henry VIII beheaded noble traitors to the crown and two of his wives here. Not like, in the station, but next door to it.\n\nTufnell Park\n\nOn the service board at Tufnell Park station you’ll find ‘Poetry Corner’, the station staff’s daily selection of poetry by local residents, school children and famous poets, ‘giving passengers something to read while they’re waiting for the lifts’.\n\nTurnham Green\n\nWheeler’s Florist, based directly outside the station, has provided flowers for Bond & Batman movies. Which, apparently, had flowers in them.\n\nTurnpike Lane\n\nThe name ‘Turnpike Lane’ refers to a toll gate erected there in 1767. And of course, the tube barriers there now techincally are a toll gate, meaning the name is still accurate.\n\nUpminster\n\nThe speed of sound was first accurately measured from the church next to the station.\n\nUpminster Bridge\n\nDisplayed a swastika in its ticket hall when it was built in 1934. They took it down a few years later for some reason or another.\n\nUpney\n\nThe Gunpowder Plot was hatched in a manor house next to the station.\n\nUpton Park\n\nThe station’s name is cockney slang for crazy (because they’re ‘two stops short of Barking’).\n\nUxbridge\n\nBeing the final/first station on the line, has a tunnel designed to mirror the one at Cockfosters at the opposing end of the line.\n\nVauxhall\n\nThanks to the creamery next door, it used to run daily ‘milk trains’ entirely filled with the white stuff. They would pull into the station, and pour their contents into a dischrage pipe that led directly to the creamery.\n\nVictoria\n\nPlays a key role in Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest – the main character was discovered as a baby in a handbag in the station.\n\nWalthamstow Central\n\nOriginally called ‘Hoe Street’.\n\nWanstead\n\nThe tunnels between Wanstead and Gants Hill to the east were turned into munitions factories during WW2.\n\nWarren Street\n\nUsed as the location for the 1972 British horror film, Death Line, which featured a family of cannibals living on the London Underground.\n\nWarwick Avenue\n\nA song named after it by singer Duffy reached number 3 in the charts.\n\nWaterloo\n\nHas 23 escalators, the most of any station on the network.\n\nWatford\n\nDue to not being in the centre of town, has been threatened with closure since 1927. And it may well finally be closed in 2020.\n\nWembley Central\n\nDespite servicing Wembley Stadium, is only the 142nd busiest station on the line.\n\nWembley Park\n\nWas originally constructed to serve Wembley Pleasure Grounds, which were to be centrepieced by a tower taller than the Eiffel Tower.\n\nWest Acton\n\nThe original 1923 station was rebuilt by 1940 – and it’s now Grade II listed.\n\nWest Brompton\n\nThe Overground lines here were built in 1866 (before the district line) as part of the West London Line – which was closed between 1940 and 1999 due to WWII bombing.\n\nWest Finchley\n\nMade predominantly from fittings taken from other stations in the North of England. The bridge apparently came from Yorkshire.\n\nWest Ham\n\nHas more platforms (8) than Charing Cross (6).\n\nWest Hampstead\n\nWas originally known as “West End” until the name was changed in order to avoid confusion with, well, the West End.\n\nWest Harrow\n\nIs, perhaps ironically, the station people travel to in order to get to Britain’s biggest walking festival.\n\nWest Kensington\n\nBeing next to the Queen’s Club, it’s 5x closer to a grass court tennis court than Wimbledon station.\n\nWest Ruislip\n\nThe longest journey you can take without a change on the entire Underground network is the 37 miles from West Ruislip to Epping.\n\nWestbourne Park\n\nWas the first station to be demolished. It was relocated in 1871.\n\nWestminster\n\nExcavations for creating the deep level Jubilee line platforms caused Big Ben to move 35millimeters. Any more, and the tower would have cracked and possibly collapsed.\n\nWhite City\n\nThe architectural design of the station won an award at the 1951 Festival of Britain.\n\nWhitechapel\n\nWhitechapel is the only place on the network where the Overground runs below the Underground.\n\nWillesden Green\n\nWhen he was mayor, Ken Livingstone used to get the tube to work from here every day.\n\nWillesden Junction\n\nIn 1896 staff totalled 271, including 79 porters, 58 signalmen (in 14 signal boxes) and 58 shunters and yard foremen.\n\nWimbledon\n\nLaddie the Airedale Terrier was based at the station for six years, before retiring in 1956. During his time there, he collected £5,000 pounds in the change box on his back.\n\nWimbledon Park\n\nDespite being the closest station to the All England Club, is still closer to Wimbledon golf club than the tennis club.\n\nWood Green\n\nGets name-dropped in songs by Razorlight (Los Angeles Waltz), Mark Knopfler (Junkie Doll), Pablo Gad (Black Before Creation), and Sway DaSafo (Up Your Speed).\n\nWood Lane\n\nNewest station on the network, opened in October 2008.\n\nWoodford\n\nA wooden owl was put into the station’s rafters during recent refurbishment as a reference to the owl sanctuary nearby\n\nWoodside Park\n\nAlphabetically, the last name on the entire Tube network."
