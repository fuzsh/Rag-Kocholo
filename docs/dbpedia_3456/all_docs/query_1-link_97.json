If you're on the south side it's probably quickest Blackfriars-Farringdon-Paddington.\n\nDon't take the Circle all the way round.\n\n24 Mar 2015\n\n#7\n\ncookie365\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\n18 Oct 2013\n\nMessages\n\n114\n\nAh, good points both. Yes, I'm getting a Thameslink from the south coast, and it does stop at Elephant and Castle.\n\nThat might be the winning bid. And I might even get a seat too\n\nEdit: ah, just looked at the transfer from the NR to the Bakerloo stations, I might give E&C a miss and stay on the Thameslink to Farringdon\n\nLast edited: 24 Mar 2015\n\n27 Mar 2015\n\n#8\n\nNSE\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n3 Mar 2010\n\nMessages\n\n1,732\n\nThe interchange isn't as bad at the Elephant and Castle as it might look. It's\n\nPretty quick, through the shopping centre and down. It's not the nicest area mind, but it could be done in around five to eight minutes train to train. Rush hour i couldn't promise that though of course:P"
