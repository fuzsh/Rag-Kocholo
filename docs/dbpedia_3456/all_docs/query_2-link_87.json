        "text": "London stations\n\nLondon has over 330 train stations, with routes to all parts of Great Britain. Each London station has its own tube station (except Fenchurch Street, which is served by Tower Hill), and they all have connections to buses and taxis.\n\nTravelling to and from London\n\nIf you are travelling to or from London, your ticket will usually show London Terminals rather than a specific station. This is because your ticket may be valid at more than 1 London Terminal station, as long as it is on a reasonable route, using National Rail services.\n\nFor example, if you are travelling from Woking to London Terminals, you can end your journey at:\n\nLondon Waterloo\n\nLondon Victoria (via Clapham Junction)\n\nLondon Bridge\n\nLondon Blackfriars\n\nCity Thameslink\n\nLondon Charing Cross\n\nLondon Waterloo East\n\nLondon Cannon Street (via London Bridge)\n\nBut you could not use your ticket to travel to:\n\nLondon Euston\n\nLondon Paddington\n\nbecause those stations are not on the line of route – meaning you would have to cross London using another method of transport, such as London Underground or a London bus, to get there.\n\nSome tickets, for example from a specific train company or special fares, will only be valid for a named London Terminal station. This will be shown on your ticket.\n\nWhat are the London Terminal stations?\n\nThere are 18 London Terminal stations:\n\nLondon Blackfriars\n\nLondon Cannon Street\n\nLondon Charing Cross\n\nCity Thameslink\n\nLondon Euston\n\nLondon Fenchurch Street\n\nLondon Kings Cross\n\nLondon Liverpool Street\n\nLondon Bridge\n\nLondon Marylebone\n\nMoorgate\n\nOld Street (for journeys starting north of London and via Kings Cross St Pancras only)\n\nLondon Paddington\n\nSt Pancras International\n\nVauxhall\n\nLondon Victoria\n\nLondon Waterloo\n\nLondon Waterloo East\n\nTickets to or from London Thameslink\n\nIf your ticket shows London Thameslink, you can find more information on routes and validity on the Thameslink website. The below diagrams may help with understanding which stations from the north or the south a 'London Thameslink' or 'London Terminals' ticket is valid to.\n\nTickets for travel on High Speed services\n\nCustomers with tickets with an origin or destination of London Terminals and routed Plus High Speed are also permitted to travel in either direction on Thameslink services between London St Pancras International and:\n\nLondon Blackfriars\n\nCity Thameslink\n\nElephant & Castle\n\nFarringdon\n\nLondon Bridge\n\nTravelling across London with your train ticket\n\nIf your journey involves travelling via or across London to connect with another National Rail service, your ticket should include the cost of transfer on London Underground, DLR, Thameslink or Elizabeth line services between the relevant stations.\n\nYour ticket will be marked with a cross ( + ) sign.\n\nTickets displaying this sign are valid for travel between any 2 stations shown in the list below, appropriate to the route of the through journey being made.\n\nYou are allowed to break your transfer journey once and leave the Underground, Elizabeth line or DLR at any intermediate station. For example, if you are travelling on the Underground between Victoria and Euston, you can exit at Oxford Circus. However, if you subsequently wish to continue your journey by Underground you will have to purchase another ticket or use pay as you go to travel to Euston.\n\nTravelling in London\n\nIf you are making journeys within London, you can use Oyster or contactless pay as you go and Travelcards for travel on National Rail and Transport for London rail services, London Underground, DLR, London Buses and London Trams. See our Oyster, contactless and Travelcards page for more information and check our live trains too.\n\nIf you are travelling to London from the home counties, the south, south east, or further afield on some routes, you may be able to buy a return ticket which also includes a One Day Travelcard. Check the Journey Planner to see if this option is available.\n\nBoundary tickets\n\nIf you already have a Travelcard, then you are permitted to use any services within its Zones (subject to time restrictions of the Travelcard). If you are travelling beyond what is permitted by your Travelcard or Pass then you can purchase a Boundary Zone ticket to or from the station outside of London.\n\nFor example, if you have a 7-Day Zones 1 to 3 Travelcard and wanted to travel to Brighton, you can buy a London Boundary Zone 3 to Brighton Day Return ticket from staffed National Rail ticket offices and some self-service ticket machines. The train you are on does not need to call at a station within Zone 3 to be valid. Boundary tickets can be sold in the opposite direction as well (e.g. Brighton to London Boundary Zone 3).\n\nAccessible travel in London\n\nFor up-to-date information about travelling around London on public transport, visit TfL’s Transport Accessibility page."
