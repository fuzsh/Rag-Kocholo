        "text": "Where are the UK's busiest rail stations? And how many people use them?\n\nWe bring you one of the best datasets available about each of the train stations we use.\n\nFrom the Office of Rail Regulation, this shows exactly how many people use every railway station in the UK. And how it's changed since the previous year. Take it with 2010's McNulty report into the state of the railways, and it's a compelling dataset.\n\nThe figures are based on ticket sales and they show entries (when someone gets on a train) and exits (when they get off). The total entries and exits is what gives you the number of people using the station.\n\nSo, using this dataset, you can see that Waterloo is Britain's busiest rail station with 94,045,510 entries and exits made by passengers - an increase of 3% (3 million more passenger entries and exits) compared with 2010-2011. London Victoria comes second with 76,231,290 entries and exits (an increase of 4%) and London Liverpool Street third with 57,106,502 (up 2%). Birmingham New Street beats Glasgow Central to be the busiest station outside London, taking eighth place in the GB rankings.\n\nBut if you look at interchanges, ie, the stations where people change trains, then Clapham Junction is way in the lead with nearly 22m. It's also the busiest station in Europe by track activity: one train every 13 seconds at peak times; one train every 30 seconds at off-peak times.\n\nOut of the 2,533 railway stations recorded here, only 474 saw a decrease in passengers over the year, with an average change of -7% for those. The median number of passengers - ie, the most typical across all stations was 217,302 entries and exits, which is up on last year's 205,442.\n\nThe dataset will also tell you Britain's least popular stations. But what it won't give you is which stations are the most over-capacity and over-crowded. Is there another dataset we could use to work that out?\n\nWe've added in some figures of our own too: postcodes or geo locations for each station, plus the percentage changes over the period, which means you can map them, as we have using Google Fusion tables above.\n\nIf any of the figures look odd, there's a hefty notes PDF from the ORR. For instance, Merseyside saw decreases in traffic this year, mostly down to a change in the ticketing system. Similarly, Armadale in West Lothian recorded a 1,029% increase - but that's because it has just had its first full year open.\n\nIt also includes three stations that didn't exist last year: Coulsdon Town (formerly Smitham), Southend Airport and Buckshaw Parkway.\n\nThe full data is below. What can you do with it?\n\nData summary\n\nDownload the data\n\nDATA: Download the full spreadsheet with every station\n\n• SOURCE: Office of Rail Regulation\n\nMore open data\n\nData journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian\n\nWorld government data\n\n• Search the world's government data with our gateway\n\nDevelopment and aid data\n\n• Search the world's global development data with our gateway\n\nCan you do something with this data?\n\n• Flickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group\n\n• Contact us at data@guardian.co.uk"
