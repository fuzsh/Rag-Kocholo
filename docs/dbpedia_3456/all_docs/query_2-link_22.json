        "text": "I arrive this Friday at Heathrow at 10:35 a.m. so presumably I can just go to a tourist office there and find out everything I need to know about getting into London and get an underground map.\n\nBut being a traveler who likes to know what I am doing, I am feeling a little confused by the websites I have found or the guidebook I am looking at. I like to save money. I am staying at an AirBnB near St. Paul's Cathedral and the nearest underground stops are Blackfriars or St. Paul's. Is it that I can just get on the underground at Heathrow and get myself to Leicester Square and transfer to Embankment transfer to Blackfriars OR get on the underground at Heathrow and get myself to Holborn and transfer to St. Paul's?\n\nSome information suggests I take the Heathrow Express (more expensive) and go to Paddington. Then transfer to Embankment/transfer to Blackfriars? I am understanding the Heathrow to be a time-saver.\n\nWhen I leave London, I need to get to Euston station (I have that train ticket conveniently in Apple Wallet!!). By that time, I'll know the system better, but it looks like I should start at St. Paul's, go to Bank, transfer to Euston.\n\nI know I stress a little too much but any advice would be much appreciated! I understand I can use a credit card for contactless payment, tap once when entering/tap again when leaving."
