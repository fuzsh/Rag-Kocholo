        "text": "Above: View looking south from the NW corner of Blackfriars Railway Bridge. The west side of Blackfriars Station is seen on the left. The red pillars from the old Alexandra Bridge are in front of the camera and a small part of Blackfriars Bridge (the road bridge) can be seen on the right.\n\nThe whole of Blackfriars Railway Bridge is now taken up by the platforms of Blackfriars Station. There are two tracks towards the east side for through trains, with platforms on either side of the tracks. To the west, there are two more tracks which end at the northern end of the bridge which also have platforms on either side. The northbound ‘through platform’ and the southbound terminus platform are combined into a wide central island platform. Passengers alighting at any of the four platforms can exit the station at the northern end of the bridge (with access to Queen Victoria Street and also interconnection with Blackfriars Underground Station, serving the District Line. Passengers can also exit the station at the southern end and gain access to the walkway at Bankside, in Southwark.\n\nAbove: View looking west from Platform 4. Part of Blackfriars Bridge (the road bridge) can be seen. Beyond that is a line of trees standing on the Victoria Embankment.\n\nThe eastern platform (Platform 1) serves southbound through trains and provides excellent views of Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, depending on where you stand. The western platform (Platform 4) serves one of the two terminus platforms and provides views of Blackfriars Bridge (the road bridge) as well as views further west along the Thames. Obviously, taking pictures from any of the platforms will require a valid ticket or travel pass to gain access.\n\n-END-"
