The support group is for people who have lost loved ones to cancer.\n\nBased on the feedback you have been giving us about the support you need, we will be trialling out running themed support groups at this venue, e.g. for specific losses or particular topics within grief to discuss. Each month we will be running a different theme to try to meet the needs of people who want more specific support.\n\nDecember’s theme: a support group for those who have lost a parent to cancer.\n\nThe support group evenings are informal and we are very grateful to sofa.com for providing a very cosy and welcoming environment for us to share experiences, thoughts and emotions.\n\nThe space is there for you to use it as you need it on the day. Our team will be there to welcome and support you. Refreshments will be provided, and we also have a selection of books on grief and bereavement that you are welcome to borrow.\n\nVenue: sofa.com, 3 Burrell Street, London, SE1 0UN. (You’ll find the venue nestled in a quiet old railway arch).\n\nPlease note that on occasion the sofa.com venue need to keep their store open at later hours in which case there may be some months we do not run groups, please check our calendar for details.\n\nPlease try not to be too early as we only have access to the venue from 7pm. If you are early just let the lovely sofa.com staff at the welcome desk know you are there for The Loss Foundation support group.\n\nPublic Transport: sofa.com’s Bankside branch is a 5 minute walk from Southwark (Jubilee line) and Blackfriars (District and Circle line) tube stations. It is also a 10 minute walk from Waterloo and London Bridge stations."
