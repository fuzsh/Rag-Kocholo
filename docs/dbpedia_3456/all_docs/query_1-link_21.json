        "text": "The London Underground is a Rapid Transit rail system which serves the Inner and Greater areas of London and parts of the counties of\n\nBuckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire. The system was opened on the tenth of January 1863, when the Metropolitan Railway ran a\n\nservice from Paddington Station to Farringdon Street via Kings Cross, a route of just four miles.\n\nSince then the system has grown to be two hundred and fifty miles long and is served by three hundred and sixty two stations, (three hundred and sixty two of which are served by their own bespoke elevator), including seventy seven former stations that have since been closed and forty four stations that were built but never opened.\n\nToday the London Underground holds the record for being the world's first ever underground railway, the first system to operate electric trains, (in 1890), the world's second longest system after the Shanghai Metro in China and has a daily customer base of just under three million passengers a day.\n\nThe system is known locally as the Tube due to the shape of the system's tunnels.\n\nThe system's iconic signage, known as roundels, were designed by Edward Johnson in 1916 and were chosen because they looked like bulls eye signs, which developers thought would catch people's attention.\n\nThe system has eleven routes, known as lines, on both subsurface and deep level tracks.The subsurface tracks are around five metres below the surface and the deep level tracks around twenty metres below the surface, although it varies greatly from area to area. Four of the system's lines are situated on subsurface track and seven lines are on deep level tracks.\n\nThe system's tunnels are 3.5 yards (11 ft 8 ins) wide at their widest point.Forty five per cent of the system is in tunnel, meaning that fifty five per cent is situated above ground, unusual for a system that is renowned for being called The Underground.\n\nThe system's deepest platform is situated at Hampstead Station at sixty four yards (192 feet) below ground level. Hampstead Station\n\nis also home to the deepest lift shaft on the system, at one hundred and eighty one feet deep.\n\nThe system's longest escalator is situated at Angel Station, at one hundred and ninety seven feet long, which has a vertical rise of\n\nninety feet.\n\nThe system's deepest, (below sea level), platform is at Westminster Station, situated thirty six yards (190 feet) below sea level.\n\nSeven London boroughs are not served by the underground system,the boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Croyden, Kingston, Lewisham and Sutton, situated south of the River Thames and the Borough of Hackney, situated north of the River Thames.\n\nThe system runs on a four track, 1435mm (4ft 81/2 ins) standard gauge track which is run by 210 v DC power, which provides a traction\n\nvoltage of 630 volts.\n\nThe system's longest distance between stations is Chalfont and Latimer to Chesham on the Metropolitan Line with a distance of 3.89\n\nmiles.\n\nThe system's shortest distance between stations is from Leicester Square to Covent Garden on the Picaddilly Line, a distance of just two hundred and eighty yards.\n\nThe system's shortest distance between two street level stations is Charing Cross and Embankment on the Northern Line, with a distance of just one hundred yards.\n\nThe system's most southerly station is situated at Morden on the Northern Line. Both the system's most northerly and westerly station is situated at Chesham on the Metropolitan Line and the system's most easterly station is located at Upminster on the District Line.\n\nThe system uses rolling stock built between the years of 1960 and 2005, with higher, square shaped trains used on the sub surface lines and shorter, rounder shape trains on the deep level lines.\n\nThe system's largest and busiest station is King's Cross St Pancras, which is home to the underground's largest interchange station,\n\nwhich is served by six of the system's eleven lines and caters to over sixty six million passengers a year.\n\nTHE LONDON OYSTER CARD\n\nTHE BAKERLOO LINE\n\nThe Bakerloo Line was opened in 1906 and is fourteen and a half miles long.
