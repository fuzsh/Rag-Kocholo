On most buses the wheelchair ramp is positioned at the exit door and there is one wheelchair user place on each bus.\n\nMain bus stops are located on Holloway Road, Nag's Head, Seven Sisters Road, Blackstock Road and Highbury Corner.\n\nHigh frequency services will take you within a five-to-10-minute walk of the ground and direct routes cover much of north and central London.\n\nFurther information on buses is available through www.tfl.gov.uk or consult the maps of local bus routes below:\n\nBuses - Area map .pdf\n\nBuses - Local map .pdf\n\n------\n\nBy Coach\n\nPlease note that coach parking is only available on match days.\n\nNo parking is permitted on non-matchdays. For further details on non-matchday parking, please visit https://www.islington.gov.uk/parking/parking-restrictions\n\nCoach Parking Sites:\n\nQueensland Road and Hornsey Road are the coach parking sites for Emirates Stadium. Supporters will only have to walk a few moments to reach the stadium.\n\nPlease note that minibuses are not permitted to park at the designated coach parking site.\n\nBooking Procedure\n\nTo ensure the operation of Emirates Stadium runs as smoothly as possible for spectators, local residents and businesses, Arsenal Football Club has introduced a booking procedure for supporter coach travel. If you do not follow the simple three step procedure (as below) your coach will not be able to park at Emirates Stadium.\n\nStep One: Your Club / Coach Company must register with Arsenal Football Club if they intend to travel to Emirates Stadium by coach, by completing the attached form at least 7 days before a match. This simple registration form asks for coach and travel information (e.g., departure time, number of passengers, on-coach contact, vehicle registration etc.).\n\nStep Two: Once the registration form has been received, Arsenal Football Club will e-mail each Club a coach identification permits along with directions on how to get to Emirates Stadium and which area they will be parked in.\n\nStep Three: Coaches must arrive between four and two hours before the start of a match. Coaches must also display their identification permit clearly in the front windscreen of the vehicle.\n\nAccess\n\nAll access routes to the Queensland Road coach parking site will be closed by the Metropolitan Police Service 2 hours before the start of a match. Coaches arriving after this will not be permitted into the area and will not be allocated a parking space.\n\nFurther information\n\nFor non-matchday parking, please be aware that local parking restrictions apply and there are no coach parking facilities. For further details, please visit https://www.islington.gov.uk/parking/parking-restrictions.\n\nIf you have any questions about the coach parking arrangements, please contact arsenaltravel@arsenal.co.uk\n\n------\n\nBy Car or Motorbike\n\nSupporters are strongly advised not to drive to Emirates Stadium.

This is so the Metropolitan Police Service can safely manage travel to and from the stadium and reduce inconvenience, as far as possible, to people living nearby.\n\nFor more information about these traffic changes, details of the CPZ operation, times and permit applications visit https://www.islington.gov.uk/parking/parking-restrictions/emirates-stadium-restrictions\n\nPlease contact Islington Council with any queries: 020 7527 2000 or contact@islington.gov.uk.\n\nMatchday Parking Scheme in Hackney visit: https://hackney.gov.uk/matchday-parking\n\n------\n\nBy Bicycle\n\nCycling is easier than you think. It is a quick and healthy way to make your journey and saves you a lot of money. Why not avoid the crowds and queues by cycling to the stadium?\n\nEmirates Stadium is fully accessible by bicycle. There are a number of cycle routes through the area, and as Islington is a small, relatively flat borough, it’s a great way of getting to the stadium.\n\nRoutes across London are mapped out on Transport for London's London Cycle Guides, a collection of 19 maps covering the whole of London.
