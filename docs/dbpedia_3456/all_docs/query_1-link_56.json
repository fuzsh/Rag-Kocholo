        "text": "Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides\n\n\"Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points. On these his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and concentration of the heavy tufted brows which I knew so well.\n\n'Points,' he muttered, 'the points.'\"\n\n- The Bruce-Partington Plans\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\nCircle Line\n\nA Subsurface Line\n\n[Last modified: 2023-10-29]\n\nHistory\n\nDates\n\nFeatures\n\nServices\n\nTopology\n\nLayout\n\nDepots\n\nConnections\n\nRolling stock\n\nHistory\n\nThe early success of the Metropolitan Railway (now the Hammersmith & City Line) prompted a huge number of proposals for other railways. Parliamentary committees in 1863-4 evaluated them and decided that the best thing would be an \"inner circuit\" (as it was first known) connecting both ends of the Metropolitan route (then Paddington and Farringdon) with the main-line railway stations on the north side of the Thames but serving the south (Victoria, Charing Cross, Blackfriars, and Cannon Street). The route first proposed ran south from Moorgate to Cannon Street, but this was soon amended to the present alignment to allow connection with three additional termini: Liverpool Street, Broad Street, and Fenchurch Street. However, this change also forced an awkward doubling-back at Aldgate, reducing the desirability of the line for local traffic and greatly increasing the cost of construction due to high prices in the City of London.\n\nThe Metropolitan obtained powers to extend itself to Tower Hill (1) in the east and South Kensington in the west, in both cases along the present route of the Circle Line. The latter extension also reinstated the Praed Street station that had originally been planned for Paddington but later dropped. Because so much capital would have to be raised to build the rest of the Circle, it was found expedient to start a separate company for this purpose. It was planned that the two companies would be merged as soon as practical, and so the similar name \"Metropolitan District Railway\" was chosen.\n\nHowever, the MDR was a much less profitable company than the Metropolitan (whose financial performance was never even approached by any other line), and the Metropolitan's shareholders blocked the merger. This decision was clearly not in the public interest, but even considering only their own financial interests, it is hard to say whether or not it was a smart one. By rejecting the MDR's financial obligations, the Metropolitan acquired an enemy. For years thereafter, the situation was almost one of warfare - often to the detriment of passengers - and the relationship only really became friendly after the completion of electrification in 1905 and the consequent improvement in the MDR's finances.\n\nReturning to the 1860s: the Metropolitan rapidly constructed the western extension, and the District continued from there to Mansion House. However, the District could not afford to complete the rest of the line to Tower Hill, while the Metropolitan suddenly viewed the eastern section as a threat - the District would take much of its traffic into the City - and tried to abandon its own planned route to Tower Hill. However, business interests in the City were not willing to accept this, and formed the Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion Railway Company in 1874. This spurred the Metropolitan into extending rapidly as far as Aldgate, and forced the two railways into negotiation.\n\nAs a result, the Metropolitan bought out the new company and, in conjunction with the District, implemented its plans to complete the Circle and simultaneously connect both lines to the East London Line. The arrangement received Parliament's approval in 1879 and the work was started relatively rapidly. As well as the increased costs of the final route, further trouble and cost came from a requirement (probably imposed as a reaction to the disruption caused by previous construction) to excavate only at night and replace the road every morning. The Circle was completed in 1884. Even then the District were not completely committed to it and for some time they had plans to make Tower Hill (2) a four-track station where many trains from both directions would terminate.\n\nOn completion of the Circle both companies started running trains all the way round (although the original service from Moorgate to Mansion House had involved both companies, it had subsequently been mostly left to the Metropolitan). Initially each provided an equal number of trains, but on 1884-11-10 this was changed to an arrangment whereby the Metropolitan provided all of the clockwise trains and a minority of the anticlockwise. In late 1907 and most of 1908 the Metropolitan provided the entire service. A major revamp of the timetable in late 1926 saw the start of regular District services to Edgware Road and, in consequence, the Metropolitan took over the entire weekday Circle service, though the District continued to provide a minority of trains in each direction on Sundays until 1990.\n\nReaders will note the name \"Inner Circle\", still used by many Londoners. \"Inner\" simply referred to the central position of the route with respect to London and its railways; the name was in use by 1869, well before the actual completion of the circuit. In fact, over the following decade, three other services, each in the form of a horseshoe and, in two cases, sharing track with the Inner Circle, were given names obviously modelled after it:\n\nMiddle Circle\n\nHammersmith & City Line from Moorgate to Kensington (Olympia) via Latimer Road, then District Line to Mansion House. This service ran from 1872 to 1910, though the latter terminus was cut back twice, to Earl's Court in 1900 and Kensington (Olympia) in 1905, while the other terminus changed to Latimer Road for a brief period in 1906. The service was operated by the Hammersmith & City and District Railways. [For services on this section after 1910, see the Hammersmith & City Line page.]\n\nOuter Circle\n\nNLR from Broad Street to Willesden Junction, then WLR to Kensington (Olympia), then various routes:\n\n1867-1868: terminated at Kensington;\n\n1869-1872: to Victoria main-line station via the WLR and LBSCR;\n\n1872-1908: to Mansion House via the District Line;\n\n1908-1912: to Earl's Court via the District Line.\n\nIn 1912 it was reduced to a Willesden-Earl's Court shuttle, and after bomb damage to the track at Kensington (Olympia) it was finally abandoned in 1940. This was essentially a LNWR service, though the District provided the locomotives on its section and operated the shuttle from 1914-07-01 to 1914-11-21 inclusive (while the LNWR obtained electric trains).\n\nSuper Outer Circle\n\nMidland Railway from St. Pancras to Cricklewood, then Midland & South Western Joint to Acton Central, then NLR to Acton Lane Junction (see the District Line) via a chord (since removed), then District Line to Earl's Court. This was operated by the Midland Railway for a short period starting in 1878.\n\nNote that the Inner and Middle Circles were essentially \"Underground\" services on Underground routes, while the Outer and Super Outer Circles were essentially main-line routes using sections of Underground lines but operated by main-line companies.\n\nThe rivalry between the two companies was to strike one more time, at electrification in 1905. The District, by then in the hands of Yerkes, chose the four-rail DC system that is still in use today. The Metropolitan, on the other hand, wanted to use the Ganz three-phase AC system, involving two overhead wires and current through the running rails. The dispute went to arbitration, and the District won. On 1905-07-01, which should have been the first day of electric operation of the Circle, it turned out that the Metropolitan had used narrower collector shoes and more accurately placed conductor rails, and their trains had to be confined to the northern side until modified.\n\nAfter that the Circle Line operated mostly unchanged for over a century (though see Services for notes on some experiments). It gained its own identity in about 1949, although the name appears on a 1936 poster; until then the Inner Circle was just one of the services run by the Metropolitan and District Lines.\n\nIn 1999 it was necessary to close the line from High Street Kensington to Gloucester Road in order to repair the covered way. The original plan was to have trains run from both Wimbledon and Kensington (Olympia) almost completely round the Circle and then back to their origin. This approach collapsed on the first day of this service and was never made to operate properly; within a week the Circle Line was closed completely for the duration of the work.\n\nIn 2009 the continuous nature of the Inner Circle was finally ended, replaced by an end-to-end service between Hammersmith (1) and Edgware Road via a single complete circuit of the previous route (that is, Hammersmith, Edgware Road, Liverpool Street, Tower Hill, South Kensington, High Street Kensington, Paddington, and Edgware Road, and vice versa). This was done with the aim of improving reliability by providing a place for trains to terminate after each trip rather than letting delays accumulate. However, it means that normally no trains through Notting Hill Gate go east of Edgware Road (the short way).\n\nIn material that covers the services since then, the following terms are used to describe them:\n\n\"entire service\" means the normal service after the 2009 change, with trains from Notting Hill Gate towards Paddington reversing at Edgware Road.\n\n\"circular service\" means a continuous service around the original Inner Circle route. In particular, trains from Notting Hill Gate towards Edgware Road continue on to Baker Street and vice versa.\n\n\"Hammersmith to Edgware Road\" and vice versa mean just the section of line between those two stations and not the entire route.\n\nDates\n\nFor dates before the completion of the Circle, [D] and [M] indicate the company - District and Metropolitan respectively - initially operating that section. Further details can be found under the appropriate Lines.\n\nFor the section from Praed Street Junction to Hammersmith, dates before 2009-12-13 are only given where relevant to the Middle Circle.

regular service for about two months, after which it was only used when necessary for operational reasons.\n\n[2] Following bomb damage near King's Cross on 1940-10-16 services ran intermittently in this section for the next few months.\n\n[3] This closure was for repairs to the covered way carrying the tracks from High Street Kensington to Gloucester Road. Trains ran for a few days after this date on the rest of the Circle; see History for more details.\n\n[4] A limited service ran during the peak hours of the 4th and 5th, and there was no service at all on the 6th and 7th (a weekend). Normal service resumed on the 8th.\n\n[5] Officially the closure commenced on Monday March 2nd, but the line was also suspended in this area over the weekend for engineering works.\n\n[6] The circular service has sometimes been temporarily restored when the section to Hammersmith or the line east of Aldgate Junction was closed.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe original Inner Circle is basically underground throughout, though various stretches and stations are in cuttings. The two tracks of the route are known within LU as the \"Inner Rail\" (anti-clockwise: Aldgate to Paddington to Embankment to Aldgate, with increasing km) and the \"Outer Rail\" (clockwise). Though these terms are unknown to the general public nowadays, at one time tickets were explicitly labelled \"I\" or \"O\" (or in a few cases \"E\", indicating either way).\n\nAt Aldgate the outer two platforms are used by the Circle, while the centre two (which can only be entered from the west end) are used by the Metropolitan. The former are the only platforms used that are exclusive to the Circle, and are used to regulate trains to time. The only other exclusive part of the route is from High Street Kensington to Gloucester Road. The Inner Rail merges with the eastbound District Line west of the latter, but the Outer Rail is separate until just west of South Kensington; this allows a Circle Line train to be held for an eastbound District Line train at the flat junction without any delay to following westbound District trains (this had been a major cause of disruption until the reconstruction of the area in 1957).\n\nFrom Blackfriars to Westminster, the line runs within the Embankment along the north side of the Thames; next to it is a major sewer, part of the system which brought decent sanitation to London for the first time in the 19th century. Construction of the embankment, road, sewer, and District Line was planned as a single integrated project, but the MDR did not have enough capital; instead, the other components were completed, then torn up and rebuilt when the District's cut-and-cover construction came. The lowest point on the Circle is Westminster station, 4.0m (13') below Thames high tide level, and the highest is Edgware Road, at 31.4m (103') above high tide.\n\nAt Paddington the line to Hammersmith emerges from tunnel; the island platform forms the northermost part of the main-line station. Westwards from there it parallels the National Rail line as far as Westbourne Park, crossing from north to south side via a diveunder west of Royal Oak; there is no longer any connection to the main lines. After diverging it runs on viaduct to Hammersmith.\n\nServices\n\nOperationally the Circle Line is not separate, but is merely a second service of the Hammersmith & City Line, and trains are shared between the two.\n\nAs stated above, the normal service is between Hammersmith and Edgware Road via a complete circuit of the central area. During disruption this may be altered in various ways, such as reinstating the circular service or extending trains from Edgware Road to Moorgate (thus calling at stations between Baker Street and Barbican twice per trip). When the northern side of the Circle is closed, services have sometimes run between High Street Kensington and Barking via Embankment.\n\nNow that the Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City Lines use the same rolling stock, inter-line services have become more common. One weekday morning service from Edgware Road runs around the loop then continues to High Street Kensington a second time before running to Ealing Broadway; a service late on Sunday nights also takes this route. At the start of the evening rush hour a train from Acton Town takes the same route in the opposite direction (this has no Sunday equivalent). Late on Saturday evenings a train from Hammersmith runs round the entire loop before continuing to Upminster. A few late-night services from Hammersmith to Edgware Road continue to Baker Street (Sunday night), King's Cross St.Pancras (except Sunday night), Aldgate (Sunday night), or Barking (daily)\n\nUntil 2009 the circulating trains ran continually throughout the day with various arrangements being used at the start and end of service to get trains to and from depots. In addition, on weekdays after the evening peak, some trains transferred from the Circle to the Hammersmith/Whitechapel route, a few by running directly between Aldgate East and Tower Hill.\n\nAt least in 1906, the Metropolitan ran also services between Moorgate and South Kensington via Baker Street.\n\nUntil 1933, the Metropolitan and District services remained mostly independent. But with the amalgamation, some experiments were made to see if there was a better way to integrate the various subsurface lines. Many variations were proposed (the most complex probably being Uxbridge to Wimbledon via Finchley Road, Aldgate, and South Kensington) and some were even tried out, such as Uxbridge to Barking via Finchley Road. However, it eventually became clear that they simply led to confusion and, in addition, a delay anywhere would propagate bit by bit until the entire system was affected. Instead, it became obvious that the best approach was to have several independent services with a minimal duplication of traffic. The only new service to survive was the Hammersmith & City peak extension to Barking.\n\nFrom Whitsun 1943 to August 1964, there was a curious arrangement in place around the various bank holidays. On these days there would be large numbers of people changing trains between main-line stations along the northern side of the Circle and the standard services would not cope. Therefore District Line Putney Bridge [7] to Edgware Road trains were extended to Aldgate while some Hammersmith & City services ran between South Kensington or High Street Kensington and Aldgate. The exact days of these services varied, but typically they were some or all of Maundy Thursday, Easter Saturday (1944 only), Easter Monday, Friday, Saturday, and Monday of the Whitsun and August Bank Holidays, and Christmas Eve.\n\nFrom 1968-10-19 until 1972-02-05, some District Line services to Edgware Road were extended on Saturday afternoons: 12 to Aldgate, 10 to Liverpool Street, and 1 to Moorgate.\n\nIn the 1960s trains were sometimes diverted via Earl's Court during engineering work on the direct curve between High Street Kensington and Gloucester Road.\n\nMore recently, other experiments have been tried. For example, to reduce the number of trains used on Sundays, the Hammersmith & City and Circle services were merged, with trains running from Hammersmith, once round the Circle, and then to Whitechapel (and the reverse). Another example was the extension of the District Line Kensington (Olympia) shuttle to Edgware Road outside peak hours. But none of these have survived long, though the latter still operates in the early morning.\n\nThe current service is 6tph at all times. The minimum running time is 16 minutes from Hammersmith to Edgware Road the first time and another 51½ minutes round via Embankment to Edgware Road the second time (52 minutes on the return), totalling 67½ minutes.\n\nCovid-19: on 2020-03-19 and 2020-03-20 the service was 4tph around the original Circle. This was then restored on weekdays from 2020-05-18. A 2tph weekend service around the original Circle was operated on 2020-06-06 and 2020-06-07. Normal services were restored on 2020-06-13.\n\n[7] In 1944 and on Christmas Eve 1963, the western terminus for some of these services was Wimbledon.\n\nTopology\n\nCBD\n\nLayout\n\nkey to notation\n\nLocations are listed down the page in the \"Inner Rail\" (anticlockwise) and westbound directions.\n\nDistances on the District Line section are calculated via the Inner Rail.
