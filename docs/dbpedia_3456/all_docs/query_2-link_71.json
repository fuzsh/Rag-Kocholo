        "text": "Back to Project Showcase page\n\nProject\n\nBlackfriars HV Cabling Diversions (Blackfriars Station Reconstruction)\n\nClient\n\nBalfour Beatty Engineering Services Limited, Power Systems, Unit 5, Greenwich Centre Business Park, 53 Norman Road, Greenwich, London SE10 9QF\n\nProject Details\n\nAs part of the major station reconstruction of Blackfriars Station a new transformer room was constructed adjacent the westbound LUL District Line platform. In order to provide the required HV cable connections to the transformer room cable diversions were required to HV cables F600 & F630 and Pilot cables P413 & P414.? HV cables F600 & F630 and pilot cable P414 originally ran along the tunnel wall adjacent to the eastbound running line and entered the eastbound platform invert. These cables were diverted over to the tunnel wall adjacent to the westbound running line to enter the westbound platform invert.\n\nProject Deliverables\n\nSite surveys\n\nProduction of cable route designs and photo sketches\n\nProduction of detailed drawings for bespoke cable hangers and brackets.\n\nStructural detailed designs and structural assessments\n\nTrack clearance measurements\n\nProduction of detailed track clearance drawings\n\nProduction and supply of design check certificate(s)\n\nProduction and supply cutting drilling and fixing logs\n\nProduction and supply design risk assessments\n\nSpecifications for civil/structural works\n\nAttendance at design reviews\n\nIntrusive surveys\n\nPreparation of concessions\n\nPreparation of Conceptual Design Statements (CDS)\n\nPreparation of Compliance Submissions\n\nLocation\n\nDistrict Line running tunnels adjacent Blackfriars Underground Station, and station platforms."
