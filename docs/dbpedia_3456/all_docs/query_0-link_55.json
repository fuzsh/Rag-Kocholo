        "text": "We now check some more Tube Map stations with pier connections. Here is part 3!\n\nIf you have missed part 2 of this series, click here.\n\nEmbankment (Bakerloo, Circle, District and Northern lines): Embankment Pier (north bank)\n\nWe start off by checking out Embankment Pier which is directly opposite of Embankment Tube station. Various sites include the Golden Jubilee footbridges alongside the railway bridge at Charing Cross. The pier serves RB1, RB2 (in the weekends) and RB6 during weekday morning peak and evenings. Also various river tour boats serve this pier as well.\n\nBlackfriars (Circle and District lines): Blackfriars Pier (north bank)\n\nNext up is Blackfriars Pier. The original pier opened in 2000 and was located at the corner of Victoria Embankment and Blackfriars Bridge. When works for the Thames Tideway Tunnel were underway, the pier closed and was relocated 250 meters to the east on the other side of Blackfriars Bridge and opened in 2016. The pier serves RB1 and RB6 river buses.\n\nLondon Bridge (Jubilee and Northern lines): London Bridge City Pier (south bank)\n\nThe next pier along is London Bridge City Pier on the south bank. The pier is close to London Bridge, Hay’s Galleria, HMS Belfast, The Shard and Borough Market. The pier serves RB1, RB2 (in the weekends) and RB6 during weekday morning peak and evenings. No river tours serve this pier.\n\nOther piers between this section that are not served by a Tube Map station\n\nBankside (south bank) (between Blackfriars and London Bridge City piers)\n\nWe will check out more Tube Map Stations with pier connections very soon!\n\n(Photo credits – all photos taken by me 😃 during the following periods: Embankment and Blackfriars Piers in July 2023 and Bankside and London Bridge City Piers in August 2023)\n\nIf you have already read my blog post on Crowndels (if not, click here to have a read), you will know that Transport for London installed special roundels called “Crowndels” (these are roundels with a crown on top) specially made for the Coronation weekend for the Coronation of King Charles III.\n\nOver a couple of days on Coronation Weekend, I thought I would try to find each and every Crowndel on the London Underground, London Overground and Elizabeth line. So if you haven’t managed to track any of them or only spotted a handful, here is a photo gallery of all of them!\n\nPlease note that a small number of the Crowndels have lost their crown which is a shame. But most of them still have it!\n\nI’m not sure if the Crowndels will remain for a while or if they will be removed, so if you are still wanting to find out if you can still find them, then have a look on the network while you can!\n\nLondon Underground\n\nBecause some of the stations are served by many lines, I’ve included which line the Crowndel can be found.\n\nBlackfriars\n\nWhere to find: Circle and District lines\n\nBond Street\n\nWhere to find: Jubilee line\n\nCharing Cross\n\nWhere to find: Bakerloo line\n\nCovent Garden\n\nWhere to find: Piccadilly line\n\nEmbankment\n\nWhere to find: Circle and District lines\n\nEuston\n\nWhere to find: Northern line via Charing Cross\n\nI almost missed this one! After walking down the platforms of the Victoria line and Northern line via Bank, it almost seemed like this was nowhere to be found! But glad to get this one.\n\nGreen Park\n\nWhere to find: Jubilee line\n\nHyde Park Corner\n\nWhere to find: Piccadilly line\n\nKing’s Cross St. Pancras\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line\n\nLeicester Square\n\nWhere to find: Piccadilly line\n\nLiverpool Street\n\nWhere to find: Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines\n\nLondon Bridge\n\nWhere to find: Northern line\n\nMarylebone\n\nWhere to find: Bakerloo line\n\nOxford Circus\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line\n\nPaddington\n\nWhere to find: Bakerloo line\n\nPiccadilly Circus\n\nWhere to find: Piccadilly line\n\nPimlico\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line\n\nThis is probably one of the most terrible setups! You can clearly see the original roundel underneath the crowndel! Perhaps they should have switched the light off this one!\n\nVauxhall\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line\n\nIt’s a shame to see the crown has almost been removed from this crowndel! Even the other platform has had this treatment. This was the best of the two.\n\nVictoria\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line\n\nWaterloo\n\nWhere to find: Northern line\n\nWestminster\n\nWhere to find: Jubilee line\n\nI almost thought I wasn’t get this one. I thought it was on the Circle and District line platforms but they were not there. But on the Jubilee line, I had a closer look and there it was. How did I almost miss this one?\n\nElizabeth line\n\nThe press release stated that Farringdon station has Crowndels. This was a mistake, it is actually Bond Street.\n\nBond Street\n\nLiverpool Street\n\nPaddington\n\nTottenham Court Road\n\nLondon Overground\n\nUnfortunately, when I went out the check these Crowndels, someone or something “stole” the crowns. The crowns were all missing at these stations. Such a shame that things cannot be left alone!\n\nHoxton\n\nShepherd’s Bush\n\nWhite Hart Lane\n\nAnd that’s the complete list of Crowndels for you! Hope you had a great Coronation weekend!\n\n(Photo credits – all photos taken by me in May 2023 😃)\n\nAs you may know, the London Underground is 160 years old this year and a brand new roundel has been commissioned to celebrate this. The roundel was first unveiled at Baker Street station on 10th January 2023. Several more of these have been installed in other stations.\n\nYou can read more about the London Underground 160th birthday by checking my blog post here.\n\nYou can also check out the Love The Tube Treasure Hunt that took place on 21st January by checking my blog post here.\n\nThe plan is to keep these special roundels at the stations for the rest of this year. So the question is, where can you find the rest of the Love The Tube roundels? Well I have explored the London Underground network to hunt them down.\n\nFrom what I have been able to find, I managed to see a total of twelve stations with this roundel. I’m not sure if there are any more, but if I find anymore, I’ll update this blog post. If you do find any that I haven’t found, then post your comments at the end of this blog and I will go and visit the stations that I have missed 😯!\n\nSo here is the list of stations, a photo of the roundel and where you can find them!\n\nBaker Street\n\nWhere to find: Circle and Hammersmith & City lines, eastbound platform\n\nThis is the only roundel that looks like this.\n\nBond Street\n\nWhere to find: Jubilee line, southbound platform\n\nBrixton\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line, platform 2\n\nCovent Garden\n\nWhere to find: Piccadilly line, westbound platform\n\nEmbankment\n\nWhere to find: Circle and District lines, westbound platform\n\nFinsbury Park\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line, southbound platform\n\nGloucester Road\n\nWhere to find: Circle and District lines, eastbound platform\n\nHyde Park Corner\n\nWhere to find: Piccadilly line, eastbound platform\n\nKing’s Cross St. Pancras\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line, southbound platform\n\nLiverpool Street\n\nWhere to find: Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, westbound platform\n\nOxford Circus\n\nWhere to find: Victoria line, southbound platform\n\nShepherd’s Bush\n\nWhere to find: London Overground, northbound platform\n\nThis was a surprise one for me. I’m not sure why this roundel was found on the London Overground when the theme is about the London Underground, but that’s where you will find it! Don’t look for it on the Central line – you won’t find it there!\n\nPlease do check them out on your next trip on the London Underground!\n\n(Update 06/05/2023 – Finsbury Park added)\n\n(Update 07/05/2023 – Shepherd’s Bush added)\n\n(Photo credits – all photos taken by me in March 2023 except Baker Street in January 2023, Bond Street in February 2023 and Finsbury Park in May 2023 and Shepherd’s Bush in May 2023 😃)\n\nFrom today (15th January) until mid-May, part of the Bank branch of the Northern line is closed for major completion works at Bank.\n\nWhat section of line is closed and what stations are closed?\n\nFrom Moorgate to Kennington. The Northern line stations closed on this section will be Bank, London Bridge, Borough (which is completely closed) and Elephant & Castle. There will be no interchange between the Bank and Charing Cross branches at Kennington either.\n\nWhat services will be available during the closure?\n\nThe following services will be running during the closure:\n\nEnhanced services on the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line running every two minutes during the peak\n\nA reduced service on the Northern line section between Camden Town and Moorgate\n\nA new temporary bus route 733 running between Oval and The City (Finsbury Circus) serving all closed stations on the Northern line. The bus service runs Mondays to Fridays\n\nSeveral stations will be extremely busier than normal including Embankment, London Bridge, Tottenham Court Road and Waterloo. It is recommended that you travel during off peak times. Several lines will also be busy including the Waterloo & City line, the Jubilee line between Westminster and Canary Wharf, the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines between Euston Square and Liverpool Street, and the Northern line between Kentish Town and Moorgate and between Camden Town and Oval.\n\nWhat is happening during the closure?\n\nDuring the closure, the brand new southbound platform and tunnel at Bank will be finally connected to the main line itself. In addition to the following:\n\nFilling up the track bed of the old southbound platform at Bank to create a new concourse\n\nConstructing the tunnels to connect to the existing tunnel\n\nFitting out the new southbound platform\n\nInstalling remaining track and train systems\n\nTesting and systems integration\n\nAlso, improvement works will take place at Borough, London Bridge and Elephant & Castle stations.\n\nWhat other works are taking place at Bank?\n\nWhen the works at Bank are complete, the following will be completed by the end of 2022:\n\nStep free access to the Northern line and improved step free access to the DLR\n\nTwo new moving walkways between the Central line and Northern line\n\nTwo new lifts and 12 new escalators including direct access to the Northern line and DLR\n\nA brand new station entrance at Cannon Street\n\nPhoto gallery of old southbound platform at Bank\n\nI took a few photos prior to the closure of the old southbound platform before it is transformed. I plan to take photos of the same locations when the station reopens in mid-May. So have a look and enjoy!\n\nI will revisit Bank station when it reopens – it will be exciting to see the final result in May 😃!\n\n(Photo credits – all photos (except the Tube Map) taken by me in December 2021 😃)\n\nTime for some interesting London Underground trivia! We look at the shortest distances between two Tube stations on a given line. What we are looking at are Tube stations adjacent to one another without any intermediate stops between them. Here is the top five…\n\n5. Charing Cross to Embankment (Bakerloo line)\n\nComing at number 5 is a trip between Charing Cross and Embankment on the Bakerloo line. The distance is only 0.37 kilometres (0.23 miles) and takes an average of 1.5 minutes to travel. A walk down Villiers Street above ground is quicker if you add on the travel time to the platforms and waiting for a train!\n\n4. Cannon Street to Monument (Circle and District lines)\n\nAt number 4 is a trip between Cannon Street and Monument on the Circle and District lines. The distance is just 0.34 kilometres (0.21 miles) and takes an average of 1.5 minutes to travel. It takes even less time to walk along Cannon Street above ground to get between these two stations!\n\n3. Mansion House to Cannon Street (Circle and District lines)\n\nAt number 3 is the trip going the opposite direction from Cannon Street and that is towards Mansion House on the Circle and District lines which is even shorter! The distance is 0.31 kilometres (0.19 miles) and takes an average of 1 minute to travel. Walk the opposite way on Cannon Street above ground to get to Mansion House!\n\n2. Charing Cross to Embankment (Northern line)\n\nComing at number 2 is a trip between Charing Cross and Embankment. If you thought the Bakerloo line was short, the parallel Northern line is even shorter! The distance is just 0.27 kilometres (0.17 miles) and takes an average of 1 minute to travel. Easier to walk down Villiers Street above ground. And great for giving your legs a good walk too!\n\n1. Leicester Square to Covent Garden (Piccadilly line)\n\nAnd at number 1 is the trip between Leicester Square and Covent Garden. Just measuring 0.25 kilometres (0.16 miles) with an average of less than a minute, it is the most expensive Tube journey you will make if you pay by cash (£5.50 as of 2021 fares). Imagine tourists making this trip! It’s a free walk along Long Acre above ground that will save you money and time, of course!\n\nNext time, we will look at the top 5 longest Tube journeys between two stations.\n\n(Photo credits – all photos taken by me 😃 during the following periods: Charing Cross (Bakerloo) in May 2021, Charing Cross (Northern) in September 2020 and Covent Garden in October 2020)\n\nIn this blog post, I will be looking at the London Underground stations with the most platforms on the network. We will look at the most to the stations with five platforms. So here is the complete list…\n\nThe Tube station with the most platforms\n\nBaker Street\n\nBaker Street has the most platforms on the London Underground with a total of 10 platforms! Four of which serve the Metropolitan line for the main line serving Uxbridge, Watford, Chesham and Amersham. Followed by the Circle and Hammersmith & City platforms with two just west of Praed Street junction serving Hammersmith and the north part of the Circle line and out towards Barking on the Hammersmith & City line. The remaining platforms are for the Bakerloo and Jubilee lines. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nThe Tube stations with 8 platforms\n\nBank & Monument\n\nBank and Monument stations share this complex interchange with Monument serving two platforms for the District and Circle lines. All the others are part of Bank station with two platforms each for the Central, Northern and Waterloo & City lines. It’s a real complex at these stations! The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nKing’s Cross St. Pancras\n\nKing’s Cross St. Pancras has the most London Underground lines served by one station. Two platforms serve the subsurface Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines with the remaining six platforms are deep Tube lines of the Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines with two platforms each. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nWaterloo\n\nWaterloo is entirely deep level Tube with two platforms each for the Bakerloo, Jubilee, Northern and Waterloo & City lines. The Waterloo & City line platform numbers 25 and 26 are based on the main line station. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nThe Tube station with 7 platforms\n\nHammersmith\n\nHammersmith has a total of seven platforms although the there are two separate stations. Three terminating platforms for the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. The two island platforms for the District and Piccadilly lines have four platforms. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nThe Tube stations with 6 platforms\n\nEarl’s Court\n\nEarl’s Court has four platforms for the District line and the heart of the line in which several branches converge in both directions – Ealing Broadway and Richmond, Wimbledon and Kensington (Olympia) to the west and Edgware Road and Upminster to the east. The other two platforms serve the Piccadilly line. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nEmbankment\n\nEmbankment serves four lines with the Circle and District lines sharing two platforms, two for the Bakerloo line and two for the Northern line which run parallel with one another and linked by a long corridor which preserves the original tiling of the station. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nEuston\n\nEuston consists of four platforms for the Northern line – two for the Bank branch and the other two for the Charing Cross branch. The Victoria line has two platforms in parallel with the Northern line Bank branch but running in opposite directions. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nGreen Park\n\nGreen Park has six platforms with two each serving the Jubilee, Piccadilly and Victoria lines. The longest interchange is between the Piccadilly and Jubilee lines although many people say that taking the escalators up to the ticket hall between the two lines is the quickest way to interchange. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nOxford Circus\n\nOxford Circus also has six platforms with two each serving the Bakerloo, Central and Victoria lines. It is a quick cross platform interchange with the Bakerloo and Victoria lines if you are travelling in the same direction. However if you are interchanging from either of these lines to the Central line, expect to walk a long corridor to reach it! The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nPaddington\n\nPaddington has two separate stations. The Bakerloo, Circle and District lines form one interchange with two platforms each. The Circle and Hammersmith & City lines are a separate and the two platforms take the main line numbers of 15 and 16 as they run parallel with the main line itself. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nStratford\n\nStratford is an interesting one. There are three terminating platforms for the Jubilee line. The Central line actually has three platforms – with one heading eastbound and two for the westbound with trains opening doors on both sides as there are platforms on either side. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nThe Tube stations with 5 platforms\n\nEaling Broadway\n\nThere are five terminating platforms at Ealing Broadway with two serving the Central line and three serving the District line. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\nMoorgate\n\nMoorgate has five platforms. The Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines have two through platforms and one terminating platform mainly for the Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines heading westbound. The table below has a breakdown of the platforms and lines they serve.\n\n(Photo credits – all photos taken by me 😃 during the following periods: Baker Street in October 2015, Bank in July 2015, Monument in September 2015, King’s Cross St. Pancras in October 2015, Waterloo in June 2015, Hammersmith in November 2009, Earl’s Court in November 2020, Embankment in October 2020, Euston in October 2015, Green Park in August 2015, Oxford Circus in September 2015, Paddington in June 2015, Stratford in June 2010, Ealing Broadway in September 2015 and Moorgate in June 2015)\n\nTime to check another six London Underground stations that have been renamed. So let’s go!\n\nIf you missed part 3 of this blog series, click here.\n\nDagenham East (District line)\n\nDagenham East was first named Dagenham in 1885 when it was opened by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. The District line didn’t arrive until 1902 but got withdrawn in 1905 before being reinstated in 1932. The station received its present name in 1949.\n\nDagenham Heathway (District line)\n\nOne station west of Dagenham East, Dagenham Heathway was opened as Heathway which opened in 1932 and was a later addition on the District line. The station was renamed to its present name in 1949 as Dagenham East. Hence there are two Dagenham stations on the District line.\n\nDebden (Central line)\n\nDebden was first opened as Chigwell Road in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway. In December of the same year, it was renamed Chigwell Lane. When the Central line arrived in 1949, it was renamed to its present name. There used to be a goods yard but that closed in 1966.\n\nEaling Common (District and Piccadilly lines)\n\nEaling Common station is an interesting one. It was actually named Ealing Common upon opening in 1879 by the District Railway (now District line). In 1886, the station was renamed Ealing Common & West Acton. In 1903, a new line was extended from Ealing Common & West Acton to Park Royal & Twyford Abbey (which was later replaced by Park Royal, a little south of the original in 1931). The station received its present name once again in 1910.\n\nEmbankment (Bakerloo, Circle, District and Northern lines)\n\nEmbankment has had a number of renames on several of its London Underground lines. The District and Circle line station was first opened by Charing Cross in 1870 by the District Railway.\n\nThe Bakerloo line station was opened as Embankment in 1906 and kept this name to the present day.\n\nThe Northern line station was opened as Charing Cross (Embankment) in 1914.\n\nWith the four lines connected, the station got renamed Charing Cross Embankment in 1974. In 1976, the station received its present name to allow the Bakerloo line station at Trafalgar Square and Northern line station at Strand to be renamed Charing Cross when the Jubilee line arrived in 1979.\n\nEuston Square (Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines)\n\nEuston Square was first opened as Gower Street by the Metropolitan Railway in 1863 and was part of the first ever Underground railway in the world. In 1909, the station received its present name. Although its requires walking at street level to reach Euston station, there are plans for the stations to be linked in the future should High Speed 2 happen.\n\nAnd that is part 4. Another part of this series coming soon!\n\n(Photo credits – all photos taken by me 😃 during the following periods: Dagenham East in August 2015, Dagenham Heathway in August 2015, Debden in June 2015, Ealing Common in January 2016, Embankment in October 2020 and Euston Square in June 2015)\n\nIt is not often you find mistakes on the London Underground (maybe there is a new blog series coming along here), but when they are found, it looks a little embarrassing to say the least. One great example of this is at Embankment station. If you walk down the corridor that connects the Bakerloo and Northern lines and walk towards the Bakerloo line, you will find the following line diagram.\n\nLooking closer, you will see one station named Willesden Junct (they didn’t quite get the name Junction written there!). And that is because behind the Junction label is an embarrassing mistake, so what is under it?\n\nWell if you walk further down the corridor, you will find a line diagram that got away with it – yes, it says Willesden Green! Of course, that station is not on the Bakerloo line, it is on the Jubilee line.\n\nOh dear! I’m sure I will be having more of these blogs in the near future, so do watch out for more mistakes on the London Underground!\n\n(Photo credits – all photos taken by me in August and December 2019 😃)"
