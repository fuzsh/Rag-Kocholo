        "text": "Iconic map reimagined into a circular design to promote the latest Circle to Search with Google* feature on Samsung’s Galaxy S24\n\nMap showing 11 London Underground lines will be on display on five Circle line platforms\n\nWrapped station entrances at Victoria will also promote the ‘Circle to Search’ line\n\nLONDON, UK – January 31st, 2024 – The iconic Harry Beck Tube Map has been reimagined for the first time in over 90 years, as part of a new partnership between Transport for London (TfL) and Samsung, to promote the Circle to Search with Google feature on the newly launched Samsung Galaxy S24.\n\nIn a transformative collaboration, the world-famous Tube Map, which was designed by Harry Beck in 1933, has been reimagined into a circle to more clearly emphasise the Circle line. The temporary redesign champions the new Circle to Search with Google feature – a new tool on the Galaxy S24 device where users can instantly search anything you see on your phone, without switching apps. It can quickly help you find a recipe for something delicious you saw on social or where to buy the shirt someone’s wearing in a photo by drawing a simple gesture with the S Pen or finger.\n\nAs part of the two-week collaborative takeover, the limited-edition map, which has been designed to work as a functional map of the Tube network, will be on display on Circle line platforms at five stations: King’s Cross, Blackfriars, Westminster, Liverpool Street, Paddington. While not replacing the current Tube map, it shows all 11 London Underground lines, and also temporarily shows the Circle line as the ‘Circle to Search’ line.\n\nAnnika Bizon, Director of Marketing, Omnichannel & Head of Ireland – MX Division said: “We’re thrilled to partner with Transport for London to bring our new technology to life for people across the capital with this exciting redesign of the iconic TfL Tube map.\n\n“The launch of the Galaxy S24 Series with the new Circle to Search with Google feature marks a new era of mobile experience for Samsung, and we’re proud to commemorate the devices going on sale today with this activation.”\n\nEmma Strain, Customer Director at Transport for London (TfL) said: “We’re delighted to partner with Samsung on this exciting reimagining of our iconic map for the first time in 90 years. Partnerships like this help us and brands engage with hundreds of thousands of people who pass through our stations every day.”\n\nThe Kings Cross advertising takeover will be the largest of its kind at one of the busiest Tube stations in London, reaching everyone who travels through the station over the campaign period. The two glass entrances at Victoria Underground station will also be creatively wrapped with the limited-edition map, as well as feature bespoke roundels highlighting the Circle to Search line to further promote the partnership.\n\nThe partnership, activated by media agency Starcom and creative marketing agency Iris, and booked via Global, the Media and Entertainment Group, will be live from the 31st of January to the 13th of February with a potential footfall of 11.7 million across the stations it’s being activated in during this time. With promotion across 100+ advertising sites, the media campaign is set to deliver 152 million+ out-of-home advertising impacts.\n\nIn tandem with the TfL activation, Samsung is introducing ‘Samsung Circle the City’ – an above-ground running route following the Circle Line to amplify the Galaxy S24’s Circle to Search with Google, with members of its community set to take on the challenge on the 3rd of February.\n\nCredits:\n\nCreative Agency: Iris\n\nMedia Support: Starcom & Global\n\nPR Support: Ketchum\n\nSocial Activation: Coolr\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nFor more information about TfL’s commercial partnership work – please visit https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/business-and-advertisers/commercial-media\n\nWhile some maps on platforms will be changed to this limited-edition design, there will still be traditional Harry Beck maps available in the station and in-train announcements, announcements within the stations and staff on platforms will continue to help customers should they require it.\n\nWhile the map has evolved since Harry Beck’s original map in 1933, as new stations, lines and facilities are added – this is the first time TfL has produced an official map for its network that differs from the Beck design.\n\n*Results may vary depending on visual matches.
