        "text": "Blackfriars Station opened as St Paul's Station in 1886. Built by the London, Chatham & Dover Railway (who also constructed the railway bridge). Renamed Blackfriars in 1937. The station was rebuilt and reopened along with an underground station in 1977. The main service using the station is the Thameslink service which includes trains to and from Bedford, St Albans City and Luton in the north; and Brighton, Sutton and Sevenoaks in the south. The station has now been extended onto Blackfriars railway Bridge."
