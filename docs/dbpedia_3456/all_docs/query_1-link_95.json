        "text": "If losing time on a circular line is difficult then gaining or recovering time is next to impossible. Skipping stops is not a realistic option on the London Underground for anything other than the Metropolitan Line. More aggressive driving can achieve a limited effect but is generally only condoned on ATO lines when it is controlled centrally. Terminating short of destination does not work on a circle line and neither does taking advantage of the built-in recovery time at a terminus. A basic rule of thumb: Continuous Circling Compounds Delays, Terminating Trains Absorb Delays.\n\nOther Operating Problems\n\nOther problems can include the issue of the driver needing a physical needs break (go to the toilet), what to do with the train if a relief driver does not appear at a crew change and uneven wear on the wheels if a train consistently goes round in one direction. In London problems are compounded by it being impractical for the depot to be on the route of the line itself.\n\nA further problem is that it is very difficult to change the number of trains providing a service during the day so off-peak and peak hour services are run with the same number of trains. One might expect peak hour frequencies to be the same as off-peak frequencies but it is actually worse than that because it takes longer to make the journey in the peak. Depending on the timetable one has to offer a fixed number of trains per hour and realistically, at best, one can go to the odd half a train per hour. So in its later years, when running as a circle, the Circle Line off-peak service at 7.5 trains per hour (tph) was actually better than the peak service (7tph).\n\nIf all the above were not bad enough, the continuous Circle Line was a very unpopular duty made worse by the fact that the journey was all most entirely in tunnel and very repetitive without a break. This led to union agreements about the maximum number of circles that could be done without a break and the maximum that could be done in a day which then constrained the duty roster for the timetable. So not only was the line difficult to run, it was also difficult to timetable.\n\nIf it is a bad idea – why do it?\n\nAn obvious question to ask therefore is why, if it was known to be such a bad idea, did the Circle Line remain as a service? The answer seems to be that, despite its known horrors, it was just too difficult to get rid of. In fact one could argue with some evidence that London Underground and its predecessors spent an entire century trying unsuccessfully to get rid of the Circle Line.\n\nFrank Pick’s dislike of the Circle Line\n\nFrank Pick was one of the people, perhaps the main guiding light, whose influence even today is largely responsible for making the London Underground an organised well-designed integrated product. Back in 1919, as commercial manager of the London Electric Railways Group, he had already grown to dislike the Circle Line. No doubt the awkwardness and difficulty of operating the Circle Line would have been totally contrary to the simplicity and sense of order that he strove for. More particularly, in 1919, he disliked the fact that the Circle Line was taking up running slots that he believed could more usefully and more profitably used to bring in what we would now call commuters from further afield.\n\nIn 1919 the District Line to the west would have had branches to Wimbledon, Richmond, Hounslow, Ealing Broadway and South Harrow. It could have been worse but at least by now the Middle and Outer Circle no longer ran. One could have understood Frank Pick’s frustration. It seems that, in essence, he thought that by abolishing the Circle Line you could replace each Circle Line train by two starting from a District Line branch in the west. One of these trains would be a District Line one taking up the southern slot via Victoria. The other would be one from the still-rival Metropolitan Railway which would go via High St Kensington and the northern part of the Circle Line and continue to East London. Nothing came of the idea which may have been, in part, because the plan may have required the repeal of the clause in the 1879 act requiring a Circle Line to be run.\n\nLooking at an old idea in a modern context\n\nIt probably worth looking at Frank Pick’s idea in a little more detail because in a modern content it actually reveals an awful lot about the Circle Line and ideas in planning underground lines in general.\n\nThe modern equivalent of Frank Pick’s idea would be to send a Circle Line train starting from Hammersmith (Hammersmith & City and Circle Line station) then continuing around the circle via Aldgate but from Gloucester Road it would leave the current Circle line to divert to Earl’s Court and then down to Wimbledon. It would then return to Earl’s Court and go via High St Kensington to Edgware Road taking up a Circle Line slot for its critical path through Praed St junction.\n\nThe crushing flaw in the plan would appear to be that altering the Circle Line like this would increase the number of sub-surface trains through Earl’s Court by about 50% which nowadays is simply not possible. One wonders if Frank Pick had any plans to deal with this or whether it would not have been a problem in 1919 or he had simply overlooked the issue?\n\nWhat is possibly more interesting is to look at a variant of the scheme where one avoids Earl’s Court by sending trains Wimbledon trains to and from the south part of the Circle Line via a new link (possibly via King’s Road, Chelsea). Then one has an opportunity to bring many more people into the centre of London. Nowadays this however would be considered irresponsible because one is increasing capacity into London without increasing capacity within London.\n\nThe modern approach would probably be to reduce the number of Underground branch lines by providing a new central section. This cannot be done for the District Line alone because there is only one branch to the east. One could however take over the branch of another line such as the Central Line. So a line from Wimbledon to Epping would neatly free up extra capacity on the District Line and the overcrowded Central Line. This is, of course, a variation of the proposed Chelsea-Hackney Line which for around forty years was seen as the way forward – until Crossrail 2 proposals came along.\n\nThe other reason that Frank Pick’s idea is so interesting is that it really enables us to give an good answer to the question “What is the purpose of the Circle Line ?”. Turning Frank Pick’s idea on its head, one could argue that the purpose of the Circle Line is to use otherwise unusable capacity between Aldgate and Edgware Road via Victoria.\n\nThe idea of getting rid of the Circle Line will not go away\n\nIn 1933 the London Passenger Transport Board was formed and the Metropolitan Railway and the District Line came under the same organisation. Frank Pick was its Vice-chairman. Today we would probably have called his post “chief executive”. As well as day-to-day issues the board quickly got themselves involved in initiating solutions to outstanding major transport issues. We have already seen their initiation of a scheme for new tunnels between Finchley Road and Baker Street and for the Bakerloo Line to take over the hopelessly overcrowded Stanmore branch and most inner suburban stations of the Metropolitan Line.\n\nAnother thing the board did surprisingly quickly was to get the clause in the 1879 act requiring a Circle Line to be provided to be revoked. This they had done within 16 months of being in existence. It would not be hard to guess who probably was the driving force in getting the relevant clause repealed.\n\nIn April 1934 Frank Pick was already writing to Kensington Council supplying details of a proposal to run a shuttle service from South Kensington to Edgware Road and promising the reconstruction of South Kensington station to provided cross-platform interchange with the District Line there. This was no doubt do-able but would have been enormously disruptive and expensive with a need to keep a service running most of the time.\n\nIt is not surprising that nothing became of this proposed South Kensington – Edgware Road shuttle and it is difficult to see any real tangible benefit in providing it. At first sight one can put this down to one man and his obsession. It may well be though that the reason for pursuing this idea had changed. We know in that by 1928 the section of the Underground between Mansion House and South Kensington was the busiest two-track section and on it during the rush hours an incredible frequency of 40tph were timetabled. This would have been very difficult to sustain especially as usage went up and it may be that Pick was not planning to run more trains but fewer. In other words this section was probably running beyond its sustainable capacity and the least painful way to sort it out was simply to stop running the Circle Line trains through it.\n\nIt seemed that at the time it was only Frank Pick who was determined to see the elimination of the Circle Line happen and he was already not in the best of health. When he died in 1941 it seemed that the this scheme died with him. Obviously there was a war on and any further consideration would have to wait until the cessation of hostilities.\n\nThe Post-War Plan\n\nFrank Pick’s plan may have died but the idea of getting rid of the Circle Line had not. In 1941 relocated Circle Line platforms opened at King’s Cross. Previously they had been inconveniently sited next to what is now the former King’s Cross Thameslink platforms. Included in the rebuilding was an extra platform between the running lines to conveniently terminate trains from the west. The original plan was that is would be used for extending some of the off-peak trains that then terminated at Baker Street. This did not really make much sense. Why bother? Alternatively why not terminate at Liverpool Street or Aldgate? It was now proposed to make use of this for a “turn and a half” Circle Line service.\n\nThe idea this time was to start at Putney Bridge, go to Edgware Road and from there to a complete circuit of the Circle Line before continuing to King’s Cross. No explanation was offered as to how Earl’s Court would cope with the extra trains. On the Baker St – King’s Cross it was proposed to introduce speed controlled signalling to handle 40 trains per hour. The speed controlled signalling could be thought of as very crude Automatic Train Protection system with the control mechanism being track based rather than train based.\n\nIt is not surprising that the turn-and-a-half scheme came to nothing. For starters it had the feel of someone starting off by trying to make use of an unused recently-built potential asset (that platform at King’s Cross) rather than solving a problem. It was also quite expensive in cash-strapped post-war Britain as it involved making the terminating facility at King’s Cross fit for use, extra rolling stock and signalling changes. In retrospect it is hard to believe that it wouldn’t cause as many problems as it solved.\n\nA further complication to the original turn-and-a-half proposal which was originally made in 1948 was that proposed railway plans for a post-war London were being optimistically firmed up and one of the proposals was a route ‘C’ from Walthamstow to Brixton. This would clearly compete for funds and management time. There was also a proposal for a variant on route C to go to Fulham Broadway after Victoria and from there take over the District Line to Wimbledon. This was now seriously complicating the issue. With the Victoria Line serving King’s Cross it was questionable how useful additional trains on the Circle Line would be and, as well as that, the impact on of route C going to Fulham Broadway would now have to be taken into account. The turn-and-a-half scheme was dropped and revived again then died a death in this particular form for a final time. The scheme followed the 1949 Bakerloo Line extension to Camberwell in a list of “what might have been” for the period.\n\nFurther Ideas\n\nThe last decade of the 20th century saw some further half-hearted schemes. A couple of them seemed more intent with trying of find a use for the much-unloved 1983 stock that was replaced on the Jubilee Line in preparation for the opening of the Jubilee Line Extension. A simpler, more sensible was the idea of simply getting the Hammersmith & City Line to do a turn-and-a-half. This was actually put into practice for the Notting Hill Carnival in 1990, 1991 and 1992.\n\nThe idea of the turn-and-a-half Hammersmith & City for daily use was ultimately rejected on two grounds. The first was because of the limited ability to recover from major delays. This does sound surprising because it surely had to be better than the arrangement then in existence. It also seems completely at odds with what eventually happened which is really remarkably similar in concept although operated as two separate services. The second reason for rejection is that it was too complicated and too confusing for passengers. Apart from possibly suggesting that Carnival attenders must have higher than average intelligence, this seems inconsistent with experiences abroad – as we shall see in part 2. This reason for rejection also seems inconsistent with what actually subsequently happened which is very similar in nature.\n\nIt is clear that, despite every attempt to break the continuous circle being either stillborn or regarded as unworkable, London Underground had not given up the idea of getting rid of a continuous Circle Line. To quote the final paragraph of the book “The Circle Line” (see below):\n\nFinally we have Mr Derek Smith, then managing director of London Underground, addressing the London Regional Passengers Committee on 24th November 1999 – ‘The Circle Line’s contribution to the totality of the network is not large, and it makes control of shared lines difficult. It is not the right design, and in the long term the question is whether it should continue’.\n\nIn part 2 we look at how London Underground tackled the issue of the Circle Line in the 21st century. For comparison we also look a few other cities and see how they deal with this issue.\n\nThe bulk of the background for this article was either obtained from or verified using The Circle Line by Desmond Croome. Like all books in this series it packs an awful lot of information into its 80 pages and is highly recommended for further reading although it pretty much stops at the end of the 20th century. Despite the title it also includes coverage of the Hammersmith & City Line from Hammersmith to Paddington."
