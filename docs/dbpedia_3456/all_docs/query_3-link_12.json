        "text": "The iconic new Blackfriars station is the first station to span the Thames. It offers passengers longer trains and more frequent services, easier connections to the London Underground and step-free access to both banks of the Thames.\n\nThe station is an integral part of the Â£7 billion Thameslink railway through the heart of London. The construction of the new station presented a number of logistical challenges in re-using a historic bridge, construction over the River Thames and keeping the railway open for passengers.\n\nNew Blackfriars Station\n\nThe scope of the project was to construct an iconic new London station spanning the Thames as part of the wider Thameslink Programme.\n\nThe goals of the project were to increase line capacity by accommodating a much higher frequency of longer trains; improve the experience of passengers by building more and bigger platforms; improve accessibility and interchange with the London Underground and to radically improve the sustainability of the station in terms of C02 emissions and consumption if grid energy."
