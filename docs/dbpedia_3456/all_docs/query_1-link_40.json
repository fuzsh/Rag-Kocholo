        "text": "The guides on how to travel between Victoria station and the other London stations are focused on, or at least include, the easiest routes, so that the simpler alternatives when travelling with heavy luggage or with young children etc can be followed.\n\nAlso note the advice for travel to a station from Victoria can vary from that on how to access Victoria from another station, for multiple reasons including the availability of lifts (elevators) in various locations and the access to and from bus stops.\n\nAt weekends the Underground lines and both the Elizabeth line and Thameslink trains can be impacted by construction work, those affecting the Underground and Elizabeth line trains can be looked up here, while those impacting the Thameslink trains, can be found here.\n\nWhat aren't included below are guides to how to travel to and from the other stations in central London, which are primarily also used by trains which travel between destinations to the south of the city and the capital.\n\nThis is because the the easiest means of accessing a different central London terminus when on a train to Victoria, is usually by making a connection at an interchange station in South London, Surrey or Kent:\n\nAshford International for London Bridge, Waterloo and Charing Cross\n\nClapham Junction for Waterloo\n\nBromley South and Herne Hill for Blackfriars\n\nEast Croydon or Gatwick Airport for London Bridge; connect at London Bridge for Cannon Street and Charing Cross\n\nRochester for London Bridge; connect at London Bridge for Charing Cross and Waterloo.\n\nThe entrance to the Underground station in Victoria is right in front of the station, by the taxi rank, there is now a lift (elevator) down into its ticket hall, you don't have to use the staircases.\n\nIn the newly enlarged ticket hall, you can't miss the escalators which lead down to the Victoria line as they are just off to the right, though a lift (elevator) is available which provides an alternative route to the trains.\n\nThe access to the Circle and District lines is through the passage way over to the left.\n\nIn this other entrance hall above these two lines, lifts (elevators) are available to each of the platforms, eastbound and westbound, but because these are sub-surface lines, which are not that far below street level, the only other access to these trains is by using short staircases.\n\nThe bus station at Victoria station, pictured at the top of the page, is impossible to miss, as it's directly ahead on the other side of the taxi rank.\n\nThough most of the buses which serve the station, depart from other stops on the surrounding streets.\n\nThe eastbound Circle Line train from Liverpool Street is direct to Victoria station, but it's a comparatively slow twelve stop journey and the trains are comparatively infrequent, you can wait for more than 15 minutes.\n\nThough it's a comparatively easy journey if you have luggage etc, the access to the eastbound Circle line is adjacent to the entrance to the Underground station in Liverpool Street and lift (elevator) is available at Victoria.\n\nThough if you don't mind using escalators and squeezing on to tube trains, the quicker alternative is take a westbound Central line train to Oxford Circus to connect there for a southbound Victoria line train.\n\nAlso if your train towards London calls at Seven Sisters or Tottenham Hale stations, the better option is to connect into the southbound Victoria line at those stations instead.\n\nHowever, if time is in your side, board London's most scenic regular bus route/line, the 26, as it stops by Victoria station.\n\nThe Victoria line is the busiest on the Underground so squeezing on to a southbound train is nearly always somewhat fraught, particularly if you will be travelling with luggage.\n\nHowever, it's by far the most logical public transport option when heading to Victoria from Euston.\n\nThe bus route 390 to Victoria doesn't use the conveniently sited bus station, which is conveniently sited directly in front of the railway station, when travelling in this direction.\n\nInstead it departs from stop H, which is on the other side of Euston Road.\n\nBut if using a deep level 'tube' is something you'd pay to avoid and time is on your side, the trains operated by Southern, which usually connect Milton Keynes to Clapham Junction and East Croydon, provide a step-free alternative.\n\nMost of the trains which depart from Victoria will call at Clapham Junction and all of the longer-distance routes operated by Southern, call at East Croydon.\n\nThough these trains which typically depart from Milton Keynes are currently commencing their journeys at Watford Junction.\n\nThe opening of the Elizabeth Line hasn't impacted on the route from Paddington, so the only direct rail link is by taking the Circle line.\n\nThough due to the lack of step-free access to the part of the Underground station that the eastbound Circle line trains use, plus the typical 12 min interval between trains, it can be easier to take a bus on line, route 36 instead.\n\nThe bus which will be heading towards New Cross will leave from stop E\n\nIt's easily located if you head towards the Elizabeth line station as it is adjacent to Eastbourne Terrace, the road on which the bus stop is located.\n\nThis second version of ShowMeTheJourney is exciting and new, so we are genuinely thrilled that you are here and reading this, but we also need your help.\n\nWeâre striving not to let anything get in the way of providing the most useful service possible, hence a facility has been set up with DonorBox which can be used to support the running costs and make improvements.\n\nInstead of advertising or paywalls, your financial support will make a positive difference to delivering an enhanced service, as thereâs a lot of ideas which we want to make happen.\n\nSo if you have found the info provided here to be useful, please go here to say thank you."
