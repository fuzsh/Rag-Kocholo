        "text": "Something I've noticed recently getting on train into Central from Cathcart in the mornings:\n\nId usually get on at the front and usually it would be crammed through MFL (people standing along the aisles) - making me think the whole train is overcapacity. Recently however I have now tended to sit towards the back as usually can get a seat and not packed in like sardines and therefore more comfortable.\n\nWhat are others experience of this in the line between Cathcart and Central via Queens Park?\n\nFunnily enough I've started doing the exact same. I tend to take the 07.42 in the mornings and would always get on at the front and stand in the vestibule or squeeze in next to someone at a table. Nowadays I get on towards the rear and often end up with a pair of seats to myself.\n\nRecently however I have now tended to sit towards the back as usually can get a seat and not packed in like sardines and therefore more comfortable.\n\nI do the same, at all times of the day, if I'm not in a hurry, however there is a very real time penalty getting through the barriers at Central, especially of course in the morning peak when the queue can add minutes to the overall journey time (not helped by the number of tickets that do not operate the barriers, behind one such I often seem to end up!). So I would think exiting the platform quickly drives many passengers to prefer the front coaches.\n\nI do the same, at all times of the day, if I'm not in a hurry, however there is a very real time penalty getting through the barriers at Central, especially of course in the morning peak when the queue can add minutes to the overall journey time (not helped by the number of tickets that do not operate the barriers, behind one such I often seem to end up!). So I would think exiting the platform quickly drives many passengers to prefer the front coaches.\n\nHmm... getting back on topic, perhaps one of the advantages of conversion to light rail is that not everyone would be piling off the train at Central station, but at various points along the street running sections depending on their ultimate destination.\n\nSomeone will inevitably tell me why this is a bad idea...\n\nBut, why not avoid Central altogether by diverting the Cathcart circle (and the Paisley Canal line) onto the other bridge across the Clyde on the line to High Street? Then build a new terminus in the car park behind Argyll Street Station on the site of the old St Enoch Station.\n\nIt'd take some imaginative new track alignments to make the junctions work but you could then run it as a closed metro system at a higher frequency. You could also integrate some trains from the East End on the North Clyde line too?\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised to see this as an option when the detailed Clyde Metro proposals emerge. There are plans to demolish and redevelop the St Enoch Centre so there may be an opportunity to locate the metro terminus on or near St Enoch Square providing interchange with heavy rail and subway.\n\nSomeone will inevitably tell me why this is a bad idea...\n\nBut, why not avoid Central altogether by diverting the Cathcart circle (and the Paisley Canal line) onto the other bridge across the Clyde on the line to High Street?

You could also integrate some trains from the East End on the North Clyde line too?\n\nIt'd be very tricky to get the vertical alignment south of the Clyde as you'd have to get across the existing infrastructure, under the M8, and then rise up again to meet the City Unions all in a very short space.\n\nBut, why not avoid Central altogether by diverting the Cathcart circle (and the Paisley Canal line) onto the other bridge across the Clyde on the line to High Street?\n\nNo thanks! I regularly use this route to Glasgow, and arriving at Central is infinitely preferable to being dumped in the run-down east end because a) Central is well placed for the shopping areas and b) provides rail connections to multiple other routes, suburban, regional and long distance. I should perhaps add c) Central provides all the facilities expected of a major rail terminal, which I doubt any tram stop would.\n\na metro that dumps people at the edge of the city centre isn’t all that useful.\n\nIndeed it is not!\n\nAs an aside, re-opening the City Union line (ie Shields Junction to High Street Junction) to heavy rail passenger services is regularly suggested; Last time it cropped up on Facebook I asked the supporters exactly what train service they thought would use the line, ie diversion of existing trains away from Central (again, as above, no thanks!) or additional (and therefore unjustifiable) trains - Not one person replied.\n\nNo thanks!

Glasgow has a lot of rail lines serving the city but run at very low frequencies. he Cathcart Circle, Paisley Canal line, North Clyde Line and Argyll line would be better run at a turn up and go frequency. Rather than traditional heavy rail you'd get far more from them by running them like a high frequency metro. Which is what basically any other European city would do.\n\nAs an aside - I've never understood the urge to run tram trains - the heavy rail lines already exist! There's no need for slower, smaller trains on existing lines.\n\nCentral is a bottleneck - we can't run a metro from it's platforms (or even at a significantly higher frequency) as is, and there's no prospects of a through service onto eg. the Argyll Line or the North Clyde Line.\n\nYou could divert the Paisley and Cathcart lines onto the Union Line and branch off to join the Argyll line on/under the obscenely large St Enoch Centre site. You've then got a big public transport hub in the centre of the city and less than 200m from Central that's integrated with the Glasgow Subway. You could even fit a travellator between them, but passengers for Central could just travel one more stop on the now frequent metro trains.\n\nIt's a huge investment, but you'd turn a disjointed and clunky heavy rail network across Glasgow into something modern and efficient. Passenger numbers would jump and you'd be able to get a lot of busses off of the roads.\n\nWould the Scottish Government fund it? Probably not. But also I'm unconvinced that the tiny, gradual changes that the Scottish Government tend to suggest provide much in the way of value for money. Sometimes you need radical change.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised to see this as an option when the detailed Clyde Metro proposals emerge. There are plans to demolish and redevelop the St Enoch Centre so there may be an opportunity to locate the metro terminus on or near St Enoch Square providing interchange with heavy rail and subway.\n\nStrangely the St Enoch Centre is built on the St Enoch Station. Closed many years ago with the trains diverted to Central. Using the City Union bridge to cross the river.\n\nAmazing how if you wait long enough history can repeat itself.\n\nWhat probably would be more useful would be to serve Central and continue along the Riverside to pick up the Botanic Gardens lines. Avoiding the already congested Argyle Line.\n\nCould be major cash to access the Botanic Gardens line. The original line has been built on by housing in the years after closure.\n\nA heavy rail solution would be sensible though.\n\nGlasgow has a lot of rail lines serving the city but run at very low frequencies. he Cathcart Circle, Paisley Canal line, North Clyde Line and Argyll line would be better run at a turn up and go frequency.\n\nIn my experience the levels of current usage do not require greater frequencies, except perhaps on the Cathcart Circle where the all-day pre-Covid timetable should be restored ASAP, to provide two trains per hour on the Maxwell Park side of the Circle and four per hour on the Queens Park side.\n\nYou could divert the Paisley and Cathcart lines onto the Union Line and branch off to join the Argyll line on/under the obscenely large St Enoch Centre site.\n\n1. Reroute Cathcart and Paisley Canal services onto the City Union Line and into the Argyle Line tunnel. High frequency ‘heavy metro‘ trains would run through the tunnel to the West End, Dalmuir and Milngavie via the reopened Botanics tunnel and a new link between Botanic Gardens and Hyndland. Another branch would diverge at Exhibition Centre and continue to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Renfrew and the airport via a new line, crossing the Clyde, probably via a tunnel.\n\n2. Reroute Cathcart and Paisley Canal services onto the City Union Line and into a new terminus at St Enoch Square.\n\n3. Reroute Cathcart and Paisley Canal services onto the City Union Line and into a new terminus at Argyle Street station.\n\nOption 1 would be preferred but would cost billions so probably won’t happen.\n\nAny of these suggestions would cost billions! Given that there is a) no connection between the Cathcart Circle and the City Union line, and b) no connection between the City Union line and the routes heading west, via both Central and Queen Street Low Levels. And, as I said before, any diversion of services away from Glasgow Central destroys the connectional possibilities there.\n\nAny of these suggestions would cost billions! Given that there is a) no connection between the Cathcart Circle and the City Union line, and b) no connection between the City Union line and the routes heading west, via both Central and Queen Street Low Levels. And, as I said before, any diversion of services away from Glasgow Central destroys the connectional possibilities there.\n\nMost cities are willing to pay a bit for infrastructure. Make do and mend with the current setup means that Glasgow has rail lines everywhere that are underused and really incredibly badly integrated. Never seen anywhere as bad as Glasgow on that front. It desperately needs conversion from an outdated train service to something more modern.\n\nBesides, how much traffic is lost because people can't rely on an infrequent train that stops frequently, with poor connections to the Subway and other routes.\n\nThere needs to be turn up and go services on the suburban lines that link up with the subway and other routes. You need to pay for that.\n\nAny of these suggestions would cost billions!\n\nThat's very true, but the government and local authorities seem to be prepared to spend billions on the Clyde Metro project - I believe 16 billion was the most recent quoted potential cost.\n\nAnd, as I said before, any diversion of services away from Glasgow Central destroys the connectional possibilities there.\n\nNot necessarily. Connections could easily still be maintained through whatever means, be it a new hub at St Enoch or connections to the North Clyde or Argyle lines. Theoretically, redirecting Cathcart services onto the NCL would maintain connections to the centre through Queen Street low level, and introduce new connections to the east end, though of course you'd need to slot trains in alongside existing services. An on-street line could easily still connect to Central also, alongside providing cross-city connections to Queen Street and Buchanan bus station. And if the walkway from Queen Street to Central is built, then it matters little if a line connects directly to Central or not, as long as it connects to Queen Street.\n\nMore seriously, it depends on the scope of the plan and how much money you're willing to throw at it.

Which is what basically any other European city would do.\n\nAs an aside - I've never understood the urge to run tram trains - the heavy rail lines already exist! There's no need for slower, smaller trains on existing lines.\n\nAgree for both, Its would take some investment in Glasgow but reorganising the railway to be more metro like would absolutely be a good thing and there's lots of options for how to re-route the lines, so it depends on what they choose to do. I think routing the southern lines westwards would be the best option though, because that results in a more balanced network.\n\nThere's little to no need for Tram Trains in this country, where they are successful is when a city already has a large tram network and an inconveniently placed central station (like Karlsruhe), but all major stations in this country are well placed so there's no reason for tram trains, since you can just run regular trains.\n\nMake do and mend with the current setup means that Glasgow has rail lines everywhere that are underused and really incredibly badly integrated. Never seen anywhere as bad as Glasgow on that front.\n\nI can't agree with that, the only real lack of integration in Glasgow is the separation of services between Central and Queen Street - And none of the proposals here overcome that!\n\nBesides, how much traffic is lost because people can't rely on an infrequent train that stops frequently, with poor connections to the Subway and other routes.\n\nI would also dispute the poor connections allegation, at Central there are multiple connecting services, to the south, east and west. The one area which IMHO does need to be addressed is fast services to Edinburgh, which could be resolved by reinstating the hourly Shotts limited stop and Cross Country's two-hourly Glasgow trains. And I don't believe that exchanging all the connectional possibilities at Central for an easier interchange with the Subway (which at St Enoch is not exactly far from Central anyway) is in any way an advance.\n\nThat's very true, but the government and local authorities seem to be prepared to spend billions on the Clyde Metro project\n\nI remain to be convinced that those billions will actually be forthcoming!\n\nI can only reiterate that as a regular user of the Cathcart Circle route I am perfectly happy with the location and connectional possibilities of the current terminus at Central, and the service frequency (except that the missing pre-Covid services should be restored ASAP). None of the proposals mentioned here appeal to me in any way, the opposite in fact.\n\nI can't agree with that, the only real lack of integration in Glasgow is the separation of services between Central and Queen Street - And none of the proposals here overcome that!\n\nI would also dispute the poor connections allegation, at Central there are multiple connecting services, to the south, east and west.

None of the proposals mentioned here appeal to me in any way, the opposite in fact.\n\nPoor connections as in the city centre railways are treated like suburban/rural lines with infrequent services (that stop completely far too early!) and a lack of joined up ticketing.\n\nAs in - for a hypothetical journey of St George's Cross to Queen's Park you need to get a subway ticket/tap in with your card, tap out at Buchanan Street/St Enoch, walk to Central, buy a ticket from a vending machine, check the board for the next departure find a platform, wait (could be anything up to a 1hr wait, but usually 30 mins). This is actually a very simple example, it gets far more complex than this.\n\nWith a metro system it's turn up and go. You might need to switch lines at connections but normally never wait more than 10 minutes. Travelling point to point from anywhere is simple and doesn't take much thought.\n\nThere's little to no need for Tram Trains in this country, where they are successful is when a city already has a large tram network and an inconveniently placed central station (like Karlsruhe), but all major stations in this country are well placed so there's no reason for tram trains, since you can just run regular trains.\n\nFor the most part, I agree with this. Certainly there seems to be a tendency for local politicians to suggest tram-trains if there's an election coming up... presumably because it (a) sounds fancy; and (b) probably sounds more achievable/affordable than a heavy-rail proposal. There's a danger that tram-train becomes the go-to \"solution in need of a problem\" as is the case with TfGM's Glossop/Hadfield idea.\n\nThere are a few cities with poorly-sited \"main\" stations where a tram or tram-train solution would be ideal, Bristol being the obvious example. I'd argue that Glasgow does not fall into that category though.\n\nFor the most part, I agree with this.

They even added an additional heavy rail route that is now used by heavy rail\n\nThat proposal may soon be achieved by a conventional tram route to a different line of route."
