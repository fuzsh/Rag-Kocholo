Central location and low budget don’t always go together. But a good location near a tube/train station helps.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nI would be comfortable taking the tube.\n\nI converted dollars into pounds and assuming that I did it correctly ABOUT 133 pounds per night but I require free breakfast and wi fi.\n\nBack to American Dollars. I want to pay less than $200 per night again with free breakfast and free wi fi. I want a private bathroom as well.\n\nI often go through booking.com but also use the hotel's web site. Sometimes you get a. deal if you book three or more nights or book well in advance.\n\nI am even willing to stay an entire week for a good price.\n\nI got a good deal at a Marriott in Seattle because I am registered with their rewards and am a senior citizen. I do not know if I would get the same dela in London.\n\nPosted by Linda\n\nSeattle, WA, USA\n\n1388 posts\n\nBostonphil, given your parameters I would look at Premier Inns. I stayed at Premier Inn Waterloo (Westminster) for 4 nights in September and paid £520 for the stay. They probably charge for breakfast, my guess around £10. The hotel was renovating their restaurant at the time of my stay so they could not offer the breakfast. I booked the room directly with Premier Inns.\n\nThe location was great for my purposes. There are several Tube stations nearby, it was an easy walk across the bridge into the area surrounding Westminster, Buckingham Palace, Green Garden, etc. There was a pretty good fish n chips place near Waterloo station and for breakfast, I went to Gails Bakery just down the street. Very good coffee and pastries along with porridge (the counter person even added some blueberries to my bowl upon request).\n\nIf you enjoy a hot bowl of Asian noodle soup, Wagamama is the trick. There are numerous locations throughout London. I enjoyed my soup ona cold rainy night at the Tower of London before seeing the Ceremony of the Keys.\n\nI was a single female traveler in London for the first time and did not feel uncomfortable in the neighborhood. I did try to return to my room before nightfall on most nights. Mostly because I was pretty tired by the end of a touring day.\n\nHappy travels.\n\nHope you enjoy your stay.\n\nPosted by Linda\n\nSeattle, WA, USA\n\n1388 posts\n\nYou like food markets. Borough Market, East of where I was staying and not far from London Bridge, is wonderful. There are so many choices of food stalls, it is difficult to make up your mind. I had a scrumptious plate of paella.\n\nPosted by darrenblois\n\nMoncton NB\n\n1086 posts\n\nI think you'll be happy in Bloomsbury:\n\nBritish Museum and British Library;\n\nif using train, handy to Euston, Kings Cross and St Pancras\n\nshort walks into Soho/West End and the City;\n\nserved by Northern, Central, Piccadilly, Metropolitan/Circle/Hammersmith & City, and Elizabeth Lines;\n\ndozens of budget hotels. Fave is the Celtic (http://www.stmargaretshotel.co.uk/W_e_l_c_o_m_e.html). Other good ones I've stayed in include the Morgan (https://www.morganhotel.co.uk/) and Ridgemount (https://ridgemounthotel.co.uk/);\n\ngood local pubs I can recommend include the Friend at Hand (near the Celtic Hotel and Russell Square Tube station) and the Museum (near the British Museum).\n\nPosted by Katheryne\n\nChattanooga, TN USA\n\n581 posts\n\nCheck The Wellington Hotel, across the street from Waterloo station. Smallish rooms, but spotlessly clean with updated bathrooms. Very nice breakfast included. Friendly, helpful staff. Downside is no elevator. It’s also located over a pub, so you may hear some noise (we didn’t). I checked some random dates next September on booking.com and it’s about $125/night for a single person.\n\nPosted by Claudia\n\nLand of La\n\n8956 posts\n\nI have PM’d you about an accommodation I’ve often stayed at while visiting London. Fits your description.\n\nThat said I’ve also stayed at Premier Inns.\n\nThey are well situated and cost effective for one of the most expensive cities on the planet.\n\nThere are regular PI’s and a brand called Hub by Premier Inn. Rooms in the latter are small. Well laid out but small. If traveling solo an option. If traveling as a couple investigate the PI at County Hall or the PI Victoria. County Hall is next door to the London Eye and its a 15 minute stroll across Westminster Bridge to the Houses of Parliament. If you went with Victoria its only a 10 minute amble to Buckingham Palace.\n\nPosted by geovagriffith\n\n7934 posts\n\nPremier Inns are the way to go.\n\nThere is some near the city center.\n\nPosted by lindypope\n\n45 posts\n\nWe just booked a Premier Inn for June for less than $200 a night for a family room (it's about $180 a night with current exchange rate) so I bet you can easily get under that for a single. We chose the County Hall one (by Waterloo) but there's a lot of options you can look at. You have to pay for breakfast but it is 10.5 pounds for a full buffet.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nThank you all for your responses.\n\nI will eventually get back to this post and respond.\n\nIt seems like several of you recommended Premier Inn. What about Ibis?\n\nTo be continued.\n\nPosted by Rebecca\n\nNashville, TN, USA\n\n3828 posts\n\nJust a quick comment about the \"price must include breakfast\" part.....\n\nThere are a number of coffee shops in London that offer a delicious panini style breakfast sandwich (hot ham, cheese & egg) for about $4.\n\nWe stayed at a Hilton, refused to add on their $35 per person, per day, breakfast to our reservation, so we walked about 2 blocks from there each morning and had one of the panini sandwiches I described. If I can remember the name of the chain we found, I'll add it here to my post. Sandwich $4, cup of coffee $1-2.\n\nWe have no experience staying at the Ibis, so cannot help there. Sorry.\n\nBut if you have a certain one in mind, do look it up on Trip Advisor, where you will see photos and comments posted by those who have stayed there.\n\nEDIT: Pret A Manger was the sandwich shop for breakfast. There are many all over London. Good sandwiches at lunch, too.\n\nCosta Coffee and Caffe Nero also have good coffee and inexpensive breakfast items.\n\nPosted by Frank II\n\nFreedonia\n\n15839 posts\n\nIbis are fine. If you are really budget oriented you could check out Travelodge.\n\nIn order, I would go Premier Inn, Ibis, Travelodge.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nI have been doing some research and discovered some great market places. Love markets\n\nLinda, I am not afraid of being out after dark. It is just that at my age, I am usually tired by dark and want to be back at the hotel.\n\nSame thing with nightlife. I loved nightlife when young but not so much when old. Still I love live music and if there is some in the afternoon or evenings, all the better. I no longer have much interest in going into bars, pubs or clubs. Prefer my music outside or at least in open spaces.\n\nPosted by Jennifer\n\nTunbridge Wells\n\n6113 posts\n\nPI booked well in advance are usually the best value. Their breakfasts are cheap compared to other hotels. There are many good breakfast options in cafes that would be cheaper. PI Hubs are cheaper but the rooms are small.\n\nIf you are on a budget, avoid Borough Market - some interesting food, but very expensive compared with other food offers in London.\n\nAnywhere in Zone 1 of the underground is the best area to look. Staying outside this zone will raise your transport costs.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nI have been having fun with booking.com. I am Genius I with them and get a small discount.\n\nI got a good price with Ibis in Earl's Court and a Holiday Inn Express in Earl's Court. I am putting in late April dates since it is too early to book next September. Just playing around.\n\nBoth hotels offered free breakfast and wi fi (although truthfully, we really do pay for them) plus a coffee machine in room. Free cancellation and no prepayment.\n\nIbis was just under $800 and Holiday Inn was just over $800. This was for five nights, so I believe.\n\nPI is not on booking.com\n\nPosted by phred\n\nLos Angeles\n\n4662 posts\n\nit doesn't sound like you've got a RS guidebook, because guess what? Rick makes all kinds of recommendations for places to eat and sleep and sightsee. he also has helpful orienting tools like, think of the important bits of London as being in a milk bottle lying on its side. check him out and watch some show.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nPhred, you are right.\n\nI do not have RS London. I will be checking out some of his videos and I did check out the guide book. A little while back, I was researching Rome and RS offered a lot of information on his site about Rome including excerpts from his guidebook.\n\nI do not see this about London.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nHi Jennifer,\n\nwell I have been researching Zone 1 of the Underground. I am learning about the tube and oyster cards.\n\nAren't the hotels in Zone 1 the more expensive hotels? It seems that Zone 1 is Central London from my research\n\nPosted by Beverly\n\nAustin, TX, USA\n\n39 posts\n\nIf you are willing to take the Tube, are you willing/able to make it up and down all the steps? There are escalators or lifts at some stations or for some sections of some stations, but don't count on it.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nBeverly\n\nI can not do many steps because of leg, back and foot problems. I had this problem recently in Seattle with the transit stations . I can do some steps but not a lot and definitely not with luggage.\n\nAre there not elevators if the escalators are not working?\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nI continue to research PI but I find the website confusing because I do not know where the locations are. They give the address but it means nothing to me.\n\nI did find Hubs and there was also a third one but I can not find the page where I read about the third one. There are the regular hotels, the HUB which are budget hotels and there is a third type offered by PI which is more basic than HUB and I assume less money but I can not find it. I found the page once. Does anyone know what I am talking about?\n\nI am very tired and going to bed now but tomorrow I will try again on the PI website.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nPhred\n\nI have spent some time watching YouTube videos on London.\n\nUnfortunately RS has very little recent ones on YouTube. He has some that are pre Covid but almost none Post Covid. He must not have had a chance to get back to London since COVID or perhaps he has not gotten caught up in his research and writing and producing content.\n\nPosted by MaryC\n\nLouisiana, USA\n\n369 posts\n\nIf you copy the address provided by Premier Inn, and put it in Google Maps, you can see where the hotel is located.\n\nPosted by Frank II\n\nFreedonia\n\n15839 posts\n\nSince Earls Court is \"my neighborhood\" in London let me talk to you about the 2 hotels you mentioned--the HI Express and the Ibis (Lillie Rd). Neither is really in Earls Court and are in Zone 2. Not a lot of restaurant choices near either and it's a bit of a hike to the closest tube station from the HI Express. I stayed at the Ibis, then a Ramada Inn, 30 years ago.\n\nA good rule of thumb, for first timers, is to get a map of the tube and stay within Zone 1. When you see a hotel you are interested in, find it on Google Maps and look for the closest tube station. Then see which zone it is in using the tube map.\n\nPosted by Nigel\n\nNorthamptonshire, England\n\n33347 posts\n\nif using the Tube - The Underground - you need to be ready for a lot of walking and a lot of stairs. The system has stairs everywhere. Even if you have an escalator down and up, there almost certainly will be a flight of stairs from the bottom of the escalator to the actual platforms, one each way. Sometimes these are on curves, Sometimes you will go down, over, up, over, down.\n\nThose of us used to the Tube don't really notice them, but they are most definitely there.\n\nIf a station has lifts they are not always in an obvious place nor do they always go where you need - expect an experience such as find the lift, go down. Out, walk to the next lift which gets you closer and take that down, and sometimes a third.\n\nKings Cross St Pancras I think takes the cake, my memory is that it is a total of 4 lifts to reach the entrance to St Pancras Station from the Piccadilly line. It can be done but patience is a virtue.\n\nTfL (Transport for London) put out a series of disabled and step free maps, they have very good information and are available onlline. Most stations have stairs - there is slow progress in making more stations step free but with hundreds of stations (the vast majority of them built many decades before disabled issues had any traction) it takes a very long time. There is an avoiding stairs map https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/avoiding-stairs-tube-guide.pdf and many other good maps including even a toilet map.\n\nHappy travels.\n\nDon't underestimate just how huge London is.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nIt is a good thing that I began my research early. because I had no idea just how huge London is and how complicated it would be for a hotel that works best for me.\n\nI can walk up some stairs but not with luggage.\n\nWhat do visitors do who have a lot of luggage? Do they take taxis or shuttles to and from the airport?\n\nThanks to all for all the links. Eventually I will click on.\n\nAnd I love google maps but i use it on my computer at home. I travel with an old iPad and an Android smart phone which I do not like. Have to do a lot of research at home before I leave.\n\nI will do some more research about Premier Inns since it is so well recommended. .\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\ndarrenblois\n\nThanks you for the recommendations . I checked them out and really like what I am reading.\n\nReading about the pubs, I am getting hungry.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nok so stay in Zone 1. Is that Central London?\n\nAnd do eat at pubs.\n\nI will be arriving at Southampton. I will be sailing Lisbon to Southampton spending a few days in London before flying home.\n\nI believe there is a National Express bus from Southampton to London??? Is there a better way to get to London from the port?\n\nPosted by darrenblois\n\nMoncton NB\n\n1086 posts\n\nYou're welcome. I think you'll really like Bloomsbury, the Celtic Hotel, and Friend at Hand pub, if that is where you decide to stay.\n\nFor connection from Southampton cruise terminal to London, I have never done this trip myself, but I would take a train over a coach. I can't say anything good or bad about National Express, I just prefer the comfort of a train over a bus. From the Southampton cruise terminal there is a bus service call Quayconnect which will take you to Southampton Central Station, but with luggage I would probably just take a cab. From Southampton Central there is regular train service to London Waterloo. From there its either the Northern / Piccadilly tube to Russell Square (just a block from the Celtic Hotel) or cab direct to your hotel.\n\nPosted by darrenblois\n\nMoncton NB\n\n1086 posts\n\nJust a note about Premier Inns. They are very popular among American tourists because they are an American-style, cookie-cutter, chain hotel. If you need the comforts of home, they are fine, but if you need that much American comfort, one wonders why one would leave the country at all. I much prefer English style hotels, inns or B&B's that are in older buildings in quaint locations, like the Celtic or many others you'll find in Bloomsbury (Morgan, Ridgemount, Arran House, Jesmond ...)\n\nPosted by Nigel\n\nNorthamptonshire, England\n\n33347 posts\n\nPremier Inns, owned by Whitbread which used to be one of the biggest brewers and pub chains, is about as British as British gets.\n\nSure the rooms look similar, they found a formula which allows very comfortable rooms and beds with a minimum of services at very keen prices, with dynamic pricing for busy times or late reservations. Many of the buildings are considerably different to American hotels, and the breakfast is most definitely completely different.\n\nI don't see the help in calling it American.\n\nIbis, by Accor, has floors of identical rooms, for similar reasons - but again it is not American or like Americans. It is completely 100% French.\n\nPosted by acraven\n\nWashington DC\n\n27538 posts\n\nI use Premier Inns a lot during air conditioning season; I've been lucky to have a roommate for some of my recent trips to the UK, so I could split the cost of a twin room. When you need a/c, that takes a lot of the inexpensive places with local character out of contention. When I'm on my own in the UK, I try to establish an itinerary that avoids periods when I'd feel a need to book an air-conditioned room; on those occasions I'm happy to choose other, cheaper options. But I do put some value on not having to drag my suitcase up to the third or fourth floor of a tiny hotel with no elevator/lift. I've done it, but that doesn't mean I like it. I'm 71 and only 5'2\"; stairs are a challenge with a suitcase.\n\nI really care very little for the appearance of my room; I want the basics to work: a/c or heat, hot water/plumbing, Wi-Fi. Ikea or chintz--I'm not interested in paying extra one way or the other.\n\nI know folks who have back or hip problems that make quality of bed important. Bed quality is somewhat more predictable at a chain like Premier Inn. In non-chain lodgings I've slept without a problem on a few well-used beds that would have been major issues for some people.\n\nWi-Fi has also been more reliable for me at chain hotels in the Premier Inn price range. I once (I think at an Ibis) had a room with no connectivity. I complained at the desk; they didn't believe me initially, but they sent someone up and--finding I was correct--just moved me to a different room. That wouldn't necessarily have been possible at a smaller hotel; there might not have been another room available of the appropriate size and category (small and cheap).\n\nIt's a mistake to assume that folks who go with Premier Inn and the like are necessarily looking to be reminded of home.\n\nPosted by ramblin' on\n\nRoyaume-Uni nul points, pas plus\n\n2573 posts\n\nThis gives a good basic overview of London hotel areas\n\nhttps://www.londontoolkit.com/mnu/london-hotels.html#areas\n\nLondon is huge, the choice is vast. The only limiting factor is budget.\n\nPosted by phred\n\nLos Angeles\n\n4662 posts\n\nanother option, in the latest Consumer Reports they mention getting hotels through Costco.\n\nI did a dummy search yesterday for London and all the options were for Holiday Inns, but boy there were a lot of them.\n\nI would offer the same general advice I'd give for Paris, most tourist sites seem to be near the river so aim around there perhaps near a bigger train station.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nI never heard of PI or Ibis until I began to search London and or Europe (for Ibis). I do not believe that we have PI or Ibis in the states.\n\nMy needs are simple and I am easily satisfied. I do have back, legs, and foot problems but it does not usually affect my sleeping. I do not need a special kind of bed because of it.\n\nHowever, I am a severe insomnia and need a working TV in the room to sleep. If there is an outage, I will wake up and not be able to go back to sleep until it is working again.\n\nI do not spend a lot of time in my hotel room when I am traveling.\n\nPhred, as for Costco: You have to be a member to use Costco Travel. I have heard you can get some good deals but I have also read that there are problems when you book a. cruise through Costco Cruises.\n\nI am working on my 8th cruise and for some reason, I have gotten into a mindset where I need to take a cruise once a year. I could fly to Rome for a week and another time of year fly to London for a week rather than take a yearly cruise And I could really explore these cities but for many many years, I was unable to travel and I am trying to make up for lost time. It is sort of a good deal. You get your transportation, your hotel, lots of food, organized excursions with others, company, activities.\n\nBut because I live in Austin, Texas, I always have to get to a port by plane or bus or train. I have done most from U S ports but am trying to branch out a bit.\n\nacraven, I am 77 and it is not easy at my age. I can still walk up and down some stairs but no longer with luggage.\n\nPosted by phoffen2001\n\n225 posts\n\nQuestion: What airport are you departing from to go home? This determines your method of getting to the airport. There is nothing worse than hauling crap through train stations and tube stations on your way back to the airport. Stay near Piccadilly Line if you go through Heathrow - the cheapest easy way to the airport. Then you just make your way to the tube, and off you go to the airport. Don't know about Gatwick, but it is not served by a tube line.\n\nAlso, if you arrive on a weekend, there is a chance there will be \"Replacement Bus Service\" and no tube train. This is a major league pain in the neck.\n\nPosted by phoffen2001\n\n225 posts\n\nBTW, Earls Court tube station has a huge elevator (\"lift\" to them) to get to the Piccadilly Line from street level. If you decide to adventurously take the stairs down, you will be regretting it in about 10 steps.\n\nPosted by rogerbrown\n\nStratford upon Avon\n\n470 posts\n\nRe Ibis in USA\n\nThey are part of Accor which has hotels in US under various brand names\n\nPosted by Nigel\n\nNorthamptonshire, England\n\n33347 posts\n\nDon't know about Gatwick, but it is not served by a tube line.\n\nNo, it is way too far. It is served by main line trains, the line to Brighton from London Victoria and several Thameslink stations including London Bridge, Blackfriars and St Pancras among others. Takes about 30 minutes from Victoria at speeds up to 90 mph. Much faster than the Piccadilly Line which is 45 minutes from Earls Court, an hour from central London.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nHi phoffen2001\n\nAlmost certainly I will be flying out of Heathrow as we now have non stop service between London and Austin. provided by BA.\n\nWhen I flew round trip to and from Copenhagen, I had to transfer at Heathrow. I was able to use my AA rewards but they put me on BA.\n\nThis was my only experience with Heathrow and it was pretty overwhelmingly but maybe I will do better next time and I will not be changing planes.\n\nI may decide to splurge and take a shuttle to the airport. Some hotels offer shuttle service for an additional price.\n\nPosted by Rocket 🚀🧳\n\nSan Francisco area\n\n1876 posts\n\nStarting in November the Elizabeth line is due to offer service to and from Heathrow and central London. No transfers required. Currently you have to change trains at Paddington station. I have not used one of the new stations but they are supposed to be step free. Presumably using escalators and or elevators to connect street level and train platforms. £5.50 if paid by oyster or contactless. Might be easier to manage with with luggage than many tube stations.\n\nPosted by acraven\n\nWashington DC\n\n27538 posts\n\nTransportation arranged by a hotel is going to be, in effect, a taxi or limousine. It will cost a great deal of money. I always just use the Tube because my time on arrival day is useless due to a combination of jetlag and sleep deprivation So what if it takes me an extra 30 or 45 minutes to get into town? Those with real plans for arrival day may prefer the Heathrow Express.\n\nPosted by Claudia\n\nLand of La\n\n8956 posts\n\nThought you might like this link:\n\nhttps://secretldn.com/car-boot-sales-in-london/\n\nBoot sales are fun experiences.\n\nA couple of excellent websites to research: The Londonist and London x London.\n\nPosted by Nigel\n\nNorthamptonshire, England\n\n33347 posts\n\nI'm afraid that the Elizabeth Line is of no use for Earls Court - it generally follows the shape of the northern half of the Circle line and the Central line, in completely new tunnels, but nowhere near the southern half of the Circle line.

Sometimes travelers must treat themselves to that-which-makes-things-simpler. Btw, the Sunday 'Brick Lane' street market in the east End will have so many quality food stalls to choose from that you'll be spoiled for choice.

The end.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nI continue my research and I found a nice PI around Victoria Station. I may stick with Victoria Station for hotels. Very convenient and sometimes within my budget.\n\nI like how the PI's look. Very attractive buildings.\n\nAre there human employees and staff in these stations who can help?\n\nClaudia and others. I can not do tie shoes like sneakers or boots. I have a very promnent bunion on my right but on my left, I have Morton's Neuroma. I can do loafers or moccasins, anything that easily slips on or off.\n\nPosted by Rebecca\n\nNashville, TN, USA\n\n3828 posts\n\n\"Still trying to learn about. neighborhoods and then the tube. RS says something about the bus system being very complex.\"\n\nDo you have a paper map of London that you can unfold on a dining room table and study for a while?\n\nThis will help you become familiar with the neighborhoods and learn where things are in London.\n\nThe bus system is not really all that complicated. You can look at a bus map and figure out how to get from point A to point B. For example, if you have just finished seeing the Tower of London and you'd like to go to St. Paul's Cathedral or Trafalgar Square museums next, you can hop on the Number 15 bus. There are 3 or 4 steps to get up into the bus, and there are sturdy handrails.\n\nhttps://content.tfl.gov.uk/bus-route-maps/key-bus-routes-in-central-london.pdf\n\nTap in with your Oyster card on the pad as you enter the bus, if that's your method of payment.\n\nYou can pick up small paper maps of the tube routes and bus systems at any tube station.\n\nRick Steves' London pocket guidebook has a tube map, bus routes map and a London map.\n\nPlus lots of information about places to eat, museum opening and closing times, neighborhoods, and much more.\n\nThis would be a wise purchase for you; very reasonable price:\n\nhttps://store.ricksteves.com/shop/p/pocket-london\n\nPosted by Pam\n\nCoeur d’Alene, Idaho, USA\n\n14360 posts\n\n\"If I sail Lisbon to Southampton, I might do a splurge and take a shuttle bus from the port to my hotel. It will cost me over $100 but it might be worth it.\"\n\nYou'd mentioned upthread that you had leg, back and foot problems. To me, paying for a shuttle or other private transport seems like a good use of funds if you have some problems. I'd want to save myself for tromping around town rather than \"wasting\" energy on a transit.\n\nPosted by Wray\n\nCape Ann, Massachusetts\n\n3277 posts\n\nSolo or with husband I stayed at the friendly Cherry Court Hotel in Victoria. Bus, train, and tube near by. I was not afraid walking back to this small hotel after dark, and so close to transport, but is on a quiet street. Rooms very small but mattresses are great and the family of Patels are lovely. It is particularly nice staying there when traveling solo. Note, I have not been there for a few years, but it looks the same and still family run. Also we would walk to many sites from there also…but you do not have to do so. Also the prices are great.\n\nPosted by acraven\n\nWashington DC\n\n27538 posts\n\nI don't think the Cherry Court Hotel has an elevator, which is an issue for some. That's a pretty common situation in small London hotels, since many were originally what we in the US would call townhouses (rowhouses). It's also important to check on the availability of air conditioning if you're traveling during a season when it might be necessary. I've rolled the dice twice in September and won; it's not a risk I'd take in June-August unless the financial savings were really large--which they conceivably might be for a solo traveler.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nHi Rebecca,\n\nI am trying to decide if I am going to cruise from Lisbon to Rome or Lisbon to London. That is why I have not yet purchased any RS books.\n\nOnce I make up my mind, I do plan to make some purchases.\n\nPosted by Rebecca\n\nNashville, TN, USA\n\n3828 posts\n\nHello bostonphil7,\n\nAh! That's more clear, now! That certainly makes sense.\n\nI was unsure what your plan was.\n\nBoth cruises sound wonderful!\n\nBest wishes to you,\n\nRebecca\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nHi Rebecca,\n\nI have discovered Visit London which has so much information that I do not even know where to begin.\n\nVisit London has many maps even including one on where toilets are in the tube.\n\nCheck out Visit London just to see what is offered.\n\nPosted by l.p.enersen\n\nGlostrup, Denmark\n\n1352 posts\n\nFor general information you don't need the latest edition of the guide books. Find guide books in your local library and when you have decided which city to go to, buy the latest edition for that city.\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nThere is also a lot on line as well as youtube videos. I highly recommend Visit London. Worth checking out to see all that is offered.\n\nI went to my local library for guidebooks on London. We have a relative new magnificent library but there were only about 7 guidebooks on London and they all look donated.\n\nBut I looked through some of them.\n\nPosted by Lucylocket\n\nNew York\n\n7 posts\n\nRichmond upon Thames is a leafy suburb where you can get the tube into London in 40mins. Wimbledon Village is lovely and 15 mins by train. More central the nicest area would be South Kensington. Enjoy!\n\nPosted by Rebecca\n\nNashville, TN, USA\n\n3828 posts\n\nYes, Visit London has lots of great information.\n\nI'm hoping you have gotten lots of great information on this thread and your more recent threads you have going on.\n\nHappy Travels to you and I hope everything works out!\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nRebecca,\n\nI just watched a wonderful YouTube video walking from Victoria Coach to Victoria Train station. I got a tour of Victoria Coash and Victoria Train both.\n\nIt made everything look so human and so real. It was no longer threatening .\n\nI am getting a lot of good and helpful information from persons responding to my posts.\n\nPosted by Rebecca\n\nNashville, TN, USA\n\n3828 posts\n\nExcellent! I'm glad you found that video. It helps to be able to see what the area will look like as you walk through it.\n\nPosted by bluumz\n\nMichigan, USA\n\n12 posts\n\nPhil, I'm watching your thread with interest... we have many similar wants/needs for our trips. I'll be going to London in July.\n\nHappy travels!\n\nPosted by Jane\n\nSapulpa, OK, USA\n\n6407 posts\n\nI'm glad I found this thread; I've been looking for a hotel in London, and darrenblois's recommendations sound perfect. I'll check out another few as well, but I'm delighted with what I've seen.\n\nThank you!\n\nPosted by bostonphil7 OP\n\nAustin, TX\n\n2035 posts\n\nI am so glad that my threads and or posts are helping others. I know so much more since posting this first one.\n\nLearning how to visit London for the first time is very complicated and I am so glad for Rick Steves and this wonderful forum.\n\nI am going to buy Rick Steves London soon but I wonder if I should wait for Rick Steves 2023 whenever that will get published.\n\nHotels are shockingly expensive and you do not always get the amenities that you think you should (like breakfast or a coffee machine in the room) for your money. Read reviews very carefully because you might think that you got a good deal only to find out that the hotel has no lift and you are having to walk up 3 or more steep flights of stairs.\n\nI am learning.\n\nPosted by Jane\n\nSapulpa, OK, USA\n\n6407 posts\n\nBostonphil7, the edition that's on the website now is current. You should probably go ahead and get on. I suspect it's unlikely there'll be another edition before you're ready to travel. And yes, every guidebook is outdated as soon as it hits the shelves.\n\nPosted by Pam\n\nCoeur d’Alene, Idaho, USA\n\n14360 posts\n\nI agree with Jane, go ahead and get the London book. If you go to the guidebook link on the website you'll see that it was published in Sept 2022 so there would not be a newer edition before you travel in Sept 2023.\n\nhttps://store.ricksteves.com/shop/p/london-guidebook\n\nYou should always check the individual websites for museums/churches/other sites that you want to visit to see the latest information on pricing, opening times, timed entry, anything related to Covid, etc. And if you are going to museums/churches be sure to check to see if they have downloadable audio guides. For instance, Westminster Abbey has a wonderful audio guide and it's much easier to listen on your phone than to carry around a heavy museum audio guide. You would want to download these before you leave home and be sure you had your earbuds in your pocket/purse.\n\nNo guidebook can give you the latest information on that and as Jane indicates there will be parts that are obsolete as soon as they are published."
