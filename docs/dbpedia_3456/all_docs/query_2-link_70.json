And - lets face it - once you're across the Thames, Bank station is within easy walking distance of City destinations, so an additional station on the W&C at Blackfriars wouldn't offer very much.\n\nPost by Chris M on\n\nI think the reason that the W&C has never been extended is that it's not practical to extend it at either end, and so you might as well abandon what's there and start again. This however would cost a lot and would need a hell of a lot of benefits to justify duplicating/replacing an existing line.\n\nPost by younglulnerd on\n\nI think the reason that the W&C has never been extended is that it's not practical to extend it at either end, and so you might as well abandon what's there and start again.

Kidding, but really, thats like buliding a link from Holborn to Aldwych and not using the old picc lines. You abandon the bank plats and build new ones alongside/under the existing northern tracks (or whatever the lowest ones are if needed. Can use the current plats for stabling trains. Extend platform lengths and depot lengths to normal 92ts standards, and from bank go north to GN&C and northern heights. Any obstructions ie. primary schools on trackpath, tunnel under them.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThe tracks coming in are at completely the wrong angle to do anything with regards to the Northern Line.\n\nExtending the W&C is totally unfeasible from my point of view. The elements of the station at Bank would prohibit this; namely the travelator.\n\nAt Waterloo, the depot is there.\n\nPost by mrjrt on\n\n@cj said:\n\nThe tracks coming in are at completely the wrong angle to do anything with regards to the Northern Line.\n\nExtending the W&C is totally unfeasible from my point of view. The elements of the station at Bank would prohibit this; namely the travelator.\n\nAt Waterloo, the depot is there.\n\nIt was my understanding that the depot at Waterloo points south-south east, so extension south is trivial, and solves the platform length issue nicely by building new platforms on a branch from the depot under York Road. Though, I suspect, you could probably do away with the depot entirely and have the platforms further north, where the line currently begins to curve. You#re going to need a new depot for longer trains, so there's no point retaining this mini-depot.\n\nPost by Ben on\n\nNothing is that unfeasible. Extensions both ends have been proposed and promoted by various learned groups over the years. To just dismiss it as untenable point blank only serves to further the assumption that nothing can be done; its self-perpetuating.\n\nThe truth is the line just isn't favoured. ATM it has very limited capacity, and a very clear role for which its capacity matches more or less. It certainly has potential, but theres just no want or need to tap it at the moment. One day though perhaps.\n\nPost by roythebus on\n\nThe W&C just couldn't cope with any more passengers. the depot can't be extended without demolishing a lot of The Cut; you can't move Waterloo platforms round the corner, the walls support the main station and would be on a very sharp curve and a steep gradient...\n\nI know, I worked on the line long enough!\n\nEdited to add the curved bits towards the Bank end is where Blackfriars station is; the curves are there to take the line round the supports for Blackfriars bridge.\n\nPost by dazzmcguinness on\n\nDo we really want to be doing this? The Waterloo and City line is fit for purpose and, as has been mentioned, can't cope with more passengers. We can barely fit on it at the best of times!\n\nIs it really too much of an effort to walk from Bank to Blackfriars? I did Farringdon to Blackfriars in fifteen minutes once (I didn't know which bus to catch, but knew if I headed due south I'd find it), and it was great to see the city in all its glory.\n\ndarrenmcguinness.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/mcguinness-on-take-a-walk-on-the-wild-side/\n\nI fear if we get bogged down with 'going underground', as The Jam sang, we miss the experience of the here and now. Plus a little exercise never goes amiss!\n\n'McGuinness"
