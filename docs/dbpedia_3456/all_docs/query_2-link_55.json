        "text": "Region & Route:\n\n| Southern\n\nFoundations for the first new rail station to be built on the South Bank in over 120 years are being laid as part of Network Rail’s landmark redevelopment of Blackfriars station.\n\nWork on the new Blackfriars south station is integral to the £5.5bn congestion-busting Thameslink Programme and marks a major milestone in the life of a unique project that will create the first station to span the River Thames, and deliver more and better journey options to and through the capital for hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nLocated at the base of Blackfriars railway bridge, the south station will provide direct access to some of the area’s key local attractions east and west along the Thames Path, which include the Tate Modern, Shakespeare’s Globe and The London Eye.\n\nFeaturing a new glazed concourse area with retail space and ticket facilities, entry to the new platforms that span the river, and improved use of the Thames Path through widening the pavement at this location, Blackfriars south station has been designed to meet the needs of all users.\n\nJim Crawford, Network Rail’s Thameslink major programme director, said: “Work on the south station marks an important milestone in the redevelopment of Blackfriars."
