        "text": "LONDON BRIDGE WALK 2:\n\nBLACKFRIARS to LONDON BRIDGE\n\n3/4 hour\n\nRouting note: This walk connects at Blackfriars with Thameslink network walk 5 and to District Line walks 11 and (more conveniently) 10. The walk connects at London Bridge with walks 1, 3 and 4 of the London Bridge networks. It also connects there to Jubilee line walk 6 and to Northern Line walk 11.\n\nThe train line was buillt in 1886. It enabled the train company to connect its Brighton main line with its very popular cross-London line. If you take a train on this section, you will notice that trains have to take a steep incline and a tight curve, showing that it was squeezed awkwardly into existing networks. Because of congestion at London Bridge, the number of trains using the line is quite limited.\n\nBLACKFRIARS\n\nThe station is actually a combination of two separate stations although they belonged to the same train company. The two stations originally used separate bridges over the Thames. One bridge carried the cross-London railway between Elephant & Castle and Farringdon. This line opened in 1864, but there was no station here before 1886. The line is now served by Thameslink and uses through platforms located on the west part of the station. The original bridge used for this line has been demolished in 1985.\n\nThe second bridge was opened in 1886 and was used for a new terminus alongside the existing Cross-Thames tracks. It was opened as St Paul’s station and was renamed Blackfriars in 1937.\n\nThe original terminal building was a typical large steel construction with a representative front to the road, but the building dilapidated and was replaced in 1977 by a nondescript office complex. The office building hid the old station front which was preserved in part inside but was difficult to see as it was badly lit. The office building has been destroyed recently in turn and a new office building is being built. I have seen no renditions of the planned new building\n\nThe train company used the opportunity to rebuild the platforms and extend them all over the Thames, providing a new, very convenient station access on the South bank. The main official access and the interchange with the Tube remain on the North bank. I think the rebuilt Blackfriars station may well be the only train station in Europe having an access on both sides of a large tidal river.\n\nExit the station on the north bank of the Thames, walking through the pedestrian subway and following signs for Blackfriars Pier. The layout is confusing and the subway is spectacularly long and a bit strange, but is well signposted.\n\nAt the exit, turn onto the riverside path marked Thames Path East.\n\nFollow the Thames Path as signposted. You cross underneath the Blackfriars railway bridge and the Millenium pedestrian bridge.\n\nJust before the Millenium bridge, the building complex on the waterfront houses the City of London School since 1987. This is a school opened by the City of London in 1834 on the basis of a medieval bequest after a dozen of years of complicated discussions in Guildhall and Parliament about what the bequest actually required. The school was quite revolutionary for the time: it accepted Jews and Non-conformist Protestants (but apparently no Catholics), it taught science and it did not offer boarding. The school is prestigious, moderately expensive and extremely competitive to enter.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Thames Path (well signposted) detours around an apartment building away from the riverside because of a former wharf. The area was indeed all wharves and commercial premises until the 1950s. In addition, a major dual carriageway now separates the riverfront from the historical areas on the hill. On the opposite side of the busy road, you can see an isolated church tower without church.\n\nThis is the only rest of St Mary Somerset, a church that was rebuilt in 1694 after being destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. The church was demolished in 1871 as the congregation had become too small to justify a separate parish. The City of London built a small garden around the church tower and used the tower in a very dignified manner as a restroom for ladies.\n\nThe building is rather restrained compared to others built on plans by Sir Christopher Wren because it was a poor parish. Actually, it was one of the only two parishes that had to appeal to the Coal Tax proceeds to buy the furnishings. The Coal Tax was an ancient duty collected by the City of London on coal delivered in the harbour.\n\nThe most interesting remnant of the harbour past is the inlet called Queen’s Quay. The name comes from the fact that Henry I granted his daughter Matilda the duties from this wharf. It was actually in use until the 20th century for the fur trade as this high-value item was risky to store in isolated harbour areas. It is the only wharf that still exists in the City of London (although disused) and is therefore listed. There is not much to see and the more attractive view is towards the South bank of the river dominated by Tate Modern.\n\nThe last building before Southwark Bridge on the North side of the river is Vintners Hall, a very imposing building with lots of green and white marble and neo-classical pediments and columns. The Vintners’ Company was an extremely powerful guild in the Middle Ages as it received the import monopoly on claret (Bordeaux wine) in 1364. Members also had until 1986 the valuable privilege of selling wine without alcohol license in some parts of England. The company is also involved in a deliciously English royal ceremony, the Swan Upping.\n\nSwans were very sought after as meat in the Middle Ages and swans found on open rivers in the London area were reserved for the King. Since the 15th century, the Vintners’ Company is allowed to share with the King and therefore sends an officer on a boat to ring swans together with the Keeper of the King’s/Queen’s Swans. Actually, this royal office was abolished in 1993 after 600 years and replaced by two officers, the Warden of the Swans and the Marker of the Swans. We should all be very distraught by the disappearance of such a venerable office. Funnily enough, the Marker does not mark swans as only swans caught by the Vintners’ officer (and by his colleague from the Company of Dyers) are marked.\n\nThe building on the riverside is a modern extension from the 1990s as the original building from 1910 faces Thames Street and is not on the present route. The Vintners’ Hall is opened to the public yearly on Open Monument Day and always attracts huge crowds waiting for hours – there are very few Halls that open at all. I have been in a few others and I don’t think they are worth waiting hours although they are quite nice.\n\nClimb up the stairs at Southwark Bridge and cross the river.\n\nSouthwark bridge is the most ornate bridge in central London and the one with the nicest colours (Tower Bridge is possibly more ornate but is also more garish). It was first opened in 1819 as a toll-bridge, but bought by the City of London (actually by a special trust who owns and manages the bridges giving access to the City) and rebuilt in 1921. It gave direct access to Guildhall from the South Bank and was less congested than London Bridge.\n\nIn 1994, the City of London decided to close some roads leading into the City in order to lower the risk of terrorist attacks like those of 1992 and 1993. As a result, the bridge continues to have good access on the South bank, but its only access on the North bank is to the riverside road with very awkward connections further North. It is therefore very little used and is the recommended route for cyclists who need to cross the Thames.\n\nThe view upstream is not very interesting as you already saw it while walking along the riverside. It shows again Tate Modern and the Globe Theatre. The view downstream is peculiar with a good view of the Refuse Handling Station of the City of London. Grey rubbish containers are put on barges and those are towed downstream very regularly to a Greater London site near Rainham. The Thames Path runs between the container yard and the barges and passers-by occasionally have the thrill of having to wait at a barrier while a threateningly large container hovers over the path (just in case, there is a stout wire mesh cage protecting the path). It is difficult to plan for this as it is dependant i.a. on the tide.\n\nL Park Street\n\nThe street turns right before reaching the arches of a train viaduct. These arches are being used since 1999 by a tourist attraction, Vinopolis. I guess it is a nice place for events and parties, while I think you don’t need to spend so much money to try a few wines. I prefer either to buy a few bottles for the price of one entry ticket, or to gather experiences on a trip to a wine producing area. As long as you don’t behave all the time like a client at my uncle’s French vineyard who tried all wines for hours, made all sorts of enthusiastic comments and then bought nothing.\n\nPark Street then passes a pleasant, quiet and unexpected square with trees. It later turns L again after passing a minor street, Redcross Way. There was a Bramah Musem of Tea and Coffee nearby, but it was closed a few years ago and no agreement was found with the borough about where to put it, what to do with it and how to finance it.\n\nPark Street crosses underneath railway tracks (actually a disused line from Cannon Street to Waterloo East). In front of you at the end of the street, you can enter Borough Market, an upmarket selection of fine foods and stalls where you can buy all sorts of nice snacks and exotic foods. It tends to be extremely crowded on Saturdays for brunch and this is the place to meet yuppie bankers and their career-minded DINKY (Double Income No Kids) wives. To meet similar but eligible bankers, you need to go on Friday evenings and to other bars and clubs. I noticed that the prices in Borough Market include a sizeable premium for the location.\n\nThe original use of Borough Market is as a wholesale market for foodstuffs catering in particular to smaller shops and restaurants. This activity takes place in the early morning on weekdays and is finished by 8 a.m. You can have a look at the cast iron and glass halls from 1851. There is also an imposing Art Déco entrance on Southwark Street added in 1932.\n\nYou might get the feeling that the market squeezes awkwardly around the pillars of the railway viaduct. Actually, it is the other way around: the market is owned by a trust set up by law in 1756 who is not allowed to sell the ground. Rather than try to change the law, the train companies negociated the right to cross the market on pillars with due compensation for any loss of useful space. Additional railway work is expected to take place again in the near future; the market will remain in place, but most of the older buildings will be replaced.\n\nR Stoney Street\n\nL Southwark Street merging into Borough High Street\n\nR St. Thomas Street\n\nOn the North side of the street, a stone tower looks like it belongs to a church, but is marked as the entrance to the Old Operating Theatre Museum. There was actually a church here (St. Thomas), used as a hospital chapel in the 18th century. The building was used later as commercial offices and has been damaged during the construction of the Jubilee Line.\n\nThe chapel tower had a “garret”, a small flat in the attic, used primarily as storage space for the hospital. Part of it remains to this day an attic under the roof with thick wooden beams and part was converted in 1822 into an operating theatre. It was closed in 1862 and forgotten until 1957. Operations took usually place in private homes at the time as it lessened the risk of catching additional illnesses while hospitals would not be much cleaner than private homes anyway. But people who could not afford to have the surgeon visit at home could go to a hospital where operations were for free. In counterpart, they had to accept that the surgeons’ colleagues, students and visitors would watch the ordeal. This particular theatre is supposed to be one of the very few in existence from this period anywhere in Europe.\n\nThe museum can be visited daily for a reasonable entry fee (in addition, it is free once a year on Open Monument Day). Just be aware that the climb to the garret is seriously inconvenient if you are short of breath. I found the visit very enjoyable, spending more than an hour looking at the operating theatre and at the collection of herbs. It smells interesting, sometimes even lovely, and the explanations are eye-opening. If you are interested, there is also a small collection of medical devices, but you can see a better selection at the Science Museum.\n\nFurther down St. Thomas Street, you will reach the impressive iron gate of Guy’s Hospital, founded in 1721 by a speculator who had found gullible buyers for his South Sea shares at ridiculous prices before the company went bankrupt (possibly inside trading) and who also published unlicensed Bibles. It was later merged with St. Thomas’ Hospital, one of the oldest charitable institutions in Britain as it dates back to the 12th century. The hospital is well-known for its scientific achievements and is now linked with King’s College.\n\nThe large courtyard you see from St. Thomas Street is the part built with Mr Guy’s bequest in Georgian times and now houses administration. The style is typically Georgian with plain brick walls, rectangular sash windows, romanesque arches as the only decoration at ground level, and the ubiquitous temple-like columns and triangular pediment over the main entrance.\n\nClimb steps to a footbridge leading to the courtyard for\n\nLONDON BRIDGE\n\nThe first station on this location was built in 1836 for the London and Greenwich Railway. An additional station opened alongside in 1839 for the London and Croydon Railway. The station soon needed to be expanded and a new building opened in 1844. Buildings continued to be replaced at a dizzying speed: 1849, 1854, 1864… A newspaper described the result as “a sprawling confusion”.\n\nThe buildings were partly destroyed by bombs in 1941 and a temporary solution remained in place until full reconstruction in 1978. The new awnings were considered a masterpiece at the time. Because a skyscraper is being built very close to the station, the general environment will change a lot, but I think no change to the concourses is planned. You might be surprised that no hotel was built above the terminus concourse like it was the case at most other termini. One was actually built nearby, but made losses because travellers did not want to stay on the industrial South bank of the Thames. The hotel was converted into railway offices in 1892 and demolished after being damaged by bombs in 1940.\n\nThere are actually two stations alongside each other. One has through platforms (numbers 1 to 6) with standard awnings and no concourse. The platforms are accessed by a subway. There was a terminus here from 1839 until 1864, when the extension towards Charing Cross was built. Platforms 1 to 3 are actually reserved for through trains from Cannon Street (my walk 3), platforms 4 to 6 for trains from Charing Cross (my walk 1) or Blackfriars (my walk 2). Platform 6 is actually supposed to be the busiest platform in Europe. To get a feeling for what it means, go on a summer Sunday in hot weather and have a look at the people trying to board the Brighton train. I was careless enough to try once with a bicycle but had to give up.\n\nThe second station is London Bridge terminus, which has a traditional large concourse and is much quieter outside of rush hours. As mentioned, it has a huge awning from 1978 covering not only the concourse but also the whole bus terminus. You will realise that it is actually a lightweight structure as it is borne by just a few thin steel pillars. The awnings over the platforms are older and more traditional. All in all, the building is neither beautiful nor imposing. You somehow get the feeling that it was never meant to be a grand terminus for long-distance travellers, as opposed to Cannon Street and Charing Cross, but this is unfair as it looked reasonably dignified until the 1940 destruction.\n\nTrains run eastwards from London Bridge in four different directions, but share initially a common viaduct. The first line to branch off is the one to South Bermondsey and towards Streatham; this one can only be served from the terminus, not from the through platforms.\n\nThe second line runs to New Cross Gate and is the main line towards Croydon and Brighton; it is the only one that is served both from the through platforms and from the terminus and is also one of the very few lines in London where you have the choice between different companies with fares being occasionally different as well.\n\nThe third line (to New Cross and Lewisham) and the fourth line (to Deptford and Greenwich) are only being served from the through platforms."
