        "text": "The relatively new, huge street level concourse, which is located under the railway tracks, between St Thomas Street and Tooley Street, has direct access to all of the platforms/tracks above by escalators and lifts/elevators.\n\nThough only one lift connects the lower level concourse to platforms 10-15, it's opposite the escalators which go up to platforms 12-13.\n\nWhat can be a tad unexpected is that the ticket gate lines surround this concourse, so there arenât separate ticket gates for each platform .\n\nAnd whatâs particularly unusual for a British station is that some of the shops at the station are on the inside of the ticket gates.\n\nAnother fairly bizarre feature, it's not a typical station, is that this main concourse doesnât have a primary departure board, which lists both all departures and all of the stations that each train will be calling at.\n\nInstead there are three separate groups of departure screens which can be found on the lower level concourse:\n\n(1) The 'A to Z' screens which list most, but not all, of the destinations served by trains in alphabetical order.\n\nThe main A to Z screen which shows the popular destinations regardless of train operator, is on the wall of the concourse area beyond the ticket barriers, it is above the convenience store located between the escalators leading up to platforms 4-5 and 6-7.\n\n(2)The 'next fastest train to' screens, which include only the the most popular destinations.\n\n(3) Opposite the escalators up to platforms 10 to 15 is a conventional departure board, but it only includes the details of the trains which leave from these platforms.\n\nThere are also information desks and other station staff who can point you in the right direction.\n\nThere is also an upper level concourse, which is adjacent to The Shard skyscraper.\n\nIf you take a taxi to London Bridge it may drop you by this upper level concourse; and the bus routes which terminate at the station\n\n43\n\n141\n\n149\n\n388\n\n521\n\nalso arrive here.\n\nOne of the taxi ranks which serve the station is also located here, it's to the left of the bus stands.\n\nThis upper concourse is on the same level as the part of the station used by the Southern trains which arrive at depart from platforms (tracks) 10-15, so the main departure board on this concourse only shows details of the Southern trains.\n\nIf you enter the station at its upper level, beside the entrance to The Shard skyscraper, and find that your train is departing from platforms (tracks) 1 - 9, you will need to use the escalator or elevator, which are both to the left of platform 10, and descend to the lower level concourse.\n\nPlatforms (tracks) 1 - 9 can only be accessed from the lower level concourse.\n\nIn contrast all of the platforms (tracks) can be accessed from the lower level concourse, but the upper level concourse has easier access from and to:\n\nthe bus stops in front of the station (used by routes/lines 43, 141, 149, 388 and 521)\n\nthe entrance to The Shard offices and the News UK building\n\nthe quickest walking route to Borough Market is to leave through the front of the station and head down the street you'll see on the left, keeping the entrance to the News UK building on your right.\n\nIf you find yourself on the main, lower-level concourse you can use those escalators, which are towards the St Thomas Street side of the station, to transfer to the upper level; the signs above the foot of the escalator read 'Way Out - Station Approach' and this escalator is in front of the passage which leads to the Underground station.\n\nIt is the only escalator which leads up from the lower level, which is on the other side of the ticket gates.\n\nThough when on the main lower level concourse, the elevator link to the upper concourse is a tad tricky to locate, you'll find it to the left of the entrance to the tunneled passage way, which leads to the Underground.\n\nFrom the main (lower level) concourse, once you have passed through the ticket barriers, all of the platforms can be accessed by escalators, elevators and stairs.\n\nPlatforms 1 - 9 are immediately above this concourse and they arranged in pairs: 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8-9. with platform 1 as a separate entity.\n\nEach of the pairs, plus platform 1, can be accessed by a lift (elevator), plus two sets of escalators and stairs.\n\nOthers sets of stairs and escalators lead up from the lower level concourse to platforms 10, 11-12. 13-14, as well as platform 15.\n\nAnother lift provides an alternative link from the lower concourse to platforms 10-15; this elevator to the upper level is opposite the escalators which leads to platforms 13-14.\n\nFrom the upper concourse all of the platforms in the station can be also accessed - platforms 10-15 are right beside it, while an escalator and and lift over on the left side of the upper concourse, lead down to the lower level, so provide the access to platforms 1-9.\n\nIf you're not used to taking a train from London Bridge station something to be aware of is that there are different types of information screen at the station; it doesn't have one main departure board.\n\nOn the lower concourse the easiest information to make sense of is by using the A to Z departure indicators.\n\nThey list most of the the destinations served by all of the trains from the station in alphabetical order and show the departure time of the next train and which platform (track) it will be leaving from.\n\nThe main A to Z screen is on the wall of the concourse area beyond the ticket barriers, it is above the convenience store located between the escalators leading up to platforms 4-5 and 6-7.\n\nThe two more conventional departure boards which show each departure individually, along with all of the stations each of them serves; the one on the upper concourse and the one on the lower concourse (opposite the access to platforms 10 - 15), only list the Southern departures.\n\nHowever, Thameslink trains serve many of the same destinations as these Southern trains and those trains aren't listed on those departure boards, hence using the A to Z departure screens being a good option.\n\nThe most numerous departure screens on the lower level concourse are the 'next fastest train to' departure screens, which show the times and platform numbers of trains heading to particularly popular locations.\n\nThough there's no getting away from the fact that the departure screens can be confusing if you're not used to the station.\n\nAlso if you take the Underground to London Bridge there are departure screens by the exit from its ticket hall, but if the info shows that the next train to where you're heading is leaving within 3 minutes, then you won't make it in time.\n\nIf you're confused, there are staffed information desks on both the upper and lower level concourse.\n\nHowever, the overwhelming majority of destinations served from London Bridge are served by departures leaving at least every 30 minutes, so the advice is to take your time.\n\nPlatforms 1; (2); 6 and 7:\n\nThe trains operated by Southeastern heading away from London depart from platforms (tracks) 1 and 6 and 7; plus platform 2 in peak hours.\n\nSoutheastern trains calling at Greenwich usually depart from platform 1.\n\nTrains heading to Canterbury, Dover, Hastings and Tunbridge Wells depart from platforms/tracks 6 or 7; which are accessed by the same escalators and lift.\n\nThough during Monday to Friday peak hours there are additional departures to these destinations from platform 1.\n\nHowever, these trains heading to Canterbury, Dover, Hastings and Tunbridge Wells will have previously departed from Charing Cross and Waterloo (East) stations.\n\nSo check whether boarding the trains at either of those stations will suit you better before you head to London Bridge.\n\nWaterloo (East) station is also connected to Southwark Underground station on the Jubilee Line.\n\nPlatforms 2 and 3:\n\nFor trains to Cannon Street station, on the north bank of The Thames (a 10-15 min walk from London Bridge).\n\nPlatform 4:\n\nFor the Thameslink trains heading south to a swathe of destinations in Surrey and Sussex including Gatwick Airport and Brighton.\n\nThameslink also serves some destinations in north Kent with a service which terminates at Rainham and calls in Greenwich and Rochester.\n\n(So if you are heading to Greenwich, the next train to depart can be a Thameslink train from platform 4 instead of a Southeastern train from platform 1).\n\nThese trains will have previously called at St Pancras, Farringdon, City Thameslink and Blackfriars stations before they depart from London Bridge, so check if any of those alternative stations will be more convenient.\n\nFarringdon station has connections with the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan Lines; and now the Elizabeth line, while Blackfriars has an easy interchange with the Circle and District Lines.\n\nPlatform 5:\n\nThe Thameslink trains heading north to destinations such as Cambridge, Peterborough and St Albans all leave from here.\n\nIf you will be heading to St Pancras station to connect into the EMR or Eurostar trains, or will be taking a train on from King's Cross station, then taking these Thameslink trains can be a good alternative to taking the Northern line of the Underground.\n\nAt both London Bridge and St Pancras stations, the transfer to and from these Thameslink trains is quicker and easier than making the connections with the Underground.\n\nPlatforms 8 and 9:\n\nFor trains to Waterloo (East) and Charing Cross stations in central London (see below)\n\nPlatforms 10 - 15:\n\nThese are used by the trains operated by Southern; destinations served include Crystal Palace, Forest Hill for The Horniman Museum and East Grinstead for The Bluebell Railway.\n\nThese platforms all have two sets of escalators, both of which lead down to the main concourse, so use whichever you come to first.\n\nBetween them there is an elevator, which will also take you down to the lower level concourse.\n\nThis lower level has exits at one end on to Tooley Street; turn left for London Bridge itself and turn right for Tower Bridge and the south bank of the Thames, including the boat pier.\n\nThe taxi rank which serves the lower level concourse is also accessed from the Tooley Street exit, you need to turn right when you step out of the station and walk around the corner on to Bermondsey Street.\n\nThe St Thomas Street exit on the other side of the station has the simplest routes from this level to Borough Market (turn right), and The Shard Experience (also to the right) and Bermondsey High St (turn left).\n\nThis lower concourse also has access to the Underground station, through a fairly lengthy passage way lined with stores.\n\nHaving passed through the ticket barriers, this passage way to the Underground station will be over to the left.\n\nOr you can head up to the exit on the upper level concourse, this is where you will find the bus station and an alternative taxi rank.\n\nThis part of the station has a typical terminus layout, with a concourse at one end of the platforms, so to exit through the upper level concourse you need to go through the ticket barriers which will by the front of the trains.\n\nFrom this part of the station, exiting through the front of the upper concourse is the quickest route to:\n\nSt Thomas Street for the Shard Experience; and Bermondsey Street for the Fashion and Textile Museum and the White Cube gallery, take the escalators down to St Thomas Street which you'll find outside the station and over to left;\n\nBorough Market, walk straight ahead, keeping the News UK building on your right;\n\nthe Underground, the short-cut route from the upper concourse, which isn't signposted, is to use the entrance just across the street from the front of the station;\n\nthe bus stops, routes/lines 43, 141, 149, 388 and 521 use the stands in front of the station; the other buses stop on the main road that you'll see ahead of you.\n\nThere is also a taxi rank to the left of those bus stops.\n\nEach of these platforms also has a set of stairs and escalators down to the lower (main) concourse, with an elevator by the end of platform 10.\n\nHead to the lower concourse in order to use the exits on Tooley Street, which provides the quickest routes to the riverside attractions including Tower Bridge and the boat pier.\n\nLondon Bridge station is located on the south-eastern corner of central London, but when heading towards London, the Southeastern and Thameslink trains continue beyond London Bridge to call at other stations closer to the city centre.\n\nSo taking these trains services can be a better option than taking the Underground, because they connect to different areas of the city than the Jubilee and Northern Lines, which are the two Underground lines, which serveÂ London Bridge.\n\nMany travellers therefore transfer between main line train services instead of taking the Underground, particularly as it takes around 3 - 5 minutes to reach the Underground trains when stepping off a train at London Bridge.\n\nUp to 17 Southeastern trains per hour depart from platforms (tracks) 8 and 9 and link London Bridge to Charing Cross station, which has easy access to numerous attractions including Covent Garden, the National Galleries, Leicester Square, Soho and the areas around Piccadilly.\n\nUp to 12 Thameslink trains per hour leaveÂ from platform 5 and call at Blackfriars*, for the South Bank arts complex and Tate Modern, City Thameslink for St Pauls and Farringdon for the Smithfield area.\n\n(*Blackfriars railway station spans the River Thames, so if youâre heading to destinations on the south bank, board towards the rear of the train)."
