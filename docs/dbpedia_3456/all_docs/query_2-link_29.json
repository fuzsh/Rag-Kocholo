        "text": "Above: Looking north at the station’s east side from the south (Southwark bank) of the Thames. The platform level is where the wall of plate glass panels can be seen.\n\nBlackfriars Railway Station reopened to passengers on Monday 17 January 2011 after the platforms were newly laid out along the length of the old Blackfriars Railway Bridge. Their length was greater than the old station, allowing 12-carriage trains to run on the extended Thameslink services. The original service was from Brighton via Blackfriars Station and Snow Hill Tunnel to Bedford and Luton. With the new station in operation, new services branched out to the south to stations like Wimbledon, Sutton, Orpington, Sevenoaks and Rainham. North of London, as well as serving Bedford and Luton, new routes were added to Peterborough and Cambridge.\n\nAbove: Standing on the south-bound platform and looking north. The station was open for pedestrian access but no trains were running on the day the picture was taken.\n\nHaving plate-glass walls beside the south-bound platform means that passengers standing waiting for their trains have an unparalleled view to the east along the Thames, including views of St Paul’s Cathedral, the many tall office blocks in the City of London, Tower Bridge, Canary Wharf and its many tower blocks as well as the Shard of Glass in Southwark. In short, it is one of the finest panoramic views in London.\n\nAbove: Looking east through the plate-glass wall on a sunny summer’s day while standing on the south-bound platform. Sunlight is playing on the surface of the Thames. In the distance is Tower Bridge.\n\nBlackfriars Station has platforms that are unique in London, maybe they are unique in Britain. having glass walls along the length of the platform.\n\n-ENDS-"
