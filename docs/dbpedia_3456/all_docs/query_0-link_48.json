I will take you on a fantastic trip along the River Thames at night from Westminster to St Katherine Docks, providing you with some useful information about each location such as how to find the spot and the best time to photograph it.\n\nI have been taking cityscape photos of London for many years now and in that time, the view of the city at night has been transformed by replacing the outdated orange street lights with new, modern light installations, turning these once monotonous views of London into vibrant urban vistas. Having photographed so many of these iconic scenes myself, I’ve decided to share a few of what I consider my favourite night photography spots in London.\n\nPhotographing London at Night\n\nIn this article, I will be taking you on a journey along the River Thames from west to east as we visit 10 of my top spots to capture photographs of London at night which includes some useful information such as the closest stations and if the locations are tripod friendly or not.\n\nWhen you have finished reading this article, why not check out some of my other “Photographing London” posts.\n\nMy Top 10 Photography Spots in London\n\nMy top 5 free rooftop locations to photograph London\n\nMy 10 top tips for photographing London\n\nMy Top 5 Long Exposure Locations in London\n\n#1 The London Eye from Westminster Bridge\n\nStarting our journey along the River Thames, the first night photography spot on my list is the view of the London Eye taken from Westminster Bridge. With the side-on view of County Hall and the London Eye, it’s a great spot to capture the bright colours that light up the South Bank. Getting a balanced composition can be a bit tricky so for this photo I walked to the far side of the Bridge which allowed me to include the riverboat pier in the bottom left, adding some visual weight into the frame. Read more about this photo in my Weekly Photo series here: Colour Wheel.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nTo both avoid the masses of people that congregate on Westminster Bridge in the evening and to avoid getting up super early, I recommend photographing this view before sunrise during the winter months. With the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben and The London Eye all situated here, this area is a magnet for tourists so finding the ideal spot and having enough space to set up a tripod is difficult at night but if you visit before sunrise in the winter, you will have to wrap up warm but you can arrive at a reasonable 7am and capture this night time photo of London with relative ease.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, you can. There are no rules that prevent the use of tripods but as the location can get very busy during the day and into the evenings, you should choose your spot carefully to avoid it being bumped into by other people. You will have far more space to set up a tripod if you visit before sunrise as I did in the photo above.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThe closest underground stations are Westminster (Jubilee Line) and Lambeth North (Bakerloo Line) and from there head towards Westminster Bridge.\n\n#2 Westminster from the Golden Jubilee Bridge\n\nNext up, we have the fantastic view from the Hungerford Bridge and Golden Jubilee Bridges where you can take this night photo of the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nThere’s no need for an early alarm for this shot as I’ve photographed from this bridge many times and never has it got too busy to set up my tripod so getting here after dark any time of the year is fine. If you want to capture a long exposure with the London Eye spinning, make sure you look up the opening times to make sure it’s still running at the time you want to photograph.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, you can. There is no rule to prevent the use of tripods but you will need to find a spot in between the poles that form part of the bridge’s structure and as always, try to keep it out of the way of other people to avoid it being bumped about.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThe closest underground stations are Embankment (Circle and District Lines) and Waterloo (Jubilee Line) and from there head towards the south-western side of the Golden Jubilee bridge. This view can be found close to the South Bank of the river.\n\n#3 The City of London from the Thames South Bank\n\nThis is a classic view of London from the South Bank of the River Thames and a fantastic spot to photograph London at night. The ornate street lamps light the path through the frame leading to a backdrop of the vibrant colours of Blackfriars Bridge, the City of London and the famous dome of St Paul’s Cathedral. I wrote more about the time I took this photo in my photoblog here: South Bank.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nI took this photo in January and with the trees free of leaves, more of the scene opens up revealing more of the lights along the path and the city in the background which would be obscured by the trees in the warmer months. I took this photo in the evening and if you have some patience and a bit of luck, you may get a gap in the foot traffic enabling you to take a photo without any people along the path but if you’re an early riser, a pre-sunrise shoot without as many people is also a good option.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nStrictly speaking, tripods are not allowed along this stretch of the South Bank but as it’s a short walk away from the really busy areas around the London Eye, you can normally get away with it without anyone bothering you. You do, however, need to keep out of the way here so as I did in the photo above, you can tuck yourself in, close to the trees which still leaves plenty of room for people to pass by.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThis spot is on the south side of the Thames in between Waterloo Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge. The nearest Underground stop is Waterloo Station on the Jubilee Line but what I like to do is walk along the South Bank from Westminster which takes around 10 minutes. Once you can see the dome from St Paul’s Cathedral, Blackfriars Bridge and some of the buildings in the city, you are at the right place.\n\n#4 St Paul’s Cathedral and the Millennium Bridge\n\nNumber 4 on my Top 10 Night Photography Spots in London is The Millennium Bridge. With the recently upgraded lights and sleek, modern lines there are many different compositions of London to photograph. I particularly like this symmetrical view of the bridge which leads the eye towards the recognisable dome of St Paul’s Cathedral and if you catch the clouds moving in the right direction, the long exposure needed at night will help them mirror the direction of the bridge and make your final image even stronger.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nTo get this symmetrical composition of the Millennium Bridge, the fewer people crossing the bridge the better as even with a long night time exposure, you will still end up with ghostly figures crossing the bridge if it’s too busy so I recommend late at night, after rush hour or early in the morning before people start heading off to work.\n\nIf you can’t get to the bridge at these times, don’t worry as there is a photo to be had here day or night from on or underneath the bridge. It’s a popular spot for photography for good reason.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYou can use a tripod on the Millennium Bridge. There are a couple of central compositions that can be photographed from the south side of the bridge but if you really want a perfectly symmetrical composition, there are only a couple of specific places to photograph from so its best to arrive a little earlier than planned just in case the best spots are taken and you need to think of a plan b.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThe easiest and closest stations to get to the Millennium Bridge are St Pauls (Central Line) which is just north of the bridge or Blackfriars (District and Circle Lines or National Rail) which requires just a few minute’s walk east along the river.\n\n#5 London from Tate Modern’s viewing platform\n\nThe viewing platform is a great spot for taking night photographs of the city from the south side of the River Thames. From here you can get uninterrupted views of the city of London or the dome of St Pauls cathedral (as I did here) and with a wide-angle lens, you can embrace the dominant chimney and the lights down in the turbine room and use the historic structure as your main subject against the bright lights of the city in the background.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nIf you want to take photos of the city from this spot at night, then it’s a much more pleasant experience doing so in the warmer months as you are quite exposed to the elements when up the tower and it can be rather cold but with the sun setting later, you should aim to visit on a Friday or Saturday evening, when the museum is open until 21:30. Otherwise, you can capture a night-scape image during the winter months any day of the week, just wear an extra layer or two!\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nNo, the museum has a strict rule about the use of tripods. To get a sharp image in low light, you can try to use a tabletop tripod like the Manfrotto PIXI which I carry in my camera bag and balance it on the corner of the railings or on the floor but just be careful as it’s a slightly risky manoeuvre. My advice is to make sure that whatever you do, you keep the camera strap on and around your neck just in case the camera slips.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nAs in location 4 above, you can use St Paul’s or Blackfriars to get to this night photography spot. Tate Modern is located along Thames Bankside on the South of the river, opposite St Pauls. Just use the main entrance to the museum and head to the back where you will find the lifts up to the viewing level.\n\n#6 London Bridge and the Shard from the North Bank\n\nThis spot next to London Bridge is quite a new addition to my list as up until recently, the lights on the bridge were a monotone orange colour and along with its uninspiring concrete arches, London Bridge at night was nothing to write home about. It’s all changed now though. The Illuminated River project has turned this dull-looking bridge into a vibrant wall of colour and not to be outdone, the lights on the Shard help it stand out at night, making it a fantastic subject for the bridge to lead the eye towards. To see how I got on taking this shot, take a look at this post: Illuminated River.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nIf vibrant colour is what you want, then December is by far the best month to photograph this view of London at night. During the month of December, The Shard puts on its own multicoloured light show which compliments the lights on London Bridge nicely. Just remember to wrap up warm and bring a wide-angle lens to fit it all in the frame.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, you can use a tripod. The river wall is very thick at this spot so what I tend to do is close my tripod right down and put it on the wall, close to the edge to avoid including it in the shot. Just be extra careful the camera doesn’t fall off.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nTo get to this spot, the closest train stations are Monument/Cannon Street (Circle and District lines) or across the river at London Bridge (Northern Jubilee and National Rail lines). You then need to make your way to the north bank of the Thames and the spot is down by the waterside just a minute’s walk west along the river.\n\n#7 The architecture at More London\n\nDay or night, More London Estate is one of my favourite places to photograph London. This spot boasts some fantastic cityscape photo opportunities from the modern architecture of The Shard, to the classic London icons such as Tower Bridge and it’s no different at night. This is one of my top night photography spots for good reason as the cool, modern lights really pop at night and with all of this ambient light to work with, it’s a fantastic location for some night photography.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nIf you are only pointing your camera across the river or if you don’t mind lots of people in your landscape photos, then visit in the evening, any time of the year but if you want to photograph this fantastic architecture without any people causing blurry ghostly figures in the shot, then before sunrise is your best option. Although you still get people walking through, the foot traffic is far less and there are plenty of gaps to take a shot.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nStrictly speaking, you can’t use tripods here but over the last few years, I am being bothered less and less by the wardens. I’ve learned to stay out of the way and be discrete and they seem to recognise that and leave me to it but if you visit, be prepared to be asked to put the tripod away.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nLondon Bridge with access to the Northern, Jubilee and National Rail lines is easily the most convenient place to head to when visiting More London Estate. If coming from the north of the river, you can travel to Tower Hill on the Circle and District line and cross the river via Tower Bridge.\n\n#8 Tower Bridge from the Thames North Bank\n\nNumber 8 in my top 10 night photography spots in London is this classic view of Tower Bridge taken from the north bank of the River Thames. Photographing this famous bascule bridge from in front of the Tower of London allows you to include these ornate street lamps and the cobbled street giving it an almost timeless look.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nThis is a gated area and opens around 7am and closes at 9pm every day so as it’s still light at these times in the middle of summer, I recommend visiting this spot between November and January for a pre-sunrise shoot or anytime between August and April for a post-sunset shoot.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nSurprisingly so, yes. Even though this is private property, it seems the management team at the Tower of London are happy to allow tripods even though it can get very busy during the day which is quite refreshing, to say the least.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nTower Hill is the nearest tube station located on the other side of the castle. otherwise, on the south of the river, London Bridge Station is the closest. Head to the north side of the river, directly in front of the Tower of London and you will see the spot along the river.\n\n#9 The Shard and City Hall from Tower Bridge\n\nFast becoming one of the most iconic views in London this cityscape view encompasses More London, City Hall, The Shard, HMS Belfast and in the background, London Bridge. It’s a rather modern looking view of the city with lots of glass and modern lights which looks fantastic when all lit up at night and it’s for that very reason, this view is on my top 10 night photography spots in London.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nIf you’re a bit of peace and quiet while photographing this view, then visit before sunrise as you won’t be battling the herds of people crossing Tower Bridge but if you are lucky enough to be in London at Christmas in December, then visit after dark as although it will be busy, The Shard puts on a bit of a light show so you can photograph it with various vibrant colours on top making it worth the trouble.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, you can. Whether you take the photo from Tower Bridge or in front of the Tower of London, tripods are allowed. Just be careful as this area gets very busy in the evening and I would advise anyone to tuck themselves out of the way as much as possible to avoid the tripod legs tripping someone up or being kicked by a passer-by.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nTo get here, you can use London Bridge Station on the south of the river or Tower Hill on the north of the river. Compositionally, it can be tricky to capture this view and whereas a lot of people will try to photograph the scene from directly opposite, in front of the Tower of London, I prefer to capture this view from the north end of Tower Bridge as I prefer a slightly higher vantage point looking further down the Thames and with the Shard directly the middle, the image looks a little more balanced in my opinion.\n\n10 Tower Bridge from St Katherine Docks\n\nThe last but not least location to take night photos in London is this spot just along the river from Tower Bridge on the other side of St Katherine Docks Marina. From this vantage point, you get to enjoy this awesome view of Tower Bridge with the Shard right behind it.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nThis is a gated area and I’ve tried to access it for a sunrise shoot and found the gates locked, so, I recommend visiting in the evening to take a night photo of this view. It’s never been particularly busy when I’ve visited so I can recommend taking a late stroll to this spot in the summer and enjoying a nice, warm sunset before taking the night shot.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, I’ve been here many times and not once have I been bothered by the site wardens. As I’ve said multiple times before, just stay out of the way and avoid making a nuisance of yourself and based on my experience, you should be fine.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThe closest tube stations are either London Bridge or Tower Hill. This spot is on the north bank of the Thames. To get here, you need to drop below Tower Bridge and make your way east along the river to St Katherine Docks and once passed, walk along St Katherine’s Way until you get to Tower Bridge Wharf Building where you need to turn left and walk between the buildings towards the edge of the river.\n\nSo, there you have it, my top 10 night photography Spots in London! There are so many other great locations to capture night photos of the city, from down in the streets, along the Thames and up high looking over the rooftops.\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this post, do check out some of my other posts to help you take the best photos of London\n\nMy Top 10 Photography Spots in London\n\nMy top 5 free rooftop locations to photograph London\n\nMy 10 top tips for photographing London\n\nMy Top 5 Long Exposure Locations in London\n\nUntil next time.\n\nTrevor\n\nRead More\n\nLocation Guides Trevor Sherwin Location Guides Trevor Sherwin\n\nMy Top 5 Free Rooftop Locations to Photograph London\n\nI showcase what I consider my top 5 rooftop locations to photograph London. For each location, I will showcase some photos, location information, and top tips to get the very best photos during your visit.\n\nAs a photographer, I am always on the lookout for fresh, unique views of London and one of the best ways to achieve this is to get up high and photograph the city from the rooftops.\n\nWith the pressure now on property developers to incorporate public spaces into new developments, getting up high to enjoy these rooftop views of London has never been easier but the majority of these locations come at a cost or are not very photographer friendly.\n\nWith this in mind, I have created this list of my top 5 free rooftop locations to photograph London that are both easy to find and photography friendly. In this post, you will read a bit about each location, see a few photos and find a Google Maps link to help you get there.\n\nMy Top 5 Free Rooftop Locations to Photograph London\n\n#1 One New Change\n\nNumber one on my list of rooftop locations to photograph London is the 6th floor at One New Change, a shopping centre located right next to St Paul’s Cathedral. Although this location isn’t particularly high compared to some of the others listed below, once up there, you will see why this is such a popular spot as you are greeted by some of the best, close-up views of St Paul’s Cathedral and its famous dome.\n\nGoogle maps location: One New Change\n\nbooking required? No\n\nNearest tube station: St Pauls (Central Line)\n\nTripod rules: No tripods allowed\n\nOpening hours can be found on their website https://onenewchange.com\n\n#2 Sky Garden\n\nThe second rooftop location I recommend to visit is the Sky Garden which sits atop the Walkie-talkie building, over 30 stories high at 20 Fenchurch Street and provides some of the best rooftop views of London you can get for free. Apart from the countless photo opportunities the Sky Garden provides, it’s a great place to have a drink or enjoy a meal while enjoying some spectacular views of the city. Of the 5 locations listed here, it is the most popular and for good reason but that does mean you will need to book your visit on their website but it is free to visit.\n\nSee a previous sunrise shot from this location here: Good Morning London | Weekly Photo #37\n\nTop tip: The glass can get rather dirty and to avoid the dirt showing up in your photos, set your aperture as wide as you can as this will render the dirt invisible when shooting through the glass.\n\nGoogle maps location Sky Garden\n\nbooking required? Yes\n\nNearest tube station: Monument Station (Circle and District Line)\n\nTripod rules: No tripods allowed\n\nOpening hours and booking information can be found on their website https://skygarden.london/booking\n\n#3 The Garden at 120\n\nA relative newcomer to the party, the Garden at 120 opened in 2019 and is located upon the 16th floor over at 120 Fenchurch Street. Nestled amongst the taller buildings in the city, this particular location is a breath of fresh air when it comes to photography as they take a more pragmatic view of the use of tripods and as long as you are sensible and keep out of the way of the other visitors, they can be used.\n\nHere’s another photo that was taken from this location featuring the building at 20 Fenchurch Street mentioned above: Rooftop Reflections | Weekly Photo #30\n\nGoogle maps location Garden at 120\n\nbooking required? No\n\nNearest tube station: Monument Station (Circle and District Line)\n\nTripod rules: Tripods can be used but be respectful of other visitors\n\nOpening hours can be found on their website https://www.thegardenat120.com\n\n#4 Tate Modern Viewing Platform\n\nNumber 4 in this list of top rooftop locations to photograph London is the Tate Modern viewing gallery. Positioned to the rear of the famous turbine hall is a 10 story tower that provides 360-degree views of the city. The highlights are the unobscured view of St Paul’s Cathedral and the high rise buildings over in the city.\n\nWhile up at the viewing gallery, you can grab a coffee from the cafe and wander around the outer edge out in the fresh air and take in the different views on offer.\n\nTop Tip: During the warmer months when the days are longer, you can grab a great sunset shot of the city by visiting on a Friday or Saturday night as the museum closes later.\n\nGoogle maps location Tate Modern Viewing Platform\n\nbooking required?

This relatively modern building is liked and loathed equally but what it does offer is a great view up towards Bank with the high rises of the city providing an epic backdrop.\n\nUp at the roof terraces is a bar/restaurant called Coq D’Argent which hosts live music events in the summer which creates a great vibe if you're looking for a bit of music to accompany your photography but if this isn’t your thing, make sure to check their website below so you know the best time to visit that suits you.\n\nGoogle maps location No 1 Poultry\n\nbooking required?

That being said, with just a few useful pointers that will help you plan and inspire while out in the city, you can increase your chances of going from taking a few OK photos to taking a few great photos of London.\n\nOne thing to note before we dive in is that although some of these tips are specific to photographing London such as some of the locations I mention, most of the tips can be used in any city or town you happen to be in so just because you might not be photographing London, it doesn’t mean you can’t take some of these ideas and apply them locally to you.\n\nSo, let’s not waste any time and jump into my 10 top tips for photographing London!\n\n#1 Check where and when you can use a tripod in London\n\nThis photography tip is an important one because the use of tripods in London is to some, a contentious topic. Experiences and therefor opinions of when and where tripods can be used will vary so although I won’t be able to say definitively what is or isn’t ok, I will be able to give you some general advice to help you manage this ambiguous subject.\n\nThere are some well-known areas of London that have some very strict “no tripod” rules such as the area around County Hall and the London Eye near Westminster Bridge as well as More London and City Hall over by Tower Bridge, as these are all technically private land. There are, however, plenty of places you can still use a tripod to capture some great shots along the Thames. Directly in front of the Tower of London on the north side and the areas around Tate Modern and the Millennium Bridge are good examples to start.\n\nMy personal experience has overall been positive. I have taken my tripod into London countless times and can count on one hand how many times I have been approached about the use of my tripod. I tend to stick to the rules and I’m aware of the absolute no-go areas so, overall, I have learned to work around the restrictions avoiding any necessary telling off from the local security guards. Check my advice below so you can be as informed as possible when heading into London with your tripod and remember, the vast majority of outdoor places are ok with tripods providing you act responsibly.\n\nResearch the location\n\nBefore you travel, do your research. Check the owner’s website if they have one or ask the photography community. Knowing the rules can help if you get approached by someone less informed and in some situations, enables you to reasonably and respectfully stand your ground if you know tripods are allowed.\n\nLook out for the tripod police\n\nIf you are unsure of the rules and there are no signs, go ahead and set the tripod up but always be ready to be approached and told to put the tripod away.\n\nAvoid confrontation\n\nIf approached, just be polite and respond appropriately. The guards are just following instruction and even if you come across a wise guy, the best thing to do is move on and avoid any unnecessary confrontation.\n\nBe considerate to others\n\nEven if tripods are allowed, remember that you have no right of way over anyone else so try to keep out of the way to avoid your tripod being bumped or worse, someone tripping on one of the tripod legs. Photographers have a hard-enough rep and we certainly don’t want it to be made any worse.\n\n#2 Embrace the grey weather when photographing London\n\nYou may notice as you read this post that all the photos have a common grey, almost monochromatic look to them. This was a deliberate choice I made to keep the images consistent but also show that London can still look great in what most consider bad light. London gets cloudy. I mean, like, all the time and anyone who visits the city has a pretty good chance of experiencing this pretty dull weather for themselves. So when heading out with your camera, you have to keep an open mind as to the style of the photos you will likely walk away with and instead of being put off or unmotivated, try to embrace the weather, seek out some interesting shapes and lines and let the darker clouds give your photos a sense of mood rather than let them defeat your inspiration.\n\nIn this previous blog post, I talked about how a wet, miserable day in London turned out to be a surprisingly positive shoot: Capturing London on a Cloudy Day.\n\n#3 Photograph London’s financial district on the weekend and don’t forget to look up!\n\nLike most major cities around the world, London has a financial district, well actually it has two. One in the Square Mile (The City of London) and the other over at Canary Wharf just east of the city. The thing about most of these financial companies is that they tend not to work weekends and as such, this part of London pretty much shuts down over the weekend which for street photographers is less fun but if you want to capture some of these cool skyscrapers and empty London streets, it’s a great location to spend a few hours having the place nearly all to yourself.\n\nWhile surrounded by all these tall buildings, why not have a go at some “Look Up” shots like this one here. Not an original idea but with the ever-changing London skyline, there is always a new view to be captured and best yet, you can take these types of photos any day of the week!\n\n#4 Get out early to photograph London’s popular tourist hot spots\n\nLondon can get really busy, particularly at the weekend around the popular tourist hot spots and if you are looking to capture the location free of too many people, then you really must avoid daytime and evening visits. Instead, set your alarm for 4 or 5 am and get out to these popular locations before most of the tourists have even sat down for their hotel breakfast.\n\nLondon’s great for an early start as public transport will be running and you can get anywhere quickly enough. In addition, you get to be out during the very best time of day for photography as the light is always best in the morning, it’s so much quieter and you have the entire place to yourself for a short while.\n\n#5 Get up high for free, without booking and photograph London’s rooftops\n\nAlthough there are plenty of opportunities to get some cityscape photos from high up above the streets of London, many come at a cost for entry or requirement to buy food or drink but there are a few rooftop photo spots in London that don’t cost or even require advance booking and you can just rock up on the day and take advantage of some of the epic views of the city and start shooting. Below are my top three to get you started.\n\nOne New Change (Find it on Google Maps)\n\nGreat for fantastic high-up and close-up shots of St Paul’s Cathedral.\n\nTripods allowed? No.\n\nTate Modern Viewing Platform (Find it on Google Maps)\n\nGreat for elevated views of the modern financial district in the city and fantastic views of St Paul’s Cathedral from across the river.\n\nTripods allowed? No.\n\nThe Garden at 120 (Find it on Google Maps)\n\nGreat for a framed view across West London like the one posted above. Also, there are great rooftop views of Tower Bridge, Canary Wharf and St Mary Axe (aka The Gherkin).\n\nTripods allowed? Yes.\n\n#6 Photograph the London skyline by walking the South Bank\n\nMy absolute favourite thing to do with my camera in London is to walk the South Bank between Westminster and Tower Bridge. This stretch of the Thames Path is popular for good reason as you get to experience some of the best views of London’s skyline available. Although the walk itself isn’t too long, you do need to allow a couple of hours at least if you visit for the first time as you will no doubt stop to capture all the great views as you go.\n\nAlong with the classics such as Big Ben, St Paul’s Cathedral and the high rises over in the city, the South Bank offers some great opportunities to capture some street photography and architecture too so, like much of London, it has something for all types of photographer.\n\nBonus Tip: If you have time, walk back along the North Bank. Although a little quieter, you can still grab some great cityscape photos of The Shard, Tate Modern and the London Eye.\n\n#7 Walk London’s streets and photograph the hidden views\n\nNext up in my top tips for photographing London is to get out on foot and find some of the hidden views of London. They are dotted all over the place and provide great opportunities to take cool, framed photos of some of London’s architectural icons.\n\nThe centre of London isn’t a huge place and if you're prepared to get your walking boots on and wander the streets you can be rewarded with some great views of the city. Unless I have a planned shoot and need to get somewhere in good time, I would rather wander the streets with my camera instead of missing potential opportunities by rushing across the city on public transport. If you’re short of time, I’ve listed a few of the more popular backstreets that provide great views of London which also include links to Google Maps to help you find them.\n\nLovat Lane (Find it on Google Maps)\n\nThis cobbled street provides a great foreground for this fantastic view of the Shard from across the river.\n\nWatling Street (Find it on Google Maps)\n\nA great view of St Paul's Cathedral where you can make use of the buildings that flank the street to frame the cathedral and the yellow painted lines which provide some great lead-in lines.\n\nSt Helen’s Place (Find it on Google Maps)\n\nThis is a cute little street hidden amongst the high-rise buildings in the city and provides some classic London architecture with a great view of St Mary Axe (The Gherkin) which towers over where you stand.\n\nThose were three of the more popular hidden views of London but there are so many more which can be found as you wander the street so if you have time, grab some comfy shoes and head out to explore.\n\n#8 Shoot London, whatever the weather\n\nNumber 8 in my top tips for photographing London is a bit of an extension of tip #2 as it also talks about the weather conditions but this time, it’s all about having some fun and shooting in the rain.\n\nJust like the grey, cloudy weather, there’s always a good chance that you’ll get rained on when in London so my top tip is to embrace the conditions as much as you or your gear will allow so you can capture some really cool shots during or just after the rain.\n\nThe photo below is a great example of how the scene changes in the rain. The wet cobbled street in front of the Tower of London provides this cool reflective surface making for a much more interesting foreground.\n\nAfter mistakenly leaving my weather-sealed camera at home, I took a chance and went for a walk into London after dark to take photos in the rain which you can read all about here: On Location | Photographing London With The Fuji XF16mm F2.8.\n\nThere are endless opportunities to get creative by taking photos in the rain such as reflections in puddles or shooting through streaky wet windows so don’t let it put you off and grab your raincoat and hit the streets whatever the weather.\n\n#9 Add people for interest and scale when photographing London\n\nLondon boasts some of the tallest buildings in Europe but it can sometimes be challenging for those taking the photos to portray the scale and “epicness” of the city to those viewing the image, so, tip number nine is to try including people as a familiar point of reference that will allow the viewer to grasp just how big (or small) the objects in your photo really are. Including just one person, like in the photos below, can add just enough interest, mystery and scale to your cityscape photos without them looking overly cluttered and distracting.\n\nReferring back to previous tips in this post, including just a single person in your composition in one of the busiest cities on the planet can be a tad challenging so as per tip #3, hit the city at the weekend when there are fewer workers around or tip #2 by getting up and out early when most people are still waking up. By doing this, it gives you the best chance of avoiding the crowds and capturing that solitary figure to help you portray the scale in your photos.\n\n#10 Do your research before heading out to take photos in London\n\nThis final tip is about what to do before a shoot. Whether you have a particular location and type of photo you want to capture, or you like to just head out into the streets to see what photo opportunities jump out at you, you can always increase your chances of coming away from a shoot with a few good shots if you prepare to some degree.\n\nScout the location to get the best compositions\n\nIf you are after a specific shot of London and have limited time, research the location online before heading out. Use Google Maps, Flickr or Instagram to understand the best place to stand so you don’t miss the best light wandering around searching for that killer angle and not being able to find it fast enough. My website also has lots of London based articles to view and gather useful tips. Check out two of my articles below.\n\nCheck the venue information\n\nCheck opening times and like in tip #1 above, check the rules and regs they have. Not everywhere is photographer friendly and knowing this before you head out may well save a wasted trip.\n\nCheck the weather and conditions\n\nCheck the weather before you head out! The conditions, wind direction or angle of the sun can all affect the final image and, in most cases, can make or break the shot. Also, knowing the weather conditions will help ensure you head out with the right clothing and camera gear so you’re not standing there soaked through because you didn’t bring your raincoat rushing your shots so you can get back inside.\n\nBonus Tip: Stay safe and have fun\n\nIt should go without saying but please do not take your safety for granted. Photographers tend to carry quite a bit of valuable gear and not all areas of every city are safe to wander alone so, whatever you do, be discrete, take care of yourself and where possible, take a friend with you, especially at night.\n\nThat’s it. My top 10 tips for photographing London has come to an end. I do hope this article comes in useful for anyone looking to come and photograph London in the future or as mentioned earlier, using the transferable tips to photograph your local town or city wherever you live.\n\nIf you have any tips you would like to share, feel free to drop them in the comments below so everyone can take advantage and get the very best images when out photographing London.\n\nRead More\n\nLocation Guides Trevor Sherwin Location Guides Trevor Sherwin\n\nMy Top 10 Photography Spots in London\n\nI showcase what I consider 10 top photography spots in London. I will take you on a trip along the River Thames from Westminster to the Isle of Dogs giving you useful information about each location such as how to find the spot and the best time to photograph it.\n\nI have been taking cityscape photos of London for many years now and with so many famous views available to photograph, I wanted to share some of my favourite spots to capture this great city.\n\nPhotographing London’s iconic locations\n\nIn this article, I will be taking you on a journey along the River Thames from west to east as we visit 10 of my top spots to capture a cityscape in London including how to get there, when is best to take photos and if the locations are tripod friendly or not.\n\nWhen you have finished reading this article, why not check out some of my other “Photographing London” posts.\n\nMy top 5 free rooftop locations to photograph London\n\nMy 10 top tips for photographing London\n\nMy Top 5 Long Exposure Locations in London\n\n#1 The Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) from the South Bank\n\nAs mentioned above, we are working west to east and the first stop of my top 10 photography spots in London is Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. This is a great location to capture a cool bridge shot leading you across the River Thames to the Elizabeth Tower. The photo shown below was taken in 2017 as, at the time of writing, this view of the tower is obstructed by scaffolding as a 4-year renovation project is undertaken to preserve this iconic London structure which means we will be able to admire and photograph this cityscape for years to come. Roll on 2021 when we hope the work will be complete!\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nIf are you after a sunset photo from this location, I advise you to avoid spring and autumn months as the sun will set directly behind the buildings and create a huge amount of dynamic range which most cameras will struggle with. During the summer and winter months, the sun will set either side of the tower reducing the dynamic range just enough to capture the colours of sunset and the architecture on the far side of the river. Capturing this location in the morning is less challenging as the sun will illuminate the Palace of Westminster making it much easier to capture but you may not get such a dramatic sky.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, you can. There are no rules that prevent the use of tripods but as the location can get busy during the day and into the evenings, you should choose your spot carefully to avoid it being bumped into by other people.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThe closest underground stations are Westminster (Jubilee Line) and Lambeth North (Bakerloo Line) and from there, head to Westminster Bridge and on the eastern side (South Bank) with the bridge on your right-hand side, this scene should be directly in front of you.\n\n#2 The London Eye from the Golden Jubilee Bridge\n\nI have been photographing this second composition ever since I started photographing London. I love the way the London Eye is dominant in the frame and towers over the smaller buildings that surround it. As you can see from the image here, this is a cracking location to capture the London Eye as a long exposure which I cover in a previous post featuring my top 5 locations to capture long exposure photos in London.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nThe photo above was taken during a late summers evening which is a perfect rime to capture the colours in the sky. Although the River Thames runs east/west, this view actually faces south due to a bend in the river so sunrise is off to the left and sunset is off to the right. Both times of day are great to photograph this scene. If you want to capture the river with less traffic, then the early morning is probably best otherwise you may end up waiting some time for a clear river in the evening which is what I had to do for the shot above.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, you can. When setting up your tripod, especially when taking a long exposure, try to keep the legs away from the edge of the bridge as it’s a popular spot for people to cross the river and its quite common for people to jump on the rails which could cause the tripod to shake at the wrong time during a capture.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThere are actually two Golden Jubilee Bridges, each one flanking the Hungerford Bridge. You want to be heading for the bridge on the south side. The nearest tube station is Embankment and this composition is taken from the “north” side of the river.\n\n#3 The London Eye from Waterloo Bridge\n\nIt’s always good to find different and unique views of iconic locations and the third location in my top 10 spots to photograph London provides just that. You get a fantastic view looking down the River Thames and being slightly behind the London Eye provides a different perspective. This location is also fantastic for long exposure shots as shown in my blog post My Top 5 Long Exposure Locations in London.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nPersonally, I prefer the golden hour in the summer. The sun sets just off to the right of this view which provides warm, directional light across the image and the sunsets can be beautiful when captured from this spot on Waterloo Bridge.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, but watch out for pedestrians, especially in rush hour as the path is a little narrow and a lot of commuters cross the bridge to and from work.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nFrom the south of the river, head across the Waterloo Bridge on the left-hand side about 1/4 of the way across. Turn to your right and the view seen here should be in front of you.\n\n#4 St Paul’s Cathedral from London’s South Bank\n\nWhat I like about this 4th spot in my list is how it looks at night with the artificial lighting in the landscape and along the pathway which provides quite a romantic feel to the image. You could imagine a couple walking along the path on a cold winter’s evening and capturing them just as they are under the street lamp (I think I now have a new shot idea for this coming winter so stay tuned!).\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nThis is an early morning or late night-spot. If taking a night-scape like the one above, then it will need to be a late one, like after 10pm as this is a very busy walkway and capturing it without people means being there at a quieter time.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, tripods are fine at this location but like some of the other places in this article, it is important to find a spot away from where people want to walk. When it is quieter, people are happier to walk around you but during busy periods, you are best to be out of the way.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThis spot is on the south side of the Thames in between Waterloo Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge. The nearest Underground stop is Waterloo Station on the Jubilee Line but what I like to do is walk along the South Bank from Westminster and as long as you stay on the Thames path along the South Bank then you will get to this spot after only a few minutes. Once you can see the dome from St Paul’s Cathedral, Blackfriars Bridge and some of the buildings in the city, you are at the right place.\n\n#5 St Pauls Cathedral from the Tate Modern viewing platform\n\nThis is one of my favourite spots to capture St Pauls Cathedral and the first of two rooftop locations on this list. The composition isolates the cathedral somewhat from “modern London” allowing it to stand proud like it once did way back when. I wrote about this image in one of my weekly photo blog posts. With a cafe up on the viewing level, it’s a great location to grab a coffee and admire the view of London.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nIf you want to capture St Paul’s Cathedral at night, then it’s a much more pleasant experience doing so in the warmer months as you are quite exposed to the elements when on the tower and it can be rather cold but with the sun setting later, you should aim to visit on a Friday or Saturday evening, when the museum is open until 21:30. Otherwise, you can catch a nice sunset or night-scape image during the winter months any day of the week, just wear an extra layer or two!\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nNo, the museum has a strict rule about the use of tripods. To get a sharp image in low light, you can try to use a table top tripod like the Manfrotto PIXI which I carry in my camera bag and balance it on the corner of the railings or on the floor but just be careful as it’s a slightly risky manoeuvre. My advice is to make sure that whatever you do, you keep the camera strap on in case the camera slips.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nTate Modern is located along Thames Bankside on the South of the river, opposite St Pauls. Just use the main entrance to the museum and head to the back where you will find the lifts up to the viewing level.\n\n#6 The City of London from the roof of St Pauls Cathedral\n\nAlthough this is probably one of the oldest viewpoints in London, it’s a recent addition to my top 10 photography spots in London. What I like about this location is the 360-degree views you get around London. You can capture The City, The Shard and around the other side you can capture Tate Modern and the London Eye. There are so many photo opportunities but my favourite has to be the ever-changing city skyline as shown below.\n\nQuick Tip: Although it costs around £17 online (£20 on the door) to visit the Cathedral, UK tax payers can gift-aid the cost of the ticket and receive 12 months free access from the time of your first visit. It’s a fantastic deal if you want to visit again within the year.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nAs the opening times to the cathedral are what they are, most of the year, the Cathedral will be closed during the best of the light but there are two times of year when you can catch some epic light. First of all, during December and January, the Cathedral is open just long enough to capture the golden hour and sunset. In addition, during August, St Pauls Cathedral opens later on a Thursday until 21:30 which presents another opportunity to capture London during the best light of the day.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nNo, there is a strict “no tripod” rule within St Pauls Cathedral. Even if this rule didn’t exist, there simply isn’t enough room to set up a tripod in the Golden Gallery, right at the top of the dome.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nAs this is such an iconic landmark, finding the spot isn’t very difficult as the instantly recognisable dome can be seen from around the city and the Cathedral has its own tube station of the same name. More importantly, it’s about getting to the right vantage point which is the Golden Gallery, located at the very top of the Cathedral’s dome and to do so, you need to be fit and able to climb 528 steps. Although it’s not quite as high, if 528 steps are too many, the Stone Gallery offers similar views whilst knocking off around 150 steps from the climb.\n\n#7 Tower Bridge from the Tower of London\n\nStill working towards East London, location number seven is a classic view of Tower bridge. There are so many places to capture this epic landmark but the cobbled street and ornate lamp add a nice finishing touch to this composition. If you like to add people to your photos, then this spot is perfect as you can place someone walking along the path or even sitting on the bench looking out across the river.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nThis location lends itself to a sunrise shot in the colder months during December and January. The sun creeps into the frame on the left adding some nice sidelight to the bridge. In addition, this is the only time of day where you can catch the location free of people. As soon as you get to 8-9am, people flock to the location meaning you cannot take this shot without a bunch of people in the scene.\n\nLastly, if you want to capture this location at night, a word of warning, it shuts at 9pm every night and if you are set up on a tripod the guards will start to usher you out at around 20:50 so they can lock up on time.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nSurprisingly so, yes. Even though this is private property, it seems the management team at the Tower of London are happy to allow tripods even though it can get very busy during the day which is quite refreshing to say the least.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nTower Hill is the nearest tube station located on the other side of the castle. otherwise on the south of the river, London Bridge Station is the closest. Head to the north side of the river, directly in front of the Tower of London and you will see the spot along the river.\n\n#8 More London from Tower of London\n\nThis is fast becoming one of the most iconic views in London and is in my top 10 spots to photograph London for that very reason. It encompasses More London, City Hall, The Shard, HMS Belfast and in the background, London Bridge. It’s a rather modern looking view of the city with lots of reflective glass that can vary the look of the buildings depending on where the light comes from and the type of light available.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nThe summer months are best when photographing this location as the sun is further over to the right during the golden hour. During the colder months, the sun will be directly behind The Shard resulting in the buildings being silhouetted which does not make such a good photo.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, whether you take the photo from Tower Bridge or in front of the Tower of London, tripods are allowed. Just be careful as this area gets very busy and I advise anyone to tuck themselves out of the way as much as possible to avoid the tripod legs tripping someone up or being kicked by a passer-by.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThis is one of my favourite views in London but compositionally, it can be tricky to capture and whereas a lot of people will try to capture the scene from directly opposite in front of the Tower of London, I prefer to capture this view from the north end of Tower Bridge as I prefer a slightly higher vantage point looking further down the Thames and with the Shard directly the middle, the image looks a little more balanced in my opinion.\n\n#9 Tower Bridge and The Shard from The Girl and the Dolphin Fountain\n\nNumber 9 on my list is a great location to capture Tower Bridge with some foreground and background interest. The Girl and the Dolphin fountain creates a great focal point and if you stand in the right place, you can use the statue to frame the iconic bridge. If you are lucky and the clouds are moving towards you then this can make a great long exposure photo as seen below. The smooth lines created by the movement in the clouds can help frame the overall image nicely.\n\nQuick Tip: I recommend taking a wider lens with you if you intend to shoot this location as it allows you to capture the entire fountain along with the bridge.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nFrom a light and weather point of view, both morning and evening light can create great images but to make the capture process easier, I recommend a sunrise shoot as this location is very popular with tourists and in the evening, it is really hard to get a clean shot without people wandering into your frame. The location is far less busy first thing in the morning.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYes, but be aware and courteous to people around you as the best composition is in the middle of the public footpath. I have shot this location many times and never been bothered by the tripod police.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nThe closest tube station is either London Bridge or Tower Bridge. The location is on the north bank of the Thames. On one side of Tower Bridge, you have the Tower of London. This location is on the other side of the bridge. The fountain is right on the edge of the water so you can’t miss it.\n\n#10 Canary Wharf from the Blackwall Basin\n\nLast but not least in my top 10 photography spots in London is this epic view of Canary Wharf over on the Isle of Dogs. It’s a great spot to capture the high-rise buildings such as One Canada Square and with the still water in the Blackwall Basin, you can capture some really cool reflections which is not normally possible along the River Thames due to its choppy waters.\n\nWhen is the best time to photograph this spot?\n\nAn early morning shoot is a good time to capture this scene as the sun will light the front of the buildings. Alternatively, if capturing a sunset, aim for June or December as the sun will set furthest to each side of the frame minimising the chance of the buildings being silhouetted by the sun.\n\nCan I use a tripod?\n\nYou can use tripods from this location.\n\nHow do you find the location?\n\nFrom Canary Wharf Station on the Jubilee line or South Quay on the DLR, head east to find Preston’s Road. Head north from there and just after crossing a bridge there will be a residential area on your left where you will see the scene above\n\nSo there you have it, my Top 10 Photography Spots in London! There are so many other great locations to capture the city from down in the streets, along the Thames and up high looking over the rooftops.\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this post, do check out some of my other posts to help you take the best photos of London\n\nMy top 5 free rooftop locations to photograph London\n\nMy 10 top tips for photographing London\n\nMy Top 5 Long Exposure Locations in London\n\nUntil next time.\n\nTrevor\n\nRead More\n\nLocation Guides Trevor Sherwin Location Guides Trevor Sherwin\n\nMy Top 5 Long Exposure Locations in London\n\nI’m going to show you what I think are 5 of London’s top spots along the River Thames to take long-exposure cityscape photos of some of the city’s most iconic views.\n\nI’m a big fan of long exposure photography. I love the way long exposure photography blends all of the elements, such as light and colour together in a single image. Colours tend to be softer, distractions removed and overall, I have a cleaner, less cluttered composition. This is especially true when applying the technique to my London cityscape photography. If capturing wide vistas of London’s skyline from the River Thames, it can end up a rather cluttered image. The fast-flowing river, the many, many people that walk along the banks and some of the less attractive or ill-fitting architecture can all add a sense of chaos and noise to the final image. By rendering the river silky smooth, removing all of the people and softening the sky, I find long exposure photography adds balance and focus to the final image.\n\nI previously wrote a more detailed article about why I take Long Exposures and what it brings to both the colour and composition of my images. You can find the post here: SLOWING TIME: WHY THE LONG EXPOSURE?\n\nIn this post, I’m going to show you 5 of my top spots along the River Thames that are ideal locations to capture long exposure photos of London’s iconic views. I will attempt to cover some of the more practical information such as how to get there and when to visit. It’s probably worth noting at this point that the list below is far from exhaustive. There are many other great locations along the river or elsewhere in the city to take long exposure photos but as mentioned, these are some of my top locations which I want to share with you.\n\nIn this post, I won’t talk too much about the technique or equipment I use but if you are interested in this, take a look at a previous article I wrote which covers my 10 step approach to taking long exposure photos: HOW I TAKE LONG EXPOSURE PICTURES.\n\nOne last thing to add before we jump in to the 5 locations is that all 5 are tripod friendly. Tripods are a key component when taking long exposure photos as the camera has to be absolutely still and like most cities, there are many privately owned areas with strict rules around tripod use but for all of these locations, you should have no problem with tripod police spoiling your fun.\n\nThe London Eye from The Golden Jubilee Bridge\n\nFujifilm XT2 | XF18-55mm | 24mm | 121 seconds | f/10 | ISO200\n\nTravelling West to East along the River Thames, we will start at the London Eye. The London Eye itself is probably the best landmark in London to capture with Long Exposure photography as the spinning wheel adds a great sense of motion and interest in the sky, especially when the sky is clear as in the photo here. There are a handful of great locations to capture the London eye such as from Westminster Bridge in the distance, directly from the front or behind the wheel but for long exposure compositions, this is my favourite.\n\nTop tip: Opening times for the London Eye vary throughout the year so if you want to get the movement like that shown in the photo below you should ensure you plan the shoot while the London Eye is open.\n\nGetting Here:\n\nThe nearest tube station is Embankment which is along the Circle and District lines. When existing the station, head towards the riverside and under Hungerford Bridge and up the stairs onto the southern Golden Jubilee Bridge.\n\nClick here to open location on Google Maps\n\nWhen To Visit:\n\nThe London Eye itself faces west so straight at the setting sun. This means during the golden hour and sunset, you can get some great light. You can still get some great shots of the London Eye at sunrise but I find it best to avoid the months Between September and March as the sun rises behind the London Eye which can cause issues getting a correctly exposed image. Oh, and you have to get up super early!\n\nWestminster from Waterloo Bridge\n\nFujifilm X-T10 | XF18-55mm | 23mm | 58 seconds | f/11 | ISO200\n\nOver the years, I have walked across Waterloo Bridge many times and love this view towards the west, but before I started taking long exposure photos, I never really captured a photo of it I particularly like. How does it go again? “A good view does not necessarily make a good photo?”\n\nUsually, there’s a lot going on in this composition. With the rough waters, London Eye, people walking across the Golden Jubilee Bridge and along the Southbank, it’s hard to pick out the main focus points in the composition. By capturing the scene as a long exposure, some of these elements are removed from the composition leaving the rest of the image some room to breathe.\n\nGetting Here:\n\nThere is a choice of tube stations for this location. Waterloo which is on the Jubilee Line or you have both Embankment or Temple to choose from on the Circle and District Lines.\n\nClick here to open location on Google Maps\n\nWhen To Visit:\n\nTo capture a good sunrise, the winter months are a great time to do so as the sun will light the scene from the left but I find the summer months the best time for capturing the evening light as the sun sets to the right of the scene, later in the evening meaning less river traffic to avoid in your photo and importantly, less people crossing the bridge as the path is a bit tight for space, leaving little room to set up the tripod safely.\n\nIf you’re interested as to how I edited the photo above, I wrote a post about the steps I took which you can find here: EDITING SUNSET AT THE SOUTH BANK\n\nSt Paul’s Cathedral and the Millennium Bridge\n\nFujifilm X-T2 | XF18-55mm | 25mm | 161 seconds | f/11 | ISO200\n\nContinuing east along the river, the composition here is an incredibly popular one for good reason. The Millennium Bridge creates fantastic lead-in lines towards the world-famous St Paul’s Cathedral. The Millennium Bridge can be very busy at times and taking this photo with a standard exposure will capture all of those people compromising the strong, simple lines as you can see here but by using the long exposure technique, all of those people are rendered invisible in the final image simplifying the overall image.\n\nHere you can see exactly the same photo taken with a 1/40s exposure showing people crossing the Millennium Bridge.\n\nGetting Here:\n\nThis location is really easy to find. When I took this photo, I was situated right outside the front doors of the Tate Modern Museum on the south bank of the River Thames. Getting here is also super easy as there are many local stations such as London Bridge for National Rail, Jubilee and Northern Lines which are all located south of the river or on the north side you have Mansion House for the Circle or District Lines. You also have St Paul’s on the Circle Line. Head towards Tate Modern and you will find the spot right by the river.\n\nClick here to open location on Google Maps\n\nWhen To Visit:\n\nCatching a good sunset or sunrise requires a bit of a late night or early morning as the summer months are best. During May to July, the sun rises in the north-east and sets in the north west. Facing north to take the photo, the sun is close by when the best light hits the cathedral. If you want to visit the area and have it all to yourself, then a summer sunrise, although incredibly early is the best option.\n\nCity Hall and the Shard from Tower Bridge\n\nFujifilm X-T2 | XF18-55mm | 18mm | 150 seconds | f/8 | ISO200\n\nLooking west from Tower Bridge provides some great views of The Shard along with the striking architecture of More London and City Hall. Although they belong to different estates, the modern architecture of More London and The Shard complement each other nicely.\n\nThis view is another example of how using long exposure removes some of the distractions in an ordinarily busy scene to add calm and focus on the main subject. With the smooth water and softer clouds, the hard-chiselled lines such as those belonging to the Shard are enhanced leaving no doubt as to the main focal point in the composition.\n\nGetting Here:\n\nBy far the easiest way to get to Tower Bridge is to take the short walk from either London Bridge (Jubilee Line, Northern Line or National Rail) or Tower Hill (Circle and District Lines). During the day and late into the evening, Tower bridge can be incredibly busy with tourists and commuters so, although tripods are allowed, there is a high risk of it being knocked or bumped. My advice is to keep the tripod retracted and take advantage of the deep walls around the towers to rest the tripod away from the foot traffic. Just be careful the camera is not knocked into the river!\n\nClick here to open location on Google Maps\n\nWhen To Visit:\n\nAs with Waterloo Bridge, if you want to capture a cracking sunset with a little less people around, I think the summer months are best. The sun sets just off to the right lights up the architecture beautifully and the later sunset means a little less foot traffic. As for sunrise, the winter months provide the best chance of great light in the clouds above the buildings as in December and January, the sun rises just off to the right of the scene.\n\nTower Bridge from the Girl and the Dolphin Fountain\n\nFujifilm X-T2 | XF10-24mm | 16mm | 150 seconds | f/11 | ISO200\n\nThe last stop on this trip down the Thames is Tower Bridge. Tower Bridge is arguably one of the most instantly recognisable structures in the world. The twin towers are a fantastic subject for a long exposure photo and I think this location, with the fountain adding foreground interest, provides one of the best compositions of this iconic bridge.\n\nGetting Here:\n\nAs with the location above, the easiest way to get to Tower Bridge is to arrive from either London Bridge (Jubilee Line, Northern Line or National Rail) or the now closer Tower Hill Station (Circle and District Lines). Once at Tower Bridge, the fountain is on the north side of the river right by to the stairs that lead to the bridge’s road level. You can’t miss it.\n\nClick here to open location on Google Maps\n\nWhen To Visit:\n\nYou may have gathered from what you have read so far, I find the best light for a long exposure at sunrise or sunset and I find this location great for a sunset photo during the summer months. I’m not keen of having the sun set directly in the scene when taking long exposure photos as it creates too much contrast and can render the subject a silhouette. Having the light come in from the side or front of the subject creates a more balanced exposure and when an epic sunset takes place just outside the frame the best of the light is captured without fighting the dynamic range.\n\nYou may require a little patience when capturing this shot as this is the only location listed where people can literally walk in front of your camera. This is a popular spot for tourists capturing a look at Tower Bridge, usually standing for long enough to be rendered visible in your image, regardless of how long the exposure time is. If you want to avoid waiting for a suitable gap or even happy to risk not getting a clean shot at all, then a winter sunrise, all being well with the weather can provide a great shot with a lot less people around.\n\nTo capture a great long exposure sunset/sunrise photo of London, you are at the mercy of the weather to get that great light but one other important element that needs to be considered is the clouds. With a long exposure photo, the density and direction the clouds are moving can make or break the final photo. In terms of composition, if the clouds are moving directly away or towards the camera, they can create fantastic lead in lines. Even if the light doesn’t turn out great, if the clouds play their part, you can still walk away with a great long exposure image.\n\nSo, there you have it, 5 of my favourite spots to take long exposure photos along the River Thames in London. As I mentioned at the beginning of the post, there are many more spots around the city that are also great to capture but I personally feel that by incorporating the river adds great balance against the movement captured in the sky.\n\nFeel free to leave a comment with your own suggestions for long exposure locations in London and further afield.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nRead More"
