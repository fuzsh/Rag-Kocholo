        "text": "Can anyone tell me what the default route is between Blackfriars and Baker Street and does it cost £2.40 in the peaks to go to Farringdon on the train and then take the tube or is that not a default route?\n\nOnly one route seems to be listed online, so it suggests it is but I know to expect the unexpected at times.\n\nThey are both Zone 1 stations, so it's the same cost as any other pair of central London stations.\n\nThe obvious routes would appear to be Thameslink to Farringdon and Circle etc. to Baker Street, or Circle etc. to Embankment and Bakerloo to Baker Street. Circle to Westminster and Jubilee to Baker Street is also possible.\n\nFor a longer travel experience, you could take the Circle Line all the way round in either direction, changing at Edgware Road if clockwise.\n\nThameslink moonlights as part of the Tube network for fares purposes in central London (and beyond - between West Hampstead and Elephant & Castle / London Bridge), so when using Oyster or contactless it's just treated as another Tube line for journeys between these points.\n\n(Indeed you can use an expensive paper LU single ticket too on Thameslink between these points if you want/need to.)\n\nThameslink to Farringdon is the obvious route, but whichever way you go it'll cost the same - £2.40 both peak and off-peak, or if you have a Railcard discount on your Oyster it's £1.60 at off-peak times.\n\nWhen using Oyster, I would say that the default route is between Blackfriars and Baker Street is any route which does not exceed the maximum journey time and does not involve an intermediate touch with the Oyster card.\n\nIt's fine to use any out-of-station interchanges - there aren't many obvious ones for this journey, but for example Thameslink to St Pancras, exit then walk to KXSP Tube station, enter and continue on. Farringdon is just a much easier way of making this change... but via St Pancras would for example allow you to pick up a coffee en-route (not really enough time for Champagne unless you gulp it down!).\n\nCan anyone tell me what the default route is between Blackfriars and Baker Street and does it cost £2.40 in the peaks to go to Farringdon on the train and then take the tube or is that not a default route?\n\nOnly one route seems to be listed online, so it suggests it is but I know to expect the unexpected at times.\n\nIf you are asking whether the price is any different from Blackfriars Underground Station or London Blackfriars Rail Station, the answer is no, the fare is exactly the same.\n\nThe Thameslink 'core' is inter-available, and in any case there is never a surcharge for mixed modes on journeys within Zone 1 only.\n\nWhen using Oyster, I would say that the default route is between Blackfriars and Baker Street is any route which does not exceed the maximum journey time and does not involve an intermediate touch with the Oyster card.\n\nI like this answer a lot. This is a good description of the default route because the reason it isn't defined is precisely that you can often go more than one way. Intermediate touches might not change the fare, but they could for more than one reason.\n\nthere is never a surcharge for mixed modes on journeys within Zone 1 only.\n\nI'm afraid this is not quite correct. Try putting Vauxhall NR to Oxford Circus LU into my Oyster fare finder. There aren't very many examples because there are only a few sections of NR lines where you can make a journey in zone 1 only and NR fares apply."
