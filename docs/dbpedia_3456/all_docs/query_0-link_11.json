        "text": "Getting the train to Tate Modern is easy. The nearest main line stations are Blackfriars and London Bridge. Blackfriars is very close - Tate Modern is right outside the station - while London Bridge is around 10 minutes' walk away. You can also walk up the South Bank from Waterloo. It's a longer walk, but a pleasant one. Nearby London Underground stations include Southwark on the Jubilee Line (10 minutes) and St Pauls on the Central Line (15 minutes).\n\nTate Modern only opened in 2000, but it has already cemented itself as one of London's biggest and best galleries - and a major landmark in the city too. Housed in a converted former power station on the South Bank of the Thames, it was planned as a space for international modern and contemporary art, and at time of writing over 40 million people have passed through its doors. It is one of the UK's top three tourist attractions."
