Blackfriars station, serving the Circle and District lines, is an important interchange to Network Rail and Thameslink services, and the London Undergound station was completely reconstructed. To emphasize the large cut and cover box nature of the platforms a large format tile was chosen. The glaze colour was the product of much experimentation as London Underground wanted a warmer tone than white, with a matt finish that was enlivened by the use of a tonal speckle; in some ways similar to the Carters tiles, Poole used extensively in the 1930s. This tile was used in conjunction with a London Underground corporate blue glazed tile to provide the required colour contrast. The result is that the public areas feel spacious and calm.

Craven Dunnill Jackfield, in collaboration with Johnson Tiles, worked closely to develop this specific glaze with London Underground, becoming known as the New Opportunities colour. It has successfully been used in various size formats on Victoria, Waterloo and Vauxhall stations.
