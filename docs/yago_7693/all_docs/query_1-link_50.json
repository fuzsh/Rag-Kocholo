From 1968 – 1970, he studied at Magdalen College, University of Oxford, in the United Kingdom.\n\nMarriage and family\n\nThe Prince became engaged to Miss Nobuko Asō on 21 May 1980. She is the third daughter of the late Takakichi Asō, chairman of Asō Cement Co., and his wife, Kazuko, the daughter of former Prime Minister, Shigeru Yoshida. She is also the sister of former Prime Minister and current Deputy Prime Minister Tarō Asō. The couple married on 7 November 1980. Miss Asō was given the title HIH Princess Tomohito of Mikasa. The Prince and Princess had two daughters:\n\nPrincess Akiko (彬子女王, Akiko Joō, born 20 December 1981)\n\nPrincess Yōko (瑶子女王, Yōko Joō, born 25 October 1983)\n\nThe family lives in a compound within the Akasaka Estate complex, in Azabo Minato, Tokyo.

He was also on the committee for the 1975 Okinawa World Fair.\n\nPrince Tomohito was president and honorary president of various organizations that concerned themselves with cancer research (the Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund), having himself suffered from the disease from 2003, youth education and promotion of international relations. He was also noted for his support of organizations which promoted the welfare of people with physical or mental disabilities through sporting activities, such as ski, bowling, dancing and rugby. He traveled extensively abroad with the princess on charity, and support missions that concerned matters of illness and welfare. The Prince often gave lectures and contributed articles to national newspapers and magazines, and had also authored seven books. In December 1992, the Prince and Princess visited the United States to support a newly established cancer ward in the New York Medical College, and in 1994, visited Hawaii to support the reconstruction of Kuakini Hospital. In February 1994, the Prince and Princess visited Norway to attend the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.\n\nIn April 1998, the Prince and Princess visited Turkey to attend the opening ceremony of the Turkey-Japan Foundation Cultural Centre. They had previously visited Turkey in 1990 as part of the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of Japan-Turkey relations. The Prince strongly supported the establishment of a Japanese Institute of Anatolian Archaeology at the Middle Eastern Culture Center in Japan, and returned to Turkey again in October 2002, June 2003 and October 2003 leading three groups of benefactors on tours of the heritage of Turkey. In June 1998, Prince Tomohito visited Australia for fundraising activities for a medical science foundation to commemorate the Australian Nobel Prize winner Dr. Howard Walter Florey.

He was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx in 2003, and immediately began treatment for it. In September 2006, he fractured his jaw, which had been weakened by his chemotherapy treatments. In 2007, the Prince made a public announcement that he was suffering from alcoholism, and was undergoing treatments at the Imperial Household Agency hospital. In March 2008, his cancer spread to his pharynx, and he underwent surgery. Although attempts were made to save his voice, he subsequently suffered from pneumonia caused by his inability to properly swallow food, and was thereafter only able to speak with the aid of a mechanical larynx.\n\nOn 6 June 2012, the Prince died from multiple organ failure at a Tokyo hospital, aged 66. He had been hospitalized for some time, as a result of his multiple cancer diagnosis. Around 660 people attended his funeral which was held at the Toshimagaoka Imperial Cemetery. The ceremony, called \"Renso no Gi\", was hosted by Princess Akiko. Princess Yōko, the rest of the Imperial Family and Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda also attended the funeral.\n\nIn June 2013 in a statement about the Prince's household, it was announced by the Imperial Household Agency that \"it [had] reduced the number of households in the Imperial family by one\", integrating it into the household led by his father. According to the agency's officials the household integration won't have any effect on lives of the widow and daughters of Prince Tomohito.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n5 January 1946 – 6 June 2012: His Imperial Highness Prince Tomohito of Mikasa\n\nNational honours\n\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum (05/06/1966)\n\nForeign honours\n\nItaly : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (09/03/1982)\n\nHonorary degree\n\nAnkara University\n\nHonorary positions\n\nPresident of the Social Welfare Organization Yuai Jyuji Kai\n\nPresident of the Arinomama-sha\n\nPresident of the Social Welfare Organization Saiseikai Imperial Gift Foundation Inc.\n\nPresident of the New Technology Development Foundation\n\nPresident of the Princess Takamatsu Cancer Research Fund\n\nPresident of the Nippon Billiard Association\n\nPresident of the Professional Ski Instructors Association of Japan\n\nPresident of the Collegiate Skating And Ice Hockey Federation\n\nPresident of the Japan-Turkey Society\n\nPresident of the Middle Eastern Culture Center in Japan\n\nHonorary President of the Japan Rugby Football Union\n\nHonorary President of the Japan-British Society\n\nHonorary President of the Norway-Japan Society"
