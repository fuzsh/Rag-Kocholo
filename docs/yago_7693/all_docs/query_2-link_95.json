He has to be patient towards us.''\n\n''I hope Holbrooke will not give up his mission if he is not succesful. The Cyprus question is a problem for 34 years. I don't suppose that Holbrooke, who is a very intelligent diplomat, believes to solve this question by few meetings or within few days. He has to give time to Cyprus,'' said Denktas, responding to a question.\n\nRichard Holbrooke, said in his part that the shuttle diplomacy which he carries out between Denktas and Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader depends on the principle of ''secrecy,'' adding that he did not come to the island to bring the two leaders together.\n\nNoting that they will not discuss the issue of bringing two leaders together, Holbrooke said ''I will continue to carry out the shuttle diplomacy as long as it is useful, but I have to leave the island on Monday.''\n\nAfter the meeting, TRNC President Denktas told Turkish journalists that if Holbrooke does not see an rapproachment between the two sides on the island till Monday, he will leave the island and he will probably hold one side responsible for that.\n\nNoting that if Holbrooke sees any hope, he will leave Thomas Miller on the island and he will return to the island on next Saturday, Denktas added that Turkish Cypriots expect Holbrooke to accept the fact that there are two owners of property on Cyprus and not to give the title deed of Cyprus to the Greek Cypriot side.\n\n''The Greek Cypriot side aims to neutralize Turkey and Turkish soldiers by multi-national force,'' said Denktas, noting that ''those who consider the Greek Cypriots as the government should tell them that they are not the government of whole Cyprus. In other case, the Cyprus question will last for 100 more years.''\n\n''We are government and we can't deny this in order to sit around a table, '' said Rauf Denktas, adding that he is trying to persuade Holbrooke that timing is not good for meetings on the island.\n\nOn Sunday, Holbrooke met TRNC President Denktas for the third time. After the meeting, Holbrooke said that he will meet Denktas again on Sunday afternoon.\n\nHolbrooke also meets with Glafkos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot leader and he is expected to meet the two leaders twice on Sunday.\n\nRichard Holbrooke will address a press briefing on Monday and evaluate his contacts on the island.\n\n[06] 26 BULGARIANS WHO ARE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO BE DEPORTED\n\nZONGULDAK, May 3 (A.A) -
