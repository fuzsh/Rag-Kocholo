He had undergone several cancer-related operations since 1991 and was treated for alcoholism in 2007.\n\nPrince Tomohito was the eldest son of Prince Mikasa and Princess Yuriko. Mikasa is the younger brother of Hirohito, the wartime emperor and father of Akihito.\n\nThe public fondly called Prince Tomohito ‘‘the bearded prince,’’ referring to his beard, unusual for Japanese royalty.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email"
