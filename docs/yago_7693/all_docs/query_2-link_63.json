Prince Paul, or Paul-Philippe Hohenzollern, is said to be thrilled his wife gave birth on Romanian soil in Bucharest, as the royal hopes to reinstate the defunct Romanian monarchy. Until then, their little prince is an heir without a throne.\n\nPrince Paul isn't the only member of an abolished monarchy who is celebrating. Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark, son of formerly exiled Greek monarch Constantine II, King of the Hellenes, has finally proposed to his girlfriend of five years, Tatiana Blatnik, an event planner for Diane von Furstenberg. The couple will most likely wed later this year in a Greek Orthodox service.In Japan, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, cousin of Emperor Akihito, entered rehab to treat alcoholism at the Imperial Household Hospital. The Prince first publicly acknowledged his alcoholism in 2007, citing the stresses of being part of the Japanese Imperial Family. The Prince has battled throat cancer since 1991. Pressure put on the Japanese royals has taken a toll on other members of the family: Crown Princess Masako has long struggled with depression and a stress disorder.\n\nIt seems that just before Christmas, a watercolor by the Prince of Wales was sold at a market in southern England. The painting, which measures 12 by 9 inches, depicts a landscape of the Cotswold hills of west-central England. The rather sentimental-sounding royal doodle sold for less than $100.\n\nPrince Charles could stock his own stall at a flea market with all the gifts that he and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, received last year, including matching BlackBerry phones, a leg of cured Italian ham, and a fondue set. Too bad official gifts aren’t considered the royals’ personal property and can’t be sold or exchanged."
