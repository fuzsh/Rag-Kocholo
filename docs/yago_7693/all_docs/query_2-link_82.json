        "text": "TOKYO â€” Princess Kiko, the wife of the emperor's younger son, gave birth to a boy on Wednesday morning, securing the succession of Japan's imperial throne for another generation.\n\nIn an event that had been anticipated for months, the princess gave birth by Caesarean section to a boy weighing 5 pounds, 10 ounces, at 8:27 a.m., the Imperial Household Agency reported. No name was immediately announced.\n\nThe birth of a male heir will shelve for the foreseeable future a politically explosive debate over whether women should be allowed to ascend the throne. It has solved for now a succession crisis that had taken its most direct human toll on Crown Princess Masako, 42, the Harvard-educated former diplomat whose inability to bear a boy contributed to her depression and withdrawal from the public.\n\nUnder the current succession system, only men in a direct line to the emperor can inherit the throne. So Princess Kiko's child will become third in line to the throne, after Crown Prince Naruhito, 46, and the child's own father, Prince Akishino.\n\nThe crown prince and crown princess have a daughter, Aiko, 4; Prince Akishino, 40, and Princess Kiko, 39, have two daughters, Mako, 14, and Kako, 11. But none are eligible to ascend the throne.\n\nLast year, with seemingly no resolution to the succession crisis, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi convened a panel of experts that recommended that a woman and her offspring be allowed to ascend the throne. The change would have allowed Princess Aiko, as well as her first-born, regardless of sex, to inherit the throne.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
