        "text": "Whats a \"King Ralph\" situation?\n\nYou've listed seven male heirs, doesn't seem too bad to me. Unless there is a big tragedy and all of them are killed off together, I'm sure one or other of them will be able to continue the line.\n\nPermitting concubinage would be a good idea though, allow the Emperor and Crown Prince to beget more children within the direct Imperial family.\n\nNow if the succession is really in a precarious situation, then they should permit Princess Aiko to inherit and have her marry one of her male cousins, either of the Mikasa line, or one of those who were demoted after WWII, to keep the Imperial crown within the same dynasty.\n\nPermitting concubinage would be a good idea though, allow the Emperor and Crown Prince to beget more children within the direct Imperial family.\n\nNow if the succession is really in a precarious situation, then they should permit Princess Aiko to inherit and have her marry one of her male cousins, either of the Mikasa line, or one of those who were demoted after WWII, to keep the Imperial crown within the same dynasty.\n\nAre you serious? Concubines in the 21st century? And making Aiko marry her cousin? That's seriously wack, the Royal Family isn't so necessary for Japan to have to resort to such things as cousin marriages and concubines.\n\n\"King Ralph\" is a movie that came out within the last couple of decades. The Royal Family (of Britain, presumably) is all blown to smithereens while gathered for an extended family photo. I think that the cause of the explosion was a malfunctioning camera, but I'm not sure. In any case, the nearest family member is Ralph, who's a loud, crass American. He ends up being the King and finding out what honor and all those good things are about. It was definitely light entertainment.\n\nYes all members of the BRF named Wyndham were electrouced during first after six years break photosession. You know what happen when is wet and cables are on the ground... But Ralph he was short time king. He abdicated for his cousin the King's private secretary Sir Cedric Willingham who become a rightfull king.\n\nIt was with Peter O'Toole and John Goodman.\n\nConcubines, arrangement marriages...That's Japan ... different culture... but you never know what the future bring.\n\nMaybe the present Empereor will surprise us or maybe the next Emperor Naruhito do that. Who knows...\n\ni think that is by prince naruhito very sad to see that his daughter cant be one day to be in the throne, in fact, i belive that he should abdicate to his rights first, because he loves his wife and child, second, i belive that he should be to obligate to have a son. The prince, maybe, believes that his little aiko can more happy in other part, because i understand that this court is very hard. For me, aiko should be happy and when she can, she makes a marriage for love.\n\nTraditions should evolve. It is all well and good, but Japan is an intricate amalgam of innovations that rest on traditions. Being a deeply patriarchal society, Japan reveres old traditions as a distinctive feature in this globalised world. These traditions give men/sons more advantageous position and assign women/daughters to a usual female stuff (homemaking, child rearing). We do not expect Vatican to have a female Pope ... Saudi Arabia or any other country in the Persian Gulf is not likely to have Sheikha succeeding her father any time soon ... An Arab or Asian Princess is unlikely to become a Consort to a British Prince. Whilst I agree about traditions and evolution, a nation has got a full right to uphold traditions it deems appropriate. Wether we like it or not, but sons continue bloodlines in the Asian society. Thus, the Japanese Imperial family, similar to Arab Royal families, strives to maintain bloodline through sons.\n\nWell, concubines, as in, \"lesser\" wives (ie, not as important as the head wife, but still having some rights ofc) I see no problem with. If all parties are happy with the arrangement, why not?\n\nThe idea to marry Aiko to a cousin is because, in the past, female Emperors have generally ruled temporarily until there was an male who was descended from the Imperial house in the main line.\n\nFor any son of hersto be able to inherit, his father would have to be an Imperial prince.\n\nI agree with Elsbeth in the supposition that Masako would hardly be happy with this, and, like Albina and kimebear, I do not see Naruhito being happy with the arrangement either: He has said even before Masako consented to marry him that if she decided against him he would remain single. That means he would have refused to take a „regular“ wife out of merely procreative motives, so it is even less probable that he would have ever considered to take a concubine for that reason.\n\nAs for Aiko marrying a cousin, except little Hisahito, all her cousins far and near are either about 60 years her seniors or of gender female, so concerning the continuance of the imperial b.lood line this really would not get us anywhere...\n\nTraditions should evolve.

Wether we like it or not, but sons continue lines in the Asian society. Thus, the Japanese Imperial family, similar to Arab Royal families, strives to maintain line through sons.\n\nI agree in that it is, of course, not up to us to decide what the Japanese or their imperial family should do. (They are not asking us for advice, anyway... )\n\nBut it is a general custom in the whole world that traditions and their validity are being discussed for a shorter or a longer time and, oftentimes, they are finally changed. For example, as you are mentioning the pope, there is an ongoing discussion in the Catholic church about women getting the right to become priests.\n\nI certainly do not see this becoming reality in the near future, at least not as long the present pope is alive – but later on, who knows what will happen? And I also remember that when the present pope was elected there was a discussion if the new pope should not come from another continent than Europe, for a change. It did not happen, but obviously it is not so much out of the question as it was in the last century. The next pope will certainly not be a woman - but he might well be black...\n\nTraditions should evolve.

I'm a quarter Japanese and trust me, they aren't as patriarchal as you think. Especially the younger generation, women are a lot more independent now and it's common for them to be in the workplace. Besides it's all about modernization and gender equality. People no longer serve monarchies, but monarchies serve people. What purpose do they have if they don't change to reflect their country?"
