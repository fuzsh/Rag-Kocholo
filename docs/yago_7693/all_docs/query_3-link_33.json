        "text": "Prince Fumihito of Akishino was just installed as Crown Prince of Japan today. This rekindles the conversation on what to do about the country's shrinking imperial family.\n\nCurrently, the Japanese throne is only open to male, male-line descendants of the Meiji Emperor (r. 1867-1912).\n\nExcept for Emperor Naruhito himself, there are only three or four people who fit this description: the Emperor's brother Crown Prince Fumihito (55), the Emperor's nephew Prince Hisahito (14), and the Emperor's uncle Prince Masahito (85). There is also the just-retired Emperor Emeritus Akihito (87).\n\nIt doesn't look like either the Emperor or the other three adults are going to have any more children (their wives are all past menopause), and therefore the succession rests entirely on Prince Hishahito being able to produce a son once he reaches adulthood. This is obviously risky, so Japan is now debating how to expand the pool of heirs.\n\nOne solution would be to allow female male-line descendants of the Meiji Emperor to succeed. There are currently six such women, including the Emperor's own daughter, Princess Aiko. The number would grow to thirteen if you rehabilitated those ex-princesses who have lost their titles due to marrying commoners. However, as Confucian countries count kinship only in the male-line, a female empress would terminate the Yamato dynasty which has been ruling since 660 BC, the longest in human history.\n\nAnother solution would be allow males descended from more remote emperors than the Meiji Emperor to succeed. Japan has after all had 126 emperors, and the Meiji Emperor was only the 122nd. Unfortunately, because of a past practice of having an Emperor's younger brothers become Buddhist monks, the \"nearest\" male-line relatives to the current court are descendants of the 93rd Emperor, who lived in the 13th century. This makes them something like 16th cousins of Emperor Naruhito, and largely unfamiliar to the general public.\n\nSo what do you think? Is it more important to preserve the dynasty, or more important to keep the throne among the currently \"famous\" court members?\n\nThe government may shelve any decision on how to achieve a stable imperial succession despite the Diet calling for a swift report of discussions on the matter, government sources said Saturday.\n\nMany government officials believe it is premature to draw up a clear idea, given that public opinion regarding imperial succession , the sources said.\n\nWith only who ascended the throne in May last year — his younger brother Crown Prince Akishino, 54, his nephew, , 14, and Prince Hitachi, his 84-year-old uncle — finding a resolution has become more urgent.\n\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako have one daughter, Princess Aiko.\n\nThe imperial house has been shrinking partly due to the 1947 Imperial House Law that states only men in the paternal line can ascend to the chrysanthemum throne. It also requires women marrying commoners to abandon their royal status.\n\n“A decision cannot be made until we see whether Prince Hisahito will have a male child,” one of the sources said.\n\nThe government has said it will begin full-fledged discussions after to proclaim Crown Prince Akishino’s rise to first in line to the throne, which was postponed to Sunday from the initial schedule for April due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe crown prince’s declaration will be the last in a series of ceremonies held for the imperial succession following former Emperor Akihito’s abdication at the end of April last year, the first by a Japanese monarch in over 200 years.\n\nWhen a one-off law was enacted in 2017 to allow the former emperor’s abdication, the Diet adopted a nonbinding resolution for the government to consider measures ensuring stable imperial successions and swiftly report the outcome without a deadline.\n\nBut as the nation remains split on the matter of succession, including whether to allow women or members in the maternal line to ascend to the throne, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga plans to focus on the establishment of a digital agency and deregulation among other top policies of his administration.\n\nWhile public approval for establishing female emperors and female-headed branches of the imperial family is growing, calls for continuing to pass the throne down the male line remain strong among conservatives. Some are advocating for the restoration of the imperial status of unmarried men from collateral branches of the family.\n\nThe Japanese government is considering giving a new honorific title to female imperial family members who lose their royal status after marriage to enable them to engage in public duties, government sources said Monday.\n\nConcerns have grown that the number of imperial family members will shrink further down the road, leading to fewer members performing public duties.\n\nUnder the 1947 Imperial House Law, only males with patrilineal lineage can ascend the throne. Women who marry commoners must leave the imperial family.\n\nThe plan being floated to give the honorific \"kojo\" to married female imperial family members is also an alternative to allowing them to retain royal family status, in what could be a controversial change.\n\nThe creation of the new title is seen as easier to accept for conservatives who are against allowing women to take the throne or married female members staying in the imperial household.\n\nThe then Democratic Party of Japan-led government between 2009 and 2012 also explored the possibility of allowing female imperial family members to perform public activities after marriage.\n\n\"It's an idea that can gain support beyond party lines,\" said a person close to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who is also the president of the Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nThe government is considering special legislation to create the new system, rather than revising the Imperial House Law, according to the government sources.\n\nPrincess Aiko, the daughter of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, as well as Crown Prince Fumihito's daughters -- Princess Mako and Princess Kako -- are among imperial family members who would receive the new title after marriage. Sayako Kuroda, the emperor's younger sister who left the imperial household upon marriage to a commoner in 2005, would also be entitled, according to the sources.\n\nThe government faces a pressing need to decide how to ensure stable imperial succession, given that there are currently only three heirs, Crown Prince Fumihito, 54, his 14-year-old son Prince Hisahito and the emperor's 84-year-old uncle Prince Hitachi.\n\nCrown Prince Fumihito, the younger brother of Emperor Naruhito, has said he “approves” of his daughter Princess Mako marrying her university boyfriend Kei Komuro, but reiterated that Komuro’s mother must solve a money dispute she is involved in first.\n\n“I mean, I approve of them getting married. The Constitution says marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. If that is what they really want, then I think that is something I need to respect as a parent,” the crown prince told a press conference in Tokyo held ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday.\n\nIn a statement issued earlier this month, Princess Mako, 29, expressed strong resolve to go ahead with her marriage, which was originally scheduled in 2018 but pushed back following reports of a dispute between Komuro’s mother and her former fiancé over money, including educational expenses for her son that the man shouldered.\n\nAt the time, the Imperial Household Agency quoted the crown prince and his wife Crown Princess Kiko as saying they “respect” the couple’s feelings.\n\nHis latest comments came as the prince, commonly known as Crown Prince Akishino, was responding to reporters who asked him at the press conference to elaborate on what he meant.\n\nHowever, he also said no schedule has been set for his daughter’s wedding, maintaining his view that the Komuros must resolve the outstanding money issue.\n\n“In order for many people to be convinced and celebrate (the marriage), I have said it is important for the issue to be dealt with,” said the crown prince, who is first in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\n“From my point of view, I think they are not in a situation where many people are convinced and pleased (about their marriage),” he said, adding that he believes Princess Mako is also aware that her wedding plan has not gained sufficient public support.\n\nHe suggested that the Komuros have tried to resolve the issue to some extent, but added, “One thing I can say for certain is that even if you take some measures to address the issue, it is necessary for (the efforts) to be visible.”\n\nIn a 2018 press conference held ahead of his birthday, the crown prince said, “If (their marriage) cannot be celebrated by many people, we cannot hold” a betrothal ceremony, known as “Nosai no Gi.”\n\nSince August 2018, Komuro has been studying at Fordham University’s law school in New York with a plan to take the bar exam in the United States after finishing his studies at the university next year.\n\nPrincess Mako and Komuro, 29, announced their plan to get engaged in September 2017. The agency said their wedding would take place in November 2018, but in February that year announced that their marriage would be put off until 2020.\n\nWhile the crown prince said in the latest news conference that he respects his daughter’s desire, referring to the constitutional right of couples to marry, he said that a marriage and an engagement are two different things. The crown prince also urged the couple to offer a public explanation of developments regarding their marriage when plans to tie the knot are set.\n\nIn a statement earlier this month, Princess Mako said the couple considers marriage to be a “necessary choice” for them, but added that they “acknowledge that some people are negative” about it.\n\nUnder Japanese law, female members of the imperial family must abandon their royal status upon marriage to a commoner. They usually receive a lump sum payment from the state to maintain the dignity of their position after leaving the imperial household.\n\nCrown Prince Fumihito was formally declared first in line to the throne in a traditional ceremony held on Nov. 8, following a seven-month postponement owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe said he was “relieved” that the event had taken place, concluding a series of imperial succession rituals held since his elder brother Emperor Naruhito, 60, ascended to the throne in May last year following the abdication of their 86-year-old father former Emperor Akihito – the first Japanese monarch to step down in over 200 years.\n\nDuring the global health crisis, the crown prince has been performing his duties online and has received virtual briefings from experts and others on the virus. He said he has been spending more time at home with his wife and three children – Princess Mako, Princess Kako, 25, and Prince Hisahito, 14.\n\nAsked for his opinion about the imperial family’s role in these testing times, he said, “It is to understand as much as possible about people who are in very difficult situations right now as well as their supporters, and sympathise with them.”\n\nHe was being considerate for his wife as she was mentally suffering from adjustment order that she seemed to be under too much stress to have another child....prior to Aiko: she had a miscarriage.\n\nAnd I doubt Aiko cares too much: being an Emperor of Japan is no fun.\n\nToday is Aiko's 19th birthday, by the way. Next year she will legally become an adult and start participating in the official duties of the Imperial Family. Probability she will become more of a global celebrity at that point.\n\nThose who pay attention will have noticed that she was absent from all of her father's coronation rituals, because they were only open to adults.\n\nHisahito (b. 2006) will become a legal adult in 2024, because the age of majority in Japan is set to be lowered from 20 to 18 in 2022. After that point there will be no underage members of the Imperial Family.\n\n(I keep track of the birthdays of the imperials because they are often occasions for press conferences where we learn tidbits of new information about what's happening inside the secretive palace)\n\n---\n\nI suppose if Aiko comes of age at about the same time Mako gets married, it will be a little bit of a consolation, since the net number of \"active\" adult imperials will be unchanged.\n\nPrincess Aiko, the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, turned 19 on Tuesday while attending online classes at her university as a first-year student amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe princess, enrolled in Gakushuin University in Tokyo, has been taking part in virtual lectures since the start of the academic year in April. In October, she visited the school and met her professors and classmates face to face for the first time, according to the Imperial Household Agency.\n\n\"I cherish the joy of gaining knowledge and would like to participate in a lot of things in university,\" she told reporters at the time.\n\nThe princess, who is studying Japanese literature, has also been taking language courses in English and Spanish, as well as sports and health sciences, according to the agency.\n\nAt the school, where her father also studied, she joined a campus tour and attended a briefing session on future courses.\n\nWhile in high school, the princess expressed interest in classical Japanese literature.\n\nShe wrote her graduation report on cats and dogs described in \"The Tale of Genji\" and other classic novels. Her piece was twice as long as the standard set by the school, according to the agency.\n\nThe princess takes care of her dog \"Yuri\" along with cats \"Mii\" and \"Seven.\" She is also looking forward to visiting Ueno Zoological Gardens in Tokyo, where an elephant, sent to her by Thailand to celebrate her birth, had a baby in October, the agency said.\n\nDue to the pandemic, she refrained from going out for a summer rest and on other occasions, instead taking walks with her parents at the Akasaka Estate.\n\nIn November, she watched on TV her uncle Crown Prince Fumihito be declared first in line to the throne in the \"Rikkoshi no rei\" ceremonies. It provided her with a chance to learn more about the imperial family's history and traditions, according to a close aide.\n\nThrough daily interactions with her grandparents, former Emperor Akihito and former Empress Michiko, the princess has been learning what is to be expected of her as she comes of age next year, the aide added.\n\nJapan's imperial household has been shrinking ever since the enactment of the 1947 Imperial House Law that stipulates only men in the paternal line can ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne, currently leaving only three heirs. Women must also abandon their royal status upon marrying a commoner.\n\nAfter turning 20, the princess is expected to perform official duties as an adult member of the imperial family.\n\nThe government is considering ways to enable female imperial family members to engage in public duties even after marriage by giving them honorific titles."
