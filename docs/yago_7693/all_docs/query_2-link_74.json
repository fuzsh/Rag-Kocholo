        "text": "It's down there on the bottom shelf, at just the right height to catch the eye of any passing three-year-old, a My Baby Princess doll, all blue eyes, golden hair and frills, with a sign saying \"Press my bow - my rose glows.\" A snap at $39.99.\n\nNearby are racks of pink princess purses, princess skipping ropes, princess puzzles, princess mobile phone covers (these are purple, the new pink), princess books and tapes, blue-and-silver sateen princess costumes. Overhead in big cardboard boxes are the princess three-wheel scooters and a miniature throne-kit with \"everything you need to be a royal princess\", including the tiara.\n\nIf you have a small girl in your family, you don't need to visit the toy department of your nearest variety store to discover that Sydney - indeed, large slabs of the world - is in the grip of a pre-Christmas princess pandemic. Pester power will have already brought it to your attention.\n\nThe fairytale princess is one of the most alluring and enduring of all romantic myths - and one of the most profitable merchandise brands on earth. These products are just a handful of the 25,000 princess lines sold under the Disney brand alone; in the eight years since some marketing mastermind brought together six of the company's screen princesses, sales have reached $4.4 billion a year.\n\nAnd, 70 years since Snow White first graced the big screen, there is no sign that the magic and the mystery have lost their potency. Last month, the new Susan Sarandon movie Enchanted opened in New York. This month it's a Broadway musical based on The Little Mermaid. In 2009 The Princess And The Frog (starring, inevitably, the first African-American princess) premieres.\n\nThe princess movies make up five of the six best-selling Disney movies. A princess DVD is in Billboard's top 25 children's records. Disney's princess magazines sell an extraordinary 10 million copies a year in 75 countries.\n\nIn Sydney, at the Powerhouse Museum, mawkish crowds are thronging to see the relics of a real-life princess - her wedding gown with its eight-metre train, her childhood letters and home movies, her tap-shoes - in Diana: A Celebration, part of the shameless Diana industry that still turns handsome profits a decade after her death.\n\nMany modern mothers are dismayed that, instead of a career in politics or firefighting, their little daughter prefers to primp with a tiara on her head and dream of leading a life of hereditary leisure and luxury, fawned over by servants and feted at balls where she swirls around in the arms of her Prince Charming.\n\nWriting recently in The New York Times, the feminist Peggy Orenstein asked what sort of a role model a princess was for a 21st-century woman, then bit her tongue as she realised her own daughter might not understand her objections: \"What if, instead of realising 'Aha! Cinderella is a symbol of the matriarchal oppression of all women, another example of corporate mind-control' my three-year-old was thinking 'Mommy doesn't want me to be a girl'?\" More worrying, to me, is the disconnect between the fantasy and the reality of life as a princess, particularly if (as in the Cinderella story) it involves the usual cliche of a ragged commoner swept off her feet by a handsome prince and transported into the gilded world of the royal court. In the real world, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nWe are all familiar - at least those of us who read the tabloids - with the travails of the British royal family, particularly the unfortunate Diana's whey-faced TV confession: \"There were three of us in that marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\"\n\nAnd there are now suggestions that Australia's own Princess Mary's marriage to Frederik of Denmark is on the rocks. A new book, 1015 Kobenhaven K by Trine Villemann, claims the Crown Prince has a long-term Camilla-type relationship with a former underwear model, Katja Storkholm.\n\nBut their troubles are a picnic compared with what happened to Masako Owada when she was drafted into the Japanese imperial family in 1993. A brilliant high-flyer at Japan's Foreign Affairs Ministry with a degree in economics from Harvard and a mastery of six languages, Owada was no glass-slipper girl. She was pressured reluctantly into the marriage when a smitten Crown Prince Naruhito declared that if he couldn't marry her he wouldn't marry anyone, thus threatening to bring to an end the world's oldest monarchy.\n\nShe has been unable to come to terms with the draconian restrictions on her life. She has no real role, constitutional or otherwise, no freedom of movement, she cannot meet even her own family without seeking permission from the palace bureaucrats, nor say one unscripted word in public. She has no income, no credit card, not even a surname.\n\nAs a result of this destruction of her identity, against which even Naruhito has publicly railed, Masako has become mired in a deep and seemingly incurable clinical depression and has hardly been seen in public for four years, whilst undergoing psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe rest of her husband's family show similar signs of dysfunctionality. Naruhito's uncle, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, is a confessed alcoholic who once suggested bringing back concubines.\n\nHis mother, the Empress Michiko, has been admitted to hospital several times with various mental illnesses, including once being stricken with aphonia, which left her unable to utter a word for weeks.\n\nThese are the gritty realities of life as a royal and, indeed, Walt Disney himself understood this, air-brushing out the more gothic parts of the folk tales on which he based his movies. The 21st century does not have the stomach of the 17th; we demand that our heroes and heroines be unblemished, our star footballers sun-bronzed pillars of propriety, rather than drug-addled yobbos.\n\nCharles Perrault and Hans Christian Andersen would hardly recognise their bowdlerised tales. In Disney's Snow White, the wicked queen dies by accident, rather than being forced to dance herself to death in red-hot iron clogs. The entire second act of the all-time favourite, Sleeping Beauty, in which children are served as a cannibal treat in a \"sauce Robert\" and the evil witch is hurled into a pit of vipers, has been expurgated."
