On July 10, 2024, the VDW (German Machine Tool Builders' Association) held the \"Innovations in Production Technology – German Machine Tools Symposium\" in Kuala Lumpur. This event aimed to strengthen German manufacturers' presence in emerging markets like Malaysia, highlighting the country's potential as a key sales market in the ASEAN region. Malaysia is set to become a crucial hub for German production technology, with the government focusing on enhancing domestic value and creating high-quality jobs. At the symposium, eight leading German tech companies, including DMG MORI, Chiron, Grob, Hermle, Index, Open Mind Technologies, SCHÜTTE, and United Grinding Group, engaged with 110 Malaysian trade visitors. They showcased their products and services and participated in 48 B2B meetings, exploring opportunities in aerospace, electronics, electrical engineering, and medical technology sectors.

Sometimes a plant has to close again. I don’t know why exactly the Wieland plant in Serbia has to close. Wieland Cacak seems to face severe economic challenges (shrinking turnover?) and escalating operational costs (operating and logistics). To make a success of a new plant, there are a few things to consider. One important point is the selection of the location with a site selection consultant. This can record the company’s requirements and find the best possible location. Professionals should be involved in setting up and transferring production - internally or externally. We are there for your relocation project - for the strategic site selection and the production transfer.
