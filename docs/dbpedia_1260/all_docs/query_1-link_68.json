Healthcare expenditure has become higher than ever and is growing each year. In parallel, many modern workplaces are intensive and complicated environments to manage. They are facing challenges in terms of employee satisfaction, productivity, wellbeing and more. The current structure causes market inefficiency which has been acknowledged to be unsustainable in the long run.\n\nCreating new innovative businesses to improve both work and personal environment are an essential part of making the expenditure lower and contributing to the society. In addition, with the Internet of Things (IoT) expanding at a rapid pace, the demand for innovative products is unprecedented. Murata is at the forefront of this challenge developing and nurturing new technologies by integrating Murata’s state-of-the-art products such as sensors and communication modules, with the brainpower of Israel’s leading high-tech industry.\n\nAccording to a survey by The Japan Institute for Labor Policy and Training (Governmental research institution under the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare), the biggest reason for leaving the job is \"work stress is excessive.\" In this survey, more than 40% of person who quit their job say their job stress caused them to leave.\n\nAbout KENKO Technology\n\nKENKO Technology is an AI emotion monitoring solution for improving health, performance and lifestyle. The emotional load (including stress) of the user are quantified and visualized in real time by using deep learning and AI. The inputs for the system are\n\nvarious types of biological information acquired from various wearable IoT devices that are then translated by using KENKO Technology to emotional load data. The goal is to improve productivity, health and well-being in corporate activities and individual users by utilizing quantified objective emotional load levels.
