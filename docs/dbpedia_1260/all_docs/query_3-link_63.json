        "text": "A food shortage after the WWII prompted increased exploitation of marine resources. Thus, Japan became a fishery capital of the world. Fish finders played a large role in this trend.\n\nThe piezoelectric resonator for the fish finder had the Langevin structure, where a piezoelectric disc type resonator made with barium titanate was sandwiched between two thick steel plates. It provided good response underwater up to a depth of 90 m.\n\nThe first transistor radios hit the market in 1955. The basic trend of seeking downsizing and portability for household electronic equipment was set by this event.\n\nMurata commercialized AM radio ceramic filters, using lead zirconium titanate, an excellent piezoelectric material. It took 10 more years for this product to penetrate the market, however.\n\n1960s\n\nColor TVs appeared in the market right before the largest post-war event, the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nA PTC thermistor was used in the degaussing circuits of color TVs. When the switch is turned on, a strong surge of electric current activates degaussing, directly followed by self-generation of heat, limiting the current flow.\n\nCeramic filters were also improved by having higher frequency and integration, and became a hit.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n1970s\n\nIt used to be a status symbol to make a phone call from a car. However, the initial mobile phones were incredibly large.\n\nWhen it was first developed, the main component of a mobile phone, the cavity resonance filter, filled up the trunk of a car. After GIGAFIL® was developed, the size of mobile phones was considerably reduced.\n\n1980sSince the advent of PCs, the boundary between office equipment and personal equipment became blurred. The world of communications continues to expand today.\n\nAs PCs gain popularity, Murata’s CERALOCK®, ceramic resonator to determine a PC’s processing speed, and noise suppression component, ferrite beads, became big hits.\n\nHeadphone stereos became a fad. The downsizing of electronic components allowed full-scale stereo sound to fit in a pocket-sized player.\n\nChip monolithic ceramic capacitors became the mainstream, as surface mounted devices (SMD) on the substrate of equipment with downsizing demand, such as mobile audio equipment and video cameras.\n\nDigitalization of audio equipment became complete through CD technology.\n\nMurata’s active filter for audio equipment removes folding noise inherent in PCM audio. It became indispensable for digital-age music.\n\nThe home video camera was another item that followed the downsizing trend.\n\nImage stabilization function with piezoelectric vibrating gyroscope became essential in filming equipment.\n\n1990s\n\nDownsizing and multiple functionalities were in especially strong demand for mobile phones.\n\nTo offer smaller size and more functions for mobile phones, it was essential to have compact handling of radio frequencies. This is where Murata’s GIGAFIL® plays a significant part.\n\n2000s\n\nPC communication is quickly becoming more rapid and wireless. The PHS card is a module to compactly congregate communication functions."
