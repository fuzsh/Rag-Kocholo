Moreover, the growing demand for these batteries in the healthcare sector in pulse oximeters and patch-type devices bolstered market growth.\n\n• Lithium cobalt oxide accounted for the highest revenue share in 2021 and is expected to continue its dominance owing to better energy, power density, and cycling ability. These batteries are used in digital cameras and electronic devices, supporting market growth.\n\n• The automotive sector is the second largest segment expected to grow over the forecast period due to the rising hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles across emerging nations. The growing consumer shift from conventional to electric vehicles is also increasing the demand for lithium-ion batteries.\n\n• Asia Pacific is expected to grow over the forecast period due to the growing consumer electronics and automotive industry across China, India, and Japan. The strict government norms emphasizing the usage of electric vehicles due to rising CO2 emission has increased the sale of batteries boosting the market.\n\n𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞: https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/lithium-ion-battery-market\n\n𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧:\n\nThe lithium-ion battery market is mainly segmented based on material, product, type, capacity, voltage, industry, and region. Based on the material type, the cathodic lithium-ion battery element generated the most income in 2021 because it determines battery features and capacity. Cathodic compounds also aid in improving the battery's conductivity.\n\nFurthermore, according to product research, the portable category is predicted to dominate market growth throughout the projection period due to its lightweight and ease of installation. Batteries used in mobile appliances are becoming increasingly important as consumer electronics, including smartwatches and smartphones, gain popularity, which is anticipated to drive the market throughout the projection period.\n\n• 𝐁𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥\n\no Cathode Material\n\no Anode Material\n\no Electrolyte Material\n\no Separator Material\n\no Current Collector Material\n\no Others\n\n• 𝐁𝐲 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭\n\no Components Of Lithium-Ion Battery\n\no Portability\n\n• 𝐁𝐲 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞\n\no Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide\n\no Lithium Iron Phosphate\n\no Lithium Cobalt Oxide\n\no Lithium Titanate Oxide\n\no Lithium Manganese Oxide\n\no Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminum Oxide\n\n• 𝐁𝐲 𝐂𝐚𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐲\n\no 0 To 3000 mAh\n\no 3000 To 10000 mAh 10000 To 60000 mAh\n\no 60000 To mAh and above\n\n• 𝐁𝐲 𝐕𝐨𝐥𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞\n\no Low (Below 12 V)\n\no Medium (12 V- 36 V)\n\no High (Above 36 V)\n\n• 𝐁𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲\n\no Consumer Electronics\n\no Automotive\n\no Aerospace\n\no Marine\n\no Medical\n\no Industrial\n\no Power\n\no Telecommunications\n\n𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐞:\n\n• North America (U.S., Canada)\n\n• Europe (France, Germany, UK, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Russia)\n\n• Asia Pacific (Japan, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea)\n\n• Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina)\n\n• Middle East & Africa (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Israel, South Africa)\n\n𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡:\n\nThermal Scanners Market : https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/thermal-scanner-market\n\nDigital Scent Technology Market: https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/digital-scent-technology-market\n\nBiosensors Market: https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/biosensors-market\n\nUltraviolet Disinfection Equipment Market: https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/ultraviolet-uv-disinfection-equipment-market\n\n𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐔𝐬 :\n\nPolaris Market Research\n\nPhone: +1-929-297-9727\n\nEmail: sales@polarismarketresearch.com\n\n𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐏𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐬 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 :\n\nPolaris Market Research is a global market research and consulting company.
