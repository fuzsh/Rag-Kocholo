        "text": "In the chaotic period immediately following WWII, radio was about the only form of entertainment and information source available.\n\nSuper heterodyne radio with far superior performance compared with the conventional super-regeneration system rapidly became popular.\n\nMurata’s tubular ceramic capacitor was used for temperature compensation in those radios.\n\nIts dielectric material was titanium oxide. The electrode material was brushed on the surface. Its capacitance was 500 pF.\n\nleft: In 1944, Murata Manufacturing was founded in Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto City. Original headquarters building.\n\nright: The poster of Murata in the early 1950's.\n\nThe logo on this poster seems to have been the prototype of our current logo.\n\nA food shortage after the WWII prompted increased exploitation of marine resources. Thus, Japan became a fishery capital of the world.\n\nFish finders played a large role in this trend.\n\nThe piezoelectric resonator for the fish finder had the Langevin structure, where a piezoelectric disc type resonator made with barium titanate was sandwiched between two thick steel plates. It provided good response underwater up to a depth of 90 m.\n\nThe first transistor radios hit the market in 1955.\n\nThe basic trend of seeking downsizing and portability for household electronic equipment was set by this event.\n\nMurata commercialized AM radio ceramic filters, using lead zirconium titanate, an excellent piezoelectric material. It took 10 more years for this product to penetrate the market, however.\n\nColor TVs appeared in the market right before the largest post-war event, the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nA PTC thermistor was used in the degaussing circuits of color TVs.\n\nWhen the switch is turned on, a strong surge of electric current activates degaussing, directly followed by self-generation of heat, limiting the current flow.\n\nCeramic filters were also improved by having higher frequency and integration, and became a hit.\n\nIt used to be a status symbol to make a phone call from a car.\n\nHowever, the initial car phone systems were incredibly large.\n\nWhen it was first developed, the main component of the system, the cavity resonance filter, filled up the trunk of a car. Introduction of GIGAFIL enabled considerable size reduction contributing to the future development of today`s mobile phones.\n\nSince the advent of PCs, the boundary between office equipment and personal equipment became blurred. The world of communications continues to expand today.\n\nAs PCs gain popularity, Murata’s CERALOCK, ceramic resonator to determine a PC’s processing speed, and noise suppression component, ferrite beads, became big hits.\n\nHeadphone stereos became a fad. The downsizing of electronic components allowed full-scale stereo sound to fit in a pocket-sized player.\n\nChip multilayer ceramic capacitors became the mainstream, as surface mounted devices (SMD) on the substrate of equipment with downsizing demand, such as mobile audio equipment and video cameras.\n\nDownsizing and multiple functionalities were in especially strong demand for mobile phones.\n\nTo offer smaller size and more functions for mobile phones, it was essential to have compact handling of radio frequencies. This is where Murata’s GIGAFIL plays a significant part."
