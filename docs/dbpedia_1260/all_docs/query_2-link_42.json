However, at RSL Group, the promotion time has been shortened to 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝟐 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐬. Specifically, in January this year 2024, we received a request from an international customer to build a new #factory in Northern Vietnam. By March, the signing ceremony of the #MOU between the infrastructure developer - our strategic partner Plaschem Vietnam and RSL Group's customer took place officially at the expanded Dong Van 1 Industrial Park, Ha Nam province.

What if we can identify the faulty coated part early in the process? How it will increase overral efficiency of your painting line, if you can measure the coating thickness immediately after painting, on wet surface, and before the oven?

That means a temperature and humidity-controlled environment, sensors for monitoring internal conditions, and an indoor truck loading lane to protect against snowy winters. The 3-story building with a GFA of 50,000 m2 (538,000 sq.ft) is located in Eniwa City. It’s about 20km from Shin-Chitose Airport and the Sapporo freight terminal, and 40km from Tomakomai Port. It was developed by Obayashi-Shinseiwa Real Estate Corporation. The land is approximately 25,000 m2 with semi-industrial zoning and a maximum FAR of 200%. According to the title, Obayashi-Shinseiwa acquired it in late 2021 from Hokkai Jidosha Kogyo. Specialized semiconductor logistics centers are still rare in Hokkaido, but demand is expected to grow. Next April, Rapidus will commence trial manufacturing in its Chitose plant just one town over from Eniwa. Since the announcement of this chip plant in 2023, the surrounding property markets have exploded. In 2024, three of the top five increases in Government Assessed Land Values (koji-chika) were in Chitose City, with commercial sites seeing growth of up to 30%. Neighboring Eniwa has also seen annual growth in land values in the double digits this year.\n\nExciting News! 🌟 Amkor's $1.6 billion plant in Bac Ninh is on track for its October opening. 🏭💼 This significant investment is set to boost Vietnam's semiconductor industry and drive economic growth in the region. The factory will be among the biggest operated by Amkor globally, covering 1.9 million square feet (over 176,500 square meters). The Vietnamese plant's size will be only behind Amkor's South Korean factory that has an area of 4.4 million square feet. Other major production sites are in Japan (1.8 million square feet), Shanghai (1.4 million square feet), and the Philippines (1.3 million square feet). The plant will deliver advanced system-in-package (SiP) modules and other packaging solutions, helping the firm with supply chain diversification. Amkor Technology Inc. will invest about $1.6 billion until 2035 on building a state-of-the-art facility in Bac Ninh. 🚀🌏 👉 https://lnkd.in/gpFZjS_6 #Amkor #Semiconductor #Investment #BacNinh #EconomicGrowth #Vietnam #Manufacturing 🎯🎯🎯 Too much market noise and no clarity?
