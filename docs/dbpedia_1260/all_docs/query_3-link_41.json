That means a temperature and humidity-controlled environment, sensors for monitoring internal conditions, and an indoor truck loading lane to protect against snowy winters. The 3-story building with a GFA of 50,000 m2 (538,000 sq.ft) is located in Eniwa City. It’s about 20km from Shin-Chitose Airport and the Sapporo freight terminal, and 40km from Tomakomai Port. It was developed by Obayashi-Shinseiwa Real Estate Corporation. The land is approximately 25,000 m2 with semi-industrial zoning and a maximum FAR of 200%. According to the title, Obayashi-Shinseiwa acquired it in late 2021 from Hokkai Jidosha Kogyo. Specialized semiconductor logistics centers are still rare in Hokkaido, but demand is expected to grow. Next April, Rapidus will commence trial manufacturing in its Chitose plant just one town over from Eniwa. Since the announcement of this chip plant in 2023, the surrounding property markets have exploded. In 2024, three of the top five increases in Government Assessed Land Values (koji-chika) were in Chitose City, with commercial sites seeing growth of up to 30%. Neighboring Eniwa has also seen annual growth in land values in the double digits this year.\n\nEP Manufacturing Bhd (\"EPMB\" or \"Group\") reported that our net profit surged more than 50-fold in the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (“FY2023”), the highest since 2014.
