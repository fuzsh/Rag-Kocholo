        "text": "When close to half the companies in Japan have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 14x, you may consider Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. ( ) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 34.5x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.\n\nWhile the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Murata Manufacturing's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .\n\nHow Is Murata Manufacturing's Growth Trending?\n\nThere's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Murata Manufacturing's to be considered reasonable.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 28% decrease to the company's bottom line. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 22% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 23% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.\n\nWith this information, we can see why Murata Manufacturing is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Murata Manufacturing's P/E?\n\nUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.\n\nAs we suspected, our examination of Murata Manufacturing's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nThe company's balance sheet is another key area for risk analysis. You can assess many of the main risks through our with six simple checks.\n\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.
