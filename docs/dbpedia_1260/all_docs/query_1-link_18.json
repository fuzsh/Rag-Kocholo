We do not identify some of the products mentioned in the IPHR report in question as ours, and they might have been mistakenly represented as Murata’s products. Moreover, since 2022, Murata Group has suspended all business activities (such as exports, sales and technical support operations) of Murata’s products in Russia, Belarus, and sanctioned areas of Ukraine, and continue to maintain this policy. Murata Group has established and maintained export control policies and procedures to comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws of the countries in which they operate, including but not limited to Japan and the US.\""
