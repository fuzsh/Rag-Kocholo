Murata Manufacturing, a Japanese manufacturer of electronic components, has announced that it will invest $78.2m (Y11.18bn) to build a new plant to boost the production of its multilayer ceramic capacitors in Batangas, a city in the Philippines located around 100km south of capital Manila. The two-storey building will have a total floor area of around 78,000m² and is expected to be completed in September 2025.

Murata already operates a large production site in Batangas, as well as a Filipino sales branch, which was established in 1998. The existing factory has been operational since 2012 and is Murata’s largest production site in Asia. Murata was founded in 1944 in Kyoto but didn’t start expanding internationally until its move into the US in the 1970s. It is now also active in Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, the UK and Vietnam.
