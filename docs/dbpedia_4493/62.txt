Oh NO! RIP Charlie Munger! I guess you'd have to say both he and Buffett have been legends in the investment world. And both are billionaires. The partnership, spanning more than 50 years, produced one of the most successful and largest conglomerates in history. Among other properties, Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, owns the insurance giant Geico and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad company and holds stakes in Coca-Cola, American Express, IBM, Wells Fargo and other corporate heavyweights. By 2022 it had about 372,000 employees. Mr. Munger, an erudite man who sprinkled his conversations with references to Cicero, Albert Einstein, Mark Twain and Confucius, was widely known for his witty common-sense maxims, so much so that they were called Mungerisms and collected in books, including “Poor Charlie’s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger” (2005). - NYT Here are some of Munger's fun quotes: - “Envy is a really stupid sin,” goes one, “because it’s the only one you could never possibly have any fun at.” - “The ethos of not fooling yourself is one of the best you could possibly have. It’s powerful because it’s so rare.” - “We’ve never had an argument,” Mr. Buffett said. Repeating one of Mr. Munger’s favorite lines, Mr. Buffett said that when they did differ, Mr. Munger would say, “Warren, think it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.” - “The trouble with making all these pronouncements is people gradually begin to think they know something,” Mr. Munger told the audience in 2015. “It’s much better to think you’re ignorant.” He added, “If people weren’t so often wrong, we wouldn’t be so rich.” Do you have any thoughts to share? #Munger #Buffett #Investments #BeckyAmble #FutureFocus Future Focus Johan Gjenvick Brent Voeller Ed Speck - The Business Leaders Advisor Alix Magner, CFP® Kip Christianson Tony Rubin Matt Amble, PMP, MSPM

🙏 Charles T. Munger Dies at 99😞 Charles Munger, who quit a well-established law career to be Warren Buffett's partner as they transformed a foundering New England textile company into the spectacularly successful investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, died Tuesday in Santa Barbara, California. He was 99. Although overshadowed by Buffett, who relished the spotlight, Munger, a billionaire in his own right -- Forbes listed his fortune as $2.6 billion this year -- had far more influence at Berkshire than his title of vice chair suggested. Buffett has described him as the originator of Berkshire Hathaway's investing approach. "The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices," Buffett once wrote in an annual report. That investing strategy was a revelation for Buffett, who had made his name in the 1950s buying troubled companies at deep discounts. Munger counseled Buffett that if he wanted to build a large, sustainable company that would outperform other investors, he should buy solid brand-name companies. "He was the architect and I was the general contractor," Buffett said of their relationship. The partnership, spanning more than 50 years, produced one of the most successful and largest conglomerates in history. Among other properties, Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, Nebraska, owns the insurance giant Geico and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad company and holds stakes in Coca-Cola, American Express, IBM, Wells Fargo and other corporate heavyweights. By 2022 it had about 372,000 employees. Munger, an erudite man who sprinkled his conversations with references to Cicero, Albert Einstein, Mark Twain and Confucius, was widely known for his witty common-sense maxims, so much so that they were called Mungerisms and collected in books, including "Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger" (2005). "We've never had an argument," Buffett said. Repeating one of Munger's favorite lines, Buffett said that when they did differ, Munger would say, "Warren, think it over and you'll agree with me because you're smart and I'm right." Buffett and Munger were the faces of Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, what became known as the Woodstock of Capitalism. They would hold forth in front of tens of thousands of rapt Berkshire shareholders, answering questions for up to six hours and dispensing their investment wisdom. Many of those listeners had become vastly wealthy themselves by investing with Buffett and Munger. A $1,000 investment in Berkshire made in 1964 is worth more than $10 million today.

“Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation.” #warrenbuffett We can’t talk investment without talking about Warren Buffet, one of the most successful investors of all times and we can’t about Warren Buffet without talking about his right-hand man for the past 60years and vice chairman, Charlie Munger. Charlie Munger was an example of how extremely important it is to choose the right partner in business. Some people in your company will not necessarily be for your company. Reward the loyal ones! Here are few great lessons from Charlie Munger: “I think life is a whole series of opportunity costs. You know, you got to marry the best person who is convenient to find who will have you. Investment is much the same sort of a process.” — 1997 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting "Another thing, of course, is life will have terrible blows, horrible blows, unfair blows. Doesn’t matter. And some people recover and others don’t. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every mischance in life was an opportunity to behave well. Every mischance in life was an opportunity to learn something and your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity, but to utilize the terrible blow in a constructive fashion. That is a very good idea." — 2007 USC Law School Commencement Address "Without the method of learning, you're like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. It's just not going to work very well." — 2021 Daily Journal Annual Meeting RIP #charliemunger

Legendary investor and polymath Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman and Warren Buffett's right-hand man and friend of nearly six decades, died on Tuesday 28th, in California, at 99. The Oracle of Pasadena's passing marks the end of an era, and his contributions will undoubtedly be remembered by the financial community. ❤️ Together, Buffett and Munger built Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) into one of the most successful and long-lasting business partnerships that enthralled millions worldwide. Buffett said, "Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie's inspiration, wisdom and participation. Berkshire, originally a textile manufacturer, has grown into a multinational conglomerate that wholly owns popular brands like Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom and has stakes in Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO), and other large public companies. Munger was a fan of the famed economist Benjamin Graham, as Buffet and the latter credited Munger for: 🔎Breaking his "cigar-butt" investing habit, a strategy the investor learned from Benjamin Graham of finding companies at bargain prices and getting "free puffs" out of them. Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices,” 🎯Learning the importance of knowing one’s circle of competence from Munger. Ben Graham taught me a way to value certain type of business, but the selection of variable companies dried up. Charlie taught me about durable competitive advantage — not how big circle of competence is, but knowing where the edges are most important," Munger's mantra was: The secret to a long and happy life is "simple." Thank you for being an inspiration, a mentor and for your contribution to the world. RIP CM 🖤

Is Sam Altman the protagonist, or the antagonist? To quote Harvey Dent, "You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villain." In Corporate Finance case studies, the management/CEO is always the bad guy. Why? Because they have the most access & control of the company, giving opportunities for running foul. Hence, committees & board are set up to ensure proper governance. Not communicating fully between the CEO & the board is a feature & not a bug. Being at the battlefield, 1001 decisions needed to be made, there's no way to report back to the Ivory Tower on everything. Hence, "Fire me if you don't agree with what I am doing" is a common remark by CEOs to the board. Each time the CEO gets away with it, he will treat silence as agreement & becomes bolder. Imagine he gets fired & being appointed back with the support of 90% of staffs while the board is being painted as the bad guy. 🎭 A Harvey Dent in the making? Let's revisit the fundamental: Control is an important currency. In a world of capitalism, authoritarian & dictatorship mandates seem to be the ironic pursuit. At the same time, the investors, being the capital provider unfortunately has the least control. Everyone wants a piece of the CEO too. From employees to congress & from lenders to even society as whole. If you think from P&L perspective, suppliers get paid first, then staffs, lenders & then the government. Any residue profits left is then paid back to investors, that is if there's any at all while they take the most risk. This explains the endgame for any business is maximising shareholders' wealth! ROE is the golden benchmark formula. See how Satya/Microsoft as the biggest investor react during past week. Blindsided initially but did everything he can to save the deal. 🙀 The cat stays idle; the rat will play! To know what's next, here's a case study summary on Disney in the 90s. Then CEO Michael Eisner grew his control in the board 'til he can execute the largest deal that time just after RJR-Nabisco. This causes indigestion with subsequent losses & yet he can't be fired. The only outsider in the board, Roy Disney, the only heir of Disney ironically got fed up & did an open letter resignation to publicly shame him to resign. Eisner also brought in a 'co-founder' initially, Jeffrey Katzenberg, a trusted former colleague into Disney with a promise of revenue share. This no.2 guy is the main reason for Eisner's success. Yet, that share didn't happen & lawsuits ensues. The eventual settlement amount is lower than the revenue share. Jeff started Dreamworks out of spite with the first box office hit of Shrek, making fun of Disney's fairytales. Rhymes a lot with Tinder, Facebook, Tesla & many more co-founders' disputes. Ultimately, a lawsuit is cheaper than a lengthy exit negotiation. In the world of high-tech AI, we still witness jealousy & ego that dictates outcome while the cat is being ignore, chasing its own tails.

Carl Icahn's journey from the streets of Queens to becoming a feared and revered figure in the world of #finance is a tale of acumen, audacity and ambition. Born on February 16, 1936, Icahn's modest upbringing was filled with a keen sense of curiosity and a penchant for challenging the status quo. Icahn's foray into the world of business began with his enrolment at #Princeton University, where he studied philosophy, demonstrating an early ability to dissect complex theories and ideas. However, his interest soon pivoted towards the #financialmarkets, leading him to attend medical school briefly before he dropped out to join the army. This eclectic background laid the foundation for his unconventional approach to investment strategies later in life. Icahn entered the world of #WallStreet as a stockbroker in the early 1960s. His sharp intellect and fierce determination quickly set him apart. He formed Icahn & Co., a securities firm, in 1968 and began his journey into the realm of options trading and arbitrage. By the 1980s, Icahn had established himself as a formidable force, known for his aggressive tactics in pursuing #undervalued companies and pushing for radical changes to increase shareholder value. His takeover of TWA in 1985 is particularly notable, showcasing his willingness to shake up industries and challenge corporate leadership. His strategies often involved acquiring substantial stakes in companies, advocating for asset sales, restructuring, or leadership changes to unlock value. As the years progressed into the 1990s and 2000s, Icahn's influence extended to major companies across various sectors, including Texaco, Western Union, Yahoo, and Apple. Each investment brought its own set of challenges and controversies, with Icahn frequently engaging in public disputes and negotiation battles. His involvement often resulted in significant corporate restructuring, driving profits and stirring debates about his methods and the broader implications for corporate governance. Into the 2010s, Icahn's #legacy continued to evolve, maintaining his position as a formidable figure in the world of finance. His battles with companies like eBay and Dell highlighted his continued commitment to aggressive investment strategies and shareholder advocacy.

His relentless #pursuitofvalue, coupled with his fearless approach to investment, has made him a legend in the financial world. As a titan of industry and a master of the boardroom battle, Icahn continues to inspire and intimidate, embodying the spirit of strategic innovation and relentless ambition.

Billionaire Charlie Munger, the investing sage who made a fortune even before he became Warren Buffett’s right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, has died at age 99. Munger died Tuesday, according to a press release from Berkshire Hathaway. The conglomerate said it was advised by members of Munger’s family that he peacefully died this morning at a California hospital. “Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie’s inspiration, wisdom and participation,” Buffett said in a statement. In addition to being Berkshire vice chairman, Munger was a real estate attorney, chairman and publisher of the Daily Journal Corp., a member of the Costco board, a philanthropist and an architect. In early 2023, his fortune was estimated at $2.3 billion — a jaw-dropping amount for many people but vastly smaller than Buffett’s unfathomable fortune, which is estimated at more than $100 billion. During Berkshire’s 2021 annual shareholder meeting, the then-97-year-old Munger apparently inadvertently revealed a well-guarded secret: that Vice Chairman Greg Abel “will keep the culture” after the Buffett era. Munger, who wore thick glasses, had lost his left eye after complications from cataract surgery in 1980. Munger was chairman and CEO of Wesco Financial from 1984 to 2011, when Buffett’s Berkshire purchased the remaining shares of the Pasadena, California-based insurance and investment company it did not own. Buffett credited Munger with broadening his investment strategy from favoring troubled companies at low prices in hopes of getting a profit to focusing on higher-quality but underpriced companies. An early example of the shift was illustrated in 1972 by Munger’s ability to persuade Buffett to sign off on Berkshire’s purchase of See’s Candies for $25 million even though the California candy maker had annual pretax earnings of only about $4 million. It has since produced more than $2 billion in sales for Berkshire. “He weaned me away from the idea of buying very so-so companies at very cheap prices, knowing that there was some small profit in it, and looking for some really wonderful businesses that we could buy in fair prices,” Buffett told CNBC in May 2016. Or as Munger put it at the 1998 Berkshire shareholder meeting: “It’s not that much fun to buy a business where you really hope this sucker liquidates before it goes broke.” Munger was often the straight man to Buffett’s jovial commentaries. “I have nothing to add,” he would say after one of Buffett’s loquacious responses to questions at Berkshire annual meetings in Omaha, Nebraska. But like his friend and colleague, Munger was a font of wisdom in investing, and in life. Read more:
