Union members have a say about pay, benefits, working conditions and how their jobs get done—and having that say gives them a “union advantage.”\n\nIf you do not have a union at your job, find out more about how to form one. Today, more people are taking the step to form unions on the job than at any time in recent history. You can be one of them! Here are three steps that will get you started:\n\nSTEP ONE: Know Your Rights\n\nFederal and state laws guarantee the right to form unions! Eligible employees have the right to express their views on unions, to talk with their co-workers about their interest in forming a union, to wear union buttons, to attend union meetings and in many other ways to exercise their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association.\n\nDespite these laws, many employers strongly resist their employees’ efforts to gain a voice at work through unionization. So, before you start talking union where you work, get in touch with a union that will help you organize. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to…encourage the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and to protect…the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection.\n\nNational Labor Relations Act\n\n*Supervisors and management are customarily excluded from union membership. For more information, see specific laws covering your position or contact a union organizer as described below.\n\nSTEP TWO: Find Out Which Union is Right for You\n\nTo form a union on the job, you need the backup and hands-on help from the union you are seeking to join. If you don’t already know which union is most able to help you, find out more about the unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO by visiting their websites.\n\nSTEP THREE: Get in Touch with a Union Organizer\n\nUnion organizers assist employees in forming unions on the job to give them the same opportunity for dignity and respect, good wages and decent working conditions that union members already have. To get in touch with a union organizer, please visit unionizecalifornia.org."
