        "text": "During my time in Texas this past weekend, the Legacy and Ownership conversation pulled all the heart strings as I was talking about it to the team and staring at my beautiful wife. At my previous company and like many in the industry, Legacy/Ownership doesn't exist for their agents. There is no opportunity to leave a legacy or have ownership. Looking back at my journey, 8 years at my previous company, I don't care how hard it might be to leave relationships that you build behind (if they were true, they will still be there after you leave the company), how hard it is to leave a crusade (you can keep the crusade alive with the new company) - I don't care how hard it is to leave because your family is counting on you; your future family is counting on you; your legacy awaits! Ask me for a comparison; ask me for more information... PM me or book me up! https://lnkd.in/eGBg-rmh #insuranceindustry #investmentindustry #finances #legacy #ExperiorFinancialGroup #buildaproperbusiness #limitlessleaders"
