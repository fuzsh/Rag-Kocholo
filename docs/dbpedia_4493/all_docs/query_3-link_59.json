        "text": "Boilermakers 1871-1947\n\nUnited Society of Boilermakers & Iron Shipbuilders, 1871-1947\n\nThe United Society of Boilermakers and Iron Shipbuilders was formed by the amalgamation of several smaller unions in 1852. It was renamed the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders in 1941 and the United Society of Boilermakers, Shipbuilders and Structural Workers in 1953. After a series of amalgamations and name changes, it finally became the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union (GMB) in 1982.\n\nThere appear to be two separate series of registration books: MSS.192/BM/2/1/1-2 (the other volumes in the series are missing) may have been originally compiled in 1873-1881; MSS.192/BM/2/2/1-22 and MSS.192/BM/2/1/3 were probably compiled from c.1911 and include all current members (including those in MSS.192/BM/2/1/1-2 who were still members) as well as new members joining after the series began. Note that this union reused membership numbers - as members died or left their numbers were assigned to new members.\n\nCarpenters & joiners 1886-1931\n\nGeneral Union of Carpenters & Joiners, 1886-1920\n\nThe General Union of Carpenters and Joiners was formed in 1827 by the amalgamation of several small trade clubs. It had branches throughout the British Isles. In 1921, it merged with the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Joiners and Cabinetmakers to form the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers.\n\nThe quarterly membership returns (1886-1920) list every member by lodge (branch).\n\nAmalgamated Society of Carpenters & Joiners, 1886-1920\n\nThe Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners was formed in 1860 by the amalgamation of several small London trade clubs. It merged with the Amalgamated Union of Cabinet Makers in 1918 to form the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinetmakers and Joiners. As well as branches throughout the British Isles, it also had many branches in the United States, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. In 1921, it merged with the General Union of Carpenters and Joiners merged to form the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers.\n\nThe admissions books (1895-1920) are organised by branch and list new members of the union joining the branch and existing members transferring away from the branch to other branches. The registration books were compiled every ten years (1901, 1911 and 1921) and list every current member by current branch. The reference books were also compiled every ten years and list members who have transferred from one branch to another in the last decade.\n\nAmalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinetmakers & Joiners, 1918-1921\n\nFormed in 1918 when ‘Cabinet Makers’ merged with the Amalgamated Society of Carpenter and Joiners. Amalgamated Union of Cabinet Makers, renamed from the Friendly Society of Operative Cabinet and Chair Makers, Carvers and Wood Turners of Great Britain and Ireland, created in 1833, renamed in 1885\n\nAmalgamated Society of Woodworkers, 1921-1931\n\nIn 1921, the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Joiners and Cabinetmakers and the General Union of Carpenters and Joiners merged to form the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers (ASW). From 1925, the overseas branches of the former Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Joiners and Cabinetmakers seem to have no longer been affiliated to the British union and cease to be listed in the membership registers. The union was one of those which amalgamated in 1971 to form the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT).\n\nThe ASW maintained a series of admissions books (1921-1930) identical to those of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, listing new members of the union joining the branch and members transferring away from the branch to other branches.\n\nLithographers 1880-1932\n\nAmalgamated Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers, Engravers & Process Workers, 1885-1919\n\nThe National Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Writers, Copperplate and Wood Engravers was founded in 1885 and renamed the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers and Writers, Copperplate and Wood Engravers in 1887 and the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers, Engravers and Process Workers in 1903. Renamed the Society of Lithographic Artists, Designers, Engravers and Process Workers (SLADE) in 1922, it existed under this name until it amalgamated with the National Graphical Association in 1982.\n\nThe general register lists every new member from 1885 to 1919.\n\nAmalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers, 1880-1932\n\nThe Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers was formed in 1880. It existed under the same name until it merged with the National Graphical Association in 1969.\n\nThe half-yearly and quarterly reports (1880-1930) list every current member by branch. They also list new members, deceased members and members' wives, recipients of unemployed and sick benefits, members transferring between branches, excluded members, recipients of travelling benefit (1880-1918 only) and superannuated members (1890-1930 only). The wartime registers also list members on active service, killed and decorated for gallantry.\n\nRailway workers 1872-1928\n\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants, 1872-1913\n\nThe Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS) was formed in 1872 and became the principal union for blue-collar railway employees throughout the United Kingdom (white-collar workers belonging to the Railway Clerks' Association, later the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association). It absorbed the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants for Scotland in 1892. National Union of Railwaymen, 1913-1928\n\nIn March 1913, it amalgamated with the much smaller United Pointsmen’s and Signalmen’s Society (UPSS) and General Railway Workers’ Union (GRWU) to form the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR). Only the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) remained aloof from this merger, and continues to do so, although many drivers and firemen actually belonged to the ASRS/NUR instead. The NUR amalgamated with the National Union of Seamen in 1990 to form the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT).\n\nIn 1897, the ASRS began a new series of membership registers, which was continued by the NUR. The first three list all existing members, and subsequent registers (January 1897-August 1919, October 1924-March 1928) list new members. All members of the UPSS and GRWU transferring to the new union are listed in 1913. There is a large gap in the series between 1919 and 1924, as these registers (and those from March 1928 onwards) were not accepted for deposit by the MRC due to space restrictions.\n\nLancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, 1872-1928\n\nIn July 1847 the Manchester & Leeds Railway absorbed a number of earlier local railways and then took on the title Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.\n\nBricklayers 1914-1920\n\nOperative Bricklayers' Society, 1914-1920\n\nThe Society was created in the later 1820s or early 1830s.
