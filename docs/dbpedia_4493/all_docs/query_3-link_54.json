Every worker in Australia has benefited from the victories of the union movement.\n\nThe ACTU has contributed to fairness and justice in the entire community as well – contributing to Australia’s major social institutions, including progressive taxation, the social security system, universal Medicare, fairer migration, decent education – to name just a few.\n\nThe ACTU’s job is to organise working people in their union to win big, important and permanent improvements to work, workplaces and broader society.\n\nThe ACTU doesn’t just talk about change. It makes it happen, through a shared vision and strength in numbers. If you believe that you can take action to make your work and society better, join with us as a union member.\n\nThe ACTU’s role as peak body is to co-ordinate union campaigns, represent workers at a range of government and non-government forums in Australia and overseas, to provide industrial, policy and other support to affiliates, and encourage workers to join their union."
