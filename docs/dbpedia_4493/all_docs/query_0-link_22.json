        "text": "Where law intersects with business and economics, the most important capital is intellectual. With its renowned faculty and a global, entrepreneurial perspective that melds cutting-edge theory with pragmatic business experience—in the heart of Silicon Valley, at the edge of the Pacific Rim—Stanford Law has the capital and energy to bring this legal frontier to life for students.\n\nA Leading Intellectual Community\n\nWith its renowned faculty and a global, entrepreneurial perspective that melds cutting-edge theory with pragmatic business experience—in the heart of Silicon Valley, at the edge of the Pacific Rim, in proximity to Latin America—Stanford Law has the capital and energy to bring the intersection of law, economics, and business to life for students.\n\nAccess to excellence and innovation is a key strength of Stanford Law School’s law, economics, and business programs. With a faculty of leading scholars with expertise in a wide range of fields—tax law and policy, statistics, mathematics, bankruptcy, contract and commercial law, corporation and securities law, corporate governance, health law and policy, antitrust, intellectual property, and employment law—Stanford Law has long been known for its role in the law and economics movement, contributing influential scholarship and participating in real-world litigation.\n\nThe Stanford campus is home to more than 20 Nobel Laureates across disciplines—including eight in economics. The law school’s relationships with other top-ranked graduate and professional programs at Stanford, including the Graduate School of Business and the Economics Department and School of Engineering to the Hoover Institution and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, broaden and deepen the experience and generate learning opportunities that can’t be matched anywhere in the world.\n\nAdvantages of Location and an International Scope\n\nWhether it’s discovering inside perspectives from corporate counsel, understanding the intricacies of a venture capital funding pitch, or deconstructing what it takes to privatize state-run industries in developing countries, Stanford is uniquely positioned in Silicon Valley’s culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, and imagination to provide students with access to advances in the field. The program’s extensive connections to Silicon Valley’s venture capital and private equity communities, active business litigation scene, and vigorous flow of international and technology-related deals provide firsthand opportunities to explore the nature of innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nBecause business and entrepreneurship know no borders, the law, economics, and business programs encompass the international dealmaking and litigation now common to business and legal practice. Whether the issue is structuring an investment in China, funding a start-up in Israel, navigating antitrust issues in the European Union, expanding into India, or manufacturing in Mexico, these programs teach students to function in the rapidly changing international business environment. Stanford’s strengths in the global arena create synergies and opportunities around the world. For students, this means the chance to interact with leaders of international companies, global markets, and cross-border regulatory groups; summer assignments and externships anywhere in the world; and classes with lawyers and fellow students from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America."
