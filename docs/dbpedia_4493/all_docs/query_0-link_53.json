        "text": "Thursday, September 5, 12:00pm – 1:30pm\n\nCreated Panel\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Discussant) Isabelle Engeli, University of Exeter\n\nSession Description:\n\nThese papers survey the politics of voting and party politics regarding LGBT rights and people.\n\nPapers:\n\nLGBTQ Politics in Congress, 1973-2022: The Construction of Party Loyalty\n\nGregory Koger, University of Miami; Andrew Thomas Proctor, University of Chicago\n\nGay rights emerged as a national political issue by the 1970s. As it did, the U.S. Congress provided a forum for competing views and policies on sexual orientation and gender identity. This paper demonstrates that, over time, gay rights shifted from a cross-cutting issue opposed by both parties into one that is mostly party-aligned and divides the two parties and their supporters. At the same time, the gay rights movement has evolved from a lesbian and gay rights movement to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender movement – leading to new conflicts about policy agendas and about understandings of sexual orientation and gender identity. We trace how the development of the gay rights movement into an LGBT rights movement intersects with the processes by which organized groups and politicians sorted themselves on these issues.\n\nThe Nomination of LGBTI+ Candidates in Proportional Electoral Systems\n\nJoel Canto Roche, University of Toronto; Javier Martinez Canto, IBEI\n\nThe nomination of openly LGBTI+ candidates is often seen in US literature as a supply-side phenomenon. Namely, LGBTI+ candidates will arise in those single-member districts whose population holds more favorable views towards the LBGTI+ community. This approach overlooks the role of political parties as active recruiters or blockers of minority candidates. Moreover, it ignores how the candidate selection process occurs in proportional electoral systems. This paper introduces a new way to understand the nomination of LGBTI+ candidates in such systems combining the supply and the demand side. On the one hand, we propose that LGBTI+ candidates will be more likely to appear in those places with organized LGBTI+ activism. On the other hand, parties with more liberal social views will be more likely to recruit candidates from such movements. We empirically assess these relations using a novel dataset on Spanish LGBTI+ candidates and activist organizations.\n\nAre Straight Cisgender Voters Less Likely to Vote for LGBTQ+ Candidates?\n\nQuinn Albaugh, Queen’s University; Elizabeth Baisley, Queen’s University\n\nIn recent years, many Western countries have seen increasing numbers of LGBTQ+ candidates run for office. These candidates are especially important during the current era of anti-LGBTQ+ backlash because LGBTQ+ elected officials play important roles in advancing LGBTQ+ rights (Reynolds 2013). Are straight cisgender voters overall less likely to vote LGBTQ+ candidates in real-world elections? And to what extent do anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes predict voting against LGBTQ+ candidates among straight cisgender voters? Past work has typically examined questions of voter bias using either experimental designs or aggregate-level electoral results. These designs provide very useful evidence about voter biases, but they both have methodological shortcomings. Voter biases observed in experimental settings may not translate to real-world elections—and, indeed, studies of real-world elections do not tend to find that LGBTQ+ candidates receive fewer voters once adjusting for other variables (Haider-Markel 2010, Haider-Markel et al. 2020, Magni and Reynolds 2018). Aggregate electoral results, by contrast, do not allow us to make direct inferences about individual-level voter behaviour, which limits our ability to isolate the behaviour of straight, cisgender voters. We approach the study of voter bias using an alternative research design used in research on women and racial and ethnic minority candidates (Campbell and Heath 2017; Fisher et al. 2014; Heath, Verniers, and Kumar 2015). We combine data on straight cisgender voters from the 2019 and 2021 Canadian Election Study (CES) online panel’s post-election wave with data on major party LGBTQ+ candidates for the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal election. We adjust for a range of voter- and candidate-level variables known to affect vote choice. Our preliminary results suggest that, overall, straight cisgender voters are not biased against LGBTQ+ candidates, and out LGBTQ+ candidates do little to predict vote choice even among the most anti-LGBTQ+ voters. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work for explaining the continued barriers facing LGBTQ+ candidates.\n\nHow Gender Presentation Shapes Voter Evaluations of Queer Cabinet Ministers\n\nJoseph Francesco Cozza, Rice University; Phil Jones, University of Delaware; Amanda Friesen, Western University; Claire Gothreau, Aarhus University; Nicholas Semi Haas, Aarhus University\n\nIncreasingly, scholars have focused their attention on how voters evaluate queer, trans, and gender non-conforming candidates for political office. Missing, however, is an examination of how voters evaluate queer individuals serving in party leadership and executive positions. Past research has documented the gendered pattern of cabinet appointments. In advanced democracies, women have frequently been appointed to lead ministries that oversee “feminine” or low-prestige policy areas. While this pattern has changed in recent years, the question remains: do queer politicians face similar barriers? In this project, we employ a conjoint survey experiment in the United Kingdom to assess how individuals evaluate queer and gender non-conforming cabinet ministers. In doing so, we examine whether queer cabinet ministers are punished for presenting as gender non-conforming and whether voter evaluations differ depending on the particular ministry they lead. To vary the degree to which these ministers conform to typical gender norms, we manipulate the hypothetical minister’s sexual orientation, physical appearance, hobbies, and interests. We then explore how these factors affect perceptions of the minister’s legitimacy, including their leadership qualities and support for their appointment.\n\nWhen Do Rainbows Form? Public Demand and LGBTQ+ Rights\n\nYeon Soo Park, Texas A&M University\n\nThis paper explores the effects of public demand on the substantive representation of the LGBTQ+ population and institutional factors that condition this relationship. Across European countries, why has there been such a significant shift in the landscape of LGBTQ+ rights in the last decade with observable variation? I argue that legalizing LGBTQ+ rights on the country level requires public demand, which is comprised of social construction and issue salience. Furthermore, I assert that translating social constructions of LGBTQ+ populations to policy outcomes is mediated by electoral systems’ proportionality. I examine the theory by TSCS data of 28 European advanced democracies from 2012 to 2020 including LGBTQ+ policy scores, public acceptance about the people, and Google Trends on the issues. I find that positive social constructions are correlated with more liberal LGBTQ+ rights across countries, and the positive impact of issue salience on LGBTQ+ rights is observed only in countries with positive social constructions. However, the influence of proportionality of electoral systems-PR or SMD/Mixed, electoral threshold, and average district magnitude-is inconclusive.\n\nFriday, September 6, 8:00am – 9:30am\n\nFull Paper Panel\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Chair) Phillip M. Ayoub, University College London\n\n(Discussant) Calla Hummel, University of Miami\n\nSession Description:\n\nActivists, politicians, and organizations have advanced gender and sexual minority rights (LGBTQ+) in a variety of democratic regime types in the past fifty years. Activists note that these legal and political changes are highly uneven within and across countries and groups. This panel delves into the actors, incentives, and unintended consequences that impact movements for gender and sexual minority rights and shape their divergent outcomes. The papers in this panel ask: What are the tactics that LGBTQ+ rights activists and organizations use and what are the intended and unintended consequences of those tactics in different democratic contexts? How does financial support affect rights? Who are rights for, who receives rights, and who is left out? How does the state incorporate heavily discriminated minorities and what are individuals’ incentives to be incorporated?\n\nThis comparative and multi-method panel brings together questions and data from democracies across the world. Kris Velasco disaggregates LGBTQ+ social movements around the world into distinct dimensions of personhood to explain contradictory LGBTQ+ policy environments. He finds that known transnational pathways for recognizing personhood vary significantly across each dimension, illuminating why contradictory policy environments exist and how strategies to advance one aspect of queer justice may hinder others. Sid Baral investigates why and how states implement rights and programs designed to incorporate previously excluded minorities and what incentives minorities have to participate. Working with trans communities in India, Baral finds that individuals value the redistributive benefits of the state’s attempts to make trans communities legible over other potential benefits. Calla Hummel and Sarah Berens examine how sending and receiving money and ideas across borders can change people’s beliefs about LGBTQ+ rights. Hummel and Berens use public opinion data, interviews, and survey experiments to demonstrate that monetary and social remittances can increase support for LGBTQ+ rights. Alberto Lopez examines common lobbying tactics from LGBTQ+ organizations and their unintended consequences. Lopez argues that maps and rankings designed to shame and blame underperforming governments may reinforce illiberal attitudes. Janine Clark and Julie Moreau address the political economy of activism through a case study of an LGBTQ+ sex workers’ rights and donor conference in Kenya. Clark and Moreau examine how the conference has shaped funding for activists and how funding has shaped LGBTQ+ activism.\n\nPapers:\n\nLogics of Queer Justice: Disaggregating Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity\n\nKristopher Velasco, Princeton University\n\nAll movements experience uneven progress and setback – resulting in contradictory policy environments. Consequently, it is important to disaggregate movements to understand and overcome internal contradictions. This is especially true for global efforts to advance LGBT+ rights as countries commonly enact some progressive reforms while maintaining or hardening other discriminatory policies. Why? I argue that although articulated as a single cause, global LGBT+ movements advance distinct dimensions of personhood: sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, sex characteristics, and sexual behaviors. Each dimension, though interrelated, varies in its recognition as a legitimate form of personhood. This variation helps explain contradictory policy environments. Moreover, known transnational pathways for conferring queer recognition (e.g., transnational movements, international norms, human rights treaties), may be more amenable to some dimensions than others. I demonstrate this argument by comparing the adoption of rights based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and homosexual behaviors across 152 countries between 1991 and 2019. Results from seemingly unrelated regressions find that known transnational pathways for recognizing personhood and, thus, securing rights, vary significantly across each dimension. Findings from this study illuminate why contradictory policy environments exist and how strategies to advance one aspect of queer justice may hinder others.\n\nWhy Be Legible?: The Case of Transgender Minorities in India\n\nSiddhartha Baral, University of California, San Diego\n\nWhy would stigmatized minorities seek to be legible to the state, an entity that historically oppressed them? A prominent view within political science suggests that marginalized groups, with strained relationships with the state, aim to avoid being “seen” by it. Yet, understood from a different angle, legibility to the state can also entail recognition from it. For groups facing material and symbolic hardships due to the state’s failure to recognize them, being seen becomes important. Moreover, being legible is often a pre-requisite for accessing state welfare, providing material incentives to want legibility. This paper develops a framework to understand the complex factors influencing stigmatized minorities’ decisions to engage with state legibility initiatives. Through an in-person survey of working class, transgender women in India, I establish how they rationalize their participation in the country’s transgender identification program that comes with the promise of targeted welfare benefits. I analyze how prior interactions with the state impact such individuals’ willingness to join state legibility projects and the motivations driving their involvement. Importantly, I demonstrate that material concerns, above and beyond symbolic identity affirmation, drive such individuals’ pursuit of state-issued documents validating their gender identity.\n\nDo Remittances Increase Support for LGBTQ+ Rights?\n\nCalla Hummel, University of Miami; Sarah Andrea Berens, University of Innsbruck\n\nPeople who have migrated to new countries send billions of dollars in remittances to family members each year. Receiving remittances influences the recipient’s voting, political engagement, and beliefs. Our project asks: do remittances increase the recipient’s support for gender and sexual minority (LGBTQ+) rights? We suggest that they do. We theorize that migrants send social as well as economic remittances to relatives in their home countries and that these remittances include ideas about civil rights. We argue that when people move to a country with robust LGBTQ+ rights, they may change their beliefs about LGBTQ+ people and communicate that change to their relatives. We further argue that when the person sending remittances is out as LGBTQ+, they can have a particularly strong effect on their relatives’ beliefs. We hypothesize that social and economic remittances can travel through several pathways: 1) where migrants tell relatives about rights and protections in the host country, relatives are more likely to support similar rights in the home country; 2) where relatives rely on LGBTQ+ family members’ remittances, they are more likely to accept their identities; 3) where relatives see LGBTQ+ people being successful in another country, they are more likely to support LGBTQ+ rights in the home country. To evaluate the hypotheses, we analyze three sources of data: public opinion data from across Latin America that includes information about remittances and attitudes towards gay rights, interviews with LGBTQ+ people who send remittances to family members, and a set of online survey experiments with Mexican respondents who live in migrant and non-migrant households. We find that people who receive remittances are more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights than people who do not receive remittances.\n\nIlliberalising Maps: Representations of LGBTQ+ Rights and Homonationalism\n\nAlberto Lopez Ortega, VU Amsterdam\n\nThis paper delves into the nuanced implications of how international LGBTQI rights are represented, particularly focusing on the practice of employing maps and rankings by liberal organizations. These visual tools are commonly used to illustrate the progression of LGBTQI legislation across countries, operating under the assumption that they will motivate civil societies to demand advancement in rights and governments to ascend these rankings. However, this research posits that such representations can lead to unintended, and often counterproductive, consequences by essentializing associations between national identities, ethnic outgroups, and LGBTQI rights. The study hypothesizes that in nations where a synthesis of national identity with pro-LGBTQI rights has occurred, these representations might inspire homonationalist attitudes. Such attitudes could manifest as a nativist instrumental increase of support for LGBTQI rights, coupled with an increase in negative affect towards ethnic outgroups, especially nationals from countries portrayed as less liberal. This might also lead to heightened anti-immigration attitudes and the perception that the population of these less liberal countries is less inclusive of LGBTQI individuals. Conversely, in countries without such liberal-national identity alignments, the consequences might be more heterogeneous. While liberal citizens might be encouraged to support LGBTQI rights more fervently, nativist citizens could react adversely, viewing advancements in LGBTQI rights as an affront to their national identity. This paper argues that these reactions are not uniform but vary significantly based on the interplay between individual national identity and perceptions of LGBTQI rights. To investigate these dynamics, the paper employs online vignette experiments conducted on the representative samples of the Netherlands and Turkey. Participants are exposed to different visual representations of LGBTQI rights to assess how these influence their attitudes towards LGBTQI rights, national identity, and ethnic outgroups. The findings elucidate the complex role of rights representations on attitudes, shedding light on how they shape identity perceptions and attitudes towards liberalization. By exploring the dual potential of visual tools to inspire progress or exacerbate negative attitudes, this paper contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the role of identity markers in shaping societal attitudes and public policy. It underscores the need for careful consideration of the broader socio-political context in which such representations are deployed and their potential to influence public opinion in complex and sometimes unintended ways.\n\nThe Political Economy of Transnational Activism: Changing Faces, Changing Spaces\n\nJanine Clark, University of Toronto, Mississauga; Julie Moreau, University of Toronto\n\nEvery other year, the Kenyan organization UHAI-EASHRI gathers over 200 LGBTQ and sex worker activists and funders for the Changes Faces, Changing Spaces (CFCS) conference. UHAI is Africa’s first indigenous fund by and for sex workers and sexual and gender minorities. CFCS is thus a South-led transnational initiative bringing African activists, African donors, and Western donors together. The literature on transnational activism has documented the importance of spaces like CFCS for building and sustaining movements and using them to develop momentum for policy change at the national level (Alvarez 2000). Within queer development studies, scholars have focused on the power dynamics that undergird North-South dynamics, especially around access to resources (Gosine 2018). Despite the growing number of transnational initiatives arising from the Global South, the literature has not adequately theorized the intersection of transnational activist spaces and the development industry. This paper seeks to fill this lacuna by examining CFCS’s role in the political economy of funding. We ask: 1) what is the impact of CFCS upon the relationships between donors and activists? 2) To what extent has CFCS allowed other Southern funders to emerge? 3) How has CFCS affected the types of funding available to African organizations? Answers to these questions will contribute to interdisciplinary conversations around LGBTQ and sex worker rights, development, and South-South collaborations.\n\nFriday, September 6, 2:00pm – 3:30pm\n\nFull Paper Panel\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Chair) Beth A. Simmons, University of Pennsylvania\n\n(Discussant) Phillip M. Ayoub, University College London\n\nSession Description:\n\nThis panel brings together a diverse group of scholars that study the politics of sexual minorities in a comparative and international relations perspective. Each study employs innovative methodologies and novel data to offer insights into the intricate dynamics of resistance, exploring the role of authoritarian regimes, the electability challenges faced by minority candidates, the influence of conservative NGOs in international organizations, and the global scenario of repression against sexual minorities.\n\nPapers:\n\n“Let Them Play My Game”: The Authoritarian Paternalistic Referee in Singapore\n\nNancy Tang, Princeton University\n\nIn the absence of interest group competition facilitated by multi-party democratic systems, how do authoritarian regimes resolve the challenges of pluralism, including movement-countermovement rivalry over contentious social issues? This article theorizes that authoritarian states can adopt a “paternalistic referee” role, a form of nonviolent, immaterial control distinct from strategies like repression and co-optation (Hassan et al. 2021). Examining Singapore’s 2022 repeal of Penal Code Section 377A (criminalization of male homosexuality) based on activist interviews, parliamentary speeches and media reports, I analyze both the “referee” and the “paternalistic” aspects of the role. First, unlike repression or co-optation, the authoritarian referee does not outright choose “winners” or “losers” on specific contentious social issues. Rather, the autocrat-as-referee assumes an appearance of neutrality. Second, a paternalistic referee defines the “rules of the game” (mobilization boundaries) for contention participants, and sets the “programming” (time, venue, and agenda) for arbitrating contention outcomes. Assuming the paternalistic referee role allows autocrats to project a democratic façade and mimic the conflict-resolution mechanisms facilitated by democratic party system yet maintain control. Building on “pragmatic resistance” (Chua 2014), I further posit that social movements are agentic players within the paternalistic referee framework: societal actors (e.g. movements) develop nuanced strategies to navigate the refereed landscape, thereby competing to shape policy outcomes. I also consider future research directions, including disaggregating the referee state into groups of non-unitary actors.\n\nMinority Candidates and the Electability Curse\n\nGabriele Magni, Loyola Marymount University\n\nDiscussions around electability are central in election campaigns, and often target women and minority candidates. This project examines three related questions: What shapes perceptions of electability? Why do electability concerns mostly affect minority candidates? And how can we contrast such concerns? To answer, I focus on LGBTQ+ candidates, a good test to examine electability given the relative scarcity of LGBTQ+ elected officials, the persisting prejudice against sexual minorities, and the lack of concentrated “natural” constituencies. I rely on three original datasets: the largest survey to date of LGBTQ+ candidates, which includes about 500 candidates who ran for office in the USA between 2018-2022; and two voter surveys, each conducted with a sample of about 2,000 American likely voters, where I embedded conjoint and priming experiments. I show that several factors fuel electability concerns among voters: first, the belief that the electorate will not support minority candidates because of prejudice; second, voters’ own prejudice, which spurs electability concerns as a way to provide a more acceptable justification to one’s opposition to minority candidates; third, the scarcity of past successful examples of minority candidates. I also explain that these concerns can be contrasted by correcting voters’ misperceptions, inasmuch as voters tend to overestimate the level of negative bias in the electorate. Providing accurate information on the level of societal support for minority rights and candidates successfully reduces electability concerns.\n\nNGOs as Norm Obstructers: The Politics of Conservative NGOs in IOs\n\nMaría-José Urzúa, Princeton University\n\nIn recent years, there has been a drastic rise in the participation of conservative NGOs, advocating against sexual and reproductive rights, in international organizations (IOs). This paper analyzes this phenomenon and challenges the conventional understanding of NGOs’ involvement in IOs, contending that NGOs may collaborate with international institutions not to stimulate global mobilization for domestic change, but rather to obstruct international decisions and actions. The paper introduces the concepts of “IO’s obstruction”, defined as the attempts by NGOs to block an IO from adopting unwanted decisions regarding normative issues, by changing the cost of doing so for states and/or international civil servants; and “norm obstructers”, or NGOs opposing the adoption of “standards for the appropriate behavior of states” (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, p. 893), which exist in opposition to norm entrepreneurs. This paper suggests that NGOs opt for obstruction as an international strategy under two primary conditions. First, when they lack a favorable political opportunity structure and are unable to influence sufficient states or international civil servants to adopt decisions aligned with their normative views. Second, when NGOs prefer a low-engagement strategy with international institutions. To test this theoretical framework, the paper examines the case of the Organization of American States (OAS), which has adopted progressive decisions on sexual and reproductive rights and has seen a sharp increase in the participation of conservative NGOs, seeking to obstruct the organization. The empirical methods employed in this paper are elite interviews, archival research of OAS documents, and participant observation of the 2023 General Assembly and parallel internal meetings of LGBT+ organizations.\n\nBeyond Rhetoric: A Dataset on Global LGBT Rights Violations\n\nGino Pauselli, Princeton University\n\nWhat are the levels of repression against LGBT people around the world? Which countries have witnessed either an improvement or a deterioration in the living conditions of sexual minorities? Are there diverse practices indicating heterogeneity in the treatment of sexual minorities? While current available data allows scholars to study changes in de jure rights and societal attitudes towards LGBT rights, we are still missing an essential piece of the puzzle: de facto enjoyment of rights. This study addresses a critical gap in our understanding of repression against the LGBT community globally by introducing the first comprehensive dataset on rights violations against sexual minorities. Leveraging text analysis techniques, this research systematically quantifies rights violations by extracting information from the US Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. This dataset offers a country-year level measure of repression against sexual minorities. The data will allow researchers to address multiple questions surrounding the efficacy of policies designed to ameliorate the conditions of sexual minorities.\n\nKnow Your Rights: Legal Knowledge and the Pursuit of LGBT Litigation in Africa\n\nSean Givnish, George Washington University\n\nThis research questions why LGBT social movements in Africa choose to legally mobilize and make civil rights claims in court. The well-documented political homophobia across Africa presents a hard tactical choice to LGBT-focused organizations: keep a low profile, focusing on socially appropriate issues such as public health work, or make themselves visible to combat anti-LGBT policies and rhetoric through the legal system. I argue that domestic LGBT organizations in Africa are more likely to engage in strategic litigation if they are made up of individuals who have been educated in a human rights-based understanding of LGBT issues. This education in rights comes from exposure to Western discourse, including a) experience in HIV/AIDS-related activism, which began to use a rights-based approach decades earlier and helped to give rise to the LGBT movement in Africa, or b) formal legal education that, as a result of colonialism in Africa, is based heavily on Western law. Knowledge of rights-based claims increases efficacy in the ability of courts to address LGBT rights violations, therefore making the visibility of engaging in litigation worthwhile. Through case studies of two LGBT organizations engaging in strategic litigation in Africa, the Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals of Botswana (LEGABIBO) and the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission in Kenya (NGLHRC), I show how individuals within these organizations gained experience in rights-based claims prior to joining, and how this understanding influenced their decisions to pursue litigation. This research aims to contribute to knowledge about how sexual and gender minority movements in the Global South pursue their own rights, pushing back against the notion that Western donors to their cause oversee their agendas; these movements in the South are influenced by the West, but in a manner that encourages individual learning and application to their own contexts. In a broader sense, this research also aims to contribute to the literature on the use of “pro-democratic judicial lawfare,” a strategy by civil society actors to challenge autocratic decisions by their governments (Gloppen et al., 2023). The use of strategic litigation by LGBT organizations in Africa to contest homophobic actions by their governments, which have been successful, is a way that minority groups who have been left out of the political process previously can utilize the judiciary to renovate their rights. This exhibits that there are still viable avenues for the protection of minority rights in democracies, despite the regional and global trends of democratic retrenchment.\n\nSaturday, September 7, 8:00am – 9:30am\n\nCreated Panel\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Discussant) Laura Sjoberg, Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nSession Description:\n\nThis panel explores how LGBTQ identity is expressed and politicized.\n\nPapers:\n\nFertility, Farming, and Femmes: Exogenous Hormone Regulation\n\nZein Murib, Fordham University-Lincoln Center\n\nDespite recent commentary and research on sex and gender, and although transgender people are not the only individuals who use exogenous hormones to thrive, there is to date no academic scholarship or public writing that devotes sustained attention to examining how and to what effect the policies that regulate the use of exogenous hormones reflect and shape how people understand gender. This paper enters these conversations by presenting the first critical analysis of the policies that regulate exogenous hormones in the United States. More specifically, this paper asks 1) how policies that regulate exogenous hormones shape prevailing understandings of gender and 2) the extent to which these policies create conditions of precarity for some members of the polity while also elevating the status of others. To answer these questions, this paper focuses on three sites where identical exogenous hormones are commonly used, but subject to regulation that vary solely with respect who uses them: 1) fertility treatments, 2) factory farming, and 3) hormone replacement therapy. Although these three cases all concern the use of estrogen and testosterone/androgen, the policies regulating them vary widely, from almost no rules, as is the case in fertility treatments, to classification as a controlled substance, as is the case for prescription testosterone. These differences raise questions about how, why, and to what effect identical chemical compounds are subject to diverging sets of regulations.\n\nQueer Publicity, Homophobia, and Sectarianism in Post-transition Lebanon\n\nOmar Safadi, University of Chicago\n\nIn June of 2022, the public display of queer political symbols and the online circulation of advertisements for gay Pride Month in Lebanon mobilized an array of political, institutional, and popular actors in inter-sectarian and anti-gay political action. Happening just one month after the historic electoral wins of anti-sectarian MPs, both events held the promise of democratic transition, renewed queer visibility, and queer activism in Lebanon. Articulating homosexuality as a violation to religiously-defined “nature,” homophobic actors framed queer publicity as a violation to laws protecting religious pluralism, a threat to inter-sectarian coexistence, and a danger to Lebanon’s postwar civil peace. In a move later deemed unconstitutional by the Lebanese Court of Cassation, the Interior Ministry released a memo banning all homosexual (sexual deviancy) gatherings and assemblies in the name of the “heavenly religions,” “customs and traditions,” and the secular public order. Also sparked was a host of anti-gay mobilizations, ad campaigns and policy initiatives across sect and class. Interestingly, homophobia neither generated – nor aimed to generate – national solidarity around a common enemy. Rather, it incited modes of identification and action that reinforced particular communal symbols and causes. Taking this observation as its starting point, this paper asks the following questions: how is queer sexuality articulated as a specific violation to institutionalized religious pluralism? And what does that articulation reveal about the heterosexual structures and foundations of Lebanon’s sectarian political order? What new modes of political action and identification does homophobia incite? Finally, and in the wake of a “failed” revolution, what can the case of homophobia in Lebanon tell us about how citizens get divested from political alternatives and re-invested in crisis-ridden and defunct political regimes? By politicizing homosexual publicity as a symbolic violation to “all religions and sects,” sectarian actors simultaneously politicized heterosexual “nature” as a popular, cross-sectarian, and absolute source of political authority. In doing so, they invested heterosexuality with the status of an absolute symbol in political sectarianism, one whose inviolable authority is maintained by the sectarian plurality that holds it. Ultimately, and by politicizing heterosexuality as an absolute-in-common, I argue that homophobia reproduces sectarian differences and relates them in and against a global age.\n\nThe Politics of New Prides\n\nEdward F. Kammerer, Idaho State University\n\nLGBT Pride Events have been held in cities across the country since 1970. New Pride events continue to be formed, often in smaller communities further from urban centers. This project uses semi-structured interviews with organizers from smaller, newer Pride events from across the country to explore why these events are being formed and how these events relate to LGBTQ politics. By focusing on these newer events, this project seeks to show how LGBT Pride and the politics associated with it, remain relevant.\n\nSomewhere over the Rainbow: How Economics Shape the Mobility of Queer Americans\n\nAngela Kothe, Cornell University\n\nIn the United States, same-sex couples’ parental rights are legally linked to their marital status. Prior to Obergefell v. Hodges, same-sex couples were not guaranteed the legal rights to their children that opposite-sex couples enjoyed. The link between marriage and parental rights meant that this disparity was especially significant in states where same-sex marriage was banned. This paper builds on existing evidence that same-sex couples see challenges to their parental rights as a threat rather than an inconvenience. I theorize that parents in same-sex relationships will migrate when states ban same-sex marriage with the caveat that these families’ ability to remove themselves from hostile legal environments is limited by economic conditions. I test this theory using panel data of American states from 1999–2020. The analysis reveals that when the unemployment rate increases in states with same-sex marriage bans same-sex couples and their children are less likely to migrate compared to families living in states without bans. Parents in same-sex relationships are also less likely to migrate compared to parents in opposite-sex relationships when unemployment increases in states with same-sex marriage bans. These results demonstrate that parents in same-sex relationships do migrate in response to hostile legal measures, but their ability to do so is limited by economic conditions.\n\nSaturday, September 7, 12:00pm – 1:30pm\n\nFull Paper Panel\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Chair) Erica Marat, National Defense University\n\n(Discussant) Momin Rahman, Trent University\n\nSession Description:\n\nPolitical homophobia is a global phenomenon. From the Russian government’s deployment of “traditional values” to squash political opposition in civil society to Argentine President Javier Milei’s campaign promise to shut down the National Institute Against Discrimination, politicians routinely stoke homophobia and moral panic to justify repression and exclusionary policies, and appeal to voters. In other words, political homophobia is entangled with forms of both authoritarian and democratic governance, occupying the intersection of formal exclusion and popular prejudice. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) scholarship outside of the United States and North America underscores the importance of the entanglement of nationalism and homophobia, often expressed as anti-colonial or anti-Western resistance at the heart of the intersection. This panel seeks to uncover the mechanisms of political homophobia as well as forms of innovative resistance from contexts outside Euro-America. How does political homophobia intersect with colonial and decolonial discourse? How does the relationship between electoral politics, homophobia and LGBTQ resistance play out in what Cricket Keating calls “authoritarian-leaning democracies”? How do these insights challenge existing literature on the sanguine connection between democratization and LGBTQ politics?\n\nThe papers bring rich empirical data to bear on these essential questions, employing a variety of methods from survey experimentation to ethnographic observation. O’Dweyer, Rosenberg and Stenberg explore the electoral impact of “LGBT-free zones” in Poland, contributing to the establishment of the specific consequences of political homophobia. This paper fills the gap in the literature regarding how and under what conditions political homophobia is electorally useful for politicians. Ayoub and Harris tackle the tricky issue of outcomes in social movement research by testing the efficacy of different framing choices, directly comparing competing options for countering homophobia in Zimbabwe. What is the best way to address the confluence of nationalism and homophobia? The paper moves beyond identification of different LGBTQ rights frames to assess their relative efficacy, providing actionable insights for scholars and activists alike. Moreau problematizes the connection between democratic governance and improvements in wellbeing for LGBTQ people by applying a biopolitical lens to LGBTQ inclusion. Bringing together the social movement literature on strategic identity work and queer theory, she explores two specific examples of the use of identity to resist the embodied effects of homophobia, both of which incorporate transnational discourses of human rights and what Ayoub and Harris call “locally rooted” messaging. Finally, Keating examines the tensions of coalition building between LGBTQ and other social movements in moments of political turbulence. Such cross-movement coalition building can prove extremely efficacious, precipitating the resignation of corrupt politicians, but also extremely risky, leading to intense repression. Keating’s study contributes to existing social movement literature on coalition building and repression, and feminist scholarship on the limitations of solidarity and the tensions between the politics of representation and redistribution negotiated within multi-issue coalitions.\n\nPapers:\n\nRaces at the Bottom: Local Impacts of Official Discrimination on Elections\n\nConor O’Dwyer, University of Florida; Andrew S. Rosenberg, University of Florida; Matthew Stenberg, University of California, Berkeley\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, over a hundred Polish subnational governments–regional, district, and municipal–established so-called “LGBT Free Zones.” The zones, while largely symbolic, constituted official government policies that openly discriminated against LGBTQ+ individuals, fostering a general climate of hostility. At the same time, these zones garnered significant international backlash, including sanctions from the EU targeted at the implementing governments. These policies were largely pushed by the then-ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), and its allies as part of a broader electoral and political strategy. This paper analyzes the impact of these policies on PiS’ local election outcomes to examine the efficacy of this partisan strategy. We will analyze the results of the upcoming spring 2024 municipal elections, which will include 2,477 Polish local governments. These elections, the first since the zones’ implementation, present a unique opportunity to explore critical questions in democratic studies: the interplay between minority rights and electoral competition; the role of local governments in either challenging or reinforcing democratic backsliding; and the effectiveness of international interventions in protecting minority rights from local-level threats.\n\nTesting the Effectiveness of Frames Combatting Homophobia in Zimbabwe\n\nPhillip M. Ayoub, University College London; Adam Harris, University College London\n\nIn a recent political wave that has been emulated across many African states, state-sponsored homo- and transphobia is being entrenched via draconian laws. Social movements in these regions grapple with countering these state-driven initiatives and altering ingrained anti-LGBTQ sentiments within populations often lacking exposure to LGBTQ ideas and people. Emulating strategies from other movements, local activists in Zimbabwe have crafted culturally rooted messages affirming the indigenous identity of queer individuals to challenge narratives propagated by influential figures and conservative movements, claiming homosexuality as un-African and foreign. Collaborating with Zimbabwean LGBTQ activists, this paper explores the effectiveness of two main types of locally-rooted messaging through a survey experiment in a context marked by notably high levels of homo- and transphobia on a global scale. This is the first study to test systematically such narratives with this method in the African region. We find that an indigenous message reduces prejudice toward LGBTQ neighbors and that a liberation message increases support for LGBTQ equal rights. These findings are important as they provide empirical support for effective ways to combat anti-LGBTQ sentiments in contexts challenging for queer liberation.\n\nThe Biopolitics of Identity Work: LGBTQ Activism in Argentina and South Africa\n\nJulie Moreau, University of Toronto\n\nIn October 2011, a dozen members of the South African black lesbian organization Free Gender protested police inaction in the murder case of a young lesbian, Nontsikelelo Tyatyeka. Despite the confrontational tactic, the group highlighted lesbian belonging to multiple communities, including the local black African community. The same year in Argentina, the lesbian organization La Fulana held a major public even following the murder of fellow lesbian, Natalia Gaitán. La Fulana presented activists’ embodied lesbian visibility at the event as a vital way to oppose deadly violence. Scholarship on strategic identity work has focused on how organizations strategize a single identity (e.g. sexuality), emphasizing the “sameness” or “difference” from the majority (Einwohner, Reger and Myers 2008). Recent queer scholarship insists on the biopolitical construction of sexuality in tandem with race, class, and gender, but tends to be skeptical about the use of identity to achieve social change. This paper incorporates a biopolitical perspective into the literature on identity work to capture the way the intersection of race/class/gender/sexual identities form requirements for entry into the nation, the stakes of which are exposure to violence and death (Alexander 1994). Based on over two years of participant-observation with Free Gender in Cape Town and La Fulana in Buenos Aires and more than 160 in-depth interviews, I argue that LGBTQ activists manipulate multiple identities to produce new forms of relationality that extend past the bounds of citizenship. This research has implications for future work on identity strategizing and accounts of queer resistance.\n\nCoalition and Contention: LGBTQ Struggles in Sri Lanka’s Aragalaya Protests\n\nChristine (Cricket) Keating, University of Washington\n\nIn 2022, Sri Lankans came together in one of the largest and most coalitional protests in its history. These protests, which became known as the Aragalaya (the Struggle), began in response to a political and economic crisis that had been deepening in the country since 2019. Marked by severe inflation which sent food prices skyrocketing and a critical shortage of fuel, medicine, cooking gas, and other essential goods, the protesters attributed the drastic economic downturn to the government’s corruption, incompetence, and fiscal mismanagement and demanded the resignation of then-President of Sri Lanka, Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The Aragalaya protests drew participants from across Sri Lanka’s societal spectrum, including the LGBTQIA+ community, who were a vital presence in the protest camp as well as in rallies and marches, with many commenters pointing to this participation as an indication of the Aragalaya’s openness and inclusivity. In the wake of the protests, however, the government has severely cracked down on the struggle, targeting protesters for prosecution and curtailing public demonstrations. In the face of this government crackdown, there has been a fierce internal debate about the relationship of LGBTQIA+ struggles with broader fights for economic and ethnic minority justice, with some arguing that these struggles are deeply interconnected, and others holding that such linkages jeopardize the specific legislative objectives of the Sri Lankan LGBTQIA+ movement. This essay explores ways in which LGBTQIA+ activists in Sri Lanka have sought to build solidarities across differences both within the Aragalaya and in its aftermath. How might these interventions point to LGBTQIA+ politics that can address the complexity of coalition-building in authoritarian-leaning democracies?\n\nDueling Rights: Protection of the Family at the UN Human Rights Council\n\nMichael Joel Voss, University of Toledo\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council, which is the primary discursive body for human rights at the UN, is a critical arena in the global polarization of human rights. States, NGOs, and other stakeholders attempt to pass resolutions at the Council, which may eventually become international law. Dueling rights examines how competing stakeholders attempt to advance their conceptions of human rights while also undermining their opponents’ proposals for human rights protections. This paper builds on a theoretical and empirical foundation of dueling rights at the UN Human Rights Council and serves as a chapter in a larger work on competing human rights strategies at the UN. Specifically, this paper examines the creation of “the protection of the family” initiative by an alliance of like-minded, religiously conservative states, led by Egypt. Protection of the Family works in opposition to protections provided to individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), which have recently seen successes through a series of resolutions and a special rapporteur at the Council, led predominately by Latin American states. Dueling rights helps advance research on norms, particularly norm dynamics and norm contestation by showing how stakeholders attempt to use norms to advance their own human rights agenda(s). Further, this work helps advance research on international law and international organizations by offering a case study on how public policy processes and institutional design shape human rights. Dueling rights uses process tracing including interviews with stakeholders in Geneva, Switzerland, where the Council is located, archival research, and participant observation of formal Human Rights Council meetings and informal observations of “side events” held during official meetings of the Council in order to capture the strategies used by “family” advocates and how these strategies respond to or shape opposition tactics. This paper finds that “family” advocates are using a multi-prong strategy at the Council. The first tactic is to undermine SOGI resolutions by arguing that these resolutions lack international legal standing. The second strategy aims at weakening the language of SOGI resolutions. The third strategy aims are undermining the efforts of the special rapporteur, and the final strategy attempts to undercut support for SOGI rights, particularly by Latin America states, who are overwhelmingly Catholic and cannot politically come out in opposition to “the family.” This multi-pronged approach seeks to undermine SOGI normative and legal standing while reinforcing the central role of “the family” in international human rights law. This paper is unique in norm advocacy research and international law scholarship because the central focus is on actors that are promoting a version of human rights which is generally viewed by human rights defenders as “regressive.”\n\nSaturday, September 7, 2:00pm – 3:30pm\n\nCreated Panel\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Chair) Andrew Thomas Proctor, University of Chicago\n\nSession Description:\n\nThe papers in this panel outline the various ways in which groups, movements and other actors have organized and sometimes succeeded in rolling back LGBT rights.\n\nPapers:\n\nHumanitarian NGOs, Homocolonialism and the Global Recession of LGBTQIA+ Rights\n\nJana Foxe, University of Washington\n\nWhen humanitarian NGOs speak publicly on LGBTQIA+ issues, what do they say, and who do they represent? In the paper, I explore the involvement of humanitarian NGOs in LGBTQIA+ discourse. Specifically, given its cultural and religious sensitivity, might the salience NGOs attach to this subject depend on the countries where they operate abroad, or should they reflect domestic human rights imperatives? Using the websites of 200 aid-distributing NGOs, I analyze whether and how NGOs make demands for rights for gender non-conforming and transgender persons, or if text is predominantly oriented around sexuality. This paper empirically evaluates the critique that the norm of LGBT-rights-as-human rights reflects cultural imperialism because it imposes Western cultural norms. The role of Western NGOs as promoters of LGBTQIA rights is disputed as insufficient or surface-level engagement relative to the needs of the LGBTQIA+ community in aid-recipient states (Velasco 2018; Brown 2023) or critiqued as ‘homocolonialist’ (Rahman 2014; Delatolla 2020). Homocolonialism constitutes the promotion of queer rights through a Western frame, thus promoting Western exceptionalism, or prescribing acceptable expressions of sexual and gendered behavior according to Western norms (Rahman, 2014). States may also be sanctioned or otherwise penalized or shamed by international donors for violations of LGBTQIA+ rights, illustrating how expectations around human rights constitute an influential form of both soft and hard power, impacting the lives of LGBTQIA+ people, influencing the rights they are awarded (Kollman and Waites, 2009). Rahman (2020) argues explicitly that homocolonalism constitutes a dilemma for LGBTQIA+ rights, “by potentially replaying the neo-colonialism of Western politics in adopting Western understandings of sexuality for international rights.” Other scholars have argued that the applications of LGBT-rights-as-human-rights discourse has even provoked backlash in the Global South (Long, 2005). Given these effects, I argue that there are also clear implications for humanitarian NGO advocacy work on human rights. Since humanitarian NGOs are largely Western in origin, they may reproduce a universalist interpretation of sexual and gender diversity, one which may reinforce Western standards and norms, emphasizing issues that are likely to affect the most beneficiaries, which usually center around rights for gay and lesbian persons, e.g. decriminalizing homosexuality and recognition of same-sex partnerships. Additionally, the political context of many major donor states is important. Many donor states where NGOs originate, such as the US and UK, have progressed legislation targeting transgender and gender non-conforming people, at least more than targeting sexual minorities. Backsliding in rights for LGBTQIA+ people in many-aid recipient states may also be a further impetus to reduce, or minimize, advocacy for LGBTQIA+ rights, and in extreme cases such as proposed legislation in Ghana, outlaw any such advocacy (Human Rights Watch, 2023). Yet there are also instrumental implications. If an NGO is operating in a country where LGBTQIA+ identity is being increasingly monitored and/or criminalized, we may expect that it may elect not to focus on LGBTQIA+ issues, for fear that authorities could interfere with the NGO’s aid distribution operations, or other human rights advocacy. Given these conflicting pressures, under what conditions do humanitarian NGOs make demands for LGBTQIA+ rights? First, I hypothesize that NGOs will be less likely to make demands for LGBTQIA+ rights if they operate in countries that have criminalized aspects of LGBTQIA+ identity, due to concerns over how this work may impact their operations regarding the distribution of aid. Second, I consider whether sexuality or gender identity are most commonly referenced, hypothesizing that demands NGOs make on behalf of sexual minorities will take precedent over issues related to transgender and gender non-conforming persons. Third, I hypothesize that probability of demands for LGBTQIA+ rights will be moderated by the faith orientation of a given NGO. I will collect data collection by scraping the websites of the 200 largest humanitarian NGOs with global operations (i.e. the NGO is not constrained to recipient states from any given region or continent). I will collect information on, countries and regions in which the NGO has operations, annual revenue (USD millions), the religious background (if any) of a given NGO, which correspond to website excerpts gleaned using key terms relating to differing frames of LGBTQIA+ rights, facilitating statistical tests.\n\nChristian Nationalism, Racial Attitudes, and Opposition to Transgender Rights\n\nLaura P. Moyer, University of Louisville; Anne I. Caldwell, University of Louisville\n\nIn the first six months of 2023, state legislators across the country filed more than 400 bills targeting transgender individuals – double the number from the previous year (Shin, Kirkpatrick, and Branigin 2023). In the 2022-23 period, anti-trans legislation was often identified by conservative interest groups, candidates, and legislators as part of a broader “anti-woke” legislative agenda that included proposals to limit the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT). At the same time, a 2023 national survey by PRRI found that most Republicans either holds Christian nationalist ideas or are sympathetic to those views. The PRRI survey also found that Christian nationalism beliefs are correlated with anti-black, anti-immigrant, and anti-Muslim racism, as well as to patriarchal views of gender roles. We argue that these phenomena are interrelated in ways that help us understand attitudes toward transgender people and anti-trans policies. Although extant research has found evidence that those with Christian nationalist beliefs are less likely to support same-sex marriage and LGBT political candidates (Whitehead and Perry 2020; Cravens 2023), we know less about how anti-LGBT beliefs may be activated by attitudes toward other groups. We posit that contemporary political rhetoric by political elites about “anti-woke” policies and CRT activate a more generalized outgroup prejudice among those who hold Christian nationalist views. For instance, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has successfully pushed for anti-CRT legislation (Stop W.O.K.E Act of 2022) and restrictions on gender-affirming medical care for children (SB 254) has called on “people all over the country to be willing to put on that full armor of God, to stand firm against the left’s schemes” in a 2022 CPAC speech (Ceballos 2022). Historical accounts show linkages between White resistance to desegregation, organizing efforts against gay rights and the Equal Rights Amendment, and the emergence of the Christian Right in the 1970s (Maxwell and Shields 2019; Frank 2013) that are useful analogs for understanding the nexus between Christian Nationalism, white supremacy views, and attitudes about gender and sexuality. Across these issues is a concern with family structure, parenting, and children (Self 2012) that has re-emerged in the discourse surrounding trans rights (e.g., Snow 2023; Waters 2023). In this paper, we investigate whether sentiment about racial outgroups triggers a stronger reaction to another outgroup, transgender Americans. Using a nationally representative survey fielded in spring 2023, we assess how racial identity and outgroup prejudice interact with Christian nationalism beliefs to affect attitudes toward transgender people and policies targeting the medical care of transgender children.\n\nUnpacking the Backlash against LGBTQ+ Rights in the United States\n\nEllen Ann Andersen, University of Vermont\n\nIn this paper, I draw on two bodies of scholarship—the literature on moral panics and the literature on citizenship—to consider the current deluge of bills, laws, and policies targeting LGBTQ+ people in the United States. More than 500 bills targeting LGBTQ+ people were introduced across 46 state legislatures in 2023; by the end of the year, 75 had been signed into law across 22 states. 2024 promises more of the same: by the middle of January, the ACLU was tracking 285 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced across 35 states. The great majority of these bills, laws and policies attack trans and nonbinary people, especially youth, commonly through prohibitions on gender-affirming health care, school sports participation, and bathroom use. Other measures, both proposed and enacted, are aimed at limiting the ability of students to learn about and/or express non-normative sexualities and gender identities. The Movement Advancement Project, which tracks LGBTQ+ policies, calls the current political environment “a war against LGBTQ+ people in America and their very right and ability to openly exist.” I argue that the current backlash against LGBTQ+ people is a paradigmatic example of a moral panic. Moral panics are moments in time when public fears—and state interventions—about a “new” threat to societal values greats exceeds any object threat posed by the individuals or groups who are treated as creating the threat. Moral panics share several key elements, including the existence of moral entrepreneurs who seek to shape public opinion and influence policy by framing an issue in hyperbolic moral terms; the creation of folk devils who are treated as the embodiment of evil; media amplification of the narratives created by moral entrepreneurs; and political actors who draw on those narrative to justify criminalizing or otherwise restricting the rights of folk devils. Central to the concept of moral panics is that the creation of a folk devil is mutually advantageous to moral entrepreneurs, media actors, and state officials. Drawing on analyses of legislative bills, public statements made by states legislators, media coverage, and the messaging developed by anti LGBTQ+ activist groups, I show how the current backlash is the product of a deliberate effort by countermovement actors to instigate and stoke a moral panic, an effort adopted and advanced by right-leaning media sources and predominantly Republican legislators and public officials. I then draw on the literature on queer citizenship to argue that the current political moment is usefully conceptualized as a debate over the civic status of LGBTQ+ Americans. Drawing in particular on the work of Stephen Engel and Shane Phelan, I argue that citizenship is more than a legal status or an accumulation of rights, it is a claim on the public’s attention and concern, a claim that necessitates that members of the polity recognize the claimant as a legitimate member of the polity. From this perspective, the current backlash against LGBTQ+ people—and particularly transgender people—is fundamentally an argument about whether they should be recognized as legitimate members of the polity. Bringing the two literatures together, I conclude by suggesting that some moral panics—perhaps many—are at their heart, arguments over civic status.\n\nTransnational Transphobias: Anti-trans Advocacy Coalitions\n\nMary McLoughlin, Syracuse University\n\nAcross the globe, actors, and interest groups from conservative and traditionalist Right-leaning movements and Left-leaning feminist and gender-critical movements are organizing transnationally to erode trans rights. Where right wing anti-gender movements perceive trans rights as an unwelcome threat to traditional gender roles and the patriarchal norms they seek to protect, the increasingly active pocket of anti-trans feminists see trans rights as extensions of the patriarchal norms they seek to bring down. Despite their fundamentally opposing views on what a woman’s sex should mean for her place in the social order, both anti-trans and traditionalists and feminists are allied in their rejection of gender-based rights in favor of sex-based rights. This project takes up the question of how these ideologically diverse groups appropriate sex-based rights discourses and shared anti-trans frameworks to advance contradictory political projects. Through discursive analysis of mission statements and advocacy materials from anti-trans feminist and traditionalist organizations, this project reorients the direction of norm diffusion and relocates normative contestation from the end of the norm life-cycle and argues that the presence of competing anti-trans frameworks within these transnational advocacy networks (TANs) and the ensuing normative contestation generates new anti-rights languages and norms. Though anti-trans norms—and specifically the regimes of cisnormativity— revolve around the primacy of sex-based recognition and thus may often be tied to specific policies and legally formalized, anti-trans norms are not subsumed by policy. I find that the true ideological and socially transformative content of norms lies in the normative justification of why these policies matter and to what end and is therefore linked to informal and non-state practices.\n\nAutocratization and Transgender Rights\n\nMyles Williamson, University of Alabama; Amanda B. Edgell, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa\n\nDespite the emergence of transgender rights discourse, recent years have seen a global anti-trans wave. Several prominent right-wing populists have specifically targeted transgender rights through their rhetoric and policies. For example, on the International Trans Day of Visibility in 2020, Viktor Orban’s Fidesz-controlled parliament introduced legislation banning legal gender marker changes for transgender individuals in Hungary. In the United States. the Trump Administration rolled back anti-discrimination protections for transgender individuals to access housing, healthcare, and education. This anti-trans wave overlaps with a wave of autocratization. How does autocratization affect a country’s protection of transgender rights? Previous research has yet to examine the intersection of regime transformation and transgender rights despite the increasing scholarly attention being devoted to these topics separately. Research on autocratization – or moves toward autocracy along the democratic-autocratic continuum – tends to focus more heavily on its causes rather than its consequences. When studies examine its impact on rights, the scope is often limited to issues such as physical integrity or women’s rights. Empirical work on transgender rights also remains limited, as “LGBT” scholarship traditionally focuses exclusively on sexual orientation minorities. In this paper, we assess the relationship between autocratization and transgender rights using theory-building nested analysis. Drawing on original data tracking transgender rights from the Transgender Rights Indicator Project (TRIP) and the Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) dataset from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Project, we quantitatively test the correlation between autocratization and transgender rights in 173 countries from 2000 to 2021. Contrary to expectations, we find that transgender rights tend to improve during episodes of autocratization for the years covered in our analysis. To understand this unexpected result, we qualitatively investigate several prominent off-the-line cases of democratic backsliding, including Bolivia, Brazil, India, Slovenia, and the United States. Through these cases, we uncover several potential causal mechanisms to explain why autocratization, even when characterized by anti-trans rhetoric, is associated with improvements in transgender rights. Thus, the paper contributes to the literature by providing a more nuanced understanding of the consequences of autocratization, especially for highly marginalized groups like the transgender community.\n\nSaturday, September 7, 1:30pm – 2:00pm\n\nPoster Session\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Discussant) Laura Sjoberg, Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nSession Description:\n\nThese papers are part of the poster session for the Sexuality and Politics Division.\n\nPosters:\n\nDo We Need More LGBTQ Politicians? Evidence from the Mental Cost of Hate Crime\n\nPeiyuan Li, University of Colorado Boulder\n\nExposure to specific negative information has an impact on mental health, particularly affecting minority groups in relatively vulnerable social positions. This study delves into the correlation between exposure to hate crimes against LGBTQ individuals and the mental health of the LGBTQ community. Our methodology involves utilizing the FBI’s Hate Crime Statistics Program (HCSP) to quantify occurrences of hate crimes against LGBTQ individuals. The HCSP compiles data on hate crimes motivated by biases related to race or ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. It encompasses crimes reported to the police that, upon investigation, provide sufficient evidence to be classified as hate crimes. Subsequently, we utilize data from The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to assess the mental well-being of the LGBTQ community. The BRFSS dataset offers the advantage of enabling us to distinguish between LGBTQ and cis-family groups, allowing for a comparative analysis of their mental health conditions. Comparing the mental health outcomes of those in a same-sex household (SSH, who will be more likely to be sexual minorities) and those of different-sex households (DSH), we found that the SSH individuals are more sensitive to the negative impact from the hate crime happenings. When hate crime happenings increase by one percent, the SSH individuals are TWICE more likely to witness mental issues (extensive margin) and TWICE the length of happening of mental issues (intensive margin). In addition, we extend the model to see the impacts of different levels of hate crime happenings. The results show that as the number of hate crimes increases, the negative impact among SSH individuals increases more substantially. In the second section, we switch our attention to investigate if having a LGBTQ politician can mitigate the negative impact from hate crime. We merge our data with the LGBTQ politician information we collected from Wikipedia. We extend the model to incorporate the status of having a LGBTQ leader and its party affiliation (Republican/Democratic). We first show that, with the control of previous LGBTQ politicians in the given state, having an LGBTQ leader will significantly mitigate the negative impacts of hate crime on mental health, outcomes including the probability of having mental issues, probability of having extreme mental issues and the length of having mental issues. Having a democratic politician in office will significantly mitigate impacts on both individuals while having more impacts among SSH individuals. For SSH individuals, an additional democratic politician currently in office will decrease the probability of having mental issue by 0.48 percent (0.36 as of DSH individuals), the probability of having extreme mental issue by 0.29 percent (0.20 percent as of DSH individuals) and the days of having mental issue by 0.03 day (0.01 day as of DSH individuals). Having a republican LGBTQ leader, being very rare, will significantly mitigate the negative impacts among DSH individuals while having insignificant impacts among SSH individuals. For DSH member, having an additional Republican politician in office will reduce the probability of having mental issue by 0.92 percent, the probability of having extreme mental issue by 0.68 percent and days of having mental issue by 0.12 day. Yet these numbers for the LGBTQ individuals are all insignificant.\n\nOnline LGBTQ+ Activism in Eastern Europe\n\nRadzhana Buyantueva, Université libre de Bruxelles\n\nWhile the scholarship on post-Soviet activism, including those analyzing online activism in separate post-Soviet states, is rapidly growing, there is still a lack of systematic comparative research on online activism in the region. This gap is especially noticeable concerning the comparative analysis of online LGBTQ+ activism across post-Soviet states with different socio-political trajectories. This omission is striking because LGBTQ+ activists in the region have increasingly prioritized online engagement as the key mode of mobilizing supporters, promoting LGBTQ+ agenda, and publicizing instances and patterns of discrimination. The paper aims to fill in this gap by analyzing how LGBTQ+ activists employ social media depending on local socio-political environments in Eastern Europe. The focus of the analysis is Estonia, Russia, and Ukraine. These countries present interesting cases for the comparative examination of online LGBTQ+ activism. On the one hand, all three countries are impacted by the legacy of Soviet homophobia. On the other hand, these states display radically different socio-political trajectories over the post-Soviet period, which have created very different opportunities and constraints for LGBTQ+ activists. They have also adopted different approaches to censorship and the freedom of online communication. The paper adopts social movement theories and recent advances in political communication (strategic narrative approach) to examine the use of social media LGBTQ+ Estonians, Russians, and Ukrainians. It explores how local social and political contexts affect discourses and narratives used by LGBTQ+ activists online in these countries.\n\nQueer Activism after Conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Northern Ireland\n\nCera Murtagh, Villanova University; Runa Annasdotter Neely, Villanova University\n\nThe relationship between sexuality and ethno-national conflict is a critical one. That LGBTQ+ rights are particularly vulnerable in the context of ethno-national violence is well established (Hayes & Nagle, 2016; Curtis, 2013). Yet, how do these rights fare in the ‘post-conflict’ phase, in the context of new governing institutions designed to accommodate the main groups to the conflict? Research shows a dearth of recognition and provisions for LGBTQ+ rights in peace agreements (Bell & McNicholl, 2019). However, notwithstanding valuable contributions (see for example: Mikdashi, 2022; Nagle, 2018; Nagle & Fakhoury, 2021; Swimelar, 2020), our knowledge of the impact of post-conflict institutions, such as consociational power-sharing, on queer rights is limited. How are claims for LGBTQ+ equality affected in systems constructed on the basis of a different form of group rights: ethno-national? Moreover, how do activists navigate this system? This paper examines queer activism in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina and Northern Ireland, contexts in which consociational power-sharing was implemented as part of peace agreements in 1995 and 1998 respectively. Drawing together the conceptual frameworks of intersectionality and consociationalism, the paper considers several questions: a) what political opportunity structure do movements for LGBTQ+ rights face in these environments? b) how do these movements mobilize under such conditions? (what strategies do they use, particularly with regard to engagement with political institutions and actors?) and c) to what extent does this activism mount a broader challenge to the system of ethno-national power-sharing and bear the capacity to contribute towards wider debates about citizenship and moves towards democratic reform? The paper draws on evidence from fieldwork conducted in Northern Ireland in 2018 and 2021 and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2023, including ethnographic research and semi-structured interviews with civil society actors and activists. The comparative analysis of these two cases seeks to provide insights into the impact of post-conflict institutions on LGBTQ+ rights movements and, by extension, other movements for human rights and equality. The paper also explores the agency used by such movements to mobilize in this context and their potential to contribute to broader democratic reform and even transformation.\n\nQueer Radical Resistance: A Political Analysis of the Dyke March\n\nSara Angevine, Whittier College\n\nThe Dyke March, one of the broadest reaching, longest lasting protest marches in the United States, focuses on lesbian/dyke visibility and the democratic principles of inclusion, equality, and participation. The first ever Dyke March took place in Washington D.C. on April 24, 1993. Every year since, Dyke Marches have been organized in cities and towns across the United States and around the world, most often during their Gay Pride weekend. Despite its importance and necessity, we know little of the origin and global expansion of the Dyke March. In democracies, protest marches are a critical way for minority viewpoints to gain recognition, to shape the political agenda, and to build community space (Gillion 2013). Both within and outside of the broader LGBTQ political movement, the Dyke March began as a site for radical democratic politics and intersectional mobilization. Dyke Marches depend on the voluntary civic engagement of participants to continue, resisting institutional hierarchy, state affiliation, and market support. Drawing on over 20 face-to-face interviews with lesbian organizers in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles as well as numerous secondary documents, I analyze the origins of the first Dyke March and discuss what factors facilitate its continued success. Beyond their value in sustaining the diversity of the LGBTQ movement, the longevity of Dyke Marches illustrates the powerful democratic impact of any political action governed by inclusion, equality, and participation.\n\nUnderstanding LGBTQ+ Perspectives on Policing\n\nMichelle Ramirez, Texas A&M University Kingsville; Jose Raul Guerrero, University of North Texas\n\nThis research examines the perceptions of law enforcement by the LGBTQ+ community. Relying on data from the 2016 and 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Surveys, we examine the relationship between sexual identity and perceptions of police. We also observe how comfortable members of the LGBTQ+ community feel contacting the police and the role that interactions with law enforcement have on their perceptions of police. We compare our results across five different sexual and gender identity groups in the United States.\n\nHeteronormativities and Queer Kinship\n\nMark Blasius, The City University of New York Graduate Center\n\nThis paper is the second portion of a three-part project on heteronormativity as a concept for political theory and practice (and potentially public policies). The first part, given as a paper for the 2023 APSA Annual Meeting, analyzed heteronormativity genealogically in sexuality and gender studies in connection with its use among advocates promoting sexual rights and justice in several regions of the world. The paper concluded with the hypothesis that heteronormativity is a discursive and practical regime of sexuality that, while not universal, is prevalent enough with penumbral power to be studied comparatively through analysis of the different forms it has taken both historically and in different political contexts in the world today. To clarify how it works and evaluate it for political theory, the paper suggested taking an approach of “comparative heteronormativities.” Accordingly, this proposal for a second stage of the project is to study how heteronormativity works in relation to queer kinship, specifically how studies and advocacy around the latter subvert or transform what’s claimed as a heteronormative regime. It is expected that the third stage of analysis, already somewhat embedded in queer kinship critique and practices, is a call for sexual and reproductive justice; so, it is this call for justice that will be foreshadowed herein as a working framework for future research. For the purpose of this study, queer kinship has developed expansively from an earlier and narrower scholarly and public policy focus on the historical effects of trauma and exclusion from birth families to movements toward “families we choose.” Arising out of a broader critique of heteronormativity and its imbrication with patriarchy, white supremacy, and imperialism, queer kinship encompasses bodily practices and social relationships of belonging, intimacy, friendship, care, eroticism, dependency, and reproduction as chronicled by LGBTIQ- as it intersects with BIPOC- inflected historical scholarship and contemporary social research and theory. As such, the proposed paper will work beyond the already well-discussed topic of gender-neutral marriage rights and imagined experimentation with alternative structures of affective relations to focus on three examples of queer kinship in transforming heteronormativity: “transrelationality” as knowledge- and affect-sharing to resist medical stigmatization, police violence and incarceration, and colonialism; surrogacy and IVF in relation to heteronormativity and reproductive justice; and how queer kinship exemplifies a shift in the way in which the social life of sexuality is reshaped and sustained.\n\nSaturday, September 7, 8:00am – 9:30am\n\nCreated Panel\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Chair) Sungmin Rho, Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies\n\n(Discussant) Martin Dimitrov, Tulane University\n\n(Discussant) Xian Huang, Rutgers University\n\nSession Description:\n\nThis panel brings together five innovative papers that collectively advance our understanding of the intricate dynamics between the state and society within the Chinese context. Each paper offers a distinctive perspective, contributing to the evolving scholarly discourse on this important subject. In the midst of China’s rapid social, political, and economic transformations, a nuanced understanding of the evolving dynamics between the state and society becomes imperative. This panel endeavors to address pivotal questions such as the impact of recent socio-political changes on state-society relations, the observable shifts over time in their interactions, and the identification of actors or phenomena that remain underexplored. By engaging with these inquiries, the panel aims to provide fresh insights into the complexities of governance and agency in contemporary China.\n\nContributing to this discourse, panelists pose unique questions. Two papers scrutinize how state institutions both shape and are shaped by state-society relations. Matt DeButts and Tongtong Zhang examine a decade of citizen complaints, documenting the nature and evolution of these claims over time. Hongshen Zhu and Viola Rothschild investigate how the geographical location of police stations influences citizens’ political trust and engagement. They offer new insights into the understanding of state institutions as repressive and co-optative devices. Another set of papers explores informal, cultural, and social mechanisms impacting state-society relations. Lynette Ong delves into the role of ‘social brokers’ that rely on social and moral norms to elicit concessions from citizens. Dan Chen examines how urban stand-up comedy clubs have become new sites of popular expression and explores their broader implications. Finally, Wei Gu, Ning Liu, and Dongshu Liu explore the growth of the video game industry and its role in reducing economic actors’ reliance on political connections.\n\nThe panel integrates diverse methodological approaches, including in-depth interviews, participant observation, large N analysis, survey experiments, and machine learning. These methodologies explore dynamic tensions within the contemporary Chinese context. We expect the panel to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of state-society relations in China.\n\nPapers:\n\nIs Rights Consciousness Rising in China? Evidence from Ten Years of Complaints\n\nMatt DeButts, Stanford University; Tongtong Zhang, Stanford University\n\nHow do citizens living under authoritarian rule elicit assistance from those in power? Existing literature suggests that Chinese citizens are increasingly exhibiting “rights consciousness” when making claims to the government, invoking the regime’s formal legal commitments as a binding constraint on government behavior. In this paper, we use a novel approach to evaluate this claim by systematically assessing the rhetorical strategies of over three million citizen complaints submitted between 2011-2022 on the largest nationwide online petition platform—the Local Leaders Message Board (LLMB, 人民网地方领导留言板)—using human annotation and automated analysis. Contrary to our expectation that “rights consciousness” is rising in China, we find that only 24% of citizen appeals over the past decade invoke the state’s formal legal commitments when soliciting assistance. In contrast, 56% of appeals perform subjecthood, portraying the complainants as helpless subordinates seeking help from powerful and virtuous rulers. Finally, we also identify that 54% of complaints employ a script of socialist citizenship: that local officials have a moral obligation to provide socio-economic welfare. Nearly half of complaints on LLMB use a mixture of two or all these three citizenship scripts, suggesting that many citizens in China today conceptualize their relationship with the government in multiple and at times conflicting ways. We analyze how the three citizenship scripts vary over time, by complaint topic, and by socio-demographic status of complainants. We also assess the effect of different scripts on substantive government responses. Findings of this research shed light on the evolution of authoritarian citizenship and the changing relationship between Chinese citizens and their government in the Xi Jinping era.\n\nNever Meet Your Heroes: Community Policing in Contemporary China\n\nHongshen Zhu, University of Virginia; Viola Rothschild, Duke University\n\nIn autocracies, police are tasked with both providing law and order for citizens and monitoring and repressing political opposition to the regime. For ordinary citizens, the local police represent the most common and recognizable face of coercive state power, yet, we have little systematic knowledge about how every day, street-level policing impacts citizen’s political attitudes and behaviors in modern autocracies. We study these relationships in the context of contemporary China, a high-capacity authoritarian state that, in recent years, has invested heavily in developing its domestic security apparatus. Drawing on literatures that emphasize the physical and spatial dimensions of autocratic power, we propose that citizens living geographically closer to police stations will be both more exposed to, and reminded of, police violence, incompetence, or malfeasance—issues endemic to local policing in many autocratic states. As a result, they will be less likely to trust and participate in community political institutions. Using data from a recent nationally-representative, probability sample survey and highly precise, geo-referenced information on the location of police stations, we find evidence to support our theory: citizens who live closer to police stations (1) feel less safe, (2) express lower levels of trust in community political institutions, and (3) participate less in neighborhood political affairs. Our findings indicate that the growing investment in the physical police state may further exacerbate local information capture and the alienation of citizens from the system.\n\nAugmenting State Power: Repression through Complicit Society\n\nLynette H. Ong, University of Toronto\n\nHow do states repress society and minimize backlash at the same time? In this paper I address this theoretical puzzle by proposing their use of a strategy of repression through complicit society. I examine the roles of brokers as complicit nonstate actors and the conditions under which they help to legitimate state repression. Notably, social brokers draw on their social capital with network members to exercise social compulsion. By legitimating repression with social‒moral norms, they assuage the perception of policy imposition as state coercive acts and help to augment state power to penetrate society and elicit compliance from the masses accordingly. I illustrate these arguments drawing on case studies of the Chinese state’s gaining community consent to contentious urbanization and demolition projects. This paper contributes to the literature on state power, repression, and brokerage.\n\nPopular Expression in Chinese Standup Comedy\n\nDan Chen, University of Richmond\n\nAs a cultural import, standup comedy has captivated China’s young people since the 2010s. Traditionally, standup comedy is understood as a site of cultural, social, and political critique delivered through humor, which can disarm people’s defensiveness and create a space for alternative views to be considered. In China, however, the party-state controls public discourse and Xi Jinping’s rule has seen collapsing arenas for public speech, setting up an interesting puzzle where intensifying political restrictions have coincided with growing outlets for cultural expression. So, how does standup comedy’s transgressive character transpire in the Chinese context? What is the implication for popular expression in an authoritarian context? Based on recent fieldwork consisting of participant observation at various comedy clubs in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Shenyang, and Dalian and semi-structured interviews with comedians, club managers, and audience members conducted in Shanghai from May to July 2023, I examine the interactive forces of political power, capitalist interest, and traditional culture that both constrain and empower comedic expressions on socially and politically significant issues, such as gender norms, generational conflict, and work culture. By doing so, I situate political power in a late-socialist system of hierarchical yet mutually influencing forces to understand how politics trickles down to everyday public discourse and to uncover the complex relationships between popular desire and state rhetoric. Despite various constraints, standup comedy still allows alternative, sometimes subversive, views to be expressed. Its popularity with Chinese audiences indicates the cultural power of authenticity under current authoritarian conditions.\n\nInternet Economy and the Reduction of Political Connection in China\n\nWei Gu, City University of Hong Kong; Ning Liu, City University of Hong Kong; Dongshu Liu, City University of Hong Kong\n\nIn nations characterized by pronounced political nepotism, firms often establish political connections to secure preferential treatment. This study explores how the emergence of a new economic sector can attenuate such dependence. We argue that the growth of the internet economy, measured in this study by the large-scale video game ‘Honor of Kings’ (HoK) with over 100 million daily active users, enhances the business environment and diminishes local firms’ reliance on political connections. Utilizing provincial and firm-level data from 2007 to 2019, we illustrate that the official operation of HoK within a province fosters a more conducive local business environment and reduces firms’ dependence on political connections. The results indicate that HoK can stimulate the growth of digital-related industries and the digital transformation of the business sector. This aligns with the government’s objective of fostering a digital economy, thereby securing policy support without necessitating political connections. A subsequent survey experiment also reveals that the experience of HoK’s reporting mechanism encourages game players’ political participation and willingness to report corruption, thereby diminishing political connections by enhancing political accountability and public monitoring. These findings illuminate how the growth of the video game industry, and the internet economy more broadly, can foster a favorable business environment and reduce the influence of political connections in the economy. This study also urges policymakers to consider the socioeconomic impacts of the internet economy that have been previously overlooked.\n\nSaturday, September 7, 9:45am – 11:15am\n\nCreated Panel\n\nParticipants:\n\n(Chair) Siyao Li, University of Pittsburgh\n\n(Discussant) Xiaojun Li, University of British Columbia\n\n(Discussant) Seung-Youn Oh, Bryn Mawr College\n\nSession Description:\n\nThis panel focuses on the role of firms and industries in China’s international and domestic political economy. This set of papers addresses two main themes: 1) the strategies and patterns of firms and industries in an age of economic decoupling between the US and China; 2) the interplay between state and market and how the domestic political economy of China affects firm performance. Newman and Xiong’s paper argue that autocracies face a new type of dictator’s dilemma in a world of weaponized interdependence, where authoritarian leaders are likely to prioritize domestic political control over global competitiveness of its large MNCs, as is illustrated by the case of Ant Group. Jaros, Vortherms, and Zhang’s paper study how China’s local political economy impacts foreign firm exits after the outbreak of the trade war and finds that local industrial policies and investment agglomeration decreases the possibility of firm exit. Jialu Li’s paper examines the strategic response of the state in the context of the United States’ economic sanctions against China and finds that sanctions reinforce the state’s perception of firms as core to national security, leading to increased industry support. Meng, Xu, and Xu’s paper studies the effect of China’s economic development zones (EDZs) on economic development and finds that firms located near and within provincial EDZs benefit similarly from EDZs, while the effects of national EDZs lead to a divergence in firm performance. Qin Huang’s paper uses both machine learning methods and in-depth interviews to uncover local state types in China’s economic governance, elucidating the reasons behind divergent developmental models both subnationally and across different time periods in China.\n\nPapers:\n\nChina’s Dilemma to Asserting Economic Coercion\n\nYiying (Gloria) Xiong, Cornell University; Abraham Newman, Georgetown University\n\nThe concentration of economic activity around a few central firms creates chokepoints in the global economy, which can be exploited by powerful states to either monitor or isolate adversaries. While the United States has used such tools against a host of targets, it is still an open question as to whether other great powers, particularly China, will be positioned to compete in a world marked by weaponized interdependence. Proponents of Chinese economic power have shined a spotlight on a series of state sponsored activities largely under the banner of the Belt and Road initiative. Notwithstanding these efforts, private Chinese companies have yet to establish themselves as central players in global economic networks capable of replacing U.S.-based firms. Building on a markets-as-power approach, this paper argues that autocracies face a new type of dictator’s dilemma when attempting to compete in a world of weaponized interdependence. While globally central firms (e.g. economic hubs) offer the state foreign policy tools to compete against other great powers, these firms can also become the site for political power competition with the state domestically. Authoritarian leaders are likely to balance domestic political control over foreign policy autonomy, and thus, placing the emerging hub firms in the cross hairs of domestic political conflict. As the regime attempts to reassert control over these large private economic actors, the tightening of political control not only amplifies market uncertainty but induces greater political risk of cross-border businesses, diminishing the attractiveness of the firm to global partners. To test our argument, we look at the rise and fall of Ant Group, a Chinese digital payment provider. With the technology foundation, business channels, and licenses for cross-border payments, Ant Group was on the path to build a global payment network based on local e-wallets as “nodes” and cross-border payments as “channels”. However, the power struggle with the state eventually led to the abrupt suspension of its IPO, which marked the beginning of a decisive crackdown on the country’s tech industry and hub erosion of the company’s rise to global centrality. The case demonstrates the domestic political limits of competing in a world marked by weaponized interdependence as well as the tensions posed by platform power in autocratic states.\n\nIndustrial Policy and Investment Networks in the US-China Trade War\n\nJiakun Zhang, University of Kansas; Samantha Vortherms, University of California, Irvine; Kyle Alan Jaros, University of Notre Dame\n\nAs the business environment sours in China, why do some foreign investors decide to exit while others choose to stay? While international factors such as international agreements buffer firms from increased political risks in a trade war, how does the local political-economic context affect firms’ decisions to exit? Vortherms and Zhang (2021) show that the US-China trade war broadly elevated political risks for multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in China, increasing firm exit overall but not necessarily in sectors facing higher tariffs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the domestic political economy on MNC exits after the outbreak of the trade war. Specifically, we test two concurrent hypotheses: local industrial policies and investment agglomeration. We argue that local officials use protective policies to undercut the costs introduced by the trade war to maintain existing foreign contracts, which decreases the costs of weathering the costs of the trade war. Simultaneously, networked agglomeration of foreign capital, where foreign firms are integrated in a local market of foreign capital, increases the costs of exiting. Firms both located in districts with preferential policies, such as economic development zones, and integrated with locally networked foreign capital will be the least likely to exit. We add to existing studies of comparative political economy of foreign investment by adding highly detailed political geography variables to understand the spatial variation in firm exits during the unprecedented trade war between the US and China.\n\nChina’ s Strategic Response to US Sanctions\n\nJialu Li, Harvard University\n\nAmidst escalating geopolitical rivalry, states may use economic sanctions not only to punish foreign firms’ illegal behaviors, but also to contain the growth of rivals. This paper examines the strategic response of the target state in the context of the United States’ economic sanctions against China. I argue that US sanctions reinforce China’s view of sanctioned industries as core to its national security goals and prompt the government to respond through industry boosting. With an original dataset of US-sanctioned Chinese firms from 2008-2023 and their domestic competitors, I employ a triple difference-in-difference strategy by comparing sanctioned-impacted firms to not-yet-impacted firms before and after the US sanctions, as well as estimating the differential impact between directly sanctioned firms and indirectly affected domestic competitors. I find strong evidence that the Chinese government does not indiscriminately subsidize US-sanctioned firms; rather, it doubles down support only for firms in the information technology industries. Following US sanctions, China also extends support to sanctioned firms and their domestic competitors through government procurement and expedited patent approval. I show that these protective measures provide assurance to other domestic market actors and incentivize them to continue “business as usual” with sanctioned firms. These findings provide new insights into how geopolitics impact industrial policy, highlighting the dynamic interactions between states and market actors in the realm of economic warfare.\n\nFirm-Level Evidence on Market Competition and Corporate Performance\n\nJian Xu, National University of Singapore; Tianguang Meng, Tsinghua University; Jing Xu, Tsinghua University\n\nDo Economic Development Zones (EDZs) help foster economic development? EDZs have been established by governments around the world to encourage the growth of industrial clusters, to facilitate collaborations, and to achieve more efficient utilization of local resources. Yet, we still have limited firm-level evidence on the effectiveness of EDZs. The extant literature has offered two expectations regarding the impact of EDZs on firms. The conventional and optimistic view suggests that EDZs encourage greater competitions among firms by creating industrial clusters, where firms receive government support to become industrial leaders. The pessimistic view suggests that EDZs concentrate disproportionately high amounts of economic and political resources, which disadvantage and discriminate against outsiders, especially smaller, late-comer firms and foreign businesses. In this paper, we examine EDZs’ impact on economic development by using an original geocoded dataset of EDZs, which include a total of 177 national-level and 1,264 province-level EDZs in China. We merge the EDZ dataset with a firm-level dataset of about 1.1 million enterprises, combined with census data for 3,137 counties, including the 1,343 counties where the EDZs are located. Exploiting spatial discontinuities in firms’ distances to EDZs, our RDD analysis finds that firms"
