        "text": "As Printed in the Connecticut Reports volume 148, pages 740 - 746\n\nWhen a person in high public position reaches great stature in his career, we tend to chronicle and extol his accomplishments at the expense of the personal qualities which so often give the true picture of the man. Devotion to duty, prodigious energy, keen intellect, and exceptional capacity are molded into an image of public service. It may be a true and inspiring image, like a great statue, but like the statue, it fails to impart the warmth and human quality so essential to the fullness of a distinguished personality. No understanding of the man who held the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Errors for a longer period than any other in the history of Connecticut is complete unless, along with his public achievements, we emphasize his natural and easy friendliness, which made every personal contact a delight.\n\nWilliam Mills Maltbie was country born, in the then small town of Granby, Connecticut, on March 10, 1880. Descended from a long New England ancestry, he was the only son of Theodore Mills and Louise A. Jewett Maltbie. His early environment, which permitted a boyhood uncomplicated by the distractions of urban life, taught him, at first hand, the basic values of wholesome living. The country gave him a love of fields, woods and streams which sustained him in tranquility throughout his busy life. He never became too occupied to digress excitedly about the partridge or fox surprised on one of his many walks or while riding his horse through the woods. He was always ready to talk enthusiastically of the growing things in nature as objects inspiring and fascinating to a devout and active mind.\n\nFrom the grade school, he entered Hartford Public High School and was graduated in 1897. He thereupon entered Yale and, in 1901, received the A.B. degree, graduating second in his class. He went on to Yale Law School and received the LL.B. degree summa cum laude in 1905.\n\nThe interlude of university life did not loosen the devotion to his native Granby and, although upon his admission to the Connecticut bar in 1905 he entered his father's Hartford office to practice law, he maintained a Granby residence which was to continue without interruption until his death on December 15, 1961, at the age of eighty-one. The early years of his law practice found him driving a horse from his Granby home to the railroad station in Tariffville to commute by train to his Hartford office, but to a lover of country living the trip was worth the effort involved. Perhaps as an omen of the activity to come, this fledgling lawyer, in 1908, had already prepared an index digest of the Connecticut Reports covering volumes 64 to 81.\n\nA life of public service began in 1913 with the election to the General Assembly as representative from Granby. During that session, he served as chairman of both the Joint and House Committees on Constitutional Amendments.\n\nIn 1914, there ripened a friendship which was to span, in its entirety, a half century. In that year William Maltbie was appointed assistant state's attorney for Hartford County under the late Hugh Mead Alcorn, and he held that position until he was appointed a judge of the Superior Court in 1917. Mr. Alcorn, who had been appointed state's attorney in 1908, continued in that office until 1942, and the official contacts of the two men were necessarily frequent. The deeply personal friendship between them far transcended official contacts, however, and beginning early, grew constantly stronger as the years passed. It stemmed from respect, admiration and genuine affection on the part of each man for the other. And it gave the writer the cherished opportunity of knowing Judge Maltbie first as a person, unadorned with the honors which were to come, and of finding in him one who could share a boy's interests, not condescendingly in the way of some adults, but sincerely and in man-to-man fashion.\n\nWhile still fulfilling the duties of assistant state's attorney, the future chief justice was, in 1915, appointed executive secretary to Governor Marcus H. Holcomb, and he held that position until 1917. At the same time he served, from 1916, as a member of the grievance committee of the Hartford County Bar. As though his seemingly unlimited capacity for the responsibility and effort could not be overtaxed, he also undertook, from 1915 to 1917, the duties of secretary to the commission then engaged in the preparation of the 1918 revision of the General Statues.\n\nIn 1917, the judicial career which was to make the name Maltbie known far beyond the boundaries of Connecticut began. On August 1, Governor Holcomb appointed him a judge of the Superior Court, effective August 31, 1917. This was not the only noteworthy event of that year for the young jurist, for in the same year he married Mary L. Hamlin. The strong, deeply loyal and solicitous relationship which existed between him and Mrs. Maltbie until his death was a large and highly rewarding facet of his life. With that rare devotion which is truly selfless, Mrs. Maltbie offered him a home life which was pleasant, quiet, understanding and solid. She shared his interest in his garden, in nature, and in his many outside activities. His contentment and well-being were her first concern. His devotion to her was touching. Those who saw their activity and home life together sensed how completely it nourished the character that so brilliantly serve our state. They were devoted not only to one another but also to their only son, Theodore Mills Maltbie, who returned that devotion in full measure. Ted, as his parents affectionately called him, is a Hartford lawyer, living in West Hartford with his wife and two children.\n\nThe appointment to the Superior Court seemed to act as a valve to release the volatile energy in the brilliant mind and rugged physique of the future chief justice. Lean and lithe in figure, his physical appearance gave slight hint of the strength which carried him through almost thirty-nine full years of judicial service with scarce an absence due to illness. That record appears the more remarkable when the myriad activities in which he engaged are considered.\n\nClose upon his appointment to the Superior Court, he served as a member of the committee of judges which compiled the Practice Book of 1922. In 1924, he collaborated with Henry H. Townshend in supplementing his earlier index digest to carry it through volume 97 of the Connecticut Reports. He had a consuming interest not only in correct interpretation of the substance of the law but also in the perfection of the rules of procedure by which the substantive result might be justly reached. The work upon the 1922 Practice Book was the beginning of a lifelong study, publicly evidenced by his subsequent participation in both the 1934 and the 1951 revisions. Indeed, a lengthy memorandum of suggested improvements followed the 1951 revision and is, even now, aiding those engaged in the preparation of still another revision at present in the making.\n\nJudge Maltbie continued as a Superior Court judge until 1925 when, on January 29 of that year, he became a justice of the Supreme Court of Errors. Slightly less than six years later he became, on December 1, 1930, chief justice, the position which he continued to hold until his retirement, by reason of the constitutional limitation as to age, on March 10, 1950. He was, at the age of fifty, the youngest man to become chief justice in the history of the state.\n\nDuring his more than twenty-five years as a member of the Supreme Court of Errors, he took part in 3685 decisions, 824 of which he wrote the majority opinion. He was not a dissenter if it could be avoided, for the record reveals that he disagreed with the majority only fifty-six times, out of which he found it necessary to record his written dissent only thirty-three times. Concerning this record, his longtime friend and associate on the court, former Chief Justice Allyn L. Brown, has this to say: \"He never compromised his convictions, or hesitated to keep sharply defined the difference between right and wrong... Not only did he assign to himself the most difficult opinions which were to be written but, by his logical and persuasive comments on the opinions prepared by the other judges, very often obviated the danger of dissenting opinions and helped preserve the symmetrical development of the common law of Connecticut.\"\n\nOne of Chief Justice Maltbie's most outstanding characteristics was his constant willingness to impart to his associates anything which his deep insight in the law suggested as an aid to clear and orderly judicial decision. His collection of material on jury charges has been for many years, and still is, the authoritative guide for trial judges. His compilation of Supreme Court rescripts is in daily use by the judges of that court. He set down his \"Thoughts on the Writing of Opinions\" in part as follows: \"The most important function of a court of last resort is to formulate the principles of the common law so that, in a changing and ever more complex world, there may be preserved a balance of rights as nearly just as may be and men may know with some degree of certainty how to determine their conduct so as not to subject themselves to loss or penalty. Courts might conceivably perform this function, as the Legislature passes laws, by a categorical statement that in the situation before it a certain principle of law is to be applied. The strength and vitality of the common law lies, however, not so much in the validity and justice of the principle of law it applies as in the manner in which those principles are ascertained. ... No matter how able, honest and industrious a court may be, its opinions will not in the long run be held in high regard unless they demonstrate that it solves the problems before it by the methods which time and the stability of law and rights in the Anglo-Saxon world have proven to be essentially correct. To make this manifest is perhaps the greatest purpose of judicial decision.\"\n\nThis is not the place to examine how admirably the Chief Justice followed these principles in the extensive contribution which he has made to the growth of the law in Connecticut. Concerning the unwritten law of this state he wrote, in Swentusky v. Prudential Ins. Co., 116 Conn. 526, 531: \"That law can never be static, but it must be everlastingly developing to meet the changing needs of a changing civilization. But if our system of law is to have stability and a measurable degree of certainty, its development must be an orderly process, an accretion to the body of principles which are the outgrowth of past precedents, reasoned out in pursuance of that method of thinking which is the essence of the common law.\" How ably he served that task and how great he became in judicial stature as a result are attested by the many published commendations of his work which have appeared over the years and by the degrees recognizing his legal scholarship. He received the LL.D. degree from Yale in 1933, from Elon College, in North Carolina, in 1941, and from Hillyer College, now the University of Hartford, in 1955. In 1934, Trinity College, Hartford awarded him the J.U.D. degree, and Boston University conferred the D.C.L., degree in 1942.\n\nIn 1940, he published the first edition of \"Connecticut Appellate Procedure,\" which overnight became the indispensable guidebook of bench and bar and, in 1957, following his retirement from the Supreme Court, he published the revised second edition. This was not, however, to be the last demonstration of his ceaseless energy. There has recently been published a supplement to his \"Connecticut Appellate Procedure\" which he completed during his last illness, bringing the work through volume 147 of the Connecticut Reports. To the very last, the state was the beneficiary of his judicial talents. Following his retirement from the bench, he served actively as a state referee and, in addition to the routine calls of that office, sat as a one-man grand jury in important investigations in Hartford in 1951 and in Norwich in 1954. Always seeking to improve the judicial system, he was active in the effort to establish the Circuit Court, which became reality in 1961.\n\nHis interest and activity in the law extended beyond the boundaries of Connecticut, however, for, in addition to participation in the work of the Hartford County, the State, and the American Bar Associations, he found time for lively interest in the work of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology, the American Judicature Society, and the American Law Institute.\n\nWhen we leave the professional aspects of his career, it is to find that his next most consuming interest was young people. It was his conviction that, along with a jurisprudence as nearly perfect as human frailty allowed, the boys and girls who must supply future leadership furnished the substance most vital to the welfare of the state and nation. So, in his exemplary way, he devoted long hours to activities intended to develop character, ideals, and knowledge of governmental processes in young people. To that the end he served, at various times in his career, as a member of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America, president of the Charter Oak Council of the Boy Scouts of America, and chairman of the council of the Eagle Board Review. He was a member of the boy's work committee of the national Young Men's Christian Association and a trustee of the Hartford Y.M.C.A. The annual Nutmeg Boys State and Laurel Girls State, held on the campus of the University of Connecticut, invariably found him on hand to administer, in judicial robe, the oath of office to the \"elected\" officers, usually with the addition of a thought-provoking message for the \"electorate.\" Equally active in the Connecticut Y.M.C.A. Youth and Government Program, he was chairman of the sponsoring committee and largely instrumental in initiating the mock legislative sessions for high school students now held as an annual event at the State Capitol.\n\nPerhaps next to his interest in boys and girls was his concern for those unfortunates who, for reasons other than viciousness, had run afoul of the criminal law, and his endeavor to extend the use of probation procedures in cases which seemed to merit them. This explains, in part, his period of service as trustee of the Probation Association and his work with the Connecticut Prison Association, which he served as president for so many years.\n\nHis concern for any subject of general interest accounts for his participation, as chairman, in the task of a committee appointed by the Governor to study the Hartford area traffic problem in 1954, and for his chairmanship of a committee to study the Fairfield State Hospital in 1957. A Congregationalist, he assisted, in 1957, in drafting the constitution of the recently formed United Church of Christ. He was, at various times, president of the Greater Hartford Federation of Churches (now the Greater Hartford Council of Churches), president of the Connecticut Opera Association, and a member of the Board of Pardons, the State Library Committee, the Connecticut Board of Education for the Blind, and the Connecticut War Council. Along with it all, he gave unstintingly of his time to church and public organizations and activities in the home town he loved so well. A lifelong member of the Republican Party and the Masonic Order, he also belonged to various patriotic societies, including the Sons of the American Revolution, and was a member of the University Club of Hartford.\n\nThe very listing of his diverse interests, so long as to be almost tedious, is, nevertheless, emphatic proof of the widespread confidence reposed in his wisdom and judgment. In final analysis, the fact is paramount that people turned to him primarily because of his brilliant intellect but more particularly because here was a kindly man who exemplified the basic values of a wholesome life, and who gave freely and gladly of his talents in any endeavor which advanced the best interests of his community, his state, and the law. There was no forbidding aloofness, no cold detachment, no demonstration of superior knowledge about him. The easy friendliness, the warm and gentle humility of his manner was magnetic. Pages could be filled with the recital of kindly, thoughtful acts to neighbors, associates and others which are unrecorded because he would wish it so. Nevertheless, they, as much as the brilliance of public achievement, must go to make up the image of the truly great personality which will live beyond the memory of those privileged to know William Mills Maltbie.\n\n*Prepared by Hon. Howard W. Alcorn, of Suffield.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 111, page iii (also printed in volume 112, page iii)\n\nAppointed Chief Justice April 25th, 1929, to take effect upon the retirement of the Hon. George W. Wheeler.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 136, page iii\n\nRetired March 10, 1950, under constitutional limitation as to age.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 60, pages 590 - 592\n\nJohn Perkins Cushing Mather, a prominent member of the New London County bar, died at his residence in New London on the 12th day of February, 1891.\n\nHe was the son of Capt. Andrew Mather, a native of Lyme in this state, who for many years, and until his death, was a commander in the United States revenue marine, and for a long period in the latter years of his connection with the service was in command of the cutter stationed at New London. His family residence was at New London. There his son John was born on September 23d, 1816, in the homestead that continued to be his home through all his long life. The son entered Yale College at the age of seventeen, and graduated in the class of 1837.\n\nChoosing the law to be his profession, after he left college he entered upon its practical study in the office of the late Lyman Law of New London. He was admitted to the bar in 1839, and commenced a practice at New London, which was actively continued (except as it was interrupted or encroached upon by the duties of judicial or political positions to which he was called), until his retirement from professional and public business in the year 1886.\n\nHe was chosen mayor of the city of New London in 1845, and held that office by re-election until he resigned it in 1850 to become the secretary of the state.\n\nIn 1849 he was elected one of the representatives of the town of New London in the General Assembly, and served on its judiciary committee. In 1850 he was elected by the General Assembly secretary of the state, to fill out the unexpired term of Hon. Hiram Weed, who died during his term, and was continued in the office for three annual terms next following. In the elections of 1851, 1852 and 1853 he was the nominee for that office on the democratic state ticket, which was headed, in each of those elections, with the name of the Hon. Thomas H. Seymour. In 1851 there was no choice of state officers by the people, but the General Assembly by its vote chose the democratic candidates. In 1852 and 1853 Mr. Mather, with others of the democratic nominees, was elected by the popular vote.\n\nIn 1858 Mr. Mather was appointed, by President Buchanan, the collector of customs at New London. That office he held until the early part of President Lincoln's term in 1861, when he gave place to a republican successor appointed by the new president.\n\nIn 1866, 1867, 1868, 1870 and 1873, he was the judge of the police and city court of New London. In 1871 he was judge of the probate court for the New London district. He was a little later one of the five revisers of the statutes of the state by whom the revision of 1875 was prepared. In 1878 and 1879 he sat in the state senate, from the New London district.\n\nIn 1879 he was appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas in New London County, and remained in that office, by reappointment when his first term closed, until in 1886 he relinquished it because he had reached the limit of age fixed by the constitution of the state.\n\nThis enumeration of the various offices filled by Judge Mather during his extended career, may well serve to indicate the extent and variety of his qualifications for rendering useful service to his fellow citizens in public stations of trust and responsibility. It exhibits the subject of our sketch, however, as devoting much of his time through a course of many years to public affairs more or less connected with or related to politics or political influences. But he was not a politician, and he was not an office seeker. The duties of these places were cast upon him by the common voice of fellow-citizens who recognized his fitness to serve them and who called him to that service because he was the man capable and trustworthy for the duty. The attractions of politics or of office were never, to his view, sufficient to draw away his mind from its attachment to his chosen profession of the law. From first to last, - at all times, - he was faithful and earnest in his devotion to the duties of that profession. He was, above all things else, the lawyer always.\n\nTo the more showy branches of legal practice, that so much fill the eye of the general public outside the bar, he seemed not so much adapted or inclined. He made no effort to attain distinction as an orator, or as a brilliant contestant in the struggles of the court room. His habit was quiet, unobtrusive, devoid of all the pretensions that might challenge the admiring notice of the populace. His sphere was that of the counsellor, and in that field of service he was in a rare degree wise and prudent. His knowledge of the law was full and profound. He was patient to hear, keen to observe and to scan, close and sound in reasoning, careful in considering, firm in his conclusions and faithful to them, and his speech was the plain and direct and clear expression of the wisdom that was in him.\n\nOn the bench he exhibited admirably these qualities so much to be desired and so highly to be prized in those of our profession who are called to judicial positions. Alike by his brethren of the profession and by the laity outside the bar, he was recognized by the observant ones as the right man for the place, the upright and learned magistrate, the model judge. Many there are of the members of the bar - of the junior, perhaps, especially - who cherish grateful memories of his kindly disposition and demeanor.\n\nAfter he left the bench in 1886 Judge Mather lived in quiet retirement at his ancestral home in New London. He was never a man of robust physique, and in his last years, as bodily strength declined and infirmities grew and multiplied, he remained more and more in the seclusion of his home, among his books. He had always been an enthusiastic book-lover, and in his last years his library was, more than ever before, the place where he loved to be.\n\nHe died of an attack of bronchitis, at about three o'clock on the morning of the 12th of February, 1891. Late in the evening of that night his physician saw indications that the end was nigh at hand. The patient received with undisturbed composure the announcement that before the rising of the morning's sun his eyes would have closed forever upon all the things of the earth, and he calmly awaited the end.\n\nWith serene soul, and brave heart, and unfaltering step, this honored brother in our honorable profession, who had finished his work here, calmly and quietly passed out through the invisible portal into the eternal mysteries of the world beyond.\n\n*Prepared at the request of the Reporter by Charles W. Butler, Esq., of the New London County bar.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 60, pages 593 - 602\n\nCHARLES JOHNSON McCURDY, who had been for many years one of the foremost men in the state in professional and public life, died at Lyme in this state, where he was born and had always lived, on the 8th of June, 1891, in the ninety-fourth year of his age. Twenty-four years before his death he had left, under the constitutional limit as to age, the bench of the Supreme Court of the state, and had since lived in dignified retirement at the ancestral mansion, occupying himself with agricultural pursuits, the gratification of his taste for literature and art, an interested and intelligent observation of the progress of the world, the society of his friends, and a generous hospitality. His physical vigor and activity continued in a remarkable degree till near the close of his life, and his mental faculties remained for the same time unimpaired.\n\nAt a meeting of the bar of New London County, called upon the occasion of his death, the following resolutions were presented by a committee of the bar and passed : -\n\n\"In the death of the Hon. Charles Johnson McCurdy of Lyme, the New London County bar has lost its oldest and one of its ablest members. He was a man of character, an able lawyer, a safe counsellor, an upright and patriotic citizen, energetic, of strong will but always open and manly. He scorned mean deeds and mean men. He died in the ripeness of age, after a lifetime of success in his chosen profession, in the plenitude of his powers, with his eye undimmed and his natural force unabated. His death was not an unexpected and sudden blow, but the natural and expected translation of a completed earthy life to the higher and better life beyond.\n\n\"The members of the New London County bar take pleasure in placing on record their high appreciation of Judge McCurdy's strength of character, of his winning geniality of temper and manner, of his unswerving integrity, of his self-sacrificing devotion to principle in public and private life, of his industry and zeal as a lawyer, of his fidelity as a legislator, of his talent as a diplomat, and of his patience, acumen and wisdom as a judge of the Supreme Court and expounder of the constitution and the laws. His private life was blameless and he graced and honored every function of public life in which he was called to engage.\n\n\"He lived for many years at his pleasant home in Lyme, amid rural surroundings, and passed quietly away full of years and honors, calmly prepared to meet the fate which the next world had in store for him. His life may well be studied and his manly virtues emulated by the young men of to-day.\n\n\"Resolved, That in further appreciation of our friend and brother, and to perpetuate the remembrance of his many virtues, these resolutions be entered upon the records of the bar, and that the court be requested to cause the same to be spread upon the records of the Superior Court.\"\n\nJeremiah Halsey, Esq., in presenting the resolutions to the court, made the following address: -\n\nMR. HALSEY'S ADDRESS.\n\nMay it please the court : - Before making the motion suggested by the resolutions, I desire to make some allusions to the life, character and public service of our departed friend and brother.\n\nJudge McCurdy was born at Lyme, December 7th, 1797. His grandfather was a Scotch-Irish Presbyterian, who was a successful and worthy merchant, an ardent patriot, and one of the earliest and boldest in urging on the American revolution. His father, Richard McCurdy, was a graduate of Yale and a lawyer by profession, but devoted himself to agricultural pursuits and the care of his estate.\n\nHis mother was Ursula Wolcott Griswold, granddaughter on her father's side of the first Governor Griswold, and of that Ursula Wolcott whose husband, father, brother, uncle, nephew, and still greater son, Roger Griswold, were all governors of Connecticut. On her mother's side she was a granddaughter of the Rev. Stephen Johnson of Lyme, who is noted in history for his eloquent papers in favor of colonial rights, which roused into existence the \"Sons of Liberty\" and were among the most efficient causes of the revolution. The maternal grandmother of Judge McCurdy's mother was Elizabeth Diotate, descended from Dr. Theodore Diotate, a distinguished court physician of London in the time of James I., and brother of the Rev. John Diotate, an eminent theologian of Geneva.\n\nHaving had his early educational training at the Bacon Academy in Colchester, he entered Yale College in 1813, and was graduated with high honors in 1817. He studied law in the office of Chief Justice Swift of Windham, and was admitted to the bar in 1819. In May, 1822, he married Sarah Ann, daughter of Richard Lord of Lyme, a woman of great refinement and sensitive nature, a devoted wife and mother, who died in 1835, at the age of thirty-six, leaving an only child, now the wife of Prof. Edward E. Salisbury of New Haven. During the remainder of his life, more than half a century, he remained a widower.\n\nMr. McCurdy soon attained eminence in his profession and early became interested in political affairs. He was elected to the legislature as a representative from his native town, and served as a member of that body for ten years between 1827 and 1844, being speaker of the house three of those years. In 1832 he was state senator, and in 1847 and 1848 he was lieutenant governor and president of the senate.\n\nHe originated, and with the assistance of Hon. Charles Chapman, was chiefly influential in carrying through, in 1848, that great change in the common law by which parties and others interested in the event of suits are allowed to be witnesses - a change which has since been adopted in this country and in England.\n\nHe held the office of judge of the County Court for New London County for several years. This court had an important jurisdiction, civil and criminal, the judges of which were appointed annually by the General Assembly.\n\nIn 1851 he represented this country at the court of Austria. The situation then was one of great delicacy, as the Austrians were much irritated against our nation on account of the reception of Kossuth, and the American legation at Vienna was supposed to be a place of refuge and protection, not only for our citizens, but also for the subjects of other countries, including Great Britain, when endangered or annoyed by the Austrian authorities, who were exasperated by the recent Hungarian revolution. His course in liberating from imprisonment the Rev. Charles L. Brace will be remembered, and his assistance to the Scotch missionaries who were driven out of Hungary was the subject of commendation in the British Parliament.\n\nHe returned to the United States at the close of 1852 and resumed the practice of his profession. From this time until his appointment to the bench of the Superior Court he was actively engaged as leading counsel in litigated cases of importance.\n\nIn 1856 he was appointed a judge of the Superior Court and in 1863 a judge of the Supreme Court of Errors, which position he held until his retirement by constitutional limitation of age in 1867.\n\nIn 1861 he was an active member of the peace convention, where he was one of the first to discover the irreconcilability of the opposing views of the north and south; but after the civil war commenced, and even during its darkest days, he never doubted the final success of the union cause.\n\nSubsequent to his retirement from the bench he for several years delivered courses of lectures before the law school of Yale College, from which institution he received the degree of doctor of laws in 1868.\n\nMy acquaintance commenced with Judge McCurdy in 1846. He was then judge of the County Court. I appeared before him to argue my first case; it was naturally to me a momentous event. The courtesy, kindness and attention with which Judge McCurdy listened to my argument made a lasting impression upon my memory. Since that time, while he was engaged in practice, I have been associated with him in the conduct of many important causes.\n\nAs a lawyer he was learned in the law, wise and judicious in counsel, honorable and courteous to his opponents; as an advocate he was clear, concise, forcible and polished. The duties of the judicial office were more congenial to him than practice at the bar. He entered upon the discharge of those duties with a deep sense of the responsibility which they imposed. His knowledge of the law, combined with sound sense in its application to the circumstances of affairs which carne before him for judgment, and a strong love of justice, eminently qualified him for the judicial office. He gave an attentive hearing to every member of the bar who had occasion to present anything for his consideration. He was a gentleman of polished manners and was always courteous and dignified.\n\nJudge McCurdy always resided in his native town. In 1860, after the death of his father, leaving the home where he had lived since his marriage, he took possession of the ancestral homestead, a large farm which had then been in the family for more than one hundred years. Washington lodged there in April, 1776, and it was the headquarters of Gen. Lafayette in July, 1776, when he rested his detachment of troops at Lyme on their march between Boston and New York, and it again gave him a welcome on his visit to this country in 1824.\n\nHe became deeply interested in agriculture. He was always a constant and discriminating observer of public events. Inheriting a constitution of remarkable vigor and elasticity, always regular and temperate in his habits, he never had a serious illness, and his physicians say that he had no disease even at the last. Until about two years ago, though then over ninety-one years old, he showed none of the infirmities of that age, but was erect in figure, active in movement, with a delicate blush upon his cheeks and eyes not dim. His voice was still rich and melodious, his conversation was still full of point and wit, his interest in life as keen and his society as attractive as ever, and he retained his early fondness for poetry, literature and art.\n\nThus crowned with length of days, wisdom and honor, sustained and soothed by an unfaltering faith and trust, he met the approach of death,\n\n\"Like one that draws the drapery of his couch\n\nAbout him and lies down to pleasant dreams.\"\n\nAn illustrated article of considerable length and of great interest, with regard to Judge McCurdy and his ancestry, by Martha J. Lamb, appeared in the November number of the Magazine of American History, and the remainder of the present article is made up of extracts from it.\n\n______\n\nAmong the jurists of the country who have figured in the field of public affairs since the beginning of the present century it would be difficult to find a longer or more perfectly rounded and beautiful life than that of Judge Charles Johnson McCurdy of Lyme, Connecticut. Born in December of the eventful year 1797, when John Adams was in the early part of his presidency of the United States and George Washington still living, his career has been identified with nine of the most important decades of the world's history. He could remember the excitement which followed the death of Hamilton in the fatal duel with Aaron Burr, and was a boy of ten years when the steamboat of Robert Fulton made her first successful passage from New York to Albany. He was prepared for college during the excitements which culminated in the war of 1812, and was graduated from Yale with honors in 1817, the same year that Madison retired from his second administration and Monroe took the presidential chair. He was admitted to the bar in 1819, and with a successful practice from the first had become one of the leading lawyers in the state before there was a railroad projected on this continent.....\n\nPersonally he was a gentleman of the old school, with rich, fair complexion, dark hair, expressive eyes, finely cut features, of medium height, erect and well-proportioned figure and courtly bearing, with exceptional polish of manners. In temperament he was happy, cheerful, elastic; and his liberal culture, practical wisdom, sparkling wit and humor, and inexhaustible fund of reminiscences, together with his apt poetical quotations, made him a charming social companion. He was literary in his tastes, with a quick eye for whatever of merit was discernible in the whole range of poetry, art and literature, was intelligently interested in scientific investigations, active in promoting agricultural improvements, and always a discriminating observer of political events. His reading was varied; he was fond of the classics, but always had the time and inclination to keep abreast with new publications and the current news and periodicals of the day, even to his ninety-first year.\n\nHis knowledge of human nature seemed intuitive, and his acute perceptions and sound judgment made him it all times a safe counselor. During his many years of law practice in the Connecticut courts he invariably advised the townspeople about him who came with grievances against their neighbors, \"Never go to law if you can by any possibility settle your differences among yourselves.\" To the poor he was always a conscientious friend; no one listened more patiently than he to tales of genuine distress, or was more sympathetic and unostentatious in providing speedy relief. At the same time his public-spirited regard for the welfare and improvement of the community about him, led him whenever practicable to exercise that element of true charity which helps others to help themselves. He had literally a clear head, a kind heart, and an open hand.\n\nHe was married in 1822 to his second cousin, Sarah Ann Lord, the daughter of Richard and Anne (Mitchell) Lord, her mother being the daughter of William Mitchell, a wealthy Scotchman, who was the first cousin to Chief Justice Stephen Mix Mitchell. Mrs. McCurdy was a lady of great loveliness of mind and character, but her domestic happiness was of brief duration. She died in 1834, leaving only one child, a daughter. Judge McCurdy did not marry again. The education of this daughter became one of his greatest pleasures, and as she developed and matured into womanhood it was his delight to make her his confidential friend and familiarize her mind with his legal and business affairs, and share with her his political, intellectual, and social interests. He was extensively acquainted with the prominent men of the country, and his house was always open to the most generous hospitalities, his daughter presiding over his household.\n\nThe historic dwelling in Lyme where Judge McCurdy was born, and in which he resided continuously during the last thirty-four years of his life, is one of the oldest houses in Connecticut. Four generations of the McCurdys have lived in it and three later ones have been entertained under its roof or trace their lineage from it. It has been enlarged until it measures over ninety feet in length, and its sound timbers give abundant evidence of the solidity of the colonial architecture which it represents. The precise age of the original building is not known, but it is believed to have been built about 1725. It was purchased by John McCurdy, the grandfather of Judge McCurdy, in 1754. Its antique features have a special charm for the curious. The interior work is believed to have been done by English carpenters, especially the paneled oak wainscots, fluted pilasters in the corners of the rooms, graceful arches about the fireplaces, and the wood carving of the elegant \"corner cupboard\" or buffet in the south parlor, with shell-shaped top, built with the house, which is appropriately devoted to an exceedingly choice collection of specimens of the porcelain used by the American ancestors of Judge McCurdy. A volume might be written from its shelves. The whole house is a museum of souvenirs of former generations of ancestral families. The articles of furniture are in most instances over a hundred years old, and each with an interesting history. Many of them are associated with the visit of Washington on the 9th of April, 1876, when he spent a night under this roof on his journey from Cambridge to New York. Lafayette, in command of a detachment of troops, was the guest of John McCurdy on the night of July 27th, 1778, occupying the north chamber over the north parlor of the house. He was here again forty-six years afterward, in 1824, on his memorable journey to Boston as the guest of the nation, and was entertained by Richard McCurdy, the youngest son of John McCurdy, and his family, which included Charles Johnson McCurdy, who had then been married some two years.\n\nThe distinguishing acts of Judge McCurdy's public life are of interest to all Americans. While he was lieutenant-governor of Connecticut he originated and carried into effect, through the legislature, that great change in the common law by which parties and others interested in the event of suits are allowed to be witnesses, a change which has since been generally adopted throughout this country and in England. Our readers will remember the publication of some very interesting correspondence in the early part of 1888, between Judge McCurdy and Hon. David Dudley Field, in relation to the true genesis of the great improvement in one of the most important of all human transactions - the administration of justice. Mr. Field published the law in his code in 1849, and was emphatic in his statement that the English were indebted to the efforts of Judge McCurdy for the idea which resulted in the same improvement in their courts.\n\nAt the time Judge McCurdy was sent to Austria, the post of chargé d'affaires was one of great delicacy and importance. * * * Vienna was still the famous old walled city of feudal times, not leveled as now into the magnificent streets of a modern capital, and the government of tyranny and fear had not given place to liberal and peaceful rule....Rev. Charles L. Brace was one of those arrested and thrown into a dungeon, while traveling in Hungary. He was accused of bearing papers of treasonable character from Hungarian fugitives, and although he really had but one letter in his possession, and that only a note of introduction containing not more than three lines, and one pamphlet, an essay on the Hungarian question, which he kept for his own private use as a matter of historic importance, he was treated as a convict. Through the prompt and energetic intercession of Mr. McCurdy, which involved a spirited correspondence with Prince Schwarzenburg, long since made public, Mr. Brace was finally rescued and his life saved. Hardly less notable was the philanthropy exercised by Mr. McCurdy in relation to the Scotch missionaries who were expelled by the government from Austria, where they had labored for ten years or more. It was midwinter, some of the clergymen had sick wives and young children, and they all keenly felt the hardship of breaking up their homes at a few days' notice and removing their families to Scotland. They came to Vienna seeking assistance from the English embassy, and not receiving it proceeded to the American legation. Mr. McCurdy could do nothing officially, but his intelligent interference procured them some favors, and his ready sympathy and offer of his private purse were never forgotten. He afterward received the thanks of the Free Church of Scotland, and his course was commended by the English Parliament.\n\nOn his return from Austria Judge McCurdy resumed his practice at the bar. He was learned in every branch of the law, was a forcible speaker, strong in argument, acute, witty, convincing, but always honorable and courteous to his opponents. He was constantly engaged as leading counsel in important cases until his appointment as judge. The older lawyers held his opinions in highest respect, while the younger men speak with enthusiastic gratitude of his kindness and helpful consideration, especially in the days of their timid inexperience. He was eminently qualified for the bench, always giving attentive hearing to every member of the bar who had occasion to present anything for his consideration, and discharging all the duties of his judicial office with ability and wisdom. He was a ready writer as well as public speaker and singularly happy in the choice of words, his language being remarkable for its terseness, point, and symmetry.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1860 Judge McCurdy sold his large, handsome house, where he had lived since his marriage, and took possession of the ancestral homestead, in which he spent the peaceful evening of his days. From early life he had limited his ambitions; a hereditary moderation seems to have calmed his pulses and saved him from the feverish restlessness which wears out prematurely so many public men. He repeatedly declined nominations for political office, including that of governor of the state, preferring the quiet sphere of legal practice or the serener position of judge. After he left the bench he indulged his studious inclinations, kept fresh his familiarity with history, the classics, poetry, and art, entertained his friends, and took active interest in the care of his estate. His daughter and only child, his intimate companion through her life, became the wife of Professor Edward E. Salisbury of New Haven, a gentleman of elegant scholarship and literary accomplishments, lately professor at Yale, a pioneer in oriental studies in this country; and Mr. and Mrs. Salisbury have since divided their residence between New Haven and the ancestral homestead in Lyme, Mrs. Salisbury presiding over both.\n\nJudge McCurdy descended not only from the ancient MacKirdy race of Scotland and Ireland, but from the Willoughbys, Gilberts, Drakes, Wolcotts, and Griswolds of England, the Vander Lindens of Belgium, the De Gallegos of Spain and the Diodatis of Italy. Among the strong men, his more immediate ancestors, who led in the formation of our early colonies and their later independence, were Deputy-Governor Francis Willoughby, Henry Wolcott, Hon. Daniel Clarke, John Ogden, Governor Roger Wolcott, Governor Matthew Griswold, and Rev. Stephen Johnson. One might expect to find him the man he was, enlightened, high minded, public spirited. His religious training and tendencies found expression in his familiarity with the Scriptures, and in his never-failing practical efforts for the support of public worship. A characteristic incident is related of him. He had built a house for his farmer, and the man and his family were comfortably quartered in it, when suddenly it was found to be on fire and was completely destroyed. The judge was standing among his neighbors watching the progress of the flames, when in reply to some words of condolence he said : \"Shall a man receive good at the hand of the Lord and shall he not receive evil?\" He was reticent in regard to his religious experiences and feelings, but his habit of daily prayer and his firm faith in the doctrines of Christ are well known, and precious legacies for those near and dear to him. Inheriting a constitution of remarkable vigor and elasticity, and always temperate and regular in his habits, he never had a serious illness, but grew feeble, and passed away in June, 1891, simply from length of years. His handsomely cut features had lost none of their beauty even at his advanced age, and were even more marked after death. Having survived all his own generation of relatives and friends, the sons of his cotemporaries bore him tenderly to his burial. Until a short time before he died his conversation had been as attractive, his voice as rich and melodious, his interest in life as keen as ever. His sympathies had been so warm and tender and his love for his friends so true and active, especially for young people and little children, that great sorrow followed his departure. For him may be repeated the words he inscribed on his father's monument in describing his life. \"Active and beneficent in manhood, serene in age, and tranquil and hopeful at its close.\" Judge McCurdy will be remembered as one of the most conscientious and upright of citizens, who combined all the charms of good breeding and a sound heart with the unassuming excellencies of a Christian gentleman.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 31, page iii\n\nAppointed Jude of the Supreme Court of Errors.

BORDEN ON THE OCCASION OF THE FINAL DAY OF CHIEF JUSTICE FRANCIS M. MCDONALD, JR., PRESIDING AS CHIEF JUSTICE\n\nJANUARY 17, 2001\n\n____________\n\nWelcome to all of you. Today we conclude a special chapter in the history of the Connecticut Supreme Court. On September 15, 1999, Francis M. McDonald, Jr., became this court's thirty-fifth chief justice. This morning marked the last time that he presided at oral argument, and as the senior associate justice on this court, it is my privilege, on behalf of all the chief justices colleague's, to honor his accomplishments.\n\nA warm welcome goes to Frank's wife, Mary, his sons, Michael and John, and his daughter, Mary Ann, as well as their spouses-Dee, Stephanie and Jim-and Frank's grandchildren-Maria, Anna, Erin, Brittany, and one on the way. We all know how much Frank's family means to him, and we are delighted that you are all here today to share in this tribute to him.\n\nFrank McDonald has dedicated his entire career to exemplary public service. After graduating magna cum laude from Holy Cross, he followed his father into the study of law, even managing to pass the bar exam six months prior to graduation from Yale Law School. After service as a special agent of the F.B.I., he joined the Untied States attorney's office. But, fortunately for the state of Connecticut, he decided that the state, rather than the federal, courts would have the benefit of his zealous advocacy. In 1961, he entered the state's prosecutorial service, first as an assistant prosecuting attorney, and then as chief prosecuting attorney, in the Circuit Court. Beginning in 1968, and for sixteen years thereafter, he served as the state's attorney at Waterbury. During that time, Frank successfully prosecuted some of Connecticut's highest profile and most controversial cases.\n\nIn 1984, he was nominated by Governor William O'Neill to be a Superior Court judge, and, at his swearing-in ceremony, Judge James Henebry observed that Frank McDonald had distinguished himself in practice in front of the bench and would do the same on it. And Judge McDonald did just that, serving with distinction as a trial judge for the next twelve years. Then, in 1996, Governor John Rowland nominated him to be a justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, and, on September 15, 1999, Justice McDonald assumed the office of chief justice.\n\nWhile on this bench Frank McDonald has been the author of some fifty-one majority opinions, as well as twenty-five concurring, sixty-seven dissenting, and twenty-three concurring and dissenting opinions-and we are still counting! His opinions are characteristically commonsensical, concise and to the point, and are often laced with pungent wit and historical references, and offer his unique and fresh viewpoint, and his keen sense of justice, on the vexing legal issues that we confront on this court.\n\nThree of his opinions of which he is most proud are State v. McDougal, Green v. General Dynamics Corp., and Branhaven Plaza, LLC v.Inland Wetlands Commission. In McDougal, then Justice McDonald held for the court that, under both the federal and state constitutions, because age groups are not subject to heightened scrutiny, they do not require special protection from peremptory jury challenges. In Green, Justice McDonald interpreted the Workers' Compensation Act to afford increased benefits to the widow of a former employee of General Dynamics who had died from cancer contracted from exposure to asbestos. In Branhaven Plaza, LLC, Chief Justice McDonald, writing for the court, interpreted our environmental protection statutes to preclude a developer from being permitted to destroy wetlands in exchange for unspecified money and services to be provided later to be governing local wetlands commission.\n\nBut, as we all know, the job of chief justice extends beyond the able leadership of the Supreme Court, to the administrative leadership of the Judicial Branch of our state government. During his tenure in this role, Chief Justice McDonald has made the reduction of the Superior Court caseload a major priority.\n\nConcerned by a backlog of murder cases in certain of our judicial districts, he undertook a successful reduction initiative by ordering the allocation of additional judges and resources to the most burdened of our criminal courts, those of Hartford, New Haven, and Bridgeport. He also has attacked the backlog of civil jury cases, and, as a first step, established a commission to engage in a thorough examination of the multifaceted process of civil caseflow, and to formulate commonsense approaches to the reduction of the civil case backlog.\n\nIn addition, as a result of legislation passed by the General Assembly and the vote of the citizens of Connecticut to eliminate the office of high sheriff, the Judicial Branch has assumed the responsibilities of court security and cellblock operations. Under the leadership of the chief justice, the immense task of incorporating the special deputy sheriffs into the Judicial Branch as judicial marshals has begun, and is progressing on course.\n\nThe chief justice also implemented the proposal, initiated by his predecessor, Chief Justice Callahan, to formulate a commission to study the attorney grievance process. Early in his stewardship of the branch, Chief Justice McDonald appointed members of the commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the grievance process and to recommend ways in which it could be improved. And we will soon be receiving the recommendations of that commission.\n\nRecognizing that a strong Judicial Branch requires a strong physical foundation, Chief Justice McDonald continued the ongoing capital building and improvement projects, including a new facility for the Appellate Court. He also established the New Haven County Courthouse Restoration Task Force, to oversee and execute the renovation of the neoclassical courthouse on Elm Street. As a tribute to the success of this endeavor, the courthouse has been designated an official project of Save America's Treasures, a partnership between the White House Millennium Council and the national Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nFrank, on behalf of your colleagues on this court and throughout the Judicial Branch, I congratulate you on your outstanding career-as a United States attorney, state's attorney, judge, justice, and chief justice. I know that you will enjoy an active and productive retirement.\n\nIn the coming years, may you continue to be surrounded by your loving family;\n\nMay you continue to serve the Branch and the people of the state as a judge trial referee;\n\nMay you find many mountains to ski, and many rivers, lakes and bays to navigate;\n\nAnd may those waters always be filled with a endless supply of hungry fish.\n\nAnd now, the court grants Chief Justice Francis M McDonald, Jr., a few moments for a brief rebuttal argument.\n\nREMARKS BY CHIEF JUSTICE FRANCIS M. McDONALD, JR., ON HIS LAST DAY PRESIDING ON THE SUPREME COURT JANUARY 17, 2001\n\n____________\n\nI thank Dave Borden for his kind remarks.\n\nI thank the people of Connecticut for the opportunity to be of public service, Governors O'Neill and Rowland, and the General Assembly.\n\nOur work product on this court are opinions affecting the lives and rights of all our citizens. It is, therefore, an awesome responsibility to undertake writing these decisions. The writing itself of the opinions is demanding work involving concentration. It is not like the work of Hollywood writers described by a movie mogul in these terms, \"What's all this business about being a writer? It's just putting one word after another.\"\n\nThe mural on the wall behind this bench shows Reverend Thomas Hooker preaching to the earliest settlers of Connecticut, who drew up the first written constitution on our shores. Those Fundamental Orders are the model for the form of government established in this country, a government answering to the people. In the spirit of giving thanks for this \"Heaven rescued land,\" I give thanks for all of you for your support and good company. To Mary. To Mike, Mary Ann and John. To Dee, Jim and Stephanie. To Maria, Anna, Erin, Brittany and one to be announced. To friends and colleagues of many years and not so many years. To the excellent staff of the court and Branch and to friends across the street at the state capitol.\n\nAll I can really say is thanks.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 239, page iii\n\nAppointed to the Supreme Court April 30, 1996, to take effect September 1, 1996.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 250, page iii\n\nChief Justice effective September 15, 1999.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 255, page iii\n\nRetired January 22, 2001, under constitutional limitation as to age.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 132, pages 706 - 709\n\nJudge Frank P. McEvoy, who died June 24, 1945, was born in Waterbury on November 12, 1878, the son of Finton and Mary (Lawlor) McEvoy. Both parents died during his infancy, and he spent much of his early childhood in New Haven with his uncle, the Reverend Patrick P. Lawlor, who was the pastor of St. Mary's Church on Hillhouse Avenue. Later he lived in Waterbury and was graduated from the Waterbury High School and St. Francis Xavier College, New York City.\n\nOn June 29, 1909, he married Gertrude G. Guilfoile, of Waterbury, who was the daughter of Michael and Katherine (Lawlor) Guilfoile and who, with an adopted son, Vincent, survives him.\n\nJudge McEvoy was a member of the Mattatuck council of the Boy Scouts of America, the bishop of Hartford's Scout Committee, the advisory board of Albertus Magnus College of New Haven, and the Waterbury Country Club. He was also a member of the Waterbury, State and American Bar Associations. He was a devout member and trustee of the Blessed Sacrament Church of Waterbury, a sponsor and the first chairman of the Boy Scout troop of his parish, and a member and former president of the Holy Name Society.\n\nWhen a very young man he had been an ardent bicyclist, and his first real business experience was gained when he opened an establishment in Waterbury with his brother Martin for the sale and repair of bicycles. This work cultivated a natural aptitude for mechanical things and was a successful business venture. The automobile, then almost a toy, attracted Judge McEvoy's attention, and about the year 1902 he purchased a Pierce Motorette in Buffalo from the George N. Pierce Company, which subsequently acquired a wide reputation as the manufacturer of the Pierce Arrow car. Garages and automobile repair shops were then unknown, and Judge McEvoy, with characteristic thoroughness, went to Buffalo and spent several weeks working in the Pierce factory, where he acquired a clear understanding of the design, operation, care and repair of the Pierce car. It was his intention at that time to enter the automobile business in Waterbury, but he became ill with typhoid fever. During the several weeks in which he lay prostrated by this sickness, his many activities were necessarily interrupted and he had an opportunity for thought and introspection which ended in his determination to become a lawyer.\n\nSoon after his recovery, he entered the Yale School of Law, and was graduated, the vice president of his class, in 1907. At Yale he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal and a member of the class day committee and belonged to Corbey Court. He passed the bar examinations next after graduation and in July, 1907, began the practice of law in Waterbury. For several years he was associated in practice with Francis P. Guilfoile, who later was corporation counsel of the city of Waterbury and for four terms its mayor. This practice in Waterbury continued until Judge McEvoy's appointment to the Superior Court. On May 23, 1927, Judge McEvoy was appointed a member of the commission to revise the General Statutes of Connecticut, which produced the Revision of 1930. About two years later, on June 25, 1929, he was appointed a member of the charter commission of Waterbury. Again, in 1937, he was appointed by the governor a member of a special commission to study the problem of compulsory financial responsibility for motor vehicle operators. Each of these appointments made heavy demands upon his time and strength.\n\nOn June 5, 1930, he was appointed, by a Republican governor, a judge of the Superior Court to fill the vacancy caused by the death, on June 1, 1930, of Judge L. P. Waldo Marvin. On January 30, 1931, he was reappointed for the full term of eight years. His death occurred less than two years before the expiration of his second full term appointment, and he had become the senior judge of the Superior Court in years of service.\n\nFrom his admission to the bar he manifested the traits of industry, scholarship, careful preparation and facile presentation which were to bring him a steadily increasing business as a lawyer, especially in the field of trial work. His practice had become such that his abandonment of it to become a judge of the Superior Court entailed a real financial sacrifice. But to him judicial office presented an opportunity for added service, from the acceptance of which no mercenary considerations would deter him. At his death he lacked but a few days of fifteen full years as a judge, and the esteem in which he was held approved his choice in taking up a judicial career.\n\nJudge McEvoy was a man of many interests, and his boundless energy impelled him to put all of his time to definite purpose.\n\nHis love of his fellow men found expression in his work in connection with the probation system and juvenile delinquency. About ten years prior to his death he was designated by his fellow judges as the supervisor of probation in the Superior Court. This required a great amount of labor in addition to his regular work as a judge, but such was his enthusiasm for and confidence in the system of probation as an instrumentality for the redemption of human beings that he gave generously of his time in carrying out his duties in this connection. The many detailed reports which were required by the efficient system which he organized he eagerly studied and mastered, and under his guidance the system of probation in the Superior Court developed to the efficient service which it is today.\n\nHe was also the first judge of the Superior Court to be especially designated to hear appeals from the juvenile court. Here perhaps more than anywhere else was brought to the front his deep love of children and young people, and his sympathy with their problems and those confronting their parents and others charged with their care and training. In blazing the trail in this work, his understanding of young people was, and in the future will continue to be, of incalculable benefit to the people of the state.\n\nThe knowledge of tools and mechanical things which he had acquired as a young man remained with him, and he had a well-equipped workshop in his garage. A true handy man, he made all sorts of small repairs and improvements around his residence. This interest was but a small manifestation in a single direction of the great affection for his home and his family which was so obvious to the many friends who were the recipients of his gracious hospitality.\n\nHe was sensitive to beauty and to the wonders of nature. He loved the out-of-doors for its own sake and not merely in connection with the pursuit of some specific activity. In his travels through the West, in Canada, and in Europe, he had the companionship of his wife, to whom he was very devoted. Together they greatly enjoyed horseback riding and walking through the beautiful country around Waterbury and the Naugatuck Valley, and both were enthusiastic devotees of golf.\n\nAlthough he was active in the Democratic party until his ascension to the bench, he neither sought nor accepted public office. When he became a judge he forthwith ceased all political activity, and his political detachment upon assuming judicial office was genuine and sincere.\n\nPartly perhaps as a result of his early life with his uncle in New Haven, but principally because of his innate religious convictions, he was a devout communicant of the Roman Catholic church. He was one of those fortunate persons to whom religion was no mere empty formalism. He felt sure of his religion and found in it not only solace and comfort but also guidance and strength with which to answer the call of duty and meet the buffetings of adversity. It is hardly possible to conceive of a layman more thoroughly imbued with his religion than Judge McEvoy, or more devoted to its principles. And yet he was no bigot. He had no smug self-satisfaction which excluded from his friendship and loyal affection those who had not come to see religion through his eyes or who failed to worship at his church. His hand was outstretched to all to whom he could bring aid or comfort, and he did not pause to inquire the race, faith, creed or political persuasion of anyone whom he thought in need of help which he could give.\n\nIt is impossible to draw an adequate word portrait of this earnest, versatile man within the proper limits of a sketch of this type. A summary of his character was attempted in the following excerpt from a resolution adopted by his fellow judges of the Superior Court at their meeting on September 24, 1945: \"Be it\n\nResolved, That the judges of the Superior Court express their deep sorrow at the death of Judge Frank P. McEvoy, of Waterbury, on June 24, 1945. From his appointment to the bench on June 5, 1930, until he was stricken by an illness which but a few days later proved fatal, his indefatigable industry and sound legal scholarship commanded the respect of bench and bar alike, while his sparkling wit, ever tempered by a warm heart, contributed to a delightful personality which won the real affection of all with whom he came in contact.\n\n\"Just, patient and humane in his conduct both on and off the bench, in his death Connecticut lost an outstanding judge.\"\n\n*Prepared by Hon John Hamilton King, of Willimantic.\n\nAs Printed in the Connecticut Reports, volume 155, pages 737 - 739\n\nAny summary of the life of Judge Thomas J. Molloy which fails to refer to his open-handed generosity will not be complete. One of his outstanding characteristics was his love of charitable giving. \"Charity\" to him was a Biblical mandate directed by God. Thus, to any, to all and to everyone in need, he gave not only financial aid to the best of his ability but also his time, energy, strength, advice, and even of the wisdom he possessed so abundantly.\n\nHe was modest and unassuming, slow to anger and slow to condemn; he had faith in God and in the inherent goodness of man. Yet, he had the strength of character which marks all good men and which fitted him for his judicial tasks. Faced with a difficult problem, he welcomed it and saw it through with unyielding tenacity. Old age failed to blunt his keen mind, which remained clear and vigorous to the end. He was uncompromisingly opposed to all which was sham, unfair or wrong.\n\nBlessed with resounding voice and capable of presenting a stern mien at times, he enjoyed appearing somewhat unbending - knowing that the right word at the right time would puncture and deflate the balloon of his pretended ferocity. He had a rich sense of humor and loved to laugh, quite often even at himself. To represent his character as all sweetness and light would, of course, be an exaggeration. There were days when \"the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to\" sank their shafts deeply into his robust constitution, and he reacted as most human beings react to pain. Of all the human beings I have known, he was the most human, as well as the most humane.\n\nIn his later years, Judge Molloy developed some unique and endearing habits, one being that of whistling as he walked along the corridor to, or from, a hearing. Long before he could be seen, he could be heard, whistling a modified and invariably off-key rendition of whatever tune he had in mind, alternating mainly between \"The Rose of Tra-Lee\" and \"Gloria in Excelsis Deo.\" It delighted him to corner a passerby and inquire of him the name of the tune he had been whistling. Seldom did the involuntary participant guess correctly, which always pleased the judge, causing him to chuckle and deplore the listener's sad lack of musical knowledge.\n\nHe was the proud possessor of a number of canes, one of his favorites being a handsome stick which had belonged to the late John Barrymore and which, in the manner of \"Bat Masterson,\" the judge would sometimes shake menacingly at anyone he liked very much.\n\nAt Christmas time, he not only remembered his relatives, friends, neighbors, fellow employees, janitors, paperboy and milkman but practically everyone who casually crossed his path. He sent contributions far and wide: to India, Africa and South America, and to the American Indians on their reservations. To the pastors of Catholic flocks in various parts of the world he sent donations, for his religion, in which he deeply believed, was as much a part of him as his integrity. It was a source of strength and comfort to him all his life. It is not an exaggeration to predict that people all over the earth will miss Judge Molloy's kindly hand next Christmas, for it will be the first time in years that the mail will fail to bring some offering from him to help them carry on their work. He believed wholeheartedly in supporting his faith, and he did so. There were no halfway measures with Judge Molloy, and it was never necessary for anyone to guess whether he was for or against him.\n\nA matter particularly dear to Judge Molloy's heart was the connection which existed between his father, Daniel T. Molloy, and Mark Twain, for whom the judge's father had worked as a gardener years ago when Twain lived on Farmington Avenue in what is now the Mark Twain Memorial. The judge's father was eventually obliged to leave Twain's employ because of ill health in 1886, when Judge Molloy was one year old. The great writer gave Daniel Molloy $100 as a gift to enable him to return to Ireland to regain his health. In those days, $100 was a small fortune and undoubtedly represented feelings of friendship and affection.\n\nIn June, 1967, Judge Molloy made a substantial contribution to the Mark Twain Memorial restoration fund, a gift which he had long wanted to make out of gratitude for Twain's generosity to his father.\n\nA hard worker, Judge Molloy was meticulous and dependable. On the morning of the day which he entered the hospital for the operation which preceded his death, he participated in a committee conference with two fellow referees, so it is fair to say that he worked right up to the last, in his eighty-third year, a remarkable and inspiring achievement.\n\nIn short, in this world where the synthetic has come to pass more and more frequently for the genuine, Judge Molloy was a real man and worthy of the respect of his office.\n\nBorn on June 29, 1885, in Hartford, he was the son of Daniel T. and Mary Killeen Molloy. He attended Hartford Public High School and was graduated in 1908 from Yale Law School. In 1921, he was appointed to the Court of Common Pleas by the late Governor Everett Lake, and in 1946 he was appointed by Governor Raymond E. Baldwin to the Superior Court, where he served on that bench until his retirement under constitutional limitation as to age on June 29, 1955. After retirement in 1955, he became an active state referee, busier than ever, continuing to hold numerous hearings during the subsequent twelve years. He rarely took a vacation but worked steadily through summer and winter alike. In addition to serving on the bench and as an active referee, he taught for twenty-four years at what is now the University of Connecticut School of Law, formerly the Hartford Law School.\n\nHe was a prominent Catholic layman, devoting his spare time to religious activities, serving as State Deputy and Grand Knight of the Hartford Council during his forty-seven years as a member of the Knights of Columbus. He enjoyed the high honor of being made a Knight of St. Gregory and served as a director of Hartford Council 11, Knights of Columbus and of Bishop McMahon Assembly Fourth Degree. He also belonged to the Sierra Club of Hartford, the Holy Family Layman's Retreat League and the Men of LaSalette, as well as to the American, Connecticut and Hartford County Bar Associations.\n\nThe cataract operations, for which he entered the hospital, were successful, but Judge Molloy never again enjoyed the blessing of clear sight. During the early morning hours of Thursday, December 21, 1967, he passed away, leaving his family and friends poorer for his passing.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Esther Radding Molloy, of West Hartford, and by his three children of that marriage: Marshall E. Molloy, Paul W. Molloy, and Mary Esther Molloy. Two children of his prior marriage to Kathleen E. Hartnett, deceased, also survive him: Thomas J. Molloy Jr., of Wapping, and Mrs. Charles A. Rogers, Jr., of Newington. He left one brother, Daniel G. Molloy, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and seven grandchildren.\n\n*Prepared by Hon. Abraham S. Bordon, of West Hartford."
