There are many pathways open to UA members, thanks to the wide variety of training and education programs open to all. Choose what suits you best.\n\nLearn More\n\nSocial Media\n\nNews and activities from UA members all across North America.\n\nUnited Association\n\nUNITED ASSOCIATION SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY Revised January 25, 2021 The United Association’s social media accounts were established to communicate news and other information to UA members, their families and other stakeholders. On sites such as Facebook, the UA has opted to allow comments on its posts so that members have the opportunity to share their perspectives with the UA and their brothers and sisters across North America. In exchange, we expect members, and other users, to refrain from posting anything on UA social media that: • Is discriminatory, hateful, harassing or threatening; • Is obscene, profane or vulgar; • Violates copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights; • Is defamatory or invades a person’s privacy; • Constitutes spamming or trolling; • Is off-topic, i.e., unrelated to the original post; • Includes advertising or solicitation; • Advocates for or against candidates for union office; or • Attacks the UA as an institution or discloses proprietary, confidential or other information that interferes with the performance of its legal or contractual obligations. The UA will block or restrict the access of users who violate this policy and remove the offending content. In the case of a more serious violation, such as a threat of physical violence, internal union charges, contacts with law enforcement, and/or other action may also be pursued. Communications to the UA through UA social media shall in no way constitute a legal or official notice or comment to the UA. In addition, UA members seeking assistance from the UA should contact the UA General Office by letter, email or phone—and not through social media. In order to keep UA social media current, all UA social media posts will be removed after 90 days. A final note to UA members: the ground rules in this policy represent only minimum standards of conduct on social media. Please remember that your words and deeds often reflect on your union and fellow members. We are all stewards of a proud UA tradition, and it is up to each and every one of us to represent it well, on the job site, in the community, and on social media.\n\nUnited AssociationAugust 27, 2024 at 7:09am\n\nYou can tell a lot about someone by the friends they keep.\n\nUnited AssociationAugust 26, 2024 at 7:02am\n\nHappy #WomensEqualityDay!
