        "text": "While many are focusing on the Presidential Election or the local school board and parcel tax elections, Proposition 30 may have the single greatest impact locally, not just on K-12 education but also higher education.\n\nA complication is a competing tax measure from Molly Munger. Most analysts downplayed the impact when polls showed that the wealthy attorney Molly Munger, who has spent more than $30 million on her campaign, was only getting in the low 40s in support as opposed to 51 percent for Proposition 30.\n\nBut that calculus is being turned on its head as Ms. Munger launched an attack at on the governor’s measure calling the governor’s campaign “misleading” and she said in an interview with the the Sacramento Bee that the Proposition 30 campaign was “pursuing an ‘impostor strategy’ by claiming the mantle of boosting school funding and sidestepping Sacramento politicians.”\n\nThe LA Times reported on Thursday, that one of Molly Munger’s closest allies called for a truce between the two sides.\n\nThe Times reported, “Carol Kocivar, president of the California State PTA, said Brown and Munger should meet sometime next week ‘to reach agreement on ways to de-escalate the recent situation.’ “\n\n“We are deeply concerned about the escalation of back-and-forth political maneuvering, personal attacks, and accusations and reactions in the press from both Proposition 30 and 38 proponents about the latest TV ads,” Ms. Kocivar said. “All of us need to take a step back.”\n\nHowever, the Position 30 campaign dismissed the call.\n\n“Why would we meet with her?” said Dan Newman, a spokesman for the campaign. “We’re minding our own business, running a positive campaign and not mentioning any other initiative — while she’s spending millions in false attack ads against us.”\n\nMs. Munder’s campaign said “Molly would be happy to meet with Governor Brown.” However, the Times reported, “Spokesman Nathan Ballard said Munger would not drop her advertising critical of Proposition 30.”\n\nYes, that is the same Nathan Ballard who worked on the Measure X campaign ion Davis before going to San Francisco to work as former Mayor Gavin Newsom’s spokesperson.\n\n“If the Prop 30 campaign takes down their misleading ads, then we would certainly consider taking down our ad responding to them,” he said.\n\nAll of this has led the Sacramento Bee this morning, in a scathing editorial, to opine, “Munger’s attack on Jerry Brown’s initiative could kill both.”\n\n“No one should doubt that Los Angeles civil rights attorney Molly Munger is passionate about improving public schools in California,” said the editorial noting her $31 million to promote Proposition 38 which would raise income taxes by about $10 billion a year to fund schools. “That’s all within the bounds of the California initiative process, in which wealthy interests and philanthropists propose initiatives and try to convince voters of the wisdom of their concepts.”\n\nWhat they call troubling is the fact that “Munger has spent an additional $3 million to attack Proposition 30, Gov. Jerry Brown’s initiative to raise taxes by $6 billion a year to fund a variety of state services, schools among them.”\n\nThe Bee writes, “While it’s not ideal tax policy, Proposition 30 is the linchpin of Brown’s plan to place California on less shaky financial ground.\n\n“Without it, the governor and Democratic legislators have said, they will have no choice but to cut another $6 billion from the state budget. Public schools and the public university system would face the harshest cuts.”\n\n“Recent polling showed Proposition 30 was ahead narrowly. But voters hate to raise taxes, even if taxpayers other than themselves are the ones who would pay those taxes,” the Bee continues. “If Munger persists in funding the ad criticizing Proposition 30, she almost certainly will sink Brown’s measure.”\n\nIn addition to the PTA, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson is a prominent supporter of the Munger Initiative. Mr. Torlakson called on Munger to cease the attack.\n\nThe Bee writes, “As The Bee said in an editorial on Sunday, Proposition 38 would be worth considering in another year. The $10 billion earmarked for public schools certainly is enticing. However, the state has many needs. Proposition 30 would help meet those needs by starting to pay down the state’s bond debt, and funding criminal justice realignment, while also providing some money for public schools.”\n\nThey add, “If Munger persists in her strategy of attacking Proposition 30, Brown’s allies will feel compelled to go after Proposition 38, which already trails in public polling. Munger needs to step back from the brink.”\n\n“Brown needs to do whatever he can to help make that happen. This murder-suicide will help no one, least of all the kids both sides claim to want to help,” they add.\n\nThe bottom line is that, while districts like Davis are asking its employees to take concessions, those in the position to help the district are engaging in ego wars. This is not going to help anyone.\n\nRemember, regardless of what happens in Measure E – if Proposition 30 goes down, our schools will take at least a six-month hit. And that battle for concessions is one of the most heated in this election cycle.\n\n—David M. Greenwald reporting\n\nCategories:"
