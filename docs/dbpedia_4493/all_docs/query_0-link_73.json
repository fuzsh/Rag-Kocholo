Most of our classes are four to six weeks long and meet once a week for 1-1/2 or 2 hours. Our volunteer instructors are motivated by their desire to share their knowledge and facilitate thoughtful discussions on academic topics.\n\n​\n\nWe have two semesters: Fall and Winter/Spring.\n\nDavidsonLearns is excited to offer a fascinating selection of in-person courses in both our traditional format and our shorter mini-course format. Before registering for any of these courses, you must have a DavidsonLearns account and be a current DavidsonLearns member. We encourage you to take care of both of these requirements now in order to avoid a delay when you register. If you need to create an account or become a DavidsonLearns member (or renew your membership), click here.\n\n​\n\nIf you would like to take a course that is full, please add your name to the waitlist, and we will contact you if a seat becomes available. Please do not contact the instructor directly.\n\nFranz Kafka, arguably the most influential author of the 20th century, died 100 years ago this year. During this \"Kafka-Year,\" we will read all of Kafka's major works, selections from his diaries and letters, and some secondary readings. This course will be offered parallel to a Davidson College seminar with the same readings and schedule, meeting roughly every other week from late August through early December. The two groups will meet together on a few occasions. The Davidson College students will present their semester work at a formal literary soirée in early December, with DavidsonLearns students invited to attend.\n\nRequired and Suggested Materials\n\nFor the specific texts and editions and how to get them, as well as some more details on reading Kafka together, see the course website.\n\n​\n\nThe instructor urges purchasing from Main Street Books to ensure that everyone is reading the same edition and to support our local independent bookstore.\n\nLooking for a new way to understand the strange and contradictory behavior of others, not to mention your own? This one-session workshop will provide a perspective you may not have considered: the profound influence of an individual’s \"approach to life.\" Based on data from original research in the fields of adult development and psychology, the instructor and a colleague identified seven distinct \"approach to life\" personality types and labeled them with easily understood sports metaphors. For example, do you approach life like a \"lap swimmer,\" becoming expert at what you do as you stay in your lane but resisting changing lanes? Each personality type exhibits both healthy and unhealthy attributes, and these can lead to contradictory behavior. Course participants will identify their own dominant personality type using the Approach to Life Inventory (ALI) and will learn how that personality type responds to challenges, hopes, fears, and change.\n\nWhat do the pricing of soft drinks and police interrogation of criminal suspects have in common? What is the best strategy for winning a game of chicken? What can politicians learn from new car dealers? The field of game theory offers insight for answering these and other questions. This course introduces students to basic elements of game theory and its applications to business, economics, and public policy. Among the topics covered are zero-sum games, the prisoners’ dilemma, and Nash Equilibrium. The course assumes no prior knowledge of game theory, but the material is somewhat technical.\n\nThis two-session mini-course will be led by the staff of the Davidson College Archives, Special Collections & Community Department. In the first session, students will learn how to explore and access the department’s notable and unique resources about town and college history, including oral histories, local publications, scrapbooks, and photographs. The second session will be workshop-style, and students will receive training on how to use the provided archival supplies to preserve a selection of their own family records. At the end of the course, students will be able to conduct their own research on local history topics. In addition, they will understand how to protect their own records to share their story with their families and how to contribute to our larger understanding of Davidson’s past, present, and future.\n\nNovember is Men’s Health month, aka Movember or \"no shave November.\" The Movember Foundation seeks to change the \"face of men’s health\" by encouraging men to know more about common health conditions; screening, treatment, and prevention of male-specific cancers; mental health disorders; and suicide. This 2-hour mini-course will touch on the Foundation's goals, as well as factors contributing to male identity, dysfunction, and andropause (male menopause). Most of our discussion will focus on prostate enlargement (BPH) and prostate cancer, issues that most men will face over their lifetimes. The instructor – a physician, educator, researcher, and patient facilitator – will share his experiences and the latest medical advances. Participants will be encouraged to think and act holistically when confronted with such issues, to be their own best advocate, and to learn what to do when they need help. The course is open to all, regardless of gender.\n\nThis course will provide background on key aspects of the pharmacology of opioids, along with facts highlighting the extent of the crisis. For example, of the 108,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2023, roughly 81,000 were attributed to opioids, which is a decrease from 2022. We will discuss how Oxycontin marketing led to more Americans using opioids. Then, we will look at four phases that mark the opioid crisis – opioid prescription, heroin use, fentanyl use, and the use of fentanyl mixed with other drugs. The ever-changing drug landscape includes newer illicit drugs (e.g., medetomidine, xylazine, and benzimidazole opioids) that create additional concerns. The instructor will share his family loss and practical suggestions to limit the drug problem at the community level.\n\n​\n\nThis course will be primarily lecture, but it will include some group participation.\n\nAt some time in our lives, most of us are challenged by circumstances of loss, crisis, or trauma. It is important to recognize in ourselves and others the signs and symptoms of each and develop an understanding of how to cope. This knowledge gives us and those we love an opportunity for growth and transformation. The content of the course is based on psychological research and the instructor’s years of clinical experience. Participants in this workshop will (1) examine the similarities and differences between loss, crisis, and trauma, (2) learn coping mechanisms for managing each, and (3) create rituals and rhythms that restore a sense of equilibrium and well-being.\n\nThe Charlotte region (Mecklenburg and surrounding counties) is one of the fastest growing areas in the United States. Using the instructor’s personal experience working directly with regional city, town, and county governments – along with information from the archives of the UNC Charlotte Urban Institute – we’ll explore the history of the region. We will examine Charlotte’s explosive growth and the issues stemming from that growth: jobs, housing, crime, education, and transportation. We’ll also look at historical patterns in the surrounding counties and the way outlying areas connect to Charlotte. As tourism plays a major role in the region’s economy, we’ll discuss what there is to see and do in the metropolis.\n\nThis course will be primarily lecture, but it will include some group participation.\n\nDoes globalization help world trade by making it cheaper, faster, better, and/or safer? What is the historical context for globalization and world trade, including its benefits and costs? How have the pandemic, geopolitics, demographics, economics, and supply chain issues disrupted and changed globalization? What is the future of globalization? Has a new era begun? What are the geopolitics of China vs. the West (including the US)? We will explore these issues through lectures and some group discussion.\n\nDon Quijote* has been labeled the first and the greatest European novel because it combines the protagonist’s wild adventures with meditations on heroism, examples of sanity and insanity, explorations of love, Renaissance poetry, pastoral novels, and literary criticism.\n\nWe will discuss the most significant chapters of the Quijote of 1605, covering the knight’s well-known adventures, his relationship with Sancho Panza, and his adoration of Dulcinea. We will highlight chapters dealing with Cervantes’ biography and societal conflicts in 16th-century Spain. While enjoying the comical aspects of Don Quijote’s misperceptions, we will learn to treasure Cervantes’ masterpiece for its psychological and philosophical depth and its insights into 17th-century history.\n\n* Quixote is the English spelling; modern Spanish spells the word with a \"j.\"\n\nThis course is a series of linked, student-chosen investigations into the art, science, and business of fragrance. Among the possible topics are the insights about scent offered by literature, religion, chemistry, biology, psychology, history, and marketing. Our goal is to develop a vocabulary that help us understand the marvelously evocative and behavior-modifying aspects of this exceptionally elusive sense. Each class will conclude with attention to (1) the horticultural needs of one unusual fragrant plant we can grow locally but usually don’t and/or (2) the history and chemistry behind the most iconic perfumes of the 20th century.\n\nPeople with allergies to perfumes or essential oils should indicate this in the registration process.\n\nSamuel Coleridge wrote that poetry is \"the best words in the best order.\" With this in mind, class conversations will focus on selected published poems, material the instructor provides, and students’ own poems to help all participants find \"the best words in the best order.\" Whether you are an experienced poet or a novice, the class activities will enhance the development of your own writing through the lens of selected poets and class feedback. Poems will be from the work of W. H. Auden, Robert Frost, W. S. Merwin, John Balaban, Eleanor Wilner, Jamal May, Betty Adcock, Marilyn Nelson, Claudia Emerson, and others. Bring your poems to share with fellow poets – a tried-and-true method to find out what is working in your poems and what may need to be re-examined. Fellow writers are often the best and most careful readers.\n\nThe delivery of an effective, equitable system to protect and provide the health of the American people is a great challenge. The clamor about accessibility, affordability, and accountability cries out for evolution, if not revolution, of our current system. This course reviews the origins and concepts of the American health care system, the stakeholders of the system, and the emerging strategies being proposed to improve the system. Some of those strategies/goals include disease prevention, cost containment (medical services, pharmaceuticals, insurance rates), and universal coverage vs. Medicare for All. These themes will be prominent in the political dialogue for the 2024 general election.\n\nThis course will be primarily lecture, but it will include some group participation.\n\nA significant aspect of human society is the practice of establishing certain places/locations as valued centers of faithful experience. In the pluralistic environment of religion in America, there are almost as many \"sacred spaces\" as there are varieties of spiritual commitment. This course identifies and seeks to interpret some of those places. After using texts and media to explore several sacred locales throughout the US with the instructor, students will be encouraged to choose and interpret other places that function as sacred in our society and to share them with classmates.\n\nMaestro, 2023's wonderful Oscar-nominated biography of Leonard Bernstein, brings back to the fore one of the most important American musical personalities of the 20th century. In two hours, it was able to touch on the highlights of this remarkable man, but there is so much more to unpack! We'll take a deeper dive into the fascinating life of Bernstein the conductor, the composer, the pianist, the media star, and the family man.\n\nIn the Federalist Papers, America's Founders imagined a democratic republic with safeguards against the rise of demagogues who might stir up the \"prejudices,\" \"intemperate passions,\" and \"fluctuations\" of the popular will. By the late 19th century, however, new media and new strains of popular discourse began to undermine those safeguards, as various political movements and even the government itself resorted to deceptive and manipulative forms of persuasion.\n\nIn this course, we will explore the ethical and practical distinctions between persuasion – an essential tool of democratic governance – and propaganda in a series of historical case studies, beginning with the \"Calamity Howlers\" of the late 1890s and concluding with 9/11 and the War on Terror. Along the way, we'll encounter figures such as Teddy Roosevelt, Huey Long, Joseph McCarthy, George W. Bush, Donald Trump, and others. In the process, we’ll learn to recognize, analyze, and critique unethical, deceitful, and/or manipulative forms of communication with a view toward becoming more critical consumers in the \"marketplace of ideas.\"\n\nThis course will be primarily lecture, but it will include some group participation.\n\nEver realize that you have a priceless slice of the past to donate to the future? You do – it’s called the story of your life. In this course, we will tap our memories to chronicle the vivid lessons and life experiences that molded us into who we are. Funny, poignant, heroic, or embarrassing, our lives are a bundle of stories that deserve to be recorded either as a private exercise or as a gift to future family generations. This dynamic workshop will release the not-to-be forgotten tales of your life on earth.\n\nStudents will explore the musical genre of Traditional Music through instructor lectures, discussions with performing artists, and attendance at four Traditional Music concerts at Davidson College. The first class, one week before the first concert, will introduce the genre and provide background on all the artists. A day or two before each concert, there will be a preparatory session in which students will learn more about the artists and their context within the genre. On the day of the concert, the class will meet for 45 minutes with the artists, who will give examples of what to expect in the upcoming performance.\n\n​\n\nNote that the course spans both semesters, but registration will occur only in the Fall.\n\n​\n\nCourse Introduction\n\nMonday, September 23, 3:00 PM – 4:15 PM\n\nConcert 1 Background Lecture: A Panoply of European Folk Instruments\n\nWednesday, September 25, 3:00 PM – 4:15 PM\n\nConcert 1: John Doyle and Irish-American Masters\n\nMonday, September 30, 4:00 PM – 4:45 PM meet-the-artists session and 7:30 PM concert\n\n​\n\nOur season opens with an Irish extravaganza, John Doyle’s Irish-American Music Masters, five wonderful musicians with shared Irish-American roots, led by the Grammy-nominated John Doyle. He will be joined by vocalist Cathie Ryan, Irish flutist Seamus Egan, John Williams on accordion and concertina, and Ivan Goff on Uilleann pipes. This is truly an all-star tour of five renowned Irish soloists coming together for a tour of the US.\n\n​\n\nJohn Doyle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVyB831ZKIg\n\nCathie Ryan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBSK_zA04uw\n\nSeamus Egan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWqPcItnGME\n\nJohn Williams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slBTZsvoR7k\n\nIvan Goff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAIKOUAQO-Q\n\n​\n\nConcert 2 Background Lecture: Synthesizing Two Disparate Musical Languages\n\nTuesday, November 5, 3:00 PM – 4:15 PM\n\n​​\n\nConcert 2: Larry and Joe\n\nWednesday, November 6, 4:00 PM – 4:45 PM meet-the-artist session and 7:30 PM concert\n\n​\n\nOur November 6 event focuses on Latin/Appalachian connections, with the great duo of Larry Bellorin and Joe Troop, known simply as Larry and Joe. Joe Troop, a Grammy-nominated Old-time and Bluegrass banjoist who spent over a decade in South America exploring Appalachian and South American connections, has joined with Larry Bellorin, a Venezuelan master on guitar, cuatro, and harp. It will be one of the most distinct virtuoso performances that the Traditional Music Series has produced, alternating between two countries and cultures.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr4fB8zBg5k\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NiXVLMza6s&list=RDEMM0p5iqegOp6uKSjA7S6u8w&start_radio=1\n\n​\n\nPhotography was past its infancy by the Civil War, when the field of photojournalism blossomed, documenting through the camera's lens the most consequential and astonishing events of the times. We will look at the greatest news photography of three centuries, the photos that brought the world's events to living rooms and many that would revolutionize the world in ways big and small, from Antietam to charming portraiture to the \"special operation\" in Ukraine. Some images we will view of conflict and disaster contain strong content.\n\nThis course will be primarily lecture, but it will include some group participation.\n\nMeet the 10 greatest spies in the post-World War II era, including Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and others you may never have heard of: turncoat FBI and CIA agents, Soviet officers (one called the \"$2 Billion Spy,\" whose data on Soviet radar saved the US military research costs), and two beguiling women whose demure manners gave them entrée to a trove of information priceless to their governments. We will share intrepid tales worthy of James Bond, and – alas, more than once – Inspector Clouseau.\n\nThis course will be primarily lecture, but it will include some group participation.\n\nWhat do such disparate works as Namibian cave paintings, pointillist Georges Seurat, impressionist Claude Monet, and modernist Mark Rothko have in common? Color. How we see color brings our experience of these very different styles of art together, and each artist expresses more than color by taking advantage of how we see. Similarly, surrealist Salvador Dalí and Claude Monet both use spatial frequency to direct the viewer’s experience of their art in different ways.\n\nThis course will highlight these and other aspects of early visual processing, explaining the cognitive science behind famous works of art. Links to specific works of art (2-4 per session) will be available in advance, so students can study them before each class. As students progress through this course, not only will they discover a different way to look at paintings, they also will learn more about the human visual system.\n\n​\n\nThis course will be primarily lecture, but it will include some group participation.\n\nRequired Materials\n\nThere are no required readings, but students should look at the following pieces of art in advance of the class session.\n\nSession 1: Introduction\n\nIndefinite Divisibility. Yves Tanguy.\n\nThe Toilet of Venus. Diego Velasquez.\n\nSession 2: Color\n\nA Sunday on la Grande Jatte. Georges Seurat\n\nOchre and Red on Red. Mark Rothko\n\nWater Lilies. Claude Monet\n\nNamibia rock art\n\nSession 3: Spatial Frequency\n\nThe Four Trees. Claude Monet\n\nDisappearing Bust of Voltaire. Salvador Dalí\n\nLook for \"Disappearing Bust of Voltaire\" under \"Paintings\" tab\n\nMona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci\n\nThere’s a short movie opening, and then you can zoom in and out using +/- buttons at lower right\n\nSession 4: Faces & Bodies\n\nPortrait de Dora Maar. Pablo Picasso\n\nVertumnus. Giuseppe Arcimboldo\n\nMadame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau). John Singer Sargent\n\nNapoleon I on His Imperial Throne. Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres\n\nSession 5: Attention\n\nThe Oxbow. Thomas Cole\n\nChinese landscape (no title). Gong Xian\n\nNew York, 1911. George Bellows\n\n…And the Home of the Brave. Charles Demuth\n\nThe First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins, and England’s wealth was shattered. Europe ceased to be the center of the world, as leadership passed to the United States in the west and Japan in the east. From the Euro-Asian territories of the old Russia Empire, a colossus arose: The Soviet Union. Peace was not permanent; instead, it led to a twenty-year truce, after which the world witnessed another cataclysmic conflict. This course will cover the causes, the fighting, and the peace treaties of The Great War.\n\nThis lunch-and-learn course will feature Tyler Starr’s exhibition, Tales of the Futures, and an artmaking workshop. After an introduction to the Van Every/Smith Galleries and a tour of the exhibition, Professor Starr will lead participants through a hands-on experience using a unique collage and tracing technique for extracting information from photographs. He developed this approach to artmaking after studying contemporary applications of the Japanese woodblock technique at the Tokyo University of the Arts, where he received a PhD in studio arts. No experience or artmaking skills are needed, but each student should plan to bring a few photos (personal or cut from a magazine).​\n\nThis course will have an additional fee of $15 per person for art supplies, which we will collect at registration.\n\nAlso, a box lunch with either a ham or turkey sandwich will be available for $15 at registration, or participants may bring their own lunch."
