        "text": "The ITUC seeks to increase intergovernmental cooperation to ensure that the social dimension of globalisation, including decent work and fundamental workers’ rights, is right at the centre of decision-making at world’s major global and regional institutions.\n\nThe ITUC also works with its Global Unions partners to promote effective rules governing the behaviour of private business. We seek to achieve international frameworks for social dialogue and collective bargaining, and systems of corporate governance that hold management accountable for the social impact of business activities.\n\nA major focus of ITUC work is to ensure full and universal respect for the Fundamental Workers’ Rights of the ILO, which guarantee the right to organise in a trade union, the right to collective bargaining, protection from discrimination, and the elimination of child labour and forced labour.\n\nDirector: Evelyn Astor - [email protected]\n\nWorkers’ demands for universal justice, equality, inclusion and social progress must be at the core of key global multilateral agendas. The Equality department works to promote these demands globally at the United Nations, to advance the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to foster rights-based labour migration governance, to promote gender equality, to accelerate the integration of women and young people in the world of work, and to fight discrimination at the workplace and in the society.\n\nDirector: Paola Simonetti - [email protected]\n\nThe department develops and implements HR policies, provides personnel services and oversees staff administration. It handles the recruitment, onboarding and off-boarding processes. Additionally, it develops and implements staff health and safety policies and procedures, coordinates training and development programmes, and manages the payroll system for ITUC staff.\n\nIt also serves as the primary point of contact for all external donors, focusing on attracting, securing and managing donor funding to support the organisation’s objectives. It oversees and coordinates various donor-funded initiatives and activities in collaboration with different departments.\n\nTogether with the Finance Department, it is tasked with developing a strategic plan for future years, based on assumed donor funds, and must be adaptable in the event of funds being stopped or reduced — a situation that, unfortunately, is currently affecting some of the trade union solidarity support organisations’ funding.\n\nDirector: Sinead Tiernan - [email protected]"
