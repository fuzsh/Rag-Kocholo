        "text": "Sharing a few takeaways from this morning’s Bank Leadership & Profitability Improvement Conference in Sea Island, Georgia. Thanks to my friends at Crowe and Stifel Financial Corp., I had the privilege of presenting alongside Stephanie White, where we talked about the art of navigating our complex financial landscape. With rising expenses at the forefront of our discussions, we focused on strategies to secure the financial health of regional and community banks. Here’s a glimpse into our session, accompanied by the slides I developed for the conference. 🎨 HYPE We examined the \"savings hype\" often encountered in discussions with bank executives across the U.S. While some initiatives sound promising, they don't always deliver the expected savings. We analyzed these trends and their implications on financial strategies. 🌟 HOPE #Mergers and #Acquisitions present opportunities by leveraging size and scale to distribute costs more effectively. To start the day, KBW's Scott Anderson shared some interesting industry stats and insight on recent deals; for instance, why CET1 and CRE ratios are under scrutiny, that ample capital is available for transactions, etc. To build on his remarks, I shared anecdotes about the resurgence of deals and how they contribute to financial sustainability. 🚗 HAPPENING #AI is playing a transformative role in banking. My recent experience with an autonomous-driving Jaguar powered by Waymo in San Francisco highlighted this, along with a seamless payments experience. Although not an immediate cost-saver, a strong #paymentstrategy is crucial for long-term success. For those who follow Cornerstone Advisors' #PluggedIn podcast, this HYPE | HOPE | HAPPENING structure might sound familiar. It draws inspiration from a conversation Steve Williams and I had with Sarah Hinkfuss from Bain Capital Ventures last year. Her insights on #generativeAI significantly influenced this presentation, as did my friend Rachel Martin’s engaging podcast for NPR (#WildCard… definitely worth a listen!). #SmarterBanks #OwnTheOutcome\n\nAs I fly east to meet with the executive leadership team at a $6B+ community bank, I'm taking the opportunity to dive into some insightful research, including a recent report co-authored by QED Investors and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). It's fascinating to see how embedded finance continues to drive profitability and foster sustainable growth in #fintech. For community banks, this represents a significant call to action. By integrating embedded finance and forming partnerships with fintechs, banks can offer seamless financial solutions within popular platforms, expanding their reach and unlocking new revenue streams. This strategic approach positions banks to enhance customer experiences and maintain relevance in what we all know is a super-competitive landscape. *Thanks to Amias Gerety, Nigel Morris, Hans Morris and all who contributed to “Prudence, Profits, and Growth.” Great insights 👊🏻 #EmbeddedFinance #FintechInnovation #OwnTheOutcome\n\nHere in Southern California, I'm collaborating with my partner, Steve Williams, to redefine what \"systems\" mean for banks. Often defined in tech terms, Steve recently authored a #GonzoBanker article for Cornerstone Advisors that reminds us systems are actually \"a set of connected things that operate together\" and \"a way of doing things.\" We believe that banks, to excel, will be those that build digitally powered, data-driven, and repeatable systems to achieve even greater efficiency. As he explains, this requires design thinking, cultural change, and a lot of hard work 💯 Unlike the traditional stovepipe structures, Steve outlines an approach to drive effectiveness horizontally across an organization. This involves creating new standard processes, habits, and accountabilities for both business lines and support functions. ICYI, these are the seven key systems focused on: ⑴ Marketing and Sales ⑵ Enterprise @ Service ⑶ Enterprise Fraud and InfoSec ⑷ Governance Risk & Compliance ⑸ Analytics and Performance ⑹ Vendor Performance Management ⑺ Talent Management Taken together, these systems can transform a bank from fragmented operations to a smart, scaled future.

During recent strategic planning sessions, I’ve seen firsthand how storytelling can forge strong connections and drive success. One standout example: A West Coast bank strengthened its relationship with a major depositor by diving into the bank’s cybersecurity efforts. As I listened to how the conversation unfolded, it was clear that powerful narratives can lead to positive business outcomes. I shared this story in a clip from our latest Cornerstone Advisors #PluggedIn episode, released earlier this week. In the episode “Who's Swimming Without a Bathing Suit?,” Steve Williams and I explore storytelling, investor decks, and much more. We also give shoutouts to: ➟ Former guests like Brent Beardall and his team at WaFd Bank (incl. Kim Robison, Cathy Cooper, David Wolf) + Michael Daniels and his outstanding team at Nicolet National Bank (hello Phil Moore, ). ➟ Upcoming guests, like Jeff Jackson, the CEO of WesBanco (who we just chatted with) and Nitin Mhatre, the CEO of Berkshire Bank (who we’ll be speaking with soon). I am eager to hear about the stories that have resonated with your clients and community. If you're up for it, please share your thoughts in the comments👇🏻 #SmarterBanks #OwnTheOutcome #TGIF\n\nFresh out of the studio with my partner, Steve Williams, where we dove deep into the forces shaping bank strategy. From tech disruptions to calculated pivots, this #PluggedIn episode, \"Who's Swimming Without a Bathing Suit?\" uncovers who's preparing for the future — and who might be in for a wake-up call. Cornerstone Advisors just released episode 30, and in 22 minutes, we explore: 🏰 The push for Fortress #BalanceSheets 🤖 The rise of #GenerativeAI companies 🔘 First steps to \"hollow out\" your core We also tackle the challenges regional and community banks face in growing their #deposit bases amidst market volatility and shifting labor dynamics. Expect insightful conversations, a touch of humor, and a \"curated playlist\" featuring Jay-Z, Hall & Oates, and Keane. Plus, a special shoutout to Snoop Dogg for his work in 🇫🇷. Tune in for a mid-year check-in on what we're seeing during our travels across our great country. (Link to 📺 or 🎧 in the comments below) 🇺🇸\n\nCatching a Red Sox game yesterday from the Monster seats at Fenway was a great way to unwind before tackling the new work week. While the Sox had us on edge for just the first few innings, the real challenge in my world is how quickly banks can adapt to stay relevant. Adaptability is more than a game-changer; it’s a survival skill 💯 This theme is central in strategic planning sessions and board retreats, where the focus is increasingly on driving efficiency. However, efficiency isn't just about cutting costs; it's about fostering a culture of #creativity and #productivity. Metrics like Earnings Per Share (#EPS), Return on Equity (#ROE), and Return on Assets (#ROA) tell part of the story... but true efficiency goes beyond the numbers. #APIs are emerging as the MVPs in driving technological evolution within the banking sector. By opening their platforms, banks can offer personalized services, streamline operations, and quickly adapt to market demands. Despite the allure of modern tech stacks and the promise of efficiently rolling out new services with APIs and SaaS models, the transformation is far from easy. Legacy systems, entrenched teams, and outdated mindsets are formidable opponents. Before I head back to California on Sunday (for a bank's strategic planning session), I'd love to hear your thoughts. What are your go-to articles, podcasts, or videos on API use in banking? I have some plane time coming up, so any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! 🛫\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the concept of \"hollowing out the core.\" For many regional and community banks, this isn't just buzzword bingo — it's a key strategy for staying relevant and competitive. During my summer travels across the country, I've met with a number of bank CEOs and their exec teams, and this topic came up repeatedly. The goal is to break free from outdated, rigid systems and embrace a flexible tech stack that drives faster innovation and enhances customer service. 🌵🏜️ This week in Scottsdale (where the heat left the streets nearly empty), I had a fascinating conversation with my Cornerstone Advisors partner, Steve Williams, about this topic. He emphasized how banks strive to match the agility and speed to market that #FinTech and #BigTech companies excel at. 💡 My key takeaway? Focus on enterprise-wide technology transformation, not just core transformation. Here are three key areas to concentrate on: #DigitalStrategy Manage and expose data efficiently to achieve speed-to-market. #DataStrategy Leverage data for strategic insights and operational efficiency. #CRMStrategy Elevate customer experiences through better data management. As we talked, it became clear that meaningful change demands a solid tech architecture, a dedicated team, and a long-term vision. It’s a multi-year journey requiring grit and precision, but the rewards are worth it 💯 *I am excited to dive deeper into this topic in an upcoming episode of our #PluggedIn series that drops soon. Check the comments for the link to subscribe — and I invite you to share your thoughts on \"hollowing out the core\" in the conversation below.\n\nWe've all heard how bank mergers are transformative, but the real challenge lies in the integration of the two businesses, right? I discussed this thought with my Cornerstone Advisors partner, Quintin Sykes, in Scottsdale yesterday afternoon. FWIW, his team has led integration efforts in four of the top 20 bank M&A deals since 2023. Based on these experiences, he offered these three \"early action items\" for those who haven’t done a deal in a while: ⏰ Start Planning Early With the resurgence of significant acquisitions (e.g., Renasant Bank, UMB Bank, United Bank, SouthState Bank, Sunflower Bank, N.A., Burke & Herbert Bank), it's crucial to begin integration planning as soon as the deal is announced. To paraphrase my colleague from Carolina, early planning aligns key goals + sets the stage for a smoother transition. Thinking about your merger readiness well before due diligence starts? Even better. 📣 Focus on Culture & People Address cultural integration and employee concerns from the jump. This is a theme I heard for years while I was the #CEO of Bank Director and, most recently, on stage at #AOBA24. Change is difficult for many, so you can’t over-communicate, be it internally or externally. 🧗🏻Figure Out Your Tech Gaps What do you want the combined organization to be known for? Does your combined tech get you there? You may need to manage new complexities, especially in IT and operational systems… but if additional projects arise that are needed for integration, how much do you take on at once? _ _ _ 🗒️ Taking a page from my/our friend Chris Nichols at #SouthState, I shared the approach #Cornerstone takes when engaging in bank mergers in the accompanying images. Whether you're in an FI looking to grow through acquisition or supporting those engaging with potential sellers, I invite you to share your experiences (or questions) about #MergerReadiness in the comments. What strategies have worked for you? What challenges have you faced? Let's discuss 👇🏻"
