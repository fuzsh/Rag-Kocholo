        "text": "Kurt Vonnegut's classic adapted in graphic novel form for the first time!\n\nWith Kurt Vonnegut's seminal anti-war story, Slaughterhouse-Five, Eisner Award-winning writer Ryan North (Unbeatable Squirrel Girl) and Eisner Award-nominated artist Albert Monteys (Universe!) translate a literary classic into comic book form in the tradition of A Wrinkle in Time and Fight Club 2.\n\nBilly Pilgrim has read Kilgore Trout and opened a successful optometry business. Billy Pilgrim has built a loving family and witnessed the firebombing of Dresden. Billy Pilgrim has traveled to the planet Tralfamadore and met Kurt Vonnegut. Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five is at once a farcical look at the horror and tragedy of war where children are placed on the frontlines and die (so it goes), and a moving examination of what it means to be a fallible human.\n\nAuthor/Artist: Kurt Vonnegut / Ryan North / Albert Monteys\n\nPublisher: Boom Studios\n\nPage Count: 192pp\n\nSize: 7 x 10\n\nNotes: paperback, color\n\nDate of Publication: September 20, 2023\n\nISBN: 978-1608861354"
