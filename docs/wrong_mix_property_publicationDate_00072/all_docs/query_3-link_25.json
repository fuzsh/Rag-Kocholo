        "text": "\"There is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre,\" Kurt Vonnegut writes in the first chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five, his novel about the firebombing of Dresden during World War II. \"Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything ever again.\" Fittingly, Slaughterhouse-Five is an odd sort of book—both an antiwar novel and science fiction, a dark comedy as well as a tragedy. Published at the height of the Vietnam War protests, it seized the imaginations of thousands of young people and made Vonnegut into an overnight sensation. Now, more than forty years after its publication, scholars are only beginning to assess Vonnegut's unique achievement with this stoic yet compassionate treatment of what remains one of the most deadly military strikes in European history.\n\nAn Introduction – The book and the author\n\nEdited and with an introduction by Leonard Mustazza, Distinguished Professor of English and American Studies at Penn State Abington. His introduction describes the cultural moment in which Slaughterhouse-Five appeared, and Sarah Fay, writing for The Paris Review, analyzes Vonnegut's unique comic sensibility."
