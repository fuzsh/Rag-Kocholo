        "text": "Slaughterhouse-Five or the children's crusade: a duty dance with death is a novel written by renowned author Kurt Vonnegut. This classic is a universal favorite among the people. It contains elements of blunt realism, science fiction and dark humor. Kurt Vonnegut found the systematic, unsatisfactory arcs of many stories in contrast to reality, and he began to explore the ambiguity between good and bad luck in his novels. He sought to understand human behaviour by studying the shapes of stories-direct chronology and clear destiny. The novel revolves around the Dresden Bombing in World War II. This study attempts to understand the nuances of \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" and the and relevance of his writings in the contemporary world. Slaughterhouse-Five is often referred to as an anti-war novel but we don't really know what it means for a novel to be against war or for novels to pass judgement. This study is an attempt to provide the reader with an answer to the questions raised in the previous sentence. This research paper also depicts how time is structured in the novel. The protagonist, Billy Pilgrim experiences illusions of time travel and alien abduction. This happened to Billy whenever he remembered the instances of Dresden Bombing in World War II. This shows that memory and time are intricately connected. This research paper also aims to understand the post modernistic and tralfmadorian concepts along with anti-war components of the novel. Postmodern novels in the contemporary world don't provide us with the ideologies of world wars because a certain definition for the same wasn't discussed upon. Slaughterhouse-Five was published during the Vietnam war, paving way for the public to contemplate on the debatable aspects of war that were unexplored by authors earlier."
