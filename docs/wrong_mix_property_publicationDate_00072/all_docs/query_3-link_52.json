        "text": "This semester in How Writers Read, I chose the novel Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut to close read alongside my reading group. We read for various methods in approaching the text. The first step in the process of close reading the text was acknowledging what I typically read for. Generally I gravitate towards works of poetry, creative nonfiction pieces like collections of essays or memoirs, and also works of realistic fiction to read. Some of my favorite pieces of writing are realistic works of fiction and memoirs that progress into complex stories that seem unbelievable, yet plausible. I approached this novel as a submissive reader because I am a Kurt Vonnegut fan for that reason. Whatever he had to say I was prepared to love before even opening the front cover of the text. I find he often is able to write in a way that convinces me as a reader that what he is saying is true, or real, while also incorporating impossible elements, and expected to find these qualities in this story as well. His voice as a writer makes it everything written seem plausible, which is why I am so inclined to believe what he has to say. I also am aware that I am the type of reader who wants to understand, analyze, and discuss every detail for whatever it is I am reading. That being said, Slaughterhouse-Five made this task overwhelming. There is so much packed into the text I did not feel capable of providing an overview of all of its elements, and was therefore setting myself up for failure. Instead, I had to actively try to change the way I read and write to suit a novel of this scale of complexity. This has been my biggest challenge in using the method to read this novel.\n\nI had the bar set high for this novel, and I was reading for a thought provoking question. I didn’t know what the question was initially, but I was expecting to find one while reading. I believe one of the many questions the story poses for the reader is “What if conforming to societal expectations meant nothing to a person in relation to their personal worth?” This is different from what I originally considered to be the central question within the text, and it is only one of many potential questions to read with in mind.\n\nAfter finishing this novel, I also discovered a different potential network of controlling values than what I first developed that the text may explore.\n\nWithin the scenes of conflict in the novel, these controlling values are detectable and the contention between both the negatively charged purposes and the positively charged contexts can be found in the causes of these conflicts. The original network of controlling values I proposed for this novel which correspond to the central question, or premise, has changed, but can be viewed here.\n\nI also created a Prezi for this network which can be viewed by clicking the screenshot caption below.\n\nhttps://prezi.com/embed/-_ti_ksceqji/?bgcolor=ffffff&lock_to_path=0&autoplay=0&autohide_ctrls=0&landing_data=bHVZZmNaNDBIWnNjdEVENDRhZDFNZGNIUE43MHdLNWpsdFJLb2ZHanI0OFJJYU42Wis2em1TdWl0UTdmRXFadGhBPT0&landing_sign=0IKJAGIj4xOQXuW0xObqNfTyc7uB-KRm5hjx_dmrB4I\n\nControlling Value:\n\nPurpose-Expressing individuality in a way that disregards communal expectations allows you to live freely resulting in personal fulfillment.\n\nContext- Abandoning your personal truth in order to become part of a community sacrifices your sense of self resulting in emptiness and unhappiness.\n\nOpposing Controlling Value:\n\nPurpose- Living by societal norms enables you to feel you are part of a community, resulting in the confidence to contribute positively to society at large.\n\nContext- Rejecting societal norms in favor of pursuing a truth that challenges your society’s beliefs leaves you isolated and perceived as selfish preventing you from being part of society and therefore unhappy.\n\nI re-did the same value graph as I originally provided on my post, with this new set of values in mind.\n\nA Value Graph of pages 32-35:\n\nAction: Billy leaves to New York City to describe it experiences with the aliens.\n\n-Positive charge, because Billy is doing what he feels he needs to do regardless of societal approval, and this brings him a sense of accomplishment.\n\nAction: Barbara (Billy’s daughter) hears Billy on the radio, and brings him home from New York.\n\n-Negative charge, she is forcing Billy to conform to societal expectations, and this deprives him of living for himself in the truest way possible.\n\nAction: Billy publishes a letter in a newspaper describing the aliens.\n\n-Positive charge, at this time Billy is fighting against Barbara’s resistance to his truth and is fighting for his beliefs even though they oppose societal beliefs.\n\nAction: Billy writes his second letter in the basement of his home.\n\n-Positive charge because Billy is continuing to work on spreading his truth to the world.\n\nAction: Barbara finds Billy has ignored her and she is afraid that he is now senile.\n\n–Negative charge because her choice to write her own father off as senile is rejecting the legitimacy of his personal truth, and isolates him socially by creating a sense of “otherness” regarding him and his beliefs.\n\nThough I felt I knew what I was getting into while reading, audience members who were not prepared for the bizarre mind that belongs to Kurt Vonnegut may have been caught off guard. I noticed while reading that some members of my group were resistant to the novel because the frequent genre shifts at times became confusing, and the story switches from one scene, and location in space and time, to another quite rapidly. The way the novel moves freely between science fiction, historical fiction, and realistic fiction reinforces the question I’ve developed, and tests the reader and their tolerance for expectations to be turned upside down. When Antony mentioned genre tropes, and the way in which people generally expect a story to stick to one genre I realized what I found so exciting about the novel is that the only genre it conforms to steadily through each chapter is the anti-war novel genre, therefore it is hard to predict what will happen next while reading.\n\nWhile reading the novel I became aware that I was close to the type of audience Vonnegut had in mind while writing it, because I am a reader who enjoys the unexpected, and therefore was comfortable with and even welcomed the many genre shifts. Slaughterhouse-Five, at times, seems too far away from reality for readers who value a more grounded and plausible story in their “reading fors” to easily step into reading as an ideal addressee. It takes more work to “get” the text when you are distracted by details of the text you are unfamiliar with reading.\n\nA person who may be further from the author’s intended audience has to work to get “close” to the intended audience, or understand what type of person would read and understand the novel, then take on that role as a reader. As I read the novel, I was considering the role each of the four audiences discussed in Peter Rabinowitz’s text “Truth in Fiction: A Reexamination of Audiences“ was expected to play and how, as a reader I could enter these roles as the ideal addressee. From the beginning we are told not all of it really happened.\n\nAll of this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true (1).\n\nGenerally while reading, no matter the genre, the narrator wants their audience to think they are telling the truth. I have read stories where the narrator is unreliable leading me to question the narrative, but they still seem to try to convince their reader that what they are saying is the truth. For the narrator to be honest with the audience in saying not all of it is true, it forces the reader to read the story as a work of fiction, as opposed to reading it as something that is real, which we often do when approaching a text.\n\nThis quote indicates that whether or not the story actually happened is not what is important, which is truly odd. Generally while reading, the audience acts under the assumption the point of reading is the story. this quote provided on page one nonetheless, forces readers to drop this expectation. It alerts the audience to something deeper going on within this text, otherwise it would not have purposefully detracted from the story and focused on the fact the story itself is fiction.\n\nThis is disturbing because the book admits that it is fiction for the narrator, when books tend to be written from the point of view of a narrator who actually thinks the story they are telling is true. Rabinowitz argues:\n\nIn the proper reading of a novel, then, events which are portrayed must be treated as both ‘true’ and ‘untrue’ at the same time. Although there are many ways to understand this duality, I propose to analyze the four audiences which it generates (125).\n\nThe four audiences that Rabinowitz proposes are the “actual audience”, which “consists of the flesh-and-blood people who read the book” (126), or myself as I am reading the book in the world I exist in. The next audience Rabinowitz recognizes is the “authorial audience”, or the audience the author had in mind as they wrote the book. The next audience I considered while reading was the “narrative audience”, or the audience the imitation author, which we call narrator is being read by.\n\nThis novel in particular is interesting to consider the narrative audience for because the book is split into two parts. There is Chapter One, written from the perspective of the “author” or the narrator of the story and their process writing the story. The next part of the novel is the book this narrator was telling the audience about during Chapter One. That being said, I propose that there are actually two narrative audiences. The one the narrator was addressing in their description of the novel they were writing, then the audience they were addressing in the actual novel itself. The dichotomy between the two creates a sense of “real” and “fake” or “true” and “untrue” as Rabinowitz puts it, even though both are technically untrue to us, the actual audience.\n\nThe fourth audience, or the “ideal narrative audience” is described as “the audience for which the narrator wishes he were writing and relates to the narrative audience in a way roughly analogous to the way that the authorial audience relates to the actual audience” (134). By that, Rabinowitz means that the ideal narrative audience is the narrator’s intended audience. So to fully understand the fictional author, or narrator, and what they are hoping to convey through the story, a reader has to understand who the narrator wants their audience to be. This requires a deep understanding of the narrator and their purpose which in Slaughterhouse-Five, at times, feels unidentifiable.\n\nFor me while reading, the narrator’s changing proximity to the story and to the main character made it difficult to distinguish between the authorial audience and the narrative audience and occasionally put me in the position of a resistant reader. Amanda discussed this resistance in her blog about Intertextual codes, and I also felt resistant for some of the same reasons she seemed to. To consider these audiences and attempt to adopt the role of addressee for them both, one must do some real thinking to understand what both the author of Slaughterhouse-Five is asking the reader to become, and the difference between the authorial audience and the narrative audience.\n\nAccording to Rabinowitz, the narrative audience is the audience that the narrator of the story, which can be thought of as the fictional author of the piece, is writing for. This audience possesses some knowledge that the actual audience does not because they exist within the imagined world of the narrator. To understand the narrator and who they are writing for, the reader has to understand the purpose. However, because the author’s intended audience is different from the narrator’s audience, it is hard for me to flip between becoming an addressee for both and distinguishing between which I am being at specific moments while reading. To me, it sometimes feels that if the narrator is written by the author, then the author’s intended audience would be the same as the narrator’s actual audience because it is all created at the author’s discretion.\n\nThe novel opens with a narrator describing their process of writing a book about their experiences as an American Soldier who survived the bombing of Dresden. The narrator goes unnamed, but addresses the reader directly, providing an introduction to what we assume is their book. In the chapters that follow, the story we are reading is the book the narrator described writing in Chapter One. The story follows the life of Billy Pilgrim, which includes his experiences as a soldier in World War II and most importantly, his memory of the bombing of Dresden. His military background is similar to that of the narrator which made me as a reader consider the character Billy Pilgrim a part of the narrator’s personal story.\n\nAt times, the narrator from Chapter One interrupts our reading of the story by stating that he was there. For example, when describing a scene in a prison camp, the narrator interjects with “That was I. That was me. That was the author of this book” (160). Immediately, this makes it difficult to distinguish between the narrator and the author, because the narrator is the author of the book we are reading from Chapter Two onward, but Vonnegut, the actual author, is the author of the entire work and created the narrator of Chapter One to tell his story in the rest of the book. To what end? I interpret it as being structured in order to frame the audience’s reading to the book ensuring they are reading for a negative view of war and its’ effects.\n\nFrom the beginning, the narrator tells the reader they cannot expect a positive view of war, “So then I understood. It was the war that made her so angry. She didn’t want her babies or anybody else’s babies killed in wars. And she thought wars were partly encouraged by books and movies,” (19). Vonnegut is using the narrator to maintain the voice of a World War II veteran who is telling his story while also forcing his audience to confront the portrayal of war and soldiers in popular media outlets. The narrator inside the narration tells the reader before entering into Billy Pilgrim’s story, “I give you my word of honor: there won’t be a part for Frank Sinatra or John Wayne,” (19). This alerted me immediately that the purpose of the text is to tell the truth about war, and not glorify or promote it. Through having a narrator directly confront the audience about their expectations for a war story, Vonnegut is indicating how he wants this story read; as an anti-war novel. This challenged me to remove my preconceived expectations from my reading of the text.\n\nThe introduction to Billy’s character describes what life was like for him before, during, and after the war. It briefly describes Billy’s childhood, “Billy was born in 1922 in Ilium, New York,” (30). It then glances over his military service, “Billy saw service with the infantry in Europe, and was taken prisoner by the Germans,” (30). We then learn that after the war Billy became an optometrist, a husband, a father, a plane crash survivor, and a widow with no reference to the war he survived. We also learn, perhaps most importantly that “Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time. Billy has gone to sleep a senile widower and woken up on his wedding day,” (29). All of a sudden, we find Billy was abducted by aliens which enables him to travel in time, “He told about having come unstuck in time. He said, too, that he had been kidnapped by a flying saucer in 1967,” (32). This is where it first becomes difficult to “get” the text, or become the reader that the author wants you to be in order to see what truth they choose to reveal, or question they choose to explore, through the text. It catches the reader off guard, making it challenging to immediately accept this part of the narrative.\n\nBilly decides to share the alien wisdom over the radio, then in a series of newspaper articles.\n\nThe most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies, he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past present, and future, always have existed, always will exist (34).\n\nAt this time, we are also informed that when someone dies, Tralfamadorians simply say “So it goes” which becomes part of a semic code, or, groupings of words that surround a specific idea.\n\nThis grouping of words recurs with every experience with death and loss that both Billy and the narrator encounter. “When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments” (34). People never quite die for this alien species because they can view all of the moments something was alive at once. Billy and the narrator adopt this cultural phrase into the narrative of the text, linking the way the book is written, to the way Tralfamadorians live. I think one function of this semic repetition is to wear the reader down.\n\nVonnegut makes the audience realize each death as it happens because an additional phrase is added. It makes the reader stumble for the first few chapters, then the reader gets used to it. This is similar to the way those who fight in wars become accustomed to death. This choice to de-emphasize death seems harsh to a reader who is so used to death being a big mournful deal. It makes us stop and think about war and the great scale of death soldiers are exposed to in order to desensitize the topic.\n\nTralfamadorian wisdom is introduced to the reader early on in the text, and is not questioned by the narrator, which implies that it should not be questioned by the reader. One character is disturbed by Billy’s alien wisdom: his daughter Barbara. She not only refuses to believe him, but writes him off as crazy which potentially highlights a societal code. This also connects to the set of controlling values I developed, as Billy’s choice to express his beliefs leaves him filling fulfilled, and leaves Barbara upset and embarrassed at his selfishness, and the ways in which he is making her look bad. Barbara is representative of mainstream society, that rejects information that challenges the status quo.\n\nNow she raised hell with him about the letter in the paper. She said he was making a laughing stock of himself and everybody associated with him (37).\n\nThe conflict begins to emerge between society’s expectations for Billy to be grounded, and not discuss being abducted by aliens and certainly not to broadcast those experiences, and Billy’s desire to live his own personal truth and do as he pleases without the influence of society on his decision making. The choice to write Billy off as “crazy” for his differing viewpoint highlights the tendency to reject and believe something is sick or broken about someone with a differing lifestyle from mainstream society. Billy’s belief system does not cause harm to anyone, he is not encouraging violence, nor is he making any attempt to come into any sort of power. He is simply sharing his story, and because it does not conform to expectations he is isolated and rejected.\n\nThe book eventually begins describing Billy’s experiences in the war and being a prisoner of war. After the scene where Billy is confronted by Barbara for sharing the alien wisdom, the text transports the audience back in time to World War II and Billy’s experiences there. Billy’s regiment is bombarded and Billy is the only survivor. He meets three other soldiers who are wandering the woods, separated from their regiments and they form a group of wanderers. One of these wanderers is named Roland Weary who is violent and crude, “When Weary was ditched, he would find somebody who was even more unpopular than himself, and he would horse around with that person for a while, pretending to be friendly. And then he would find some pretext for beating the shit out of them” (44). Weary is characterized as drawing confidence from violence. When he feels bad about himself, he finds someone to prey upon and uses violence to become superior in some way.\n\nThis contrasts heavily with Billy Pilgrim’s ambivalence and apathy towards everything, including his own life. Billy is immediately characterized as someone who is not a fighter, and is out of place in scenes of war. As he is being shot at, Billy does not care to run, “Billy stood there politely, giving the marksman another chance. It was his addled understanding of the rules of warfare the the marksman should be given a second chance” (42). There are even moments when Billy begs to be left behind, “He wished everybody would leave him alone. ‘You guys go on without me,’ he said again and again” (43).\n\nAs a society, Americans tend to expect the strongest, most motivated, and patriotic men to go to war. Billy Pilgrim is none of those things, and his very existence as a character challenges this cultural code. As Kaja Silverman says in regards to reading specifically for codes in Subject of Semiotics,\n\nIts most remarkable achievement is to have articulated an interpretive strategy which permits the reader (or viewer) to uncover the symbolic field inhabited by a given text (237).\n\nSoldiers and war symbolize patriotism and strength. Billy possesses neither, which contends with societal expectations and creates conflict when the expectations of a soldier and Billy Pilgrim’s existence collide. He is apathetic towards life and is not willing to fight for his own or anyone else’s. He is not strongly religious, is not physically strong, and doesn’t really do much of anything with himself. In once scene, Weary begins assaulting Billy, saying “You shouldn’t even be in the army” (64). Billy’s response is laughter. He knows he shouldn’t be in the army. The reader knows he shouldn’t be in the army. American readers expect a soldier to be strong and patriotic and happy to die for their country regardless of the worthiness of the cause. By challenging these expectations, the novel is reinforcing its’ place in the genre of anti-war novel. The expectation the society around Billy holds is that a soldier is strong and violent which creates conflict when Billy is a soldier who doesn’t fit into the mold he is expected to. This also forces the reader to examine why Billy doesn’t fit into war, and whether anyone truly should. Roland Weary is representative of the violence and perseverance we associate with soldiers. There are moments he daydreams about telling his war stories and imagines being met with glory and honor upon surviving the war.\n\nBilly and Weary are captured by Germans, and immediately Billy goes into a long period of time travel. He jumps around to different stages of his post-war life. Most importantly, this section describes the moment of Billy Pilgrim’s alien abduction. Billy begins his adventures with time travel on the night of his daughter’s wedding. “He travelled in time to 1967 again- to the night he was kidnapped by a flying saucer from Tralfamadore” (90). This juxtaposition of events is interesting to look at, and the way in which it contributes to the repetitive form within this novel. We are continuously presented with situations in which Billy is either in a happy moment (his daughter’s wedding) or a traumatic moment (being taken prisoner of war) where the time travel begins.\n\nHe is never fully present in any moment, because part of him is always stuck in his past.\n\nVonnegut chooses to explore the connection between happiness and sadness, and the way in which the past infiltrates both the happiest, and saddest of moments thorough a character “unstuck” in time. The narrator struggles with confronting his past, and finds it to be both necessary, and impossible to look back.\n\nIn his introduction, the narrator references this bible story:\n\nHe states, “And Lot’s wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human. So she was turned to a pillar of salt. So it goes” (28). The narrator recognizes reminiscing to be a human act, perhaps the most human, and references the scene in the bible in which Lot’s wife looks back at the town she is leaving behind, knowing that she will turn to salt for it. It was more important to her to look back than her own life was. In the next sentence, the narrator contradicts himself by saying:\n\nPeople aren’t supposed to look back. I’m certainly not going to do it anymore. I’ve finished my war book now. The next one I write is going to be fun. This one is a failure, and has to be, since it was written by a pillar of salt (28).\n\nThe narrator feels conflicted about remembering his past. The narrator says looking back is not natural, and shouldn’t be done, and killed him to do seeing as the novel was “written by a pillar of salt” just as Lot’s wife became. Yet, he loves that Lot’s wife chose to look back, and finds it endearing.\n\nThe resistance to reminiscing also begins to reveal why the narrator chose to incorporate aliens in the telling of this story. He considers looking back to be utterly human, yet the only way in which his human character Billy is able to do it is through a nonhuman species: Tralfamadorians. This may reveal that looking back at times becomes involuntary, and can only be explained or shown to the reader as time travel because there is no other way to describe it to a reader.\n\nThe narrator knows time travel is technically impossible, and that aliens do not exist, but the only way to show how interconnected the past and present are, is through making it out of the person’s control when they look back. It places the control in the hands, or at least at the responsibility of non-humans in order to avoid explaining why we look back. He has no explanation, so he invents one.\n\nThe use of involuntary time travel in the text also ties into the hermeneutic code and the withholding of information from the reader to almost prompt the reader to struggle with the questions the text poses. What happened in Dresden becomes the enigma from the beginning of the story because the narrator, who addresses his audience directly in Chapter One before deciding to begin telling the story does not reveal his experiences to the reader, but talks around them building the curiosity. As a reader, each time we feel we are getting close to learning something, we are provided with a jam, and the answer is withheld. It is only after the repetitive jam, that is the time traveling elements, do we finally learn what happened in Dresden.\n\nOne thing was clear: Absolutely everybody in the city was supposed to be dead, regardless of what they were, and that anybody that moved in it represented a flaw in the design (230).\n\nIt is not until the last few chapters do we hear about Dresden at all. The story constantly is sidetracked by travels through time and the different parts of Billy’s life. Billy’s own death does not even end the story, but rather happens in the middle of the book. which indicates to me that what the story is building towards was never related to Billy himself, but rather what the narrator is struggling with accepting: the bombing of Dresden.\n\nIt felt odd to me as a reader to be reading a story knowing when and how the main character dies, while also being aware that their death is not the most important part of the story. What is interesting, is the way in which Billy dies, and the way it involves Roland Weary.\n\nBefore the Americans arrive in Dresden, they spend several weeks living on a stationary train preparing to be sent to a Prisoner of War camp. It is on one of these trains that Weary dies of gangrene. He asks a friend to avenge his death, and kill Billy Pilgrim. Many years later, the friend does. In fact, the location of the murder is at a rally where Billy is lecturing his followers about Tralfamadorian philosophy.\n\nBilly is in the process of living his life in accordance to his own wishes as opposed to societal norms, when he is killed, or silenced, by a member of the society Billy never belonged to at the request of a different member of this society. This murder is the ultimate act of groupthink, which reinforces the symbolic code that the traditional role of soldier and fighter represented by Weary smothers the free-thinking and peaceful way of life exemplified by Billy Pilgrim. This connects back to the genre convention of anti-war novels, as well as to the newly developed controlling values in the text where Billy’s individuality contests with societal expectations.\n\nAs one Tralfamadorian said;\n\nIf I hadn’t spent so much time studying Earthlings…I wouldn’t have any idea what was meant by ‘free-will.’ I’ve visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe, and I have studied reports on one hundred more. Only on Earth is there any talk of free will (109).\n\nThe alien population’s objective view of humanity causes the reader to take a step back and wonder whether or not they are right. Societal influences at times seem unavoidable and the tantalizing prospect of fitting in and belonging to a group often causes people to choose a socially acceptable way of life, rather than one that would benefit them. Most people base their idea of themselves off of what they have been socialized to believe they should be. Deciding who and what to conform to or rebel against is influenced by societal factors that are developed through society’s influence over a person through socialization.\n\nPart of the humor within Slaughterhouse-Five arises when a character who has discovered who he is, then stays true to himself seemingly without societal influence is subjected to some of society’s most oppressive institutions (marriage, and the military). He clearly does not function well within these institutions because he is not like other humans. He does seem to retain some sense of free will although this is deemed to be impossible. Billy in fact is such an oddity to the alien population, that he is a subject of research in a Tralfamadorian zoo. Out of all humans, they choose Billy. Perhaps this is because even among humans, Billy is an anomaly for his stubborn resistance to do what is instinctively expected of him.\n\nAs a subject of observation in a Tralfamadorian zoo, the alien creatures observed him and asked him questions about Earth. This symbolized Billy’s individuality as being a trait that isolates him from the rest of society. He is so much part of an “other” or is so different, that he is put on display. On Earth, he is hidden away in a mental health clinic which he checked himself into after a nervous breakdown. On Tralfamadore he is literally a subject being studied in a zoo.\n\nIn Lacey’s blog four, she examined an interesting point. The way the novel was written, was exactly how a Tralfamadorian book is described. As one alien puts it when Billy asks to read one:\n\nThere isn’t any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time (112).\n\nThis story examines different scenes in Billy’s life without any type of surprise that the reader can detect. We know Billy dies eventually because we are told he does, and we are told that Billy knows he dies. In fact we experience Billy’s death scene, and the book doesn’t end there. That is just another scene for us as readers to experience before moving on to a different scene unrelated to what we just experienced. The way the narrator told his famous story about Dresden, is exactly as a Tralfamadorian would have told the story of Billy’s life.\n\nWhile reading, I considered the reason the narrator even mentions Tralfamadorian books within his book was to indicate to the readers how the story should be read. He invented an alien population that wrote just like him. Even more, he told the only human to encounter these books, Billy Pilgrim, that he was too stupid to understand them and he could not even teach him to read them because he simply won’t get it. “He asked if there wasn’t, please, some other reading matter around. ‘Only Tralfamadorian novels, which I’m afraid you couldn’t begin to understand’” (111). This implies the narrator was planning for his story to be unreadable to certain types of audience members, which makes the present reader question their “reading fors” without even being aware they are questioning anything.\n\nOn Tralfamadore, the aliens can see all of time before them, and can travel throughout it. They are peaceful creatures, who themselves have wars that they choose not to experience. Billy assumes humans destroy the world in the end. It is not the humans but rather the Tralfamadorians, on accident. “Earthlings must be the terrors of the universe! If other planets aren’t now in danger from Earth, they soon will be” (148). After warning the aliens of Earthlings, Billy finds they think he is behaving very stupidly. They reveal to him that in fact they are the reason the universe eventually ends.\n\n‘We blow it up, experimenting with new fuels for our flying saucers. A Tralfamadorian test pilot presses a starter button, and the whole Universe disappears.’ So it goes (149).\n\nTralfamadorians have seen all of human history and know all of the horrible things we have done. They have no reason to care for humans, but they treat Billy kindly and at the end of the day, are the group of people who end up destroying the universe. I think in creating this alien race, the narrator created a group of people he considers “perfect”. Perhaps the only way the narrator could handle the horrible things they saw and felt and experienced in Dresden was to create an ideal species, and have them not judge or hate the humans. Through this impartial audience, he was able to remember the war without hating humanity too much, as well as provide social commentary without making the opinion come from his narration.\n\nI opened this book expecting it to question the world in a way that I had not traditionally questioned it (kind of a lot of pressure for Vonnegut) and I walked away with new questions to ask and perspectives to examine. I think Vonnegut expertly made his reader consider emotion, and the juxtaposition of happy emotions alongside unhappy emotions, and how involuntary the experience of feeling anything at all truly is. Happiness is experienced with the knowledge that there will be periods of unhappiness to follow, and the inverse as well is true. In each of Billy’s happiest moments and most unpleasant memories he is unable to contribute fully to the experience.\n\nThe lack of control over these feelings is described through the Tralfamadorian aliens, though in reality it is a very human occurrence. People look back constantly, sometimes voluntarily and sometimes not. Though it is the narrator who expresses his frustration with this concept, I believe Vonnegut views memories and the passage of time with equal frustration. I think in writing an entire novel that explores the involuntary nature of human emotion, he must have some experience with this confusion. I know I certainly do."
