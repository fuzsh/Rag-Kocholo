        "text": "Some people may think the novel Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is a failure. In fact, Kurt Vonnegut himself calls it a failure. A lot of people disagree with that, many think that Slaughterhouse Five is one of Vonnegut's best novels. They say it is the most successful book they have ever read, just for reasons of the author himself. From him being bluntly honest, to his great wit. So if it is such a failure in his eyes, why did he write it, what was his purpose, and why was it even published? Questions everyone are very curious about. Kurt Vonnegut calls his novel failure (Vonnegut, 22), but why? Well, in Vonnegut’s words it is a failure because, “there is nothing intelligent about a massacre” (Vonnegut, 19). He has nothing intelligent to write about it, so it fails at being a good, successful book. The article Diagnosing Billy Pilgrim: A Psychiatric Approach to Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse Five” is a good example, “But not many words about Dresden come to mind then,..And not many words come now either…”(Gulani, 2). Gulani’s point relates to Vonnegut’s, she knows not many words come to mind when trying to write about a war. Just how Vonnegut feels, it’s too hard to write a book about something that is suppose to be left in the past. Kurt Vonnegut says this book was a failure because it was written by a pillar of salt (Vonnegut, 22). He is basically calling himself a pillar of salt, which references the Bible story of Sodom and Gomorrah, and Lat’s wife turning"
