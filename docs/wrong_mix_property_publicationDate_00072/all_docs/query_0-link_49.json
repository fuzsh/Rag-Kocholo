        "text": "One of Kurt Vonnegut's most influential works, Slaughterhouse-Five is a science fiction-inspired tale that touches upon the experiences of Billy Pilgrim, an American soldier, in the time before, during, and after World War II. This compelling edition presents readers with a collection of essays on the theme of war as depicted in the novel. Topics discussed include the moral problem of Billy's fantasies, Billy's time-traveling as a psychological phenomenon, and deconstructing the war novel.
