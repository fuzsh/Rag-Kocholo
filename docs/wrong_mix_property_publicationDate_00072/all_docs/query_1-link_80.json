        "text": "Cheryl Carroll ably led the ZOOM discussion of Kurt Vonnegut’s 1969 novel “Slaughterhouse Five.”\n\nJoining in were Gene Helveston, John Hawn, Sarona Burchard, John Sturman, Bill Briscoe, Jay Carr, and Andy Barton.\n\nThis is the club’s fifth reading of SH5. We previously attacked this book in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2019.\n\nCheryl started us off with some reviews from 1969 that proclaimed the novel to be an “intellectual pacemaker” and on a less lofty note “pretentious.” I wish I could write this summary of our discussion in the Tralfamadorian fourth dimension, but I don’t seem to have the toolbox for that\n\nWas this book about free will or (what one of our medics suggested) neuro-determinal mechanism under hormonal control. Those of us who never made it through organic chemistry might well have been flummoxed. Without getting into the weeds with behavioral endocrinolgy, it does seem that if Billy Pilgrim or any human being has no control over his or her hormonal activity and those hormones dictate his or her behavior, how can there be free will? Inquiring minds want to know.\n\nOr maybe it was just Kurt trying to work out PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) from excavating bodies from Dresden cellars in WWII. It too him twenty-four years after his discharge to release this work. But even in 1969, PTSD wasn’t taken all that seriously. We still had memories of General Patton slapping a “shell-shocked” soldier, malingering in an infirmary and refusing to return to the front. Billy (and Kurt) never had to deal with that as they quickly resumed their middle-class lives.\n\nWe talked quite a bit about Black Humor and Cheryl referenced Moliere (1622-1673) who inspires the French literati as much as Bill Shakespeare inspires ours. He successfully held up a mirror to society without offending his royal patrons. Billy’s ineptness as a soldier (was he really a Christ figure?) was not without humor. There seemed to be a paralell between his treatment as a POW by the Germans and his treatment as a zoological specimen by the Tralfamadorians.\n\nSpeaking of Tralfamadore, Kurt loved to work old Indianapolis names into his stuff. Montana Wildhack was probably a nod toward his friend and fellow classmate at Shortridge High School, Margaret “Mig” (Jameson) Wildhack. Jim Poyser, a writer for the Chicago Reader before he became editor of Indianapolis NUVO, wrote a lovely tribute to her in 1996: https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/living-in-the-moment-2/.&nbsp; Jim is married to my casual friend, Patricia Wildhack, Mig’s daughter. Jim mentions the Slaughterhouse Five connection.\n\nThe club talked about what we experienced by reading all of Kurt’s fourteen novels sequentially over the past year or so. Although all the novels seem dissimilar (Kurt didn’t do sequels) there are recurring themes and characters that tie most of them together. The most prominent character may be Kilgore Trout who some believe is Kurt’s alter-ego. Is there such a thing as free will? KV is not very encouraging. His cynicism and pessimism is rampant, but he does leave room for a little hope. Maybe wars are not like glaciers, things that will never go away. SH5 ends in a peaceful valley after the German guards have faded away and the POW’s are left with many others who have survived a terrible war. “Bluebeard” ends when the protagonist artist’s large mural is revealed : “Now it is the Women’s Turn.” The mural displays a peaceful valley full of war refugees. Mankind has fucked up the world and it is time for a new beginning. The bird singing in the wilderness offers that hope. Potweet!\n\nMention was made of Salmon Rushdie, who appeared in Indianapolis in 2019 for the 50th Anniversery of “SH5.” An adaptation of the speech he gave appeared in the 6/13/19 New Yorker Magazine: “What Kurt Vonnegut’s ‘Slaughterhouse Five’ tells us now. https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-kurt-vonneguts-slaughterhouse-five-tells-us-now.&nbsp; Well worth reading. Rushdie expounds on the misuse of the phrase “So it Goes.”\n\nThere was some discussion of a book of Kurt’s drawings, cleverly titled “Kurt Vonnegut Drawings; Introduction by Nanette Vonnegut,” Monacelli Press, 2014. This 176 page hardcover edition is out of print but is available on Amazon for $355.39.\n\nOne of the followers of our blog, Maribeth Ransel, furnished this link regarding Kurt’s contribution to science: https://www.science.org/content/article/100-years-after-his-birth-kurt-vonnegut-more-relevant-ever-science\n\nFinally, if you have nothing better to do, look at my prep notes for the 2013 session. They are attached after excerpt from Wikipedia.\n\nWe voted this novel a 9.4 on the totally objective KV 10.0 scale. Our next meeting will be at 11AM on Thursday, December 8, 2022, when Gene Helveston will tell us all we need to know about KV’s.\n\nNext novel: “Breakfast of Champions” at 11AM on December 8, 2022. Lot of black humor! We are anticipating a new Zoomer, Jeff Gabbard.\n\n“All the real soldiers are dead.” So said the wise old German lady.\n\nDave Young.\n\n*****************************\n\nExcerpt from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five, or, The Children’s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death is a 1969 semi-autobiographic science fiction-infused anti-war novel by Kurt Vonnegut. It follows the life and experiences of Billy Pilgrim, from his early years, to his time as an American soldier and chaplain’s assistant during World War II, to the post-war years, with Billy occasionally traveling through time. The text centers on Billy’s capture by the German Army and his survival of the Allied firebombing of Dresden as a prisoner of war, an experience which Vonnegut himself lived through as an American serviceman. The work has been called an example of “unmatched moral clarity”[3] and “one of the most enduring anti-war novels of all time”.[3]\n\nThe story is told in a non-linear order by an unreliable narrator (he begins the novel by telling the reader, “All of this happened, more or less”). Events become clear through flashbacks and descriptions of his time travel experiences.[4] In the first chapter, the narrator describes his writing of the book, his experiences as a University of Chicago anthropology student and a Chicago City News Bureau correspondent, his research on the Children’s Crusade and the history of Dresden, and his visit to Cold War-era Europe with his wartime friend Bernard V. O’Hare. He then writes about Billy Pilgrim, an American man from the fictional town of Ilium, New York, who believes that he was held at one time in an alien zoo on a planet he calls Tralfamadore, and that he has experienced time travel.\n\nAs a chaplain’s assistant in the United States Army during World War II, Billy is an ill-trained, disoriented, and fatalistic American soldier who discovers that he does not like war and refuses to fight.[5] He is transferred from a base in South Carolina to the front line in Luxembourg during the Battle of the Bulge. He narrowly escapes death as the result of a string of events. He also meets Roland Weary, a patriot, warmonger, and sadistic bully who derides Billy’s cowardice. The two of them are captured in 1944 by the Germans, who confiscate all of Weary’s belongings and force him to wear wooden clogs that cut painfully into his feet; the resulting wounds become gangrenous, which eventually kills him. While Weary is dying in a rail car full of prisoners, he convinces a fellow soldier, Paul Lazzaro, that Billy is to blame for his death. Lazzaro vows to avenge Weary’s death by killing Billy, because revenge is “the sweetest thing in life”.\n\nAt this exact time, Billy becomes “unstuck in time” and has flashbacks from his former and future life. Billy and the other prisoners are transported into Germany. By 1945, the prisoners have arrived in the German city of Dresden to work in “contract labor” (forced labor). The Germans hold Billy and his fellow prisoners in an empty slaughterhouse called Schlachthof-fünf (“slaughterhouse five”). During the extensive bombing of Dresden by the Allies, German guards hide with the prisoners in the slaughterhouse, which is partially underground and well-protected from the damage on the surface. As a result, they are among the few survivors of the firestorm that rages in the city between February 13 and 15, 1945. After V-E Day in May 1945, Billy is transferred to the United States and receives an honorable discharge in July 1945.\n\nSoon, Billy is hospitalized with symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder and placed under psychiatric care at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Lake Placid. There, he shares a room with Eliot Rosewater, who introduces Billy to the novels of an obscure science fiction author, Kilgore Trout. After his release, Billy marries Valencia Merble, whose father owns the Ilium School of Optometry that Billy later attends. Billy becomes a successful and wealthy optometrist. In 1947, Billy and Valencia conceive their first child, Robert, on their honeymoon in Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Two years later their second child, Barbara, is born. On Barbara’s wedding night, Billy is abducted by a flying saucer and taken to a planet many light-years away from Earth called Tralfamadore. The Tralfamadorians are described as being able to see in four dimensions, simultaneously observing all points in the space-time continuum. They universally adopt a fatalistic worldview: death means nothing to them, and their common response to hearing about death is “so it goes”.\n\nOn Tralfamadore, Billy is put in a transparent geodesic dome exhibit in a zoo; the dome represents a house on Earth. The Tralfamadorians later abduct a pornographic film star named Montana Wildhack, who had disappeared on Earth and was believed to have drowned in San Pedro Bay. They intend to have her mate with Billy. She and Billy fall in love and have a child together. Billy is instantaneously sent back to Earth in a time warp to re-live past or future moments of his life.\n\nIn 1968, Billy and a co-pilot are the only survivors of a plane crash in Vermont. While driving to visit Billy in the hospital, Valencia crashes her car and dies of carbon monoxide poisoning. Billy shares a hospital room with Bertram Rumfoord, a Harvard University history professor researching an official history of the war. They discuss the bombing of Dresden, which the professor initially refuses to believe Billy witnessed; the professor claims that the bombing of Dresden was justified despite the great loss of civilian lives and the complete destruction of the city.\n\nBilly’s daughter takes him home to Ilium. He escapes and flees to New York City. In Times Square he visits a pornographic book store, where he discovers books written by Kilgore Trout and reads them. Among the books he discovers a book entitled The Big Board, about a couple abducted by aliens and tricked into managing the aliens’ investments on Earth. He also finds a number of magazine covers noting the disappearance of Montana Wildhack, who happens to be featured in a pornographic film being shown in the store. Later in the evening, when he discusses his time travels to Tralfamadore on a radio talk show, he is ejected from the studio. He returns to his hotel room, falls asleep, and time-travels back to 1945 in Dresden. Billy and his fellow prisoners are tasked with locating and burying the dead. After a Maori New Zealand soldier working with Billy dies of dry heaves the Germans begin cremating the bodies en masse with flamethrowers. Billy’s friend Edgar Derby is shot for stealing a teapot. Eventually all of the German soldiers leave to fight on the Eastern Front, leaving Billy and the other prisoners alone with tweeting birds as the war ends.\n\nThrough non-chronological storytelling, other parts of Billy’s life are told throughout the book. After Billy is evicted from the radio studio, Barbara treats Billy as a child and often monitors him. Robert becomes starkly anti-communist, enlists as a Green Beret and fights in the Vietnam War. Billy eventually dies in 1976, at which point the United States has been partitioned into twenty separate countries and attacked by China with thermonuclear weapons. He gives a speech in a baseball stadium in Chicago in which he predicts his own death and proclaims that “if you think death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood a word I’ve said.” Billy soon after is shot with a laser gun by an assassin commissioned by the elderly Lazzaro.\n\nCharacters[edit]\n\nNarrator: Recurring as a minor character, the narrator seems anonymous while also clearly identifying himself as Kurt Vonnegut, when he says, “That was I. That was me. That was the author of this book.”[6] As noted above, as an American soldier during World War II, Vonnegut was captured by Germans at the Battle of the Bulge and transported to Dresden. He and fellow prisoners-of-war survived the bombing while being held in a deep cellar of Schlachthof Fünf (“Slaughterhouse-Five”).[7] The narrator begins the story by describing his connection to the firebombing of Dresden and his reasons for writing Slaughterhouse-Five.\n\nBilly Pilgrim: A fatalistic optometrist ensconced in a dull, safe marriage in Ilium, New York. During World War II, he was held as a prisoner-of-war in Dresden and survived the firebombing, experiences which had a lasting effect on his post-war life. His time travel occurs at desperate times in his life; he relives past and future events and becomes fatalistic (though not a defeatist) because he claims to have seen when, how, and why he will die.\n\nRoland Weary: A weak man dreaming of grandeur and obsessed with gore and vengeance, who saves Billy several times (despite Billy’s protests) in hopes of attaining military glory. He coped with his unpopularity in his home city of Pittsburgh by befriending and then beating people less well-liked than him, and is obsessed with his father’s collection of torture equipment. Weary is also a bully who beats Billy and gets them both captured, leading to the loss of his winter uniforms and boots. Weary dies of gangrene on the train en route to the POW camp, and blames Billy in his dying words.\n\nPaul Lazzaro: Another POW. A sickly, ill-tempered car thief from Cicero, Illinois who takes Weary’s dying words as a revenge commission to kill Billy. He keeps a mental list of his enemies, claiming he can have anyone “killed for a thousand dollars plus traveling expenses.” Lazzaro eventually fulfills his promise to Weary and has Billy assassinated by a laser gun in 1976.\n\nKilgore Trout: A failed science fiction writer whose hometown is also Ilium, New York, and who makes money by managing newspaper delivery boys. He has received only one fan letter (from Eliot Rosewater; see below). After Billy meets him in a back alley in Ilium, he invites Trout to his wedding anniversary celebration. There, Kilgore follows Billy, thinking the latter has seen through a “time window.” Kilgore Trout is also a main character in Vonnegut’s 1973 novel Breakfast of Champions.\n\nEdgar Derby: A middle-aged high school teacher who felt that he needed to participate in the war rather than just send off his students to fight. Though relatively unimportant, he seems to be the only American before the bombing of Dresden to understand what war can do to people. During Campbell’s presentation he stands up and castigates him, defending American democracy and the alliance with the Soviet Union. German forces summarily execute him for looting after they catch him taking a kettle from the street wreckage after the bombing. Vonnegut has said that this death is the climax of the book as a whole.\n\nHoward W. Campbell Jr.: An American-born Nazi. Before the war, he lived in Germany where he was a noted German-language playwright recruited by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda. In an essay, he connects the misery of American poverty to the disheveled appearance and behavior of the American POWs. Edgar Derby confronts him when Campbell tries to recruit American POWs into the American Free Corps to fight the Communist Soviet Union on behalf of the Nazis. He appears wearing swastika-adorned cowboy hat and boots and with a red, white, and blue Nazi armband. Campbell is the protagonist of Vonnegut’s 1962 novel Mother Night.\n\nValencia Merble: Billy’s wife and the mother of their children, Robert and Barbara. Billy is emotionally distant from her. She dies from carbon monoxide poisoning after an automobile accident en route to the hospital to see Billy after his airplane crash.\n\nRobert Pilgrim: Son of Billy and Valencia. A troubled, middle-class boy and disappointing son who becomes an alcoholic at age 16, drops out of high school, and is arrested for vandalizing a Catholic cemetery. He later so absorbs the anti-Communist worldview that he metamorphoses from suburban adolescent rebel to Green Beret sergeant. He wins a Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Silver Star in the Vietnam War.\n\nBarbara Pilgrim: Daughter of Billy and Valencia. She is a “bitchy flibbertigibbet” from having had to assume the family’s leadership at the age of twenty. She has “legs like an Edwardian grand piano“, marries an optometrist, and treats her widowed father as a childish invalid.\n\nTralfamadorians: The race of extraterrestrial beings who appear (to humans) like upright toilet plungers with a hand atop, in which is set a single green eye. They abduct Billy and teach him about time’s relation to the world (as a fourth dimension), fate, and the nature of death. The Tralfamadorians are featured in several Vonnegut novels. In Slaughterhouse Five, they reveal that the universe will be accidentally destroyed by one of their test pilots, and there is nothing they can do about it.\n\nMontana Wildhack: A beautiful young model who is abducted and placed alongside Billy in the zoo on Tralfamadore. She and Billy develop an intimate relationship and they have a child. She apparently remains on Tralfamadore with the child after Billy is sent back to Earth. Billy sees her in a film showing in a pornographic book store when he stops to look at the Kilgore Trout novels sitting in the window. Her unexplained disappearance is featured on the covers of magazines sold in the store.\n\n“Wild Bob”: A superannuated army officer Billy meets in the war. He tells his fellow POWs to call him “Wild Bob”, as he thinks they are the 451st Infantry Regiment and under his command. He explains “If you’re ever in Cody, Wyoming, ask for Wild Bob”, which is a phrase that Billy repeats to himself throughout the novel. He dies of pneumonia.\n\nEliot Rosewater: Billy befriends him in the veterans’ hospital; he introduces Billy to the sci-fi novels of Kilgore Trout. Rosewater wrote the only fan letter Trout ever received. Rosewater had also suffered a terrible event during the war. Billy and Rosewater find the Trout novels helpful in dealing with the trauma of war. Rosewater is featured in other Vonnegut novels, such as God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (1965).\n\nBertram Copeland Rumfoord: A Harvard history professor, retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general, and millionaire. He shares a hospital room with Billy and is interested in the Dresden bombing. He is in the hospital after breaking his leg on his honeymoon with his fifth wife Lily, a barely literate high school drop-out and go-go girl. He is described as similar in appearance and mannerisms to Theodore Roosevelt. Bertram is likely a relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, a character in Vonnegut’s 1959 novel The Sirens of Titan.\n\nThe Scouts: Two American infantry scouts trapped behind German lines who find Roland Weary and Billy. Roland refers to himself and the scouts as the “Three Musketeers“. The scouts abandon Roland and Billy because the latter are slowing them down. They are revealed to have been shot and killed by Germans in ambush.\n\nBernard V. O’Hare: The narrator’s old war friend who was also held in Dresden and accompanies him there after the war. He is the husband of Mary O’Hare, and is a district attorney from Pennsylvania.\n\nMary O’Hare: The wife of Bernard V. O’Hare, to whom Vonnegut promised to name the book The Children’s Crusade. She is briefly discussed in the beginning of the book. When the narrator and Bernard try to recollect their war experiences Mary complains that they were just “babies” during the war and that the narrator will portray them as valorous men. The narrator befriends Mary by promising that he will portray them as she said and that in his book “there won’t be a part for Frank Sinatra or John Wayne.”\n\nWerner Gluck: The sixteen-year-old German charged with guarding Billy and Edgar Derby when they are first placed at Slaughterhouse Five in Dresden. He does not know his way around and accidentally leads Billy and Edgar into a communal shower where some German refugee girls from Breslau are bathing. He is described as appearing similar to Billy.\n\nStyle[edit]\n\nIn keeping with Vonnegut’s signature style, the novel’s syntax and sentence structure are simple, and irony, sentimentality, black humor, and didacticism are prevalent throughout the work.[8] Like much of his oeuvre, Slaughterhouse-Five is broken into small pieces, and in this case, into brief experiences, each focused on a specific point in time. Vonnegut has noted that his books “are essentially mosaics made up of a whole bunch of tiny little chips…and each chip is a joke.” Vonnegut also includes hand-drawn illustrations in Slaughterhouse-Five, and also in his next novel, Breakfast of Champions (1973). Characteristically, Vonnegut makes heavy use of repetition, frequently using the phrase, “So it goes”. He uses it as a refrain when events of death, dying, and mortality occur or are mentioned; as a narrative transition to another subject; as a memento mori; as comic relief; and to explain the unexplained. The phrase appears 106 times.[9]\n\nThe book has been categorized as a postmodern, meta-fictional novel. The first chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five is written in the style of an author’s preface about how he came to write the novel. The narrator introduces the novel’s genesis by telling of his connection to the Dresden bombing, and why he is recording it. He provides a description of himself and of the book-saying that it is a desperate attempt at creating a scholarly work. He ends the first chapter by discussing the beginning and end of the novel. He then segues to the story of Billy Pilgrim: “Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time”, thus the transition from the writer’s perspective to that of the third-person, omniscient narrator. (The use of “Listen” as an opening interjection has been said to mimic the opening “Hwaet!” of the medieval epic poem Beowulf.) The fictional “story” appears to begin in Chapter Two, although there is no reason to presume that the first chapter is not also fiction. This technique is common in postmodern meta-fiction.[10]\n\nThe narrator explains that Billy Pilgrim experiences his life discontinuously, so that he randomly lives (and re-lives) his birth, youth, old age, and death, rather than experiencing them in the normal linear order. There are two main narrative threads: a description of Billy’s World War II experience, which, though interrupted by episodes from other periods and places in his life, is mostly linear; and a description of his discontinuous pre-war and post-war lives. A main idea is that Billy’s existential perspective had been compromised by his having witnessed Dresden’s destruction (although he had come “unstuck in time” before arriving in Dresden).[11] Slaughterhouse-Five is told in short, declarative sentences, which create the impression that one is reading a factual report.[12]\n\nThe first sentence says, “All this happened, more or less.” (In 2010 this was ranked No. 38 on the American Book Review‘s list of “100 Best First Lines from Novels.”)[13] The opening sentences of the novel have been said to contain the aesthetic “method statement” of the entire novel.[14]\n\nThemes[edit]\n\nWar and death[edit]\n\nIn Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut attempts to come to terms with war through the narrator’s eyes, Billy Pilgrim. An example within the novel, showing Kurt Vonnegut’s aim to accept his past war experiences, occurs in chapter one, when he states that “All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn’t his. Another guy I knew really did threaten to have his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I’ve changed all the names.”[15] As the novel continues, it is relevant that the reality is death.[16] Slaughterhouse-Five focuses on human imagination while interrogating the novel’s overall theme, which is the catastrophe and impact that war leaves behind.[17] Death is something that happens fairly often in Slaughterhouse-Five. When a death occurs in the novel, Vonnegut marks the occasion with the saying “so it goes.” Bergenholtz and Clark write about what Vonnegut actually means when he uses that saying: “Presumably, readers who have not embraced Tralfamadorian determinism will be both amused and disturbed by this indiscriminate use of ‘So it goes.’ Such humor is, of course, black humor.”[18]\n\nReligion and philosophy[edit]\n\nChristian philosophy[edit]\n\nChristian philosophy is present in Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five but it is not very well-regarded. When God and Christianity is brought up in the work, it is mentioned in a bitter or disregarding tone. One only has to look at how the soldiers react to the mention of it. Though Billy Pilgrim had adopted some part of Christianity, he did not ascribe to all of them. JC Justus summarizes it the best when he mentions that, “‘Tralfamadorian determinism and passivity’ that Pilgrim later adopts as well as Christian fatalism wherein God himself has ordained the atrocities of war…”.[19] Following Justus’s argument, Pilgrim was a character that had been through war and traveled through time. Having experienced all of these horrors in his lifetime, Pilgrim ended up adopting the Christian ideal that God had everything planned and he had given his approval for the war to happen.\n\nTralfamadorian philosophy[edit]\n\nAs Billy Pilgrim becomes “unstuck in time”, he is faced with a new type of philosophy. When Pilgrim becomes acquainted with the Tralfamadorians, he learns a different viewpoint concerning fate and free will. While Christianity may state that fate and free will are matters of God’s divine choice and human interaction, Tralfamadorianism would disagree. According to Tralfamadorian philosophy, things are and always will be, and there is nothing that can change them. When Billy asks why they had chosen him, the Tralfamadorians reply, “Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is.”[20] The mindset of the Tralfamadorian is not one in which free will exists. Things happen because they were always destined to be happening. The narrator of the story explains that the Tralfamadorians see time all at once. This concept of time is best explained by the Tralfamadorians themselves, as they speak to Billy Pilgrim on the matter stating, “I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is.”[21] After this particular conversation on seeing time, Billy makes the statement that this philosophy does not seem to evoke any sense of free will. To this, the Tralfamadorian reply that free will is a concept that, out of the “visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe” and “studied reports on one hundred more,” “only on Earth is there any talk of free will.”[21]\n\nUsing the Tralfamadorian passivity of fate, Billy Pilgrim learns to overlook death and the shock involved with death. Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:\n\nThe most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. … When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is “So it goes.”[22]\n\nPostmodernism[edit]\n\nThe significance of postmodernism is a reoccurring theme in Kurt Vonnegut’s novel. In fact, it is said that post-modernism emerged from the modernist movement. This idea has appeared on various platforms such as music, art, fashion and film. In Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut uses postmodernism in order to challenge modernist ideas. This novel is oftentimes referred to as an “anti-war book”. Vonnegut uses his personal war knowledge to unmask the real horrors behind closed doors. Postmodernism brings to light the heart-wrenching truth caused by wars. Throughout the years, postmodernists argue that the world is a meaningless place with no universal morals. Everything happens simply by chance.[15][better source needed]\n\nMental illness[edit]\n\nSome have argued that Kurt Vonnegut is speaking out for veterans, many of whose post-war states are untreatable. Pilgrim’s symptoms have been identified as what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder, which didn’t exist as a term when the novel was written. In the words of one writer, “perhaps due to the fact that PTSD was not officially recognized as a mental disorder yet, the establishment fails Billy by neither providing an accurate diagnosis nor proposing any coping mechanisms.”[23] Billy found life meaningless simply because of the things that he saw in the war. War desensitized and forever changed him.[24]\n\nSymbols[edit]\n\nDresden[edit]\n\nVonnegut was in the city of Dresden when it was bombed; he came home traumatized and unable to properly communicate the horror of what happened there. Slaughterhouse-Five is the product of the twenty years of work it took for him to communicate it in a way that satisfied him. William Allen notices this when he says, “Precisely because the story was so hard to tell, and because Vonnegut was willing to take two decades necessary to tell it – to speak the unspeakable – Slaughterhouse-Five is a great novel, a masterpiece sure to remain a permanent part of American literature.”[25] Vonnegut’s claim of a death toll of 135,000 people was based on Holocaust denier David Irving‘s claim; the real number was closer to 25,000, but Vonnegut’s response was, “Does it matter?”[26] Historians claim that Vonnegut’s inflated number, and his false comparison to the Hiroshima atomic bombing propagates a false historical awareness.[27]\n\nFood[edit]\n\nBilly Pilgrim ended up owning “half of three Tastee-Freeze stands. Tastee-Freeze was a sort of frozen custard. It gave all the pleasure that ice cream could give, without the stiffness and bitter coldness of ice cream” (61). Throughout Slaughterhouse-Five, when Billy is eating or near food, he thinks of food in positive terms. This is partly because food is both a status symbol and comforting to people in Billy’s situation. “Food may provide nourishment, but its more important function is to soothe … Finally, food also functions as a status symbol, a sign of wealth. For instance, en route to the German prisoner-of-war camp, Billy gets a glimpse of the guards’ boxcar and is impressed by its contents … In sharp contrast, the Americans’ boxcar proclaims their dependent prisoner-of-war status.”[18]\n\nThe Bird[edit]\n\nThroughout the novel, the bird sings “Poo-tee-weet?” After the Dresden firebombing, the bird breaks out in song. The bird also sings outside of Billy’s hospital window. The song is a symbol of a loss of words. There are no words big enough to describe a war massacre.[28]\n\nAllusions and references[edit]\n\nAllusions to other works[edit]\n\nAs in other novels by Vonnegut, certain characters cross over from other stories, making cameo appearances and connecting the discrete novels to a greater opus. Fictional novelist Kilgore Trout, often an important character in other Vonnegut novels, is a social commentator and a friend to Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse-Five. In one case, he is the only non-optometrist at a party; therefore, he is the odd man out. He ridicules everything the Ideal American Family holds true, such as Heaven, Hell, and Sin. In Trout’s opinion, people do not know if the things they do turn out to be good or bad, and if they turn out to be bad, they go to Hell, where “the burning never stops hurting.” Other crossover characters are Eliot Rosewater, from God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater; Howard W. Campbell Jr., from Mother Night; and Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, from The Sirens of Titan. While Vonnegut re-uses characters, the characters are frequently rebooted and do not necessarily maintain the same biographical details from appearance to appearance. Trout in particular is palpably a different person (although with distinct, consistent character traits) in each of his appearances in Vonnegut’s work.[29]\n\nIn the Twayne’s United States Authors series volume on Kurt Vonnegut, about the protagonist’s name, Stanley Schatt says:\n\nBy naming the unheroic hero Billy Pilgrim, Vonnegut contrasts John Bunyan‘s “Pilgrim’s Progress” with Billy’s story. As Wilfrid Sheed has pointed out, Billy’s solution to the problems of the modern world is to “invent a heaven, out of 20th century materials, where Good Technology triumphs over Bad Technology. His scripture is Science Fiction, Man’s last, good fantasy”.[30]\n\nCultural and historical allusions[edit]\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five makes numerous cultural, historical, geographical, and philosophical allusions. It tells of the bombing of Dresden in World War II, and refers to the Battle of the Bulge, the Vietnam War, and the civil rights protests in American cities during the 1960s. Billy’s wife, Valencia, has a “Reagan for President!” bumper sticker on her Cadillac, referring to Ronald Reagan‘s failed 1968 Republican presidential nomination campaign. Another bumper sticker is mentioned, reading “Impeach Earl Warren,” referencing a real-life campaign by the far-right John Birch Society.[31][32][33]\n\nThe Serenity Prayer appears twice.[34] Critic Tony Tanner suggested that it is employed to illustrate the contrast between Billy Pilgrim’s and the Tralfamadorians’ views of fatalism.[35] Richard Hinchcliffe contends that Billy Pilgrim could be seen at first as typifying the Protestant work ethic, but he ultimately converts to evangelicalism.[36]\n\nReception[edit]\n\nThe reviews of Slaughterhouse-Five have been largely positive since the March 31, 1969 review in The New York Times newspaper that stated: “you’ll either love it, or push it back in the science-fiction corner.”[37] It was Vonnegut’s first novel to become a bestseller, staying on the New York Times bestseller list for sixteen weeks and peaking at No. 4.[38] In 1970, Slaughterhouse-Five was nominated for best-novel Nebula and Hugo Awards. It lost both to The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin. It has since been widely regarded as a classic anti-war novel, and has appeared in Time magazine’s list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923.[39]\n\nCensorship controversy[edit]\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five has been the subject of many attempts at censorship due to its irreverent tone, purportedly obscene content and depictions of sex, American soldiers’ use of profanity, and perceived heresy. It was one of the first literary acknowledgments that homosexual men, referred to in the novel as “fairies”, were among the victims of the Holocaust.[40]\n\nIn the United States it has at times been banned from literature classes, removed from school libraries, and struck from literary curricula.[41] In 1972, following the ruling of Todd v. Rochester Community Schools, it was banned from Rochester Community Schools in Oakland County, Michigan.[42] The circuit judge described the book as “depraved, immoral, psychotic, vulgar and anti-Christian.”[40] It was later reinstated.[43]\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court considered the First Amendment implications of the removal of the book, among others, from public school libraries in the case of Island Trees School District v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853 (1982) and concluded that “local school boards may not remove books from school library shelves simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by their removal to ‘prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.'” Slaughterhouse-Five is the sixty-seventh entry to the American Library Association‘s list of the “Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–1999” and number forty-six on the ALA’s “Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000–2009”.[41] In August 2011, the novel was banned at the Republic High School in Missouri. The Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library countered by offering 150 free copies of the novel to Republic High School students on a first-come, first-served basis.[44]\n\nCriticism[edit]\n\nCritics have accused Slaughterhouse-Five of being a quietist work, because Billy Pilgrim believes that the notion of free will is a quaint Earthling illusion.[45] The problem, according to Robert Merrill and Peter A. Scholl, is that “Vonnegut’s critics seem to think that he is saying the same thing [as the Tralfamadorians].” For Anthony Burgess, “Slaughterhouse is a kind of evasion—in a sense, like J. M. Barrie‘s Peter Pan—in which we’re being told to carry the horror of the Dresden bombing, and everything it implies, up to a level of fantasy…” For Charles Harris, “The main idea emerging from Slaughterhouse-Five seems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance.” For Alfred Kazin, “Vonnegut deprecates any attempt to see tragedy, that day, in Dresden…He likes to say, with arch fatalism, citing one horror after another, ‘So it goes.'” For Tanner, “Vonnegut has…total sympathy with such quietistic impulses.” The same notion is found throughout The Vonnegut Statement, a book of original essays written and collected by Vonnegut’s most loyal academic fans.[45]\n\nWhen confronted with the question of how the desire to improve the world fits with the notion of time presented in Slaugherhouse-Five, Vonnegut himself responded “you understand, of course, that everything I say is horseshit.”[46]\n\nAdaptations[edit]\n\nA film adaptation of the book was released in 1972. Although critically praised, the film was a box office flop. It won the Prix du Jury at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, as well as a Hugo Award and Saturn Award. Vonnegut commended the film greatly. In 2013, Guillermo del Toro announced his intention to remake the 1972 film and work with a script by Charlie Kaufman.[47]\n\nIn 1989, a theatrical adaptation was performed at the Everyman Theatre, in Liverpool, England.[48]\n\nIn 1996, another theatrical adaptation of the novel premiered at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. The adaptation was written and directed by Eric Simonson and featured actors Rick Snyder, Robert Breuler and Deanna Dunagan.[49] The play has subsequently been performed in several other theaters, including a New York premiere production in January 2008, by the Godlight Theatre Company. An operatic adaptation by Hans-Jürgen von Bose premiered in July 1996 at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, Germany. Billy Pilgrim II was sung by Uwe Schonbeck.[50]\n\nIn September 2009, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a feature-length radio drama based on the book, which was dramatised by Dave Sheasby, featured Andrew Scott as Billy Pilgrim and was scored by the group 65daysofstatic.[51]\n\nIn September 2020, a graphic novel adaptation of the book, written by Ryan North and drawn by Albert Monteys, was published by BOOM! Studios, through their Archaia Entertainment imprint. It was the first time the book has been adapted into the comics medium.[52]\n\n***************\n\n(22) (Material for our discussion of Slaughterhouse Five at our 12/2013 meeting) – from “External Essays”\n\nUpdated 9/8/19 by Dave Young\n\nTrivial Pursuit: The Slaughterhouse Five Edition (with thanks to Wikipedia)\n\nPage references correspond to Dial Press 2009 Trade Paperback Edition.\n\nPage 1. There really was a Bernard V. O’Hare. He lived in Hellertown, PA and for a time was the District Attorney for Northampton County, Bethlehem, PA. He died in 1990 at the age of 67. Vonnegut attended his funeral. Google him to read his bogus memoir (Vonnegutians should restrain themselves) and other interesting stuff about him.\n\nPage 12. There remains a Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. The Committee, founded in 1941, is interdisciplinary and can grant PhDs. Committee members from the past have included such lights as T.S. Eliot, Saul Bellow, Hannah Arendt, and Friedrich Hayek.\n\nPage 22. Der Grosse Goethe was only eleven when the Prussians destroyed most of Dresden in 1760. He went to nearby Leipzig in 1765 to begin his law studies and undoubtedly visited Dresden from there. Vonnegut does not bother to translate this passage from Goethe and it seems to be rather pedestrian and awkward to render in English. It does show that the musings of Germany’s greatest writer probably resonated with Vonnegut in his revulsion with the stupidity of war. Here is a crude translation: “From the dome of the Frauenkirche I saw this wretched rubble among the beautiful municipal orderliness; while the Sexton boasted to me about the art of the master builder who built this church and the dome to withstand such an unwished for event by making it bomb-proof. The good Sexton then pointed to all the ruins around us and said, reflectively and laconically: ‘This is what the Enemy has done.’” The Frauenkirche was finally brought down in the bombings of 1945 and the Soviets did not rebuild it. It is being slowly restored to its earlier glory.\n\nPage 23. Vonnegut writes of the “perfectly beautiful trouble” he was in and out of when he taught at the University of Iowa. He is probably referring to his affair with his very mature student, Loree Rackstraw (1931-2018), who has delicately written about their long relationship in “Love, As Always, Kurt” (2009 – Da Capo Press).\n\nPage 32. The character “Montana Wildhack” may have been a whimsical reference to an old friend from Shortridge High School, Margaret “Mig” Booth Jameson Wildhack (1921-1998). There is a photo of them in a Shortridge High School yearbook posing for the cast picture of a school play. Wildhack was from a socially prominent Indianapolis family (related to Ovid Butler and Booth Tarkington). She served in the Waves in WWII, married a well-known newspaperman, Bill Wildhack, and then served as a society columnist for the Indianapolis News in the 1960’s. Her son-in-law, Jim Poyser (recently the editor of NUVO) penned a poignant essay about her declining years in a piece for The Chicago Reader: “Living in the Moment.” http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/living-in-the-moment/Content?oid=892276\n\nPage 52. The story that Andre LeFevre took the obscene photograph of the girl and the Shetland Pony in 1841 is probably apocryphal. The state of the art in 1841 photography was such that the exposure time for film was about 20 minutes. To keep a subject, particularly a horny Shetland Pony, motionless for that long seems almost impossible. There are several Wikipedia entries for “Andre LeFevre” but none seem to fit KV’s description or time frame. Apparently the story is a complete fabrication.\n\nPage 57. Private Eddie D. Slovik. The story of the execution (in January 1945 after Ike signed his death warrant) of Pvt. Slovak made a deep impression on KV. Slovik was the only American soldier to be executed for desertion in WWII. KV had read the 1918 Libretto for Igor Stravinsky’s “L’Histoire du Soldat” and concluded it was a piece of crap. In 1993, he received a commission to rewrite the libretto and did so based on Slovik’s pathetic story. The piece was performed by the New York Philomusica Chamber Ensemble on March 8, 1993 at Alice Tully Hall.\n\nPage 72. VISIT AUSABLE CHASM, the bumper stick on Billy’s Caddy refers to a natural sandstone gorge in upstate New York that was once a tourist attraction. It was formed by the Ausable River which drains into Lake Champlain.\n\nPage 77. “The Serenity Prayer” is now associated with Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-stepper programs. Wikipedia tells me that the author was Reinhold Niebuhr. There are several minor variations. Vonnegut uses “to tell the difference” while Niebuhr and others use “to know the difference”.\n\nPage 79. In 1958, someone invented MAGIC FINGERS, a device that vibrated and rattled your hotel bed when you put a quarter into the slot of an attached tacky meter. By the late 1970’s over one million of these had been sold and placed in lower-priced motels. They were gone in about a decade due to terminal sleaziness. Reportedly, you can still find them in some down-at-the -heels motels in the Far West. If you want to recreate the unpleasant experience, you can buy a non-industrial version on the internet for $79.99.\n\nPage 111. “Valley of the Dolls” (1966) is a steamy, soft-porn, first novel by Jacqueline Susann. It is a roman a clef about life among drug-addled women caught up in the Hollywood film industry. It was the best selling novel of 1966 and as of 2016 was among the best-selling novels of all time with 31 Million sold. Vonnegut must have been envious. Three years later, “Slaughterhouse Five” was considered a hit with a sale of 800,000. According to Publishers Weekly, SH5 did not make the top ten in 1969 when it competed against “Portnoy’s Complaint” and “The Godfather.” I have not been able to find an all-time number. Susann is credited with revolutionizing the staid publishing industry by injecting a show business flair and emphasizing brand over talent.\n\nPage 121. An unfamiliar word: “rodomontades.” Merriam-Webster dictionary says: vain boasting or bluster; a bragging speech; a rant.\n\nPage 129. WACS and WAVES and SPARS and WAFS. Don’t try to match these letters up with any words. They refer respectively to women military volunteer units in WWII attached to the US Army, US Navy, US Coast Guard, and US Army Air Force. Each service also had a nurses corps. The women were usually assigned stateside in support positions. Exceptions were the nurses and the female ferry pilots who flew planes from the manufacturers to operational bases and also occasionally flew cargo. These units were gradually dissolved and ended completely in 1978 when they were integrated into non-combat units of the regular military services.\n\nPage 154. There seems to be no real model for Professor Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, but the family name is known to Vonnegut scholars. Winston Niles Rumfoord appeared in “Sirens of Titan” and Bokonon, in his secular life, worked as a gardener on the Rumfoord estate in “Cat’s Cradle.”\n\nPage 164. Kin Hubbard was Frank McKinney Hubbard, (1868-1930) an Indianapolis cartoonist, humorist and journalist who had a national following. The homespun quote about being poor came from the mouth of his daily cartoon character, Abe Martin, a rustic from bucolic Brown County, IN.\n\nPage 171. The battle for Hill 875 was one of a series of battles around Dak To, Republic of Vietnam in the fall of 1967. The 503rd Airborne Infantry Division sent three companies (330 men) on what some say was a suicidal mission to fight up a hill against about 2000 soldiers from the People’s Army who were well entrenched. When evening came on the first day, a Marine Fighter Jet dropped two 500 pound bombs on the perimeter of one of the companies killing 48 American soldiers. Reinforcements came the next day and the Peoples Army eventually abandoned Hill 875 but the Americans lost 87 killed, 130 wounded, and 3 missing in the 2/503 while 28 were killed, 123 wounded, and four missing in the 4/203. So it Goes. The US considered it a tactical victory, but it was a strategic victory for the Peoples Army. Ah, the clusterfuck of war.\n\nPage 178. Lazzarro’s revenge fantasy seemed to echo Berthold Brecht’s “Pirate Jenny” in “Die Dreigroschenoper.” I can hear Lotte Lenya in the phrasing!\n\nPage 192. This word “amoretti” is tricky. It is the plural diminutive of “Amore” which is of course the Latin word for Cupid. And you thought it was just a fancy liqueur?\n\nPage 206. Was “Howard W. Campbell, Jr” based on a historical character or was he merely the objective correlative of the existential angst of perverted loyalty? If you google his name you will find a faux biography and a lot of speculation by Vonnegut fans. I reviewed the bios of the seven American “traitors” who collaborated with the German Propaganda Ministry (primarily the Reich Rundfunk Gesellschalft). Herbert John Bergman, Donald S. Day, Douglas Chandler, Robert Henry Best, Edward Delaney, Max Otto Koiswich, and Fred W. Kaltenbach did not have much in common with Vonnegut’s character so Campbell is probably a “Composite Plus.”…..One of KV’s contemporaries was Howard C. Caldwell, Jr (Howe High School, Class of 1944). Caldwell was a radio operator on a minesweeper during WWII and was recalled to active duty for Korea. He spent this hitch as editor of a Navy newspaper at Great Lakes Naval Base. Vonnegut left the Chicago City News Bureau in about 1949, so there would have been no contact there. After the war he joined the NBC Indianapolis affiliate WFBM Channel 6 (now ABC affiliate WRTV) and anchored its evening news for decades. He died in 2017 in Indianapolis at the age of 92. Kurt liked to play around with the names of prominent Hoosiers and that may have been the case here.\n\nPage 224. “‘Leven Cent Cotton and Forty Cent Meat” was a folk song written by Memphis singer Bob Miller before the Great Depression. It became a hit in the 1930’s. Google it if you want to see the entire text.\n\nPage 225. “Nacreous” is another unfamiliar word. It means iridescent, in the way that Mother of Pearl is iridescent.\n\nPage 228. Typographical error? At the bottom of the page, Vonnegut writes “There were people who had been caught in the fire-storm. So it goes.” “They” would have worked better than “There” in the context, but this is arguable.\n\nPage 233. Vonnegut, who was once a Saab dealer, is probably pulling our leg when he writes about Valencia’s 1967? “Cadillac El Dorado Coupe de Ville.” He is conflating two different models, drawing some humor from the combination of two pretentious Spanish and French terms. The Eldorado 1967-1970 (seventh generation) was a two-door hardtop with (1970) 400hp engine. The DeVille 1965-70 is a less expensive model just below the Eldorado. The coupe is a two-door hardtop.The 1969 Coupe DeVille model was re-styled to resemble the Eldorado. After 2005 the badge was retired in favor of DTS (Deville Touring Sedan) So there never was an El Dorado Coupe De Ville.\n\nPage 236. In 1902, Theodore Roosevelt did say: “I could carve a better man out of a banana.” Teddy was talking about Oliver Wendell Holmes, whom he had chosen as Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, after Holmes voted against TR’s trust-busting legislation. KV has Professor Rumfoord put down Billy Pilgrim with the identical phrase.\n\nPage 237. President Harry Truman was aboard the USS Augusta in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean when the atomic bomb was dropped. He was returning from the Potsdam Conference. You can read the full statement (which ends on a less bellicose note) here: https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/august-6-1945-statement-president-announcing-use-bomb\n\nPage 238. David Irving’s non-fiction book “The Destruction of Dresden” (1963) has been discredited and is considered unreliable. He derived the figure of 135,000 dead from one questionable source. Various German commissions examined census and other documents and put the final figure around 25,000. The exact number will never be known as many uncounted refugees had come into Dresden from the east in advance of the Russian horde. The number of dead remained pegged at 135,000 for many years.\n\nPage 252. The epigraph is from the 19th Century British Christmas carol “Away in a Manger.” KV imputes Christlike qualities to Billy Pilgrim. “But the little Lord Jesus no crying he makes” is coupled to the silent pain that Billy endures.\n\nPage 253. There really was a US Navy ship called the “Lucretia A. Mott”. It was one of about 3,000 cheaply built cargo ships used in WW2. Records appear to have been lost, but it appears that she was partially reconfigured as a troop ship near the end of the war. She was scrapped in 1968.\n\nPage 254. The Royalton New York Hotel still exists at 44 West 44th Street. It has been renovated as a Boutique Hotel and current room rates (9/19) are around $225 per night.\n\nPage 255. George Jean Nathan (1882-1958) was a Ft Wayne-born Hoosier who went to the Big Apple and became a highly acclaimed drama critic. He attended Cornell University about 40 years before KV and both were editors at the Cornell Daily Sun and members of Quill and Dagger. I can find no evidence that they crossed paths in New York. Strangely, KV notes Nathan’s death in 1958 but does not follow it up with a “So it Goes.” That is the only instance in which he fails to so note a death.\n\nPage 261. KV reports that the time-traveling anthropologist who examined Jesus Christ on the cross found him to be 5 feet and 3.5 inches in height. Consensus of scientist who have studied skeletal remains is that the average Judean in the first century was 5 feet 6 inches in height. Outlier studies peg the average height at 5 feet 1 inch. The shroud of Turin indicates that Jesus may have been 6 feet tall. It appears that KV went for an average.\n\nPage 264. I am perplexed by KV’s reference to Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Billy Pilgrim’s fellow panelist on a radio talk show said “that it would be a nice time to bury the novel, now that a Virginian, one hundred years after Appomattox, had written “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” The only event that I can find in that time reference (1965) was a German film adaptation of the novel “Oncle Tom’s Hütte.” Perhaps this is just a comment on the stupidity of talk show guests.\n\nSOME MEMORABLE QUOTES FROM “SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE”\n\nPage 49. “Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.”\n\nPage 138. “Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure that he isn’t well connected.”\n\nPage 141. “That’s the attractive thing about war,” said Rosewater. “Absolutely everybody gets a little something.”\n\nPage 203. “All the real soldiers are dead.” So said the German lady who prepared lunches for the men of Slaughterhouse Five.\n\nPage 208. “There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces.”\n\nABOUT THE PHRASE “SO IT GOES”\n\nReliable sources say their machines confirm a word count of 106 for the phrase “So it goes” in “Slaughterhouse Five.” My low-tech weak eyes only spotted 103 and they are listed below.
