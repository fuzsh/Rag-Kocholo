        "text": "When I was in high school, this was one of Those Books, a book all the Cool Kids were talking about. I’ll admit that my idea of “Cool Kids” was somewhat different than what most people think of as Cool Kids. I was impressed by people – my brother, for instance, five years older than I – who had strong opinions and defended them vigorously, who talked about interesting ideas I’d never heard of, who referenced works I hadn’t read, authors I didn’t know (a trait that sticks with me to this day, a half-century later). My father wasn’t anti-book, but he didn’t understand spending good money on books (we weren’t poor; quite the contrary, we were solidly middle-class) when I already had books, so I bought books, including this one, on solo trips to the mall. He came of age back in the 1920s, when “papercovers” were Westerns and romances, so he never paid attention to the paperbacks on my shelf. Thus my shelf was full of paperback editions of books that would have horrified him – Herman Hesse, The Naked Ape (TV was a lot less explicit in those days, and Our Bodies Ourselves hadn’t been published yet, not that I would have had the nerve to buy it), The Bell Jar – had he bothered to check.\n\nI found this Vonnegut confusing. I was a very naïve teenager, and there was no Internet.\n\nLater, in college (and some time elapsed between high school and college; I was in my 30s when I finally spent two years as a full-time student finishing up my BA in English, which was originally supposed to be a BS in Information Systems but I changed my mind on the first day of my first semester when I realized I didn’t want to worry about data structures and algorithms for two years but would rather read and write), I read it again as part of some class. I understood better what was going on, but I still didn’t particularly enjoy it.\n\nWhen I started reading seriously as an adult, I kept running into praise for this book. The only thing I remembered from having read it twice was the guy executed for stealing a teapot, and something about another planet. “Everything was beautiful, and nothing hurt” didn’t stick with me, nor did “Poo-tee-tweet” or “So it goes.” I ended up skimming the book via commentary and reference.\n\nEarlier this year, I rediscovered this book on my shelves. I’d started a re-reading project a few years ago, including in each season a couple of books I’d read years ago and either liked very much, or didn’t like, to see how time had changed them. I was rather neutral on this one. It struck me as very much worth a re-read, which is how it ended up in this year’s In-Between Reading.\n\nI understood it much better; I saw a lot more of what was going on in terms of craft. But I was still curiously unmoved. Maybe it will take another half century – time I don’t have – to become one of the worshippers at the Vonnegut altar. But for now, it’s a book I can appreciate for how it’s written, for what it says. But it’s still a book I admire rather than love. Or even like. I don’t dislike it, mind you; it’s kind of an academic exercise with little attachment. That’s too bad; I so wanted to be a Cool Kid, finally, as I head towards my 70s.\n\nIt’s odd that I don’t particularly like this book; it’s got all kinds of things in it I should like.\n\nFor starters, the anti-war message is powerful.\n\nIt was first published in 1969, when the public opinion tide was beginning to turn on Vietnam. I don’t clearly remember, but I suspect this was the beginning of the narrative claiming WWII was the last “good” war. Vonnegut is here to show us, it wasn’t that good. I had to smile at the above quote, the outrage with which his friend’s wife reacted to the idea of movies turning war into heroism. Right now I’m in a Catherine Project reading group on Foucault, and this week’s assignment is “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History” which pretty much makes the same point: one of the primary functions of history is to reinforce whatever values we hold dear and assure us they go back into he past, but fact is, they often don’t. Vonnegut restricts his view to war: it isn’t about heroism and valor, it’s about people dying and losing everything and turning into disconnected zombies by the horror of it all. Neither Frank Sinatra nor John Wayne – nor, for that matter, Tom Hanks – ever served in the military.\n\nIt’s also an excellent description of PTSD. The term wouldn’t become part of the psychiatric toolbox until 1980, but the issues of wartime psychic distress were known as far back as the Civil War, when “soldier’s heart” described one physical aspect. In WWI, shell shock was the term used; WWII brought us combat stress. Turns out they’re all the same thing. Billy Pilgrim invented Tralfamadore and became unstuck in time to deal with it. I’m always somewhere between amused and outraged when this book is described as a science fiction novel; somehow it seems to me that means the reader has bought into Billy’s symptomology, which is certainly a compliment to the writer, but it overlooks what’s actually happening.\n\nCoupled with the time travel is the conundrum of free will. Billy finds/invents a planet that tells him time can be traveled, and that only Earth people believe in free will. I flash back to the line from Mad Men: “People will do anything to alleviate anxiety.” If there’s no free will, there’s no guilt.\n\nThe structure and narration of the book is unusual. It starts with something like an autobiographical passage direct from Vonnegut: but it’s not an introduction, it’s part of the story of how he came to write the book which follows. It’s his war buddy’s wife who points out how war is glorified by media, and extracts his promise to avoid such a thing. I hadn’t realized, until this reading, that the full title of the original work was Slaughterhouse-Five: or, The Children’s Crusade, A Duty-Dance with Death. It’s been truncated on every copy I’ve ever owned or seen.\n\nWhile the bulk of the novel is third person with Billy Pilgrim as the POV character, every once in a while an “I” crops up, as on page 125 (in my edition) in a conversation with his wife:\n\nAnd that’s where the sketch of a tombstone shows up with the epitaph, “Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt.” It isn’t necessarily a lie, by the way: PTSD can convince one of many things. That’s its function. There are people who insist this is actually inscribed on Vonnegut’s tombstone, but while his father’s grave is in Crown Hill in Indianapolis, Vonnegut Jr’s burial site is unknown.\n\nThis odd narration is another distancing technique: a way of dealing with the trauma while limiting its power. It’s also one of those very post-modern things, and is probably why I had no idea what was going on when I first read the book as a kid.\n\nGiven all this – and other features – I should love this book. I’m a little perplexed that, while I can appreciate the elements, I remain rather indifferent to it. Maybe it’s something like a reader’s version of PTSD, a way of keeping distance, that keeps me from loving it the way so many Cool Kids do. But more likely, I’m just not that Cool, and it looks like I never will be."
