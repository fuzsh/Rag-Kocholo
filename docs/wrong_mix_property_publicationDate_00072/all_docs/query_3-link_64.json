        "text": "You know what I say to people when I hear theyre writing anti-war books?\n\nNo. What do you say, Harrison Starr?\n\nI say, Why dont you write an anti-glacier book instead? \n\nWhat he meant, of course, was that there would always be wars, that they were as easy to stop as glaciers. I believe that, too.\n\nNote (Hals):\n\nIt now seems we might be getting closer to stopping glaciers.\n\n end note\n\nI wrote the Air Force back then, asking for details about the raid on Dresden, who ordered it, how many planes did it, why they did it, what desirable results there had been and so on. I was answered by a man who, like myself, was in public relations. He said that he was sorry, but that the information was top secret still.\n\nI read the letter out loud to my wife, and I said, Secret? My Godfrom whom?\n\nI have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction or glee.\n\nI have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.\n\nThose were vile people in both those cities, as is well known. The world was better off without them.\n\nAnd Lots wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.\n\nSo she was turned to a pillar of salt. So it goes.\n\nPeople arent supposed to look back. Im certainly not going to do it anymore.\n\nIve finished my war book now. The next one I write is going to be fun.\n\nThis one is a failure, and had to be, since it was written by a pillar of salt.\n\nThe most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.\n\nWhen a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is So it goes. \n\nThe Germans and the dog were engaged in a military operation which had an amusingly self-explanatory name, a human enterprise which is seldom described in detail, whose name alone, when reported as news or history, gives many war enthusiasts a sort of post-coital satisfaction. It is, in the imagination of combats fans, the divinely listless loveplay that follows the orgasm of victory. It is called mopping up.\n\nThe dog, who had sounded so ferocious in the winter distances, was a female German shepherd. She was shivering. Her tail was between her legs. She had been borrowed that morning from a farmer. She had never been to war before. She had no idea what game was being played. Her name was Princess.\n\nThe speaker at the Lions Club meeting was a major in the Marines. He said that Americans had no choice but to keep fighting in Vietnam until they achieved victory or until the Communists realized that they could not force their way of life on weak countries. The major had been there on two separate tours of duty. He told of many terrible and many wonderful things he had seen. He was in favor of increased bombings, of bombing North Vietnam back into the Stone Age, if it refused to see reason.\n\nBilly had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going, even though he was unenthusiastic about living. A lot of patients who saw the prayer on Billys wall told him that it helped them to keep going, too. It went like this:\n\nGOD GRANT ME\n\nTHE SERENITY TO ACCEPT\n\nTHE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE,\n\nCOURAGE\n\nTO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN,\n\nAND WISDOM ALWAYS\n\nTO TELL THE\n\nDIFFERENCE.\n\nAmong the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present, and the future.\n\nSeen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:\n\nAmerican planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.\n\nThe formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.\n\nWhen the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.\n\nIt was The Gospel from Outer Space, by Kilgore Trout. It was about a visitor from outer space, shaped very much like a Tralfamadorian, by the way. The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low.\n\nBut the Gospels actually taught this:\n\nBefore you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isnt well connected. So it goes.\n\nThe flaw in the Christ stories, said the visitor from outer space, was that Christ, who didnt look like much, was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe. Readers understood that, so, when they came to the crucifixion, they naturally thought, and Rosewater read out loud again:\n\nOh, boythey sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time!\n\nAnd that thought had a brother: There are right people to lynch. Who? People not well connected. So it goes.\n\nTheir most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times.\n\nMany novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.\n\nThe Americans arrived in Dresden at five in the afternoon. The boxcar doors were opened, and the doorways framed the loveliest city that most of the Americans had ever seen. The skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd. It looked like a Sunday school picture of Heaven to Billy Pilgrim.\n\nSomebody behind him in the boxcar said, Oz. That was I. That was me. The only other city Id ever seen was Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nBut what made the story remarkable, since it was written in 1932, was that it predicted the widespread use of burning jellied gasoline on human beings.\n\nIt was dropped on them from airplanes. Robots did the dropping. They had no conscience, and no circuits which would allow them to imagine what was happening to the people on the ground.\n\nTrouts leading robot looked like a human being, and could talk and dance and so on, and go out with girls. And nobody held it against him that he dropped jellied gasoline on people. But they found his halitosis unforgivable. But then he cleared that up, and he was welcomed to the human race."
