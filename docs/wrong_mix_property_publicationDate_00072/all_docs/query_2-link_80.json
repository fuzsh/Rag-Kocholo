        "text": "Slaughterhouse-Five, or the Children’s Crusade by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\n\nMy rating: 4 of 5 stars\n\nThe first-ever graphic novel adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great anti-war books.\n\nAn American classic and one of the world’s seminal antiwar books, Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five is faithfully presented in graphic novel form for the first time from Eisner Award-winning writer Ryan North (How to Invent Everything: A Survival Guide for the Stranded Time Traveler) and Eisner Award-nominated artist Albert Monteys (Universe!).\n\nListen: Billy Pilgrim has…\n\n…read Kilgore Trout\n\n…opened a successful optometry business\n\n…built a loving family\n\n…witnessed the firebombing of Dresden\n\n…traveled to the planet Tralfamadore\n\n…met Kurt Vonnegut\n\n…come unstuck in time.\n\nBilly Pilgrim’s journey is at once a farcical look at the horror and tragedy of war where children are placed on the frontlines and die (so it goes), and a moving examination of what it means to be fallibly human.\n\nWarnings: wartime, massacre, PTSD, animal cruelty, mentions of Holocaust\n\nNote: Not a YA novel\n\nNow, generally I am not inclined to read classic novels simply because I find prose styles of these quite different from modern styles in that they aren’t able to sufficiently engage me in the text. Which is why, seeing a graphic novel adaptation of Slaughterhouse-Five, I was interested, simply because sometimes medium matters. Now, the book is an anti-war themed story about a WWII veteran, Billy, who has the ability to time travel, which is why this book works on a non-linear timeline, with Billy slipping in and out of his present, going to the future or to the past, and it mainly centers around his time in the military, and the Dresden bombing. Billy is initially a part of a scout group, along with Roland and two others; the former two get captured and the other two get killed. He then lives as a prisoner of war, where the conditions are harsh and Roland dies from gangrene and entrusts his revenge to a fellow inmate, and then they are all moved into the camp where they are keeping British soldiers, and finally they are moved to Dresden to work.\n\nBilly, being a not-ideal soldier candidate, with his leaner physique and disinterest in the glory, makes for a good PoV to see the war through. Especially in the prisoner camp with the British soldiers, it becomes apparent that most of the soldiers are disillusioned with the war, or have come to realize the absurd cost of it. Roland, who is living for the glory of being a veteran forms a counterpoint to Billy, who just wants to escape this war. Most apparent is the fact that during tense moments, he travels to another moment in his life, so it is questionable whether he is actually time-traveling, but there are hints where it feels true like him knowing about events beforehand, like the flight that goes down later on, or him knowing when he’ll die. There are a lot of other things going on in the story, but the character of Billy himself remains unknown to us for the most part – I couldn’t figure out his reasoning for his choices or what he thought of certain events in his life. Even his abduction by aliens and being given another abducted woman as a bride basically, we don’t see what he truly feels in those scenarios – the only insight into him is his philosophy towards death and the impermanence of it for someone who can instead just see it as something that happens in this and every moment, at once.\n\nEventually, I don’t really know what I think of how the story and its themes are presented – I feel it detaches us from the character while involving us in the narrative. The artwork, though, is quite effective in presenting the story – with its handy charts and introductions to characters in three panels, or the way the time slipping is presented. The character design is also pretty good, and with clean lines and an aesthetically matching palette, it makes for a good graphic novel.\n\nReceived an advance reader copy in exchange for a fair review from Archaia, via Netgalley.\n\nView all my reviews"
