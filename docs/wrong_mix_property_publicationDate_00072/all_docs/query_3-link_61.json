        "text": "“After Trout became famous,” wrote Kurt Vonnegut in Breakfast Of Champions, “of course, one of the biggest mysteries about him was whether he was kidding or not.”\n\nKilgore Trout is a recurring character in Vonnegut’s books and the author of many science-fiction novels. Breakfast of Champions is the first book Vonnegut (the author of many science-fiction novels) wrote after Slaughterhouse-Five had made him famous. And the question of how seriously to take him confronts all his readers.\n\nThe question arises especially because Vonnegut himself loves to invoke it. Take the very first sentence of Slaughterhouse-Five: “All of this happened, more or less.” It’s real, he’s saying. In a way. All of it. Well, some of it. In the first chapter that follows, you can more or less believe he’s talking about events that are – just about – moored in reality. He tells us about his experiences in Dresden, visiting old war buddies, drunk-dialling, his current circumstances. At the very least it feels like stuff that could have happened in the 20th century.\n\nThat all changes at the start of chapter two, kind of:\n\n“Listen:\n\nBilly Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\n\nBilly has gone to sleep a senile widower and awakened on his wedding day. He has walked through a door in 1955 and come out another one in 1941. He has gone back through that door to find himself in 1963. He has seen his birth and death many times, he says, and pays random visits to all events in between.”\n\nThen comes the crucial two-word paragraph: “He says.”\n\nBilly Pilgrim says all those crazy things, the narrator tells us, but I don’t. Not necessarily, anyway. Because as the book goes on, something interesting happens. The narrator starts to tell us about some of Billy’s strangest adventures as if they are real. His abduction by aliens, for instance, is presented deadpan:\n\n“Overhead he heard the cry of what might have been a melodious owl, but it wasn’t a melodious owl. It was a flying saucer from Tralfamadore, navigating in both space and time … The saucer was one hundred feet in diameter, with portholes around its rim.”\n\nAnd so on. Should we choose, we can believe that the aliens really do take Billy away and really do help him find a place where “everything was beautiful and nothing hurt”.\n\nIt’s also possible that this spacecraft is a figment of Billy’s imagination. Most of the times Billy goes to Tralfamadore, he does so in response to trauma, or stimuli in the real world. It’s his way of escaping and reconfiguring a reality that hurts him. He is struggling to come to terms with the horrors he witnessed in the second world war. It’s easier to think about genial aliens who put forward interesting ideas about time and human mating habits.\n\nWe’re given strong hints that we should take this line. Towards the end of the novel, Billy even walks into a shop that contains the sci-fi novels and pornographic magazines that might have inspired his fantasy of being alone on an alien planet with the beautiful Montana Wildhack. But even if we do decide that this alternate world is just a place that Billy retreats to when he’s suffering from PTSD, reading about it still makes us question the nature of reality, what we should believe and how seriously we should take anything else in the book.\n\nThat’s not to say that all that questioning and thinking is hard work. Vonnegut makes it easy on us by making it funny. The Tralfamadorians may have a few complicated ideas about four-dimensional time – but they also look like “plumber’s friends”. Which is to say, sink plungers. Meanwhile, those ideas about time, where there is no cause and effect, allow Billy to “comfort so many people” by relieving them of the burden of guilt about past actions. They also enable Vonnegut to write beautiful passages, such as one in which Billy finds himself watching a war film backwards, sees warplanes shrinking fires in bombed cities, gather them into “cylindrical containers” and then take those bombs back to factories where they were disassembled and the minerals that made them were separated out and taken away to be buried in the ground “so they would never hurt anybody ever again”.\n\nBut before we get too warm and fuzzy, there is a flip side. All these moments of apparent unreality also force us to think about the things that really “happened” in Slaughterhouse-Five and to take them all the more seriously. The fantastical sections are generally fun and peaceful. The bombing of Dresden isn’t. And, as Vonnegut points out, the novel doesn’t really come close to describing the horrors he experienced in the war.\n\nTo give just one stark example, the character Billy Pilgrim was based on a real man called Edward Crone. But whereas Pilgrim went on to have that rich fantasy life, Vonnegut explained that Crone “died in Dresden. He simply gave up. He had what we call a thousand-mile stare. He sat down on the floor with his back against the wall and would not answer questions and would not accept water or food or anything and finally simply died. The war made absolutely no sense to him. And he was right. The war was nonsense. And he didn’t want to live in such a world any more.”"
