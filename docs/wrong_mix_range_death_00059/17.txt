Canadian jazz great Oscar Peterson has died at his home west of Toronto. He was 82.

Peterson was born in Montreal, the son of a railroad porter.

He began playing the piano at the age of five, and 10 years later he won first prize at a talent show. He was then invited to play weekly at a Montreal radio station.

He was renowned for his speed and virtuosity as a pianist, making hundreds of recordings even after his left hand was disabled by a stroke in 1993.

He played with such jazz stars as Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington.

During his career, he racked up seven Grammy awards, an International Jazz Hall of Fame Award and was named a Companion of the Order of Canada.

To many, he was known as the king of jazz pianists.

He died at his home in Mississauga, west of Toronto, of kidney failure.
