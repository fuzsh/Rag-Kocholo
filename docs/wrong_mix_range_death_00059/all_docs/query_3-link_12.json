        "text": "Peterson received all of Canada's highest honours during his lifetime\n\nJazz pianist and composer Oscar Peterson has died of kidney failure at his home in Toronto, at the age of 82.\n\nPeterson was one of jazz's most recorded musicians, and was famous for his fast-playing virtuoso style.\n\nHe made more than 200 albums and won eight Grammy awards, including a lifetime achievement honour in 1997.\n\nHe released his first single at the age of 19 and performed with greats such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington and Nat \"King\" Cole.\n\nThe Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame announced last month that it was to present the star with its Founder's Award in 2008.\n\nThe star shot to fame by winning a CBC talent contest at the age of 14\n\nThis was to celebrate \"a brilliant jazz pianist and composer\" who showed \"musical dexterity and energetic performances\", it said.\n\nPeterson, who had a working-class upbringing in Montreal, won a talent contest organised by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) when he was 14 years old.\n\n\"The world has lost an important jazz player,\" Hazel McCallion, mayor of Mississauga, Ontario, and Peterson's close friend, told CBC News.\n\n\"He's been going downhill in the last few months, slowing up,\" she added.\n\nHis studio and live partners included Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie and Stan Getz.\n\nPeterson played with Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie\n\nBasie once described Peterson as someone who \"plays the best ivory box I've ever heard\", while Ellington referred to him as \"Maharajah of the keyboard\".\n\nGifted at improvisation, Peterson said in 2005 how live free-form jazz could enable \"moments of great beauty to emerge\".\n\nHe was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian honour, and he was the first living Canadian to be depicted on a stamp.\n\nAccording to CBC, Peterson was married four times and had six children from his first and third marriages and one daughter, Celine, with his fourth wife, Kelly.\n\nYour thoughts -\n\nAbout forty years ago I was given as a leaving present by colleagues a collection of Oscar Peterson on LP which included a Hymn to Freedom. The first time I heard this number I made a wish that this track would be played at my cremation as my smoke wafted up the chimney. That's still the plan. If there's a heaven Oscar will be there and the music will live on.\n\nPeter Relf, Ockley, United Kingdom\n\nHe was number ONE of all jazzmusicians. I met him 6 times in concerts in Norway. Last time, two years ago, in Oslo Consethall. I will miss him. He is for me a big legend. I will listen to his records and remember my meetings with deep respect.\n\nBjarne E. Lihaug, Dals√∏yra\n\nHours of pleasure that man's music has given me. His timing, unique phrasing and arrangements of some of the old standards have gone from my 33 1/3 albums onto the jazz playlist of my iPod.\n\nKate Paine, Honoloulu USA\n\nJust to say the Poker of Aces, Louis Amstrong, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and Oscar Peterson, no one will replace those diamonds perfectly polished, now the Jazz music remain orphan, I was several years looking for his \"C Jam Blues\" record in spite of Duke Ellington' stamp, Oscar Peterson did his special touch but in an unrepeatable way that no one can do. It is a sad day to me.\n\nJuan A. Iglesia, Sevilla, Spain"
