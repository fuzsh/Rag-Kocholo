She was born on May 20, 1929. She was the third of four children born to Cecil and Louvenia Haga in Kingsport, TN. Although she was born during the Great Depression, she was anything but depressing. At an early age, it was clear she was colorful and exuberant. Always performing, she loved singing, dancing, and entertaining an audience. She graduated from Sullivan High School in Kingsport in 1947. She was nicknamed \"Spud\" and was involved in the 4-H and Drama clubs. As a teenager, she sang in a ladies quartet, \"The Silver Bells,\" and traveled the general area of Kingsport, providing music for many audiences. In 1949, she married her seventh grade valentine, Charles Benton Pierson. A few years into their marriage, Chuck enlisted in the Air Force and thus began their many travels to various bases in the U.S. and Europe. She was proud to be an Air Force wife and soon found herself doing volunteer work on the bases. One of her favorite jobs was being a Gray Lady in the military hospitals. She had a heart for the young men serving the United States and considered them her brothers and friends. This was her true calling, taking care of others. She had great memories of being a part of the 21st Fighter Bomber Wing deployed to France in the early 50's. This was a big adventure for a young lady from a small town in the south. Due to many health challenges, she was able to empathize with those who were ill. She proudly tells the story of being in the same room with Miss Polly Hopkins of the Johns Hopkins family. She was the youngest patient on the ward, and Miss Polly named her \"Whistle Bait,\" since she was also the cutest patient in the hospital!\n\nShe was a loving mother to Carla, who they adopted in Nurnberg, Germany. She was the favorite mom of just about every kid on the block. She was the only one who would get outside and play with the kids, turning cartwheels with the best of them.\n\nShe moved to Wenatchee in 1972, having declared in the second grade that she wanted to live in the area where Lewis and Clark traveled. She loved the Pacific Northwest. For four years, she worked for a plastic surgeon and was once again caring for others. She retired and simply enjoyed life with her husband until his passing in 1979. She loved to travel and she and Carla went to Europe in 2009. This was one of the highlights of her life, being able to return to Carla's birthplace and enjoy the places she and Chuck had lived so many years ago. She had a \"bigger than life\" personality and it took that personality to journey through five years of difficult health issues. Even in the midst of the worst health, she never gave up hope. She was very grateful for the many doctors and nurses who cared for her. She will be missed and remembered by many. We loved her and she loved us. We treasure all the moments and will hold her in our hearts always.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Carla of Wenatchee; her youngest sister, Helen of Powhatan, VA; and various nieces and nephews.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held Thursday, June 16, 2011, at 2:00 p.m. at Telford's Chapel of the Valley in East Wenatchee.
