        "text": "Canadian jazz great Oscar Peterson has died at his home west of Toronto. He was 82.\n\nPeterson was born in Montreal, the son of a railroad porter.\n\nHe began playing the piano at the age of five, and 10 years later he won first prize at a talent show. He was then invited to play weekly at a Montreal radio station.\n\nHe was renowned for his speed and virtuosity as a pianist, making hundreds of recordings even after his left hand was disabled by a stroke in 1993.\n\nHe played with such jazz stars as Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington.\n\nDuring his career, he racked up seven Grammy awards, an International Jazz Hall of Fame Award and was named a Companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nTo many, he was known as the king of jazz pianists.\n\nHe died at his home in Mississauga, west of Toronto, of kidney failure."
