        "text": "The spectacular piano technique of Oscar Peterson, one of the world's best known jazz pianists, will be remembered today, following his death at his home in Canada, aged 82. In a career that spanned seven decades, Peterson played with some of the biggest names in jazz, including Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie, and led a popular trio with bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis in the 1950s.\n\nCanadian Peterson released his first single aged 19, and went on to record more than 200 albums and win multiple Grammy awards, including a lifetime achievement honour in 1997. Today, the world paid tribute to a 'technical and creative master'.\n\nShare your tributes to and memories of Oscar Peterson in the comments section below.\n\n· Read John Fordham's tribute to Oscar Peterson here.\n\n· Watch Oscar Peterson perform with Ray Brown and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen below:\n\n>"
