        "text": "FARAI CHIDEYA, host:\n\nMaster jazz pianist Oscar Peterson has died. Peterson's career spanned seven decades. Over that time, the Canada native won international fame for his supreme technique, clarity of sound, speedy fingers and driving swing.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nCHIDEYA: Peterson could front a band like no other. He also played behind some of the greatest names in jazz, including Lester Young, Dizzy Gillespie, Billy Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. Oscar Peterson was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1925. A stern father kept him focused on classical piano. Jazz wasn't his national heritage but his record player put him in tune with the sound of the States and the artist who create it.\n\nMr. OSCAR PETERSON (Musician): I listened to them. Sometimes I played with at home with the records. So then when I had to play with them in person, I sort of have a bit of a jump on their musical personality, even though I ain't.\n\nCHIDEYA: In 1993, a stroke slowed Peterson down, but not before he made countless recordings. Peterson died earlier this week at his home in Toronto. He was 82 years old. As French President Nicolas Sarkozy put it this week, one of the bright lights of jazz has gone out.
