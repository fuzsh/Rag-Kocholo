Profession: Jazz Musician

Biography: Oscar Peterson was a Canadian jazz pianist and composer who is considered one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time.

Peterson grew up in Montreal and began playing piano at a young age. He studied classical piano but was also exposed to jazz in his predominantly black neighborhood. By his early teens, Peterson had already won a national music competition and was impressing professional musicians with his skills.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Peterson gained a reputation as a brilliant and inventive pianist. He worked with bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Barney Kessel in a popular trio. Peterson was influenced by pianists like Art Tatum and Nat King Cole.

Throughout his career, Peterson won eight Grammy Awards and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. He suffered a stroke in 1993 that weakened his left hand and reduced his playing ability. Peterson died in 2007 at his home in Mississauga, Ontario.

Duke Ellington called Peterson the "Maharaja of the keyboard," while Peterson's friends called him "O.P."
