Washington Correspondence of yesterday's

- ACff xuixi xiuica.

The assignment of Mr. Morrison, of

Illinois. Mr. Kerr's best friend, to the

head of the Ways and Means Com

mittee, consequently the leadership

of the House, does not strike

the . older - members as within

the range ot propriety or precedent, but

it is BUluoiimi-iveij tttKieu io-uigui, tuat,

althouzh Mr. Morrison has never served

upon that oommittee, and has been only

one term in Congress he is to be so as

signed. ,

f Washington Correspondence ol

yesterday's

. a. i. woriu.

Gen. Morrison, who has been seleoted

by Mr. Kerr as the Chairman of the

ways ana .means committee, is

a gentleman of unoeminort knowl

edge and of great probity, patriotism,

and persistence. ' He Is one of the

weightiest men in counoil, and the most

prompt and resolute in action in this

congress, trusted in nis state ana

throughout the West, a Hard-Money

man, a revenue-tariff mau, and one

thoroughly imbued with the latest and

best ideas of tho reformed Democracy,

steering between Scylla and Charybdis.

But General Morrison's selection tor

this important post makes it by no

means certain that he will lead the

open House. To be sure the leadership

ot the House has usually been con

ceded to the Chairman of the Ways

and Means Committee and maintained by

him through whole sessions. But it is

likely enough that Speaker Kerr, who

could hardly have selected General Mor

rison for his power as an orator or in

debate, has trusted to his honesty and

judgment rather, and is willing to let

the noor isaaersuip oi tne House oe as

sumed by whomsoever is intrinsically

capable oi it.

Wood and Mr. Cox lor the chairman

and this, with the belief of the Speaker

that the Mississippi Valley is entitled

night that ne win not accept tne posi

tion. The Committee is believed tu be,

with two exceptions, composed entirely

of hard-money men. The Chairman, Mr.

Morrison, has been one of the most pro

nounced and uncompromising advo

cates ot honest currency in the West,

and in 1874 distinguished himself in. the

Demooratio and Liberal Convention at

Springfield by the ability and zeal

with which he .labored and spoke

to prevent his party from commit

ting itself to the inflation heresy.

He did this, too, when his friends be

lieved that it would cost him a lenomi

natiou to Congress. Of course tbis com

mittee will not lavor any of the schemes

of the inflationists, nor will It roport any

bill for the paymeut of all or any part of

the duties on imports in paper money.

Washington Correspondence of yesterday's

Committe on Ways and Means Mor

rison, of Illinois, chairman; Fernando

Wood, Thomas ot Maryland, Randolph

Tucker of Virginia, Ben-Hill, Hancock

of Texas, Blaine, Burchard, William D.

Kelley, Garfield, Chapin ot Massachu

setts. This committee, it will be seen, is a

very strong one. There is reason to be

lieve that Wood, will consider his as

signment to the second place a degrada

tion, and that he will in oonsequenoe

decline committee-service altogether.

He has said as muob. tlic committee is

a hard niooey committee. With, possi

bly, two exceptions, the entire commit

tee is in favor of specie resumption.

The Committee will never in

dorse the greeubaok heresy of sub

sfitutiug paper for gold in pay

ment of oustoms duties. Morrison re

ceived the Chairmanship for the reason

that the Speaker is of the opinion that

the Mississippi Valley is entitled to this

Chairmanship at the hands 6t Kerr, and

for the reason that he managed Kerr's

campaign for the Speakership.

- Old Bozer.up on Pine street, is a mean

father. - When one of bis boys asks him

fora pair of skates he inquires:

"My son, would you la your life down

for mef"

"Yes, father, I would," is the reply.

- "Then you can't hate the skates, for

to die- for me would be wicked and un

Then when the other Boy asks for a

sled the father ipquif e:

"My squ, would jrou die for qieP

'No, sir,' promptly replies the boy.

"You wouldn't, eb Well, a boy who

wouldn't die for bis father doesn't de

serve a sled, aud you won't get one I"

And by working it that way Old Bozer

keeps the whole ramily on the edge of

ragged despair. Detroit Free Press.
