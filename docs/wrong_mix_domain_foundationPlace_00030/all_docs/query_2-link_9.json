DUKE OF ARGYLL, K.G., K.T., A British Statesman and a Scottish Patriot, This Book Is Respectfully Dedicated. PREFACE. The following pages form a modest contribution to those local, secular, and ecclesiastical records of interesting places in our land which are a little removed from the more stirring domains of Scottish history. The author, having resided for over twenty years in the district, has been able to glean his facts from various sources, chiefly the recollections and experiences of aged natives and residents, many of whom have passed away. Much, therefore, of what must irrevocably have been lost is here set down, and it is hoped that the peculiar attractiveness of the beautiful Peninsula, and its inherent poetic and pictorial charms, may render the volume acceptable. Hardly anything has ever been written about Eosneath, and the tiny rills which it has contributed to the noble stream of Scottish history have but gently meandered on their way. But not a few remarkable men have wandered by its pebbly strand, and inhaled the pure air of its heathery braes, and it is hoped that many may welcome this effort to bring the manifold fascinations of the Penin- sula under the notice of a wider circle.

Past <md Present. The beautiful Peninsula of Eosneath forms part of the County of Dunbarton, which has been the scene of many stirring episodes in our national history. It was a portion of the ancient territory of Strathclyde, whose capital, Dunbarton, or Dunbritton, figured con- spicuously in the story of Roman occupation and throughout the fierce conflicts of the ancient Britons, Picts, and Scots. Amongst the earlier tribes who lived in the country Druidism was the prevailing religion, and it is quite possible that in some of the secluded glens of the Rosneath Peninsula, were beheld, in olden times, many idolatrous and mystic rites. The Britons of Strathclyde had enough to do to protect themselves against plundering inroads of the Picts. About A.D. 508, the famous Prince Arthur, who had been elected ruler or Pendragon by the chiefs, seems, if ancient chronicles can be credited, ROSNEATH to have fixed one of his seats of authority at Alcluid, as Dunbarton was styled in those days. Coming down later in the stream of time we find the Vikings or Northern Sea Kings, who had settled on the Irish coast, crossing the channel and establishing themselves, for a brief period, on the land adjacent to the estuary of the Clyde. They plundered Alcluid and ravaged the neighbouring country in the year 875. When the Britons of Strathclyde, enfeebled by incessant attacks of their enemies, migrated to the vicinity of their kindred in Wales in the year 890, the kingdom they dominated dwindled into anarchy and obscurity, until the Scots of Dalriada finally annexed their territory in the time of Kenneth III. The Danes, who were such sore scourges to both England and Scotland, afterwards ravaged the shores of the Frith of Clyde, and Dunbritton, or Fort of the Britons, as Dunbarton came to be known, often saw their hostile ships pass her ramparts. Readers of history know that later on, Haco, King of Norway, in the year 1263, set forth to punish the excesses of those whom he considered his unruly subjects in the Western Isles of Scotland, The expedition, which was under Magnus, King of the Isle of Man, proceeded up the waters of Loch Long, which separates the Rosneath Peninsula from the Gareloch. Sailing along its heath-clad mountainous shores to the head of Loch Long, the invaders dragged their boats across the narrow neck of land over to the gravelly strand of the beautiful Loch Lomond. Here they indulged their savage propensities in PAST AND PRESENT. ravaging the country around the Loch, almost reducing it to a soli- tude, and further, carried fire and sword far into the confines of Dunbarton and Stirling shires. Vengeance, however, in the wrath of the elements, overtook the marauders, for in retiring with their plunder from Loch Long, a great storm arose and scattered the fleet. Gathering together his forces to their rescue, as well as he could, the Norwegian king subsequently saw his expedition utterly vanquished at the celebrated Battle of Largs. The County of Dunbarton after this was frequently mixed up with the general course of Scottish history, and the Eosneath Peninsula was from time to time, the scene of striking episodes. It was visited in the course of his romantic career, by the great hero of Scotland, Sir William Wallace. One day, when pursued by his enemies, the hero on his gallant steed leaped from the summit of a lofty rock not far from Eosneath Castle, and, though the horse was killed, his rider gained the shore and swam across the entrance of the Gareloch to the opposite point of Cairndhu, and made good his escape. In \" Blind Harry \" we read how he sacked Dunbarton, then after burning the Castle of Eosneath, he went to Faslane Castle, near the upper end of the Gareloch, and was received by his friend the Earl of Lennox. As is also well known, another great Scottish hero king, Eobert the Bruce, passed many of his latter days within sight of Eosneath Peninsula, in his Castle at Cardross. Enthusiastic votaries of the patriot king go to search for the remains of the royal residence at this spot, but there is hardly any trace now to be found. All frag- ROSNBATH. menta of the building have long since disappeared, but the site is generally supposed to be a wooded knoll on the farm of Castlehill, between Oardross and Dunbarton. The King spent a good deal of his leisure time in building pleasure boats, as well as warlike vessels, which he sailed on the placid estuary of the Clyde, and he doubtless often found his way up the landlocked waters of the Gareloch. He lived as became a powerful monarch at Oardross, and handsomely entertained such of the nobility and clergy as came to pay their homage at his court. King Robert died on 7th June, 1329, in the 55th year of his age, lamented by the Scottish nation, whose liberties he had secured. His pathetic charge on his deathbed to Sir James Douglas, the \" brave and gentle knight,\" is well known, and how he told his friend that the dear wish of his heart was to set out for Oriental lands, especially Palestine, to carry on war, in person, against the enemies of his Lord and Saviour. The dying hero en- joined the good knight to take his embalmed heart, accompanied by his devoted followers, to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jeru- salem, and there deposit it in the sanctuary. And the story goes on to narrate how the King's faithful friend duly set off on his ad- venturous journey with a body of chosen companions, and on their way to Jerusalem encountered their Saracen foes. When the enemy's cavalry surrounded the gallant Douglas, and he was about to be borne down by their numbers, he took the silver casket, which with its precious contents, the heart of Bruce, was hung across his neck, and flung it into the serried array of horsemen, PAST AND PRESENT. \"Pass onward,\" exclaimed the knight, \"as thou was wont, and Douglas will follow thee or die.\" Another distinguished name in Scottish history was for long interwoven with the stirring events which have taken place in Eosneath and neighbourhood, namely, the powerful family of the Lennox. Much of the land of the Peninsula and on the shores of the Gareloch was, for centuries, in the possession of the Earls of Lennox, an ancient race. But about the year 1425, the head of the family and various of his near relations were put to death at Stirling. And in 1489, the Earl of Lennox having been engaged in treasonable practices, his lands were confiscated, although as appears from the records of the Scottish Parliament, he was pardoned for the offence. Still the forfeiture of his lands was not withdrawn, for in 1489 the lands of Eosneath were awarded to Colin, first Earl of Argyll. Thus the greatest part of the southern half of the Peninsula was conveyed to the Argyll family, whose genius has so permanently impressed itself upon the history of their country and clan. There were several other properties in Eosneath, such as those of Campbell of Peatoun, Campbell of Mamore, Campbells of Carrick, Cumming of Barremman, some of which only came into possession of the Argylls well on in the eighteenth century. The estates of Peatoun on Loch Long side, and Barremman on the Gareloch, were never acquired by the Argylls ; the former being still, and for centuries before, owned by a Campbell, no doubt a scion of the powerful \"Clan Diarmid.\" Their holding in the \"Island of Eosneath,\" as the Peninsula was styled in the old title deeds, brought ROSNEATH. the Argyll family into more immediate connection with the Low- landers. The Earl of Argyll who first owned Eosneath was a man of some note, sagacious and upright, and he filled several important posts, amongst them Lord High Chancellor of Scotland, and Pleni- potentiary at the famous Northampton Conference. It was of much advantage to the district of Eosneath when so powerful a nobleman as the head of the Clan Campbell came to reside on the Gareloch, especially when the fourth Earl of Argyll adopted the Protestant faith. This Earl was the first amongst the Scottish nobility to em- brace the reformed religion, and history records the grand stand which his descendants made against the eneroachments of Popery, and in defence of the religion and liberties of their country. At the upper end of the Gareloch, the Eosneath estate is bounded by the ancient property of Faslane, which was once possessed by the dis- tinguished family of Lennox, though, for some time past, this has been the property of Sir James Colquhoun of Luss. The famUy of Lennox was an old one, the first Earl, Alwyn, being the earliest representa- tive of the race of whom history gives account, and he flourished about the middle of the twelfth century. His descendant, another Alwyn, succeeded to the title and estates ; one of his sons, Aulay by name, owning the lands of Faslane. They also possessed an estate near the Castle of Dunbarton, residing often in the Castle. In addi- tion to their other extensive territories, the Lennox family, whose revenues were large, owned land at Balloch at foot of Loch Lomond, besides being judges and lawgivers in the district, when they had PAST AND PEESENT. feudal jurisdiction. The names are well known in Scottish history, and the collateral branches of the house embraced some distinguished personages, amongst them Napier of Merchiston. But the fortunes of the family gradually dwindled, and the title and estates became merged in the Crown in the sixteenth century by the marriage of Lord Darnley with Mary Queen of Scots. The family of the Colquhouns of Colquhoun and Luss, whose fine estates dominate the whole of the eastern side of the Gareloch, is one of great antiquity. Its origin is of very remote date, one of the earliest representatives of the race being alleged to be none other than the famous chieftain Galgacus, who contended with the Eomans at the battle of the Grampians. In the reign of King David II., Sir Eobert Colquhoun of that Ilk married the heiress of the house of Luss, and from that period the name frequently occurs in contem- porary records of Scottish history. For a time also the Oolquhouns appear to have owned territory in the Eosneath Peninsula. In 1472 the lands of Eosneath seem to have been acquired, through grant from the Crown, by Sir John Colquhoun, — the same who, in the previous year, was made Sheriff-Principal of Dunbartonshire. This Knight was in 1474 raised to the dignity of Grand Chamberlain, and was sent to England with full plenipotentiary powers to arrange a marriage between two of the younger members of the royal families. Though the marriage did not take place, the King was much satisfied with the wisdom displayed by Sir John Colquhoun throughout his mission, and made him governor for life of Dunbarton Castle. As ROSNBATH. showing how extensive were the possessions of the Colquhoun family at one time, it would appear they held the greater part of the territory of Lennox. They obtained charters under the Great Seal of the lands of Eosneath, Colquhoun, Dumbuck, Garscube, Walton, Dunglass and others, besides grants from the Earls of Lennox of fishings in Loch Lomond, the Leven, and the Gareloch, which were held as separate subjects from their other properties. The 13th head of the Colquhoun family, Sir John, is mentioned in the famous \" Casket Letters \" which passed between Queen Mary and the Earl of Bothwell. Sir John so far remained friendly to the Queen after Darnley's murder, and refused the call to arms made by the Eegent Moray at Maxwellheuch, although at a subsequent date he seems to have forsaken the cause of the hapless Queen and fought against her at Langside. The Colquhouns were supporters of the Royalist cause at the crisis of the great civil war, and their ancient stronghold of Eossdhu was besieged by Cromwell's soldiers, and they were no friends to either nonconformists or covenanters. Another of the old lords of the soil on the Gareloch was that of Macaulay of Ardencaple, descended from a younger son of Alwyn Earl of Lennox. This family seems to have settled as landowners in the district in the 13th century. Their estates stretched from Cardross on the east, to the head of the Gareloch, and embraced the whole of the land on which the modern town of Helensburgh stands. There were two residences on the estate, one the old ivy-clad castle of Ardencaple, part of which, with some modern additions, still stands PAST AND PRESENT. amidst fine lofty trees near Cairndhu Point, and the small keep of Faslane near the bay of the same name on the Gareloch. About two hundred years ago the fortunes of the family began to decline, and the then laird, Aulay M'Aulay, had to dispose of his estates to the Colquhouns, and the last of the family died at Eow in 1767. The Argyll family having been so long connected with the Penin- sula of Eosneath, it may be well to give a few details regarding this powerful Highland clan. According to the genealogists of the Argyll family, their predecessors, on the female side, were possessors of Lochow, in Argyllshire, as far back as the year 404. In the eleventh century, Archibald Campbell, a gentleman of Anglo-Norman lineage, acquired the lordship of Lochoiv by marriage with Eva, daughter of the lord of Lochow. Sir Colin Campbell of Lochow, sixth in descent, distinguished himself by his warlike actions, and was knighted by King Alexander the Third in 1280. He was famed for his prowess and added greatly to the possessions of the family, and from him the chief of the Argyll family is styled in Gaelic Mac Chaillan Mor. Sir Colin, who was slain in 1294 in a battle with the Lord of Lorn, and his son. Sir Neil, fought with King Eobert the Bruce in most of his great battles. His eldest son. Sir Colin, accompanied the Bang to Ireland, and married a daughter of the house of Lennox. Passing by his son. Sir Archibald, we come to Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochow, who first assumed the designation of Argyll, and became a lord of Parliament in 1445 under the title of Lord Campbell, and was buried at Kilmun. His grandson, Colin, 10 ROSNBATH. was first created Earl of Argyll in 1457, and acquired the lands of Rosneath in 1489. He was one of the commissioners for negotiating a truce with King Edward the Fourth of England in 1463, was one of the commissioners sent to France to renew the treaty with that Crown in 1484, and became Lord High Chancellor of Scotland. The Earl died in 1493, and shortly afterwards Archibald, his son, the second Earl, acquired the fine property of Castle Campbell, near Dollar, in 1497, by grant of confirmation by James the Fourth, which remained in the family till 1808, when it was sold. At the fatal battle of Flodden, 9th September, 1513, the Earl of Argyll was killed along with his brother-in-law, the Earl of Lennox, and the flower of the Scottish nobility. Passing by Colin, the third Earl, we come to Archibald, fourth Earl of Argyll, who distinguished him- self at the disastrous battle of Pinkie in September 1547, and was the first of the Scottish nobility who embraced the principles of the Reformation. Archibald, the fifth Earl, distinguished himself as one of the most able of the Lords of the Congregation. His name appears in the famous bond subscribed by some of the nobility in favour of Queen Mary's marriage with Bothwell, in which afiair he seems to have played a double part. He carried the Sword of State at the coronation of James the Sixth, 29th July 1567, and was appointed Lord High Chancellor in 1572. The first of the family who took a really commanding place in Scottish history and affairs, was Archibald, eighth Earl, and first Marquis of Argyll, who was born in 1598, son of Archibald, seventh Earl, by Lady Anne Douglas, daughter of the Earl PAST AND PEESENT. 11 of Morton. He attended the famous General Assembly of the Church of Scotland held in Glasgow in 1638, and in 1641, when Charles I. came to Scotland, he was created first Marquis of Argyll. In 1644 Argyll was commissioned by the Convention in Edinburgh to raise an army to oppose the Marquis of Huntly, who had hoisted the Standard of Rebellion. This he did, and throughout the year was engaged in various hostilities in different parts of Scotland, reaching Inverurie, in Aberdeenshire, in October, with an army of 2500 foot and 1200 horsemen, when he found himself close to the camp of Montrose with a much inferior force. Argyll attacked the army of Montrose, and threw the followers of the latter into confusion, but after a time they were rallied and assailed their foes with success, forcing Argyll to draw off his men. In February 1645, Argyll's troops were totally defeated at the battle of Inverlochy by his powerful rival Montrose, when some 1500 of his family and name were kUled. Shortly afterwards, at the battle of Kilsyth, his counsel was disadvantageous to the Covenanters, who were signally defeated by Montrose. It was not so much as a warrior that Argyll achieved distinction, but as a statesman and a patriot. Very strongly attached to the Presbyterian party, the Marquis sought to bind Charles II., when he came as a fugitive to Scotland, to support that form of religious observance. At the coronation of the King at Scone in January 1651, Argyll placed the crown on Charles' head, and was the first to swear allegiance to him. His signal services to the royal cause were ill requited by the worthless King, who caused 12 ROSNEATH. Argyll to be imprisoned in the Tower for five months, and afterwards sent as a prisoner for trial to Edinburgh. The offence alleged against the Marquis was that he accepted the Protectorate and Government of Cromwell, and was present at the meeting of Privy Council, when the latter was proclaimed Lord Protector. He was beheaded at the Cross of Edinburgh on 27th May 1661, his head being exposed on a spike at the west end of the Tolbooth, and his body buried in the family burying-place at Kilmun. The Marquis met his death with the utmost fortitude and solemnity, behaving on the scaffold with signal courage, and his lofty character and true piety were displayed to the admiration of all who knew him. His eldest son, Archibald, succeeded to the family honours, with the exception of the Marquisate, and had been educated by his father in the true principles of loyalty to the Crown and the Protestant religion. In 1654 he received a commission as lieutenant-general from Charles H., and joined the Earl of Glencairn with the view of taking arms on behalf of the royal cause. In 1657 he was thrown into prison by order of General Monk, and kept in confinement until the restoration of Charles to the throne. During the troubles which befel his father, Lord Lome endeavoured to save his life, and incurred the displeasure of the Earl of Middleton, Lord High Commissioner, and the sworn foe of the Marquis of Argyll, and afterwards again underwent a long term of imprisonment in the Castle of Edinburgh. Charles becoming sensible of the services which Lord Lome had rendered him, at last, in 1663, restored him the estates of his father, and the title of Earl of Argyll. PAST AND PRESENT. 13 In 1681, when the Duke of York, afterwards James II., went to Scotland, a parliament was summoned at Edinburgh, which estab- lished certain oaths and tests to be subscribed by those who possessed offices, civil, military and ecclesiastical, and this test was taken by Argyll. Soon after this he was committed to prison on a charge of high treason, but contrived to make his escape, and fled to Holland, where he resided during the remainder of Charles' reign, On the King's death in 1685, he came over to Scotland with the view of trying to preserve the civil and religious liberties of his country, in concert with the King's nephew, the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth, But the expedition was abortive, and after in vain trying to effect a rising in the West of Scotland, Argyll fled in disguise, and being taken prisoner was carried to Edinburgh, where, fn June 1685, he was beheaded. On the scaffold he displayed the same calmness as did his father, and before his death he made a short, serious, religious speech. Thus perished on the scaffold both the father and son, heads of the illustrious house of Argyll, victims of the baseness and ingratitude of two worthless monarchs, who displayed the same cynical indifference to the laws alike of God and man. The next holder of the title was Archibald, son of the preceding nobleman, who, for certain services performed, but probably more on account of what his father and grandfather had done for the cause of civil and religious liberty, was created in 1701 Duke of Argyll and Marquis of Lome. His son was the celebrated John Duke of Argyll and Greenwich, a distinguished soldier, who served under Marl- 14 ROSNEATH borough and contributed to the victories of RamillieB and Malplaquet. In January 1711, he was sent to Spain as ambassador, at the same time being appointed Commander-in-Chief of the English forces in that kingdom. His conduct as regards the Union between Scotland and England was peculiar, for in 1713, though only four years pre- viously he had forwarded that great measure, he supported a motion in the House of Lords for its repeal. For a number of years the Duke held a high position as a patriotic nobleman and a soldier of renown, and the lines of Pope indicate his character — \" Argyll, the State's whole thunder born to wield. And shake alike the Senate and the field.\" On his death, without male issue, in 1743, a fine monument was erected to his honour in Westminster Abbey, and he was succeeded in his Scotch title by his brother Archibald, third Duke of Argyll. This Duke also entered the army, and served under Marlborough, being present at the battle of Sheriffmuir, where his elder brother, who was commander of the King's forces, defeated the followers of the Earl of Mar at the Jacobite rising in 1715. He held various im- portant civil appointments — a Lord of Session and Privy Councillor for Scotland, Keeper of the Privy Seal, and Chancellor of the Univer- sity of Aberdeen. He rebuilt the family seat at Inveraray, and was the confidential friend of Sir Eobert Walpole. He had chief manage- ment of Scottish national affairs, besides being most attentive in furthering the trade and manufactures of his country. PAST AND PRESENT. 15 John, fourth Duke, was the son of the Honourable John Campbell of Mamore, on the Gareloch, and also was an officer in the British army. He was active on the royal side in the rebellion of 1715, and served in the war in Germany in 1744, besides being commander of the forces in the West of Scotland when the rebellion of 1745 broke out. John, fifth Duke, was eldest son of the preceding, and became general in the army in 1778, and field marshal in 1796, and was first President of the Highland Society of Scotland. He married the widow of the Duke of Hamilton, who was one of the three beautiful Miss Gunnings, and their son, George William, became sixth Duke in 1806. Duke George was an amiable, much respected gentle- man, and a good landlord, and dying in 1839 was succeeded by his brother, Lord John Campbell, who long resided at Ardencaple Castle, Eow. He was thrice married, his second wife, Joan, heiress of John Glassel of Long Niddry, being the mother of the present Duke, George John Douglas Campbell, born in 1823. The Duke married in 1844 Lady Elizabeth, eldest daughter of the Duke of Sutherland, and their son, the Marquis of Lome, born in 1845, is the heir to the ancient title of Mac Chaillan Mor and head of the house of Argyll. Some of the heads of the house of Argyll made Rosneath Castle their residence during part of the year, and with one, the famous Marquis, it was a favourite place of abode. Of him a contemporary historian wrote : \" He was a man of singular piety, prudence, authority and eloquence ; and though he had been much envied and 16 ROSNBATH. caluminated, yet his death did abundantly vindicate him.\" His widow continued to reside in the Castle, which he had rebuilt, and long was spared to be a blessing to the locality. Of this good lady it was written : \" His noble lady. Lady Margaret Douglas, a lady of singular piety and virtue, bore the sad shock with other both personal and domestic afllictions, with great patience and incredible fortitude, giving herself always to prayer and fasting, and ministering to the necessity of the saints.\" Of John Duke of Argyll and Greenwich, Sir Walter Scott, in his novel, \"The Heart of Midlothian,\" wrote with great admiration, \"Soaring above the petty distinctions of faction, his voice was raised, whether in office or opposition, for those measures which were at once just and lenient. His high military talents enabled him during the memorable year 1715, to render such services to the House of Hanover, as perhaps, were too great either to be acknowledged or repaid. He had almost by his simple and unassisted talents, stopped the irruption of the banded forces of all the Highland chiefs, and there was little doubt that, with the slightest encouragement^ he could put them all in motion and renew the civil war ; and it was well known that the most flattering overtiu-es had been transmitted to the Duke from the Court of St. Germains.\" The present holder of this title is too well known to his fellow- countrymen to need much euolgy in a work of this kind. He is the thirty-second Knight of Loohow, and the thirtieth Campbell, in the direct line of descent. From his exalted position as head of PAST AND PRESENT. 17 the great clan Campbell, from his extensive territorial possessions and above all, from his commanding talents, he is well worthy of taking the highest place in the councils of the nation. From his earliest years he has diligently applied himself to acquire knowledge, and to study the varied and intricate political, social, and scientific problems of the day. Had he not been born heir to one of the most illustrious positions in the British peerage, he would certainly have achieved the highest eminence in whatever department of the public service he entered. As a public man, for over forty years, he has held a great position ; he has been intimately connected with the political and legislative movements of his time, and his name is associated with much that is best in our national history for this lengthened term. From his boyhood he showed a remarkable aptitude for busi- ness, and displayed those literary graces which have shone con- spicuously in later efforts. While Marquis of Lome, he took an active part in the great controversy relating to patronage in the Presby- terian Church of Scotland, which culminated in the Disruption of 1843. One of his early productions was \" On the Duty and Neces- sity of Immediate Legislative Interposition on Behalf of the Church of Scotland,\" in which he gave an able reswmS of Scotch ecclesiastical history. In another pamphlet entitled \" A Letter to Eev. Thomas Chalmers, D.D., on the Present Position of Church Affairs in Scot- land,\" he vindicated the right of the Church to legislate for herself. In an essay entitled \" Presbytery Examined,\" published in 1848, the Duke entered upon a critical and historical review of Scottish Church 18 ROSNEATH. History since the Eeformation, which was most favourably criticised at the time. Since then, his writings upon questions of Church Government, Patronage, and against Disestablishment, have been numerous and important, the part he took, in particular, regarding the abolition of lay patronage being in the highest degree honourable to himself. Amongst the various works of a political, historical, and scientific character which have proceeded from his prolific pen, his \"Eeign of Law \" may perhaps be considered his most original and ambitious effort. In \" Scotland as it Was, and as it Is,\" the Duke treats in an able and exhaustive way the gradual rise of the feudal system of land tenure, and many cognate customs illustrating the modes of dealing with agricultural holdings in Scotland, a valuable contribution to the literature of the great land question. He is a frequent contributor to the magazines of the day, and his articles generally receive the place of honour, while his graphic and pithy letters to the Times upon important topics, such as the Land and Labour questions. Home Rule, Education, Disestablishment, and similar topics, command universal attention. The Duke of Argyll's political career has been long and distin- guished. He first accepted office as Lord Privy Seal, under the ad- ministration of the Earl of Aberdeen, in December 1852. After Lord Palmerston assumed the office of Prime Minister, he was continued in the same office until, in 1855, he exchanged it for the office of Post- master-General. In 1859 he again became Lord Privy Seal till 1866 ; in 1868 was Secretary of State for India till 1874, under Mr. Glad- PAST AND PRESENT. 19 stone's administration. Again, in 1880, he was appointed to his old office of Lord Privy Seal, which he retained till 1881, when he resigned office, and since then has held no post in the Gladstone administration. As is well known, his Grace is a strong opponent of Mr. Gladstone's Irisy policy, and he has rendered vast services to the Liberal Unionist cause, not only in Parliament, but by his numerous addresses, letters to the press, and articles in magazines. In addition to his various hereditary titles, such as Duke and Earl of Argyll, Marquis of Lome, Earl of Campbell, and Viscount of Lochow and others, the Duke is Klnight of the Thistle and of the Garter, Lord Lieutenant of Argyllshire. In 1854 was Lord Eector of Glasgow University. In 1835 he presided over the twenty-fifth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, held in Glasgow, and on this occasion displayed scientific knowledge and antiquarian research of high capacity, and his remarks upon all the subjects under discussion were listened to with much respect by the eminent savants who were present. His Grace is intimately acquainted with all the details of the management of his extensive estates in Argyllshire and Dunbartonshire, and finds time amidst his multifarious duties and varied correspondence, to reply with his own hand to nearly every letter addressed to him by the humblest tenant on his property. It may safely be affirmed that if there were more noblemen like the Duke of Argyll, who reside upon their properties the greater part of the year, and diligently discharge the responsibili- ties which Providence has laid upon them, there would be little of 20 ROSNBATH PAST AND PRESENT. the outcry about abolishing the House of Lords, and sweeping away the landed aristocracy, which is put forth by certain demagogues of the day. CHAPTER II. Topography of the Peninsula of Bosneath. This diversified Peninsula has long been a favourite place of resort for those who are in search of romantic and salubrious summer quar- ters. Situated within such easy access from Glasgow, it presents •numerous attractions for men of business who seek an entire change of scene after the labours of the day. There is a wondrous charm in the sinuous shores and winding bays of the Frith of Clyde, over- looked as they are by many a heathery mountain slope, across whose breezy heights flit the everchanging shadows on our all too brief sum- mer days. Towards the middle of last century, the scenery of the valley and Frith of Clyde presented an aspect very dififerent from their now luxuriant clothing of well tilled lands and ample planta- tions of trees. All along the West of Scotland, and the territory bordering on the seaboard, many of the counties presented dreary prospects of moors and poor grass lands, trees were few and far be- tween, and hedgerows were unknown. Even in Ayrshire, the lands were bare and uncivilised, unless in the vicinity of Eglinton Castle, and one or two other noblemen's seats. Anyone sailing down the 22 ^ EOSNEATH. Frith of Clyde saw the heather and bracken-clad slopes of the hills, interspersed with glens in which the natural birch and alder trees grew in profusion, but none of the great plantations of larch, spruce, and silver firs, which now are such a feature in the landscape. No doubt in some parts of Scotland, the great indigenous forest trees, the noble old Scotch firs, a few specimens of which, remnants of the old Caledonian forest, are still encountered here and there, the mighty- oaks, and venerable yews threw their sombre shade over the turf. But a century ago, even a county, now so rich in forests and well timbered parks as Fife, showed hardly any scanty straggling belts of trees, unless perhaps near Falkland and Mount Melville. Ayrshire then presented to an observer the appearance of an open common, without tree or, fence. After the Kebellion of 1745, great changes began to be intro- duced. Up till then farming was in its elementary state, and was mostly in the hands of small communities of crofters. Scarcely any grass or turnip was sown, and even the potato was little seen, the flocks of scraggy sheep were led out to graze and housed at night. Oxen did most of the ploughing, and the farm produce was carried on creels on horseback. During a great part of the year, except during harvest, the stock roamed about anywhere, and devoured all green vegetation. But, towards the close of the century, forestry got a start, and farmers saw the value of plantations of trees giving shelter to stock. Then it was that the great planting of firs began, which gradually changed the face of the landscape. Some of the grand forests of dark firs which now adorn the slopes of the moun- TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA. 23 tains in the Highlands, and cover the lesser heights in the Lowland counties, took their rise from this period. In Dunbartonshire, on the Colquhoun, Montrose, and Argyll estates, many splendid plantations of dark firs were started, and the Eosneath Peninsula assumed a clothed aspect which gave beauty to its fine outlines. The Peninsula of Rosneath was indeed, from its delightful situation and vicinity to great centres of population, certain to become a place of resort. Its name has been very fruitful of controversy, being claimed by partisans of English and Gaelic derivations. Un- doubtedly the true orthography of the name is BossnMh, a Gaelic term, not the modernised and more euphonious Boseneath. No doubt the latter mode of spelling is the accepted version by compilers of guide books and railway time tables, but it is scornfully repudiated by natives of the \" island,\" as an unworthy concession to ignorant outsiders. One Gaelic derivation of the word is Bhosnoeth, the \" bare or unwooded promontory,\" another, Bos-na-choich, the \" virgin's pro- montory,\" these being the two generally accepted terms which have gradually been corrupted into Eosneath. The latter is most generally accepted, but still another reading gives it as Bossneveth, the \" promon- tory of the sanctuary.\" Now, from time immemorial, there has been a place of worship and of burial in the Peninsula, in the immediate vicinity of the present Church at the Clachan village. A Peninsula, or island, was a favourite spot in ancient times for burying the dead, as securing a place of worship aWay from the haunts of plundering marauders. Thus the \" promontory of the sanctuary \" would be an 24 ROSNEATH. appropriate name for the now populous and frequented parish of Rosneath. Sir \"Walter Scott, in the \"Heart of Midlothian,\" thus mentions the Peninsula. He is describing the islands of the Frith of Clyde, Arran, Bute and the Cumbraes, and says, \"Eoseneath, a smaller isle, lies much further up the Frith, and towards its western shore, near the opening of the lake called the Gare-loch, and not far from Loch Long, and Loch Seant, or the Holy Loch, which wind from the mountains of the Western Highlands to join the estuary of the Clyde. The picturesque beauty of the island of Eoseneath in particular, had such recommendations, that the Earls and Dukes of Argyll, from an early period, made it their occasional residence, and had their temporary accommodation in a fishing or hunting lodge, which succeeding improvements have since transformed into a palace.\" Situated between the peaceful waters of the Gareloch, and the more troubled broad estuary of the Clyde, the Peninsula stretches for about eight and a half miles from the \" green isle \" point, opposite Greenock, to Portincaple on Loch Long side. Within these limits is embraced a wonderful variety of scenery, in some places all the silence and seclusion of a Highland moor, with its robe of purple heather, feathery bracken, and yielding cushions of velvet moss, in others the sylvan greenery and rich pasture of an agricultural coun- try. The parish consists mainly of one continuous ridge, rising from the wooded point opposite Greenock in gradually increasing lines of elevation to the hill of Tomnahara, the highest point, some eight hun- dred feet above the sea. With the exception of the level grounds in TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA. 25 the vicinity of the Castle and policies, and the fields of the Clachan farm, the cultivated portions of the Peninsula are the slopes on either side rising from the Lochs. The whole of the upper tableland of the ridge is covered with heather or marsh, with many a clear moun- tain streamlet pursuing its rocky course to the Loch. When a suc- cession of rainy days has filled the burns, they leap down the numerous cascades which break their course, and many a sweet subject for an artist's brush may be encountered by those in search of the pictur- esque. There is one small fresh water loch in the moor near Tomna- hara, its waters are pure, and there is excellent fishing to be had. From Tomnahara there is a grand view, embracing the whole serrated range of the Loch Long mountains, with the dark currents between their slopes and the Peninsula, and the gleaming Loch Goil — \" That dark and stormy water \" — opening to the left, while on the right the Gareloch, with its green fields, embowered villas, and mantling woods, is seen on the other side. Kising above Garelochhead are the swelling outlines of the grassy mountains at the head of Glenfruin, from whence the eye ranges on to Helens- burgh and the distant braes above Kilpatrick. Opposite are the uplands of Renfrewshire, the busy ports of PortGlasgow, Greenock and Gourock, the Cloch Lighthouse, and the long reaches of the Ayr- shire coast, and following on you gain fine views of the Cumbraes, Bute, Arran, and the nearer mountains of Argyllshire. On a very clear day it is just possible to descry the far-off noble crest of Ben 26 ROSNEATH. Cruachan, and it is surprising what a varied expanse of mountain, moor, craggy fell, and glittering sea, can be gained from this moderate elevation. Although in summer the view is grand and, lit up with all the sparkle and radiance of that beauteous season, the shadows flitting rapidly across the hill sides, only bringing out into more vivid relief the partially veiled glories of moor, and fell, and gleaming water, still in winter the prospect is one of deep interest and variety. When all around is concealed by one resplendent robe of snow, even the rugged Ben Im, with its majestic double peak, completely mantled with its enveloping shroud, and the soft, wreath-like folds of downy wool resting on the undulating ridges of the Peninsula, then the pic- ture is full of solemn beauty. Each fir plantation and fringe of pine wood is sprinkled with snow that rests lightly on the dark boughs, and, only here and there, on the swelling moor is seen a black pro- truding speck of rock amid the waste of dazzling white. Then, to- wards sunset, each lofty peak raising its giant form into the cold, blue air, is pervaded by an exquisite rosy tint, deepening into delicate carmine, and finally the ghostly hue of approaching night, as it settles down upon the landscape, envelopes the whole with the murky pall of midnight gloom. The reservoir which supplies the water for Kilcreggan and Cove covers a good large area of ground near Tomna- hara, and gives an ample supply for the wants of the many summer visitors who inhabit the villas which stretch along the shore for miles from Kilcreggan pier to Ooulport on Loch Long. TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA. 27 The formation of the shores of the Peninsula adds much to its beauty. Along from the Ferry Inn towards the Eosneath Castle point, the receding line of strand has a semi-circular appearance, the beach of a fine pebbly gravel, takes a graceful curve and then forms the sheltered Campsail Bay, on whose waters may frequently be seen anchored some of the handsome yachts of the different Clyde clubs. This part of the parish is clothed with singularly fine specimens of trees of many varieties, the soil being favourable for their growth, in addition to the indigenous oaks, ash, and birch. Many of the finer garden species, such as the fuchsia, arbutus, myrtle and peach trees, are found scattered along the shores of the Gareloch, and even two good specimens of that valuable genus, the eucalyptus of Australia, are to be seen within the grounds of the Established and Free Church manses. But the trees which seem to attain the finest proportions are those of the fir, beech, and ash tribe, though the severe storms of past years played havoc with many of them, especially the plantation which crowned the brow of the hill above the Clachan Farm. The GaJlowhill, between the Castle and Kilcreggan, was covered by a luxuriant growth of firs, but this was cut down nearly forty years ago, and only partially replanted, although there are many fine beeches and firs on the lower slopes of the hill. Eosneath is a highly salubrious place, as is indicated by the great age to which many of the natives attain. The air is pure, although very moist at times, and the climate is mild, as is evinced by the pro- fusion of ferns and mossy plants, while the rainfall encourages the 28 ROSNEATH. perennial verdure ever so refreshing to the eye. Being in the vicinity of high mountains, and, from its position, prone to intercept the dense masses of vapour which often roll up the Frith of Clyde, the Peninsula gets an abundant share of moisture. In winter often the mildness of the season is striking, and the rhododendron, laurustinus, jessamine, and other flowering shrubs may be observed in bloom in December. In spring, no doubt, the Gareloch side of the Peninsula often has a continuance of east wind, though, in the Cove and Pea- toun districts, the inhabitants are quite sheltered from this unwelcome visitant. Although the upper ridges are in parts marshy, yet no un- healthy exhalations give trouble, and the shores being rocky and gravelly, no unpleasant airs are wafted from long stretches of mud, as you have in other parts of the Clyde. The prevailing winds are the south and south-west, which sometimes blow for days together, the latter often bringing down showers of misty rain, and these are naturally felt in their severity on the Kilcreggan and Cove shores, while, on the Gareloch side, is comparative quiet. Snow does notj as a rule, lie long on the land, which is often entirely free from its presence, while the mainland and mountains beyond are shrouded with a white mantle. The geological structure of the Peninsula does not require much notice, nearly the whole strata belonging to the primitive class of rocks. The prevailing formation is clay slate, which at times passes into chlorite slate, and occssionally into mica slate. Occasionally beds of conglomerate may be met, as at the old sea cliff near Bosneath TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA, 29 Castle, and one or two other places. On the high ground above Clynder may be observed good examples of chloride slate in the quarries which have been opened up, the direction being from north- west to south-east. On the shore of Loch Long, not very far from Knockderry, there appears a large mass of greenstone lying interposed between the strata. The greenstone is like a dyke from twenty t« thirty feet thick, and close to it is more of the chlorite slate rock. Another bed of greenstone is found, nearly half a mile further south. The south-western extremity of the parish is per- vaded by conglomerate and coarse sandstone rock, which occurs in beds of considerable thickness. This rock is of similar description to the great sandstone formation which extends along the Eenfrew and Ayrshire coasts, and embraces the Cumbraes and a portion of the southern half of Bute. The line of formation between the sandstone and primitive rock of the parish runs along the valley, stretching from Campsail Bay to Kilpreggan. In the slate formation on the Loch Long shore, as well as in the quartz, iron pyrites is found in considerable abundance. It is crystallised in the slate, and in the quartz appears in large irregular masses. In the colour of the slate there is much variety, due to the quantity of oxide of iron pervading the deposits. Some of the interesting boulders which are to be found through- out the \"Western Highlands still exist at Eosneath, though it is to be feared that many of them have been destroyed for building purposes. About forty-five years ago, more than one hundred fine boulders of 30 EOSNEATH. grey granite were found in position on the ridges above the Grareloch, between that and Loch Long, one-third of them exceeding thirty tons in weight. The prevailing rock formation being clay slate, it is possible that the granite boulders came from the north. Probably the boulders had their origin in the great granite mountains, such as Ben Cruachan, more than thirty miles distant, as the crow flies, being transported by the ice across valleys and hills, floating on a sea which may have been over fifteen hundred feet above the present sea level By the action of ice, large masses of stone have been placed in situ on the heights of mountains and in valleys, for there can be little doubt that, in remote ages, glaciers existed in the glens of the Western Highlands. The conclusion which Mr. Charles M'Laren, the eminent Scotch geologist, came to in 1846, regarding these boulders, was that they have come on the sea at a far greater level than now, brought by currents from the north-west. Also, Mr. M'Laren concluded, that local glaciers had at one time existed in all these valleys, as the stria- tions on the rocks were all parallel with the axis of the valley, which generally runs in the direction of N.W. and S.E., and the accumula- tions of gravel and clay reminded him of the lateral and terminal moraines of Switzerland. There is a remarkable boulder between the farms of Peatoun and Duchlage, on the Loch Long side of Eosneath. This large boulder rests in the channel of a burn, which runs down to the loch, at a height of 226 feet above the sea. It is of gneiss, resting on the gorge cut by the burn through the clay slate rocks, and has a local TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA. 31 name, meaning \"house on a knoll.\" Its dimensions are 24 x 18 x 12 feet, and probably it was transported across Loch Long from the N.W., and came to a stand against the hillside where it remains. It is interesting to note that there is an old sea margin at 45 feet above the present level, near this spot, and another at exactly the same height on the opposite side of the loch. Many of these boulders are encountered in the Eosneath district, and upon the mountains rising out of Loch Long are some fine specimens. On a hill near Loch Goil, about 450 feet above the sea, is a boulder called the \" giant's putting stone,\" from a tradition very common in the High- lands that giants of old used to exercise themselves by throwing these masses of rock across lochs and valleys. Another very remark- able boulder is on the hill above Carrick Castle on Loch Goil ; a stone of enormous dimensions, about 1526 feet above the sea. It is called the \" stone nicely balanced,\" and rests on the ledge of a precipitous cliff, over 500 feet high, and must have travelled a long distance. On the farm of Letter, near Peatoun, on Loch Long, there is a gneiss boulder, 12 feet by 8, about 10 feet above high water mark, on the roadside. Numerous other interesting specimens on the Loch Long mountains may be seen ; one of them, called Pulag boulder, is near the top of a hill to the west of Ardentinny, almost on the edge of a precipice, 200 feet high, and it could by no possibility have rolled to its present exalted position. The state of agriculture about a century ago in Dunbartonshire is well described in Forsyth's Beauties of Scotland, and much that is said 32 ROSNEATH. as to the county generally would apply to the conditions of cultiva- tion in Eosneath. Farms, in several instances, were small, consisting of not above twelve or fifteen acres. In order to have their lands ploughed the small farmers were under the necessity of joining with two or three neighbours. Little was laid out in improvements, and so the land gradually became exhausted. Sometimes there were pendicles of a few acres in extent occupied by labourers, and those who wrought at some trade. About this time, however, a consider- able rise in the rent of land occurred over what prevailed fifty years before. This was partly because land cultivation was improved, where there were poor black cattle in summer and goats in winter, sheep were placed on the farms. In consequence of the increase in wealth and population in Glasgow and other towns, there was much more demand for butcher meat, and its appreciation in money value. Better farm-houses or steadings were being constructed, and, instead of mere thatch coverings, were now being roofed with slate. Sometimes these steadings were covered with heath or bracken, which, properly managed, made a tolerably durable roof. This thatch, on the side of the house exposed to the sun, lasted about six or seven years ; but when in a northern exposure, might endure well on to thirty years. Oats was the crop most generally cultivated, bear and barley, owing to cold seasons, were found to be precarious crops. In some parts of the country what was called blandearded barley, a mixture, half bear, half barley, was cultivated, and the meal used as bread. TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA. 33 A curious mixture, also, of oats, barley, rye, pease, and beans, was likewise a favourite crop with many, and used for bread. Hardly any wheat was grown in the county, although from the grains of wheat found in a vault under ground at Castlecarry, it would appear to have been cultivated by the Eomans. Although turnips were not very much in request, the cultivation of the potato was universal ; sometimes where peas and beans were grown, the potato was placed in the same course. Flax was cultivated in many parts of the county where there were clay soUs, or flat soils capable of retaining moisture; from eight to ten pecks of Riga seed being sown upon one acre, and the crop, when dressed by the miU, would amount to twenty or even twenty-eight stones. It was found to be of much service in weeding the soil and cleaning the land. The inhabitants of the parishes of Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld obtained, from the trustees for the improvements in Scotland, large premiums annually for the growth of flax, and it used to be manufactured into yarn by the farmers' wives. Clover and rye grass were much cultivated, white clover being every- where indigenous to the county. • The common fern, or bracken, grew plentifully in the Peninsula, and was found useful in many ways. No cultivation was needed for ferns, and they grew in the glens and corries, and open fields. While chiefly used for thatch or litter, it was found that horses were not averse to eat them, when well prepared. In the more mountainous and precipitous parts of the county the soil was, to a large extent, marshy and wet, affording poor pasture for sheep. But in many 3 34 ROSNEATH. parts of Rosneath there were good natural grasses, and owing to the moist climate they kept verdant throughout the year. Sheep breed- ing, as a regular business, was introduced into the county by Mr. Campbell of Lagwyne, in 1747, who then resided in the parish of Luss, before which time Dunbartonshire generally was stocked with black cattle, which brought in a poor return. Considerable quantities of cattle were purchased from Highland graziers, and after being kept for the winter were sold to English graziers, as the Peninsula was, in many respects, suitable for winter- ing cattle ; the food of the animals being chiefly grass, either green or dried, and straw being given to both horses and cows. Clover was much preferred to every other green crop for the cows, as it greatly increased the quantity of the milk and left no bad taste. Horses during winter got their supper of boiled meat often, a mixture of light corn, oat-chaff, and sometimes beans and pease. This was reckoned an excellent food for the animals, enhancing their appear- ance and maintaining their strength. Cows also, after calving, were nourished with the same mixture, until the grass became plentiful. Very few swine were raised in the district, either for private use or for the market. Cows were universally kept, although the county was not one noted for dairy produce. A good deal of butter was salted for sale in wooden vessels, and what was termed \"hung cheese \" was extensively made, being so called as the curds were hung, or tied up, in a cloth or net, instead of the whey being ex- tracted as usual by the press. TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA. 35 At that period the enclosing of land throughout the county had made considerable progress. Up till about forty years previously, none of the land was enclosed, with the exception of a few fields adjoining the county residences of the landowners. The enclosures of arable land amounted, as a rule, to about eight or ten acres. One large enclosure of three hundred acres was surrounded by a stone dyke, in the parish of Eow, by Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, at a cost of over £300 sterling. That proprietor annually built several thousand roods of dykes, and planted at least thirty thousand young thorns. Hedges faced with stone were not uncommon, and some excellent specimens of this mode of fencing may be seen at present on the road between the Clachan Village and Kilcreggan. The dyke was a couple of feet or thereby in height, built of stone without lime, the thorns and beeches placed in the earth thrown up at the back of the dyke, near the upper course of stones. In the higher parts of the county wooden fences were common, consisting of posts of peeled oak, or branches of elm, or fir trees set upright in the earth, at the distance of a foot and a half from each other, and strongly interwoven with brushwood or brooms. These fences were called \"stab and rice.\" Lime was used extensively as manure, and allowed to remain some time spread upon the surface before being ploughed down. Sea ware was also profitably used as manure, consisting of two kinds, what was taken off the stones on the shore, and what was driven up by the tides, called \" blown wreck.\" The former was esteemed the richest, as containing a greater proportion of salt. What was cut 36 ROSNEATH. from the stones grew so rapidly that another crop might be cut in two years ; some kinds of sea plants were better than others, the thin, broad-leaved species being little esteemed. The blown wreck needed to be gathered as soon as possible, and was used as top dress- ing to grass fields, and was sometimes mingled with lime, earth, and ordinary farm manure. Lime and peat moss were in some places spread upon grass lands, for ploughing in the following year ; the lime, in powder, being laid on the surface of the ground in autumn, and cartloads of moss overspreading the whole. At that time the growing woods of Dunbartonshire were noticeable for their extent, the woodlands being computed at about 11,800 acres, of which 6,200 were under natural wood. The natural woods, of which the oak formed a considerable part, were for the sake of the bark, cut every twenty years, only the oak, mountain ash and willow being peeled. The tanners preferred the Highland bark at about twenty years old to others of greater age, and as the price of the timber commonly defrayed the expense of cutting and barking, the profits chiefly arose from the sale of the bark. The mode of cutting wood had much altered in the last few years, it being formerly the universal practice to cut the tree over a few inches above the sur- face of the ground, the piece left being intended to throw off young shoots of future growth, which, in their turn, were cut ofif a few inches above the old stock. But it was found that the shoots from the root of the tree were better than those from the \"stool,\" or portion above the ground, The new plants sprang from the root, on a level with PAST AND PRESENT. 37 the surface of the ground, and acquired new and vigorous roots for themselves. The value of the natural wood was, in many places, considerable, where the oak prevailed it was estimated above £1 per acre, a much higher rent than could be obtained for the same land in any other manner. The county gentlemen seeing how precarious, too often, the grain crops were in a wet ungenial climate, enclosed large portions of their estates for plantation. On the Luss, and Eosneath, and Arden estates, in particular, much planting was en- couraged, a single enclosure at Eossdhu containing five hundred acres. It was then seen how foolish had been the improvident and wasteful process by which the ancient forests of the country had been im- poverished and destroyed. The y&w, holly, rowan, and Dutch myrtle, growing extensively in marshy ground, were amongst the natural woods of the country ; in the island of Inch Conachan, on Loch Lomond, there being computed to be several thousand yews, which most probably were planted for the purpose of making bows for the men-at-arms of that period. The famous yew tree avenue of Eosneath will, later on, be described, and there are also some very fine specimens of this species in the policies near Eossdhu. Amongst the notable trees was the decayed ash tree at Bonhill, within the hollowed out trunk of which the proprietor had formed an apart- ment, nearly nine feet in diameter and ten feet in height. It was lighted by two windows, had a table in the middle, surrounded by seats which could accommodate a considerable number of people. Limestone was found in different varieties over most of the 38 ROSNEATH. county, the first sort containing shells, collaroids and other exuviae of the inhabitants of the ancient ocean, and produced lime of excel- lent quality. The second kind of lime was called \"moor lime- stone,\" being commonly situated on the higher grounds, and in strata of various thickness. The surface of the stone was coarse and gritty, owing to the calcareous crystals of which it seemed to be mostly a congeries, and it was destitute of marine produc- tions. Generally it was found in places remote from coal, and some- times successful attempts were made to burn it with peat. The third kind of limestone was what was termed \" canistone,\" or \" glen- stone,\" being met with in the glens of the different parishes. It was of a finer grain, and of a reddish grey colour, but also without any shell or marine remains. It contained a considerable portion of clay, and when exposed to the atmosphere falls down in small pieces. In the parish of Dunbarton natural sections may be seen in the sides of some glens, where over a dozen of thin strata of the limestone are imbedded in the soil. Much of this stone was .burnt for manure, and it possessed this peculiar quality, that, when thoroughly burned and while it was red hot, it needed to be slaked in the kiln, for if per- mitted to cool gradually, it would not afterwards precipitate in powder. For this reason, and that it might be more thoroughly slaked, the kiln was commonly built in the vicinity of a burn. At the Strouel Bay, and other places on the Gareloch side, these kilns were situated ; some of them within the recollection of living persons. It is curious that Forsyth mentions the strange notion that the TOPOGRAPHY OP THE PENINSULA, 39 soil of the Eosneath Peninsula was of deadly quality for rats, and that, if imported, they died within the year. There are other singular details given in this interesting sketch by Forsyth of the county of Dunbarton, its history, and varied products. It was then reckoned to be in the Highlands and, in many parts of the county, especially in the northern portions, the Gaelic language was spoken. The area of the parish, according to the Blue Book published over twenty years ago, giving particulars of the whole heritable and landed properties in Scotland, amounts to 8,106 acres, the greater portion of which have been brought under cultivation of some sort, though the upper part of the Peninsula is still moorland, and affords excellent grouse shooting. Formerly the arable land was divided into farms of no great size, with the exception of the Home Farm, but several of these have been united into larger holdings. The Home Farm is much the largest in area, and was brought into its present superior condition mainly through the late Mr. Lome Campbell, the Duke of Argyll's Chamberlain, who was a gentleman of great influence, widely esteemed, and looked up to by every one in the parisL He had succeeded, as factor, Mr. Eobert Campbell, who long occupied the Clachan Farm, and the old mansion house at the end of the sombre yew-tree avenue. The latter being an original member of the High- land Society, and encouraged by the then Duke of Argyll, succeeded in inducing the farmers to adopt many improvements in the manage- ment of their farms. As showing the great improvements which have taken place in the cultivation of the land, a walk over the 40 ROSNEATH. Home or Clachan Farms when the harvest time approaches, will display a sample of crops which it would be difficult to surpass in this part of the county. Most of the soil is peculiarly well adapted for potatoes, and, especially in early varieties, the return is most favourable. In the statistical account of the parish, drawn up by the Kev. Eobert Story, in May 1839, there is a short paragraph upon the agricultural aspect of the district. From this account it appeared that there were over 8,000 acres of uncultivated moorland, although of these it was believed 500 were capable of profitable culture, 520 were under valuable wood plantations of various ages, and 720 of old and natural copse wood. It is further pointed out that the general improvements of husbandry adopted were, chiefly, fencing and draining the fields after the modern system, though there was still much to be desired. Nearly all the fields were enclosed by hedges or stone dykes, and, on several of the farms, much reclaimed land was to be observed. The inferior style of the farm buildings is commented upon, as indicating insufficiency of capital expenditure. There was a steady and regular market for produce of the farm, with easy access, and winter carriage for a constant supply of manures. The ordinary duration of the leases was stated to be nineteen years, on terms favourable to the occupier, and the enclosures were complete, in excellent repair, and more suitable to the purpose of the cultivator than those of any other parish in the district. At that period the old fashioned system of rotation of crops would, no doubt, be maintained, and the primitive modes of reaping the harvest and conducting TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PENINSULA. 41 agricultural operations, then in almost universal use, would curtail the farmer's energies, and sometimes bring about considerable loss. At that time the average value of land under the plough might be considered about £1 5s. per acre ; the charge for grazing a covr £2 10s., and for a sheep 6s., the total rental of the Peninsula being estimated to be somewhat under £3,500. The agricultural labourer received but 1/10, and artisans 2s. 6d. per day, farm servants being hired at £7 and £8 for the half year, with bed, board, and washing. The average yearly value of all sorts of produce, was then about £5,820, which was arrived at as follows — Value of all kinds of grain, - . . . £2,000 Potatoes and turnips, ----- 1,500 Hay cultivated, ------ 400 Flax, 20 Land in pasture, .--.-- 1,200 Annual thinings from plantation grounds, - - 600 Salmon fishing, ------ 100 Together, - £5,820 Sales of produce were effected without difficulty in Glasgow and Greenock. Seed oats were exported to Ireland, and potatoes to the colonies, and there was good home consumption. The common breed of cattle was Ayrshire, and a large portion of the grazing paris were given up to rearing black and West Highland cattle. Facilities for export were found only in one or two parts of the district, but, upon the whole, there was sufficient for the comparatively limited quantity of agricultural produce. 42 ROSNEATH.

There is a great increase in the arable lands' 44 ROSNEATH. rental, and the feu-duties drawn from the numerous feus at Kilcreggan and Loch Long, and vast improvement has taken place in the general agricultural position of the Peninsula. In the Blue Book the agricultural rental value of the Rosneath estate was stated at £5,170. The rental of Eosneath estate, Whitsunday 1891, exclu- sive of the castle and shootings, amounted to close upon £8,000, of which sum nearly one-third was derived from the feus along the Kilcreggan and Cove shores. Some years ago the rental was at a higher figure, but abatements had to be made on account of the prevailing depression in agriculture. There is considerable room for increase in feu-duties, if the many admirable sites all the way along above Kilcreggan and Cove are taken into account. The total rental of the Eosneath Peninsula is as follows : — Cove and Kilcreggan — Burgh, - -• - £11,135 Rosneath — Landward, .... 10,420 Together, - £21,555 CHAPTEE III. Bosneath — A Betrospect. The winding shores of the Peninsula are now adorned by numerous handsome villas and marine residences, where once the mossy turf and springy heather clothed the declivities almost to the shingly strand of the Loch. Fifty years ago, along the sea beach there was an almost unbroken verge of grass or undergrowth, the natural woods spreading close down to the shore about Eahane, Mambeg and Gareloch-head. At Clynder there were one or two villas and thatched houses, and a green, grassy shore, where now there is a continuous row of modern mansions, trim gardens, landing piers, a bowling green, and other indications of teeming summer population. A great charm of the spot was its primitive and secluded air, while the same could be said of the Kilcreggan and Cove sides of the Peninsula. At that time there were no piers for disembarking passengers, and when the steamers came to the head of the Gareloch, those on board had to be landed at their destinations by means of the various ferry boats at Eow, Eosneath, Shandon and Gareloch-head. Previous to this period, communication between Eosneath and 46 ROSNEATH. Dunbarton, Glasgow and Greenock, was, at times, difficult and inter- rupted. Coaches ran on certain days of the week to Dunbarton, Greenock, and other places down the coast ; goods being taken by carrier's vans. Connection was kept up with Greenock from the Ferry at Eosneath by a large open wherry, as it was called, which could take a good quantity of farm produce, and a similar one was kept at Kilcreggan, by Mr. M'Farlane the ferryman. These boats carried sheep, cattle, horses, and other domestic animals to Greenock, with perhaps a good many passengers in addition, and generally used sailing power in preference to oars, and, in times of thick fog, were steered by the compass. For the conveyance of the Duke of Argyll and his friends, on the occasion of their visits to the district, his Grace's six-oared, highly emblazoned barge plied between Cairndhu point and the Castle, then occupied by Lord John Campbell. The barge was signalled from Cairndhu point by means of three fires, or smokes, if the Duke and Duchess were to be transported across the channel ; two smokes for relatives and friends ; and one smoke for those in a humbler position in life ; flashes of flame regulating the traffic after dark. With the advent of steamers, and the gradual opening up of the Gareloch by feuing and building, piers began to be erected at difiFerent places. Eosneath and Gareloch-head were the first to be built about 1845, then Eow, Kilcreggan, Cove, Clynder, Barremman and Shandon, and one or two others in less frequented sites, such as Balernock on the Shandon side, and Coulport on Loch Long. As far back as 1830, A RETROSPECT. 4? long before the time of the Helensburgh railway, steamers used to ply all the way from the Broomielaw to the Gareloch ; such as the old Caledonian, which, sixty years ago, used to sail on Saturdays to Gareloch-head, and return to Glasgow on the Monday, the only steamer at that time on the Gareloch. Later on, other steamers anchored off the Ferry Inn, or were attached to buoys in the water, and took in passengers and cargoes from the various farms. The average time occupied was about three and a half-hours, but sometimes, owing to fogs and other adverse circumstances, much longer time was allowed. The old Waverley, the British Queen, Oscar, Sovereign, Monarch, and others were well known to the Glasgow merchants in their summer peregrinations. The Duchess of Ar gyle left Glasgow at 3 p.m. with its complement of passengers, many of them \"kent faces,\" such as the late eminent Robert Napier of Shandon, formerly a resident on the Gareloch, and others long since gone to their rest. Then some new steamers, known as the \"green boats,\" from their distinguishing colour, were put on, to do the passage in less time. The Victoria took over three hours to get to the head of the Loch from Glasgow. Fre- quently the passengers were landed in the steamer's boats, as the ferry boat might be absent, and, in some cases, a landing was sought where no landing appliances were available. Of the steamers of that period, hardly one is now plying on its route except the old Inveraray Castle. Dunbarton, and the other ports on the Clyde, were well served with steamers, such as the Bmbarton Castle, which in 1847, with the Loch Lomond and Premier, made the run every day between Dun- 48 ROSNEATH. barton, Glasgow and Greenock. Omnibuses also, in connection with steamers, plied between Dunbarton, Vale of Leven, and Ballocli, and the goods steamer Bumbuck made the voyage daily between Dun- barton and Glasgow. Up till the end of 1890, the old bluff Bal- moral, known in 1845 as the Ladi/ Brisbane, regularly made the pas- sage between Greenock and Gareloch-head, and many regretted the untoward accident which obliged the familiar old specimen of naval architecture to be transformed into a coal hulk. These picturesque vessels were certainly in striking contrast to the graceful steamers, with their yacht-like lines, their spacious saloons, and spick and span appearance, such as the Gareloch, Lady Clare, Diana Vernon, Galatea, and others, now placed on the route by the two great railway com- panies of Scotland. The officers too of the present day are of a dif- ferent type from the bluff, mottle-faced, weather-beaten salts of yore, whose rough exterior by no means indicated the genuine warmth of heart, and humour, which often characterised those veteran navi- gators. In the days of the old ferry boats, and before the era of piers, dis- embarking was sometimes a work of much difficulty; especially when the north or east wind blew across the Loch, churning its usually peaceful waters into foaming waves. The ferrymen were daring men, ready on an emergency, capital fishermen, although occasionally they displayed, what is but too common in their class, fondness for a dram. It must be confessed that, not unfrequently, they manifested a leniency towards evasion of the excise laws, and were pretty fami- A RETROSPECT. 49 liar with the persons and ways of smugglers. Few more favourable specimens of the ferryman class could be found than the Macfarlanes of Kilcreggan, the Marquises of Coulport, opposite Ardentinny, who, tni 1890, had for a hundred years been tenants of the ferry, and the Macfarlanes of Eahane. The latter ferry is still wrought by John Macfarlane, the third in succession who has handled the oars, and although past the term allotted by the Psalmist, is daily at his post, alert and cheery as of yore. Long may this class of men flourish under the different regime and surroundings which environ us, now that education and social influences are more generally diffused, and we are brought more into contact with those a little below us in the social scale. Hardy, industrious, obliging, ready of wit and kindly in speech, and vigorous in body, may they not lose their individuality and get merged in the undistinguished body of labourers. Even the old fashioned ferry-boat, with its bluff sides and broad seats, is often much more in keeping with the surrounding romantic scenery than the trim built, iron structure, whose slim, spidery -looking formation, with ornamental iron rails, has superseded the venerable, picturesque, and heavy old wooden pier. On landing from the old Duchess of Argyle, fifty years ago, at Rosneath Ferry, the stranger would find himself on a point of land opposite Row, where the tide forms a rapid race at certain periods of its rise and fall. Sometimes, when there is a strong east wind meet- ing the full force of the ebb tide, the waterway is very rough, and full of breakers ; this narrow strip of water constantly changes its aspect, 4 50 ROSNEATH. and, according to the atmospheric phases and iridescence of the sky, the colouring of the waves is strangely varied. A beautiful ex- panse of water stretches away from the point beyond the Ferry Inn. Undoubtedly the shores of the loch, at one time, were much more extensive, and there was an ample carpet of turf. Some seventy years ago, there stood a lime kiln in the middle of the grassy verge of the loch at this place, but the gradual encroachment of the tide has long since carried every vestige away. The view up the loch on a calm day, with the shadows of the mountain slopes reflected in the transparent water, and the fine, rugged, outline of the \"Argyle Bowl- ing Green \" bounding the prospect, is one of the most beautiful which can be imagined. Sometimes, on a very still night, though the loch may be in perfect repose, the rushing sound of the tide within the narrows is audible for a great distance, and has a curious effect at the silent hour, when all nature around is hushed in midnight slumber. As you disembarked on the shore half a century ago, the only house visible was the httle Ferry Inn, which has stood in its present situation for about one hundred years. During the occupancy of Mrs. Whyte, the present tenant, it has been thrice enlarged ; the first modest building having only one window in the second storey above the door, and the old stable was below at the corner of the road. Most of the stones of which the inn is built were brought from the remains of the old mansion, belonging to the Campbells of Oarrick, which stood close to the celebrated silver firs, known as the \"Big Trees,\" within the Campsail Woods. The former hostelry, a A RETROSPECT. 51 humble, thatched, single-storied house, stood a little further up, facing the castle and bay, and the ancient road to the ferry followed the bend of the shore from Strouel Bay, and skirted the beach all the way along to the Mill Bay. Just beyond the inn is a pretty glen, shaded with trees of considerable size, through which the Clachan burn meanders, until it enters the loch close beside the little one-storeyed cottage, built at the beginning of the century by old Neil Fletcher, who tenanted the salmon fishing there. Mr. Fletcher came from the island of Mull, and long resided at Eosneath, and helped to plant the wood full of umbrageous trees between his house and the Clachan village. For a short time previous to Mr. John Dodds being appointed schoolmaster, Fletcher conducted a small school at the HUl of Campsail. Some of the old stakes which sup- ported the salmon nets are still to be seen on the shore. His widow, who lived to the patriarchal age of 96, and was much respected, resided here until a few years ago. There is now a rising boat building establishment located at the entrance of the burn, started by Mr. John M'Lean, and managed by his son Peter, an energetic young native of Eosneath, and some of their four and five tonners have been very successful as racing craft. A short distance up the road is the Clachan of Eosneath, which, even now, is a picturesque-looking row of houses, and has interesting features fast passing away. Before the erection of the new school- house and grocer's shop adjoining, the row of cottages were white- washed old structures, with thatched roofs, or red tiled ones, mellow 52 ROSNEATH. with age, and overgrown with moss and lichens. The cottage adjoin- ing the post oflBce, with the roof partly open, was, in its day, thought a handsome one, and was put up by the two brothers of Mr. Lome Campbell for the widow of the Eev. Mr. Macfarlane, minister of Arrochar. Now only three or four cottages have tile roofs, the others being slated, and the interpolation of a newly constructed stone house detracts considerably from the air of antiquity once so pleas- ing. The end cottage was long a noted public house, kept by Mr. M'Wattie, one of the six which were in existence when the Eev. Robert Story was minister of the parish. The old house with its gable to the road, and facing the Churchyard, was long used as the village school, and the schoolmaster occupied the upper storey. It was for many years tenanted by the late respected Mr. John Dodds, who, for fifty years, taught the youth of the parish, and died in 1870. Here assembled not only the sturdy, chubby-faced, young children of the farmers and their labourers, but the families of the resident gentry were glad to enjoy the privilege of the admirable tuition dispensed by Mr. Dodds. In addition to the ordinary branches of knowledge imparted in the parish schools of Scotland, Mr. Dodds taught the higher departments of mathematics, land-surveying, and navigation, and gave competent instruction in French. Many of his pupils achieved distinction in various walks in life, and remembered long, with kindly affection, the thorough grounding in education acquired at the Eosneath school. Mr. Dodds filled other posts in connection with the parish and Church, and for twenty years was kind A RETROSPECT. 53 enough to act aa postmaster, upon most- inadequate remuneration. The letters were posted at a small slit in the wall near the door of the house, which can still be traced in the surface of the plaster, while they were given out at a square window, which used to be in the little brick building formerly annexed to the house. * Dr. James Dodds, the esteemed parish minister of Corstorphine, is a son of the worthy old schoolmaster of Eosneath. At that time there was some fine old trees surrounding the Church- yard, one specially admired chestnut tree being right opposite the schoolhouse, and a low broken dyke, covered with turf, bounded the burying ground. The public road to the Clachan and old Church opened on to the village opposite to the new post office, and on the right hand side, not far from the manse, there was a thatch-roofed public-house, with its gable on to the road, which has long since dis- appeared. All the fields about the Clachan Village had their names, and those are now well-nigh forgotten, except by some of the older inhabitants. The field between the Yew Avenue and the Clachan Braes was known as the \" Enclosure,\" the corresponding one on the other side of the Avenue was \"Barn park.\" The park near which the new schoolhouse stands is \" Tom-a-Mhoid,\" the \"field of justice.\" This is a name common in the Highlands, there is a similar one at Balernock on the Shandon side of the loch. The field in front of * By a recent alteration a stair leads to the upper part of the house, thus forming a second tenement. 54 ROSNEATH. the new schoolhouse was called \" Galium Crubach,\" or in English, \"Cripple Malcolm.\" The new Church stands on what was known as the \"Manse Croft,\" and that on the right hand, as you go to the Ferry Inn, is the \"Ferry Park.\" The one beyond it again has long been known as \" The Moyachs,\" which term, in Gaelic, signifies \"a hare.\" The piece of ground partly occupied by Tigh-na-mara villa, and Kenmure Cottage, above the Strouel Well, was known as the \" Strouel Acre.\" The \" North \" and \" South \" parks are those near Mr. Howie's new Clachan Farm, and other local names may still be recalled by those who knew the district before it lost its primitive character. One of the admired features of Eosneath is the fine avenue of yew trees, which extends from the little wooden bridge over the Clachan burn, up to the old mansion at the other end, which long was used as a sort of dower house of the Argyll family. It is not easy to ascertain the exact age of these stately yews, but it certainly must be well on to two hundred years. In the very hottest day in summer, there is ever a grateful shade under their mantling boughs, which are, at many points, interlaced together, and form an appro- priate avenue to the ancient resting-place of the dead. Sometimes the light breezes play amidst their sombre sprays, with a subdued murmuring sound, like the hollow voice of the ocean. Many genera- tions of Clachan children have gambolled under the branches of these venerable trees, their merry cries resounding throughout the bosky glade. This is a favourite subject for artists, and in summer they p 'A 1> <l Eh W A BETROSPECT. 55 may often be observed depicting this rich sylvan scene. When the moon is full, and shining right down on the hoary yews, the soft shadows lie sleeping on the sward below, and the vista is one full of still, impressive beauty. Beyond the yews are two rows of spreading lime trees, which give shelter to the avenue, and whose boughs in summer resound with the hum of many bees, as they gather their fragrant harvest, and \"flee hame wi' lades o' treasure.\" Conjecture has been busy as to the meaning of this yew avenue, and the moss grown mansion house. It would seem that two massive stone pillars once formed the entrance, at the spot where the wooden bridge over the Clachan burn now stands. Their foundations were seen, not long ago, by the village joiner when making some repairs. There was a tradition that a monastery had once existed where the Clachan House is placed, and when the tenant of the farm was making a drain he came upon a quantity of massive stones, all solidly located, and forming a firm foundation for a large building. The existing house has been erected at different dates, the oldest portion being next the avenue, and was once of much greater extent, — a large wing having been puUed down forty years ago. John Campbell, of Mamore, an ancestor of the Duke of Argyll, lived in this house in the last century, and, since then, it was long occupied by Mr. Eobert Campbell, the Duke's factor ; by his son, the late John Douglas Campbell of Peatoun ; and by Mr. Howie, tenant of the Clachan farm. It is now partly tenanted by several families, and is falling considerably out of repair, in many parts, but forms an appropriate 66 ROSNEATH. and picturesque termination to the jew avenue. The old garden beside it is of some size, and in the park behind are several large plane and ash trees. One of the finest plane trees in this part of Scotland is to be seen on the left hand of the yew avenue, near the Church- yard, overhanging the burn. This noble sycamore has a grand appearance, its gigantic limbs springing from a massive bole, which, at three feet from the ground, is fourteen feet, three inches, in circum- ference. There is a most useful bed of sand, admirably suitable for building purposes, in front of the Olachan House near the public road. A little distance from the old house, along the road, you come to the Strouel Well, which is a running stream of water that has only been known to fail on very rare occasions of extreme drought. The old road to the ferry used to run along the shore between the beach and the row of venerable ash trees which now overhang the Strand, and, one by one, are succumbing to the fury of the wintry blasts. * Early in this century the road had diminished to a mere track, and has long been wholly obliterated. No doubt this was the ancient road from Glasgow to the Western Highlands by which pil- grims journeyed to lona. It was a continuation of the \" Highland- man's Eoad\" at Row, and led along the Loch side as far as the Hatton-burn at Barremman, and then crossed the field in an oblique * The straight road from the Mill Bay across the field in front of the Church, along the end of the Clachan Village to Strouel Bay, was made by John Duke of Argyle about the year 1770. It ran all the way from the Castle of Rosneath to the head of Loch Long. See Appendix. A RETEOSPECT. 57 direction, near Barremman House, over the moor, and down upon Coulport, Loch Long. The loch has made gradual incursions upon the existing road, and, in front of the houses at Strouel, where now only a narrow strip of turf two or three feet wide extends, there was, sixty years ago, sufficient space for the boys to play at shinty. About that time there was an old drying kiln, just below the cottage a little way from the Strouel Well, to which the farmers brought their grain. There is another of the splendid plane trees which flourish so well in this Peninsula, just below the cottage, and its great twisted, gnarled, roots are exposed to view, as the soil is gradually becoming washed away. We now are at the commencement of the various feus which have been taken off the Barremman estate, which joins the Duke's land at the small burn beyond the Strouel well. Feuing commenced in the year 1825, previously to which date the shore, from this point to Gareloch-head, presented an unbroken slope of green fields and bracken-clad braes, with the exception of some thatched cottages at rare intervals. Indeed, Mr. James Campbell, Strouel Cottage, whose father tenanted Strouel farm, has ploughed along the whole shore up to Barremman pier, where now is a continuous row of handsome villas. The first feu, taken about 1825, from Barremman estate, and subse- quently entirely bought up, was the villa now known as Achnashie, \"Field of Peace,\" where the Eev. Dr. M'Leod Campbell died.* Mr. * Tke small villa, known as \" Strouel Cottage,\" was also feued in 1825. 58 ROSNEATH. Angus, who was the feuar, verbally arranged with Mr. Gumming, the proprietor of the estate, that he should have the shore-land as far as low-water mark, but this was afterwards disputed by the laird. Upon taking the matter to the Court of Session, it was agreed that the feu should extend as far into the loch as a man on horseback could ride, starting at low water. The house erected by Mr. Angus, and left to his two daughters, was known as \" The Chateau,\" until Dr. Campbell selected the more appropriate Gaelic name of Achnashie, and was an unpretending, solid, stone structure, with heavy overhang- ing eaves. The square house, close to the road within the grounds, is called \"Gareloch House,\" and was also built by Mr. Angus. Nearly opposite is the small rocky island, which is entirely sub- merged at high water, known as Carrick-na-raon, or \"Eock of the Seal.\" This shows that seals used to frequent the Gareloch before the advent of steamers. Passing by Achnashie and the little cluster of houses at Strouel, which were erected about the same time, we come to Strouel Lodge, a comfortable-looking old-fashioned mansion, erected in 1829 by the late Mr. William Robertson of Greenock, a noted yachtsman in his time, his old cutter. The Gipsy, being a great success in the early days of pleasure cruising on the Clyde. Mr. Eobertson, a quaint gentleman of the old school, was one of the last who practised the classical pastime of hawking, and might often be seen on the Eosneath roads and uplands, the hawk on his wrist, pursuing his favourite calling. His son, the late Mr. George Eobertson, for more A RETROSPECT. 69 than fifty years resided at Strouel, whose familiar and respected figure was well-known in the parish, died in 1887. The next feu taken off Barremman was \" Whitelea,\" in the year 1829, when Mr. Stenhouse built the substantial square house, which he occupied him- self, and then left to his nieces. Another large feu taken shortly afterwards was by Mr Monteith, who built Clynder House, and several smaller houses, with their gable ends on to the road. This was long a favourite - spot with summer visitors, who used to land from the steamer in a small boat kept by James Campbell, Crossowen, the old ferryman, until, in 1866, Clynder pier was built by Mr. Archibald Chalmers, a native of Eosneath. This pier has now been acquired by Mr. Thom of Barremman, and is in process of gradual demolition, as he considers the requirements of the district are amply met by Barremman pier. Up till 1866 the shores of the loch had a sweet secluded aspect, which was lost when the hotel and buildings, and the lofty tenement known as Victoria Place, were subsequently erected by Mr. Robert Turner, another native of the parish. Before the erection of the villas and shops at Clynder, there were a few rough stone houses, with thatched roofs, (one row a little way above the spot on which the small iron Church now stands), and their gables to the loch, which have been pulled down. Also at Crossowen, near where Barremman pier is placed, there was the small, old thatched farm house and buildings, and another similar cottage at Hatton- burn. Going along the shore, you now come to Barremman House, a plain mansion, of moderate size, facing the loch. The estate was for 60 ROSNEATH. more than a century and a half in possession of the Gumming family, who had long been connected with the district. In 1871, Barremman was sold by its late proprietor, Mr. Robert Crawford Gumming, and acquired by its present owner, Mr. Robert Thorn of G-lasgow, who is also proprietor of the Island of Canna in the West Highlands. Barremman House has been three times added to, the original mansion having been a humble structure with the door between two windows, and three others above. About 1840, Mr. Gumming made an addition of some rooms, and a porch facing the south, and when Mr. Thom acquired the property, he doubled the accommodation by a large increase to the west. A little to the north of the present house, the old mansion stands where the Cummings resided in former days, a very simple, rough- cast house of two storeys. Part of the house is antique, the lower portion having been originally built with unhewn stones, taken from the shore, interspersed with clay, and it had a thatched roof. An extra storey of more substantial architecture was added, and a slate roof substituted. Over the door the following names are cut in the stone : — Patrick Gxjming, 1730. Mary M'Farlane"
