THE materials of the present volume, all taken from the charter-room at Taymouth, have been selected more with the view of illustrating the antiquities of the Central Highlands, and the modes of life and thought of their inhabitants in the old time, than for any purpose of public national history, or for the genealogy and antiquities of the family of Breadalbane. But that family having so long borne sway in the district, their personal affairs are to some extent mixed up with all local history ; and a general acquaintance with the early descents of the house of Glenurchy is necessary for the full understanding of the materials now brought together. It is here supplied by the first article of our collection. The \" BLACK BOOK OF TAYMOUTH,\" has been long known and used as an autfe Booh of authority in the Highlands. It is now for the first time printed from the MS. of its author, Master William Bowie, who seems to have discharged the double duty of family notary and pedagogue to the grandsons of Sir Duncan Campbell, the seventh laird of Glenurchy. He dedicates his work to his patron, in the month of June 1598, and though he lived to add some matter of subsequent date, the conclusion, coming down to 1648, seems written by a different hand. His chief object was to record the successive acquisitions of property. In his Latin verses, he instils the virtuous maxim — . . . dominum haud nobilitat domus, Antiquissima quanquam et celeberrima ; 11 PREFACE. while in native Scotch he admonishes the posterity of the house of G-lenurchy to follow the footsteps of their ancestors, and as their chief duty — \" Conques or keip thingis conquest.\"1 Bowie's narrative of the descent of the family has the advantage of being founded, in all material parts, on charters and written evidence in the charter- room, to which from his employment he had access. He only alludes to the origin of the race and its first settlement on Loch Awe, and then passes at once to Sir Colin of Glenurchy, the second son of the Lord of Loch Awe, who, on 20th October 1432, had a charter from his father of the territory of Glenurchy, and by the second of two illustrious marriages acquired the third of the great lordship of Lorn. Master William Bowie must have taken pride in recording his conquests, as well as his building of the Castle of Inverary for his nephew the first Earl of Argyll, and the Castle of Ilankeilquhirn, long the chief strength of his own descendants.2 He built also the Tower of Strathfillane, and the barbican wall of the Isle of Loch Tay, whence the Nuns, who had given shelter and a grave to Queen Sibilla, had been ejected long before. The last two seem to mark the intention thus early, if not rather the natural ten dency, of the younger of the great families of Campbell to withdraw from under the shadow of the elder house. That Sir Colin was a Knight of Rhodes, and was \" three sundry times at Borne,\" we must receive on our chronicler's testimony, unless it may be thought to have some support from the popular pedigrees of the Campbells, where Sir Colin is styled \" Colin duibh na Roimh,\" — black Colin of Rome, and from the family tradition recorded in the very curious Inventory of lieirship moveables, made up in Sir Robert's time, where, among the jewels of the house, we find— \" ane stone of the quantitye of 1 To \"conqueis\" is to acquire. In law of Eldin, touched in China ink by himself, language we still speak of property of which shews the Castle a good deal more conquest, distinguished from that in- entire than at present, and its \" island \" herited. quite surrounded by the Lake.

John and Colin, the fifth and sixth lairds, were brothers of Duncan the fourth. Colin, though inheriting after two brothers, was thirty-three years in possession, and falling in the time of dilapidation of church lands, had time and means to convert the \"tack\" of many lands of Breadalbane, held of the Charter-house of Perth and of the Crown, into a secure feu-tenure, and to conqueis many other lands in Perthshire and a town lodging in the county town. He built the Castle of Balloch, where the house of Tay mouth now stands,3 and he added the four kernils, (corner towers,) and the north chambers, to the hereditary mansion of Kilchurn. Mr. Bowie celebrates him as \" a great 1 The jewel so particularly described as the amulet worn in battle by the Knight of the Cross, would seem to have been used as a charm for more homely purposes after wards ; and one agreeing marvellously with its description is still at Taymouth, though it has not remained continuously in the family custody. 3 \" Duncan M'Callein an dygriddir,\" Dun can, the son of Colin the good knight, is the subject, as well as apparently the author, of some Gaelic verses, preserved in \"the collec tion of Dean M'Gregor, now in the Advo cates' Library, — a collection which must be studied whenever the antiquities of Gaelic literature are to be honestly illustrated. 3 Part of Sir Colin's work still remains at Taymouth, and some of the escutcheons of arms with which he ornamented his house, are still preserved at one of the Park Gates. iv PREFACE. Justiciar all his time,\" in that he caused execute many notable limmers,1 (not the least notable being that \" Duncan Laideus,\" whose story will come afterwards,) and even the Laird of M'Gregor himself, that is, Gregor Koy of Glensthrae, who was beheaded with much solemnity on the green of Kenmore. The seventh laird, Sir Duncan, our author's patron, is a person on whose history we dwell with more pleasure. Bowie records a glorious list of conquests of lands and church possessions, and the provisions he bestowed on his children, legitimate and illegitimate. But we have interest of another kind in Black Duncan — Donacha dim na curich, as he is called from the cowl in which he is represented in his picture at Taymouth. He was, if not the first of Scotchmen, the very foremost of Highland proprietors, to turn his atten tion to the rural improvement of his country. His predecessors had indeed built rude dwellings and places of defence, round which time and decay have thrown a picturesqueness little thought of in their erection. But we find no signs of these earlier lords appreciating their beautiful country, or trying to increase its comforts or its productiveness. It cannot be said that Sir Duncan himself had taste for the picturesque, but he knew the profit as well as the beauty that might accrue from clothing the hill-side with timber and securing shelter round his mansion. He had some feeling for art also. He built the Castle of Finlarg and ornamented its chapel \" with pavement and painterie.\" He built the tower of Achalladour, repaired Ilankeilchurn, built the house of Lochdochart, a great house at Barcaldine in Benderloch, (between Loch Etive and Loch Criran,) defended the grounds of Balloch against the river by a great embankment. He built or repaired the Church of Glenurchy, and built a bridge over the water of Lochy, \" to the great contentment and weal of the country.\" He wa,s enterprising enough to travel abroad and passed to the courts of England and France, and in 1602, thought good to take a view of Flanders and of the wars. He took measures for enforcing an old Scotch law which enjoined the planting of a few trees about every tenant's and cottar's dwelling, and on the greater scale which became the landlord, he \"caused make parks in Balloch, Finlarg, Glenloquhay, and 1 Thieves. PREFACE. V Glenurquhay, and caused sow acorns and seed of fir therein, and planted in the same young fir and birch.\" He seems to have imitated his cousin, William Earl of Gowrie,1 in introducing trees of foreign growth, and tradition points to him as the planter of the venerable chestnut and walnut trees at Finlarg and Taymouth. He was probably the first of Scotchmen who brought in fallow deer, for our chronicler tells us that in 1614 he took a lease of the Isle of Inchesaile from the Earl of Argyll, and in 1615 \" put fallow deir and cunnyngis \" therein. In another department of rural policy, it is not so cer tain that he was first, but it is of him that we have the first evidence, in connexion with the rearing of horses. In one bloody foray the M'Gregors slew forty of Sir Duncan's brood mares in the Cosche of Glenurchy, and at the same time a blood horse, — \"ane fair cursour sent to him from the Prince out of London.\"2 The horse had come to an untimely end even before his royal master was taken away, but the stud went on increasing under the careful eye and vigorous management of Black Duncan. Sir Duncan may be thought to have inherited some of these tastes through his mother, a daughter of the accomplished and unfortunate house of Gowrie. I have found only one of her books in the library. It is a copy of Sleidan's Chronicle, London, 1560. On a fly-leaf she has written — This buke pertenis to Catherine Euthven Lady of Glenurquhay. 1 When the Earl of Gowrie was pressed by Home of Godscroft to join in the second conspiracy, for which he eventually suffered, \"looking very pitifully upon his gallerie,\" says Godscroft, \" where wee were walking at that time, which he had but newly built and decorated with pictures, he brake out into these words, having first fetched a deep sigh — ' Cousin,' says he, ' is there no re- niedie 1 Impius hcec tarn culta novalia miles habebit ! Barbarus has segetes I ' \" — (Godscroft, Edit. 1644, p. 377.) Upon a scrap of paper on which, while in prison, he had noted down some pleas to be ad dressed to his judges, we find written — \"What pitie it wer to take me from my parks and policie !\" He was an extensive planter, for that age, and particularly fond of the Spanish chestnut and walnut. 2 We know something of this \" fair cur- sour.\" The Knight of Glenurchy had pre sented the Prince (Henry, son of James VI.) with some eagles with which he had had good sport, and in return the prince sent him \" a horse to be a stallon, one of the best in his stable,\" with a hope that when he came to Scotland seven years hence, he should get some of his breed. vi PREFACE. We have abundant evidence that the seventh laird was a man of affairs, and well maintained his place in that age of unscrupulous politicians. In his own territories, castles, and family, he practised a very vigorous personal control and the most methodical administration. The estate books and books of house hold accounts and inventories kept under his direction give us the earliest picture we have of the life of a great Highland lord. It is not so easy to imagine the rough chieftain cultivating literature : yet, grim as he stands in the picture opposite,1 the black Duncan had a taste for books, read history and romance, and is not quite free from the suspicion of having dabbled in verse himself. Several of his books are still preserved at Taymouth, where the frequent inscriptions in his own hand shew he took pleasure in them ; and we must remember that book collecting was not yet a fashion. One of his favourites, in which he evidently much de lighted, was \" The Buike of King Alexander the Conqueroure,\" a ponderous romance in MS.2 Some original verses, mostly moral and religious, written on the blank leaves of his books, would be worth preserving, if it were possible more satisfactorily to establish their authorship. The influence of Sir Duncan Campbell extended over an unusual length of time. He was forty-eight years lord of the family estates, and was eighty- six years old when he died in 1631. The next generation carries us a long step forward in civilisation. Sir Colin, the eighth laird of Glenurchy, was as fond of repairing and extending his family castles as his father had been. Moreover, he gave in to the new luxuries of rich furniture and hangings of silk and tapestry, in which England was then shewing its wealth. His chronicler records his expenses in Arras hangings, silk beds, and damask \" napery,\" brought out of West Flanders. 1 From the original picture in the Bread- parently transcribed for Sir Duncan, who albane apartments at Holyrood. has written his name repeatedly in one of 2 This, which has never been printed, is a them, with the dates 1579, 1581, 1582. translation of the great French ROMAN The other copy contains at the end Duncan U'ALEXANDRE, executed by Sir Gilbert Hay, Laideus's testament, which will be men- c. 1430, and extends to about 20,000 lines. tioned hereafter.

Vll We learn, by his books still preserved, that he was not only a Latin scholar, but fond of French and Italian literature.1 Contemporary portraits are found of Sir Duncan, but Sir Colin is the first of the family who employed artists to paint pictures as ornaments for his house. He \" bestowit and gave to ane Germane painter, whom he enterteinit in his house aucht moneth . . . the soume of ane thousand pundis.\" The name of the German artist is not found, nor is it of much interest to ascertain who painted the \" threttie broads\" and portraits from fancy which still cover some of the walls at Taymouth. Sir Colin could appreciate the more delicate pencil of an artist of his own country. It is to his taste that we owe the largest collection, and perhaps the best works of the pencil of the first of Scotch painters, Jamesone. The notice of Bowie, and the letters of Jamesone himself, shew the rapidity of the artist's work and the prices he received for his pictures. He undertakes to paint sixteen pictures between July and the end of September, and he informs his patron that his ordinary price is twenty merks for a half length, or twenty pounds, with a double gilt muller (frame). These letters also serve to prove that Jamesone was working at Taymouth while Bowie or his continuator was writing the \" Black Book,\" and it does not seem unreasonable to conjecture that the fanci ful and often grotesque portraits that are found in it are from the ready pencil of one accustomed to paint imaginary portraits, and actually engaged at the time in ornamenting the family tree of the house of Breadalbane. The por trait of Sir Colin, Jamesone's patron, is more careful than the rest, and is evidently a characteristic likeness.2 1 He was iu the habit of writing on his books those pithy Italian and Latin apoph thegms then so much admired. The sen tences of Italian seem chiefly to be taken from a little collection, entitled \" Oracoli politici cioe sentenze et document! nobili et illustri,\" printed by Aldus, 1590, a copy of which, marked with his initials, is pre served at Taymouth. 2 The large family tree ornamented with portraits, in the south-west tower at Tay mouth, is inscribed \" The Genealogie of the hous of Glenurquhie, quhairof is dtscendit sundrie nobili and worthie housis, 1635. O. Jameson faciebat.\" Sir Duncan of Lochow, the great ancestor of the family, is in a red plaid and kilt, with a shirt of mail, short checked hose, and bare knees. The other pictures of Jamesone's I have observed at Taymouth are — Johne, Loird Leslie, 1633. Thomas, Lord of Binning, 1636. Vlll PREFACE. If Master William Bowie lived to write the memoir of Sir Kobert, the ninth laird of Glenurchy, it must have caused him much grief. The house of Breadalbane had fallen upon evil times. Public events and family expenses combined to bear it down, and the Notary's last pages record the legal steps taken by numerous creditors against the unhappy Sir Eobert. It is a pity the old man could not have lived to see the family restored in fortune and increased in honours in the next generation, in the person of his pupil. TUB CHRONICLE The second article of the volume has been named \" THE CHRONICLE OF FORTIRGALL/' on presumptions afforded by the MS. It is a small 4to book of paper, much decayed and imperfect, giving no name of the compiler or writer. The first part of its contents are almost identical with a chronicle already known and published as Dean McGregor's Chronicle. The author (a person vhom we reverence as the sole early collector of Highland poetry) was James M'Gregor, Dean of Lismore, and Vicar of Fortirgall. The present compilation notices the death of the Dean himself, which took place in 1551, and brings the record of events considerably lower. We gather from its contents that the writer was a McGregor, acknowledging M'Gregor of Glensthrae for his chief; that he was a priest, and \"said his first mass\" at Whitsunday 1531 ; that he came to the Cure of Fortirgall at Beltane 1532 ; and that he spent the remainder of his life in that neighbourhood. He records chiefly the obits and funerals of Fortirgall and Inchaddin, though mixed with such as interested him of the passing events of the Highlands, and of the public affairs of the country. He records that he began to sow oats in the Borllin of Fortirgall on 23d March of each of the years 1575 and 1576 ; and the last entry of his journal is dated 25th April 1579.

IX interesting and important of Scotch history, there is no comment on public events, and nothing that is new to the student of history. Within the space of two leaves, the deaths of Kizzio, of Darnley, of Murray, of Archbishop Hamilton, are noted ; without any new circumstances, and with a remarkable avoidance of any expression of feeling. Somewhat more is elicited by the murder or death of some good neighbour or friend of the chronicler, when he deals a short eulogium, — \" bonus fait\" — or especially if he can say \" non fuit avarus\" or \" Deus diligit hilarem datoreni,\" concluding with a \" requiescat in pace\" or \" Deus propitietur.\" Perhaps it was necessary caution that prevented him from denouncing more openly the Reformation, to which he was no friend. 1558, says he, fuit principium novce legis hereticorum. In 1559, he records that the summer before, the great steugh came in Scotland against the faith that our progeni tors had long time afore that. That same summer (1559) \" the Charter-house (of Perth) was destroyed, Scone burnt, mekil trouble in Scotland. None durst say mass nor sacrament in the old fashion.\" He notes the death of one who was \"firmus in fide catholica\" and of several who died in lege Lutherana, or who \" renounced the law and the sacraments,\" leaving no doubt of his own principles ; yet he occasionally bestows an orate pro anima even upon one of these heretics ; and he records with equal impassiveness the day of St. Bartho lomew in France, — \" the Papetis in France slew and murdreist in the nicht mony men and women of the congregation ;\" and the death of John Hamil ton, — \" the said bissop was tayne and justifeit and hangit in Strywelyn.\" Perhaps the part of the Chroniole of the Curate of Fortirgall which may prove most useful, is his record of the weather, — of good and bad seasons, and of the consequent fluctuation of the prices of victuals. The first noticed by him is 1554, when there was frost and snow \"whiles\" before Andersmas, (30th November,) and continued frost from 13th December, and great snow from Yule day at even, and every day from thenceforth more and more without any thaw till the 17th of January. \" It was the greatest snow and storm that was seen in memory of man living that time. Many wild horses and mares, kye, sheep, goats, perished and died for want of food in the mountains, and in all other parts ; and though partial thaw came on 17th January, it began then X PREFACE. to snow and freeze till the 22d day of February, on which day men and women might well pass on the ice of Lyon in sundry places, and little tilth till the 26th day of February, and but in layth (sheltered) places.\" The winter of 1561-62, there \" was mekle snow in all parts, and many deer and roes slaine.\" The summer of 1563 he commemorates as \" right dear ; viz., the boll of meal 5 merks.\" In the following summer there was \" mekle rain continually, but good cheap of victuals in all parts.\" The boll of meal which had been as high as 5 merks (£3, 6s. 8d.) the preceding year, sold for eighteen shillings, and malt for twenty-eight shillings. \" The summer of 1570 right good, and all victuals good cheap, but the winter and Lentron quarter following evil weather, many sheep and goats died through scarcity of fodder. In the spring of 1571-2, from 15th January till the 22d March great frost, so that no ploughs went till eight days thereafter, and men might well pass and repass on the ice of Lyon the 3d day of March.\" But the following winter struck the chronicler of Fortirgall as more than usually severe. \" The 22d day of February there came after noon a great storm, and snow and hail and wind, that no man nor beast might lift up their heads, nor walk nor ride, and many beasts perished without in that storm, and many men and women perished in sundry places ; and all kinds of victual right dear, and that because no mills might grind for the frost. All corn came to the Mill of Dunkeld out of St. Johnstoun (Perth) betwixt that and Dunkeld, and all other bounds about far and near. The meal gave that time in St. John stoun, 43 shillings, the malt 34 shillings ; and before St. Patrick's day (17th March) the meal was 25s. 8d., and the malt for 30 shillings.\" Many other notices of the weather occur, which are always valuable when made at the time and by an eye-witness ; and many instances are given of that fluctuation of prices which in times of little foreign trade was ever and anon reducing the people at one plunge from plenty to starvation. Some liberties have been used in printing this little chronicle. The entries which in the original stand very promiscuously, have been arranged according to the order of date. A list of Scotch Kings1 from Boece, 1 P. 20 of MS. PREFACE. XI has been omitted. A few memoranda and notes, moral precepts, medical recipes scribbled on blank pages of the original, have been here collected at the end, that nothing might be omitted which may be thought to show the modes of acting, of thinking, and even of idling, in the time and country which are the subject of our collection. All that has been attempted with regard to the language, is to print literally as the writer wrote. Probably his native and familiar tongue was Gaelic, and in it he may be correct, but his Latin is very peculiar, and even in Scotch, which was not bound by very strict rules of spelling, the curate of Fortirgall takes unusual latitude. DUNCAN LAIDEUS' ALIAS MAKGREGOURIS TESTAMENT comes next. Pennant saw it at Taymouth in September 1769, and communicated it to Warton, who speaks of it as \" an anonymous Scotch poem which contains capital touches of satirical humour not inferior to those of Dunbar and Lyndesay.\" 1 He inclines to think the hero and supposed speaker of the poem altogether an imaginary personage, a mere type of the Highland freebooter. The verses are written on the blank leaves at the end of one of the copies of the Komance of Alexander, but in a different hand from it. They are unfortunately anonymous, and we have no clue to enable us to conjecture the author. It was a mistake, however, to suppose that the subject of the poem, the person in whose mouth the satire is put, was an imaginary person. Dun can M'Gregor, called Laidus or Laudasach, was but too well known in Bread- albane and the Highlands for half a century, although the documents and records by which his history is vouched are of the end of it. 1 History of English Poetry, p. 482, Edit. 1840. — Though so accomplished an Eng lish scholar, Warton was hardly able to appreciate the language of Duncan Lai- deus. His explanatory notes of the few verses which he quotes are very bad. — \" Barne tyme,\" a family of children, Anglo- Saxon beam team, he renders \" harvest.\" \" Rig,\" a ridge of ploughed land, he makes \"Rick.\" \"Quart,\" he calls an English gallon ; I know not why. \" Into deid,\" which means merely \" indeed,\" he reads \" unto death.\" \" Allege,\" which the context ought to have shown him stands for \" legate \" or \"bequeath,\" he translates \"give, assign.\" \"Sessioun,\" he makes \" Parliament,\" a sense it never bore in Scotland. Here it means the Court of Session : &c. &c. TESTAMENT. Xll PKEFACE. He must have been of some standing in the proscribed but powerful clan, although his daring character may have helped as much as his cousinship to place him in the office of tutor of the young Chief of M'Gregor. His chro nicler informs us that in his youth he led the life of all his clan, — the life of the Arab robber, or the wolf on whose head a price is set. Hunted \" through Lome, Argyll, Menteith, and Breadalbane,\" he retired to the wilds of Lochaber, where he hoped to find shelter with Lochiel ; but the Earl of Argyll having pursued him hotly, he doubled back to Breadalbane, where he was taken and thrown into prison by Sir Duncan Campbell, the second Laird of Grlenurchy. He escaped, and made himself strong with many followers in the confusion that followed the Field of Flodden, where the Knight of Glenurchy was slain, with his cousin of Argyll and their royal master. From this period (1513) till his death, he was the terror of the Highlands. Of the injuries he suffered person ally, or the wrongs he may have had to avenge, we know little. The story is told- by the other party. His last exploits we must take from the formal nar rative of the public prosecutor. On the 26th November 1551, the Queen's Advocate set forth that \" Duncan Laudes and G-regour his sone recently, namely upoun Sounday the 22d day of November instant, at sex houris at evin under silence of nycht, be way of hamesukin cam to the hous of Alaster Owir alias M'Gregour servand to Colyne Campbell of Glenurquhay of the landis of Moreis and be force tuke him furth of his said hous and be way of murthure straik him with quhingearis and crewellie slew him and spulzeit and tuke fra him his purs and in it the soume of fourty poundis ; and incontinent thireftir past to the landis of Killing to the hous of ane pure man callit Johnne M'Bayne Pipare and thair assegit the said hous and brak the durris thairof and be force tuke the said Johnne furth of the samin and straik his heid fra his body and crewellie slew him and gaif him divers uther straikis with quhingearis in his body,\" &c. For this murder on his \" awin natioun,\" as his historian tells us, he and his son were charged1 and \" put to the home ;\" which they treated with derision. And the common process of law was not likely to be otherwise treated by such as Duncan. Here, however, it was enforced by others than 1 The charge was executed at the Market Cross of Perth, on 28th November 1551. PREFACE. Xlll the Queen's messengers. Alaster Owir, though a Macgregor, was a \" servant \" of Glenurchy's, who was, therefore, bound to avenge his murder. Of one step taken for that purpose we have the particulars in this collection. On the llth March 1551,1 Glenurchy took a bond of manrent or service from James Stewart of Ballindoran, and two Drtimmonds, whereby these parties bound themselves \" with their whole power, with their kin, friends and partakers, to invade and pursue to the death Duncan Laudosach M'Gregour, Gregour his son, thair servands, partakers and complices ... be reason that thai ar our deidlie enemies and our Soverane Ladie's rebels.\"2 The foxes had still another double for their lives. Notwithstanding the deadly feud that was between them, and although Glenurchy had obtained a gift from Chatelherault the Governor, of the escheat of the outlaws, they found means to avert his wrath, and even to obtain his protection. On the 2d of May 1552,3 Colyne Campbell of Glenurquhai (the zeal of love and good conscience moving him) received Duncane Makgregour and Gregour his son in his maintenance (protection), for gave all manner of actions and faults that they had committed, and gave them back the escheat of. their goods which he had purchased when they were the queen's rebels ; they being now received to the Queen's peace and his favour. The sole condition stipulated was that the Macgregors should fulfil their bond of manrent (service) to Glenurchy in all points.4 The subsequent cause of quarrel we do not learn. The wild blood of the Macgregors may have broken out in some new enormity too great for pardon and too clear for trial. On the 16th of June 1552, says the Curate of Fortirgall, Duncan Macgregor and his sons Gregor and Malcolm Roy were beheaded by Colin Campbell of Glenurchy, Campbell of Glenlyon, and Menzies of Rannoch.5 1 That is, three months after the murder of Alaster Owir, — the year ending 24th March. 8 17, p. 192. It may have been in revenge of this undertaking that the M'Gregors, many years afterwards, murdered John Drummond (though under double assurance of their clan) with the circumstances of special and almost solemn ferocity described in a subsequent bond.— 112, p. 244. 3 Little more than a month after the bond with Stewart and Drummond. 4 18, p. 193. 5 Before the end of 1552 we meet with a gift to Glenurchy of the escheat of inove- ables and immovables of umquhil — M'Gregor alias Ladassach, and Gregor his son . . . convict of certain crimes . . . and justyfeit to the death. XIV PREFACE. Such was the person in whose mouth the anonymous poet of Breadalbane, fol lowing the practice which Dunbar and Lindsay had rendered popular, has put the \" Testament \"which is here printed with scrupulous fidelity from the original MS. The reader of modern English poetry will require to make some allow ance for the time and the country of the Scotch poet of the 16th century. But the student of early English literature will find no difficulty in the mere lan guage and spelling ; and much of what now seems uncouth in the thoughts and the management of the poem, is in truth imitated from the great early masters who were writing verse and cultivating the same Saxon tongue in Scot land and England equally and contemporaneously. The impersonation, in the beginning, not only of the virtues and vices, but of other abstractions, a practice which may be traced back to the \"mysteries\" and Church plays of the middle ages, will not seem altogether strange to one familiar with the allegories of Spencer and of John Bunyan. Neither will he want authorities for the inartificial confusion of the persons of the supposed speaker and the poet, though, in the present case, this produces a bad effect. We find it unnatural that the robber and outlaw should patriotically lament the battle of Flodden which gave him his own liberty ; — should describe the hanging of his fellows as a \" blessed sacrifice to our Lorde,\" and everywhere mix up moral and religious reflections with his tri umphant rehearsal of his worst exploits. But after making full deduction for such faults of composition, we find abundance to admire in this short poem. There is a breadth and intensity of satire worthy of Lindsay, and a tone of natu ral pathos of which Lindsay was hardly capable. The verses in which Laideus distributes his spiritual goods, — bequeaths to the Curate negligence, to the Vicar rapacity, oppression to the Parson, gluttony to the Prior ; to the Abbot pride and arrogance, to the Bishop his \" free will,\" and flattery and false dissembling to the Friars, — are in as vigorous a strain of condensed satire as the heats of the Reformation produced ; and we may look in vain in authors of that day for the expressions of natural feeling and pathetic regret with which the imprisoned savage is made to take his adieu of the scenes of his free life and daring. The mere enumeration of the places is highly effective, and the occasional addition of an epithet descriptive is often appropriate and distinctive as well as poetical: — PREFACE. XV \" Farewell, Glenlochy, with tky forest free, Farewell, Breadalbane and Lochtay so sheen ; Farewell, Glenalmond, garden of pleasance, For many fair flower have I from ye taen.\" \" Farewell, Stratherne, . . . Plenished with pleasant policy preclair, Of towers and town is standing fair in row\" \" Farewell, Menteth, where oft I did repair, And came unsought aye as does the snow, To part from thee my heart is wonder sair.\" Some of these verses show a sense of natural beauty and a tenderness of feeling which we do not look for in writers of that age, and which no earlier Scotch poet had expressed so well, if we except the admirable Gawin Douglas. Bonds of Friendship, Bonds of Homage, Bonds of Manrent and Mainten- BONDS OK ance, are found in greater or less quantity in all old Scotch Charter-chests, but it was reserved for the careful Sir Duncan Campbell to engross such Deeds in the form of a Register. From the Book of these compiled under his direction, the frame work of the following section is taken ; but the original bonds have been used wherever they are extant, and a large number are still preserved. If these were all of that kind so well known to the antiquary — mere modi fications of the feudal relation of lord and vassal — it would not be necessary to do more than to point out their evident utility for family and local history j1 but here we have some of a different character, and some which seem to present new points of interest for the Scotch Antiquary. We have never before had a 1 Two large collections of these bonds of society which gave rise to them, I would homage and friendship — of \" manrent and refer to the prefatory notices of these col- maintenance,\" — have been lately published lections by the Secretary of the Club. — by the Spalding Club, one from the Charter- Miscellany of the Spalding Club, Vol. II., room of Slaines, the other from Gordon p. cvi., and Vol. IV., p. xlviii. Castle. For their objects, and the state of MANKKNT. XVI PREFACE. collection of such transactions from a Highland Chiefs castle. The mixture of the two elements, — of the patriarchal and the feudal,— of that where all property was (by theory) in the tribe, and that where (by theory again) pro perty was in the lord alone, — is here seen for the first time. We have a great Chief and ruler of many Celtic tribes, living among them and conforming to their customs, yet holding his own territories and his position in the kingdom as a Feudal Baron. The M'Gregors and M'Nabs, like their Celtic brethren, holding property by no written tenures, having perhaps no individual property in the soil, were little addicted to commit their transactions to writing. But with the Norman, came strict rights of property, written tenures, and a pro pensity to records ; and instead of the vague traditions of the pure Celts, we have here preserved definite, though slight, footsteps of their immemorial usages. Charter-chests are rare in the Highlands, and in the Charter-chests of lowland Scotland there probably is not an instance of a formal deed of Adoption of a child, though the practice was evidently common under the Civil law. At Taymouth these deeds are so common, it was evidently an approved way of transmitting property. One of them relates how John M'Grillespie received John Campbell of Glenurchy as his own son, and took him on his knee, calling \\nmfilium adop- tivum, that is to say, his chosen son, and, he being on his knee, gave to the said John the half of his goods.1 In like manner John M'Bay, and Mary Vykfail, his spouse, took the same John Campbell as a bairn of their own, and their special oversman and defender, and delivered a glove in token of all their goods and a bairn's part of their goods after their decease.2 Many similar deeds in this collection show not only a new form, but a kind of transaction and a state of society unknown in the lowlands. The Celtic custom of Fostering was, in fresh observance through Breadal- bane and Argyll, during the period of these deeds, and extended through all classes. The provisions, when reduced to writing, are almost uniform, and one instance may be sufficient. 1 7, p. 182. 2 9, p. 184. PBEFACE. XVli On the 5th November 1580, Duncan of Glenurchy agrees that his native servant, Gillecreist Makdonchy Duff V'Nokerd, and Katherine Neyn Douill Vekconchy, his spouse, shall have his son Duncan in fostering, they sustaining him in meat, drink and nourishment, till he be sent to the schools, and after wards at the schools, with reasonable support, and they and his father settling upon him of \" makhelve\"1 goods, the value of 200 merks of kye, and two horses worth forty merks, with their increase ; the milk of the cattle being the foster parents' while they sustain the bairn. There is a stipulation that if Duncan shall die before being sent to the schools, another of Glenurchy's children, lass or lad, shall be fostered in his stead, who shall succeed to his goods ; and he, or the bairn that enters his place, is to have at the decease of the foster parents, a bairn's part of gear with their children.2 A similar bond of fostering, with more minute stipulations, was entered into between Duncan of Glenurchy and Duncan Campbell of Duntrone ; the former \" being of before foster son \" to Duntrone and Agnes Niklauchlane his late wife, and Duntrone and Agnes Nikolleane his present wife, \" being of the like mind that love and favour should be and continue betwixt the houses of Glenurchy and Duntrone ;\" they receive Colin Glenurchy's son and heir in fostering, and the lady promises \" to be to him a favourable and loving foster- mother in the same manner and condition as the said Duncan Campbell of Glenurchy of before was fostered in the house of Duntrone.\"3 The stipulation found in all these deeds, for giving the foster child his share in the moveable succession, is nothing more than reducing to \\yiting what was the customary law of the Highlanders in common with the other Celtic peoples.4 But the real benefit sought by both parties in those transactions, 1 This word, though known in connexion the foster child his share of the land. — \" If with goods appropriated to foster-children, an uchelwr (high man) place his son with has not been explained satisfactorily.

XV111 PREFACE. was mutual support and strength. In times when none counted much on the protection of the law, families endeavoured to surround themselves with friends and allies ; and a relation like this of fosterage begot feelings of mutual friend ship better than the artificial system of Bonds of Amity, which were apt to stand or fall with the interest and temper of the parties. In one remarkable case, which does not come within the scope of the present collection, two families agreed to perpetuate the connexion, covenanting that the eldest son of the one should always be fostered by the other. We do not know the result, nor how long it was before that contract, like other schemes for unseen generations, fell to the ground. In another instance I have lighted on a bundle of correspondence, a few letters of which will serve better than formal contracts to show the feelings of two families of the same lineage drawing closer the bonds of kindred by the still more tender relation of fosterage. The parties too, are of more than com mon interest. The father and the child were the Marquis and Earl of Argyll, each subsequently honoured by a death on the scaffold. The person selected as foster-father was the accomplished Sir Colin Campbell of Glenurchy. Even more important in such a relation, the foster-mother was Juliane Campbell, daughter of Hew, Lord Loudouu ; but of her we know only what we learn from this correspondence, and her picture at Taymouth, giving the impression of sense and good nature.1 The correspondence begins in 1633 : — From Sir COLIN CAMPBELL of Glenurchy to ARCHIBALD LORD LORNE. • MY NOBLE LORD AND CHEIFF, I receauit your lordships letter from Archibald Campbell schawing me that syndrie of your lordships freindis wer most desyrous to have your lordships eldest sone in fostering, yet for diuerss respectis your lordship wes better pleasit to have him brought vp with me, quich I acknowledge is a great testimonie both of your lordships trust and love, and I hop in God evir so to approve myself to be most willing and desyrous to deserue both.

These new subjects bound themselves not only to pay the allegiance of clansmen, but to give the \"caulp of Kenkynie,\"1 — the Celtic equivalent for the Heriot of feudal customs;2 to visit the chiefs house with \"sufficient presents \" twice in the year ; to serve in \" hosting and hunting ; \" and to be ready at all times \" to ride and go \" in their lord's affairs. THE RENTALS THE KENTALS AND ESTATE BOOKS, of which extracts are given, present the ESTATE BOOKS, characteristic marks of the country. Much of the rent is paid in oat meal and malt — the staples for food and drink. The tenants had little capital. The stock on the farms was \" steelbow,\" the property of the landlord, only the pro duce belonging to the tenant. The bow-house (cattle-house) was rated at so much \" kain \" or produce, in butter and cheese, in proportion to the cattle on that pasture. The money which seems to have been appropriated as part of the requisite stock for cultivating the bow-house farm, is called by an unex plained name of \" strenth-silver.\"3 We are led to think what became of those cattle during the long winter of the Midland Highlands ; but no information is afforded. Hay is not once named, and the natural produce of the glens can have been saved only in trifling quantities from the deer.4 Sheep were evidently in small numbers, and the \" clip of wool \" insignificant, compared with modern produce, probably from the want of winter food as well as from the deer occupying the outlying pastures, insecure, at any rate, for any valuable stock.5 These books show the attention to the rearing of horses that has been already noticed. 1 Caulp is the best \" aught \" due to the everywhere— -ferreum pecus — stdhline viehe chief, — or rather melius averium de con- — steelbow, all indicating permanency. questu. \"Kenkynie\" is chief or head of 4 The old Register of the Bishopric of kindred : — Moray has noted on a fly leaf. — \" Apud \" Syne lief I the best aught I bocht Spynie 4 Julij 1 580. — Not. that hay was Quod est Latinum propter Caupe wyn.\" And no doubt the coarse produce of To hede of kyn.\" — Duribar. the bottom of the glen has been saved for 2 10, p. 185, &c. winter use since ever man made property of 3 Perhaps it has some analogy to the re- animals. markable terms which designate this practice c Many entries will enable the present PREFACE. XXV THE HOUSEHOLD BOOKS show the usual provisions for the table. Oat meal and malt furnished the ordinary bread and the chief drink of the castle, where ale was distinguished as Ostler ale, household ale, and best ale. There was beef and mutton, fresh in summer, and for the rest of the year \"marts,\" killed and salted when fat on the pasture ; a small quantity of bacon ; salmon of Loch Tay, and Glenurchy Salmon. Loch Fyne herring was already appreciated,1 THK HOU8EHOI. BOOKS. occupants of those sheep pastures to compare the quantity of stock they maintained of old with the present, and also the produce. For instance, the clip of the brae of Balloch and Drumturk in 1603, was eight score six fleeces, and they weighed but six stones. 1 In the year 1590, the family spent their time between Balloch and Finlarg. The oat meal consumed, deducting a quantity used as \" horse corn,\" part of which here, as in England, was baked into loaves, was about 364 bolls. The malt, 207 bolls, (de ducting a small quantity of \" struck\" barley used in the kitchen.) They used 90 beeves, (\" marts,\" \" stirks,\" or \" fed oxen,\") more than two-thirds consumed fresh ; 20 swine ; 200 sheep ; 424 salmon, far the greater portion being from the Western rivers ; 15,000 herrings ; 30 dozen of \" hard fish ;\" 1805 \" heads \" of cheese, new and old, weighing 325 stone ; 49 stone of butter ; 26 dozen loaves of wheaten bread ; of wheat flour 3j bolls. The wine brought from Dundee was claret and white wine, old and new, in no very large quantities, though it might be dif ficult to fix the exact contents of the \" bar- rekins \" and \" rubbours.\" One kind, called \" vlet\" wine, may mean that brought home in flasks with oil at top, instead of corks. One barrel of English beer might be introduced to stimulate the native brewers to exertion by its rivalry. Of \" spices and sweet meats,\" we find only notice on one occasion, of small quantities of saffron, mace, ginger, pepper, \" raisins of cure,\" plumdamas, and one sugar loaf. No deer or game are entered this year ; nor any poultry, probably from some omis sion in the system of accounting, which was then only beginning. In some subsequent extracts made on account of their detailing the provisions for two marriages in the family, (1621-26,) these omissions are sup plied. The marriage of Elizabeth Campbell with the young laird of Drum, was on 4th December 1621. There was a considerable gathering of Dee- side gentry and Campbells, as well as \" comers and goers.\" Besides the staple commodities, we find on this occasion entered, twenty capons, forty poultry, thirty geese, twelve wild-geese, twelve \" meiss\" of brawn, six \" furtches\" (loth haunches ?) of red venison, eight roes, seven dozen of wildfowl, partridge and black game, three \"bireell fowls,\" (turkeys ?) of rabbits only eight ; and we find now a greater variety of sea fish and red herrings, and reisted (smoked ?) hams and mutton \" louings \" and salmon. At the wedding of \" Jeilliane Campbell\" with the Laird of Buckie, which took place on 18th June 1626, we find notice of trouts, wild- geese, (not easily to be had at that season,) three whole red deer and ten furches, (I fear XXVI PHEFACE. and when other fish got scarce there was the \" hard fish \" or stock fish, which still forms an article of Scotch economy even in Protestant families. Cheese, counted either by weight or in \"heads,\" was plentifully supplied by the \" bow-men.\" These books have a great additional interest from mentioning the guests visiting the family, and occasionally domestic occasions of more sumptuous housekeeping. It is matter of regret that room could not be found for more of these. INVENTORIES. The \" INVENTORIES OF PLENISSING,\" beginning at 1598, are valuable for the history of Scotch manners and civilisation. Every article is tempting, and if there were room, we could be well pleased to attend \" the Lady\" with her aide-de-camp, \" Magie Peter/' in their review of the contents of \" the great kist in the gallery wardrobe,\" and \"the Lady's kist standing in her own garderobe.\" One entry in the \" household garderobe \" of four wolf skins, might oblige us to turn aside, if there were not to be other opportunities of noticing the last of the great beasts of prey in Britain. But we must pass by the caddois and coverings, the plaids and curtains, the sheets, board cloths, seruiettes and towels ;l the carpets then not used for the floor, but for table-covers, gorgeous cushions, counter-cloths, stools, the table furniture and the array of kitchen implements required for the hospitality of Balloch. Neither must I dwell upon the arms and accoutrements which the porter had in charge. The artillery was not formidable, though, probably, more than required in Highland warfare. The hand guns, muskets, hagbuts of snap- work, of rowet work, or of lunt2 work, (match-locks,) prove the value in which they not in very good condition,) and seventeen roes; of claret, white wine, and \"Spanish wine,\" aquavitae, vinegar, &c. ; for spiceries, pepper and ginger, sugar, cloves, cannel, (cinnamon,} saffron. 1 Let me notice in passing, that the ulti mate fate of those linens was not, as now, the paper-maker's. When \" broken,\" they fell to \" the Nureis,\" or went to make wicks, either for candles of home manufacture, or lamps. There is no mention in these books of the purchase either of oil or candles. 2 Lunt-work or match-work, a common English as well as a Scotch word. I find my transcriber and I have pertinaciously read and printed it Unit. PBEFACE. XXvii were held, by the minuteness of the descriptions of their ornaments, whether stocked with Brissel, (Brazil wood,) or inlaid with bone or with pearl, or gilt pieces with the Laird's arms. There is the usual array of arms, from the primitive hand-bow and its \" bag of arrows,\" to horseman's harness with steel bonnets, plate gloves, corsletts, murrions of proof, steel targes, and two-handed swords. None of the names of arms seem to require explanation. There are Jedburgh staffs, and Lochaber axes, but there is nothing of \"the ancient High land broadsword.\" Andrea Ferrara's name is not found. A \" running spear\" seems to be a tilting spear, as a \" wasp spear \" undoubtedly was no weapon of mortal war, but a salmon spear or \" leister.\" Among the porter's gear at Fin- larg, after a dire enumeration of prison furniture, great iron fetters, and long chains with their shackles, we find one name that suggests even more odious associations. The four \" Glaslawis chargeit with four schaikhills,\" seem to have been instruments of torture.1 The \" heading axe,\" which occurs more than once, and which seemed at one time to be the natural fate of the whole race of McGregor, is still to be seen in the Hall at Taymouth. The most curious, as well as the most careful and formal of these inven tories, is the one made up in 1640, when Sir Colin and his sons, a few months before his death, agreed to set aside certain articles as heir-looms. The jewels — the target of enamelled gold, set with three diamonds, four topazes or jacinths, a ruby, and a sapphire — the gift of King James V. ; the round jewel of gold, set with twenty-nine diamonds and four great rubies, and the diamond ring, both given to the gallant Sir Duncan by Queen Anne of Denmark ; even the fair silver brooch, set with precious stones, are, I fear, all gone. It is some thing if the talisman of the Knight of Rhodes is preserved. The Plate is very sumptuous for the time. There were not many houses in Scotland in 1640 which could set on the table twelve plates, twelve trenchers, and twelve \" sasers\" of silver. But the chief array for the \" buffet\" was in great \" chargers,\" \" basons,\" 1 The indictment of Patrick, Earl of Ork- inusitatce crudelitatis tormento a se invento ney, (1606,) sets forth, among other con- vulgo lie CASCHELAWES sevissime et prodi- tempts of the Royal authority, that he torie subjecit. — Act.

The furni ture consisted of many gorgeous beds of silk and velvet, embroidered or plain, Arras and common hangings, velvet cushions for the kirk, and cushions of Turkey work, damask board-cloths, Dornik serviettes, and others of plainer sort. Carpets for the table, dishes of pewter, a \" great acavitee pot,\" (a still,) kitchen furniture, twenty-four pictures of Kings and Queens, and thirty-four of lairds and ladies of Glenurquhay and other noblemen ; the great \" Genealogy board,\" (painted by Jamesone) ; with clocks, organs in the chapel of Finlarg, and a harpsicord at Balloch. The deed also entailed two charter-chests, with iron bands (not their contents !); \" Captain Gordon's sword,\" which no doubt had its history ; and a considerable quantity of cattle and sheep. The acts and proceedings of the Baron Courts, collected in 1621, will be found to present a fair view of the rural economy of the district. There are regulations for muirburn, summer pasture, peat-cutting, mills, smithies, and ale-houses ; laws against poaching on moor and river ; a rule that smacks of superstition, against cutting briars \" but in the waxing of the moon.\" Swine are proscribed ; no quarter is given to rooks, hooded crows, and magpies. The Laird shows his determination to have trees about his tenants' houses by nume rous regulations ; and tenants are bound, under high penalties, to give their cottars the comforts of fuel and kail-yards, \" with corns conform.\" Agriculture is stimulated by rules for sowing \"uncouth\" oats, or seed better than the common black oat of the Highlands ; for collecting of \" middens ;\" even for irrigating — \" drawing water through the land\" — long before the grand discovery of drain ing had been made. To avoid the devastation of Highland \" speats,\" the green sward on the banks of rivers and burns is not to be broken. To save a dif- 1 The \" little lang-shanked cups for aqua- of later times, when the\"quaich\" had no vitse \" point to a different fashion from that shank. PREFACE. XXIX ferent devastation, every tenant was obliged to make yearly four \" croscats of iron \" (probably some sort of dog-spear) for slaying of the wolf. That great enemy of the shepherd was not finally extirpated till the end of the century. A few extracts are given from the records of the Baron Court, rather for the sake of shewing its form and jurisdiction than for any importance of the cases, civil or criminal. The legal antiquary will find relics of some antique law, which had disappeared long ago in lowland courts. Donald Taillour, in Morinch, having fallen in suspicion of stealing ten double angels and forty marks of silver, the Assize ordained him to cleanse himself thereof by the oaths of six persons out of twelve whom they would choose, or four persons of eight ; and he accordingly cleansed himself by his compurgators, as the ancient law demanded, and went free.1 In a court held at Killin, it was ordered that no \" blocker \" or dealer buy cattle from strangers, nor even from the neighbours dwelling between the ford of Lyon and Tyndrum, without sufficient \" caution of burgh and hamer.\" This is the \" borch of hamehald\" required by the statute of William the Lion, and recognised in several of our older laws.2 There are some symptoms of starvation in Breadalbane, when Patrick M'Woyllen and the Widow M'Ewin are convicted of bleeding the laird's cattle, and John M'Inteir for letting M'Keissik's bairns die for hunger.3 The gear did not prosper with Donald Taillour in Morinch, (the same who was suspected for the double angels,) and he accused his neighbour N'Vane of bewitching him. She brought a pock of earth from Tomnayngell (the name sounds of spirits) to his house ; since which, \" his gear has not ' luckit ' with him, and his corns grow not.\" The judge, with sense beyond the age, acquitted the woman at this time, but forbade the use of the pock of earth, \" seeing it inclines to no good, but to an evil custom.\"4 1 P. 373. — Acquitting or \"cleansing \" by voce BORCH — \" It is common in the High- compurgators was the ancient law of all the lands to exact caution when one buys cattle Northern nations ; witnesses comparatively from a person he does not know, and they a modern convenience.

XXX PREFACE. MUSTER ROLLS. FEU-CHARTERS AND TACKS. There are many regulations and proceedings shewing the creeping in of that habit which has become our national reproach. Even so early as these entries, whisky, as well as ale, was too freely used ; and, among other attempts to abate the nuisance, a curious law inflicts a penalty and disgraceful punish ment for wives drinking in \" brewsters' \" houses without the company of their husbands.1 It has been doubted how old the practice of rod-fishing is. On 6th December 1632, his father becomes caution for Duncan Campbell in Creit- garrow, that he shall not burn a blaze, shoot a waspe, nor put out a wand on the water of Tay.2 Of the MUSTER BOLLS here printed, it may be sufficient to observe that they have all apparently been made to satisfy some requisition, and seem intended to convey no more information than was absolutely required. The articles concluded by the barons and gentlemen of Argyll in 1638, on the eve of the great struggle, shew a forethought, a unity of purpose, and a determination to risk all for the cause, very unusual among our countrymen. Out of some huge volumes in which the Lairds of Glenurchy registered the charters and leases granted to their vassals and tenants, a few have been selected for illustrating incidental points of character or custom. The first is a lease granted for keeping the Castle of Kilchurn, and shows the arrangement of its seneschal and his small garrison. Before that time (1550) it had ceased to be the chief or even the usual dwelling of the family. The second, a feu- charter, brings us acquainted with a race of hereditary \"jongleurs,\" \" rhymers,\" or \" bards,\" holding their land by service in their craft.3 Two leases here given 1 28, p. 359. 2 P. 389.— The \"blazing\" the water, or killing salmon when drawn by the light of fires within sight and reach, is still too well known in the upper Highlands. A \" waspe \" spear is the same as the \"leister\" of the border Highlands. The wand or rod-fishing was, I hope, with fly. 3 Some one more versed in Highland genealogies may tell us whether the Ewen who received this charter, was the origin of the M'Ewens who were hereditary Seanachies. The current popular history of the Camp bells professes to be founded upon \" the genealogical tree done by Niel M'Ewen, as he received the same from Eachern and PUEFACE. XXXI are the only transactions I have met with among these papers, touching the management and produce of the deer forest.1 The fifth charter was chosen from its giving a Churchman's view of the police of the country, — \" Hibernica et rapinosa regio ubi incolae vix terras laborare aut habitare ausint propter fre- quentes furum et latronum incursiones qui in speluncis illic latitant.\" A lease of Ilan Puttychan gives liberty to set six small nets in the loch, but without slaying salmon or red fish ; and Donald M'Kerres has a lease of a half-merk land of Port Loch Tay, with steelbow and \" bouage \" according to custom, and a right to set three small nets upon the loch. Hew Hay and Cristiane Stennes served the ferry coble of the Cagell, and undertook to keep an honest hostelry at the coble croft, with sufficient ale and bread and other furnishing at all times in readines to serve the country, with greater provision for courts, con ventions, or strangers. The Laird undertook to build them a hall and lofted chamber, with chimneys, doors and windows water tight, meet and convenient for such hospitality ; and also to put down rival hostellers and brewsters between Stroncombrie and Wood of Letterellane on the north side of the loch, and between Cronaltane and Ardrananycht in Ardtollonycht on the south ; and promised certain impracticable privileges of pre-emption of victuals.2 The eighth deed is a specimen of an obligation of a tenant instead of rent to enter into deadly feud with the Clan Gregor, and to make slaughter upon them privily and openly. The removing of the tenants of Ardcandknocquhane affords minute information of the \" plenishing \" of tenants' houses in Breadalbane. The reddendo of the tenth charter is curious, — besides £10 Scots and forty bolls of oatmeal, the vassal was to pay a gallon of sufficient aquavitae, (the manufacture of his own still without doubt,) optimum chlamidem coloratam, which is translated \" ane fyne hewed brakane,\" and a sufficient \" Cuddeich,\" which, I believe, means a present given in token of vassalage. Artt M'Ewens, his father and grandfather, bable that the hitherto varying patronymic, as they had the same from their predecessors, should be fixed with reference to the first of who for many years were employed to make the race who obtained a feudal title to his up and keep such records.\" The \" Arnold us land. filius Eugenii \" of this charter, may be \" Artt * 3, p. 409 ; 17, p. 426.

Three leases are granted to craftsmen, the builder of the Laird's park dikes ; the smith of the castle — who took his name from his calling, Patrick Gow ; and thirdly, to Andro Kippen the gardener of Balloch, whose contract to entertain the garden and its knots, borders and alleys, orchard and kaleyard, and to rear all sorts of flowers, herbs and strawberries, as well as plums, cherries, geans, apples and pears, — presents to the imagination a curious contrast with the present appearance of the lawn on which the castle stands — the very site where Kippen must have \"led his fulzie,\" and collected his \"middens\" before the peat-house door.1 Some of the deeds are given to show the care of the stud of brood mares in Glenlochy, which, like the other pasture farms, is here managed on steel- bow ;2 and in one, a tenant on Loch Fyne pays a part of his rent in herrings, and furnishes the Earl's family with white fish and shell fish during their residence at Castle Kilchurn.3 Black John Crerare, a name long after associated with Highland sport, has a lease in 1663 of the merk land of Pitmakie and the sheeling of Corrie- goir, his service being to be fowler to the Laird, and to go to the hills with a sufficient lying dog and fowling nets, and kill wild-fowl and moor-fowl of all kinds, and to train up a fowling dog for the use of the Laird.4 LETTERS. The last of these selections for the antiquities of Highland life, are a few letters chosen from a vast quantity at Taymouth. I have avoided all which bear on historical and public events, as beyond the scope of this collection. Even the documents touching the immortal feud with the unfortunate Clan Gregor, I have put aside.5 It is sufficient to point to the Taymouth charter-room, 1 14, p. 24.

' ' PREFACE. XXX111 as full of the genuine materials of Scotch history from the Reformation to the Revolution. The first letter printed is a characteristic exhortation and encouragement by the Laird to the keeper of his Castle of Glenurchy who had lost his geir by his service. There are two letters concerning supplies of venison and game to the Court, the first on occasion of the christening of Prince Henry, the second when Charles I. was about to visit Scotland in 1G33. One letter speaks of terriers and fox-hunting as affording sport in Scotland in 1631. Another is printed only as giving a notice of Capercailzie in 1651, which soon after disappeared from Scotland, until restored in the present generation to the woods of Breadalbane. Several letters here given, and .others omitted, have reference to the famous white hind of Corrichiba, which King James VI. greatly desired to secure, and sent his foresters to attempt it. Mr. Bowie only informs us that \" the said Englishmen saw the hind in Corrichiba on 22 February 1622.\" The corres pondence shows that they failed in their enterprise, and also that they spoke highly of the hospitality of the country. It is not from themselves we learn that the Highland drink was too potent for the Southron. Before leaving the subject of game and deer, I may mention an early notice of the venison of Breadalbane. The account of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland for August 1506, has the following entry : — \" Item, payit to the Comptrollair for iiij barrellis to send to Sir Duncane Campbell to salt venisone in, to send in Spanyee, . . . . ix s. \" Item, for carying of the samyn to Lochtay, .... viij s.\" It is plain that the Catholic King had heard of Breadalbane venison, and, despairing to taste it as it should be eaten, was content to have it salted ! The correspondence about fir seed sent to Lord Lauderdale and the Marchioness of Hamilton, shows an early attention to planting of that kind. The letter of the Marchioness, here printed, and others of her ladyship at Taymouth, are characteristic memorials of that remarkable woman, and serve well to illustrate Jameson's curious picture of her. The last letter of the collection is from Master William Bowie, the inditer of the Black Book, who here figures as the instructor of John and Duncan, XXXIV PREFACE. the sons of Robert Campbell of Glenfalloch, afterwards Sir Robert of Glenurchy.1 One word of omissions before closing this Preface, already unreasonably long. A collection from a charter-room seems incomplete without the charters ; and those at Taymouth, since 1432, would illustrate not only the possessions of the family, but the older tenures of the whole neighbourhood. But a tolerable selection of these would also require more room than could be afforded here. Therefore, with many masses of letters of correspondence, (a large part of the latter transcribed,) these have been for the present wholly set aside. Among the charters of lands, were found some documents of a less com mon character, and affecting less substantial rights, — viz., the privileges attached to the custody of a certain relic of St. Fillan. Fillan, the son of Kentigerna, was of old reverence in the valleys of Breadalbane, and his mona stery in Glendochart was still of such consequence in the time of William the Lion, that the Abbot, whether then a churchman or secularised,2 was named among the magnates of power to support the operation of a particular law 1 Some extracts from Master Bowie's For making of Jhone his cott of the sam account may be allowed : — fma, VJ 8* • ^ c i f For PaPir to thame, • • • .

XXXV beyond the reach of common legal process.1 It was a century later that a relic of St. Fillan is said (by Boece) to have been the subject of a notable miracle, which Bruce turned to account for encouraging his soldiers at Bannockburn.2 The story may be received as evidence of the reverence paid to St. Fillan in the historian's time. That it continued afterwards, we learn from the following documents, though, I fear, they shew that his relics were degraded to the purpose of tracing stolen goods. The particular one which forms the subject of these instruments, the Coygerach, was known within the present generation in the hands of the family of Jore or Dewar, who so early vindicated its posses sion. It is the head of a staff or crozier of a Bishop or mitred Abbot, of silver gilt, elaborately and elegantly ornamented with a sort of diapered chasing. It is described and figured in the Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Vol. III., p. 290; and in Dr. Wilson's Archaeology of Scotland, p. G64.\" Two of these documents have been printed before,4 but from imperfect and faulty copies. They are now given from the originals :— I.

The Coygerach of St. Fillan was long afterwards known in the High lands of Perthshire. The last of these deeds was registered as a probative writ at Edinburgh, 1st November 1734 ; and M. Latocnaye, who made a tour in Britain in 1795, gives this notice of the Relic, — \" Ayant vu 1'annonce d'une fameuse relique, en la possession d'un paysan aux environs, nous avons demande a la voir. Elle ressemble assez au haut bout d'une crosse d'e'veque, et est d'argent dore*. Le bon homme qui nous 1'a montre, et qui gagne quelque pen d'argent avec elle, vraisemblablement pour augmenter notre int«5ret, nous a dit tres serieusement, que quand les bestiaux etaient enrages, il suffisait de leur faire boire de 1'eau passe\"e par 1'interieur de sa relique ; 1'eau bouillone sur le champ quand le remede ne veut pas operer, (d'ou on pourrait conclure qu'il opere souvent,) et que 1'on veiiait de plus de cent milles chercher de son eau. . . Quoiqu'il en soit, j'ai e\"te* charme\" de trouver une relique parmi les Presbyteriens.\"1 The Relic, it is believed, has been for some years in Canada, but whether it retains its virtues in the New World is unknown. Such are the materials which a Highland charter-room has afforded for illustrating some centuries of Highland life. The volume will not be slighted Promenade autcur de la Grande Bretagne, par un Officier Fra^ais Emigre, p. 294. Edinb. 1795. XXXV111 PREFACE. as a mere collection of antiquarian curiosities, if it is found to throw light on the state of property and the institutions of an interesting district, and to ex hibit early forms of life and progressive changes of manners in its pastoral people. While there is enough of romance in the glimpses here opened of the rough life of \" the good old time/' it is pleasant to think that while much is changed, every change has been for the better. The country, which these papers show us in so wild a state of lawless insecurity, has for the last two centuries steadily improved ; and the progress has not been more marked in the face of the country than in the moral and physical condition of the people, and their social happiness. 0.
