LONDON : A. H. BAILY, AKD Company, 85, Cornhill. 1854 asrsmD]Di(&3&Dsr The object of political economy is to explain, and prove how labor should be directed so as to produce , in the shortest space of time, and with the least waste of materials, the greatest quantity of those articles which man requires^ or makes use of, either as necessities, comforts or luxuries ; and which, also, constitute the wealth of nations^ This science is, therefore^ that of population, agriculture, manu- factures, commerce, wealth, and power. Properly understood, it should form the prevailing ground work for the conduct of all good OOVERNMBNTS. It has however long appeared to me, and all my inquiries in Eu- rope, and in America, with the experience of mankind, in the 1 2 INTRODLCTION. application of labor to productive purposes, aD, coufinn the con- elusion, that the greatest disadvantage in the study of political eco- nomy, and that which has falsified many of the theories of the ablest men who have devoted their time to the subject, is, the apparently insurmountable difficulty of illustrating this most interesting science by incontrovertible facts. The science of statistics^ or, in other words, the classification of factSj has for its object to exhibit, distinctly, the natural and arti- ficial resources of nations, including the geographical position, phy- sical aspect area, civil and natural divisions of countries ; population ; domestic animals; the produce ofmines, of agriculture^ of forests, of manufactures 9 and of fisheries; also, the public and private buildings; factories; machinery and implements used in agriculture, in trades, in war, and in navigation ; military and naval farces; sea ports; com- mercial shipping ; colonies; roads, 'bridges, canals, and railways; revenue; expenditure; banks; companies or societies of whatever kind; public and private institutions; occupations of the people; religious denominations; expence of religious instruction; expence of public and private education; expence of the government; and whatever else relates to the arrangement of things in order to elucidate the actual condition i?/* nations. The science of statistics is, therefore, that of truth. — Whatever is not an incontrovertible statement, according to the best autho- rity, cannot strictly belong to it : consequently this science, alone, can maintain or disprove the theories of political economists It may lay us open to the wproach of hardihood if we say that all writers on political economy have exaggerated. As far, however, as their having advanced principles which experience has not war- ranted, or which facts have since contradicted, they all are, in a greater or lesser degree, liable to the chaise of exaggeration. Few will deny that even Adam Smith, the ablest^ and father, of them all, has advanced some doctrines which the experience of the last fifty years has falsified. To the otherwise invaluable works of Aicardo, Macculloch, and Mill^ the same charge applies with equal truth, hi the admirable writings of M. Say we also discover theo- ries, which subsequent inquiry has disproved. To the late M. Malte-Brun we owe much ; and M. Balbi of Venice, tNTROIXlCTION. 3 but by fame mare properly of Fraoee^ has perhaps devoted more care to tlie study of statistics thaa any man living^. His statements I have found wonderfully accurate. The tables of M. Cesar Moreau, and the statements of many French vnriters, to whom I have to ac^ knowledge many obligations, are drawn up widi great care. Th^ comparatiye statistical tables of the trade, manufactures, and fisheries, of France; and of the cmnmerce between that country and England, prepared with extraordinary industry by Doctor Bowring, wiH be found, when they appear, probably the best authenticated, and best arranged official statements hitherto pu- blished. The French have directed their attention, for some years, probably more to statistical research than any other nation. Scotland, Prussia, and the Germau states may, perhaps, be ad- mited as exceptions. The Germans, who are more imaginative than most writers on political economy, are not more sound ; yet, whenever they have abandoned the pursuit of fancy^ and have halted to gather feets ; we find their statements wonderfully accurate* This is paHicn^ larly the case with the slaiUtuianB of Prussia. lb no country are the official returns more clearly arranged, or drawtn up with so much care. la respect to Russia^ we are notable to discover, that either sta^ tistics or political economy have obtained much footing, at least not so for as to be given officially to the public* — We owe all the information we possess, relative, to that Empire, to a few scientific Russians, to Foreigners^ particularly, to several learned Poles. To the functionaries of the Russian government, or to the learned institutions of that empire, we have very little statistical informa- tion to acknowledge. All accounts respecting its population, and the productions of its industry, must, therefore be considered, if a contrary authority be not given, only as estimates : unless it be the official returns of the naval and military forces, and the imports and exports, which may, with tolerable correctness, be ascertained from the official returns of other countries. I have however been enabled to collect sufficient data, to show, that no other European Nation, is, in reality, so little known^ nor any whose power has been to greatly exaggerated. 4 INTRODUCTION. la Sweden, Nojrway, and Denmark, we find general statements, relative to men and things, apparently drawn up with care and ac- curacy. Their ideas of political, economy, particularly in matters of finance, are in imitation of England and Holland. In the latter* countrjr the people, in theory, but not always in pratice, may be considered as having adopted the work of Adam Smith for their text book. The Dutch official returns are made up annually, it is said, with correctness, and deposited in their respective bureaux, at the Hague. It has for some time been difficult for foreigners to obtain copies or abstracts of them. I found this the case last au- tumn, when I visited every province, and every town of conse- quence, in Holland, with a view to statistical research. I have, however, pbtained the Dutch official returns. Spain, Portugal, and the Italian states (i), seem, to leave sta- tistics and political economy to other nations; while they, them- selves, blunder ^n admidst the misery or bliss of uncertainty. In respect to Africa, if we except Egypt, under its present pacha; and the English and other Foreign colonies^ the whole of this quarter of the globe may be 'considered as in the most deplorable, and, it would seem irretrievable barbarism. Of the statistics of Asia, particularly of China, we know very little that we can depend upon; and that little we glean in frag- ments from the notes of travellers. Neither will statistics gain much, among the other nations of Asia, ( including Japan), from their public records or private collections. — As far as we know, such statements, can scarcely be said to exist, — certainly not in a condition to be implicitly depended upon, by Europeans. On the continent of America, the dominant population being of European race, are, in the science of facts, guided partly by the practice of Europe, and partly by local circumstances. In the British colonies of North America and the West Indies, the official returns are prepared much in the same manner as in England. The public returns of the population, territory, revenue, and commerce of the United States of America appear as correct as those (1} We mibt bowevrr except man) lulinns, •nil tome Spaniards and Portugocsr,— men of science uid ibU INTRODUCTION. 5 of any nation. This extraordinary republic has not, however, produced any great writer, if we except Franklin, on political economy^ nor very eminent statisticians; but many of the reports to congress, particularly those on finance and commerce, have been drawn up by very able men (\\). The vast extent of fertile territory, comprised within the boun- daries of the United States, and yielding, in great plenty, all the ne- cessaries of life^ and abundant raw materials of almost every useful kind, treV/ enable the Americans to blunder for a much longer period, and to feel the baneful effects oflegislating on anti-commer- cial principles, with proportionably less disadvantage than nations which possess capital^ and labor, relatively greater than the field openfoT their profitable investment and application. In respect to the statistics of the British Empire, we have no reason to complain of the want, or non-publicity of official returns ; but the difficulty in regard to arrangement is great; and the labor of wading through the vast mass of parliamentary documents, amongst which British statistics are diffused, is so tedious and dis- couraging^ that few men can, or will, devote their time to the fatiguing task. My object has been to exhibit, in this work, the resources and sta- tistics of all nations, as most accurately known, and in a compara- tive view. The statements are accompanied by the authorities on which they are given ; and the arrangement, I have endeavoured to execute, so as to render easy and interesting, the study of a science, little understood although so eminently important. The comparative details of the resources, population, superficies, and government, revenues etc. of the different nations of the earth, do not follow the usual geographical arrangement^ as all countries, subject to the same government, are included under one ge- neral head; and those nations considered most powerful, after England and France, follow in that order ; for instance the British Empire includes all the possessions of England in America, Africa, Asia J and Australia; and the Statistics of the United States follow, in all comparative views, those of France, and precede those of M) Se« theae of C«nib«rleng, Galitin, Van Boren, elc. 6 INTRODUCTION. Russia, as it will appear, differently from the common opinion, even of statesmen that the moral and physical power and resources of the United States of America is, relatively speaking, greatly superior to those of Russia. These comparative statements are of great importance, to those who govern a nation, or a people; and one of the most interesting results of statistical knowledge, is, its elucidation of the influence of moral over physical power : ^— for example, in all British India, the European population is scarcely more than 66,000 ; while the INatives exceed 96 millions ; or, about 1 ,4oo for each European The climate of India is congenial to the Na- tives, while it is so oppressive to, and so much, enervates Europeans^ that the latter are carried about in palanquins by the former. Hence must appear the very feeble moral energy of the Natives, or, at least their want of will and judgment, to combine and di- rect their physical strength, in comparison with the mental power and ability of the Europeans who rule over them« In respect to the classification of general statistics, under respective divisional heads, I have followed the plan of arranging those statements which are most closely dependent on each other, and which more distinctly and briefly illustrate the resources and power of Nations, rather than the plan of adhering strictly to what belongs to the respective classes of Moral, Polttigai., Medical, Geographical, and Economical Statistics. For example, the subject of population appertains, no doubt, to medical statistics , but in illustrating the comparative resources of Nations , in respect to territory and power, 1 found it necessary to exhibit in a tabular form, not only the population, but those ele- ments of power which belong strictly speaking to Geographical and Economical Statistics : It will however be seen that they could not be separated without defeating two chief objects of statistical science, — viz perspicuity and brevity. ^tAtii^ticd inf titie ^Uffi* HABITABLE 9URVACE and POPULATION oF the EARTH, l833.

COMPARATIVE VIEW of the NATURAL RESOURCES AND STATISTICS OF EUROPE- Europe comprehends all the couotries North of the Mediterra- nean to the Frozen Ocean ; and from the Atlantic, East, to the con- fines of Asia,bounded by the Black Sea, and the great Uralian chain of mountains. The Eastern boundary is, however, excepting at the Black Sea and Dardanelles, very indistinctly defined ; nor is this of much consequence, so long as the Ottoman and Russian Empires comprise the European and Asiatic countries contiguous to each other. No part of the Continent of Europe lies south of 53** north lati- tude. So that the whole is situated within the temperate and Frozen Zones. Although the soil of Europe, strictly speaking, does not yield the same productions, nor its mines the precious metals and stones in like abundance, as those of the tropics ; yet the for- mer afibrds, in the greatest plenty, all that is necessary for the use of man; and all the material elements which are required to render him wealthy, intelligent and powerful. Europe has oil^ wine, honey, milk, and com ; — nearly all the fruits, and most vegetables; — timber trees, the most durable and useful ; — silk, wool, hemp and flax ; — animals the best adapted for the use and convenience of man; — mines of iron^ of coaly and salt; of tin, copper, lead, silver, etc.; (the three first are of more conse- quence to the arts and civilization, than all the others that the bowels of the earth contain) ; — sea coasts, abounding with har- bors and fish; and rivers, lakes, and inlets of the sea, all of the utmost consequence, whether regarded as channels of civilization, intelligence, ortrade. Dye stuffs, sugar and cotton, arc the only, arti- cles of great importance that Europe requires from the other quar- ters of the globe. Wealth, however, being augmented by the mul- tiplication and interchanging of commodities, it is desirable that the wants and luxuries of the respective portions of the earth should be supplied; and the manufactures of Europe, and the commerce of Europeans with other nations, have, inconsequence, and from superior natural resources, in respect to productive power, and also from the influence of moral circumstances, for a long period exceeded, and for some time, have far surpassed the fabrics and the traffic of all the other quarters of the globe.

Ambrica, extendiog from 54^ — South latitude to the frozeu reguNM of the North, possesses every climate and affords every mi- neral and vegetable production under heaven. Most v^Od animafe abound in the forests; and most kinds of fishes swarm around the coasts^ and in the rivers, and lokes.. — In respect to great navigable rivers; lakes; numerous harbors; the useful minerals, as coal, iron, and salt; fisheries, and perhaps in the mor? useful viroods» North Anfeerica has certainly pre*«minence over South America. In mines, harbors, fisheries and forests , the farmer very much resembles Europe. South America again yields the tropical productions; the indi- g08> sugars, coffee; the spices; the ornamental woods; and the precious metals and stones, in greater abundance than North America; — while both afford the greatest natural advantages for the culture of cofn; of all kinds of culinary vegetables; of fruits, cotton, rice, tobacco, etc. ; and for rearing all domestic animals. In respect to population, the aboriginal inhabitants from Pata- gonia, to Hudson Bay, with the exception only of the Exquimaux, are evidently the same, prd»ably Mongolian or Tatar^ race* AU have the olive skin; sleek black hair on the head; little or no hair on other parts of the body; thin lips; teeth even, very white, and seldom liable to decay; small hands and feet; high cheek bones; small black quick eyes; little disposition to laugh, or« to grow corpulent. Prom the time that Europeans first trod the soil of the western world, the aborigines have been rapidly melting away from their presence. Numerous tribes have altogether disappeared : — they could not stand up against the terrible ravages of ardent spirits, gunpowder, small pox and other diseases, introduced among them from the civilized world. In place of being taught the simple elements of industrious life, civilization was tried to be forced upon the Indians, by the mysterious dogmas of religion; and by the barter of fire arms, gunpowder, brandy and small pox, — for gold, silver, and fine furs. In South America vrith the exception of the efforts of the Jesuits in Paraguay all atempts at civilization have failed. In South America and in Cuba the enslaving and chaining them to labor in the mines, and on plantations, by the Spaniards, until they wore them out, and until it was found, at RESOURCES AND POPULATION of AMERICA. i5 length, more profitable to contract for cargos of Africans, than to continue the practice of forcing the Indians to labor, was ano- ther powerful cause of destruction, which carried off at least a million of the aborigines of America. In North America they were not enslaved; but the passion for gain, particularly in acquiring possession of territory, and the fur trade, introduced diseases, and materials, which rapidly destroyed the natives. Some experiments are in the course of trial, in Upper Canada, for civilizing the aborigines which it is hoped may be at- tended with sucoess. An experiment, that of removing them beyond the Mississipi, giving them useful instruction, and making them a remuneration for lands, has lately been put in practice by the goverment of the United States; and if this desirable object succeeds, it may extend civilization to the still numerous tribes west of the Missouri and the great lakes of Canada. The American Indian is vigilant, quick in perception, distrust- ful; taciturn, yet eloquent when he speaks; solemn, yet graceful; revengeful, yet possessing the most absolute control over all his passions. In appearance, he is, the stately dignified gentleman, not the grovelling savage, of nature. The NON-ABORIGINAL population of America consists of European races; chiefly British^ French, Spaniards and Portuguese; some Dutch, Danes, Swedes, Germans, and a few Italians, Prussians and Russians. The latter chiefly on the Northwest coast, where they have established important trading posts. With the exception of the United States, British America, and the West Indies, all statements relative to the inhabitants, either of European, or aboriginal race, can only be considered as vague estimates: — the still unsettled governments, of the newly Indepen- dent States, not having enabled us to procure authentic returns : those relative to Chili are the most to be depended on ; and the following table is drawn up according to the most approved data. iG STATISTICAL VIEW STATEMENT exhibiting the AREA, POPULATION, REVENUE, STATES.

The productioos of Africa are undoubtedly of great Talue, and the soil in many parts remarkably fertile^ although a greater por- tion of the vast surface of this quarter is occupied by sandy deserts, than, as far as we know^ that of all the other regions of the world. Civilization is also more limited; and with the exception of Egj'pt and the European settlements, Africa is in a most deplorable state of barbarism. The difficulties to be surmounted in respect to climate, and internal communications, are so formidable, that nearly all European travellers have been sacrificed, to their enter- prizing spirit, in attempting to traverse this inhospitable, barbarous and vast country. — Much was expected from the late expedition by Steam under Lander. — He, too, has been murdered by the Natives ; yet Steam in all probability will form the agent that is to open an intercourse between the interior of Africa, and the civilized world.

The vast breadth of Continent, unbroken by the sea, lakes or great navigable streams ; the immense tracts of sandy deserts ; the scarcity of fresh water; the great aridity and unsalubrity of its tropical climate; and the peculiar moral, and physical, organiza- tion of most of its inhabitants, are, and must long continue for- midable obstacles to its general civilization. Egypt, it is true, was the cradle of the arts and sciences The Nile fertilized the country, and formed a great vital artery of intelli- gence, communication, and carriage. Carthage was also a flou- rishing state. Both sunk : the first appears now to be reviving ; — whether the second will, or not, by the extension of French colo- nization, must depend on judicious management. Morocco, and the states of Barbary, can scarcely be considered more, than nations of Marauders on sea, and land. — ^Yet these coun- tries have fertile soils, and valuable mines of iron, copper, salt, anti- mony, etc. The forests, and deserts, abound with ferocious animals, and also with camels and ostriches. — The soil of the Moorish states i8 RESOURCES AND POPULATION although most slovenly cultivated, yields, excelleut wheat, barley oatSy melons, hemp, fruits, and vegetables, in plenty. The olive, the cH*ange, the fig, the ahnond, the date, the vine and the cotton tree, thrive in perfection. Horses, asses, horned cattle, goats and sheep also thrive, — the wool of the latter is of little use. In tropical Africa, the teeth of the elephant, gold dust, palm oil, and spices are the objects of commerce; yet the soil yields rice, maize, bandanas, plaintains, oranges, lemons, indigo, cotton, tobacco, sugar cane, and in fact all tropical productions. In the forests are tigers, lions, hyenas, buffalos, rhinoceros. COMPARATIVE VIEW STATES AND TITLES. SlJKFACE If* GEOGB. 8Q. MILES. POPL'LATlOfi. POP. to. SQ, MILE.

The Islands in the Pacific* and South-Eastern Indian Ocean, are many of them so vast in extent, that they approach in importance to one of the foregoing great divisions of the Globe; and, as such, have been ranked by Geographers, under the name of Australia by the English, and that of Ogeanie by the French. In respect to civilization, and improvement, this division of the world is still in comparative infancy. But the very great natural advantages of Nevir Holland, and Van Diemens land, in regard to climate, soil, natural, and agricultural productions, and fisheries; and the rapid progress of the English settlements in those Islands, will no doubt secure the foundation of a mighty European Empire in Australia. A circumstance not the least curious in which, will be the perpetuity of the literature, and language, of England, in regions so far distant from each other as North America, and Oceanica. The tropical Islands of Australia possess great natural resources; and the interchanging of the productions of which, for those of the temperate latitudes, will alone provide the elements of profitable commerce. To avoid recapitulation, see hereafter the respective re- sources of each Island, State, or Colony. STATISTICAL VIEW op AUSTRALIA o& OGEANICA. I STATES. Geogrc'l square miles. PopaUtion.

NATURAL RESOURCES of the BRITISH EMPIRE. • The GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION of a couiitry has always been admitted as of the first importance, in regard to its prosperity and power. A nation highly favored, in its situation on the earth's surface; that is, in its facility of communication by Sca^ Rivers^ and Passes^ with other countries ; and with natural defences such as Seas, lU- Ters, and Mountains ; and having also an average soil and climate, is, naturally, prepared to become more powerful than a country of greater extent, but proportionably less favorable position. FRANCE, for instance, occupies no more than, 2i5,ooo square miles of the earth's surface. Russia, exclusive of her possessions in America, occupies 7,2649365 square miles, or the superficies of 34 kingdoms equally large as France. . Great Britain and Ireland occupy little more than half the sur- face of France, and little more than one third the surface ol land adapted for agricultural purposes that the latter does. France has also a more highly favored climate, and a soil generally susceptible of profitable cultivation, at less expence. The United Kingdom, has a much greater extent of sea coasts and more numerous, and better harbors than France. The harbours of Portsmouth, Ply- mouth, and Cork ; — those of the west of Ireland, and Scotland, with the Orkneys, Cromarty and Leith roads, give decided advan- tages, in all maritime afiairs, to the British over the other nations of Europe. France, again, in military position, is as eminently superior. France has abundant mines of coal and of iron. The quality of the former is often exceUent, — the latter generally good; but not found intentratified; and both are inconveniently situated for the purposes of transport, and general, cheap, use. France has mineral salt in abundance, but not so well situated for com- mercial purposes as that of England. England has abundant mines of goal and iron, inier$tratified. 22 NATURAL RESOL'RCES of and happily situated for all purposes oF manufactures, commerce and navigation ; also copper, lead and salt in abundance. — Ail in the most convenient positions for cheap, use and transport. The real source of the wealth of England is in her minerals. Wanting these, she never would, notwithstanding her favorable natural position, have attained to her magnificent ascendency, maintained by her industry and wealth, among the nations of Eu- rope. In their home dominions, England and France maybe considered, in respect to the elements of natural power, nearly equal. The greater extent of territory ; the superiority of the climate and the larger proportion of cultivable soil of the former, being counter- balanced, by the minerals; the more numerous, or more com- manding and safe harbors ; the greater extent of coast; and more advantageously situated maritime position^ of the former. Spain occupies a surface, nearly one-half greater than all the British Isles, with a soil capable^ according to all accounts, of yield- ing nearly double the value of agricultural produce. Spain is, only about 26,000 square miles, or^ one-eighth less than France, or, eleven times as large as Holland; the latter has, no minerals, little land for other purposes than for grazing and for buildings : a climate the character of which is humid, and, for a part of the season, severely cold. Yet, it is doubtful if Spain and Holland were left to themselves, in the event of a warlike contention, which nation would ovei-come the other. At present^ opinion would decide in favour of Holland. The example of these two nations, is an elucidation of the power or weakness of countries, in consequence of the wisdom and in- dustry, or the folly and negligence of man, in opposition to natural advantages^ or obstructions. The comparative view of the natural and artificial resources of Spain and Holland, hereafter given, will illustrate more clearly the circumstances, physical and moral, which give lesser or greater wealth and power to nations. In colonial possessions, England has pre-eminence over all Europe. The productions and wants of the Beitish Colonies are so varied, THE BRUSH EMPIRE. no so abundant and so reciprocal, as to render Great Britain inde- pendent of the world for not only, all raw materials, but a market for her home manufactures. The Coloiual Empire of Great Bri- tain, comprehends, also^ every climate, and every known produc- tion. The North Ahericain Provinces possess, a climate congenial to the constitutions of those bom in the United Kingdom; a soil which yields all the crops grown in England, and eminently adapted for the culture of hemp, flax and maize; forests producing, in abun- dance, all needful kinds of timber, as well as potass and tar; abundant mines of interstratified iron and coal; slate, gypsum, lime and freestone ; plentiful fisheries ; commodious and secure harbors; and navigable rivers and lakes. The West India colonies, produce sugar, molasses, rum^ to- bacco, coffee, cocoa, indigo, cotton, and all tropical crops. The Africa colonies^ including the Cape of Good Hope, and the Mauritius, supply ivory, palm oil, gums ; teak*wood for ship build- ing; fancy woods, for cabinet makers ; precious metals; rice, maize, wines, wool, ostrich-feathers; furs; hides; etc., etc. The East Indian possessions yield all kinds of tropical productions, in abundance ; besides coal, precious metals and minerals. AUSTRALIA produces, under a healthy climate^ all useful crops; and aflbrds pasturage, eminently adapted for breeding sheep, homed cattle and horses. The importance of all these possessions will appear more dis- tinctly elucidated, hereafter, under their respective statistical il6a08. SEA PORTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, first class. i5. viz.

Portsmouth, Plymouth, Pembroke, Deptford and Chatham, have Royal dock-yards. Ramsgate, Sandwich, Dover, Hastings, Bristol and some others in the Bristol Channel; Chester, Ulverston> Lancaster^ Preston, Whitehaven, Workington, Maryport, Ravenglass and a few others^ are dry harbors ; that is the tide leaves them without water at low ebb. The DowNSj or Deal, and Spithead are merely road-steads with good holding ground, where ships of war usually anchor. BRITISH COLONIAL SEA PORTS. The principal Colonial sea ports^ are Halifax, Shslburne and Annapous Royal> in Novascotia; St. -John and Placentia, in New- foundland; LouiSBouRG, Sydney and Ste.-Anne, in Capebreton; St.-John, St. -Andrew, Mirih achi, Rustigouche, and several others, in New-Brunswick ; Charlotte^Town^ and George-Town in Prince Edward Island; Gaspe, Bay of Seven Islands, Tadousag, Quebec and Montreal^ in Canada. Besides these the coasts of Newfound- land, Novascotia, Labrador, the Gulf of St.-Lawrence, and the lakes of Canada abound, with deep and safe harbors. In the West Indies are the British sea ports of Bermuda ; of 26 BRITISH SEA PORTS iLiMGSToii aftd Mahon bat, Jamaica ; of Bki^gs-Town, Barbadoes ; of St. -John, Antigua, Nassau, New Proyidence; several others in lilie Bahamas, Tobago, Gbenada, Trinidad, St.-Yincent, Ste.-Lucie; and DsifERABA, Essequibo and Berbicb. In Africa, Britain possesses the ports of Sierra-Leone, Benin, St. -Helena, Table-Bay, False-fay, Algoa-Bay, etc. In EcROJPE (besides those of the United Kingdom and Isut or Man ) , the haii>ors of Guernset and Jerset; the bay of Oibhalter, Malta, and those of the Ionian Islands* In the East Indies, the principal $ea parte are^ Bombat, an intri- cate harbor; Sdrat and Bombay, both admitting the largest ships; several smaU harbors in the presidency of Bon^y. Carwaar, for small vessels ; Tellitchery and Gannamorb, for large ships. The Road of Galicct; the port of Gochin (tributary), Negapatam, Tranguebar, Cuddalore; the roadstead of Madras; MasuupataM; Balazorb; Calcutta; Diamond harbob, and Islambad. All the harbors on the coast of Coromandel and in the bay of Bengal^ are inlricate, and only safe according to the direction of the winds, and by having skilful pilots. In Ceylon, the harbor of Trincomalbe may be considered the best in the East : Point db Galles, is a safe harbor, and roadstead : Colombo^ is safe only during the easterly Monsoon. In New Holland, are Port-Jaceson or Botany-Bay, an excellent and capacious harbor; and Ports Hunter, and Macqdarie, on the east or New South Wale's coast : on the west, is Swan River, an indifferent port : on the south and west are numerous harbors and roadsteads, very imperfectly known. In Van Diemans Land, are the ports of Hobabt-Town, and Geobgb- Town, with some others of less tiote. In Polynesia, the English claim the right of numerous ports, many of which appear as equally appertaining to other nations ; if discovery be the foundation of right. BRITISH RIVERS. In the United Kingdom, the rivers although not large are of great importance, both as respects internal navtgatiob, atid as mfll streams. AND RIVERS. 27 The Thames, the Severn, the Mekset and the Humber, are the most important navigable streams. Others of less depth are stiU of great convenience and benefit for internal navigation, especially for supplying canals. In America, the St. -Lawrence, the Ottowa, the Sagueney, and the St. -John, are rivers of great magnitude. The Mirimachi, Rustigouche, the Ste.-Croix, the Peticoudiac; the Annapolis ; the Ste.-Mary and many important rivers, falling into the lakes and sea-coasts of Norlh America; and the rivers Demerara, Berbice and Essequibo, in South America, are all of great consequence to those countries, in regard to inland navigation. The Ganges, Indus and other large rivers of India, may be considered as completely under the control of the British government. The natural resources of the British Empire consist therefore in the geographical position of her dominions ; in her soil, in her mi- nerals, in her forests, in her fisheries^ in her harbors, and in her rivers. 28 STATISTICAL VIEW of the SUPERFICIES, Coonties arranged in order of Total PopulalioD of 1831. 9 TS CO 1700. fMiddleicx I Laocasler York, W.

No COUNTRY possesses, within its boundaries, greater natural advantages than Fran<»* Although this highly favoured kingdom, has not equal maritime advantages, nor minerals, so conveniently disposed, as those of Eng- land; yet, her internal natural riches are greater; and, in minerals, and harbors, she has pre-eminence over the other great powers of the Continent. In Geographical Position, France is happily situated; the aea and the Pyrenees bounding her on the west; the Waters of the Mediterranean on the south ; the Alps and the Rhine on the east; and Belgium forming, her northern, and it is true, most acces- sible, and less marked, frontier. The surface of France is, in general, a levels very modarateiy undulated. The borders, near Spain, Switzerland, and the Rhine; the central mountains, or hills, of Auverne; and the ridge of Cevennes form the exception. The Seine, Loirel, Garonne, Rhone, Sa6ne, and smaller riveis, open an extensive inland navigation^ susceptible of very easy, and, great improvement ; particularly, requiring the general use of steam-boats. The Rhone has already been connected by a canal with the Rhine; and the great Northern Canal opens a navigation from the Seine and Oise to the Scheldt The Rivers, and Sea ports of France, have now their navigation unlocked, and opened with each other, and with the rivers of Germany and Selgimn, by means 'of Eighty six Canab. Arthur Young divides France into four irregular regions; -^ ^* In the first, the vine is not; in the second, the maize is not; m the third, the olive is not; in the fourth^ or the southern, there are the olive, the mulberry, and the vine, vrith most useful grains and agricultural productions; — in the third, are all but the olive ; in the second, all but the oliTC, and maize or indiaa com ; in the first, all but the olive, maize and vine. According to MM. Chaptal and Meutelle, the soil of France may be classified under seven heads, by including the departe- NATURAL RESOURCES of FRANCE. 4i ments in which each quality predominates. As far as my own observations enable me to judge, I consider the arrangement correct. In the following table the prevailing lands are, accordingly ar- ranged. aiCn AHABLB, AND PASTUU LARDS.

For steam navigation, the Conner is how- ever not conv^oieiKtly disposed. Gold is fouud, but not ia snfGcieot quantities to pay the labour of working. — France has also mines of silver, copper, tin, manganese, cobalt, arsenic, nickel, bis- muth, etc. ; and great plenty of mineral salt. Porphyiy, marble, granite, slate, millstones, grindstones, free- stone for building, fine porcelaine, clay, etc. , are irf>undant. Although the original forests of Prance have been nearly all leveRed, yet the kingdom has a much greater proportion of good, and generally larger, timber than England; and were it not, for the /ia SEA PORTS of FRANCE. great quantity required annuaUy for fuel| the growth of timber trees, in France, would be quite sufficient for all domestic pur- poses, — unless it be fancy woods for furniture and cabinet work. A great variety of fish frequents the Western and Mediterranean coasts, and most fresh water fishes abound in the rivers. The colonies of France with the exception of the small blands of St.*Pierre and Hiquelon, which are, however, of great value, and part of Algiers, are all important in regard to their tropical productions. The natural resources of France enable her to be more inde- pendant of exterior productions, than any other country ; and not only to assume and maintain, a more formidable military position, but also to recover sooner from the disasters of long wars, than any other European power. In these respects Prussia and Austria most resemble France. SEA PORTS OF FRANCE. HRST GtASS, 5. VIZ. Hdvre, t)r the port of Paris; St.-Mdlo; Nantes; Bordeaux and Marseilles. SECOND CLASS, 6. VIZ.
