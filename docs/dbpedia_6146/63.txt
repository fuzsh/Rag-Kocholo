Michael Mashiri

The director of Sentrigo Security, has been arraigned before the court accused of fraudulently using registration plates from cars of the Office of the President.

Terrence Madiro, 42, of Greystone Park appeared before magistrate Donald Ndirowei at the Harare Magistrates' Courts facing charges of fraud and contravening the Customs and Excise Act.

The State, through prosecutor Pardon Dziva, alleges that sometime in 2020, Madiro smuggled a white Ford Ranger double cab vehicle.

He allegedly then fitted the car with registration numbers AFB 5575, belonging to the fleet of Office of the President which he obtained from one Brezhnev Mutambo, who is believed to having been employed by the Presidentâ€™s Office.

The State alleges that, he later gave the car to his ex-wife, Francisca Madiro, to use for the purpose of transporting their children to and from school.

In July 2023, Madiro again allegedly smuggled a Ford Raptor Ranger double cab vehicle from South Africa.

He then fitted the car with registration numbers AGE 0461 belonging to the fleet of Office of the President which he had obtained from Mutambo, who is still at large.

Both cars were checked with Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and Central Vehicle Registry and they were not found in their data bases.

The police were later informed that Madiro was in possession of both smuggled cars and number plates stolen from the Office of the President.

The charcoal Grey Ford Raptor Ranger with numbers AGE 0461 and white Ford Ranger double cab fitted with number plates AFB 5575 were recovered.

The bail hearing for Madiro will continue tomorrow.
