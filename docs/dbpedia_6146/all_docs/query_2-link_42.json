        "text": "The hotel is in a central location on a very busy street and is safe during the day but even the hotel staff suggest you not walk too far at night - take a cab instead. The hotel has a security guard at the entrance. We arrived very early morning and were advised our room might be ready in 2 hours....we returned, not ready for another 2 hours, still not ready and even after the normal check in time, we had to wait an additional 1 1/2 hours. No apology for the dely, no offer of a free drink etc. In fairness, they did say early check in may not occur but if they had said our room wouldn't be ready for 8 hours we would have gone and toured the city. The room we had was on a high floor but you could still hear city noises - think NYC. Room size was fine, room was clean so no complaints there. The pool is on the roof top and not very big for the size of the hotel. We dined at the hotel restaurant our first night and had excellent service and the food was good overall. We returned another night and had a horrible dinner - service was extremely slow, 2 of the dinners that were served (in a group of 6 people) were uneatable. The server we had the first night saw us waiting and came over to apologize - she also had the manager come to our table and translated for the manager - no offer of of a free drink, dessert etc to compensate for the lenghty service delay and 2 of our group didn't have dinner. Very unsatsifactory service! Breakfast was included and was good overall - nice variety but get there early as they close up everything at their closing time - no chance to get food one minute later. The price was reasonable but next time would pay more for hopefully better service."
