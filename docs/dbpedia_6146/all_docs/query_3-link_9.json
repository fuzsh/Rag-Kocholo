        "text": "Sentrigo Security boss in court for fitting President's Office registration plates on smuggled cars\n\nMichael Mashiri\n\nThe director of Sentrigo Security, has been arraigned before the court accused of fraudulently using registration plates from cars of the Office of the President.\n\nTerrence Madiro, 42, of Greystone Park appeared before magistrate Donald Ndirowei at the Harare Magistrates' Courts facing charges of fraud and contravening the Customs and Excise Act.\n\nThe State, through prosecutor Pardon Dziva, alleges that sometime in 2020, Madiro smuggled a white Ford Ranger double cab vehicle.\n\nHe allegedly then fitted the car with registration numbers AFB 5575, belonging to the fleet of Office of the President which he obtained from one Brezhnev Mutambo, who is believed to having been employed by the Presidentâ€™s Office.\n\nThe State alleges that, he later gave the car to his ex-wife, Francisca Madiro, to use for the purpose of transporting their children to and from school.\n\nIn July 2023, Madiro again allegedly smuggled a Ford Raptor Ranger double cab vehicle from South Africa.\n\nHe then fitted the car with registration numbers AGE 0461 belonging to the fleet of Office of the President which he had obtained from Mutambo, who is still at large.\n\nBoth cars were checked with Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and Central Vehicle Registry and they were not found in their data bases.\n\nThe police were later informed that Madiro was in possession of both smuggled cars and number plates stolen from the Office of the President.\n\nThe charcoal Grey Ford Raptor Ranger with numbers AGE 0461 and white Ford Ranger double cab fitted with number plates AFB 5575 were recovered.\n\nThe bail hearing for Madiro will continue tomorrow."
