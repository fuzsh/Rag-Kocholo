        "text": "McAfee might only have just been brought into the Intel fold, but the security company is still on the hunt for new acquisitions.\n\nThis was proved today with the announcement it is to acquire database security company Sentrigo for an undisclosed sum.\n\nMcAfee has been working with Sentrigo on an OEM basis since 2010 and previously as part of its Security Innovation Alliance. Now the California-based company will be brought under McAfee's wing and report to Stuart McClure, senior vice president and general manager of McAfee's risk and compliance division.\n\n\"The integration of Sentrigo with McAfee will provide customers with the highest level of security across their database environments and allow companies to rapidly deploy a database security strategy in a cost effective manner,\" said Dave DeWalt, president of McAfee.\n\n\"The regular stream of public breach announcements is evidence that we must all do much more to protect mission-critical database environments,\" added Nathan Shuchami, chief executive of Sentrigo.\n\n\"As part of McAfee, Sentrigo will be in a position to deliver these best-of-breed solutions to address a much broader range of customer's database security and compliance challenges.\"\n\nThe acquisition is expected to complete in April this year."
