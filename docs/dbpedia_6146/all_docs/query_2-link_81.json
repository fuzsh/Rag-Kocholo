        "text": "The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is an iconic symbol of the city of Santiago and the final point for many pilgrims walking or cycling the Camino de Santiago.\n\nOver the centuries, thousands of pilgrims worldwide have travelled to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, North West of Spain. The pilgrims’ routes are the Camino de Santiago and the Way of St James.\n\nThe Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela: The Camino Destination\n\nThe Camino consists of a network of trails spread across Europe, all sharing one goal and one destination: the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.\n\nLet’s look at 6 things to know about the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela:\n\n1. Tomb of the Apostle St. James\n\nThe Tomb of the Apostle St James is located in the cathedral, in a crypt beneath the Main Altar. Pilgrims can visit this sacred site, where the remains of St James, along with those of his disciples, Saint Athanasius and Saint Theodore, are kept in a silver urn. These relics have made Santiago one of the world’s most significant pilgrimage destinations.\n\n2. Design & Redesign: A Romanesque Masterpiece\n\nThe cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is a leading pilgrimage destination and architectural marvel. It showcases splendid religious art and architecture, drawing visitors worldwide. While preserving its medieval structure and Romanesque essence, it has Gothic enhancements. Baroque features have also been added, creating the masterpiece admired today.\n\nIn the 9th century, a shepherd discovered the remains of St James and built a small chapel, with varying accounts placing this event between 813 and 830. However, the chapel quickly became too small for the growing number of worshippers. A second, larger church was constructed but was eventually destroyed.\n\nBishop San Pedro de Mezonzo rebuilt the church in 1003 in pre-Romanesque style, and by 1075, the current cathedral was under construction during the peak of pilgrimages.\n\nIn the 12th century, Mestre Mateo created the Pórtico da Gloria, a Romanesque sculpture masterpiece featuring 200 biblical figures, which adorns the western facade of the cathedral.\n\nThe Pórtico da Gloria was reopened to the public in 2018 after undergoing a meticulous 10-year restoration project.\n\nAt one time, the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, standing at 76 metres, was the tallest building in Europe.\n\nGothic and Renaissance elements were added over time, including new chapels and the 14th-century Clock Tower. The Holy Door and a reimagined cloister were also introduced gradually.\n\nHowever, the most significant transformation occurred during the Baroque period in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe iconic facade we admire today from Praza do Obradoiro is the result of extensive work. It has been restored to its former glory after years of cleaning and restoration.\n\n3. Porta Santa: The Holy Door\n\nThe Porta Santa, also known as the Holy Door or Forgiveness Door (Puerta del Perdon), was constructed in the 16th century. Situated in Praza Quintana, it provides direct access for pilgrims to St James’ crypt, the Main Altar of the Cathedral, and the image of St James, which pilgrims traditionally embrace. The Holy Door is opened only during Holy Years, or Ano Xacobeo.\n\n4. Botafumeiro\n\nThe Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela houses the renowned Botafumeiro, a massive incense thurible from the mid-19th century. The Botafumeiro swings dramatically across the Main Altar on special dates and occasions and is typically used during pilgrim masses.\n\n5. Confession and Mass\n\nConfession is available throughout the day at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. If no priests are present in the confessionals or if you need confession in your own language, please inquire in the sacristy.\n\nFor more details about the Pilgrim Mass and the history of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, or for information on specific services, please visit www.catedraldesantiago.com."
