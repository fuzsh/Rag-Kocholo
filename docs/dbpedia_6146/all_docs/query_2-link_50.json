        "text": "Relocating to Santiago de Chile\n\nAt a Glance:\n\nYou will need different visas depending on the length and purpose of your stay in Santiago â make sure you apply well in advance of your trip to ensure everything runs smoothly.\n\nThe quality of property very much depends on the area of the city â the eastern districts are wealthier and tend to be where expats settle.\n\nSantiago is home to two of Chileâs most prestigious higher education institutions, the Universidad de Chile and the Universidad Pontificia CatÃ³lica de Chile.\n\nIt is your decision whether you choose to follow a public or private healthcare plan â either way, 10% of your income must be paid to your chosen healthcare plan each month.\n\nMoving to Santiago de Chile, more often known simply as Santiago, requires some forward planning. It is possible that youâll have to visit the city before you move there permanently, for which you might require a visa. Read on below to find out about the rules for entry into the country, before you set your heart on life in the Chilean capital.\n\nYou will find that your most important point of contact will be the cityâsÂ ExtranjerÃ­aÂ (office for dealing with resident foreigners). This is located at:\n\nIntendencia de Santiago, Departamento de ExtranjerÃ­a\n\nSan Antonio 580 piso 2, Santiago Centro\n\nTel. 600-626-4222\n\nThe office is open from Monday to Friday, between 08:30 and 14:00.\n\nTesting the Waters: Tourist Visas for Santiago\n\nIf you want to make a quick trip to Santiago to start your housing search or to visit the ExtranjerÃ­a, then this is the visa for you. Bear in mind that visa approval process will take between two to six weeks, so you should apply well in advance! To apply, you will need:\n\na completed visa application form\n\nproof of booked flight to Chile and back\n\na valid passport and a photocopy\n\nan employment certificate / pay slip from within the last three months\n\nconfirmation of travel health insurance\n\none passport-sized photograph with your full name written on the back\n\nproof of hotel reservation in Santiago / invitation by an individual or company in Chile\n\nYou will have to pay a fee for this visa, though the amount depends on your country of origin. Â When youÂ contact your nearest consulate, make sure to get more information on this before heading to Santiago.\n\nShort-Term Visas\n\nIf you intend on moving to Santiago for a maximum period of one year, then this is the visa for you. Also known as temporary resident visas, the common applicants for a short-term visa include students, volunteers, and expats on short-term assignments. To apply, you need:\n\na completed visa application form\n\na valid passport and a photocopy\n\na police clearance certificate (not older than three months) detailing whether or not the applicant has a criminal record\n\na certificate of health (confirming that the applicant does not have any contagious diseases)\n\na document supporting your reason for applying (e.g. work contract)\n\nproof of sufficient funds to cover the duration of the stay (e.g. bank statement)\n\nfour passport-sized photographs with your full name written on the back\n\nAs with the tourist visa, the application can take between two to six weeks to be processed. Make sure you do not complicate matters with a delayed visa application!\n\nWork Visas\n\nA work visa is, of course, necessary if you are moving to Santiago for a long-term job. Applying for a work visa will require you to already have a work contract: bear this in mind before sending off your application form. More information on work contracts can be found in the section below. For your work visa, you will need:\n\na completed visa application form\n\na valid passport and a photocopy\n\na police clearance certificate (not older than three months) detailing whether or not the applicant has a criminal record\n\na certificate of health (confirming that the applicant does not have any contagious diseases)\n\nan official letter to the consul from your employer, explaining your employment\n\na notarized work contract\n\none passport-sized photograph with your full name written on the back\n\nWork Contracts\n\nThe most important piece of information about the work contract is that it must be signed in the presence of a notary. This applies both to you, and to your employer. Contracts must also include specific phrasing. Please see our article onÂ Moving to ChileÂ for more information.\n\nHousing and Education in Santiago\n\nMoving to a new city feels much more real once you have scouted out where you are going to live, and â if you have a family â which schools your children will attend. The information below should help you with both decisions before you move to Santiago.\n\nHead East for High-Quality Property\n\nIn the 2017 Mercer Cost of Living Survey, Santiago ranks 67th, with a lower cost of living than many other South American cities. While this may be a draw for many expats, be aware that there is a huge divide in the quality of property between the east and west of the city.\n\nThe eastern half of the city is significantly wealthier and is the area where almost all expats settle down. The highest standards of private and public facilities exist here, and the area is well connected by public transportation to the main city center. Prices here can be exorbitant, though, so do not assume everything in the city will be cheap.\n\nHousing Districts in Santiago: Which Block Is Best?\n\nThe center â Santiago Centro â is where students tend to live, due to the cheap prices and lower quality of the apartments. Usually, prices increase the further out from the center you look. Providencia is a favorite amongst expats, due to its green neighborhoods, quiet streets, and fairly central location. Prices are moderate here.\n\nFor something more upmarket, the districts of Barrio Alto are the most popular. These comprise of Las Condes and Vitacura, and are undoubtedly the best and safest neighborhoods in Santiago. Â However, they are located on higher land, towards the mountains, and are less well connected by public transportation.\n\nThe district of Bellas Artes, just north of the city center near the Santa Lucia hill, is also a pleasant and popular area with young professionals. It should be noted, however, that there is a lot of pollution in this area of the city, which could have a negative impact on your quality of life.\n\nHouse Hunting: Where to Start?\n\nThe best way to find somewhere which suits your needs is to speak to any contacts you might have in Santiago. Word of mouth can often be the most reliable means of discovering a potential home. However, if this is not possible, try the following methods:\n\nHomeurbanoÂ offers residences for rent in Santiago.\n\nContact ChileÂ offers furnished apartments for rent.\n\nSoledad Vial, although this is only available in Spanish.\n\nEl MercurioÂ newspaper has useful listings, if you are able to speak Spanish.\n\nInternational Schools in Santiago\n\nIf you would prefer to send your child to an international school, your best option is theÂ International School Nido de AguilasÂ (Eagleâs Nest). This is the oldest international school in Santiago. It has a strong academic reputation, plenty of social activities for families, and is a great place for you to meet other English-speaking expats.\n\nAn alternative is theÂ Santiago College, a Judeo-Christian school which focuses on providing bilingual education. Application forms can be found on their website.\n\nSantiago: Home to Chileâs Top University\n\nSantiago has a number of well-established higher education opportunities. TheÂ Universidad de ChileÂ (UCH) has roots dating back to 1622. It is now the countryâs main university and ranks fourth out of all public universities in Latin America according to QS University Rankings 2016. TheÂ Universidad Pontificia CatÃ³lica de ChileÂ (PUC), a private university, also has an excellent reputation. It is a modern university with extensive facilities, and the majority of their courses are in English.\n\nHealthcare in Santiago\n\nSantiago has an excellent medical system which ranks among the best in Latin America. Government expenditure on healthcare is growing at a faster rate in Chile than in most other OECD countries, which demonstrates that it is a government priority.\n\nPre-Travel Precautions\n\nBefore you move to Santiago, it is a good idea to ensure that your general vaccinations are up to date. It is also wise to get shots for typhoid, polio, hepatitis A, and tetanus. Although you may see a lot of stray dogs while you are in Santiago, rabies is almost nonexistent, so there is no need to worry.\n\nNeed a Doctor? Go Straight to the Specialist\n\nIt pays to take some general precautions while you are living in Santiago. Although drinking water is safe in Chile, it is recommended that you only drink bottled for the first few weeks of your stay, particularly if you have a sensitive stomach. Also, beware of raw vegetables and fish, and any food sold in the street. Always wash and peel fruit and vegetables carefully at home.\n\nIf you have asthma, you might experience some difficulties with the thick smog across the city. Make sure to carry your inhaler with you, and if you think it will be a problem, consider visiting a doctor to get a prescription in Spanish.\n\nWhen Chileans need a doctor, they go straight to a specialist, as general practitioners (GPs) donât exist in the country. Follow their lead, and ask your contacts in Santiago to recommend a good doctor. The majority of doctors speak English and are able to provide you with the same prescriptions you would normally find back home.\n\nHealthcare: Public, Private, or International?\n\nThe public healthcare system in Chile is known by the termÂ FONASA, which is the Spanish acronym for the âNational Health Fund.â The private system involves many different profit- or non-profit-making private health insurance companies, known collectively asÂ ISAPREs.\n\nWhile you are working in Santiago, you will have to enroll in either a public or a private plan. This is the same for all formal workers, self-employed workers with a retirement fund, and all retirees who have pension plans. For healthcare, 10% of your income or pension plan must be paid to the healthcare plan per month, up to a monthly income limit of 2,000 USD.\n\nTypically, those with higher incomes tend to enroll with ISAPREs, and residents on a lower income opt for FONASA, though this is not always the case. If you are not staying in Santiago for a long period of time, it is worth checking to see whether international health insurance will cover you during your stay in the city.\n\nBoth FONASA and ISAPREs must offer the same basic primary care, according to the Explicit Health Guarantee (GES) laws. However, beyond this usual beneficiary package, ISAPREs are free to offer more elaborate packages."
