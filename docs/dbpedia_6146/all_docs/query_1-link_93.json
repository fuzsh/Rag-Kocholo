Learn More.\n\nIf your enterprise customers seem unaware of the dangers to their databases\n\nposed by rogue employees, it might be time to tell them the story of Timothy\n\nCurley.\n\nEmployed by American Express as a database administrator; Curley was arrested on\n\nJune 24 by the U.S. Secret Service on claims from his former employer\n\nthat he and an accomplice stole more than 1,000 customer records in order to\n\ncarry out over $1\n\nmillion in fraudulent activity.\n\nThe lesson is obvious. Corporate data stores are extremely valuable. So much\n\nso that even those charged with keeping them safe can be tempted to dip into\n\nthe treasure chest. DBAs and similarly privileged users have access to some of\n\nthe most concentrated, well-organized and precious collections of data your\n\ncustomers own.\n\n“I am really surprised we don’t hear more about these types of cases,” says\n\nSlavik Markovich, founder and CTO of the\n\ndatabase security vendor Sentrigo, who at the same time says the scarcity of\n\nstories may be understandable—and \"frightening\"—considering “monitoring\n\nof insiders and privileged users is just in its infancy. It’s really just\n\nstarted.”\n\nAfter all, in the case of Curley and his buddy, the cops found crack pipes\n\nand methamphetamine alongside their stash of cloned credit cards. If the\n\ndrug-fueled DBA could steal $1 million before being caught, imagine how long\n\nthe ones with clear minds are lasting.\n\nIn a survey of 400 IT workers conducted earlier this year by Cyber-Ark, 35\n\npercent admitted to accessing corporate information without authorization. More\n\nspecifically, in regard to databases 47 percent said that if they moved to\n\nanother job they would steal database information to bring with them. And among\n\nall respondents, approximately 75 percent reported that they could circumvent\n\nthe controls currently in place to restrict access to internal information.\n\nCyber-Ark’s data supports estimates from analysts at Forrester Research, who\n\nbelieve that 70 percent of threats to databases come from within the\n\nenterprise.\n\n“These [internal threats] are often very difficult to detect and block,\n\nlargely because of excessive privileges granted to users, users sharing common\n\nlog-ins and accounts, and privileged users such as testers, developers and even\n\nDBAs having access to sensitive data,” wrote Noel Yuhanna in a February 2009\n\nreport on the state of database security.\n\nAnalysts say solution providers have an opportunity to bring all of this\n\noverwhelming evidence to bear on clueless enterprise IT administrators and\n\nline-of-business managers. Now is the time to begin formulating strategies for\n\nimplementing controls over the database that include not just the average user,\n\nbut also the unchecked super-user, they say.\n\nIf you can’t appeal to the customer’s sense for the carrot of security, you\n\ncan at least pull out the compliance stick. For example, those organizations\n\nthat must comply with PCI DSS standards\n\ncould potentially be putting themselves at risk if they are not able to track\n\nprivileged user access to databases containing credit card information.\n\nAccording to VeriSign, which acts as a PCI assessor, more than 70 percent of\n\norganizations that fail their audits are flagged for failing to track and\n\nmonitor access to cardholder data.\n\nRegardless of the motivations you try to build awareness, the key is to try,\n\nMarkovich says.\n\n“I think the most important thing is awareness,” Markovich says. “The\n\nchannel needs to talk with their customers and explain to them that protecting\n\nvia firewall or from the outsider is no longer sufficient. You have to be aware\n\nthat your database can and—if you don’t do anything—will be breached by\n\nprivileged users.”\n\nClearly awareness is a start, but what next?"
