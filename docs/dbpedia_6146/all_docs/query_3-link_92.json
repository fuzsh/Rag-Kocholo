        "text": "Database security tools are tools that offer specific protection for databases. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems, in theory, already protect databases from malicious activity. Databases, on the other hand, need to be protected on their own. Because databases have had to become more available to a broader range of users, specialized protection is required to protect against database-specific threats. Such tools have also become more specialized in protecting databases that are placed on-premise, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.\n\nUnauthorized database access, in general, puts data confidentiality, integrity, and availability at risk. Because corporate databases often include important customer data and other sensitive information, safeguarding them from bad intent is a top issue. Certain industries may require proper database security in order to comply with data regulations. Some tools will also include security-related capabilities like tracking user activity and database interactions.\n\nIn the list of the top tools, we have mentioned the Top 40 Database Security tools along with their features and pricing for you to choose from.\n\n1. dbWatch\n\ndbWatch is a comprehensive and scalable database monitoring solution that enables businesses to efficiently monitor and manage any number of SQLServer and Oracle databases.

The database, the data it holds, the database management system, and the numerous applications that access it are all covered by database security.\n\nWhat are database security models?\n\nThe following factors are included in database security models:\n\nSubject: A person who interacts with the database in some way\n\nObject: A database unit that needs to be authorized before it can be manipulated.\n\nAny activity that a subject might do on an object is referred to as an access mode/action.\n\nAuthorization: Each subject's access mode on each object is specified.\n\nAdministrative rights: Who has administrative rights and what are the obligations of administrators?\n\nEnterprise-wide recognized security regulations are referred to as policies.\n\nHow does database encryption work?\n\nAn encryption algorithm changes data in a database from a readable state to a ciphertext of unreadable characters with database encryption. A user can decrypt the data and get useful information using a key generated by the algorithm.\n\nWhat are the four elements of security?\n\nThe key elements for efficient security on any site, whether it's a tiny independent business with a single location or a major multinational enterprise with hundreds of locations, are Protection, Detection, Verification, and Reaction.\n\nWhat data is confidential?\n\nAny information that is not meant for public disclosure is classified as confidential data. It may be private information, intellectual property, and so on."
