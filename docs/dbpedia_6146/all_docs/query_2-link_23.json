        "text": "Chile is located along the western coast of the southern cone of South America, between the highest segment of the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Its shape is unique: it is one of the longest countries in the world, with 4,300 km in length, but also one of the narrowest, with an average width of only 180 km.\n\nThe majestic Andean Mountain Range can be seen from almost anywhere in the city. Due to its geographic location, Santiago is one of the few capital cities in the world which has easy access both to ski slopes -just 50 kms. away-, and beaches, 100 kms. away. It is in fact possible to visit the modern ski resorts as well as the famous beach resort of Viña del Mar or picturesque Valparaíso, Chile’s main port, in just one day.\n\nFrom salty desert top to glacier-crowded bottom, Chile is an incredible reminder of nature’s beauty and power. This narrow country is jammed with geysers, mountains, beaches, forests and volcanoes.\n\nFrom Chile it is easy and relatively inexpensive to travel to other South American countries and enjoy the latin culture throughout the continent.\n\nSantiago, its capital city, complements with the artistic, culinary and cultural activities that every cosmopolitan city delivers."
