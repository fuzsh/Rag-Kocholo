For now, I think I will just give the requester a mention and add the tool he wants advertised to the growing list of tools that I have been compiling.\n\nThe tool looks like it has some merit and seems like it would be worth the trial. The tool is called DBDefence. You can find more about it here. The purpose of this tool is to help encrypt your databases – outside of the databases and prevent people from prying too far into what they shouldn’t. I haven’t yet tested the tool – but it seems quite interesting."
