        "text": "Description\n\nA Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. It also includes non-security fixes that are required (because of interdependencies) by those security patches. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative, except as noted below, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:\n\nCritical Patch Updates and Security Alerts\n\nDue to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible. This Critical Patch Update contains 59 new security fixes across all product families listed below.\n\nAffected Products and Components\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in [square brackets] following the product versions. Please click on the link in [square brackets] or in the Patch Availability Table to access the documentation for those patches.\n\nAffected product releases and versions that are in Premier Support or Extended Support, under the Oracle Lifetime Support Policy:\n\nPatch Availability Table and Risk Matrices\n\nProducts with Cumulative Patches\n\nStarting with the January 2010 CPU, Oracle E-Business Suite Release 11.5.10 CU2 patches are cumulative. For more information, please see Oracle E-Business Suite Critical Patch Update Note for July 2010.\n\nThe Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control, Oracle E-Business Suite Applications (Releases 11.5.10 CU2, 12.0 and 12.1), JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, JD Edwards OneWorld Tools, PeopleSoft Enterprise Portal Applications, PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools and Siebel Enterprise, and Oracle Industry Applications patches in the Updates are cumulative; patches for any of these products included in a Critical Patch Update will include all fixes for that product from the previous Critical Patch Updates.\n\nProducts with Non-Cumulative Patches\n\nOracle E-Business Suite Applications Release 11.5.10 patches are not cumulative, so Oracle E-Business Suite Applications customers should refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to identify previous security fixes they want to apply. Oracle Collaboration Suite patches were cumulative up to and including the fixes provided in the July 2007 Critical Patch Update. From the October 2007 Critical Patch Update on, Oracle Collaboration Suite security fixes are delivered using the one-off patch infrastructure normally used by Oracle to deliver single bug fixes to customers.\n\nFor each administered Oracle product, consult the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions referenced from the following table. For an overview of the Oracle product documentation related to this Critical Patch Update, please refer to the Oracle Critical Patch Update July 2010 Documentation Map, My Oracle Support Note 1128882.1.\n\nRisk Matrix Content\n\nRisk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.\n\nSeveral vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. Italics indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see Oracle CVSS Scoring for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.\n\nWorkarounds\n\nDue to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.\n\nSkipped Critical Patch Updates\n\nOracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous Critical Patch Update advisories to determine appropriate actions.\n\nProduct Dependencies\n\nOracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Critical Patch Update July 2010 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products.\n\nUnsupported Products and Versions\n\nOracle recommends that customers upgrade their Oracle products to a supported version. Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.\n\nCritical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the Lifetime Support Policy. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.\n\nProducts in Extended Support\n\nLifetime Support Policy\n\nCritical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the Lifetime Support Policy. Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.\n\nSupported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in My Oracle Support Note 209768.1. Please review the Technical Support Policies for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.\n\nOn Request Model\n\nOracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. We create patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager only if requested by customers.\n\nRefer to Critical Patch Update July 2010 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products ( My Oracle Support Note 1089044.1) for further details regarding the On Request patches.\n\nCredit Statement\n\nThe following people or organizations discovered and brought security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle's attention: Maksymilian Arciemowicz of SecurityReason; Okan Basegmez of DORASEC Consulting; Check Point Software; Esteban Martinez Fayo of Application Security, Inc.; Stephen Fewer of iDefense; Roy Fox of Sentrigo; Tobias Klein; Ofer Maor of Hacktics; MarkoT of Corelan Team; Slavik Markovich of Sentrigo; Andrea Micalizzi aka rgod, working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Monarch2020 of unsecurityresearch; Timothy D.
