        "text": "PRESS RELEASE\n\nSanta Clara, CA (PRWEB) November 2, 2010\n\nSentrigo, Inc., the innovator in database security software, today announced that Sentrigo Hedgehog Enterprise and vPatch solutions are now available on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) for database audit, protection and breach prevention. Sentrigo's database compliance and security solutions allow organizations to more easily run applications subject to PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SEC regulations and more on Amazon EC2.\n\nSentrigo's Hedgehog Enterprise is a scalable database activity monitoring and intrusion prevention solution that provides full visibility into all database activity, including external threats from hackers, as well as local privileged access. Sentrigo's vPatch protects unpatched databases against known vulnerabilities and exploits using unique virtual patching capabilities.\n\nBuilt on a distributed model using autonomous sensors to monitor databases wherever they are hosted, Hedgehog is ideally suited for cloud computing environments. By packaging Hedgehog into an easy-to-install Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the Sentrigo solutions can be installed on existing Amazon EC2 instances in minutes. Wizard-driven templates for key industry regulations, as well as out-of-the-box audit reports, quickly enable organizations hosting databases to demonstrate compliance.\n\n\"As more organizations move toward cloud computing to take advantage of lower costs of computing, more flexibility, greater reliability and availability, and almost unlimited scalability, those that manage their databases in the cloud must also ensure they are compliant with various regulations,\" said Andy Feit, vice president of marketing for Sentrigo. \"Only Sentrigo's Hedgehog Enterprise monitors and audits data access from the inside of each database virtual server, allowing efficient operation in distributed cloud computing environments, immediate local termination of suspicious sessions, and the necessary separation of duties to ensure proper controls over privileged users.\"\n\nFor more information about Sentrigo's cloud security solutions, please visit www.sentrigo.com/cloud-security.\n\nAdditional information on Hedgehog Enterprise is available at www.sentrigo.com/products/hedgehog-enterprise.\n\nFor vPatch, visit www.sentrigo.com/products/hedgehog-vpatch.\n\nTweet this: Sentrigo Database Security Solutions Now Available for Amazon EC2 Follow Sentrigo on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/sentrigo\n\nAbout Sentrigo Sentrigo is a recognized innovator in database security solutions, offering a full suite of products for vulnerability assessment, virtual patching and database monitoring/auditing.
