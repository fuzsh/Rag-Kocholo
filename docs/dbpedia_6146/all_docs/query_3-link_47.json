        "text": "Type an IP address, host name, or name to identify your IBM Web Sphere Application Server as an event source in JSA. IP addresses or host names are recommended as they allow JSA to identify a log file to a unique event source.\n\nFor example, if your network contains multiple IBM Web Sphere Application Serves that provides logs to a file repository, specify the IP address or host name of the device that created the event log. This allows events to be identified at the device level in your network, instead of identifying the file repository.\n\nFrom the list, select the protocol that you want to use when retrieving log files from a remove server. The default is SFTP.\n\nSFTP SSH File Transfer Protocol\n\nFTP File Transfer Protocol\n\nSCP Secure Copy\n\nThe underlying protocol that is used to retrieve log files for the SCP and SFTP service type requires that the server specified in the Remote IP or Hostname field has the SFTP subsystem enabled.\n\nType the TCP port on the remote host that is running the selected Service Type. The valid range is 1 - 65535.\n\nThe options include FTP ports:\n\nFTP TCP Port 21\n\nSFTP TCP Port 22\n\nSCP TCP Port 22\n\nIf the host for your event files is using a non-standard port number for FTP, SFTP, or SCP, you must adjust the port value.\n\nType the user name necessary to log in to the host that contains your event files.\n\nThe user name can be up to 255 characters in length.\n\nIf you select SCP or SFTP as the Service Type, this parameter allows for the definition of an SSH private key file.\n\nThe Remote Password field is ignored when you provide an SSH Key File.\n\nType the directory location on the remote host to the cell and file path you specified in Configuring IBM Web Sphere. This is the directory that you created containing your IBM Web Sphere Application Server event files.\n\nFor FTP only. If your log files are located in the remote user's home directory, you can leave the remote directory blank. This is to support operating systems where a change in the working directory (CWD) command is restricted.\n\nIf you select SFTP or FTP as the Service Type, this option allows for the configuration of the regular expression (regex) to filter the list of files that are specified in the Remote Directory. All matching files are included in the processing.\n\nThe FTP file pattern that you specify must match the name that you assigned to your JVM logs in Customizing the Logging Option. For example, to collect system logs, type the following code:\n\nSystem.*\\.log\n\nUse of this parameter requires knowledge of regular expressions (regex). For more information, see the following website: http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/\n\nThis option appears only if you select FTP as the Service Type. The FTP Transfer Mode parameter allows for the definition of the file transfer mode when log files are retrieved over FTP.\n\nFrom the list, select the transfer mode that you want to apply to this log source:\n\nBinary Select Binary for log sources that require binary data files or compressed zip, gzip, tar, or tar+gzip archive files.\n\nASCII Select ASCII for log sources that require an ASCII FTP file transfer.\n\nYou must select None for the Processor parameter and LINEBYLINE the Event Generator parameter when you use ASCII as the FTP Transfer Mode.\n\nType the time of day you want the processing to begin. This parameter functions with the Recurrence value to establish when and how often the Remote Directory is scanned for files. Type the start time, based on a 24-hour clock, in the following format: HH: MM.\n\nType the frequency, beginning at the Start Time, that you want the remote directory to be scanned. Type this value in hours (H), minutes (M), or days (D). For example, type 2H if you want the directory to be scanned every 2 hours. The default is 1H.\n\nWhen you schedule a log file protocol, select a recurrence time for the log file protocol shorter than the scheduled write interval of the Web Sphere Application Server log files. This ensures that Web Sphere events are collected by the log file protocol before the new log file overwrites the old event log.\n\nSelect this check box if you want the log file protocol to run immediately after you click Save. After the Run On Save completes, the log file protocol follows your configured start time and recurrence schedule.\n\nSelecting Run On Save clears the list of previously processed files for the Ignore Previously Processed File parameter.\n\nSelect this check box to define the local directory on your JSA that you want to use for storing downloaded files during processing. We recommend that you leave the check box clear. When the check box is selected, the Local Directory field is displayed, which gives the option of configuring the local directory to use for storing files."
