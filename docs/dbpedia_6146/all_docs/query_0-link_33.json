        "text": "Intel’s McAfee subsidiary on Wednesday said it would acquire Sentrigo, which provides database security and compliance products.\n\nThe acquisition comes just under a month after Intel completed the acquisition of security company McAfee for US$7.6 billion. Intel announced in August it would buy McAfee to enhance its software and on-chip security stack, and the merger was completed on Feb. 28.\n\nSlideshow: 2011’s tech industry M&As\n\nIntel is maintaining McAfee as a subsidiary. Intel last week said it will continue to look for acquisitions related to security.\n\nMcAfee declined to comment on the acquisition amount related to Sentrigo. McAfee said the acquisition is expected to close in April, contingent to closing conditions.\n\nSentrigo offers a suite of products designed to help prevent database attacks through activity monitoring, intrusion prevention, vulnerability detection and protection of unpatched systems. The company’s products can also help customers meet regulatory requirements and comply with standards such as PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) or HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)."
