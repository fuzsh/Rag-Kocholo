        "text": "Boss Fight\n\n-Two minutes after Fredrick and James left-\n\n\"What the hell happened here?!\"\n\nA man with short brown hair, brown skin, a scar running through his left eye and wearing a black-leather jacket came into the now-wrecked bar with two guys behind him, both wearing armless clothes with a dark tooth carved on their shoulders, one bald and the other having small dark hair.\n\nThe appearance of these three men caused the meek men to start making a fuss as one of them called out.\n\n\"Boss, help us! Some crazy guys killed Mart and Ortiz\" one said, panicking.\n\n\"Yeah boss, you gotta take revenge for us\" another added and before long…\n\n\"Boss, you gotta make these guys pay\"\n\n\"Yeah, show him who's boss, boss!\"\n\n\"Boss…\"\n\n\"Boss…\"\n\n\"Boss…\"\n\nThe others began to do the same, until…\n\n\"SHUT UP! SHUT THE HELL UP\" the 'boss' had almost gone crazy with so many people calling him.\n\n\"I LEAVE YOU GUYS ALONE FOR THIRTY MINUTES! THIRTY FU**ING MINUTES AND THIS HAPPENS?!\" he shouted out in rage seeing his men act so dumb and weak.\n\nThe men quickly shut their mouths or they might die.\n\nNevertheless, he was the boss for a reason, part of which was that he knew how to calmly rationalize a situation, like he was doing now\n\n'Who the heck did this?' he thought as he looked at his men in a sorry state.\n\nHis brain started to churn the names of those he had offended and were capable of launching such an attack.\n\n'Green Snake? Red Hook? No they wouldn't go this far, then who was it?'\n\nAs he tried to come up with an answer, Ezra, who had been seated at an inconspicuous side of the bar, stood up and spoke.\n\n\"I take it that you're the one leading this group of degenerates\"\n\nOne of the men lying down began to think…\n\n'Hmm, he must be acting tough since boss is stronger than us here'\n\n'Which means he wouldn't touch us and go away quickly' thought the man as began to speak. He was going to make sure that the boy was killed or crippled before he was allowed to leave.\n\nAnd with such thinking, he spoke up to try and rile the others up, after all…\n\n'If we attack together with the boss here, he wouldn't stand a chance'\n\n\"Hey, we aren-\"\n\nThe man didn't get to finish before he found himself flying as he felt his bones breaking, then…\n\n*Bam*\n\nHe smashed into the side wall filled with liquor.\n\nSilence! Complete and utter silence!\n\n\"This is why you shouldn't leave trash littering the floor. They make stupid noises\"\n\nThe voice of the culprit echoed out as the others had their rising morale fall back to zero in an instant.\n\nThe meaning of the demonstration was clear, no words needed.\n\nAll the men lying down understood this, before looking at their boss who had yet to say a word.\n\nBecause it meant…\n\n'He doesn't give a damn about the boss'\n\n'He's not afraid at all'\n\nOthers had similar thoughts as the question on their minds was…\n\n'Is he actually stronger than the boss or is he just crazy?'\n\nThey all thought before opting to use the 'wait and see' approach.\n\nAfter all, it wasn't too late to beg for mercy after the fight was over, rather than risk dying a dog's death over something stupid.\n\nEveryone eventually came to the same conclusion. They would wait until the big dogs were done rather than risk being collateral damage.\n\nMeanwhile, the top dogs in question were currently in a stare down as they tried to figure out their opponent.\n\n'He sent Rigo flying with a kick to the side, but is he at the Adept rank or higher?' the boss thought.\n\n'Hmm, most of these guys are knuckleheads. The fact that he thinks before attacking is disconcerting' Ezra thought.\n\n'Hmm, I guess I'll have to find out' the boss thought before lightly waving his hand and saying…\n\n\"Go and take care of him\"\n\nThe two boys behind him immediately went into action as they unsheathed their daggers and attacked.\n\nSeeing this, Ezra pulled out a sword nearby, holding dual swords as he entered his fighting stance while thinking…\n\n'These two are slightly above average in skill and use a mana technique specialized in speed'\n\nHe assessed them in a brief instant before…\n\n*Chang* *Kin*\n\nThe two sides collided, a flurry of sparks came into view as both sides moved faster than a normal human and were getting faster by the second.\n\nThe sound of metal hitting against metal was the only thing to be heard in the wrecked bar.\n\nThe boss chose to stay behind as he observed the boy's fighting skills, only to be amazed at the fluidity of his movement.\n\nNormally, in a dagger versus sword fight, the sword user uses its length to keep the dagger wielder from coming closer, while the dagger wielder tries to close the distance.\n\nYet this boy confronted his men at arm's length while brazenly attacking without a change in expression.\n\nThey fought for close to a minute, moving from place to place when the boss suddenly realized something.\n\n'He's not growing tired, but he's not attacking either, only dodging, blocking or deflecting the attacks'\n\nA thought suddenly popped up in the boss's head.\n\n'Is he using them to train?' the thought was so absurd that even he found it unbelievable. 本章未完，請點擊下一頁繼續閱讀！ 第1頁/共2頁\n\nChapter end"
