The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m., in room 418, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Bernard Sanders, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Sanders, Brown, Tester, Blumenthal and Burr. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BERNARD SANDERS, CHAIRMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT Chairman Sanders. Chairman Sanders. Good morning and thank you for coming to what I think is going to be a very informative and important hearing on how the VA and other organizations that work with the VA do outreach. Before I begin with the substance of this hearing, I do want to make a statement, and that is to point out to Dr. Sowers and to the VA that it is completely unacceptable, with the vast resources of the VA, that they were incapable of submitting their testimony to this Committee on time. It is disrespectful. We, the Committee, by rule is supposed to receive testimony in advance of the hearing so we can absorb it and learn from it. Testimony came in late. This is the second time since I have been chair that this has happened. I just want to make the VA aware that I will not allow this to continue. I do not think it is too much for this Committee to get testimony on time so staff and Members have an opportunity to adequately understand its contents. Now, on to the substance of this hearing. There was a survey in October 2010 that indicated nearly 60 percent of veterans did not understand or were not fully aware of the benefits available to them. I happen to think that in many areas the VA does enormously good work and important work. I was just in the VA center in White River Junction on Saturday and looked at a program that is literally saving many lives. But no matter how good the programs are that the VA has, no matter how good its variety of health care programs may be, or what they are doing in homelessness or many other areas, it does not mean anything to the veteran if that veteran does not know about it. We have 22 million veterans in this country. Some of them do not want to access the VA and that is fine. But I do think it is our job to do as much as we possibly can to make sure that every veteran in America has the information they need to make the choice, to understand what the VA is offering so they can say, ``No, I do not want to access it,'' or, ``Wow, I really did not know that. This is terribly important to my family.'' ``I did not know about this educational opportunity. I did not know about this health care program.'' So, the truth is also that we are in the 21st Century. We have computers and email and social media; and while I think we can say historically, the VA has not done a terribly good job in outreach, I think what we can also say in fairness to the VA in the last few years we have seen a significant turnaround. I got involved in this issue because about 10 years ago in the State of Vermont, I was not impressed about how few Vermont veterans knew about VA programs. I went around the State with VA and we had hundreds and hundreds of people coming out to these meetings, saying, ``Oh, I did not know that I am entitled to that. I did not know what the VA has to offer in terms of low cost prescription drugs. I did not know how I can access that.'' So, the bad news is, historically, the VA has not done a particularly good job in outreach. The good news is that we have seen some significant turnaround. Nobody who looks at VA's Web site today could deny that it is a lot better than it was a year ago and that VA is making progress on other fronts as well. We are here today to learn from the VA how they are communicating with veterans, some of whom are in desperate need of VA programs but do not know about them. A particular problem is with older veterans--Korea, Vietnam, folks--who do not necessarily feel comfortable on the internet. How are we reaching out to those veterans? There is a lot to discuss and I look forward not only to hearing from Dr. Sowers but to hearing from our wonderful panel that will follow him and talk about the very good work they are doing independent of the VA. Senator Burr. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR, RANKING MEMBER, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA Senator Burr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will not cover the same thing that Chairman Sanders covered as it related to the timeliness of your remarks; but whatever the Chairman chooses to do, I will back him fully. I think that the Committee deserves better from the VA including a pledge to the Chairman to work in whatever fashion to make sure that this practice--I say practice because it is not an isolated incident--stops. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this important hearing that will focus on the outreach of VA and how community-based organizations can help veterans access services. I would like to also take this opportunity to welcome all of our witnesses today. Before I talk about the importance of leveraging community assets that can help identify veterans in need or help veterans find needed assistance locally, I would like to touch on the VA's current outreach efforts. During both the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 budget hearings, I asked the VA to provide information on the amount of money enterprise-wide that VA spent on outreach activities as well as what matrix it uses to determine the effectiveness of its outreach initiatives. In response to my questions for fiscal year 2012, the VA's Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs, or OPIA, indicated that it had previously stood up the National Veterans' Outreach Office, which was tasked with tracking costs associated with outreach activities, providing training to VA to outreach personnel, and evaluating and developing metrics to measure effectiveness. They stated that they hoped they would be able to provide the cost information within the next year. A year later, in pre-hearing questions for the 2013 budget hearing, I again asked VA for information on the amount of money spent on outreach. VA provided the Committee with information showing that from fiscal year 2009 to 2013, VA had spent a total of $83.7 million on outreach. Although this amount only included an estimate on the spending of 2013, I was pleased that VA had begun to account for the money being spent. I was hopeful that this was the first step toward Public and Intergovernmental Affairs Office and NVO undertaking the needed process of coordinating VA outreach as well as determining which programs were effective in assisting veterans and which were not. Unfortunately, this has not happened. It is my understanding that from March until August of last year, NVO was without a director. Only in August 2012 was a full-time director hired to run NVO and oversee all the VA outreach activities. To make matters worse, the previous director was on temporary assignment, meaning NVO had been without full-time leadership for over a year. Because of this, VA has no enterprise-wide metrics to determine whether outreach is effective and is unable in the short term to provide the Committee with updated cost information. Mr. Sowers, VA is a large department and I understand individual medical centers, regional offices, and programmatic offices are largely responsible for their own outreach activities. However, NVO under your office has been charged with coordinating outreach, and I believe this should be a real priority for you: to ensure that NVO is meeting its assigned task. There are veterans in need of services and it is vital that VA effectively reach out to them to ensure that they are aware of the health care and benefit assistance that is available. If VA is unable to quantify their current outreach efforts, I believe it calls into question whether any future outreach will be duplicative or will have the desired outcome. Turning to the second panel, I am interested in hearing more on how we can leverage existing community assets to reach veterans in need. As I have discussed in previous Committee hearings, private-public partnerships in the context of mental health care is a great way to ensure that veterans get the care they earned and deserve. By using a similar model for outreach, veterans will be better placed to find programs offered by local governments and non-profits that can best meet their needs. Finally, I hope to learn more about the existing community integration initiatives, whether there are any best practices that can be expanded nationally, and if there are ways to partner with the VA. Veterans live in both rural and urban areas, and VA resources may not be available close to where they live. However, almost every community in this country has a network of veterans, businesses, or non-profits willing to help in the efforts which can be coordinated in a meaningful way. I look forward to the testimony today and I thank the Chair. Chairman Sanders. Thank you, Senator Burr. Senator Tester. STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Burr, Mr. Sowers, and the witness that are to come yet. We are at a time when agencies are attempting to do more with less. So, it only makes sense to work more collaboratively with partners, to better utilize all the tools that are at our disposal. That means building partnerships with other Federal agencies to ensure the we are working as efficiently and productively as possible. It also means jurisdictional issues and duplication of effort that impede progress. It also means that we need to explore and build stronger partnerships with local partners, non-profits, and the private sector. We have a lot of challenges addressing the needs of our veterans and we have got a lot of folks out there that are willing to help. We have got to the folks who are willing to help better engaged in the process. I think that is why you are here and the next panel is here. So, I think that if we coordinate better, we can reach that common goal of serving our veterans better, and that is the bottom line. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Senator Brown. STATEMENT OF HON. SHERROD BROWN, U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Sowers, for joining us, and I appreciate the comments of Senator Burr and Senator Tester. A comment to our Nation's veterans begins at outreach before ending the backlog, before quality of care, before ending homelessness. Our efforts will fall short if we are not reaching every veteran. That obviously almost goes without saying. I appreciate the Chairman holding a hearing on this important issue. And outreach cannot be solely a VA issue. It has to be the responsibility of all of us. I have done a series of events around Ohio promoting VRAP for the last several months. People in my State in many cases are not aware of it. They have benefited greatly from it, those who have signed up. We know that is replicated in State after State. The Ohio Department of Veterans' Services estimated it has contract information for more than 450,000 of Ohio's veterans. Yet VA estimates that Ohio actually is the home some 875,000 veterans. Not all of those accounted for may qualify for benefits. Some of those veterans surely would not. We know from experience that many do: from burial expenses to education to health care. So, it is more than just the benefits of VA. The veterans we are not reaching are also missing out on a wide network of Veterans Service Organizations. We know that people come home after serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, do not connect with the local VA in either the veterans service office, which Ohio has in each of the 88 counties, or the Veterans Service Organizations. Outreach is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor. I have held a series of field hearings in Appalachia in southeast Ohio. I was taken by the dean of Ohio University's eastern campus who said, ``Many Appalachian veterans or families never seek help. They do the best they can through self-help. This is oftentimes not enough for those encountering depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress due to their previous combat experience. ``If we are to effectively help Appalachian veterans and their families, we will need to educate them and the public about the impact of the combat experience on these veterans. We will need to implement aggressive outreach programs informing veterans about the services that are available to them.'' He was speaking specifically of Appalachian veterans but we know anecdotally that that is far too common for veterans all over the country. So, we spend a lot of time investing in the VA. We spend money giving VA resources. These investments do not mean a whole lot if we have not reached out as well as we should to the people who served our country. So, Mr. Sowers, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Let me just ask this if I might. Mr. Burr, would you say, in general, in North Carolina is the average veteran aware of his or her benefits? Senator Burr. Mr. Chairman, let me say that North Carolina may be a unique State simply because of the military footprint that is there and the fact that we are the fastest growing veterans population in the country. So, I think our veterans are pretty aware. It is probably not through the outreach programs of the VA. It is more the size of the infrastructure. Chairman Sanders. Jon, what do you think in Montana? Senator Tester. I think it depends on what conflict they were involved in. I can tell you there are a lot of vets that were turned down for service years ago. They quite frankly do not know that they can come back and try again, because we have changed the rules of the game. So, that is a challenge. I think that the VSOs--if the VA was able to utilize them and if the VSOs could get recruitment to members involved in the different organizations, it could really help the VA get their education out. It is very difficult. I mean, I will just tell you. I had a meeting when I first got on this Committee and there was a veteran that came in to the meeting we had and he says, I just came out of the woods, and it was not a figurative statement. He literally just came out of the woods, and he had been there since the Vietnam conflict. Chairman Sanders. Sherrod. Senator Brown. Yes, briefly. I go back to my dad. My dad was a World War II vet, and he hardly ever talked about it like many in that generation. One of the things I most appreciate about being on this Committee is to encourage older vets, World War II vets, whether they are making the visits to Washington, to see the veterans memorial or at a veterans' organization in Chillicothe to get them to tell their stories. I think that sort of reluctance to speak out is also-- generally they are not particularly aware of this--it is a pretty self-reliant group of people. I also think the military so often does not really give them any guidance when they leave the Armed Forces and come back to this country. They do not tell them much about how you can go to Youngstown State in a special program for combat veterans or how you can connect with the local community-based outpatient clinic. The military needs to do better. I think we need to do better. I think our culture needs to do better with this. Chairman Sanders. Thank you. Dr. Sowers, the mic is yours. STATEMENT OF TOMMY SOWERS, Ph.D., ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PUBLIC AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS Mr. Sowers. Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Burr, and distinguished Members of the Committee, on behalf of Secretary Shinseki and the employees at the VA, I am honored to be here this morning to update you on the Department's outreach. I would like to briefly explain where we are, the situation, and where we are headed. Chairman, as you mentioned, there are more than 22 million veterans in the United States, yet less than half currently access the VA. In addition, the 2010 survey that you referenced said that 60 percent of veterans knew either very little or nothing at all about their VA benefits. I used to be one of the 60 percent. While on active duty in the military, the military had my full attention. Upon leaving the Army, I learned what many other veterans already know, that while service made me strong, the VA can make me stronger. Because of the VA, I was able to file and receive a claim, earn my doctorate, thanks to the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and I get first-rate health care at VA facilities. I know firsthand the impact of awareness of these benefits. From early in his tenure, Secretary Shinseki identified increasing veterans access as one of his top three priorities, and today we can see our outreach efforts making a difference. Accessing health care has never been simpler. Across the country, Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are utilizing VA health care at a rate greater than any previous generation, including an unprecedented increase in the number of women receiving care at the VA. Education and compensation benefits have been never been greater. I and about a million other veterans and family members have gone back to school on the Post-9/11 GI Bill. In the last few years, we have added about a million more to our compensation rolls. But in the Special Forces, I learned you cannot accomplish a mission alone. You have got to work by, with, and through others in order to get it done. The Secretary and I both meet regularly with non-profits, for-profits, and veterans service and advocacy organizations. Following my comments this morning, we will hear from a few of the over 10,000 organizations committed to making a difference in the lives of veterans and their families. Mike Monroe of Point of Light works closely with our caregiver initiative and our benefits administration to find ways to increase economic opportunities for veterans. In New York City, Eric Weingartner of the Robin Hood Foundation helps veterans and families in poverty complementing our aggressive homeless outreach, and our medical centers collaborate with volunteers through Wendy Spencer at the Corporation for National and Community Service. We have also greatly expanded our outreach to State and local governments. Last year the VA signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs. Massachusetts' veterans leader, Coleman Nee, does great work from connecting our homeless prevention efforts with local leaders to helping veterans get the training and certifications they need to get good jobs. And last week in Boston, VA medical staff worked closely with Coleman and other State officials to respond to those events, connecting the victims with our experience with dealing, assessing, and recovering from trauma. Tomorrow, VA is deploying three mobile Vet Centers throughout the greater Boston area to assist local authorities with counseling those affected by the attack, and we will be there for those injured while they recover, helping them re- define their mission. For decades we have challenged and inspired our injured veterans through our rehabilitative sports programs. I could continue to tell you about where we are from our Web site, from Make the Connection Campaign to our involvement with think tanks to our expanded social media presence. But I know all good messages are delivered succinctly. So, I look forward to saying more during the question portion. What I am really excited about today is where we are headed tomorrow. Immediately after my arrival last August, we evaluated our current outreach and initiated planning to launch a new campaign called VA Access. VA Access is a multi-year communication and outreach effort involving our three administrations and VA staff offices. We have incorporated best practices from the private sector, built-in strategic and tactical objectives, set milestones, and established quantifiable metrics to measure our performance. The central method we use to measure our success is by the number of new customers, in our case veterans, accessing the system. VA Access is built around VA's first ever national advertising campaign. We partnered with the Ad Council and are excited to work with the renowned and award-winning advertising firm DDB on a pro bono basis. We are learning about our customers with extensive quantitative and qualitative research; and kicking off in the weeks prior to Veterans' Day this year, you will start seeing our coordinated campaign on TV, radio, billboards and magazines. That is our perspective on the situation, where we are and where we are going. VA deeply appreciates the continued support of this Committee. On a personal level, I am deeply honored to represent my fellow veterans and help them access the services and benefits they have earned. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sowers follows:] Prepared Statement of Tommy Sowers, Ph.D., Assistant Secretary for Public and Intergovernmental Affairs, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Good morning. Chairman Sanders, Senator Burr and distinguished Members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. Thank you for the opportunity today to discuss the Department's outreach efforts, our approach and major accomplishments, along with emerging initiatives and the way forward. I will highlight successful programs we have already conducted and other programs we will be conducting in the coming weeks, months and year. One important theme of our outreach strategy is the importance of national and local partnerships, which are essential to reach Veterans and their families. VA's three Administrations--Veterans Benefits Administration, Veterans Health Administration, and National Cemetery Administration-- and our central office are working closer than ever to plan, coordinate and integrate meaningful outreach activities across the Department. The 2012 Biennial Report to Congress, submitted earlier today, outlines the outreach activities of the Department. overview Since Secretary Eric K. Shinseki arrived in VA in January 2009, everything the VA does, including outreach activities is driven by a framework based on three fundamental principles; people-centric, results-oriented, and forward-looking. People-Centric: Veterans remain the centerpiece of our effort. As it pertains to outreach, this means VA must address Veterans' changing needs over time and develop strategies that effectively communicates how VA is meeting the needs of Veterans. Results-Oriented: The real measurement of VA's success is the timeliness, quality and consistency of the benefits and services we provide to Veterans and other beneficiaries. Forward-Looking: Seek opportunities for delivering the best services with available resources, continuing to do things smarter and more effectively. VA outreach efforts must leverage the latest technology to reach today's Veterans and future Veterans. Future outreach and services must take into consideration the changing Veteran landscape. VA's approach to outreach is built on three pillars: (1) outreach efforts will be centrally planned with decentralized execution; (2) VA will leverage technology to the maximum extent possible; and (3) VA will maximize partnerships to achieve optimal results. On a daily basis, the National Veterans Outreach Office (NVO), aligned under the Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs (OPIA), provides strategic oversight over VA's outreach efforts and ensures the above three pillars are applied throughout the Department. To accomplish our important outreach mission, and among many other supporting efforts, VA is increasing the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of on-line information available to Veterans, Servicemembers, and eligible beneficiaries. The good news is our outreach efforts are making a difference in the lives of Veterans. The Post-9/11 generation of Veterans is using VA benefits and services at higher rates than any previous group in Veterans in history. Iraq and Afghanistan combat Veterans are eligible, within 5 years from the date of their discharge or release from active duty, for up to five years of free health care. Over 55 percent of returning Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans are utilizing VA health care today. Approximately one million Veterans have enrolled in the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill since its inception. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides enlisted Servicemembers, officers and some family members with up to 36 months of benefits, payment of tuition and fees, a stipend for books, and a monthly housing allowance. Veterans and other beneficiaries are using these benefits to pursue undergraduate degrees, graduate degrees, and non-degree-producing technical certification. VA has also dramatically expanded its outreach to women Veterans. The number of women Veterans using VA health care has increased to 354,000. VA health care for women includes gender-specific primary care such as breast cancer screens; mental health evaluation and assistance for issues such as sexual trauma, domestic violence and parenting; and specialty care including reproductive health care. increasing awareness and access The importance of outreach cannot be overstated. There are more than 22 million Veterans in the United States--and based on the most- recent National Survey of Veterans--less than half are currently accessing any VA benefits. In addition, that same survey revealed almost 60 percent of Veterans know either ``very little'' or ``nothing at all'' about their VA benefits. These statistics present both a challenge and an opportunity. To address this challenge, VA is also moving to more self-service, technology-enabled interactions in order to provide Veterans easier access to information and the ability to execute transactions at a time and place convenient to the Veteran. Closer coordination and synchronization of VA outreach activities and efforts has been instrumental in achieving several major accomplishments during the past few years: VA is working closely with State Directors of Veterans Affairs to ensure their veterans service officers are properly trained to better prepare fully developed claims to reduce processing time. eBenefits enrollment surpassed the 2.5 million point by the end of Fiscal Year 2012--in part due to increased marketing, outreach and closer collaboration between VA and Department of Defense (DOD). Veteran's homelessness has decreased more than 17 percent since 2009 as VA has intensified our national outreach, public communication, public-private partnerships and advocacy work in unison to rescue homeless Veterans while simultaneously implementing prevention programs. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) outreach is integrated with new construction and health service initiatives to better provide access, and serve Veterans as demonstrated through three hospital construction projects, including opening a state-of-the art hospital in Las Vegas--the first in 17 years. Since 2009, VA has added 57 new community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) giving us a total of 840 CBOCs through 2013 and we have increased the number of mobile outpatient clinics and mobile Vet Centers serving rural Veterans to 81. For the eleventh consecutive year, the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) was rated the top customer service organization in the Nation, outperforming major U.S. corporations. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, in 2012 NCA received the highest scores ever attained by a public or private organization. VA's Mental Health outreach is fully integrated with suicide prevention programs to reach Veterans through both traditional and social media to build awareness on how to seek VA help and assistance. VHA's ``Make the Connection'' campaign has been highly successful in getting Veterans to seek assistance and in saving lives. For example, in outreach conducted since November 2011, Web site visits have exceeded 2.3 million, more than 5.7 million on-line views, and 3.8 million impressions on Facebook. VBA has expanded its outreach to U.S. military Reserve Component (Army National Guard, Air National Guard, Marine Reserves, etc.) Servicemembers and their families. This outreach effort is accomplished through six major initiatives: (1) Demobilization Initiative, (2) Individual Ready Reserve Muster, (3) Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, (4) Post-deployment Health Reassessment, (5) Transition Assistance, and (6) OEF/OIF/OND Internet Web page and social media. Since the beginning of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, through FY 2012, VA's Vet Centers have engaged 604,194 OEF/ OIF/OND Veterans, 443,841 of whom were outreach contacts seen primarily at military demobilization and National Guard and Reserve sites. Services include mental health counseling, career counseling and VA service and benefits assistance. Eligible Veterans and family members received Vet Center Services at over 89,000 distinct outreach activities and events. These services include individual and group counseling, marital and family counseling, bereavement counseling, medical and benefits referral and employment counseling. The Department continues to improve its outreach efforts by initiating many new programs such as deploying mobile Vet Centers into rural areas, establishing more community based outpatient clinics and providing mental health crisis line services; increasing visibility through different advertising and marketing campaigns; coordinating communication across VA using consistent messaging; and strengthening partnerships with other Federal agencies, state, city and local governments, Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), Military Support Organizations (MSOs), and other stakeholders who support or assist Veterans and their families in accessing VA benefits and services. va access campaign Shortly after my arrival in August 2012, we initiated detailed planning to launch a new outreach campaign called ``VA Access.'' The campaign launched in January 2013. VA Access is a comprehensive outreach strategy involving all resources within the Department. Its primary objective is to inform Veterans of the care and benefits they have earned and how to access them, for example, using the eBenefits portal. The campaign is a multi-year effort using both traditional and social media communication mediums. VA Access is based on a three key principles. First, Veterans learn best from other Veterans. Second, sustained outreach empowers Veterans and their family members to stay informed of their benefits through important stages in their lives. Third, the life of every Veteran--or their family members--is improved or enhanced by accessing the Veterans benefits they have earned. I will now briefly summarize the major components of VA Access. ``Pro Bono'' National Advertising Campaign. Our flagship project is VA's first-ever national advertising campaign with the New York City- based Ad Council, which is made possible by pro bono contributions of our partners. With our close involvement and oversight, the Ad Council and our pro bono partner have conducted extensive research--including the use of Veteran focus groups--and will create, produce and distribute ads on TV, radio, social media, billboards and magazines. We recently completed our quantitative and qualitative research. Creative development and review, including field testing, will start in May. And the Ads will start running nationally this October. The Ad Council program represents huge benefits to taxpayers and Veterans by maximizing a cost-efficient marketing and advertising program while reaching national Veterans audiences and stakeholders. Social Media Enhancements/Efforts. VA also recognizes the importance of Social Media to reach our audiences. Our online communication presence is now fresh, relevant and Veteran-focused. This past October, we totally redesigned our public-facing Web page (www.VA.gov). Our new web design is more user friendly, intuitive, and features a new look and feel, so Veterans and beneficiaries can better navigate content for their specific needs. We are removing redundant, outdated and trivial information. ``Buddy Program.'' Nearly one in four Federal employees is a Veteran. However, as is true with the larger population, many Veterans working in the Federal Government may not be aware of VA benefits and services available to them. To address this, later this year we will launch a new initiative with our Federal Agency partners. The objective of our ``Buddy Program'' is to inform Federal employees who are Veterans of their benefits, while encouraging them to share the information with other Veterans they know. Veteran Employment Program Offices and public affairs staff can post information about the program on agency intra-net sites--informing participants on how they can enroll in eBenefits or learn more about VA health care programs, they may be eligible for. We are also distributing posters to other Federal agencies to help promote this effort. Veterans Day. As we look toward November 2013, we see the culmination of intensive outreach activities coming together at the perfect point in time--Veterans Day. As our Nation pauses to recognize and thank Veterans, a positive sentiment focused on Veterans fills the air. This presents an incredible opportunity for VA and Veterans groups to join together for a unified call to action to increase access to VA. As we approach Veterans Day, we are asking VSOs to have ``open house'' events and other events focused on getting more Veterans to access the benefits and services they have earned. The stage is set and we are moving forward. intergovernmental partnerships OPIA's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) continues to implement a broad outreach strategy to ensure VA is communicating and coordinating our efforts across all levels of Federal, state and local governments. Over the last two years IGA has established or strengthened its working relationship with the following groups and organizations that represent state and local governments or entities: Governors--National Governors Association (NGA). National Guard Bureau and the State Adjutant Generals. State Directors of Veterans Affairs (NASDVA). State Veterans Home Administrators (NASVH). Council of State Governments (CSG). State Legislators (NCSL). County Elected Officials (NaCo). County Veteran Service Officers (NACVSO). Mayors (U.S.C.M.). IGA has implemented and routinely participates in the following outreach initiatives: Formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the Secretary of VA and the President of NASDVA, furthering VA's commitment to coordinating our efforts with our state partners. Quarterly conference calls with NASDVA to provide VA subject matter experts (SMEs) to address VA priority programs and initiatives. Bi-weekly meetings with the Governors' Federal Representatives in Washington DC to provide information on VA priority programs and initiatives and address VA related issues or concerns. Weekly meetings with White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs to further coordinate our outreach efforts with other Federal agencies with programs impacting Veterans. Annual Conferences for all state and local organizations listed above. Mid-Winter Conferences for NASDVA and NASVH. tribal government outreach In November 2009, President Obama tasked all Federal departments to fully implement Executive Order 13175 on ``Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments.'' VA developed its plan in 2010, Secretary Shinseki signed VA's Tribal Consultation policy in 2011, and the VA Office of Tribal Government Relations (OTGR) was established in OPIA and staffed in 2011. The end result of our efforts is to expand and enhance communications between the Department and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) tribal leaders to improve services to AI/AN Veterans. Outreach activities undertaken by OTGR include: Sponsoring outreach booths at approximately five conferences hosted by Native American advocacy organizations. VA staff gave presentations during conference events and gave updates on VA programs for Native American Veterans. Initiating tribal consultation on programs and services offered by the VA's three Administrations. Tribal consultation events were held in Washington D.C., Anchorage, AK, Lincoln, NE and Denver, CO. Collaborating on tribal consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services/Indian Health Service (IHS) on a draft agreement to facilitate VA reimbursement for direct care services provided by IHS AI/AN Veterans. Hosting meetings in Washington, DC; Spokane, WA; Shakopee, MN; Albuquerque, NM; Grand Ronde, OR; Norman, OK; and Milwaukee, WI with tribal leaders, Veterans and Veteran service providers. Collectively, these sessions drew over 1,000 attendees. Facilitating three listening sessions between VA officials and tribal leaders and Veterans in Bismarck, ND, Billings, MT, and Albuquerque, NM. Drafting a resource guide for tribes interested in integrating aspects of Veterans Courts into tribal justice systems. Sponsoring themed outreach materials in 2011 to VHA Alaska, focused on outreach to Alaska Native communities within the state. Initiating a bi-weekly electronic newsletter for tribal leaders and Veterans in the Midwest. homeless veterans outreach In keeping with President Obama's pledge to honor and support our Veterans, the Secretary of VA established a VA priority goal of ending homelessness among Veterans in 2015. In support of that goal, OPIA's Homeless Veterans Initiative Office (HVIO) authored, with input from all VA administrations and staff offices, VA's Five-Year Plan to End Veteran Homelessness. A vital component of VA's strategy to end homelessness among Veterans is VA's National Call Center for Homeless Veterans (NCCHV), because it serves as the entry portal through which many homeless and at- risk Veterans find out about VA homeless services. NCCHV provides 24/7 access to VA homeless services by phone at 877-4-AID-VET and by online chat at www.va.gov/homeless. In 2011, HVIO launched a multi-pronged outreach campaign urging every citizen to ``Make the Call'' to the NCCHV if they are or know a Veteran who is homeless or at risk of homelessness. The ``Make the Call'' campaign included the following six elements: Outreach awareness and information events in 28 targeted cities across the country in October 2012 to launch the outreach campaign; Outreach that enlisted assistance from national and local organizations that come into contact with Veterans on a daily basis; Assistance from over 2,300 community partners such as soup kitchens, shelters, local government agencies, first responders, and faith based organizations to help share information with homeless and at risk Veterans about VA resources; Four web videos that focused on the roles different professions (social workers, medical professionals, first responders, and legal professionals) can play in connecting Veterans with services to prevent or overcome homelessness. VA is committed to preventing and ending homelessness among Veterans and their families by the end of 2015 and is poised to assist homeless and at-risk Veterans in achieving their optimal level of functioning and quality of life. Outreach is critical to ensuring the goal of ending Veteran homelessness is achieved. As a result of VA's outreach campaign focused on homeless Veterans, calls to NCCHV increased by 123 percent and VA's media activities resulted in over one billion impressions during fiscal year 2012. More importantly, VA helped prevent many Veterans from becoming homeless and helped many others successfully transition from homelessness to having a home and becoming self-sufficient. Today, more Veterans are accessing VA homeless services than ever before. Below are a few specific measures that reflect the success of VA's homeless Veteran outreach activities. From September 2011 to September 2012, calls to NCCHV rose from 36,100 to 80,558. During the same period, there was a 125 percent increase in calls from Veterans seeking assistance to NCCHV, evidence VA is increasingly reaching its targeted population. There was a 334 percent increase in calls from Veterans at risk of homelessness between fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2012. The media campaign resulted in over 1 billion impressions: - Cable television--15 second and 30 second spots: 358,978,000 impressions; - Out of home--posters, transit shelters, bulletins, bus advertising: 230,000,000 impressions; - Radio--15 second and 30 second audio spots: 534,718,000 impressions; - Online display--banner ads: 100,653,568 impressions/80,000 clicks; - Online video share--30 second and 60 second audio/video: 350,000 video views. office of public affairs digital strategy Through the Office of Public Affairs, VA will continue to execute a digital media strategy that is content focused to provide Veterans and other stakeholders relevant and timely information delivered on a variety of platforms. Digital content is available through traditional va.gov Web sites as well as social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and blogs, and other cutting edge platforms. Currently VA's Facebook page has more than 250,000 subscribers, which is more than any other cabinet-level agency. rehabilitative sports VA plans and executes outreach to our wounded, injured and ill Veterans through our rehabilitative adaptive sports programs. In a strategic partnership with the U.S. Olympic Committee, VA grant monies support both national events and local events in communities where our Veterans live. These events not only support rehabilitation, but provide VA an opportunity to educate Veterans about other available programs, benefits and services that could health and overall quality of life. These events also give Veterans opportunities to share information and success stories about VA benefits and services with other Veterans. strategic partnerships Successful Veteran outreach cannot be accomplished by the VA alone. Many Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) and non-profit organizations (NPOs) are making a huge difference in the lives of Veterans. The Ad Council research underscores the importance of ``Vet-to-Vet'' contact and peer influence. Simply put, Veterans trust other Veterans. Therefore, sustaining and building relationships with VSO and NPO groups is crucial to helping inform Veterans and to enrolling more Veterans in VA. The Secretary and I both meet quarterly with several VSO representatives, and VA is now reaching out more directly to NPOs. In those forums, we share information and we are asking the VSOs to help us enroll Veterans in concert with their respective Veteran advocacy roles summary The Department of Veterans Affairs outreach programs focus on increased awareness and access of the VA benefits and services earned by Veterans and their families. We are working to coordinate and integrate outreach efforts across the VA to improve efficiency of resources, maximize technology and social media assets, and improving cooperation with Veterans Service and Non-profit organizations working to assist Veterans and their families every day. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. I am pleased to answer any questions you or other Members of the Committee may have. Chairman Sanders. Thank you very much for your testimony. Let me begin with health care. How many veterans now access the VA health care system? Mr. Sowers. We have 8.9 million enrolled. Chairman Sanders. Who are in the program? Mr. Sowers. That is correct, Chairman Sanders. Chairman Sanders. What is your guess as to how many people might be eligible for the program who are not in it? Mr. Sowers. Well, there are 22.4 million veterans that are out there, Chairman Sanders; and unless they were dishonorably discharged, they are eligible for the program, they are eligible for health care. Chairman Sanders. How many veterans do we think lack any health insurance at all? Mr. Sowers. That is a good question, Chairman Sanders. I will get with VHA to get that precise estimate. Chairman Sanders. You would agree with me that your job is to make sure that every veteran in America, whether or not he or she wants to access VA services, and many do not for whatever reason, know what those benefits are. Mr. Sowers. That is correct, Chairman Sanders. Chairman Sanders. You are dealing with a wide spectrum of folks. You are dealing with people who just left Iraq and Afghanistan, who are very computer savvy. You are dealing with World War II veterans who have never used a computer in their lives. You have a whole bunch of universes out there that you have to access. I am concerned about the older veterans right now, say Vietnam vets. Do you suspect that there are many Vietnam vets who might have, initially when they returned home from Vietnam, had bad experiences with the VA? What is your strategy of reaching out to those veterans? Mr. Sowers. Chairman Sanders, thank you very much for that question. The strategy is multi-faceted. Actually, Vietnam veterans is the larger proportion of veterans on FaceBook but it is going to require more than FaceBook. It is going to require some direct face time as well. Vietnam veterans represent the largest cohort with a membership within the Veterans Service Organizations. So, when I came in, I initiated meetings with the Veterans Service Organizations and non-profit leaders. We have got to reach these veterans by, with, and through some of these partners. I will give you one other example. About a hundred hours ago I was standing in Wales, Alaska, population 145, looking over the frozen Bering Sea. I was standing there with the Alaska State Veterans' Affairs Director, the head of our health care system, and our local tribal veteran representative. In this town of 145, about as rural as you can get, there are Vietnam veterans there that, as you said, may not want these programs; but once we explained it to them in a face-to- face way, we got veterans to sign up. We need those sorts of interactions to occur in rural communities across the country. Chairman Sanders. For the Post-9/11 veterans, the VA is now providing free health care for the first 5 years upon their return. What percentage of those veterans know that? Mr. Sowers. Chairman Sanders, what we have seen is that 56 percent of the 1.5 million Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have utilized VA health care. That is historically unprecedented. We have historically been around the mid-30s. In terms of the Iraq and Afghanistan vets, and what we are finding is that Iraq and Afghanistan veterans especially with the Post-9/11 GI Bill, have sky-high awareness of this incredible program that you all have supported again and again. Chairman Sanders. Let me interrupt you for a second. My time is running out. So, you think we are doing well. Is that because of the TAP program? Has that been important? Mr. Sowers. Chairman Sanders, I believe the improvements to TAP have made positive contributions to it. When I got out, it was more like death by PowerPoint. I have seen the new TAP. It is an improvement from what I went through but we have got to do more. There is a lot of confusion out there between the compensation and care, and that is a message that I have been working aggressively to get out. Chairman Sanders. All right. So, 56 percent does seem to be a pretty high number. Do you think we have done a fairly good job informing the younger veterans about VA health care and that significant numbers of them are taking advantage of that? Mr. Sowers. Chairman Sanders, the numbers are historically high. I just think we have got to do better. I mean, I have run into veterans, smart veterans--one of my buddies is a Rhodes Scholar who injured his shoulder in the service and did not yet know about the 5 years of free health care. So, it is something we have got to continue to work on although we are seeing historically high numbers. Chairman Sanders. I think you have heard from all of the members the importance of working effectively with State, local government, and non-profits. Say a few words about what you are trying to do in that area. Mr. Sowers. Chairman Sanders, it is vitally important and within my office is the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. The memorandum of understanding signed with the National Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs is absolutely important. When I travel around to the States, when I was in Ohio, I met with Tom Moe. He told me about the unique, innovative programs that they are doing in Ohio. When I was in North Carolina, it was Tim Wipperman there who told about the unique programs that they are doing there. We know that the best solutions are not all coming out of DC, that they are at the local level where we are seeing great solutions. Part of that memorandum of understanding is working with that organization to recognize and understand the best practices so that we can spread those out across the country. Chairman Sanders. OK. Senator Burr. Senator Burr. Dr. Sowers, welcome. I covered the numbers that VA provided for me for the 5-year period, the $83 million. However, it is my understanding that NVO and OPIA is currently unable to provide the information that I requested which is updated cost information and projections as part of the questions for the record for the 2014 review. Is that true? Mr. Sowers. Ranking Member Burr, I will inquire about that, the specific question that you asked. I know for our outreach efforts we have a specific number that we are tracking for what NVO spends on outreach. Senator Burr. Let me ask on behalf of the Committee if you would provide those numbers for us and as well the metrics that you discussed in your opening statement that you have created to monitor it. [The information requested during the hearing follows:] Response to Request Arising During the Hearing by Hon. Richard Burr to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Question 1. What is the Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs outreach budget for FY 14? Response. The National Veterans Outreach Office outreach budget for Fiscal Year 2014 is $4,000,000.00. This amount supports a more aggressive VA outreach plan, which includes the first iteration of an Ad Council national advertising campaign. These professional advertising services will enable the Department to conduct a national advertising effort designed to increase awareness among Veterans and family members regarding the breadth of services available to them and how to access those benefits and services. Question 2. What is the metric VA is using to assess the effectiveness of VA's outreach campaign? Response. The metric established for outreach is new access to one or more of VA's programs. Access is defined as a Veteran, family member, or a Servicemember who enroll, register, and/or use one or more VA benefits and services. The access baseline is the number of unique individuals who have accessed VA in FY 2012. New access is defined as an individual accessing VA who was not found in the system in FY 2012. The data was extracted from VBA, VHA, NCA and VA's e-Benefits portal. In order to track and measure VA access, a reporting process was established and approved by the VA Chief of Staff in December 2012. On a monthly basis, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA) provide data within their respective areas of responsibility to the VA Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) to process and determine new clients accessing VA. The period for tracking and measure new access to VA for FY 2013 is October 1, 2012. Senator Burr. I would agree with Chairman Sanders that 56 percent is an awfully good number, and I think it begs us to stop and ask, what is different about those separating from the current conflicts from the population that is more of a traditional VA population, that they might be so much better informed about the VA. I think probably we could all point to social media as a tremendous tool which begs the question, that if we agree that it has had a major impact on the ability of veterans to become aware of the benefits that are available to them, why all of a sudden the departure to a $4.3 million advertising campaign, which I sort of look at from a standpoint of it being traditional and social media being the 21st Century mode of communication? Mr. Sowers. Ranking Member Burr, that is a great question. I see this as a combined arms campaign. You have got to be in the air. You have got to be on the ground. You have got to be where the veteran is and the time, tone, medium, and frequency that they care about. I will give you an example of how we are using social media to reach out. The Make the Connection Campaign is a campaign that started in June of last year. Senator Burr. Make no mistake. Clearly, you are doing social media effectively. So, tell me what the theme and what your expectations are of a $4.3 million advertising buy. Is it to actually increase the reach or is it to be a little bit more high-profile relative to the effort? Mr. Sowers. Ranking Member Burr, thank you for that question. You know, a key thing about this campaign, if you are referring to the Ad Council campaign, it works on donated media and it works on pro bono work from the advertising firm. Some folks, as we heard earlier, they want to receive mail. They want to receive things, you know, that they can feel and touch. Some folks want to see the messages on TV. The great thing about working with the Ad Council and the pro bono firm, DDB, is that they bring to us decades of research on how to effectively message across a wide variety of medium. So, it cannot just be social media. That will be part of the campaign but it will not be the entire part. Senator Burr. So, is there a matrix that has been developed to determine whether this effort produces the predicable results? Mr. Sowers. Ranking Member Burr, the key metric that we are using is the number of new customers accessing the VA. After my arrival, we started tracking that for the first time, enterprise-wide. You know, I am a customer of three products of the VA from two different Administrations; and so now, on a month-to-month basis, we know the number of new customers that are coming into the VA. This year is the key one, where I can level set and get a sense of the exact matrix and how it flows, which months we see a higher intake versus others. When we kick off this campaign in October, we will have a very clear idea with a full year of already counting exactly how many folks are coming into the VA. Senator Burr. Last question. The initiative the will kick off in October. How many, if any, outreach programs were terminated and replaced by this program? Mr. Sowers. Ranking Member Burr, I can get back to you with a distinct answer. I see this as an additive program; but I will go back and check the history of it, of exactly what was replaced. Senator Burr. Since you have taken over, have we terminated any outreach programs? Mr. Sowers. Ranking Member Burr, I will get back to you on the specifics of that. Senator Burr. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The information requested during the hearing follows:] Response to Request Arising During the Hearing by Hon. Richard Burr to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Question. Have any VA outreach programs been canceled since August 2012? Response. The Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs has not canceled any outreach program. Chairman Sanders. Senator Tester. Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your service, Mr. Sowers. Thanks for being here today. I want to talk a little bit about partnership with volunteers particularly as it applies to rural America. I was encouraged to see the vets program which is under the Department of Labor and their initiative to provide outreach to unemployed veterans in rural area. It is critically important that we get a better idea of what services particular veterans need to utilize to get back into the work force. So, from your perspective, can you speak to any initiatives launched by the VA to partner with various community groups to expand care or services to rural America? Mr. Sowers. Senator Tester, thank you very much for the question. As you know, I am a rural vet. I grew up in a town of 13,000 and there was no VA facility there. But what is in my hometown is a VFW post. There is an American Legion post. There are a number of VSOs that have their boots on the ground in those communities. So, what I initiated when I came to VA was, I need to speak with the communicators of these organization. So, on a quarterly basis we bring these veterans service organizations and non-profits in, and we bring them in not just to talk but to listen. What we did, for example, on the Web site is instead of just revealing the Web site and saying, tah-dah, here it is, we brought in the VSO and non-profit leaders to ask what do you need, how can we do this better, how can we communicate with you. Rural veterans, we know, are online. So, there is an online portion to it, yet there is also an on-the-ground component. One thing that has happened in the last few years is the expansion of our mobile Vet Centers. I love the Vet Centers. They are a phenomenal, low threshold way that people can access VA. But the mobile Vet Centers have taken the show on the road. Just as we are going to be able to deploy them to Boston tomorrow, they predominantly focus on rural areas where we do not have a VA facility. It brings counselors; it brings people that know about the benefits to that area. Senator Tester. I want to talk about something the Chairman has been an advocate of for some time now and this is community health centers. The VA announced steps to partner aggressively with local providers such as community mental health centers. OK. But there has been, I think, a lack of communication and collaboration between the VA and the private providers I talked about in the previous hearing, as a matter of fact, to deliver care at local access points. It has been an issue for a long time. What steps can be taken to improve the communication and collaboration between the VA and actual local health care providers, whether it is mental health or otherwise? Mr. Sowers. Senator Tester, thank you for that question. I have seen it work in a couple of different ways. One is the veterans' crisis line that you may know about. It has registered 700,000 calls, 26,000 saves. At that center when they receive calls from wherever they are coming in, they immediately connect with the local providers, whether that is law enforcement, whether that is the mental health providers. They connect that call through the VA to the local provider. The second one is what I just saw in Alaska. Since Secretary Shinseki's visit in 2011, we have expanded our sharing agreements with local tribal authorities that provide health care. So now, both tribal veterans and non-veterans can go to a local facility and receive that care instead of having to fly to Anchorage. Senator Tester. Well, you are the point man on intergovernmental affair. Can you talk about conversations that are going on within the government between, for instance, you, the VA, and Health and Human Services? Indian Health is another one. You talked about that just a minute ago. Is there a conversation at this level that is being bled down to the ground so that the folks on the ground--so you can work between agencies? Mr. Sowers. Senator Tester, it is a great question. An example is the partnership that we have had with the Indian Health Services. So, that does not just require the VA to communicate out to the veterans but Indian Health Service to communicate out to their local providers as well. So, we have been at the same table as we are forming the policy in partnership and then we both take our lines of operations. Senator Tester. Anything with HHS, Health and Human Services? Any conversations, any partnerships there? Mr. Sowers. Senator Tester, right now we are working closely with HHS on information about the Affordable Care Act to make sure that veterans are informed and understand some of the changes that are moving forward. Senator Tester. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Senator Brown. Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Sowers, on the second panel one of the witnesses said in his prepared remarks that there are more than 40,000 organizations, overwhelmingly non-profits, working with veterans. I do not really even know what to recommend on this. Is there any effort or thought or are there plans for VA to sort of have a registry of them to work with them to try to get them--there are some that work cross-purposes. I mean, one group I would worry about is the for-profits, some of the for- profit colleges and university that tend to run up debt for students, veterans and non-veterans alike. Is there reason for you to manage these or try to manage these or is there an ability to do that with all these non- profits out there, most of whom would generally want to help veterans but do not really have much coordination one with the other? Mr. Sowers. Senator Brown, it is a great question. When I was in Ohio with Tom Moe, we had a roundtable meeting with a lot of the local providers there. I think it would be very challenging for us and I am not sure I would want to manage or attempt to manage---- Senator Brown. I might have used the wrong word. Is there, I mean, tell me about the relationships. How do you look at many of these 40,000? Is there any coordination or advice you give them or anything you can do to sort of make them perform better, if that is the case? Mr. Sowers. So, Senator Brown, there are a few things that we have done on this. One is I have sent periodic outreach to Veterans Service Organizations and non-profits to get an understanding of the solutions that they are delivering at the local level. I think a very key set of relationships we formalized is in the case of the State veterans' affairs directors and then working with the counties and cities as well is working through our local veterans' leaders in those communities who know the solutions, who know the local providers. Part of my interest is to make sure that the great solutions that are happening, VetCounts being a perfect example which you are doing in Ohio, that the lessons that are being learned there are shared. So, surfacing those best practices, we are getting those right now through the Association of State Directors. Senator Brown. OK. Thank you. I mentioned in my opening statement about 870,000 veterans in Ohio, not many more than half can Ohio State government actually identify by name and location and all of that. What do you do with States like Ohio? I mean we have 88 county Veteran Service Organizations. We have, as all of us do, many VSOs that are doing terrific work. How do we reduce that gap so we know where they are, so the State government can communicate with them and let them know of the VA education, health care, homeless services--all of those? Mr. Sowers. Senator Brown, thank you very much for that question. We have got to do that, you know, we cannot manage what we cannot measure. And having a clear understanding of where the veterans are, what their demographics are, is a key to any outreach campaign. So, you are going to start seeing some changes through the VA's Web site. For example, when you come to it, it is going to ask you for your zip code and where you are at. That way we can start customizing messages to veterans of specific regions. But a key thing I have heard from the States, and we want to deliver, is data on who we are tracking and who they are tracking and getting a good sharing between the two so that we can close that gap. Senator Brown. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Sanders. Thank you. Let me ask one last question. Tell me if I am right on this one. VA standards and eligibility requirements often change. If I have 20 percent disability and my income is X and next year my income is Y, I may at one point be eligible and the next point not be eligible. Is that a barrier in terms of access to health care that maybe somebody applied and were, at the time ineligible. Then, 3 years later the standard may have changed. Is that a problem for the VA? Mr. Sowers. Chairman Sanders, that is a challenge because, as you mentioned, there were veterans that maybe left the service 20-30 years ago when the VA was an administration and not a cabinet level department. It offered different benefits and services. So, again it is one of the key things of why a campaign like VA Access is critical, to ease the ability of saying this is what the current benefits are. We want to drive people to this site and make the site--we made it more user friendly. We want to continue in that trend. Chairman Sanders. There is another issue and I wish I had the book in front of me. It looks like a huge telephone book. But in the State of Vermont, which is a rural State, and incomes and cost of living are different in certain parts of the State, we have one county next to another county; and your income eligibility is different. So, if I am earning X dollars in Y county, I might be eligible in that county but not another. Does that create problems for VA? Mr. Sowers. Chairman Sanders, I would say anytime there is a change in requirements, there is some messaging that needs to go with that. That is why we want to bring in some of the best practices of the private sector here. Chairman Sanders. In this case, I am not just faulting the VA. I am faulting maybe us as well. If people know what they are eligible for and are not in all kinds of different levels, it might be easier for the average veteran to say, ``yes, I can walk in the door,'' rather than having been rejected and never coming back again even though he or she may now be eligible. That was my point. It was not a criticism of VA. But when I see a telephone book for eligible requirements based on different incomes in the State of Vermont, frankly it does not make a whole lot of sense to me. Senator Burr, any other questions? Senator Burr. No. Chairman Sanders. OK. Dr. Sowers, thank you very much for your testimony. Mr. Sowers. Thank you. Chairman Sanders. We will have the next panel come up please. Panelists, thank you very much for being with us. I think what we all recognize and what we have heard from this Committee and from Dr. Sowers is that we cannot do our job or the VA cannot do its job unless it is done not only by a strong outreach effort by VA but also by private non-profits as well and other government agencies. The goal is to bring all of the players together and I know all of you without exception have been actively involved in that. We thank you very much for the work that you have done. We want your ideas as to how we can improve upon what we do, how we can make the cooperation between the VA and your organizations stronger. Let us begin. I am delighted to welcome Wendy Spencer, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service. Wendy, thanks very much for being with us. STATEMENT OF WENDY SPENCER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SERVICE Ms. Spencer. Thank you so much, Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Burr, I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. I also want to thank both of you for entrusting me with the honor of serving as the CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service. I began about a year ago so I am very excited to be in my new role. We at CNCS share your commitment to serving our veterans and military families. Personally as a wife, a daughter, granddaughter, and even a stepmother of men who served in four branches of the military, this is very personal to me and it is a priority. Meeting the needs of our veterans and military families is a national challenge. National service, what we do, is an innovative, cost-effective, and proven solution to this challenge. We are a grant-making agency built on public-private partnership. Each year we generate an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in private and other outside resources. We recruit, mobilize, and manage 80,000 AmeriCorps members, 330,000 Senior Corps participants, and an additional 4.5 million community volunteers. Through our vast network of grantees and partners, dedicated Americans serve in 70,000 locations across the Nation. They are in schools, faith- and community-based organizations, non-profits, many of which you are familiar with like Habitat for Humanity, Points of Light, American Red Cross, The American Legion Auxiliary, Catholic Charities, and thousands more. National servicemembers are taking on some of our Nation's most pressing problems, including supporting veterans and the military family community. Our commitment to veterans and their families is deep and it is actually two-fold. We serve them and we ask them to serve with us. Those strategies are proving to be tremendously beneficial and have great results. National servicemembers serve at hundreds of VA clinics and hospitals, at Veterans Service Organizations and non-profits. They are connecting veterans to job opportunities, helping them access their benefits, providing peer counseling, mentoring their children, and more. Last year, our program served more than 1.5 million veterans and family members in every State in the country. Veterans themselves also bring unique skills and leadership to solve problems at home. National service actually gives our veterans a new mission on the home front, a pathway to opportunity if you will, and a better transition to civilian life. Last year, more than 27,000 veterans served in our programs. In fact, many of our programs are vets helping fellow vets which we find very successful. In Washington State, for example, the Governor appointed the Commission for National and Community Service and the State's Department of Veterans' Affairs to join together in 2009 to launch an AmeriCorps program called VetCorps. VetCorps is made up of veterans or military family members. They serve full-time to support veterans enrolled in public colleges across the State. In fact, every public college. They take their fellow veterans by the hand and assist them with every aspect of their transition. Their mission is to never leave a veteran behind and to help them succeed in college and in life. I am pleased to report that it is working. Last year, 31 AmeriCorps members in VetCorps served 7,100 veterans. Nine out of every ten of these veterans served reported to us they had better understanding of how to navigate college and use their VA benefits. Early results show us that VetCorps members have substantially boosted the number of veterans on track to graduate from college, a goal that we all share. In conclusion, let me tell you about Mike Bremer. Mike is an Iraq war veteran who served in AmeriCorps as a member of an all-veteran fire team in Colorado. Mike said, and these are his words, ``When I returned from Iraq with the Army infantry, I felt like I lost all meaning and purpose in life and I had trouble finding meaningful work. My AmeriCorps experience gave me new purpose and a valuable new skill set. I received incredible training and experience through AmeriCorps.'' I am pleased to share with you today that Mike now has a full-time job as a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service. I called Mike yesterday to tell him I was going to share his message with you, and he is doing quite well. Mike found his new mission and we know what ours is. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Burr, we are poised, ready, committed, dedicated to work with each of you and each Member of this Committee and the VA to serve our veterans and their families as well as they have served each of us. We hope you will consider national service as an important part of the solution. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. As a moment of privilege, I would like to thank my colleagues here, grantees and partners in the room, and especially my senior advisor for veterans issues, Koby Langley, who is an Iraq war veteran, Bronze Star Recipient, and served as a former Command Judge Advocate who is advising me and helping us grow services to veterans and the military family. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Spencer follows:] Prepared Statement of Wendy Spencer, Chief Executive Officer, Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Burr, and Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am Wendy Spencer, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). I have had the privilege of serving in this role since April 2012, following my nomination by President Obama and unanimous confirmation by the U.S. Senate. I thank the Members of this Committee for your faith and confidence in me and for this honor you have entrusted to me. I have forged my career in volunteer management and administration over the past three decades. Prior to this appointment, I served as CEO of the Florida Governor's Commission on Volunteerism and Service under Governors Bush, Crist, and Scott, and am therefore honored to be the first CEO of CNCS to come directly from the national service field. I am also honored to be the first in this position to testify before this full Committee. I was grateful for your invitation and am here today because CNCS shares your commitment to serving our veterans and military families. As a Nation, we are tasked to meet the needs of the 1.5 million servicemembers hanging up their uniforms for the last time and transitioning to civilian life in the next five years, as well as the military families who have borne so much of the burden during the long and protracted years of war. The good news I have to report is that Americans have answered the call to serve in countless ways to support our military service men and women, veterans, and their families. As the Obama Administration's Joining Forces initiative makes clear, this is not a challenge for government, alone; it is a challenge for all of us who live safer, freer, and more secure because of the sacrifice of these heroes. National service is an innovative, cost-effective, and proven solution to this challenge. During my testimony, I will discuss who we are, our commitment to our Nation's heroes, and how national service is poised to play an even greater role in helping our returning servicemembers and their families transition back to civilian life. about the corporation for national and community service CNCS is a Federal agency that engages millions of Americans in service each year through our signature national service programs, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps, and innovative programs such as the Social Innovation Fund and Volunteer Generation Fund that take community-based solutions to scale. We also lead the President's national call to service initiative, United We Serve. Our programs bring human capital to America's civic infrastructure. This includes more than: 80,000 AmeriCorps members; 330,000 Senior Corps volunteers; and 4.5 million community volunteers recruited, managed, and mobilized by our national servicemembers and call to service initiatives. We are unique in that we are a public-private partnership. We work with a vast network of grantees and partners to get things done in communities across the country. And we generate the investment of hundreds of millions in private and non-CNCS funds every year. Through our AmeriCorps and Senior Corps programs, dedicated citizens of all ages and backgrounds are serving hands-on and in many cases full-time at 70,000 locations nationwide, including schools, faith- and community-based organizations, state and local public agencies, and venerable nonprofits such as Points of Light, Habitat for Humanity, American Red Cross, United Way, Catholic Charities, and the American Legion Auxiliary. Every day, these national servicemembers tackle complex societal challenges on the ground, such as helping youth stay on track to graduate; fighting poverty; responding to disasters; restoring parks; bringing life back to forgotten neighborhoods; and connecting veterans and military families to the services they need and the benefits they have earned, which is the challenge that unites us here today. It's working; we see results of national service each and every day. National service is based on the idea that our Nation's greatest asset is our citizens. When Americans are civically engaged and empowered, no challenge is insurmountable. That is why CNCS is proud to lead the Federal effort to support, strengthen, and scale America's volunteer sector through national service, and help address some of the most pressing issues facing our Nation. national and community service commitment to veterans and military families As the Members of this Committee and the witnesses of this panel know, one such pressing national issue is meeting the needs of our transitioning military and their families. I am the wife, daughter, granddaughter, and stepmother of men who have served our country in four branches of the military, so this is very personal to me and I understand the challenge. Further, this generation of American veterans presents new challenges which are uniquely served by national servicemembers, volunteers, and fellow veterans and military family members. The bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act of 2009 (Serve America Act) was landmark legislation that focused national service on key national priorities, including veterans and military families. In the spirit and the letter of the Serve America Act, the CNCS 2011-2015 Strategic Plan set goals, strategies, and objectives to support the veteran and military family community. Our commitment to veterans and military families begins in large part by who we choose to lead our efforts. In 2011, we chose a two-tour combat veteran of Kosovo and Iraq, and the recipient of the Bronze Star, Koby Langley, as Senior Advisor for Wounded Warrior, Veteran, and Military Family Initiatives at CNCS. Koby has served our country with distinction as a public servant in the Army, as a special assistant to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and most recently as a senior executive in the Department of Defense (DOD) where he advised on wounded warrior and transition policy, led in the interagency development of the Veterans Job Bank, as well as the first ever DOD wounded warrior employment initiative. Today, our investments in supporting the veteran and military family community have never been stronger. Our commitment to this community is twofold. We directly serve veterans and their families through national service, and we recruit and enroll veterans and their families to serve in national service programs. We have seen success on both fronts. Serving Veterans and Military Families Through National Service Our AmeriCorps members and Senior Corps volunteers, serving at the community level, are the face and helping hands of a grateful Nation. These national servicemembers serve at hundreds of Department of Veterans (VA) Affairs facilities, including clinics, community centers, and 80 hospitals; veteran service organizations; and nonprofits such as Blue Star Families and Operation Homefront. They perform a wide range of service activities on a daily basis to support veterans and their families, including raising awareness of benefits among veterans and helping them navigate the application process; connecting them to critical wellness and support services such as legal assistance, health care, job training, and affordable housing; or providing transportation to the nearest VA hospital or other medical appointments, to job counseling or interviews, and to take care of personal needs by running household errands. Examples of our grantees in action include: Metropolitan Community College in Omaha, Nebraska, which utilizes the anti-poverty, capacity-building arm of AmeriCorps-- AmeriCorps VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America)--to help veterans and their families transition from a life in the military to a life in the classroom. The VISTA members have set up resource guides and a Web site specifically for student veterans, compiled a list of faculty members with military experience, and facilitated the student veterans' transition to the local community through service events such as the September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance. The city of Raleigh, North Carolina, which places two AmeriCorps VISTA members at the Raleigh Business and Technology Center. These VISTAs wrote, submitted, and were awarded an $851K grant from the North Carolina Department of Transportation and the Workforce Development Commission. The grant supports a cross-sector collaboration with the largest solar panel company in the state, providing veterans access to a 144-hour Solar Electrical Technician Certification Course, a Lineman Certification Course, a 200-hour pre-apprentice program, and support with transportation and job placements. This partnership is creating a pathway to education, green jobs, and transportation assistance for approximately 200 veterans. The LifeBridge Veteran AmeriCorps program in West Virginia, which provides peer-to-peer mentoring, life and job skills training, information and referral services, as well as financial literacy guidance to veterans, homeless individuals, or those at risk of becoming homeless. The program has been critical to helping fill gaps in resources for the state's veteran population. Last year, AmeriCorps members serving in the LifeBridge program drove documented increases in job skills among the population they served, recruited hundreds of volunteers, and provided direct support services to 200 members of the veteran and military family community in West Virginia. Through these and other programs, last year approximately 1.5 million veterans and military family members across every state were impacted by the service of AmeriCorps members and Senior Corps volunteers. Since implementation of the Serve America Act over the past three years, CNCS has awarded national service grants to more than 240 organizations in more than 400 communities across the country to serve the veteran and military family community.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ A complete list of veteran and military family-oriented grantees supported since 2010 is provided as Appendix A to this testimony. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- CNCS and our national service programs are developing good ideas, promising practices, and effective programs and initiatives that make a meaningful difference for veterans and military families and taking them to scale. This includes: The Community Blueprint, which began as collaboration between AmeriCorps VISTA members working with the American Legion Auxiliary, and has since grown into a multi-state initiative led by our grantee, the Points of Light. Operation Honor Card, which has solicited and documented pledges of 25.8 million hours of service by Americans in support of veterans and military families. Operation Honor Card is a joint project of the CNCS, Blue Star Families, American Red Cross, Points of Light, and ServiceNation. With more than 22.4 million of these service hours having already been served, Operation Honor Card has raised awareness of the strength and challenges of our servicemembers and represents the commitment of communities and citizens nationwide who have come together to assist veterans and military families by writing letters of appreciation, sending care packages, hosting donation drives, organizing welcome home events, feeding homeless veterans, tutoring and mentoring military children, and much more. A new partnership with Delaware Governor Jack Markell, chairman of the National Governors Association, and the National Guard Bureau, which will place AmeriCorps members in Delaware and locations across the country as part of Joining Community Forces. The partnership will strengthen National Guard support services for guardsmen and their families at risk of homelessness, joblessness, or otherwise in need of economic stability assistance by providing access to AmeriCorps VISTA members for all 54 states and territories. I was proud to join the Governor and Senators Carper and Coons last month to announce this partnership. Recruiting and Enrolling Veterans and Military Families in National Service National service is also a unique and effective way to tap the talent and leadership skills of veterans to solve problems at home. More than 17,000 veterans have served in AmeriCorps since its inception in 1994. And last year alone, more than 26,000 veterans served through Senior Corps. Veterans bring the skills they acquired in the service to continue serving on the homefront through AmeriCorps and Senior Corps--responding to disasters, building homes, mentoring at- risk youth, and supporting other veterans and their families. Veterans of all ages have demonstrated a desire to serve their country both in and out of the service and this continues to be true for our youngest generation of veterans. A landmark report by Civic Enterprises found that younger veterans are eager to continue serving, and that veterans who volunteer have more successful transitions home than those who do not.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ All Volunteer Force: From Military to Civilian Service. Civic Enterprises. Published November 2009. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is proven true in national service programs. In a recent VISTA member exit survey, 80 percent of members reported that their participation in national service helped them reconnect with community activities in civilian life.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ VISTA Member Exit Survey: September 2011-November 2012. Survey results and testimonials of veterans serving in VISTA are provided as Appendix B to this testimony. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Further, our national service field research shows that veterans and their families are more likely to accept assistance offered by an individual affiliated with the military than a well-intentioned civilian,\\4\\ so this distinctive national service model--Vets helping Vets--has seen tremendous success. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Understanding the Involvement of Veterans and Military Families in National Service. A field assessment report prepared for the Corporation for National and Community Service by Westat. February 2013. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Examples of our grantees in action include: The Washington state Vet Corps, an innovative program launched in 2009 by the Washington Commission for National and Community Service and the Washington Department of Veterans Affairs, which engages veterans and military family members in AmeriCorps to support and boost the graduation rates of student veterans enrolled under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Last year, the 31 members in Washington's VetCorps served 7,100 veterans across the state. Nine out of every 10 (93 percent) of the veterans they served reported that, because of VetCorps, they better understand how to use their VA benefits and how to navigate the college environment. And early results show that VetCorps members have substantially boosted the number of veterans on track to graduate from college. Formative nonprofits serving the veteran community such as the Mission Continues, Service Nation, and Team Rubicon, which have leveraged national service to expand their service model and to highlight veterans as civic assets and leaders in their communities. For example, after a 20 year military career, Ernest ``Cal'' Verdin is now an AmeriCorps VISTA member serving as a Regional Director of Team Rubicon. In response to Hurricane Sandy, Cal led the volunteer management efforts in Rockaway, New York, which included approximately 300 Team Rubicon volunteers and 10,000 community volunteers in recovery efforts over a five-week period. The Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA), which in partnership with the National Guard Bureau's Prevention, Treatment, and Outreach Program, launched its own VetCorps to fight substance abuse, addition, and other challenges facing returning veterans. According to the DOD Millennium Cohort Study, 22 percent of National Guard members were problem drinkers and 29 percent had financial problems. The CADCA VetCorps program places AmeriCorps members, particularly military service personnel and veterans, in CADCA's substance abuse prevention coalitions throughout the country to mitigate these problems. More than 100 AmeriCorps members will deploy to support returning guardsmen and reservists as they face behavioral health challenges. The Southwest Conservation Corps, which provides opportunities for veterans to serve as team leaders maintaining and responding to wild-fires on national lands, and launched an all- Veterans Fire Corps in 2010. As an AmeriCorps member in the Corps, Mike Bremer worked in three districts of the San Juan National Forest and for the New Mexico Bureau of Land Management. He showed stellar performance and leadership, was recognized nationally as Corps Member of the Year, and was promoted to a crew leader--a precursor to his now full-time job as a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service. Mike explained, ``When I returned from Iraq with the Army Infantry, I felt like I lost all meaning and purpose in life and I had trouble finding meaningful work. My Corps experience gave me new purpose and a valuable new skillset. I received incredible training and experience alongside other veterans who had similar experiences--we were all looking for a new life after war.'' Through these and other programs, national service engages veterans and their families in a new mission on the home front. Recognizing the unique skills and leadership abilities of America's veterans, as well as the benefits of national service to veterans and military families, CNCS and our network of grantees have stepped up our efforts to recruit these heroes to serve in our programs. We have partnered with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation to participate in more than 50 ``Hiring Our Heroes'' job fairs across the country. Additionally, a number of AmeriCorps grantees, including Teach for America, Volunteers of America, the Washington Conservation Corps, and the St. Bernard Project, have launched veteran recruiting efforts for their AmeriCorps positions, and in some cases reserved positions specifically for veterans. national service works for veterans and military families National service works for veterans and their families. It is an innovative, cost-effective, and proven solution to many of the challenges facing our Nation's heroes, from accessing benefits and services to utilizing the Post-9/11 GI Bill to reintegrating to civilian life. As referenced earlier in this testimony, CNCS has provided historic levels of support to the military community in recent years. Yet we have still not fully realized the potential of national service to meet this pressing need. As the Federal agency charged with expanding impactful, community-based solutions to serve veterans and military families, we are poised to do more to continue and expand our efforts to serve and engage veterans. CNCS' unique value is a ``triple bottom line'' return on investment: National service benefits those who serve, those who are served, and the larger community and Nation. We have: Capability: We are the only Federal agency with access to such a vast network of grantees, community-based partners, national servicemembers, and volunteers that improve the lives of Americans every day. Authority: The bipartisan Serve America Act gave us the authority and expectation to expand services to veteran and military families and coordinate activities with the VA and other Federal agencies. Accountability: CNCS is committed to the highest level of accountability through oversight of our grantees and national service participants, as well as by using performance measures and evaluations to ensure that our programs have real and quantifiable impact. Ability to Leverage Non-Federal Resources: Our grants to nonprofits, schools, and other community-based organizations are often required to be matched with funding from local, private, and non-CNCS partners. And our national servicemembers mobilize millions of community volunteers alongside them. The success of CNCS and our national servicemembers is beyond measure in both the lives of the individuals and communities they serve and those who commit to serving. We recognize that servicemembers, veterans, and their families face unique challenges and we believe CNCS has a cost-effective model efficiently serving many of their needs. We also understand there is more to do and know that with a fully funded interagency service Corps, we could provide support services to even more servicemembers, veterans, and their families. An example of this is FEMA Corps, a partnership between CNCS and FEMA that created a specialized unit of AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps. This partnership is projected to save FEMA and taxpayers more than $60 million per year. Additionally, CNCS and the Department of Education launched School Turnaround AmeriCorps to place AmeriCorps members in persistently underachieving schools across the country. With these models we are in discussions with several Federal agencies--including VA--to help them accomplish their mission through national service. The CNCS commitment to veterans and military families has never been greater, and we stand ready to do more. We look forward to working with this Committee, the VA, and other partners across every sector that are committed to serving our veterans and their families as well as they have served us. Again, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. ______ Appendix A.--Nonprofit and State-Based Initiatives Supported by the Corporation for National and Community Service Serving Veterans and Military Families American Red Cross Oregon Trail Chapter WA State Employment Security Department Vermont Student Assistance Corporation St. Bernard Project Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska AMVETS Career Center Great Basin Institute CA Dept.
