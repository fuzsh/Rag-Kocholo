EDITORIAL – THE CHURCH MUST CONFRONT A CULTURE OF LAZINESS, IRRESPONSIBILITY AND SELFISHNESS:\n\nDr. Calvin H. Sydnor III\n\nThe 20th Editor of The Christian Recorder\n\nI read a news story in the newspaper about Prime Minister David Cameron’s thoughts about the 2011 summer riots in Great Britain. He went on to say, “Britain must confront a culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness that fueled four days of riots.” I thought about the United States and about negative news accounts that I had read about events in Somalia and other places. I thought Prime Minister David Cameron’s comments about the “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” are applicable to the United States; and probably applicable to every other country around the world.\n\nThen I thought…\n\nDon’t go there!\n\nAnd then I wondered if the same phenomenon of the “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” has infected churches. It seems that many denominations are abandoning the biblical precepts of right and wrong. Even, some conservative denominations are debating the existence of Adam and Eve, salvation, the authenticity of the Bible. Biblical principles, which used to be sacrosanct, are no longer sacred. The biblical authority of the Word of God does not seem to concern people. Even in the Roman Catholic Church, priests and nuns openly question the decisions of the archbishops, bishops, and even the Pope.\n\nI wonder if the same phenomenon of the “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness”; and other maladies has contaminated the church universal, also known as the holy catholic church.\n\nI am going there, but I want to go here first\n\nI wonder of the phenomenon of the “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness”; and other maladies have contaminated some in the African American community. Poverty does things to people and the African American community has its share of poverty. A lack of education is the quickest route to poverty. In many of the African American communities, we are only a “cop-beating” away from the kinds of rioting that happened in Great Britain.\n\nOften on Sunday mornings I arrive at church feeling a little down because driving to church I pass by “majority” churches whose parking lots are full and they seem to be bursting at the seams. And then I arrive in the “hood” and our churches are struggling and I see unchurched young people and adults hanging out. They seem to be a lost generation. The church provides feeding programs, outreach ministry, health fairs, and revivals; some people participate, but it just seems that in many of our communities we have lost a level of “faithfulness and commitment…” Parents have a responsibility and I wonder if we have reverted to a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness.”\n\nI know that you are not going there!\n\nAs I was reading the article, I wondered whether the African Methodist Episcopal Church has experienced some of the phenomena of the “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness”; and other social and religious maladies.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron, in the same speech, talked about the need to reverse the “slow-motion moral collapse” taking place in Britain. It caused me to wonder if, we in the AME Church need to reverse any “slow-motion moral collapse” that might be engulfing us.\n\nI wonder if churches, in general, are in a “slow-motion moral collapse.” Moral disintegration, individually or collectively doesn’t happen overnight; moral failure happens over a period of time; most often gradually.\n\nFor example, marital infidelity does not start with adultery; it starts with a touch, a wink, a comment, and maybe with a bit of humor; sometimes innocently, and sometimes, unintentionally.\n\nChurches are open to moral failure when they ignore biblical principles, overlook unethical behavior, abandon the moral high-ground, cease to stand for what is right, discard ethical and moral principles, refuse to follow its own rules and regulations, accept the standards and characteristics of the secular world; and fail to understand their biblical, theological and denominational underpinnings.\n\nChurches have to stand for something. Baptist churches are big on baptism by immersion, closed communion, and some are reluctant to recognize women in ministry. Roman Catholic Churches are highly liturgical and it requires its priests in the United States to be celibate. Missouri Synod Lutheran Churches are theologically conservative. Pentecostal churches are conservative; speak in tongues as evidence of the presence of the Holy Spirit. Independent Churches of Christ do not use musical instruments in their worship services. The Episcopal Church is highly liturgical and celebrates the Eucharist every Sunday. The United Methodist Church is characterized by its Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the lives of those who seek to be followers of Christ. Apostolic Pentecostals rejects the Trinity and instead embrace the anti-Trinitarian doctrine of “Oneness Theology.” Bishop T.D. Jakes, and denominations that have “Apostolic” as a part of its name, embrace “Oneness Theology.”\n\nSo, whether we agree or disagree with other denominations, at least we know, generally know their fundamental beliefs.\n\nI am “going there!”\n\nI wonder if the AME Church is in a “slow-motion moral collapse” or in a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” and do people, especially our members, know what we stand for and know our fundamental beliefs. What would be your response if someone asks you “What is the African Methodist Episcopal Church and what are the AME Church’s core beliefs?” Most often what I have heard and I have even responded myself when asked that question by explaining that we are a Methodist denomination founded by Richard Allen and that “African” remains in our name because our founder and early leaders were men and women of African descent; we are Methodist by doctrine; and we have an episcopal form of governance and thus we are African Methodist Episcopal.\n\nI wonder if we really know who we are; and if we don’t know who and whose we are, we just might be headed to a “slow-motion moral collapse” and we might be experiencing a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness.” Are we more excited about the politics of the Church than we are about the biblical and theological foundations of the Church?\n\nAre we teaching our people about the foundations of our Zion? I get a queasy feeling in my gut when I hear people quote, “Faith without works is dead” because I get a notion that they might not understand prevenient grace and might be taking James 2:17 out of context.\n\nFor instance, are we careful and diligent in teaching people that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, not by any other acts of redemption (getting something in return for something) such as good deeds? Salvation is a gift from God. Do we understand the notion of prevenient grace; that it is the available gift of God, which precedes human decision? Prevenient grace allows us to choose the salvation that God offers us through Christ Jesus. And there are other core beliefs in Methodism such as the Trinity, Baptism, Holy Communion, Free Will, sin, salvation, and our responsibility to evangelize the world.\n\nAre our pastors preaching and teaching the difficult biblical passages and are we, as a denomination, forthright in preaching and teaching about what is right and what is wrong. Have our pulpits become desks of timidity. Are we, as a denomination, champions of good behavior and of doing the right thing?\n\nEvidences of a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness”\n\nWhen I visit churches that need serious maintenance update, I wonder if we are succumbing to a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness.”\n\nWhen a congregation allows its pastor to go to the annual conference without a full budget, I wonder if some of our churches have become infected with a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness.”\n\nI wonder about churches whose stewardesses and stewards are too busy to accompany the pastor when he or she visits the sick and shut-in members.\n\nI wonder if some of our church officers have become infected with a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” when they fail to function in accordance with The Discipline.\n\nI wonder about trustees who are content to let the church fall into disrepair, who won’t take the time to change a light bulb. I have visited some churches and half the light bulbs in the sanctuary were burned out and that tells me that, that church has trustees who have succumbed to a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness.”\n\nI wonder if choir members have become infected with a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” when they fail to attend choir rehearsal and show up late for worship; or fail to attend worship.\n\nI wonder if some of our clergy have become infected with a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” when they become discouraged and fail to give their best ministry in “tending to the flock.” I wonder if we are experiencing a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” when pastors fail to develop challenging sermons. Yes, pastors can become discouraged and “weary in well-doing.”\n\nThe “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” is exhibited in many ways. For instance, stewards are responsible for the pastor’s salary and some churches are still giving the pastor his or her check on Sunday after church. Sundays should not be a payday; that’s “old school” technology.\n\nIn churches where there is not a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness,” the Steward Pro-tem and the Board of Stewards take the initiative to set up a program of direct-deposit to pay the pastor. Pastors should not have to stand around to wait for their paycheck like day workers; they should be about the business of the church. Pastors should be treated as professionals. Other “fulltime” local church employees should be paid by direct-deposit and treated as professionals too; and when they are treated as professionals, it’s expected that they will act like professionals.\n\nIf our Zion is going to grow, we must rid ourselves of the “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness” and rid ourselves of any semblance of “slow-motion moral collapse.”\n\nThe “fathers and mothers” of the African Methodist Episcopal Church left us a legacy of excellence. Look at the elegant structures they built, that many congregations struggle to maintain. Look at the system of ministry and administration they put in place. Read the history of the educational institutions the AME Church established. Look at the impact the AME Church and the AME clergy had on the Civil Rights’ Movement. Look at the global contributions members of the African Methodist have had upon society.\n\nWe have a proud legacy and the AME Church could not have prospered with a “culture of laziness, irresponsibility and selfishness.”\n\nThe AME Church was able to do what it did because we have had a “culture of hard work, dependability, consistency, and selflessness” - Let’s keep our Zion on the path of a “culture of hard work, dependability, consistency, and selflessness.”\n\n2. “YOU ASK”:\n\nBishop Richard Allen Chappelle\n\n- (1) “I Ask” –\n\nI attended a dinner with some a couple of AMEs in Manhattan on Monday and one, a long-time AME, shared an account of The Decalogue at a church he attended last Sunday, and if almost anyone else had told me the story, I am not sure that I would have believed them.\n\nHe said the preacher got up and led The Decalogue, or at least my acquaintance thought it was The Decalogue. The pastor had the people to stand and sing, \"From all that dwells ...” And then re-read the scripture that he had read before the preface to The Decalogue; and instead of going through any portion of The Decalogue, he read the I Corinthians 13 passage about love. - - - “Love is not puffed up ...\" And then, he continued, \"And he said to him, ‘You shall LOVE the Lord your God ... And the second is like it, you shall LOVE your neighbor as yourself.’\" He emphasizes LOVE twice! Then, surprise of surprises! The preacher said to the congregation, \"Turn to somebody, look them in the eye, and say, 'I love you'\"! And, with that, he led the \"Gloria Patri.\". And that's how the congregation knew that they were through with The Decalogue. Some people were looking in amazement and others apparently thought it was cute.\n\nMy question: Do AME Preachers have the “license” to change The Decalogue and other parts of the worship liturgy just because they want to do so? Do pastors have anyone to provide pastoral oversight? Are preachers trained about liturgy and about AME worship? It seems that changes are taking place and no one is telling congregations why they are making changes.\n\nJames O. Davis\n\n- Bishop Richard Allen Chappelle’s Response to the Question:\n\nNo, AME Preachers do not have license to change the Decalogue and other parts of the worship liturgy just because they want to do so. However the rubric of our worship services specifically states that there can be some substitution/additions of items.\n\nThe Book of Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Church 2008,\n\nPage 483 Section I, Order of Morning Worship reads as follows: Our order of worship is intended to be flexible so as to provide for richness and variety of content. At the same time it must have unity as to insure that all members of our church will feel at home in any AME Church. For this purpose, we present a basic form of worship within which our ministers MAY MAKE (my emphasis) such ADDITIONS (my emphasis) as NEEDED FOR THEIR OWN (my emphasis) situation.\"\n\nThere tends to be a gross misinterpretation of \"to have the option to MAKE ADDITIONS as NEEDED\" (my emphasis) in at least two areas\n\n(1) As in the narrative as stated above, you cannot substitute anything for the Ten Commandments/Decalogue; literally that is what “Decalogue” means.\n\nIn the place of the Decalogue it is permissible to have a litany or the Te Deum.\n\nWe approved the abridged and unabridged Decalogue.\n\nThe statement, “Our Ministers may make...for their own situation” is grossly misunderstood. While the pastor is the chief worship leader, he/she may have has been assigned to a pastoral charge, which has its own peculiar style of worship. The pastor is the “last word” at the local church until the quarterly conference. Pastors inherit and are nurtured an organizational structure that has a central organization called the Official Board. It would be in the best interest of the pastor and the local church if he/she would discuss/explain, get consensus on additions, deviations, etc., the pastor intends or contemplates making in the order of worship and even if he or she would like to make modifications in the some administrative procedures. The local church does not belong to the pastor; it is not his/her church, but the parishioners’ church and the pastor as the “shepherd” should have the decency and common sense not to \"spring surprises\" which often shows disrespect for the collective wisdom of the official church family.\n\n- (2) “I Ask”\n\nOver the years I have at various times been a member of the standing “Lobby Committee,” composed of both clergy and lay. At various meetings when the Committee learns that actions have been taken that it felt should not have or that actions have not been taken that it felt should have, the reaction is that “It’s the system.” How would you explain or have someone outside of African Methodism understand what is meant when we conclude with “It’s the system”?\n\nDr. McDonald Williams\n\nBishop Richard Allen Chappelle Note: I have combined Dr. McDonald Williams’ question with several questions sent in about presiding elders who require churches to provide additional funds beyond the “Annual Conference Committee on Presiding Elder Apportionment.”\n\nBishop Richard Allen Chappelle’s Response to the Question:\n\nFirst, let me acknowledge that there are indeed influential Lobby Committees. It is however, unfortunate that this wealth of skills, knowledge and expertise seldom get to be heard in open forum. It is interesting that many members of the Lobby Committee(s) have held positions of leadership within our Zion up to and including the highest levels as elected delegates to General Conference, the Board of Incorporators, General Board, Commission members, Connectional Officers and even Episcopal, Conference and Local Church officers. Seldom if ever have we individually voiced strong and vocal opinions in forums for all to hear and respond. I would hasten to say here our lack of active involvement except in the Lobby is also \"Part of the system.\"\n\nThe clause to which you refer \"It's The System\" is really not unique to African Methodism as is being implied. There is a \"system\" in place in every organization. Some might be more subtle, nebulous, refined or crude depending upon the makeup and nature of the institution. The system is tantamount to the process and procedure utilized and adhered to at any given time within the body politic of the entity in question. Further, functioning “systems\" tend to operate utilizing Newton’s “Laws / explanations\" of motion. (1) In the \"system\" every action or lack of action produces an equal and sometimes devastating opposite reaction (2) a body/proposal at rest be, it idea, revelation, vision, etc., shall remain at rest until acted upon by an outside force. (3) A body/act in motion, an activity involving motion shall continue to move (be espoused) until stopped by some outside force.\n\nOne of the best analogies which might help us in an understanding of \"It's ‘The System’\" could be found in the observation and examination of a wrist or pocket watch (with moving parts). The actions of a watch are a thing of beauty to behold. It is designed with all of its various parts calibrated to complete a specific function (to keep/measure/tell time). The watch is composed of wheels, gears, teeth, stems, springs of various shapes and sizes. Some of these parts are used only to calculate seconds; - others minutes, hours, and in the latter days even the days of the month. The placement of the various parts causes them not to move at the same pace or all in the same direction. The manner in which they have been delicately placed requires that they be somehow synchronized. The parts have been put together to perform a purpose and in the case of the watch/clock, to calculate time accurately. If perchance the watch is wound too tight or not tight enough or some of the intricate parts fail to interact or specifically touch properly there will be a malfunction of the \"time keeping system.\" I don't know of any (mechanical) watch designed to correct itself. A master watchmaker has to correct the internal flaws of \"the system.\"Therefore, one could surmise that a watch (the system) could be constructed which could be flawless save for the involvement of human error and or manipulation. Thus I would suggest that perhaps the reference to \"It's the system\" has more to do with manipulation than with human error/judgment.\n\nI note that Dr. Calvin H. Sydnor III has in recent articles done a masterful job alluding to \"The System.\" His had a thorough discussion of the role of Presiding Elders. He highlighted some of the wheels/gears in our Presiding Elder system. If you will permit me I will try to weave three seemingly different questions into one which might better help us understand. There are several questions: (1) How does the Presiding Elder function if he/she is also a pastor of one or several churches on the District? (2) What effect could that have on morale, accountability, etc? (3) How could a Presiding Elders holding mandatory training local church officers’ session and charge a fee? (4) How could he/she hold sessions related to background checks and charge $40.00 mandatory registration? (5) This raises the legality question of charging fees and acquiring funds beyond the allocations as set by the Annual Conference Committee on Presiding Elder Apportionment.\n\nI contend that the answer to your question being explained to someone outside African Methodism by what is meant by \"It's the system,\" might be clarified by use of a Judicial Council truism: They refuse to hear, respond to or deal with hypothetical situations. While I have not received further documentations concerning the questions/complaints raised about what has happened, I take the position here that these things are actualities.\n\nHolding mandatory training sessions for Local Church Officers; mandatory background check sessions of church employees, volunteers and those who work with children at a fee of $40 per person; holding of Presiding Elder and pastoral appointments simultaneously during the conference year. By addressing the issues related to what might be transpiring on several Presiding Elder Districts I could actually highlight “It’s The System.\" Thus it is felt that we can better address the issue of \"It's the System\" from this perspective.\n\nDr. Sydnor was correct in his explanation and understanding of the duties and responsibilities of a Presiding Elder as per discipline. We differ slightly in some of our assessments. I hasten to say I have never held the position of Presiding Elder. I further acknowledge having tremendous respect for the office of Presiding Elder. I have known some great Presiding Elders of African Methodism: The Rev. King Solomon DuPont, the Rev. R.N. Snelling, the Rev. James A. Roberts, the Rev., Sylvester A. Cousin, and the Rev. D.A. Russell all who served in Florida. However in my personal estimation the greatest of these Florida Presiding Elders was the Reverend J. B. Blake, who found me out at Fellsmere, Florida with nineteen members on the roll and when he was finished with me, in 1976, I became the second General Secretary in the history of the denomination and in 1988 a bishop of the Church. I got to know others like the Rev. J. Allen Parker and the Rev. W. D. Johnson, 4th, the Rev. B. L. McCormick and the Rev. John D. Walker, 10th, the Rev. R. L. Hilson and the Rev. Sam Davis, 9th, Z. L. Grady and B. J. Finklea, 7th, E. D. Williams, L. M. Lumzy; the Rev. Earl James, 8th, the Rev. S. E. Lancaster; the Rev. William Ricks, 3rd; the Rev. Harvey L. Vaughn. Sr., 5th; the Rev. L. B. Quinn and R. A. Washington, 5th; the Rev. L. J. (big) Jones, and the Rev. B. C. Carswell 6th; the Rev. Willie L. Freeman, the Rev. T. E. Harper and the Rev. George Sims 1st; the Rev. Sidney Williams, the Rev. Nathanial Gaylord, 2nd; the Rev. William H. Hunter and J. J. Brown 12th; the Rev. Elmer E. Martin and the Rev. J. C. Miller 13th; and countless others.\n\nThe A.M.E. System affirms that the office of Presiding Elder is extremely important. No one can become a Presiding Elder except by the appointment of a Bishop of the church. The duties and responsibilities are clearly spelled out in our Book of Discipline. Of utmost importance is the fact that the Presiding Elder specifically is acting on behalf of the Presiding Bishop. The process and procedure of the Church gives and authorizes the Bishop to select the most experienced and best qualified person (s) as Presiding Elder. However, as a lay person, pastor, General Secretary of the Church and an active Bishop for 20 years; I have observed that many Bishops did not take this admonition seriously. I have personally seen numerous persons who had proven more than once to be incapable of successfully pastoring churches, promoted/elevated to the office of Presiding Elder. This has not necessarily been the norm but it has and is happening. The end result manifests itself in many incidents which routinely happen on presiding elder districts and in annual conferences.\n\nSuffice it to be said that when a Pastor, Presiding Elder, Bishop is appointed he/she automatically inherit the \"whole field.\" What he/she does with \"the field\" after \"timely and proper cultivation / training etc. is his/her responsibility. The system gives authority to do this. Conversely the system gives authority to \"make adjustments\" in personnel as needed but utilize the proper process and procedure.\n\nIn this case the individual to whom we refer is the Presiding Elder who is the direct representative of the Presiding Bishop.\n\nWhat does this imply? It implies that according to the system of the Church, the Church has assigned the Bishop to superintend the work. He/she is ultimately responsible and accountable for everything under his/her jurisdiction. Annually at the Council of Bishops and every four years at the General Conference each Bishop is required to give an account of his/her stewardship. At the General Conference, the Bishop is not permitted to present witnesses i.e., District Accountants, Treasurers, Presiding Elders, etc. but he/she stands alone before the Episcopal Committee and present his/her quadrennial report for examination.\n\nTherefore, if in fact the local congregations and Annual Conferences are being abused by the Presiding Elder, they are conversely being abused by the Bishop because it is the Bishop who has given this person authority to act of his/her behalf and with his/her consent. It is the Bishop's responsibility to monitor what his/her representatives are conveying to the congregations and pastors. You may “shake it” otherwise; however, I contend that this is a correct reading and understanding of the “AME System. It was designed and programmed to operate a certain way with the proper checks and balances in place.\n\nThe entire \"approved support package\" for Presiding Elders spiritually, financially and morally is clearly delineated in the Book of Discipline. (1) It is to be done at the site of the Annual Conference by vote of the Conference. (2) by law he/she is further authorized to hold a pre and post planning meeting (3) by law he/she has the authority to hold annually a District Conference and Church School convention (4) by law he/she is compelled to hold four quarterly conferences per year at each charge. These authorized meetings amount to total of eight (8) delegate (mandatory) assembly meetings per year per church with and for the presiding elder.\n\nWhen one factors in the Annual Conference/Episcopal District i.e., Annual Conference, Episcopal pre and post Planning meeting, Christian Education Congress, Special Evangelism or Convocation meeting these mandatory delegate assemblies add a total of six (6). When added to the 8 mandatory meetings of the presiding elder, the total number of \"other\" meetings required totals a minimum of fourteen (14) per church per year.\n\nThe Episcopal District/Annual Conference/Presiding Elder District have authority to hold this many mandatory meetings per year. It would appear that those who plan and program should incorporate and utilize those venues, dates and times as the system dictates and not make efforts to create additional venues, dates, time lines and financial asking.\n\nThe system as set up by the Fathers allows for interaction between the local congregation and the presiding elder four times, individually, so that they could confer and collaborate on the unique situation at each charge in a \"smaller group\" setting. The smaller group setting is the \"answered prayer\" of most educators. The “Fathers of the Church” (they were all men at the time) made provisions for larger group combination settings at the Annual Conference, District Conference and Church School conventions, pre and post Planning meetings and Convocations. “The Fathers” considered these as adequate times for interaction and teachable moments. It is my understanding that funding for the original mandatory meetings have already been factored in by the Annual Conference Committee on PE Apportionment.\n\nTherefore, the meetings and finances of the same have been previously approved by the annual conference. The designated committees at the pre and post meetings have formulated the agenda/topics which could reach beyond the disciplinary requirements for consideration at the meetings. It is further understood that time and activities during the Quarterly Conference are also teachable moments for the PE and members of the local church/Quarterly Conference.\n\nIt is my understanding that there have always been ample times and places stipulated for training, teaching, etc in the system for local churches. Plus, it is mandated that the local pastor shall be responsible for the training of his/her cabinet. The questions raised indicate poor planning and the possibility of presiding elders abusing their authority i.e. (1) The PE has ignored the prevailing system (2) set out to formulate his/her own system, which is alien to African Methodism (3) Taken to making assessments/asking without due authority (4) acting and interacting without the blessing and approval of the bishop he/she really represents. (5) in reality the PE has manipulated the AME System. (6) Theses examples are classic evidence that there is a prescribed “system” in place. It also reveals those who would by thought, word or deed, commission or omission manipulate \"The System(s).”\n\nWe are all aware that there is a system and systems within the system which must be allowed to function properly otherwise we are willfully ignoring the consequences of our actions or lack of actions. As with the clock/watch, if left to run as it was built to run, it would be accurate and dependable. But when you physically (deliberately) stop the fly wheel and (deliberately) change the speed of the pinwheel and (deliberately) manipulate/tamper with the winding stem (whether by omission, commission, thought word or deed) to change the hour, date, and second hand, it has no choice but to show the designated manipulations that will be readily noticeable when compared with other time pieces.\n\nThe fact still remains that the systems we have are the: General, Annual, District, Quarterly, and Church Conferences. We have the Commission System: General Board, Departments, and Commissions. We have the Judicial Administration/System. I contend that it is the best set of systems available.\n\nEvery four years opportunities are available to make course corrections and other adjustments to the binding system. It is a good system. “It's the system!”\n\n3. REPORT FROM THE 32ND BIENNIAL SESSION OF THE CONNECTIONAL LAY ORGANIZATION:\n\nBy John Thomas III\n\nThe 32nd Biennial Session of the Connectional Lay Organization (CLO) of the African Methodist Episcopal Church was held from August 14-18, 2011 in Detroit, Michigan. Over 1100 delegates, alternates and observers gathered to participate in business and Christian fellowship under the leadership of CLO President Willie C. Glover (3rd) and General Board Lay Commission Chairperson Bishop C. Garnett Henning. The 4th Episcopal District hosted the meeting under the guidance of Senior Bishop John R. Bryant and Episcopal District Lay President Madge White.\n\nOrganized activities for the Biennial began on Saturday August 13th with several cultural and historical excursions around Detroit available for early arriving delegates. Additionally, the 4th Episcopal Young Adult Lay members sponsored a welcome event. Sunday August 14th was packed with the normal organizational particulars of any large-scale convention.\n\nRegistration, First Timer’s Orientation, Committee meetings and the final Executive Board meeting of the 2009-2011 Biennium were the orders of the day. The Connectional Lay Economic Development Corporation (CLEDC) held their annual board meeting introducing their new CEO Dr. Vera Bradley (5th). The opening worship service under the direction of Bishop McKinley Young featured the participation of a cross-section of active and retired Bishops along with the Lay leadership of the AME Church. The 4th Episcopal District Choir under the direction Connectional Music and Christian Arts Ministry Chair the Rev. Anthony Vinson is to be commended for using a creative blend of contemporary and traditional music throughout the service. Bishop Henning delivered the sermon entitled “Team Commitment” (I Corinthians 3:16-17. The message charged those assembled to reevaluate their commitment to the church and following the teachings of Jesus Christ. After the service closed, the various Episcopal Districts adjourned to their meetings.\n\nThe 32nd CLO Biennial officially convened on Monday August 15th. The early morning devotion service featured the Rev. Rodrecus M. Johnson (3rd) speaking on the topic “Choose Life” (John 10:10). After the service, preliminary organizational matters and a greeting from Congressman John Conyers (D-Michigan), the keynote address was delivered by Retired Congresswoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (D-Michigan). An active member of Oak Grove AME Church in Detroit, Ms. Kilpatrick charged the laity assembled to live up to the social justice principles on which the AME Church was founded. The afternoon business session opened with a presentation from Mercy Ships followed by the Presidential Address. After being presented by his home District President Ms. Ametta Reeves (3rd), Dr. Willie Glover rendered an expansive accounting of his service over the last two years followed by a detailed video presentation. The report was duly received with accolades and praise by the assembly. After the lunch recess, the General Conference Candidates’ Forum sponsored by the V-Alert Committee was held in order to provide laity with an opportunity to learn more about those seeking election to the Episcopacy, a General office or the Judicial Council. The two hour session was filled with revealing and thought-provoking answers from the candidates to the questions raised by the panel. Following the Forum, the assembly adjourned for the host District Reception. Interspersed with the Motown musical flavor were greetings from various city dignitaries. Following the reception, several committees met and the Episcopal District Young Adult Representatives had their Annual Retreat.\n\nTuesday August 16th began with the morning service featuring the Rev. Elaine P. Walters (4th) preaching an electrifying sermon entitled “We Can’t Stay Here, God is Calling Us to Go!” (Matthew 17:18 and 28:18). After the devotional, CLO Director of Lay Activities Edith Bartley Cartledge introduced the first intensive plenary session: “Perspectives of the African Methodist Episcopal Church: Past, Present and Future”. The Panelists were as follows: Past—Dr. Jayme Coleman Williams, the Rev. Dr. James Miller (4th), Bishop John Adams; Present— Mr. Kgosi Monaisa (19th), Bishop Adam J. Richardson, the Rev. Dr. William Watley (6th); Future—Mr. John Thomas III (13th), Bishop Jeffrey N. Leath, the Rev. Raymond Bryant (5th).\n\nThe panelists engaged in an entertaining and enlightening discussion of the challenges facing the AME Church as it seeks to fulfill its mission in a changing world. Specific mention was made of the issues facing educational institutions, social justice, financial accountability and relevance. A highlight of the panel took place when Dr. Isabel Medina of the Dominican Republic Annual Conference (16th) addressed the panelists in Spanish and Mr. Thomas responded to her in her native language to the assembly’s surprise.\n\nThe next plenary was “Transitional Leadership” featuring the Rev. Dr. Floyd Flake (1st). Rev. Flake used his vast experience in both the ministry and the political world to discuss leadership and motivational strategies. So much was the desire to glean from Rev. Flake’s knowledge, that an additional session was scheduled to dialogue further with one of African Methodism’s clergy giants.\n\nThe Third Plenary Session was divided between two topics: “Building a Successful Lay Organization” (Presenters Gloria Byrd (6th) and Herbert Mngadi (19th)) and “Motivating Emerging Leaders for Christ-Centered Leadership” (Panelists Karabo Links (15th), Dr. Kris Marsh (2nd), Rev Councilman Andre Spivey (4th), the Rev. Dr. Reginald Blount (4th) and moderator Darrel Thomas (4th). While the latter panel was geared towards Young Adults, both panels had a sizeable attendance with a mixed crowd.\n\nAfter the intensive training sessions, the delegates had a three-hour break to prepare for the Jesse L. Burns Black Tie Soiree. The attendance of the immediate past CLO President made the event especially unique. Spearheaded by 2nd Episcopal District President Valerie Bell and CLO Assistant Recording Secretary Doris Bell, the event highlighted the CLO commitment to AME institutions of higher education as $45,000 was raised through ticket sales and donations for Paul Quinn College in Dallas, Texas. In addition to the fellowship and fine dining, the attendees were blessed by the musical talents of The Beverley Thomas Fine Arts Institute Choir and the LaShaun Gary and Friends band. Mr. Michael Blake, Associate Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs for the White House brought words of encouragement and praise. After the banquet, attendees were treated to more musical delights via the Beverley Thomas Choir, Mr. Adrian Dunn, Positive Force and the headliner Kurt Carr and Singers. No stranger to Connectional AME audiences, Kurt Carr delivered an exemplary performance treating the audience to well-known favorites and sneak previews from his upcoming album.\n\nOn Wednesday, the morning started with a devotional featuring the Rev. Cindy Carr (3rd) preaching from the topic “What’s Fueling Your Fire?” (Philippians 4:1-6). After the discussion, the business of the Biennial began in earnest with an aggressive and daunting agenda. The morning session was consumed with the reading of the Constitution and Bylaws navigated by the capable leadership of Chair Ethel Wallace-Jenkins (1st) and Vice-Chair Starr Battle (2nd). The business adjourned for the noon-day Young Adult Explosion. Feature a mix contemporary and traditional praise and liturgy, the service culminated with the preached word from the Rev. Dr. Joseph Cousin (4th). He preached from the topic “When the Church Gets Together” (Matthew 18:18-20). Presentations were made to the CLO Director of Lay Activities, CLO President and retiring Episcopal District YARs. The business session resumed after lunch with a series of briefings from AME-SADA and the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA). After a heated and spirited debate, the 2011-2013 budget was adopted. The assembly then adjourned to prepare for the Outstanding Layperson of the Year Banquet. Mrs. Starr Battle Mrs. Beverly Nutall (10th) served as the Mistress of Ceremonies and Mrs. Starr Battle (2nd) delivered the keynote address. The 2011 Biennial Lay Person of the year was Dr. Verma Curtis (6th) and Mr. Jai Ingraham (11th) won the inaugural Ted Harris Young Adult Award. The following scholarships were awarded:\n\n- Dr. Jayme Coleman Williams Scholarship:\n\nAlexander Davis (13th)\n\n- Dr. Joseph McKinney Scholarship:\n\nRachael Richard (11th)\n\n- Mr. J.D. Williams Scholarship:\n\nNot Awarded\n\nAfter the banquet, the Biennial reconvened to finish consideration the budget in an expedited session.\n\nFriday morning began with a devotional featuring the Rev. Eddie L. Harris from the topic “Can’t Nobody Do me like Jesus” (Jude 21-25). The final business session began with committee reports and the final disposition of Mr. Alphonso Times (7th) Director of Public Relations. After a lengthy debate, the Biennial upheld the Executive Board’s recommendation to remove Mr. Times from office. Committee reports were received and the assembly adjourned to the Centennial kick-off luncheon under the guidance of Dr. Paulette Coleman and Mr. Bill Ayers (2nd).\n\nThe 32nd Biennial Session of the Connectional Lay Organization ended on a high note. The passage of the extensive Constitution and Bylaws revision will chart the course of the CLO for decades to come. Stronger logistical support and clearer agenda priorities were needed, however, as delegates were frequently seen rushing to from events and due to activity overruns and overlaps.\n\nThe compressed manner in which the business of the organization was transacted combined with lack of secret balloting caused further concern.\n\nSeveral essential agenda items—most notably review of the proposed CLO legislation for the 49th General Conference—were deferred until the Fall Executive Board meeting.\n\nIt is hoped that future Biennials will improve upon these issues. The 4th Episcopal District superbly hosted the event and set the bar high for 6th Episcopal District in 2013 and other future hosts.\n\nThe AME Church needs a well-trained and capable laity now more than ever.\n\nPrayerfully, the CLO will live up to the mantle placed upon it.\n\n*John Thomas III is a Ph.D candidate at the University of Chicago\n\n4.

DAILY MINUTE MEDITATION – “THE BEST WEAPON”:\n\n*The Rev. Gloria Sydnor Smith, Esq.\n\nEphesians 6:12 (NIV) states, \"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\"\n\nTurn on the news to see the destructive consequences of evil in the world. There are, however, some things that you won't see. You won't see the evil forces that are operating behind the scenes in the unseen spiritual realm.\n\nHow do we deal with invisible evil? We speak the Word of God (Bible scriptures). Spoken Scripture is our weapon against invisible evil forces. When we speak it out, good things happen. When God made creation, God spoke it out, and God declared that it “was good” (Genesis 1).\n\nCreate your own existence in this world by speaking the Word of God, it's the best weapon you have.\n\n*The Rev. Gloria Sydnor Smith, Esq. is the pastor of Whitman Chapel AME Church in Belpre, Ohio\n\n6. MID-WEEK MEDITATION ~ BASED ON ISAIAH 1:1-18:\n\nDr. Joseph A. Darby\n\nThose of us in my high school class decided that since most of us were turning 60 years old this year, we'd have a joint birthday party a couple of weeks ago. In addition to doing poor impressions of teenagers that would have embarrassed our children, we also reflected on how things have changed since our high school days - how there are no more big black rotary phones in every house, how LP records are now ancient technology, and how hard it is now to find a bottle of \"white out!\"\n\n\"White out\" was an essential in the days before typewriters were replaced by word processing programs. If you were typing and made a mistake, you had to stop, find the \"white out,\" brush some on the mistaken text, wait for it to dry and then type over it - which wasn't easy because it sometimes left lumps on the paper. Today, one only has to backspace, delete and retype, and every trace of a typed mistake is gone for good.\n\nWhat computers can now do to correct mistakes is similar to what God's grace does for us. None of us are perfect and we all make our share of mistakes, but God rescues us, and delete our mistakes through the grace of the Christ who died for our sins.\n\nIt's easy to dwell on our mistakes, play games of \"what if,\" and wish that we could do some things over again. What matters, however, are not our mistakes but the marvelous way that Jesus can eradicate them and bless us not because of who we are, but in spite of who we are. Be encouraged and count on Christ, even when you mess up. Trust and find comfort in the God who told His rebellious people, \"Though your sins be a scarlet, I'll wash them white as snow.\" God will turn your mess into a blessing.\n\nIf this has been a blessing to you, feel free to share it!\n\nGet Ready for Sunday!\n\nJoin us for Holy Communion worship at 7:45 am and 11 am on September 4. The Combined Choir, Gospel Choir and Morris Brown Mass Choir will offer praise.\n\nSunday’s Scripture Lessons are:\n\nDeuteronomy 4:32-38\n\nActs 4:1-10\n\nMatthew 9:1-8\n\nMorris Brown AME Church Sunday’s Sermons are:\n\n7:45 am – “Celebrate God’s Power”\n\n11:00 am - “Move By God’s Power”\n\nSee YOU in church, and have a great week!\n\nThe Rev.

Shawn Menchion mentioned in the article is an AME Itinerant Elder endorsed by the African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nby Maj. Don Kerr\n\nAir Force Academy Public Affairs\n\n8/18/2011 - JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Two Air Force Academy chaplains and two cadets attended the 116th annual Jewish War Veterans Convention in Jacksonville, Fla., Aug. 9-13 to discuss the Academy's religious respect program and give JWV members some insight into the life of a Jewish cadet here.\n\nJewish Chaplain (Maj.) Joshua Narrowe and Protestant Chaplain (Capt.) Shawn Menchion represented the Academy's Chaplain Corps at the convention. Cadet 2nd Class Jolie Grossman from Cadet Squadron 23 and Cadet 3rd Class David Harris from CS 11 also attended to provide their perspective as cadets.\n\nChaplain Narrowe began his presentation by pointing out to the audience some of the unique dynamics at the Academy for the more than 1,100 new cadets each year.\n\n\"When they enter the Academy, as cadets they are expected to understand the military and Air Force cultures,\" Narrowe said. \"Then they learn about Academy culture and, more specifically, the Cadet Wing culture. This all happens within about six weeks. In terms of religious respect, we have two training opportunities for these new cadets, where they learn about their First Amendment rights and the importance of understanding religious respect.\"\n\nThe chaplain said the Academy makes an important distinction between respect and tolerance. Here, cadets are expected to respect each other regardless of their particular faith or non-faith, which goes beyond mere toleration.\n\nThe Academy offers a variety of programs to accommodate services and discussion groups for all walks of faith, including Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists and members of Earth-Centered religions. Chaplains encourage interfaith discussions among cadets and provide opportunities for cadets to learn and grow from regular interactions with people whose faiths they may never before have encountered.\n\nGrossman brought a unique perspective to the group as a product of a mixed-faith childhood in California; her mother was Catholic and her father was Jewish.\n\n\"In true California fashion, they taught me the importance of being not only tolerant, but respectful to all,\" she said.\n\nA junior, Grossman answered questions from the JWV on the religious atmosphere at the Academy and rumors of possible anti-Semitism.\n\n\"Throughout basic training and my time as a cadet, I haven't been treated any differently than a Christian would be,\" Grossman said. \"I have been allowed to miss training events in order to attend services and allowed to leave campus to observe holidays because the Academy recognizes that religion helps people get through tough times.\"\n\nShe went on to share some of her experiences at the Academy, such as being selected as the master of ceremonies for a Holocaust luncheon and traveling to Israel with U.S. Naval Academy midshipmen and U.S. Military Academy cadets.\n\nHarris explained that the Academy does has a \"zero-tolerance policy on being intolerant\" and said he felt positive about his experiences as a Jewish cadet.\n\n\"I have never been approached by someone who has attempted to sway my beliefs,\" Harris said. \"So where is the unwelcoming environment of anti-Semitism that I was warned about? In my opinion, it doesn't exist.\"\n\nThe chapel staff publishes an interfaith calendar with religious holiday entries as Notices to Airmen, which are distributed to the entire cadet community, Menchion said during a briefing on the principles of the Academy religious respect training program.\n\nThe program focuses on First Amendment protections, religious rights, fostering religious dialogue, respecting human dignity and practicing moral courage.\n\nThe Air Force Academy is the only U.S. military academy with a religious diversity program, Menchion said. He talked about the Academy's leadership model and how it builds and evolves to different levels throughout a cadet's four years of education and leadership training.\n\n\"The training is not only designed to introduce cadets to new religions and faiths, but to teach receptiveness and having an open mind to other faith religions and beliefs,\" Menchion said.\n\nHarris sought to put to bed the rumors of an atmosphere of intolerance.\n\n\"In my experience, the atmosphere of the Academy is one of respect for everyone. And I am proud to say that I am indeed a Jewish cadet at the United States Air Force Academy,\" he said.\n\nThe Jewish War Veterans National Convention was headlined by retired Army Gen. Eric Shinseki, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, and Army Maj. Gen. Emmitt Titshaw.\n\nThe event is designed to update its members on military affairs. It is composed of Jewish U.S. citizens who are American war veterans promoting patriotism, upholding universal rights of liberty, equality, justice and the fair rights of Jews everywhere.\n\n*Reprinted with the permission of the USAF - 1st Lt Meredith Kirchoff , U.S. Air Force Academy Public Affairs, Deputy Director\n\n9. THE 13TH EPISCOPAL DISTRICT PIONEERS ELECTRONIC VOTING:\n\nThe 13th Episcopal District pioneers electronic voting to elect delegates to the 49th Quadrennial Session of the General Conference\n\nBishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie leads the way with technology; no more counting votes off of pieces of paper in the 13th Episcopal District.\n\nBishop McKenzie introduced the keypad method of voting for delegates to the 49th Quadrennial Session of the General Conference that will meet next July in Nashville Tennessee. It is believed that the Kentucky Annual Conference is the first annual conference in the AME Church to use the keypad method for voting for delegates to the General Conference. The Kentucky Annual Conference was virtually paperless during the annual conference.\n\nKudos to Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, Supervisor Stan McKenzie, the 13th Episcopal District and the Kentucky Annual Conference for leading the way in technology and innovation.\n\n10.

BOSTON-HARTFORD DISTRICT YOUTH SET NEW POSITIVE RECORD:\n\nEvery year, early in the summer, churches from the Boston Hartford District of the New England Annual Conference come together to honor high school graduates and provide partial scholarships for those who are pursuing additional education or training. So often we hear about African American youth making mistakes. This event is designed to encourage and celebrate positive accomplishments by youth who are part of African Methodism. This year a record number of students, 17, qualified for the Herbert L. Eddy Scholarship Program. The scholarship is named after the Presiding Elder of the Boston Hartford District. Before applying, Boston Hartford District students must successfully complete high school and enroll in either a college or trade school for further education.\n\nOn June 26, 2011 scholarship recipients participated in a 5:00 p.m. “Celebration Program” at Bethel A.M.E. Church in Bloomfield CT where the Pastor is the Reverend Ron McCune. The celebration had the theme: “Stepping into the Next Level.” Students wowed the audience with a short demonstration of their various talents. One student played the soprano saxophone. Several students sang. One student demonstrated “Positive Rap.” Another student danced and some students demonstrated their speaking ability.\n\nThe scholarship recipients are Sister Lynette Holmes (NEAC YPD Director), the Rev Sandra Whitley, Brother Sean Wiltz, Brother Alphonse Jireh Wilfred, Sister Taylor Bradshaw, Brother Derrick Seldon II, Sister Ashli Giles-Perkins, Sister Olivia Dupree, the Rev Dannie Mae Green, Presiding Elder Eddy, the Rev Amelia Eddy, Brother Michael Davis Jr, Sister Bria Belim, Sister Jade Anderson, Sister Margaret Wogbeh, Sister Tiffany Herriquez, Sister Angelique Samuel-Marshall, Sister Ayo Oluwa Onatunde, Brother Joel Clarke, and Sister Shayla Dixon, Brother Jared Curry and Brother Aidid Brayboy.\n\n12. MORRIS BROWN COLLEGE BAND TO FILL IN FOR BOISE STATE AT GEORGIA DOME:\n\nThe Chick-Fil-A Kickoff Game has set up a number of events for fans in Atlanta for Saturday’s (9/3/11) Boise State-Georgia game at the Georgia Dome.\n\n“When we first created this game, the goal was to have the best game on the first weekend of college football, a BCS-type game on the first weekend and a BCS-type of bowl experience for the fans,” said Gary Stokan, the president and CEO of the Chick-fil-A Bowl. “We wanted a sold-out game. We wanted to create some other events around it like we do for bowl game at end of season.”\n\nTo that end, game officials have lined up the Morris Brown College band to serve as a fill-in for the Boise State band, which is not making the trip. The Morris Brown band will play the Broncos’ fight song and other Boise State standbys. Game organizers have purchased blue t-shirts for members of the band.\n\n13.

BENEFIT CONCERT TO SUPPORT SCHOLARSHIPS AND OTHER EDUCATION INITIATIVES ANNOUNCED FOR SEPTEMBER 22ND AT WOLF CREEK AMPHITHEATER:\n\nAtlanta, GA, August 25th…The Mary E. Goldston Foundation, in collaboration with the 100 Black Men of Atlanta, will host its First Annual Benefit Concert, Thursday evening, September 22nd at Wolf Creek Amphitheater in SW Atlanta, Founder Nathaniel R. Goldston, III, announced today.\n\nIn making this announcement, Mr. Goldston, who is also Chairman of Atlanta-based food service and hospitality management corporation, Gourmet Services, Inc., stated that he is most excited by the guest performers who will be featured at this Benefit Concert: internationally-renowned artist, Roberta Flack will headline the roster of performers; she will be joined by neo-soul singer-songwriter, Anthony David; and the Wilberforce University Choir that will round out the field of entertainers with their spirited choral renditions. Also appearing will be Honorary Hosts: Honorable Harry Belafonte and Ambassador Andrew Young.\n\n“As a youngster growing up in Omaha, Nebraska, I was always keenly aware of the value of a good education as the mortar for laying the foundation for one’s future business and life success. It was something that was instilled in me by my parents and other elders. That is why when I launched the Mary E. Goldston Foundation to celebrate the life and work of my mother, we established Education as its primary mission. And, it is also the reason that our first major fundraising effort is targeted to support the educational aspirations of young minority students,” commented Goldston.\n\nHe concluded: “While we would all agree that job creation is the driving force behind spurring our nation’s economic growth, we also know that without a properly educated citizenry, employers will continue to look outside our borders to fill whatever jobs are available. And, to me this is totally unacceptable. That is why, the beneficiaries for this year’s Mary E. Goldston Foundation’s First Annual Benefit Concert will be: program initiatives in engineering, math and science at Wilberforce University [the oldest private HBCU] based in Ohio; along with scholarships for students of the 100 Black Men of Atlanta’s successful education programs--B.E.S.T. Academy and Project Success.”\n\nThe theme of the Benefit Concert is “Advancing Education Through Entertainment”, which will mingle diverse musical genres and entertainers into a harmoniously soothing presentation of elegant sounds—all, for the purpose of inspiring educational achievement. Benefit Concert sponsors include Gourmet Services, Inc. and Diaz Foods, as Title Sponsors; Radio-One [Majic 107.5/97.5] as Presenting Sponsor; others rounding out the list of prime sponsors include, Southern Company, TDC Systems Integration, Inc.; and Grey Goose.\n\n“Securing a good job and acquiring a first-rate education in preparation for that job are two factors that unify all minority youngsters,” says Rene Diaz, President of Diaz Foods. “That is why we are pleased to participate as a Title Sponsor of this important event; for we recognize that in future years, this Benefit Concert can have a positive effect on diverse minority communities around the country,” Diaz concluded.\n\nTickets for the Benefit Concert range from $25 for lawn seats, to $50, $75 and $100 for single reserved seats, and are available through Ticketmaster at www.ticketmaster.com. Patron tickets are also available for $500/two tickets; with sponsor tables ranging from $2500 to $15,000 for tables of eight or ten by contacting the organization at 404-876-5700 or via the organization’s web site at Gregory L. Hawkins, Chairman, 100 Black Men of Atlanta, Inc., commented: “We are extremely excited and proud about this collaboration between the 100 Black Men of Atlanta and the Mary E. Goldston Foundation for this innovative Benefit Concert, ‘Advancing Education Through Entertainment’. Supporting various educational initiatives and providing scholarships for youngsters to achieve their higher education goals is consistent with the primary principles of the 100 Black Men, nationally and locally. This represents a major driver for all of the men of the 100, and along with serving as mentors, it is what distinguishes our membership from other organizations in communities all across the US, and especially here in Atlanta.”\n\nHonorees who will be recognized at the Mary E. Goldston Foundation’s First Annual Benefit Concert include: Dr. Jamye C. Williams, distinguished alumna of Wilberforce University Class of 1938 and Retired General Officer of the AME Church [Atlanta, GA]; and Mr. Lenny F. Springs II, Senior Advisor, US Department of Education/Office of Traditionally Under-Resourced Schools, former Director of Supplier Diversity for Wachovia Bank, and a member of the 100 Black Men of America [Charlotte, NC and Atlanta, GA].

Free vaccines previously were only offered only in military hospitals and clinics.\n\nSee what vaccines are offered through the TRICARE network and make sure you're up to date on all of your preventative vaccines.\n\nTRICARE recommends calling your pharmacy in advance to ensure the vaccine is in stock and a pharmacist is available to administer it.\n\nMOAA strongly applauds this outstanding initiative, which is particularly helpful to TRICARE For Life beneficiaries, who previously had to pay up to $150 out of pocket for the shingles vaccine.\n\nUnfortunately, refunds can't be provided for beneficiaries who previously paid for the vaccine before the new program was instituted.\n\n**Submitted by Colonel-Retired Jim Williams\n\n17.

NEWS FROM CANAAN AME CHURCH, COLUMBIA, TENNESSEE:\n\nThe Rev. William Howard Smith\n\nCanaan AMEC, Columbia, TN was blessed on Sunday, August 21, 2011 with two of its children, being the proclaimers of the Gospel. At the morning service the Rev. Verelene Watkins Jones delivered a message that touched those who listened. The choir made of former Canaan members provided the music. Canaan’s community has produced sons and daughters who have grown in favor and statue with the Lord. Two women played hooky from their normal place of worship. (They don’t know that their pastors are my first cousins.) (I didn’t tell them that the Anderson’s’ were kin to me nor did they ask me!) Persons who attended Canaan Church in precious years furnished the music and as an added blessing, prior to the Sermon, those who were members of the any youth choir at Canaan re-banded to perform two selections.\n\nDinner was served- There was the after the morning worship crowd.\n\nWith anticipation, I heard that there was a Bus needing to be parked. A Van, even two would not require that much room. Even some of the church buses I’m accustomed to would not require that much room. I looked and there was a Chartered Bus (Sparkling White). We were thankful that GOD granted traveling mercy to the Rev., Dr., Terence Mayes and the members of Warren Chapel AME Church, Chattanooga TN. Canaan’s Executive Administrative Assistant to the Pastor, Brother Randall L Webster gave the message to Pastor Smith that we were five minutes away before starting the afternoon Worship experience.\n\nQuick Change Artist: Dr Mayes and I exchanged greetings and the pastor called upon another daughter of Canaan, the Rev. Lesa Webster Dawson to be the worship leader to commence with the worship.\n\nWarren Chapel’s 8:00 a.m. minister of music, Enoshall Kilgore, guided the gifted voices from Market Street’s as they ministered in song.\n\nA grandson of the Rev. Verlene Jones, Mr. Cord Martin, pulled out his alto saxophone and blew that woodwind instrument to provide a melody of “I Need Thee Every Hour” and “Precious Lord.” Doctor Mayes’ youngest son, Julian played the Hammond Organ as Randall Webster played the Digital Piano.\n\nWarren’s First Lady, Mrs. Juliana L. Mayes introduced the guest preacher/pastor with the assistance of the Warren Chapel family. The Mayes’ oldest son, Terence Jr. and daughter, Teri, were “in the house.” (Have you ever wondered what it would be like to preach before your father, mother, sister, grandmother, aunts and a church house full of folk who are kin to you? You are talking about an Annual Sermon where people can hear and respond to the word or sit down on you.\n\nThe “son of Canaan” preached and people began to stand on their feet talking back to the preacher. The Scripture Luke Chapter 13: beginning at verse 10-13, The sermon topic, \"Straighten Up, It’s Only A Set Up.\" People came to the altar desirous of God moving extraordinarily in their lives.\n\nThe associate ministers of Warren Chapel, the Rev. Frank Buckley, the Rev. Donna Perkins and Brother Derrick Thurmond participated in the service. (Perkins assisted with the Warren Chapel Choir, Buckley witnessed to the word being preached and just when we thought it was over, we were blessed with Brother Thurmond singing \"My Soul Has Been Anchored In The Lord.”\n\nFollowing the Benediction, the guests made their way to the dining area to eat. As they walked to the chartered coach that awaited them, I could tell that they had eaten spiritually and seemingly had consumed more than peanut butter and crackers. I noticed how the 94 year old Matriarch of the Watkins, Mayes, and Webster Family and Steward Emeritus of Canaan Church, Sister Annie Louise Woodson, called all of her grand children, great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren \"Baby\". I would run out of breath, this woman knew their names!!! In Amazement, I sat as those Warren Chapel folk walked to Sister Woodson, greeted her and talked so nice too her. I asked myself, \"Why are these people speaking so lovingly to Sister Woodson?\" Someone told me that years ago, Dr. Mayes fell and broke his leg and Mama E, his grandmother, picked up her phone, called one of her people and told them to take her to Chattanooga, TN where she could nurse one of hers back to health!\n\nThis woman still drives her Red Chevy truck! Her Sister, Mrs. Ruth Harwell, is 84, still drives her Blue or Gray Chrysler, is skilled bowler, will beat you at playing horse shoes, or shuffleboard, makes floral arrangements, teaches Church School, sings, writes books, composes poetry and plays the piano.\n\nSister Willa Smith and I will never forget Homecomings at Canaan Church!\n\n19.
