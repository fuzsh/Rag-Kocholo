The whole art of government consists in the art of being honest. Only aim to do your duty, and mankind will give you credit where you fail.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“A Summary View of the Rights of British America” (1774-06)\n\n(Source)\n\nAddressed to King George III.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nThe God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time; the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“A Summary View of the Rights of British America” (1774-06)\n\n(Source)\n\nOriginally written as a draft of resolutions for the Virginia Convention (Aug 1774) as instructions for the Virginia delegates to the first Continental Congress. Never delivered, as Jefferson was unable to attend the convention, it was given this title by friends who printed up copies without his knowledge.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nWe hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independant, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these ends, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government shall become destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, & to institute new government, laying it’s foundation on such principles & organising it’s powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety & happiness.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Declaration of Independence,” original draft (1776-06)\n\n(Source)\n\nCompare to the final version, as modified and adopted by the Continental Congress.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nHe has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it’s most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. this piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the christian king of Great Britain. determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them; thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Declaration of Independence,” original draft (1776-06)\n\n(Source)\n\nThis anti-slavery clause was included in the submission to the Continental Congress. It was removed from the Declaration at the behest of the delegation from South Carolina, as a requirement for their vote.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with inherent and inalienable Rights; that among these, are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness; that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Declaration of Independence” (1776-07-04)\n\n(Source)\n\nAs modified and approved by the Continental Congress. Compare to Jefferson's original draft.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nPrudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Declaration of Independence” (1776-07-04)\n\n(Source)\n\nAs modified and approved by the Continental Congress. Jefferson's \"original rough draft\" is very similar:\n\nPrudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light & transient causes: and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. but when a long train of abuses & usurpations, begun at a distinguished period, & pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to subject them to arbitrary power, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government & to provide new guards for their future security.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nAnd for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Declaration of Independence” (1776-07-04)\n\n(Source)\n\nAs modified and approved by the Continental Congress.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nWe should be wanting to ourselves, we should be perfidious to posterity, we should be unworthy that free ancestry from which we derive our descent, should we submit with folded arms to military butchery & depredation ….\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Declaration of the Causes and Necessity for Taking Up Arms” (1775-07-06) [with John Dickinson]\n\n(Source)\n\nFinal draft as approved by the Continental Congress.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nWith hearts fortified with these animating Reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the World, declare, that, exerting the utmost Energy of those Powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the Arms we have been compelled by our Enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every Hazard, with unabating Firmness and Perseverance, employ for the preservation of our Liberties; being with one Mind resolved to die Freemen rather than to live Slaves.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Declaration of the Causes and Necessity for Taking Up Arms” (1775-07-06) [with John Dickinson]\n\n(Source)\n\nFinal version as approved by the Continental Congress. An earlier draft by Jefferson used these terms:\n\nWe do, then, most solemnly before God and the world declare that regardless of every consequence, at the risk of every distress, the arms we have been compelled to assume we will use with perseverance, exerting to their utmost energies all those powers which our Creator hath given us to preserve that liberty which he committed to us in sacred deposit and to protect from every hostile hand our lives and our properties.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nAnother and more special provision has been made by one of the amendments to the Constitution, which expressly declares, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,” thereby guarding, in the same sentence, and under the same words, the freedom of religion, of speech, and of the press, insomuch that whatever violated either throws down the sanctuary which covers the others, — and that libels, falsehood, and defamation, equally with heresy and false religion, are withheld from the cognizance of federal tribunals.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Kentucky Resolutions,” Resolution 3 (1798)\n\n(Source)\n\nIn protest of the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nit would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights; that confidence is every where the parent of despotism; free government is founded in jealousy, and not in confidence; it is jealousy, and not confidence, which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power; that our Constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which, and no farther, our confidence may go. […] In questions of power, then, let no more be said of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Kentucky Resolutions,” Resolution 9 (1798)\n\n(Source)\n\nIn protest of the Alien and Sedition Acts.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nCompulsion in religion is distinguished peculiarly from compulsion in every other thing. I may grow rich by art I am compelled to follow, I may recover health by medicines I am compelled to take agt. my own judgment, but I cannot be saved by a worship I disbelieve & abhor.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Notes on Religion” (1776-10?)\n\n(Source)\n\nLabeled by Jefferson \"Scraps Early in the Revolution.\"\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nFrom the dissensions among Sects themselves arise necessarily a right of choosing and necessity of deliberating to which we will conform. But if we choose for ourselves, we must allow others to choose also, and so reciprocally, this establishes religious liberty.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Notes on Religion” (1776-10?)\n\n(Source)\n\nLabeled by Jefferson \"Scraps Early in the Revolution.\" Modern rendering. Original:\n\nFrom the dissensions among sects themselves arises necessarily a right of chusing & necessity of deliberating to which we will conform, but if we chuse for ourselves, we must allow others to chuse also, & to reciprocally. This establishes religious liberty.\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nTruth will do well enough if left to shift for herself. She seldom has received much aid from the power of great men to whom she is rarely known & seldom welcome. She has no need of force to procure entrance into the minds of men. Error indeed has often prevailed by the assistance of power or force. Truth is the proper & sufficient antagonist to error.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Notes on Religion” (1776-10?)\n\n(Source)\n\nLabeled by Jefferson \"Scraps Early in the Revolution.\"\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nIn the middle ages of Christianity opposition to the State opinions was hushed. The consequence was, Christianity became loaded with all the Romish follies. Nothing but free argument, raillery, and even ridicule will preserve the purity of religion.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\n“Notes on Religion” (1776-10?)\n\n(Source)\n\nLabeled by Jefferson \"Scraps Early in the Revolution.\" Modern phrasing.

I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because when once known, we accommodate ourselves to them, and find practical means of correcting their ill effects. but I know also that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. as that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilised society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter (1816-07-12) to “Henry Tompkinson” (Samuel Kercheval)\n\n(Source)\n\nInscribed (elided) on southeast side of the Jefferson Memorial:\n\nI am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind.

In the first they all agree. All forbid us to murder, steal, plunder, bear false witness Etc. and these are the articles necessary for the preservation of order, justice, & happiness in society. In their particular dogmas all differ; no two professing the same. These respect vestments, ceremonies, physical opinions, & metaphysical speculations, totally unconnected with morality, & unimportant to the legitimate objects of society. Yet these are the questions on which have hung the bitter schisms of Nazarenes, Socinians, Arians, Athanasians in former times, & now of Trinitarians, Unitarians, Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Methodists, Baptists, Quakers Etc. Among the Mahometans we are told that thousands fell victims to the dispute whether the first or second toe of Mahomet was longest; & what blood, how many human lives have the words ‘this do in remembrance of me’ cost the Christian world!\n\nWe all agree in the obligation of the moral precepts of Jesus: but we schismatize & lose ourselves in subtleties about his nature, his conception maculate or immaculate, whether he was a god or not a god, whether his votaries are to be initiated by simple aspersion, by immersion, or without water; whether his priests must be robed in white, in black, or not robed at all; whether we are to use our own reason, or the reason of others, in the opinions we form, or as to the evidence we are to believe. It is on questions of this, & still less importance, that such oceans of human blood have been spilt, & whole regions of the earth have been desolated by wars & persecutions, in which human ingenuity has been exhausted in inventing new tortures for their brethren.\n\nIt is time then to become sensible how insoluble these questions are by minds like ours, how unimportant, & how mischievous; & to consign them to the sleep of death, never to be awakened from it.

The earth is given as a common stock for man to labour & live on. If, for the encouragement of industry we allow it to be appropriated, we must take care that other employment be furnished to those excluded from the appropriation. If we do not the fundamental right to labour the earth returns to the unemployed. It is too soon yet in our country to say that every man who can not find employment but who can find uncultivated land, shall be at liberty to cultivate it, paying a moderate rent. But it is not too soon to provide by every possible means that as few as possible shall be without a little portion of land.

An officer is bound to obey orders: yet he would be a bad one who should do it in cases for which they were not intended, and which involved the most important consequences. The line of discrimination between cases may be difficult; but the good officer is bound to draw it at his own peril, & throw himself on the justice of his country and the rectitude of his motives.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to John B.

Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. […] I will add that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods & errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to John Norvell (11 Jun 1807)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nPerhaps an editor might begin a reformation in some such way as this. divide his paper into 4. chapters, heading the 1st. Truths. 2d. Probabilities. 3d. Possibilities. 4th. Lies. The 1st. chapter would be very short, as it would contain little more than authentic papers, and information from such sources as the editor would be willing to risk his own reputation for their truth. The 2d. would contain what, from a mature consideration of all circumstances, his judgment should conclude to be probably true. This however should rather contain too little than too much. The 3d. & 4th. should be professedly for those readers who would rather have lies for their money than the blank paper they would occupy.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to John Norvell (14 Jun 1807)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nIt is the old practice of despots to use a part of the people to keep the rest in order.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to John Taylor (4 Jun 1798)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nAn association of men who will not quarrel with one another is a thing which never yet existed, from the greatest confederacy of nations down to a town meeting or a vestry.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to John Taylor (4 Jun 1798)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nAmong the most inestimable of our blessings also is that you so justly particularise, of liberty to worship our creator in the way we think most agreeable to his will; a liberty deemed in other countries incompatible with good government, & yet proved by our experience to be it’s best support.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to John Thomas (18 Nov 1807)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nNo experiment can be more interesting than that we are now trying, and which we trust will end in establishing the fact, that man may be governed by reason and truth.

All advances in science were proscribed as innovations. They pretended to praise & encourage education, but it was to be vain the education of our ancestors. We were to look backwards not forwards for improvement, the President himself declaring in one of his answers to addresses that we were never to expect to go beyond them in real science.

Is this then our freedom of religion? And are we to have a Censor whose imprimatur shall say what books may be sold, and what we may buy? And who is thus to dogmatise religious opinions for our citizens? Whose foot is to be the measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched? Is a Priest to be our Inquisitor, or shall a layman, simple as ourselves, set up his reason as the rule for what we are to read, & what we must believe? It is an insult to our citizens to question whether they are rational beings or not; and blasphemy against religion to suppose it cannot stand the test of truth and reason.

In the meantime, reason will answer it on grounds of probability, that where the wrong has been done by a weaker nation, the stronger one has generally been able to enforce redress; but where by a stronger nation, redress by war has been neither obtained nor expected by the weaker. On the contrary, the loss has been increased by the expenses of the war in blood and treasure. Yet it may have obtained another object equally securing itself from future wrong. It may have retaliated on the aggressor losses of blood and treasure far beyond the value to him of the wrong he had committed, and thus have made the advantage of that too dear a purchase to leave him in a disposition to renew the wrong in future. In this way the loss by the war may have secured the weaker nation from loss by future wrong.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Noah Worcester (29 Jan 1816)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nBut is an enemy so execrable that tho in captivity his wishes and comforts are to be disregarded and even crossed?

For one man of science, there are thousands who are not. What would have become of them? Man was destined for society. His morality therefore was to be formed to this object. He was endowed with a sense of right and wrong merely relative to this. This sense is as much a part of his nature as the sense of hearing, seeing, feeling; it is the true foundation of morality, and not the truth, &c., as fanciful writers have imagined. The moral sense, or conscience, is as much a part of man as his leg or arm. It is given to all human beings in a stronger or weaker degree, as force of members is given them in a greater or less degree. It may be strengthened by exercise, as may any particular limb of the body. This sense is submitted indeed in some degree to the guidance of reason; but it is a small stock which is required for this: even a less one than what we call Common sense.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Peter Carr (10 Aug 1787)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nAbove all things, lose no occasion of exercising your dispositions to be grateful, to be generous, to be charitable, to be humane, to be true, just, firm, orderly, courageous, &c.

The facts which are within the ordinary course of nature you will believe on the authority of the writer, as you do those of the same kind in Livy and Tacitus. The testimony of the writer weighs in their favor in one scale, and their not being against the laws of nature does not weigh against them. But those facts in the bible which contradict the laws of nature, must be examined with more care, and under a variety of faces. Here you must recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from god. Examine upon what evidence his pretensions are founded, and whether that evidence is so strong as that it’s falshood would be more improbable than a change of the laws of nature in the case he relates For example in the book of Joshua we are told the sun stood still several hours. Were we to read that fact in Livy or Tacitus we should class it with their showers of blood, speaking of statues, beasts &c., but it is said that the writer of that book was inspired. Examine therefore candidly what evidence there is of his having been inspired. The pretension is entitled to your enquiry, because millions believe it. On the other hand you are Astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature that a body revolving on it’s axis, as the earth does, should have stopped, should not by that sudden stoppage have prostrated animals, trees, buildings, and should after a certain time have resumed it’s revolution, and that without a second general prostration. Is this arrest of the earth’s motion, or the evidence which affirms it, most within the law of probabilities?\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Peter Carr (10 Aug 1787)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nDo not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no god, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise, and the love of others which it will procure you. If you find reason to believe there is a God, a consciousness that you are acting under his eye, and that he approves you, will be a vast additional incitement; if that there be a future state, the hope of a happy existence in that increases the appetite to deserve it; if that Jesus was also a god, you will be comforted by a belief of his aid and love.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Peter Carr (10 Aug 1787)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nIt is of great importance to set a resolution, not to be shaken, never to tell an untruth. There is no vice so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible and he who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, till at length it becomes habitual, he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world’s believing him. This falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time depraves all it’s good dispositions.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Peter Carr (19 Aug 1785)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nIf ever you find yourself environed with difficulties and perplexing circumstances out of which you are at a loss how to extricate yourself, do what is right, and be assured that that will extricate you the best out of the worst situations. Though you cannot see when you take one step what will be the next, yet follow truth, justice and plain dealing, and never fear their leading you out of the labyrinth in the easiest manner possible. The knot which you thought a Gordian one will untie itself before you. Nothing is so mistaken as the supposition that a person is to extricate himself from a difficulty by intrigue, by chicanery, by dissimulation, by trimming, by an untruth, by an injustice. This increases the difficulties tenfold; and those who pursue these methods get themselves so involved at length that they can turn no way but their infamy becomes more exposed.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Peter Carr (19 Aug 1785)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nWhenever you are to do a thing tho’ it can never be known but to yourself, ask yourself how you would act were all the world looking at you, and act accordingly.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Peter Carr (19 Aug 1785)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\n[T]imid men […] prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Philip Mazzei (24 Apr 1796)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nI concur with you strictly in your opinion of the comparative merits of atheism and demonism, and really see nothing but the latter in the being worshipped by many who think themselves Christians.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Richard Price (8 Jan 1789)\n\n(Source)\n\nPrice had written to Jefferson on 26 Oct 1788 about the harm done by religion and wrote \"Would not Society be better without Such religions?

Of those recorded by historians few incidents have been attended with such circumstances as to excite in any high degree this sympathetic emotion of virtue. We are therefore wisely framed to be as warmly interested for a fictitious as for a real personage. The spacious field of imagination is thus laid open to our use, and lessons may be formed to illustrate and carry home to the mind every moral rule of life. Thus a lively and lasting sense of filial duty is more effectually impressed on the mind of a son or daughter by reading King Lear, than by all the dry volumes of ethics and divinity that ever were written.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826) American political philosopher, polymath, statesman, US President (1801-09)\n\nLetter to Robert Skipwith (3 Aug 1771)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Jefferson, Thomas\n\nMay it be to the world what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all.) the Signal of arousing men to burst the chains, under which Monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings & security of self government. The form which we have substituted restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth that the mass of mankind has not been born, with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of god.

That is, I should indirectly assume to the United States an authority over religious exercises, which the Constitution has directly precluded them from. It must be meant, too, that this recommendation is to carry some authority and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it; not indeed of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription perhaps in public opinion. And does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommendation less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed?
