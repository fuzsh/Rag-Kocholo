        "text": "Hundreds of Thousands Serve in More than 10,000 Projects\n\nHundreds of thousands of Americans joined in volunteer service projects across the country as part of the 2010 Martin Luther King Jr. National Day of Service. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama joined cabinet secretaries, elected officials, nonprofit and business leaders, and Americans of all ages and backgrounds in rolling up their sleeves to honor Dr. King's legacy through service. More than 10,000 service projects took place in all 50 states, addressing a multitude of pressing social issues from poverty and hunger to homelessness and the Haitian crisis.\n\nAmericans made it a “a day on, not a day off” by delivering meals, refurbishing schools and community centers, collecting food and clothing, reading to children, providing employment counseling, and more. Many organizations use the day as a springboard for year-round civic action. The King Day of Service is led by the Corporation for National and Community Service and the King Center in partnership with nonprofit, education, business, and other organizations around the country.\n\nWhile the 2010 King Day has passed, our work is ongoing. Fulfilling Dr. King's dream and making America “what it ought to be” will take a large-scale, long-term commitment. Americans are encouraged to continue working toward King's dream by becoming a mentor, promoting nonviolence, engaging in a Semester of Service, joining a national service program, or finding a volunteer opportunity in your community.
