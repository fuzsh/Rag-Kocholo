The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 3:40 p.m., in Room 334, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Jon Runyan [chairman of the subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Runyan, Lamborn, Bilirakis, Miller, Titus, O'Rourke, Ruiz, Negrete McLeod, and Michaud. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JON RUNYAN Mr. Runyan. Good afternoon. This legislative hearing on H.R. 2018, H.R. 2088, H.R. 2119, H.R. 2529, H.R. 3671, H.R. 3876, H.R. 4095, H.R. 4102, H.R. 4141, and H.R. 4191 will now come to order. Today we have a large number of witnesses present due to the number of bills and a high level of interest in some of these bills before us. Without any objection, the written testimony of all appearing today will be made part of the hearing record. However, the House also is scheduled for some more votes this afternoon, so in the interest of time, there will be no questions for our first panel, which is comprised of Members of Congress who are here to speak on their bills. Subsequent panels two, three, and four will not be asked to give an opening statement today, but we will begin questions and responses immediately upon their introduction. Each testifier's full written testimony will be submitted for the record. Also in the interest of time, I am going to forego a lengthy opening statement and just briefly touch on one of the bills on today's agenda, which I am proud to introduce: H.R. 4095, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment, or COLA, Act of 2014, which provides a cost-of-living adjustment increase to veterans' disability compensation rates and other benefits. The amount of increase will be determined by the Consumer Price Index, which also controls the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security beneficiaries. As many of us here today know, the cost-of-living increase is beneficial to the veterans and their families who depend on VA benefits to make ends meet. Although I am very supportive of this annual legislation, I would like to once again state that it is unfortunate that we have to pass such a bill each year and would encourage our colleagues in the Senate to pass H.R. 570, the American Heroes COLA Act legislation, which authorized an annual COLA without requiring congressional action. This would ensure that the veterans' COLA is not tied to political action, nor inaction, in Washington. I appreciate everyone's attendance here today and will now call on the ranking member for her opening statement. [The prepared statement of Jon Runyan appears in the Appendix] OPENING STATEMENT OF DINA TITUS, RANKING MEMBER Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for having the hearing. As you said, we are examining ten bills that pertain to issues that are of great importance to our nation's veterans and to those in this room. I support a number of these bills. First, I would like to say that I am proud to have worked with the chairman to introduce H.R. 4095 and H.R. 570 which deals with the veterans' compensation cost-of-living adjustments for 2014. Like you, I wish we could make this permanent, but in the short term we certainly need to raise the compensation for this year. It is simply the right thing to do, and I thank you for that. Also on today's agenda is H.R. 2088, which is introduced by our ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Michaud, and which would create claims-processing centers of excellence. With the ranking member here to discuss his bill, I will defer to him to outline the legislation. But I want to say I fully support this legislation and believe that it will build on the VA's successes to date fighting the backlog. H.R. 2119, the Veterans Access to Speedy Review Act, is brought forth by Dr. Ruiz, a member of our subcommittee. His legislation seeks to address the appeals backlog, which we know is a high priority for this committee. It would allow the Board of Veterans' Appeals to select the quickest way to schedule hearings for our veterans. He is here to speak to this. Also, H.R. 2529, the Veteran Spouses Equal Treatment Act, would clarify the definition of ``spouse'' for the purpose of receiving VA benefits. It would include all spouses in any legally recognized marriage with a veteran in any State of the United States and its territories and possessions. The purpose of the legislation is to bring the VA in compliance with the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies to ensure that all veterans and their families are receiving the benefits they have earned throughout their military service. Unfortunately, current law precludes some veterans from receiving the benefits that they have earned. I believe this is a commonsense approach, and I hope we can move the bill to the floor as quickly as possible. So I thank all of our members and our colleagues for bringing forward their thoughtful legislation to help veterans. I thank our esteemed witnesses who have come today to give us some insight and answer our questions about this proposed legislation. Thank you, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Dina Titus appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. I thank the ranking member. With that, I would like to recognize Chairman Miller of the full committee for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JEFF MILLER Mr. Miller. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for yielding. I want to make a few remarks on two bills that I have introduced, H.R. 3671 and H.R. 4102. First of all, H.R. 3671 expands the eligibility for a medallion furnished by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, which would signify that the veteran has veteran status of a deceased individual upon a private headstone or a marker. Currently, VA has the authority to furnish, upon request, a medallion for eligible veterans who died on or about the 1st of November of 1990. H.R. 3671 would remove the date-of-death limitation by codifying eligibility for the medallion benefit regardless of the veteran's date of death. For nearly 40 years now, VA has administered various programs to provide headstones or marker options for veterans. At times there have been allowances for private headstones, and at times those allowances were not provided for. The programs have evolved over time, and that evolution is somewhat confusing for veterans and their loved ones. Some view the current November 1st, 1990, date as an arbitrary qualification for the medallion, but, in fact, this 1990 date was not arbitrary at all. It was delineated as a starting point for the medallion benefits because from November 1st of 1990 through the 1st of September of 2001 VA did not pay a benefit for the purchase of a private headstone or marker for a veteran who was qualified for interment in a national or State veterans cemetery. However, in a 2001 through 2006 pilot program, VA provided government headstones or markers to eligible veterans regardless of whether or not they had privately purchased a headstone, and in 2007 VA actually made this program permanent. At that time, VA included a medallion as an alternative option, retroactive to the 1st of November of 1990. The medallion has proven to be very much appreciated by veterans and their families, and VA is supportive of the change to allow this option for more veterans. Accordingly, I would like to encourage all of you to support the broadened eligibility that is contained within H.R. 3671. And then, additionally, I want to highlight to your attention H.R. 4102, which I have introduced along with Representative Walorski to clarify that the estate of a deceased veteran may receive certain accrued benefits upon the death of the veteran and for other purposes. This bill corrects a grave injustice that has resulted from the tremendous backlogs existing within the Veterans Benefits Administration and will prevent the occurrence of future incidents. The fact is that unacceptable wait times at the VBA regional offices have contributed to tens of thousands of veterans dying before their benefits are granted. While VBA currently reports an average days-to-complete figure of 285 days, I recall that we are not long removed from the agency's 2-year-old claims initiative, which focused on rating claims that had been pending for over 700 days. And, as to appealed claims, while the Board of Veterans' Appeals chairman's report for fiscal year 2013 has not yet been approved or provided to Congress, we can anticipate a grim account, as veterans' appeals continue to rise unresolved for 3, 4, or more years. Now, under current law, only a veteran's spouse or children under the age of 18 and dependent parents are eligible to receive accrued disability benefits in the death of a veteran claimant's death. H.R. 4102 would provide another option for payment into the veteran's estate. To demonstrate the need for this bill, I highlight the experience of Indianapolis veteran Shelton Hickerson and his daughter, Sharon Hickerson Thurman. In 2000, Mr. Hickerson filed a claim for disability benefits. VA denied the claim, and Mr. Hickerson's appellate process began. Ultimately, on June 27th, 2013, after more than 10 years, VA awarded Mr. Hickerson a 100 percent disability rating with retroactive pay in excess of $375,000. But, sadly, Mr. Hickerson passed away the same day as the payment of the benefit. Mr. Hickerson was entitled to this compensation, and had he lived just 1 day--1 day--longer, he would have been able to deposit that accrued benefit properly into his account. However, he did not. And his daughter was not eligible to receive the accrued benefit because she was no longer a dependent. VA's errant and dilatory processing of Mr. Hickerson's claim resulted in no benefit to Mr. Hickerson, to his estate, and, therefore, his family received nothing. There is no doubt in my mind that VA will make mistakes in its claims-rating process. However, the party to the transaction that pays a price for these mistakes should not be the veteran or the families of those lives who are also affected by illness or injury caused by their service. So I want to encourage all of you to support H.R. 4102, a bill to clarify that the estate of deceased veterans may receive accrued benefits upon the death of the veteran and to provide relief in the case of Mr. Shelton Hickerson. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your time. I yield back. [The prepared statement of Jeff Miller appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Chairman. With that, I will recognize the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Michaud, for an opening statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF MICHAEL MICHAUD, RANKING MEMBER Mr. Michaud. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Madam Ranking Member. I am here to testify on H.R. 2088. Today's veterans are filing the most complex claims in history, with the trend continuing towards an increase in complexities. These claims take longer, require more training and additional oversight to properly adjudicate a TBI claim than a loss-of-hearing type of claim. My bill seeks to replicate the success that the VA has had with specializing claims related to Camp Lejeune and atomic veterans. VA suggests that the centralization and specialization of these claims has allowed them to increase training and mastery of these complex conditions, thereby increasing timeliness and accuracy of the adjudication. The VA OIG recently noted in their inspection of VA regional offices that 31 percent of TBI claims reviewed showed that staff had made errors. After informing the staff of the errors and VA taking action, the VA OIG returned and noted that 29 percent of the TBI claims reviewed were still found to be in error. I believe that my legislation provides a commonsense solution that will result in veterans with complex medical conditions having their complex condition adjudicated at a VA center of excellence by a specialist who has been trained to adjudicate these specific claim conditions. We must continue to work towards and achieve a claims system that lives up to the service and sacrifice of our veterans so that no veterans will end up in a situation that you just heard from Chairman Miller, with that veteran and their family. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. [The prepared statement of Michael Michaud appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. Thank the gentleman. I know Mr. Ruiz wants to make a statement. Is there anyone else that wants to make an opening statement? So, with that, the chair recognizes Mr. Ruiz for his statement. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RAUL RUIZ Mr. Ruiz. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this legislative hearing. The bills we will be discussing today serve as a testament to our committee's dedication to the honorable men and women who have served our country. I thank the chairman for including my bill, H.R. 2119, the Veterans Access to Speedy Review Act, in the legislative hearing today. My bill seeks to address the appeals backlog by increasing the use of videoconferencing during an appeals hearing as a substitute for the veteran being there in person. This bill intends to relieve the burden on veterans' having to travel for VA appeal hearings in person. Many times, this travel comes at a great physical and financial cost to the veteran. This bill is also focused on making the VA appeals process as efficient as possible in order to reduce the appeals backlog and create a more speedy review process. In working with veterans service organizations, we have found ways to improve the language of the bill to ensure it meets its intended purpose. I really do thank the VSOs, my veterans advisory group, and the veterans in my district for their input. This is really their creation. I appreciate the chairman's willingness to include this bill in today's legislative hearing, and I look forward to working together to move this legislation forward. Thank you, and I yield back my time. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. And, at this time, I would like to welcome my colleagues in the House to the witness table for our first panel. First, we will hear from the Honorable Al Green from Texas, who is sponsoring H.R. 3876. Next, we will hear from the Honorable Tim Walz from Minnesota, who is sponsoring H.R. 4191. Then, we will hear from the Honorable Jeff Denham from California, who is an original cosponsor of H.R. 4191. And, finally, we will hear from the Honorable Steve Stivers from Ohio, who is sponsoring H.R. 2018. Additionally, Honorable Ander Crenshaw from Florida is sponsoring H.R. 4141. He is unable to attend this afternoon, as he is chairing the Financial Services Subcommittee of Appropriations currently. Noting that, his full written testimony will be included in the hearing record. [The prepared statement of Ander Crenshaw appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. I would like to welcome all of you to this legislative hearing. All of your complete and written statements will be entered into the hearing record. And, with that, Congressman Green, we will start with you, and you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your testimony. STATEMENTS OF THE HON. AL GREEN Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the ranking member, as well, the full committee chair, and the full committee ranking member. And I am somewhat moved, to be quite candid with you, by the comments about the Hickerson family, so I have to digress. It would be unlike me to let this go by and not say something. It pulls at my heart to know that a family is not in a position to receive something that has been earned. And I just don't know how to express my feelings about that other than to say, you didn't ask me, but that is something that I would support, this piece of legislation. All of the legislation that I have heard spoken of appears to be legislation that would greatly benefit our veterans. I am just pleased that I came to hear what I have heard so far. So thank you for this. I would like to start with a brief vignette that will give some indication as to why I feel the way I do about our veterans. I was in another State and lost, looking for a given venue. When I couldn't find it, I happened to look over my right shoulder, and there was a VA facility there. And there was a sign that read, ``Come in and see the price of freedom.'' ``Come in and see the price of freedom.'' And you and I know that the price of freedom is more than gold and silver. It can be an arm, a leg, or possibly someone not returning home at all. This is why we are concerned, and this is why we call to the attention of this body of H.R. 3876 that deals with burials with dignity. We want every person who serves our country honorably to have a dignified memorial service. My hope is, after having talked to the representative from the VFW who is here today, that he and I and others will be able to work out some language that will be acceptable for this committee to review. Hence, I will not go into a long dissertation about the intricacies of the bill. I will simply say that it provides homeless veterans, those who may die with no money or they may have no relatives to be of assistance to them, to make sure that they get a decent burial. Other legislation has addressed this. This is not to say that our country is not doing a good job. It is only to say that we believe that we have more to add, so that transportation will be made available to these veterans. And there may be some other things that we are going to work out with the VFW and other friends. So I want to thank you for allowing me this opportunity to be heard today. I will not consume more of your time than is necessary, but I do believe that, given what I have heard and how I feel, I want to use just a little bit of my time to ask for a moment of silence for those families who are still having to endure wars, endure pain and suffering because their loved ones didn't return to them the way they left. This is my request, and I would simply lower my head for a moment of silence. [Moment of silence observed.] Mr. Green. Amen. And thank you. [The prepared statement of Al Green appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Congressman Green. And I can tell you, having been on this committee for 4 years working with the VFW through committee staff, we usually come to a very sensible agreement--and get a lot of things done around here, believe it or not, in this committee. So I appreciate your willingness to chat with them and look forward to working with you to get what we can done. Mr. Green. Thank you. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. With that, I will recognize Congressman Walz. You are recognized now for 5 minutes for your testimony. STATEMENT OF THE HON. TIMOTHY J. WALZ Mr. Walz. Well, thank you, Chairman Runyan and Ranking Member Titus, and to Chairman Miller and Ranking Member Michaud of the full committee. I would echo the chairman's comments. It is a singular honor to serve on this committee, and to testify in front of you is humbling and an honor. I am joined today by a group of young citizens from Waseca High School in Waseca, Minnesota. And I can't imagine a better place to show them how democracy is supposed to work and how we are supposed to work towards solving problems than this committee. So I thank you for that opportunity. I am also going to be joined and backed up by my friend Mr. Denham, who has been the staunchest supporter of our Nation's veterans. We introduced a piece of legislation to tackle one of the issues. There are so many. As Mr. Green said, so many of these issues are so good and on it. This issue of the claims backlog, it is corrosive, it is wrong. It wears at the soul of this country, wondering why in the heck we can't deliver these benefits that were earned. And I know that there are good intentions, and I know that we are making progress, and I know that the VSOs who will testify afterwards and the VA officials, that we all want that outcome. But I think there are some good ideas out there. And I would argue that Mr. Denham, myself, and we have a Senate companion version that has been introduced--and you are going to see support across the board from the VSOs. This is the right thing to do. This piece of legislation, it is very simple. Our measure would simply allow local doctors to conduct disability medical examinations for veterans. This would conserve VA resources, cuts back on the long wait time at VA hospitals, enables quicker diagnosis of disabilities, and eliminates unnecessary trips to the VA for veterans in rural communities. Specifically, to further encourage use of private medical evidence, we are amending title 38, United States Code, section 5125 to provide that when a claimant submits private medical evidence, including a private medical opinion, that is competent, credible, probative, and otherwise adequate for rating purposes, the Secretary will not request a VA medical examination. This legislation would require VSRs and RVSRs to document that private medical evidence was inadequate for rating purposes before ordering the examination, which many times is unnecessary, duplicative, and slows the process down. The legislation requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to complete two reports for us: a report of 180 days after passage that tracks the implementation and annual reports that track the most common reasons and disabilities for which claims with evidence submitted by non-VA professionals were denied by VBA. Our goal, and this is very, simple: uphold the promise we made to our veterans by ending the backlog and getting the benefits they earned. We think it is the right way to go. There are folks out there willing to do it. We have a Senate companion version. You are going to hear from all of the folks who process these on a daily basis--the VSOs, county veteran service officers. And everyone is going to speak in support of this, except for the VA. And I want them to talk to you about this, talk to you about why that is. They know that I am their staunchest supporter, but I will be their harshest critic. Today, I think I come as the latter on the backlog. With that, I yield back. [The prepared statement of Timothy Walz appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Congressman Walz, for that. And, with that, I will recognize Congressman Denham for his testimony. STATEMENT OF THE HON. JEFF DENHAM Mr. Denham. Thank you, Chairman Runyan, Ranking Member Titus, Chairman Miller, and Ranking Member Michaud. Appreciate, as Mr. Walz said, being on this side of the dais and addressing a very important issue, the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act. We have talked many times about delivering to veterans and getting rid of this backlog. It is certainly one of the largest goals of the VA, but yet we continue to have discussions on why it is not happening quicker. This bill is very simple. Just as an example, currently, at the Oakland Regional office of the Veterans Benefits Administration, which serves the veterans in my district, there are over 20,000 pending claims. Twelve thousand of those claims are 125 days or more. Nationwide, by the VA's own count, there are more than 638,000 pending claims; 360,000 of those are over 125 days long. Secretary Shinseki set the goal of eliminating the disability claim backlog by 2015. And this committee and Congress responded by providing billions in additional funding to improve technology, hire additional staff, and reform the rating process for timelier decisions. The VSOs were also a vital part of this total effort, working hand-in-hand with the VA to create fully developed a claims process to certify claim packets before they are submitted so they can be swiftly approved. However, we are skeptical that these initiatives alone will break the backlog by the 2015 stated goal. Congress needs to do more to bolster VA's current efforts to modernize its operations and promote further improvements in order to give veterans' claims-compensation needs to be settled faster. With that in mind, Congressman Walz and I worked with the veterans service organizations, the VSOs, to draft the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act. The bill will require the VA to maximize the use of private medical evidence. The bill would allow veterans to see their own doctor instead of waiting for an appointment with VA physicians, who are often overworked or far away from a veteran's home. Congressman Walz and I both represent rural veterans, many of them elderly, and the challenge of traveling long distances for an appointment is one of the biggest barriers to accessing their veterans benefits. This bill will help remove that hurdle from the benefits claims process. I would also like to thank, in closing, the VFW, the American Legion, and the Association of United States Navy. Thank you, and I yield back. [The prepared statement of Jeff Denham appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Congressman Denham. And, with that, I will recognize Congressman Stivers for his testimony. STATEMENT OF THE HON. STEVE STIVERS Mr. Stivers. Thank you, Chairman Runyan and Ranking Member Titus, as well as Chairman of the Full Committee Miller and Ranking Member Michaud, for holding this hearing today on my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2018, the Honor Those Who Served Act. I want to thank Representative Beatty and Representative Tiberi for their help with this bill. The measure before the committee today will help make it easier to provide a headstone or marker for veterans who currently do not have a headstone and lay in an unmarked grave. You may know in 2009 the Veterans Administration made a rule change that required notification of next of kin before a veteran could receive an initial headstone from the agency. That regulatory barrier of obtaining approval for next of kin creates an especially high barrier on veterans from much older conflicts, like the Civil War and the Revolutionary War, as well as homeless veterans that Congressman Green talked about earlier. In my State of Ohio and in many other States, there are researchers--in Ohio, the Ohio Historical Society is one--that check the archives, death records, military records, and genealogical records to identify and determine the identity of Revolutionary War and Civil War soldiers who are buried in unmarked graves. These groups can work to identify the next of kin, but sometimes those people can be removed six and seven generations from that veteran, and it is hard to identify next of kin. I understand the rationale of this VA rule, but it has an undue burden on homeless veterans as well as identifying and marking the graves of our veterans from the Civil War and Revolutionary War who sit in unmarked graves. Those who served in our military deserve our full support, especially those who gave their last full measure of devotion for this great Nation. Our veterans, regardless of their era, who have served deserve better than to be marked in an unmarked grave. And that is why, on May 16th of 2013, a bipartisan group of legislators introduced this bill. It would stipulate that if a next of kin cannot be found, the headstone application can be filed with the VA by a State veteran service agency, military researchers, local historians, genealogists, or anyone else familiar with military sources and methods that can identify a veteran's identity. You know, President Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, called for the country to care for those who shall have borne the battle and for the widow and orphan, affirming the government's obligation to honor those who served our Nation. And in 1959, it became the VA's motto. Those who have given the final measure of service to our great Nation deserve a final resting place with a headstone worthy of their dedication, commitment, and devotion. As one final point, I did hear that the Veterans Administration is not supportive of this bill because they believe they can fix this through a rule. I would note that they caused this problem through a rule and recognize they can fix it through a rule but this subcommittee had a hearing on this bill 6 months ago and the VA has, as of today, done nothing to move a rule forward to fix this problem. And I would ask this committee to take this bill to markup and move this bill forward. While I recognize it can be fixed by rule, the VA has done nothing to do so. And it is time to fix this problem for our homeless veterans and our veterans from previous conflicts who today lay in unmarked graves because a next of kin cannot be found. Thank you for your time. Again, I appreciate the chairman and ranking member for holding this hearing. And thank you for allowing me to testify today. I yield back the balance of my time. [The prepared statement of Steve Stivers appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. Thank you, Congressman Stivers. And, as noted, we will forego a round of questions with the first panel. Any questions that anyone has for this panel may be submitted for the record. Mr. Runyan. On behalf of the subcommittee, I thank all of you for your testimony, and you are now excused. And a vote having being called on the floor--there are four votes requested--so this committee will stand in recess for just about an hour. [Recess.] Mr. Runyan. The Committee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs will now come to order. We welcome our second panel to the witness table. The second panel consists of Jeffrey Hall, the Assistant National Legislative Director for Disabled American Veterans; Alexander Nicholson, the Legislative Director for Iraq and Afghan Veterans of America; Heather Ansley, Vice President of Veterans Policy with VetsFirst; and Diane Zumatto, National Legislative Director for AMVETS. Thank you all for being here today and thank you for your patience. Your full and written testimony will be made part of the record of today's legislative hearing. [The prepared statements of Jeffrey Hall, Alexander Nicholson, Heather Ansley, and Diane Zumatto appear in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. As previously noted, we will start with questions. I would like to start with Mr. Hall and go down the row. My first question is about Chairman Miller's bill, H.R. 4102, which would allow benefits to be paid to a veteran's estate if the veteran passes away while a claim is pending and the veteran does not have an eligible survivor. Since most of your organizations have seen situations similar to that of Shelton Hickerson, which the chairman highlighted in his opening statement, can you please share with the committee any additional anecdotes that you may have about the veteran who passed while awaiting a VA benefits decision? Mr. Hall. Mr. Hall. Yes. Actually--thank you for the question--it reminded me of a story when I was a service officer in Chicago before I left to go to New York. It was one of the last cases I had worked on. It was two sisters that had come in for some assistance. The sum and substance of the story is that the veteran waited nearly 2-years to get his claim processed, and when he did get his claim processed, before they authorized and paid him the award, he became hospitalized. And while it took months and months and months for them to authorize the award, he ended up passing away in the hospital before the payment was actually made. So the two daughters, who were no longer dependent children of him at that time, were not able to receive that benefit. And it was well over $100,000 that the veteran was owed. So, therefore, not only did it take them so long to process the award, then the ability for the veteran to receive that money or his next of kin was not able to receive that, or his heirs. So DAV is fully in support of enactment of H.R. 4102 for those very reasons. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. Mr. Nicholson. Mr. Nicholson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Obviously, given our demographic at Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, we don't have any anecdotes to offer in terms of deceased claimants. But, to us, this bill is a no- brainer. We are happy to join our VSO colleagues in supporting it. You know, I think we were among those who did not realize that this was even an issue until, you know, some of the cases were brought to light in the media, which is a way in which we learn about a lot of these issues and, you know, come to support things that need to be changed. So, for us, this was a no-brainer, and we are happy to support the change. Mr. Runyan. Ms. Ansley. Ms. Ansley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would say that if I were to speak with some of our veteran service officers, they could probably provide some of those anecdotes. I personally do not have one to share but do want to align myself with my colleagues, that we certainly support the bill and the aims that it is hoping to achieve. And it certainly makes sense that we would do this as quickly as possible. Mr. Runyan. Ms. Zumatto. Ms. Zumatto. I would agree with all the folks that have spoken before. I don't have any anecdotes to add, but AMVETS does support the legislation. Mr. Runyan. I appreciate that. I don't really have another question. I just want to touch on what I said in my opening statement. And I think you all agree with me that a permanent COLA needs to be accomplished. I see many nods up there. I would appreciate any and all help that you all can do with that. Unfortunately, like a lot of things around here, it creates a lot of uncertainty for our veterans on what, you know, when you have that lapse in that calendar, is going to bring the following year. And it is unfortunate that, we put our veterans through that time and time again, when it is something that is very bipartisan and it passes every single time. Why do we have to create that uncertainty? So I thank you all for your time. And I will yield to the ranking member for her questions. Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank all of you, too, for providing the thoughtful testimony and for your support and help with these bills. Mr. Hall, I know you highlighted in your testimony some of your concerns about H.R. 4095. And we heard Mr. Green, the sponsor of that, say that he was going to be working to come with some improvements to that bill. So I would ask you to work with him to see if we can do that. I know you mentioned the need for maybe a flat rate of payment, something like that. So we would appreciate having your input if we are going to consider this bill further. I would also say to Mr. Nicholson, we had some of your members in our office earlier today. They are ``storming the Hill.'' And they talked to us about ``We've Got Your Back'' because the high suicide rate among veterans is just something that we have to address. We have to do it at a personal level as well as a societal level. That is the way your suggestions were, and I thought that was great. In your statement, you said you support the ranking member's bill that concerns the centers of excellence. I wondered if you might elaborate on that a little bit and how you think that would be helpful as well as what other suggestions you have for streamlining that claims process. Mr. Nicholson. Yes, ma'am, we do. We, you know, have seen efficiencies found, I believe, in processes and innovations such as this. And, you know, I would just say, though, that, you know, we have certainly heard some of the concerns of our colleague VSOs and, you know, echo those, as well, but we think that those are--you know, any kinks that they think may result as a result of this pilot program, and especially an expansion of it, can certainly be worked out. And we think a pilot is certainly a smart way to start. But we believe that innovations like this have proven useful in other types of situations with other types of claims, and we think it is worthy of at least a pilot to try it out with this. Because there is no denying, you know, that there is an issue still at the VA with handling these claims and with the backlog still. I mean, the VA has made enormous progress, you know, since, I think--like you mentioned, we are storming the Hill this year. And I think since we stormed the Hill last year at this time, the backlog is down 40 percent, which is fantastic. And we commend the VA for that progress. But, you know, we still have hundreds of thousands of veterans, each one of those an individual story, an individual life, with a family who was impacted by this, and so we don't want to let up the pressure. And we do believe that, you know, we are willing to support anything that looks like it will work, that has precedence, that works in analogous situations. And we believe this is one that is at least worthy of a pilot. Ms. Titus. Well, thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Runyan. I thank the gentle lady for yielding back. Again, on behalf of this subcommittee, I thank you for your testimony. This subcommittee looks forward to working with each of you, as the stakeholders in this, as we perfect this and bring it to, I believe, a legislative markup in 2 weeks. So I look forward to it, and you are excused. And I will ask the third panel to come to the table. The third panel consists of Mr. Zachary Hearn, deputy director for claims, Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission for American Legion; Mr. Anthony A. Wallis, the legislative director and director of government affairs, the Association of the U.S. Navy; and Brendon Gehrke, Senior Legislative Associate for the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Thank you all for being here today. [The prepared statements of Zachary Hearn, Anthony Wallis, and Raymond Kelley appear in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. As previously stated, we will go right to questions. My first question, is pertaining to H.R. 4191, the Quicker Veterans Benefit Delivery Act. Can any of you provide specific examples of a case in which the veteran had sufficient private medical evidence for the record, yet the VA chose to order an additional exam to determine the benefit? Obviously we heard some of it from Congressman Walz earlier, but we would like to get the stories from you the stakeholders, and your exact experiences with it. So, Mr. Wallis, any examples of it? Mr. Wallis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At this moment, I do not have any specific examples. However, I know that our Members Services Department does get a lot of claims questions and issues that arise, mostly because we have frustrated members upset that their claims are taking so long to be answered. And we do support H.R. 4191, the Quicker Benefits Delivery Act, as it seeks to help to end the backlog of claims by conserving VA resources and enabling quicker, more accurate decisions for veterans, allowing private medical evidence documentation for such claims. So I feel like we are comfortable saying that this legislation would help with streamlining a lot of those claims and only seeks to benefit the veterans so that physicians in the field and localized with these veterans in their community will be better suited to help the VA process these claims. Mr. Runyan. Let me ask this question, and we will continue down the line. To you again, do you have any examples, anecdotes of Chairman Miller's bill, 4102? Mr. Wallis. 4102. Mr. Runyan. Yeah. Mr. Wallis. We do not have any specific anecdotes of that, as well, but we understand and appreciate the legislation in and of itself that also helps to answer a question regarding compensation for claims, as well. You know, this was a frustrating circumstance with the individual in Indiana and his family for getting the claims and compensation processed in a timely fashion. So we are appreciative of that. We don't have any examples at this time, but we are appreciative of the legislation. Mr. Runyan. Mr. Hearn. Mr. Hearn. Good afternoon, Chairman. Yes, before I became deputy director, I worked for several years over at the Board of Veterans' Appeals, and we would routinely see VA scheduling superfluous examinations where the evidence was contained within the C-file. I mean, it was self- evident; it didn't take a rocket scientist to discover it. When we went out to the Seattle VA Regional Office, I want to say about 2 months ago now, I can think of one particular case where the veteran was going through the process of retiring, I believe. The evidence was contained in the veteran's military records to say that he had a certain condition; I believe it was sleep apnea. Despite that fact, they scheduled an examination. And it becomes counterproductive with the fully developed claims process, and it delays a process that is meant to be expeditious. And so it becomes an unfortunate scenario. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. Mr. Gehrke, do you have any---- Mr. Gehrke. In regards to H.R. 4102, I would like to note that, last year, 19,500 veterans died while awaiting benefits. I have heard people joke that veterans who are deceased get quicker service from the VA than living veterans. That is obviously not true, but we really have no idea how many veterans have died before they received benefits, who could not pass that on to their children. What is the most frustrating part about that to the children is they often take care of the veteran while he is ill, while he is on his death bed. And, really, the veteran's benefit should be going towards that type of treatment, that type of hospice care for taking care of that veteran. So that kind of illustrates the real need for that, because it does present a financial hardship on the family. In regards to H.R. 4191, most of the stories that I have heard regarding this have to do with PTSD treatment. Because of the nature of PTSD and it being so urgent, veterans will often seek help from a variety of sources. You know, Military OneSource will connect veterans with Give an Hour, who will then give PTSD treatment to the veteran because of their urgent need of that. So we see that more often than not with them. This bill is something that all the Independent Budget VSOs have recognized is an issue and something that we urge the committee to pass. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. With that, I will yield to the ranking member, Ms. Titus. Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, I would just note that some of you have suggested problems with Mr. Green's legislation and ask for your commitment to work with him between now and the markup. And I think that you have already established that. I would just ask a little more about H.R. 4191. Maybe, Mr. Hearn, if you want to comment on that? From all your accredited service officers nationally who assist veterans with their claims, how can we and the VA assure the proper use and acceptance of private medical information? Mr. Hearn. Just this past--or late last week, actually, the American Legion held the Department Service Officers School, and we were able to bring service officers in. And perhaps in language more direct than drill sergeants at times, they will express their frustration regarding VA and the review of medical records from the private sector. One of the easier ways is for examiners to--or private- sector physicians to utilize the disability benefits questionnaires because it is a standard form. I understand that there is some frustration within the medical community sometimes with that, because they are taking something and more or less making it fill in the blanks or something along those lines. But it has proven to be far more effective because it makes it a lot easier for raters to review that and say, it meets this criteria, it meets that criteria, and we can go ahead and rate it, and then it starts taking some of that gray area out. Ms. Titus. Mr. Gehrke. Mr. Gehrke. I think in history and realizing the acceptance of private medical evidence, you have to realize that for a long time VA gave work credit for rating officers who requested a disability rating examination. So they would get a claim, and they would get credit just for requesting it, whether they had the private medical evidence there or not. Much to VA's credit, they have gotten rid of that credit system. However, there seems to be somewhat of a culture there, that, you know, rating officers will automatically do that out of habit and request that rating examination. And there is also a little bit of a turf battle, whether VA wants to do it in house or they fear outsourcing of it. It really depends on the regional office is what we found. Some regional offices are better at accepting than others. But we feel like there should be an entire standard throughout the VA in accepting private medical evidence. Secretary Hickey has done a lot of work on this. I believe she gave a memo saying that all rating officers will accept private medical evidence if the claim is older than a year. And the VA can correct me if I am wrong on that. But we would like to see it for all claims, whether it has been backlogged for a year or two or whether it is starting now. Because if it doesn't happen, it takes 180 days just to get a rating examination, on average--120 to 180, I believe. And so, that is, I mean, essentially the backlog right there. So you can eliminate a lot of that with that portion. Ms. Titus. Well, thank you. That is helpful. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Runyan. I thank the gentle lady. Gentlemen, I thank you for your patience and your testimony today. With that, this panel is now excused. I welcome the fourth panel to the table. On this panel, we will hear from Mr. Thomas Murphy, the director of compensation service with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. He is accompanied by Patricia Lynch Watts, the Director for Legislative and Regulatory Service for the National Cemetery Administration with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Mr. David Barrans, the Deputy Assistant General Counsel for U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Thank you all for being here today. [The prepared statement of Thomas Murphy appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. As previously noted, I will now begin the questioning. First of all, Mr. Murphy, regarding H.R. 4095, the annual COLA legislation, do you think veterans would benefit from having an automatic COLA rather than an annual COLA, as provided in my previous bill that passed this House, which was H.R. 570? Mr. Murphy. Yes, Mr. Chairman, veterans will directly benefit from this. It keeps the benefits they receive in pace with inflation, just like is administered at Social Security today. It makes it easier for VA to plan and implement these. We know it is coming, it is on a consistent basis, and we are not waiting on a law to be passed at the last minute. This bill is just good all around. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. Regarding H.R. 2018, one of my constituents previously inquired whether it would be feasible to create a special exemption for veterans who died in the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. This addition would require the VA to provide group burial memorials for those men who died while enrolled in a veterans work program, a federally funded project during the Great Depression. Two hundred, forty-four veterans remain buried in two unmarked mass graves in Florida. Whether by statute or regulation, would it be physically unfeasible or cost-effective to provide individual grave markers or a group burial memorial at these sites? Mr. Murphy. Sir, I have to defer to Ms. Watts on this one. Mr. Runyan. Okay. Ms. Watts. Ms. Watts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The specifics of the cost of providing individual stones on that I would have to take back for the record. I don't have the information on exactly what those costs would be. Mr. Runyan. Okay. Will you submit that for the record, please? Ms. Watts. Thank you. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. [The attachment appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. This would also be for Ms. Watts then. Can you elaborate on VA's strong support of H.R. 3670 and specifically on your recommendation that the legislation change the medallion eligibility date to on or after April 6, 1917, rather than eliminating the date altogether? Ms. Watts. Yes. Thank you for that question, Mr. Chairman. We are concerned about preserving the historical integrity of the headstones and markers from periods earlier than that. To provide the medallions on headstones for veterans whose service predates our entering World War I might impede our ability to preserve the historic integrity of those places. So we would respectfully ask that we be able to limit the availability of medallions for service back to the beginning of World War I. Mr. Runyan. Okay. And one more question about H.R. 4141. In the VA's written testimony, it is noted that the VA believes that the bill should allow enhanced-use leases on any and all underutilized and/or vacant VA-controlled properties. Can you explain how this authority would be beneficial to the Department? Likewise, can you explain the concerns you have regarding the language as currently drafted regarding the land that is unsuitable for burial purposes? Ms. Watts. Yes, sir. The ability for VA to lease land that we are not currently using but that is usable land would be helpful under this enhanced-use authority. However, I believe the Department is concerned about the language, as you said, that limits the revised authority just to NCA land that is not used for burial. Our concern is that the language specifically requires that the land not be suitable for burial. And what we would recommend is that the language be changed so that it is land that is not going to be utilized for burial for the period of the lease. That would allow us to use land that possibly is indeed usable for burial or suitable for burial, but that we have no plans in the immediate future to use for that reason. Mr. Runyan. Thank you. With that, I will yield to the ranking member, Ms. Titus. Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank the VA for your assistance on the bills that are before us today. I appreciate your working with us. And we are looking forward to receiving some of the cost estimates. I would like to ask you, Mr. Murphy, in your written statement, you argue that the VA is looking to increase productivity and decrease wait times through a variety of initiatives. Now, the Reno office has struggled to implement many new systems, and I would give you the example of VBMS. So I wonder what you are doing to ensure that some of these underperforming regional offices are going to be able to effectively implement these initiatives that you are talking about? Mr. Murphy. We don't have enough time to go into that in- depth of an answer. Ms. Titus. We have lots of time. Go ahead. Mr. Murphy. Okay. For starters, we had an additional appropriation in 2014 of $10 million to provide for training in underperforming offices. And one of the ways we are focusing that is in offices such as Reno where the individuals are underperforming and it is due to an individual's performance, lack of training, lack of skills, much like what we did with the set training in 2013. The other part of that question is what other things are we implementing that are going to improve that production, improve that facility. It is the use of centralized mail, the use of stakeholder entry portal for veteran service organizations, the continued use of overtime that you are seeing that goes on today. There is a myriad of other people, process, technology improvements that are driving that today. And while we are driving that and moving forward at the same time, we have to keep an eye on offices that are underperforming and not keeping up with the rest of the pack in the improvements in production and quality that we are seeing. And thanks to Congress, they have given us the money and the resources in order to do that during this fiscal year. Ms. Titus. Well, I appreciate that. Also, in the testimony that we heard earlier, that we referred to earlier, from both the American Legion and the VFW, there were some serious concerns expressed about the communications between the VA and the VSO's own brokered claims. And we have experienced this in Nevada, too. Reno has kind of dealt with its backlog by brokering out about half of its claims to other places. And so, I wonder if, as all these initiatives are going in place and you are brokering more and more of these claims and you are implementing this national work queue, do you have a communications strategy in place of working with the VSOs so they know what is going on and how to track these claims? And if you don't, can you get one? Can you make one? Or do you have plans to make one? Mr. Murphy. Yes, we absolutely have a strategy. And, look, the communication is the key. If I can have an early communication with the veteran service organization representing that veteran, predecisional--which they have the right to look at that file for 24 hours--it doesn't do me any good for a power of attorney in Reno to not have access to a case that is being decided in North Carolina. It is in the veteran's best interest and the VA's best interest to allow that VSO the time to take a look at that case. And the way we have to accomplish that is through the use of the stakeholder entry portal, by allowing full access to the VBMS and the file in an electronic environment so that the power of attorney representing that veteran can give an accurate assessment of the work that has been done before we finalize that claim. If I don't provide that, then it simply just adds up to another appeal that we have to deal with down the road. Ms. Titus. Could you share with us that communications plan, a copy of that plan? Mr. Murphy. Yes. Ms. Titus. Okay. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Runyan. I thank the ranking member. I have one more question, I believe directed at Mr. Murphy, pertaining to H.R. 4191. You have said in your testimony that the authority already exists for the VA to use private examinations. But I can tell you, a lot of people, I know on this staff here and in the stories we hear, don't feel they are given the proper weight all the time, and it feels like a rater almost defaults back to the VA automatically. Is there anything that you can do or have done or training you have put in to guide them to say, this is a legal process and we need not to continue to burden our veterans and lengthen this period of time? Mr. Murphy. The statute and our regulations don't just provide for but require the rating of a case when the evidence is sufficient and meets a very long list of things that need to be met in order to rate a case. And the part of the question about what have we done to provide for that, what we have done is we put out a policy from the national level that essentially error-proofs a case. So the individual is not held accountable if they use a DBQ, which is completed, submitted by the veteran, to rate the case. If that case later results in an error, that error will not fall back to that individual. In other words, it is the system's fault that I need to go back and deal with at a different level, and there are no repercussions back to the individual for performance or for quality. So I have put the right protections in place to put the right behavior in place on the part of our raters. Mr. Runyan. Just one last thing. You also note that the VA does not track the number of claims eligible for ACE that requires additional evidence obtained through telephone interviews or whether private medical evidence is sufficient for rating purposes. My question is, why isn't a process like that being tracked? Mr. Murphy. That is one of the things that we need to be tracking going forward, but coming from the paper environment that we have, bringing it into the automated world that we have today, we don't have all the steps and features in place that I can get the development detail to that level. That is certainly something that is on our radar to be put in place. And what that will do is it will allow me to do, like several other systems, it provides me an opportunity to look at the exceptions and find out, is it an individual? Is it a particular office? Is it a particular process that I need to go back in and address? So it is one that we are developing and putting into the system. It is not there today, however. Mr. Runyan. And just one more question, a follow-up to what Ms. Titus had. She asked what the $10 million is used for, as, arguably, the training regimen was developed already. What is the significant dollar amount? And while we complete the support and enhance intelligent training, what does it pay for? Mr. Murphy. What does it pay for? We are funded today to do our Challenge Training Program and other training events. This provides dollars well above and beyond to allow us to pull in people that would not otherwise be trained in 2014. And we can target and focus those specific underperforming individuals. The dollars we have in place today takes care of new employee training, employees that have been promoted already. Well, if I am going to go out and make a difference in the environment on a large scale and pull underperforming employees in on top of that, that is where this additional funding comes in place. Mr. Runyan. Okay. Ms. Titus, anything further? Ms. Titus. No, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Runyan. Well, thank you all for your testimony and answering the questions. On behalf of the subcommittee, I want to thank you for your testimony. As noted, your written testimony will be entered into the hearing record and will inform the discussion on the legislation we have heard about today. We look forward to working with you in the future on these bills as well as a wide range of challenges facing our Nation's veterans. You are excused. I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material. Hearing no objections, so ordered. [The attachment appears in the Appendix] [The prepared statement of the Paralyzed Veterans of America appears in the Appendix] Mr. Runyan. I thank the Members for their attendance today. And this hearing is now adjourned. [Whereupon, at 5:42 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.] APPENDIX Prepared Statement of Dina Titus, Ranking Member Thank you, Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing today on behalf of our nation's veterans. Today, we are examining ten bills that pertain to issues of critical importance to our nation's veterans. I support several of these bills proposed by our colleagues, and am proud to have worked with the Chairman to introduce H.R. 4095, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of Living Adjustment Act of 2014. This legislation will increase the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities, and those surviving spouses of veterans who receive dependency and indemnity compensation. This is simply the right thing to do for our Veterans and survivors. Also on today's agenda is H.R. 2088, introduced by Ranking Member Michaud, which would create Claims Processing Centers of Excellence. With the Ranking Member here to discuss his bill, I will defer to him to outline this legislation. But, I fully support his legislation and believe that this will build on VA's successes fighting the backlog. H.R. 2119, the Veterans Access to Speedy Review Act, is brought forward by Mr. Ruiz, a member of our Subcommittee. His legislation seeks to address the appeals backlog, a high priority issue for this committee, by allowing the Board of Veterans Appeals to select the quickest way to schedule hearings for veterans. Lastly, H.R. 2529, the Veteran Spouses Equal Treatment Act, would clarify the definition of ``spouse'' for the purpose of receiving VA benefits to include all spouses in any legally recognized marriage with a veteran in any state of the United States and its territories and possessions. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that all veterans and their families are receiving the benefits they have earned through their military service. Unfortunately, current law precludes some veterans from receiving the benefits they have earned. I believe this is a common sense approach, and I hope we can move this bill to the Floor as quickly as possible. I thank all of the Members for their thoughtful legislation. And, I thank all of our esteemed witnesses for joining us today and look forward to hearing their testimony. Thank you and I yield back. Prepared Statement of Hon. Al Green on H.R. 3876, the Burial With Dignity for Heroes Act of 2014 Thank you Chairman Runyan and Ranking Member Titus for holding this hearing today and providing me with the opportunity to testify on H.R. 3876, the Burial with Dignity for Heroes Act of 2014. Many veterans make the ultimate sacrifice for the citizens of United States of America and this should never be overlooked. Those who serve their country honorably should be properly memorialized at the time of their death. Unfortunately, too many homeless veterans are not presented with such an opportunity. Often, homeless veterans are buried without a proper funeral service because their families, or lack thereof, do not have the funding to cover the burial costs. Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs provides eligible homeless veterans with the opening and closing of the gravesite, a grave liner, a headstone or maker, and a graveside ceremony. However, the preparation of the body, transportation, clothing, casket and coordination of the funeral service are necessary services that the VA is unable to provide. At this time, the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) does not differentiate between claimed and unclaimed remains; therefore, there is not a definite way to determine the number of homeless veterans that are laid to rest each year without a proper burial. I, along with my colleague Congresswoman Corrine Brown, have introduced H.R. 3876, the Burial with Dignity for Heroes Act of 2014, which would amend title 38 of the United States Code to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry out a program to make grants to eligible entities to provide for the cost of burials for eligible homeless veterans. Outside entities will submit applications to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs who will determine which entities are eligible. This practical legislation would help eliminate the possibility of a hero not receiving a proper military funeral. H.R. 3876 would provide for an eligible veteran to be laid to rest in a National Cemetery or a local cemetery. An eligible veteran is a deceased former service member: Who is homeless, Who is eligible to be buried in a National Cemetery, Who was not convicted of a capital crime, Who was not dishonorably discharged, and Who the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines has no next of kin. I am confident this legislation will help to ensure that all homeless veterans receive a burial with dignity. Our nation's heroes deserve funeral services with military honors. The Burial with Dignity for Heroes Act of 2014 intends to ensure that all eligible veterans, regardless of their financial status at the time of their death, will be properly honored, and does so without appropriating any additional federal dollars. Thank you again for the opportunity to present my testimony before this subcommittee. I yield back the balance of my time. Prepared Statement of Hon. Tim Walz on H.R. 4191, the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act Thank you, Chairman Runyan and Ranking Member Titus, for your leadership and for inviting us here today to speak on H.R. 4191, the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act. With the hard-earned experience of two major wars during the last 12 years, Americans have developed a renewed understanding of the need to support our service members in battle and throughout their active- duty service. Unfortunately, our warriors' battles don't always end when they return home. We've heard from many veterans who have returned bearing the scars of war--mental and physical disabilities incurred while protecting our freedoms. All they expect is that, in return for their service, our nation keeps its promises to them. With the end of the war in Iraq, and the draw down of troops in Afghanistan, the number of disabled veterans who need care is increasing exponentially. Despite the fact the Department of Veterans Affairs is processing more claims today than at any time in history, veterans are waiting too long to receive the benefits they have earned, creating an unnecessary financial hardship for veterans and their families. The VA reports 554,105 veterans have been waiting longer than 125 days to have their claim adjudicated. This is unacceptable, and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, a retired U.S. Army General who has dedicated his life to military service and taking care of our brave warriors, agrees. While the VA is making progress, we believe there are common sense measures Congress can undertake to bolster the VA's efforts to ensure our veterans are getting the care they need in a more-timely manner. In response to veterans and veterans' organizations who have told us about the hardships the VA backlog imposes on veterans, we introduced H.R. 4191 to help speed up the process. We, along with Senator Franken, have introduced bipartisan measures in both the House and Senate that will remove several hurdles to getting claims processed quickly. Our measure would allow local doctors to conduct disability medical examinations for veterans. This conserves VA resources, cuts back on long wait times at VA hospitals, enables quicker diagnoses of disabilities and eliminates unnecessary trips to the VA for veterans in rural communities. Specifically, to further encourage the use of private medical evidence, we are amending title 38, United States Code, section 5125 to provide that, when a claimant submits private medical evidence, including a private medical opinion, that is competent, credible, probative, and otherwise adequate for rating purposes, the Secretary shall not request a VA medical examination. This legislative change would require VSRs and RVSRs to document that private medical evidence was inadequate for rating purposes before ordering examinations, which are often unnecessary. Additionally, the legislation requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to complete two types of reports on the progress of this initiative: a report 180-days after passage of the bill that tracks the bill's implementation and an annual report that tracks the most common reasons and disabilities for which claims with evidence submitted by non-VA medical professionals were denied by VBA. Our goal with this legislation is simple: to uphold the promises we've made to our veterans by ending the backlog and getting them the benefits they have earned and deserve. We know there is no silver bullet to eliminating the backlog, and we understand each step along the way requires thoughtfulness, analysis and synchronicity. However, we believe H.R. 4191 to be an integral step along the glide path to success. It is a common sense solution that will aid in adding efficiency to a complicated process in order to better serve our nation's heroes. Thank you, Chairman Runyan and Ranking Member Titus, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of this bill. Prepared Statement of Hon. Jeff Denham on H.R. 4191, the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify this morning in regard to the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act. The bill will end redundant Department of Veterans Affairs claims processing practices and allow veterans in my district to receive their benefits more rapidly. I do not need to remind the members of this committee of the struggles faced by veterans trying to receive their disability compensation. Currently at the Oakland Regional Office of the Veterans Benefits Administration, which serves the veterans in my district, there are over 20,000 pending claims. 12,000 of those claims have been pending for more than 125 days. Nationwide, by the VA's own count there are more than 638,000 pending claims. 360,000 of these have been pending for more than 125 days. Secretary Shinseki set the goal of eliminating the disability claims backlog by 2015 and this committee and Congress responded by providing billions in additional funding to improve technology, hire additional staff and reform the rating process for timelier decisions. The VSOs were also a vital part of this total effort, working hand in hand with the VA to create the Fully Developed Claims process to certify claim packets before they are submitted so that they can be swiftly approved. However, while these efforts are important, we are skeptical that these initiatives alone will break the backlog by the stated goal of 2015. Congress needs to do more to bolster the VA's current efforts to modernize its operations and promote further improvements in order to get veterans' claims and compensation needs settled faster. With that in mind, Congressman Walz and I worked with Veteran Service organizations to draft the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act. The bill will require the VA to maximize the use of private medical evidence. The bill would allow veterans to see their own doctor instead of waiting for an appointment with VA physicians who are often overworked or far away from the veteran's home. Congressman Walz and I both represent rural veterans, many of them elderly, and the challenge of traveling long distances for an appointment is one of their biggest barriers to accessing their veterans' benefits. This bill will help remove that hurdle from the benefits claims process. Additionally this bill will conserve the VA's resources, allowing VA physicians to concentrate on patients with immediate needs rather than spend substantial time filling out disability claims paperwork. We understand that there isn't one silver bullet that will break the backlog. However, the Quicker Benefits Delivery Act provides substantial, innovative, results-oriented measures that work to bolster the VA's current efforts. I would like to thank the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and the Association of the United States Navy for their support of this legislation. Additional Signatures Prepared Statement of Hon. Ander Crenshaw on H.R. 4141 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member Titus and the subcommittee for allowing me to testify on behalf of the legislation I have introduced, H.R. 4141, a bill to honor the fallen at national cemeteries. The veterans of the United States deserve all recognition we can provide for their faithful and dedicated service to our Nation. One way we can recognize these veterans is by allowing veteran organizations to build and maintain facilities on federal property that can be used to honor the fallen and pay tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Passage of H.R. 4141 will authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to accept organization's requests to use National Cemetery land for purposes that support the mission of the VA. The use of this land includes the creation of memorials and pavilions, paid for by private funds that will honor our fallen and past veterans and provide space for their loved ones to gather and reflect. Until 2012, the VA could enter into Enhanced Use Leases (EULs) that furthered the mission of the Department and enhanced the use of the property in ways that would result in the improvement of medical care and services to veterans in the geographic area. The maximum lease term was 75 years, and the VA was to charge ``fair consideration'' for the lease, including in-kind payment. The ability of the VA to offer EULs was changed as part of the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act (P.L. 112-154). In this act, Congress limited the circumstances under which the VA may enter into EULs to ``the provision of supportive housing.'' H.R. 4141 does not reduce the requirements or authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), to determine the proper way to ensure our veterans are honored. Instead, the legislation provides an additional avenue for the VA to work with groups to honor our veterans in a way that benefits local communities at minimal cost to the federal government. This issue was brought to my attention by a Jacksonville, Florida, organization that has been working on a project to build a memorial center since the creation of the Jacksonville National Cemetery in 2007. In 2012, after years of hard work navigating the VA and NCA bureaucracy, the leaders of the Jacksonville National Cemetery memorial project were informed that it was no longer possible to obtain an enhanced use lease because the law had changed, and all their effort has been for not. In North Florida, The Jacksonville National Cemetery Memorial Center would give 7,000 veterans and their families much needed services that are not provided at any of our current national cemeteries. It could include a commemorative hall and archive building. These spaces could provide families of the fallen places to gather and honor their loved ones, and would provide a place for the general public to learn more about those who have fought for our great Nation. The 7,000 veterans I mentioned are in North Florida alone. All over America, communities will come together to honor their fallen sons and daughters. These centers could become places for kindred spirits to gather and recognize the countless men and women who have given so much to their countries and their communities. One of the most important features of this legislation is that we reinforce the reason these cemeteries exist, and that is to inter and honor our veterans. Future EULs will make it possible for memorials to be built to honor a community's local heroes, but will be regulated and overseen by the VA and NCA, and ultimately by this subcommittee and others with oversight responsibilities. After all, it is essential that we keep in mind that the cemeteries exist to lay to rest those brave men and women who have put themselves in harm's way for our Nation. This legislation provides a way for the American people to honor our veterans as we move past more than a decade of war. It is also a way for communities to build memorial halls and pavilions showing respect for the honor, courage, and commitment of their loved ones. Additionally, the ability of organizations to build memorials will enhance the education of generations to come. One of the best ways that we can pass on a legacy of service and citizenship is by teaching our children and grandchildren about the sacrifices made by their forefathers. Mr. Chairman, again, thank you and this subcommittee for giving me the opportunity to testify on H.R. 4141. I look forward to discussing these important issues with you, the distinguished members of the committee, and the veteran service organizations who continually work to ensure the American people keep our veterans in the forefront of our minds. Prepared Statement of Hon. Steve Stivers I want to thank Chairman Runyan for holding this important legislative hearing today on my bipartisan legislation, the Honor Those Who Served Act. The measure before the committee today will make it easier to provide headstones or markers for veterans who currently do not have a headstone and lay in an unmarked grave. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issued a rule change that required `Next of Kin' (NOK) be notified before a veteran received an initial headstone from the VA. Previously, the VA accepted and processed headstone claims from funeral directors, cemetery officials, county veterans service officers, researchers and other civic organizations. This new regulatory barrier of obtaining the approval from the NOK to receive a headstone for a deceased veteran is making it more difficult to honor the sacrifice of our veterans. There are researchers, like those at the Ohio Historical Society, who research archives, death records, military records and genealogical records to determine the identity of Revolutionary and Civil War soldiers buried in unmarked graves. These groups then work to find the NOK. But, sometimes this is not possible when today's headstone applicants are seven generations removed from the Civil War, for example. I understand the rational of the rule to make sure family members are not left out of the decision-making process for obtaining a headstone, but the current rule is too restrictive and service members--especially Civil War era African American soldiers are left with unmarked graves. Those who served in the military deserve our full-support, especially those who gave the final measure of devotion to our great nation. Our veterans, regardless of what era they served in, deserve better than unmarked or deteriorated graves. That is why on May 16, 2013, I introduced H.R. 2018 that would stipulate that if NOK cannot be found then headstone applications may be filed with the VA by: the state veterans service agency, military researchers, local historians, genealogists, or others familiar with research sources or methods needed to prove a veteran's identity. In his second inaugural speech, President Abraham Lincoln stated, ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan,'' affirming the government's obligation to honor those who serve our nation. These words of Lincoln's became the VA's motto in 1959. Those who gave the final measure in their service to our great nation deserve a final resting place with a headstone worthy of their dedication, commitment and devotion. Again, I appreciate the Chairman for allowing me to testify today and holding this hearing. Prepared Statement of Jeffrey C. Hall on DAV Chairman Runyan, Ranking Member Titus and Members of the Subcommittee: Thank you for inviting DAV (Disabled American Veterans) to testify at this legislative hearing of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs. As you know, DAV is a non-profit veterans service organization comprised of 1.2 million wartime wounded, injured and ill veterans and dedicated to a single purpose: empowering veterans to lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity. DAV is pleased to be here today to present our views on the bills under consideration by the Subcommittee. H.R 2018 H.R. 2018, the Honor Those Who Served Act of 2013, would amend Title 38, United States Code, to identify those persons who are eligible to request headstones or grave markers furnished by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Currently Section 2036 of the law specifies who may request a headstone or marker from the VA. H.R. 2018 clarifies this issue by expanding the language of Section 2036 to identify eligible persons as the decedent's next of kin; a person authorized in writing by the decedent's next of kin to make such request; a personal representative authorized in writing by the decedent to make such request; when none of the aforementioned apply, a state veterans service agency, a military researcher, local historian, or a genealogist or other person familiar with the research sources and methods necessary to prove the identity of the decedent; or any person may make the request if the decedent's active military service preceded the application for headstone or marker by at least 62 years. While DAV has no specific resolution to support this particular matter, we are not opposed to enactment of H.R. 2018. H.R 2088 H.R. 2088 would direct the VA to establish a pilot program for the designation of 12 Regional Offices as Centers of Excellence that will each focus or specialize on claims involving the most complex and time consuming issues such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and military sexual trauma (MST), as designated by the Secretary. While demonstrated progress was achieved last year in reducing the backlog of claims, other VBA initiatives similar to the Centers of Excellence, such as a national work queue model and centralized mail centers, are currently being proposed within the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Although VBA has not provided detailed information about any national work queue model, our understanding is that this will allow all claims to be processed nationally by Veterans Service Representatives (VSRs) and Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSRs), regardless of their physical location or the origin of the claim. This is essentially the same approach VBA took last year when they processed all claims pending more than two years within a short period. With all claims now becoming virtual once submitted and/or converted electronically, claims processing can be done by any fully trained VSR or RVSR regardless of their physical location. This approach is not unlike the process of brokering claims from one Regional Office to another when assistance is needed, which VBA has relied heavily upon over the years. So taking the basic concept of brokering claims and VBA's ``all hands'' strategy they used last year to process the oldest claims and applying it to national workload may have the potential for success; however, we are just learning more details of how the national work queue model will work. For the past several years, VBA has discussed the general concept of establishing Centers of Excellence, wherein specific Regional Offices would be designated to process specific types of claims for the entire country. For example, a particular Regional Office would be designated as a Center of Excellence for claims involving PTSD, TBI, and MST, and all claims containing such conditions would be processed by that facility for the entire country. While Centers of Excellence could relieve the majority of VAROs from processing some of the more time consuming, complex claims, it must be done properly, with certain principles guiding such as model. One key question is would multiple issue claims be split by issues and processed by multiple centers? What would happen when a VARO receives a claim for PTSD and an orthopedic condition--would the origin VARO process the orthopedic condition or would a PTSD Center of Excellence process all issues? Such questions are crucial and we believe that VBA must move in a deliberate and thoughtful manner to ensure that Centers of Excellence are truly ``excellent,'' not just ``centers'' for complex, time consuming claims. For these reasons, we recommend that VBA begin with just four Centers of Excellence and that they carefully study whether or not they are successful before expanding to additional ROs. In addition, it is important that employees at these Centers of Excellence receive comprehensive training on their specialty. Additionally, with the national work queue model being developed and all claims becoming virtual, is an entire Regional Office being designated as a Center of Excellence still a viability? Since all claims are virtual and physical location may be less important now, maybe it would be more prudent for VBA to designate particular individuals or teams in every Regional Office who would process certain issues such as PTSD, TBI and MST instead of an entire Regional Office being dedicated to those issues. To be clear, DAV is not opposed to the concept of establishing Centers of Excellence as there are certain advantages, such as all specialized claims being processed by a select group of experts. However, given the progress with VBA's technology, specifically the Veterans Benefits Management System, contemplation should be given to the alternatives through technology versus designating an entire Regional Office as a Center of Excellence, which may very well become a centralized repository of the most backlogged claims because they are most time consuming and complex. While we do have questions about establishing Centers of Excellence, we agree with the principal intent of the legislation, which is to redirect the most time consuming and complex claims away from the national workload, possibly reducing the backlog, and into the hands of select individuals who receive support and training as experts in particular matters. However, we do request DAV, other veterans service organizations and interested stakeholders be included in as much of the deliberation, development, and strategy process as possible, as well as kept apprised throughout. H.R 2119 H.R. 2119, the Veterans Access to Speedy Review Act, would allow the Board of Veterans' Appeals upon receiving a request for hearing to determine, for the purposes of scheduling the hearing for the earliest date possible as well as the location of the hearing and the type of hearing, be it in person or by use of videoconferencing equipment. Once the appellant is notified of the Board's determination of the type and location of the hearing, the veteran would be able to request a different type or location, and if so, the Board may grant such request while ensuring the hearing is scheduled as soon as possible and without delay. While we support the purpose of H.R. 2119 and take no issue with the Board determining the type and location of a hearing, we do not agree with the language of the bill where it states ``if so requested, the Board may grant such request.'' Specifically, this bill as written would allow the Board to determine the type and location of a hearing and deny a request from a veteran who prefers to have an in-person hearing with a Board member rather than a video conference hearing. We believe the veteran's right to a hearing also includes the right to choose the type and location, which could be adversely impacted with this bill as written, so in order to preserve such right, we recommend the aforementioned sentence be changed to, ``if so requested, the Board shall grant such request . . . '' DAV would support enactment of H.R. 2119 if the language is amended to prevent the Board from overriding a veteran's requested venue for a hearing. H.R 2529 H.R. 2529, the Veteran Spouses Equal Treatment Act, would amend title 38, United States Code, redefine the term ``spouse'' to recognize new state definitions of such term for the purpose of the laws administered by the VA. DAV has no resolution on this particular matter, and has no position on this bill. H.R 3671 H.R. 3671 would amend title 38, United States Code, to expand the eligibility for a medallion furnished by the VA, which is used to signify the status of a deceased individual as a veteran. Currently, Section 2306(d)(4) states, ``in lieu of furnishing a headstone or marker under this subsection, the Secretary may furnish, upon request, a medallion or other device of a design determined by the Secretary to signify the deceased's status as a veteran, to be attached to a headstone or marker furnished at private expense.'' H.R. 3671 would expand eligibility to persons ``regardless of the date of the death of individual for whom the medallion or other device is furnished.'' While DAV has no specific resolution on this particular matter, we are not opposed to enactment of H.R. 3671. H.R 3876 H.R. 3876, the Burial with Dignity for Heroes Act of 2014, would direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a program to make grants to eligible entities to provide for the cost of burials for homeless veterans who are eligible to be buried in national cemeteries and when the Secretary determines the veteran has no next of kin. Currently, the law allows the surviving spouse, dependent child or dependent parent to receive a $2,000 burial allowance when the death is service related, and $300 when the death is not service related. H.R. 3876 does not specify the amount of the intended grant, which would be payable to an individual who may not even be related to the decedent homeless veteran. While we certainly agree with the intent of H.R. 3876, we do not believe the amount should exceed the burial allowance provided to eligible survivors. While DAV has no specific resolution on this particular matter, we would not be opposed to its enactment as long as our concerns above are addressed. H.R 4095 H.R. 4095, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2014 would increase, effective December 1, 2014, the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) for the survivors of certain disabled veterans. A cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) was passed last year at the modest increase of 1.5%, which did not include the long standing practice of rounding down to the nearest whole dollar amount. As you know, many disabled veterans and their families who rely heavily or solely on VA disability compensation or DIC as their only means of financial support have struggled during these difficult times. While the economy has faltered, their personal economic circumstances have been negatively affected by rising costs of many essential items, including food, medicines and gasoline. Rising inflation continues to be a major factor, so it is imperative that veterans and their dependents receive a timely COLA and DAV supports enactment of H.R. 4095, which is in accordance with our resolution. However, in keeping with another longstanding resolution, DAV is adamantly opposed to Section 2(c)(2) of the bill that once again requires the unacceptable practice of ``rounding down'' COLA increases to the next lower whole dollar amount, which incrementally reduces the support to disabled veterans and their families and survivors. The practice of permanently ``rounding down'' a veteran's COLA to the next lower whole dollar amount can cause undue hardship for veterans and their survivors whose only support comes from these programs and it is time to end this practice, which was only intended to be a temporary measure more than twenty years ago. H.R 4102 H.R. 4102 would expand Title 38, United States Code, to include the estate of a deceased veteran as an eligible recipient of certain accrued benefits upon the death of the veteran when such benefits would not be payable to any survivor. Currently, Section 5121 does not allow accrued benefits payable upon death of the veteran to be paid to any entity other than eligible survivors, and if there are none, essentially those benefits, which can be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, are lost or forfeited. Enactment of this bill would allow the deceased veteran's estate to be eligible for such benefits. This legislation is designed to correct an unfair practice that currently denies the lawful heirs of a deceased veteran from receiving these earned funds. Accordingly, DAV supports enactment of H.R. 4102. H.R 4141 H.R. 4141 would amend Title 38, United States Code, authorizing the VA to enter into enhanced-use leases for excess property of the National Cemetery Administration, which has been deemed unsuitable for burial purposes. While DAV has no specific resolution on this particular matter, we are not opposed to enactment of H.R. 4141. H.R 4191 H.R. 4191, the Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act, would expand Section 5125 of title 38, United States Code, to improve how private medical evidence submitted in support of a claim for disability compensation is treated by the VA. Currently, Section 5125 states, ``for purposes of establishing any claim for benefits . . . a report of a medical examination administered by a private physician that is provided by a claimant in support of a claim . . . may be accepted without a requirement for confirmation by an examination by a physician employed by the Veterans Health Administration if the report is sufficiently complete to be adequate for the purpose of adjudicating such claim.'' Currently the VA has the option of accepting such private medical evidence within the present language of ``may be accepted'' as contained within Section 5125. H.R. 4191 removes such option and replaces ``may'' with ``shall,'' which will require the VA to accept private medical evidence submitted by the veteran, while also clarifying the term ``sufficiently complete'' to mean evidence that is competent, credible, probative, and containing such information as may be required to make a decision on the claim for which the evidence is provided. DAV is very much interested in the VBA reducing the backlog of pending disability claims, but as we have consistently maintained, not at the risk of reducing quality. Likewise, DAV has been a longtime proponent of certain actions VBA could take, which could have a positive impact on the speed of the claims process. Requiring VBA to accept private medical evidence submitted by the veteran, so long as it is adequate for rating purposes, as is the intent of Section 2 of this bill, is one type of action DAV has strongly advocated for in recent years. In accordance with our resolution to improve the claims process, DAV strongly supports enactment of H.R. 4191. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony and I would be happy to answer any questions from you or members of the Subcommittee.
