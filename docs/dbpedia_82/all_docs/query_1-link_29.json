        "text": "2020\n\nOn March 2, 2020, the Clinic filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in Dailey v. Florida. The clinic is defending the innocence of James Dailey, who is currently on death row, even though another person has confessed to the crime on several occasions.

Montana Dep’t of Revenue, on behalf of the Montana Association of Rabbis, arguing that awarding tax credits to sectarian schools would have an impermissible impact on members of minority faiths, effectively forcing them to subsidize Christian education. The brief is available here.\n\nOn November 12, 2019, the Clinic filed a merits brief in Lucky Brand Dungarees Inc. v. Marcel Fashion Group Inc. arguing on behalf of the respondent, on the question of whether federal preclusion principles can bar a defendant from raising defenses that were not actually litigated and resolved in any prior case between the parties, when a plaintiff asserts new claims. The brief is available here. The opinion is available here.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, the Clinic filed a merits brief on behalf of the respondent in Monasky v. Taglieri, arguing that a child’s “habitual residence” under the Hague Convention depends on the totality of the circumstances, not on categorical requirements such as an actual agreement between the parents.

The opinion is available here.\n\nOn September 30, 2019, the Clinic filed a brief in opposition in Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania v. Piasecki.

The brief is available here. The opinion is available here.\n\nOn March 4, 2019, the Clinic filed a merits brief in Lamone v. Benisek. The brief argued, among other points, that First Amendment claims against partisan gerrymandering are justiciable and that the composition of Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District violated the First Amendment. Oral argument took place on March 26, 2019. The brief is available here.\n\nOn February 8, 2019, the Clinic filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on behalf of Zenaido Renteria. The petition argues that the Constitution and 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a) both provide protections to criminal defendants limiting the venue to those places where the defendant could reasonably foresee an act would occur. The brief in Renteria v. United States is available here.\n\nOn January 24, 2019, the Clinic filed a merits brief in Kisor v. Wilkie, arguing for petitioner, James L. Kisor, that the Court should overrule its decisions in Bowles v. Seminole Rock and Auer v. Robbins. The brief emphasized that Auer deference is inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act and creates significant unpredictability in agency action. Oral argument took place on March 27, 2019. The brief is available here.\n\nOn January 11, 2019, the Clinic filed a merits brief in Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck, a case on the question of whether Manhattan’s first-come, first-served public-access television station is a public forum, making its administrator a state actor subject to § 1983 suits. The clinic represented the respondents, DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto Melendez, independent filmmakers who had been barred from the station and were suing the nonprofit administrator. It was argued on February 25 2019. The brief is available here.\n\n2018\n\nOn December 19, 2018, the Clinic filed a merits brief in Smith v. Berryhill, arguing for petitioner, Ricky Lee Smith, that the Social Security Appeal’s Council’s decision to reject his disability claim on the ground that the appeal was untimely—and therefore end his administrative appeal—is a “final decision” subject to judicial review under Section 405(g). Oral argument took place on March 18, 2019. The brief is available here.\n\nOn December 9, 2018, the Clinic filed a brief in opposition to certiorari on behalf of John Doe.

The Supreme Court denied certiorari. The brief in The First Presbyterian Church U.S.A. of Tulsa, Oklahoma v. Doe is available here.\n\nOn November 20, 2018, the Clinic filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on behalf of Erick Virgil Hall. The petition argues that certain of the aggravating factors that Idaho uses to impose the death sentence do not provide juries with constitutionally adequate guidance and do not sufficiently narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. The Supreme Court denied certiorari. The brief in Hall v. State of Idaho is available here.\n\nOn November 21, 2018, the Clinic filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on behalf of Manuel Enrique Santana. The question presented was whether the use of a name, without more, constitutes the use of a “means of identification of another person” under the federal aggravated identity theft statute (18 U.S.C. § 1028A). The petition argued that it does not. The Supreme Court denied certiorari. The petition for Santana v. United States is available here.\n\nOn June 4, 2018, the Clinic won a 9-0 victory for R.

Appling is available here. The Clinic's brief for Mr. Appling is available here.\n\nOn May 25, 2018, the Clinic filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on behalf of Ricky Lee Smith.

The petition in Smith v. Berryhill is available here.\n\nOn May 9, 2018, the Clinic filed a brief in opposition to certiorari on behalf of John Moody and other Respondents. The brief argues that the Michigan Gaming Board's conduct, which merged administrative and criminal proceedings, is barred by Turley v. Lefkowitz and the protection against coerced waivers of Fifth Amendment rights. The brief in Michigan Gaming Control v. Moody is available here.\n\nOn April 4, 2018, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of Common Cause and the Voting Rights Institute in support of a challenge to Texas's legislative districts on racial gerrymandering grounds.

Perez is available here.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, the Clinic filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on behalf of Sean Garvin raising two constitutional challenges to his conviction and sentencing: (1) whether police could arrest him without a warrant when he stood inside his home's doorway and they stood outside; and (2) whether he could have his sentenced enhanced by a judge finding facts about his history and character, without the involvement of a jury. The petition in Garvin v. New York is available here.\n\nOn February 26, 2018, the Clinic filed a brief in opposition to certiorari on behalf of W.G., a paternal grandmother seeking to maintain visitation with her grandchild post adoption.

The brief in D.T. v. W.G. is available here.\n\nOn February 21, 2018, the Clinic filed a brief in opposition to certiorari on behalf of Dentrell Brown.

Brown is available here.\n\nOn February 12, 2018, the Clinic filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the National Association of Counties, National League of Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors, International City/County Management Association, and International Municipal Lawyers Association in Support of Respondents.

Mansky is available here.\n\n2017\n\nOn December 20, 2017, the Clinic filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on behalf of Branden Huertas.

The brief argues that a warrantless search of a car parked on the curtilage would be a serious breach of those protections and should be illegal. The amicus brief for Collins v. Virginia is available here.\n\n2016\n\nOn December 21, 2016, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of the state of New York, which enacted a law barring retailers from imposing surcharges when customers make purchases with a credit card. The brief argues that the surcharge prohibition is not prohibited by the First Amendment because it is directed at, and affects, the setting of prices, not speech or expressive conduct. As a straightforward economic regulation, the law therefore is subject to, and easily survives, rational basis review. The brief in Expression Hair Design v. Schneiderman is available here.\n\nOn December 21, 2016, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of the National Immigration Law Center arguing that the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies to the deportation law 18 U.S.C. § 16, as incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act, with equal stringency as it does when applied in the criminal context. The brief in Lynch v. Dimaya is available here.\n\nOn November 21, 2016, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers supporting Shannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden. Nelson and Madden were two Colorado residents challenging a Colorado law requiring that criminal defendants whose convictions are reversed show, by clear and convincing evidence, that they are innocent before they can be refunded fees paid at the time of conviction. The brief argues that the Colorado law departs from longstanding legal tradition and violates due process. The brief in Nelson v. Colorado is available here.\n\nOn November 6, 2016, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of several Native American Organizations in a suit involving the Patent and Trademark Office’s refusal to register a racially disparaging trademark.

The brief in Lee v. Tam is available here.\n\nOn July 5, 2016, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of religious and civil rights organizations supporting Missouri’s restriction of certain government funds to churches.

The brief in Trinity Lutheran Church v. Pauley is available here.\n\nOn March 16, 2016, the Clinic filed a petition for certiorari on behalf of Richard Olive, a federal criminal defendant convicted of counts including money laundering and mail and wire fraud.

The petition is available here.\n\nOn February 4, 2016, the Clinic filed a merits brief on behalf of three criminal defendants who had been stopped under suspicion of driving under the influence. The three states involved each had statutes criminalizing refusal to submit to warrantless breath and/or blood tests. The brief argued these statutes were unconstitutional because individuals may not be subjected to criminal penalties for refusing to submit to a search that is not authorized by a warrant or that does not fall under the warrant exception. The Court held that the Fourth Amendment permits warrantless breath tests incident to arrests for drunk driving but not warrantless blood tests. The brief in Birchfield v. North Dakota is available here.\n\nOn January 12, 2016, the Clinic filed a petition for certiorari on behalf of Alejandro Garcia de La Paz and Daniel Frias, who were stopped by federal agents without probable cause solely because of their Hispanic appearance and thereby in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Coy is available here.\n\n2015\n\nOn November 13, 2015, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of constitutional law scholars arguing that the principles of stare decisis counsel against overruling the Court’s 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, which held that mandatory union fees are permissible in public workplaces. The brief in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association is available here.\n\nOn April 22, 2015, the Clinic filed a petition for certiorari on behalf of Sandra Yamileth Espinal-Andrades. Ms. Espinal, a lawful permanent resident from El Salvador, was removed from the United States after an Immigration Court determined that her state arson conviction constituted an “aggravated felony” under the Immigration and Naturalization Act. The petition argues that certain state crimes, including Ms. Espinal’s, do not qualify as aggravated felonies under the Act. The petition in Espinal-Andrades v. Holder is available here.\n\n2014\n\nOn December 4, 2014, the Clinic filed a brief in opposition to certiorari on behalf of Jack Lee Schaufele. The brief argues that the courts below properly considered the totality of the circumstances in holding that a warrantless and nonconsensual draw of Schaufele’s blood violated the Fourth Amendment, in circumstances where law enforcement authorities could have obtained a warrant without compromising the efficacy of the search. The brief in Colorado v. Schaufele is available here.\n\nOn December 2, 2014, the Clinic filed a petition for certiorari on behalf of Ronald Salahuddin, a federal criminal defendant in New Jersey who was convicted of conspiracy to commit extortion under the Hobbs Act. The petition argues that conviction of conspiracy under the Hobbs Act requires proof of an overt act in furtherance of that conspiracy. The petition in Salahuddin v. United States is available here.\n\nOn April 30, 2014, the Clinic filed a brief in opposition to certiorari on behalf of an Indiana man who was granted a writ of habeas corpus because he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his appellate lawyer failed to raise the issue of the state's untimely amendment of the charges against him, which the Indiana Supreme Court had stated was meritorious and which that court ultimately decided in favor of a criminal defendant in a subsequent case. The brief in Brown v. Shaw is available here.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of the Center for Democracy & Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in two pending cases concerning the application of the \"search incident to arrest\" doctrine to cell phones. The brief contends that, in light of the unprecedented volume and variety of information that people carry on portable digital devices, these devices cannot ordinarily be searched without a warrant simply because they were found on a suspect's person at the time of arrest. The brief in Riley v. California and United States v. Wurie is available here.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of the Government Accountability Project in a pending case concerning the scope of First Amendment protection for public employees who suffer retaliation at the hands of their employers after providing sworn testimony to a court or legislative body. The brief highlights the public importance of government whistleblowers who regularly expose corruption, fraud, and other forms of misconduct through their testimony, explaining why the First Amendment provides a constitutional floor of protection for this activity. The brief in Lane v. Franks is available here.\n\nOn February 26, 2014, the Clinic filed a brief in opposition to a petition for certiorari filed by the State of Arizona seeking review of a decision by an Arizona state court that ordered a local sheriff to return marijuana that belonged to a woman entitled to possess it under Arizona’s medical marijuana law.

The brief in Castleman v. United States is available here.\n\nOn March 29, 2013, the Clinic filed a petition for certiorari on behalf of a federal criminal defendant in Tennessee who was convicted for making a YouTube video containing a threat against a judge and who contends that the government should have been required under the federal threat statute and the First Amendment to prove that he subjectively intended to threaten the judge. The petition in Jeffries v. United States is available here.\n\nOn March 1, 2013, the Clinic filed an amicus brief on behalf of numerous constitutional law scholars to argue that the Court has case-or-controversy jurisdiction over the challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The brief in United States v. Windsor is available here.\n\nOn February 8, 2013, the Clinic filed a petition for certiorari on behalf of Eric Wilson, a member of the “Norfolk Four,” who was wrongly convicted on the basis of a false confession procured by police misconduct. Mr. Wilson served more than seven years in prison as a result of his wrongful conviction and he is subject now to mandatory sex-offender registration and reporting laws. The petition for certiorari contends that Mr. Wilson remains in “custody” by virtue of his being subject to mandatory lifetime sex offender registration and reporting laws and that he should therefore be permitted to raise a habeas corpus challenge to vacate his wrongful conviction. The petition for writ of certiorari is here.\n\nOn January 4, 2013, the Court granted certiorari in Adoptive Couple v.
