Purpose The purpose of the Convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons with disabilities. II. Background The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was negotiated from 2002 to 2006, and was adopted on December 13, 2006. It was opened for signature on March 30, 2007. One hundred and forty-six countries and the European Union are parties to the Convention. The Convention is based squarely on American constitutional values such as equality, the protection of vulnerable minorities, and the unalienable right to pursue happiness. The Convention is also heavily influenced by the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, which has allowed the United States to provide greater legal protections against discrimination for individuals with disabilities than most of the rest of the world. Without laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act, the estimated 1 billion disabled people worldwide are vulnerable to discrimination and the deprivation of community resources. Ninety percent of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school, and disabled children are sometimes denied even the most basic civil rights, such as birth certificates and names. Ratification of the Convention will advance America's national interest in numerous ways. The United States has become a world leader in protecting the rights of disabled individuals through the promulgation and enforcement of legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Joining the Convention will be a vital step in exporting America's leadership on disability non- discrimination, so as to better promote the fundamental freedoms and individual autonomy of individuals with disabilities. Ratification would assist in leveling the playing field for U.S. companies that are already required to meet robust disability-accessible standards, and would open new markets for their products. Americans with disabilities often face significant and, at times, prohibitive barriers when they travel, work, serve, study and reside in other countries. This includes millions of America's veterans, as well as military family members with special needs. Ratification of the Convention will allow the United States to more effectively support, assist, and encourage other countries to bring their domestic laws into compliance with the Convention and up to and in line with U.S. standards. Such action will not just benefit the 1 billion disabled individuals worldwide, but will also be of invaluable help to the 54 million Americans with disabilities, including our disabled servicemen and women and disabled veterans, by enabling them to travel, work, serve, study and reside in other countries without prohibitive barriers. III. Major Provisions A detailed article-by-article analysis of the convention may be found in the Letter of Submittal from the Secretary of State to the President (``Letter of Submittal''). Key provisions of the treaty are summarized below. Scope of the Convention The Convention is intended to recognize and protect the rights of individuals with disabilities. Its stated purpose is ``to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.'' Article 3 sets out the broad principles of the Convention, which include autonomy, acceptance, and accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Equality and non-discrimination are over-arching principles that permeate the entire Convention. All Parties to the Convention agree to ``ensure and promote the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities without discrimination of any kind on the basis of disability.'' Article 4 requires Parties to adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures for the implementation of the rights in the Convention. The Convention's provisions can generally be grouped into the following categories: accessibility, education, equality, employment, and health. Definition of Disability The Convention does not contain an explicit definition of ``disability.'' Article 1 states that persons with disabilities ``include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.'' As the Letter of Submittal makes clear, the absence of an express definition of the terms ``disability'' and ``persons with disabilities'' was a conscious decision at the negotiating conference for the Convention. As explained in the letter of submittal, ``the convention is not intended to supplant detailed and precise definitions of disability found in national legislation but is rather intended to afford States Parties flexibility in defining disability under domestic law.'' As the U.S. legal framework demonstrates, this approach is preferable given that the definition of these terms may vary depending on the purpose of the law (e.g. employment discrimination or access to health services). See Letter of Submittal at 3-5. Accessibility Provisions One fundamental goal of the Convention is to enable disabled persons to live independently and participate in all aspects of life. To that end, Article 9 requires States Parties to: take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. These measures include the removal of obstacles to buildings, transportation, information, communications, and electronic and emergency services. Article 18 of the Convention directs States Parties to recognize the rights of disabled individuals to ``liberty of movement,'' to provide the freedom to choose their residence, and to guarantee the right to a nationality, on an equal basis with others. In particular, it requires States Parties to ensure that disabled persons are not deprived of their nationality or their ability to enter their country, arbitrarily or on the basis of their disability, and are free to leave any country, without discrimination on the basis of their disability. Article 18 requires children with disabilities to be ``registered immediately after birth and [to] have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by their parents.'' This language was placed in Article 18 to combat the practice of denying personhood status for infants with disabilities, which occurs in certain parts of the world and in many cases leads to infanticide. Article 19 emphasizes the right of all persons with disabilities to live and participate in the community on an equal basis. States Parties to the Convention must ensure that people with disabilities have both the opportunity to select their place of residence on an equal basis with others, and the ability to access residential and other community support services, including whatever assistance is necessary for inclusion in the local community. Article 20 emphasizes that States Parties must attempt to ensure personal mobility for people with disabilities, in part by facilitating access to assistive technologies and forms of live assistance. Education Provisions Article 24 of the Convention requires States Parties to ``ensure an inclusive education system at all levels.'' Children with disabilities must be offered the same opportunities for free primary and secondary education as granted to other children in their communities. Their individual needs must be reasonably accommodated, and they must receive support ``to facilitate their effective education.'' Additionally, the Convention specifically requires that Parties facilitate the learning of methods of communication, such as sign language and Braille, so as to assist students with disabilities in fully participating in the educational process. Employment Provisions Article 27 of the Convention recognizes a right of individuals with disabilities to work in an ``environment that is open, inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities.'' By joining the Convention, Parties agree to prohibit employment discrimination based on an employee or applicant's disability. If necessary, the Parties are to adopt legislation to bar such discrimination in various aspects of the employment process, including recruitment, hiring, retention, promotion, and termination. There must be reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, such as access to training programs and the ability to exercise labor rights on an equal basis with others. States Parties must also employ persons with disabilities in the public sector on a non- discrimination basis. Equality Provisions Article 5 of the Convention creates a broad prohibition against discrimination and requires States Parties to recognize that ``all persons are equal before and under the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law.'' States Parties to the Convention must accordingly prohibit discrimination based on disability and take steps to ensure that reasonable accommodation is provided to disabled individuals. In Article 10, States Parties reaffirm ``that every human being has the inherent right to life,'' and agree to take all necessary measures to ``ensure its effective enjoyment by persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others.'' Articles 12 and 13 mandate equal recognition before the law for disabled persons. States Parties must provide equal access to their justice systems, and ensure that measures relating to the exercise of legal capacity respect the rights, will and preferences of the person, are free of conflict of interest and undue influence, are proportional and tailored to the person's circumstances, apply for the shortest time possible and are subject to regular review by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body. In addition, Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention specifically recognize the human rights of women and children with disabilities. Article 14 requires States Parties to ensure that persons with disabilities are not unlawfully or arbitrarily deprived of liberty, while Article 15 states that persons should not be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 16 requires States Parties to take measures to protect individuals with disabilities from all forms of exploitation, violence, and abuse--including gender- based abuse--as well as provide for the physical and psychological recovery of victims and investigation and, where appropriate, prosecution of perpetrators. Article 21 declares that disabled persons must be able to exercise their right to freedom of expression and opinion, through all forms of communication, on an equal basis with others. It advocates the provision of information in accessible formats and technologies, and the facilitation of sign language, Braille, and other alternative methods of communication. Article 23 requires States Parties to eliminate discrimination against persons with disabilities in domestic matters, such as marriage and parenthood. Article 28 requires States Parties to promote realization by people with disabilities of their equal right to an adequate standard of living and equal access to food, clothing, and housing. Article 29 requires States Parties to guarantee equal political rights to persons with disabilities, including accessible procedures for voting, and to promote their participation in public affairs. Finally, Article 30 requires States Parties to recognize the rights of disabled individuals to take part in cultural life and recreational and sporting activities, on a non-discriminatory basis. Health Provisions Under Article 25 of the Convention, the States Parties recognize that individuals with disabilities have the same right as others to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. They must be offered the same range, quality, and standard of care as that available to other persons. Health care professionals must provide care on the same basis as they would provide if the individual seeking care did not have a disability. So long as national law permits, Article 25 also prohibits discrimination based on disability in the provision of health and life insurance. Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Article 34 of the Convention creates a Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, whose members are elected by States Parties to the Convention. States Parties are required to submit periodic reports to the Committee that detail the measures they have taken to implement their obligations, as well as progress toward implementation. The Committee will then return ``such suggestions and general recommendations on the report as it may consider appropriate.'' These recommendations are advisory only, and are not binding on States Parties. IV. Entry Into Force and Amendments The Convention enters into force for a ratifying or acceding State on the thirtieth day after its instrument of ratification or accession has been deposited. For the United States, this means thirty days after the deposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification with the advice and consent of the Senate. Amendments to articles 34, 38, 39 and 40 (which concern the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) may be adopted only by a consensus decision of States Parties to the Convention. If adopted, such amendments enter into force and become binding on all States Parties thirty days after two- thirds of all States Parties submit instruments of ratification for the amendment. For all other articles of the Convention, amendments may be adopted by majority vote at a meeting at which at least two- thirds of States Parties are present. If adopted, such amendments enter into force thirty days after two thirds of States Parties submit instruments of ratification for the amendment. However, such amendments are binding only on those States Parties that submit instruments of ratification. V. Withdrawal Pursuant to Article 48, a Party may withdraw from the Convention by written notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. This withdrawal becomes effective one year after the receipt of notification. VI. Implementing Legislation The provisions of the convention are not self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot be directly enforced by U.S. courts or give rise to individually enforceable rights in the United States. The United States has a comprehensive network of existing federal and state disability laws and enforcement mechanisms, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq.; the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 791 et seq.; the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 251(a)(2) and 255; the Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 3601 et seq.; the Air Carrier Access Act, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 41705; the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973ee et seq.; the Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 15301-15545; the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973gg et seq.; the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1997 et seq.; the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 101 et seq.; the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 200ff et seq.; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.C.C. Sec. 1400 et seq., and the Architectural Barriers Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 4151 et seq.. In addition, disability nondiscrimination provisions have been integrated into statutes of general applicability to federal policies and programs. See Letter of Submittal, p. 91. In the vast majority of cases, existing federal and state law meets or exceeds the requirements of the Convention. The recommended reservations in the resolution of advice and consent (discussed in section VIII below) make clear that the United States will limit its obligations under the Convention to exclude the narrow circumstances in which implementation of the Convention could otherwise implicate federalism or private conduct concerns. Ratification of the Convention with the recommended reservations will not alter the balance of power between the federal government and the states. No additional implementing legislation is necessary with respect to the Convention. VII. Committee Action The committee first held a public hearing on the Convention on July 12, 2012. Testimony was received from the Honorable John McCain, United States Senator; the Honorable Tom Harkin, United States Senator; the Honorable Judith Heumann, Special Adviser for International Disability Rights, U.S. Department of State; Ms. Eve Hill, Senior Counselor to the Assistant Attorney General For Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Justice; The Honorable Richard Thornburgh, Former Attorney General of the United States and Counsel for K&L Gates, LLP; Mr. John Wodatch, Former Chief of the Disability Rights Section, Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice; Mr. Steven Groves, Bernard and Barbara Lomas Fellow, The Heritage Foundation; Dr. Michael Farris, Chancellor, Patrick Henry College; and Mr. John Lancaster, 1st Lt., U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.)

Statements for the record were submitted by Senators Ayotte and Kirk, Secretary Ridge, Congresswoman Duckworth, Attorney General Thornburgh, Dr. Yoshihara, Professor Meyer and Dr. Farris. Also entered into the record was a letter of support from former Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, an article supporting the Convention written by former Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist, a Boston Globe article entitled ``The story of Washington gridlock seen through the eyes of Bob Dole,'' an article entitled ``UN Disabilities Treaty does not create abortion rights,'' written by Austin Ruse and Piero A. Tozzi, and a legal memorandum prepared by Patton Boggs (now Squire Patton Boggs). At the November 21, 2013 hearing, testimony was received from the Honorable John F. Kerry, Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State; Ms. Frances W. West, IBM, Worldwide Director of the Human Ability & Accessibility Center; the Honorable C. Boyden Gray, former White House Counsel and Ambassador, currently of C. Boyden Gray and Associates; Mr. Jeremy A. Rabkin, Professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law; and Mr. Curtis A.

In addition, statements of support for the Convention by Secretary of Defense Charles T. Hagel and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki were entered into the record, along with all other petitions, letters and written statements of support for the Convention. On July 22, 2014, the committee considered the Convention and ordered it favorably reported. VIII. Committee Recommendations and Comments A. GENERAL COMMENTS The committee recommends that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification of the Convention. The committee believes that the Convention advances important U.S. interests in a number of vital areas. The committee is persuaded by the support of experts in disability law and advocacy that ratification of the Convention will enable the United States to more effectively advocate on behalf of the millions of disabled Americans. These experts indicate that it will give the United States a stronger, more prominent voice in advocating for standards and practices abroad that comport with the high standards for protection of disabled persons found in U.S. domestic law and practice. In a letter to the committee, which was entered into the record at the November 5, 2013 hearing, former Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell characterized the treaty as ``the most important global platform for the implementation of best practices in disability rights abroad.'' In addition to America's bilateral efforts, ratification will allow the U.S. to nominate U.S. disabilities experts to sit on the Disabilities Committee, which will give the United States a formal voice and vote in the Assembly of States Parties to the Convention. Sustained and effective U.S. leadership in such areas will have a positive, practical impact on the lives of disabled Americans. Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth testified that, when traveling abroad, ``[b]linded veterans have had their guide sticks taken away after being mistaken for weapons,'' that ``[p]eople with artificial limbs have been told to store them in overhead bins,'' and that, when visiting U.S. military bases in Germany and Italy, she could not take wounded veterans ``off post to go see the sights downtown, because they simply were not accessible.'' Many witnesses before the committee testified that U.S. ratification will make it more likely that other governments will adopt standards and regulations concerning the disabled that conform to U.S. standards and practice, and that this will greatly enhance the ability of disabled Americans, including veterans and military families, to travel and work abroad. For example, greater uniformity in standards such as the width of doorways or the size and pitch of ramps would be of great assistance to Americans who use wheelchairs when traveling abroad, not to mention increased opportunities to use wheelchair-accessible buses, grab bars for showers, disability- accessible phones, and many other aspects of the adaptive- device industry. Joining the Convention is also likely to benefit American workers and businesses. In a global economy, it is critical that all U.S. employees have the opportunity to enhance their careers and maintain a competitive edge for their U.S. employer by traveling and working abroad freely, unencumbered by inaccessibility concerns. Moreover, the accessibility standards set forth in the Convention are modeled on U.S. law and practice, and U.S. companies are already required to meet these robust accessibility standards. The global promotion of accessibility standards and regulations that conform to U.S. practice will level the playing field for American businesses that are already equipped to comply with these standards, and will likely give them a competitive edge over any foreign competitors. As the disability standards of foreign countries move closer to those of the United States, new markets will open up for innovative American products and services that are already accessible to the disabled, such as assistive technologies created by the U.S. consumer electronics industry. As discussed in section VI and as explained in detail in the Letter of Submittal, in light of the reservations included in the resolution of advice and consent, current federal and state law meets or exceeds the requirements of the Convention, and no changes to federal or state law will be required as a result of U.S. ratification. B. NATURE OF THE CONVENTION AS A NONDISCRIMINATION INSTRUMENT The committee notes that the Convention is a nondiscrimination instrument, requiring that services and opportunities be made available on an equal basis to persons with disabilities and those without disabilities. Therefore, as the second understanding in the resolution of advice and consent makes clear, with respect to certain economic, social and cultural rights mentioned in the Convention, States Parties to the Convention are not obligated to provide new rights by virtue of accession to the Convention; rather the obligations of Parties to the Convention are to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of such rights only insofar as they are already recognized and implemented under domestic law. This concept includes health services, as Article 25 of the Convention makes clear. In the course of the committee's consideration of the Convention, an understanding was added to the resolution of advice and consent stating that Article 25 requires that health programs and procedures are provided to individuals with disabilities on a non-discriminatory basis and does not address the provision of any particular health program or procedure. C. THE DISABILITIES COMMITTEE In the course of the committee's consideration of the Convention, questions were raised concerning the role of the Disabilities Committee, which was established under Article 34 of the Convention. As discussed above, by ratifying the Convention, the U.S. will have the ability to nominate American citizens to serve as experts on the Disabilities Committee. American engagement with the Disabilities Committee will provide critical expertise and leadership to countries looking for the best practices in assisting those with disabilities, which will subsequently inure to the benefit of disabled Americans when they travel, work, serve, study and reside abroad. The Convention will require the United States to submit periodic reports to the Disabilities Committee for its review. In these reports, U.S. officials will have the opportunity to highlight the effectiveness of U.S. laws and practices concerning individuals with disabilities, and to demonstrate that our laws and standards are an exemplary model for the rest of the world. The text of the Convention makes clear that the role of the Disabilities Committee is limited. The Disabilities Committee is authorized under Article 36 to ``consider'' State Party Reports and to ``make such suggestions and general recommendations on the report as it may consider appropriate.'' Under Article 37, the Disabilities Committee ``shall give due consideration to ways and means of enhancing national capacities for the implementation of the present Convention.'' The Disabilities Committee has no authority to compel actions by states parties. Secretary Kerry confirmed this when he testified that ``the Disabilities Committee has absolutely zero power to change a law, to order a change of law, to compel a change of law.'' While the conclusions, recommendations, or general comments issued by the Disabilities Committee could in some instances reflect established customary international law, the Disabilities Committee has no authority to create customary international law, and such statements by the Disabilities Committee do not, in and of themselves, constitute customary international law, as the sixth understanding in the resolution of advice and consent makes clear. States parties to the Convention are not required to give greater weight to the interpretation of the Convention by the Disabilities Committee than they do their own interpretation, and are not required to conform their interpretations to or make them consistent with those of the Disabilities Committee. D. PARENTAL RIGHTS The committee closely reviewed the ``best interests of the child'' standard set forth in Article 7 of the Convention, including whether U.S. ratification of the Convention could negatively impact parental rights with respect to disabled children, including parents who opt to home-school disabled children. Former Secretary and Governor Tom Ridge testified that the Convention ``does not affect the ability of a parent to act in the best interest of the child.'' In the July 2012 hearing, the Department of Justice testified unequivocally that parental rights would not be hindered in any way. In response to written questions for the record, Senior Counselor to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Eve Hill stated that ``[i]n light of the federalism and private conduct reservations, among others, there would be no change to Federal, State or local law regarding the ability of parents in the United States to make decisions about how to raise or educate their children as a result of ratification.'' To emphasize the unified views of the Senate and the executive branch on this issue, the Committee unanimously agreed to include the seventh understanding in the resolution of advice and consent, which makes clear that the term or principle of the ``best interests of the child'' as used in Article 7(2) will be applied and interpreted to be coextensive with its application and interpretation under United States law, and that nothing in Article 7 requires a change to existing United States law. At the July 22, 2014, business meeting, the committee adopted an understanding, offered by Senator Barrasso, that explicitly states that ``[n]othing in the Convention limits the rights of parents to homeschool their children.''

DISCUSSION REGARDING THE RESOLUTION OF ADVICE AND CONSENT The committee has included a number of reservations, understandings, and declarations in the resolution of advice and consent. The committee notes that Article 46 of the Convention makes clear that reservations to the treaty are permitted, provided that they are not incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention. The committee notes that it is well-established in American jurisprudence that courts must respect the reservations, understandings, and declarations to the ratification of treaties. In their study of RUDs and human rights treaties, Professors Curtis Bradley and Jack Goldsmith concluded that ``[i]n sum, since the early days of the nation, the President and Senate have attached a variety of conditions to their consent to treaties. No court has ever invalidated these conditions.'' Curtis A. Bradley & Jack L. Goldsmith, Treaties, Human Rights, and Conditional Consent, 149 U. Pa. L. Rev. 399, 410 (2000). 1. Reservations Section (a) of the resolution contains three reservations. Federalism. The first reservation addresses federalism issues. Article 4(1) of the Convention states that the provisions of the Convention ``shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions.'' Because certain provisions of the treaty concern matters traditionally governed by state law rather than federal law, and because in very limited instances some state and local standards are less vigorous than the convention would require, a reservation is required to preserve the existing balance between federal and state jurisdiction over these matters. Non-Regulation of Private Conduct. The second reservation concerns the extent of the United States obligations under the Convention with regard to private conduct. Although the United States generally and broadly applies nondiscrimination laws to private entities with respect to operation in public spheres of life, some laws set a threshold before their protections are triggered. For example, selected employment-related civil rights laws apply only to employers that have 15 or more employees. Thus, existing legislation does not extend to absolutely all private discrimination against persons with disabilities, such as actions by a sole proprietor or rental of a single-family home. Further, individual privacy and freedom from governmental interference in certain private conduct are also recognized as among the fundamental values of our free and democratic society. Accordingly, a reservation is required to make clear that the United States does not accept any obligation under the Convention to enact legislation or take any other measures with respect to private conduct except as mandated by the Constitution and laws of the United States. The committee notes that in a written response for the record, the Department of State and the Department of Justice confirmed that in light of this reservation, ratification of the Disabilities Convention would not impose any new requirements on employers exempted by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Torture, Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment. The third reservation concerns the extent of the United States obligations under Article 15 (Freedom from Torture or Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment). As Article 15 of the Convention covers the same subject matter as Articles 2 and 16 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the third reservation makes clear that the obligations of the United States under Article 15 of the Convention shall be subject to the same reservations and understandings that apply to U.S. ratification of those two treaties. 2. Understandings Section (b) of the resolution contains eight understandings. First Amendment. The first understanding makes clear that the Convention, including Article 8, does not authorize or require legislation or other action that would restrict the right of free speech, expression, and association protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America. Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The second understanding makes clear that with respect to the application of certain economic, social and cultural rights set forth in specific articles of the Convention, the United States understands that its obligations are only to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of any such rights insofar as they are recognized and implemented under U.S. federal law.Equal Employment Opportunity. The third understanding makes clear that the Convention does not require the adoption of a comparable worth framework for persons with disabilities. The committee notes that in a written response for the record, the Department of State and the Department of Justice confirmed their view that current U.S. law is consistent with the language in Article 27 regarding equal pay for work of equal value. U.S. Military Departments. The fourth understanding concerns Article 27 of the Convention and the obligation to take appropriate steps to afford to individuals with disabilities the right to equal access to equal work, including nondiscrimination in hiring and promotion of employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector. Under current U.S. law, certain departments of the U.S. military charged with defense of the national security are exempted from liability under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The understanding makes clear that the United States understands the obligations of Article 27 to take appropriate steps as not affecting hiring, promotion, or other terms or conditions of employment of uniformed employees in the U.S. military departments and that Article 2 does not recognize rights in this regard that exceed those rights available under U.S. federal law. Definitions. The fifth understanding clarifies that the terms ``disability'', ``persons with disabilities'', and ``undue burden'' (terms that are not defined in the Convention), ``discrimination on the basis of disability'', and ``reasonable accommodation'' are defined for the United States of America coextensively with the definitions of such terms pursuant to relevant United States law. Article 34 Committee. The sixth understanding concerns the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, established under Article 34 of the Convention. It clarifies with particularity the limited powers of that Committee, including that it has no authority to compel actions by the United States, and the United States does not consider conclusions, recommendations, or general comments issued by the Committee as constituting customary international law or to be legally binding on the United States in any manner. It also clarifies that the United States does not consider the Committee's interpretations to be legally binding on the United States. Health Programs and Procedures. The seventh understanding clarifies that the Convention is a non-discrimination instrument, and that therefore nothing in the Convention, including Article 25, addresses the provision of any particular health program or procedure. Rather, the Convention requires that health programs and procedures are provided to individuals with disabilities on a non-discriminatory basis.Best Interest of the Child. The eighth understanding concerns the ``best interests of the child'' standard set forth in Article 7(2) of the Convention. It clarifies that the term or principle of the ``best interests of the child'' as used in Article 7(2), will be applied and interpreted to be coextensive with its application and interpretation under United States law, and that consistent with this understanding, nothing in Article 7 requires a change to existing United States Federal, State, or local law. Homeschooling. The ninth understanding states that nothing in the Convention limits the rights of parents to homeschool their children. 3. Declarations Section (c) of the resolution contains two declarations. Non Self-Executing. The first declaration states that the provisions of the Convention are not self-executing. This reflects the shared understanding of the committee and the executive branch that the provisions of the Treaty are not self-executing, are not directly enforceable in U.S. courts, and do not confer private rights of action enforceable in the United States. U.S. Law Complies. The second declaration provides that, in view of the reservations to be included in the instrument of ratification, current United States law fulfills or exceeds the obligations of the Convention for the United States. As discussed in section VI above, the committee is satisfied that, in view of the reservations in the resolution of advice and consent and the comprehensive network of existing federal and state disability laws and enforcement mechanisms, no implementing legislation is necessary for the United States to comply with the Convention. IX. Text of Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein), SECTION 1. SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO RESERVATIONS, UNDERSTANDINGS, AND DECLARATIONS. The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 13, 2006, and signed by the United States of America on June 30, 2009 (``the Convention'') (Treaty Doc. 112-7), subject to the reservations of section 2, the understandings of section 3, and the declarations of section 4. SEC. 2. RESERVATIONS. The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of the Convention is subject to the following reservations, which shall be included in the instrument of ratification: (1) The Convention shall be implemented by the Federal Government of the United States of America to the extent that it exercises legislative and judicial jurisdiction over the matters covered therein, and otherwise by the State and local governments. To the extent that State and local governments exercise jurisdiction over such matters, the obligations of the United States of America under the Convention are limited to the Federal Government's taking measures appropriate to the Federal system, which may include enforcement action against State and local actions that are inconsistent with the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), or other Federal laws, with the ultimate objective of fully implementing the Convention. (2) The Constitution and laws of the United States of America establish extensive protections against discrimination, reaching all forms of governmental activity as well as significant areas of non- governmental activity. Individual privacy and freedom from governmental interference in certain private conduct are also recognized as among the fundamental values of our free and democratic society. The United States of America understands that by its terms the Convention can be read to require broad regulation of private conduct. To the extent it does, the United States of America does not accept any obligation under the Convention to enact legislation or take other measures with respect to private conduct except as mandated by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America. (3) Article 15 of the Convention memorializes existing prohibitions on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment contained in Articles 2 and 16 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly December 10, 1984, and entered into force June 26, 1987 (the ``CAT'') and in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly December 16, 1966, and entered into force March 23, 1976 (the ``ICCPR''), and further provides that such protections shall be extended on an equal basis with respect to persons with disabilities. To ensure consistency of application, the obligations of the United States of America under Article 15 of the Convention shall be subject to the same reservations and understandings that apply for the United States of America with respect to Articles 1 and 16 of the CAT and Article 7 of the ICCPR. SEC. 3. UNDERSTANDINGS. The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of the Convention is subject to the following understandings, which shall be included in the instrument of ratification: (1) The United States of America understands that this Convention, including Article 8 thereof, does not authorize or require legislation or other action that would restrict the right of free speech, expression, and association protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America. (2) Given that under Article 1 of the Convention ``[t]he purpose of the present Convention is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities,'' with respect to the application of the Convention to matters related to economic, social, and cultural rights, including in Articles 4(2), 24, 25, 27, 28, and 30, the United States of America understands that its obligations in this respect are to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of any such rights insofar as they are recognized and implemented under United States law. (3) Current United States law provides strong protections for persons with disabilities against unequal pay, including the right to equal pay for equal work. The United States of America understands the Convention to require the protection of rights of individuals with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including individuals in other protected groups, and does not require adoption of a comparable worth framework for persons with disabilities. (4) Article 27 of the Convention provides that States Parties shall take appropriate steps to afford to individuals with disabilities the right to equal access to equal work, including nondiscrimination in hiring and promotion of employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector. Current interpretation of Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791) exempts United States military departments charged with defense of the national security from liability with regard to members of the uniformed services. The United States of America understands the obligations of Article 27 to take appropriate steps as not affecting hiring, promotion, or other terms or conditions of employment of uniformed employees in the United States military departments, and that Article 27 does not recognize rights in this regard that exceed those rights available under United States law. (5) The United States of America understands that the terms ``disability,'' ``persons with disabilities,'' and ``undue burden'' (terms that are not defined in the Convention), ``discrimination on the basis of disability,'' and ``reasonable accommodation'' are defined for the United States of America coextensively with the definitions of such terms pursuant to relevant United States law. (6) The United States understands that the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, established under Article 34 of the Convention, has an important, but limited and advisory role. The United States understands that the Committee has no authority to compel actions by the United States, and the United States does not consider conclusions, recommendations, or general comments issued by the Committee as constituting customary international law or to be legally binding on the United States in any manner. The United States further understands that the Committee's interpretations of the Convention are not legally binding on the United States. (7) The United States of America understands that the Convention is a nondiscrimination instrument. Therefore, nothing in the Convention, including Article 25, addresses the provision of any particular health program or procedure. Rather, the Convention requires that health programs and procedures are provided to individuals with disabilities on a nondiscriminatory basis. (8) The United States of America understands that, for the United States of America, the term or principle of the ``best interests of the child'' as used in Article 7(2), will be applied and interpreted to be coextensive with its application and interpretation under United States law. Consistent with this understanding, nothing in Article 7 requires a change to existing United States Federal, State, or local law. (9) Nothing in the Convention limits the rights of parents to homeschool their children. SEC. 4. DECLARATIONS. The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of the Convention is subject to the following declarations: (1) The United States of America declares that the provisions of the Convention are not self-executing. (2) The Senate declares that, in view of the reservations to be included in the instrument of ratification, current United States law fulfills or exceeds the obligations of the Convention for the United States of America. X. Minority Views of Senators Corker, Risch, Rubio, and Johnson BACKGROUND The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 13, 2006. While the United States joined consensus on adopting the Convention, the United States' ultimate position on the convention was well known and had previously been explained in the ``U.S. Participation in the United Nations, 2005'' report to the Congress by the Secretary of State: Since the beginning of the negotiations in 2003 on the draft Comprehensive and Integral International Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities (Disabilities Convention), the United States has maintained that disability issues are within the purview of domestic policy and law; therefore, the United States had no intention of becoming a party to the treaty. Ralph Boyd, Assistant Attorney General, stated during negotiations: ``Given the complex set of regulations needed to canvass this broad area, and the enforcement mechanisms necessary to ensure equal opportunity for those with disabilities, the most constructive way to proceed is for each member state, through action and leadership at home, to pursue within its borders the mission of ensuring that real change and real improvement is brought to their citizens with disabilities. This position was reiterated subsequent to adoption of the Convention in the ``U.S. Participation in the United Nations, 2006'' report, which was delivered to the Congress in 2008.The report on U.S. Participation in 2006 also describes the limited nature of participation by the United States in negotiations over the text of the Convention: In 2003, the U.S. delegation intervened during negotiations only to give technical advice on U.S. disability law and practice. In 2004, the delegation expanded its engagement to make interventions on issues or articles in the draft text involving international law or practice. In the January-February 2005 and August 2005 negotiations, the United States engaged on a number of key issues, such as establishment of a treaty monitoring body, family issues, and support for the overarching principle of non-discrimination. During the fall of 2005, the United States expanded its engagement to other issues. The United States did have considerable involvement on a few specific issues of particular concern. This involvement was described in the ``Explanation of Position on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities'' announced by Ambassador Richard T. Miller, U.S. Representative to the UN Economic and Social Council on December 13, 2006 upon adoption of the Convention by the General Assembly. One such issue was the relationship of the Convention to the issue of abortion. As the Explanation of Position described: the United States understands that the phrase ``reproductive health'' in Article 25(a) of the draft Convention does not include abortion, and its use in that Article does not create any abortion rights, and cannot be interpreted to constitute support, endorsement, or promotion of abortion. We stated this understanding at the time of adoption of the Convention in the Ad Hoc Committee, and note that no other delegation suggested a different understanding of this term. Having signed the Convention on June 30, 2009, the President has twice referred the Convention to the committee for consideration, the Senate having voted against granting its advice and consent in the 112th Congress. The committee held hearings on the Convention on November 5 and 21, 2013. ANALYSIS Federalism Unlike the typical treaty, which governs the relationship between nation-states, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities seeks to set an international standard for how nations, including the United States should it ratify the treaty, must treat their own citizens. In doing so, the treaty requires our democratically-elected legislative and executive branches at all levels to adopt extensive legislation and regulation governing matters of domestic policy. Because the Convention's obligations are so expansive, the article by article analysis (the ``analysis'') enclosed in the Letter of Submittal cites 13 different federal statutes as well as provisions of at least 24 other federal laws that contribute to fulfilling them. While the Letter of Submittal is unclear on whether the United States would rely on state and local law to satisfy our obligations under the Convention, it notes that ``certain treaty provisions cover matters traditionally governed by state law,'' and goes on to assert that ``some state and local standards are less vigorous than the convention would require.'' While the Administration concludes from this that it would be appropriate to adopt a federalism reservation to ``preserve the existing balance between federal and state jurisdiction,'' it is not evident what this means in practice. The Administration's proposed federalism reservation, which remains in the present resolution, states: This convention shall be implemented by the Federal Government of the United States of America to the extent that it exercises legislative and judicial jurisdiction over the matters covered therein, and otherwise by the state and local governments; The reservation therefore appears to explicitly assert that where the Federal Government does not ``exercise ... jurisdiction,'' the Convention ``shall be implemented ... by state and local governments.'' This would appear to contemplate state and local law accounting for fulfilling some obligations of the United States. The reservation then states: to the extent that state and local governments exercise jurisdiction over such matters, the obligations of the United States of America under the convention are limited to the Federal Government's taking measures appropriate to the Federal system, which may include enforcement action against state and local actions that are inconsistent with the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, or other Federal laws, with the ultimate objective of fully implementing the Convention. By first stating that the Convention ``shall be implemented ... by state and local governments,'' and then by limiting our obligations in those areas where state and local governments exercise jurisdiction ``to the Federal Government's taking measures appropriate to the Federal system,'' it is unclear whether the Administration seeks to limit the scope of our obligations under the treaty, or only the means by which our obligations will be fully implemented. While similar language can be found in understandings submitted by the United States with ratification of previous UN human rights conventions, and diplomatic ambiguity has its advantages, it also carries significant legal risks as discussed below. The Letter of Submittal's article by article analysis also fails to bring clarity to the issue as it engages in significant discussion of relevant state laws throughout. In some cases, where it deems state and local law to be consistent with the Convention, the analysis appears to claim reliance on these state and local laws for United States compliance with the Convention. For instance, p. 42 of the analysis describes: Various state criminal laws that require protection and reporting of exploitation, violence, and abuse, including of individuals with disabilities, also further compliance with this article [Article 16]. However, the analysis also suggests that some state laws may not comply with Convention standards. For instance, p. 32 of the analysis states: Despite these positive changes in guardianship provisions in most states, many state constitutions and statutory provisions continue to limit the full exercise of civil and political rights of persons deemed incompetent. In these instances where state law is not uniform and may fall short of the Convention's requirements, the analysis indicates that U.S. compliance ``is subject to the federalism reservation.'' For instance, p. 31 of the analysis describes: Further, as described in detail below, and subject to the federalism reservation described above, there has been a significant trend toward the modernization of guardianship standards, moving most states into conformity with Article 12. This selective referral to the federalism reservation in instances when state laws may fall short raises again the question of whether the present reservation addresses general limits on the scope of our accepted obligations under the Convention, or only addresses the level of government that will be responsible for fully implementing them. These statements also raise concerns about Secretary Kerry's testimony before the committee that ``ratification doesn't require a single change to American law.'' These questions could have significant legal implications for the United States. First, by failing to clearly limit the scope of our obligations under the Convention in the federalism reservation while noting potential concerns about state level compliance, the United States risks the perception (and potential reality) of being in violation of our international legal obligations on a human rights treaty. This can harm our standing with those who share our values, and it can frustrate our efforts to encourage those who don't. Second, we risk dramatically altering the Constitution. Under the Constitution, the federal government has limited powers, and much authority over the everyday lives of Americans is left to the states. However, in the 1920 Supreme Court case of Missouri v. Holland, the Supreme Court is understood to have held that the federal government's power can be expanded well beyond the Constitution's normal limits through ratification of a treaty. Because the Convention deals extensively with matters that the Constitution typically leaves to the states, ratifying this treaty risks significantly expanding federal authority. The committee heard testimony from the Department of Justice in the 112th Congress stating that ``the federalism reservation would preserve the existing balance of authority between the Federal Government and the States.'' However, the committee heard testimony in its hearing on November 21, 2013 of the 113th Congress from Mr. Curtis A. Bradley, William Van Alstyne Professor at the Duke University School of Law, that none of the reservations adopted by the committee in the 112th Congress--which remain in the present resolution--```adequately address[] the constitutional concerns.'' Professor Bradley explained: The federalism reservation refers vaguely to ``measures appropriate to the Federal system,'' but that might include measures allowed under Missouri v. Holland, and the reservation specifically states that the federal government can take enforcement measures against state and local actions that are inconsistent with ``other Federal laws,'' which might include laws that Congress enacts in the future under the authority conferred by Missouri v. Holland. Professor Bradley recommended that the committee adopt a reservation that ``makes clear that the Convention will not expand the authority of the federal government,'' and described precedent for such a reservation. Professor Bradley also pointed out that a strong federalism reservation is critical for another reason. The Convention's terms are not coextensive with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other United States law, and the Convention's obligations go much further than the ADA in scope. As Professor Bradley noted: The Convention refers, for example, to the standards governing the care of children, a family law topic traditionally regulated in the United States under state rather than federal law. In addition, in its accessibility and other provisions, the Convention addresses private as well as governmental conduct, without any of the limitations that would normally apply to federal regulation of private conduct-such as a requirement of a connection to interstate commerce. In addition, the Administration's article by article analysis recognizes that ``[a] core purpose of the convention'' is to eliminate discrimination ``in all sectors of society, including by private persons and entities'', saying: [D]omestic civil rights legislation does not extend to absolutely all private discrimination against persons with disabilities, such as employment discrimination by a sole proprietor or rental of a single-family home. Further, individual privacy and freedom from governmental interference in certain private conduct are also recognized as among the fundamental values of our free and democratic society. As a result, a ``non-regulation of certain private conduct'' reservation is recommended[.] While the Administration's proposed reservation purports to close the gap between the Convention and our laws, Professor Bradley explained that the reservation does not accomplish that goal due to flaws similar to those he identified in the Administration-proposed federalism reservation: [T]he private conduct reservation says that the United States is not accepting any obligation to regulate private conduct ``except as mandated by ... laws of the United States of America.'' Those laws could include statutes enacted in the future pursuant to the authority allowed under Missouri v. Holland. To address this, Professor Bradley correspondingly recommended that the committee adopt a strong federalism reservation. None of these issues are addressed in the present resolution and therefore ratification of the Convention on this basis would pose a substantial risk that the United States would not be in full compliance with our obligations under the Convention and that the Constitution had been altered to greatly expand the power of the federal government. Senate's Advice and Consent to Treaties The Treaty Clause of the Constitution provides that the United States may not ratify a treaty without the Senate's advice and consent. U.S. Const. art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2. The requirement of two-thirds advice and consent by the Senate is an important Constitutional check on the treaty power, and is an especially important structural protection for our system of federalism. Recently, in Bond v. United States, the Department of Justice argued both that Supreme Court precedent allows ratification of a treaty to expand existing federal power to legislate beyond its traditional limits, and that the Framers intended for the Senate to enforce federalism limits on treaties through its advice and consent power. A brief filed by several former Legal Advisors to the Department of State, who have served under presidents of both parties, supported the government's position, arguing that ``as a matter of both constitutional design and practice, the Senate serves as a `guardian of state interests.''' Thus far, the judicial branch has failed to place any federalism limits on the treaty power, and as a result, the responsibility falls to the Senate to protect our system of federalism from treaties that would inappropriately expand federal power, as well as to ensure the Senate's advice and consent is not undermined when such a significant change to our constitutional structure is at stake. Removing any of the conditions of the Senate's advice and consent undermines the predicate on which the treaty was ratified. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the Senate provides its advice and consent again before those RUDs may be altered or removed. As Professor Bradley noted: In my view, the best interpretation of the U.S. Constitution is that new senatorial advice and consent would be required for such a withdrawal. This action would, after all, undo something that was subject to the senatorial advice and consent process and, depending on what was being withdrawn, could have the effect of increasing U.S treaty obligations, which themselves require senatorial advice and consent. Historical practice also supports this view. When the United States withdrew its reservation to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, President Reagan sought (in 1984) and received (in 1986) the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate. However, as Professor Bradley describes: It is possible to imagine a situation, however, in which either the Executive Branch or a majority of Congress would"
