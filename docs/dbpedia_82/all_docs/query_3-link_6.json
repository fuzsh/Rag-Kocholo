        "text": "A Message from Pastor Jeff\n\nRiding the Digital Wave of an Analog Faith\n\nLast month we shared a bit about riding the analog wave of faith—which, for all intents and purposes, boils down to the fact that what most people are looking for in church is relationships. This quote, from last month’s article, does a good job of summing up the conclusion:\n\nFolks can put up with marginal preaching, crummy buildings, and lackluster music, but they won’t stay in a community for long if they don’t “connect” authentically with other persons. That connection happens when we tend to the basics of relationships including sharing, listening, engaging, encouraging, and inviting.\n\nSo how do we form and nurture authentic Christian analog relationships in the very digital world of Facebook, Twitter, and Integra? I’m not sure anyone can fully answer that question, but I would like to explore in this article: 1) some hope, 2) some tools, and 3) some challenges.\n\nFirst, the hope. At one point I found myself pretty much in pastoral despair as I tried to communicate with and form relationships with younger adults and teens. By the time I adapted to the latest form of technology communication they had moved onto the next fad. First they said, “Call my cell phone.” Then it was, “Email me”; then, “Text me”; then “Facebook me” (is that even a verb?); then, “Instagram me.” The digital world creates new paths of communication so quickly, and the digital generation is so adaptable that it becomes almost impossible to know how to reach them.\n\nWhat seems hopeless really isn’t when you begin to see the many avenues of communication as tools rather than trauma. People, young and old, are seeking connections with each other—that is the hope. God made it clear that we are not meant to be alone, so we form tribes of friends, acquaintances, professional alliances, and clubs to satisfy our need to be together. Digital communication—whether it is a Facebook post calling for prayers, or a tweet about a favorite eatery—is an opportunity moment to connect with another person individually or collectively. In a way, we surf the digital wave of communication to help shuttle us toward opportunities for deeper communication—and maybe even authentic sharing—which is at the core, I think, of a growing faith.\n\nBut the media should never be mistaken as the message. Imagine trying to conduct a marriage by leaving voice messages for one another on your cell phones. It can be done, but the discontinuous nature of digital communication makes it difficult to have a meaningful conversation. Second, texting, email, Facebook, and Twitter are not able to communicate the nuances necessary to deeper communication. We need to hear the inflections of voice, see the expressiveness of the face, even experience the smell and touch of a person to communicate on a deeper level.\n\nI contend that deeper communication is better (but not exclusively) done face-to-face. In settling into one another face-to face, we encounter the person God made with their warts, beauty, anger, joy, needs, and love. We can’t switch them off or turn off alerts when things get uncomfortable. In encountering one another in person, we share something deeper than any Facebook message could convey.\n\nSecond, some tools. Digital tools are not bad and they are getting better all the time. Digital tools help us to communicate information quickly and accurately. For faith formation, digital tools like YouTube, Facebook, and collaborative digital meetings are invaluable. So if you have not yet tried Facebook, give it a try. These days you can receive as much or as little as you want. Although I hardly qualify as a heavy Facebook user, I find that folks are much quicker to post about their cancer, their engagement, or their fears on Facebook than to call their pastor or even their best friend. So you might want to use these accounts as tools to engage your friends or even make new ones.\n\nFor faith formation, check out a digital bible like that available from Olive Tree and other publishers. I no longer carry around a printed Bible. My Bible app has tools for study in English, Spanish, and Greek along with the notes from the Lutheran Study Bible. I can even highlight texts and make notes for later reference. One of our LCH members has even downloaded most of the liturgy materials we use in worship and uses his IPad in worship rather than the provided booklet. In other words, surf the digital wave in ways that bring you closer to one another, and to God.\n\nA nice bridge between the digital and analog relationship are apps like FaceTime and Skype that allow us, at least so far as bandwidth will reach, to see and hear our companion, no matter the distance. We have used Skype to conduct interviews, connect with new acquaintances, and share discoveries with friends thousands of miles away. A few years ago, the Thursday Bible Study group was able to include one of its study partners via Skype, even though she was recovering from surgery in her home a few miles away! So digital communication can be a great tool in enhancing our analog faith.\n\nThe challenges of the digital world are no fewer than the analog world. Spiritual and psychological researchers alike caution against a growing tendency toward digital narcissism. In a humorous post to Psychology Today one author notes the growth of the use of selfie-sticks as just such a sign! It is amazing to watch tourists walking in Waikīkī, next to one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, staring at their phones. Technology can sometimes overtake us!\n\nThe caution is that overuse of our digital tools can make us seem like we are very much in love with ourselves, rather than one another. It is the other—our neighbor, a stranger, a struggling child, joyful friend, struggling teen, and laughing baby—to which God calls us. When we engage each other (the very task of our baptized lives), we find God is indeed with us in fullness and light, and made manifest in the love we have for one another and for the world.\n\nOur historically analog faith seems out of synch and a bit anachronistic in the face of a rapidly changing, increasingly digital world. While on the surface the Christian faith might seem old-fashioned like a long play vinyl record (Google it), it can complement and even complete our lives in some amazing ways. For us, that faith is rooted in the intimacy of friendship, love, service, care, and worship. Our faith, by nature, is rooted in the relationships that bear the fruit of Christ—an analog faith.\n\nCouncil Highlights-June 2015\n\nScott Fikse of Seattle, Washington, has accepted the position of director of music and liturgy. He and his husband, Marcus, will arrive on O‘ahu in mid-July.\n\nCouncil bids aloha and mahalo to Sophie Cheng, who has served as our youth representative to the council. She’ll be heading off to college in Alabama later this summer.\n\nCouncil approved contracting with DC Asphalt to seal and restripe the Poki Street parking lot. The cost is $6,00, and will be paid from the dedicated fund for parking lot maintenance.\n\nFundraising to finish paying for the Hörmann Courtyard cover is underway. Thanks to Mary Fastenau, Steve Miller, Carol Langner, Audrey Keller, and Olivia Castro for their efforts in planning and executing the “Donate a Sliver of Shade” idea!\n\nEleven parking spots in the lot behind the church have been rented to Punahou students for the summer session. Please be aware of the reserved parking signs when visiting the church on weekdays.\n\nLeadership Roundtable will begin again on August 2, after worship. This is a time for all committee or team leaders to gather and communicate.\n\nStewardship of Leisure Time\n\nLeisure time, I think, is one of the great essences of life. To relax and just do what you want. But how do you make sure you have leisure time? How do you relax or rest? What exactly is leisure time? I hope you will know all that by the end of this article. You will also see what I consider a great thing about leisure time.\n\nLeisure time is to relax or rest. After God created everything in six days, on the seventh day he rested. Some people would argue, “Why did they include the seventh day in the Bible?” I think they did because it is important. Nobody knows what God did on the seventh day. He might have slept or relaxed. That is why I will talk about both.\n\nIt is important to sleep. If you do not sleep, you will eventually die. It also refreshes you. It is also important to relax. When you relax, you calm down and you get rid of all the problems that run through your brain. You relieve stress, and too much stress can make you upset, and you don’t want that.\n\nOne way to relieve stress is to sit outside, in the sun, with a cold drink in your hand. You could also just lie on the couch and turn the ceiling fan on. You want to cool yourself down? Swimming is a good way to do that. Not laps but just floating in cool water. That is the most effective way to relieve stress. Beverages or outside temperatures will help with that.\n\nBut how do you manage having time to be lazy? Well, you should do all your work stuff before taking a break and sitting outside. Then you will feel the anxiety go away. You should do that because it is better to have no leisure time than getting fired from your job and going through rough times. Plan out beforehand what you will do in your free time so that you can do everything you want.\n\nI don’t think leisure time is just relaxing though. I think it also means to have fun and do things you wouldn’t normally do. That basically means, in 6th grade language, that during your free time you should go YOLO. YOLO is an acronym. It stands for “You Only Live Once.” To me it says that you should start living now and do fun things while you can. Who knows, maybe you can’t jump into a pool from 10 feet high in heaven. I think that you should think about YOLO. But don’t do things that are going to affect you or other people in a bad way.\n\nLeisure time is one of the greatest things in my life—the TV, the couch, the Coke. YOLO. These are all good things that should be recognized. I think that we should all go and appreciate our leisure time by doing something that we like. Remember, it can help your body and your brain. Be a good steward of your leisure time.\n\nCharles C.\n\nAdult Forum to Meet Before Summer Service\n\nJuly 5 and 12, from 8:20 to 9:00 am\n\nWe’ve never done it that way before, but Adult Forum will have occasional sessions this summer before Sunday services. On June 28, Wayne Gau began a brief series of forums on St. Patrick of Ireland, which continues through July 12. Feel free to bring your refreshments and join us to learn some Christian history.\n\nAngel Network In-Gathering July 5\n\nOn the first Sunday of each month, an in-gathering of food and personal items are collected at LCH for Angel Network, a ministry based out of Calvary-by-the-Sea Lutheran Church.

Our next meeting will be Monday, August 17, also at the Murashige’s, to discuss Birds Without Wings, by Louis de Bernieres.\n\nSummer is a Great Time to Join Altar Guild\n\nWe need more people to serve on altar guild. The altar guild people set out and clean up the communion equipment every Sunday. Duties are simple but necessary for the smooth running of services. We have three teams, so you would serve every third month, and the work can be done on Sundays within about 15 minutes. We divide responsibilities amongst the team assigned for Sunday duties. We especially need people to clean up after the 10:30 am service. Training is provided. This is a concrete and easy way to help the church. Sign up in the courtyard or talk to Linda Miller for more information.\n\nDonate Your Sliver of Shade in Hörmann Courtyard\n\nCollecting $20 donations—Goal of $10,000\n\nOur coolness countdown, summer fundraising for the Hörmann Courtyard continues. Immediately following Sunday service, we gather in the courtyard to deliver an updated donation report. We’re asking people to start covering the bulletin board with progress stickers. Each square on the wonderful Carol Langner bulletin board is worth $20. We’ll continue finding fun and clever ways to collect funds all summer long.\n\nIf you are making a check donation, please make it payable to LCH and note “Hörmann Courtyard” on the memo line. If you have $20 cash burning a hole in your pocket, please put it in one of the special Hormann Courtyard envelopes. All donations are tax-deductible. Thanks for being cool and helping LCH be cooler!\n\nThe impact of worship at LCH\n\nI’d like to share with you a note from former members of LCH on the occasion of the 40th Anniversary Celebration of the Beckerath Organ. I sent them the link to the TV piece that was broadcast here:\n\nAloha! Thank you so much for sharing. Very little time goes by that I don’t miss Hawaii and LCH. We’ve attended a couple churches here with pipe organs, but nothing ever brings the joy of the LCH organ and the experiences we had there. [Hearing this made me realize it does have a unique sound.] We repeatedly say that worshipping at LCH ruined us for going anywhere else. Seven years later we are still trying to find a place that fills our hearts and souls the same way. So far coming up short. The impact of worship, for the three short years we were there, has had such long-lasting effects on us—it would be great for everyone there to know that. Thanks for sending us a little bit of paradise. Hope all is well in your ‘ohana. With lots of aloha, Stephen and Selena Schmidt\n\nWhile it is with joy and thanksgiving that our worship and music ministry in this place has such great impact on families who find us, it is also a bit sad to think that these folks have not found another congregation that speaks to their worship needs as we did. I thank God for all the people we’ve touched over the years, as they come and go, and I pray that we continue to reach out and provide meaningful worship in all the days ahead.\n\nApril Smith\n\nSummer School Parking\n\nPunahou summer school started on Monday, June 15, at LCH.\n\nThis summer we rented 11 stalls in our lot behind the church to Punahou students. All spaces along the Poki Street side of the church lot, as well as three additional spaces—A and B near dumpster, and Z next to lot entrance—are reserved for students, Monday through Friday, from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, until July 24.\n\nPlease observe the posted “Reserved Parking” signs and review the diagram for guidance when parking in the church lot during regular business days.\n\n[symple clear floats]\n\nWelcome to Scott Fikse!\n\nNew Director of Music and Liturgy at LCH\n\nScott Fikse (R) with Marcus Thompson (L)\n\nLCH is pleased to announce that Scott Fikse begins work as our new director of music and liturgy, commencing July 15, 2015. Scott joins us from Welcome Table, an open and affirming congregation of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), formerly known as Findlay Street Christian Church in Seattle, Washington.\n\nScott is a graduate of Pacific Lutheran University and is active in all kinds of music making, including directing, performing, teaching, and composing in a variety of settings and genres. In Seattle, Scott actively performed and directed outside of his church position. In composition, Scott’s work earns much enthusiasm, and ranges from a staged reduction of Les Miserables for Celebrity Cruises to original compositions at the famed Oregon Bach Festival Composer’s Symposium.\n\nScott will relocate to Honolulu with his spouse, Marcus Thompson. LCH Choir rehearsals will resume on Thursday, August 6, and a schedule for the 8:00 O’Clock Ensemble will be arranged as Scott settles into his work.\n\nELCA reaches milestone in welcoming new congregations\n\nELCA News Service · CHICAGO · May 28, 2015\n\nFor the Rev. Ruben Duran, the message is quite clear—“Christ’s church is not dying.” That’s a different message, he says, than what has been widely reported in recent years about the decline in membership among U.S. mainline denominations, such as the 3.8 million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA).\n\nAs director of ELCA new starts, Duran believes that this church “is not dying. It is changing”—particularly as the ELCA reaches a significant milestone this spring.\n\nSince the ELCA began in 1988 as a result of a merger, more than 500 new congregations have been “planted, organized and joined the ELCA. That is a milestone worth celebrating,” said Duran. The “changing part,” he said, is that 56 percent of all ELCA new starts are among ethnic-multicultural communities, and 27 percent in communities where people are living in poverty or low-income. Another 26 new ministries started with leaders whose congregations left the ELCA in recent years, and there are 65 ELCA prison ministries.\n\nPut that all together, he said, and “we have 10 percent of the denomination in the growing stages. This is a good moment to celebrate. God is making all things new. The new start is the new skin of this church, and the new skin of the ELCA is a fusion of many nations being welcomed into the ELCA. It reflects the country that we’re becoming. We are not dying. We are changing.”\n\n“I use to believe that my neighbor was an object that I had to convince,” Duran said. “Now I realize that my neighbor is a child of God, who also has a message to share with me. I need then to shut up and listen to my neighbor, and together we can discover ways to be in relationship with one another under God’s grace. That’s a whole different story, and I’m thankful for it.”\n\nFor the Rev. Anna-Kari Johnson, assistant program director for ELCA new congregations, “It is inspiring to see so many congregations race across the finish line together to become the 499th and 500th congregation.” Ten of the newly organized ELCA congregations were welcomed at several of the ELCA’s 65 synods hosting synod assemblies this spring.\n\nIn addition to the newly organized congregations, Johnson said that there are 352 ministries under development. “And with all of us working together, we can start more. That’s a sign of a healthy church—each of our home congregations starting another congregation,” she said. “And all of our churches can be part of this.”\n\nWorship at a senior center\n\nWhen ELCA members have an idea for a new ministry, they contact their synod office and ask for the bishop or director for evangelical mission. Next they invite people to serve as “prayer partners” for the ministry, identify a mission developer and garner financial resources. As new ministries take root, it is not unusual for people to gather for worship in city parks, libraries and cafes, shelters, senior centers, homes and elsewhere.\n\nAccording to the Rev. Judith Spindt, director for evangelical mission, ELCA Southwestern Texas Synod, mission developers are often asked, “’Where is your church?’ Most of the time mission developers are only equipped with contacts and a list of cellphone numbers. That’s where the church begins. As the mission developer commits to relationships, people start engaging and seeing each other and the face of God is revealed.”\n\nSpindt is one of nearly 65 directors for evangelical mission in the ELCA. As part of the work of these directors, “We lay the groundwork to begin a new ministry and partner with people in their development life. We ask questions like, ‘Are you worshiping? What are you doing to include others? Are you ready to organize?’ It’s also about discipleship and self-sufficiency. A lot of prayers and dollars go into making mission possible,” she said. “It takes love, discipleship, commitment and a sense of growth to make things happen.”\n\nFor the past two years, Spindt partnered with two congregations in particular that declare to be the 499th and 500th ministries to join the ELCA—Spirit in the Hills Lutheran Church in Spicewood, Texas, and Spirit of Joy Lutheran Church in Seguin, Texas.\n\n“We’re 4 years old and started as a ‘new wine’ congregation,” said the Rev. Tim Bauerkemper, pastor developer of Spirit of Joy. A “new wine” ministry is a congregation that began from a congregation that had disaffiliated from the ELCA. Although there was a group that sought to leave the ELCA, there was a group that wanted to remain, said Bauerkemper.\n\n“We need to start new ministries because God is always writing a new story,” he said. With a radical sense of welcome and community, “we had a new opportunity to think of who we are as church. Even when something can fail, we can learn some important things. We have a lot to teach, particularly among congregations who have been around and want a breath of fresh air.”\n\nThe Campaign for the ELCA\n\nStarting new congregations is a priority of Always Being Made New: The Campaign for the ELCA—a five-year campaign approved by the 2013 ELCA Churchwide Assembly. It seeks to raise $198 million in support of new and expanded churchwide ministries above and beyond those supported by regular weekly offerings. The goal for the ELCA New Congregations priority is $4 million.\n\n“We are experiencing a time of a modern day ‘Book of Acts’ as the Spirit calls together people to experience the transformational love of God,” said the Rev. Ronald Glusenkamp, director of the ELCA campaign.\n\n“These new starts are signs of an amazing movement that is happening. I am grateful for the gifts of individuals and congregations with ‘glad and generous hearts’ who support this growth by giving to The Campaign for the ELCA,” he said.\n\nPacifica Synod Assembly 2015\n\nReport to the Congregation\n\nThe 2015 assembly of the Pacifica Synod met from May 28 to 30, at the Convention Center in Riverside California, with Pastor Jeff Lilley, Karyn Castro, and Frank Haas representing the Lutheran Church of Honolulu as voting members. The theme for the assembly was: “Resurrecting, Re-forming and Renewing. Making All Things New.”\n\nA primary purpose of the assembly is to conduct the business of the synod, consistent with the governance requirements of its constitution and bylaws. The assembly:\n\nApproved the synod’s financial report and 2016–17 budget and spending plan, without issue.\n\nElected representatives to the Synod Council.\n\nElected representatives to the Churchwide Assembly—Ms. Karen Lathrop, Lutheran Church of the Holy Trinity in Kona, will represent the Hukilau Conference.\n\nIn addition, since Bishop Finck will be leaving his position next year, he entertained questions from the assembly regarding the role of the bishop. There were few, if any, substantive questions. However, next year’s assembly will be especially important, as a new bishop will be chosen after Bishop Finck’s sixteen year tenure.\n\nThe bishop recognized outstanding contributions by lay members from each of the ten geographic conferences. For the Hukilau Conference, the bishop recognized Ray Herradura for his volunteer work in providing healing services for the Wounded Warrior program. Ray was honored with a recognition certificate, which was accepted on his behalf by Pastor Lilley.\n\nThe Synod Assembly passed a series of resolutions that had been submitted for consideration. In addition to those related to governance (agenda approval, budgets, etc.) resolutions fell into two categories: those recognizing or commemorating people or events and those urging action on the part of synod congregation. The commemorative resolutions recognized:\n\nRetired General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Eric Shinseki (Līhu‘e Lutheran Church) for principled leadership.\n\nThe 25th anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nResolutions urging congregational action were:\n\nA recommendation for a 1.5% increase in the base salary for rostered leaders (including pastors).\n\nA recommendation for congregations to budget financial support for California Lutheran University and Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary.\n\nA resolution urging congregations to provide meaningful support for military personnel, veterans, their families and friends.\n\nApart from the necessary business of the synod, the assembly heard a report on the ELCA (including a video from Presiding Bishop Elizabeth Eaton); a keynote address in two parts, by Dr. Craig Van Gelder, on the evolution of church mission; a report on the state of the synod, by Bishop Finck; and a keynote address by Rev. Ruben Duran, from the ELCA office.\n\nElectronic Funds Transfers for May Offering Fund Amount Offering Fund Amount Offering $7,254 Mission Campaign $50 Music Fund/Instruments $160 Wounded Warriors $25\n\nAttendance and Offerings for June Date Worship Service Attendance Offering Fund Amount June 7 9:15 am Service 91 Offering $4,568 Wounded Warriors $625 Hörmann Courtyard $410 Music/Instruments $5 June 14 9:15 am Service 92 Offering $2,493 Wounded Warriors $1,232 Hörmann Courtyard $895 Social Ministries $10 Altar Flowers $40 June 21 9:15 am Service 81 Offering $1,420 Hörmann Courtyard $447 Wounded Warriors $220 June 28 9:15 am Service 102 Offering $3,121 Sunday School $2 Social Ministries $60 Wounded Warriors $250 Hörmann Courtyard $322\n\nHeartBeat Deadline\n\nTuesday, June 21, 9:00 am\n\nCheri, Dan, Denise, Diane, Gene, Gianna, Irmgard,\n\nJennie, Karen, Kent, Quentin, and Sandi\n\nJuly Birthdays 07/02 David Del Rocco 07/07 Ann C.
