        "text": "AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF filed by Brethren in Christ Church, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, Evangelical Free Church of America, Evangelical Presbyterian Church, International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, International Pentecostal Holiness Church, Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, MA Catholic Conference, Missionary Church, National Association of Evangelicals, Open Bible Churches [USA], US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, United Brethren in Christ Church and Wesleyan Church in 10-2204, 10-2207, 10-2214 in support of Appellants. Certificate of service dated 01/28/2011. Nine paper copies identical to that of the electronically filed brief must be submitted so that they are received by the court on or before 02/22/2011. [10-2204, 10-2207, 10-2214] (GK)\n\nORDER entered. On or before March 18, 2011, the parties are to confer and file a joint proposal as to how these cases should proceed in light of the government's letter of February 24, 2011. The proposal shall address, among other things, whether the government needs to clarify its litigation stance by filing a new brief. The government shall also inform us, at that time, when we should expect to learn that Congress will or will not seek to intervene or otherwise participate, as well as whether in its view this matter should be held in abeyance pending that Congressional decision. The government shall also address whether, in its view, the government appeals should be dismissed in light of the government's position. Appellant Dean Hara shall also address whether the government's letter affects whether his own appeal should proceed. The present briefing schedule is vacated pending consideration of the further filings. [10-2204, 10-2207, 10-2214] (GK)\n\nORDER entered by Sandra L. Lynch, Chief Appellate Judge These cases will be held in abeyance until further order of this court. The government has represented to the court that the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives has informed the Executive Branch of its intention to participate in these consolidated cases to defend the constitutionality of section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. To date, that Group has not filed an appearance or otherwise sought to participate in these cases. Until such action is taken, if it be taken, the present view of the court is that it would be premature to set schedules for any filings by that group. Rather, we direct the Executive Branch, by the government, to file a status report by June 1, 2011. That status report should address: (1) whether and, if so, when the Attorney General submitted a report to both houses of Congress, under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 530D(a)(2); (2) what action, if any, has been taken by the required recipients in response to any such report; and (3) any information as to the timing of proposed submissions to the court on behalf of the Congress or either house thereof. The Clerk is directed to send copies of this order to the Speaker, Minority Leader, and General Counsel of the United States House of Representatives. [10-2204, 10-2207, 10-2214] (LB)\n\nORDER entered by Sandra L. Lynch, Chief Appellate Judge. The motion of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives (\"the House\") to intervene as a party appellant is granted. The federal defendants' motion to withdraw their opening brief is denied; however, the federal defendants may file a superseding brief. Briefing shall proceed on the following schedule: 30 days after order allowing intervention: Opening brief of intervenor (the House) in Nos. 10-2204 and 10-2207 Superseding brief of appellants (the federal defendants) in Nos. 10-2204 and 10-2207 30 days from above filings: Response brief of appellee (Commonwealth of Massachusetts) in No. 10-2204 Response brief of appellees (the Gill plaintiffs) in No. 10-2207 combined with opening brief of cross-appellant (Dean Hara) in No. 10-2214 30 days from above filings: Reply brief of intervenor (the House) in Nos. 10-2204 and 10-2207 Reply brief of appellants (the federal defendants) in Nos. 10-2204 and 10-2207, combined with response brief of cross-appellees (the federal defendants) in No. 10-2214 14 days from above filings: Reply brief of cross-appellant (Dean Hara) in No. 10-2214 So ordered. [10-2204, 10-2207, 10-2214] (GK)\n\nORDER entered by Sandra L. Lynch, Chief Appellate Judge; Juan R. Torruella*, Appellate Judge; Michael Boudin, Appellate Judge; Kermit V. Lipez*, Appellate Judge; Jeffrey R. Howard, Appellate Judge and Rogeriee Thompson*, Appellate Judge. The plaintiffs-appellees in Gill v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., Nos. 10-2207, 10-2214, seek initial hearing en banc in these three consolidated appeals from the district court's decision striking down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. The petition for initial hearing en banc, having been considered by the judges of the court in regular active service and a majority of said judges not having voted to order that the matter be heard en banc, is denied. In order to give the parties an appropriate interval in which to present their arguments, the briefing order entered by this court on June 16, 2011, as amended by the court's July 11 and 28 orders extending the due dates for opening and superseding briefs, is hereby further amended. The trigger date for the computation of time to file briefs contained in this court's June 16 order shall be the date this order issues. The motion of amicus Eagle Forum Education & Legal Defense Fund for leave to submit a response to the petition for initial hearing en banc is denied. So ordered. * TORRUELLA, LIPEZ, and THOMPSON, Circuit Judges, dissenting without comment as to the denial of the petition for initial hearing en banc.
