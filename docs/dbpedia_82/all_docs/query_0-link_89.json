Photographs which would have accompanied press releases and photographs submitted as a result of Daily Call sponsored promotions are included in the collection. Finally, the collection contains a “mug shot” file kept by the photographic department for a number of years.\n\nThe collection is housed in three Gaylord 12 x 15 x 10” boxes, which contain 140 file folders. There are in excess of 3260 photographs in the collection. No restrictions have been placed on the use of this material for research purposes.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nThe Piqua Daily Call Photograph Collection 1995-2003 is divided into the six series and sub-series.
