President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama joined cabinet secretaries, governors, mayors, nonprofit and business leaders, students, families, and others in honoring Dr. King's legacy through service projects addressing a multitude of pressing social issues from poverty and illiteracy to hunger to homelessness.\n\nAmericans made it a “a day on, not a day off” by weatherizing homes, delivering meals, refurbishing schools, collecting food and clothing, reading to children, providing employment counseling, and more. Many will use the day as the beginning of ongoing commitment to serve throughout the year. The MLK Day of Service is led by the Corporation for National and Community Service and the King Center in partnership with nonprofit, education, business, and other organizations around the country.\n\nTo mark the 25th anniversary of the King Holiday, and to encourage ongoing service throughout the year, the Corporation for National and Community Service launched the MLK 25 Challenge – a call to all Americans to honor Dr. King by pledging to take at least 25 actions during 2011 to make a difference for others and strengthen our communities. There is no shortage of work to be done, or lack of ways to get involved. Become a mentor, engage in a Semester of Service, join a national service program, or find a volunteer opportunity in your community.\n\nLearn More\n\nNEWS: Visit National Service in the News for links to more than 350 news stories about the 2011 MLK Day of Service\n\nNEW MEDIA: Read about MLK Day of Service on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nVIDEOS: Watch the King Legacy of Service 25th Anniversary video and other videos on the Corporation’s YouTube channel\n\nPHOTOS: Click here for photos from Washington DC events, and here for photos from the field.\n\nWEBSITE: Visit the www.MLKDay.gov website for tools and information.\n\nBLOG: The United We Serve blog has stories from this year’s MLK Day of Service and more.\n\nHighlights\n\nThousands of projects in all 50 states that engaged hundreds of thousands of Americans in service to meet local needs\n\nStrong Administration participation including President Obama, Cabinet Secretaries, and senior Administration officials\n\nGrowing involvement by bipartisan elected officials including 13 Members of Congress, 13 Governors, and 42 Mayors\n\nSignificant corporate support from major US companies that supported projects with funding and volunteers\n\nMore than 20 civil rights leaders, public officials, entertainers, and athletes served as MLK Day of Service Ambassadors\n\nMore than 340,000 views of King Legacy of Service 25th Anniversary video and other MLK videos\n\nFull integration of social media including Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.\n\nRecognized more than 600 “Drum Majors for Service” with Presidential Volunteer Service Awards\n\nExtensive media coverage including PSAs, radio media tour, and coverage reaching more than 100 million Americans\n\nLaunched the MLK 25 Challenge to mark the 25th anniversary of the MLK Holiday and encourage year-round service\n\nProject Highlights\n\nBelow are some highlights of 2011 King Day.

On behalf of Gabby and our family, I ask that you consider honoring their commitment to service by dedicating a few hours on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.\" Captain Mark Kelly, Navy pilot, NASA astronaut and husband of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords.\n\n\"Dr. King obviously had a dream of justice and equality in our society, but he also had a dream of service, that you could be a drum major for service, that you could lead by giving back to our communities. And that's what this program is all about and that's what these participants are all about. Michelle and I the girls are extraordinarily proud that each year on Martin Luther King’s birthday this is how we celebrate, is making sure that we're giving a little something back to the community.\" –President Barack Obama\n\n\"Martin Luther King Jr.'s words of advice, \"everybody can be great because everybody can serve,\" are never truer than on his annual Day of Service. As a result, hundreds of Michigan citizens will volunteer their time, talent and resources today. Their efforts will impact countless individuals and give hope to those in need — all thanks to King's teachings and legacy.\" Jim Vella, President of the Ford Motor Co. Fund\n\n\"Assisting at food banks or organizing drives, neighborhood cleanups, donating blood are examples of ways to honor King's legacy, and a form of celebration just about anyone should be able to embrace -- and something we should incorporate into our daily lives rather than saving it for only one of the 365 days in a year.\" Daily Times (DE) Editorial\n\n\"A commitment to service is something that we want to encourage everybody to do, I think that’s how we can make a difference. And Dr. King truly was the leader in showing us a life committed in service to others.\" Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad\n\n\"We were down, but they're pulling us up. We never lost faith, and they're giving us a new start.\" Richard Camille, an senior in New Iberia, LA, whose home was repaired by AmeriCorps members and volunteers on MLK Day."
