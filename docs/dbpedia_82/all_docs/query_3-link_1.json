What was it and how did it change you or your view of God and/or the world?\n\nWas Blind But Now I See\n\nAt 14 years old, Lisa Reid and her family had a hard decision to make. Lisa had a cancerous brain tumor that was causing her headaches, vomiting and loss of coordination. Her only choice was a delicate operation to remove the tumor and save her life. However, as a consequence of the surgery Lisa’s optic nerves were damaged and she became blind.\n\nDeciding not to let her blindness hold her down, Lisa became a poster child for children with cancer. She appeared on television shows and in documentaries across New Zealand. She also made promotional appearances to help raise money for the organization that trained her seeing-eye dog, Amy.\n\nTen years after her sight was taken away by cancer, Lisa tripped and fell hitting her head on a coffee table and on the floor. She got up, as she had done before, and went to bed. The next morning when she opened her eyes she could see the white of her ceiling. Looking around she saw light shining through the curtains and then she looked and saw her beloved dog Amy. Lisa’s sight had come back, not perfectly, but it was back.\n\nThe doctors were skeptical. There was no medical explanation for how Lisa regained her sight. Her optic nerves, which have no power to regenerate themselves, were still damaged. The doctors tried to explain her sight by saying that Lisa may have recovered from a blindness that had been more psychological rather than physical from the start. “I don’t believe in miracles,” said Dr. Ross McKay. That doesn’t matter to Lisa, all she knows is that once she was blind but now she sees.\n\nIn this week’s gospel text we meet a man blind from birth who is given back his sight by Jesus. The religious leaders are skeptical and try to find excuses for the healing. However, the man knows that it was Jesus who healed him and he knows, like Lisa, that once he was blind but now he sees. His only response is to worship Jesus.\n\nMore on Lisa Reid’s story\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhat do you think of Lisa’s story? Was it a miracle? Why or why not?\n\nDo you think people are open to miracles or are they skeptical like Dr. Ross?\n\nSome would say that miracles are in the “eye of the beholder”. What do you think that means? Do you agree with that statement?\n\nScripture Texts (NRSV) for Sunday, March 30, 2014 (Fourth Sunday in Lent)\n\n1 Samuel 16:1-13\n\nEphesians 5:8-14\n\nJohn 9:1-41\n\n(Text links are to Oremus Bible Browser. Oremus Bible Browser is not affiliated with or supported by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. You can find the calendar of readings for Year C at Lectionary Readings.)\n\nFor lectionary humor and insight, check the weekly comic Agnus Day.\n\nGospel Reflection\n\nThe Gospel writer John is a great storyteller. In this story of the encounter of Jesus and the man blind from birth, John’s major point is that Jesus is the “Light of the World” and the Messiah (here noted as the “Son of Man”). In order to make his point, John uses a storytelling trick whereby the blind man gains his physical sight and then as the story progresses his eyes of faith become more and more clear until he sees Jesus as the Messiah and worships Jesus. At the same time, the spiritual eyes of the religious leaders are beginning to dim and finally Jesus hints that the Pharisees are blind to God’s work in the world.\n\nAlong the way in this story there are several things that are unique to John and John’s gospel which speak to us today. Among them are the following:\n\nNotice that Jesus was walking along, saw the blind man and went over to heal him. In the other Gospels people need to have at least a little faith for the miracle to happen. In John the miracles happen first and then people are moved to faith. At first all the blind man knew was that “some guy by the name of Jesus put mud on my eyes and now I see.” The good news here is that God comes to people even if they do not, at first, have any faith. God’s love touches all people not just those who are with the “in” crowd.\n\nNext, the blind man’s faith grows as a result of being questioned by the religious leaders (he “sees” even more clearly). In this story the man goes from calling Jesus just “some guy” to calling him a prophet and then finally seeing Jesus as the Messiah and worshiping Jesus. There are some Christians in our day who see questions as a bad thing. However, I would note that Jesus never scolded anyone for asking a question…even when the question seemed to signify that the person did not understand what Jesus was saying.\n\nAs Lutherans we welcome questions and discussions and even debates as a way of searching for the truth and growing our faith. Also note that the man’s faith grew slowly as he came to understand who Jesus really was and what that meant for his life and for the world. We have to respect the fact that we and others can be at different places along the line of gaining faith and an understanding of Jesus. Some might say Jesus is person, others that he is a good teacher, some that he is a prophet and then others who say “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” It’s okay to have your faith in Jesus grow slowly.\n\nFinally in John’s gospel miracles are called “signs”. In John’s gospel the miracles are never an end to themselves but point to something beyond the miracle itself. Here the healing of the blind man is a sign that points to Jesus as the Light of the World. Today Jesus is still the Light of the World shining into the dark places of our lives, the lives of those we love and into the life of the world. By faith we can clearly catch a glimpse of God’s reign and of Jesus’ presence in the world today.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWe often see the Lenten season as a journey of faith. Given the story of the man born blind where do you see yourself on this journey? Who is Jesus to you?\n\nDo you think questions about faith and religion are a good thing or not? Why?\n\nI did not mention it in the Gospel Reflection but as noted in verse 16 Jesus must have done this miracle or sign on the Sabbath and the Pharisees were not happy about it. What is your opinion? Was it okay for Jesus to heal on the Sabbath even though there were rules about working on the Sabbath day (healing would be considered work)? Why or why not?\n\nSince Jesus is the Light of the World, what are some ways we can reflect that light of Jesus into the lives of our friends and neighbors?\n\nActivity Suggestions\n\nIf you have midweek Lenten services and maybe soup suppers before worship, take a moment to interview an older adult. Ask them about their faith journey, how did they come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah and the Light of the World. Then, next time your youth group or bible study meets, compare notes. What are the similarities? Are all of the faith journeys alike? What do the different stories tell you about how we come to faith in God and Jesus?\n\nClosing Prayer\n\nAmazing God, open the eyes of our faith so that we may come to see clearly that Jesus is the Christ and the Light of the World. May the light of Christ shine brightly into our darkness and the darkness of the world. Strengthen and empower our faith so that we might serve you and our neighbors in need by reflecting the light of your Chosen One, Jesus the Christ. Amen.\n\nContributed by John Wertz, Blacksburg, VA\n\nWarm-up Question\n\nThink about the last time you were really sick. Who helped you to deal with your illness? How did you express your gratitude to that person?\n\nThe Cost of Healing\n\nEveryone will get sick at some point in their lives, however, since a visit to the doctor or the emergency room, can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, it has not always been possible for those who are sick to see a doctor, especially if they lack insurance. According to the Health Insurance Coverage Estimates produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “In the first 3 months of 2013, 46.0 million persons of all ages (14.8%) were uninsured at the time of interview, 57.4 million (18.5%) had been uninsured for at least part of the year prior to interview, and 34.5 million (11.1%) had been uninsured for more than a year at the time of interview.” When the statistics are examined more closely, it becomes clear that the uninsured rate is even higher for those on the lower end of the socio-economic scale. For people who are considered poor (those earning up to $23,550 in income for a family of 4) or near poor (those earning up to $47,100 in income for a family of four), the uninsured rate rises to nearly 30%. (accessed Sept. 30, 2013 – http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201309.pdf and http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/13poverty.cfm#guidelines). For those struggling to make a living, therefore, adequate health care can be out of their financial reach and a major medical event can mean financial disaster.\n\nIn an attempt to provide access to health care to all Americans, the Federal government passed the Affordable Health Care Act in 2010. After three years of lawsuits and political wrangling, the Act went into effect at the beginning of this month. While it will be years, before the success or failure of this law can be accurately measured, in the short-term millions of our most vulnerable neighbors will now have access to medical insurance and the care that they need when they are ill.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nDo you think that access to health care is a right or a privilege?\n\nDo you think a certain level of care should be available to everyone regardless of their financial resources?\n\nFor many people, money is at the heart of the discussion over health care. How much do you think it should cost to go to the doctor? How does that compare to what you are willing to pay for other goods and services?\n\nScripture Texts (NRSV) for Sunday, October 13, 2013 (Twenty-first Sunday after Pentecost)\n\n2 Kings 5:1-3, 7-15c\n\n2 Timothy 2:8-15\n\nLuke 17:11-19\n\n(Text links are to Oremus Bible Browser.

You can find the calendar of readings for Year C at Lectionary Readings.)\n\nFor lectionary humor and insight, check the weekly comic Agnus Day.\n\nGospel Reflection\n\n“Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” (Lk 17:13) If there was ever a group of people who could use God’s mercy and the healing presence of Jesus, it was definitely the lepers. These men and women, who were battling the affects of a long-term, debilitating disease, were outcasts from society and essentially unemployable. Regardless of their social standing or skill set before they became ill, lepers were forced to survive on the charity of others and to live in a colony with those coping the disease.\n\nTheir cry, Luke says, came from a distance. Lepers always kept their distance from the rest of society, because to get too close was to risk subjecting someone else to the pain and suffering that dominated their lives. “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” was their plea, but what form did they expect Jesus’ mercy to take? Were they seeking a financial donation from him like the donations they had sought from travelers before him? Were they looking for a gift of food like the 5,000 had received? Were they hoping for healing like the crippled woman who could now walk again? Obviously, we cannot know everything that was racing through the minds of those ten lepers as they called out to Jesus, but Jesus’ response to their cry is immediate and clear, “Go and show yourselves to the priest.”(Lk 17:14) He doesn’t ask them to jump through any hoops. He doesn’t call them over so he can perform a ritual. Jesus hears their cry for help and acts to restore health and wholeness to their lives.\n\nThe healing, it is worth noting, didn’t happen immediately. It was only after the lepers obeyed Jesus’ command and began walking toward the priests who could certify their healing and release them from their unclean status that they noticed a change in their health. As they walked, as they obeyed Jesus command, they experienced God’s healing power and were made well.\n\nIt’s hard to blame the nine who didn’t come back to thank Jesus and to praise God. After all, Jesus told them to go to the priest and once they were declared clean, they could go home. Almost anyone in their shoes would have raced to share the good news with their family and friends, but one leper returned. One former leper gave glory to God in a loud voice and prostrated himself at Jesus’ feet. One newly healed Samaritan understood that Jesus offered more than simply a path back into the world. One man of faith believed in Jesus and discovered not simply physical healing, but the key to a whole, healthy life of faith. Jesus command, “Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well” (Lk 17:19) is not the end of the story, but a new beginning for this once ailing man who now returns to the world free from the horrors of leprosy and connected to the new life that comes from faith in Jesus.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nIf you were one of the ten lepers who were made clean, do you think you would have returned to thank Jesus?\n\nEven though leprosy is not a major disease in the world today, there are still millions of people who are isolated and left out of society. What are some of the ideas, situations and circumstances that make someone a ‘leper’ in today’s world? What do you think it is like to live on the edges of society?\n\nHow can we follow Jesus’ example and show mercy to those who are in need of healing and hope?\n\nActivity Suggestions\n\nWork with your church to assembly Personal Care Kits or Baby Care Kits which can be distributed by Lutheran World Relief to people around the world in need of healing and help. More information on LWF kits can be found at: http://lwr.org/getinvolved/kits\n\n“Thank You Day” – pick a day to go out of your way to say, “Thank You!” Pay special attention to all the ways that people assist and help you throughout the day. Acknowledge their help with words of thanks and consider writing a personal note to those who make the biggest impact in your life.\n\nClosing Prayer\n\nGracious God, you reach out to us with your compassion and caring. Bless all those who use their gifts to bring healing and health to others. In our times of need, help us to experience your merciful presence and make us always thankful for the gifts you have given us. In your name we pray. Amen.\n\nContributed by Seth Moland-Kovash, Palatine, IL\n\nWarm-up Question\n\nAre you a patient person? Do you find it easy or hard to wait?\n\nStandardized Test\n\nThe Veterans Administration is the branch of our government responsible for providing benefits (medical, educational, housing, etc) for veterans of the armed forces. One of the most significant jobs is disability benefits. If a person is injured during their military service, they are entitled to financial compensation. There is currently a very significant backlog of veterans who are waiting to find out if they will get benefits and to receive those benefits. Over 200,000 veterans have been waiting at least one year for a decision.\n\nGeneral Eric Shinseki, who is the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the head of the Veterans Administration, recently announced new plans and strategies to clear the backlog. He has also introduced plans that he hopes will allow all future claims to be cleared within 125 days, much less than the wait currently experienced. This story (http://tinyurl.com/akgsbga) explains some of the reasons for the long backlog and what Shinseki and the VA plan to do about it.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nHave you ever had to wait as long as a year for something? What did it feel like?\n\nWhat do you think the rest of us can do to help veterans who are waiting for these benefits and decisions?\n\nScripture Texts (NRSV) for Sunday, May 5, 2013 (Sixth Sunday of Easter)\n\nActs 16:9-15\n\nRevelation 21:10, 22–22:5\n\nJohn 5:1-9\n\n(Text links are to Oremus Bible Browser.

Of course, things worked a bit differently in his time. There wasn’t a Veterans Administration to write a check, but there was a pool where people waited and found healing when they were dipped into the waters. The problem for this man was that the healing only happened when the water was stirred up, and whenever that happened, other people who could actually walk ran into the water ahead of him and blocked his path. His infirmity kept him from getting the help he needed. And so he had been ill for 38 years.\n\nHe specifically says that “I have no one to put me into the pool.” If he had had friends or family or someone with compassion nearby who could lower him into the pool, his own inability to walk would not have mattered. But he was alone. His suffering was intensified by his isolation. So Jesus told him to stand up and walk. And he did.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWho in our world or in your community is isolated? How does that keep them from getting the healing they need?\n\nWhat do you think the rest of us can do to help people who feel they cannot access healing because of their isolation?\n\nActivity Suggestions\n\nVisit shut-ins from your congregation in coordination with your pastor. Bring them flowers or just show up and smile. They will love the visit.\n\nClosing Prayer\n\nGood and gracious God, we thank you for the healing you bring and the ways you help us to bridge gaps and to reach out to one another. Amen.\n\nContributed by Sylvia Alloway, Granada Hills, CA\n\nWarm-up Question\n\nHave you ever been wrong about someone? Have you ever rejected a person as odd, stupid, or untrustworthy and later discovered that you were mistaken? What was the situation? What happened?\n\nTreasure in Plain Sight\n\nThe white bowl with the pointy, leaf-like pattern shaped into it had sat on the mantle in a New York state home for several years. The family had paid three dollars for it at a tag sale. A belated curiosity about the trinket’s origin led the family to an assessor and a big surprise. Their humble little bowl was 1,000-year-old Chinese treasure, an example of “Ding” pottery from the Northern Song dynasty.\n\nGiven to the famous auction house Sotheby’s to sell, it was expected to fetch around $200,000. A bidding war among four art collectors resulted in a price ten times that much, $2.2 million.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nThere is an old saying: He knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. What does this mean? What is the difference between price and value?\n\nIs there anything in your life that you value, even though it is not worth much money? What? Why?\n\nThink about what people without Christ value, compared to what Christians value. Is there a difference? What is it?\n\nScripture Texts (NRSV) for Sunday, March 31, 2013 (Resurrection of Our Lord Easter Day)\n\nActs 10:34-43\n\n1 Corinthians 15:19-26\n\nLuke 24:1-12\n\n(Text links are to Oremus Bible Browser.

You can find the calendar of readings for Year C at Lectionary Readings.)\n\nFor lectionary humor and insight, check the weekly comic Agnus Day.\n\nGospel Reflection\n\nThere are two Bible stories that are so familiar to Christians that we hardly pay attention to the words when we hear them. One is the story of Jesus birth, the other is the story of his resurrection. These two miracles are the heart of Christianity, special occasions in the church. We give thanks, sing some songs, and go about our business.\n\nBut think about these words: “There were in the same country shepherds, abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.”\n\nUm, yeah. So?\n\nShepherds were considered unclean by upper class Jews. They were not invited into homes. They were not allowed to testify in court. They were outcasts. Yet, these despised people were the first to hear about Jesus’ birth. God valued them and their strong, simple faith. He entrusted them with the news of his Son’s arrival. Sure enough, they ran to tell anyone they could find that the Messiah was born.\n\nIn today’s lesson we read the familiar story of the women finding the empty tomb. Women, too, were outcasts, thought inferior to men. Women, too, could not testify in court, because they would not be believed. (Notice how the disciples react when they hear the women’s testimony.) Yet God again chooses outcasts as the first to behold the culmination of his great plan of salvation, the greatest event in the history of the world. Again he gives them a message to tell. He shows how much he values those whom the world rejects.\n\nGod does not choose people who think they are worth more than others to spread the news of his salvation. He values the humble, the willing, the faithful, as if they were million-dollar treasures. He paid for them, for us, a price immeasurably greater than money. He paid with his lifeblood.\n\nLet us run and tell!\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nIn today’s world humility is not considered a very valuable trait. Why is this so?\n\nWhat is the value of humility? What can humble people accomplish that those who think they are great can’t?\n\nChristians are often considered outcasts in the non-Christian world. How can we follow the example of the shepherds and the women in telling others the Good News?\n\nActivity Suggestions\n\nThink of a way the class can tell the Good News of Christ’s resurrection. Do it.\n\nTalk about what makes a person an outcast among young people. How we can value outcasts and not reject them as the world does?\n\nSing any resurrection song\n\nClosing Prayer\n\nGod of the humble, Savior of the outcast, we ask for true humility. Convict us when we put someone down or leave someone out. May the joy of your salvation fill us so that others can see and know that there is hope in you. In Our Savior’s Holy Name, Amen.\n\nContributed by Sylvia Alloway, Granada Hills, CA\n\nWarm-up Question\n\nSuppose you got off the plane after a long vacation and saw a headline announcing your death. Someone had started this rumor and gotten others to believe it. How would you go about proving that you are still alive?\n\nRumors of Death…and Life!\n\n“I don’t even remember what a headache feels like!” So declared Fidel Castro in an article published on Cubadebate, the state news website. The purpose of the article, titled “Fidel Castro Is Dying,” was to assure the Cuban people that the old revolutionary was still alive and healthy at 86. Rumors that the former dictator had suffered a severe stroke and was barely hanging on had been swirling around in the world press for days.\n\nPhotos of Castro strolling around his farm using a metal cane, taken by a visiting Venezuelan dignitary, appeared with the article. The South American politician said he talked with the notorious Communist strongman for five hours and was then escorted to his hotel by Castro in a chauffeur-driven minibus.\n\nCastro’s article also tore into the “imperialist propaganda” spread by the non-Communist media. The rumor was traced to a Venezuelan doctor in Miami, who claimed to have heard that the Cuban leader was near death.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nWhy do you think rumors of Castro’s death spark such interest!\n\nHow do rumors get started? Why do people believe them?\n\nHow do you personally decide what to believe and what not to believe when you hear a rumor?\n\nThink about one time when you believed a rumor that wasn’t true and another time when you did not believe something and it turned out to be true. What happened? What if anything, did you learn?\n\nScripture Texts (NRSV) for Sunday, November 4, 2012 (All Saints Sunday)\n\nIsaiah 25:6-9\n\nRevelation 21:1-6\n\nJohn 11:32-44\n\n(Text links are to Oremus Bible Browser.

Everyone knows that there’s no getting around death. It takes a lot of proof to convince any sane person that someone could conquer this greatest enemy of humankind.\n\nThere are always rumors, of course. Jesus raised several people from the dead, and word must have gotten around. But people were just as skeptical in those days as they are now. The person wasn’t really dead, they would say. Jesus is a fake, and intelligent people don’t put any stock in such foolishness.\n\nBut Lazarus was different. A whole crowd of people had been weeping over him for four days. Some of them probably helped to wrap the body in the grave clothes. His sister Martha was certain there would be a terrible stench if the grave was opened. Death was as ugly then as it is now. Even Jesus wept at the sight of it.\n\nWait, what it this? Open the grave? Call on God to hear? And what is this “Lazarus, come out”? What does this man think he’s doing?\n\nRaising Lazarus from the dead.\n\nOh.\n\nThere was nothing especially glorious about it. A man trying to walk while stuck in a shroud was just as scary then as it is now. And cutting him free couldn’t have been very pleasant. Yet all those repellent practicalities drove home the point. This man really was raised from the dead. Those who doubted had only to look.\n\nWord got around and is with us today: Jesus has power over death – Lazarus’ death, his own, and finally, ours as well. Some stand and say, “Prove it!” Some sit and say, “Forget it.” Some turn away and say, “It’s just a rumor.” And some fall to their knees before Jesus Christ and say, “My Lord and my God!”\n\nJesus has the words of eternal life, the power to conquer our most fearsome enemy, and we know we can trust in him. That is why we are called “believers.”\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\n[Note: Talking about death is not easy. It may help students to be more comfortable, if the teacher “breaks the ice” and gives a personal answer to the first question. Be sensitive to students’ feelings.]\n\nHave you had any experience with death? Did your Christian hope of eternal life help you in this situation? Why or why not?\n\nEveryone has fears and uncertainties, especially concerning death. How can we help each other to overcome those fears?\n\nLook carefully at John 11:25-26 (“I am the resurrection…”). What did Jesus mean by this? What meaning does it have for us today?\n\nActivity Suggestions\n\nTurn the raising of Lazarus into a play. Ask to perform it for a class of younger students.\n\nIn groups or as a class, use a concordance or online Bible to look up verses on resurrection. Who talked about it? Why is it important? How does it fit into our faith? (Consider the Apostles’ and the Nicene creeds)\n\nSuggested songs: He Lives, The Solid Rock\n\nClosing Prayer\n\nAlmighty God and Conqueror of death itself, we thank and praise you for the death that gives us life – Christ’s crucifixion – and the resurrection that was his and will someday be ours. Fill us with your holy joy at this good news and help us to share it with those who are fearful and doubting. In the all-powerful name of your Son, Jesus Christ Our Lord, Amen"
