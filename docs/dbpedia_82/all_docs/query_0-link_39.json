        "text": "As a second generation Greek American, I have a firsthand understanding of the importance and power of the American dream, as well as, the sensitivity and passion surrounding the issue of immigration reform. This matter becomes even more delicate when it involves children, who must always be dealt with in a thoughtful, compassionate and fair manner.\n\nOn Friday, April, 18, the Obama Administration elected to \"indefinitely delay\" a decision to approve or deny a permit to build the Keystone pipeline until at least after the 2014 elections, further withholding the prospect of more than 40,000 jobs and $2.1 billion in earnings.\n\nAs a member of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, I participate in hearings and briefings on a regular basis about all aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare. It seems that each week, Obamacare brings more bad news, from cancelled plans and rising health care costs to limiting options for doctors and medications.\n\nAs Vice-Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, I am dismayed at the recent allegations of bureaucratic misconduct, which may have attributed to the deaths of veterans who were stuck waiting for care within the VA.\n\n\"We remember September 11, 2001, not only for the tragic events that occurred and the loved ones lost, but also for the strength and unity demonstrated by Americans that day ? a unique solidarity still found throughout our nation.\n\nDisasters can strike at any time, often with little warning. As a representative from coastal Florida, Congressman Bilirakis regularly meets with local emergency managers to ensure our communities are ready to respond to a hurricane or other weather-related disasters. However, we must all do our part to ensure we are prepared before a disaster strikes.\n\nCongressman Bilirakis will be holding his Seventh Annual Veterans' Resource Fair on Saturday, June 29, at River Ridge High School. The event will feature a musical performance by Tony Orlando and a Presentation of Colors by AVAST, the nation's only all-amputee color guard. We hope you can attend this event that honors those who protect and serve our country!\n\n?Two months before the Boston attack, Florida Rep. Gus Bilirakis filed legislation that called for strengthening the country?s student visa background checks and better monitoring student status once they are on U.S. soil. He had filed similar legislation in the past four congressional sessions.?\n\nCongressman Bilirakis is working to boost the economy by connecting jobseekers with businesses that are hiring. We hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to connect with potential employers by attending our FREE event!\n\nOn this 10th Anniversary of the War in Iraq, we remember our brave servicemen and women. To the 4,500 troops who died there; to the more than 30,000 wounded Americans who have come home ? your selfless sacrifices will never be forgotten.\n\nOn September 11, a heavily armed group executed a terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, killing Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glenn Doherty. The following remarks were prepared for delivery by Congressman Gus Bilirakis for today?s Foreign Affairs Committee hearing regarding these attacks:\n\nCongressman Bilirakis, member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Congressional Anti-Terrorism Caucus, today joined over 50 of his Congressional colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama and U.S. Secretary of State Clinton to demand answers regarding the security failures that led to the September 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gus, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, attended a hearing titled \"Investigating the Chinese Threat, Part Two: Human Rights Abuses, Torture and Disappearances.\" He questioned human rights leader Rebiya Kadeer about why the Obama Administration has not agreed to meet with her, despite having met with previous administrations about human rights violations in China.\n\nGus, the Vice Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, attended a joint hearing on July 25 with Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki titled \"Back From the Battlefield: DoD and VA Collaboration to Assist Service Members Returning to Civilian Life.\" His question was about efforts to combat traumatic brain injury (TBI) and PTSD.\n\nAs a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues, Gus spoke on the House Floor on July 19 to recall a somber anniversary that has pained the Cypriot and Hellenic communities for the past 38 years. Watch here:\n\nGus spoke on the House Floor in advance of a vote to repeal the Democratic health care overhaul, which has raised taxes, cost jobs, and limited personal control of health care. Americans deserve meaningful and affordable health care reform that will lower costs, protect consumers, and increase accessibility, while allowing Americans to control their own health decisions.\n\nLast week, Gus, who is Vice Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, presented military service medals to two constituents.\n\nIn a surprise ceremony, Gus presented the Bronze Star Medal, along with a host of other service medals, to Palm Harbor resident Robert Smiddy, who served as part of the U.S. Army's 97th Infantry Division during World War II.\n\nMy FOX Tampa Bay (July 2, 2012) - It was an unfortunate reality for Bucs fans the last two seasons: if you wanted to see the home team at Raymond James Stadium, you likely had to buy a ticket.\n\nThirteen of the last 16 home games were blacked out on television in the area. That may change after the NFL confirmed a Wall Street Journal report about new blackout rules.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gus gathered leaders within the tax and consumer protection industry to discuss the growing problem of tax refund fraud.\n\nSince 2008, the IRS has identified 470,000 incidents of identity theft affecting more than 390,000 taxpayers. After reviewing only 30 percent of the 100 million returns filed this year, the IRS has already confirmed 2.6 million cases of fraud.\n\nThe following article appeared in the Tampa Bay Times on June 22, 2012:\n\nIt was one of those \"read the fine print\" moments.\n\nAs Vice Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Gus chaired a hearing on June 19 examining the Department of Veterans Affairs disability claims backlog.\n\nDuring the hearing, Gus also addressed a problem with the Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAP), which is meant to provide one year of training and education benefits to certain unemployed veterans.\n\nBy Rep. Gus Bilirakis\n\nPublished June 14, 2012\n\nhttps://bit.ly/Mt8TeI\n\nPresident Obama's misunderstanding of the economy seems to be far worse than we thought. That's what Americans are realizing after the president's astonishing comments at a press conference last week.\n\nWe once again find ourselves at the start of the Atlantic Hurricane season. Last year, Americans spanning the eastern seaboard experienced the impacts of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Many communities in the northeast are still working to recover from those storms.\n\nTAMPA ? Three Florida lawmakers are urging the Department of Veterans Affairs to move forward with a major construction project at the James A. Haley VA Medical Center that a VA cost analysis said would more than pay for itself over the next 30 years.\n\nGus would like to share two recent reports that are prime examples of the carelessness with which your tax dollars are being spent, and the cost that it will have on the country's economic recovery.\n\nOne of the 16 Americans charged in Egypt for promoting democracy and religious freedom is John Tomaszewski, a former staff member for Congressman Bilirakis.\n\nTomaszewski was in Egypt when a travel ban came into force and was one of six Americans who sought refuge at the American embassy. After the travel ban was released, he recently returned to Washington.\n\nRecently, President Obama released his annual budget proposal. For the fourth straight year, his budget fails to seriously address our nation's debt crisis and calls for higher taxes and increased stimulus spending. This budget punishes small businesses, job creators, and seniors at the expense of the administration's spending addiction.\n\nRep. Gus Bilirakis (FL-09) applauded the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday for supporting his amendment to the Protecting Investment in Oil Shale the Next Generation of Environmental, Energy, and Resource Security (PIONEERS) Act, which the House will vote on later this week.\n\nLast week, Gus and several of his colleagues sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking him to amend its policy of blacking out games in the home market that have not sold out within 72 hours of kickoff.\n\nThis past week, Gus joined the Congressional Manufacturing Caucus, and is currently the sole Florida representative in the caucus.\n\nWith more than 300,000 manufacturing jobs across the state of Florida, Gus understands the important role manufacturing will play when it comes to improving the local and national economy.\n\nIn a surprise ceremony on Wednesday, Gus presented Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee with a Congressional commendation for providing honor escorts to soldiers who have been killed in action.\n\nThe proclamation, which is entered into the Congressional Record, is below.\n\nLast week, Gus joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers in submitting a letter to the House Ways & Means Committee, which crafts the nation's tax policy, encouraging the committee to include the extension of the state and local sales tax deduction when Congress considers a larger tax extension package early next year.\n\nOn Monday, Gus toured the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at St. Joseph's Women's Hospital in Tampa, which is undergoing an expansion to accommodate the growing need of women's and infant's care in the Tampa Bay area. Sadly, many of the infants at the NICU are born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), meaning they were born to a woman addicted to drugs.\n\nAs Vice Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Gus has been an advocate for veterans services. So when he found out that some people were taking advantage of veterans by charging them for filing claims with the VA, he took action. This week, the House passed a bill containing language that will reinstate criminal penalties on those who charge veterans unauthorized fees.\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee held a hearing on Tuesday titled \"Ten Years after 9/11: Can Terrorists Still Exploit our Visa System?\", and Gus was invited to discuss the need to strengthen the student visa screening process (\n\nGus spoke today at a FEMA conference called \"Getting Real II: Inclusive Emergency Management for the Whole Community\" about the need for communities to improve the way they prepare for, respond to, recover from and mitigate the impact of disasters.\n\nLast week, Gus visited with 970 WFLA about the ongoing debt negotiations and his commitment to finding a responsible solution to the nation's fiscal problems that controls federal spending and moves America toward a balanced budget without raising taxes.\n\nListen to clips from the interview here (caution: the audio is very loud):\n\nWashington, DC (July 13, 2011) – Since being elected to Congress, Gus has made it one of his top priorities to be a voice for all religious minorities wherever they may be persecuted and to continuously work in a bipartisan manner with his colleagues to condemn violations of religious freedom throughout the world.\n\nMany of the nation's veterans are struggling under oppressive debt, poor credit, and rising unemployment. In fact nearly 1 million veterans are unemployed right now, and nearly one-third of those out of work are Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. For America's heroes, this is not acceptable. These soldiers have upheld their promise to America, now it's time for America to help them.\n\nOn Thursday, Gus sat down for a live radio interview on WTBN's \"Drive Time with Bill Bunkley\" show. Gus discussed the ongoing debt limit negotiations, the need to create jobs, two of his veterans-related bills, and the upcoming veterans and military resource fair.\n\nOn Monday, Gus was featured on 970 WFLA in Tampa, where he discussed the House's plan to vote on a balanced budget amendment.\n\n\"We have to change our ways and I think this is a good start,\" Gus said of the proposal. He also discussed the debt ceiling and the need for substantial spending cuts as a way to help improve the nation's fiscal situation and create jobs.\n\nTerrorists have made it clear of their desire to use Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) against the U.S. According to terrorism experts, there is a strong likelihood of a WMD attack. The U.S. must be prepared for this grim possibility.\n\nLast Friday, June 10, Gus held a Congressional hearing in Clearwater, FL, to discuss emergency preparedness issues. As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications, Bilirakis is responsible for ensuring that federal, state and local agencies are prepared for potential disasters.\n\nTo help improve student visa security and close a loophole that has allowed terrorists into the U.S., Gus in March introduced a bill to strengthen the student visa program. Read more about his legislation, and the support he has received from the Texas Congressional delegation, in a May 28 article from the Houston Chronicle:\n\nIn honor of National Small Business Week (May 16-20), Gus met with several Tampa-area business owners to hear from them how the federal government affects their bottom line and to discuss how to best help small business in the Tampa area.\n\nEarlier this week, Gus signed on as an original co-sponsor to the Secure Visas Act, a bill introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) that will enhance the way we protect our nation and secure our borders.\n\nThis bill would maintain and increase Visa Security Units in ?highest-risk? countries and would end judicial review for revocation of terrorists? visas.\n\nAs part of its coverage on the death of Osama bin Laden, the Washington Post has compiled an in-depth project about bin Laden and the events leading up to his death.\n\nIn an opening video describing the hunt for bin Laden, Gus is shown questioning General Stanley McChrystal during a 2009 hearing (begins at the 3:10 mark)\n\nNearly 25 World War II veterans from the Tampa Bay area were able to fly to Washington, DC, on May 3, 2011 to spend time at the World War II Memorial. The trip was arranged by the Honor Flight Network, a non-profit program founded five years ago to bring WWII veterans to visit the nation's capital.\n\nOn April 26, Gus visited a Tampa-area gas station to hold an impromptu townhall with customers about the impact of rising gas prices. He visited with dozens of people to hear their concerns, and even pumped some gas. Watch some of the footage from his visit below:\n\nDetermining the next step for your child after high school graduation can be difficult for both parents and students alike. Simply navigating the admissions and student financial aid process can make an already anxious situation even more complicated.\n\nBy Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.)\n\nPublished April 1, 2011 12:59 PM ET\n\nMany foreign students come to the United States with noble intentions of receiving a world-class education. Unfortunately, terrorists have taken to exploiting our nation's well-intentioned student visa process to gain access into our country.\n\nAs Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications, Gus held a hearing on Thursday to examine the Department of Homeland Security's preparedness related to health issues. The witness was Dr. Alexander Garza, Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs and Chief Medical Officer with DHS.\n\nWe all know the old adage \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.\" You've probably told it to yourself at some point.\n\nThat point appears to be now for President Obama, with the release of his latest budget that spends too much, taxes too much and borrows too much ? again.\n\nOn Thursday, Gus spoke with 970 WFLA about the two-year anniversary of the President's stimulus project:\n\nThe following clips have been airing throughout the day:\n\n\"It has been two years since President Obama signed a stimulus program into law, and a trillion bucks later, Congressman Gus Bilirakis of Palm Harbor says it's obvious it didn't work...\n\nWashington, DC (February 15, 2011) – On Tuesday, Gus met with Eric K. Shinseki, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and a Retired U.S. Army General, to discuss issues vital to veterans and the ways Congress and the Department can work to advocate for veterans benefits.\n\nThroughout the healthcare debate, Democrats claimed that if you like your health care plan, you'd be able to keep that health care plan.\n\nBut it's more than evident that just a few months after enacting Obamacare, that is not the case. Millions of people will have no choice but to switch their health care plans.\n\nDemocrats this week called the House back to Washington for another last-minute federal government bailout of more than $26 billion. It is another in a long line of perpetual bailout bills coming out of Washington.\n\nIn an effort to engage the Floridians to talk about the challenges facing our country, Gus hosted an America Speaking Out Town Hall in Plant City on Thursday night.\n\nOver 100 people packed City Hall to share their ideas for solving America's most pressing problems including the economy, jobs, national debt, health care and immigration.\n\nOn Saturday more than 600 Tampa Bay area residents attended Gus's latest foreclosure assistance workshop, at Freedom High School in New Tampa. The workshop offered homeowners an opportunity to meet directly with lenders and receive assistance from housing counselors. Gus previously held similar workshops in Pasco County in 2008 and a second one in Pinellas County last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gus hosted his third annual Career Fair in Tampa. At a time when Floridians are facing double-digit unemployment rates for the first time in decades, the fair served as great opportunity for people in search of work to meet with more than forty potential employers in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nGus attended the opening of the new Plant City Advance Traffic Management System on Tuesday afternoon. The enhancements will allow the city to monitor traffic and adjust signal timings proactively when there is major congestion, a special event or an evacuation.\n\nOn Thursday Gus continued his push to have legislation available online for 72 hours before it is voted on in the House, when he joined AM Tampa Bay on News Radio 970 WFLA:\n\nOn Wednesday, Gus took to the House floor and called for a stop to federal funding of ACORN after sending a letter to President Obama asking him to end taxpayer funding of the group:\n\nThroughout this great nation's storied history, brave men and women have answered the call to defend our freedoms and way of life. Tragically, some have made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives in defense of our liberty, and their sacrifices serve as a constant reminder of the high cost of freedom and the hope for a safer, more peaceful world.\n\nGus, who is Co-Chair of the Military Veterans Caucus, today met with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen during the Caucus's 111th Congress kick-off event. At the event, Admiral Mullen spoke about his experience with Wounded Warriors and engaged in Q&A with Members.\n\nBy Jeff Mason, Reuters News\n\nWASHINGTON, March 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama picked a seasoned emergency response coordinator from Florida on Wednesday to lead the federal agency that was widely panned for its handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nToday, Gus joined with over 30 of his House in calling for opening the books at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the public, allowing Americans to see inside the decisions made by the leadership of the two mortgage giants at the heart of the crisis gripping our financial markets.\n\nGiven all of the recent hurricane activity in Gulf of Mexico, do you and your loved ones have a plan in the event of an emergency?\n\nOn Friday, Gus held an informal town meeting with constituents at a local gas station. Gus had a chance to gain input from people who are affected by high gas prices and also offered cost saving tips while seeking advice on solutions. He even pumped gas for some customers.\n\nRecently Gus joined other House Republican Freshman on the \"American Energy Tour.\" Gus traveled to the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado. In addition, Gus took an aerial tour of ANWR to examine exploration techniques, opportunities, and challenges in the oil industry and spoke with industry and government leaders.\n\nBy GUS BILIRAKIS\n\nThere is no symbol that better represents our country's history and tradition than the American flag. Our flag is prominently displayed in classrooms, courtrooms, above our nation's capital, and even on the moon. It serves as a constant reminder of what makes America great.\n\nOn May 29th, he saw the result of years of hard work and persistence when he gathered with local officials to break ground on the new facility, which will be adjacent to St. Timothy Lutheran Church in Tarpon Springs.\n\nBy GUS BILIRAKIS\n\nEvery 40 seconds, someone in America has a stroke. In fact, it is the third leading cause of deaths in the nation. Each year, during the month of May, Americans band together, not only to share their support in the fight against stroke, but also raise awareness of how it can be treated, and more importantly, prevented.\n\nBy GUS BILIRAKIS\n\nApril is National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention month. We see the heart-wrenching and troubling stories on the news about victims of sexual assault, but it becomes even more disturbing when we realize that it is even happening in our own community.\n\nFlorida is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on the agency's design and construction standards for community shelters. The state believes that FEMA's 361 standard for shelter construction is too rigorous for the force of winds that hurricane shelters in Florida generally encounter.\n\nThe April edition of ESPN's The Magazine, which hit newstands last week, contained a quote from Gus on the Tampa Bay Rays 2008 season. His comments were part of a larger article (\"Take It to the House\") previewing the 2008 Baseball Season with opinions from each team's local members of Congress.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed, H. Res. 997, a resolution supporting a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Georgia and Ukraine. Gus, who is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Europe, co-sponsored the resolution and supported its passage.\n\nToday the Washington Times published an op-ed authored by Gus calling on the U.N. Security Council to make India a permanent member. Last year, Bilirakis introduced H.Res. 638 that urges the U.N. to take the necessary actions to establish India as a permanent member.\n\nPosted: By GUS BILIRAKIS\n\n\"Brush your teeth\" is a phrase many parents repeat to their children every day. Yet despite parental vigilance and regular brushing, even best efforts at good oral hygiene can still fall short. This is why having access to dental health care is so important.\n\nCongress must pass a FISA fix that addresses modern day intelligence gathering scenarios. In August 2007, Gus joined more than 190 House Republicans signing and releasing a letter to House Speaker Pelosi urging her to pass the necessary FISA reform that closes the existing intelligence gap identified by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).\n\nAn act of vandalism to a 30-mile-long anhydrous ammonia pipeline in Riverview, Fla., has raised serious concerns about pipeline security. On Nov. 13, three teenage boys had drilled a hole into the pipeline in an alleged search for money. The leak resulted in the release of a noxious chemical cloud and the evacuation of thousands of local Hillsborough residents."
