Purpose\n\nThis , regulation assigns responsibilities and provides guidance on patient administration in Army regional medical\n\ncommands (RMCs) and military treatment facilities (MTFs).\n\n1-2. References\n\nRequired and related publications and prescribed and referenced forms are listed in appendix A.\n\n1-3. Explanation of abbreviations and terms\n\nAbbreviations and special terms used in this regulation are explained in the glossary.\n\n1-4. Responsibilities\n\na.\n\nThe Surgeon General (TSG) develops policies governing the provision of patient administrative services for U.S. Army MTFs worldwide.\n\nb.\n\nMajor overseas commanders and commanders of U.S. Army Medical Commands are responsible for the adminis­tration of patients receiving care in MTFs under their jurisdiction.\n\nc.\n\nRMC and MIT commanders are responsible for the administration of patients receiving care under their jurisdiction.\n\nd.\n\nPatient administrators provide guidance on policies, procedures, and practices prescribed in this regulation.\n\nChapter 2\n\nPatient Policies\n\n2-1. Eligibility verification\n\nThe Military Installation Identification Card Issuance Activity establishes an individual's eligibility for medical care. The commander of an Army MIT will confirm the patient's identity and verify entitlement through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) or identification (ID) card verification. Eligibility issues will be referred to the patient administrator.\n\n2-2. Identification procedures\n\na.\n\nAll persons, including soldiers in uniform, must show satisfactory evidence of their beneficiary •status. A valid ID card and enrollment in DEERS will establish beneficiary status. Children under age 10 must be enrolled in DEERS, but are not routinely issued an ID card. Secretary of the Army designees are issued a letter from the U.S. Army Medical Command (USAMEDCOM) or the WIT commander where designee status has been delegated, (see para 3-50) which establishes their beneficiary status. They are not enrolled in DEERS and will not have an ID card. Discharged female members who require maternity care establish beneficiary status with a copy of their DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).\n\nb.\n\nTypes of Uniformed Services ID cards (AR 600-8-14) are as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nDD Form 2A(ACT) (Active Duty Military ID Card) (green for active duty (AD)), red for Reserve Component (RC), and gray or blue for retirees).\n\n(2)\n\nDD Form 1173, (Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card), (tan, for family members, civilian overseas, and foreign military personnel/family members).\n\n(3)\n\nPublic Health Service (PHS) Form 1866-1 (Commissioned Officers Identification Card-Active Duty) for the Commissioned Corps of the PHS, and PHS Form 1866-2 (Commissioned Officers Identification Card-Inactive Reserve) for Reserve PHS personnel. The forms are for informational purposes only.\n\nc.\n\nMTF personnel will not provide routine care to patients with questionable eligibility. When proper identification is not available and no emergency exists, a statement of eligibility should be initiated by the MIT personnel and signed by the sponsor prior to delivery of care. The statement of eligibility will be forwarded to the MTF medical services accountable officer (MSAO). If proof of eligibility is not provided within 30 days, the patient will be billed as an emergency nonbeneficiary. In an emergency, medical care will be rendered before eligibility determination. Ineligible patients will be treated only during the period of the emergency. (See para 3-55.)\n\n2-3. Priorities\n\nWhen an MIT commander must refer care to eligible beneficiaries because of a temporary lack of access, a priority system will be used as specified in a through c below. The MIT commander must coordinate care for all beneficiaries based upon access and capabilities. Beneficiaries enrolled in the TRICARE Prime option at an MTF are provided space-required care and not space-available care in compliance with the TRICARE access standards. Beneficiaries\n\nAR 40-400 • 12 March 2001 .\n\n1\n\nDODDOA-009515\n\nparticipating in the TRICARE Standard and Extra options are provided space-available care in MTFs. The medical or dental Army MIT commander will have final authority regarding whether or not a beneficiary will be seen in the facility. A nonavailability statement for authorized nonemergency inpatient care is required for non-enrolled Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) beneficiaries. The first level of appeal for decisions surrounding nonavailability statement issuance is the MTF commander, the second level appeal is the RMC commander, and the third and final level of appeal is the USAMEDCOM (MCHO-CL-M).\n\na. General rule. Among the following beneficiary groups, access priority for care in MTFs where TRICARE is implemented will be as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nAD members;\n\n(2)\n\nAD members' family members who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime;\n\n(3)\n\nRetirees, their family members and survivors who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime;\n\n(4)\n\nAD members' family members who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime; and\n\n(5)\n\nRetirees, their family members and survivors who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime.\n\nb.\n\nSpecial provisions. In applying the general rules, the following special provisions are applicable:\n\n(1)\n\nMilitary members not on AD but entitled to MTF care, are associated with priority group 1. This includes RC members entitled to medical care relating to conditions incurred in the line of duty (LD) and members on the temporary disability retired list (TDRL) for required periodic medical examinations.\n\n(2)\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other foreign military members who are entitled to MTF care pursuant to an applicable international agreement are associated with priority group 1 for the scope of services specified in the agreement.\n\n(3)\n\nNATO and other foreign military members' family members who are entitled to care pursuant to an applicable international agreement are associated with priority group 2 for the scope of services specified in the agreement.\n\n(4)\n\nSurvivors of sponsors who die on AD, as provided in section 1076(a), title 10, United States Code (10 USC 1076(a)), are, for purposes of MTF access, considered together with dependents of AD members. They would, therefore, be in priority group 2 or 4, depending on Prime enrollment status.\n\n(5)\n\nIndividuals other than those in any of the beneficiary groups identified in priority groups 1 through 5 do not have priority access.\n\n(6)\n\nPriority access rules are not applicable to bona fide medical emergencies or cases in which the provision of certain medical care is required by law or applicable Department of Defense (DOD) Directive or Instruction. This includes care for civilian employees exposed to health hazards in the workplace or injured on the job.\n\nc.\n\nExceptions to general rules. In the following instances, MTF commanders have discretion to grant exceptions to priority access rules.\n\n(1)\n\nA higher priority may be given to a secretarial designee, to the extent appropriate to the context in which secretarial designee status is given.\n\n(2)\n\nA higher priority may be given to an AD members' family member who is in priority group 4 owing to the unavailability of TRICARE Prime at the place of the sponsor's assignment (for example, a remote continental United states (CONUS) or outside the continental United States (OCONUS) location), when the family member is temporarily in a location where TRICARE has been implemented and needs medical care.\n\n(3)\n\nTo the extent authorized by the ASD(HA) for the particular graduate medical education (GME) program or MTF involved, after coordination with the TRICARE Lead Agent, a patient may be given a higher priority if necessary to maintain an adequate clinical case mix for GME programs functioning in the MTF or for readiness-related medical skills sustainment activities. Mechanisms to implement this policy could include identification of space available to carry out specific procedures or treat specific clinical diagnoses, or, in unique circumstances, provision for assignment to primary care managers (PCMs) of a limited number of individuals not eligible for TRICARE Prime enrollment.\n\n(4)\n\nA higher priority may be given in other unexpected or extraordinary cases, not otherwise addressed in this policy, in which the MTF commander determines, in coordination with the TRICARE Lead Agent, that a special exception is in the best interest of the military health system and TRICARE.\n\n(5)\n\nIn overseas locations, other exceptions may be established to the extent necessary to support mission objectives.\n\n(6)\n\nOther priority groupings are not authorized.\n\n2-4. Primary care management\n\nAD soldiers are assigned a PCM. (See glossary.) The soldier will report to the PCM for sick call (AR 40-66). Nonactive duty (NAD) TRICARE eligible beneficiaries, who choose to enroll, will be assigned a PCM. Other categories of beneficiaries may also be assigned PCMs as approved by the Army MTF commander.\n\n2-5. NATO STANAG/ABCA QSTAG/SOLOG agreements\n\nThis regulation implements NATO standardization agreements (STANAGs) 2061, 2101, 2132, and 3113; American, British, Canadian, and Australian (ABCA) Quadripartite Standardization Agreement (QSTAG) 470; and Standardiza­tion of Certain Aspects of Operations and Logistics (SOLOG) 74 in chapters 3 and 4.\n\n2. AR 40-400 • 12 March 2001\n\n2-6. Commercial transportation or travel and nonmedical attendant travel\n\na.\n\nThe cost of commercial or privately owned transportation and per diem for Army AD soldiers and required attendants for the purpose of receiving outpatient medical or dental care is chargeable to the operating funds of the unit to which the member is assigned. This policy applies to members assigned to Army activities worldwide and those assigned to other departments or agencies in CONUS. Inpatient travel is funded by the operational funds of the MTF.\n\nb.\n\nA medical officer may recommend that a family member be accompanied by a nonmedical attendant (NMA). The NMA is warranted when the family member is not able to travel alone because of physical or mental incapacity or age. In CONUS, only the AD soldier may be an attendant to the family member with the exception of travel to specialized treatment services (STSs). (See para 2-6e.) The AD soldier is entitled to reimbursement for costs of transportation and enroute per diem; there is no entitlement at the treatment site. The unit commander of the AD soldier determines if, and for how long, a member may perform NMA duties. The NMA duties may be performed in an ordinary leave status, funded temporary duty (TDY) by MTF with concurrence of resource management, or permissive TDY status. Travel of the AD soldier's dependents stationed OCONUS is authorized for medical care. Dependent travel from or within OCONUS locations is authorized on invitational travel orders (ITOs). An NMA may be recommended by a medical officer. In OCONUS sites, anyone capable of performing the NMA duties may be assigned and reimbursed for costs of transportation and expenses at the treatment location (Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFIR)).\n\nc.\n\nA medical officer may recommend that an AD soldier or dependent of an AD soldier, and TDRL personnel, (but not a retiree-except a retiree on the TDRL as noted in AR 635-40-nor a dependent of a retiree) be accompanied by an NMA. A soldier may serve as an NMA. Family members or other nonmilitary persons may receive travel reimburse­ment as an NMA for escorting AD members CONUS or OCONUS. Family members or other nonmilitary persons may receive travel reimbursement for escorting AD dependents OCONUS. An AD soldier may be reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses while serving as an NMA. The unit commander determines if, and for how long, a soldier may perform NMA duties. A soldier may perform NMA duties in an ordinary leave status, permissive TDY, or in a funded TDY status. When NMA duties are authorized with Government funds for AD outpatients, the costs of lodging and per diem are chargeable to operational funds of that soldier's unit. For AD inpatients, travel and per diem and expenses of NMAs are chargeable to MTF funds (JHR, volume 1, paragraph U7550-6, and Joint Federal Travel Technical Messages 5-93, 7-93, and 7-97).\n\nd.\n\nRetired members and their dependents have no financial entitlement for their travel except TDRL members when they are reporting to the MTF for TDRL re-examination. Travel may be accomplished on Government transportation on a space-available basis.\n\ne.\n\nIn those cases where it is financially advantageous for the Government to treat a patient in an STS facility, an attendant may be authorized when a patient is unable to travel unattended. The attendant may be any person suitable to perform the required attendant duties; this person may be reimbursed for travel expenses. Entitlement is defined in Jr 1R, Volume I, paragraph U-7950 and U-7951.\n\n2-7. Medical examinations for insurance purposes\n\nSubject to access and available resources, examinations may be provided for those authorized persons defined in chapter 3. The examinee is entitled to a written report of the examination. Insurance companies will be charged search and copying fees when a request for a report of examination is received.\n\n2-8. Maternity care for active duty members\n\nArmy soldiers who become pregnant while on AD and who remain on AD are authorized maternity care in Uniformed Services MTFs. They are also authorized maternity care from civilian sources as described in a and b below.\n\na.\n\nPhysical limitations of pregnant soldiers. A pregnant soldier will continue to perform duties, limited by physical profile as outlined in AR 40-501. If the member remains at her duty station, maternity care will be provided at the MIT serving the station if obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) services are available and the member resides and works within 50 miles of the MTF. Active duty members (ADMs) who reside and work more than 50 miles from an MIT are required to enroll in the TRICARE Prime Remote Program (TPRP). As a general rule, pregnancy care for soldiers enrolled in TPRP will be provided locally by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. Upon discharge from the hospital following delivery and when medically indicated, the member may, upon recommendation of the attending physician, be granted convalescent leave per AR 600-8-10.\n\nb.\n\nMaternity care while in a leave status. A pregnant soldier may elect to take leave and deliver in the vicinity of her leave address. When such leave is contemplated, the member will be counseled by the leave approving authority and local MIT PCM about requirements for obtaining maternity care from civilian sources. If the member's leave address is within 50 miles of an MIT that offers OB/GYN services, maternity care will be provided at the MIT.\n\nc.\n\nExisted prior to service (EPTS) pregnancy-RC Members. An RC member who is pregnant at the time of entry on active duty for training (ADT) for a period of 30 days or less is authorized only emergency care for that pregnancy.\n\n2-9. Remediable physical defects developed in the military service\n\nWhen a medical examination shows that an Army soldier has developed a remediable defect, the patient will be offered the opportunity of surgical repair or other medical treatment if medically indicated. If the soldier refuses surgery, other\n\nAR 40-400 • 12 March 2001.\n\ntreatment, or other diagnostic procedure, which is considered necessary to enable the person to properly perform their\n\nmilitary duties, the provisions of AR 600-20 apply. In the case of Navy or Air Force patients, the matter will be\n\nreferred to the nearest headquarters of the Service concerned. Surgical intervention will not be performed to correct a\n\npreexisting condition in the case of an RC member unless there is an LD determination that the condition was incurred\n\nor aggravated in the LD.\n\n2-10. Hospitalization before the effective date of separation or retirement orders\n\nWhen a military patient is hospitalized before the effective date of separation or retirement orders, notification\n\nprocedures in AR 600-8-24 for officers and in AR 635-200 for enlisted personnel apply.\n\n2-11. Statements of prolonged hospitalization\n\nAn MTF commander is authorized to issue a statement of prolonged hospitalization for a period exceeding 90 days (Jr IR, 37 USC 554). The statement will be sent to the installation transportation officer who will instruct and assist the patient in arranging for transportation of family members and household goods. This statement is not required when the member is transferred on permanent change of station (PCS) orders from OCONUS to a CONUS MTF.\n\n2-12. Consent by a nonmilitary patient to medical care\n\na.\n\nLegality of consent. Legality of consent is determined by the law of the State in which the facility it• located,\n\nunless preempted by Federal law, or as modified in overseas locations by Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA).\n\nb.\n\nRequirement for consent. A nonmilitary person may not be furnished care in Army MTFs without his or her consent or the consent of a person authorized under applicable local law, court order, or power of attorney to consent on the patient's behalf. Except for emergencies, when a patient for some reason other than a judicial determination of mental incompetency is unable to consent, consent must be obtained from the person whom local law determines is authorized to consent on the patient's behalf. When a judicial determination of mental incompetency has been made, consent must be obtained from the person whom the court appoints to act for the incompetent patient. In the absence of any governing State law provision regarding surrogate consent, the consent of the spouse or next of kin is required. Questions concerning consent requirements or authority to consent will be referred to the servicing Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) or legal advisor.\n\nc.\n\nForm of consent. Consent may be either express or implied.\n\n(1)\n\nImplied consent. Implied consent may be inferred from actions of the patient, or other circumstances, even though specific words of consent are not used. For example, a patient's application for admission to an MTF is implied consent to hospitalization. If the patient is a minor incapable of giving consent, implied consent of the parent or guardian may be found in actions of the parent or guardian requesting or not objecting to medical care for the minor. Moreover, consent to treatment is implied in certain emergency situations when patients are incapable of giving or denying consent and their condition represents a serious or imminent threat to life, health, or well-being.\n\n(2)\n\nExpress consent. Express consent involves a statement of consent to proposed medical care made by the patient or person authorized to act on the patient's behalf. Express consent may be valid whether it is oral or in writing. However, written consent must be obtained for both inpatients and outpatients before performing the procedures outlined in d below.\n\n(3)\n\nOF 522 (Medical Record-Request for Administration of Anesthesia and for Performance of Operations • and Other Procedures). This form will be used to record express written consents. (See d and e below.) Keep a record to document consent when there are local legal consent requirements that cannot be adequately captured on OF 522.\n\n(4)\n\nDA Form 4359-R (Authorization for Psychiatric Service Treatment). This form will be used for admission of patients to psychiatric treatment units. In such cases, OF 522 will also be completed.\n\nd.\n\nProcedures requiring written consent. Requests for the procedures in (1) through (7) below must be recorded on OF 522. (In the case of dental care, one OF 522 may be used to record a complete course of treatment, as appropriate.) Any questions about the necessity or advisability of a written consent should be resolved in favor of obtaining a written consent.\n\n(1)\n\nAll surgery involving entry into the body by an incision or through one of the natural body openings.\n\n(2)\n\nAny procedure or course of treatment in which anesthesia is used, whether or not entry into the body is involved. This includes dental procedures involving the use of either general anesthetic, intravenous sedation, or nitrous oxide sedation.\n\n(3)\n\nAll nonoperative procedures that involve more than a slight risk of harm to the patient or that involve the risk of a change in body structure.\n\n(4)\n\nAll procedures in which x ray, radiation, or other radioactive substance is used in the patient's treatment.\n\n(5)\n\nAll procedures that involve electroshock therapy.\n\n(6)\n\nAll transfusions of blood or blood products.\n\n(7)\n\nAll other procedures that, in the opinion of the attending physician, dentist, chief of service, clinic chief, or the commander, require a written consent.\n\ne.\n\nCounseling before obtaining consent. The physician, dentist, or other health care provider/practitioner who is to\n\n4.\n\nAR 40-400 • 12 March 2001\n\nDODDOA-00951 8\n\nperform or supervise the procedure will counsel the patient or the consenting person as appropriate to provide the basis for an informed consent. (See legal requirements in f below.) In written consents, any exceptions to surgery or other procedures made by the consenting person will be recorded by the health care provider/practitioner on OF 522. When all the data in Parts A and B of OF 522 are completed, the counseling must be attested to by signatures of the counseling health care provider/practitioner and the consenting person in Part C of OF 522.\n\nf Sufficiency of consent. The consenting person must be legally capable of giving consent and must understand the nature of the procedure, the attendant risks, expected results, possible alternative methods of treatment, and the prognosis if treatment is not given. Legality of consent is determined by the law of the State in which the facility is located, unless preempted by Federal law or as modified in overseas locations.\n\ng. Nonmilitary minors. The sufficiency of consent by a nonmilitary minor to medical or dental examinations or treatment will be determined under the same criteria as provided in f above. Most States have laws concerning consent by minors. Many States allow the treatment of venereal disease and certain other conditions with the consent of the minor alone, without parental knowledge or consent. If no law exists on the subject or if the law does not specifically prohibit consent by a minor, the maturity of the minor should dictate whether he or she may give a legally sufficient consent. The health care provider/practitioner obtaining the consent will determine the maturity of the minor. The minor's age, level of intelligence, and the minor's understanding of the complications and seriousness of the proposed treatment are all factors to consider when determining the maturity of the minor. When the minor's consent alone is legally sufficient, the minor's decision to authorize or reject the proposed treatment is binding. Even when the minor's consent alone is not legally sufficient, his or her consent should be obtained along with the parent's consent whenever the minor is able to understand the significance of the proposed procedures. If there is a question as to the sufficiency of the minor's consent, the servicing SJA or legal advisor will be consulted.\n\n(1)\n\nIf not prohibited under the laws of the State in which the MIT is located, parents may grant powers of attorney to authorize other persons to consent to medical care for minor children. Mature minor children may be granted authority to consent to care for themselves and other minor children of the family or to other persons appointed by the parents or legal guardian. Members of Army MTF staff may not accept appointment as a special attorney for this purpose unless based solely on a personal relationship with the sponsor. A health care provider/practitioner who accepts such appointment will not consent to any treatment he or she authorizes or performs unless approved by the MTF commander or designee.\n\n(2)\n\nPersons who wish to execute a power of attorney will be referred to the appropriate SJA or legal office for assistance.\n\nh.\n\nMilitary minors. Members of the Uniformed Services who would otherwise be minors under local law are considered to be emancipated and capable of consent as if they were adults, subject to command aspects of medical care for AD soldiers as described in AR 600-20.\n\ni.\n\nSterilization of mental incompetents. A determination of the specific authority of parents, courts, or other third parties to consent to or authorize the sterilization of mental incompetents in the State where the MTF is located will be coordinated with the local SJA or servicing legal advisor before performing the procedure.\n\nJ. Psychiatric disorders.\n\n(1)\n\nThe MIT commander may temporarily detain, without a court order or consent, nonmilitary beneficiaries with a psychiatric disorder which makes them dangerous to themselves or others when such person is found on the military reservation where the MTF is located. Temporary involuntary detention will conform with local law, and the local civilian authorities will be notified immediately upon detention of a nonmilitary psychiatric patient.\n\n(2)\n\nMovement of nonmilitary psychiatric persons without proper consent or court order normally will not be done under the auspices of an Army MIT.\n\n(3)\n\nThe validity of a court order directing involuntary confinement or treatment of a patient in an Army MIT is a matter for review, in each instance, by the proper SM or legal advisor.\n\n(4)\n\nSee paragraph 5-23 concerning evacuation of nonmilitary psychiatric patients in foreign countries.\n\nk Advance directives (living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care). (AR 40-3, chap 2).\n\n1. Autopsy consent. (See para 6-5.)\n\n2-13. Patient transfers\n\nPatients will be treated at the lowest echelon equipped and staffed to provide required medical care consistent with evacuation policies. When required care is not available, patients will be transferred to the nearest Armed Forces MTF or other Federal MIT for which they are eligible that has the required capability. The patient may also be referred to TRICARE service centers for coordination/assistance related to transfers. Government transportation of the military patient and one or more attendants, if required, is authorized. DA Form 3981 (Transfer of Patient) or a medical staff approved locally developed form may be used to communicate among the transferring physician and other MTF staff elements. DA Form 3981 is available on the Army Electronic Library CD-ROM (EM 0001) and on the USAPA web (WWW.usapa. army .mi I).\n\nAR 40-400 • 12 March 2001 .\n\n5\n\n2-14. Care beyond an MTFs capability\n\na.\n\nHealth care services are authorized to eligible beneficiaries in three ways. First is the direct care system where all\n\nDOD beneficiary categories are entitled to receive health care benefits, with AD soldiers having priority access to care.\n\n(See chaps 2 and 8.) Second, DOD is authorized to contract for health care services from Governmental and non-\n\nGovernmental health care sources with reimbursement to participating providers/practitioners under the TRICARE\n\nProgram. Third, under the Supplemental Care Program, DOD may use funds to obtain civilian health care for eligible\n\nbeneficiaries when that care is not available in the MTF. The primary use of supplemental care is to ensure that AD\n\nsoldiers receive all necessary health care services. The process for obtaining civilian specialty and inpatient care\n\nthrough the Supplemental Care Program for AD members will be the same as that established for NAD TRICARE\n\nPrime enrollees. The PCM is responsible for referring the patient for specialty care, and the health care finder arranges\n\nfor civilian care in the contractor's TRICARE network if the care is not available in the MTF. The managed care\n\nsupport (MCS) contractor will then adjudicate the claim in the same fashion as applied to other TRICARE Prime\n\nenrollees except that a copayment will not be applied. The MTF will retain clinical responsibility for the AD member\n\nvia the PCM and administrative oversight of supplemental care payment issues will remain a responsibility of the MTF\n\ncommander. The reimbursement for care beyond the MTFs capability will be according to tables 2-1 through 2-3.\n\nb.\n\nSupplemental care on an inpatient basis will be carefully monitored through the hospital utilization management\n\nprogram.. •\n\nc.\n\nAD patients receiving inpatient supplemental care in another facility will not be counted as occupying a bed in an Army MTF but will be continued on the inpatient census. Also, the patient will be accounted for under \"change of status out.\" (See chap 3.)\n\nd.\n\nUnder TRICARE, the MCS contractor's health care finder will assist with referrals to network providers, where available. If a network provider is not available, the referral will be made to a TRICARE authorized provider. This includes AD referrals. All medical services requested under TRICARE must be reviewed for medical necessity as required by the MCS contract prior to approval by the MTF. Emergencies are exempt from this requirement.\n\ne.\n\nThe MCS contractors will process all claims for AD. Claims of RC soldiers for medical care associated with LD\n\ninjuries or illnesses will be processed using the same procedures.\n\nf The authority for all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)/DOD Health Care Resources Sharing Program Agreements is Public Law 97-174. Provisions of the memorandum of understanding between the VA and DOD entitled, VA/DOD Health Care Resources Sharing Guidelines, dated 29 Jul 83 apply.\n\n2-15. Admission of psychiatric patients\n\nBeneficiaries may be admitted to closed psychiatric wards when they have a mental illness that renders them dangerous to themselves or others.\n\na.\n\nNonmilitary patients. All psychiatric patients should meet Mental Health Service Intensity criteria before being admitted. Psychiatric patients will not be provided prolonged hospitalization or domiciliary care.\n\nb.\n\nMilitary family members. Family members will not be admitted to an Army MTF when their needs are only for domiciliary or custodial care. Family members may be hospitalized for chronic conditions and nervous, mental, and emotional disorders that require active and definitive treatment. Admission will be according to the order of priority in paragraph 2-3.\n\n2-16. Ancillary medical services\n\nAncillary services (for example, pharmacy services, medical laboratory procedures, immunizations, and medical x rays) may be provided to family members and retired members who receive care from civilian sources subject to the availability of space, facilities, and the capabilities of the professional staff.\n\n2-17. Family planning services\n\na.\n\nFamily planning services (for example, counseling, prescription of oral contraceptive pills, and prescription of other methods of contraception) may be furnished to eligible persons requesting such care at Army MTFs. They will be provided to the extent that professional capabilities and facilities permit. When capability is limited or absent, referral to other agencies at no expense to the Government may be arranged through the MTF social work service.\n\nb.\n\nSurgical sterilization may be performed in Army MTFs subject to the availability of space and facilities and the capabilities of the medical staff. Prior written consent will be obtained from the patient. (See para 2-12.) Also see paragraph 2-12 for special consideration relative to sterilization in the case of mental incompetents.\n\n2-18. Abortions\n\na.\n\nAbortions may be performed in Army MTFs at Government expense only when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\n\nb.\n\nEligible beneficiaries may obtain abortions in overseas Army MTFs on a prepaid basis only if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Prepaid abortions for rape and incest are not available in stateside Army MTFs. Charges for prepaid abortions for all beneficiaries, including AD, soldiers, will be based on the established full reimbursement rate\n\n6.

The laws of the host nation apply when performing abortions under this paragraph.\n\nc.\n\nAbortions for other than AD soldiers will be subject to the availability of space and facilities and the capabilities of the professional staff. Abortion procedures are also subject to the priorities listed in paragraph 2-3. Written consent of the patient is required before the procedure. Consent of unemancipated minors will be obtained according to paragraph 2-12. After an abortion, any restrictions or limitations needed for AD soldiers will be determined by the proper medical authority under AR 40-501, chapter 7.\n\nd.\n\nMedical care in Army MTFs as authorized by paragraph 3-39 for former soldiers who are pregnant at the time of separation may include abortions as authorized in a and b above. Follow up and initial family planning counseling may also be furnished if indicated. Transportation for such care will be at the former soldier's expense.\n\ne.\n\nAeromedical transportation may be provided on a prepaid basis (that is, the patient pays the cost of the service in advance) to eligible beneficiaries for abortions or abortion consultation services under the following conditions.\n\n(1)\n\nFor OCONUS sites, intratheater aeromedical transportation is authorized for AD soldiers and other beneficiaries in overseas areas who do not qualify for abortions at Government expense when there is a lack of access to acceptable civilian health care facilities for abortion or abortion consultation due to cost, unavailability of transportation, or cultural and language barriers. In these cases, the abortion or abortion consultation services may be performed at the nearest capable MTF on a prepaid basis.\n\n(2)\n\nIn CONUS, aeromedical transportation is authorized for AD soldiers who do not qualify for abortions at Government expense if they require professional abortion consultation which is not available locally.\n\nf Army Medical Department (AMEDD) personnel do not have to perform or take part in procedures authorized by this paragraph that violate their moral or religious principles. Moral or religious objections will be considered as lack of capability to provide this care.\n\ng. When an Army MTF does not have the space, facilities, or staff capability to perform authorized sterilization and abortion services, arrangements should be made to provide these procedures as follows.\n\n(1)\n\nEligible beneficiaries may be transferred to another MTF where these services can be provided. Enrolled beneficiaries may obtain these services under provisions of the TRICARE Program.\n\n(2)\n\nAD soldiers may be transferred to another MTF where these services can be provided. They may also obtain these procedures from civilian sources under provisions of chapter 9 only when competent medical authority has determined that the procedure is required for urgent medical reasons. Elective care for AD soldiers from civilian sources at Government expense is prohibited.\n\n2-19. Cosmetic surgery\n\na.\n\nFor AD soldiers, medical intervention should be based upon a medical need adjunctive to the patient's health status. Availability of cosmetic surgery is dependent upon the educational and clinical skills maintenance needs of the Army. Elective cosmetic surgery charges for 'nonmilitary patients are found in the annual fiscal year (FY) medical, dental, and subsistence rates for Army MTFs.\n\nb.\n\nFor other than AD soldiers, the following apply.\n\n(1)\n\nThe number of procedures performed will be those that 50 percent to 70 percent of training programs provide per resident as reported by the Residency Review Committee in plastic surgery.\n\n(2)\n\nThe procedures will only be performed by residents in specialties requiring cosmetic surgery for their boards (plastic surgery, ear, nose, throat, ophthalmology, dermatology, and oral surgery), junior staff preparing for board eligibility, and staff certified in those specialties in order to maintain their skills and proficiency.\n\n(3)\n\nThese procedures will only be performed in hospitals that have applied for or have attained designation as an STS facility according to DOD guidance.\n\nTable 2-1 Supplemental care payment responsibilities: Payment for civilian outpatient care, including diagnostic test and procedures, ordered by an MTF provider\n\nBeneficiary category TRICARE Prime copayment TRICARE Extra /Standard Supplemental care Social Security Health Insurance\n\ncost shares & deductibles Program for the Aged (Medicare)­\n\neligible and other non-TRICARE eli­\n\ngibles\n\nAD TRICARE Prime X\n\nEnrollee\n\nNAD TRICARE Prime \" X\n\nEnrollee..\n\ni\n\nAR 40-400 • 12 March 2001\n\n7\n\nTable 2-1 Supplemental care payment responsibilities: Payment for civilian outpatient care, including diagnostic test and procedures, ordered by an MTF provider—Continued\n\nBeneficiary category TRICARE Prime copayment TRICARE Extra /Standard Supplemental care Social Security Health Insurance\n\ncost shares & deductibles Program for the Aged (Medicare)­\n\neligible and other non-TRICARE eli­\n\ngibles\n\nNon-Enrolled X (See note 1.)

The letter will also state that the injury suffered or disease contracted was in LD and that the patient is entitled to medical care.\n\ne. LD determinations. When individuals are admitted to or treated at an MTF during a period of training duty under doubtful LD conditions, the MIT commander will ensure that an LD is initiated. The MTF commander will be furnished a copy of the final determination (to include a report of investigation, when made). In injury cases where LD may be questionable, LD investigation should be requested promptly. Non-emergent surgical intervention will be deferred for suspected preexisting conditions of RC personnel until there is an LD determination that the condition was incurred or aggravated in LD.\n\n(1)\n\nIf the investigation results in a not in line of duty (NLD) determination before the date of expiration of the training period, every effort will be made to disposition hospitalized individuals by the expiration date or as soon as they become transportable. Care for NLD conditions will be provided only to the extent necessary. Such persons are not authorized medical care at Government expense after expiration of their training period. The cost of any care furnished after the expiration date will be collected at the civilian emergency rate from the individual by the MIT concerned.
