        "text": "Army Reserve Center officially opens in Danbury\n\nThe Veterans Memorial Armed Forces Reserve Center has been dedicated. The ribbon was cut Friday afternoon on the $35 million dollar facility, located at 90 Wooster Heights Road in Danbury.\n\nCity Councilman Tom Saadi, a U.S. Army reservist, says he is proud of the facility because Danbury has a long history of military support. Military officials, Senator Chris Murphy, the Mayor and others were on hand for the opening ceremony.\n\nEight Army Reserve Units, including the Danbury-based 411th Civil Affairs Battalion, and the Connecticut National Guard are assigned to the Center.\n\nCommander who led Newtown investigation to retire\n\nCROMWELL, Conn. (AP) The commander of the Connecticut State Police has announced he is stepping down.\n\nCol. Daniel Stebbins, who led the investigation into the December 2012 shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, says he plans to retire at the end of June.\n\nThe 62-year-old Stebbins worked for the state police for more than 30 years.\n\nHe also served for six years as an investigator for the U.S. Attorney's Office, before returning to lead the state police in 2011.\n\nStebbins drew some criticism from Gov. Dannel P. Malloy last year after revealing details about Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza's obsession with mass murders to other police chiefs at a seminar in New Orleans before that information had been made public.\n\nNational Democrats give $750,000 for Esty race\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) National Democrats have bought more than $750,000 worth of campaign advertising time for U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty, a freshman in her first re-election battle.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has reserved $90,000 on New York City cable ads from Sept. 23 to Nov. 4, and $670,000 on Hartford broadcast and cable ads for Esty.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C., campaign committee would not say if national Democrats view Esty as vulnerable because she's a freshman.\n\nEmily Bittner, spokeswoman for the congressional campaign group, said Esty will face what she called unprecedented spending by Republican backers working to keep a GOP majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nLitchfield real estate developer Mark Greenberg received the Connecticut Republican Party's backing to challenge Esty.\n\nTechnical high school students detail energy use\n\nNEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) Students in five Connecticut technical high schools have presented findings and recommendations from a year-long investigation of the environmental impact of their school's energy use.\n\nThe Connecticut Clean Trades Summit was held Thursday at Central Connecticut State University.\n\nThe program introduces construction trade students to careers in the energy industry and the opportunity to make their schools greener.\n\nParticipating schools are Norwich, Ella T. Grasso school in Groton, E.C. Goodwin in New Britain, Platt in Milford and Henry Abbott school in Danbury.\n\nDuring the 2013-2014 school year, teams of 40 to 50 students from each school researched how their school uses energy, assessed water and environmental quality and evaluated recycling efforts. Students proposed energy-saving solutions that will be presented at the meeting.\n\nRibbon cut at Danbury Innovation Center\n\nThe former Union Savings Bank building next to Danbury Library has been transformed into a place where people can gather to exchange ideas and use technology needed to transform their ideas into reality. A cafe, the business counseling group SCORE and the Danbury Hackerspace are all located in the Innovation Center. Danbury Economic Development Director Bruce Tuomala says the City's investment was about $500,000.\n\nTuomala says hard to define a hackerspace because it encompasses so much, but is designed for entrepreneurship, to grow business in the region. There are various membership levels for using the space.\n\nThe cafe can also be accessed by Library patrons.\n\nWestern Connecticut SCORE--a business counseling non-profit--is located in the center, which Tuomala says a great compliment to the Hackerspace. SCORE can help entrepreneurs with business plans and start up companies.\n\nArea organizations slated to receive state bond money\n\nSeveral area projects are set to receive funding from the state when the Bond Commission meets tomorrow. The state Department of Economic and Community Development will provide Cartus with a $6.5 million loan to cover part of the more than $15 million estimated total cost of the expansion project. Cartus will retain 1,275 jobs in Connecticut and create as many as 200 new jobs over five years.\n\nNew Milford-based Neeltran Incorporated will receive $750,000 to match the company's million dollar investment to get new machinery and equipment. The company will create 10 new full time jobs in two years.\n\nThe Danbury War Memorial will also receive funding for a roof replacement project.\n\nFamily of Newtown victim awards first scholarships\n\nNEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) -- The family of a first-grade teacher killed in the 2012 massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School has awarded the first scholarships from a fund set up in her memory.\n\nVictoria Soto's family has been raising money to help students from her hometown of Stratford pursue careers in education.\n\nLast week the Vicki Soto Memorial Fund awarded scholarships of $5,026 to seniors Maggie Bodington from Stratford High School and Emily Mackay of Bunnell High School.\n\nBodington is planning to pursue a degree in education at Eastern Connecticut State University. Mackay plans to study special education and speech pathology at the University of Massachusetts.\n\nRyan Graney, a spokeswoman for the family, says the scholarships include the number 26 to honor all the victims of the shooting.\n\nStuck bridge causes rail delays in Connecticut\n\nNORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- A railroad swing bridge over the Norwalk River became stuck in the open position for five hours Thursday morning, causing major delays for rail travelers in Connecticut.\n\nThe Walk Bridge, which rotates to allow large boats on the river to pass, failed to close just after 4 a.m., said Meredith Daniels, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North Railroad.\n\n\"It's a 117-year old bridge, and they are having problems with the gears and wedges on it,\" she said.\n\nTrains were stopped at various points along the line, and the railroad ran limited shuttle bus service between East Norwalk and South Norwalk, while crews worked to close the bridge.\n\nThe railroad was force to suspend eastbound service from Stamford, while only limited westbound trains were available from South Norwalk, Daniels said. The problem also caused delays on Amtrak, which uses the Metro-North tracks.\n\nThe repairs were completed just before 9 a.m. Delays of more than an hour were reported during the morning rush hour, and normal service was not expected for several hours as trains that had been stopped made their way through the area.\n\nThe swing bridge was built in 1896, and Daniels said it has been the source of problems in the past.\n\n\"Sometimes these things take an hour and a half to fix, sometimes they take hours,\" she said.\n\nIn April, the state applied for $349 million in federal transportation funding to help replace the bridge. The request was part of a $600 million grant request to improve Connecticut's aging rail infrastructure.\n\nAndrew Doba, a spokesman for Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, said in an email Thursday that the governor believes \"federal investment along the entire Northeast rail corridor is long overdue.\"\n\nState Sen. Toni Boucher, the ranking Republican on the legislature's Transportation Committee, criticized Metro-North for reacting to problems \"rather than proactively assessing infrastructure needs on a regular basis.\"\n\nWalnut Hill Rd bridge won't be completed this month\n\nThe Walnut Hill Road bridge in Bethel was anticipated to be opened this week, but weather issues again are forcing the construction to be delayed. First Selectman Matt Knickerbocker says that at a Friday morning conference with the project manager, Department of Transportation engineers and others, the Town was informed that it will not be reopened by the end of the month.\n\nThe ongoing spring rains caused the moisture content in the base material to be too high for compaction, which has to be done before paving. He says about 350 tons of base material still needs to be moved into place.\n\nKnickerbocker did not provide an estimate of when the paving might be able to be completed.\n\nDanbury Westerners donate tarp to City for Rogers Park field\n\nThe Danbury Westerners baseball team has donated $2,900 for an infield tarp. It will cover the infield at Rogers Park. Parks and Rec Director Nick Kaplanis says this will help keep the field playable after periods of heavy rain or bad weather.\n\nThe tarp will be stored at the complex. There is also a roller that will be used to place and remove the tarp from the field.\n\nKaplanis says the Parks Department may be responsible from time to time for putting it on or taking it off depending on when the games are being played or who is playing them. Kaplanis says there's going to have to be some anticipation and watching weather reports. But there will be times when it doesn't have to be on the field for several days.\n\nInformational meeting held about Bethel medical marijuana dispensary\n\nA cancer patient was among the speakers at informational meetings held last night in Bethel about the medical marijuana dispensary planned for Garella Road. The forums were held by D-and-B Wellness--the licensee. A cancer patient spoke about the benefits. A dispensary operator in Rhode Island provided information about crime going down and property values going up.\n\nCompassion and Care Center of Connecticut co-founder Angela D'Amico says this is not like Colorado where pot is used recreationally, this is for patients with debilitating diseases. She cited statistics that show every 19 minutes someone dies in this country from a prescription overdose, but noone has died from a marijuana overdose.\n\nD'Amico says the state registers patients, who aren't allowed to drive a motor vehicle while taking medicinal marijuana and it can't be taken in public. She says most products have no psychological effect, patients won't get high from it. It's meant to treat tremors, Parkinsons, MS and epilepsy.\n\nEverything comes in a sealed pouch, with the strain and number tracked back to the state. They have a security system like a bank.\n\nNo fee for Meckauer Park permit\n\nBethel officials have decided not to charge out of towners $100 for park passes to Meckauer Park. Both residents and nonresidents though will need a permit to access the park in an effort by town officials to monitor usage.\n\nPasses are available free of charge at the Parks and Recreation office on School Street during normal business hours. There will also be a staff member at the park on weekends in June during set hours to distribute passes as well.\n\nThey can be picked up at Meckauer on Saturdays and Sundays from 10am to 3pm.\n\nPetitioning candidate running mate offers $2 per signature\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton's gubernatorial campaign is paying petition circulators $2 for each signature they secure to get his running mate, Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti, onto the Republican primary ballot.\n\nThe Boughton campaign sent an email Tuesday soliciting registered Republicans to gather names. It promises ``$2 per valid unique signature collected plus bonuses and other incentives!''\n\nBoughton teamed up with Lauretti earlier this month after his original running mate, Groton Town Councilor Heather Somers, announced she was running solo for lieutenant governor in the Aug. 12 primary.\n\nThe campaign needs 8,190 signatures by June 10 to get Lauretti on the ballot.\n\nBoughton qualified for the primary by getting more than 15 percent of the vote at this month's party convention.\n\nNewtown lawmakers hold town hall meeting\n\nNewtown residents are being called on to attend a Town Hall meeting tonight with the town's two state Representatives and state Senator. John McKinney, Mitch Bolinsky and Dan Carter will be providing an update on the short session and the issues the dominated the General Assembly's time. The budget was much of the work that was done.\n\nCarter says this is the best ways to communicate what has happened during the session, but also to get feed back from the public.\n\nThe Town Hall meeting at the Newtown Municipal Center is from 6:30 to 8pm.\n\nFlag collection underway across the region\n\nA flag collection is being taken up by local lawmakers and area veterans organizations. Brookfield Representative David Scribner says the community service project promotes importance of the proper display of American flags.\n\nAccording to U.S. Flag Code, when an American flag is so tattered that can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States it should be destroyed in a dignified manner. Worn American flags no longer in service must be properly retired in a dignified and respectful way.\n\nVeteran groups and area lawmakers are hosting flag collections as a community service for the region. The collection time between Memorial Day and Flag Day, June 14th, is not a coincidence. Scribner says this is when people are most likely to display their flags.\n\nThe collections are being done in cooperation with VFW Newtown Post #308, the Joseph W. Tarrent, Jr. Memorial and American Legion Post #100, American Legion Post #60 and the Danbury Council of Veterans.\n\nThe drop off locations are:\n\n100 Pocono Road, Brookfield.\n\nCJH Municipal Center, 1 School Street, Bethel\n\nRedding Town Hall, 100 Hill Road, Redding\n\nMark Twain Library, 439 Redding Road, Redding\n\nEdmond Town Hall, 45 Main Street, Newtown\n\nNewtown Municipal Center, 3 Primrose Street, Newtown\n\nDanbury City Hall, located at 155 Deer Hill Avenue, Danbury\n\nDanbury War Memorial, located at 1 Memorial Drive, Danbury\n\nResidents may also drop flags off at the VFW Post # 308 on Tinkerfield Road. Flags can be dropped off in any condition throughout the year.\n\nMahopac Volunteer FD marks 100 years of service\n\nThe Mahopac Volunteer Fire Department is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The Department collected solicitations last month for a 100th Anniversary Journal being published in July. Earlier this month, they were recognized by the New York General Assembly. State Senator Greg Ball issued a resolution commemorating the century of service.\n\nThe Mahopac Volunteer Fire Department was established in the fall of 1914, after numerous fires caused great concern among the residents of the community.\n\nIn January 1915, the department leased the second floor of the railroad station and converted a donated Ford automobile into a fire-fighting vehicle. During the Great Depression, due in great parts to the selfless efforts and donations of summer vacationers and the citizens of Mahopac. During World War II, the Mahopac Volunteer Fire Department's members bravely served their country as members of the United States Armed Forces.\n\nA new state-of-the-art firehouse was completed in 2007, and dedicated to all members, past, present and future who have devoted their lives to protect the residents of Mahopac, over the past 100 years. After World War II, a new four bay colonial style firehouse was built on Croton Falls Road which serves the Department today.\n\nBall says volunteer fire departments are an integral part of community protection.\n\nAs Mahopac changed from a tourist area to a bedroom community, the Mahopac Volunteer Fire Department continued to fight blazes which destroyed all the old hotels in the area. Today, it continues to update its skills and expertise, while replacing older apparatus with new modern firefighting rigs.\n\nBond money coming to Danbury War Memorial\n\nNearly $1 million is on the state Bond Commission agenda for the Danbury War Memorial. When the group meets on Friday, they are expected to approve $875,000 to support building a new roof. The Danbury War Memorial Association is a non-profit recreational and educational facility, governed by a Board of Managers and Trustees. The War Memorial has served greater Danbury since 1951 in offering recreational and cultural activities to the surrounding communities. The logo over the front door, “To Honor the Dead, to Serve the Living\" states the purpose of the War Memorial which offers a diversified program of indoor activities, a complete fitness center, and a base for community events.\n\nRepresentative David Arconti says he is happy that the state has prioritized this project and that a major improvement is on the way for such an important resource for Danbury. He called it a critical investment for the War Memorial building as it doubles as an emergency shelter.\n\nRepresentative Bob Godfrey says a leaky roof is not something the delegation wants on the building that also serves as Danbury's principal emergency shelter, and the voting place for the 5th ward. Godfrey says he is pleased that both Governor Malloy and Lt Governor Nancy Wyman, who've visited the War Memorial, have heard the needs of its Board of Managers and Trustees.\n\nRepresentative Jan Giegler says it's fitting this announcement comes Memorial Day weekend, when we honor the sacrifice of our veterans, as the War Memorial honors those who gave their lives while also being a gathering place for the community.\n\nRepresentative David Scribner says this restoration project is critical for the future of this building. He added this will make sure it remains a both a place of remembrance and a launch pad of opportunity for residents and organizations for generations to come.\n\nGovernor Dannel Malloy, who chairs the Bond Commission says the War Memorial is a place where we pay tribute to the heroes who, over the course of history, have answered the call to serve and defend our country, our state and the values we hold dear. With that in mind, He says the state is making this investment to preserve this site that demonstrates our appreciation to these men and women and honors their legacy. Malloy says the funding will also ensure the Memorial remains a center of cultural and recreational activity and programming for individuals and families throughout the Greater Danbury community.\n\nMalloy continues commencement address deliveries\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has told Boston College Law School graduates to use what they have learned to ``leave the world a better place than you found it.''\n\nThe first-term Democrat gave the commencement speech Friday at his alma mater. Degrees were presented to 275 law graduates. Fourteen others received advanced degrees.\n\nMalloy told the graduates they have what they need to get through ``whatever life throws at you.''\n\nMalloy graduated Magna Cum Laude from Boston College in 1977, and from its law school in 1980. Malloy met his wife Cathy while both were students there.\n\nMalloy, who's seeking a second term, has made several appearances at commencements in Connecticut.\n\nHe spoke at Southern Connecticut State University's graduate commencement ceremony, at Western Connecticut State University and the University of Bridgeport.\n\nConnecticut delegation seeks VA facilities audits\n\nEAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) Connecticut's congressional delegation wants full details of audits conducted at Veterans Administration medical facilities, including six in the state.\n\nU.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. John Larson, who appeared Friday at an East Hartford VFW post, said they've received private assurances that problems plaguing the VA in other states aren't happening here, but they still want proof.\n\nThe delegation sent a letter to VA Secretary Eric Shinseki asking for the audits, including the accuracy and duration of reported wait times for appointments at the VA's West Haven and Newington campuses, as well as at six clinics in Danbury, New London, Stamford, Waterbury, Willimantic and Winsted.\n\nShinseki recently announced his department would conduct ``face-to-face'' audits amid investigations of VA patients dying while awaiting treatment and falsified appointment records.\n\nBoughton and Lauretti team up for GOP Primary\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Republican gubernatorial candidate and Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton found a new running mate on Friday, joining forces with Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti to raise campaign funds needed to qualify for public financing for the Aug. 12 Republican primary.\n\nThe move came a day after Boughton's first pick for a running mate ended their association.\n\nLauretti told The Associated Press he filed the necessary paperwork Friday to switch from a petitioning candidate for governor to a petitioning candidate for lieutenant governor. Boughton has agreed to help him collect signatures of at least 8,190 registered Republicans by June 10.\n\nMeanwhile, Lauretti said he will help Boughton raise the $250,000 in small contributions needed to qualify for the $1.25 million in public financing for the primary and $6 million for the general election, should he win the primary. Boughton has already raised approximately $160,000.\n\n\"It became a function of time with me,\" Lauretti said, referring to the looming deadline to collect the petition signatures. \"Now I've got Boughton in Danbury helping me with the signatures and I'm helping him with the fundraising.\"\n\nThe decision by Lauretti and Boughton to team up comes after Boughton's original running mate, Groton Town Councilor Heather Somers, announced she was running solo for lieutenant governor in the primary and would not pool her campaign funds with Boughton. State Rep. Penny Bacchiochi won the Republican Party's endorsement for lieutenant governor on Saturday, but Somers and former U.S. Comptroller David Walker each received enough delegate support to qualify for the lieutenant governor primary.\n\nWalker has teamed up with another GOP gubernatorial primary candidate, Senate Minority Leader John McKinney. He filed the necessary paperwork on Friday to run in the lieutenant governor primary.\n\nGreenwich businessman Tom Foley, the party's 2010 gubernatorial candidate, received the party's endorsement for governor. Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy won his party's nomination last weekend to seek a second term.\n\nHeath Fahle, Boughton's campaign spokesman, said the mayor was disappointed by Somers' decision but hinted on Thursday that the campaign had \"an alternative strategy.\" On Friday, he confirmed that Boughton and Lauretti had formed a joint committee. He said paperwork would be filed with the State Elections Enforcement Commission.\n\nFahle said the two mayors have known each other for years.\n\n\"They have a healthy respect for each other because they know what they deal with every day,\" he said.\n\nMunicipal facilities to be connected to the 'Nutmeg Network' internet\n\nA series of grants have been approved to help municipalities with the infrastructure costs associated with connecting their town governments to the state’s Nutmeg Network and extending its availability to include all municipal services.\n\nThe Nutmeg Network is the state's fiber-optic infrastructure that delivers high-speed internet access to its members and is already offered in schools, libraries and emergency services facilities.\n\nExtended use of the network was an initiative developed from Speaker of the House Brendan Sharkey’s MORE, Municipal Opportunities and Regional Efficiencies, Commission.\n\nGovernor Malloy said that his administration intends on carrying out a second round of grants next year; application information will be forthcoming in the next few months.\n\nThe following municipalities are among those receiving funding:\n\nBrookfield\n\nTown Hall\n\n100 Pocono Road\n\n$20,600.00\n\nNew Fairfield\n\nTown Hall\n\n4 Brush Hill Road\n\n$19,900.00\n\nNewtown\n\nMunicipal Center\n\n3 Primrose Street\n\n$55,080.00\n\nRedding\n\nTown Hall\n\n100 Hill Road\n\n$19,900.00\n\nRidgefield\n\nTown Hall\n\n400 Main Street\n\n$16,700.00\n\nSouthbury\n\nTown Hall\n\n501 Main Street South\n\n$19,900.00\n\nWoodbury\n\nSenior Center\n\n281 Main Street South\n\n$19,900.00\n\nMonroe company receives grant from NASA for research\n\nNASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has awarded six Connecticut companies contracts valued at $125,000 each to conduct feasibility studies that could lead to advances in space exploration and aerospace technology. A Monroe company is among those to receive support from Connecticut Innovations through the organization’s grant, loan, equity and talent programs.\n\nMaterials Technologies Corporation of Monroe has corporate and government clients including Silicon Valley Group, Union Carbide/UOP and Black & Decker. Their contracts with NASA are for Marshall Space Flight Center, Goddard Space Flight Center and Glenn Research Center.\n\nThe companies are being tasked to conduct a number of different areas of research, from developing high pressure oxygen generation systems for future space exploration missions to energy-efficient carbon dioxide storage systems.\n\nNew fairfield airman's named added to Wall of Honor\n\nState officials have held the annual Wall of Honor ceremony at the state capital Thursday. The wall holds 65 photos of service men and women killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The latest name added, Air Force Staff Sgt. Todd Lobraico of New Fairfield, was killed at the age of 22 last September.\n\nLt Governor Nancy Wyman, who helped start the Wall in 2007, hopes each year that no new names have to be added. She says it's incumbent upon all of us to live in service of their sacrifice and recall in our everyday actions what it means to be an American. Wyman says the Wall of Honor is a very special tribute to some of this country’s most dedicated protectors.\n\nWyman was joined by Governor Dannel Malloy, Veterans Affairs Commissioner Linda Schwartz, Major General Thad Martin, state officials, and military families to recognize the Connecticut service men and women on the Wall of Honor who were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the terrorist attacks in 2001.\n\nMalloy says Connecticut’s Wall of Honor is an important part of the history and future of this state. He says this wall gives Connecticut residents a place to go to remember the men and women who are not returning from battle, and reflect on the significance of their sacrifice.\n\nAppeal filed, informational planned about medical marijuana dispensary in Bethel\n\nAn appeal has been filed with the Bethel Zoning Board of Appeals about the medical marijuana dispensary approved by the Planning Director for Garella Road in the Stony Hill section of town. Two nearby residents said D & B Wellness should not have been approved as a retail use establishment. The Monroe-based company received approval last week and is one of only six dispensaries licensed in the state. The location is zoned for retail use and town officials say the dispensary is considered a pharmacy and therefore a permitted use.\n\nThe appeal says the state imposes specific location and operation critera on dispensaries that are different from retail mandates, because the general public will not be patronizing the facility. The Zonnig Appeals Board next meets in June.\n\nD & B Wellness is hosting two informational session next week about their facility and medical marijuana. They will be in the General Purpose Room of the Municipal Center Tuesday from 4:30 to 6pm and from 6 to 9pm.\n\nD&B Welness's application was denied last month by the Bridgeport Planning and Zoning Commission. That followed Stratford's decision to put a 12 month moratorium on dispensaries in that town. An incomplete application was filed with Redding Zoning officials and not in time for the only meeting before a deadline to find a location before the license expired.\n\nThe plans call for a high level of security and to be operated as an \"appointment only\" facility and would employ a pharmacist, receptionist and a counselor to educate patients about dosage and alternative therapies.

Western has signed a reverse transfer credit program with Housatonic, Norwalk and Naugatuck Valley Community Colleges. Vice President for Academic Affairs Dr Jane Gates says if those students earn a total 60 credits, they will be awarded an Associated Degree from the community college they transferred to Western from.\n\nGates says if a student has an associate degree, a bachelor degree doesn't seem as daunting. She adds that the Associate degree will help students get better jobs. Gates says this is especially important for first generation college attendees in their families.\n\nNaugatuck Valley previously signed a reverse transfer agreement with Charter Oak State College, the state's online college.\n\nGates says these agreements will increase the graduation rates for the community colleges and will increase the likelihood of a student continuing at Western to earn a bachelor degree. Credits will be tracked by Western's Registrar's Office to determine when the credits have been accumulated.\n\nUS announces changes for tribal recognition rules\n\nThe U-S Interior Department has announced proposed changes to the rules for granting federal recognition to American Indian tribes. The rules announced yesterday include a requirement that tribes demonstrate political authority since 1934. Previously, they had to show continuity from \"historical times'', 1789.\n\nThis could open the door for recognition of one faction of the Kent-based Scaghticoke Tribe and two others in the state.\n\nCritics, including 5th District Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty argued it would lower the threshold for recognition which could lead to new gaming facilities in the state. 4th District Congressman Jim Himes says he believes additional changes and clarifications are necessary to ensure that Connecticut’s interests are protected, and he and others will continue to work for their inclusion\n\nKevin Washburn, an assistant secretary with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, said the new rules are intended to make the process more transparent and efficient. He said the standards are no less rigorous.\n\nThe government is accepting more comment before the rules are finalized.\n\nBoughton's running mate says she's running solo\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) Groton town councilor Heather Somers says she's running for lieutenant governor on her own and won't pool her campaign funds with Republican gubernatorial candidate and Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton.\n\nSomers announced Thursday she was entering the GOP primary and seeking public financing on her own.\n\nWhile state Rep. Penny Bacchiochi won the endorsement for lieutenant governor, Somers and David Walker received enough delegate support to qualify for the Aug. 12 primary.\n\nIt's unclear how much of a financial blow this means for Boughton, who must raise $250,000 in small contributions to qualify for $1.25 million for the primary and $6 million for the general election. A message was left seeking comment with Boughton's campaign.\n\nBoughton and Senate Minority Leader John McKinney filed paperwork Thursday to run in the gubernatorial primary.\n\nChronic illness bill awaits Gov.'s signature\n\nA bill co-sponsored by several Danbury area lawmakers on Wednesday was sent to the Governor's desk for his signature.

The difference from the 2011 proposal is that now, the granddaughter of the woman who donated the land to the City in 1968 has granted a partial waiver on the deed restrictions imposed on the City to allow for construction of a cell tower.\n\nThe Planning Commission held a meeting last night about the plan and an ad hoc committee of the City Council will meet tonight about it.\n\nThe Richter Park Authority feels that revenue from a cell tower would allow them to move forward on projects for the Park laid out in the 2008 Master Plan. The deed restricted use of the property to recreational purposes only. The Master Plan calls for improving hiking trails and tennis facilities and to reconfigure the golf course to make room for a driving range.\n\nSTEAP funding for Ridgefield moves Streetscape Project forward\n\nOn the heels of announcing funding from a pilot program to install centerline rumble strips on state roads, State Representative John Frey touted more funding for Ridgefield. The town is receiving $500,000 in grants from the Small Town Economic Assistance Program to continue the Danbury Road Streetscape Project and to begin work on exterior improvements to Town Hall.\n\nThe Project is currently in its third phase, and has been paid for with only STEAP funds.

Bolisnky co-sponsored the bill.\n\nThe bill expands sexual assault policies at all college campuses in Connecticut byrequiring colleges to immediately provide victims of sexual assault with supportive information regarding their rights and options and allowing any victims of sexual assault to report the crime anonymously. The legislation would require colleges to establish sexual response teams and partner with local sexual assault service providers to enhance the level of care given to victims and to report information annually on sexual assault policies and details of sexual assault cases to the state legislature for review.\n\nThe new law also mandates that colleges and universities treat stalking in the same manner.\n\nBolinsky says colleges need to be safe and trusting environments for students. He says sexual violence of any kind should have a zero-tolerance in schools. He cited statistics from the Higher Education Committee that one in five women on college campuses suffers assaults, and just 20 percent of assaults are being reported.\n\nSexual violence on campuses made headlines when University of Connecticut students this year testified before legislators stating that school officials weren't helpful when they reported crimes.\n\nFather of Newtown victim praises New York gun law\n\nMELVILLE, N.Y. (AP) The father of a 7-year-old boy killed at the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, has praised New York's new gun control law at the state Democratic convention.\n\nMark Barden told Democrats Wednesday gun responsibility is a matter of public safety and shouldn't be caught up in politics.\n\nBarden's son Daniel was among 20 students and six educators killed in the 2012 school massacre.\n\nGun control has become a contentious issue in New York following the passage of the SAFE Act, which bans the sale of some semi-automatic weapons and requires people who already own them to register with authorities.\n\nThe law was championed by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The law's repeal is supported by Cuomo's Republican opponent this fall, Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino.\n\nBethel state Reps. to hold town hall meeting\n\nBethel residents are being called on to attend a Town Hall meeting tonight with the town's two state Representatives.

The Town Hall meeting at the Stony Hill Volunteer Fire Department is from 6:30 to 8pm.\n\nBethel budget fails on ballot recount\n\nA hand recount of Bethel budget ballots has been held, the municipal budget failed by 7 votes. There was a three vote difference on Thursday when polls closed on the municipal tax and spending plan approving it. The education budget is $42 million. The municipal budget was $27 million and included $3.84 million in debt service and the school's $540,000 building maintenance account.\n\nThere's also just over $2 million in capital expenses that was approved including $50,000 for a study of the Municipal Center gym. The capital items also includes $96,000 for the Parks and Recreation Department for a tractor, a replacement truck and the Meckauer Park garage.\n\nFirst Selectman Matt Knickerbocker says he was disappointed with voter turnout. He, like other chief elected officials, wants to see more participation in the process. He adds that the close vote sent a strong message that Bethel residents want to see more spending controls put in place.\n\nThe education budget and capital expenditures stand as is. The municipal budget goes back to the Board of Finance. Knickerbocker says he hopes they take out the spending not included in the Board of Selectmen's budget recommendation that they added after.\n\nBrookfield budget vote today\n\nBrookfield residents are at the polls today to vote on a budget for the coming fiscal year. The proposed $38.5 million education budget and the $21.9 million municipal budget will be separate votes, but both need to pass or it will go to a second referendum.\n\nThere was a contentious town meeting about the budget with an argument breaking out in the lobby and police arriving. Much of the disagreement at the meeting was over what residents saw as too little funding for the schools.\n\nAlso on the agenda last night were two capital items; a little more than $1 million for equipment and projects around town and also nearly $2.5 million for the Still River Greenway project.\n\nBoth the High School and Huckleberry Hill Elementary School polls are open until 8pm.\n\nNVCC's Danbury Cetner now an accredited degree campus\n\nNaugatuck Valley Community College Danbury Campus has officially been recognized as a campus by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. More than a thousand students attend the center each semester.\n\nLast May, the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education approved NVCC's proposal to offer credit certificates and degrees in Danbury. Last Monday, the accrediting body told NVCC that the application to become a full service campus was accepted.\n\nNVCC officials say the college continues to make progress on its search for larger space in Danbury, which they hope to have by the fall with relocation of the campus next spring. Right now the campus is on Main Street.\n\nClean water bill to aid Greater Danbury area ratepayers signed into law\n\nA bill to lower the cost of becoming compliant with new state and federal environmental regulations has been signed into law by the Governor. Danbury Representative David Arconti says the bill levels the playing field for municipalities seeking funding from the Clean Water Fund for phosphorous reducing water pollution control projects.\n\nLast year, the first three cities to apply would be covered at 50-percent. Arconti says now all contracts will be covered at 50-percent.\n\nIt would have cost close to $60-million to renovate the Danbury Wastewater Treatment Plant, which would impact ratepayers in Bethel, Brookfield, Newtown and Ridgefield as well. The bill was also co-sponsored by Cecilia Buck-Taylor of New Milford, Dan Carter of Bethel, Mike McLachlan of Danbury and John Shaban of Redding.\n\nEnery cost savings on $11 million project to be presented to Danbury officials\n\nThe Honeywell Energy Performance Contracting Project done at schools across Danbury is showing cost savings, but the City Council wants the numbers.\n\nRight now the schools have one public utilities account, but dividing natural gas and utility counts will be in the Board of Education's budget next year. Honeywell does an analysis for the Board of Education and Finance Director Joe Martino says a breakdown of all the schools boiler replacement energy cost savings will be done.\n\nThe original $4-million of work proposed in 2010 included boilers for Danbury High School, Broadview Middle, Stadley Rough, King Street Intermediate and Primary along with Mill Ridge Primary schools. The following year another $7-million in work was approved to include steam trap replacements at Park Avenue School, more boiler replacements at Mill Ridge Intermediate, new windows at the High School and asbestos abatement.\n\nMartino says the cost savings, particularly at the High School, is significant because of the conversion from oil to natural gas.\n\nHe hopes to break down the numbers by degree days. He notes this brutal winter means just looking at the utility bills for actual usage, it won't be an apples to apples comparison.\n\n'Muddy riders' to come through Newtown, Danbury on way to DC\n\nMore than 115 so-called \"Muddy Angels” bicycle riders are expected to convene at Danbury Hospital as they journey from Boston via Newtown and Danbury to Washington D-C.

They say they are concerned the benefits would strain budgets and lead to frivolous claims.\n\n\"We support and appreciate the efforts of our police and firefighters, but there's a concern when you expand benefits,\" said Betsy Gara, executive director of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns.\n\nLegislation has been emotional in that state, still haunted by the December 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.\n\nNewtown police officer Thomas Bean told lawmakers his depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts left him unable to work. \"I'm always being re-traumatized because I don't know what my future is,\" Bean testified in March.\n\nConnecticut allows police and firefighters to collect workers' compensation if they use deadly force or witness a colleague's death. New legislation would expand it to all municipal employees diagnosed with PTSD after witnessing a violent event or its aftermaths.\n\nFederal employees and military members can collect compensation if a psychiatrist finds PTSD symptoms. But most states require officers and firefighters to have an accompanying physical injury.\n\nSupporters say lawmakers' efforts to change that are encouraging, but the push-back shows a stigma remains.\n\n\"They don't get too worked up when an officer gets shot or physically assaulted because they can see it,\" Clark said. \"If you think every cop is just going to run to that lifeboat and say, `I have PTSD,' I just don't see it.\"\n\nIt is hard to say how many officers suffer symptoms because many do not come forward for fear of seeming weak, Clark said.\n\n'Touch A Truck' event comes to Danbury Sunday\n\nTrucks and other vehicles will be in the Danbury High School parking lot Sunday for a Touch-A-Truck event. Congregation B'Nai Israel Vice President Kennis Koldewyn says children can climb into the vehicles, honk horns and discover everything there is to at least 15 different types of vehicles. There will be an ambulance, motorcycle, peapod delivery truck and a mobile classroom among others.\n\nKoldewine says this can be an educational family day and lead to an interesting discussion about roads and professions, noting that kids learn through exploration and hands on experiences.\n\nThere will be a horn-free hour. There will be refreshments, crafts and other entertainment.\n\nAdmission: $6/child, $10/two children, $15/family with three or more children. Children under 2 years of age are free. The event is rain or shine from 11am to 3pm. Quite hour is from 10am to 11am.\n\nDanbury area lawmaker endorsed for 7th term\n\nRepublican State Representative Jan Giegler will be seeking another term serving the 138th House District. She was endorsed Wednesday night by delegate for the multi-town district made up of parts of Danbury, New Fairfield and Ridgefield.\n\nShe has just completed her 6th term and is a ranking member of the Public Safety and Security Committee as well as an Assistant Republican Leader.

He added that he's proud to support her once more.\n\nMetro North making progress on safety upgrades\n\nMetro North is providing an update on safety reforms enacted since a fatal derailment in December. The reforms address factors identified during several serious safety incidents over the last year, as well as issues identified by an in-depth Federal Railroad Administration review of its operating practices that took place this past winter.\n\nA review analyzing Metro-North’s safety-related processes and procedures, its compliance with safety regulations and requirements, and its overall safety culture resulted in a report with 27 actions to be taken.

There is also a preloaded iPad with autism apps that can be used in the center.\n\n(Photo from Autismspeaks.org)\n\nMedical marijuana dispensary coming to Stony Hill\n\nA medical marijuana dispensary is coming to the Stony Hill section of Bethel. The application by D&B Wellness, one of the six medical marijuana producers to receive state approval, was denied last month by the Bridgeport Planning and Zoning Commission. That followed Stratford's decision to put a 12 month moratorium on dispensaries in that town. An incomplete application was filed with Redding Zoning officials this week and not in time for the meeting Wednesday night.\n\nState Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner William Rubenstein says the license was approved Tuesday for 4 Garella Road. The location is zoned for retail use and town officials say the dispensary is considered a pharmacy and therefore a permitted use.\n\nThe plans call for a high level of security and to be operated as an \"appointment only\" facility and would employ a pharmacist, receptionist and a counselor to educate patients about dosage and alternative therapies. There will also be a full time security guard. Video surveillance and other security features will be in place.\n\nOnly patients certified by physicians to the department as having one of 11 debilitating conditions and would benefit from use of medical marijuana can register for use of medical marijuana in Connecticut.\n\nThe kinds of products that can be sold at dispensaries are very specific and is limited to those prepackaged from licensed manufacturers.

The state Department of Education has held its second annual Schools of Distinction Recognition Breakfast. 73 schools were honored yesterday.\n\nThe recognition is part of the state's school rating and accountability system, which the U-S Department of Education approved in 2012 as part of the Connecticut request for flexibility in meeting certain portions of the federal No Child Left Behind act.\n\nAmong the highest overall performance schools are: Anna H Rockwell elementary school in Bethel, John Read Middle School in Redding, Monroe Elementary School and Masuk High School. The Burnham School in Bridgewater, East Ridge Middle School in Ridgefield, Weston High School, Cider Mill and Middlebrook Schools in Wilton also made the list.\n\nDuring the breakfast Commission Stefan Pryor also announced a new competitive grant opportunity for those schools to share information on what works best for turning around school performance.\n\nThe highest performing schools in the subcategory of students with disabilities including Wilton High School.

Current law requires APRNs to work in collaboration with a physician.\n\nMalloy says he will sign the bill, saying it will increase access to health care, especially for the thousands of newly insured.\n\nBut the Connecticut State Medical Society voiced disappointment with the bill. The physicians criticized it for having little detail about the three-year collaboration, educational requirements or oversight of the APRN practices.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 110-35 in favor of the legislation. Among those opposed in the House were Mitch Bolinsky of Newtown, Cecilia Buck-Taylor of New Milford, Dan Carter of Bethel, Gail Lavielle of Wilton, David Scribner of Brookfield and Redding Representative John Shaban.\n\nCarter says currently there is oversight, but he worries there won't be proper training in the future.

In her letter, she said that if Catherine was fortunate enough to catch a butterfly she would whisper to it to tell its friends that she was kind and gently nudge it to fly away. But her mom says Catherine's whisper was silenced on December 14th. Jenny says the Sanctuary will enrich the lives of all beings by promoting compassion , acceptance and determination. Programs will focus on cat and dog rescue and adoption, farm animal refuge, native wildlife rehabilitation, agricultural preserve and humane education and nature based workshops. The workshops could include Jane Goodall's \"Roots and Shoots\", a community garden and plow-to-table instruction.

He says the lack of funding could hurt youths.\n\nVeteran Tom Winkler says on more than one occasion the War Memorial hosted going away and welcome home events for various units deploying into combat without any request for reimbursement.\n\nRon Struski says the War Memorial is also an emergency shelter and polling place for the City, which cuts into their funding when they have to close to serve those needs. Over that past years, funding has gone from $175,000 to the current $50,000.

Newtown Representative DebraLee Hovey says a bill to put an extra tax on violent video games would be like the sin tax on cigarettes.\n\nHovey says making it harder to buy a gun is only one step to reduce violence. She is calling for a cultural change to be done through less controversial steps, like warning lables on violent games with a MATURE rating.
