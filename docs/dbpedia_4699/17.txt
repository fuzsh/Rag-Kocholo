DescriptionThis portrait was created in response to a limited competition for a commission of Kathleen Clarke by Dublin City Council to hang in City Hall. Kathleen Clarke (1878 – 1972) was a founder member of Cumann na mBan, a women's republican paramilitary organisation formed in Ireland in 1914, and was one of very few people with advance knowledge of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule. She was the wife of Tom Clarke and sister of Ned Daly, both of whom were executed for their part in the Rising. She was subsequently a Teachta Dála (TD, a member of the Irish Parliament) and a Senator with both Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil, and the first female Lord Mayor of Dublin (1939–1941).
