Each Senator featured in this exhibition was a political, social or economic changemaker in Ireland over the course of the last 100 years. They championed issues or causes that were often less visible or important to the mainstream political system and used their position to advocate for change.

Over the last 100 years this transitioned into voices representing other minority communities and minority opinions, often leading to major change in our country.

I hope you will agree with me that the exhibition reminds us how much impact an individual can have in championing minority communities and minority causes by harnessing the power of being a member of Seanad Éireann in our national parliament. It is an honour and one that those Senators exhibited, and many others seized upon.

‘Minority Voices, Major Changes’ is both the theme of this exhibition and of the wider Seanad100 centenary programme and I would encourage you to explore the various outreach initiatives running throughout the year ahead.

Finally, may I extend my thanks to everyone who is contributing to Seanad100 and the marking of this important milestone for our parliament.

Kathleen Clarke (1878-1972)

Kathleen Clarke was a Republican activist who served as vice-president of Cumann na mBan.

She was imprisoned after the 1916 Rising and her husband Tom Clarke and brother Edward Daly were executed.

Elected to the Dáil in 1921, she voted against the Treaty.

Nominated to the First Seanad in 1928 as Fianna Fáil member, she argued against a section in the Conditions of Employment Bill 1935 which precluded women from taking position in certain industries. Clarke refused to accept the consensus that “equal pay for equal work” would lead to driving down of men’s wages.

In 1939 she became the first woman Lord Mayor of Dublin.

He consistently highlighted the deterioration of Ireland’s public finances, arguing against what he saw as public spending spiralling out of control and advocated informing the public on the state of the economy. Nominated to the Seanad by the Taoiseach, he served from 1977 to 1982.

By his own description, his cautionary approach was viewed as “undermining public confidence” by some of his fellow Senators.

During his time in the Seanad, he spoke frequently and at length on debates on the economy, campaigned for Ireland to join the EEC and argued against tax allowances which he declared “the subsidy to better-off section of the community indicates the extent to which we are dominated by the middle-class thinking in this respect, to the exclusion of any proper social approach to these matters”.

During a debate on Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 1987 he stated: “Every Minister is going to hate me because I will keep on chipping away with my hammer and chisel until the system begins to understand that we have a country which is nothing short of a jewel and we do not really understand what we have and what we stand to lose”.

In the Seanad, she consistently highlighted the situation in Northern Ireland.

She was a member of the Seanad from 1938 to 1968. She passionately argued against cuts in funding for the Irish language in schools in 1949: “I am afraid all this is having a bad effect on the ordinary people, who begin to think that Irish does not matter”.

Despite admitting that her Irish was barely conversational, she consistently debated for more visibility and funding for the language which she saw as a fundamental part of national identity.

He was a member of the Seanad from 1922 to 1928.

During his time in the Seanad, he was a frequent contributor to debates, ranging from tabling a motion on returning paintings from the Hugh Lane collection from England back to Ireland to objecting to the use of Irish language in parliamentary proceedings: “Would I be in order in moving as an amendment that the prayer be read in Irish as soon as the majority of the members of the Seanad know Irish?”
