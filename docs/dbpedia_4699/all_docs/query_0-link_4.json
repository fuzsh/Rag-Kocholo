        "text": "100 years ago six women were elected to the 2nd Dail. In 2021 there are 37 women elected.\n\nIn 1919 Countess Markievicz was the first woman to be appointed as a Minister in Europe and only the second woman in the world to hold a cabinet position. When the 2nd Dail met in 1921 her Labour Ministry was downgraded and so she did not have a seat at the Cabinet table. It took another 60 years before Ireland appointed Maire Geoghan Quinn as a cabinet Minister in 1979.\n\nSince 1919 only 22 women have been appointed Ministers in Ireland. There has never been a woman nominated as Taoiseach and no Finance Minister has ever been a woman despite imminently qualified female TDs since the formation of the state.\n\nThere are 31 more women elected to the Dail in 2021 compared with 1921. Notably there is only one more woman representing the province of Munster than when three women from Cork, Waterford and Limerick were elected to 2nd Dail in 1921. A century later and Limerick city and county currently has no woman representative in the Dail despite leading the way when Kathleen O’Callaghan was elected to the 2nd Dail in 1921.\n\nSince 1919, only 131 women have ever been elected to serve in Dail Eireann. Nan Joyce was the first Traveller woman to run for election in 1982, but no Traveller woman has ever been elected to local or national government.\n\nIn 2021 with only 23% of TDs being women, the century old movement to achieve equal representation needs more women in all their diversity to address the persistent democratic deficit of women in Irish politics.\n\nSince the establishment of the first Dáil in 1919, women have made the uphill climb to have their voices heard in politics. Over 100 years later, this struggle continues as we strive for full gender equality across the political system. Although there is still work to be done, as we help to lead the charge to 50/50 we do this on the shoulders of thousands of women who have been active in political life for centuries."
