        "text": "Goodbye\n\nThat's a wrap for our rolling coverage of the 2024 General Election.\n\nYou can keep up to date with any further political developments and reaction on our website.\n\nAnd there'll be further coverage on BBC Radio Ulster and on BBC Newsline later.\n\nBut, for now, from all the live page team, goodbye.\n\nAdditional reporting by Amy Stewart, Jake Wood, Hannah Gay, Hayley Halpin, Rebekah Wilson, Jess Lawrence, Ashleigh Swan, Mike McBride and Faye Kidd.\n\nDramatic storylines and remarkable result\n\nJayne McCormack\n\nBBC News NI political correspondent\n\nAs elections go this one has brought about one of the most dramatic storylines in decades.\n\nWhen Ian Paisley entered the count centre in Magherafelt his silence spoke volume as word spread that North Antrim, a seat belonging to the Paisley family since 1970, had fallen to the DUP's arch unionist opponent Jim Allister of the TUV.\n\nMr Allister said it was a reality check for the DUP and it certainly was a plot twist nobody saw coming.\n\nJoining him on the green benches is the first Ulster Unionist MP in seven years as Robin Swann snatched victory from the DUP in South Antrim.\n\nAnd the loss of another DUP stronghold to Alliance will also bring hurt - Sorcha Eastwood is now the MP for Lagan Valley.\n\nBut it was a case of win one, lose one, for Alliance as independent unionist Alex Easton outpolled the party's deputy leader Stephen Farry.\n\nSinn FÃ©in struck lucky too, it's now overtaken the DUP as the largest party at Westminster.\n\nThe SDLP kept both its seats from the last mandate.\n\nIt was just before 08:00 when the last seat was declared in East Londonderry where, despite a full recount, Gregory Campbell hung on for the DUP by just 179 votes - another shock.\n\nWith the counts packed up for another few years, that leaves plenty of time to unpick some truly remarkable results.\n\nIt's not been a terrible election for unionism - Cairns\n\nTim Cairns suggests that after a number of years, people want change.\n\nâWeâre seeing with the Tories across the water, 14 years in power, people want change,â he says. âThere's a sense in that in a local level as well.â\n\nThe former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) special adviser says: \"It may have been a bad election for the DUP, overall, and I think Gavin [Robinson] holding on in East Belfast â¦ probably just about keeps the DUP buoyed.\n\nâHowever, I think for unionism as a whole itâs not been a terrible election.â\n\nElection results shows politics is 'increasingly fragmented'\n\nFormer taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar says the UK election result was a \"phenomenal\" one for Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nHowever, he says it shows \"real evidence\" that voters are more volatile and that politics is increasingly fragmented.\n\nSpeaking to RTÃ News, Mr Varadkar says Sir Keir's vote in his own constituency was half what it was five or 10 years ago. He says the drop in the Conservative vote has allowed Labour and the Liberal Democrats to gain a huge numbers of seats.\n\n\"Where does it leave us in 2029? I don't know. The Reform Party... has suddenly won four million votes in an election and that's not to be ignored,\" he says.\n\n\"Two million people voted Green, and most voted Green in places where they couldn't even possibly win but they still did, so there's real fragmentation there,\" Mr Varadkar says.\n\nHe says that people \"will say this result means that the Labour Party is going to be in government in Britain for 10 or 15 years\".\n\nSinn FÃ©in now fifth-largest party at Westminster\n\nSinn FÃ©in is now not just the largest NI party at Westminster; itâs the fifth largest party across the UK.\n\nItâs not by virtue of winning any more seats â theyâve stayed steady on seven â but because the DUP lost their spot.\n\nAfter the last general election in 2019, the DUP had eight seats. But now they have five, and fall under âotherâ on the BBCâs election banner.\n\nReform UK didnât get the 13 seats predicted by the exit poll; with just four seats, theyâre in the âothersâ bucket too.\n\nIt means viewers in GB will see more of the Sinn FÃ©in name than they might have seen before.\n\nGoogle searches for âSFâ spiked at 5 this morning, external, driven mostly by English googlers.\n\nYou can read more in our colleague Brendan Hughesâs summary of the night.\n\n'An opportunity to step up activity on north-south issues' - Bertie Ahern\n\nFormer taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Bertie Ahern says he hopes the change in government will lead to an increase in meetings between the prime minister and taoiseach.\n\nMr Ahern told RTÃâs Today with Claire Byrne programme, external he believes the \"whole relationship has been lost in the last seven or eight yearsâ.\n\nAdding that he would âlove to see a meeting of the inter-governmental council and then regular meetings between the British prime minister with the Taoiseachâ.\n\nThe British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) met in April for the first time since power-sharing at Stormont returned earlier this year.\n\n\"There's also an opportunity now to step up activity on north-south issues because that has been fairly damaged as well for the last few years. There was no meetings when the institutions weren't there,â Mr Ahern added.\n\n'A reset is required'\n\nThe Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NI Chamber) says a âreset is requiredâ, adding it is ready to work with the new MPs and the incoming government.\n\n\"Our members report that rising costs, skills shortages and infrastructure gaps are contributing to a challenging trading environment, so a reset is required,â NI Chamber chief executive, Suzanne Wylie, says.\n\nâIt is imperative that the new UK government plays its part in those policy, funding and legislative interventions which will enable growth here.\n\nShe says the government needs to âget to work quickly, working closely with business to understand Northern Ireland's unique challenges and strengths so they can help the region double down on its many areas of successâ.\n\nAn opportunity for small businesses?\n\nThe results of the general election âgives hope that political stability can lead to economic stability and recoveryâ, Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) says.\n\n\"There's a golden chance in the first 100 days of this new administration to plant the seeds of small business growth, and there are a range of policies FSB hopes the new government will bring forward,â Ms McKenzie says.\n\nShe says these include measures to ease the cost of doing business and support investment and expansion.\n\n\"The upcoming King's Speech should include a Small Business Bill to enshrine in legislation much-needed changes to better support small firms and the self-employed,â Ms McKenzie says.\n\n\"Supporting and growing small businesses is good for jobs, good for communities in all parts of the country, and good for the whole economy.â"
