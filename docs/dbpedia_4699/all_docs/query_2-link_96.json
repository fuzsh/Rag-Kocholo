Here, Kevin Doyle and Fionnán Sheahan discuss the prospect.\n\nThe Coalition is facing a by-election headache with the possibility of up to six TDs leaving the Dáil in the coming weeks. If Taoiseach Simon Harris is genuine in his insistence that the general election will not be until 2025, he will be forced to hold multiple by-elections before Christmas. More here:\n\nAnalysis: Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael neck-and-neck but a disastrous result for Sinn Féin As dust settles, it looks like Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil couldn't be closer in both local and European elections. Fianna Fáil’s Cynthia Ní Mhurchú is on course to nick a Fine Gael seat in Ireland South. But Fine Gael sources now believe they can get Nina Carberry and Maria Walsh over the line in Midlands North-West. That would put both parties on four EU seats each. Both parties have made mistakes though. By picking a Cork-based running mate for Fine Gael MEP Sean Kelly, rather than somebody from Leinster, Fine Gael has missed an opportunity to be in the running for a second seat in Ireland South. And, by splitting their vote in Midlands North-West across three candidates, Fianna Fáil has absolutely wasted an opportunity to take two seats. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin is in serious trouble in Midlands North-West Their sitting MEP, Chris McManus, is totally out of contention and his transfer won’t be enough to get Michelle Gildernew into play either. Disastrous result. Kevin Doyle\n\nMidlands North-West Luke 'Ming' Flanagan looks set to return to Brussels after topping the poll in the first count in the Midlands North-West constituency. Meanwhile, just 20 votes separate Barry Cowen (Fianna Fáil) and Nina Carberry (Fine Gael), who has outpolled Maria Walsh (Fine Gael). Mr Flanagan received 78,214 first preference votes. He was followed by Fianna Fáil candidate Barry Cowen at 73,908 votes, and Fine Gael candidates Nina Carberry and incumbent Maria Walsh at 73,888 and 71,476 votes respectively. Former RTÉ correspondent Ciaran Mullooly (Independent Ireland) was in fifth place with 57,297 votes. Sinn Féin candidate Michelle Gildernew was in sixth with 45,807 votes. No candidate was deemed elected as the quota for election is 113,325 and counting of ballots continues. While it seems certain after the first count in Castlebar that Independent MEP Mr Flanagan will get a seat, there is definitely one Fine Gael seat and one Fianna Fáil seat. After that, Fine Gael will be fighting for a second seat, with Ciaran Mullooly and Michelle Gildernew. Notably, Fianna Fáil has the most votes overall but by splitting them between three candidates, they may have ruined their chances of a second seat. There are a total of 27 candidates fighting for five seats in the massive electoral region which spans 15 counties. Other hopefuls include Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín and unsuccessful presidential election candidate and entrepreneur Peter Casey – who are in 8th and 11th place respectively. Fianna Fáil’s campaign in the constituency has been marred by infighting, as border region hopeful Niall Blaney accused the party leadership of throwing him and Lisa Chambers “overboard” in favour of Mr Cowen, who brings strong name recognition to the table. Mr Blaney placed ninth with 30,387 votes. Mr Mullooly, who would have been tasked with covering several election counts throughout his career with RTÉ News, said he had deliberately avoided the count centre until Monday evening. The Independent Ireland candidate, who said he was nervously waiting to see if transfers could secure him a seat, added: “I hate counts, I hate election counts. I have done for years.” Quota: 113,325 Seats: 5 Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan (Ind) – 78,214 Barry Cowen (FF) – 73,908 Nina Carberry (FG) - 73,888 Maria Walsh (FG) – 71,476 Ciaran Mullooly (Ind Ire) – 57,297 Michelle Gildernew (SF) – 45,807 Lisa Chamber (FF) – 44,069 Peadar Toibin (Aontu) – 40,742 Niall Blaney (FF) – 30,387 Chris McManus (SF) – 29,427 Peter Casey (Ind) – 21,102 Eavan Murray and Kevin Doyle\n\nEuropean Elections - Ireland South: MEP Sean Kelly tops the poll Fine Gael's Sean Kelly has topped the poll in the Ireland South constituency with 122,777 votes, surpassing the quota of 114,761. He has won his fourth time as an MEP, having been first elected in 2009. The former GAA president celebrated the news with family in the Nemo Rangers GAA Club count centre, where he was also on grandfather duty. Outgoing Fianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher is also set to be returned to the European Parliament with a first preference vote of 91,074. He is expected to be elected after several counts tomorrow. Clare-based Independent Michael McNamara is poised to clinch a Euro berth after a strong first count of 56,339 votes. The final two seats are expected to be decided in a tight battle between five candidates. Mr Kelleher will be elected on transfers over the early counts - with a remarkable aspect of the Ireland South count being the heavy level of transfers between the top Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil candidates. Political analysts said it was \"extraordinary\" that Mr Kelly and Mr Kelleher were, in certain ballot boxes, transferring better to each other than to their running mates. \"Fianna Fáil will remain as the largest party of local government\" - director of elections Jack Chambers It comes as Fianna Fáil edges ahead of Fine Gael in the race to be the largest party local government. Fianna Fáil Director of Elections Jack Chambers said he is confident the party will remain the largest in local government when all the votes are counted. Fine Gael said earlier today it had the largest number of first preference votes in the local elections. “As Director of Elections, I have been reviewing the counts and seat numbers all day and I now have growing confidence that Fianna Fáil will remain as the largest party of local government when all the votes are counted and the full democratic process has concluded,” said Minister Chambers. “We are in a really strong position as the final seats are declared.” IRELAND SOUTH Electorate - 1,345,792 Total Poll - 713,323 Spoiled Votes - 24,759 Valid Poll - 688,564 Quota - 114,761 Seats - Five CANDIDATES - FIRST COUNT: Blighe, Derek (Ind) - 25,071 Bogue, Lorna (Rabharta) - 8,788 De Barra, Graham (Ind) - 4,575 Doyle, Christopher (Ind) - 3,530 Doyle, Susan (SD) - 20,229 Fitzgibbon, Mary (Ind) - 6,281 Funchion, Kathleen (SF) - 50,580 Gavan, Paul (SF) - 22,392 Hourigan, Niamh (Labour) - 21,272 Kelleher, Billy (FF) - 91,074 Kelly, Sean (FG) - 122,777 Lahive, Ross (Ind/IPP) - 4,461 Leahy, Michael (Ind/IFP) - 12,259 McGurk, Una (Ind) - 6,387 McNamara, Michael (Ind) - 56,339 Mullins, John (FG) - 35,281 Murphy, Patrick (Aontu) - 14,124 Ní Mhurchú, Cynthia (FF) - 55,209 O'Riordan, Ciaran (Ind) - 2,477 O'Sullivan, Grace (Green) - 47,661 Prendiville, Cian (PBP) - 6,243 Punch, Eddie (Ind) - 20,751 Wallace, Mick (Ind) - 52,803 Ralph Riegel\n\nEUROPEAN ELECTIONS 2024: Track all the live results here\n\nLOCAL ELECTIONS 2024: Track all the live results here\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nEuropean Elections Dublin - All seats filled\n\nBarry Andrews, Regina Doherty, Lynn Boylan and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin have been elected as Dublin's MEPs to the European Parliament.\n\nIndependent Ireland candidate Niall Boylan was the final person eliminated from the race, as outgoing Green MEP Ciarán Cuffe's votes were redistributed and boosted Ó'Ríordáin to the final seat after a long three days of counting at the RDS Simmonscourt.\n\nGabija Gataveckaite\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nLimerick Mayoral Election - Breaking\n\nIndependent John Moran has become the first-ever directly elected Mayor of Limerick.\n\nThe Dooradoyle native beat beat another Independent, Helen O'Donnell, to the post.\n\nCian Ó'Broin\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nEuropean Elections Ireland South\n\nThe eighth count in Ireland South saw Clare-based Independent candidate Michael McNamara pick up the largest number of transfers.\n\nHe secured 1,088 transfers from Independent candidate Una McGurk, bringing his total to 58,897.\n\nMs McGurk, who is a barrister from Kenmare, Co Kerry was eliminated in this count.

I have a very positive mandate now from the people of Dublin to do the work.\n\n“Hugely relieved. We waited a few days but I waited eight months the last time so it was really brilliant.\n\n“I want to thank all the people in the count centre for their patience and their professionalism for carrying out the count. It’s a very arduous task but they did it brilliantly and their communication was fantastic. I am really grateful to them.\n\n“We ran a positive pro-EU campaign.\n\n“There was a sense that there is a growth in extremist ideology on the fringes of the political spectrum and we presented a much more positive agenda and I think people responded to that.”\n\nPA\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nEuropean Elections Dublin\n\nFine Gael’s Regina Doherty has said it was “a bloody marvellous feeling” to be elected as a Dublin MEP.\n\nAsked to point out the reason why the party had performed well in the elections, Ms Doherty looked to her right at Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach Simon Harris.\n\nShe said: “I’m not looking at anyone in particular but we’ve had a really renewed sense of energy in the last couple of months. And it’s not just because the Taoiseach has it, he has made us all believe in ourselves and instil a new energy so that we go that extra mile.\n\n“That has certainly helped.\" Mr Harris said he was “absolutely delighted” that Ms Doherty had been elected and thanked the Dublin electorate. He said: “She has worked so hard, she deserves this, I’m so proud of her and of course she’s going to continue an incredible tradition of Fine Gael people representing Dublin in the European Parliament.\n\n”Mr Harris added that he was “very hopeful” that the party could come away with four MEP seats in total by taking two seats in Midlands-Northwest.\n\nPA\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nEuropean Elections Dublin\n\nNewly elected Labour MEP Aodhán O’Ríordáin has said that he felt “maybe Dublin needs a better voice” after the riots in the capital last November.\n\n“For the Labour Party, it’s been a rough number of years but Ivana (Bacik) with her by-election has changed the entire dynamic of this party,” the TD said.\n\n“She showed that with a level of integrity and politics and unwavering in her belief in social justice that we can win again.\n\n“When we started this campaign, I don’t think many people gave us a chance, but we won.\n\n“It’s been a very emotional year for me, I lost my dad a year ago and that really motivated me a lot after the riots in November that maybe Dublin needs a better voice.”\n\nLabour leader Ms Bacik said his election means “a huge amount” to the party. She said: “‘For the love of Dublin’, the slogan, really summed up what we were about and that resonated with people, they wanted to hear that positive message of constructive change that we’ve been putting forward. It means a great deal to us.”\n\nPA\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nEuropean Elections Dublin\n\nLynn Boylan, newly elected Sinn Fein MEP for Dublin, said she is “exhausted” but “absolutely overwhelmed” by the support she received.\n\nWhile Sinn Féin leadership has acknowledged the elections went worse than expected, Ms Boylan was insistent that the party had a “positive” result – after electing an MEP in Dublin and increasing its representation in local government.\n\nShe said: “How is it a bad election when we’re the party that increased its vote? Fianna Fail and Fine Gael decreased their vote.“\n\n\"They decreased their number of councillors. We’ve increased our vote, we’ve increased our number of councillors.”\n\nSpeaking to RTÉ’s Prime Time, Ms Boylan added: “Therefore, we take that as a good day. Is it as good of a day as we’d have liked? Of course not, but it is a good day nonetheless when you’re going in the right direction.”\n\nAsked if Mary Lou McDonald should continue as leader into the general election, she said: “Absolutely, she’s the right person to lead the party into the next general election.”\n\nPA\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nEuropean Election Dublin - final results\n\nOfficial results:\n\nRegina Doherty FG (+8,717) 77,442\n\nBarry Andrews FF (+7,771) 76,881\n\nLynn Boylan SF (+3,649) 68,235\n\nAodhan O Riordain Labour (+16,614) 63,526\n\nNon transferable papers (+5,905) 40,220\n\nGabija Gataveckaite\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nEuropean Elections Ireland South\n\nMick Wallace (I4C) picked up the largest number of transfers in the seventh count at Ireland South.\n\nThe Wexford based candidate received 1,214 transfers from Cian Prendiville of People Before Profit.

I don’t think those issues have gone away. It’s a bit like having a hole in the roof of your house and saying ‘ah, we’ll get around to that in a few years’ time’.\n\n“I think we absolutely have to face up to climate breakdown and biodiversity loss, we have to ensure a green transition, but clearly at a European level the issue of migration featured very strongly.“\n\nIt had to, given that the issue has been on the front page for a long time and that we really have had challenges in accommodating 100,000 Ukrainians and others who have fled persecution and violence, so that did dominate a lot of the campaign.”\n\nPA\n\nEoghan Moloney\n\nEuropean Election Ireland South\n\nIRELAND SOUTH (Sixth Count)\n\nExclusion of Graham de Barra (Independent) and distribution of his 4,906 papers\n\nCANDIDATES – (Sixth Count)\n\nBlighe, Derek (Ind) - +372 26,564\n\nBogue, Lorna (Rabharta) -+498 9,584\n\nDoyle, Susan (SD) - +599 21,229\n\nFitzgibbon, Mary (Ind) - +412 7,684\n\nFunchion, Kathleen (SF) -+325 51,501\n\nGavan, Paul (SF) – +106 22,895\n\nHourigan, Niamh (Labour) - +184 22,006\n\nKelleher, Billy (FF) - + 287 93,675\n\nLeahy, Michael (Ind/IFP) - +73 13,201\n\nMcGurk, Una (Ind) - +99 6,828\n\nMcNamara, Michael (Ind) - +136 57,633\n\nMullins, John (FG) – +105 36,373\n\nMurphy, Patrick (Aontu) - +90 14,638\n\nNí Mhurchú, Cynthia (FF) - +161 56,541\n\nO'Sullivan, Grace (Green) +272 48,576\n\nPrendiville, Cian (PBP) - +134 6,650\n\nPunch, Eddie (Ind) - +46 21,258\n\nWallace, Mick (Ind) - +279 54,386\n\nNon Transferable — 728\n\nNo Candidate has reached the quota on this count.\n\nPrendiville, Cian (PBP) has been eliminated.
