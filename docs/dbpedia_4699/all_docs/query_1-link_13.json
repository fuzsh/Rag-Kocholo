Our Constitution provides that there should be, on average, one TD to represent every 20,000-30,000 people.\n\nOur electoral laws also set out further criteria for Constituency Reviews:\n\nthat each constituency will be comprised of 3, 4 or 5 members;\n\nthat the breaching of county boundaries should be avoided if possible;\n\nthat each constituency must be composed of adjoining areas;\n\nthat we must consider significant geographic, population density and physical features,\n\nand finally, that in carrying out this work, the Electoral Commission should try to maintain as much continuity of electoral areas as possible.\n\nThe Commission recommends that the next Dáil would see 174 TDs representing 43 Dáil Constituencies, up from the current 160 TDs in 39 Constituencies.\n\nIn November 2023, we made our independent recommendations to the Oireachtas on the make-up of Ireland’s electoral constituencies for June’s European Parliament elections.\n\nThe Commission recommends, in its report laid before the Oireachtas today, that an additional 14th MEP allocated to Ireland for the European Parliament elections, will be allocated to the Midlands-North West constituency, and that the counties of Laois and Offaly transfer from the South constituency into the Midlands constituency.\n\nThe recommendations follow a month long public consultation with submissions received from political parties, elected representatives and interested individuals."
