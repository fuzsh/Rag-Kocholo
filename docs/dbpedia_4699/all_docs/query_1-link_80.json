        "text": "On Wednesday 14th November Minister of State for Training, Skills and Innovation, John Halligan TD, will welcome people and community groups from around Ireland to Leinster House to make the case to TDs, Ministers and Officials that evidence matters to the public, and why they expect politicians to discuss it openly.\n\nSixteen people will each give a 1-minute speech about why evidence matters to them, including a craft brewer, a beekeeper, a chef, farmer, a parent and an inter-county hurler, as well as community group representatives urging government to use evidence in policymaking on housing, loneliness, the environment, cycling and the Irish language.\n\nEvidence Matters is an initiative of Sense about Science supported by Science Foundation Ireland and hosted by Minister John Halligan. They are organising this event in the face of a new wisdom setting in that the public aren’t interested in evidence in our ‘post-truth’ society, to challenge this caricature that the public is uninterested in the soundness of policy.\n\nSense about Science has published the stories the citizens are going to tell in a booklet. There are many others who would have come in their place and we have collected comments and support from some of those people too. Every one of the 40 political constituencies in Ireland is represented as well as the six counties of Northern Ireland.\n\nSíle Lane, Head of international campaigns and policy, Sense about Science “As the idea of a “post truth” public rumbles through public life, people have been asking us what it means and whether politicians might start ignoring the public values of truthfulness and accountability. These people coming to the Dáil today are challenging the caricature that the public is uninterested in the soundness of policy. They have different opinions, they don’t agree on what evidence to prioritise and others would no doubt disagree with them. But in uniting over its importance to understanding, accountability and scrutiny, we hope they’ll inspire TDs to strike for better in public life.”\n\nProfessor Mark Ferguson Director General, Science Foundation Ireland and Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government of Ireland “Science Foundation Ireland invests in world-leading research in Ireland. As an agency, we are passionate about ensuring that research, funded by the public, provides societal benefit to the people of Ireland – be that through medical breakthroughs or generating data to support government policymaking. I am very enthusiastic about this partnership with Sense about Science which provides us with an opportunity to highlight the importance of evidence-based policy making and the impact that publicly-funded research can have.”\n\nMinister John Halligan Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Education and Skills with special responsibility for Training, Skills, Innovation, Research and Development Minister stated “As public representatives in Dáil Éireann and the Houses of the Oireachtas, there is an onus on politicians and policy makers to ensure that government policy, which can have far reaching implications for the people of Ireland, is made through informed, data-driven analysis and debate. I am delighted to invite Sense about Science and Science Foundation Ireland to bring real life stories to the Houses of the Oireachtas, to shine a light on the importance of evidence-based policy making during Science Week 2018.”"
