        "text": "I suppose the present state of affairs in the political arena called for a few words…the opinions I am about to express are my own – I do not think that they will coincide with those of the other members present. However, at this meeting we are all free lances and every man is entitled to speak out his own mind. The vital question before us at present- a question which we had so often discussed at previous meetings of the Executive – was the attainment of our National rights, which meant the opening of a native Parliament in Dublin. As we are all aware the Home Rule Bill had received the Royal Assent and had been placed on the Statute Book of England.\n\nThat, of course, would be all very fine and would meet with the desires of the Irish race, for, although the Home Rule Bill was not up to our expectations, at the same time it gave us substantially what we had been looking for. But there was a danger in the whole situation, and the danger was the Amending Bill. Of course the situation would not be all bad if we only knew what the Amending Bill was, but we did not know, and, perhaps, it might tear the original Bill to shreds. What they did know was from statements that had been made by prominent Ministers of the Government, and by members of the Opposition Party. Carson and his crowd declared that they would not have Home Rule at all, and, on the other hand, Mr. Asquith and other members of the Government, said they would not force the Bill by force of arms on Ulster, or coerce that province into submission to the Act.\n\nThere is a dual celebration this year, owing to the day falling on a Sunday. All the large business houses in the city are closed and employees are thus enabled to enjoy a little relaxation from the toils of business.\n\nThe day is being observed with becoming fitness. The weather is exceptionally fine, and large numbers are abroad enjoying the sunshine which lights up the atmosphere. Everyone, young and old, are sporting the shamrock, and the day is being honoured in the best possible fashion. In the various churches of all denominations, special services in honour of the Patron Saint are being held and are attended by large numbers.\n\nAt St. Mary’s Cathedral, where the Union Jack flies from the Tower, the song being sung is “The Hymn of St. Patrick” (Muspratt) The day is being observed by all classes. The ships in port are dressed in celebration of the day. In the evening at St. Michael’s Parochial Church, the Rev. G. Nolan, Professor of Irish at Maynooth, will be preaching to a large congregation. A few showers are beginning to fall. The sobriety of the people is remarkable. Due to the coal strike, the Railway Company will not be running any excursions, but many plan to journey out of town by one or other of the ordinary trains. The principal attraction outside the city being the Point-to-Point Races at Newmarket-on-Fergus which will be well attended.\n\n“Every duty of responsible citizens was expected from women – yet the one thing which made citizenship real and alive, was denied to them. Those who told them that women were too precious and should be kept out of the dust path of party politics [were] the very men who got women to canvas for them at elections! (laughter) They were perfectly fit to get the vote for a man, but they could not vote for themselves. I agree that a woman’s duty began at home, but there were 1.25 million women who did not have husbands. The condition of women labour was very unsatisfactory and the worst employers of sweated labour were the Government.”\n\nEducation in Ireland is, in my opinion, in a thoroughly sound and healthy condition. What contributes to [our schools] success is the profound religious peace in which they work. The Chief Secretary, says the states of things existing in Ireland is heaven [re: education]. And so it is. Protestants and Catholics differ on many things but all of them can educate their children in peace and in line with their religious beliefs. But unfortunately, it is not to last. A very influential Member of Parliament has given us notice that he is determined as soon as we get Home Rule, to recast the whole system of Irish education, in all its branches, from top to bottom. I do not like to introduce politics into the serene air of a convent, but this is not merely a political question. This touches religion in its most vital parts. When I read Mr. Dillon’s speech I confess that a shiver ran down my back. We are promised not a change here and there but a complete recasting of the whole system, but without any indication of what’s to come. For the Catholic clergy it is a serious prospect. Are they to be turned out of the managership? Who is to take their place? You might as well let out all the winds of Aeolus on the country and for what? To impose on Ireland the semi-secularism which is rapidly undermining all religion in the schools of England."
