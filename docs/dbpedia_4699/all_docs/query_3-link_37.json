        "text": "He was one of the key leaders of the 1916 “Easter Rising” armed insurrection that ended with his execution but paved the way for most of Ireland to win its independence from Britain.\n\nBut before that, Thomas James Clarke lived on Long Island. For nearly two years, he and his wife, Kathleen, lived on a 60-acre farm they bought in Manorville.\n\nAs St. Patrick’s Day arrives, some Irish Americans are remembering the heroism of a one-time Suffolk resident who became a legendary revolutionary in Ireland.\n\n“Thomas James Clarke was the Sam Adams of Ireland,” said Mike McCormack, the New York State historian and former national historian for the Ancient Order of Hibernians, referring to one of the leaders of the American Revolution. “He was the guy behind the revolution of 1916.”\n\nClarke's Long Island connections\n\nAt the site of Clarke’s former farm, the Hibernians have erected a monument honoring him and his wife, Kathleen Daly Clarke, a noted leader of the Irish independence movement herself.\n\nMcCormack and others had heard a rumor of the Clarkes’ move to Suffolk County, and spent three years researching to confirm it. They finally did in the 1980s, finding deeds to two 30-acre adjoining properties in Manorville with Thomas Clarke’s name on them.\n\nMcCormack lobbied politicians to declare the site a historic landmark, and the Town of Brookhaven soon did. To mark the location and honor Clarke and his wife, the Hibernians erected a two-ton Wicklow granite obelisk carved and engraved in Ireland.\n\nEighteen months ago, they added a “Mass Rock” — a flat-topped stone of the same type the Irish used as altars when they celebrated Roman Catholic Masses in secret in the woods because of British persecution.\n\nNext month, after Easter and the 108th anniversary of the uprising, the Hibernians will hold their annual wreath laying ceremony at the rock to remember the martyred Clarke and his wife.\n\nThomas Clarke, who was naturalized during his time in New York, was the only American citizen executed by the British for the Easter Rising.\n\nHis story — and the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland — is attracting the interest of such people as Bishop John Barres of the Diocese of Rockville Centre and Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York.\n\nWhenever Dolan visits Ireland, including last August, “I always look forward to having the opportunity to celebrate Mass at one of the ‘Mass Rocks’ that dot the country,” he said in a statement. “It never fails to remind me that in times of trouble and persecution, people turned to the rock of their faith for strength and comfort.”\n\nHe said he hopes to visit the Manorville site soon, and perhaps even celebrate Mass there.\n\nPlanting seeds of the Irish revolution\n\nClarke’s path to Long Island started with the 15 years he spent in British prisons, where he was tortured and nearly starved for his activities in the Irish independence movement, McCormack said.\n\nBy 1900, like many Irish revolutionaries, he moved to New York to escape persecution by the British and to help raise funds for the cause of Irish independence.\n\nKathleen, whom he had earlier met in Ireland, where they fell in love, soon followed him. She was from a revolutionary family also — her uncle had served time in prison with Thomas.\n\nThe two married in New York in 1901, and lived in the Bronx and Brooklyn before moving to Manorville in early 1906 with their children for health reasons, said McCormack, who lives in Selden. Kathleen may have had an asthmatic condition, he said.\n\nOn the farm, Thomas Clarke grew vegetables that he sold locally, and cut down trees that he sent to New York City for use in fireplaces, McCormack said.\n\nClarke sensed that a world war was coming, and Britain might be involved and distracted — a good time to relaunch the independence movement, McCormack said.\n\nSo he and his family moved back in November 1907.\n\nHe opened a tobacco shop in Dublin, but surreptitiously gave out orders as he helped rebuild the nationalist movement.\n\nThey planned a major rebellion for Easter Sunday 1916. The idea was to take over British-run government buildings in Dublin — including the central post office — and other strategic points to spark the masses to rise up and overthrow the British, said Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University and a historian who co-authored a curriculum about Ireland.\n\nThe plot had to be aborted for Easter when one leader got nervous about its prospects for success and publicly called off the “maneuvers.” But Clarke pushed on, and launched it the next day — April 24, 1916 — with a few thousand followers.\n\nHe and other leaders took over several buildings, with the post office serving as their headquarters. For nearly a week, they exchanged fire with the British, until they were finally overwhelmed by British artillery. With some badly injured, the 2,500 patriots surrendered to 20,000 British troops.\n\nThe masses never rose up, partly because the British had shut down all media including radio, newspapers and telegraphs. The rest of the country did not learn about the rebellion until it was over. The insurrection seemed like a failure.\n\nBut then the British made a major miscalculation: Without any legal representation or due process, they lined up Clarke and 13 other leaders before a firing squad in a jail.\n\nThe Irish public was outraged, Singer said.\n\n“The assassination of the participants infuriated the Irish population and turned the population from tacit acceptance of British rule to a commitment to overturning British colonialism in Ireland,” he said.\n\nMcCormack said the uprising “really turned out to be the Bunker Hill of Irish military history because the reaction of the British … was in the extreme.”\n\nKathleen Clarke picks up the revolution mantle\n\nWith her husband dead, Kathleen Clarke became an even more integral part of the independence movement, working with Michael Collins, the new head of the resistance. The Irish Republican Army was born, and waged a guerrilla war against the British, forcing them to the treaty table.\n\nBy 1921 Britain allowed most of Ireland to become a “free state” — a self-governing dominion that still required British approval for international affairs.\n\nBy 1949, the free state became its own fully independent Republic of Ireland. Six counties in Northern Ireland remained under British control and were plagued by conflict that did not end until 1998.\n\nKathleen Clarke went on to become a delegate to the Irish parliament and the first woman mayor in Irish history, presiding over Dublin. In 1972 she received the rare honor of a state funeral in Ireland when she died at age 94.\n\nOver the decades, the Easter Rising her husband helped lead has been immortalized by figures including the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, who wrote “Easter, 1916.”\n\nMcCormack said he hopes more Long Islanders and others of Irish descent will pay tribute to Clarke on St. Patrick's Day. Clarke “was a military genius,” he said, “the dedicated Irish patriot who put a British colony on the road to the independent Republic of Ireland.”"
