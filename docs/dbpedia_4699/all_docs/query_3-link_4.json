        "text": "Each Senator featured in this exhibition was a political, social or economic changemaker in Ireland over the course of the last 100 years. They championed issues or causes that were often less visible or important to the mainstream political system and used their position to advocate for change.\n\nOver the last 100 years this transitioned into voices representing other minority communities and minority opinions, often leading to major change in our country.\n\nI hope you will agree with me that the exhibition reminds us how much impact an individual can have in championing minority communities and minority causes by harnessing the power of being a member of Seanad Éireann in our national parliament. It is an honour and one that those Senators exhibited, and many others seized upon.\n\n‘Minority Voices, Major Changes’ is both the theme of this exhibition and of the wider Seanad100 centenary programme and I would encourage you to explore the various outreach initiatives running throughout the year ahead.\n\nFinally, may I extend my thanks to everyone who is contributing to Seanad100 and the marking of this important milestone for our parliament.\n\n— Mark Daly\n\nKathleen Clarke (1878-1972)\n\nKathleen Clarke was a Republican activist who served as vice-president of Cumann na mBan.\n\nShe was imprisoned after the 1916 Rising and her husband Tom Clarke and brother Edward Daly were executed.\n\nElected to the Dáil in 1921, she voted against the Treaty.\n\nNominated to the First Seanad in 1928 as Fianna Fáil member, she argued against a section in the Conditions of Employment Bill 1935 which precluded women from taking position in certain industries. Clarke refused to accept the consensus that “equal pay for equal work” would lead to driving down of men’s wages.\n\nIn 1939 she became the first woman Lord Mayor of Dublin.\n\nRead more about the Senator\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nDuring his time as Senator, he supported Private Members’ Bills and motions that advocated for the rights of those with disabilities, including a motion on access to educational and other opportunities for people with disabilities and the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2013.\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nHe spoke on a variety of topics but took a particular interest in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, co-sponsoring a motion to debate the “impasse” in 1978. In his closing remarks on the motion, he called for a draft constitution for a united Ireland “concentrating on human rights which would be guaranteed for all in the event of an agreed united Ireland some time in the future\".\n\nRead more about the Senator\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nHe consistently highlighted the deterioration of Ireland’s public finances, arguing against what he saw as public spending spiralling out of control and advocated informing the public on the state of the economy. Nominated to the Seanad by the Taoiseach, he served from 1977 to 1982.\n\nBy his own description, his cautionary approach was viewed as “undermining public confidence” by some of his fellow Senators.\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nShe was nominated to the First Seanad in 1922. Together with Edith Costello, she convinced the Seanad to reject the Civil Service Regulation Bill 1925, which confined women to lower grades within the civil service and argued against the Conditions of Employment Bill 1935 which restricted the ability of women to take up work in certain industries.\n\nRead more about the Senator\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nShe was a member of the Seanad from 1987 to 1989 representing Fine Gael, first as a Taoiseach’s nominee and subsequently as a member on the Labour Panel.\n\nAs a Senator she supported the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill 1988 and served on the Joint Committee on Women’s Rights.\n\nRead more about the Senator\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nDuring his time in the Seanad, he spoke frequently and at length on debates on the economy, campaigned for Ireland to join the EEC and argued against tax allowances which he declared “the subsidy to better-off section of the community indicates the extent to which we are dominated by the middle-class thinking in this respect, to the exclusion of any proper social approach to these matters”.\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nDespite her active participation in businesses and public life, she campaigned against women’s suffrage and voted in favour of the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill 1925 which sought to confine women to lower grades of the civil service.\n\nDuring her time in the Seanad, she argued against outlawing divorce which she saw as a liberty guaranteed by the Constitution to the minority of non-Catholics. She was a member of the Seanad until her death in 1933.\n\nRead more about the Senator\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nDuring a debate on Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 1987 he stated: “Every Minister is going to hate me because I will keep on chipping away with my hammer and chisel until the system begins to understand that we have a country which is nothing short of a jewel and we do not really understand what we have and what we stand to lose”.\n\nRead more about the Senator\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nHe tabled a motion and raised adjournment debates to end corporal punishment in Irish schools during his time in the Seanad. The use of corporal punishment would not be abolished until the 1980s.\n\nHe was an independent member on the University of Dublin panel from 1954 to 1961 and again from 1965 to 1970.\n\nRead more about the Senator\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nShe was a member of the Seanad on the University of Dublin panel from 1979 to 1987.\n\nShe was a prominent campaigner against the introduction of the 8th amendment and tabled a motion to reject the Second reading of the bill initiating the 1983 referendum.\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nIn the Seanad, she consistently highlighted the situation in Northern Ireland. She spoke against the 8th amendment and advocated for liberalising legislation on contraceptives despite defining her views as pro-life, arguing that “it is not for the legislators to make laws which attempt to force people to abide by the moral standards of any particular Church”.\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nShe was a member of the Seanad from 1938 to 1968. She passionately argued against cuts in funding for the Irish language in schools in 1949: “I am afraid all this is having a bad effect on the ordinary people, who begin to think that Irish does not matter”.\n\nDespite admitting that her Irish was barely conversational, she consistently debated for more visibility and funding for the language which she saw as a fundamental part of national identity.\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history\n\nHe was a member of the Seanad from 1922 to 1928.\n\nDuring his time in the Seanad, he was a frequent contributor to debates, ranging from tabling a motion on returning paintings from the Hugh Lane collection from England back to Ireland to objecting to the use of Irish language in parliamentary proceedings: “Would I be in order in moving as an amendment that the prayer be read in Irish as soon as the majority of the members of the Seanad know Irish?”\n\nRead more about the Senator\n\nSee the Senator's Oireachtas membership history"
