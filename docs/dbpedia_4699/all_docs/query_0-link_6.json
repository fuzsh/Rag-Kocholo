        "text": "Breaking News\n\nUnlike before, there were no armed guards at the entrances to the National University, Dublin, allowing anyone to walk in off the street to see the Dáil in action, on the 20th May 1922. Not that many did and the few members of the public, who had gathered outside, passed the time by reading newspapers when not gazing indifferently up at the top-storey windows. Either politics had become old hat or people were losing faith in parliamentary procedures making a difference. After all, previous attempts had recently been made to resolve the deadlock in the country, only to end in miserable failure each time.\n\nA very different atmosphere was found inside the building. Delegates talked and mingled, their conversations punctuated by the odd burst of laughter as they waited in the long hall, beside the chamber where they were to formally meet. As one attendee observed:\n\nA group of anti-Treaty deputies sitting on the broad staircase leading to the Science room, rows of them, all smiling as if they were having their photographs taken.\n\nLiam Mellows struck a casual pose, his legs far apart and hands deep in the pockets of his riding-breeches, as he chatted with Richard Mulcahy. That the two enemies were so relaxed in each other’s company was proof enough that some novelty was in the air. In contrast, the President of Dáil Éireann, Arthur Griffith, sat silently, arms folded and head down, a frown creasing his face.\n\nShowing more spark was his colleague Michael Collins, who moved between the partisans of the anti-Treaty side and his own, perfectly at ease as he posed questions and smiled at the replies. When Harry Boland flitted by, those he passed thought they could recognise Griffith’s handwriting on the sheet of paper he held, but Boland moved too quickly for them to be sure.\n\nBoland’s appearance was taken as a signal that the Dáil was about to open and, by unspoken agreement, the assembled deputies streamed into the chamber and took their seats. As the Speaker, Eoin MacNeill, rose to begin, the light from the lower windows framed him from behind, almost like a halo.\n\nHe read out the document that Collins and Éamon de Valera, on behalf of the pro and anti-Treaty parties respectively, had just put their names to. It was an agreement that, for the upcoming general election, candidates would be put forward from a ‘National Coalition Panel’ consisting of both the opposing factions. Instead of competing against each other, Pro and Anti-Treatyites would run on the same platform, under the same Sinn Féin name and for the sake of the same ideal: unity.\n\nThere had been little enough of that as it was.\n\nGriffith then stood up and, with a funereally air, moved that, on the basis of what they had just heard, the Dáil should thus call for such an election.\n\n“Does that mean that the House approves of the agreement?” asked de Valera.\n\nWhen Griffith answered that it did, de Valera was all smiles: “Then I have great pleasure in seconding the President’s motion.”\n\nAs the deputies left the room, their business complete, Collins continued mingling with the opposition, calling out to Anti-Treatyites who, months before, had been his comrades-in-arms, then sworn foes, and now bosom buddies once again. De Valera was more circumspect as he quietly took his leave, looking younger than he had for a long time. Griffith had already departed, walking straight ahead without sparing as much as a glance for anyone, a hint that all was not well behind closed doors. It was left to Mulcahy to provide some sort of explanation, albeit a terse and indirect one, to the mystified journalists inquiring about the meaning of what they had just seen.\n\n“It means that we have not adopted the solution suggested by the Irish Times,” he said cryptically.[1]\n\n‘Wrangling Over a Corpse’\n\nThe newspaper in question certainly made its surprise known in its coverage of this latest twist in the Irish tale. What baffled its editorial was why the Pro-Treatyites had agreed to such a thing, since “a general election on the issue of the Treaty would have returned the Provisional Government to office with an overwhelming majority.”\n\nYet, despite their strong hand, “Mr Collins and Mr Griffith have consented to allow Republicans into the new Parliament in their present strength and to give them a virtual equality in the next Executive.” Adding to the confusion, with the promise of more to come, was how “the new Executive, which was to have enforced the Free State Constitution, will contain, by pre-arrangement, declared enemies of the Free State.”\n\nAnd this was after Collins:\n\n…declared a few days ago that, if the peace negotiations [between the pro and anti-Treaty sides] should fail, he would begin to enforce the law in the teeth of political resistance. The negotiations have succeeded and the resistance presumably has been turned into co-operation.\n\nA co-operation, that is, with “the tyranny of the ‘gunmen’.” So much, then, for all the tough talk about the law and its enforcement. The only explanation the Irish Times could think of for this startling submissiveness was that both Collins and Griffith:\n\n…are appalled by the state of Ireland, that they have asked the Republicans to combine with them in a great effort to restore order, and that an agreement is the price of such co-operation.\n\nWhile the newspaper clearly did not overly care for this price, it announced itself – contrary to what Mulcahy might have assumed – prepared to make the best of the situation at hand:\n\nIn Heaven’s name, then, let the effort be made without further loss of time. The country is far advanced on the road to ruin, and, if matters do not improve quickly, the two parties in the proposed “Coalition” Executive will find themselves wrangling over a corpse.[2]\n\nHyperbole, this was not. Ireland had been dangerously in a state of disarray since December 1921, with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which ended one war – with Britain – and opened another conflict – with itself.\n\nStampeded into War\n\nThough the agreement had been ratified by the Dáil a month later, that did not mean it was accepted by all, particularly those in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) for whom anything less than a Republic was unacceptable – and this British-mandated Free State that the Treaty allowed fell very, very short in their eyes. When a sixteen-strong Executive was formed in March 1922 – consisting of men such as Liam Lynch, Rory O’Connor, Liam Mellows, Ernie O’Malley and others who already held senior posts in the IRA – its first act was to pledge fidelity solely to the Republic, with no room for the Treaty, the Free State, the Provisional Government – and possibly for democracy.\n\n“A resolution to proclaim the elections which were to be held in Southern Ireland was discussed at a meeting” of the IRA Executive, recounted O’Malley in his memoirs:\n\nThe Treaty would be the issue of elections to be held in the twenty-six counties only…Unless England withdrew her threat of war no election should be held. There was a majority in favour of proclaiming the elections, but no decision was arrived at, as a unanimous vote would be needed to take such an important step.[3]\n\nWhile a potentially catastrophic line had avoided being crossed, the possibility remained; after all, the Executive had not decided not to forbid a future general election. It was not so much the principle of one that the Executive opposed; just that, in such a contest, the anti-Treaty partisans would almost certainly come off the worst.\n\nThis risk was forefront in the minds of the five Republican representatives who met in the Mansion House, Dublin, at the start of May 1922, opposite another quintet from the pro-Treaty grouping, as part of the ten-person ‘Peace Committee’. Set up at the behest of the Dáil, the Committee was to explore potential avenues for a compromise – and the sooner the better, for while they sat and talked behind closed doors, contingency plans were being laid in preparation for the worst.\n\nThe IRA Executive had already claimed the Four Courts for its headquarters, around which snipers would be posted in the event of a war with the Free Staters. O’Malley went further in arranging for barrels of petrol and paraffin to be stored in the cellars in order to raze the Four Courts utterly should it fall into enemy hands. Elsewhere in the city, bridges were to be destroyed and street barricades raised to trap the enemy in place for counterattacks.[4]\n\nA Let Down\n\nEven if not all of the Peace Committee attendees were aware of these preparations, they must have anticipated the consequences if they failed. For the next three weeks, both halves did their best, often sitting long into the night. While all ten agreed on the benefits of a general election in breaking the deadlock, for the Anti-Treatyites it meant exposing themselves to the judgment of an unfriendly electorate.\n\n“It would in effect be penalising them for their vote against the Treaty,” as how Kathleen Clarke, the Chairwoman of the Committee (and widow of the 1916 Signatory), put it. Which was fine by their pro-Treaty counterparts, who argued that the Dáil needed a solid working majority; not so much for Clarke and her colleagues, also desirous of a bloodless resolution but not at the cost of political hara-kiri.\n\nA climb-down on the Anti-Treatyites’ part suddenly materialised when one of their five, Harry Boland, came back, uncharacteristically late from lunch, to inform the other five that they could go ahead and permit a general election, even if it meant writing off some of their seats.\n\n“The Chief says we can agree,” Boland added, referring to de Valera.\n\nThis, Clarke and Liam Mellows refused to accept. When a conference of anti-Treaty politicos was held that night in their Suffolk Street offices to confirm, de Valera denied agreeing to any such thing, claiming a misunderstanding on Boland’s part, despite the other man’s heated protestations to the contrary. The stormy exchange dragged on even after the meeting closed, with the two men remaining behind in the room to argue it out while Clarke and another female deputy, Madge Clifford, waited in a taxi outside for Boland to accompany them.\n\nMinutes ticked by. When Clarke went back inside and up the stairs, she heard through the door Boland and de Valera still speaking to – or, rather, shouting at – each other. “It’s alright, Chief, you let me down,” Boland said.\n\nHaving reached the top of the landing, Clarke made a noise to alert the pair of her presence. Without another word, Boland finally took his leave and came down the stairs with Clarke, joining her and Clifford in the ride back to their respective accommodations. Of what had transpired between him and their political potentate, Boland said not a thing.\n\nThe next day, Clarke, Mellows and Boland sat across from Seán Mac Eoin, Pádraig Ó Malley and Séamus O’Dwyer, and repeated their line that, while a general election was permissible, anything that would benefit one side at the expense of the other – as in their own – was not. With a stand-off reached and nothing beyond, all that was left for the Peace Committee to do was admit its failure to the Dáil,\n\nStill, the three weeks of talk were not a complete waste. A proposal for a Coalition Government, one consisting of members from both sides, had been drafted on the last day of the Committee and forwarded to the Dáil as the best that could be offered for the moment. Next up was the turn of Collins and de Valera, the standard-bearers of their respective parties, to sit down together in the hope of a breakthrough. The next Dáil session was due for the 20th May 1922, during which the two leaders would announce their results – if there was anything worth showing, that is.[5]\n\nPicking the Fruit\n\nA crack in the impasse was hinted at when John Chartres called in at 91 St Stephen’s Green, Dublin, the house of Seán T. O’Kelly, at 10 pm on the Friday of the 19th May. Chartres had worked as a secretary for the Irish Plenipotentiaries who had negotiated the Treaty in London, while O’Kelly was TD for Dublin Mid, and though each had chosen different sides – Chartres for the Treaty, O’Kelly against – the pair remained friends.\n\nThe news was not good, Chartres confided in O’Kelly, for while he was convinced of Collins’ desire for peace, he was also certain that his talks with de Valera would only result in more dashed hopes. To prevent this, he begged his host, in the course of the two or three hours they spent conversing, to step in:\n\nHe insisted also that now was the right moment. The atmosphere was propitious and action taken by us that same night, if we would agree to intervene, was sure of good fruit.\n\nMidnight had long passed by the time Chartres took his leave. Seán O’Kelly continued talking, now with his wife, Mary Kate O’Kelly (née Ryan), who had been present, about what their guest had brought to his attention. O’Kelly was sceptical as to the sincerity of the other side, who were sure to insist that the Treaty be included in any deal, with Mary Kate being more hopeful. Her sister, Min, after all, was married to Richard Mulcahy, giving her as much personal stake as anyone in the matter.\n\nWith sleep that night an impossibility, the couple decided that Mary Kate would use her connection and call Min that Saturday morning, before 8 am, and arrange a get-together between their husbands. When Richard Mulcahy, on the other end of the phone, suggested they meet in the government buildings, O’Kelly counter-proposed the more neutral territory of the Gaelic League on Ely Place. This was agreed, and when the pair met at 9 am:\n\nI outlined to Mulcahy my plans for an agreed peace. They were only a rough outline but were on the lines of the pact that was agreed later that day. Mulcahy, after some criticism of some of the details of my proposals and making some suggestion of amendments here and there, said he believed the proposition I made would be acceptable to his side.\n\nWould it be so to Collins, O’Kelly asked? The Corkman wore a variety of hats: Chairman of the Provisional Government, Minister for Finance and, perhaps most importantly, ‘the man who had won the war’. Obtaining his support was critical, which Mulcahy thought likely. To make sure, he offered to bring the man in question over so O’Kelly could hear for himself. He drove off in his car and returned to Ely Place, a speedy ten or fifteen minutes later, with Collins beside him.\n\nAfter O’Kelly repeated what he and Mulcahy had gone over, Collins said he was willing to try but – in an echo of O’Kelly’s question about him – what were the chances of bringing de Valera on board? He and Collins were due to meet again at noon, the last such encounter before reporting to the Dáil. O’Kelly promised to talk to de Valera. In addition, he offered to attend the summit between the two leaders if he could, with the addition of Boland since he and Collins were still close.\n\nO’Kelly found de Valera in the Republican Party offices in Suffolk Street, chairing a gathering of their colleagues in preparation for the Dáil session. De Valera had already informed them that the odds of any sort of breakthrough with Collins later that day was remote, but O’Kelly asked if he could announce something important:\n\nI then told of my own meeting with Mulcahy and Collins that morning. I told the whole story and its beginning and end. I added my firm conviction that Collins and Mulcahy really wished for peace, an agreed election and later a coalition government.\n\nNot all present were so trusting, but the notion at least was not dismissed out of hand. De Valera had to depart for his appointment with Collins, leaving O’Kelly to oversee the rest of the discussion. O’Kelly told them of his intent to join the pair in their talk and, after some questions, the others agreed to grant him carte blanche to do what he judged best.\n\nFrom Abuse To Agreement\n\nOff O’Kelly went to the Mansion House, accompanied by Boland, where they met Mulcahy, who told them that so far no progress had been made between de Valera and Collins, and that was the way it looked to stay. Undeterred, O’Kelly entered the meeting-room, with Boland and Mulcahy in tow, to find the other two seated at a table.\n\nHow far had they gone in looking through the Peace Committee proposals, O’Kelly inquired?\n\n“We haven’t got past the first b_____ line,” Collins replied, his language being saltier than O’Kelly’s, who primly censured the expletive in his memoirs.\n\nWell, I suggested, let us now start with the last paragraph of that report and work backwards. I am going to act as the chairman. Thus, we five started. There was heated argument, there was abuse, which sometimes almost led to violence but after about three hours [of] argument the Pact was made and signed by the two leaders.\n\nBy then it was 4 pm. Lunch had been completely forgotten, as everyone suddenly and keenly realised. The Lord Mayor, Laurence O’Neill, came to their rescue with sandwiches and coffee, while his secretaries typed up copies of the Pact. They were late enough as it was, since the Dáil was supposed to open at 3 pm, and so both Collins and de Valera agreed to quickly convene their respective parties in private and secure their consensus before announcing anything.\n\nO’Kelly accompanied his leader as:\n\nDe Valera made his report to the anti-Treaty deputies. After a good many questions had been asked and explanations given his report and the Pact he had signed was unanimously approved.\n\nAt the other end, however, things did not go so smoothly.\n\nO’Kelly was in the council chamber of the National University in anticipation of the Dáil, when Boland appeared with the request from Collins to see him outside. There was a bump in the road, a doleful Collins told O’Kelly, in the form of Griffith, who was furious with what Collins had brought to him. Other pro-Treaty TDs such as Seán Milroy and Seán McGarry were in angry agreement with the President, and it looked as if the Pact would grind to a halt before it had even began.\n\nO’Kelly was not impressed. “You are running away,” he told the other man:\n\nCan’t you be a man of your word? You are the Boss. You have signed the Pact. You have the power to force it through. Go back and do so.\n\nO’Kelly expected an enraged Collins, one who would curse and shout and match him, verbal blow by verbal blow. Instead, ‘the man who had won the war’ took the challenge on the chin, with a resigned – even mournful, O’Kelly thought – manner. He would go back and try again, he said.\n\nO’Kelly lost track of time as he waited for Collins to return. When he did, it was to again admit defeat. Griffith was not to be moved. Could O’Kelly try instead? O’Kelly thought it a strange request under the circumstances but said that he would.\n\nWhen Griffith came out, he and O’Kelly met in one of the empty classrooms inside the University. They talked for about fifteen minutes, or rather O’Kelly did, as he pointed to the state of their country. Former comrades were at each other’s throats and internecine strife liable to erupt at any moment. Should Griffith bar the Pact from passing and the worst happened, then the blame would fall on his shoulders. If nothing else, the Pact would provide breathing space and maybe – who knows? – some sort of lasting solution would be found in the meantime.\n\nO’Kelly was begging by the time Griffith relented. He would withdraw his opposition, he said, and was as good as his word when the Dáil finally opened and it was given to him as its president to formally propose that the deputies approve the deal. They did so, and the Pact became, as O’Kelly put it, the law of the land.[6]\n\nAs if it was as simple as that.\n\nFrom Mick to Mr Collins\n\nIf not quite the father of the agreement, then Boland could claim at least to be its midwife. “I worked very hard to secure unity and am quite happy with the present situation,” he wrote in a letter on the 30th May 1922. “The whole game is now in the hands of Mr Collins.”\n\nWhich, as dear a friend as Collins was, did not leave Boland entirely at ease:\n\nWe shall see how he will act. I, for one, would like to think that he will direct all his actions towards the Republic. I cannot say that I doubt him; yet I am uneasy as to his intentions.[7]\n\nOverlooked in these reluctant suspicions was Griffith. Holding up the Pact, even if only for a short while, was one of the few displays of power he managed for, despite his exalted role as President, Griffith was becoming an irrelevance, a totemic figure much honoured but barely consulted. “There were always a lot of men in and out to see him,” remembered his secretary, Elizabeth MacGinley, “but nothing of any importance was every discussed, at least when I was present.”\n\nEven Collins’ visits were rare, and the only discussion of note between them that MacGinley witnessed was about the Pact:\n\nGriffith was totally against it and I was present when he tried to prevail on Michael Collins to abandon the idea. But Collins had given his word and believed the arrangement wold be successful and would bring about a reconciliation between the parties. Therefore, in spite of his eloquent pleading Griffith failed to divert Collins from his purpose.[8]\n\nIt was not the first time the two leaders of the Free State differed on what direction they should take the country. According to Ernest Blythe, “Griffith seemed to me to have made up his mind at a comparatively early stage that the conflict was inevitable,” while Collins swung from pugnacious anger to diplomatic restraint.\n\nAs an example of these shifts in mood:\n\nOnce he came back after having been prevented from visiting Terence McSwiney’s grave in Cork, he appeared to be fully determined on drastic action, but within a few days he was in a different frame of mind.\n\nIf Collins blew hot and cold, then Griffith at least knew his own mind – his problem was, however, that he seldom expressed it. The only speech that Blythe remembered him delivering to the Cabinet was in March 1922, during the stand-off in Limerick between pro and anti-Treaty forces that was threatening to spill out into violence, only three months after the Treaty ratification.\n\nTo Griffith, it was a moment of decision, the time for them to take responsibility as a government now that they were one. If there was to be a war, best get it over and done with, rather than let the country rot with lawlessness. Inwardly, Blythe agreed but kept his silence, aware that it would be the Corkman making the final call.\n\nAs Collins could not bear the thought of turning guns on his old comrades, he eagerly grasped the olive-branch proffered by Mulcahy, who vouched for Liam Lynch’s ability to mediate a climb-down for both sides in Limerick. Though Lynch was in the anti-Treaty camp, he was also desirous of an amicable solution. In that, Collins had much in common with him – more so, in any case, than he had with Griffith, who began to refer to his minister, with icy civility, as ‘Mr Collins’, rather than ‘Mick’ or ‘Collins’ like before.[9]\n\nIt is questionable whether Collins noticed the difference, considering how withdrawn Griffith had become. “His silences were the most expressive evidence” of his dissatisfaction, according to MacGinley. “I rarely heard him discuss the situation with anybody.”[10]\n\nA Hair’s Breadth\n\nLittle wonder, then, that Griffith was increasingly isolated inside the government whose prerogatives he championed. The decision to go ahead with the Pact was a particularly painful moment for him. Several others among the pro and anti-Treaty deputies, seated together, had chosen in its favour before the vote came round the table for the President’s turn.\n\nAs he waited, Blythe could not help but notice the state Griffith was in:\n\nHe worked nervously with his neck-tie in silence. He took off his glasses and wiped them, and I noticed that his hand was shaking so that he could hardly hold them. He put on his glasses, fiddled with his tie again; again he took off his glasses and wiped them, the whole thing occupying, it seemed to me, three of our minutes while dead silence reigned round the table.\n\nIn that brief, but excruciating, amount of time, Griffith held the balance of power in the room. Had he said no, the Pact would be dead in the water and the Cabinet split – not that, in Blythe’s opinion, many would be too upset, considering the reservations about the Pact by many, even those who had already consented.\n\nAs it was, Griffith sealed the deal with a simple “I agree” and that was that.[11]\n\nBefore reconciling itself to the outcome, the Irish Times may have been speaking for itself when it declared how “the Irish people have run the whole gamut of astonishment and disillusionment in recent months.” Griffith’s about-turn, in particular, was worthy of note:\n\nOn Friday last Mr Griffith announced that the issue of the Treaty, the whole Treaty, and nothing but the Treaty, would be submitted to free elections in June. Within twenty-four hours the new agreement, to which Mr Griffith assents, was given to the world, and the word ‘Treaty’ is not mentioned once.\n\nFar from resolving the controversy that had been blighting Ireland, this new-fangled Pact seemed set only in making it worse: “The Free State Party has given everything to the Republicans, including things which it had no title to give. What have the Republicans given in return?”\n\nThe answer was simple: peace. And yet where were the guarantees of even that?\n\nWill the Freemasons’ Hall, the Four Courts and other public and private buildings in Dublin be restored immediately to their proper uses? Will the Republican forces in the South combine to suppress the raids and bank robberies which are destroying the country’s trade?\n\nTo this:\n\nThe text of the agreement offers no clue. We cannot believe, however, that the bargain is so one-sided as it seems to be. Mr Griffith, a man of strong and consistent principles, can have made his strange volte face only under the pressure of some truly compelling argument.[12]\n\nGriffith would not have disagreed, at least about the ‘pressure’ part. Feeling that the choice had been less a case of ‘compelling’ and more one forced on him, he made no secret of his dislike, either of the Pact or of the Chairman to his own government, being “within a hair’s breadth of breaking with Collins,” in Blythe’s opinion – as though the country needed a further split. If the stress of it all had been enough to drive Boland and de Valera into a shouting match, then pro-Treaty partnerships were likewise straining at the seams.[13]\n\nSneaking Through a Verdict\n\nCollins himself would come to regard the whole episode as something of an old shame if his subsequent explanation is something to go by. “An agreement was reached between Mr. de Valera and myself for which I have been severely criticised,” he admitted in his public writings:\n\nIt was said that I gave away too much, that I went too far to meet them, that I had exceeded my powers in making a pact which, to some extent, interfered with the people’s right to make a free and full choice at the elections.[14]\n\nOn that particular point, he offered no rebuttal. When interviewing Collins some months later, in the midst of the Civil War, the journalist Hayden Talbot noted the reticence of his subject against expressing any sort of personal opinion on the Pact, preferring to stick to the dry facts and nothing further.[15]\n\nTo even a devoted follower of Collins, “perhaps all that can be said in [the Pact’s] favour was that it was an attempt to make the best of a bad job, a last desperate effort to find a way out in face of the threat of civil war,” wrote Piaras Béaslaí:\n\nWithout it, in view of the attitude of the armed [anti-Treaty] Irregulars, it would have been impossible to hold a free election. The opponents of the Treaty, in fact, used the threat of the guns to secure a representation which they could not have obtained on the free vote of the people.\n\nDespite his own success in the election-to-come, voted to the seat of Kerry-Limerick West, Béaslaí claimed that, if not for the fact he was out of the country at the time, he “would not have consented to being put on the panel, as I disproved of the ‘pact’ on principle.”[16]\n\nBut, if Collins was genuine to a fault in his desire for peace, and sentimental towards wayward comrades-in-arms like Lynch and Boland at the expense of offending current allies, he also had a calculating side, in Blythe’s view: “Collins, in entering the Pact, was undoubtedly actuated mainly, if not entirely, by a desire to get some sort of a popular verdict over the Treaty.”\n\nFor the Irish Times was quite correct in guessing that any gains from the Pact were not limited to one side – in the long run, anyway. Previously, Collins had tried to arrange with de Valera a plebiscite on the basis that:\n\nCollins knew such a plebiscite would show an overwhelming majority for the Treaty and should justify any action that might have to be taken if the recalcitrant armed forces continued along the path they had been taking.\n\nWhile de Valera had rejected the idea of a plebiscite, Collins was sure that a general election, Pact or otherwise, would be the next best thing: “Collins felt that even under the Pact a test of popular opinion could be obtained.”[17]\n\nAnd now Collins was about to have one. As for what would happen next, well, who could say…?\n\nTo be continued in: The Worst of a Good Deal: The Irish Pact Election of June 1922 (Part II)\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Poblacht Na h-Eireann – The Republic of Ireland, 25/05/1922\n\n[2] Irish Times, 23/05/1922\n\n[3] O’Malley, Ernie.

Ó Ceallaigh Papers\n\nMemories of Mountjoy\n\nSeán Milroy, governor of Mountoy Prison, was surprised at the sight of the latest inmate – a stout, elderly man – brought before him in his office. “Something very bad was wrong with him evidently,” Milroy noted. “He was extremely restless, moving his arms about in a jerky, spasmodic fashion, and rolling his eyes in an awful way.”\n\nThe prisoner’s name, when Milroy asked the warden in attendance, was John Redmond, who had been proving to be a bother, pacing up and down his cell while shouting slogans like: “Poor little Belgium! Charters of liberty! The Allies! The Empire! The Huns!”\n\nAs if to demonstrate, Redmond grew even more agitated in front of Milroy, yelling out: “Disgruntled cranks! Factionists! German gold!” and words to that effect.\n\nThis behaviour worsened as the warden tried calming him, and Milroy rang the bell on his desk for assistance. It was then that the ‘governor’ woke up from his daydream, his role-reversing fantasy of himself in the position of authority, with his political opponents humbled before him, and not, as he really was, a prisoner in Mountjoy.[1]\n\nAt least Milroy – a “well-known Sinn Feiner”, according to a contemporary newspaper report – could take solace in that he was nearing the end of his three-month sentence, from June to September 1915, for “having used language likely to discourage recruiting for His Majesty’s Army” in a public speech. He did not record his time behind bars, spent in the company of like-minded prisoners such as Seán Mac Diarmada and Liam Mellows, until two years later, in 1917, by which time the country was in a very different state, indeed.[2]\n\nNationalist Ireland had turned on itself, like Ouroboros with its tail in its mouth, one end consuming the other. It was now no longer necessary to imagine the degradation of Redmond, on whose shoulders the hopes of Irish self-rule had once rested. The mere sight of him as he left Trinity College, Dublin, in mid-1917, incited boos from the small crowd outside the front gate.\n\nThe jeers grew louder, as the hecklers followed Redmond up Westmoreland Street, prompting some civic-minded passers-by to form a protective ring around the beleaguered politician. Even so, it was only after he hurried inside the first building to hand for refuge that the danger could be said to have passed.\n\n“I am quite sure that if any of the mob had offered physical violence to Redmond,” remembered one witness, “I would have joined in.” To sixteen-year-old Todd Andrews and many others in Sinn Féin, Redmond was “the epitome of politicians in general, and all politicians were regarded as low, dirty and treacherous.”[3]\n\nDivine Law\n\nIt was not for want of trying on Redmond’s part. On the 7th March 1917, he and rest of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tried to break the impasse over Home Rule, its long-cherished project, when T.P. O’Connor, as Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Scotland, introduced a motion in the House of Commons, calling on that august assembly “without further delay to confer upon Ireland the free institutions long promised.”[4]\n\nDavid Lloyd George declined. Or rather, the Prime Minister declared that Home Rule was there for the parts of Ireland which wanted it. But, in regards to the remainder, those who were Irishmen in name while being, as he put it, “as alien in blood, in religious faith, in traditions, in outlook from the rest of Ireland as the inhabitants of Fife and Aberdeen” – no, Home Rule was not something he would force on them.\n\nThese ‘alien’ exceptions were the Unionists, who had shifted from opposing Home Rule in its entirety to demanding that various counties be given the option of remaining outside the jurisdiction of any new Dublin parliament, answerable only to the one at Westminster, just as before. As these Unionists were concentrated largely in Ulster, such allowances would amount in practice to the exclusion of those six counties in the north-east corner of the island.\n\nPerfect from the Ulster Unionists’ point of view but political suicide for Redmond should this Partition happen on his watch. Unfortunately for the Irish Party, such passions were beyond the ability of Englishmen to relate to.\n\n“We often cut up counties in England without engaging in civil war,” Harold Spender, a pro-Home Rule journalist, wrote to Redmond on the 29th March 1917. “There is no divine law against moving a county landmark.”[5]\n\nDivine law or not, that even a sympathetic individual like Spender could be so obtuse did not bode well for the IPP’s chances of rallying enough support to halt Partition. Yet all its MPs could do was try their best.\n\n(Not) Answering the Irish Question\n\nWhen T.P. O’Connor dined with Lloyd George on the 22nd January 1917, his lobbying made little headway. To O’Connor’s dismay, the Prime Minister appeared to have spared Home Rule little thought beforehand, being content with Partition as the only credible solution. He was more interested in the possibility of conscription for Ireland in order to solve the need for manpower on the Western Front, a policy which O’Connor was keen to stress as a debacle in the making.\n\nWhile Lloyd George continuously reassured O’Connor, over the course of their meal together, of his desire to remain on tight terms with his Irish allies, his actions were to fall short of his words, especially if they risked offending the Ulster Unionist presence in Parliament.[6]\n\nNot that Redmond could afford to give up. “I hope you will read this as it is from a friend,” wrote his brother, William, to the Prime Minister, on the 4th March 1917, three days before their showdown in Westminster. The MP for East Clare began with an attempt to rekindle warm memories: “When you entered the House I was then an old member. We fought many battles on the same side.”\n\nAs the letter went on, a slight edge of pleading crept in:\n\nI do not want anything from you but this – to settle the Irish question – you are strong enough. Give the Ulster men proportional and full representation and they cannot complain.\n\nWilliam Redmond ended with a stark warning: “If there is no settlement there will be nothing but disaster all round for all.”[7]\n\n“There is nothing I would like better to be the instrument for settling the Irish question,” Lloyd George wrote back two days later, on the 6th March. After all, as he pointed out: “I was elected to the House purely as a Home Rule candidate…and I have voted steadily for Home Rule ever since.”\n\nWhich was true enough. But he clearly did not feel the same urgency as William Redmond, nor thought the matter as simple to solve as the other man seemed to: “But you know just as well as I do what the difficulty is in settling the Irish question, and if any man can show me a way out of that I should indeed be happy.”[8]\n\nIn other words: my hands are tied, so too bad.\n\nMiracles and the Lack of\n\nAppropriately enough, after his efforts in private had been exhausted, it was William Redmond who publicly made the case before Parliament for immediate and unconditional Home Rule. He looked every bit his fifty-five years, much of which had been spent in the service of his country.\n\n“Major Redmond’s hair is white now, and he has lost much of his boyish air,” wrote one observer. “The war has deeply lined his face, and his eyes are more deeply set than in his political swashbuckling days.”[9]\n\nDressed in khaki, as befitting his rank of major in the British Army, he had stood to second T.P. O’Connor’s motion on the 7th March. To Stephen Gwynn, the MP for Galway City, “that debate will always be remembered by those who heard it for one speech” and that was William Redmond’s.[10]\n\nAt a length of half an hour, his piece was a relatively short one by the standards of the chamber. In place of the quantity of words, however, William Redmond made up for in quality. Dark and bitter mistakes had been made in the past, and not all on one side, he conceded, but there was no point in brooding on the past.\n\nInstead, he appealed directly to Edward Carson to meet with his Nationalist opposites – for the sake of the future and for the Irishmen who were, even now, fighting and dying together in the same trenches – so they could come to some arrangement on the basis of self-government for their shared island.\n\nIf safeguards were what the Ulster Unionists wanted, then Redmond promised to go to any lengths necessary to reassure them, even if that included – he suggested tantalisingly – the acceptance of a Prime Minister from Ulster to head the first Irish Government.[11]\n\nWhile there were other speeches that day, William Redmond’s was the one that counted as far as many were concerned. O’Connor could hear the heavy breathing of his fellow MPs seated around him, while others who watched from the gallery – so he was told afterwards – were so overcome with emotion that they wept and sobbed unabashedly.[12]\n\nGwynn was similarly awed. “It was a speech, in short, that made one believe in impossibilities,” as he put it, “but in Parliament no miracles happen.”[13]\n\nWhen it was clear to the chamber that Lloyd George was no closer than before in supporting an all-Ireland settlement, with Ulster included, John Redmond rose to deliver the piece de resistance of the day. The Prime Minister, he declared, had brought Ireland face to face with revolution. From now on, the country would have to be governed with an unsheathed sword and, as such, it was pointless to continue the debate.\n\nAnd, with that, reported the Irish Times:\n\nThe Nationalists cheered to the echo as their leader left his seat and stalked majestically down the gangway, and along the floor of the House. They followed him, shouting and jeering as they went, while members looked on with serious faces.[14]\n\nIf nothing else, the Irish Party still knew how to make an exit. Not that it made any real difference.\n\nWhen O’Connor and Joe Devlin, the MP for West Belfast, met Lloyd George later in the month, on the 28th March, time had done nothing to change the Prime Minister’s mind. “LG says that the Orangemen still insist on the 6 counties and was hopeless of getting them to move from that position,” O’Connor reported to John Redmond. “We told him he ought to deny them; he says he could not.”[15]\n\nDespite the uphill struggle they faced, O’Connor still kept the faith. “If [Lloyd George] persists in his whole 6-county proposal,” he told Redmond on the 1st April 1917, “he will fail ignominiously for we can tear such a proposal to tatters in the House of Commons.”[16]\n\nPerhaps, but Ireland was no longer waiting to give its representatives that chance.\n\n‘A More Reasonable Outlook’\n\nWilliam Redmond’s celebrated performance in Parliament turned out to be his swansong. “We deeply regret to learn that Major William H.K. Redmond, MP, of the Royal Irish Regiment,” reported the Irish Times on the 11th June 1917, three months later, “was killed in action on the 7th inst. in the brilliant and successful attack on the Ridge of Messines.”[17]\n\nThe uniform William Redmond had worn while in the House of Commons had been no pose. Nor was his plea for reconciliation between Nationalist and Unionist Ireland anything less than sincere. That Irish soldiers from the two traditions could fight together in the same trenches was proof enough, to him, that a better, happier future was possible together.\n\nTrue, differences remained – William Redmond was not so naïve as to think otherwise. “The soldier in France who was a home ruler at home probably remains so,” he admitted, writing publicly in May 1917. “The Ulster soldier who disapproved of home rule probably does so still”:\n\nBut the meeting of men of diverse opinions in the field has undoubtedly created an atmosphere of friendliness which must make it easier to adjust differences and which should induce a more reasonable outlook upon things at home.[18]\n\nWhen William Redmond returned to his regiment in France, in time for the push towards a German strongpoint near Messines, his main fear was that he would be held back from the Front on account of his age.\n\n“He felt absolutely miserable at the prospect of being kept behind,” remembered an army chaplain for the Royal Irish Fusiliers. “He had used every influence with General [William Bernard] Hickie to get over the top with the men”:\n\nHe spoke in the most feeling manner of what awaited the poor fellows, and longed to share their sufferings and their fate.\n\nIn that regard, he was to have his wish. When permission was given for him to join the firing-line, he informed a fellow Irish officer “with real delight and boyishness in his voice”, to the other man’s wonder: “I have never seen anyone so pleased as he was.”[19]\n\n‘Tired Out’\n\nFor his older brother, it was a particularly wounding blow. “The loss of him meant to John Redmond a loss of personal efficiency,” wrote Gwynn. “Sorrow gave a strong grip to depression on a brooding mind which had always a proneness to melancholy.” For William had been more than a sibling to John, but a counsellor too, and perhaps the sole one:\n\nHe had who temperamentally shared his own point of view. Willie Redmond was the only man who could break through his brother’s constitutional reserve and could force him into discussion. In the months that were to come such a man was badly needed.[20]\n\nJohn Redmond’s melancholia-prone mind had already been brooding for quite some time. “Redmond is very depressed,” wrote T.P. O’Connor to John Dillon, on the 18th May 1916. “He seems to be tired out and sick of the whole position and has again and again referred to the possibility of his retiring from politics.”[21]\n\nDillon, for his part, did not bother so much with sympathy. “It is touch and go whether we can save the movement and keep the Party in existence,” the MP for East Mayo admitted to O’Connor on the 19th August 1916. “A great deal depends on the extent to which the Chairman realises the position and on what his intentions as to the future are.” That “on these points I am to a large extent in the dark” did not bode well for saving their life’s work.[22]\n\nA month later, on the 26th September 1916, Dillon was even more frank to O’Connor: “Enthusiasm and trust in Redmond and the Party is dead [underlined in original text] so far as the mass of the people is concerned.”\n\nA speech Redmond made in Waterford, in October 1916, promising a tougher line in the future, gave the Constitutional cause fresh drive, as even the habitually glum Dillon agreed. To him, the speech was “all that could be desired, and it will do an incalculable amount of good. It has already had an immense effect on the country.”\n\nThere would no further negotiations with the British Government, Redmond had declared, only a demand for the release of those interned since the Easter Rising, a call for General Maxwell – his work long done in suppressing sedition – to be withdrawn from the country, and a firm resistance to any possibility of conscription in Ireland.\n\nAfter months of political deadlock, with their elected representatives appearing no more than hostages to fate, this bold new stance, in Dillon’s opinion, “took the country by surprise, and produced a great wave of reaction in favour of his leadership and of the Party. If that attitude is resolutely adhered to the country will come all right.”[23]\n\nDead Cat Bounce\n\nIf, if, if…\n\nThe great wave of reaction had receded by the start of 1917, leaving the Party as stranded as a beached whale. A by-election drubbing in North Roscommon in February – the first of the wins to Sinn Féin that year – was enough to plunge Redmond into a crisis of faith.\n\nIn a letter intended for the Party followers, Redmond acknowledged the fork on the road to which they had come. If North Roscommon was an abnormality, “a freak election, due to…momentary passion” over how the winner, Count Plunkett, had had a son executed after the Rising, then that was all well and good. But, on the other hand, should the result represent “a change of principle of policy on the part of a considerable mass of the Irish people,” then the entire future of the Constitutional cause, the raison d’être of the Irish Parliamentary Party, had just been questioned…and found wanting.\n\nIf so, then Redmond was prepared to give way graciously: “Let the Irish people replace us, by all means, by other and, I hope, better men if they so choose.”[24]\n\nThankfully for his colleagues, whose careers were hanging in the balance, Redmond was persuaded against publishing the letter. But not even a close confidant like William Redmond was immune to defeatism, as he privately urged his brother that they and all their MPs step down to make room for younger men.\n\nHaving recovered from his earlier bout of weakness, John Redmond held firm but, shortly afterwards, there was the second by-election rout of the year, this time for South Longford in May 1917. It had been a hard-fought contest, and a razor-thin difference in votes at the end, but a loss was a loss, and one sorely felt.\n\nIt was, in Gwynn’s view, “a notice of dismissal to the Parliamentary Party” on the part of the Irish people. This was not merely hindsight speaking, for shortly after South Longford, a second suggestion was made that the Party MPs resign their seats en masse and allow the country to decide on the choice before it: the constitutional way or…the other way.\n\nAgain, Redmond was adamantly against such a step down, as Gwynn described: “He said that it would be a lack of courage: that one or two defeats should not turn us from our course.”[25]\n\nThat is, if their course could still be taken. No outlet had argued harder for the IPP candidate than the Longford Leader. In the wake of bitter rejection, however, the newspaper could predict only one end for its political patrons:\n\nIt cannot be doubted that in a few years Ireland will have recovered from the present fitful fever, and see the error of its present course, but in the meantime the Irish National Party and programme will be probably a thing of the past, and the people will have only the empty husks of Sinn Féin left.[26]\n\nThat such a probability had come about at all was a source of shocked wonder to the Longford Leader, but it did not pretend to see any other. Neither did the IPP itself, not even at its top. “[John Redmond] does not seem to me to realise the situation any more than he did in the winter of 1915-1916,” Dillon wrote cuttingly to T.P O’Connor in November 1917. Come a general election, he predicted, and then “there will be nothing left in Ireland except Republican separatists and Ulster loyalists,” with the IPP confined to history.[27]\n\nHe got that right.\n\nReturn to Ireland\n\nFor some, the day that the IPP was a thing of the past could not come soon enough. When John Redmond warned Westminster that revolution was a-stir in Ireland, he had not been indulging in hyperbole, the proof of which was on full display in Dublin on the Monday morning of the 18th June 1917.\n\n“It was apparent to most citizens when they came within the heart of the city for their day’s business that there was something unusual astir,” wrote the Irish Times, adding sniffily: “The main streets were occupied by people who were not usually abroad at 10 a.m.”\n\nMarching from Westmoreland Station and up Great Brunswick Street came a procession of young men and women, who made their Sinn Féin sympathies clear with the tricoloured flags they waved, the songs they sung, and the group of men in their midst: the one hundred and twenty or so rebel POWs taken during the Easter Rising, newly released from English captivity by a general amnesty.\n\nOnwards over O’Connell Bridge, they crossed into Sackville (now O’Connell) Street, the place in which it had all began, and where the sight of the still-ruined General Post Office and other bullet-scarred buildings was enough to inspire a fresh burst of enthusiasm in the crowd. A squad of policemen shadowed the parade, carefully keeping their distance, but no incident occurred as the freed men continued on to Gardiner’s Row, inside Fleming’s Hotel for breakfast and a long-anticipated rest.\n\nAs they ate, one of their number, Seán O’Mahony, stepped out to address the adoring young acolytes waiting on the street. This, he told them, was far from the end of what had begun on the Easter Week of 1916, over a year ago but still fresh in Irish memories. He affirmed they were still fighting for the same tricoloured flag under which they had done so already in the Rising, for they believed in actions, not words, and would soon resume the great work that had already begun.\n\nAfter their rest, the released men resumed their march to the offices in Exchequer Street of the National Aid Association, set up to help alleviate their financial needs, and then to the Mansion House, followed all the way by the multitudes. Such was the press of bodies and the heat that one of the former prisoners fainted.\n\nThe day’s display complete, the men went their separate ways, at least for now. Some hurried to catch the evening trains back to their homes in the country, while others continued to be the centres of attention as the celebrations continued in Dublin. “Whenever a released Sinn Feiner, or anyone remotely suspected of being one, was observed, cheers were often raised,” reported the Irish Times.\n\nWith their close-cropped hair and conservatively-trimmed beards, it was hard to tell who was who among the freed men. Eoin MacNeill was known to be present, as was W.T. Cosgrave, along with Count Plunkett and Joe McGuinness, the two MPs elected earlier that year on behalf of Sinn Féin for North Roscommon and South Longford respectively.\n\nWorthy names, all, but the most notable one was Éamon de Valera, he who had been in command at Boland’s Mill and now continued to be so over his comrades, as demonstrated earlier that day at Kingstown [now Dun Laoghaire] Pier, when they had first lined up on the boat-deck before crossing the gangway in formation, two by two, on de Valera’s order.\n\nHis authority continued to be felt throughout the day. “There appeared to be an arrangement amongst the prisoners not to express their opinions publicly in regard to their treatment in prison,” noted the Irish Times. When asked about that, the men merely said that any official statement was to come from de Valera.[28]\n\nChoices and Omens\n\nIt was a name that would soon be on everyone’s lips, for the parliamentary seat of East Clare now lay open with William Redmond’s death, and Sinn Féin was determined to capitalise on its previous two electoral wins by adding a third. The lesson of South Longford was that Joe McGuinness had succeeded, not despite his penal status, but because of it, for Easter Week conferred nobility on a man like nothing else in the eyes of the Irish public.\n\nThe choice of another prisoner to contest East Clare was thus essential. Arthur Griffith had been making the case to the Central Election Committee for Eoin MacNeill, Chief of Staff of the Irish Volunteers. But, in that, the President of Sinn Féin stood alone. MacNeill’s fateful attempt to cancel the Rising before it could begin, with his countermanding order on Easter Sunday, was too well remembered.[29]\n\n“I want you to see to it that our people know of his treachery to us,” Tom Clarke had instructed his wife, Kathleen, during their final time together in Kilmainhaim Jail while awaiting his execution. “He must never be allowed back into the National life of the country.”[30]\n\nNot all shared this unforgiving view, but none of the Election Committee besides Griffith were about to risk such a controversial choice. De Valera seemed a far safer bet, being already regarded as the leader of the Irish POWs while they were held in Lewes Prison. But, as he and the others had not yet been released, it was unknown if he would accept the nomination if offered. The decision was thus deferred to a later date, and the Sinn Féin activists already sent to East Clare would just have to work without a name in the meantime.[31]\n\nNot that this presented too much of a problem for Dan MacCarthy, the mastermind behind the previous electoral win. If South Longford had been a battlefield in more than the political sense, with riots, stone-throwing and beatings throughout the campaign, then the next constituency was a pleasant surprise to MacCarthy: “I found the people generally more sympathetic than in Longford and I felt that this was a good omen for our cause.”\n\nThe speech he gave at Berefield Church, after the priest introduced him from the altar to the congregation, allowed him to gauge the public mood, which appeared to be a positive one. As for the identity of the man on whose behalf MacCarthy was in Clare: “Various rumours went round as far as we were concerned. One time we heard it was Peadar Clancy [another 1916 participant], and the next Eoin MacNeill, and finally it transpired to be de Valera.”[32]\n\nRoads to Take or Not to Take\n\nThe decision was not an easy one to make, not least because de Valera had been wrestling with it himself even as he took his first step back on Irish soil. Politics was a field utterly new to him, and one he regarded with some trepidation. When news had reached the Lewes inmates in April 1917 that one of their number, Joe McGuinness, was being nominated to run in the South Longford contest, de Valera was among those against any such forays in the electoral sphere.\n\nInstead, the “safest course for us and in the long run the wisest is to continue as soldiers,” he wrote to a friend on the outside. “The Irish Volunteers…must be kept a permanent force at the country’s back…and we must allow nothing to make us forget it.”[33]\n\nVictory in South Longford made de Valera and many of the others in Lewes revaluate their standoffishness where non-military methods were concerned. After all, the main issue for de Valera, as he explained in a letter to a friend, was not that politics was wrong, but that it was a gamble. “I for one would have to be almost certain of success before I would risk such a stake,” he wrote [underlined in original text].[34]\n\nSuccess seemed much more likely now, with two by-election wins under Sinn Féin’s belt, but de Valera was still weighing the options by the time of the general release. Patrick McCartan, a long-time Republican activist, found him in a pensive mood on board the ship taking the former prisoners to Dublin.\n\n“Mr de Valera had already been selected to contest County Clare in the Republican interest. He said he knew nothing about politics and did not like them,” McCartan wrote later. “He believed he could do the best work for Ireland by confining his attention to the organisation of the Irish Volunteers.” Having canvassed in South Longford, McCartan had a more contemporary view of the public mood in Ireland and counselled de Valera to wait and see it for himself before committing.[35]\n\nThe enthusiastic reception in Dublin was evidently enough for de Valera, and he decided without further ado to stand for East Clare. There were still finishing touches to be done: as de Valera was not actually a member of the party he was to represent, a session of the O’Rahilly Cumann was quickly convened in Pembroke, Dublin, to wave him in.[36]\n\nEven with that settled, another problem reared its head: the MacNeill one. While some wanted him kept away from East Clare, if not drummed out of the movement altogether, de Valera made it clear that the other man’s presence on the campaign was a condition of his own running. In the teeth of opposition, de Valera had his way, and not for the last time, in what was to be an extraordinary career.[37]\n\nStill, resentments simmered. De Valera and MacNeill were seated together on the train to Ennis, along with a number of other Sinn Féin activists, when Countess Markievicz entered. Sighting MacNeill, she gave him a piece of her mind, prompting the harried man to take his leave for another carriage. He was brought back by de Valera, who was having none of such unseemly displays.\n\n“There must be no recriminations,” he told the others sternly. That brought a measure of calm to the journey, if not quite peace, for the MacNeill controversy, and what it meant for Sinn Féin as a whole, would linger on for the better part of the year.[38]\n\nKathleen Clarke’s War\n\nFor Kathleen Clarke, these gestures of solidary towards a man she considered the worst sort of blackguard was one more reason to be troubled by the direction the revolutionary movement, for which her husband had laid down his life, was taking. “When I heard that de Valera had insisted on MacNeill accompanying him to Clare, it confirmed my fears” about what she considered “the demoralising influence of elections.”[39]\n\nParticipating in the British parliamentary system was a contentious practice in Ireland. First Charles Parnell, followed by John Redmond, had made it the centre-piece of their drive for Irish self-rule, but true-blue Republicans like Kathleen and Tom Clarke regarded playing the enemy’s game with suspicion, even hostility.\n\n“I would rather lose an election than resort to tricks to win it,” Tom Clarke had told Seán Mac Diarmada nine years earlier, in 1908. After acting as campaign organiser for Sinn Féin’s unsuccessful foray in the North Leitrim by-election, Mac Diarmada had returned to Dublin to merrily recount the cut and thrust of the contest to his friend.\n\nTom had listened to him in sombre silence before bringing the other man back down to earth. “Our cause is too sacred to be sullied with electioneering tricks,” he had scolded. A chastened Mac Diarmada promised to never again besmirch their cause like so.[40]\n\nEleven years later, and Sinn Féin was trying again, except with far grander ambitions than a single seat, and packing the clout to succeed this time, much to Kathleen Clarke’s dismay. To her, the only way forward was with the gun. All else was a distraction in her mind, but it appeared that now, with efforts now diverted into electioneering, “we might say goodbye to any more fighting.”[41]\n\nAnd that simply would not do.\n\nShe made an exception for South Longford in May 1917 – Joe McGuinness was an Easter Rising alumni, after all – and after rallying some of the other women bereaved by the Rising, such as Áine Ceannt and Margaret Pearse, Clarke threw herself into this new battle. And a battle it could be in a literal sense. While driving back into Longford town after a rally, her car and those of the others in the group were met with a hail of missiles from IPP partisans.\n\nBeing at the head of the convoy, along with the Count and Countess Plunkett, Clarke’s vehicle bore the brunt of the deluge. The Countess suffered a bloody nose from a thrown bottle, while Clarke just about escaped worse, thanks to the hard hat she was wearing, when a rock struck her head. “The only injury done was to my feelings,” she recalled. “I was mad enough to want to throw stones back at them.”\n\nThis was not an isolated incident. The lane the Sinn Féiners had to take to the hotel that served as their headquarters was dubbed ‘the Dardanelles’ because, as Clarke put it, “every time we passed it stones and bottles came flying out at us.”[42]\n\nLaying the Cards on the Table\n\nDespite the success at South Longford, Clarke remained dissatisfied, one of the many reasons being her antipathy towards those who were reaping most of the gains, however undeservedly. “After the Rising the press, alluding to it, called it a Sinn Féin Rising. This was not correct; the organisation then called Sinn Féin was not a revolutionary one, and it had been very nearly defunct.”[43]\n\nSuch misnaming conveyed instant benefits to some: “The fact that the Rising was now being called a Sinn Féin rising gave Arthur Griffith his chance, one he was quick to seize.” This despite how “the Sinn Féin which grew out of the Rising was a totally different one from that which had been in existence before the Rising.”[44]\n\nIf Griffith was suspect, then MacNeill was contemptible. Assuming de Valera had simply not been informed of his responsibility for the countermand, Clarke decided to enlighten him with an invitation to her house in Dundrum, Dublin, for both him and MacNeill, on the 28th July 1917. When they arrived, Clarke was ready with her case for the prosecution:\n\nI told him of the instructions I had received from Tom in Kilmainhaim Jail, that MacNeill must not be permitted to come back into the National life of the country again, for if he was he would in a crisis again act treacherously. I had promised to carry out these instructions if I could.\n\nThe sole reason she was hesitating to do just that, she explained, was because of his arrest following the Rising, which bestowed on him a credibility she could not touch. Having said that, she continued:\n\nCircumstances might still tie my hands, and I might not be able to carry out my promise to my husband, but the story of his treachery would not die with me, that I would write it and leave it as documentary proof against him.\n\nAnd, with that, the interview mercifully drew to an end, Clarke having laid down the gauntlet to MacNeill. De Valera had listened attentively throughout while keeping – the consummate politician already – his thoughts to himself.[45]\n\nSacred Principle?\n\nClarke would have been even less thrilled if she knew how close her béte noire had become with the rising star of Sinn Féin. Since their release from Lewes Prison, the two men had been conversing a good deal, and MacNeilll was pleased to learn that the other’s worldview was broadly in line with his own. For the likes of Clarke, it was the Republic or nothing, while MacNeill had only scorn for those “obsessed with the notion that some sort of sacred principle underlay the Republican ideal.”[46]\n\nMacNeill took a more libertarian view. For him, “real freedom consisted in the power to do your own things in your own way and not in any paper definition or a constitutional formula.”[47]\n\nHe was careful not to appear too broad-minded, however. When asked for his opinion on which independence policy to pursue, he was as happy as anyone to declare in favour of a Republic, though more out of pragmatism than any deep-seated commitment, as he put it:\n\nIt was a matter of comparative indifference for the time what form this independence ought to take so far as I knew there was no practical prospect of setting up an Irish monarchy, and the alternative was an Irish Republic.\n\nIn private discussions with de Valera, shortly before the pair set off for East Clare, MacNeill came to believe that the other man “was no more than I was myself, a doctrinaire republican.” Nonetheless, de Valera could appreciate the emotional value of a bold approach, and “urged on me…that the demand for an Irish Republic would present a stronger appeal to the electorate and the public than anything else less definite.”[48]\n\nAnd so, on that agreed basis, “we fought the Clare Election as Republicans without any qualifications” and won by a steep majority.[49]\n\nWinning the Argument\n\nThat by-election, and the subsequent one for Kilkenny City a month later, in August 1917, put MacNeill in the front-line for the struggle for Ireland’s soul. He was assisted in this by Dan MacCarthy, the Sinn Féin Director of Elections, who, having honed his craft in South Longford and East Clare, knew how to run a tight ship. “His method was very thorough and efficient,” MacNeill noted approvingly:\n\nAll of us who were understood to be engaged in the work were supplied, each one, with his own programme for the day, handed to him that morning or the evening before. He was told who was to accompany him, to what places he was to go, and what particular person he was to interview.\n\nUnder MacCarthy’s direction, MacNeill was dispatched to court “the hard chaws, old unionists and stiff supporters of the Parliamentary Party”, perhaps because, as a former college professor, he would present a reassuringly respectable emissary, as well as one who could handle himself in a debate. When a local worthy in Kilkenny posed to him if it was honourable for one who had already sworn an oath of allegiance to the British monarch to support an Irish Republic, MacNeill asked if he had MPs or army officers in mind.\n\nBoth, was the reply.\n\nThinking quickly on his feet, MacNeill took each point in turn. With regard to the first, he drew on the case of the 1689 rebellion, when James II had been overthrown in favour of the current line of succession, so what worth was an oath there? As for the second, he simply, but effectively, pointed to the example of George Washington.\n\n“I had the best of the argument but,” MacNeill conceded, “I do not think I got the vote.”[50]\n\nNot that it mattered too much, as Sinn Féin won the seat by another landslide. That made four straight defeats for the once-almighty IPP. Flushed with success and warmed by the camaraderie of the campaign-trail, Sinn Féin enjoyed its halcyon days, which were to make for some bittersweet memories when MacNeill looked back on them.\n\n“The spirit of good order and good humour that animated the whole body of adherents of Sinn Féin at that time,” he wrote, “offers a strange contrast to what was experienced after 1921.”[51]\n\nConflict…\n\nSchism almost came early. If Clarke and MacNeill each represented the principled and the pragmatic wings in Sinn Féin, then it was a tenuous balance, one which threatened to tip over from disagreements behind closed doors to an open split. This had almost occurred earlier in the year, in April 1917, at the Mansion House, Dublin, during the ‘Plunkett Convention’, when Griffith and Count George Plunkett shared the stage – to almost ruinous effect.\n\nThe latter, who had had one son executed after the Rising and with another two in prison, “was impatient of temperate men or means.” If Plunkett blew hot, then Griffith, in contrast:\n\nSat there like a sphinx, square and solid, like a man of granite, lacking charm – physically or mentality. Griffith had a mind of ice that could freeze Irish histrionic champagne solid. He was the one cold fact in a sea of fantasy.\n\nWhich earned him few friends, particularly among the Irish Volunteers, many of whom “disliked and scorned him.” Proof of such feelings soon manifested on the platform in the form of Plunkett’s undisguised anger at the other man, and only a disruption in the audience – when Volunteers on standby manhandled journalists scribbling away in their notebooks, thinking them to be police detectives – gave enough of a break in the proceedings for a truce between Griffith and Plunkett for the rest of the event.[52]\n\nBut it seemed only a matter of time before another confrontation and maybe not one that could be so easily dispelled. If the ideal of the Republic was what held the movement together, it could also, conversely, tear it asunder, and Griffith was reluctant to move in too dramatic a direction, lest the ‘middle ground’ of Irish opinion be alienated just when Sinn Féin was poised to win it over.[53]\n\nWith that in mind, Sinn Féin activists in the East Clare election were warned to avoid mentioning the Republic to prospective voters…that is, until their candidate publicly declared for such a goal. The listeners roared their approval at de Valera’s words to the extent that “it was a considerable time before he could resume his speech,” recalled one witness, who was aware of what certain others in the party really thought:\n\nThe Sinn Féin members of the election committee were very annoyed, but they were not prepared to come to grips with de Valera, and, if his action was commented upon at a committee which followed the public were not aware of any disagreement.[54]\n\nAnother insider present in East Clare, the trade unionist William O’Brien, noted how:\n\nIn the course of the election campaign, there was a very sharp division between the speakers. De Valera proclaimed his objective to be the Republic, stating that personally that was the only objective he could stand for. Griffith, Milroy and others took the point of view of the old Sinn Féin organisation.[55]\n\nAnd yet, despite such differences, de Valera and Griffith seemed to get along on a personal level, far better, in any case, than the latter did with the likes of Count Plunkett or Kathleen Clarke. De Valera, Griffith confided to friends during the course of the Clare election, was to be the future leader of Sinn Féin. As well as being younger, Griffith said in another talk, de Valera was a soldier – no small virtue in the current times – and had, in his opinion, all the makings of a statesman.[56]\n\nWhich gave some hope for an amiable resolution that would allow Sinn Féin to move forward – that is, if nothing too disastrous struck in the meantime.\n\nThat something almost occurred over Kilkenny, with MacNeill as the trigger, when a by-election was announced upon the death of its MP, Pat O’Brien, in July 1917. Despite the lingering controversy over his countermanding order, MacNeill enjoyed a measure of support in Sinn Féin’s grassroots, such as in the Kilkenny Club which wrote to the Dublin headquarters in favour of nominating him to run.\n\nWhen the Central Executive replied that it would prefer W.T. Cosgrave, whose CV as a Rising combatant and former prisoner made him a more comfortable choice, “we received an indignant reply that they were not to be dictated to by Dublin and they were sending a deputation to Mr MacNeill asking him to stand.”\n\n…And Resolution\n\nSo remembered Tommy Dillon. As son-in-law to Count Plunkett, Dillon was able to sit in on Executive meetings and so understood the strength of feeling to be found there. While he had nothing personal against MacNeill, certainly not to the extent that Clarke did, he was aware of how “the leaders of the anti-MacNeill group were…influential and the possibility of factions arising could not be ignored” should the question be pushed too far.\n\nIt was with this danger in mind that Dillon hurriedly cycled to Jury’s Hotel in Dublin, shortly after the last testy message from Kilkenny, to head off the threatened deputation. Upon reaching the hotel, he was told that the Kilkenny visitors had already left and so he rode on to where he guessed they had gone: the house in Rathfarnham where MacNeill was residing:\n\nWhen I arrived at the house, a taxi stood in the front grounds. I asked for [MacNeill] and was told that he was engaged. James [MacNeill’s brother], however, brought him out to me and when I told him the object of my visit he said that the Kilkenny deputation was with him, that he understood the situation and that he was about to refuse their invitation.\n\nMacNeill made no mention in his memoirs of this deputation or of Dillon’s last minute intervention. It is possible to suspect, if one were to be cynical, that MacNeill may not have been ‘about to refuse’ like he said, which Dillon did him the favour of believing. Sinn Féin was able to proceed smoothly in Kilkenny, with Cosgrave on its ticket, to score another unambiguous win.[57]\n\nBut it could not be ‘touch and go’ for the movement indefinitely, and the upcoming Sinn Féin Árd Fheis, set for October 1917 at the Mansion House, Dublin, seemed the best opportunity to finally bury the hatchet over who ordered what for Easter Week. Which was what some dreaded. A few days beforehand, Countess Markievicz visited Kathleen Clarke’s house in Dundrum to ask her to oppose MacNeill should he be nominated for the new Executive.\n\nHaving been ‘advised’ – as she put it – by some against such an act, Clarke declined, while warning the Countess that if she was to lead the anti-MacNeill charge herself, she would do so alone. Never one to be deterred by the odds, Markievicz waited for the Árd Fheis to open and then “stood up and attacked [MacNeill] on the question of the secret countermanding orders.”\n\nTo Clarke’s dismay:\n\nHer attack got such a bitterly hostile reception that despite my decision not to support her, I got up and did so. It seemed to me that the meeting was so hostile to her for attacking MacNeill that if there had been rotten eggs or anything else handy they would have been flung at her.[58]\n\nThe moderates had their way, and MacNeill was duly voted to the Executive. Sinn Féin had come a long way since its conception in 1905, to the extent that one of the delegates, Áine Ceannt – widow of the 1916 martyr – wondered out loud if the proceedings should be classed as the first Árd Fehis of a totally new organisation. All the same, it was decided to stick with it being the sixth such event for a continuous Sinn Féin – why bring in unnecessary complications, after all?[59]\n\nUnconvention\n\nFor things were complicated enough as they were. The Sinn Féin delegate for South Mayo, Patrick Moylett, had attended a secret meeting of the Irish Volunteers on the evening before the Árd Fheis. Handed to him was a list of names who were to have his vote when proposed for election to the Sinn Féin Executive.\n\nAn indignant Moylett replied:\n\n…that if I were to act on his instruction I would be defranchising [sic] the people who sent me and not doing my duty to them. I objected to the fact that in a democratic institution I should be told how I was to vote.[60]\n\nSinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers were two groups normally in lockstep but, even so, not without moments of disjunction. When the time came the next day for the Executive election at the Árd Fheis, a number of delegates interrupted to announce how they had been canvassed beforehand with such lists, their disapproval of this chicanery made publicly clear.\n\n“I wish to associate myself strongly with what has just been said by the previous speakers,” de Valera said, simultaneously supportive while keen to avoid fingers being pointed at a time of supposed unity. “Those who are responsible had probably the very best motives in view, but when we are beginning – as we are – a new Ireland, it will not be necessary to resort to such methods in future.”\n\n“The sense of the convention is strongly condemnatory of any attempt to run tickets,” added Griffith as president. “If that system were allowed to go on, it would destroy the movement in a few years.”[61]\n\nWith that said, the election went ahead, resulting in the appointment of the twenty-four members of the new Executive, along with a change of presidency in the form of de Valera, by unanimous consent when the two other contenders, Griffith and Count Plunkett, as per a prior agreement between them, had the good grace – and political nous – to step back.\n\nIn doing so, “a split between the extremists and the moderate section was narrowly averted,” wrote the police report for October. Which was one more worry for the Inspector-General, Joseph Bryce, to give to his employers in Dublin Castle:\n\nThe state of political unrest…continued without abatement during the Month, and a marked advance in organization was made by the seditious Sinn Fein movement.\n\nIf the Sinn Féin of old under Griffith had been of the moderate persuasion, then now “the majority of Sinn Fein leaders owe their present prominence to active participation in the late rising” with the same zealotry carried over. De Valera was a case in point: from being an obscure teacher, he was now instructing an audience in Co. Clare, with the air of a general marshalling his troops, to ready themselves for an opportune moment to strike again.\n\nOther speeches from Sinn Féin figures were of a similar calibre and, in light of such blatant calls to sedition, Bryce warned:\n\nIt is obvious that several are prepared to plunge the country into another rebellion should a favourable opportunity occur, and that the whole movement must be regarded as a serious menace to the state.\n\nAnd yet, at the same time, “the majority of the adherents of Sinn Fein are believed to be averse to physical force.” For all the talk of war and rebellion repeated, “it will be noticed that drilling activity [of the Irish Volunteers] is so far confined to the S.W. area.”[62]\n\nAlpha to Omega, Omega to Alpha\n\nThis ambiguity over violence was reflected in the Árd Fheis when Father O’Meehan, as one of the delegates, proposed an amendment to the Sinn Féin constitution: that the words “means available”, in regards to obtaining Irish freedom, were to be followed by “deemed legitimate and effective.”\n\nBy ‘legitimate’ I mean not according to British rule in Ireland, but according to well-established etheral [?] and Christian principles. Our enemies would, for instance, be glad to say that assassination comes under this, and it is in order to prevent them saying that that I move this addendum.\n\nIn case such talk smacked too much of Redmondite ways, “I did not use the word ‘Constitutional’ because that has a bad flavour,” the priest added, earning himself a round of applause.\n\nThe proposed change was ultimately withdrawn. Opposing it had been Cathal Brugha, one of the more militant Republicans in the hall. Nothing in their constitution as it stood would lend itself to the interpretation that so concerned Father O’Meehan, Brugha insisted. In any case, the point was moot, as “we do not intend to meet English rule by assassination,” he said firmly.[63]\n\nAs for a second Rising, that possibility, when raised, was met with laughter.[64]\n\nIf constitutional flavours left a sour taste, and with the other end of the spectrum still too strong to stomach, how then was Sinn Féin to proceed? Father Gaynor hoped to answer this when he next rose to speak. “I have come here as a delegate with the sympathy of the men from Clare to move that we do not set up a political organisation,” he said, “and we have come here in the hope that we will find something better to do.”\n\nInstead of following in the footsteps of the Irish Parliamentary Party with another political machine, Gaynor urged, the convention must establish nothing less than a ruling body with a mandate for the whole country. In doing so:\n\nWe should make the position straight by showing that we do not want a Sinn Féin party versus the Irish Party, but a Provisional Government versus Dublin Castle and the British Government.\n\nWhich was rather putting the cart before the horse, as many of the other attendees in the hall pointed out. For all the lofty proclamations of nationhood and the Republic, there still remained the gritty task of earning the right to speak for Ireland.\n\n“This organisation is a national organisation in the broadest sense of the term but, all the same, it cannot be regarded as a constituent assembly,” de Valera pointed out. “Surely we have got beyond the stage where politics should be regarded as roguery and politicians as rogues.”\n\nOthers would have disagreed. But, while the likes of young Todd Andrews, as he watched John Redmond being hounded in the streets, may have dismissed politicians as a low and dirty breed, Sinn Féin was nonetheless nearing the point where, in beating the system, you become the system.[65]\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Milroy, Seán.

He went so far as to make a wager with his second-in-command that not only would they fail, but the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State, in whose service they were about to risk their lives, would lose the war. O’Connor doubted they would last more than a few days.\n\nThe reasons, as he explained to the other man, were obvious:\n\nWe numbered 800 all ranks, the second Eastern division was 500, with 200 from Kilkenny and it was reckoned we would have 1000 men available in Dublin. To oppose this force the Irregulars had in Dublin an estimated force of 3000 men, and there was in the country a force of 20,000 to 30,000 Irregulars.\n\nFurthermore, O’Connor thought it implausible that the anti-Treaty leadership would be stupid enough to allow themselves to be boxed in the Four Courts. In addition to the garrison there, several other units of the Dublin IRA (Irish Republican Army) who opposed the Treaty were positioned about the city and would surely challenge them every step of the way. Nonetheless, O’Connor pushed aside such doubts when the time came at midnight to move out.\n\nUrban combat was nothing new to him. An experienced soldier, O’Connor had cut his martial teeth against the British during the War of Independence, learning as he did so the value of caution. He accordingly moved his battalion in a piecemeal manner, allowing time to pass before the next unit advanced. Any ambush on the way would not find his charges bunched up as targets.\n\nAnd yet, as the soldiers advanced through the dark, deserted streets, the resistance O’Connor was anticipating to find never materialised. There was a spark of alarm when a shot went off in Clanbrassil Street but that turned out to be an accident by one of his men. Contrary to his fears, the way to the Four Courts had been left entirely open to them.\n\nComing Right in the End\n\nStill, O’Connor would not be claiming that wager just yet. His battalion continued over the Liffey to Smithfield, west of the Four Courts, while the other units allocated to the operation took up their own assigned posts, until the target was surrounded. In the Four Courts Hotel, sitting westwards of its namesake, Commandant Paddy Daly would direct the proceedings.\n\nO’Connor could see that the Free State soldiers in the match factory opposite the Four Courts’ record office had been able to barricade their windows unmolested, with the Anti-Treatyites facing them doing nothing to interfere. But, if the enemy had been bizarrely complacent before, that stopped when the boom of an artillery gun signalled the start of the attack.\n\nAlmost as if waiting for such a provocation, the Four Courts garrison unleashed a storm of their own, to O’Connor’s horror:\n\nThe echo of the 18 Pounder had scarcely died away when every weapon at their command was discharged in to the factory windows. The fire was so heavy the flash of fire lit up the room almost as brilliantly as the street light before it splintered into a thousand fragments in the first few seconds. The intense fire punctured the tanks on the roof and deluged the room.\n\nSeeing that they had been temporarily outgunned, O’Connor called on his men to withdraw to a more sheltered area of the factory.\n\nDespite this small victory, the garrison could do little but stay pinned in place while the Free State ordnance pounded away. The barricades in the Four Courts’ windows were methodically dismantled by a Lewis machine-gun that tore into the lower tier of sandbags until they collapsed, taking the ones on top with them.[1]\n\nWhen the rotunda was struck, those beneath its dome felt themselves stretched up to their full length by the shockwave before coming back down again, along with the debris that showered them. When one asked Liam Mellows how long the war was going to last, he had no easy answer to give. “It will last a long time.”\n\n“Will it last five years?” the other ventured.\n\n“Oh, no, it will last much more than that,” Mellows said. “But they’ll come right in the end.”[2]\n\nDie Hard Chiefs\n\nWhen an 18-Pounder of theirs blew through the records office wall, it was decided among the Free State command that the time had come to storm the building. First, though, an attempt at a negotiated surrender was made.\n\nAs O’Connor recalled:\n\nIt was a most unusual ceasefire; the bugler sounded the call outside the Brigade command post, the Four Courts Hotel and each bugler took up the call until bugle calls were being sounded all around the area. The silence that followed was unbroken and one found that one instinctively lowered his voice to a whisper when speaking.\n\nThe anti-Treaty IRA leadership, or the ‘Die Hard Chiefs’ as O’Connor dubbed them, were willing to listen but no more than that. Mellows, Rory O’Connor, Joe McKelvey and Seán MacBride stood at the gates of the Four Courts as their Free State counterparts conveyed the terms. As these were for unconditional surrender, they were instantly rejected. With nothing else to say, the two sides proceeded to pass the rest of the parley with idle chit-chat.\n\n“When are you coming in with us, Paddy?” Mellows asked Paddy Daly.\n\n“Tomorrow, with the bayonets,” replied a tactless Daly, chilling the previously amiable mood.\n\n“Call yourself an Irishman,” MacBride snapped.\n\n“I don’t know, but I did not have to write letters to the papers to prove I was,” Daly retorted, referring to the French-reared MacBride’s public assertion of his Irishness. McKelvey had to take an enraged MacBride by the arm and practically pull him away.\n\n“Good night, Paddy,” Mellows said to Padraig O’Connor.\n\n“Good night, Liam.”\n\nAnd that was that. The men returned to their respective posts and the buglers called again, this time to announce the resumption of the barrage. “The din was awful for a while and then it steadied down to an occasional shot,” O’Connor wrote in his memoirs. He was finding that one could get used to just about anything.[3]\n\nA Purity of Purpose\n\nAs the days stretched from the 28th June to the 30th, it occurred to the men inside the Four Courts that the new Dáil, elected by the general election earlier in the month, was due to meet. When Ernie O’Malley asked if there were any TDs among them, Peadar O’Donnell mentioned Mellows and wondered if he would give them to a speech to mark the occasion.[4]\n\nIn this, O’Donnell was wrong, as Mellows had failed to be re-elected. At the time, it had been regarded by some as a particularly shocking rejection on the part of an ungrateful electorate. “Deputies who had served the nation with unquestioning fidelity and purity of purpose are excluded from the Government of the Republic which they helped to create and defend,” lamented Poblacht Na h-Eireann, the mouthpiece of the anti-Treaty cause. “We need mention no other name than that of Liam Mellows to show how far the nation has departed from the spirit of the last four years.”[5]\n\nThere were, in any case, more immediate matters for the Four Courts’ defenders to be concerned about. The munitions block had been on fire for some time, the crackling flames creeping down from the roof to the lower storeys. Afraid that the ammunition might detonate at any moment, the defenders hastily withdrew into the rest of the complex, taking some solace in that the fire would serve to keep the enemy at bay as well.\n\nO’Malley was waiting in the yard, by the front entrance, while eyeing a nearby Lancia lorry as a potential target, when he was thrown against the iron bars of the gate by the force of an explosion. The fire had reached the munitions as feared. Fragments of stone and wood and scraps of paper came down in a charred hail, while a thick column of smoke rose from where the munitions block had been.\n\nBullets began ringing off the bars O’Malley was sheltering behind, accompanied by the smaller percussions of grenades being hurled against the walls or into the yard. O’Malley wisely chose to dash back inside the building.\n\nThe interior was in a scarcely better condition, its corridors and rooms littered with broken masonry and smouldering records, but it afforded some protection for now. When O’Malley found Rory O’Connor and Joe McKelvey in conversation, O’Connor called him over and said that the time had come to surrender. What ammunition that had not just gone up in smoke was in short supply, escape through the flooded sewers was impossible and whatever help there was outside did not seem in any hurry to arrive.\n\nThese were not facts O’Malley could deny. But that did not make them any easier to accept. He asked Mellows, who was peering at them through a shell-blown hole in the wall, what he thought.\n\n“The Republic is being attacked here,” Mellows replied. “We must stand or fall by it. If we surrender now, we have deserted it.”\n\n‘The Wilderness of the Treaty’\n\nIn this, he and O’Malley were in full accord. McKelvey, O’Connor and some of the other Headquarters staff were not so sure. Neither was Father Albert Bibby, a Franciscan monk who had come to grant them absolution. Nobody had any idea at the time about how pointed a weapon the power to bestow – or deny – this blessing would become.\n\nWith his brown robes and sandaled feet, Father Albert struck an incongruously medieval figure amidst the sound and fury of modern warfare. He preached to them the example of Patrick Pearse who had surrendered to save lives, but entreaties fell on the deaf ears of Mellows and O’Malley.\n\nWhen O’Connor and McKelvey tried raising the subject once more, Mellows was adamant: “I’ve already told you what I thought, and still think.”[6]\n\nIt was the Easter Week of 1916 all over again. Then, Mellows had stood unmoved in an old abandoned country house in Co. Galway while another man of the cloth, Father Thomas Fahy, urged him to see the necessity of surrender. Pearse had already done so in Dublin, and Fahy invoked his name in support of such a step – as Father Bibby would do six years later – but Mellows had remained closed to any argument but his own, even while the certainty of those around him crumbled, and the choice slipped out of his hands.[7]\n\nBetter to live to fight another day, so decided the Galway Volunteers, as they voted to disband and return to their homes. Even then, Mellows had preferred to go on the run than submit – but that was not an option in the Four Courts, encircled as it was by Free State guns. O’Malley began to cry as even he bowed to the inevitable, but Mellows merely went along with the rest.[8]\n\nAt 3:30 pm on the 30th June, a white flag was waved. Half an hour later, the one hundred and forty men who made up the garrison came out with their hands raised. With barely a word said, the beaten men were lined up against a wall and divided into groups, to be driven off in lorries to Mountjoy Jail.\n\nDespite the relative silence of the proceedings, the battle for the Four Courts finished, not with a whimper but with a bang when, just after 5 pm, the back of the structure was rocked by a massive detonation. The fire had reached the ammunition stocks there and the results could be seen in the column of black smoke rising a hundred feet in the air, and felt in the debris of dust and charred scraps of paper that scattered about the surrounding area.\n\nThis was not yet the end, as a further series of blasts continued within the Four Courts, thwarting the efforts of firemen to save what was left of the historic building and forcing the would-be rescuers back, some with injures from the falling stone and metal fragments. It was not until evening that the nearby inhabitants felt safe enough to venture out on to the pavements.[9]\n\nThe drama was done – for now. For, even as he and his comrades were marched away to captivity, Mellows continued to take the long view. “There’s one thing this will do,” he told O’Donnell beside him. “They’ll save the people from wandering about for a guardian in the wilderness of the Treaty.”[10]\n\n‘Striking and Vapouring’\n\nIt was a defiant response to the shame of surrender, and one typical of Mellows: impassioned, implacable and infused with a self-righteousness that left no room for the possibility that maybe, just maybe, he bore some responsibility for the debacle.
