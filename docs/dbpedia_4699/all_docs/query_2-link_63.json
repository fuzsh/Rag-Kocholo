        "text": "What we do\n\nThe Northern and Western Regional Assembly aims to play a transformative role in the success of our region. Our Vision is to craft a creative, vibrant and low-carbon regional economy. Our members and team simply want to ‘connect’ the strengths of this incredible region and celebrate its unique sense of place. The Assembly is intent on leading Ireland into 2040.\n\nOur objectives are clear. The Regional Assembly is intent on adopting international best practice in planning & development in order to create BETTER PLACES. Underpinning this approach is the commitment to enhancing COMPETITIVENESS through policies that build resilience and sustainability, working with our stakeholders to utilise EU & Exchequer funding. Achieving this will be done through a dedicated and principled approach to COLLABORATION.\n\nThe Regional Assembly has a vision to enhance our region’s competitiveness through ‘CONNECTING’ and building on our strengths. The Regional Assembly is playing a lead role in the success story of this region.\n\nWho we are\n\nThe Northern & Western Regional Assembly (NWRA) was established on 1st January 2015. The Border, Midland and Western Regional Assembly was established in 1999, one of two Regional Assemblies established to give effect to the division of the country into two regions for EU Structural Funds purposes.\n\nUnder the Local Government Reform Act 2014 a number of changes were made to the regional structures in Ireland. The eight regional authorities were dissolved on 1st June 2014 and their functions and staff were transferred to the Regional Assemblies. Subsequently three Regional Assemblies were established on 1st January 2015 – the NWRA, the Eastern & Midlands Regional Assembly and the Southern Regional Assembly. Together the Regional Assemblies form a strong regional structure that strengthens the development of Ireland’s regions in a co-ordinated, strategic manner.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Headquarters of the NWRA is located in Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon and we have a workforce of 18 people.\n\nThe NWRA is comprised of 25 elected Members nominated by the 9 local authorities within the region. The NWRA covers eight counties – Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal, Monaghan, Mayo and Cavan and works closely with the nine local authorities (Galway City Council and Galway County Council cover one county) who manage these counties."
