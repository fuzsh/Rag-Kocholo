        "text": "Most of the women who took part in the 1916 insurrection never found their way into the history books. In recent decades, several historians, mostly women, have worked to change that.\n\nHere are some of the women who chose to fight for an Irish republic and a fairer society.\n\nKathleen Lynn, a doctor, gave medical training to recruits to the Irish Citizen Army, a paramilitary organization, and allowed her home to be used as a munitions store. She served as the Chief Medical Officer during the Rising, famously describing herself as “a Red Cross doctor and a belligerent” when arrested.\n\nMs. Lynn went on to co-found St. Ultan’s Hospital for Infants.\n\nArmed with a typewriter and a Webley revolver, Ms. Carney was aide-de-camp to James Connolly, a socialist leader, in the rebellion’s headquarters in the General Post Office.\n\nWhen Connolly was wounded in action (he would later be carried to his execution on a stretcher), Ms. Carney ignored orders to evacuate and stayed with him until after the surrender.\n\nBorn into the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, Countess Markievicz was the only woman sentenced to death for her role in the Rising. Her sentence was later commuted to life in prison because of her gender and she was ultimately released in an amnesty in 1917.\n\nIn 1918 she was the first woman elected to the British Parliament, but refused to take her seat; instead she became the only woman to hold a cabinet position, as Minister of Labor, in the first Irish Assembly. The countess died, virtually penniless, in 1927.\n\nScottish schoolteacher Margaret Skinnider quit her job in the spring of 1916 to take part in the rebellion. (On an earlier trip to Ireland, in 1915, she reportedly smuggled detonators under her hat.)\n\nDuring the Rising Ms. Skinnider, a member of a shooting club in Scotland, served as a sniper — in the same garrison as the Countess Markievicz — and was shot three times. When she recovered she returned to work as a teacher and campaigner for women’s rights. She is buried in Dublin next to Countess Markievicz.\n\nElizabeth O’Farrell was a member of the Daughters of Ireland (Inghinidhe na hEireann), a radical republican women’s group that pledged to fight for the complete separation of Ireland and Britain. She acted as a dispatcher during the Rising and tended to the wounded in the rebellion’s headquarters in the G.P.O.\n\nMs. O’Farrell was chosen by Padraig Pearse, the spokesman for the rebels, to deliver the surrender notice to the British. As well as being airbrushed from the photo of the surrender taken later with Pearse, Ms. O’Farrell was omitted from Neil Jordan’s 1996 biopic “Michael Collins.” In that film, the surrender note was delivered by a man.\n\nAs the wife of Thomas Clarke — a signatory to the Proclamation of an Irish Republic, which promulgated Ireland’s independence from Britain — Kathleen Clarke was one of the few women privy to the secret plans for the Rising. Her husband forbade her to take part, however, saying that she would be needed to administer financial aid to the dependents of dead rebels once the rebellion was over.\n\nMs. Clarke endured the triple loss of her husband, brother (Ned Daly) and close friend (Sean MacDiarmada) — all of whom faced the firing squad after the Rising was quashed. She went on to become the first female lord mayor of Dublin, in 1939.\n\nBorn into a working class Dublin family, Rosie Hackett co-founded the Irish Women Workers Union to combat the deplorable conditions endured by the female employees of Jacob’s Biscuit Factory. She was part of the group that produced the first print of the Proclamation of an Irish Republic.\n\nMary Mulcahy, a courier during the Rising, was the girlfriend of one of its architects, Sean MacDiarmada. She was with him in his cell in Kilmainham Jail before his execution. She later married another republican soldier, Richard Mulcahy, and the couple named one of their sons Sean."
