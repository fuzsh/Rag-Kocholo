        "text": "Margaret Skinnider & the INTO – Vere Foster Lecture, Belfast 2016\n\nIt’s great to see the publication of a new book on Margaret Skinnider by Mary McAuliffe. Best known for her participation in the 1916 Rising, Margaret Skinnider was, among other things, an active member of the INTO and it was a real pleasure to spend time with her, virtually, in the archives. Her contribution to the INTO was marked in 2016 when I gave an address to the Easter congress and I was invited to give a longer version at the annual Vere Foster lecture in Belfast.\n\nMaighréad Ní Scinneadóra 1892-1971\n\nOn 16 May 1916, the Times of London published a letter from the Provost of Trinity College Dublin, JP Mahaffy. After criticising John Dillon for a speech in the Commons on the rising he turned his sights on the Sinn Féiners themselves, before turning his attention to the people Mahaffy thought responsible for the rebellion in the first place.\n\n‘There has been throughout the national schools a propaganda of hatred to England on the part of the schoolmasters living on the salary of the Imperial government,’ he asserted, ‘The rising generation have been so carefully soaked in disloyal sentiments that the large majority of the population is now against Imperial law and order.’\n\nSo began the notion of the Easter Rising as ‘the schoolmasters’ rebellion’, which is often misunderstood to refer to the participation of teachers in the planning and execution of the rising.\n\nSuperficially, it might seem as though teachers were especially active, with Pearse and MacDonagh – and though it is little known Tom Clarke taught briefly in a school in Dungannon – but there were actually very few national teachers out in Easter Week. Because of Mahaffy’s accusations, the Board of National Education, which oversaw Irish primary schools, investigated the extent of their involvement.\n\nOn 21 July 1916, the Board issued a statement to the press summing up the results of its inquiries, namely that\n\ntwo or three instances of disloyal teaching [had] been brought under notice and these charges are being investigated, but no evidence has been adduced which would warrant the conclusion that seditious teaching in the national schools exists to any appreciable extent.\n\nIn a teaching body of 5,700 men, the Commissioners noted, only ten had been imprisoned, which hardly supported a charge of general disloyalty.\n\nIn a teaching body of 5,700 men.\n\nSignificantly, the Commissioners did not regard the women teachers as a possible source of sedition. This was quite mistaken.\n\nThomas Ashe, the principal from Corduff NS who died on hunger strike in 1917, is probably the best known INTO member from Easter Week, but lately his status is rivalled by that of Margaret Skinnider, who fought with the Citizen Army in the College of Surgeons during Easter Week.\n\nMiss Skinnider is one of the women sometimes referred to mistakenly as the ‘forgotten women of 1916’. If she, and others, were less well remembered than some of the leaders of the rising in more recent years, she was certainly not forgotten when she was alive.\n\nHer participation in the Rising was well-known, she wrote a propaganda memoir in 1917 called Doing my bit for Ireland in which she very matter of factly describes the events of Easter week as she experienced them.\n\nMargaret Skinnider has become better known once again in recent years, partly as a result of efforts to bring the participation of women to the fore, but this evening, as well as looking at her participation in the Easter Rising, I want to give an overview of her an important figure in Irish public life and especially as a teacher and trade union activist.\n\nWhen Margaret Skinnider took part in the Easter Rising, she was working as a maths teacher in St Agnes School in Lambhill, Glasgow. She was born in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, Scotland in May 1892 to James Skinnider from County Monaghan and Jane Doud from Renfrewshire in Scotland. Raised in Maryhill Glasgow, she was the second youngest of six siblings, she spent summer holidays with her father’s family outside Monaghan when she was younger. She had developed an interest in Irish history at the age of 12 but was also acutely conscious of the sectarianism and anti-Irish feeling in Glasgow growing up.\n\nLike many women of the time – and many women in the nationalist movement – she became politically active through the women’s suffrage movement and was a member of the Women’s Social and Political Union. She said she was known to the police locally as a militant suffragette, and she attended protests in support of suffragettes imprisoned in Perth Prison in 1914. It was around this time that she joined the Irish Volunteers and the Anne Devlin branch of Cumman na mBan when it was set up in Glasgow in mid-1915. She started attending a rifle club, set up to teach women to shoot in the event of a German invasion, and became a very good shot. She didn’t refer to it in her memoir, but it seems her first bit of active service took place in October 1915 in an unsuccessful effort to raid the Admiralty Yard in Glasgow for arms, where she was one of three Cumann na mBan posing as girl friends to three Volunteers so as not to arouse suspicion. Though the Volunteers successfully made it into the yard, all they managed to find was a fire extinguisher. If they were unsuccessful on that occasion, the Glasgow contingent did manage to procure some explosives all the same. A few months later, at Christmas 1915, Miss Skinnider travelled over on the boat to Dublin, wearing a three-cornered hat, with a detonator hidden in each corner and the wires curled around her under her coat. She spent much of the voyage sitting on the deck of the ship because she was afraid if she ran into a hot-water pipe or an electric wire, that might set them off. Instead she fell asleep on deck, using her hat as a pillow, only learning afterwards that this was even more dangerous.\n\nShe was travelling over to Dublin at the invitation of Madam Markievicz who had heard of this young lady in Glasgow and asked her over to stay in her house on Leinster Road for the Christmas holidays. After she arrived in Dublin, she and Madam went to the Dublin mountain to test the detonators.\n\nMarkievicz, who took this young woman, some thirty years her junior quite under her wing. You can imagine the impression that this aristocratic, bohemian woman thirty years her senior had on the 23 year old maths teacher from Glasgow. It was not that the fearless and serious Miss Skinnider was over-awed, but she was hugely impressed by Markievicz, who took this young woman, some thirty years her junior quite under her wing.\n\nThe two had much in common. Both were proud of being good shots and physically fearless; as well as being ardent nationalists they were both horrified by poverty and motivated by a desire to end it as well and they both really enjoyed dressing up, with the somewhat bird-like Margaret telling Madam that she could pass for a boy if ever needed, ‘even if it came to wrestling or whistling’ so Markievicz tried her out by putting her into a boy’s suit and Skinnider passed herself off as a member of the Glasgow Fianna to boys from the Fianna Éireann in Dublin when they went to a shooting gallery. On that occasion Skinnider hit the bulls-eye more often than most of her male comrades, as she recalled, much to the delight of the one boy among them who knew she was a girl, although, as she observed ‘he was not much surprised for by her own skill Madam had accustomed them to expect good marksmanship in a woman’. On this trip, Markievicz sked her to draw up plans of Beggar’s Bush barracks near the canal off Baggot Street in the south of the city, in case they wished to dynamite them if conscription was introduced, against promises to the contrary. Previous efforts by the Volunteers to draft them had failed but Skinnider had experience in gauging distances and drawing maps and had just completed a course in calculus. But, as Skinnider observed afterwards, it was not merely a test of her ability to draw maps and figure distances, and after that day she was taken into the confidence of the leaders of the movement, including James Connolly, who was a regular visitor to Markievicz’s house.\n\nMargaret Skinnider returned to Glasgow at the end of the holidays, promising to come back when needed and so found herself in Dublin again before Easter. She arrived back on Holy Thursday and that evening, she was given a dispatch to bring up to Belfast to a man who was staying in the Connolly home there. She arrived up at 2 in the morning and returned to Dublin the next day with Mrs Connolly and her daughters, who, she recalled, were not sure if they would ever seen their home again. Connolly’s second daughter, Nora, was almost the same age as Margaret Skinnider and the two became good friends and remained very close over the years.\n\nOtherwise, in the days before the rising she ran messages for the volunteers and moving dynamite around Dublin city and on Easter Monday, she took her bike into town and began her work. Her activities on Easter week have been well rehearsed recently, but I’ll let her speak for herself to give you an idea of how that day started out.\n\nAs well as scouting, Miss Skinnider carried dispatches between the rebels in the Green and head quarters in the GPO. On the Tuesday morning, by which time the Stephens Green battalion was in the College of Surgeons, she had her first taste of the risks of street fighting when the soldiers on the top of the Shelbourne aimed their machine gun at her. She recalled her speed saved her life but that bullets had hit the wooden rim of the bicycle wheels, puncturing the tyres, as well as hitting the spokes of the wheels.\n\nFrom Tuesday she was also actively involved in the fighting, one of the few women who were, as well as continuing the perilous work of a despatch rider. Dressed in a Citizen Army uniform which Markievicz had had made for her, she acted as a sniper from the roof of the College of Surgeons. As she recalled ‘more than once I saw the man I aimed at fall.’ She was still acting as a despatch rider as well though, and whenever she was required to deliver a despatch, she would change into her civvies before getting on her bike, and then change back into her uniform on her return to join the fire squad on the RCSI roof.\n\nHer requests to Mallin that she be allowed take out the Shelbourne, to rid them from the menace of the machine gun, were originally rebuffed but on Wednesday, she was put in charge of four men and set out to fire a building on Harcourt St in an effort to take out the escape route of the British army snipers who were on the roof of the University Church on Stephens Green.\n\nJust as they were about to enter the building, snipers on the roof of the Sinn Féin bank across the road on Harcourt Street opened fire, in the course of which she was shot three times. She had just turned to speak as she stood at the door a moment earlier, which meant that one of the bullets narrowly missing her spine, by a quarter of an inch. Had she not moved at that moment, she would almost certainly have been killed. One of her comrades, the seventeen year old Fred Ryan was shot dead. Grievously injured, she was carried back to the College of Surgeons where she stayed until the surrender order was given by Pearse, after which she was brought across to St Vincent’s Hospital on the other side of the Green.\n\nGrievously injured, she was carried back to the College of Surgeons where she stayed until the surrender order was given by Pearse, after which she was brought across to St Vincent’s Hospital on the other side of the Green, which is now home to Loretto on the Green girls’ school. She was very seriously ill, especially for her first two weeks in hospital which were quite hellish. She had contracted pneumonia and had a bad fever and as well as suffering from the internal effects of being shot by three dum-dum bullets, her wounds had been treated with too much corrosive sublimate which took all the skin off her side and back. Her first two weeks in hospital were hellish, as she fought a fever and was in great pain. Meanwhile, word had reached her mother that she had been killed, with later reports saying she had been paralysed and that she had been sentenced to fifteen years. William Partridge, who had actually saved her life, seems to have thought that she’d died and one of his fellow prisoners in Dartmoor later remembered how they included her in the prayers for their departed comrades every night. While in hospital she was visited regularly by Nora Connolly and her sister, Ina, with Nora telling Margaret of her father’s concern for her when she had last seen him. After five weeks, she was escorted to the Bridewell prison but she was followed down by Doctor Kennedy who had been taking care of her in Vincents, who apparently raised holy hell that his patient had been removed as a result of which she was returned to hospital where she stayed for a further fortnight, making seven weeks in Vincents in all.\n\nNot long after she was discharged, Margaret Skinnider managed to secure a travel permit to return to Glasgow – a time when her accent and her looking more like a maths teacher than a rebel stood to her advantage – and she was able to travel to England to visit some of the prisoners in Reading Jail. She also visited Dublin twice where she noticed a change in the mood of the city, before travelling to America in December 1916 for a few months on a Cumman na mBan propaganda tour, during which time she wrote her book which was a personal account of Easter Week, written essentially for propaganda purposes.\n\nShe lived in Glasgow for a time, unable to secure a visa to return to Ireland but during the war of independence she was on the Executive of Cumann na mBan and was appointed Director of Training soon after. During this time, between 1919 and 1922 she worked for the Transport and General Workers Union.\n\nAlong with many of her closest comrades, she opposed the Treaty in 1922. During the attack on the Four Courts, she was in charge of Cumann na mBan operations in Dublin. She worked in charge of the Accounts Branch in the Quarter-Master General’s Office, at the Four Courts and following Liam Mellows’ arrest, she continued on as acting Quarter-Master General. Apparently she was the only woman ever to have been made a member of the General Headquarters staff of the IRA. Arrested in possession of a revolver and ammunition on St Stephens Day, 1922, she spent eleven months in prison. She was in Mountjoy for a time before being moved to the North Dublin Union where she and others spent time on hunger strike. Ever the teacher, while she was in the North Dublin Union she conducted a choir of Cumann na mBan prisoners, which was at its best at Mass on Sunday. Mairead and Siobhan De Paor who were in with her described her as being the O/C of various activities including knitting and drilling and her advice was often sought on many subjects. She was a great knitter and was able to knit and read at the same time, which kept her busy particularly in later years.\n\nMiss Skinnider was released from prison in November 1923, six months after the dump arms order. She went to work as a clerk for the Larkinite Workers’ Union of Ireland, which had split from the ITGWU, and whose office at 31 Marlborough Street was almost beside the Department of Education.\n\nLast year, the files of the Military Pensions were released online and there was a lot of attention given to Margaret Skinnider’s application for a 1916 pension which had been turned down in 1925 because according to the Minister for Defence the Army Pensions act of 1923, was ‘only applicable to soldiers as generally understood in the masculine sense’.\n\nThis was merely an added reason for her claim being rejected, however, because it was not merely her gender more her politics that stood against her since, as the intelligence report put it ‘this lady has been a very prominent Irregular since 1922’.\n\nIt was after Fianna Fáil were in government from 1932 that the rules of the pensions were changed so that those who had subsequently been on the anti-Treaty side were also eligible and she was eventually declared eligible for a pension in 1938, assessed at 20 per cent disablement for two years.\n\nA dedicated teacher, for whom it was a vocation, she wished to return to the classroom, but it was not easy for a woman with her record to secure a position. Eventually, in 1927 she secured a post in the Sisters’ of Charity school in King’s Inn Street. It was a large school, with some 1,200 pupils, in an economically disadvantaged part of Dublin’s north inner city. It’s near Henrietta Street, where the Tenement museum is now based. She was strict with great control over her girls but with a great sense of loving kindness, and she developed their love for Irish history and the Irish language especially. She organised camogie for the school and they played in the Phoenix Park.\n\nMiss Skinnider had made a reasonable recovery from her injuries considering their seriousness, but the extensive scars from her wound remained all her life, and, more importantly she had sustained serious damage to the nerves of her upper arm which meant that she was unable to write on the blackboard for any length of time or do any work involving use of the right arm for any length of time.\n\nOf course, as soon as she resumed teaching she joined the INTO and Nora Connolly O’Brien recalled that she ‘would not tolerate’ any teacher in the school not being a member of the organisation.\n\nThe INTO Strike Working Committee 1946\n\nIt was during the great Teachers’ Strike of 1946 that she became particularly active. She served on the strike committee and afterwards she was elected to the CEC at the 1949 congress along with Miss Breedge Bergin, who had been elected vice president. The two were the only women on the executive, and this lack of representation was reflected in the treatment of women generally, even though women made up sixty-four per cent of the membership. When Miss Bergin was elected president in 1950, she became only the third woman president in the Organisation’s eighty-two year history at that point, after Catherine Mahon and Kathleen Clarke, the namesake of Tom Clarke’s widow. Not long after, Margaret Skinnider would become the fourth.\n\nMiss Skinnider was also politically active around this time. Many national school teachers were deeply angry at Fianna Fáil’s behaviour over the ’46 strike and a few of them were active in establishing the new progressive republican party, Clann na Poblachta, of which she was a founding member in 1946. She served on its ard comhairle and ran unsuccessfully for the Clann in the local elections in 1950. Clann na Poblachta was in the inter-party government of 1948-51 during which time, Margaret Skinnider was asked to approach party leader Seán MacBride to lobby on education and to seek Clann support on moving a motion on teachers’ salaries but to no avail.\n\nWith senior members of Clan na Poblachta\n\nSkinnider was nominated to stand for the seanad on two occasions. The first time was in 1954, when she was nominated to stand for the Labour panel by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations but the INTO’s treasurer, MP Linehan, was standing for the same panel, leading the general secretary to impress upon her that her candidature would interfere with Linehan’s and there was a grave danger that neither would get in. He suggested she consider withdrawing and later she did so. At the following seanad election in 1957, when she was INTO president, the ICPSA nominated her for the Labour Panel once again, this time before the INTO had already done so. The INTO did not put up another candidate on the panel and supported Skinnider asking that the TUC give her all possible support but she failed to be elected.\n\nAs an INTO activist, she fought for better pay and conditions for all teachers but at a time when women teachers were discriminated against through the marriage ban, and there was great resistance among male teachers to the idea of women receiving the same pay as them, Margaret Skinnider was one of few women activists in the organisation. The issue was a particularly divisive one in the years immediately after 1947, when the pay scale which followed the teachers’ strike had seen single men and women teachers put at the same rate. The male teachers were vehemently opposed to this and succeeded by way of their massive majority in congress and on the executive, in securing the INTO’s support for their cause. At congress and on the CEC, Margaret Skinnider opposed any move to revert to have male teachers restore a disparity and protested strongly at what she felt was a betrayal of the women teachers and the organisation’s values.\n\nShe was nominated to represent the INTO on the Roe Commission on teachers’ salaries in 1948, in order to ensure there was a woman representative, but in no way was she mere window-dressing or tokenism. The extent to which the INTO was male-dominated at the time is difficult to exaggerate, but as ever, she was fearless. Even in a room full of men, many, if not most, of whom disagreed with her, she would clearly argue her point and stand her ground, even if it meant speaking to her colleagues as though they were a class of infants. Admonishing congress one year, she told delegates severely ‘I never speak to a class when there is talking and I am sorry I cannot speak to you’ which brought about a sheepish silence, before she continued to make her point about pensions. Neither was she selfish in this and made sure others – particularly young women teachers – would have the freedom to speak. At the same congress, she had taken to the platform during a debate to complain that ‘proper facilities were not being given to the younger members to speak and that delegates were embarrassing young girls coming up, with the first girl trying to speak to a motion having calls for her telephone number from the floor. ‘Is it any wonder the younger people do not come up?’ she asked. On the executive and at congress, year after year, she fought for the rights of women teachers. In 1956 she was elected vice president of the organisation and became president the following year. When the Irish Congress of Trade Unions set up a Women’s Advisory Committee to advise it on problems faced by women in the trade union movement, she was appointed its chair, stepping down on her retirement in 1964. Speaking at the 1963 congress, she pointed out to delegates that ICTU research on the possible impact of Ireland joining the EEC on things like salaries, they had found that the difference in wage rates between men and women was much greater than that of OEEC countries, which were Christian and mostly Catholic. A delegate named Morgan from Drogheda responded by telling her that she should not forget the women at home. ‘As an organisation they praised themselves that they always had the welfare of the children at heart but what about the mothers at home.’ At her last congress as a delegate the next year, in 1964, she was still at the fore in speaking for equal pay, citing the UNO, the Treaty of Rome, the ILO and the ITUC but to no end. Her motion was defeated by an amendment tabled by a Tipperary delegate named Ryan who complained that he ‘could not understand this business of equal pay for equal work’ and wanted to know ‘if someone had a grudge against the married teacher.’\n\nThat Margaret Skinnider’s sense of nationalism remained undimmed throughout this time was clear from her president’s speech at the Killarney congress in 1957 which dealt with education in Ireland since before the time of St Patrick. In it, she discussed the role played by teachers in various national movements; looking at the minutes of the National Board from 1831 to 1870, she proudly noted that there was a record for sixty-five teachers, men and women, who were in trouble with the Board for alleged disloyalty during these years, many of whom had been connected with the Young Irelanders and the Fenians. This record only covers those who were ‘found out’ by the board and can only be a small percentage of those actually connected with those movements. At the same time, while she was a great believer in social justice and was an active member of Clann na Poblachta, whose policies were broadly social democratic, she took time in her speech to condemn one of de Valera’s favourite political philosophers, Nicolo Machiavelli, and what she called his ‘evil statist doctrine’\n\nHer fighting spirit was often evident in her speeches. Speaking in the 1960s on the matter of dilapidated school buildings and huge class sizes, she called on teachers to examine their own consciences, asking would anyone accorded professional status work in the conditions that teachers did. ‘Sometime ago the CEC sent a questionnaire around to teachers asking them when their schools were clearned and painted etc. and one question was ‘is your school rat-infested?’ One teacher replied ‘no self-respecting rat would be found dead in this place.’ She urged the teachers ‘get up off your knees and stand up like men and women’…The rat had one quality which she much admired and that was he fought when he had to.’\n\nShe retired in 1964, and her voice was missed at congress. She had been a hugely important voice for women teachers and there was still a great deal of sexism and resistance to open up the old boys club and for many years after she retired there was not a single woman on the INTO’s CEC, and if anything the sexism became worse during the 1970s in her absence.\n\nCommemorating 1916 in 1966\n\nAgain and again, we have been told lately about the ‘forgotten women’ of 1916, but if current generations have failed to remember, they were not forgotten by their peers at the time. Over the years, Margaret Skinnider was a regular attendee at events to commemorate and celebrate the men and women of the revolutionary period and when Seán Lemass’s government was nominating a committee to over-see the state Commemorations for the fiftieth anniversary of the rising in 1966, Margaret Skinnider was one of those appointed. She was interviewed for Radio Éireann about events on Easter Week and appeared in various accounts of the rising.\n\nIn 1966, her old principal, Sister de Lellis, invited her back to King’s Inn Street to tell the girls all about 1916. After addressing the assembly, she made sure to stop and speak to the girls on her way down from the stage.\n\nShe was also invited to address the INTO Congress that Easter. She was still a revolutionary woman, but she was proud of what Ireland had achieved during independence, telling the delegates in 1966, she was unhappy there were people who ‘belittle what has been done’ since 1916. ‘‘They don’t appreciate what has been done; the hospitals which have been built; the schools erected; the industries which have been started and flourish and all the other things.’\n\nThanking her after Miss Skinnider had ended her speech to congress in 1966 the president, Mrs Liston, observed she had turned down many other invitations to be with them at Congress. Margaret Skinnider responded, though, that there was no other place she would be. ‘Even my allegiance to those sacred things in Dublin [1916 ] could not get inside my allegiance to the INTO.’\n\nMargaret Skinnider remained in her home in Fairview on Dublin’s north side in her retirement where she spent much of her time reading and knitting, and would spend most weekends staying with her great friend Nora Connolly O’Brien. She died on 11 November 1971 and was buried beside Countess Markievicz, only the third woman to be buried in the Republican Plot after Markievicz and James Connolly’s widow Lillie. The day after her death, Radio Éireann broadcast a half hour radio programme including her friends.\n\nMargaret Skinnider was well-known to her generation and her name would have been known to many of those who studied the revolutionary period but among the general public in recent years, like many of the rank and file of Easter Week, male and female. Recently, her name has become better known as part of the attempt to highlight the role played by women in the Rising, especially as she was one of the only female combatants, and the only female combatant to be injured. The release of her pension records, and the refusal of the state to countenance paying her a pension on the grounds of her sex has also brought her significant attention, and she has been the subject of an RTÉ broadcast documentary and newspaper articles, and talks and has become the first INTO president to have a roundabout named after them. It is natural in the year that’s in it that her role in 1916 would be emphasised, but there is so much more to Margaret Skinnider than that.\n\nAfter she had spoken to the INTO congress in 1966, the general secretary Dave Kelleher observed that in all the time they had spent together over the years, he had never once heard her mention the party she’d played in the rising. ‘She was that modest’. While it is true that she was a modest person, it might be more accurate to say that she was not someone who lived in, or dwelt on the past. She may have done her bit for Ireland in 1916, but she didn’t stop there and her devotion to education and the children of Ireland was really her life’s work.\n\nI was invited to speak at a conference on Law, Revolution and Sovereignty: Reflections on the Legal Legacy of the 1916 Rising & Declaration of Independence held by the School of Law in NUI Galway in 2016. I was a political historian among legal scholars so the paper had a legal scholarly name but the paper focused on the area of the values set out in the proclamation and their politics. In other words, the as the title on the programme puts it 1919 as root of title, a somewhat legal title for a paper with no law. It is based on a chapter in Foundation Stone: Notes Towards a Constitution for a 21st-Century Republic edited by Theo Dorgan.\n\nThe year 1919 is a pivotal date in Irish history and is effectively the constitutional foundation stone of the modern Irish state. Strictly speaking, the state dates itself from 1922 with the foundation of the Irish Free State under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty but, I would suggest, outside of particular partisan circles, there is not really a great deal of affection for that particular date, which represents a bitterly contested compromise wrested from Britain.\n\n1919 is not officially a part of the history of the actual state, then, but it has a semi-official status, in the sense that we still count our parliaments from the one elected at the 1918 general election, and the record of our Houses of the Oireachtas begins with the first public meeting of the First Dáil in the Mansion House on 21 January 1919. It’s not something we do with our governments but it is, I think, the only aspect of the pre-1922 independence movement that remains a part of the architecture of the modern state.\n\nThe First Dáil was a non-violent revolutionary act, which had its basis in a mandate from the Irish people. As Michael Laffan pointed out ‘in two quite different respects the meeting of the First Dáil was an act of great symbolic importance. Not only did it inaugurate the democratic and constitutional history of independent Ireland, but it also represented a synthesis of two different traditions within Irish nationalism’, by combining the military and political traditions within Irish nationalism and was ‘the product of co-operation between soldiers and politicians’ which had begun in the period following the 1916 Rising.[1] It also dramatically marked the end of a different political tradition in Ireland, with the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) having been effectively wiped out in the election which preceded it. In a sense then, it marks the continuity of the Irish parliamentary tradition, but with an entirely new cast of actors.\n\nIt’s not necessary to rehearse the origins of the First Dáil except to note a couple of things. For one thing, it is a direct consequence of the events of Easter Week and the re-organisation of the iteration of Sinn Féin that grew out of it and which was, at that point, more of a rallying cry than a political party in any conventional sense. Labour, which had been founded only a few years earlier, famously did not contest the election, so that the contest was a straight fight between Sinn Féin and the IPP, making it, in effect a referendum on separatism.\n\nAs Frank Gallagher put it, there had been no concealment of what Sinn Féin stood for.\n\nThat it was for Ireland a Republic the people were being asked to vote\n\nthat those elected would not attend the British Commons but would remain in Ireland to set up a National Assembly, and\n\nThat the assembly would assert full sovereign independence.[2]\n\nThe Sinn Féin landslide which followed saw the party take 73 of 105 seats. That they would not take their seats in Westminster was a given, despite some cynical speculation to the contrary,[3] but there was a question mark over what Sinn Féin might do next. A parliament with Sinn Féin deputies only would be problematic with so many of them in prison, but the suggestion that they convene a National Assembly, including representatives of the Labour movement and other national organisations was also difficult because this would dilute the legitimacy conferred on any parliament by co-opting unelected members. If they were going to establish a representative government, they believed that their mandate was crucial.\n\nTom Johnson had told a newspaper that the party was ‘willing to act as a Left-wing within the National Assembly’ and the Labour leaders were reported to have been distinctly put out at not having been invited to take part in a broader assembly, but they said nothing in public and would be placated soon enough.[4]\n\nOn 7 January, some twenty nine of the Sinn Féin MPs attended a preliminary private meeting in the Oak Room of the Mansion House of the ‘Dáil Éireann’ as the new assembly had been called. They resolved ‘that we, the republican members of the Irish constituencies, in accordance with the National Will, are empowered to call together the Dáil Éireann and proceed accordingly.’ Which they duly did, assembling at the Round Room of the Mansion House at 3.30 pm on 21 January 1919, in a room packed with ticket holders and the international press.\n\nAfter a prayer read in Irish by Fr Flanagan there was a roll call of all those elected in 1918, with the refrain fé ghlas ag Gallaibh for each Sinn Féin member in prison on the day, while the Unionist and Home Rule MPs were ‘as láthair’, the Bunreacht Dala Éireann was read, in Irish only, and adopted. The Constitution of Dáil Éireann consisted of five articles and was a straightforward framework for organising the work of parliament and its ministers. Article 1 stated that ‘all legislative powers shall be vested in Dáil Éireann, composed of Deputies, elected by the Irish people form the existing Irish parliamentary constituencies’; article 2 outlined the composition of the ministry of the Dáil and the election of the president, article 3 referred to the chairman of the Dáil, Article 4 related to money and article 5 stated that the constitution was provisions and liable to alteration upon seven days’ written notice. An English language version was provided to the press on the day,[5] and later adopted when the Dáil met again on 1 April when much of the business of the day was amendments to the standing orders and to the constitution of Dáil Éireann, including a motion moved by Eamonn de Valera and seconded by Countess Markievicz that ‘Deputies shall be referred to by the names of their constituencies and that (g) No Deputy shall make a personal charge against another nor use offensive remarks about another,’[6] thus adding guidelines for civility to proceedings which had been remarkably civil up to this point and, more curiously, adopting the Westminster custom regarding names.\n\nBrian Farrell has observed that the presentation of the constitution was ‘almost dismissive’ and did it less than justice, considering it was the ‘first fundamental law of modern Ireland [and] was to remain the basis of the Irish state until the adoption of the Irish Free State constitution in 1922.’[7] Certainly, the emphasis in the rhetoric of the proceedings of the opening session of the First Dáil is on the parliament, and the people who elected it, rather than on any government arising out of it and any structures it might have. It is interesting though, that when the Dáil met for the third time, this time with de Valera present for the first time, that the focus shifted to the structures of government and rules of the house.\n\nBut after the roll and the rules, the meeting it had before it three items of business: a declaration of independence, a message to the free nations of the world calling for recognition of Ireland’s independence and, finally, the adoption of the Democratic Programme.\n\nThe message to the free nations of the world, which was read in Irish, English and French, was an appeal for recognition of Ireland’s national status and her right to its vindication at the Paris Peace Congress but the other two documents are of more lasting relevance and are what I’m going to focus on here.\n\nRecalling the meeting of the First Dáil some decades later in his book The Four Glorious Years, Frank Gallagher noted that ‘the Declaration of Independence, made by Dáil Éireann’ that day ‘is historically the most important document in the archives of modern Ireland.’[8]\n\nThe Declaration of Independence is just 400 words long and effectively updates the Proclamation in the context of the new national parliament.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence can be boiled down to the idea that where the ‘Irish republic was proclaimed on Easter Monday by the Irish Republican Army acting on behalf of the people,’ now the people had declared its allegiance to the Republic through a democratic vote. It roots the Republic in centuries of physical force, right up to 1916, but confirms its legitimacy with its mandate.\n\nFrank Gallagher may have a case in saying that this Declaration of Independence is historically the most important document of modern Ireland but it has never had that status. It is largely unremarked on by scholars and, I think, almost entirely absent from the public consciousness. I doubt many people could quote a single sentence and a very quick Google search mostly brought up pages relating to the 1916 Proclamation. Perhaps it is partly a consequence of a the more formal, legalistic language of the Declaration – ‘and whereas, and whereas’ – in comparison with the more elegant or memorable Proclamation. It might be facile to suggest that the visionaries of the revolution had been executed after the Rising but nevertheless, the 1919 document lacks something of its predecessor. Looking at Declarations of Independence more broadly, we can see that it lacks the philosophical qualities that have made the American declaration stand the test of time in its public consciousness. There are no self-evident truths or rights, just an national polity albeit one ‘based upon the people’s will with equal right and equal opportunity for every citizen.’\n\nBut if the vision of the Republic is lacking from the Declaration of Independence, it can be found in the third document adopted by the Dáil on that first day, the Democratic Programme. In fewer than 600 words in the English language version, the programme laid out the principles on which the Irish Republic was to be built – those of Liberty, Equality and Justice for all – where every man and woman would give their allegiance to ‘the commonwealth’ and, in return, each citizen would receive an adequate share of the produce of the nation’s labour and where the government’s first duty would be to ensure the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of every child. The programme was not framed as a constitution, as such, but it did outline the basic ethos and civic framework on which the new state would be built. Significantly, however, the word ‘state’ is entirely absent from the text. In contrast, the 1922 Free State constitution and its 1937 successor, Bunreacht na hÉireann, both focused on drawing up the state’s legal and political infrastructure, but the notion of citizenship, and the rights and responsibilities it conferred, was wholly absent, an absence which has been reflected in the political culture of the state.\n\nIn recent years, particularly in the context of the post-2008 economic crisis and the political re-evaluation which followed (such as it was), this absence of a popular civic republicanism has been highlighted as a factor contributing to Ireland’s national malaise by various commentators. This view has much to recommend it although there is rarely (if ever) any acknowledgement of the voices which had previously called for the state to promote an active citizenship in the past but who were readily ignored by those who held political power almost from the outset. The Democratic Programme adopted by Dáil Éireann in January 1919 is probably the most pertinent example, a document which not only remains relevant today but which is significantly more progressive than anything which followed in the century since it was put before Ireland’s first independent parliament.\n\nBefore looking at the document itself though, it’s worth looking at the context in which it was written.\n\nThe genesis behind the programme was largely political and done with an eye on an international audience. The Socialist International was meeting in Berne on 3 February and two Labour men, Tom Johnson, treasurer of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress and Cathal O’Shannon, an official in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, were planning to attend to lobby for support for Irish self-determination. Anything that which might lend the progressive or radical credentials to the new government would surely ‘strengthen the delegation’s hand in Switzerland’[9] would be advantageous. Johnson was approached to write the Dáil’s social programme, something which might serve as a consolation to Labour which had stood aside in the 1918 election and again when the membership of the assembly was not widened. There was also another consideration, though, since there were few others capable of doing the job.\n\nPart of the problem was that ‘Sinn Féin’, that broad alliance of disparate political beliefs, had not given the issue a great deal of thought. Many of those who had been inclined towards political thinking had died in 1916 and their successors seemed, for the most part, of a less philosophical bent. Theirs was an attitude summed up in a story retold by Seán O’Faolain, about the English journalist who\n\nSoon after 1916, plied the general secretary of Sinn Féin, Paudeen O’Keeffe, with so many insistent questions on the lines of ‘What are the practical aims of this movement?’ and got so many unsatisfactory answers that, in the end, he said in some slight exasperation: ‘Mr O’Keeffe, would you at least say what exactly you yourself want?’\n\nAt this O’Keeffe, a small, dark fiercely moustached Celt, banged his desk and roared: ‘Vingeance, bejasus!’[10]\n\nSimilarly, in his history of Sinn Féin between 1916 and 1923, Michael Laffan has observed that Sinn Féin ‘did not engage in the sort of intellectual debates which preoccupied many of their counterparts in other countries.’[11] It would be wrong to suggest that these debates did not take place at all, but within Sinn Féin people who thought in a practical way about the nature of Irish society after the revolution, people such as Liam Mellows, were in the minority and tended to be on the left. For the rest, Connolly’s idea of ‘painting the post boxes green’ did not seem too objectionable. As such another factor in Johnson being asked to write the programme was because he could and there was no one in Sinn Féin who would be equal to the job.\n\nIn early January, Johnson was approached to write the Dáil social and economic document. Johnson began his draft by quoting form the 1916 Proclamation and then from Pearse’s last major pamphlet, the Sovereign People (published 31 March 1916), in a deliberate attempt ‘to link Easter Week with the Dáil’s need for a social policy’ as well as to illustrate the influence which James Connolly had had on Pearse’s thought in later years.[12]\n\nIn Pearse’s words, the passage asserted that ‘no private right to property is good against the public right of the nation…whenever forms of productive wealth are wrongfully used…the Nation shall resume possession without compensation.’ The draft continued in a similar vein, asserting that ‘the Irish Republic shall always count wealth and prosperity by the measure of health and happiness of its citizens’ and as such, the first duty of the government of the republic would be to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children. It set out how natural resources would be exploited for the good of the people and how where ‘productive wealth’ was ‘wrongfully used or withheld from use to the detriment of the Republic, there the nation shall resume possession without compensation.’ Having dealt with trade and the noting that ‘it shall be the purpose of the government to encourage the organisation of the people into trade unions and co-operative societies with a view to the control and administration of the industries by the workers engaged in the industries. Finally, it concluded that ‘the Republic will aim at the elimination of the class in society which lives upon the wealth produced by the workers of the nation but gives no useful service in return, and in the process of accomplishment will bring freedom to all who have hitherto been caught in the toils of economic servitude.’[13]\n\nJohnson’s document, however, was far from the last word since, as Aindrias Ó Cathasaigh has noted, ‘the republicans were not minded to let the programme through on the nod.’[14] Michael Collins called a meeting of leading members of the IRB for the eve of the inaugural session of the first Dáil to consider the Democratic Programme. According to P.S. O’Hegarty, one of those present:\n\nThe ‘Democratic Programme’ gave rise to a lively debate, the preponderance of opinion being against it. It was urged that this declaration was in fact ultra vires for the Dáil, whose one and only business was to get the English out of Ireland, and that all internal and arguable questions like this should be left over until the English had actually been got out, and, on a vote, that view was upheld. Collins then said that he would suppress the ‘democratic programme’, and he did so; but, next morning, the others refused to go one without a democratic programme and the draft was handed to Seán T. O’Kelly, who finally produced what was put before the Dáil.[15]\n\nO’Kelly’s recollection differed somewhat but as Ó Cathasaigh observes, ‘his description of how the draft was received rings true’:\n\na long and sometimes heated discussion. There were ideas and statements which some of the committee would not accept. The discussion lasted until well after eleven o’clock… Eventually the meeting broke up without any agreement. All notes and suggestions were thrown at me because I was chairman. I was told to draft the document myself.[16]\n\nAs Ó Cathasaigh observes, ‘O’Shannon thought that the Sinn Féin executive, with O’Kelly’s own support, overruled the IRB objections,’[17] and O’Kelly was given the task of rendering Johnson’s original document into something which the IRB would find less objectionable. O’Kelly worked through the night, cutting extensively, editing other sections but adding little of his own. He removed some of the more radical elements in the text including the elimination of the capitalist class and the confiscation of misused property and rephrasing other sections. Years later, O’Shannon went compared original draft and the final version and found that around half of the half of the Johnson draft was omitted.[18] Once O’Kelly had finished his revisions, there was a rush to have the final version typed up for the opening of the Dáil. With no time left to write an Irish translation, Piaras Béaslaí was left to do an impromptu translation, pretending to read from the English text.[19] As O’Kelly later recalled, ‘the draft of the Democratic Programme was not submitted to any committee or indeed to any individual except my wife,’[20] and Cathal O’Shannon noted that it was not until he and Johnson listened to the programme being read to the Dáil that they realised that it had been amended. But if a deal of the explicit socialism of the first draft was excised, it was not wholly eliminated and the end result did not trouble Johnson who wept with emotion as it was read out.[21]\n\nI will just quote a couple of excerpts here:\n\nwe declare that the Nation’s sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions, the Nation’s soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the Nation, and with him we reaffirm that all right to private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare.\n\nWe declare that we desire our country to be ruled in accordance with the principles of Liberty, Equality, and Justice for all, which alone can secure permanence of Government in the willing adhesion of the people.\n\nWe affirm the duty of every man and woman to give allegiance and service to the Commonwealth, and declare it is the duty of the Nation to assure that every citizen shall have opportunity to spend his or her strength and faculties in the service of the people. In return for willing service, we, in the name of the Republic, declare the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the Nation’s labour.\n\nIt shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as Citizens of a Free and Gaelic Ireland.\n\nEven watered down, the Democratic Programme is a powerful declaration of the rights and duties of citizens and what was meant by a Republic, outside the instruments of statehood or government. The problem, however, at the time and since, however, lies in the mens rea. [joke] The Democratic Programme was adopted by the First Dáil, few members of that Dáil, if any, seem to have taken it particularly seriously and the debate has raged for decades over whether the Programme was genuine or merely opportunism.\n\nApart from the IRB’s opposition not merely to its content but to its being read at all. In later years, there were others on the Cumann na nGaedhael/Fine Gael side who were openly contemptuous of it. Asked about the programme fifty years later, in 1969, Ernest Blythe recalled ‘no, I never found anybody who took the slightest interest in it. The Labour Party secured the adoption of it. I don’t think anybody, practically speaking, bothered with it afterwards. It was regarded as some sort of hoisting of a flag. It wasn’t regarded as significant.’[22] Similarly, Piaras Beaslaí, who was on the Dáil preparatory committee (and who ‘read’ the Irish version to the assembly) later wrote that it was doubtful whether a majority of the members would have voted for it, without amendment, had there been any immediate prospect of putting it into force.’[23] Indeed, the first suggestions that this case the case was as early as April 1919.\n\nOn 4 April a motion pledging the assembly to ‘fair and full redistribution of vacant lands and ranches … among the uneconomic holders and landless men’ was withdrawn with the land question being given over to consideration by a committee, suggesting that any practical efforts to put the programme into practice might be unwanted.[24] The following week, when answering a question about the social policy of the government, de Valera, the president of the republic who had been in Jail when the Programme had been adopted, explained that ‘it was quite clear that the democratic programme…contemplated a situation somewhat different from that in which they actually found themselves. They had the occupation of the foreigner in their country, and while that state of affairs existed, they could not put fully into force their desires and their wishes as far as their social programme was concerned.’ Furthermore, adverting to his lack of involvement in the process ‘He had never made any promise to Labour, because, while the enemy was within their gates, the immediate question was to get possession of their country.’[25]\n\nAfter 1922, when the British enemy had moved beyond the gates, the division on the Democratic Programme became more apparent. Cumman na nGaedhael’s hostility towards it was clearly evident during the debates on the 1922 constitution. Drawing on the democratic programme, Labour deputies endeavoured to have economic rights to things such as food, shelter and education in the constitution, but Kevin O’Higgins was adamant that constitutions should include only ‘fundamental rights.’ There would be no references to citizens or their rights or duties and when the debate moved to natural resources, O’Higgins accused Labour of trying to put communist doctrine into the Free State Constitution. When Tom Johnson countered that what he was suggesting was in the democratic programme, O’Higgins merely replied ‘that’s not a constitution.’\n\nIn effect, Cumman na nGaedheal, and later Fine Gael, opposed the Democratic Programme, Labour and some left republicans supported it and then there were other republicans such as Liam Lynch or de Valera, who paid it lip service, expressing the view that the democratic programme was fine, but not yet. When Fianna Fáil was founded in 1926, it listed among its seven objectives ‘to carry out the democratic programme of the First Dáil’ an aim only removed from its corú very recently.\n\nThe programme was never entirely forgotten but it enjoyed something of a revival in the mid-late 1960s when its radicalism chimed with the spirit of social and political rebellion and the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising encouraged a return to the foundations of the modern state. Writing in 1969, the economist Patrick Lynch, then lecturing in UCD, noted the changes in attitude which had begun in recent years ‘when young people saw that there are individuals in all three political parties who appear to have more in common with themselves and with the Democratic Programme… than with the policies of our political parties at the last general election.’[26] Not that its appeal was limited to the new generation. Seán Lemass referred to it in several speeches during his time as Taoiseach and privately, at least, he had expressed a desire to restate its social objectives. In 1964, Michael McInerney, the Irish Times political correspondent suggested that Lemass planned to use the commemorations of the 1916 rising to ‘declare in 1966 terms the national aims as defined in the 1919 programme’ and when the Taoiseach established an All Party Committee on the Constitution that year it looked as though that might happen but ultimately, it was not to be.\n\nThe celebrations surrounding 1966 emphasised the Proclamation of the Republic not its successor from the First Dáil and by its anniversary in 1969 it merely highlighted the state’s sins of omission. When members of the Oireachtas and distinguished guests met to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the First Dáil’s inaugural meeting, President de Valera’s address had been interrupted with a shout. ‘The programme of the old Dáil has never been implemented. This is a mockery.’ Continuing by noting a hunger-strike in Mountjoy by a housing activist who had been imprisoned after he refused to vacate the house in Mountjoy Square where he had been squatting in with his wife and children. The interruption came not from some young hot-head but an older man in the distinguished visitors section, Joseph Clarke, a veteran of 1916, who’d fought on Mount Street bridge under de Valera’s command and the usher-in-charge of the first Dáil.\n\nOnce Lemass had retired from politics, the document’s status diminished within Fianna Fáil and became almost exclusively identified with the left where it continued to be seen as founding document of a republic that had failed to be. Beyond the republican movement (where it was regarded highly in the official and provisional wings), the left and the Labour Party especially, it fell out favour. It was generally ignored, and when it was not ignored it was derided. Writing in January 1989, Mary Holland noted how ‘the political parties achieved a new and rather depressing consensus…when they agreed, unanimously, not to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the first Dáil’ and a suggestion by a Labour senator that the upper house mark the event – highlighting the importance of the democratic programme – prompted the NUI senator, Professor John A. Murphy to declare it ‘pious codswallop’, ‘a piece of eyewash. It was mere window dressing.’ Five years later, however, the occasion was, at least marked by RTÉ in a series of Thomas Davis lectures, published as an collection edited by Brian Farrell, which emphasised the importance of 1919 as the bedrock of the modern Irish state.\n\nPolitically, no one in recent times has identified so strongly with it as President Michael D. Higgins who probably articulated his point best in his valedictory speech to Dáil Éireann in January 2011. On that occasion he spoke of his belief that ‘no real republic had been created in Ireland’ and pointed to the lack of citizenship, not only in Ireland but in the European Union as a whole, and emphasised the need to rebuild an entirely different society one based on ‘political participation, administrative fairness and the equality of the right to community’ and which included ‘a floor of citizenship below which people would not be allowed to fall.’ The picture he painted of a ‘radical inclusive republic’ was compelling, but, as Deputy Higgins might lament, it was not new. The themes he set out in this speech, in effect a reiteration of the Democratic Programme, would be at the heart of his presidential campaign. He returned to them in his address following his inauguration as President of Ireland. President Higgins quoted the sean focal ‘ní neart go cur le chéile’ translating it in terms Tom Johnson would have understood: ‘our strength lies in our common weal, our social solidarity.’\n\nAt a recent series of history lectures on independent Ireland, I was intrigued to see historian after historian begin their talks with reference to the Democratic Programme, although I think, perhaps this is largely because it is so useful as a benchmark for what was left undone, and serves largely as reminder of the new state’s sins of omission. It has no standing in Irish law beyond a moral one and so much of the debate around its status is based not only on what was meant by its authors but also by those who adopted it.\n\nThe Democratic Programme as adopted by the First Dáil represents the high point of the Republic, in a sense, as it was the last time that the citizens of the Republic had precedence as from 1922, the State takes precedence.\n\n[1] Laffan, ‘Sinn Féin from Dual Monarchy’ in Farrell ed p.15\n\n[2] David Hogan, The Four Glorious Years p.51\n\n[3] Mitchell, p.5\n\n[4] Mitchell pp.9-10\n\n[5] Farrell, ‘The First Dáil and its Constitutional Documents’ in Farrell ed p.\n\n[6] DED 1 April 1919\n\n[7] Farrell in Farrell ed p.68\n\n[8] Hogan, The four glorious years p.56\n\n[9] Aindrias O Cathasaigh, ‘Getting with the programme.
