It has a population of more than 1.83m people, with almost 1.4m of them of voting age.\n\nBoundary changes this time round has brought Laois and Offaly from Ireland South back again into the constituency, increasing it from four to five seats.\n\nFine Gael made the main headlines in the 2019 elections, taking two seats following the election of poll topper Mairead McGuinness — now Ireland’s EU Commissioner —and MEP newcomer Maria Walsh.\n\nThe former Rose of Tralee is still in the race this time but McGuinness’ replacement Colm Markey moved off the stage to be replaced by another celebrity candidate, former champion jockey and TV personality Nina Carberry. Fine Gael will be looking to retain both seats it secured five years ago.\n\nFianna Fáil are running an ambitious three candidate strategy comprising Offaly’s Barry Cowen, Lisa Chambers in Mayo and Neil Blaney, located at the top of the constituency in Donegal. The party will be hoping to win at least one seat in the constituency for the first time in ten years.\n\nSinn Féin’s Matt Carthy took the fourth seat in 2019 but on his election to the Dáil in 2020, he was replaced by Sligo councillor Chris MacManus. MacManus’ running mate is Michelle Gildernew, an MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.\n\nThe party’s surge in recent national polls show some signs of tailing off but they will be in shake up for one if not two seats.\n\nOn the Independent front, Castlerea native Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan has been an established MEP for ten years, and not only looks odds on again to retain his seat but could top the poll.\n\nTwo other very strong contenders are Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín, and former RTÉ journalist and community activist, Ciaran Mullooly, who is running for Independent Ireland.\n\nOthers to watch out for are Social Democrats housing activist Rory Hearne; Green Party Senator, Pauline O’Reilly; Independent candidate and former Green, Saoirse McHugh, and Independent candidate, Peter Casey.\n\nThe full list of candidates in alphabetical order is as follows: Justin Barrett (NP); Niall Blaney (FF) Anthony Cahill (IPP); Nina Carberry (FG); Peter Casey (Ind); Lisa Chambers (FF); Barry Cowen (FF); Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan (Ind); Stephen Garland (Ind); Michelle Gildernew (SF); Rory Hearne (SD); Charlotte Keenan (Ind); Hermann Kelly (IFP); Fergal Landy (Ind); Chris MacManus (SF); Margaret Maguire (IFP); Saoirse McHugh (Ind); Ciaran Mullooly; Brian O’Boyle (PBP); Pauline O’Reilly (Ind); Daniel Pocock (Ind); James Reynolds (NP); Michelle Smith (Ind); Peadar Tóibín (Aontú); Maria Walsh (FG); Gerry Waters (Ind); John Waters (Ind)."
