        "text": "Tax Officers: The local tax filing deadline is April 18, 2022, matching the federal and state filing dates.\n\nUnderstanding PSD Codes\n\nPSD Codes (political subdivision codes) are six-digit numbers that uniquely identify each municipality—township, borough, city—in Pennsylvania. PSD Codes play an integral role in assisting employers and tax collectors to remit and distribute the correct amount of local Earned Income Tax to the correct taxing jurisdictions.\n\nEmployees are required to complete a Residency Certification Form upon hire (and with any subsequent change in address) in order to confirm the PSD Codes and EIT Rates being used by the employer for the employees’ local taxing purposes. Employers maintain this form in the employees’ personnel files.\n\nFind your PSD Code by Address\n\nSearch the table below for PSD Codes, or utilize the Address Search Application to search for PSD Codes by address. Refer to the Address Search Application instructions for detailed help.\n\nIf you do not receive a return for your address on the “Find Your Withholding Rates by Address” webpage, try an internet search on the City and State of the home and work address to determine the County for each. Then, contact the Tax Collector/Officer to determine your local tax rates and PSD codes.\n\nView and sort PSD Codes & EIT Rates by county, municipality, and school district.\n\nThe first TWO (2) digits of a PSD Code represent the Tax Collection District (TCD)—in most cases, the county—in which the address is located.\n\nIn combination, the first FOUR (4) digits of a PSD Code represent the School District (SD) in which the address is located.\n\nIn combination, all SIX (6) digits of a PSD Code represent the political subdivision (PSD)—township, borough, city—in which the address is located."
