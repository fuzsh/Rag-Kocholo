        "text": "Women in Irish Society in 1922\n\nWhen we think of Irish society, I think one stereotype is that it is very repressed, very capital c Catholic, and very anti-women. Some of that reputation is earned because both the Cosgrave and DeValera administrations were very misogynistic and passed several laws and a constitution that restricted women’s rights. However, the Irish society of the early 1900s was far more dynamic and feminist than one would have expected.\n\nIt began in 1876 when Anna Haslam created the Irish Women’s Suffrage and Local Government Association (IWSLGA), which campaigned for a greater role for women in local government and public affairs. IWSLGA was followed by several other feminist organizations, including the Irish Women’s Franchise League (IWFL), founded by the amazing Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington. These women fought long and hard for women’s rights. They campaigned, trusting their representatives in Parliament to pass a bill that would grant women 30 years and older, with property the right to vote. However, the Irish Parliamentary Party kept finding reasons to vote against it, convincing some feminists, like Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Helena Moloney, to use militant means. They threw bricks at Dublin Castle to protest the force feeding of British suffragettes, organized mass protests of the visit of the King, the Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, and Northern Ireland leaders James Craig. Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington was arrested for throwing a brick through a Dublin Castle window and briefly went on hunger strike until she was released.\n\nIreland, especially Dublin, was a hotbed for many large and conflicting movements, and that includes the feminist movement. Some women, like Hanna, wanted to be far more militant while others preferred a non-violent, constitutional approached. Then, there was the added complication of conflicting priorities and loyalties. Some women could balance fighting for a nationalist and feminist cause or fighting for labor rights and feminist rights. Others felt that it had to be an either/or choice. Women like Hanna felt that feminist was the most important cause of all and had to be prioritized before all else. Others, like Constance Markievicz, believed that nationalism was the most important thing to fight for and women’s rights could be discussed after independence was won. Then, there was the question of worker rights and women’s rights and would the labor unions fight as hard for women workers as they would for the men workers? As World War I started and all hopes for Home Rule were dashed, women were faced with several different organizations and causes to fight for.\n\nOrganizations, the Irish Transportation and General Workers Union and the Irish Citizen Army were open to women and men and women held equal roles. They learned how to lead, how to fight, how to treat wounds, and women, like Constance Markievicz, served as actual officers in the Irish Citizen Army. However, they were primarily a labor organization and so feminism was understood within the context of worker rights. Hanna’s organization, the IFWL, lost members because they protested World War I and still advocated militant techniques against an empire at war, alienating unionist women, women who had loved ones serving in the army, and nationalist women for prioritizing feminism over nationalist demands.\n\nThen Easter Rising happened, a defining moment for the women of Ireland because the Proclamation Pearse read included a phrase which promised equal rights and status to all genders. Most likely included because of the campaigning of women like Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, Constance Markievicz, Helena Moloney, Kathleen Lynn, etc. and supported by influential men like James Connolly.\n\nIrish women had the choice of participating in the rising, being a victim of the rising, complaining to officials about the rising, or struggling to get along their day while the city was bombed and rebelling. Once the rebellion was defeated, the leaders were executed, and several people were arrested (many who weren’t even involved in the Rising) and sent to jails all over Ireland, Wales, and England, it was up to the women of the victims to speak up and turn the population’s opinion from one of contempt or indifference to support.\n\nWomen like Kathleen Clarke, wife to Tom Clarke, organized the people’s support via her charity that gathered funds for affected families. Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington’s pacifist, feminist, and unconventional husband, Frank, was murdered while trying to prevent people from looting. His murderer was a British officer who was immediately transferred to protect the empire’s reputation. However, thanks to Hanna’s efforts and the conscience of British officer Francis Vane, the officer was put on trial and acquitted on case of mental insanity. He then was relocated to Canada and was never formally charged for his crime. These kinds of stories, spread primarily by women and members of the Catholic Church, prepared Ireland for the return of the participants of Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence.\n\nWhile many women took part in the Irish War of Independence via organizations like Cumann na mBan and Sinn Fein, other women took part simply by offering their houses as hiding places for rebels on the run, storing supplies for the IRA, serving as spies for Collins and other IRA officers, and carrying messages. Other women were involved simply because their cities were the center of violence, their homes were raided, their livestock and homes were destroyed. They were harassed, physically and sexually assault, and put under tremendous pressure by the presence of both the IRA and the British forces. These trends would continue into the Irish Civil War.\n\nBy the time the treaty was signed, many women had either come to their own, felt entitled to having a say in the future government of their country, and in a position to ensure that feminist principles were upheld or they were exhausted victims of a war who wanted peace, stability, and “bread and butter” issues addressed by the future government. Then there were the women who just wanted to survive one way or another. No matter where they fell on the spectrum, the Irish Civil War would not only affect their homes, livelihood, and families, but would have a massive impact on the rights they would have after the war.\n\nWhen Violence Enters the Domestic Sphere\n\nIn the book Women and the Irish Revolution, Mary McAuliffe wrote an interesting chapter about violence entering the domestic sphere and how that affected the women and children of Ireland. In this chapter, she argues that traditionally, military historians focus on the horrors of the front lines and armies, while ignoring or mentioning in passing, how war can enter the home front. This is particularly true during guerilla warfare where the frontline cuts through everyday interactions and can’t be regulated to a battlefield elsewhere. Linda Connolly supports Mary McAuliffe by writing that for a long time “violence” was defined as male against male and rarely referenced women.\n\nFor the women of Ireland, war meant they became legitimate targets of reprisals, harassment, physical and sexual assault, and sometimes rape simply for being in the way, for being related to rebels (whether that lead to the woman’s active participation in the civil war or not), and/or associating with the “wrong” people and/or cause.\n\nAt first the anti-treaty IRA and National Army would fight in garrison cities, meaning many civilians, including women, were often in harm’s way just by trying to live normal lives. They would become known as acceptable casualties and there are several incidences where either the Free State forces or the anti-treaty forces killed women via indiscriminate firing during a shootout. Homes could be commandeered, leaving women in danger of being accused of helping one side or the other and open to reprisals. Often times, the house could be destroyed during the fight, leaving families without a place to live and no help from the government to start over.\n\nOnce the anti-treaty IRA switched to guerrilla warfare, homes became open to raids, women were harassed at work, in their homes, and on the streets. If the Free State couldn’t catch and punish the rebel on the run, they would take it out on the women they left behind. This was a similar tactic the British used during the Irish War of Independence and won the Free State forces little support. However, as we discussed in our last episode on the Protestants of Ireland, the anti-treaty forces had few fans because of their tactics. Every house they burned, every threatening note they sent, every act of physical or sexual assault affected women. If anti-treaty forces requisitioned food, it meant woman couldn’t feed their families or themselves. If the livestock was butchered or maimed, then the family would lose their source of income. All of these actions would add up, causing internal distress, physical and mental illnesses, and created a life of uncertainty and trauma.\n\nSexual Assault\n\nOne of the most contentious issues of both the Irish War for Independence and the Irish Civil War is sexual assault. Often we think of sexual assault as rape, but in reality sexual assault is far more complicated and nuanced, involving several examples that may not seem like sexual assault at first glance. Additionally, by limiting sexual assault to rape, accounts of sexual assault will immediately be under counted because people so rarely report rape to this day. This tendency was ten times worse in the conservative society of the British Empire of the 1900s. So, we’re basically deciding that sexual assault will be counted as low because we’ve defined it within the limits of rape which, in turn, is rarely reported. And since it’s rarely reported, historians will argue it rarely happened, which will be backed up by evidence, and so on and so on, becoming the uroboros, a snake continuously eating its own tail.\n\nDuring the Irish Civil War only a handful of cases of rape were recorded and brought to the attention of the Cosgrave administration and Ministry of Defense. Even fewer went to trial. None of the trials addressed the actual assault or offered any justice to the victims. This has led to the claim that Ireland was “special” during its civil war and rarely recourse to using rape as a weapon against women.\n\nSo far, the data supports this assertion, but it becomes less clear when we include other examples of assault such as body searches, head shavings, and raids on private dwellings and all that may entail. It becomes even muddier, when we consider how the very risk of rape and assault could affect a woman’s mental and physical health. Linda Connolly, herself, argues that historians should investigate the hospitalization of women following the Irish Civil War and see how many were treated for mental breakdowns, what we now know as trauma, etc. Great work is already being done on the women who had to give up their children because of out of marriage sexual liaisons. How many of these were results of assault during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War? Since sexual assault is often hidden in plain sight, it will take creative and interdisciplinary efforts for us to uncover the full story of assault during the Irish Civil War. For the purpose of this episode, we will discuss the few documented cases of rape, body searches, and head shavings.\n\nPurpose of Assaulting Women During the Irish Civil War\n\nBefore discussing the specifics, I want to take a moment and discuss the purpose of sexual assault during wartime.\n\nPhysically, sexual assault is a way to control society. Because of social and religious expectations of the time, women were often seen as the holder of a state’s morality. If the women were “protected” and “taken care” while also being punished for breaking “moral standards” then a state was “healthy” and “moral”. A woman was expected to be pure, mothers, potential girlfriends/wives, beautiful, kind, and the organizers of the home and should never expect credit for fulfilling these requirements. Anytime women broke these expectations they would experience pushback. In the context of the Irish Civil War, women were often assaulted because they exhibited the wrong kind of loyalty. Either a woman was accused of being with a British officer, flirting with an officer, and often times even just talking to an officer. Other women provided more substantial aid. Women were also punished for either having husbands who were anti-treaty IRA members or who were pro-treaty.\n\nAs the civil war progressed and anti-treaty women grew in prominence and more vitriolic in their support for a republic, the Cosgrave Administration (which was already pretty sexist) turned against Irish women, blaming them for the violence and calling them the “wrong” ones hysterical, broken, and unwanted. The “good” Irish women supported the pro-treaty government by returning to the homes, raising the children, and keeping order. They didn’t want to engage in politics, trusting men to know what was best. Not only did this make women vulnerable to humiliating and traumatizing scrutiny, it also opened them up to assault on either side, and diminished women’s rights and causes to something unnatural. This made it easier for the Cosgrave administration to strip women of their rights starting in 1924 and finished by the DeValera Administration with the announcement of a new constitution in 1937.\n\nEven if we assume that the act of sexual assault and rape was lower than other countries who also experienced civil wars, we cannot ignore the impact the threat of assault had on women. Margaret Connery, a suffragist, reported to the Irish White Cross that:\n\n“Women and children were in a constant state of depression and nervous breakdown” and that night-time was dreaded as women particularly ‘knew that it [was] during curfew hours, attempts of a sexual nature [had] been made”\n\nSusan Byrne, ‘Keeping company with the enemy’: gender and sexual violence against women during the Irish War of Independence and Civil War, 1919–1923\n\nErskine Childers describes the terror women often went through in his propaganda peace “A Typical Night in Dublin” as :\n\n“As the citizens go to bed, the barracks spring to life. Lorries, tanks, and armoured searchlight cars, muster in fleets, lists of ‘objectives’ are distributed, and, when the midnight curfew order has emptied the streets—pitch dark streets—the weird cavalcades issue forth to the attack. Think of raiding a private house at dead of night in a tank (my own experience), in a tank, whose weird rumble and roar can be heard miles away! The procedure of the raid is in keeping, though the objectives are held for the most part by women and terrified children. A thunder of knocks: no time to dress (even for a woman alone) or the door will crash in. On opening, in charge the soldiers—literally charge—with fixed bayonets and in full war-kit.”\n\nSusan Byrne, ‘Keeping company with the enemy’: gender and sexual violence against women during the Irish War of Independence and Civil War, 1919–1923\n\nOne cannot overestimate how much damage the fear of violence can cause leading to complex trauma, PTSD, anxiety, and depression, amongst other mental conditions. The threat of rape, especially if it was sanctioned by the government, reinforced a woman’s precarious position within Irish society, making them feel alone, worthless, and in constant danger.\n\nWomen not only had to sacrifice their loved ones to a civil war no one wanted, they, themselves, became another front of the war where soldiers from both sides tried to forcefully shape Irish society by violating those they saw as vulnerable and within their control.\n\nPersonal Searches\n\nAnother form of assault that is often ignored in the context of war, is the violation of being personally searched. Cultural standards of the time would have dictated that women had to be searched by the same sex, but this didn’t always happen. Even when it was a woman searching another woman, the experience was traumatizing as it completely stole autonomy and privacy from the woman being searched. Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, an awesome feminist and activist recorded a personal search she witnessed:\n\n“Two young girls … were arrested … marched on foot to the barrack square, where they were kept standing for two hours in bitter cold. No 1. was then ordered into the barracks to be searched, she was conducted by a soldier into a small bare room with an undraped window looking out at the barrack square, the door was then locked and she was confronted by a cloaked, masked, and gloved figure, by whom she was stripped absolutely, naked and searched. On resuming her clothes, she was brought back to the square, and the second girl was taken into the barrack and subjected to the same ordeal.”\n\nSusan Byrne, ‘Keeping company with the enemy’: gender and sexual violence against women during the Irish War of Independence and Civil War, 1919–1923\n\nThis often happened upon arrest and frequently in women’s prisons, an experience we’ll discuss in detail in another episode. It was a flagrant violation of a woman’s body and, just as it is overlooked today, it was overlooked during the Irish Civil War as just another condition of war. That didn’t prevent the women who were searched from being traumatized repeatedly by the very state meant to protect and serve them.\n\nHead Shaving\n\nAn incredibly traumatizing tactic used against women during the Irish Civil War was head shaving. Women were often forcefully taken from their homes, usually in their nightwear, taken somewhere isolated, sometimes blindfolded and bound, sometimes held by other men, and their hair shaved off.\n\nThis was to humiliate them and marked them as “wrong”. It wasn’t fashionable for women to wear their hair short at the time and people noticed when women tried to hide what had been done to them. It was a badge of dishonor and served as a warning to others. It also wasn’t uncommon for a woman to be shaved and sexually assaulted, the head shaving tragically ensuring the woman wouldn’t report the assault because she was doubly dishonored. Women were often shaved because they supported the “wrong” side. Either they helped the British during the Irish War of Independence and this was belated punishment or they sided with the “pro-British, anti-Irish” Provisional Government and thus were “traitors” to their own people. One IRA officer explained it as:\n\n“Some young girls created a problem. The British uniform was an attraction for them, as indeed would any uniform. They could be a real danger to the movement and gave bad example by consorting with the enemy. They were warned repeatedly and stronger measures had to be resorted to. No Volunteer liked the job, but on occasions these girls’ hair had to be cut. Years later Dame Fashion was to dictate bobbed hair but at this period of revolution it was deemed shameful.”\n\nLinda Connolly, “Sexual violence in the Irish Civil War: a forgotten war crime?”\n\nThe reason historians label this as sexual assault is because of the traditional connection of a women’s hair with their sexuality. Even today, people will comment when women have incredibly short or shaved heads and make certain assumptions about that women’s gender, sexuality, and personal choices based on how short her hair is. Additionally, these shavings often happened in the middle of the night when women were in bed i.e. vulnerable and in their nightwear i.e. tempting fate. It was almost solely men who carried out the punishment adding to the dimension of sexual assault and male control.\n\nKnown Cases of Rape\n\nAs of the date of this episode, cases of rape and/or gang rape perpetrated by soldiers in the Irish Civil War have been recorded in North Mayo, North Tipperary, Westmeath, and South Armagh. While it is true that, at this point, the data supports the assertion that rape wasn’t used “systematically” during the Irish Civil War, they still occurred, they still traumatized the victims, and they revealed a darker, misogynistic side to Irish society that is still sadly present in all societies in the world. We will discuss three incidents of rape during the Irish Civil War.\n\nThe Rape of Eileen Biggs\n\nThe first case I want to discuss is the case of Eileen Biggs, a Protestant Irish woman. Her experience was recorded in a 1926 Irish Grants Commission application and states that Eileen, her husband, and a guest were in her marital home in the Dromineer area when anti-treaty IRA men took over the house. They locked Eileen in one room and locked her husband and house guest in two different adjourning rooms. The anti-treaty IRA men drank and looted the house before raping Eileen eight or nine different times, hurting her in the process. When the IRA men left, Eileen was found semi-conscious and traumatized. She would never recover from her experience. She spent time in a Dublin hospital before going to England with her husband. She was awarded a 6000 pound compensation. Eileen and her husband moved to Longford Place, Monkstown in Dublin. Eileen died on June 8th, 1950 at St. Patrick’s Hospital, Dublin, a psychiatric hospital. The men who raped her were never identified or brought to justice.\n\nThe Gang Rape of Margaret Doherty\n\nThe second case I want to discuss is the rape of Margaret Doherty, which was only investigated by historians recently after a military services pension application submitted by Margaret’s mother was published online in May 2018. Margaret was living in Foxford during the civil war. She was the only living daughter of the Doherty family. One of her brothers died in Flanders and two of her brothers fought on the anti-treaty IRA side. Margaret was active with Cumann na mBan until her mother grew ill and she needed to stay home and care for her. On May 27th, 1923, a group of Free State soldiers dragged Margaret from her bed, stripped her naked, and raped her. She suffered a traumatic mental breakdown and her mother claims she was total incapacitated until her death on December 28th, 1928 – five years after she was ganged raped. Three doctors who treated Margaret after the incident concur with her mother’s statement.\n\nGeneral of Defense Richard Mulcahy knew of the case and based on his own papers as well as official documents, it was a matter of great contention within the Cosgrave Administration. One of the documents named Lieutenants Watters, Benson, and Mulholland as the perpetrators. Mulcahy directed a court-martial to be held, but it was clear he didn’t believe there was enough evidence to get a conviction. The court-martial was held and on July 25th, 1923, the three lieutenants were found “not guilty” and “honourably” acquitted. It’s doubtful the Minister of Defense made any real effort to get justice for Margaret and the court martial was to placate the outrage within the government and the public generated by the case.\n\nThe Kenmare Case\n\nThe final case I will discuss is maybe the most famous case of the Irish Civil War: the Kenmare case.\n\nOn June 2nd, 1923 three Free State officers: Captain Flood, Captain Clarke, and that piece of shit Major General O’Daly raped the sisters Florence and Jessie McCarthy. The sister’s father, Dr. Randal McCarthy, describe the incident as:\n\n“Florence was confronted by three masked and armed men, one of whom seized her and covered her with a revolver and flashed an electric torch in her face … when she screamed, her little sister ran from her own bedroom to the rescue. One of the three rushed up the stairs and dragged … Jessie, down the stairs by her hair and out of doors … Here she was beaten with a Sam Brown belt, kicked and trodden on by two of the brutes.”\n\nLinda Connolly, Sexual violence in the Irish Civil War: a forgotten war crime?\n\nThe rapists made a mistake when they targeted Dr. Randal’s daughters. He pushed the government to investigate the incident. A court of inquiry was held on June 28th where O’Daly was allowed to attack the integrity of the family, especially of the victims. All of Randall’s witnesses were arrested under the others of Daly and received threats of violence. The Judge Advocate-General Cahar Davitt wrote that he believed the facts revealed during the inquiry supported a:\n\n“A prima facie case against [the three officers] … of having committed serious criminal offences and having been guilty of very scandalous conduct unbecoming the character of officers.” He advised that ‘all three be ordered for trial by Court Martial on charges to be framed in accordance with the facts as disclosed in the evidence given before the Court of Inquiry’.”\n\nLinda Connolly, Sexual violence in the Irish Civil War: a forgotten war crime?\n\nMulcahy, unfortunately and disgustingly, disagreed. He trusted O’Daly and took the general’s word when O’Daly claimed he wasn’t involved at all. Mulcahy claimed that O’Daly was a ‘disciplined, temperate, energetic, intelligent to appreciate civil as well as military requirements, a good disciplinarian and a leader of men’. He personally spoke to O’Daly and ‘asked him straight as man to man’ if he had been involved in the assault on the McCarthys. ‘On his word of honour’, O’Daly had assured him, ‘he was not’. (Linda Connolly, Sexual violence in the Irish Civil War: a forgotten war crime?)\n\nDavitt vehemently disagreed with Mulcahy and suggested that he should consult Attorney-General Hugh Kennedy as ‘the question of whether any such prosecution should be taken [in the ordinary Civil Courts] would have to be decided by Kennedy as Law Adviser or by the Government on his advice’. (Linda Connolly, Sexual violence in the Irish Civil War: a forgotten war crime?) Kennedy agreed with Mulcahy. This pissed O’Higgins off and he threatened to leave the government if it wasn’t handled properly. Other members of the cabinet, like Ernest Blythe, the Minister of Finance, felt that O’Higgins was over exaggerating and that he did not agree with\n\n“O’Higgins in feeling particularly revolted at what seemed to be to be merely a case of a trouple [couple] of tarts getting a few lashes that did them no harm.”\n\nLinda Connolly, Sexual violence in the Irish Civil War: a forgotten war crime?\n\nEven those who supported O’Higgins felt that they couldn’t risk the army’s reputation during a civil war over something that they considered an “ordinary war incident”. The army’s reputation and the reputation of a general who had also been in Collins’ squad was more important than justice for the violated women.\n\nMcCarthy was unsuccessful in pressing his daughters’ case further, but he wrote to O’Higgins in 1927, after O’Higgins became Minister for Justice\n\n“When I see your title, I wonder what justice you meted out to me and mine…Yes, I waited for over three years hoping that I might get some justice from the Free State Government when it re-stabilised but my hopes were in vain.’\n\nLinda Connolly, Sexual violence in the Irish Civil War: a forgotten war crime?\n\nReferences\n\nWomen and the Irish Revolution by Linda Connolly\n\nEveryday Violence in the Irish Civil War by Gemma Clark\n\nSexual violence in the Irish Civil War: a forgotten war crime?
