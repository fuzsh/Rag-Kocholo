The iconic arts and music centre on the banks of the Tyne will be renamed

The Sage Gateshead is being given a brand new name.

It is being changed to The Glasshouse International Centre for Music.

It's as the new Arena, which will replace the current Utilita Arena in Newcastle, is going to take the name of The Sage.

Abigail Pogson is the managing director, and explains why the name change is taking place;

"The arena and conference centre which is going to be built next door to us, are going to be called The Sage

"Because the Sage Group - who gave us our name originally - have invested in the site next door

"which is a brilliant endorsement of the project and the region from Sage Group,

"But obviously we can't cause confusion!!"

The Glasshouse, as it will be known - which is made up of 630 panes of glass, will undergo a full re-brand.

Abigail tells us they are excited for the new era of the venue.

"I'm hoping that the new name will be really memorable, and snappy - that making that switch will be easy,

"Of course it will take a while, it always does - but what we're going to do is talk to people about it, and reinforce it through the autumn and next year,

"And there's a good amount of time to get used to it and make the change."

Work has already started on the groundwork for the new arena and conference centre, which will be based next to the current Sage.
