It’s more than a decade since Sage Gateshead opened. An international centre for music, education and conferences housed within a striking stainless steel structure designed by Norman Foster, the Sage dominates the skyline on the NewcastleGateshead Quayside.

Northern Soul‘s North East photographer, Phil Pounder, was allowed exclusive access into the building – and here are the fantastic results. We think you’ll agree that it’s a beautiful building.
