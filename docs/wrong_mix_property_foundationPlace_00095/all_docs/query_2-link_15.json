She has continued to make me proud for the 32 years since that event.\n\nWhat is your alma mater?\n\nB.A. and L.L.B.: University of Witwaterstrand, Johannesburg, South Africa L.L.M.: London School of Economics\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nThe next project for our firm is the continued building of our New York business as well as establishing a more formal European presence, which is in the works.\n\nWho is your hero?\n\nWhile I admire people like Winston Churchill, John Kennedy, Yitzhak Rabin, Warren Buffett and Howard Schultz, my true hero is my father, Mendel Vidergauz. He has lived a life of great courage and integrity, he is very smart and rational with an open heart to all people, and at 98 years old, remains a very cool guy.\n\nWhat do you like best about Los Angeles?\n\nI like that Los Angeles is a big, warmhearted place welcoming to people of all backgrounds, open to new ideas, and encouraging of entrepreneurship. It is also a fun place to live with great food and culture, if you look."
