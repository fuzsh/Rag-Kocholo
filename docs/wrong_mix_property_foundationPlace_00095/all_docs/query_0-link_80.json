An international centre for music, education and conferences housed within a striking stainless steel structure designed by Norman Foster, the Sage dominates the skyline on the NewcastleGateshead Quayside.\n\nNorthern Soul‘s North East photographer, Phil Pounder, was allowed exclusive access into the building – and here are the fantastic results. We think you’ll agree that it’s a beautiful building.\n\nTo read Northern Soul’s interview with the former long-term director of the Sage, click here.\n\nBy Phil Pounder\n\nPhil Pounder\n\nPhil Pounder is Northern Soul‘s North East Photographer. A Durham University maths graduate whose artistic/creative side has taken 40 years to fight its way out of his logical brain, Phil is originally from County Durham. Via a seven-year stint in London, he now lives in Low Fell and works for an IT consultancy based in Newcastle upon Tyne. Phil can be found on twitter @glasses502. www.philpounderphotography.com"
