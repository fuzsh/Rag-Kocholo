        "text": "I really can’t believe it’s May already. I think it’s probably because of the dreadful weather we’ve had up until now – cold and rainy with little sign of spring. Hopefully that will change from now on and next week I’m due to travel to Bristol to take part in CrimeFest, my favourite and, in my opinion, most friendly crime fiction festival. I’m participating in two panels this year. On Thursday 9th May I’ll be discussing abuses of privilege and power and on Sunday 12th I’m moderating a panel about crime fiction set between the wars. Should be fun and I hope to meet some of you there.\n\nOn a sadder note, this week saw the death of our beloved family dog, Finley (he was our younger son’s dog really but he stayed with us a lot and we came to love him). He was thirteen and his health had been deteriorating for a few months but losing him was still very difficult. He was a gorgeous border collie with a beautiful gentle nature and I’ve been very touched by the messages of condolence I received on Twitter (or should I say X). He is immortalized, however, in my book The Shadow Collector where he features as the heroic dog who helps Wesley to make a dramatic discovery. Sleep well, Fin.\n\nTo return to crime fiction, on 11th April I had a wonderful evening at the Serenity Bookshop in Romiley, Stockport where I launched the new paperback of The Killing Place, Wesley Peterson’s 27th investigation. It was lovely to meet such a large and enthusiastic audience there and many thanks to Chris and Kerry, the owners, for making me so welcome.\n\nWith Wesley’s 28th case, Coffin Island, ready to be published in early August, I’ve been working hard on the next in the series (number 29 – working title Murder Moon, although this may change). After I’ve completed this, I’ll begin work on a new Joe Plantagenet book – quite an exciting prospect! I’ll let you into a secret – I’ll have to re-read the first five before I start because as soon as I’ve finished a book, I tend to forget all about it and move on to the next – and it has been rather a long time since Joe solved a spooky crime in the mean snickleways of Eborby (aka York)!\n\nOver the next few months, I’ll be out and about visiting libraries etc so do look at my events page and come and say hello if you can. Looking forward to seeing you.\n\nA (very) belated Happy New Year to everyone. It seems a long time since Christmas but I do hope everyone enjoyed the Festive Season – and maybe received some of my books in their Christmas stockings.\n\nAfter New Year I got straight back to work and I’m now 50,000 into the first draft of Wesley Peterson’s 29th case. This time Neil is tackling the excavation of a crashed World War Two plane on Dartmoor and Wesley’s investigating the mysterious death of a ghost writer in a chocolate box village nearby. However, that’s all I can really say about it at the moment because I’m still working my way through the plot.\n\nThe beginning of this month saw the publication of my next three Joe Planagenet books (there are five in all) with gorgeous new covers. SEEKING THE DEAD and PLAYING WITH BONES have now been joined by KISSING THE DEMONS, WATCHING THE GHOSTS and WALKING BY NIGHT and now that this series is more widely available, I really hope more people will be able discover Joe’s spooky investigations in the ancient Northern city of Eborby (which closely resembles the lovely, historic and very haunted city of York). I’m so thrilled that I’ll soon be able to continue this series, although it might be a while (because of my publisher’s schedule) before the next one appears on the shelves.\n\nAs well as writing, I’ve been busy arranging events for 2024. A couple of weeks ago I was delighted to find that a brand new independent bookshop had opened not far from where I live. I noticed that a fellow writer, Anthony Johnson, was launching his new book there so I went along to support him and I’m please to say that his new series, about a dog-sitter detective is proving very popular. I’ve noticed recently that people are beginning to enjoy the, shall we say, cosier end of the crime fiction market. Perhaps this is because the world is so troubled at the moment that readers want to escape into a more comfortable and certain place when they settle down with a book (I believe this happened in the 1930s as well). I’ve always tried to keep my own books fairly ‘cosy and classic’ because this is the type of book I’ve always enjoyed reading. I’m so pleased to see that fashion in reading appears to be catching up with me!\n\nThe shop where Anthony spoke is called the Serenity Bookshop in Romiley near Stockport and I’m pleased to say that I’m doing an event there to celebrate the launch of THE KILLING PLACE paperback on April 11th (see my Events page for details). Do come along if you can make it. I’ll also be speaking at some libraries as well as attending Alibis in the Archives at Gladstones Library and CrimeFest in Bristol. Hope to meet some of you there.\n\nBetter get back to writing. Neil’s just dug up a skeleton that definitely shouldn’t be there!\n\nI’m writing this in the middle of all my Christmas preparations although so far they’re going well. The cards have all been sent, the presents have been wrapped, the carol services have been attended (although a cold I suffered from recently has robbed me of my singing voice) and this morning the turkey was caught and is now safely stashed in the fridge. As well as this I’ve completed the copy edit for Wesley’s next case (COFFIN ISLAND – out in the summer) and I’ve even started to plan his investigation for 2025 (although I’m afraid I’ve had to abandon writing for the time being to concentrate on the Festive Season).\n\nA few days ago I received a rather nice Christmas present. My publisher has given me a contract for three new books (two Wesley Petersons and a brand new Joe Plantagenet). The good news is that three of my Joe Plantagenet books, KISSING THE DEMONS, WATCHING THE GHOSTS and WALKING BY NIGHT (rather spooky and set in Eborby – a thinly disguised York) will be issued by Little, Brown with beautiful new covers on 1st February 2024 – not long to go now. I must say I’m really looking forward to resuming this particular series and earlier this week I spent a few days Christmas shopping in York - and picking up a few new ideas of course.\n\nHowever, the real purpose of this short update is to wish all my readers a wonderful Christmas and a happy, healthy and prosperous New Year.\n\nAnd here’s something that I hope will make you smile. I’ve been thinking up a few new lyrics to famous Christmas songs – lyrics suited to the world of classic detective stories!\n\nThis one’s to be sung to the tune of Santa Claus is Coming to Town:\n\nYOU’D BETTER THINK UP A GOOD ALIBI\n\nIT BETTER BE CONVINCING, I’M TELLING YOU WHY\n\nHERCULE POIROT’S COMING TO TOWN\n\nHE’S MAKING A LIST\n\nHE’S CHECKING IT TWICE\n\nTHOSE LITTLE GREY CELLS WILL WORK IN A TRICE\n\nHERCULE POIROT’S COMING TO TOWN\n\nHE KNOWS WHEN YOU’VE BEEN LYING\n\nHE KNOWS WHO DID THE CRIME\n\nHE KNOWS IF YOU’VE BEEN BAD OR GOOD\n\nAND WHO DESERVES TO BE DOING TIME\n\nSO YOU’D BETTER THINK UP A GOOD ALIBI\n\nIT BETTER BE CONVINCING, I’M TELLING YOU WHY\n\nHERCULE POIROT’S COMING TO TOWN\n\nAnd finally here’s a revised verse for Walking in a Winter Wonderland:\n\nIN THE MEADOW WE CAN BUILD A SNOWMAN\n\nAND PRETEND THAT HE IS FATHER BROWN\n\nHE’LL SAY ‘HAVE YOU SOLVED IT?’\n\nWE’LL SAY ‘NO, MAN’\n\n‘WELL I CAN DO THE JOB WHILE I’M IN TOWN’!\n\nA very happy Christmas to everyone – and happy reading. See you next year!\n\nSummer is well and truly at an end and, during my breaks from writing, I’ve been trying to spend time tidying up in the garden. It’s also the time of year when I buy a new diary and there are already a few entries for library talks and conferences in 2024 (I’ve already signed up for CrimeFest in Bristol next May). Watch out for any events near you. I always love meeting my readers.\n\nThe last few months have been busy as usual. I’ve just finished Wesley’s next case, entitled Coffin Island and my editor loved reading it. I’ll say more about it nearer publication time but, I must say, I’m quite pleased with this one.\n\nAs well as working hard, I’ve also managed to get away on holiday. In early September I visited Devon again and we were blessed with a week of glorious weather. My excuse is that I have to carry out research for my Wesley Peterson mysteries but the truth is, I just love it down there. I visited several lovely bookshops while I was there. I signed books at Browser Books and the Community Bookshop in Dartmouth and at Harbour Books in Kingsbridge. I also visited the fantastic Ivybridge Bookshop where I spoke to an enthusiastic audience about my work and the life of a crime writer. I also met a fellow writer there; top chef and food writer, Orlando Murrin, who is about to publish his first crime novel. I had the pleasure of reading Knife Skills for Beginners before my visit and I enjoyed it very much.\n\nWhile I was in Devon I did my usual pilgrimage to Greenway, the holiday home of Agatha Christie. I walked there with my husband from Kingswear (on the opposite bank of the River Dart from Dartmouth). It’s quite a challenging walk; only about three and a half miles through woodland but very steep in places. We always feel much fitter when we’ve been to Dartmouth!\n\nAfter returning from Devon I travelled to Nottingham to speak at Bromley House Library, a flourishing independent library founded in 1816. It was so good to meet everyone there and many thanks to the staff there for the warm welcome I received.\n\nAt the start of this month we decided to grab some last minute sunshine and fly to the lovely Greek island of Rhodes. It was our first visit and we were bowled over by the amazing old town, the lovely people and the fantastic food. And the cats! So many cats! I suspect they rule the place. On our return we watched a DVD I had of the Poirot episode Triangle at Rhodes. It was good to be reminded of our holiday.\n\nMy editor has just sent through pictures of the new covers for my soon to be re-released Joe Plantagenet books, Kissing the Demons, Watching the Ghosts and Walking by Night. I’m really pleased with them and I understand that they will be available in early February 2024. I’m also delighted to announce that Wesley’s latest case, The Killing Place, will be out in paperback on 11th April next year.\n\nWell, summer seems to have been and gone but the season makes little difference to an author. There are books to write and deadlines to fulfill and I’m lucky to have a lovely office in my garden which is good to work in come rain or shine.\n\nHowever, there are always distractions when you’re ‘working from home’ and my own distraction during June’s great weather was the arrival of my youngest son and his family (my daughter in law, two very little girls plus dog). They’ve been living with us while building work’s been done on their house and I’d almost forgotten what it’s like to live with small children (with all the cooking, entertainment and washing that entails). All the memories returned of trying to cram all my writing into the period when the children were at school/nursery and I must confess it does help to focus the mind. So much so that I managed to complete Wesley’s next case (working title Coffin Island) in record time. I’ve sent it off to my editor and I’m just waiting to receive her comments.\n\nI’ve still managed to get out and about. I attended a wonderful Crime Writers’ Association conference in York (one of my favourite places) in April. The highlight (apart from catching up with my fellow writers) was a gala dinner in the reconstructed Victorian street in the Castle Museum (once the prison where, among others, Dick Turpin was held and executed). In May I was in Bristol for CrimeFest, probably the friendliest crime fiction festival of the year. I participated in two panels and I was thrilled to find myself speaking alongside Simon Brett, one of my favourite authors, and Robert Thorogood, the creator of Death in Paradise.\n\nI’ve also been visiting libraries, presenting my murder mystery ‘The Case of the Late Cook’ at Leigh Library in Lancashire and speaking at Cleethorpes library in Lincolnshire. Taking part in events and meeting readers is one of the best parts of a writer’s job!\n\nThe good news is that Wesley Peterson’s twenty seventh case with be out in hardback and ebook on 3rd August. Here’s a little taste of THE KILLING PLACE:\n\nNovember. With the tourist season well and truly over in South Devon, Detective Inspector Wesley Peterson is looking forward to a quieter month in the CID. But when a man is shot dead on Bonfire Night, he finds he has a disturbing and complex murder case on his hands.\n\nThe body of Patrick North was found in woodland connected to Nesbarton Hall, a grand estate dating back to the eighteenth century. North worked for the Smithson family who now own the estate. The family are away on holiday, but when an anonymous letter threatening to abduct the Smithson son is uncovered, Wesley fears North’s death might have been collateral damage in a sinister kidnap plot.\n\nMeanwhile, archaeologist Dr Neil Watson discovers a hidden grotto in a developer’s field – land that was once part of the Nesbarton estate. Evidence of past rituals and the shocking discovery of a skeleton buried next to the grotto raise questions about strange occurrences, past and present,on the estate that was once owned by a notorious privateer.\n\nThen, just when Wesley’s team seem to be making progress in their investigation, a resident of the nearby village is killed in a near identical shooting. A race is on to find the ruthless killer, before they strike again . . .\n\nI do hope everyone enjoys Wesley’s new investigation.\n\nFinally I have exciting news for my readers. I can now reveal that all my Joe Plantagenet books are to be reissued by Little Brown (the publisher of my Wesley Peterson series) and I have agreed to continue the series (which, hopefully, means more visits to York to carry out research!). I have received many emails asking whether I was going to write more about Joe and now I can give the answer ‘yes’. However, all Wesley’s fans needn’t worry because his investigations will continue as well.\n\nI’m not sure whether it’s too late to wish all my readers a very happy new year. Probably, but I’ll do it anyway. Happy New Year. I hope everyone had a good Christmas (although it seems a long time ago now).\n\nI do hope everyone enjoyed the short story I posted over the Christmas period The Third Elf. It was great fun writing a Christmas story featuring Wesley Peterson and the team. Perhaps it’s something I’ll do again next year.\n\nSince the Festive Season I’ve settled down to writing again and I’ve been hard at work. Wesley’s next case The Killing Place, is now finished and it will be published this coming August. Finishing a manuscript is only the start of a long process before publication. First my editor gives me her notes on how the story can be refined and improved. Then it goes to the copy editor who does a more detailed edit, looking for repetition and any other errors. After that it goes to the proofreader. During the process the design of the jacket is decided on (I must say, my publisher’s given me some lovely covers). Only when everything is in place is it released into the world.\n\nOnce I’d completed The Killing Place, I was asked to write a short story with a Beatles theme. Needless to say, as a Liverpool girl brought up in the same area as Paul and John, I jumped at the chance. The story is called Happiness is a Warm Gun and was inspired by something that happened to me as a teenager (not murder I hasten to add). It contains a lot of Beatles references and I think it will be published in an anthology in the States. I’ll let you know once I have the details.\n\nThe good news is that Serpent’s Point is out in paperback (and cheaper ebook) at the beginning of March – and it will be stocked in most Sainsbury’s stores in the country which is fantastic. Earlier this month my publisher made it available on Kindle for one day only for 99p and the result was spectacular. It reached number 1 in historical mysteries and police procedurals and number 9 in the whole Kindle chart (above Prince Harry!)\n\nSerpent’s Point in South Devon is the focus of local legends. The large house on the headland is shrouded in an ancient tale of evil, and when a woman is found strangled on the coastal path nearby, DI Wesley Peterson is called in to investigate.\n\nThe woman had been house-sitting at Serpent’s Point and Wesley is surprised to discover that she was conducting an investigation of her own into unsolved missing persons cases. Could these enquires have led to her murder? In the meantime, while the case takes Wesley to Yorkshire and the Cotswolds, his friend, archaeologist Neil Watson makes a dramatic discovery of his own in a field near Serpent’s Point.\n\nThen, when a skeleton is uncovered, the pressure rises to find a killer and Wesley and Neil discover that Serpent’s Point holds more deadly secrets than anyone could have imagined.\n\nAs I mentioned, I’ve already started writing Wesley’s next case but I also intend to get out and about this year. I’m looking forward to attending the annual Crime Writers’ Association Conference (York in April) and CrimeFest (Bristol in May) where I hope to meet lots of readers.\n\nThat’s it for now. Happy Reading!\n\nSummer’s finally over but I’ve been making the most of the beautiful weather we’ve had for the past few months by working hard in my garden office. I’ve now completed Wesley’s next investigation and I can now reveal the title – The Killing Place. I will reveal more about it nearer the time of publication next year.\n\nWhen I’ve not been writing I’ve been getting out and about taking part in events. At the start of September I presented a fun Murder Mystery evening at Ellesmere Port Library (who will ever forget the clairvoyant!). I really enjoy visiting libraries to do talks and present murder mysteries (it’s wonderful to discover the wealth of acting talent amongst the library staff).\n\nIn the middle of September I travelled down to Torquay to take part in the International Agatha Christie Festival. I was particularly honoured to be invited because it was reading Agatha Christie’s books in my formative years that led me to become a crime writer. At the Festival I was in conversation with Robert Goddard, a writer whose work I’ve admired for many years, and I also presented two light-hearted Murder Mysteries at local libraries which were greatly enjoyed by everyone.\n\nWhile I was in Devon it was a great pleasure to visit and sign books at some of the county’s lovely bookshops, including Browser Books in Dartmouth, Waterstones in Torquay and The Ivybridge Bookshop in Ivybridge. Many thanks to everyone for a warm welcome I received.\n\nAt the end of September I took another short break from writing to visit northern Italy, exploring the historic cities of Mantua, Padua and Vicenza. It was my idea of a perfect holiday (I adore anywhere with medieval buildings) and it’s certainly true that you’ll never go hungry in Italy. It was certainly an inspiring trip and, who knows, Wesley might be enjoying a similar break in the future.\n\nHappy reading.\n\nIt seems a long time since I attended CrimeFest in Bristol. I can’t believe the months flash by so fast. CrimeFest itself was fantastic and it was lovely to see my fellow writers again after so long. I took part in panels; the first discussed the enduring fascination with historical crime fiction and the second concerned the advantages and disadvantages of writing a long running series (something I know a lot about). All in all it was concluded that the pros of writing a series outweighed the cons and I would certainly agree with this. I love writing about Wesley, Gerry, Neil and Rachel; they’ve become almost like family and I never tire of thinking up new challenges for them.\n\nSince my visit to Bristol I’ve been working hard on Wesley Peterson’s next case and it’s now been accepted by my publisher. It hasn’t got a title yet (my working title didn’t really ‘work’) but all I can say at the moment is that it involves Georgian secret societies, a series of mysterious shootings in a Devon village and an eighteenth century privateer (a more respectable name for pirate).\n\nIn between bouts of writing, there’s been some time for leisure – but is a writer ever at leisure when even the most relaxed trip turns into research for a future book or short story? In June I had a break in northern France with my husband and some friends. We were based in Rouen (a delightfully historical town) and enjoyed trips to see the Bayeux tapestry, Arramanche beach, the site of the D Day landings, and Monet’s house & garden (photo below) at Giverny.\n\nIt was a fascinating holiday but one of the highlights for me was visiting the Aitre Saint Maclou, a courtyard in the centre of Rouen surrounded by a half timbered ossuary. The courtyard was a plague cemetery and the surrounding buildings were constructed to house the bones of the dead. The building resembled a black and white manor house courtyard – except for the carvings on the wooden beams depicting skulls, bones and gravediggers’ implements. I have a feeling it (or something very like it) might feature in a future story!\n\nThe big news, however, is that Wesley Peterson’s twenty sixth case, SERPENT’S POINT, is now out in hardback and ebook.\n\nSerpent’s Point in South Devon is the focus of local legends. The large house on the headland is shrouded in an ancient tale of evil, and when a woman is found strangled on the coastal path nearby, DI Wesley Peterson is called in to investigate.\n\nThe woman had been house-sitting at Serpent’s Point and Wesley is surprised to discover that she was conducting an investigation of her own into unsolved missing persons cases. Could these enquires have led to her murder? In the meantime, while the case takes Wesley to Yorkshire and the Cotswolds, his friend, archaeologist Neil Watson makes a dramatic discovery of his own in a field near Serpent’s Point.\n\nThen, when a skeleton is uncovered, the pressure rises to find a killer and Wesley and Neil discover that Serpent’s Point holds more deadly secrets than anyone could have imagined.\n\nIt’s already had some fantastic reviews and I hope all my readers enjoy it.\n\nNext month I’ll be travelling to Devon to take part in the International Agatha Christie Festival (as well as undertaking more research). https://www.iacf-uk.org/festival-2022\n\nI’m very much looking forward to taking part, especially as I will be in conversation with Robert Goddard, a writer whose work I’ve admired for many years. I also hope to visit some book shops while I’m down in the South West and I hope this will give me an opportunity to meet some of my readers.\n\nI’ve just realised with horror that I haven’t written this diary since Christmas. The truth is time has whizzed by so fast since then. Like a creature emerging from hibernation after the winter, I’ve been getting out and about again visiting bookshops and libraries. It has been so wonderful to see people again after the terrible couple of years of restrictions.\n\nSerpent’s Point is now finished and will be published in August. Also The Stone Chamber is now out in paperback and I was thrilled to see it ‘in the wild’ on the shelves of my local Sainsbury’s!\n\nIn January I began writing a new Wesley Peterson mystery and I’ve been working really hard on it since then. I won’t say anything about it yet as my editor hasn’t set eyes on it yet. More news about that later.\n\nAs well as writing, it’s been lovely to do events again. I presented two murder mysteries in March at Kirkby in Ashfield and Newark in Nottinghamshire. I never cease to be amazed at the hidden talents of the library staff who take the parts so brilliantly.\n\nI also took part in Wrexham’s Carnival of Words, presenting my Murder Mystery The Case of the Late Cook, with a fantastic cast who did the script proud. It’s been so lovely to meet people again and it’s great to see everyone enjoying themselves.\n\nOne highlight of my year so far was the recent Crime Writers’ Association conference in Torquay which, thanks to Covid, had been cancelled for two years running. Inevitably, the conference had an Agatha Christie theme (as Torquay was Dame Agatha’s birthplace) and we went on a fascinating walk taking in many locations connected with her life in the town. My colleagues were so pleased to get together again and, with interesting talks, plenty of food and drink and good company, a good time was had by all. I even swam in the outdoor pool at the hotel – in April! They don’t call it the English Riviera for nothing. I’ll be returning there in September for the International Agatha Christie Festival. Watch this space!\n\nLater this month I’ll be in Bristol for CrimeFest where I’ll be taking part in panels about historical crime fiction and writing a long running series. I’m really looking forward to it. Hopefully I’ll see some of you there.\n\nChristmas seems to come round faster every year and what a strange year 2021 has been. It was wonderful to regain some normality over the summer and autumn but now it seems that we have to face restrictions again.\n\nWhen we were allowed our freedom, I decided to make the most of it and do something I’ve wanted to do for many years. I went to see Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap in London – something every crime writer should do once in their lifetime. It was extremely enjoyable and so good to get back into a theatre after all this time. Of course I can’t tell you whodunit because the audience are sworn to secrecy but I confess that I did guess the culprit!\n\nAfter that treat I’ve been working hard and I’ve now finished my next Wesley mystery, Serpent’s Point, (and my publisher is very pleased with it).\n\nSerpent’s Point in South Devon is the focus of local legends. The large house on the headland is shrouded in an ancient tale of evil, and when a woman is found strangled on the coastal path nearby, DI Wesley Peterson is called in to investigate.\n\nThe woman had been house-sitting at Serpent’s Point and Wesley is surprised to discover that she was conducting an investigation of her own into unsolved missing persons cases. Could these enquires have led to her murder? In the meantime, while the case takes Wesley to Yorkshire and the Cotswolds, his friend, archaeologist Neil Watson makes a dramatic discovery of his own in a field near Serpent’s Point.\n\nThen, when a skeleton is uncovered, the pressure rises to find a killer and Wesley and Neil discover that Serpent’s Point holds more deadly secrets than anyone could have imagined.\n\nI can’t believe this will be Wesley’s twenty sixth investigation (it only seems like yesterday that my first novel, The Merchant’s House, was published). And the good news is that I’ve just signed a contract with my publisher, Little, Brown, for two further Wesley Peterson novels.\n\nAnother piece of good news is that The Stone Chamber will be stocked in all Sainsbury’s stores when it comes out in paperback in March 2022.\n\nFinally, here’s a festive treat for all my readers – a special Christmas case for Wesley Peterson and Gerry Heffernan featuring a very dodgy Santa and his highly suspicious team of elves. I do hope you enjoy it!\n\nLet me take this opportunity to wish all my readers a very Happy Christmas and a peaceful and healthy New Year. All best wishes for 2022 – let’s hope it’s a good one!\n\nIt’s been a busy couple of months and it’s been wonderful to take part in live events again. It was a little daunting at first after so many months of restrictions and I felt a bit ‘rusty’ and out of practice but it was amazing how quickly I began to enjoy being out and about again.\n\nIn August I travelled up to Whitley Bay to attend the launch of MANY DEADLY RETURNS, a fantastic anthology celebrating twenty one years of Murder Squad. The launch was a lovely event held in The Bound, Whitley Bay’s brand new bookshop, and attended by all Murder Squad members. The anthology has already attracted some great reviews such as this one from Publishers’ Weekly https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780727890931\n\nEarlier this month I travelled to Devon where, as well as a lot of walking and sightseeing, I carried out some research for Wesley Peterson’s next case. I did some book signings while I was there and a big thanks to Browser Books in Dartmouth and The Harbour Bookshop in Kingsbridge for making me so welcome. On the way back up north I also visited The Snug Bookshop in Bridgewater, Somerset where I met up with my fellow Murder Squaddie, Ann Cleeves.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay in Devon this year was taking part in a ‘Desert Island Books’ evening at Totnes Library. I had to choose ten of my favourite books and extracts were read by a local drama group who certainly did them justice. It was a really enjoyable evening and it was so good to meet readers and library staff again. Thank you to everyone involved!\n\nI’m really thrilled that THE STONE CHAMBER has been very well received and will be out in paperback next March.\n\nAt last I’ve sent the manuscript of Wesley’s twenty sixth case to my publisher and the good news is that I’ve been given a contract for two more. My visit to Devon (where the books are set) certainly gave me some new ideas!"
