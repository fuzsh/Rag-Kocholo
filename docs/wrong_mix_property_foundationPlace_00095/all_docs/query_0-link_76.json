        "text": "She’s a good writer, Jodi Picoult. Sales – more than 40 million books sold – vouch for that. But the American bestseller writer is a good talker, too.\n\nOn television this week she has been venting her fears surrounding the incoming Trump presidency.\n\nWhy? Because once again she has brought out a novel that appears to sit on the cutting edge of topicality.\n\nSmall Great Things is about racism, an issue much in the news now. It begins when an experienced African American nurse in a Connecticut hospital is forbidden from touching a newborn baby because the parents, white supremacists, have ordered it.\n\nThe hospital bows to the instruction. Then, with the nurse, Ruth, alone in the nursery, the baby falls ill. What should she do? What will she do? You simply have to know.\n\nAs she revealed on the TV news this week, Picoult embarked on her latest novel after hearing of a similar real life case in America.\n\nBy her own admission, it was “a hard book to write”.\n\nEnlarging on that, she says: “Racism is a topic that weighs heavily on the hearts of people in my country and heavily on my heart but most white people have no idea how to talk about it.\n\n“It’s very easy to make a mistake when we talk about racism – or to unintentionally offend someone. And so, as a result, white people often don’t talk about it at all.\n\n“For example, I had been trying to write a book about racism for 20 years but couldn’t figure out how to do it. I kept asking myself: why do I have the right to write it? I grew up white and privileged.\n\n“True, I do research. True, I’ve written about many kinds of people I’m not: rape victims, cancer patients, school shooters, men... but racism is different.\n\n“The answer came in realising who my audience was. Yes, I hope people of colour read the book and find it resonant. But I really am reaching out to white people who, like me, like many of my friends, would never think of themselves as racists but need to think a little harder.\n\n“I was pretty blissfully ignorant about racism before I began this book because I had the luxury of being ignorant. Now I can’t not see race and I can’t stop discussing it.”\n\nPicoult says she knew she wanted to write from the point of view of several characters, an African American nurse, a skinhead father and a defence lawyer, a well-intentioned white lady who would never consider herself racist.\n\nShe read “many books” about social justice and enrolled in a social justice workshop where she heard people’s stories.\n\nShe listened to an Asian American woman recount her love/hate relationship with eye liner because of her features. She heard a black woman say she had to put on a mask every day just to act the way white people needed to her act.\n\nSays Picoult: “I left in tears every night as I came to see that I was not nearly as blameless as I thought I was.\n\n“I then sat down with women of colour who overlooked my ignorance and graciously shared their successes, failures, hopes and fears.\n\n“There was the young black mother who recounted her panic after police shot yet another unarmed black youth. She showed me pictures of her beautiful baby and asked how she could possibly keep him safe forever.”\n\nPicoult says she interviewed two former skinheads for hours.\n\n“They explained to me what white supremacists believe, described some of the violence they had personally inflicted and told me how the movement has changed its approach since its heyday in the 1980s.\n\n“Now skinheads let their hair grow out and dress like us – and they don’t run in violent crews in inner cities. They are connected on the internet, spreading hate in local communities.”\n\nShe says her mistake for most of her life has been to assume racism was synonymous with bias. Racism, she argues, “is systemic and institutional… and yet it is both perpetuated and dismantled in individual acts.\n\n“Of all my books, this one will stand out for me because of the sea change it inspired in the way I think about myself and how far I still have to go in terms of racial awareness.”\n\nPicoult says she came to realise in writing the book that her audience for it was not people of colour.\n\n“There is nothing I can tell them about their lives they don’t already know. My audience was white people. I wanted them to realise that although it’s easy to point to a skinhead and say that’s a racist, it’s harder to point to oneself and say the same.\n\n“To that end, I had to create the voice of black woman but in a way that was empathetic and authentic – not just me trying to figure out what it might be.\n\n“I was as diligent as I could be trying to learn from women of colour and asking them for their help in creating Ruth’s voice and I truly could not and would not have done it without them.\n\n“As for writing a white supremacist... I honestly had to come down from my office each time and take a shower.”"
