        "text": "About\n\nThe original Northern Powerhouse, Newcastle upon Tyne has witnessed countless transformations over the last century or so, from its industrial heyday, when Tyneside engineering and innovation led the world, through decades of post-industrial decline, and underinvestment, to its more recent reinvention as a cultural destination for the North.\n\nThe ten short stories gathered here all feature characters in search of something, a new reality, a space, perhaps, in which to rediscover themselves: from the call-centre worker imagining herself far away from the claustrophobic realities of her day job, to the woman coming to terms with an ex-lover who’s moved on all too quickly, to the man trying to outrun his mother’s death on Town Moor. The Book of Newcastle brings together some of the city’s most renowned literary talents, along with exciting new voices, proving that while Newcastle continues to feel the effects of its lost industrial past, it is also a city striving for a future that brims with promise.\n\nPress\n\nOne of Stylist Magazine's '10 books everyone will be reading in January 2020'.\n\nFeaturing Portico Prize winning author Jessica Andrews - read her story 'Blood Brothers' at The London Magazine\n\nRead Julia Darling's story 'Calling from Newcastle' at The Morning Star\n\nOne of The Irish Times' 'Books to Watch Out for in 2020'\n\nAs featured in Wasafiri Magazine's 'Writing Britain Now' series.\n\nRead an interview with editors Angela Readman and Zoe Turner at NRTH LASS\n\nRead an interview with co-editor Angela Readman at The State of the Arts.\n\nRead an interview with contributing author Jessica Andrews at Northern Soul.\n\nListen to a discussion about The Book of Newcastle on Up North Books podcast.\n\n'A city examined from multiple angles, obliquely, without care to promote or sugar-coat.
