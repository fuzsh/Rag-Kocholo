        "text": "Sage 50 Accounting at a Glance\n\nSage 50 received an overall score of 4.3 stars out of 5 stars against our rating system. Below is a breakdown of the key metrics that went into calculating the score.\n\nSage declined to provide a comment about its scoring.\n\nSage 50 Accounting Pricing and Plans\n\nSage 50 accounting offers three plans, differentiated by price, number of users and functionality.\n\n*You get a discount when you pay for the entire year upfront as opposed to on a monthly basis.\n\n*The Pro plan only supports one user. The Premium and Quantum plans allow for more users, but the table contains the starting prices for one user.\n\nPro Plan\n\nThe Pro plan is priced at $595 per year or $58.92 per month. It provides basic accounting features for solopreneurs and small businesses, including:\n\nInvoicing\n\nExpense tracking\n\nFinancial reporting\n\nJob costing\n\nInventory management\n\nPremium Plan\n\nThe Premium plan starts at $970 per year or $96.58 per month for one user. The price increases for every account you add up to five users. This plan builds off of the previous one with:\n\nFinancial reporting by department\n\nJob costing by phase and cost level\n\nSerialized inventory tracking\n\nQuantum Plan\n\nThe Quantum plan starts at $1,610 per year or $160 per month for one user. The price increases for each additional user up to 40 users. This plan adds two key features aside from more users:\n\nRole-based user permissions\n\nWorkflow management\n\nSage 50 Accounting Features\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the features we mentioned in the previous section.\n\nHow To Use Sage 50 Accounting\n\nWe used the Sage 50 test drive to get an idea of how the platform worked. To get access to the test drive, we submitted our information using the contact form on Sage’s website. A sales representative followed up via email with the link to the test drive. We pressed “Next” through the test drive, as it took us through the main features with explanation bubbles. Below are the key elements that stood out to us.\n\nReporting\n\nThe platform creates financial statements, including balance sheets, cash flow statements and income statements, for you. Each statement has a “Customize” button if you want to edit the information.\n\nInvoicing\n\nYou can access the invoicing feature by clicking the “Sales Invoice” tab from the left side menu. The below box will appear for you to create a new invoice by filling in the customer name, amount due and other details.\n\nInventory Tracking\n\nYou can access the inventory management feature from the “Inventory & Services” tab on the left side bar. From there, you can track stock levels, purchase orders, preferred suppliers and more.\n\nOther Sage Accounting Products\n\nSage offers other financial products, including Sage 100 and Sage 300. While Sage 50 is built for small businesses, Sage 100 and 300 have more extensive features for larger companies.\n\nSage 50 Accounting Alternatives\n\nIt’s important to consider several accounting software solutions during your search to find the one that best suits your business’ needs. Below, we compare Sage 50 with a couple popular alternatives.\n\nSage 50 Accounting vs. Xero\n\nSage 50 is built for small businesses. It has basic accounting features, excelling in inventory management specifically. It also integrates with other Sage products to give you a well-rounded business management system.\n\nXero is also built for small businesses. It has three plan offerings like Sage 50, but they’re a fraction of the cost with more features. For example, all plans can manage W-2 employee forms, 1099 contractor forms and sales taxes. Receipt capture is included in the plans as opposed to being an add-on, and there are more integrations.\n\nSage 50 Accounting vs. FreshBooks\n\nSage 50 has three plan offerings for small businesses. FreshBooks offers three small business plans plus a custom-priced fourth plan for growing, mid-sized businesses. In terms of features, Sage 50 focuses on inventory management. FreshBooks doesn’t have inventory management in any of its plans, but it does have extensive invoicing and billing capabilities. For instance, it offers unlimited estimates, invoices and proposals; automated recurring invoices; automated late payment reminders; client retainers and more.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Sage 50 Accounting\n\nSage 50, Sage 100 and Sage 300 are all software solutions from Sage. Sage 50 is purely an accounting platform for small businesses. Sage 100 is an all-in-one solution with accounting capabilities for mid-sized businesses. Sage 300 is another all-in-one solution with accounting, but it has more capabilities for enterprise-level organizations.\n\nYes, Sage 50 Accounting can integrate with other Sage products to create an all-in-one business management solution.\n\nSage 50 Accounting is best for small product-based businesses.

We looked at all-in-one tools, such as QuickBooks, as well as specific tools for mileage tracking and expense management.\n\nWe conducted a survey in 2024 of 200 professionals who were currently using accounting software or had used accounting software within the past year. We analyzed the results of this survey to determine the following rating criteria:\n\nReputation and Reviews (15%)\n\nFeatures (63%)\n\nPricing (10%)\n\nUser Experience (7%)\n\nCustomer Support (5%)"
