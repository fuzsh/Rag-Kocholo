        "text": "A heads-up,\n\nMany Sage Developers are getting the following form-letter email...\n\nWilliam\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\n\nFrom: Mary Nadar <ma...@packtpub.com>\n\nDate: Mon, Jun 28, 2010 at 1:23 AM\n\nSubject: William, Write a \"Sagemath\" Book for Packt Publishing!\n\nTo: wst...@gmail.com\n\nHi William,\n\nI am an author recruiter at Packt Publishing (www.packtpub.com). We\n\npublish computer-related books on a wide variety of IT topics.\n\nWe are planning to publish a new book on Sagemath. While trying to\n\nlook out for potential authors to write this book, I came across one\n\nof your blog and website which shows your expertise in Sagemath. This\n\ngives me an impression that you could be a potential author for this\n\nbook.\n\nDetails of the Book:\n\nTitle: Sagemath Beginners Guide\n\nIt is planned to be a 300 page book targeted at Scientists,\n\nMathematicians and Engineers who want a practical introduction to\n\nSage.\n\nPrerequisite for readers: No knowledge of Sage is expected, basic\n\nknowledge of other programming languages will be an advantage.\n\nTo give you an idea about the way things works at Packt:\n\n- The editorial team at Packt works with the author through out the project.\n\n- We pay a royalty of 16% and an advance against it.\n\n- The marketing team at Packt ensures that the book is well promoted.\n\n- In its ongoing commitment to OpenSource, Packt donates a percentage\n\nof revenue generated by the book to the OpenSource project on which it\n\nis based. We have donated more than 150 000 dollars to various\n\nOpenSource projects since inception in 2004.\n\nCould you please let me know if you find it interesting to write this book?\n\nRegards,\n\nMary.\n\n--\n\nMary Nadar\n\nAuthor Relationship Executive\n\nPackt Publishing\n\nwww.PacktPub.com\n\nMSN: ma...@packtpub.com\n\nInterested in becoming an author? Visit http://authors.packtpub.com\n\nfor all the information you need about writing for Packt.\n\n--\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nProfessor of Mathematics\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nhttp://wstein.org\n\nOn Mon, Jun 28, 2010 at 1:41 PM, Bill Hart <goodwi...@googlemail.com> wrote:\n\n> I don't think it is a click-through.\n\n>\n\n> I think this publisher is for real and actually does quite a good job.\n\n>\n\n> Apart from the fact that the cover illustrations have nothing at all\n\n> to do with the content, their books seem well-written.

In my opinion, the are only two reasonable\n\noptions for publishing Sage-related books:\n\n1. Use an open license and self publish through, e.g., Lulu. The\n\nSage community can do the hard editing work better than most\n\npublishers. (Here's I'm talking mainly about Minh Nguyen.) I think\n\nyou'll earn as much money as you would get from Packt, but you get\n\n100% of the profits instead of 18%, so end buyers pay far less (and\n\nget more -- due to the open license).\n\n2. Publish with a very high quality reputable publisher, e.g.,\n\nSpringer, O'Reilly, AMS, Cambridge, Oxford. They understand the math\n\nworld and can advertise. And they also are starting to understand\n\n\"freeness\".... Case in point: http://wstein.org/ent/\n\n-- William\n\n>\n\n> Bill.\n\n>\n\n> On 28 June, 21:33, \"Justin C.
