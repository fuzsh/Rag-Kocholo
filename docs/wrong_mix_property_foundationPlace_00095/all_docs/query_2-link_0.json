        "text": "British multinational enterprise accounting software company\n\n\"Sage Software\" redirects here. For other uses, see Sage § Software.\n\nNot to be confused with Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies or Sage Publishing.\n\nThe Sage Group plc, commonly known as Sage, is a British multinational enterprise software company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. As of 2017, it is the UK's second largest technology company,[3] the world's third-largest supplier of enterprise resource planning software (behind Oracle and SAP), the largest supplier to small businesses, and has 6.1 million customers worldwide.[4] It has offices in 23 countries.[5] The company is a patron of The Glasshouse, Gateshead music venue in Gateshead.[6]\n\nSage is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.\n\nThe company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller, and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle upon Tyne, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[7]\n\nA student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[8]\n\nIn 1984, the company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[7] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[7] The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[7]\n\nIn 1991, Sage acquired Dac Software, Inc., a pioneering American accounting software developer, from Insilco Corporation who were undergoing bankruptcy reorganization at the time. Dac Software were well known for their DacEasy software suite, which was one of the first integrated accounting software titles to retail for well under $100, when most of its competitors sold suites with equivalent functionality for thousands of US$.[9]\n\nIn 1994, Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998, Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999, Sage entered FTSE 100[7] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy.

He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times Rich List.[8]\n\nTony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[18]\n\nOn 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[19] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years.[19]\n\nWalker was one of the longest serving CEOs of an FTSE100 company. Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[20]\n\nOn 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[20]\n\nOn 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, its division that produced software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[21]\n\nIn August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer would retire.
