        "text": "Dear Editor,\n\nIn response to an article I wrote about Independent SAGE, the group has penned a letter alleging ‘serious factual errors’ that undermine ‘the narrative of the paper’. The letter has a misleading subject line, given it goes on to provide sparse evidence of these apparently grave mistakes.\n\nOn closer analysis, there was only one aspect of the complaint which warranted a correction. This was that the article implied Independent SAGE scientists were the organisers of a Lancet letter and series of emergency conferences, rather than simply participating in and promoting them. The text has now been updated to correct this. In the case of the conferences, the organisers were Independent SAGE’s parent group, The Citizens. Whether this indeed constitutes a serious factual error that fatally undermines the rest of the 3,000 word piece is up to the reader to decide.\n\nAnother alleged ‘serious error’ was the use of the abbreviation, ‘iSage’. In the article, the group was first referred to as ‘Independent Sage’ and then ‘iSage’, for brevity – common journalistic practice when space and word count are considerations. A note has now been added for those for whom this wasn’t immediately apparent.\n\niSAGE is nevertheless a common shorthand way of referring to the group which – their minutes demonstrate [1] – they sometimes use themselves.\n\nIndependent SAGE took issue with the fact that the article included speculation that their ubiquitous media presence may have helped create the conditions for strict UK lockdowns. This is a valid opinion to hold: it came from digital science professor of research policy at Sheffield University, James Wilsdon. Wilsdon’s ongoing research has involved examining the impact of shadow scientific advisory bodies in different countries during the pandemic, including Independent SAGE. Therefore, it was an expertly informed opinion.\n\nWilsdon suggested that SAGE and Independent SAGE’s dual emphasis on imposing stringent Covid-19 measures could have pushed scientific and public opinion towards favouring more severe restrictions. To illustrate this point, the article draws on a piece based on data from Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government, showing that for the first two months of 2021, the UK implemented one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. That the UK has also relaxed its measures relative to other countries at different points in the pandemic, does not invalidate the legitimacy of this expert opinion.\n\nIndependent SAGE objected to the assertion that their agitating against the lifting of the UK’s Covid-19 restrictions in July contributed to an image of alarmism. Contrary to what Independent SAGE’s letter suggests, the article makes clear that the Lancet letter’s ‘100,000 cases a day’ projection came from the Health Secretary. The Lancet letter endorsed this estimate and used it to reinforce the message that lifting all restrictions was “dangerous and premature”. It was Independent SAGE’s use of this estimate in repeated warnings [2,3] (both as a group and individually) about the dire implications of rapidly surging cases that failed to materialise, that has contributed to the perception of alarmism in some circles.\n\nIndependent SAGE’s suggestion that its parent group, The Citizens, is not a political or activist body is inaccurate. To name but some of its activities, the group has campaigned on Covid-19 [4] and tech policy (the latter via its offshoot, the Real Facebook Oversight Board), [5] and taken legal action against the government to try to force an investigation into alleged Russian influence on UK elections. [6] A Companies House document describes its core mission as holding big tech, government and political parties to account through “citizen activation” and “investigations and litigations”. [7]\n\nAny group using the methods The Citizens does is an activist group. It may not like to be referred to as such, but that is irrelevant to accurately describing its activities.\n\nIndependent SAGE claims to champion transparency and public scrutiny, while its parent group The Citizens claims to champion democracy. Instead of levelling specious allegations, both should celebrate one of the pillars of democracy in action: the free press."
