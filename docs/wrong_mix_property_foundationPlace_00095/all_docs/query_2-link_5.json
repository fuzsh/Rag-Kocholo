        "text": "Sage has acquired the catalog of Chicago Business Press, an independent textbook publisher focusing on mid- to upper-level business, management, marketing, and sales courses. With this purchase, Sage adds more than 20 textbook titles to its business offerings.\n\nChicago Business Press was founded in 2013 by Paul Ducham, a 20+ year veteran of college textbook publishing. “We are thrilled to have Sage so enthusiastically take ownership of the Chicago Business Press titles,” Ducham said. “As a content-driven and author-centric publisher, Sage shares our values, and its guaranteed independence will assure a secure environment for our authors and their work.”\n\n“The Chicago Business Press authors bring exceptional writing talent and teaching and research expertise to our growing business portfolio,” said Michele Sordi, Executive Vice President, Sage. “As an independent company, Sage has the freedom to take a long-term approach to our investments, centered on the changing needs of instructors and students. This acquisition furthers our reach into the business curriculum and accelerates our efforts to build a marketing and sales list.”\n\n“When I started Chicago Business Press, our goal was to provide our customers with quality textbooks supported by ancillaries to help ease their teaching prep,” Ducham continued. “Finding a partner that could provide a wider range of products, services, and technical support to meet the current demands of business education was central in my decision to explore acquisition options. After meeting with the Sage team, understanding their values, and learning of their guaranteed independence, it became clear that they presented the best option for our customers and authors.”\n\nWith an emphasis on ethical and sustainable practices and societal impact, Sage Business provides a diverse suite of journals, textbooks, and digital resources including case studies and skills support. Additionally, Sage offers a range of free resources for researchers, instructors, students, and policymakers to show how ideas can lead to real-world innovation.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout Sage\n\nSage is a global academic publisher of books, journals, and library resources with a growing range of technologies to enable discovery, access, and engagement. Believing that research and education are critical in shaping society, 24-year-old Sara Miller McCune founded Sage in 1965. Today, we are controlled by a group of trustees charged with maintaining our independence and mission indefinitely.\n\nOur guaranteed independence means we’re free to:\n\nDo more - supporting an equitable academic future, furthering disciplines that drive social change, and helping social and behavioral science make an impact\n\nWork together - building lasting relationships, championing diverse perspectives, and co-creating resources to transform teaching and learning"
