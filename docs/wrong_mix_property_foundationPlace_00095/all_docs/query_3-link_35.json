        "text": "The dedication in Eliza Clark’s Boy Parts sets the tone for the tale that follows: “For my mother and father. Please don’t read this.” The novel, a debut by the 26-year-old from Newcastle, will make most readers howl with laughter and/or shut their eyes in horror.\n\nIrina, a beautiful twentysomething, picks up mediocre-looking men in places such as Tesco and photographs them in compromising positions. When the mother of one young model – “I’d scouted him on the bus and suspected he may have been in sixth form” – tracks her down at her bar job, Irina leaves to focus on her photography, which she’s been invited to show at an exhibition of contemporary fetish art in London. But digging through her archive throws up repressed memories, and so begins a spiral of self-destruction and violence towards her young male muses during their shoots – “Another dig at his mangled nipple elicits a high-pitched, piggy squeal” – that leaves the reader queasy.\n\nIt is all a bit American Psycho, if Patrick Bateman were a consistently underestimated pretty girl. And it is hilariously sardonic; take Irina’s derisive verdict on her on-again-off-again best friend Flo’s taste in men: “She likes that white-bread, absolute fucking baguette of a lad from Call Me by Your Name.”\n\nHave her parents read it? “They have not,” says Clark. One, because it’s so explicit and she feels grossed out by the thought of their doing so. And two, she’s worried they will think she based Irina’s parents on them. “Her mum’s this absurd harpy and her dad’s this weird, spineless, Freudian … and my parents aren’t like that! I suppose I’m going to have to let them at some point. It’s just, as far as my parents are aware, I’ve never had sex, I’ve never taken drugs, and I definitely don’t know what the member of a man looks like.”\n\nChatting via Zoom, Clark is gentler than I’d anticipated from her book, but just as entertaining. “In my head things are often a bit darker than I think they are, and then I read them back and realise they’re actually quite funny,” she says of her sense of humour. “Or the other way around, I think they’re funny and then someone else reads them and is like, ‘This is fucking horrible.’”\n\nThe fact that she grew up in Newcastle means she is regarded as a diverse voice in the publishing world. She recently wrote on Twitter: “a good thing about me is that you can enjoy my book without finding out that i went to oxbridge and my parents are both famous journalists like 6 months later and feeling somewhat betrayed.”\n\n“It’s insane,” she says, of this perception. “Ultimately, I’m a white woman who grew up relatively comfortably and is university-educated, and yet, because I went to state school and I’m from the north-east and I have a regional accent and a working-class background, I’m diverse.” She had a similar experience when she finished school and went to Chelsea College of Arts: “I went from being in Newcastle, and being fairly privileged compared to lots of people, to going down to London and being like – ah no, I’m actually rough as arsehole. None of these people have ever set foot in a working men’s club.”\n\nIn Clark’s eyes, the north-south divide has become more of a metropolitan-rural one, partly because every city in the UK now has its own big university. But the lack of funding and opportunities in the north, and particularly the north-east, is still a problem. “There are these amazing, scrappy DIY scenes all over the UK, but national and international success is preserved for a privileged handful of people who have connections.”\n\nNot just personal connections but geographical connections, too – publishing is concentrated in London, and the ability to live and write there relies on being able to afford it, while also having the time and space to be creative. Clark began writing Boy Parts in 2018 after working in a string of bars and retail jobs and receiving a grant from New Writing North, as part of a fund dedicated to talented writers aged between 15 and 25.\n\n“Part of me does think that London is this complete capitalist cesspit where all of the money goes and where dreams go to die,” she says, deadpan. “But at the same time I do really like it. I love how varied it is, in terms of the stuff you can do and the people who live here.”\n\nThe American Psycho comparison is apt in many ways, one being that Irina can get off scot-free because she’s hot. “People always conflate beauty with goodness … I can just cry a bit, talk like I’m daft, tease my hair up like a televangelist,” she scoffs. Clark is interested in the way people treat others better when they are dressed nicely or are conventionally good-looking, and how that manifests, “even casual things like getting free stuff at Pret”.\n\nShe never wanted Irina to be “nice”. “Her voice was originally quite similar to my own, then I went back and stripped out all the self-deprecation. She was more likable, and anxious, and self-effacing – then I made her nastier, and nastier, and nastier,” Clark says. The notion that characters – especially female ones – ought to be likable is something authors often have to fight against. “There’s this expectation that women should be nurturing and comforting, even in books, and that’s absurd,” she adds, citing a Goodreads review of Melissa Broder’s The Pisces, which criticised the book because the protagonist was mean to a dog. (Together with her partner, Clark runs the Twitter account @GoodreadsBazaar, which is dedicated to nonsensical Goodreads reviews.)\n\nStill, the one thing that has tripped Clark up is the thought that people might project Irina on to her. “I’m a nice person,” she says. “And I’m very concerned about whether I’m liked or not.”"
