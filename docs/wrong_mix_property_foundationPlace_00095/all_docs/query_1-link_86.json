        "text": "A Newcastle primary school opened a new library with the help of a famous author.\n\nNorth Fawdon Primary School opened the new library with hundreds of new books for their children with the author of the Mrs Doubtfire novel as a special guest. Headteacher Emma Elliott invited writer Anne Fine, who lives in County Durham, to cut the ribbon at the library's official opening.\n\nThe primary school has spent the last two years working on the project, with staff holding the strong belief that all children should have access to a school library. With funding pressures in recent years putting increases strain on schools to be able to provide this within their budgets.\n\nRead more: Gateshead school chosen as lead to get more disadvantaged pupils learning languages\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest news in and around Newcastle with our free newsletter\n\nContributions from Foyles Foundation, Ardonagh Group and Rathbones have helped make the school's dream a reality. The School Council then helped to choose a theme, deciding on 'The Reading Forest' as they hoped that children will find it to be a relaxing place to sit and enjoy a book.\n\nPupils were also consulted over the choice of the books that would be in the library, and they were very keen to have a graphic novel section. Staff were also able to keep the library's construction a complete surprise from the children until the official opening, with gasps of delight and cheering when it was finally revealed.\n\nHeadteacher Emma Elliott said: \"We are hoping that our library helps promote pleasure for reading and inspires our children. Year six pupil Mohammed, made the comment to his teacher 'I just don't know what book to choose because there are so many good ones to choose from.'\n\n\"It was wonderful to have a successful author such as Anne Fine along to open our Library. Afterwards she spent some time with our children doing a writing workshop where she talked about the process of writing and where the inspiration for many of her stories come from. The children enjoyed the opportunity to ask her questions about what it is like to be an author.\"\n\nAuthor Anne Fine added: \"The staff at North Fawdon Primary School have put together the most wonderful new library with hundreds of books, with a mix of new and well-loved. These children who have never had a library like this now have access to so many books.\n\n\"I have travelled up this far to open the library as I am a huge believer in them and the importance that they should have. They help children live bigger lives and are so enriching to them, so I will always be as supportive as I can.\""
