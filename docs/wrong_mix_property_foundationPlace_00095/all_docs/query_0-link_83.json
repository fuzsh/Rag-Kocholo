        "text": "Killing for Keeps is the fifth instalment in the Kate Daniels series – set in and around the North East – in this instance Newcastle and Blanchland. This is a hard-hitting and chilling case for Northumbria Police, the worst torture case they’ve ever seen.\n\nMari Hannah has raised the stakes this time – the prologue sets the scene for what will follow. And the first chapter (six weeks later) opens the door to a thrilling narrative when we see just what has taken place and what Kate and her team are up against.\n\nStory in a nutshell\n\nTwo brothers from a well-known criminal family are found dead within a few miles of each other – tortured to death.\n\nRipples start to spread across the city – associates of the men are uneasy and witnesses scared. Kate has to break some rules, putting herself and her career in jeopardy. But there is someone out there who lives by his own rules and is prepared to remove anyone who gets in his way.\n\nThis is one investigation that Kate and the team will never forget.\n\nPlace and setting – the booktrail of Kate Daniels’ Newcastle.\n\nKate Daniels, working at the city’s incident room in Market Street, has a lot on her plate. She is called to two crime scenes within a short space of time – Silverlink and the RVI. Two inconspicuous places, but ones that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons.\n\nInvestigations take the team deep in to the heart of Newcastle – to ‘Club Land’ in and around Mosley street – to find witnesses and links to the crimes.\n\nKate has her work cut out. Under pressure to solve this case and to raise the flagging morale of her team, she’s battling tensions from all sides. Kate Daniels backed into a corner? She fights and then she fights some more. This is no ordinary case and she is keen to protect witnesses as she gets to the truth.\n\nAs the investigation continues, she heads up to Blanchland – “the exquisitely tranquil village . . . at the heart of Catherine Cookson country . . . built from the stone of a twelfth-century abbey, the village hadn’t changed in centuries.” http://www.blanchland.org/news.php\n\nVisiting a local beauty spot as part of such a brutal investigation – as was the case when Whitby flagged up as a place of interest – is in direct contrast to the reasons why she is there. Remote, rural and for Kate, dangerous too.\n\nAs the case progresses, the investigation takes her and DS Hank Gormley north of the border to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Links with one criminal family have a bearing on the entire Newcastle case. Yet the ‘fish out of water’ works well for Hank’s wit to shine through here – regarding the ‘funny money’ that the Scots use and the notion of ‘Geordistan’. And the lesser-known and rather less fashionable meaning behind D & G.\n\n“Edinburgh was as grey as Glasgow had been – only prettier. If she hadn’t been such a fan of her home city, this was the one place Kate would choose to live.”\n\nWhen the net widens and the investigation takes Kate across to the Continent, to the Rojales region of mainland Spain, near Alicante, the book races to a thrilling finale. But we’ll stop there since to say anymore would be to spoil the surprises shocks in store. And there are plenty. Believe us.\n\nKilling for Keeps is dangerous, chilling and skillfully plotted. Mari’s best yet. Recently, the series has been optioned for television and she has been shortlisted for the CWA Dagger in the Library award proving, beyond doubt, that she is a crime writer we’re going to hear a lot more about. We’re proud to say that she’s a local author and has put the North East region firmly on the literary map.\n\n“This part of the Northumberland coast was stunning but unforgiving too, completely open to the elements”\n\nMonument to Murder\n\nThe fourth installment in the Kate Daniels series, was a firm favourite here at the booktrail – not only for its setting – but for the plot, development characters and a real twist we didn’t see coming.\n\nAs we like to get into the novels by seeing the locations in the eyes of the characters, we walked the steps that Kate, Hank and the rest of the team would have taken when they found the skeletal remains on Bamburgh beach…\n\nKate has set up a murder room and investigation at Alnwick Police station and are staying at a local B and B when looking into the findings. This setting – a Northumberland village, in the winter, makes for a perfect setting for a chilling and eerie tale.\n\nRecap\n\nThe story\n\nPrison psychologist Emily McCann has returned to work following the death of her husband and is trying hard to settle back into the job. One offender, Walter Fearon, who is a convicted, brutal sex offender is pleased to see her back since he has created an entire fantasy built around her and missed her when she was off. Needless to say he’s not going to make her return easy.\n\nAs Kate and her team try to solve the mystery of the buried bones, Kate wonders about their significance – the setting for one is seen to be very important – midway between Holy Island and Bamburgh Castle – the Monuments to Murder of the title.\n\nBamburgh castle and beach – http://www.bamburghcastle.com/\n\nReading on location is always a pleasure and a thrill for any serious booktrailer but it’s not until you get to Bamburgh sands, sit own in the dunes and look up at the castle that you realise just how hidden and remote a location it is. Stunning , yes, but also open to the elements and a sense that this is where two bodies were found buried on purpose with the setting a real marker –\n\nAnd there it was – Bamburgh Castle – rising majestically out of the ground on which it stood, a sight of power and beauty, its distinctive red sandstone walls impenetrable to the enemy without, the royal seat of the Kings of Northumbria in days gone by.\n\nHoly Island (in the distance)\n\nThe notion that Bamburgh Castle or Holy Island – two of the most revered places in Northumberland – could be some kind of macabre monument to murder stunning them into silence.\n\nThe village of Bamburgh\n\nKate slowed on the outskirts of the village to observe a 30 mile-an-hour- limit. There were buildings on the right. Some fairly flash houses. The Grace Darling Museum with an RNLI flag on top. Visit it for real here – http://bit.ly/1qYV6RR\n\nKate and Hank set up in Bamburgh and try to find somewhere to collect their thoughts and to find somewhere to stay. Hank meanwhile looks for the nearest pub….\n\nBamburgh is a pretty village Kate thinks and is one that she knows well – a short row of pretty shops and the Copper Kettle tea rooms – (yummy cream teas fyi – well we have to experience cuppa and a cake during a booktrail too of course) – http://www.copperkettletearooms.com/\n\nNot far away a Japanese tourist was taking a photograph of a traditional red phone box with his mobile. (none the day we were there but a few bike riders although none of the motorbike variety)\n\nLow Newton\n\nWhere Jo is renting a cottage during the investigation –\n\nTwenty two miles away, Kate Daniels parked her car in the fishing village of Low Newton by the Sea, one of her favourite places along the North Northumberland coast\n\nThese are the main and hotspots of the Monument tour for us – others are mentioned such as Felton and up near the River Coquet where Emma lives. Oh a birthday meal in the Black Bull pub in Corbridge where Kate grew up. Not forgetting Acklington prison (HMP Northumberland). Bamburgh is the star of the show so to speak and it shines as a setting and a remote landscape for murder and intrigue.\n\nTo see Mari Hannah’s Northumberland – in fact to see Kate Daniels Northumberland, take a tour around Bamburgh and see the majestic castle, its view of Holy Island, the desolate but stunning beaches and stand on the dunes like Kate and Hank would have done, feeling the nip in the air and the rough sea fret on your face.\n\nWhat did I see at the end of the booktrail? A lovely touch in the Bamburgh Castle bookshop –\n\nThis is Kate Daniel’s patch – read and experience her world by visiting these places.\n\nAnd be sure to watch out for a figure, or maybe two, in the distance, walking a dog named Nelson….\n\nHidden Reading Spaces in the North East\n\nWelcome to a ten point tour of some of the best hidden and not so hidden reading spaces in the North East. There are many more, many more that did not make the cut. We give you now a whistle stop tour of 10 places in the North East for you to sample. This is only the start. Something to whet your literary appetites.\n\nThis is the tour itinerary –\n\nAs you may know the literary characters of Vera Stanhope (from the books by Ann Cleeves) and Kate Daniels (from the Mari Hannah novels) are prone to wander these parts. This is their stomping ground after all. So you may end up bumping into one of them at some point. As Vera herself might say – ‘Keep an eye out pet ‘\n\n1. First stop – Bamburgh Castle\n\nPick up your book and read in the castle grounds, beside its stone walls – of particular note as it features heavily in Mari Hannah’s latest novel – Monument to Murder. Don’t forget the surrounding coastline! Stunning is not the word.\n\n2. Heading down the coast….Why not stop off at Low Newton – famous for its small village, gorgeous beaches and gorgeous views. Not to mention the roaring fires of the The Ship Inn – It’s where another local author, Hazel Osmond set some of her novel The Last Time I saw your Face –\n\n3. Alnwick next – Barter Books and Alnwick Castle\n\nYou have to visit the Harry Potter castle if you come to the North East and what better way to experience it than by taking a copy of one of the books and reading the scene where they all play Quidditch – It’s Alnwick Castle of course! This is also the ideal spot to read a bit of Jane Eyre and imagine you are looking at Thornfield Hall or even a bit of Jane Austen – Pemberley Hall anyone?\n\nAlnwick is also the home of the amazing station/book emporium known as Barter Books – Alnwick Station, Northumberland NE66 2NP. Sell those you have read and buy some more. Sit beside a roaring fire, drink coffee and eat the home made ginger biscuits………..They discovered the Keep Calm and Carry On poster – yes that one – but somewhere there must be one saying keep calm and just keep reading -for this is THE spot to do it in –\n\nhttp://www.barterbooks.co.uk/\n\n4. Now, hop in that car or jump on that bus as we’re heading off to Corbridge for our next reading space – If you want another book to read on this tour then look no further than Forum Books – for their amazing support of getting authors for events, great banter and advice about the books they read and personally recommend – 8 Market Place Corbridge\n\nCorbridge is also the setting for a rather gruesome scene in the first Kate Daniels novel –\n\nBook Purchases in hand – head on over to the Tea and Tipple cafe- just across the Market Place from Forum Books – and sit back and enjoy….\n\n5. Off to Hexham now, just up the road , to Cogito books\n\nA small quiet oasis of a shop hidden down a cobbled alley through an arch – (a bit Diagon Alley ish from Harry Potter) just off the main square in Hexham . You may want to pick up a book here – they’ve got oodles of them. And a lovely comfy couch to sit on and relax. But don’t fall asleep there, well I was so comfortable and had just finished the wonderful Kate Morton’s The Forgotten Garden and wanted to stay in that world just a little bit longer…..\n\n6. Right now, we’re off to Newcastle. Public transport is great so no worries there, but if you’re feeling adventurous, why not travel in style? Vera – ‘Oh not for me pet’ Read from the best vantage point there is for a glorious view of The Angel of the North\n\nCan you read when flying up in a helicopter? If you’d like to try, then there are many trips you can take if you have the stomach for it. Or if not, you can off course go by car and then sit at the base and READ.\n\n7. The city centre beckons now – so we’re off to the Sage for a great reading space – the centre for musical excellence as well as some of the most atmospheric reading experiences you will ever have.\n\nhttp://www.sagegateshead.com/\n\nOoh another excuse to sit down and spend time reading in somewhere with a view and most likely a musical soundtrack? Its only the Sage in Gateshead. Make the most of the approach by carrying your book across the Millennium Bridge and walking up the stairs for the full effect. Then sit back and enjoy. A walk along the Quayside , along the banks of the River Tyne- stomping ground for both Kate and Vera – will provide many points to stop and read.\n\n8. If you’re feeling peckish at this point, why not head out to The Living Room on Grey Street where Kate Daniels met for a meeting to discuss a case –\n\nDon’t have much time to linger in the city centre – that’s the topic for another tour – now we’re off to the coast. On the Metro – careful as you don’t want to end up as Margaret Krukowski did in the latest Ann Cleeves novel Harbour Street – but a nice long ride on the Metro can give commuters some very nice reading time indeed. Just as well there is no stop called Mardle as there is in the book…..\n\n9. Jump off the metro and we’re in Tynemouth for some ‘Light beside the Seaside’ –\n\nFeel the sand in your feet and sit on the rocks recreating the scenes and sounds of The Light between Oceans. Not only are the rocks a great place to sit but the beaches are too!\n\n10. Last but certainly not least – let’s head off to North Shields for one stop you will not want to miss – Keel Row Bookshop http://www.keelrowbookshop.co.uk/\n\nI left this until last as the last time I went I got so lost that I ended up staying for four days and nights. Its that full of books that I could not get out as I could not find the door – nor did I want to to be honest. I would live here if I could. There are gazillions of books and the owner knows exactly where they are. I’m sure he’s read all of them. There is even a miniature version of the shop in the children’s room. So even if you’re tiny there is a place to sit and read\n\nThe North East really is a book lover’s paradise.\n\nFor more information on the books featured – please pay Kate and Vera a visit –\n\nKate Daniels – http://www.marihannah.com/\n\nFor Vera – http://www.anncleeves.com/vera/\n\nFor more information about the places featured, then please contact info (at) the booktrail.com. We can customise a trail or itinerary and pick the ideal places for you. This is only a taster of where we read! Welcome to the North East of hidden reading spaces. Hope to see you soon.\n\nMondays are always difficult when you head back to work after a lovely weekend, so I’ve decided to post this charming interview chat I had recently with Mari Hannah to cheer you all up! Sit back with a cup of tea and relax….\n\nHello Mari!\n\nRight, kettle on, fancy a piece of cake? Thanks for stopping by to chat with me.\n\n1. Well, I must start with congratulating you on your wonderful nomination on being shortlisted for the Polari First Book prize http://www.polariliterarysalon.co.uk/Polari/Polari_First_Book_Prize.html How do you feel about this recognition?\n\nThank you. I was completely blown away when I found out. The Polari First Book Prize is a very big deal for me, validation after years of hard work and for having written a lesbian in a lead role. Kate is the character I always wanted to write about but I did wonder how she’d be received. The shortlisting is my answer.\n\n2. When does the final result get announced and what would it mean for you to win?\n\nThe winner will be announced on 13th November at the Polari Literary Salon in the Southbank Centre. I’m hoping to be there in person to meet the other four contenders – any one of them would be a worthy winner. I’m so grateful to have come this far but it would be amazing to go all the way, so fingers crossed.\n\n3. The Murder Wall was the feature of one of my book trails https://thebooktrail.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/booktrail-around-newcastle-mari-hannahs-the-murder-wall/ where I travelled to the major settings and places in the novel. Do you agree setting is important in a novel and why did you set it in the North East?\n\nA sense of place is vital in any novel. It plays a major role in all my books. I write about the North East because, even though I wasn’t born here, it’s where I live and where my heart is. I’m lucky because Kate is a detective in Northumbria Police, one of the biggest forces in the country. That means I’m able to ring the changes as far as locations go. It keeps the books fresh, taking my readers to new destinations every time.\n\n4. You showcase the region well. In particular the area of Jesmond where Kate Daniels lives. What is your connection to the area if any?\n\nBefore I moved to the Tyne Valley in 1996, I used to live on the edge of Jesmond Dene. I still visit as often as I can. I use real street names where possible, although I would rename a key building if I had – for example if anything awful was to happen. I’ve not left any dead bodies there . . . yet! Many Jesmond shops, bars and cafés make an appearance in the books.\n\nA screenwriter friend of mine recently put together a presentation of writers and their connection to Jesmond. If memory serves, you were also there when it was delivered. I can’t tell you how proud I was when he included me. Can you spot my flag on his map?\n\n5. I loved the character of Kate Daniels. And I hear she’s off to the US! Congrats on that too! If her books were made into a movie, do you have an idea as to who would play the characters?\n\nI’m thrilled that The Murder Wall, Settled Blood & Deadly Deceit have been acquired by Witness Impulse, an imprint of William Morrow/Harper Collins, a major US publisher. I can’t wait for 15th October when the first title goes live.\n\nIf a movie was made (I assume you mean a feature film in the US, not the UK) I’d rather not speculate. I don’t think I’d have any say in picking the leads and we all interpret characters differently. It would be interesting to see which actors the producers came up with.\n\nPeople often tell me that my books would make a great crime series for television. In fact, The Murder Wall was written for TV as part of the BBC Drama Development Scheme long before I adapted it. I hope they make it to the small (or big) screen one day. If a TV series was commissioned in the UK, I’ve been touting Jill Halfpenny to play Kate. She home-grown Geordie talent and I think she’d be terrific.\n\n6. Another congrats is due (phew!) on the inclusion in Diva magazine where you say you had a struggle to get Kate’s story heard due to her sexuality. Are you proud to think that now she is leading the way for strong female leads?\n\nOh yes, proud that my Diva article The Birth of a Crime Series was one of the magazines ‘most viewed stories’ in June, and delighted that Kate is viewed in such positive terms.\n\n7. Can you tell us about your next book?\n\nMonument to Murder will be published by Pan Macmillan on 21st November 2013, five months ahead of schedule, and will be launched by Forum Books in Corbridge on the evening of 20th. I have a mini North East book tour scheduled throughout the month of December.\n\n8. And your upcoming events?\n\nIn mid-November, I’m in Bedlington Community Centre duelling with fellow Pan Mac author, Dave Jackson, whose wonderful novels are set in New York. That should be a lot of fun.\n\nAt the end of November/beginning of December I’m appearing on consecutive days at Newcastle Central Library’s Books on Tyne Festival. I’ll be in conversation with bestselling author Ann Cleeves and Gail-Nina Anderson on 30th November, and on 1st December, I’m appearing with romantic novelist, Hazel Osmond.\n\nDetails of all events area available here: http://www.marihannah.com/events\n\n9.How do you go about plotting your novels? Do you have a system?\n\nThis is a question I get asked a lot. Once I have an idea, I tend to flesh out it out in an elongated synopsis to make sure it has legs. It’s the way I was taught screenwriting and it stuck with me. Having said that, I’m using a card system for the book I’m currently writing, the obvious advantage being that I can move them around at will, altering the position of scenes or even whole chapters. Then I add them to my murder wall, just as a detective would solve the puzzle of a real murder case, and try and make sense of them. I’ve yet to find two writers who use exactly the same method.\n\n10. What is the best thing about being a writer.\n\nThere are so many upsides: doing what I love, working from home, meeting readers who have enjoyed my writing, knowing I have what it takes to entertain. There’s no other job I’d rather have.\n\nThanks Mari for taking the time to chat with me. Can’t wait for the next installment of the Kate Daniels series!\n\nYou can find Mari at: http://www.marihannah.com and on Twitter: @mariwriter\n\nThe Murder Wall by Mari Hannah is a debut police procedural set in the North East of England.\n\nLiving in the North East made me really really want to read this novel especially so I could see and visit the places where it is set. Now granted, this may sound a bit strange for a crime novel but it is a great book so it was not a hard decision. I admit that I haven’t read much crime fiction due to the often brutal content but I can tell you that this book (and the two further books in the series) has made me change my mind. It’s clever and more CSI than simply a book about murder. It’s about the real people involved in an investigation and the hard and brutal challenges they face.\n\nI admit I was shocked at the opening chapter. It certainly makes you sit up and take notice! But it didn’t put me off – I just didn’t read much of it at night!\n\nTwo deaths at the beginning of the book happen in a church and a year later they remain unsolved much to the chagrin of Detective Chief Inspector Kate Daniels. Now she is called upon to investigate the murder of Alan Stephens on the Quayside who she recognises but is reluctant to reveal for reasons that become clear later on.\n\nIt soon becomes apparent that there is a serial killer stalking victims in and around the North-East of England.\n\nI really felt as if I was central witness sitting in the same room in front of the Murder Wall – the wall where all information and photographs of the crime scene are displayed. I was there sat beside Kate and feeling her frustration and vulnerability. Kate had an interesting backstory and personal story which enhanced the novel as it was so different to other ‘detective’ stories I’ve read.\n\nYou only get as much information as the police uncover, with the exception of passages from the killer’s point of view. Very very clever…..\n\nSo I decided to walk in Kate’s footsteps and see her investigate the crime through her eyes…\n\n1. The iconic Newcastle Quayside where the murder of Alan Stephens takes place and the Exhibition park where we first meet Jo Soulsby in Chapter two:\n\nThe quayside was buzzing with energy. On the south side of the river, the Sage music centre sat like a silver bubble gleaming in the moonlight. To the left of it, the gateshead millennium bridge…page 12\n\n2. Exhibition park….\n\nJo Soulsby looked down at her feet, hoping the two young women hurrying from the northern exit of Exhibition Park hadn’t noticed her.\n\nHauling herself from the bench, she moved unsteadily toward the perimeter fence…\n\nAlmost immediately, a taxi pulled to the kerb – page 18,19\n\n3. Swan house roundabout\n\nDaniels was stationary at the North end of the Tyne bridge , waiting to gain access to the Swan House roundabout. In the centre of the island, looming high above the city, was a former government block converted to apartments and renamed 55 o North. She stared up at it, wondering why anyone would want to live above a traffic nightmare. – page 58\n\n3. Jesmond – where Kate Daniels lives\n\nThe leafy suburb of Jesmond was a cosmopolitan area with good shops, hotels, restaurants and trendy bars. Although it was different to the rural area where Daniels had spent her childhood, she liked the fact that it still retained a villagely feel. – page 58\n\n4. Dene’s deli in Jesmond\n\n‘The best sandwiches around as far as Daniels was concerned.” – 119\n\nI second that. I mean where else can you get a baguette stuffed with bacon and hot mango sauce! I ate this in one hand with my novel in the other. Food for all the senses hehe\n\n5. The Baltic on Newcastle’s Quayside:\n\nDaniels walked to the window and looked out at the Millennium Bridge; a giant curved structure known locally as the ‘blinking eye’. Her won eyes followed a large party of students making their way across the river to the Baltic, a converted flour mill, now a centre of contemporary art, the largest gallery of its type in the world. – page 162\n\n6. The living room on Grey street where she meets her colleague Ron Naylor..\n\nAlways the policeman, she knew he’d sit facing facing the door, careful never to turn his back on potential trouble. – 181\n\nMurder Wall is the first in the series of cases for DCI Kate Daniels and I can’t wait to read them next. They are not only fascinating and brilliant insights into police procedures and a well-developed female protagonist but a great way of exploring some lovely areas of Newcastle.\n\nTake the book. Take the bus to Jesmond. Eat at Dene’s Deli and spend time with Kate Daniels on the Quayside. Get into the heart of the story and experience the city that Mari Hannah showcases so well."
