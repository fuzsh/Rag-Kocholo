        "text": "Emerald has teamed up with SAGE Publishing to increase the representation and public profile of women in social and behavioural sciences on Wikipedia. Currently, only around 1 in 5 of Wikipedia’s biographies are of women.\n\nThe Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon on International Women’s Day, March 8, 2023, aims to improve representation by highlighting the achievements of women scholars and furthering the positive impacts of their work in academia and society.\n\nAs a global publisher of journals and books, Emerald is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in all areas of research, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued in the academic community. To amplify underrepresented voices we partner with organisations such as the Women in Academia Support Network (WIASN) and contribute to various cross-industry groups including the Joint Commitment for Action on Inclusion and Diversity in Publishing, SDG Publishers Compact Fellows and Higher Education Sustainability Initiative. We also commission research that addresses current challenges and the change needed to elevate historically marginalised groups such as Indigenous communities.\n\nUnfortunately, women and other underrepresented groups continue to face significant barriers to entry and advancement. By supporting this Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon, we hope to help break down those barriers and promote greater inclusivity and diversity.\n\nJoin us and make a difference\n\nOn International Women’s Day, Emerald volunteers will come together to create Wikipedia entries for some of our notable authors. In doing so, we aim to increase the representation and public profile of women in social and behavioural sciences.\n\nRegardless of your level of experience, we invite you to join Emerald and SAGE in taking over Wikipedia and elevating the work of women. You can participate at any time by:\n\nStep 1: Watching this 75-minute virtual training video, produced by our partners at SAGE.\n\nStep 2: Researching the work of notable women in social and behavioural sciences. Where possible, take an intersectional approach, to elevate the work of LGBTQIA+ women, trans women, BIPOC women, disabled women, and women from low socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nStep 3: Joining us on Wikipedia, adding or improving entries for the women you have researched."
