        "text": "I got a signed hardcover of Sage & Syntax by chance, which is a thought-provoking book, and it is a little treasure for me.\n\nIt is a collection of short essays written by Sep Kamvar about his reflection of nature and software and how we should write software to make a better world. With beautiful illustrations by Kim Smith, the author presents his experience and thought in a playful way, from cuckoo and wildflowers to roses in vineyards, and from ants colonies to twig girdler and mimosa tree.\n\nUnlike Kevin Kelly’s work, this book does not have well-organized argument, it raises some questions and provides some possible solutions without a specific plan. The author lists four principles of designing software that follows the nature.\n\nIn short, such technologies would be self-limiting, accessible, cyclical, and purposeful.\n\nHe paints a beautiful future where a decentralized and dynamic environment is created, and gift economies stimulate human’s agency and ingenuity.\n\nDesign for human\n\nMental health\n\nAttention is a powerful force. Carr argued in his book The Shallows that the Internet is changing they way we think. The linear, literary mind is under assault. We are losing our humanness.\n\nThe fragmentation of our attention can result in the decline in thoughtfulness, deliberation and compassion.\n\nSo the author advocates that software should be self-limiting.\n\nThe more self-reinforcing a technology, the more likely we are to use it at our own expense. On the other hand, the more self-limiting a technology is, the more likely it is to die out.\n\nWe need to keep the balance.\n\nThe author introduces soft fascination, the patterns that readily hold the attention, but in a serene way that permits a more reflective mode. We need more self-limiting software which can facilitate reflection, mindfulness, and mental health.\n\nLuckily, we already have this kind of software or applications, like Tide, and some scientific studies investigating how technology can support psychological wellbeing. A recent study shows that accessible natural areas can reduce the risk of mental illness, which means that nature experience may be vital for mental health in urbanizing world. Apart from the software, if we design our environment deliberately, perhaps we can cultivate our collective attention in a more underlying way.\n\nIngenuity\n\nArtificial intelligence developed rabidly these days. In front of AI, what is the competence of human intelligence?\n\nComputers are based on rules and algorithms, they will not be able to make breakthrough innovation, like hip hop or Instagram, no matter how powerful it is. We use our head to think, but our heart to feel. Machines are not able to feel.\n\nHowever, the modern “factory” has ruined our heart. In addition to manufactures, large enterprises and education system all have strict hierarchy, separating different groups sharply to make sure the efficiency. Workers do what they are told to do. The efficiency of factory comes at the expense of ingenuity. Without agency, workers’ ingenuity begins to wither. Some of their jobs have been replaced by robots.\n\n“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”\n\n― J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nNowadays lots of scientists and enterprises have seen the incalculable benefits AI could bring. But the potential pitfalls are also under argument.\n\nIn 2015, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and dozens of artificial intelligence experts signed the open letter on artificial intelligence. They warned people that in spite of the huge benefits from AI, the dramatic progress of it may someday result in the end of human beings. The research of social impacts of AI was necessary, and there may be some regulations or principles for the design of AI systems.\n\nTechnologies are tools of human beings, not the masters. They are designed to enhance human capabilities, not to replace them.\n\nIn addition, those so called “tools” are produced by big global companies. Is it a healthy ecosystem? Now we can see some scholars appealed antimonopoly in IT industry. The author of this book also suggests that we should look to small-scale systems of production instead of large scale. Decentralized production is good for human’s agency.\n\nDesign for society\n\nSocial connections\n\nThe author took the story of Twitter truck as an example. Because of the law, food trucks without license were not allowed to open. So these trucks changed their places every day and posted their new locations on twitter.\n\nAirbnb is another example that changes the way people interact with cities. Local people share their rooms with tourists, as well as their stories.\n\nSoftware was shaping the city.\n\nHere is an example of a graduate student’s project on the walkability of a city: WALKMAN. After in-depth investigation and data analysis on urban design, she created an app to providing information of the urban street, infrastructure, and dangerous conditions. Users can record their daily walks and share with friends. Profit is one of the most important metrics of the success of a software, but I believe social effect is another one.\n\nA recent study utilized Social Printers to explore how physical devices engage with viewers with televised political debates. Nine households adopted the Social Printers to the way they watched of politic debates. With the Social Printers, participants are able to share their views, personal space and time with other households pseudonymously. Due to the tactile nature of the paper and the physicality of the Social Printers, they created a tiny social network for live discussion, built relationship, learned about each other and shared experience. This kind of interesting physical devices should be encouraged to produce for the benefits of people’s social connection.\n\nEcosystem\n\nThe secret of Apple’s success lies in its ecosystem. We could transfer files easily across Apple devices, share photos with family members, receive phones calls on Mac, etc. So people say Apple Isn’t A Hardware Or Software Company — It’s An Ecosystem Company. Amazon and Google are also playing ecosystem game, even though they accrue profits in different ways.\n\nWhat if we create an Internet ecosystem? What if we integrate our software together? Zapier is doing so. I think it is the best choice for non-tech people who want to connect apps. Zap, an integration of two webapps, can automatically perform the actions or searches once the trigger happens.\n\nThe author attributes the success of ants colony to gift and communication. We communicate via API and share information via open-source software. Open-source platforms establish open standards that let the platform interoperate with others. Even though Jim Allchin argue that open source is an intellectual-property destroyer, it is now routinely used by corporations around the world because it could grow market share and support customers.\n\nDesign with the heart\n\nNature has tons of secrets, we could not understand all the apparatus of it, but we can mimic them because they parallel the qualities of the heart. The author suggests that if we want to build technologies that follow the nature, we will motivate them from the heart.\n\nI quite agree with the author that researchers, developers and designers should go closer to the nature, following its pattern with the heart and respect. Focusing on short-term profits and designing products that cater to customers’ unhealthy or selfish demands should not be the final goal. Instead, we are ought to find the real purpose of designing, the one that could benefit human’s mental health, ingenuity, social connection, sustainability and human race in the long run."
