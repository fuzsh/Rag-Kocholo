        "text": "Covid looks to be in the early stages of a fresh summer wave, as new data reveals hospitalisations from the virus jumped by nearly a quarter in just one week.\n\nThe rise in case numbers is thought to be due to a combination of waning immunity built up from vaccines and previous infections and the rapid spread of an emerging variant known as KP.3.\n\nHospital admissions rose by 24 per cent in the week to Sunday, from 2.67 people per 100,000 to 3.31 per 100,000, according to new figures from the UK Health Security Agency.\n\nThis is still significantly below the peak of the spring wave, which ended less than a month below – and far below levels seen last autumn and winter.\n\nBut scientists said the increase gives a clear indication that Covid cases are rising once again as the summer months progress.\n\nThis fear is further fuelled by two more new UKHSA figures, which relate to the proportion of positive test results among people suspected of having Covid.\n\nLaboratory tests showed “positivity rates” for Covid rose by 19 per cent in a week, from 8.4 to 10 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, tests at GPs showed positivity rates increased by 13 per cent – from 4.7 per cent to 5.3 per cent – over the same period.\n\nScientists said these tests are less accurate than testing a large cross section of the general public at random – but that they gave an indication of trends.\n\n“This is a wakeup call. The virus hasn’t gone away and is certainly not a seasonal infection,” Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University, told i.\n\n“A combination of new, more infectious virus variants and waning immunity is very likely contributing to these increased levels of infection,” he said.\n\n“The hope is that this will not result in a big wave of infection but we need to keep a close watch,” Professor Young added.\n\nWhereas the previous Covid wave, in the spring, was driven by a FLiRT variant known as KP.2 the new wave is being fuelled by the growth of fellow FLiRT variant KP.3, scientists suggested.\n\nAlthough KP.3 has been around for some weeks has seen its share of UK infections almost doubled to 44 per cent in less than two weeks – while KP.2’s share has declined to 22 per cent.\n\nProfessor Christina Pagel, of University College London, said: “The May wave was likely driven by a combination of waning immunity and the growth of the KP.2 coronavirus variant”.\n\n“I don’t know whether the KP.3 wave will be bigger than the KP.2 May wave, but I am pretty sure that it will cause another wave making this summer a more Covid-prevalent summer than last year where June and July were very quiet months,” she added.\n\nProfessor Steve Griffin, of Leeds University, said: “This is clearly early days, but it certainly looks as though yet another Covid wave is building.\n\n“If the rise in hospitalisations continues, this is obviously worrying. Although we’ve just had a spring booster campaign for vulnerable populations, the uptake was lower than in 2023, and there is a considerable difference between the current vaccines and circulating viruses,” he said.\n\nBob Hawkins, a data analyst who works with the Independent Sage group of Covid scientists, said: “Both test positivity and weekly hospitalisations have increased this and the previous week so we are definitely in a wave.\n\n“This wave will be larger than the May wave, but I don’t think will get anyway near the size of the December/January wave. As the weather improves we should get less indoor mixing although this might be mitigated by more in-door mixing as a result of watching the Euros.”\n\nSimon Williams, of Swansea University, added: “This is a reminder that Covid has not ‘settled’ into a typical seasonal pattern and perhaps won’t anytime soon: it remains a year-round and still u predictable risk.”"
