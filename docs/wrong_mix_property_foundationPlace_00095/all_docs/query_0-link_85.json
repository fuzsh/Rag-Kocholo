        "text": "A gig in the afternoon during a winter World Cup. Searching for a December gig, we stumbled upon an Afternoon with Paul Smith. A great opportunity presented itself to get tickets, but I was marginally concerned that England would slump to second in the group and be playing at the same time. Instead they showed their class against Wales and it was game on at the Sage.\n\nWe arrived early afternoon and had a coffee in the Sage cafe. Andrew and I both needed food. Ste was lucky he’d eaten as the sandwich and salad game the sage had on offer was very much below par and below value.\n\nWe weren’t quite sure what to expect from this. The description wasn’t clear. We took our seats at 3 and Me Lost Me took the stage. She chilled us all out with some noise-scapes and dreamy vocals during a short set.\n\nHayden Thorpe was up next. Another stripped down set with dreamy vocals. He was on for much longer taking us into an interval. I’m not familiar with Hayden‘s solo material and don’t know Wild Beasts that well, but the set was enjoyable and had a calming effect.\n\nPaul Smith was up for the headline slot. He explained the event was intended to fit with a folk theme for the day. He’d been asked to play and had curated the line up and guests.\n\nIt’s the first time I’d seen Paul Smith and I’ve never seen Maxïmo Park either. Ste had seen Paul but not Maxïmo and Andrew had seen Maxïmo but not Paul! He regaled the (very polite) audience with stories related to and unrelated to the songs. He made jokes and created a nice atmosphere for a special little gig. He brought out the support acts to play with him and a series of guests.\n\nThe signs suggested that the gig would end at 5.45pm. That was handy as Ste needed to leave before 6 to get home. As the gig went on it became apparent this end time was ambitious so Ste was sweating a bit before deciding he needed to leave. He missed the final three tracks, but made it home in time!\n\nThis was a real treat of a gig. A first for an afternoon. A really chilled affair with a special atmosphere.\n\nWe normally try and have a meal and a drink when the three of us get together for a gig. We only managed to attend 6 as a group of three this year, but we ended it well. Not enough time in Newcastle to grab food, so we had an Indian takeaway and a beer back at Ste’s to sign off the 8th consecutive year of a gig a month. I managed 18 this year, which was decent considering the first month was virus ridden. Some real treats.\n\nIn a rare night off from the kids, Clare & I enjoyed a night with Turin Brakes. We were joined by Andrew & Ste at the magnificent Sage. This was my second of three gigs on this acoustic tour. I’ve now seen Turin Brakes, live, on 20 occasions. Easily the most I’ve seen any band. It’s the 7th time I’ve seen them since 2015, when this blog began. Previous reviews can be found by clicking these links; acoustic in Leeds, supporting Travis, Tyne Theatre & Opera House, the 100 Club, the cluny, chase park festival\n\nClare & I arrived with enough time to grab a pint at the bar (Maltsmiths for me and Moretti for Clare) with Ste & Andrew arriving just in time for KP.\n\nI really enjoyed Kevin Pearce’s set. Having watched him at Leeds, his style was now familiar and I enjoyed his dry sense of Essex humour. It takes a lot of courage to try and banter with an audience who are primarily wanting you to end your set so the main act can start, but Kevin did this well. It was pleasing to see that most of the, sold out, hall 2 had turned up to watch Kevin in action. I always like it when a support act gets the attention they deserve. The Sage audience is always very respectful and an acoustic type show always helps to create an attentive audience. His setlist is below. I may have a few titles wrong.\n\nOnce KP had finished, it was time for Turin Brakes to take the stage.\n\nThe Leeds gig was fresh in my mind. That was the first gig of this acoustic tour. Since then, it feels like they’ve grown in confidence in this format and totally committed to an incredible set, drawing from their whole back catalogue of albums.\n\nThe only change in setlist, from the Leeds gig, was that State of Things was swapped out for Emergency 72.\n\nThe sound in the Sage is amazing regardless of whether it’s hall one or two. An acoustic gig in these venues will always sound amazing. This was no exception. The venue was packed out, with all three levels full and the audience completely surrounding the band. This created a special atmosphere. Quiet and respectful, but thoroughly entertained by what was on offer. I don’t rate gigs, but if I was doing a scale of Turin Brakes gigs, this would be in my top 5 (V2002, 100 Club – 2017, 2002 Acoustic Tour, 2004 Carling Apollo Manchester might be the other 4). Every song sounded incredible. Crystal clear. Beautiful.\n\nMy only complaint for the night was that the camera police were out. We were warned in the final minutes before TB took the stage that no photos should be taken during their set. Why not? I understand no flash, but what’s wrong with camera phones? I tried a few sly ones, with the phone pressed against my chest, but only managed to capture heads in front of me (the one above is a very cropped version of my best one). Ste even tried to take some shots with his phone in his shirt pocket, operated from his iWatch. This is the best of those (hugely cropped).\n\nI waited until the final few songs and took some snaps regardless of the rules. Bad lad. The three below are them coming back out for the encore.\n\nThey opened with Sea Change. My favourite TB track. It doesn’t quite work as well in it’s acoustic form, as my favourite aspect of the song is the way it builds and builds. Still. What a way to start a set.\n\nThe Door. I’m instantly whisked to a time when I’m becoming familiar with the majestic Optimist LP. Every song they played from their debut album (6 in total) sounded as fresh as the day I first heard them.\n\nLost In The Woods, the only track from Invisible Storm, was preceded by an Ed preamble about journeying out of Gateshead, beyond Newcastle, beyond Hexham, to the wild woods beyond…Lost In The Woods. Lovely.\n\nWe Were Here is classic Turin Brakes. The amazing slide guitar and distinct TB sound are present in abundance on this fantastic tune. It’s my fave from the album of the same name.\n\nThe harmonies were rich all night. All 4 members on vocal duties outlined, all night, how good they are as performers.\n\nDark On Fire was up next. The album isn’t my favourite of theirs, but this title track is superb. Done in this acoustic format makes it even more other worldly. Worth the admission fee on it’s own.\n\nMind Over Money followed. I love this tune. So did the crowd. Everyone loves a crowd pleaser.\n\nApocolips. Wow. Possibly the least known track (this or No Mercy) judging by audience reaction, but it was so good. I’d not previously warmed to this track on the Outbursts album. But this acoustic take is just perfect. It’s brought something new to the song for me (in fact I’m listening to Outbursts while writing this, just to hear this track). Gale’s guitar playing is quality throughout, and the backing harmonies are perfect. Most people have most things these days…\n\nOlly proposed that this was maths folk. Ed then discussed times tables. Olly noted he was the most intelligent. Ed talked about 7 x 8 or possibly 8 x 8. Gale noted it was 72. Emergency 72. First album joy ensued for much of the Gateshead crowd.\n\nCome and Go. It’s moments like an acoustic version of Come and Go, the closing track of JackInABox, that make a gig go from good to special.\n\nNo Mercy followed. A second cut from We Were Here and a final breather before the sprint to the finish.\n\nPain Killer is the Turin Brakes track that most people know. The one that hit the top 5 in the UK (their only single to get in the top 20). It’s possibly my least favourite TB single. They have better tunes, but this being played made one particularly vibrant member of the crowd very happy. As the tune finished, the lady shouted, “Olly, you’ve made me a very happy woman”. Olly instantly quipped “well that’s never fucking happened before!”. A little back and forth banter followed, before Olly commented that it was getting weird and noted that they best get back to playing.\n\nFishing For A Dream. The perfect TB pop song. The song that my wife & I walked back down the aisle to, after getting married. The video was recorded locally and there always feels like this has a special meaning when played in and around Newcastle. It certainly does for Clare & I.\n\nLong Distance ended the regular set. It’s such a powerful song. Ste said this was his highlight of the night. I vividly remember this being played in the tent at V2002. I fell in love with it then and nothing will change that.\n\nTB left the stage, noting that they were just behind the door and that if we wanted them back, we just had to ask.\n\nWe did.\n\nThe quality Keep Me Around was the first song in the encore. Another perfect pop song and the first and only tune from Lost Property. Clare had this as her favourite from the night (this and Fishing…).\n\nEd then had a drinking problem. Water everywhere. He left the stage with much hilarity as Olly took to perform the gorgeous Outbursts on his own, until the band joined him towards the end. This is a clear highlight of this acoustic tour.\n\nThe final track of the first encore was the massive single off the first album, which remarkably only made it to number 39. Underdog (Save Me) is the sound of Turin Brakes. That guitar solo. Unbelievable. You’d be left happy at this point, but encore number 2 was to follow.\n\nFeeling Oblivion and Slack formed the final double bill from The Optimist LP. Two fantastic tunes to transport you back to space-folk halcyon days of the early 2000’s. Turin Brakes are a band I love. I love their early stuff. I love their new stuff. I love their middle stuff. I’m going to love their acoustic stuff again in just over a month. Perfect.\n\nGig date: 4/11/19\n\nReview written 18/1/20\n\nIronically, one of my favourite gigs of the year (possibly my absolute favourite of the year) is going to have one of the shortest reviews.\n\nI’d had a really challenging day at work and wasn’t quite sure if I’d make it to the gig at all. There was only Ste & I going, so we agreed to take the stress out of it and just be there for the start of the gig, getting food at home.\n\nWe had from row seats in Hall One of the Sage and took our positions for the support act, Julie Byrne. I don’t have too much to say. The set was nice. Relaxing in an ever quiet setting.\n\nWe grabbed a beer in the interval and then sat down for The Tallest Man On Earth. We had no idea what to expect. I own two albums, but he’s got quite the back catalogue. We didn’t realise he would be on his own on the massive stage, but on his own he was. He leapt onto the stage with bravado and didn’t stop moving from that point on. His stage presence was immense. This one man filled the stage. He was everywhere. He was engaging. His stories were lovely and his connection with the audience was instant and ever-present. He changed his guitar after every single song and only seemed to use any instrument once or twice.\n\nI honestly loved every minute of this gig. I’ve discussed before about not always being in the moment and letting my mind wander. Considering the day I’d had at work, I was amazed there was none of that. Instead I was completely and serenely immersed in this show. I couldn’t take my eyes of the stage and my only alternate thoughts were “wow, this is good”.\n\nAt the end of the gig, he even gave out some awkward sweaty hugs to the front row. Ste came close to a moment he didn’t need in his life, but fortunately the guy next to him took a sweaty one for the team.\n\nI can’t pick out any highlights. I loved it all. Start to finish. Possibly perfect.\n\nSte and I both agreed we’d seen something pretty special and then we headed home.\n\nSee. I told you it was going to be a short review.\n\nI got a setlist too. Here’s a picture of it in my car. It was a wet night.\n\nThe first of a three part Sage trilogy. 3 nights over 4 days. This week was ridiculous for possible gig attendance. Gaz Coombes was playing in Newcastle on Wednesday, but we had to draw a line at three. I’m sure there was a decent Saturday gig too, but Thursday, Friday and Saturday was enough. All three of these gigs were just Ste & I.\n\nNo food in advance, but we arrived nice and early to have a look at the merch and have a chat. We were treated to any opportunity to have a pint of alt-J beer. Very nice it was too, if not quite strong. Good job it was early in the night. We gulped it quickly to make sure we got in on time to catch the support. Once we got in, we discovered we could have taken it in with us as it’s only the upper floors that ban drinks. Never mind.\n\nAK Patterson were up first. We haven’t seen many good support acts this year, except for those that were already established. This added to the lowlights list. Goodness me, these were bad. I mean, it’s clearly all a matter of taste and opinion and there was plenty of applause and post-gig positivity about them on twitter and Instagram, but these were not anywhere near my wheelhouse. Nor Ste’s. During song one, Ste sent me a quick text message so as to not break the sage vow of silence. Five simple words; “this is going to be shit”. He was not wrong. On the second or third track one of the dudes in the band cracked out a pink penny whistle complete with a pulley thing. Well that was it, my shoulders started shaking and tears were streaming down my eyes as I tried to hold back the laughter. I felt bad. In fact I feel bad writing this review, but I needed to capture this perverse form of entertainment in writing. I’m not sure why we didn’t leave at this point? We probably would have if we hadn’t already had our pints. We probably should have looking back, but fortunately it was only 6 or 7 songs. They are coming back to Newcastle in 2019. I can safely say that Ste & I won’t be going. Perhaps we’ll send Andrew though!\n\nWe had great seats for this gig. Row F. I’m pleased we did. alt-J put on a great performance. We saw them at Glastonbury last year and the stage set up was the same tonight as it was then. Divided into three with an absorbing light show. The setlist tonight was superb. They really captured everything I love about this band. Ste & I were joking that we might be seeing a performance of their new album, Reduxer, which is an album of all of the Relaxer songs remixed and reimagined. As it turns out, they did a good job of embedding three Reduxer fragments into the set. There were set highlights throughout. Something Good, Every Other Freckle, 3WW, Matilda, Deadcrush, Taro, Fitzpleasure and then the whole of the encore. The band don’t really saw a lot or do a lot but the Kraftwerk style stage set up suits them and it was a great set to watch in a venue like the sage. The seats were nice and I could get absorbed in the music and visuals. That said, the sage seating and theatre like atmosphere can leave a gig a little flat. I don’t think it did tonight, but the band were clearly pleased when the audience started to stand part way shortly after they started playing Fitzpleasure to close out the main set. They stayed standing for the chorus and we went home happy.\n\nI nearly got the second alt-J vinyl (already having the debut and most recent albums), but decided to leave it by the end of the night as it’s definitely my least favourite of the three.\n\nPost-gig Instagram from the band even featured Ste and I (bottom right).\n\n54.967689\n\n-1.602089"
