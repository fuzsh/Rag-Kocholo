        "text": "Janice Hallett is a British author, screenwriter and an award-winning journalist. Her debut novel The Appeal was a Waterstones Thriller of the Month and winner of the CWA Debut Dagger award. Her second novel The Twyford Code won the British Crime & Thriller Book of the Year, and her third novel The Mysterious Case of the Alperton Angels was an instant Sunday Times bestseller. Her latest novel The Examiner will be published in August.\n\nBefore her breakout entry into the realms of crime fiction, Janice Hallett worked as a journalist, magazine editor and speech writer for the Cabinet Office and Home Office, as well as writing for the stage and screen.\n\nJanice will be talking to New Writing North’s Claire Malcolm about her inspiring career to date, as well as offering advice to writers of all genres who are beginning their careers.\n\nThis talk will be live-captioned by StageText\n\nIncluded with the Virtual Pass\n\nAs an editor who moonlights as an author, Kasim Ali has both edited other people’s works and had his own work edited. In this writing session, he’ll lead you in understanding the underlying arc of your work and how to make sure that you don’t lose forward momentum or become stagnant. Whether it’s to do with the plot itself, character motivations, or just simply how do you move a story along, this writing session will help you see your work from above, even when it feels like you’re in the weeds.\n\nThe first few pages often determine whether your work will be accepted for publication or not. Editors are looking for many things, not least your ability to express yourself in clean clear sentences and well-developed paragraphs. In this session, experienced writer and editor Jacob Ross will show you how to improve your work and enhance your chances of getting published. We will look at common pitfalls to avoid and how to produce a strong engaging work. Jacob Ross is a writer and Associate Fiction Editor at Peepal Tree Press.\n\nElliot Prior started his role at Curtis Brown Literary Agency two years ago. Before that, he worked in Sweden at Albatross agency, before moving to a role as a scout at Eccles Fisher Associates. Elliot is interested in fiction that is expansive, stylistic, and packed with well-drawn and complicated characters. In non-fiction, he is looking for fresh perspectives on classic topics, as well as absorbing narratives that embed the reader in another time and place; Elliot will be offering advice on finding a literary agent for your work, and answering any questions you may have.\n\nIt’s said that everyone has a book in them – but should you write it? How do you make your life story interesting to other people? How do you avoid the danger of: ‘This happened. Then this happened. And then we lived happily ever after. The end.’ This practical workshop with will be fun, and funny (hopefully). It won’t involve listening to people reading out something they’ve written about their family (boring). It might inspire you to believe that writing autobiography isn’t narcissistic (well, not always). It might spark a new idea about how to approach it. Jessica Hepburn is the author of Save Me From the Waves and 21 Miles.\n\nFounded in 1899, the Books Department of Curtis Brown has been at the forefront of international publishing and a leading literary agency for over one hundred years. This session will be led by Agency Assistants Grace Robinson and Natalie Beckett, who will be discussing how to get a literary agent and answering your questions.\n\nGrace is particularly interested in reading work by northern writers in both fiction and non-fiction. Across all genres, she is interested in writing with a strong sense of place, well-drawn relationships and an interesting, surprising use of language. Natalie particularly enjoys reading work by Irish writers and Celtic themes. She enjoys stories with strong plots, well-crafted worlds, and wacky, eccentric characters she can fall in love with.\n\nPlease bring your own packed lunch or head out into Newcastle City Centre.
