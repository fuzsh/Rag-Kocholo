        "text": "Since time immemorial, the written word has transcended borders and writers who, either through economic migration, adventure, self-preservation, or the sanctity of their pen, have found refuge in new territories.\n\nThese new cities have become homes to the erudite ones who have enraptured us through their published works and literary talents.\n\nTyne and Wear in North-East England is no stranger to being a home to Black writers who have brought their distinct voices to shape the literary landscape and writing new narratives relevant to the current times.\n\nThis edition spotlights the new generation of Black Northern Writers who are contributing to the growth of literature in Tyne and Wear.\n\nTolu’ A.

He grew up on his grandmother’s storytelling of African folklore and thus fell in love with stories, and by extension, literature. He picked his first James Hadley Chase novel at 8; and for the love of stories, was done with both the Quran and the Bible by the time he was 10. After acing his JSC Exams in high school, however, he was forcibly sent to science class – science in Nigeria at the time was reserved for the ‘best’ students. Although he started publishing in 2016, it wasn’t until 20 long years after being sent to science class before he finally found his way back to his passion, in March 2019, when he left a ten-year career in media and entertainment to become a full-time writer.\n\nIn that time, he has taken an array of writing courses, including a specialisation program offered by Wesleyan University and a specialised course offered by the University of Iowa, among others. He was selected for the January 2021 Tampered Press Writing Workshop, as well as the Perfecting Your Manuscript Workshop by Mmabasi’s Legacy Literary Center. Also, in that time, his work has appeared in respectable platforms like Typehouse Literary Magazine, JMWW, the Chaffin Journal, Landlocked Magazine, Popula, Door is a Jar Magazine, Ake Review, Zone 3, Agbowó Magazine, Interpret Magazine, Black Muslim Reads Anthology, Analogies & Allegories Literary Magazine, Subsaharan Magazine, the Shallow Tales Review, the Decolonial Passage, Pollux Journal, Iman Collective, Bell Press, 100 Words of Solitude, the Journal of African Youth Literature, Sundial Magazine, and more."
