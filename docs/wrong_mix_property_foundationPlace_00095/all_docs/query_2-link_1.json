In 2021, McCune signed over her voting shares and control of the company to the independent Sage-SMM Trust. This marked an irrevocable step towards her long-standing estate plan goal of ensuring Sage remains an independent company focused on its mission to build bridges to knowledge through educational and research publishing.\n\nMcCune is also co-founder and president of the McCune Foundation, based in Ventura, California, which supports productive change through building social capital in two counties on California’s Central Coast. Previously, she was a long-serving member of the board of directors of the Social Science Research Council, the American Academy of Political Science, and Stanford’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.\n\nMcCune is a graduate of Queens College and the recipient of honorary doctorates from Queens College (CUNY), University of Sussex, University of Bath, and California State University Channel Islands. She has also been recognized as an honorary alumna of the University of California, Santa Barbara; an honorary Fellow at Cardiff University and Pembroke College, Oxford; and is a recipient of the prestigious London Book Fair Lifetime Achievement Award. McCune is a member of the American Philosophical Society (founded by Benjamin Franklin). In May 2021 McCune was honored at the 30th Annual One To World Fulbright Awards Dinner."
