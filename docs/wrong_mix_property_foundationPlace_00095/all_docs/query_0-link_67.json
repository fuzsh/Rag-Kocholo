Shyster, swindler, svengali — they have always been with us and always will.\n\nOne of the modern incarnations of this ancient art is the internet business guru.\n\nScrolling through my feed on Facebook, I often come upon what seem like perfectly ordinary people waxing lyrical about how they make five, or even six figures if they’re particularly brazen and gone a bit bananas, a month usually doing something that sounds a bit vague and would make little sense to someone even back in the nineties.\n\nThe pitch will go something like: ‘I’m no writer but I make five figures on Amazon every month by … .’\n\nOr they’ll say something about affiliate marketing and 5 or 6 figures.\n\nOr leveraging something or other and the necessary number of figures.\n\nOr lowcontent books on Amazon.\n\nOr financial something and those purty little figures."
