        "text": "Dame Catherine Cookson was born Katie McMullen on 20 June 1906 in Tyne Dock.\n\nHer unmarried mother, Kate Fawcett, returned to service, leaving little Katie to be brought up by her Grandmother Rose and Step-Grandfather John McMullen.\n\nYoung Katie McMullen's childhood was tainted by the taunts of local schoolchildren who had learned of her illegitimacy. She left St. Peter and St. Paul's school in Tyne Dock at the age of 14 to enter domestic service.\n\nWhen she was 18 Katie started work as a laundry checker at Harton Workhouse, on the site of the present South Tyneside District Hospital.\n\nLeaving the North East\n\nCraving security and respectability, she left the North East in 1929 to manage a laundry in Sussex. By the age of 27 she had scrimped and saved enough to buy a large house and take in gentlemen boarders.\n\nOne was schoolmaster Thomas Cookson with whom she fell in love and married in 1940.\n\nKatie McMullen then became Catherine Cookson, but happiness seemed to evade the young Mrs Cookson and there were years of physical and mental illness and the heartbreak of several miscarriages.\n\nWriting her first book\n\nOn the advice of her doctor, Catherine took up writing and her first novel 'Kate Hannigan' was completed in 1948 at the age of 42.\n\nShe continued to write at a punishing pace, often from her sick bed, eventually completing 103 books.\n\nMoving back to the North East\n\nAs Catherine's health deteriorated the Cooksons settled back in the North East.\n\nThere were countless literary awards and honours including an OBE in 1985 and an honorary Doctorate of letters by Sunderland Polytechnic in 1991.\n\nSouth Tyneside's most famous daughter became Dame Catherine Cookson in the 1993 New Year's Honours List.\n\nDame Catherine Cookson died on 11 June 1998 at home in Newcastle.\n\nChildhood environment\n\nIn the early twentieth century Tyne Dock was at the heart of industrial Tyneside.\n\nCatherine was born at 5 Leam Lane, a two roomed terrace next to the docks and the five Tyne Dock arches. At the bottom of the lane, trams would set off for Jarrow passing the 'Slake' and St. Paul's Church along the way.\n\nA few minutes walk west up Leam Lane was the little county school that Catherine first attended set amidst the farms and fields of Simonside.\n\nMillions of tons of coal a year were brought to Tyne Dock. Day and night coal trains could be heard thundering over the arches and into the docks.\n\nA short walk under the arches and up the dock bank was St. Peter and St. Paul's Catholic Church, situated next to the railway station.\n\nCatherine was a regular attender at the church and nearby pawn shop 'Bobs' in Bede Street.\n\nWhen Catherine was six, the family moved to 10 William Black Street in East Jarrow, a small community of three streets and two terraces, situated halfway between Tyne Dock and Jarrow.\n\nAcross the road was Jarrow Slake, a large area of tidal mudflats that flooded twice a day.\n\nThe river Don, a small tributary of the Tyne, flowed around the mudflats. The Don was nicknamed 'The Gut' and could be particularly dangerous when the tide turned."
