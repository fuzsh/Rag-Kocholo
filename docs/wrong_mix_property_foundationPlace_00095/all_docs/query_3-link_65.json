        "text": "In the realm of entrepreneurship, building a startup is often seen as a challenging endeavour. It requires dedication, resilience, and a clear vision to navigate the turbulent waters of the business world successfully. However, when the goal of your startup is to address significant societal and environmental issues, the journey becomes even more daunting.\n\nAs part of our quick founder questions series - or QFQs - we spoke to Nick Haley, founder of Little Big Tech about the fast pace and culture of high growth businesses, the power of podcasts and the importance of an open, high-trust culture.\n\nIn today's competitive ecommerce landscape, merely facilitating transactions is no longer sufficient to stand out. Consumers seek meaningful interactions and personalised experiences that leave a lasting impression. This is where AI-enhanced ecommerce service steps in, offering innovative solutions to elevate customer engagement and satisfaction.\n\nThere’s an overwhelming amount of research that consistently proves female leaders are exceptional leaders: companies led by women not only regularly outperform the market average but also exhibit remarkable metrics, including a 20% surge in stock price momentum, a 6% uptick in profitability, and 8% larger stock returns.\n\nWhile gender diversity is a fundamental issue in the startup ecosystem, VCs are also at the forefront of promoting parity. Women are currently under-represented in the world's leading funds, but they can significantly contribute to organisations that implement adequate policy at every stage of the company.\n\nEvery week, Maddyness brings you the latest investment news from the UK startup ecosystem. Here's a recap of this week's investments.\n\nThe three-day summit in Paris will take place later this month and welcome over 35,000 attendees who hope to create positive change as the world battles a climate crisis.\n\nAs part of our quick founder questions series - or QFQs - we spoke to Mauro Cozzi, CEO and Co-founder of Emitwise about carbon accountancy, addressing scope 3 emissions and the journey to net zero.\n\nWhether it's the risk of deepfakes spreading disinformation online or concerns over weakening copyright protection, AI is generating anxiety over its role in the creator economy.\n\nThe UK punches above its weight when it comes to innovation and pioneering technologies in Europe. Yet, there is a stark contrast between the split of private investment in London and other regions of the UK - the North of England is £6B underfunded compared to the capital. Limited venture capital (VC) activity and a relative lack of a startup ecosystem and expertise is hindering the potential for growth in the regions and underscores the pressing need for a more robust investment framework and a concerted effort to break investment barriers.\n\nDespite all the talk and focus of companies on DE&I, a new survey reveals that half (50.73%) of job seekers have encountered negative bias during the application process.\n\nInternational Women’s Day prompts leaders to champion women in the workplace and exhibit their plans to advance female empowerment and equity in their companies. But, how can leaders demonstrate more than just compliance when advocating for gender equity in the workplace?"
