A German or An Argentinian, could you Imagine the Headlines the Gutter Press would come Up with if the England side Run by either of the two Gentlemen named should the 3 Lions Fail to Win Every match considering the History of their two Countries have with England/Britain.\n\nLee Carsley. No there's a World of Difference between Managing the England U 21 Side and the National Team, and working under Southgate, would that mean the Same Dreary Negative Boring Football England Fans would have to Put Up With No Thanks.\n\nGraham Potter. A Maybe but leaning towards a No. Not Enough Top Level Experience.\n\nEddie Howe. Doesn't Matter if the F.A. have to Pay Newcastle Compensation. Get the Guy signed Up Now. He's a Battler a Manager who has a Proven Fighting Spirit can get the Best out of All his Players and Make them Believe in themselves and make them Play at a High Level Match after Match. This Guy Knows what it's like having to Produce a Winning Team on a Shoestring Budget. When The Going Gets Tough Eddie Howe Gets Going.\n\nOne other Manager Tom Williams as Failed to Mention Sean Dyche. A Manager in the Howe Mould. That's What England Need Right Now A LEADER someone to Get the 3 Lions over the Line to Finally Win a Major Trophy. I Think either Howe or Dyche Could Do It.\n\ngraham potter has not done enough to warrant the position.\n\nits like handing the role to frank lampard, steven gerrard or wayne rooney just because they were legends. none of them have enough about themselves, i think its important the role is given on merit. instead of what they could do or down to inspiration.\n\nwhoever does takeover from gareth southgate will have a straight forward task in comparison to what southgate had to do.\n\nmauricio pochettino no.\n\nthomas tuchel no.\n\nhaving managed in england and having done elsewhere is not enough in my eyes.\n\nits the same with jurgen klopp, although i think out of all the foreign managers he is the best. eddie howe needs more experience, landing the newcastle job will be like a dream come true with the money they will now have. he could help guide them to being one of the top six teams.\n\nlee carsley i am not against because he fits what gareth southgate did and will know the players on the verge of becoming regular first team internationals.\n\nHenry Winter has a good insight for the next England manager\n\nJurgen Klopp - Would play high pressing football. He also took on the parent role, like Southgate did, and was adored by the fans because he embraced the culture of Liverpool. He'd continue the harmony between fans and players but would he be tempted by International football? It's less intense than club football in which he wants a break from due to the tiring nature of it. Even if he wanted International management would he rather Germany only or would England be an open position for him to take on?\n\nPoch - As in Henry Winter's post has worked with youngsters in a positive way and plays decent football. He was unlucky to be let go by Chelsea, thought he did a good job once he implemented his style.\n\nGraham Potter - Deemed to have failed at Chelsea but it was always a tough job. People forget how good of a job he did at Brighton. He had them playing beautiful football that was good on the eye and was successful at doing so. His style laid the foundations for \"De Zerbi ball\" which had many people raving about Brighton.\n\nEddie Howe - Plays a type of football that would be what this crop of English players would benefit from. He's stated he'd be open to taken the reigns.\n\nLee Carsley - Has gone through the ranks and won the Euros with the u21s. Wouldn't be a statement making appointment but could turn doubters into believers.\n\nPep Guardiola - very unlikely but not impossible. Only has a year left on his City contract and I'm certain he's wanting International management but doesn't want the Spain job. If the FA goes about it the right way, he might be tempted. Give him the last year at City then take the reigns afterwards with an interim taking charge of qualifiers and Nations League games beforehand. We all know how exciting and attractive his football is. Would definitely be able to get the best out of the players.\n\nAs good as players they were the likes of Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney shouldn't be considered but I wouldn't put it past the FA to have talks or even consider them at some point.\n\nI don't think that a foreign Manager should lead England. It needs to be an English Manager because there will be no chance of a conflict of interest if England got to the latter stages of a tournament.\n\nI really want to see a different kind of Manager appointed this time. Someone who has guided a team to some sort of success.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a PL Manager either. It has to be a person who can build a team that plays like a team yet like a club team.\n\nThere is a mistaken notion that a manager of an international team has to build a team of the best individuals available in the top league. This is not necessarily the case. For example, Notts use statistical data to recruit their players that will fit best into their style of play. The best players may not necessarily be able to do that.\n\nI think this method should be used to choose the players to build an England side too. The players chosen should be the best team players that can be moulded into a team.\n\nI think it is important to try to get several players from one team because it would be much easier to integrate those players, as we have seen with the Spanish team.\n\nI say treat the England team as a club team and once the 25 players have been chosen, give them time together with plenty of match practice, to mould them into a team.\n\nLets Be Real. How Much Do You Think Hiring Pep would be? Southgate's Wages would look Like Peanuts Compared to what the F.A. would have to Pay the Manchester City Head Coach. I will also Stick to My Statement of NO FOREIGN COACHES. Why ? Because A Foreign Coach just won't be fully committed to the English Cause.. Look at the Foreign Coaches England have already had. Sven Yeah he Did So So The Less said about Capello the Better.\n\nDo you want a Rank Outsider? Look No Further than Former Notts Manager Luke Williams. He'll quickly get the Fans on side (as he did at the Lane). Earn Great Respect From his Players because His Man Management Skills are Superb. get somebody in to help him with the Defence and Bingo Everything You Need In A New Head Coach."
