        "text": "I've just been to Sage Gateshead, the Foster-designed music centre on the south bank of the Tyne. Violinist Peter Cropper, late of the Lindsay String Quartet, was playing in a newly formed piano trio in the smaller auditorium - an intimate, beautiful space that can be reconfigured so the performers are in the centre or at the side. Tonight they were in the centre. There's a visceral intensity to being so close to the performers that you can almost feel their breath. You start to feel bound up in the drama.\n\nSage is gorgeous and palatial, with stunning vistas over the Tyne. But four niggles. You can book some, but not every, event online. Why? There are deafening announcements up to half an hour before the performance starts (telling you when it is going to start). The posh restaurant is uninvitingly situated in a sort of windowless corridor. And telephoning to find out what time the concert was going to end nearly killed me. The system eschews hold music. I thought I'd been cut off, and it took me a couple of goes to figure out I had to persist. A recorded message advised me to try later if I was on hold for more than 10 minutes - which struck me as a real admittance of failure. How can they afford to let people sit on hold for five minutes, let alone 10?\n\n· The concerts outweigh the frustration, disappointment and, sometimes, fun you can have getting tickets. And who can complain about the venue, when before a concert you can stand on one of its balconies looking at the Newcastle/ Gateshead skyline.\n\nPosted by Phil\n\n· Sage is in danger of getting a reputation for putting on soulless gigs. I and others I know are already falling out of love with it as a venue.\n\nPosted by R Benitez\n\n· R Benitez was obviously not at the Sharon Jones gig a few weeks ago, where the atmosphere was fantastic, and everyone was dancing madly (not to say sweating!).\n\nPosted by Tilly Ferens"
