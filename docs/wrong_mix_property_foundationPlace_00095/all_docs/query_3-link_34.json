Hear about Lisette’s book and her inspirations then have a go at creating your own world.\n\nWill your world be inspired by the world around you or will it be fantastical? What kind of people or creatures might you put in your world? What will it look, feel or smell like? All materials will be provided for this session.\n\nThis event is suited to children aged 8-12\n\nEvent details\n\nWhen: Sunday 27 November, 12-1pm\n\nWhere: Discovery Museum\n\nPlease arrive 10 minutes before the event is due to start.\n\nThis event is organised by the National Literacy Trust’s Read North East Hub, in partnership with Northern Children’s Book Festival.

Disabled, neurodivergent and northern, some say she’s a word artist, she says she does stuff with words.\n\nAs a writer and artist, she works with words in all its forms, as an author, as a solo artist, with collaborators, and alongside wonderful humans as a creative practitioner and mentor.\n\nLisette is an award-winning poet; the 2019 Early Careers Fellow for Literature at Cove Park; on the TSS Publishing list of Best British & Irish Flash Fiction; and winner of The Journal Culture Award 2021 for Performance of the Year for WRITING THE MISSING – A RIVER CYCLE commissioned by Durham Book Festival. Her debut middle grade novel THE SECRET OF HAVEN POINT was published by Puffin in February 2022, with THE STICKLEBACK CATCHERS to follow in February 2023.\n\nVisit Lisette's website."
