        "text": "The Biscuit Factory is an independent art gallery, founded in 2002 and located in the cultural quarter of Newcastle, Ouseburn. A former Victorian biscuit manufacturing warehouse, The Biscuit Factory underwent a sympathetic refurbishment, ensuring that many of the original and characterful facets of the building such as the beams and brickwork were maintained. Adding an upper floor, accessible by a bespoke staircase, provided a treble height atrium that allows natural daylight to flood through the centre of the gallery and provides what is now our headline artist's exhibition space. A number of artist studios were also developed on the lower 2 floors of the building housing 25 creative work spaces.\n\nThe ethos of the gallery has always been to provide a platform for local and national artists, to support emergent makers, to showcase established artists and to add to the cultural landscape of the region. The huge scale of the gallery means that we are able to display the work of over 250 artists at any time, with a team of Curators hand selecting work. We exhibit and sell original paintings, handmade prints, glass, ceramics, textiles, photography, furniture, design led homewares and jewellery. Receiving over 50,000 visitors a year our focus is on making art accessible and creating a genuine marketplace for artists and makers."
