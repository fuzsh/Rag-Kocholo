Join our North East Group on Saturday 11 May from 11am for their next meet-up in Newcastle.

In this first session, we will have a short fireside chat on ‘Writing for Work and Writing with Agility for Different Audiences and Outlets’ with Dr Emily Yarrow, author and Senior Academic at Newcastle University. This will be followed by time to share ideas and insights, discuss your work, and feedback for future group sessions. Please come with your ideas to share.

We’ll meet at the Lit and Phil Library, 23 Westgate Road, Newcastle, NE1 1SE. The Lit and Phil is close to Newcastle central rail station and central station metro. Turn right and walk for less than a minute. The building is on the corner of Westgate Road, Orchard Street/Neville Street, next to Neville Hall.

Doors will open from 10.40am to meet for coffee before we start the discussion at 11am.

All members welcome – come along and be part of your local group!
