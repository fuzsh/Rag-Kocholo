Cambridge Scholars Publishing is an independent academic publisher, committed to providing a forward-thinking publishing service that champions original thinking, whilst ensuring we put our authors at the heart of everything we do.

Founded in 2001 by former lecturers and researchers from the University of Cambridge, we publish original academic work across a wide range of subjects in four key areas: Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS); Health Sciences (HS); Physical Sciences (PS); and Life Sciences (LS).

How We Approach Academic Publishing Differently

We retain a balance between our editorial guidance and the level of control retained by our authors, acknowledging the value of presenting an authorâ€™s work in a way that retains the integrity of their original argument. We believe strongly in equality of opportunity, diversity of voices, and an ecology of knowledge.

We are proud of our reputation for author satisfaction. The publishing process should be a rewarding experience. There is no cost to our authors/editors to publish. We offer complimentary copies, a substantial author discount, and a generous royalty scheme.

Our publications are marketed worldwide and sold through international booksellers and distributors including Amazon, Blackwell, Baker & Taylor, EBSCO/Gobi, and Ingram, and are purchased by academic libraries across the world. In addition, we have distribution partnerships in key geographical territories such as the USA, China, India and the Middle East.

Our operational headquarters is located in the historic Lady Stephenson Library, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, with representative offices in Berlin, Germany; and Barcelona, Spain.
