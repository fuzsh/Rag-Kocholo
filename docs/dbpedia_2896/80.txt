ANN ARBOR, MI - Ten years after providing a foundational gift toward the creation of the University of Michigan Barger Leadership Institute, Dave Barger has provided another $10 million gift to expand the institute's reach.

Barger, a UM alumnus and retired chief executive officer for JetBlue Airways, provided the gift on the 10th anniversary of the institute to expand and sustain the institute's ability to develop forward-thinking leaders from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.

"It's a great honor to be able to continue to support the BLI and to help expand experiential opportunities for the next generation of leaders," Barger said in a news release. "Michigan excels at preparing undergraduate students to contribute as well-rounded, forward-thinking leaders, and it's a privilege to be able to support this important work."

Since Barger provided an initial $4.5 million gift to endow the institute in 2007, it has helped students beyond the classroom with action-based programs including technology startups, art projects, international development efforts and campus activities.

The gift establishes the Richard H. Price Founders Fund at LSA, honoring the leadership of Richard Price, the BLI's founding director. The fund will keep the founding director's vision alive by enabling future institute directors to experiment with innovative programs and opportunities.

Barger's additional support will enhance and expand the BLI programs by giving more students access to BLI resources, such as fellowships, internships, skills seminars, small group coaching and global experiences. Funding will allow the BLI to expand ongoing programs and pilot new programs, all while promoting the work under way at the institute.

Since 1987, Barger has given more than $18 million in support of LSA, Athletics, University Libraries, Michigan Medicine and the Alumni Association.
