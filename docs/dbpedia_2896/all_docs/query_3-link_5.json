        "text": "ROCK HILL, S.C. – Two former standout student-athletes and a longtime campus administrator have been chosen for induction into the South Atlantic Conference Hall of Fame in 2013, league commissioner Patrick Britz announced on Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the Class of 2013 include former Catawba women's soccer player Catey Conner, former Mars Hill cross country runner Brock Bailey and former Carson-Newman director of athletics David Barger.\n\n\"It's with great excitement that we unveil this impressive class,\" said Britz. \"Catey and Brock were two of the conference's most decorated student-athletes during the 1990s, and David's leadership – on the campus, conference and national levels – helped the league get to where it is today.\"\n\nThe SAC Hall of Fame Class of 2013 will be officially inducted at the league's annual banquet on June 6 in Asheville, N.C. Bios of each honoree can be found below.\n\nBrock Bailey\n\nMars Hill men's cross country | 1995-98\n\nBrock Bailey was a key figure in building Mars Hill cross country into what is now the conference's most dominant program. Behind Bailey, the Lions won SAC championships in 1997 and 1998, beginning a streak of conference titles that has now reached 16 straight.\n\nBailey earned a laundry list of cross country accolades during his MHC career, including being named the SAC Freshman of the Year in 1995, SAC Runner of the Year in 1998 and the SAC Cross Country Scholar-Athlete of the Year in 1996 and 1998. He was also a member of the All-Conference First Team in 1995, 1997 and 1998, and an Academic All-American in 1998.\n\nToday, Bailey coaches track and cross country at Daniel High School in Pickens, S.C., where he was named the 2012 HSSR Coach of the Year after his boys' team won the AAA state cross country championship.\n\nDavid Barger\n\nCarson-Newman Director of Athletics | 1970-2012\n\nFor more than three decades, David Barger was the driving force of Carson-Newman athletics. A 1970 C-N graduate, Barger returned to his alma mater in 1980 as Director of Athletic Promotions then Director of Athletic Development before being named AD in 1990.\n\nUnder Barger's guidance, Carson-Newman built one of the SAC's most well-rounded athletic departments, led by a national power football program that won NAIA national titles in 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1989, and reached the NCAA Division II championship game three times from 1996 through 1999. He was instrumental in transitioning Eagles athletics from NAIA to Division II in 1993.\n\nBarger's Carson-Newman tenure included SAC Echols Athletic Excellence Awards in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2010. C-N student-athletes earned SAC Presidents Awards and SAC Athlete of the Year Awards – the league's most prestigious individual honors – eight times under his watch. His career saw participation in intercollegiate athletics at the school increase 20 percent.\n\nSince his retirement in 2012, Barger has continued to serve in an advisory role at Carson-Newman as Athletics Director Emeritus.\n\nCatey Conner\n\nCatawba women's soccer | 1997-2000\n\nOne of just four players in SAC women's soccer history to earn multiple conference Player of the Year awards, Catey Conner led Catawba to arguably its most successful period in program history. Conner's Catawba teams won three-straight Food Lion SAC Soccer Tournament titles from 1997 through 1999, and reached the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament in 1997.\n\nIn addition to being named SAC Player of the Year in 1998 and 1999, Conner was the conference's Freshman of the Year in 1997, a third-team All-American in 1999, a four-time selection to the All-Conference First Team, and a four-time All-Southeast Region First Team pick.\n\nConner's 59 goals scored remain tied for the sixth-most in SAC history, and her 134 career points are tied for 10th in league history.\n\nConner is currently the Director of Coaching for U11-14 at Charlotte United FC, providing oversight for 26 girls' soccer teams."
