I have always been active with Brown. Since graduation I have held many offices, been on the Associated Alumni, and every year I interview prospective students. My late husband, Herbert Epstein, was Brown ’49. I am proud to say that our son, David Epstein ’74, has followed with his devotion to Brown. While a student he was manager of WBRU. Since graduation he has cochaired the Brown Alumni Fund, received an Alumni Service Award, and been copresident of the Brown Club of Central New Jersey, which was the first alumni club to honor President Christina Paxson before she took office.

As an elder GI, I entered Brown in 1946 in the class of '49. I accelerated and graduated in '48. As a consequence of the acceleration and engineering requirements, I hardly know anyone in '48 or '49—my loss. I applaud Brown for its rise to a first-rate university—the Ivies have set the bar in many areas. But I decry the cost of tuition, up over 100 times the cost of tuition in 1948 ($400); excess is everywhere. I hope Brown graduates will go somewhere other than to play the financial game—they are needed in other arenas. At age 92 I watch the scene of American activities with interest, amazement, and some trepidation. The Brown Alumni Magazine is well done.\"\n\nCol. Paul A. Lucey writes: \"Last June, the South Korean government invited a group of Korean War veterans to be guests for a week of memorials honoring those who served in the war.\" Paul and Lt. Gen.

I keep busy giving lectures on politics and public policy to various groups and making occasional appearances on community TV. On Oct. 5 I attended the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, Tenn. There I was able to hear Valerie Tutson ’87, ’90 AM, a founding member of the Rhode Island Black Storytellers. Because only the best tellers are invited to this world-famous festival, I expected much from her performance, and I was not disappointed.

We have started collecting photos for the 55th reunion album.\"\n\nFrom the January / February 1999 Issue\n\nJohn H. Campbell, Hardwick, Mass., writes: \"My wife, Achsah Shedaker, and I have enjoyed travels abroad this spring and summer. In May we flew from O'Hare to St. Petersburg, Russia, with our former rector and eight other courageous souls. The city, regrettably, is in deplorable physical condition. Museums, cathedrals, and palaces, however, are every bit as beautiful as reputed. For us, it was literally a once-in-a-lifetime experience; the highlight was the short (two hours) visit with the babushka whom Achsah helps to support through the Telios Foundation. Needless to say, Russia's political and economic woes are more meaningful to us than would be the case had we not gone. In July, we again traversed the Atlantic to the U.K., where we walked in Yorkshire and in Wales; we'd done the same three years earlier in England's Lake District. In our opinion, there is no better way to appreciate the people and the countryside. Good hiking shoes and healthy appetites are a must; we always return in good shape, physically and mentally.\"\n\nFrom the November / December 1998 Issue\n\nLester Rand submitted a poem about his recent 50th reunion. In one stanza, he writes: \"But quickly recollections here and there did appear/ And time miraculously slid backward year by year./ In a short while the long interval was somehow compressed/ As friends and acquaintances of long ago were rather quicky assessed.\"\n\nFrom the September / October 1998 Issue\n\nThe 50th reunion weekend, May 22-25, was a wonderful success. For the women, it was led by Pembroke class president Nancy Cantor Eddy, reunion chairperson Betty Montali Smith, and their large committee. Ideal weather greeted the 145 Brown and Pembroke alumni who attended, which represents 28 percent of the class - an all-time record for a 50th reunion. There were seventy-five women from all over the country at the Pembroke Hope Club luncheon on Saturday. One even came from Argentina.\n\nWe elected class officers for the next five years: Nancy Cantor Eddy, president; Breffny Feely Walsh, vice president; Constance Hurley Andrews, secretary; Barbara Baker Johnson, treasurer; Janet French Laughlin, reunion chair; and Constance Hurley Andrews, Michelina Rizzo, and Breffny Feely Walsh, nominating committee. Dues were increased to $25 per year. Two of the thirteen students supported by the Pembroke Class of 1948 Scholarship, Lydia English '85, an associate dean at Brown, and current recipient Elizabeth Corey '98, spoke to the gathering.\n\nFriday night there was a reception at reunion headquarters, Alpha Chi Omega, followed by the wonderful Brown Bear Buffet and Campus Dance. On Saturday, the Commencement forums were followed by dinner at the Squantum Club and the Pops Concert with Ray Charles. Highlights of the weekend were breakfast at the Faculty Club on Sunday morning with Brown's 17th president, E. Gordon Gee, and the alumni waterfront festival at Waterplace Park. The cocktail buffet at Café Nuovo, hosted by Don Patrick, was wonderful. And of course there was the procession through the Van Wickle Gates and down College Hill, with the crowd cheering all the way to the meeting house. We will remember our 50th reunion for a long time.\n\n- Nancy Cantor Eddy, class president\n\n50th reunion attendees included: Constance Hurley Andrews, Aline Archambault, JuneAnne Mullane Aumand, George Ball, James Bartley, Virginia Silva Baxter, Pauline Chartier Bergevin, Richard Bishop, George Bland, Norma F.
