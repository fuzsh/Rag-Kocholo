        "text": "Loyola University Maryland head men’s lacrosse coach Charley Toomey announced the hiring of an assistant coach with more than 30 years of NCAA coaching experience on July 5, 2016, when he tabbed Marc Van Arsdale as the Greyhounds’ offensive coordinator.\n\nVan Arsdale most recently spent the last 15 seasons as an assistant at the University of Virginia, the previous 10 as the Cavaliers’ associate head coach. On the Charlottesville sideline, Van Arsdale helped the Cavaliers win three NCAA Championships (2003, 2006 and 2011) while mentoring three Tewaaraton Trophy winners (Steele Stanwick, Matt Ward and Chris Rotelli).\n\nHis impact at Loyola has been no less as he mentored the Greyhounds' first Tewaaraton Award winner when Pat Spencer took home the award for the nation's top player in 2019.\n\nThree of the Van Arsdale-coached Loyola offenses have been ranked in the NCAA's top-eight for scoring offense since he came to the Greyhounds.\n\nAll told, Van Arsdale has been a member of 11 NCAA Championship teams as a coach and player. In addition to the three at Virginia, he was a player on four title teams at Hobart College (1982-1985), and he assisted four Statesmen championship teams (1987-90).\n\nHis offenses have routinely been amongst the NCAA leaders in scoring offense, as well as points and assists per game, and he has coached some of the most prolific individuals in the game. Since he returned to Charlottesville in 2002, the Cavaliers’ offenses were in the top-12 nationally in scoring offense for 13 of 15 years. They were tops in the country twice (2006 and 2009), in the top-five six times and the top-10 on 11 occasions.\n\nVan Arsdale tutored Steele Stanwick who graduated as a two-time First Team All-American and the 2011 Tewaaraton Trophy winner after setting the program record for points (269). Stanwick led the nation in assists per game (3.19) and was second in points (5.0) as a senior in 2012, and his 269 points were 18th in NCAA history at the time of his graduation.\n\nDuring Virginia’s 2011 NCAA Championships season, the Cavaliers finished third nationally with 12.56 goals, 6.94 assists and 19.50 points per game. Meanwhile, Stanwick won the Tewaaraton Trophy as the nation’s top player sfter finishing the year third nationally in assists (2.24) and fourth in points (4.12).\n\nThe 2010 iteration of the Cavaliers offense was again a top scoring unit, ranking third in the nation in goals (13.44), assists (8.17) and points (21.61) per game. Chris Bocklet led the unit as a sophomore, scoring 53 goals, the second-most in a season by a Virginia player. He was the first Cavaliers player to score 50 or more goals since Doug Knight set the single-season record with 56 in 1996. He was not the only player to tally significant goal totals for Virginia that season, as 10 Cavaliers reached double-figures in goals scored.\n\nVirginia’s four-year stretch of outstanding scoring teams started in 2009 when the Cavaliers led the nation in goals (13.0), assists (7.83) and points per game (20.83). All three of that season’s starting attackmen – Garrett Billings (38), Stanwick (36) and Danny Glading (32) – tallied 30 or more goals, while All-American midfielders Shamel Bratton (31) and Brian Carroll (29) were also at or near that plateau.\n\nThe Cavaliers’ undefeated NCAA Championship team in 2006 featured one of the most prolific offenses in recent college lacrosse. They led the nation in scoring with an average of 15.82 goals per game, scoring 269 during the year.\n\nVan Arsdale was named the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) Division I Assistant Coach of the Year following that season, while Matt Ward earned the USILA Player of the Year and the Tewaaraton Trophy. Kyle Dixon was also rewarded with the USILA Midfielder of the Year award.\n\nThe 1985 graduate of Hobart College returned to Charlottesville in 2002 after spending five seasons (1997-2001) as the University of Pennsylvania’s head coach. Van Arsdale led the Quakers to a 27-39 overall record during his five seasons; he coached Penn to its first .500 season of the 1990s during his opening campaign in Philadelphia, leading the team to a 6-6 mark.\n\nPrior to his stint in Phialdelphia, Van Arsdale was an assistant at Virginia from 1991-1996 where he helped the Cavaliers reach the NCAA Championships five times. They advanced to the title game twice (1994 and 1996) and the semifinals in 1995. During this period, he recruited and mentored some of the top players in Virginia history, including David Curry, Doug Knight, Kevin Pehlke, Tucker Radebaugh, Greg Traynor, Michael Watson and Tim Whiteley.\n\nHis coaching career started in 1986 at NCAA Division III Nazareth College. He then moved back to his alma mater where he assisted the Statemen from 1987-1990, helping them win four-straight NCAA Division III titles.\n\nAs a player at Hobart, Van Arsdale was led his hometown team to four Division III titles. He was named a First Team All-American as a senior in 1985, a year in which he also earned National Division III Attackman of the Year honors.\n\nHe was chosen the Division III Championship game’s Most Valuable Player in 1983 and 1985, and he led the Statesmen in scoring his last two years in Geneva, New York. Van Arsdale finished his Hobart career ranked amongst the school’s top-10 leaders in career goals, assists and points.\n\nVan Arsdale was an academic standout, as well, at Hobart. He graduated magna cum laude and received an NCAA postgraduate scholarship after being named to the Dean’s List all four years he was at the school. He also was chosen as a Presidential Scholar and was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa honor society.\n\nHe was inducted to the Hobart College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001, joining his brother, Guy (Hobart ’83) and father, William (benefactor). Van Arsdale is also a member of the Geneva Sports Hall of Fame, Western New York Lacrosse Hall of Fame and the Virginia Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\n\nVan Arsdale’s wife, the former Karen Salemo, was an All-American lacrosse player at Hobart’s sister school, William Smith College; the couple has two children. Owen was a USILA Scholar All-American attackman at Virginia for his father where he totaled 124 career points. Their daughter, Elise, is a recent graduate of Villanova University."
