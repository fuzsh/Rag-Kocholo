        "text": "Howell native Mike Barger has navigated major crises in his life, as a TOPGUN fighter pilot and former executive of JetBlue Airways.\n\nHis storied life has included running an airline during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and managing other emergencies.\n\nBarger, a 1982 graduate of Howell High School who learned to fly at the Livingston County Spencer J Hardy Airport, is emerging as an expert on how to be a leader during times of crisis.\n\nHe currently teaches at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and works as a consultant with business leaders. He parted ways with JetBlue in 2011 to start a consulting business and the university later hired him to teach his real-world experiences to business students.\n\nEarlier this year, his book High Stakes: Leadership in Turbulent Times hit shelves and online stores, reaching some category-specific best-sellers lists on Amazon.\n\nCircling the runway\n\nIn 2005, a JetBlue Airways plane suffered front nose gear failure, putting the lives of passengers and crew at risk. The plane took off from Burbank, California, and the nose gear would not retract. The plane circled around the airport as officials planned an emergency landing.\n\n\"What was unique about that was JetBlue was the first with live TV on an airplane,\" Barger said. \"All of the customers were watching the media coverage of JetBlue flying around L.A.\"\n\nHe said an expert analyst on one news station said all aboard were going to die.\n\nThe emergency landing was successful and passengers were transferred to another plane to continue their journey to New York.\n\nBarger said that experience was a lesson in leadership during a crisis.\n\n\"Nobody is expecting a miracle solution,\" he said. \"Ultimately, folks are leaning into folks like you to know what is true, what is noise and when can we expect to get through this thing. What they are expecting is someone or some team to get in front of them and say, 'look, this is going to be hard and we're going to get through this.'\"\n\nHe said government officials and business leaders are not always prepared for crises, and some floundered during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"A lot of leaders, because they don't have really good answers, tend to disappear until they feel they have enough to tell people,\" Barger said. \"But when I'm not showing up to tell you what's going on, you're going to find somewhere else to get the information you want, and it might not be accurate.\"\n\nHe said a simple lesson he hopes to get across in his book, to his students and to his clients is that the middle of a crisis is a bad time to prepare for a crisis.\n\n\"Most businesses before COVID tended to say, 'what are the odds of finding ourselves in a crisis? If we get there, we’ll deal with it.' My argument is, so you’re telling me there is no chance of an employee dying or tornado, or data center goes down, security breach? You mean none of those things can happen to you?\"\n\nHe ran JetBlue Airway's emergency center during the 9-11 terrorist attacks and their aftermath.\n\n\"At the time, as a company, we had 17 A320 Airbuses and nine were in the air. All of those had to get on the ground in the next 15 minutes at the closest emergency field.\"\n\nBarger said his sense for crisis management developed during his 13 years in the Navy flying F-18s off aircraft carriers.\n\nHe was also a flight instructor who served as chief instructor of TOPGUN for several years. During several deployments, including during Desert Storm and Kosovo, he faced dangers and crises.\n\nOnce he was flying a fighter jet that was coming in for a landing on an aircraft carrier.\n\nAs he descended, visibility was bad.\n\nBarger said all he could see was a large shape he knew was the carrier. It was too late to abandon his landing by the time he learned there was another plane in the way of his landing.\n\nHe had to react to the crisis in the moment, ultimately landing on the other plane but alive.\n\n\"This whole idea of crisis leadership, it started there with all the crises in the military,\" he said.\n\nContact Livingston Daily reporter Jennifer Timar at jtimar@livingstondaily.com.
