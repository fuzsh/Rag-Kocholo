        "text": "The DAC is a forum to help provide the dean of LSA a bit of insight from another point-of-view, in my case from a corporate career in transportation. I've served three deans during my DAC tenure and look forward to assisting the U-M community in any way possible in the future. I truly value my Michigan pedigree, though I didn't realize how much until later in life when I was asked to support U-M through development and via the Dean's Advisory Council. As I now live in Ann Arbor, it's so very easy to be part of the U-M landscapeâ€”so when you've had the opportunity to travel the world with your U-M credentials, consider moving back 'home.'"
