When his family emigrated to the United States, Demir saw it as an opportunity to pursue a career where he could express his passion for helping others.\n\nAs a student at Urbandale High School he found that passion – quite by accident. On his first day of school in a new country, there was a scheduled fire drill. Unfamiliar with anything other than air raid sirens, Demir sprinted for cover in an interior bathroom. It took a group of teachers and a translator to convince him that it was just a fire drill and he was not in danger.\n\nIn the days that followed his English as a second language class did some fire department and fire safety training and he was hooked.\n\nDuring his senior year, he earned certification as a Firefighter/EMT. In the weeks after his high school graduation he was hired full-time as a member of the Urbandale Fire Department. Not one to rest after earning his position, Demir enrolled at DMACC with an eye toward becoming a Paramedic Specialist. He earned his AA in 2011 and from there attended Waldorf College where he earned his BS in Fire Science Administration with Summa Cum Laude honors. Today, he is nearing completion of a Master's degree in Public Administration.\n\nIn tandem with his education, he has steadily moved up at the Urbandale Fire Department. In 2013, he was promoted to Driver/Engineer, in 2015 he was named Lieutenant, and in 2019 he earned the rank of Captain where he currently serves as the Shift Supervisor. In addition, he is tasked as the technical rescue lead for the department. Twice he has been recognized with awards for his excellence in training.\n\nIn his free time, Demir launched Better Builders in 2015. The construction company has grown into a multi-million-dollar operation and one of the best outdoor living companies in Iowa.​​\n\nJay Slight\n\nHead Principal, Northview Middle School, Ankeny Community Schools\n\nUrbandale, IA\n\nAA Liberal Arts 1991\n\nFrom his time at DMACC through a variety of educational leadership positions to his role today as principal of Northview Middle School in Ankeny, Jay Slight has always been a team player. It is that commitment to involving others in addressing challenges that has earned him a reputation as an incredible educator and administrator.\n\nJay's journey in education started on DMACC's Boone Campus. As a student and basketball player, he quickly gained the respect of his teachers, teammates, and coaches. He earned his AA degree in 1991 and then moved on to Iowa State University where he completed his BS in biology.\n\nAs a teacher, a coach – Jay returned to serve as an assistant basketball coach at DMACC between 1999 and 2001 – and an administrator, Jay has been noted for his ability to build teams that turned around struggling schools.\n\nIn 2003, shortly after completing his Master's degree in Educational Leadership at Drake, he accepted the position of Head Principal at North Nodaway Middle and High School in Hopkins, Missouri. The school was in danger of losing its accreditation from the Missouri Department of Education. In short order, Jay worked with the faculty to implement strategies that saw the school make exponential progress on its annual performance report and ensuring its continued accreditation.\n\nAs the high school principal at Creston High School in southern Iowa, Jay oversaw a significant increase in reading and math scores across the school. In addition, ACT scores hit a five year high during his tenure, exceeding the state average for the first time in school history.\n\nFrom Creston, Jay assumed the position of principal at Storm Lake Middle School in northwest Iowa, where he again oversaw an increase in reading and math scores. The school was also recognized as Commendable on the Iowa School Performance Profile.\n\nToday, as principal of Northview Middle School, Jay has been praised by his peers for his commitment to students, his vision for success and his enthusiasm for working with others to create a better environment for learning.​\n\nSteven G. Barger\n\nProgram Chair and Professor, DMACC Criminal Justice Program\n\nIndianola, IA​\n\nKnown affectionately around the Ankeny Campus as “Super Trooper,” Steven Barger is passionate about preparing the next generation of criminal justice professionals for success.\n\nAfter earning his AA degree on the Ankeny Campus in 1993, Steven enrolled in the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy. Upon completing academy, he began a career in law enforcement that included service as an Iowa State Trooper. In his time with the Iowa State Patrol, Steve was tasked with several high level assignments, including serving in the special agent division of criminal investigation, the special agent division of narcotics enforcement, and the special agent division of intelligence.\n\nHis work in intelligence led to a role on the Law Enforcement Intelligence Network where he continues to serve as a member, instructor and team leader. He has vast experience in narcotics and deep cover, participating in thousands of undercover operations over the years.\n\nIn addition to his law enforcement duties, Steven has been an invaluable member of the DMACC family as a guest speaker, adjunct, faculty member, and now chair of the department. His professional and academic pursuits combined a few years back when he was involved in a sting operation that required an undercover narcotics buy just minutes before he was due to teach a class\n\nThe consummate professional, Steve completed the buy and immediately headed to class. Still in his undercover outfit that included long hair, earrings, and a tattered biker t-shirt, it was to tell whether he was there to log into the computer or to steal it.\n\nAmong the most respected members of the DMACC family, Steven has had an immeasurable impact on hundreds of current and future members of Iowa’s law enforcement community.\n\nKatelynn E. Davis\n\nChief Pathology Resident, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine\n\nBaltimore, MD\n\nLike many DMACC students, Dr. Katelynn Davis’ educational journey took several twists and turns. And like so many others before her, she saw each challenge as an opportunity on her way to earning her AA degree on the Ankeny Campus.​​\n\nHer schooling at DMACC served as a springboard as she completed her Bachelor of Science degree at Iowa State University in 2012 and then completed her Medical degree at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in 2018. Dr. Davis now serves as the Chief Pathology Resident at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nDr. Davis credits her time at DMACC with helping her to understand that in moments when we stumble, we must pick ourselves up and give it another try. She says that she would not be the educator, mentor, curriculum developer, chief resident, or medical doctor that she is today without all those formative experiences.\n\nPulling from her time at DMACC, Dr. Davis says she gained valuable insight in working as a tutor, as she was able to see how others process information. This enabled her to adapt her teaching style to match the learner. That serves her well today in her role as Chief Pathology Resident.\n\nServing as the Wellness Chair in the Department of Pathology, she was able to apply her soft skills gained over the years to earn praise in helping residents maintain morale during the incredibly stressful early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the many initiatives she led was a system that allowed residents to continue to have their meals served during the pandemic, lending a sense of normalcy while reducing stress during a chaotic time.\n\nDr. Davis continues to make an impact at Johns Hopkins in a variety of ways including leading efforts to improve resident workspaces, increase didactic and interactive conferences, enhance communication between departments, and create a moonlighting system to reduce the impact of decreased staffing.\n\nReflecting on the twist and turns that have brought her to where she is today, Dr. Davis says that being someone who once struggled to speak up, she has found that advocating for others gives her the strength to speak loudly and confidently.\n\nDon Tate\n\nAuthor-Illustrator and Public Speaker\n\nAustin, TX\n\nThe written word in is Don Tate’s blood. The nephew of Eleanora E. Tate, a former journalist at the Des Moines Register and Tribune, and Iowa Bystander, and children’s author, Eleanora inspired Don to pursue a literary career.\n\nCalling Eleanora “the inspiration of my own career as a book creator,” Don began his literary journey on DMACC Ankeny Campus, where he earned an AA in Commercial Arts and Advertising in 1984. His journey at DMACC was nothing short of incredible as, in addition to taking classes, he had sole custody of his baby daughter, born just days after he graduated from high school. Reflecting on that time, Don remembers the challenges, but also speaks fondly of the way he was supported by his instructors and fellow students.\n\nFrom those humble beginnings, Don has developed an international reputation as an award-winning author, and the illustrator of numerous critically acclaimed books for children.\n\nIn addition to winning dozens of awards for his work, Don is also one of the founding hosts of the blog The Brown Bookshelf – a blog designed to push awareness of the myriad of African American voices writing for young readers, with book reviews, and author and illustrator interviews.\n\nDon is also a member and supporter of the We Need Diverse Books initiative, a non-profit and a grassroots organization of children’s book lovers that advocates essential changes in the publishing industry to produce and promote literature that reflects and honors the lives of all young people. He frequently speaks at schools, public libraries and writing conferences, and participates in book festivals.\n\nAn amazing ambassador for the value of a DMACC education, Don is a deserving winner of a 2021 Outstanding Alumni Award. He adds that award to the Student of the Year Award he received more than 30 years ago, earning him a special distinction as both a Student and Alumni honoree that we are not sure any other of the thousands upon thousands of students who have attended DMACC over the years can claim.\n\nJoseph Weber\n\nDirector of Youth Ministry, Prairie Ridge Church\n\nAnkeny, IA\n\nCollege wasn’t a breeze for Joseph Weber. Not sure of what direction he wanted to take, he struggled in his early years on DMACC’s Boone Campus. But with support from instructors, fellow students, and DMACC counselors, Joseph worked hard and earned his Associate’s degree in Liberal Arts on DMACC Boone Campus in 2010.\n\nUpon graduation, he felt called to serve others and became a Youth Pastor in Boone. During his seven years in that role, he tackled the struggles of his youth and worked to build relationships with students, provide encouragement, stability and guidance, and lead the next generation of parishioners.​​\n\nInspired by his work in the ministry, he returned to school, earning his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City. Today, he is the Director of Youth Ministry at Prairie Ridge Church in Ankeny where he continues to mentor and support youth and families from across the region, and participates in an international ministry that serves the less fortunate.\n\nHis roots in Boone still run deep as he was active in the community as a supporter of local schools, students and staff. Over the years, Joseph has regularly organized events like Literacy Nights, STEM Nights, Glow Stick Dances, Block Parties, and more….designed to boost pride in Boone’s schools and students. He so believes in the importance of education that he has run for the Boone School Board.\n\nLauded for his ability to see a need and activate a plan to address it, Joseph is a great ambassador for Boone and the DMACC Boone Campus, and a deserving winner of a 2021 DMACC Outstanding Alumni Award.\n\nHannah Jagler\n\nFederal Official Court Reporter, US District Court, Southern District of Illinois\n\nFairview Heights, IL\n\nConfident in the skills she built in the Realtime Reporting program on DMACC’s Newton Campus, all Hannah Jagler wanted was a chance to work in a high-profile courthouse.\n\nFor months she sent resumes to courthouses across the country hoping to catch the eye of the right person.\n\nJust as she began to get discouraged at the lack of replies, Hannah got the call that she says changed everything for her and her family. That call came from the United States District Court in the Southern District of Illinois. Based in East St. Louis, the job provided the type of opportunity that Hannah had dreamed about for her three years as a Realtime Reporter.\n\nUpon acceptance of the position, Hannah, her husband Justin and their two children, Aurora and Valerie, moved south. In her position as a Federal Official Court Reporter, Hannah prepares verbatim transcripts during federal court cases to be used by attorneys, judges and litigants. No matter the type of case, from a controversial criminal trial to a government corruption trial, in her role, Hannah must produce a complete and accurate record of the proceedings.\n\nActive in student organizations through her graduation in 2017, Hannah remains involved in a number of professional organizations today, including the National Court Reporters Association and United States Court Reporters Association. She has also earned a number of skills-based certifications and honors including being a Registered Professional Reporter, Certified Realtime Reporter, Registered Merit Reporter, and Federal Realtime Reporter.\n\nIn addition to working her dream job, Hannah enjoys spending time with her family, birding – a hobby she didn’t anticipate falling so deeply into – and roller skating. Hannah says she always has her skates with her and has even skated around a courthouse or two (with permission, of course) on her lunch breaks.\n\nHannah’s rapid rise to the federal court has been impressive and we congratulate her on a well-deserved 2021 DMACC Alumni Early Achievement Award.\n\nMohsina Mandil\n\nExecutive Assistant at Earthschooling, The BEarth Institute & President of Waldorf Books\n\nWindsor Heights, IA\n\nWhile a student on DMACC Ankeny and Urban Campuses, Mosi Mandil was introduced to research. Spurring Mosi’s interest in advocacy, the research project was part of her Introduction to Sociology honors project. Titled, “Pleading for Freedom: A Fifty State Analysis” the project’s poster presentation was included in the 2014 Iowa Sociological Association Conference, and the 2014 Minnesota Academy of Science Conference.\n\nThe experience excited Mosi and inspired her to pursue a path that has seen her publish multiple essays, participate in a range of research projects, and volunteer in a number of capacities aimed at advocating for vulnerable women.\n\nShe was a member of the honors program during her years at DMACC. Mosi earned her Associate’s degree in Liberal Arts from DMACC in 2014, her Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from the University of Iowa in 2017, and her Master’s degree in Social Work from the University of Iowa in 2021.\n\nToday, she serves as the Executive Assistant at Earthschooling and President of Waldorf Books. In her role, Mosi is an educator, college level tutor, and helps to develop the school’s international online curriculum along with the Avecina Institute curriculum. Mosi is also responsible for editing instructional videos, and providing art and research for the BEarth Institute.\n\nOutside of her work, Mosi is tireless volunteer for DMACC. While a student she was involved as a member of the Honors Program, Phi Theta Kappa, a peer tutor in the Academic Achievement Center, and as an actress/director at Huff Theater. She has maintained her DMACC connection by serving on the Honors Advisory Council, Honors Alumni Chapter Coordinator, and the Honors Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee.\n\nAmong her notable contributions to DMACC is the founding of the Honors Alumni Chapter of the DMACC Alumni Association; developing – and later evaluating – the HON100 universal shell course; organizing the Honors Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee; updating the honors webpages; planning the 2020 National Collegiate Honors Conference and the 2021 Upper Mideast Regional Honors Council Conference; and presenting at a DMACC SEMSS colloquium.\n\nWilliam Couser\n\nOwner, Couser Cattle Co.\n\nNevada, IA\n\nDiesel Mechanic Diploma 1975 – Ankeny Campus\n\nWhether it is working cattle on his family farm or spearheading one of the largest renewable energy projects Iowa has ever seen, Bill Couser has earned a reputation for doing the right things for the right reasons. A 1973 graduate of Nevada High School and a 1975 graduate of the DMACC Diesel and Heavy Equipment Repair program on the Ankeny Campus, Bill owns Couser Cattle Company and has been instrumental in the establishment of Lincoln Way Energy, a 50 million gallon ethanol plant owned by local investors.\n\nBill’s list of accomplishments is long, including induction into the Iowa Cattlemen’s Association Hall of Fame alongside his wife Nancy, a winner of the National Beef Quality Assurance Award, and recognition as the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association Environmental Stewardship Award. Much of Bill’s recognition is centered on his love for the land.\n\n“The core concept of their combined business ventures is simple,” says Dwayne Faidley, Professor and Program Co-Chair of DMACC’s Agribusiness program. Dwayne nominated Bill for the Outstanding Alumni Award. “They want to add value to what they have, replace what they use and waste as little as possible while fulfilling basic human needs.”\n\nIn supporting his nomination, Iowa Cattlemen’s Association CEO Matt Deppe lauded Bill’s impact on agriculture in Iowa.\n\n“Bill has always been on the forefront of issues in agriculture,” Matt says, “and has used his own farm to demonstrate innovations that have a positive impact on animal welfare, water quality, soil health, and sustainability. From his involvement in the ethanol industry to Beef Quality Assurance research projects, there is no aspect of the crop/cattle cycle that Bill has not positively influenced.”\n\nDespite such a rich background in agriculture – in 2010 Bill was named one of “10 People Who Matter” by Time Magazine – Bill’s proudest accomplishment has little to do with the farm.\n\n“My family!” Bill says when asked about what he is most proud of. He and his wife have two adult children, Casey and Tim. “I’m proud to have a mom and dad who supported me and a family that has been a true blessing, especially my wife. To think that she picked me is still unbelievable. I am so blessed.”\n\nRecently, the Couser’s launched the Modern Ag Experience Farm, designed to provide an immersive experience for students and farmers. Bill sees it as his opportunity to pay back all the wonderful experiences he has had in his career.\n\n“We have been so lucky to open up our farm to students and guests from around the world,” he says. “To be able to teach the ag story and bring people into the 21st century is a true gift.”\n\nJocelyn Kovarik\n\nAssistant Coach/Advisor, DMACC Boone Campus\n\nAmes, IA\n\nAS Business Administration 2007 – Boone Campus\n\nA two-time basketball All-American while at DMACC, Jocelyn Kovarik has returned to Boone Campus to pay forward her experience as a student and athlete. After a successful career on the hardwood at DMACC and then Iowa State University, Jocelyn jumped at the opportunity to return to Boone as an advisor and assistant women’s basketball coach.\n\nDMACC Provost Drew Nelson nominated Jocelyn for the Outstanding Alumni Award after watching her work with students on campus and in the gym.\n\n“I am extremely impressed with Jocelyn in her roles as advisor, coach and mentor,” Drew says. “She is terrific in reaching students. She makes the effort to get to know them as people and to know their goals, their strengths and their weaknesses, and she works with them to help them achieve their objectives.”\n\nJocelyn completed her studies at DMACC in 2007, graduating with an Associate of Science degree in Business Administration. She then attended Iowa State University, where she played basketball and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance. Jocelyn then earned her Master’s degree in Education with an emphasis in Higher Education in at Iowa State in 2016.\n\nWhile she has competed at the highest level in college athletics and has been an incredible addition to Boone Campus, Jocelyn says her greatest accomplishment has nothing to do with competition.\n\n“I am most proud of our 18 month old daughter,” Jocelyn says. She and husband Jeremiah—also a DMACC Boone Campus graduate—welcomed Paisley in 2018. “I am also proud to hold the career blocks record at DMACC and the single season blocks record at Iowa State.”\n\n“We are privileged to have her working on Boone Campus,” Drew adds. “She is our alumna and every day she makes a positive impact.”\n\nScott Ocken\n\nRetired, DMACC Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean, Industry and Technology\n\nAnkeny, IA\n\nAAS Auto Technology attended 1975-1977 but was awarded in 1991 – Ankeny Campus\n\nFew have had more of an influence on automotive technicians in Central Iowa than Scott Ocken. A graduate of the DMACC Auto Technology program on the Ankeny Campus, Scott served as the Vice President for Academic Affairs in the Industry and Technology program for years before recently retiring.\n\nIn his leadership role, he was instrumental in helping the Automotive Technology program—along with several others—grow to better serve employers in the region. The DMACC Automotive Technology program is recognized as one of the best in the Midwest and has turned out hundreds of automotive technicians currently working in Iowa.\n\n“Scott provided leadership to our programs and support us in advocating for students across the college and within the community,” says Megan Snook-Lautner, a Pathway Navigator in Industry & Technology at DMACC, in support of Scott’s nomination for the Outstanding Alumni Award. “His unique perspective as a graduate from this area also brought a valuable voice to discussions and strategies when looking at recruitment and retention efforts.”\n\nIn addition to having a meaningful impact on students, Scott has left a lasting impression on his coworkers.\n\n“Scott took it upon himself to provide exceptional support and service to all faculty and staff,” says Industry & Technology Coordinator Megan Ellsworth. “In my experience with Scott, he was always willing to pitch in during times of need, especially if it involved student success. I have never met someone so student focused.”\n\nEven in retirement, Scott’s passion for pushing students to new heights remains.\n\n“While many of us only knew Scott in his roles as Academic Dean and Vice President of Academic Affairs, his regular actions across campus demonstrated that the titles of ‘student’ and ‘graduate’ are some of his proudest positions,” Snook-Lautner says. “His impact on our college and community as a graduate and leader will be visible for years to come.”\n\nTaufeek Shah\n\nCEO/Founder, Lola’s Fine Hot Sauce\n\nWest Des Moines, IA\n\nAA Liberal Arts 2008 – Ankeny Campus\n\nWith a pinch of innovation, a dash of marketing acumen and a heaping helping of hard work, Taufeek Shah has turned a family recipe into an international brand. The Founder and CEO of Lola’s Fine Hot Sauces, Taufeek graduated from DMACC with a Liberal Arts degree in 2008. Today, his hot sauce is enjoyed around the world.\n\nTaufeek says entrepreneurialism is in his blood.\n\n“When I was 13 years old, I decided to be a daredevil and ramp off a six-foot high loading dock on my mountain bike,” he says. “I fell face-first and wound up in the hospital for three months. I was lucky to survive and that experience pushed me to launch my first entrepreneurial stunt.”\n\nThat stunt was selling “fancy pens” that his mother, a physician, would receive from drug company reps. From there he branched out into selling baseball cards and launching his first eBay store at age 15. He says this experience continues to help him to this day.\n\n“I have a passion for helping and a passion for delivering quality,” Taufeek says. “All of this combines together with my passion for food and family to lead me to where I am with the Lola’s brand.”\n\nIn addition to creating seven different hot sauces, five flavors of salsa and a bloody mary mix under the Lola’s brand, Taufeek has also been instrumental in helping launch the first Filipino fusion restaurant in Iowa. The eatery was recently recognized as one of the Top 25 Filipino restaurants in the United States.\n\nIn nominating him for the Outstanding Alumni Award, Chris Wood, Chief Development Officer of Make-A-Wish Iowa, cites Taufeek’s passion to pitch in … and partner.\n\n“He donates his product and time to support local missions that align with his philanthropic passions,” Chris says. “One of my favorite attributes of Taufeek is his desire to constantly find partnership opportunities and develop collaborations and initiatives with other small business owners. He always finds ways to be actively involved in all that is going on in Central Iowa.”\n\nIn addition to serving Make-A-Wish, Taufeek volunteers for Goodwill of Central Iowa and is a member of the Board at Proteus. Totally on brand, Taufeek’s partnership with Goodwill is pushing two businesses forward.\n\n“Taufeek decided to work with Goodwill to provide warehousing and fulfillment for Lola’s,” says Eric Prosperi, Director of Commercial Services at Goodwill of Central Iowa. “We warehouse the product and our program participants help pick, pack and ship eCommerce and other customer orders. Our participants gain valuable work experiencing, and a paycheck and other support to prepare them for a full-time job in warehouse packaging and logistics.”\n\nHaving the opportunity to work so closely with Taufeek has helped shape Eric’s perception of DMACC as well.\n\n“It’s clear that Taufeek’s passion for business and commitment to his community is more than just a flash in the pan,” he says. “This guy is going places and DMACC was a step on the road worth celebrating!”\n\nTiffany Allison\n\nFounder/Executive Director, Soaring Hearts Foundation\n\nDes Moines, IA\n\nAA Criminal Justice 2014 – Ankeny Campus\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Tiffany Allison’s life took a dramatic turn at the hands of an abusive boyfriend.\n\nThe attack, which occurred in 2009, sparked a passion in Tiffany for advocacy. Today she is recognized regionally as a violent crimes victim advocate and the founder of Soaring Hearts Foundation.\n\nSoaring Hearts Foundation was launched in 2014 while Tiffany was a student in the DMACC Criminal Justice Program on the Ankeny Campus. The foundation, which is led by Tiffany and includes a staff of five, advocates for victims of violent crime from coast to coast by drafting and lobbying for legislation, providing speakers, raising awareness of topics like veteran suicide, financially supporting grassroots advocacy efforts, and more.\n\nTiffany earned her Associate’s Degree from DMACC in 2015, and a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice and Mass Media Journalism from Simpson College in 2019. In addition to her work in the foundation, Tiffany is a Licensed Investigator and founder of investigation firm Lux Legal Services. She is also a licensed bail agent.\n\nHer commitment to advocacy has resulted in well-deserved recognition both locally and nationally. Tiffany earned the AllState Foundation Purple Heart Award in 2017, the Polk County Crisis & Advocacy Wayne McCracken Memorial Award in 2016, and the Crime Fighter Award for Community Services in 2015. In nominating her for the Alumni Early Achievement Award, DMACC Criminal Justice Professor Samantha O’Hara, PhD, lauds Tiffany’s work in the community.\n\n“Tiffany has provided a great deal of service to the Des Moines area,” Samantha says. “Tiffany was a member of the Iowa Attorney General’s Office, Crime Victim Division’s biennial Victim Justice planning committee for several years. She provides a voice from a victim’s perspective, to ensure that conferences continue to be victim-centered and empowering.”\n\nPolk County Crisis & Advocacy Services Counselor/Advocate Jason Hubbartt echoes Samantha’s sentiment.\n\n“Tiffany has taken her victimization and turned it into a strength to help others overcome their challenges,” he says. “I greatly admire Tiffany’s commitment to the field of criminology, victimology, and trauma psychology as she helps local citizens through their traumatic situations and court-related proceedings.”\n\nProviding a sense of empowerment is important to Tiffany in her work with the foundation. She says the ability to help others has aided her in processing her own trauma.\n\n“Now instead of crying when I tell my story, I get to cry when I am told how it changed a life,” she says. Tiffany continues to assist in hosting DMACC’s National Crime Victims’ Week activities. “This has truly been a bittersweet journey. I am forever changed. I am so fortunate to be able to impact the lives of others, all while partnering with some of the most passionate and driven people in the world.”\n\nErica S. Carrick\n\nDirector of Nursing, Primary Health Care Inc.\n\nUrbandale, IA\n\nDiploma Practical Nursing 2016; AAS Nursing 2017 – Urban Campus\n\n\"I am thankful and grateful for this award. This was very unexpected and I feel so appreciated that my former instructor Amanda Tollari took the time to recognize my achievements. My nursing education has provided a strong foundation for me and I can't say enough about the nursing program. The instructors, Amanda Tollari and Kris Bush to name a couple were instrumental in my success along with my classmates' success. These instructors challenged our growth through asking the \"whys\" and truly understanding the nursing process. It was through this program that I have continued to have success in my career. DMACC should be so proud of this program and the continued impact each graduate makes on so many levels. I am honored and blessed to be a DMACC nursing student graduate and alumni.\"​\n\nEven with a Bachelor’s Degree in Sociology from the University of Northern Iowa and a Master’s Degree in Public Health from Des Moines University already on her resume, Erica Carrick longed for more fulfillment in her career. With a passion for caring for others, she sought an opportunity to get closer to the bedside by enrolling in the evening/part-time Nursing program at DMACC Urban Campus.\n\nErica, who now serves as the Director of Nursing at Primary Health Care in Des Moines and occasionally picks up shifts as a nurse at Broadlawns Medical Center, says earning her nursing degree was a proud moment that has allowed her to fulfill her passion for serving others.\n\n“One of my greatest accomplishments was completing the DMACC nursing program as a busy mom of two children and working full-time in an administrative career,” Erica says. “During my time at DMACC, I constantly found creative ways to study and brought books wherever I was. My children could have passed at least a few of the exam questions through my nursing education!”\n\nDuring her time on Urban Campus, Erica left a lasting impression on staff and students. In nominating her for the Alumni Early Achievement Award, instructor Amanda Tollari, RN, MSN, says Erica’s involvement in extracurricular activities was laudable.\n\n“Erica was an excellent student who was very involved in starting the nursing club AUSNA (Ankeny Urban Student Nurses Association),” Amanda says. “As an alumna, Erica has continued to partner with AUSNA on various projects. She remembered the unique needs of AUSNA and assisted with service projects after she graduated. She has volunteered her time to come in and be part of a professional development panel and answer questions from current students.”\n\nErica says that giving back helps her continue to move forward.\n\n“Since graduation I have never stopped learning or growing,” she says. “My time at DMACC regularly reminds me of my favorite Thomas Edison quote: ‘Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work’.”\n\nTo a person, those in the Nursing Program at DMACC remember Erica as one who never passes up an opportunity.\n\n“She has been a nursing advocate for our part-time program and resource options for the working adult returning to school,” says Dr. Kendra Ericson, DMACC Director of Nursing. “Her leadership skills an innovative thinking have proven invaluable within our nursing programs.”\n\n“It is fairly unusual for someone who recently graduated from nursing school to secure a position like Erica’s with so much responsibility,” DMACC Nursing instructor Steve Orazem, RN, MSN, NE-BC adds. “Erica is certainly a graduate that DMACC can be proud of.”\n\nNic Barrick\n\nHead of Design and Innovation, All Square Cabinet Co.\n\nJohnston, IA\n\nAttended DMACC Ankeny Campus for 57 credit hours\n\nNic Barrick is the first to tell others that his time at DMACC was instrumental in his success. It was his coursework in CAD—which was cut short by a pair of open heart surgeries—that laid the groundwork for his ascension into a leadership role as the Head of Design and Innovation at All Square Cabinet Co. in Indianola.\n\n“Nic naturally fosters an environment of curiosity, synthesized with a strategy to maximize the company in a way that will allow it to adapt, grow and realize future opportunities,” says his wife, Kelly, in supporting Nic’s nomination for the Impact Award. “Initially, his education in CAD at DMACC helped him start his journey designing residential kitchens. Then in the downturn of housing he moved on to structural steel tower manufacturing for agriculture projects. Now he is manufacturing commercial cabinetry. His professional accomplishments speak to the impact he has had utilizing his capabilities in these unique industries.”\n\nNic’s combination of technical skills and positive disposition pushed his current employer to go the extra mile to bring him onto the team.\n\n“I aggressively recruited Nic to AllSquare,” says company President Brad Warren in supporting Nic’s nomination. “He hit the ground running in improving day-to-day tasks. But knowing that he is always looking for a new challenge, I have had him partner with me on a number of strategic initiatives to position the company for further growth.”\n\nAmong those initiatives are steering the rebrand of the business to improve its perception in the market, leading the implementation of a new design and fabrication software, and assuming the lead role in researching and integrating a new residential line of cabinetry that will open AllSquare to new markets.\n\nWhile the professional accomplishments are nice, Nic says it is a recent side project that has brought him the most satisfaction.\n\nIn 2018, Nic spent six months organizing a class from Base Camp Iowa, a program that gathers a dozen junior high students for a week to work together on an intensive, hands-on project. Nic supported the group as they built a wind turbine to power a compressor that provides free energy to Summit Product’s 70,000 square foot manufacturing facility.\n\n“How cool is that?” Nic says of the project. “Being a part of Base Camp Iowa is one of my greatest accomplishments.”\n\n“He has a huge heart for bringing out the best in people,” says former coworker Larry Stayner in supporting Nic’s nomination. “I highly recommend him for this award.”"
