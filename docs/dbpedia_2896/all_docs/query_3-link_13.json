        "text": "Records, until broken, withstand the test of time. On the left is a 5’7” guard who played at Francis Marion during a time where women’s college basketball was played under the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). During her collegiate career, Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Pearl Moore scored 4061pts. After big-named schools moved to the NCAA in the early 1980s and a federal antitrust lawsuit, the AIAW dissolved, but their records never died. In the NCAA, Caitlin Clark stands alone at the top of points scored. While what Clark has done in the women’s game is impressive, we cannot yet say that she owns the all-time record in women’s college basketball history. That,still, belongs to Pearl Moore; a record that is 45 years old.

COMMENT BELOW #linkedinsports #sportsbiz #sportsbusiness\n\nJohn Carroll University's momentum continues with a new era for athletics: The Blue Streaks will join the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC) in Fall 2025. “At John Carroll, students can pursue excellence in the classroom and on the playing field without sacrificing one for the other,” said Director of Athletics Brian Polian ‘97. “We work everyday to attract the type of student who wants an exceptional Jesuit education and who wants to compete at the highest level of Division III athletics. We believe that joining the NCAC aligns John Carroll with peer institutions that share a common mission and that attract students from across the country.” Read more at https://lnkd.in/gcNkKSXv"
