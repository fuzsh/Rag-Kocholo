He was based in South Africa from 1985 to 1987, where he documented the country under Apartheid rule. He has been a dear friend of the Mandela family for the last thirty years and photographed Nelson Mandela and the South African struggle over these last three decades. He was based in Paris from 1987 to 1997, covering such events as the Persian Gulf War, revolutions in Eastern Europe, student uprisings in China, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe has published seven books of his photographic work including his last, Mandela: In Times of Struggle and Triumph, from his extensive time over the last twenty-five years photographing the evolution of South Africa, and Nelson Mandela and his family.\n\nDavid has Directed and Produced three feature-length Documentaries.
