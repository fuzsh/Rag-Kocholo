        "text": "The Jackson County CEO program has gotten off to a great start. This is good news because the CEO stands for Creating Entrepreneurial Opportunities. The goal of this class is to give these high school Juniors and Seniors hands on experiences creating their own small business. Being facilitated by Ken Stoner, an employee of the Southern Illinois Small Business Development Center (SBDC), there have been numerous opportunities for the students to interact with business leaders discussing various points as the students struggle to developing their own business plan. Developing the future business leaders today is essential to promote growth in our region.\n\nAimee Wigfall, a small business owner and a business coach for the SBDC, was a speaker at a recent class. She went through the step-by-step business plan workbook that the SBDC has to support those looking into developing their ideas into a viable business. She stressed the importance of the executive summary being brief (while including all relevant facts as to why your business is necessary) as well as the importance of your financial projections of costs and revenue to be as realistic as possible. Explaining these are the two main areas a banker will review prior to securing a business loan underlined the importance of this plan. This brief overview of the step-by-step guide can be thought of as an introduction to all the areas these students will study; such as the different descriptions of businesses and their legal benefits or liabilities, setting up operations (insurance, employees etc) and selecting a location, marketing the business, as well as general accounting principals.\n\nThis class is non-traditional meaning more than just it doesn’t teach from a textbook. The class begins at 7:30 and extends to include the first period class at their high school. They meet off site visiting places like the SBDC’s Dunn-richmond building to hear speakers like Aimee Wigfall to meeting in an actual business conference room such as The Southern Illinoisan. Tim Marston, a senior from Murphysboro High School stated that “The class has been very beneficial from learning how to present ourselves professionally and communicating clearly to planning the smallest details of an event.” As a hopeful future small business owner he has been excited to be part of this class.\n\nMurphysboro Community Unit School District 186 has updated their Board Policy 7:180. To read the full policy you can find it online on the District Website under Board of Education. However the changes follow the “cyber bullying” law passed last year in the State.\n\nBullying can be summed up as any severe or pervasive physical or verbal act or conduct directed toward a student that has or could have the effect including; placing the student in reasonable fear of harm, causing a substantially detrimental effect on the student’s physical or mental health, substantially interfering with their academic performance, or substantially interfering with their ability to participate in the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.\n\nBullying has not been and will not be tolerated in our district or at our schools. The new policies change expands our ability to deal with these issues. In the past, we were able to deal with bullying that occurred within our buildings. Now, we are able to deal with bullying that occurs through “on-line” means. Cyber bullying means bullying through the use of technology or any electronic communication. With Cell phones and the increased use of Facebook, Instagram, etc., we have seen an increase in bullying behavior. It is safe to say that almost all of our fights that have occurred began with an argument or comments made on-line. The new law, and our new policy now allows us to deal with the comments made by students to students through these electronic means. In other words, if a student is being harassed by another individual on-line they can report this behavior to the administration and consequences for these on-line comments can occur.\n\nThe world is a different place than when I grew up. If I was having issues with my friends, or having a bad day, I could go home and not be bothered. Today, students don’t have a safe haven unless they separate themselves from their phone. I strongly urge parents to have rules in their homes such as individuals cell phones don’t go into their bedrooms. I strongly urge parents to monitor and review their students’ social media accounts to see what they are saying and what is being said to them. I strongly urge parents to control/supervise/monitor their students’ behavior in the on-line communities as they do within the real world. And finally I strongly urge parents and students to report any incidences of bullying to the schools. Anonymous reports will also be accepted and investigated."
