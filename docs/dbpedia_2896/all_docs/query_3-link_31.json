        "text": "WACO, TEX.—Carson-Newman quarterbacks coach David Needs has been named the American Football Coaches Association Division II Assistant Coach of the Year, the AFCA announced Wednesday morning.\n\nNeeds is in his 14th season at Carson-Newman, and 17th season overall. He also played quarterback at C-N, and was a part of the 1988 and ’89 National Championships. He has been a part of 10 South Atlantic Conference titles and three national championship games while on Sparks’ staff. In addition to his football responsibilities, Needs serves as head men’s and women’s track coach at his alma mater. He joins Eagle offensive coordinator Mike Turner as the two Eagles coaches which have received the award. Turner earned the honor in 2003 after a half-decade of record-setting seasons.\n\n“ I am blessed to work at a college like Carson-Newman these past 14 years and counting,” Needs said. “Carson-Newman is an institution that encourages you to impact not only the lives of those who attend, but make an impact in our community. Men like Ken Sparks, Mike Turner, and this entire coaching staff, are men that have trusted you, encouraged you, given you significant responsibility, and, most importantly, taught you to coach the outside and inside of a player first and foremost. They’ve created a contagious, positive atmosphere at C-N, and I’m blessed to be a part of it.”\n\nNeeds’ involvement off the field through the years has been equally successful and productive as Carson-Newman’s longstanding success on the field. He is heavily involved in the Carson-Newman and Jefferson City communities, working a free, week-long camp at Manley Baptist Church for school-age children, teaching them how to run and play football. He is also an advisor for Mortar Board Senior Honor Society at Carson-Newman, and has helped with many service projects such as teddy bears for sick children, visiting senior homes and shut-ins and reading to children at various elementary schools. Each fall, he leads and sponsors the “Cereal Bowl,” a charity flag football game between redshirt football players and faculty which has raised thousands of dollars and thousands of boxes of cereal for needy families.\n\n“David is Carson-Newman through and through,” Carson-Newman athletics director David Barger said. “He is a tremendous football and track and field coach, and works tirelessly at both. He is also thoroughly committed to our campus and local communities. He is the type of person that makes Carson-Newman what it is.”\n\nOn the field, Needs’ quarterbacks have been pretty “Good” as well.\n\nThe Wilmington, Del. Native has mentored Eagle senior quarterback and South Atlantic Conference Player of the Year Alex Good for the last four seasons. Good has steered the Eagles to three-straight South Atlantic Conference titles and back-to-back NCAA Playoff appearances, including a first-round bye this season, their first since the format change in 2004. C-N has finished first or second nationally in each of the last three seasons in rushing offense, including first last season. This season, the Eagles are averaging 354.7 rushing yards per game, just .7 yards behind the highest per-game rushing total in the last 15 seasons at the D-II level.\n\nIn October, Good became the school’s all-time leader in total offense, surpassing 7,000 career yards, as well as setting the school record for TD passes, with 45. He is also the only C-N quarterback in the school’s top-ten list of career rushers. He has 2,848 career rushing yards and 37 rushing TDs.\n\n“To work with Alex Good the past four years and see him mature and develop as a person, a player, and a leader on and off the football field I know I am blessed,” Needs said. “He continues to re-write record books at Carson-Newman, and does so with great humility. He cares more for team than any personal glory, that is why he is the conference player of the year and a strong candidate for the Harlon Hill Award.”\n\nGood and the Eagles begin their 2009 postseason on Saturday, when Carson-Newman hosts West Alabama in the second round of the NCAA Playoffs.\n\nNeeds served as C-N’s wide receivers coach for his first 10 seasons at Mossy Creek. He coached All-American Quez Rumph, as well as record-setting receiver, and current Eagle assistant Alvin Sanders. Sanders is one of over two-dozen Eagles who Needs has coached, that have gone on to have careers in teaching and coaching.\n\n-C-N-\n\nEach year, staff representatives from NCAA and NAIA football-playing schools are asked to nominate an assistant for consideration. From those nominations, a winner is selected by the AFCA Public Relations Committee. The winners of this award were selected from Football Bowl Subdivision, Football Championship Subdivision, Divisions II, III and the NAIA.\n\nThe Assistant Coach of the Year award was first presented in 1997 and was created to honor assistant coaches who excel in community service, commitment to the student-athlete, on-field coaching success and AFCA professional organization involvement.\n\nThe 2009 honorees are as follows: Football Bowl Subdivision–Mike MacIntyre, Defensive Coordinator, Duke University; Football Championship Subdivision–Mark Speir, Defensive Ends Coach & Recruiting Coordinator, Appalachian State University; Division II–David Needs, Quarterbacks Coach, Carson-Newman College; Division III–Jeff Thomas, Offensive Coordinator & Quarterbacks Coach, University of Redlands; and NAIA–Josh Gehring, Offensive Coordinator, Morningside College.\n\n“Once again, five outstanding assistant coaches have been selected for their dedication, not only to their teams, but to their communities,” said Executive Director Grant Teaff. “Often times, the head coach receives much of the credit for his team’s success, but any head coach is only as good as his assistants. Much of an assistant coach’s work is done behind the scenes. It is our pleasure to bring it to the forefront.”\n\nThe criteria for the award is not limited to on-field coaching ability or the success of the team and players that these assistant coaches work with. Service to the community through charitable work and other volunteer activities, participation in AFCA activities and events, participation in other professional organizations and impact on student-athletes are all taken into account in the selection process.\n\nWinners of the Assistant Coach of the Year Award will receive a plaque to commemorate the award and an educational stipend to attend the 2011 AFCA Convention or another professional development clinic/convention of their choice. They will be honored at the AFCA Kickoff Luncheon, Monday, January 11 at the 2010 AFCA Convention in Orlando, Fla.\n\nThe AFCA was founded in 1922 and currently has more than 10,000 members around the world, ranging from the high school level to the professional ranks. According to its constitution, the AFCA was formed, in part, to “maintain the highest possible standards in football and the coaching profession” and to “provide a forum for the discussion and study of all matters pertaining to football and coaching.”\n\nAFCA Assistant Coach of the Year Finalists for 2009\n\nFootball Bowl Subdivision\n\nMike MacIntyre, Duke\n\nTyrone Nix, Mississippi\n\nEd Warinner, Kansas\n\nFootball Championship Subdivision\n\nMark Hendrickson, Western Illinois\n\nJohn Revere, Eastern Kentucky\n\nMark Speir, Appalachian State\n\nDivision II\n\nBrenton Illum, Western State\n\nRalph Isernia, Charleston\n\nDavid Needs, Carson-Newman\n\nDivision III\n\nBuck Buchanan, Louisiana College\n\nChris Rusiewicz, Ursinus\n\nJeff Thomas, Redlands\n\nNAIA\n\nJosh Gehring, Morningside\n\nDewey Lusk, Virginia-Wise\n\nDoug Schleeman, Montana Tech\n\nAssistant Coach of the Year Notes\n\nSixty-five assistant coaches from 53 different schools have been honored by the AFCA since the inception of the award in 1997 ...
