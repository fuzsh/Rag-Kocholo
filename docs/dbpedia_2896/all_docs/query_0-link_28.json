        "text": "PHILIP J. HANLON PROVOST AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS 3074 FLEMING ADMINISTRATION BUILDING 503 THOMPSON STREET ANN ARBOR, MI 48109-1340 <strong>Honored</strong> <strong>Students</strong> <strong>Honored</strong> <strong>Faculty</strong> <strong>Faculty</strong> <strong>Colleagues</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Friends</strong> of the University It is a pleasure to welcome you to the 88th University of Michigan Honors Convocation. On behalf of the academic leaders on the Ann Arbor, Dearborn, <strong>and</strong> Flint campuses, I thank you for joining us today. The Honors Convocation provides us with the opportunity to recognize <strong>and</strong> celebrate the outst<strong>and</strong>ing academic achievements of undergraduate students from all three of our campuses. It is one of my favorite events each year <strong>and</strong> has become an important University tradition. Today we honor students who exemplify academic excellence, committed <strong>and</strong> creative leadership, <strong>and</strong> thoughtful service – all core values of the University. These students have demonstrated a passion for learning – challenging themselves <strong>and</strong> their teachers with tough questions <strong>and</strong> innovative ideas that stretch the boundaries of knowledge <strong>and</strong> open new pathways for exploration. The University’s mission statement states our commitment to “developing leaders who will challenge the present <strong>and</strong> enrich the future.” The students we honor today give life to that commitment through their purposeful engagement with the world. Today we also honor a group of distinguished faculty members who have joined us for this ceremony. Recently recognized by the University for their outst<strong>and</strong>ing teaching <strong>and</strong> scholarship, they represent the many individuals in our community who inspire, challenge, <strong>and</strong> support our students. As we congratulate our students, we also recognize, with deep appreciation, the parents, family members, <strong>and</strong> friends who have nurtured <strong>and</strong> supported these remarkable students. The University of Michigan shares the pride you feel in their accomplishments. With you, we look forward to the contributions they will make to the future. Congratulations <strong>and</strong> Welcome! Phil Hanlon"
