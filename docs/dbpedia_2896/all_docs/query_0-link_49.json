        "text": "The college admission process is hard and overwhelming. And this hasnâ€™t changed from when I was a high school student applying to colleges 20 years ago to being a college counselor for over 15 years. The truth is that students and their families need as much support to successfully navigate through the system to make the process easier and less stressful. My experience in high school was what drew me into college advising. I graduated from UCLA with my B.A. in Psychology. As a new college graduate, I knew I wanted to help students transition to college more smoothly than I did after I graduated as salutatorian of my high school class. Although I had migrated to the U.S. in the 5th grade, I was clueless about the college admission process in high school. My parents as immigrants spoke highly of education being the pathway to freedom but were also unfamiliar with the college process in the U.S. It wasnâ€™t until the 11th grade when I overheard my classmates talking about applying to their ideal colleges and taking the SAT and ACT exams that I found out that you had to apply to college before you could be accepted. This led to visiting my college counselor for the first time and spending sleepless nights studying for the SAT, writing personal statements and essays for scholarships like the Gates Millennium Scholarship. I ended up applying to UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Santa Cruz, UC Irvine, Cal State Northridge, and Cal State Los Angeles and got accepted to all of them to my surprise. I also got the Gates Millennium Scholarship! I have worked with students who have received admissions to the UCs, USC, LMU, Boston University, Stanford, Chapman University, American University, Pomona College majoring in the Arts and Humanities, Business, Finance, Public Health, Biology, Chemistry, Pre-Med, Computer Science, and Engineering, to name a few. I am passionate about supporting students through the college admission process and helping them to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Besides having academic rigor, I love helping students identify their strengths and illuminate the uniqueness of who they are and their story.\n\nDuring my college search, I was focused on finding a college that was social justice minded and nurtured a culture of community service. From my very first visit to Brandeis Universityâ€™s campus, I was in love with the school. I chose to attend Brandeis and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Education Studies and Hispanic Studies. While at Brandeis, I ran a volunteer tutoring program, was the staff team leader for the Intercultural Center and studied abroad in Barcelona. After working for several years, I attended Sage Graduate School and earned a Master of Science degree in Professional School Counseling. Early on in my professional career, I took a job at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) as an Admissions Counselor and was promoted a couple of years later to Assistant Director of Admissions. While at RPI, I gained a deep expertise in college admissions, especially STEM admissions, and advised students from all over the country and the world (though my primary territory was New Jersey- shout out to New Jersey!). I reviewed over 1500 applications annually from a wide range of majors, but many of the applications were for engineering and computer science. As the liaison to the School of Architecture, I led the committee review process for all architecture applications. I also worked with students pursuing Division 1 and Division 3 athletics, ROTC and accelerated programs in medicine or law. After graduating with my Masterâ€™s in 2020, I worked as a school counselor at a diverse suburban high school in Upstate New York. In this role, I worked with students regularly on all aspects of the college process from building the college list to applying for scholarships and interpreting financial aid letters. I served on a scholarship committee, wrote letters of recommendation and edited essays. I am highly acquainted with Naviance, so I can support students who attend Naviance high schools with application logistics. Recently, I launched a new phased of my career and now work as an Independent Educational Consultant full-time. That means my full-time focus is on supporting students on navigating their path to college. In my work as an at CollegeAdvisor.com, I see you as a whole person and acknowledge that the college application process is only one aspect of your complex and busy life. I believe that the college application process should be enriching, and you should gain knowledge, skills and self-awareness that you can carry with you to college and beyond. I look forward to supporting you in this exciting journey as you launch this next chapter of your life!\n\nCollege counseling started as a college major, but I quickly found it to be my true passion. It has become my calling. Over the past twenty years, I have counseled hundreds of students into their college fit. My students have received offers to the most competitive colleges in the USA, UK, Canada, and abroad. I am well-versed in the application process and essay writing. My journey into college counseling has taken me to Canada, the UK, the USA, Italy, China, and The Middle East. I graduated from Howard University, and my instructors were the first of their generation to receive degrees; they were my mentors and pioneers in their respective fields! But it was during my time at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, UNECA I realized the power of education. I worked in Ethiopia on a fellowship to eliminate Female Genital Mutilation, FGM. That experience changed my career trajectory and put female issues at the center of my work. It was then I realized the power of educating girls. When I visited The Hamlin Fistula Hospital, I met an Oromo woman with the most exciting story. Years ago, she was brought to a hospital by her father and of no use to her husband. She was in labor for almost a full day and lost her child. The fetus stuck inside her, and in the process, she permanently damaged her womb. She could no longer have children, which was the only purpose she saw for herself then. A visiting team from the US-sponsored her to attend college, and she eventually received her nursing degree. Now she is a permanent fixture at The Hamlin Hospital as a head nurse and spends her spare time educating other women and family members. The most significant transformation happened with her immediate family, her father, mother, brother, and sisters all benefited from her education. When you educate a woman, you educate a family. That was when I saw the power of education, and I knew I needed to empower people through the power of college counseling. At the core of my work is a deep appreciation of the uniqueness of each student and embracing the fact that every student's path is particular to them. I want my clients to know who they are and understand why they like what they like so they can choose programs that resonate with their personalities. Yes, I am a dreamer, pragmatist, and skilled strategist. My experiences have fine-tuned these skills I have gained through education, travel, life, color, understanding all the nuances and idiosyncrasies of cultures, and turning students' lives into stories that whet the appetite of college admissions representatives. The college application requires a lot of reflection on experiences and lessons learned and knowing success and challenges. My work with my clients is about unleashing their passion and helping them find themselves as they discover their universities of choice. I am pleased that the college counseling process is becoming more inclusive as we elevate student voices. As I enter my 24th year of college counseling, I desire to partner with students and their families to help them find their best match. Professionally I have visited universities in the UK, Canada, China, Australia, South Korea, the USA, and South America. I am familiar with curricula from IB, AP, IGCSE, and Canadian, and others as well. I am a full-time Director of College Counseling at a private independent school. This work is crucial for understanding the daily influences that impact students, domestically and internationally. I am committed to working on issues of equity and inclusivity with all communities. I am part of an extensive People of Color college counseling community; they are essential to my existence. This community has given me wise counsel, support, and a sense of belonging. I remain a student of life and will never stop learning.\n\nI am a proud first-generation college graduate and professional who aspires to fight for educational equity. I hold my B.S. from The University of Texas at Austin and fell in love with working with students during my first work-study job on campus. I graduated in 2012 and became a college advisor for The College Advising Corps where I supported students in college admissions at high school in Austin, TX. I then joined Teach for America and became a 7th grade and 8th grade math Teacher where I continued to develop a passion for developing youth and supporting student success initiatives. I taught for two years and later joined an organization that allowed me to enhance my college access and success expertise. I became a program manager for a program called EMERGE that focuses on admissions to private and Ivy League schools. With this program I successfully supported students throughout the entire application cycle. My students have been accepted to colleges/universities such as: Harvard, Dartmouth, Amherst, Bowdoin, Northeastern, USC, UCLA, Rice University, Franklin and Marshall and many more!!! I know hundreds of institutions by memory, and can recite their location, strengths, and what their financial package may look like based on your family's income. I wanted to continue to develop as a leader and attended my alma mater, The University of Texas for my master's degree in Human Dimensions of Organizations. After working in Texas for six years, I moved to Los Angeles where I managed a mentorship program called AMP that supported college students at: UCLA, UC-Irvine, UC-Merced, UC-Riverside and other campuses in the region. In this role I managed a team that supported college success initiatives on campuses throughout So-Cal. In this role I developed expertise on what it takes to thrive once you are on the college campus. I then transitioned to the SF Bay Area to support my partner as she transitioned into law school and became an Associate Director of College and Career Counseling where I continued to support high school students in college admissions. My students were accepted to all 9 UC campuses, Harvard, Middlebury, Scripps, and USC. I helped secure the first Harvard admission ever on our campus. Within a year, I was promoted to Director of College and Career Counseling where I now manage all initiatives pertaining to college access in my network and ensure that our students are on target to graduate. I have a deep passion for developing and coaching young adults. I treat you with the respect and care that you deserve because I know how hard this process is. With more than a decade of experience I truly understand the admission game and what it takes to get to your desired college. I am an expert in crafting and developing personal statements. I am an expert in the Common APP, and other platforms such as ApplyTexas, The Coalition App, and The UC App. I am an expert in coaching and guiding you towards selecting your major based on your passions and interests. I have a deep understanding of utilizing your interests in STEM or Humanities to get you access to specialized programs at colleges and universities throughout the country. I care deeply about this work because I was a student that needed a lot of support but did not receive it. I experienced a great deal of trauma and learned to navigate a system that was unfamiliar to me. In this work I care to learn more about you and why you want to attend specific colleges and universities. My students are my priority because I know how life-changing this work is. With me, you'll know that you'll have someone in your corner. As we embark on this journey together, I want you to know that 1.) We will have a good time, because the work is hard, but we should be able to smile along the way. I'm a big goofball! 2.) I will help you establish a balanced college list based on your academic and extracurricular profile. 3.) We will extract the experiences to create a personal statement that is special to you. 4.) You will have support and access to me along the journey as my priority is to ensure you always support. Applying to college can be stressful, however we will get through this together and grow along the way.\n\nI look forward to seeing your acceptance videos!\n\nI graduated in 2018 with my B.S. degree in neuroscience from UCLA with departmental honors. I worked as a peer counselor helping STEM students with their admissions applications and essays to research universities. I led workshops on research opportunities, internships, and how to succeed as a STEM major. I also completed a senior thesis project using MRI brain scans to analyze how the brain responds to treatments for depression. This ignited a love for medical research and I worked for two years on research projects at UCLA studying early brain markers for autism in infants younger than three. This work has been published in major neuroscience research journals. I decided to become an academic counselor because I wanted to use my passion for education to help students achieve their educational and career goals. I love helping STEM students because I relate to their excitement for finding new ways to make the world a better place by using research, technology, and science. I am dedicated to helping future doctors, scientists, engineers, and researchers. As an academic counselor I have helped students on their Common App and University of California (UC) applications, admissions essays, and advised them on internship, volunteer, and research opportunities. Students who I have worked with have received admissions offers from University of Miami, Loyola Marymount University, and many UC schools. Iâ€™ve also read scholarship and admissions essays for UCLA as an alumni volunteer. I love being a college advisor because it is such a joy to sit alongside students as they grow, learn, and explore more about themselves during the college admissions process. It is so rewarding to be able to use my counseling skills to empower students to uncover their passions and strengths. Whether it is helping them through multiple drafts of their admissions essays, consulting on extracurricular activity opportunities, or advising on each portion of the application portal, I meet the needs of my students by getting to know them as individuals. I value positivity, creativity, dependability, and having a growth mindset.\n\nI have dedicated 15 years of providing outreach, opportunity, and access to students who find their why during the confusing college application process. I was once an unsure high school student, yet I knew that college was one of my many goals. I attended University of California, Davis, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Community and Regional Development. During my time at UC Davis, I worked with high schools in Sacramento as a College Advisor for the University of California. Once I matriculated, I continued my work as a College Advisor. After 2 years in outreach, I moved to Miami and taught English for 2 years. I decided to return to my hometown of San Francisco and led a Junior Seminar class, while also serving as the schoolâ€™s College Counselor. I left the classroom and took the opportunity to work with the University of California San Franciscoâ€™s Center for Science, Education & Outreach. I directed internships for high school students in the San Francisco Bay Area to conduct research under the faculty in the fields of Medicine, Physical Therapy, Nursing, and Dentistry. I had the dual role of working with high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area, as the Lead Outreach Coordinator and University of California representative. I earned my Masters of Arts in Organization and Leadership from the University of San Francisco and I am currently the founding Director of San Francisco Stateâ€™s Latinx Student Center. My passion is to guide students as they find their voice, their why, and their confidence in this process. The students I have worked with have been awarded various scholarships, fellowships, and admissions to prestigious Universities. However, what makes me most proud is knowing that students remember that they have a guide through this process.\n\nI hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Boston College, and a Master of Arts in Higher Education Administration with a concentration in Student Affairs from Boston College. After graduating with my Bachelor's degree from Boston College in 2015, I began my work in higher education as an Admissions Counselor at Northeastern University where I recruited high school seniors from across the country. I was quickly promoted to Assistant Director of Admissions, and it was in this role that I gained the valuable understanding of how highly selective admissions processes operate. After receiving my Masterâ€™s degree, I knew I wanted to be directly supporting students through their college application process, and began my role as an Associate Director of College Counseling at an independent college preparatory school. Having guided over one-hundred students through their application and admissions processes over the past three years, I have a breadth of knowledge that will allow me to best serve you. My first priority is to understand the student - and the experiences, aspirations, and qualities that make you, you. With that knowledge, I will help ensure that you are utilizing your authentic voice to wholly present yourself in your applications. My goal is to empower you through this process - to dig deep and get to know yourself, and to translate that into selecting a college environment that is a best fit for you and will ultimately help you along the path to achieving your goals. I canâ€™t wait to work with you through this process!\n\nHi! I am so thrilled that you are considering me to be a part of your journey to higher education. I understand how exciting and maybe a little scary this time in your life can be, and I am here to help. Here is a bit about me, I am a passionate former admissions professional who believes in the power of higher education and its positive impacts on students, families, and communities. I am an extrovert who enjoys connecting and building relationships with others, type A when it counts, and an optimist, as I believe everything works for good. As for my educational background, I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communication Studies from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a Master of Arts degree in Health and Human Services - Peace and Conflict Studies with a concentration in Education from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and a Doctor of Education degree in Leadership with a concentration in Higher Education Leadership from Virginia Commonwealth University. I began my career working at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte within the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. While there, I held several positions, including Admissions Visit Assistant, Admissions Counselor, and Assistant Director of Admissions. I then joined The Office of Admissions at Virginia Commonwealth University as the Associate Director of Undergraduate Admissions. In this role, I assisted in developing admissions guidelines, reviewed and rendered decisions on admissions applications, supervised admissions professionals, oversaw out-of-state recruitment, oversaw all admissions events, and oversaw the admissions visit program. While at both institutions, I reviewed applications for two highly selective full-pay scholarship and honors programs, the Levine Scholars Program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and the Presidential Scholarship at Virginia Commonwealth University. Additionally, I have been active in state, regional, and national professional admissions organizations, holding organization positions and presenting at conferences regarding admissions best practices. Currently, I serve as a Campus Relations Manager with Intel Corporation, a large global tech company at #41 on the Fortune 500 list. In this role, I work with STEM college students as they apply for internships and full-time employment with the company. As a first-generation college graduate, I had many advisors assist me along my journey. With their help, I achieved my goals and many amazing things during my college career, ultimately earning a terminal degree. I would love to assist you and your family on your journey. I wish you all the best!"
