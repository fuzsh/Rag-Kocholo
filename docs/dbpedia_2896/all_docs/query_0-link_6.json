        "text": "I was pleased to be asked to participate this week in Professor Mike Barger's highly popular MBA Class at the University of Michigan Ross Business School: High Stakes Leadership. I would like to express my appreciation to Professor Barger and Caitlin Johnson, Director of Alumni Engagement, for the opportunity. Thank you. The case was Delphi Technologies restructuring and subsequent sale to BorgWarner. The setting was a press conference announcing the sale with a mock C-suite each roll-playing opening statements followed by Q&A from various pre-assigned stakeholders (Analysts/Investors, Media, Competitors, Regulators, and Customers/Employees). It was a fantastic experience and the students performed brilliantly! While remaining in their mock roles, the class then asked me a wide variety of incredibly insightful questions about the restructuring of Delphi and integration into BorgWarner. It's nice to give back!"
