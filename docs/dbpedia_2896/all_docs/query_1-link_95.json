He was hired in June of 2021.\n\nRubenstein is responsible for coordination of travel arrangements, assisting in the organization of practice, budget management, alumni relations, video coordination and special projects. His first season on staff saw the Lions put together their best season in program history, advancing to the Ivy League Tournament Championship game and the National Quarterfinals of the WNIT. His second season saw Columbia do even better, going 28-6 overall and winning a share of the program's first Ivy League Championship in its 37 years competing in the league. The Lions went on to advance to the Championship Game of the Postseason WNIT, marking the deepest run by any team in Ivy League history.\n\nBefore arriving in Morningside Heights, Rubenstein spent the last two years at Success Academy Charter Schools in Brooklyn, where he was a Lead Teacher focused on reading and writing instruction. He also spent time as an Associate Teacher, co-teaching math and literacy while working with elementary students on their behavioral growth and social-emotional learning.\n\nPrior to entering the classroom, Rubenstein worked at ESPN at the company’s headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, as a Digital Video / Social Associate. In his position, he produced, optimized and distributed ESPN’s digital video content on ESPN.com, the ESPN app and YouTube, while also helping to create original pieces for ESPN’s publications. Rubenstein also edited, published and wrote headlines and captions for ESPN’s digital video content. His time as ESPN also saw him contribute as a sideline reporter.\n\nRubenstein’s digital video and media background extends to the Bleav Podcast Network in Los Angeles, the Barger Leadership Institute, the Big Ten Network and WOLV-TV as a student on-air personality at the University of Michigan. He got his start in college basketball as a student manager for the Michigan men's basketball team, and later became a walk-on practice player on Michigan’s scout team.\n\nRubenstein earned his bachelor’s degree with high distinction from the University of Michigan in 2018, where he majored in organizational studies and minored in writing."
