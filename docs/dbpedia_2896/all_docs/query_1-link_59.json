He obtained a BSE in Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan (Go Blue!), and spent the previous 21 years of his life living in a suburb of Detroit. In his (very limited) time outside of school, one can find Austin watching basketball, doing yoga, and cooking. His teaching style is being mindful of the fact that everyone brings a unique engineering perspective to the table, and providing objective and transparent feedback. Through his internships at Sandia National Labs and General Motors, Austin has witnessed the difference good technical communication can make in a collaborative engineering setting.\n\nTony Wang\n\nPosition: ECE 3005 GTA\n\nDegree Program (BS/MS, PhD, etc.): PhD\n\nExpected Graduation: Semester, Year\n\nTony Wang is a 1st year ECE PhD student studying microbotics for biomedical applications. In the future, he aspires to help advance microbots towards becoming fully autonomous at detecting and destroying cancer cells before they metastasize in the human body. He obtained his B.S. in materials science and engineering with a minor in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. As someone who has spent nearly all his life in the Bay Area, he enjoys visiting San Francisco from time to time with his friends for hiking, exploring (picture is at Nara Park, Japan!), and eating. In his free time, he plays Super Smash Bros Ultimate (not competitively), Ping Pong, and board games with friends, watches movies, and shops for groceries to get those sweet discounts. As a GTA, Tony wants his students to develop and hone their interpersonal skills so that they can work effectively as a team. Consequently, he believes that engineers should have “engine ears” because listening is the key to strong communication.\n\nChrystiano Murray\n\nChrystiano Murray\n\nPosition\n\nDegree Program (BS/MS, PhD, etc.):\n\nExpected Graduation: Semester, Year\n\nQuick blurb about GTA.\n\nMarites Hendrix\n\nPosition: ECE 3005-CIR GTA\n\nDegree Program: ECE Master’s Student\n\nExpected Graduation: Spring, 2020\n\nMy name is Marites Hendrix and I am a master’s student in ECE. I completed my undergraduate at GT as well and have enjoyed my time here, but I look forward to moving to the Northern Virginia/DC area to start working for MITRE as a cyber security engineer starting this summer. Outside of class I spend time exercising, cooking, and playing games! I hope that students in ECE will utilize places such as UPCP to polish their communication skills, and that they carry on these skills with them outside of the classroom. The ability to clearly and concisely relay information to people is not only important for driving a project to success, but also developing a strong community!\n\nSheng Zhang\n\nSheng Zhang\n\nPosition\n\nDegree Program (BS/MS, PhD, etc.):\n\nExpected Graduation: Semester, Year\n\nQuick blurb about GTA.\n\nBradley Zarek\n\nPosition: ECE 2031 GTA\n\nDegree Program: ECE BS/MS\n\nExpected Graduation: Spring, 2020\n\nBradley Zarek is a 1st year ECE Masters student from Jupiter, Florida. He graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and is currently in the B.S./M.S. program. This is his 5th semester as a TA for ECE 2031 and his 2nd semester as a GTA. His coursework is focused on analog electronics and digital signal processing. After completing the M.S. program, he will work for Texas Instruments as an analog designer of buck switching regulators. In his free time, Bradley enjoys playing guitar, going hiking, watching sports, and working on electronics projects. He understands that ECE 2031 is a lot of work, but the skills learned in the class are unbelievably useful. The ability to design, verify, prototype, debug, and communicate results will take you far in ECE and CS.\n\nDerek Watson\n\nPosition: ECE 2031 GTA\n\nDegree Program (BS/MS, PhD, etc.): BS/MS\n\nExpected Graduation: Spring, 2020\n\nDerek Watson is in his second and final semester as a BS/MS student in Electrical and Computer Engineering. He graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech. This is his fifth semester as a TA and second as a GTA for ECE 2031. His coursework is focused on computer software and networks, and he is constantly looking for projects that combine the two. In his free time he enjoys playing video games, watching basketball and sci-fi TV shows, and working on embedded electronics projects. His advice for 2031 students is to enjoy it while you can, because you will look back on this class later in life (either in two years while taking Senior Design or in 30 when you get promoted to engineering manager) and realize how important these concepts are."
