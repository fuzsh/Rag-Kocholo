        "text": "JEFFERSON CITY, Tenn. - Carson-Newman College has named Chuck Benson the head men's basketball coach, C-N Athletic Director David Barger announced at a press conference Tuesday afternoon on the Carson-Newman Campus.\n\nBenson, a 1991 graduate of Carson-Newman College, has spent the last four seasons as associate head coach at Carson-Newman. His two-decade career in the collegiate ranks extends much further than Mossy Creek, including five seasons in the Southeastern Conference at the University of Tennessee, as well as building Martin Methodist College into a national contender in his seven seasons as head coach at the NAIA Division I institution.\n\nPrior to joining the Carson-Newman staff in 2006, Benson was an assistant at Tennessee from 2003-'05 after Vols head coach Buzz Peterson hired him to help bolster recruiting efforts. Tennessee earned a National Invitational Tournament bid for the 2003-'04 season.\n\nBenson joined Bobby Lutz' staff at UNC-Charlotte for the'05-'06 season. The 49ers were in the preseason Top 25 and earned an NIT bid during his one season as an assistant.\n\nIn April or '06, Benson accepted a position at UNC-Wilmington and served as an assistant there until he received the call from Eagles head coach Dale Clayton in August of 2006 with the opportunity to come back to Carson-Newman.\n\nBenson brings a wealth of coaching experience to the Eagles, including a seven-year stint (1996-2003) as head coach at Martin Methodist College in Pulaski, Tenn. The RedHawks were a part of a strong Transouth Athletic Conference, which included three schools (Belmont, Birmingham Southern and Lipscomb) that would eventually become NCAA Division I programs.\n\nDuring his time in Pulaski, Benson led the RedHawks program to unprecedented heights, compiling a 137-95 record. Martin Methodist averaged 20 wins a year over his last six seasons and was listed in the NAIA national rankings for 40 weeks from 1999-2003, including a No. 4 ranking in December of 2002. Benson guided the RedHawks to three consecutive NAIA National Tournament berths from 2001-03, including back-to-back appearances in the Sweet 16 in 2001 and 2002.\n\nFour Martin Methodist players earned NAIA All-America honors during Benson's tenure, which was a first for the small rural institution with less than 500 students enrolled. Off the floor, 16 men's basketball players graduated from Martin Methodist with Benson at the helm. He also implemented the NAIA's \"Champions of Character\" initiative as a way to emphasize character both on and off the court to his student-athletes. Aware of his responsibility to the institution as a whole, Benson served on one SACS accreditation committee and was a member of the Vice President for Academic Affairs selection committee.\n\nPrior to his start in the collegiate ranks, Benson created the Tennessee Travelers summer basketball program in 1987 and coached within the organization during his college years. Benson spent the 1990-'91 season as the head boys' basketball coach at Morristown Covenant Academy in Morristown, Tenn. The team advanced to the championship game in the TANAS State Tournament while compiling an 18-10 overall record.\n\nStarting in the fall of 1991, Benson spent time on staff at Lincoln Memorial University (1991-'92), Carson-Newman (1992-'93), and Tennessee (1993-'96). While at Tennessee, Benson was a part of a National Invitational Tournament appearnace (1995-96) and helped produce two top 20 recruiting classes.\n\nA native of Newport, Tenn., Benson graduated from Cocke County High School in 1987 and earned a B.A. degree in History from Carson-Newman in 1991. He earned a Master's degree in Educational Curriculum and Instruction from Lincoln Memorial University in 1996. Benson and his wife Tabbatha reside in Jefferson City. They have one daughter, Abby.\n\nChuck Benson, Head Basketball Coach, Carson-Newman College\n\n\"I grew up 25 minutes down the road in Newport and have been a fan of Carson-Newman basketball for the last 30 plus years. To be the head men's basketball coach at my alma mater is an honor and a dream come true. I am very excited and look forward to getting to work immediately as we prepare for the 2010-11 season.\"\n\nDavid Barger, Athletic Director, Carson-Newman College\n\n\"Coach Benson has earned the opportunity to serves as our head men's basketball coach. He is high energy, will develop solid relationships with our student-athletes and be effectively engaged with our former players and community. Chuck has the orange and blue blood we are looking for.\"\n\nMurray Bartow, Head Basketball Coach, East Tennessee State University\n\n\"I obviously, from knowing Chuck for a number of years, think it's a great, great hire for Carson-Newman…I think Chuck is exactly what Carson-Newman was looking for as both a player, and as a person…Chuck is a smart coach, and has been around a number of very successful coaches, and I think he'll draw from that and bring a very exciting style of play to Carson-Newman.\"\n\nBuzz Peterson, Head Basketball Coach, UNC Wilmington\n\n\"I am just very excited for Chuck and his family...Chuck has a strong passion for the game and even a stronger passion for recruiting…He understands so much of this game is recruiting and takes the challenge of it head on. I would expect to see real changes in the talent at Carson-Newman in the near future.\""
