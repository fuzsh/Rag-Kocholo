You have left your legacy, and we want to thank you.\n\nWith the cancellation of the NCA & NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championship, we want to honor the seniors that have given their all to their team throughout their time as a college cheerleader. Thank you to the coaches who nominated their seniors to be recognized.\n\nAlma College\n\nName: Gabby Saum\n\nCollege: Alma College\n\nYears on Team: 4\n\nTitles and Awards: 2x STUNT All-American 2017, NCA National Champion 2018\n\nFuture Plans: Gabby will be earning her Bachelors of Science in Nursing this spring and plans to pursue a career as a nurse.\n\nWords from Coach: “Gabby is a competitor!

As one of the first student-athletes that I had the opportunity to coach from her freshman to senior year, I have come to know Andie as an exceptional young woman who I hold in the highest regard. Andie has a versatile skill set which includes a strong work ethic and her ability to persevere.

Andie— or Nancy, the nickname she has picked up along the way on the mat — is one of the hardest workers I have ever met. Andie has been a part of our coed team all four years she has been with the program. She is a fiercely talented athlete, and one of the strongest people I know. As an athlete, Andie does it all. She is a powerhouse tumbler, an incredibly strong and technically sound main base, a dependable middle layer, and an amazing top layer. Andie filled so many roles and was an inspiration to all of her teammates, as well as her coach. She is the type of athlete and teammate that pushed you to be better and to rise to the occasion. She never settled for anything less then the best and always gave more than I thought any one person could ever give.

Tyler brought a level of seriousness and dedication to every work out, practice, and rep that pushed his teammates to be better. Without fail, he was the first to every practice, showing up an hour early to get extra reps in, and always the last to leave. He often ended a day of full outs by running lines on his own accord. Tyler served our country in the Army, and then cheered for Grand Valley State for 4 years. This was his final season, and as my heart breaks for him as a coach to not be able to perform his senior routine, I am able to find peace in the big picture. Tyler has set the bar for the work ethic and dedication it takes to be a male cheerleader at GVSU, and his legacy will remain. No one will ever out-work Tyler “Cowboy” Rush, and one of the biggest pleasures of my coaching career was being able to coach such a dedicated and humble athlete.”\n\nHarvard University\n\nName: Amanda Flores\n\nCollege: Harvard University\n\nYears on Team: 4\n\nTitles and Awards: Senior Captain, 6th place NCA Nationals, 7th place NCA Nationals, National Champion NECA (New England Cheerleaders Association) 2017\n\nFuture Plans: Amanda’s future plans and career goals are quite extensive and currently still being decided due to the selected finalists and delays due to COVID-19.
