        "text": "We have partnered with MTUâs College of Engineering for their MS in Mechanical Engineering program. It provides students with hands-on learning experience that will help them excel in one of the top fields in the US. Students will benefit from extensive research facilities on campus and at satellite locations.\n\nThe minimum eligibility requirement is an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering or closely related technical field from an accredited college or university with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher on a 4.00 scale. A 4-year degree is preferred. A 3-year degree will be considered for highly qualified candidates. Please consult the eligibility section for more information.\n\nApplications for Leap applicants are open now. Fall semester classes begin online in August and Spring Semester classes begin in January. Book a free counselling session today to learn more about this exciting program at one of the top tech schools in Michigan, US.\n\nYes, international students on an F-1 visa can work up to 20 hours per week on-campus during the academic semesters. On-campus jobs are competitive, not guaranteed, and typically are not professional-level positions. After receiving admission, students can view campus job openings on the online job board to apply.\n\nSTEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Students studying in a STEM-designated program can apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT), allowing them to work for 12 months in the US after completing the degree program. The STEM designation of the MTU Health Informatics program makes students eligible for an additional 24-month STEM OPT extension. With up to 36 months more time to work and network in the US, international students can build valuable professional skills and contacts to help them with their career endeavors.\n\nMichigan experiences all four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter, and the community of Houghton is sure to enjoy all of them with outdoor activities both on and off campus. Houghton has access to a major waterway, providing a peaceful and calming environment to study. Houghton was ranked as the #8 Most Beautiful Small Towns in America by Architectural Digest. Niche.com ranks Michigan Tech as the safest public college campus in Michigan. Friendly and welcoming, Houghton's historic downtown features locally owned shops, eateries, museums, restaurants, and shopping. MTU earned a gold star rating in 2023 for sustainability in all five categories â academics, engagement, operations, planning and administration, and innovation and leadership â that add up to a final score. Providing an active and vibrant campus is central to MTU's traditions, along with its long tradition of welcoming Indian students to campus."
