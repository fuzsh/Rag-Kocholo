        "text": "MACOMB, MI-Aaron David Thomas of Macomb Township, MI, formerly of Mineral Ridge, died Monday, August 11, 2008 in Munson Hospice House, Traverse City, MI, after a courageous 21 year battle with cancer, the last 10 of which were with a brain tumor. He was 36. Aaron was born July 28, 1972 in Youngstown OH. Before becoming disabled by a massive brain tumor, he worked as a certified auto body repair specialist. He had been employed before his disability at the Daffron Body Shop, Cortland, and at Steve's Service, McDonald. He enjoyed gardening, coin collecting, cooking and had a great love for the outdoors, especially camping and fishing. He loved country western music and was an avid fan of NASCAR racing. His favorite driver was Dave Blaney of Hartford. Aaron always will be remembered for his winning smile, his engaging sense of humor and his absolute and total commitment to and love for his family. But it was his spirit and his valiant struggle to defeat the disease that eventually claimed his life that will forever define his memory. Aaron was a 1990 graduate of Mathews High School, Vienna, and attended Youngstown State University. Besides his parents, William (Carol) Thomas Jr. of Traverse City and Karen (David) Meyers of Mount Clemens, MI, he leaves his beloved sister and best friend, Elizabeth Anne (Anthony) Weaver of Macomb Twp., a stepsister Kelly (Stephen) Krason of Warren, MI; two nephews Aiden and Lucian Weaver, and a niece, Zoe Weaver, all of Macomb Twp.; and grandmothers Lena Thomas of Traverse City and Iris Clouser of Shelby Twp. He was preceded in death by his grandfathers William Thomas Sr. of McDonald and Warren F. Clouser of Warren, OH, and two uncles Larry Clouser of Vienna and Thomas Clouser of Salem, VA. He also leaves his physician and good friend, Dr. Geoffrey Barger, whose skill gave Aaron life when others gave up hope. It also was his compassion that helped make Aaron's struggle bearable and gave his life meaning. A funeral service will take place at 1:30PM Saturday, August 16, 2008 in the Lane Funeral Home Mineral Ridge Chapel, where family will receive friends from 12:30PM to 1:30 PM Saturday. Interment will follow in Kerr Cemetery, Weathersfield Twp. Michigan arrangements were under the care of the Reynolds-Jonkhoff Funeral Home, Traverse City. The family requests that material contributions take the form of contributions in Aaron's honor to the Wayne State University Brain Tumor Research Fund, Attn. G.R. Barger, M.D., Department of Neurology, 8D-UHC, 4201 St. Antoine, Detroit, MI 48201."
