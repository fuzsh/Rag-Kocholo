        "text": "Since its establishment as the LSA “Visiting Committee” by Dean Peter Steiner in 1985, the Dean’s Advisory Council has been an important resource for the leadership of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. As a purpose-driven board that explores the college’s issues and challenges, DAC members draw upon their professional expertise and life experiences to support the mission and values of the college. They provide unique perspectives along with connections to their professional and personal networks. DAC members also help generate financial support for the college’s priorities and serve as ambassadors of the college and the liberal arts."
