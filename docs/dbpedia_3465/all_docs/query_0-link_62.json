The focal ﬁlms in the chapters were made in 1998–2010. These ﬁlms are experimental in that they have been inﬂuenced by the ﬁrst (late 1920s–early 1930s) and second (1960s–1970s) avant-gardes as evidenced by the paratactical use of montage, the similarities with Italian neorealism, and an antihegemonic stance regarding the industrial, Hollywood model. While many Latin American ﬁlms of this period share the conventions of the documentary and neorealism, that is, shooting real subjects on location and focusing on actual events, only a few feature an experimental deployment of montage that results in breaks in causality. These breaks are related to the “interval,” which Gilles Deleuze deﬁnes as a delay between an action and a reaction. More importantly, the break suggests the unforeseeable nature of the reaction (Rodowick, 60; Deleuze, Cinema 1, 81). In the corpus of this text, the interval is represented by montage deﬁned in a broad manner. Indeed, rather than a style of cutting, montage becomes a logic of composition and to that extent a concept or an overriding idea that regulates the system (Rodowick, 51). The selection of ﬁlms is always already arbitrary; in this book I oﬀer a range of genres and conclude with a few suggestions. No other book on\n\nBook 1.indb 1\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n2\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nthe market presents a comparative analysis across the contemporary cinematic production of some of the most important national traditions, underscoring shared thematic and formal preoccupations. I take a philosophical approach to emphasize the ﬁlmmakers’ preoccupation with time as possibility as well as the portrayal of characters who witness events rather than react to them, resulting in an aﬀective reading and thus broadening the Latin American imaginary in terms of counterhegemonic readings. The Deleuzian approach underscores the diﬀerence between the features associated with the structure of classic Hollywood ﬁlms—in other words, linear narratives propelled by strict causality, as epitomized by Hitchcock’s ﬁlms (Deleuze, Cinema 1)—and the impact of Italian neorealism and the French New Wave, explicitly regarding neorealism’s signature concern with the protagonist as witness, thus stressing the voyage, the dispersive situation, the intentionally weak links, the deliberate condemnation of plot, and the consciousness of clichés (Deleuze, Cinema 2). Most of the ﬁlmmakers in this text contest the classic Hollywood mode of a linear narrative (based on a single diegesis) that appears to be anchored in (the illusion of) realism as well as in spatial and temporal verisimilitude and psychologically motivated characters. Ideological and economic factors caused neorealist features to pervade the New Argentine Cinema, the Brazilian Cinema da Retomada, and the work of a variety of relatively young ﬁlmmakers in countries with rich cinematic traditions, among them Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba. Countries with less-sustained national cinematic traditions, such as Paraguay and Peru, have contributed to understanding the impact of neorealism, for this diverse gamut of directors who, like Deleuze, translate the time-image into an emphasis on sight in ﬁlms that represent time as possibility. In these ﬁlms, experimentation increases as their directors distance themselves from the industrial, Hollywood model. The term “experimental” follows Umberto Eco’s deﬁnition, which proposes a contrast between the typically revolutionary and antagonistic features of the avant-garde versus the desire for acceptance of experimentalism, where innovation and critique occur from within an established tradition, with the intent of becoming the norm (Eco, 102–103). Insofar as the avant-garde montage techniques of the 1920s and 1930s have become canonical, the deployment of montage in the ﬁlms in this book is experimental, while representing a broad range of themes and a variety of genres. These ﬁlms do not\n\nBook 1.indb 2\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nnecessarily constitute a coherent whole but are rather in dialogue with one another in terms of shared aesthetic features. The rest of the introduction oﬀers a historical contextualization of the cinematic tradition in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru. The chronological approach is complemented by a discussion of montage as typical of the ﬁrst avant-garde, in Europe, the United States, and Latin America, and the inception of the documentary as a genre, in Britain and Latin America. By focusing on the aesthetics of neorealism, I underscore its traditional fusion with the conventions of the documentary in Latin American cinematic production. While the diﬀerent manifestations of the New Latin American Cinema of the late 1960s and the 1970s tie in experimentation with montage, a documentary approach, and neorealist aesthetics, the recent boom in ﬁlm production in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico includes a strong industrial production but also suggests a development and continuation of the aesthetics of the New Latin American Cinema. The section on the most relevant philosophical concepts that Gilles Deleuze applied to cinema contextualizes discussion in the following chapters as brieﬂy presented at the end of the introduction.\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL CINEMATIC TRADITIONS Silent movies arrived in Latin American capitals fast on the heels of their Parisian premières. The ﬁrst ﬁlm screenings took place in Buenos Aires on July 6, 1896, and in Rio de Janeiro two days later. By the following month, August 1896, Lumière’s cameramen were in Mexico shooting Porﬁrio Díaz and his entourage. In Peru the ﬁrst ﬁlm screenings took place on January 2, 1897, and later that month in Cuba, still a Spanish colony, on January 24. From 1900 to 1912, the annual production of more than one hundred Brazilian ﬁlms dominated that country’s domestic market. In 1913 Enrique Díaz Quesada (1882–1923) initiated the Cuban national cinematic tradition with a series of nine ﬁlms focused on events related to country’s new independence. From 1917 through 1921, Mexico produced an average of ten movies per year. That success was short-lived, since Hollywood took over the market by 1923. In Peru, realism and social commentary soon emerged as the dominant mode, as evidenced by Enrique Cornejo Villanueva’s Luis Pardo (1927), the ﬁrst Peruvian feature ﬁlm, which focused on a famous bandit. Although Hipólito Carrón’s ten-minute ﬁlm Alma paraguaya (Paraguayan Soul) dates to 1925, Paraguay still lacks a signiﬁcant cinematic\n\nBook 1.indb 3\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n4\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\ntradition, so each new production is hailed as “the ﬁrst Paraguayan ﬁlm” (Etcheverry, 156). The following sections explore the topics of montage, documentary, and realism, beginning with their respective historization and ending with their application in the most contemporary Latin American cinema. Montage Latin American experimental cinema begins, ironically, comme il faut, in Paris with the urban symphony Rien que les heures (1926) by Brazilian ﬁlmmaker Alberto Cavalcânti (1897–1982). Though it could be argued that Cavalcânti was merely applying the avant-garde montage concepts with which he had become familiar, the Brazilian director was to prove an instrumental ﬁgure in the history of cinema.1 Cavalcânti’s Rien que les heures is an intertextual pastiche that inscribes and subverts generic conventions. A shot of a group of elegant women that then becomes a photo is subsequently shredded into minute pieces. Texts dissolve, ﬁrst into a self-reﬂexive image of an eye, then into an alternation of paintings, sketches, and pictures that reference varied styles—impressionism, cubism, and expressionism—before leading into abstract images. Names of well-known artists retrospectively anchor the references. The ﬂags of diﬀerent countries that ﬂy in unison unexpectedly give way to sets of masklike eyes ﬂuttering like ﬁsh. Snippets of stories of the underclass, such as a prostitute looking for a one-night stand, are set against series of ﬂowers. As dissolves lead into other series, this riotously associative montage pushes still further into sets of brimming baskets that signal the beginning of another busy day. We are reminded of cosmopolitan Cavalcânti’s admonitory proviso, “Toutes les villes seraint pareilles si leurs monuments ne les distinguaient pas” (All cities would be alike if not for their monuments). So did his Paris preﬁgure Berlin, as in collaboration with Walter Ruttmann (1887–1941) Cavalcânti produced Berlin: Die symphonie der Großstadt (1927). This urban-symphony genre crossed the Atlantic, as Brazilian ﬁlmmakers Adalberto Kemeny (1901–1961) and Rodolfo Lustig (1901–1970) produced São Paulo: Sinfonia de uma metrópole (1929), a ﬁlm designed to reveal the “grandeza desta soberbia metrópole, graças à energia construtiva do seu povo” (greatness of this proud metropolis, resulting from the constructive energy of its people). Adhering to the nationalist ideology, the movie presents the feverish activity of a day in São Paulo, emphasizing\n\nBook 1.indb 4\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nthe city’s continued progress (Stam, “On the Margins,” 307). Experimental ﬂourishes include alternating documentary shots with a montage of images structured by association that give way to a kaleidoscopic, simultaneous projection in three or ﬁve sections of the screen. Using ﬁlm, he stresses the modernity of the city and thus of the nation. Cavalcânti’s contribution to and connection with the avant-garde occur within roughly the same context as those of a close contemporary, Russian ﬁlmmaker Sergei Eisenstein (1898–1948), who had produced Strike (1924) and Battleship Potemkin (1924). At that point, Eisenstein’s inﬂuence on Latin American cinema was even more direct than Calvacânti’s, as the Russian traveled to Mexico in 1930 just as the Brazilian ﬁlmmaker Mário Peixoto (1910–1992) was directing Limite (1931). Peixoto, who was only nineteen at the time, became conversant with the European avant-garde during his trips to England and France (Stam, “On the Margins,” 307), reinforcing the motif of the international nature of cinematic cross-fertilization. Peixoto’s Limite intertwines three stories through highly metaphoric visual language. Though there is nothing particularly Brazilian in these stories, Peixoto’s ﬁlm continues to enjoy its status as a cult movie in Brazil, perhaps due to the suggestive and ambiguous eﬀect of the young director’s use of montage.2 Limite opens with shots of vultures ﬂying into a nest, followed by a shocking image of a woman’s face over cuﬀed hands. After a dissolve the handcuﬀed ﬁsts become the focal point. Then they fuse into the woman’s eyes, which subsequently dissolve into the reﬂection of the sun on the sea. As the process continues, the audience realizes that these eyes and hands belong to two women and a man whose intertwined stories converge, as they are stranded together on a boat in high sea. Two years after the inception of Limite, Brazilian director Humberto Mauro (1897–1983) fused German expressionism and Russian montage in Ganga bruta (Rough Scum, 1933). More importantly, Mauro’s record of daily life in Favela dos meus amores (Favela of My Loves, 1934) precedes neorealism. The foundation of national ﬁlm traditions gained momentum with the arrival of sound. European wars of 1936–1945 prompted embargos on ﬁlm stock. Argentina, in the years 1937–1940, produced 168 ﬁlms, Mexico 161, Brazil 34, and Peru 22 (Schumann, 270). In the 1930s, sound track brought a new genre to Brazil as the chanchada (from Paraguayan Spanish slang meaning “trash,” “mess,” or “trick”) implied the easy accessibility of these ﬁlms to a culturally deprived public that was somewhat familiar with U.S.\n\nBook 1.indb 5\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n6\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nmusicals as epitomized by Carmen Miranda. The chanchada generated hundreds of movies from the late '30s well into the '50s (Johnson and Stam, 27). Meanwhile, from the 1940s on, Mexico became a main ﬁlm producer in Spanish, as perceived competition from Argentine tango ﬁlms was assuaged by the United States; cuts to the provision of ﬁlm stock had a fatal impact on the nascent industry. The golden age of Mexican cinema was consolidated by the emergence of several important directors, a star system, and a proven formula (King, Magical Reels, 47). Subsidized by the state, Mexican ﬁlms reinforced old-fashioned notions about national character in melodramas, rancheras—musical comedies focused on the ups and downs of rural people—and rumberas or cabareteras based on the stereotype of the fallen woman with a heart of gold (Hershﬁeld and Maciel, 34). Legends of this era include El Indio Fernández (Emilio Fernández Romo), Dolores del Río, María Félix, Cantinﬂas (Mario Moreno), and Tin Tan (Germán Valdés). Like Mexico and Brazil, Argentina pursued a policy of oﬃcial support for the nascent national ﬁlm industry, yet the period had few memorable projects. The Perón administration (1945–1955) saw the completion of Hugo del Carril’s marvelous but ideologically ﬂawed Las aguas bajan turbias (Dark River, 1952), whose focus on the overriding force of nature, including unbridled passions, precluded dwelling on the working conditions of the exploited peons. The 1955 coup d’état prompted improvements in the Argentine ﬁlm industry: Leopoldo Torre Nilsson’s hermetic movies La casa del ángel (The House of the Angel, 1957) and La caída (The Fall, 1959) inaugurated a national auteur cinema with an international aesthetics (Beceyro, 42–43). Brazilian producers similarly tried to emulate an international aesthetics. Backed by an industrial production and distribution system, Vera Cruz Studios, founded in São Paulo in 1949, imported top-quality equipment and experienced European technicians. Actors, decor, costumes, and music were to evoke a European ambience. Vera Cruz produced eighteen feature ﬁlms; the most famous, Lima Barreto’s O cangaceiro (1953), won two prizes at Cannes and was a worldwide success. Vera Cruz improved the technical quality of Brazilian ﬁlms, increased investment, and incorporated an international cinematic language. Cavalcânti stayed until 1951, and Vera Cruz’s production system went bankrupt in 1954, largely because its industrial ﬁlms failed to connect with local audiences and lacked appropriate distribution to reach the international market. As Cavalcânti ignored his experimental beginnings he came to\n\nBook 1.indb 6\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nbe seen as an agent of imperialism as well as a catalyst for Cinema Novo (Johnson, Cinema Novo × 5, 5–7). — As well known for his directorial work as for his theoretical musings on the nature of montage, Sergei Eisenstein is remembered for his dialectical method, which posited that a new concept would arise from the juxtaposition of two ﬁlm pieces of any kind (Film Sense, 4). Eisenstein understood that the visual counterpoint within the shot could be deﬁned in terms of graphic or spatial conﬂict, conﬂict between planes or volumes, or conﬂict in lighting or tempo (“Dramaturgy of Film Form,” Selected Works, 166–172). By 1929 Eisenstein added other types of montage, namely metric, rhythmic, tonal, overtonal, and intellectual (“Fourth Dimension”, ibid., 186–194). Like Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov (1896–1954), a practicing ﬁlmmaker, was interested in the theoretical nature of montage. Indeed, Vertov’s Man with a Camera (1929) presented machines, landscapes, buildings, or men as part of a material system in perpetual interaction. Vertov is essentially recognized for freeing the camera from human intervention. The importance of montage in the ﬁrst European (Eisenstein, Vertov, Ruttmann) and Latin American (Cavalcânti, Peixoto) avant-garde appears throughout the ﬁlms discussed in this book. These ﬁlms share the deployment of montage as a paratactical structuring device in the act of literally placing scenes side by side. Just as in language we expect clauses or phrases to follow one after another without coordinating or subordinating connectives, paratactical structures in ﬁlm result from noticeably omitting editing transitions. Montage is a factor in Fernando Pérez Valdés’s Suite Habana, which incorporates Eisenstein’s dialectic, rhythmic, tonal, and associative montage, while Fabián Bielinsky’s El aura naturalizes the experimental use of montage as repetition in terms of conventional representations of psychic processes. Those processes involve the protagonist’s epileptic seizures, his stream of consciousness (scenes of the initial heist at the cash register in the museum), recollections, and mental preparation to face a traumatic event (such as the killing of a deer and of his enemies at the end). Montage, as a rapid succession of shots, appears in industrial roadies such as Walter Salles’s Central do Brasil to suggest the female protagonist’s fainting as a result from hunger and overexertion. Salles resorts to montage in both interview sections, purportedly as a thematic editing\n\nBook 1.indb 7\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n8\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\ndevice but also as a way to safeguard the interviewees’ privacy, at least in the ﬁrst series. Similarly, during the initial thirty minutes of El camino de San Diego Carlos Sorín relies on montage to buttress characterization by juxtaposing recollections focused on diﬀerent aspects of the protagonist’s idolization of soccer player Diego Armando Maradona. In El cielito, María Victoria Menis portrays the protagonist’s dreams by way of the experimental use of montage. As a paratactical structuring device, montage is deployed to edit frames and shots or to alternate plot lines. In Carlos Reygadas’s ﬁlms, the abrupt juxtaposition of scenes reinforces the importance of the interval, which results in a verfremdungs-eﬀekt, as the need to ﬁll in the blanks becomes obvious. Oliveira Cézar deploys montage as a structuring device that allows for intertextual relations between similar narratives across temporal and spatial disjunctions. Montage appears with more latitude in Heitor Dhalia’s O cheiro do ralo by naturalizing the protagonist’s path to self-destruction through a series of seemingly interchangeable scenes that oﬀer multiple permutations of a pattern of exchange. Montage takes a diﬀerent route in Días de Santiago, in which Josué Méndez’s experimental aesthetics may be deﬁned as the alternation between shots in color, designed to suggest contemporary reality, with others in black and white, to allude to the protagonist’s past. By contrast, Paz Encina suggests montage by varying the distance of the shots from a ﬁxed camera in Hamaca paraguaya, whose paratactical articulation is apparent at the end of the ﬁlm, since the trauma experienced by the characters allows the audience to consider the possible arbitrariness of the order of the scenes, insofar as the protagonists obsessively recall their son’s farewell. As a structuring device in Pérez Valdés’s Madrigal (2006), montage underscores the juxtaposition of alternate reversible plots, such as the play, the personal lives of the actors, and their transformation in the short story. The Documentary According to John Grierson (1898–1972), founder of the British documentary movement, documentary depicts the story of a living scene as well as its original or native actors. Generic conventions include respect for the content of the image, the interpretive potential of editing, and the representation of social relationships (Aitken, 41, 83). These factors enter into our tendency to associate documentaries with commentary by voice-over\n\nBook 1.indb 8\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nnarrators or exchanges between reporters and interviewees. Even if we become aware of the multiple perspectives on an issue, the commentator’s words usually acquire an aura of truthfulness. Thus, documentaries present events as history reclaimed (Nichols, 21).3 Classical cinema deploys voice to buttress the impression of reality, yet it subordinates sound to sight and noise to speech. Synchronization is fundamental to identifying the source of sound, and to emphasizing speech, which serves to suture the spectator into the story, quite in the same way as the shot/reverse shot formation (Silverman, Acoustic Mirror, 43–45). While contemporary critics challenge the objectivity of the documentary by citing the socially constructed nature of reality, the documentary has thrived, spawning many subgenres such as the ethnographic ﬁlm, cinema vérité, autobiographical documentary, documentary drama, indigenous documentary productions, and television documentary journalism (Beattie, 2).4 The current revival may be traced to the inﬂux of new media, that is, the widespread availability of video recorders, and a renewed emphasis on realism.5 In her foundational book on the social documentary in Latin America, Juliane Burton identiﬁes four modes of the documentary—expository, observational, interactive, and reﬂexive—noting that the admixture of modes constitutes a ﬁfth category. Since the observational mode recurs in the ﬁlms examined in this corpus, we shall proceed to deﬁne its main characteristics.6 Thematically, observational documentaries tend to focus on the behavior of subjects within social formations (families, institutions, communities) at moments of historical or personal crisis. Technically, the observational mode is noted for presenting the voice of the observed in indirect verbal address. There is a general predominance of synchronous sound and long takes. While the interaction between observer and observed is kept to a minimum, the mode provides a sense of impartiality that results from the intimate detail and texture of the lived experience (Burton, 4). Writing at about the same time as Burton, Bill Nichols notes that the observational mode appears to provide direct access to the events taking place in front of the camera (38). The audience seems to be watching social actors, that is, individuals whose performance consists of representing themselves to others by playing out their daily lives. In terms of generic conventions, the observational mode is noticeable for its indirect address: speech is overheard as social actors engage with one another rather than\n\nBook 1.indb 9\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n10\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nspeak to the camera. Synchronous sound and relatively long takes anchor speech to images that locate dialogue (and sound) in a speciﬁc moment and historical place. The observational documentary adheres to the conventions of classic narrative ﬁction: it displays a three-dimensional fullness and unity in which the observer’s location is readily determined and the space appears to have been carved from the historical world. In sum, observational documentaries share such narrative conventions of ﬁction as plot, character, and situation. To the extent that they build tension and oﬀer closure, they both inscribe and subvert the purported objectivity of documentary (Nichols, 39, 107). — Peruvian directors Manuel Chambi and Luis Figueroa, who founded the Cuzco Film Club in 1955, produced ethnographic documentaries primarily based on the cultures of indigenous peoples. The Cuzco School (as per Georges Sadoul’s coinage) earned prestigious international prizes. During the 1960s Luis Figueroa, Eulogio Nishiyama, and César Villanueva shared directorial responsibilities as they shot Kukuli (1960), spoken entirely in Quechua, a tragic love story in which the indigenous female protagonist falls prey to an ukuku, a mythical kidnapping bear, which kills her after having pushed her lover from a bell tower. After the bear is hunted down, the spirits of the lovers live on, transmuted into a pair of aﬀectionate llamas. European inﬂuences preceded much Latin American work with documentary. Nelson Pereira dos Santos spent two months in Paris in 1949. Upon his return he produced Rio 40 graus (Rio 100 Degrees, 1955), a semidocumentary on the people of Rio, as the camera follows boys who come down from the favela (slum) to sell peanuts in Copacabana. Cubans Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Julio García Espinosa and Argentine Fernando Birri traveled to Rome to study ﬁlmmaking at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematograﬁa in the early 1950s. Returning to Argentina in the mid1950s, Birri founded the Escuela Documental de Santa Fe. In so doing he drew from Grierson’s deﬁnition of the documentary as a genre that oﬀered a creative elaboration of reality based on actual events, nonprofessional actors, and issues emerging from the speciﬁc locations (Birri, 36). Birri involved his students in a sociological study that focused on the proletarians who lived by the railway tracks—especially those children who regularly risked their lives as they ran along the bridge while begging for a dime. This project began with a photographic exhibition and culminated in the ﬁlm Tire dié (Toss Me a Dime, 1956–1958).\n\nBook 1.indb 10\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nThere were other collaborative ventures, too. La hora de los hornos (Hour of the Furnaces, 1968) was co-directed by Argentine ﬁlmmakers Fernando E. Solanas, Octavio Getino, and Gerardo Vallejo, who were part of the collective Cine Liberación. While political conditions in Argentina forced Solanas, Getino, and Vallejo to ﬁlm clandestinely, they posited a guerrilla cinema that proved both inﬂuential and forward and whose manifestations varied according to its practitioners. The production of La hora de los hornos involved input from the workers as well as an active audience subjected to a constant barrage of images designed to illustrate the ideas of that essay-ﬁlm. The screening also called for interruptions intended to engage the audience in live discussions, part of an aesthetic of seeking impromptu interactions termed cine-actos (ﬁlm-acts) that aimed to subvert cinematic illusion by transforming the passive experience of watching a movie into an active performance or living theater. La hora de los hornos appears to have a polyphonic structure resulting from the montage of images of multiple sources such as other ﬁlms, TV images, advertisements, and interviews with real people. Paradoxically, this polyphony is set against an unambiguous message based on a schematic historicist model (revisionismo histórico).7 Concluding the ﬁrst of three parts in the ﬁlm’s original version, a ﬁve-minute shot of Che Guevara’s corpse suggests that the movie articulates a call to join the armed struggle. The second part of the ﬁlm focuses on Juan Perón’s ﬁrst administration (1945–1955), but here the uniﬁed ideological tone of the ﬁrst part breaks down, creating ambiguity as Solanas and Getino—as well as Vallejo—unwittingly fail to situate Peronism in the context of Latin American populism and reinscribe Peronism’s constant swing between democracy and authoritarianism through the manipulative and participatory format of the ﬁlm (Stam, “Hour of the Furnaces,” 263–264).8 Argentine-Israeli ﬁlm critic Tzvi Tal, who identiﬁes Peronist verticalism (top-down decision making) in the ideological process of La hora de los hornos, attributes this ideology to several factors, ranging from Perón’s military background to the typical authoritarianism of Argentine culture (69). Part 3 is equally monological in conveying a call to end imperialism and neocolonization enforced by native elites, ironically by way of multiple interviews of victims of state terrorism in the 1930s, 1950s, and 1960s Perón’s return becomes the panacea. Relative to the much larger nations of Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina, ﬁlm production was sporadic in Cuba until the revolution prevailed when on March 24, 1959, a group of young Cubans founded the ICAIC (Instituto\n\nBook 1.indb 11\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n12\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nCubano del Arte y la Industria Cinematográﬁca). The ICAIC was to produce newsreels, documentaries, cartoons, and feature ﬁlms. The revolution would reach a broad audience throughout the island as the ICAIC deployed mobile units for projecting open-air movies in the countryside. Among the Cuban directors to emerge out of the ICAIC, only Gutiérrez Alea and García Espinosa had prior professional training and experience as ﬁlmmakers; they attended the Centro Sperimentale de Cinematograﬁa and there became aware of neorealism, whose inﬂuences proved both immediate and far-reaching not just in Cuba but throughout Latin America. Upon returning from Rome, Gutiérrez Alea and García Espinosa produced El mégano (The Charcoal Worker, 1955). This ﬁlm about the substandard living conditions of brick makers anticipates concerns that Cuban directors would be expressing a decade after the revolution toppled Batista in widely circulated movies such as Gutiérrez Alea’s Memorias del subdesarrollo (Memories of Underdevelopment, 1968) and Humberto Solás’s Lucía (1968), both of which privileged aesthetic experimentation (Elena and Díaz López, 5). As the ICAIC was founded on the premise that cinema is art and the Cuban government had many friends and sympathizers internationally, a good many Cuban movies garnered prestigious awards at ﬁlm festivals in the 1960s and subsequent decades. Neorealism Since Italian neorealism has exerted a continuing, profound eﬀect on Latin American cinema, attention to that genre’s or school’s origins reveals the aesthetic concerns that recur into the present. Though Neapolitan silent-era ﬁlms foreshadowed neorealist aesthetics, neorealism is to some degree a moral statement, for it emerges out of the postwar Italian repudiation of fascism, whose proponents were deeply involved in ﬁlm as a way of promoting an imperialist agenda. Although ﬁlmmakers did not adhere to the same prescribed techniques, neorealism can be deﬁned as a group of Italian ﬁlms produced from 1945 to 1952 that loosely shared certain aesthetic conventions but never formed a self-conscious movement (Ruberto and Wilson, 6). As neorealists left the studios for the countryside or the city, their cameras focused on physical and social realities (Shiel, 10). Production was usually low-budget and artisanal. Neorealism’s representation of the poor working or peasant classes often explores the point of view of children, who remained largely absent from previous cinematic treatments of social problems. Though neoreal-\n\nBook 1.indb 12\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nism was primarily aimed at audience reﬂection, it also strove for emotional engagement (Hess, 106–107). By oﬀering attractive narrative techniques and focusing on social issues, neorealism redeﬁned national identity, which made it very popular (Ruberto and Wilson, 3). After the Italian period, roughly 1945–1955, neorealism became a politics and an aesthetics that inﬂuenced the New Latin American Cinema and Cinema Novo in the 1960s and 1970s, then cinema in Europe (Anglo-Saxon, German rubble ﬁlms, Czechoslovak New Wave), the United States, Africa, and India, and prevalent in contemporary Latin American cinema. — When Gutiérrez Alea and García Espinosa returned to Cuba from their sojourn in Rome, they made ﬁlms deeply inﬂuenced by neorealism, which shares some characteristics with the documentary, such as the use of nonprofessional actors and shooting on location (Hess, 105). While neorealism initially had a documentary ﬂair in that it focused on the factors that aﬀected the daily existence and conditions of the Italian people, by the 1950s, storytelling infused the documentary spirit of neorealism (Kolker, 65). So did a number of foundational Cuban ﬁlms such as Gutiérrez Alea’s Memorias del subdesarrollo, Solás’s Lucía, and Sara Gómez’s De cierta manera (One Way or Another, 1974) fuse the generic conventions of drama with those of the documentary (López, 135–156). After his sojourn in Paris, dos Santos also adapted neorealist techniques in Vidas secas (Barren Lives, 1963); attracted by their humanistic appeal, he was convinced that Cinema Novo was the Brazilian application of this method.\n\nAESTHETICS AND POLITICS The devastation resulting from World War II inﬂuenced the aesthetics of neorealism. When Cinecittá, founded in 1935 as the “most modern and best equipped studio in Europe (Brunetta, 72, 108), had become a refugee camp by 1945, directors were forced to ﬁlm on location or to build sets. Whether directors were inspired by true stories or made them up, there was a sense that the camera recorded life in real time (Brunetta, 110), with the harshness of documentaries (Shiel, 10). The lack of resources likewise exerted a powerful impact on the neorealist aesthetics of the New Latin American Cinema and Cinema Novo and would recur in the 1990s to inﬂuence the aesthetics of the New Argentine Cinema, the Cinema da\n\nBook 1.indb 13\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n14\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nRetomada in Brazil, and the contemporary production of certain directors in other Latin American countries. The main diﬀerence between neorealism and the New Latin American Cinema, including Cinema Novo, was the avowed distance from Hollywood, that is, classical cinema. In other words, neorealism did not go far enough in using ﬁlm for social commentary. According to some Latin American directors, neorealist ﬁlmmakers failed to deploy their techniques to address the revolutionary movements of the 1960s. They certainly neglected to challenge issues of underdevelopment. Although neorealist directors struggled against the imperialist designs of fascism, theirs was a brief interlude in comparison with the impact of colonialism and imperialism in Latin America, especially in view of the struggle to achieve national cinematic traditions.9 Moreover, by playing down the role of the people and the state in the fascist past and by positing the unfeasibility of utopia through strategies of containment that allowed for the preservation of the status quo, both in terms of social class and of patriarchal capitalism, neorealism ultimately articulated conservative discourses. As we shall see, the same failure also has been attributed to contemporary Latin American ﬁlms, which display neorealist features. Despite the apparent break with fascism, neorealism was not as politically revolutionary as to exert widespread social change. Rather, its ideological ﬂaw may be traced to the continuity in personnel, since those who had been fascists were absolved of their ideological sins as long as they were useful in the ﬁlmmaking process. In the 1950s, Italian cinema’s re-entry into the market was facilitated by a number of measures that encouraged directors to move away from neorealist themes.10 In the 1960s and 1970s, Latin American ﬁlmmakers were adamant about distancing themselves from Hollywood economic and aesthetic considerations. Argentine and Brazilian directors of the period privileged theoretical and cinematic resources associated with social change. Those resources included 1920s Soviet montage as epitomized by Eisenstein; 1930s French poetic realism, which arose with the ephemeral Popular Front prior to World War II; Italian postwar neorealism; the British documentary tradition, which contributed to the articulation of a national identity as it privileged social responsibility; and Bertolt Brecht’s aesthetic and political views (Tal, 77). With the sole exception of French poetic realism, these resources inform La hora de los hornos, and they are ubiquitous in contemporary Latin American cinema.\n\nBook 1.indb 14\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nThe social critique of the Argentine cinema of the late 1960s was mirrored throughout the continent. Cinema Novo, the Brazilian manifestation of the New Latin American Cinema, was far from uniﬁed as a movement. Randal Johnson identiﬁes three diﬀerent periods of about four years each. The ﬁrst spans 1960–1964, when ﬁlmmakers contributed to the debate on the national question with ﬁlms about the country’s proletariat, often depicted in rural settings. During this ﬁrst period, Cinema Novo ﬁlmmakers hoped to raise consciousness regarding the process of social transformation. This stage would be epitomized by dos Santos’s Vidas secas and Glauber Rocha’s Deus e o diabo na terra do sol (Black God, White Devil, 1964). Aesthetically, Cinema Novo directors relied on overexposure, the hand-held camera, and nervous framing to present a fragmented narrative suggestive of the cruelty of the sertão and to posit an ethics based on images of pain and revolt (Bentes, 124). Their hopes were frustrated over the course of the second period, 1964–1968, as the country experienced an extremely repressive military rule. Thus, ﬁlms such as Rocha’s Terra em transe (Land in Anguish, 1967) and dos Santos’s Fome de amor (Hunger for Love, 1968) turned their focus toward the urban middle class in an attempt to understand the failure of the Left. The last phase, 1968–1972, saw the tightening of censorship and the institution of torture, so Cinema Novo ﬁlmmakers opted for allegorical ﬁlms such as Joaquín Pedro de Andrade’s Macunaíma (1969) and dos Santos’s Azyllo muito loco (The Alienist, 1970) (Johnson, Cinema Novo × 5, 2–3). This last phase encompassed two vastly diﬀerent manifestations. The cannibal-tropicalist practice alluded to the government’s genocidal measures by emphasizing kitsch and the grotesque (tropicalism) but also by suggesting that Brazil should ﬁguratively devour foreign enemies and thus appropriate their force (cannibalism). Udigrudi (underground), the second practice, was aimed at marginality and intended to shock the audience by identifying with rebellious lumpen characters as well as by radicalizing Rocha’s aesthetics of hunger (Johnson and Stam, 37–39). Like other national cinematic traditions, Cinema Novo mapped national experience in order to arrive at a general diagnosis of the country’s malaise. Social criticism coupled with aesthetic rupture alienated audiences who expected naturalism and a didactic cinema. The formal innovations of young ﬁlmmakers linked them to the modernist tradition. While some ﬁlmmakers resorted to allegories, Cinema Novo introduced intertextual references that conveyed political engagement opaquely. Into the\n\nBook 1.indb 15\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n16\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nlate 1960s, Brazilian ﬁlmmakers thus moved away from a utopian impulse and a social teleology of redemption. By the 1970s Brazilian ﬁlmmakers accepted underdevelopment as a state of being, in plots that turned on family dramas and frustrated characters both poor and rich whose lives ended calamitously (Xavier, 41). As this brief survey of aesthetics, directorial schools, collaborative ventures, and national trends would suggest, the New Latin American Cinema was political, above all. After the 1964 coup d’état, Rocha established a connection between Brazil and the rest of Latin America based on the region’s shared dependency. Rocha’s interpretation of social reality was resonant for Solanas, Getino, and Vallejo, who used dependency theory to explain the undernourishment of the Argentine rural population. It was in this context that Rocha’s “aesthetics of hunger” was presented in Genoa, Italy, in 1965 to promote awareness of the exploitation of the colonized and to incite action to attain change, as Rocha concluded that the industrial and economic integration of Cinema Novo was contingent on Latin America’s liberation (Revolução, 66–67). Rocha took this rhetoric still further when he argued that Cinema Novo would arise wherever a ﬁlmmaker struggled against censorship, commercialism, exploitation, pornography, and to move past mere displays of technical virtuosity (67). Around 1969 García Espinosa called for what he termed an “imperfect cinema” predicated on the need to focus on the problem as process, not just because personal analysis is always already marred by a priori value judgments but because it precludes input from the interlocutor (14–15). In their 1973 book Cine, cultura, y descolonización, Solanas and Getino posited a “third cinema,” a “militant cinema” that would tackle particular historical conditions over the course of contributing to the process of continental liberation (89). Among the leading ﬁlm directors who shared the views expounded by Rocha, Solanas, and Getino were Bolivian ﬁlm director Jorge Sanjinés and Cuban ﬁlmmaker Julio García Espinosa. Each emphasized the need for collective analysis of the underlying causes of the people’s struggle. For his part, in 1979 Sanjinés argued against providing a priori judgments: he pointed to how predetermined conditions that structure subjectivity inﬂuence the individual’s apprehension of reality. Instead, Sanjinés suggested analyzing the dialectic relation between the people’s struggle and popular art, so that art could thereby become an instrument of liberation. As collective and revolutionary, popular art would therefore represent a particular culture’s weltanschauung (Sanjinés and Grupo Ukamau, 79–80).\n\nBook 1.indb 16\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nLikewise, reﬂecting on the Cuban experience in 1982, Gutiérrez Alea’s “viewer’s dialectic” argued for transforming the passive and complacent audience into one ready to engage in meaningful action. This would be achieved, he proposed, by presenting a socially productive spectacle that negated the false values crystallized in everyday reality: moved by pleasure, the audience would be attracted to the possible reality oﬀered by the spectacle (26–27). In other words, despite the generalized usage of the label “New Latin American Cinema,” each practice and theoretical position stemmed from a speciﬁc sociohistorical reality. For instance, despite the initial collective production, the ethnographic approach of the Cuzco School could not have diﬀered more from the cinematic production (and self-reﬂexive theorization) through which Jorge Sanjinés and the Ukamau Collective attempted to record indigenous reality. Although García Espinosa’s imperfect cinema also diﬀered from Gutiérrez Alea’s viewer’s dialectic, all of these directors’ theoretical positions shared certain traits, such as the urge to deploy ﬁlm as a tool for social change and an attitude of commitment that would further undermine Hollywood’s hegemonic model of production and reception. Therefore, I have chosen the term “New Latin American Cinema” to refer to Spanish American cinematic production of that period and “Cinema Novo” to refer broadly to its Brazilian counterpart.11 As the eﬀervescence of the 1960s was cut short by a series of coups that installed state terrorism in Brazil (1964–1985), Chile (1973–1990), Argentina (1976–1982), and Uruguay (1973–1985), state censorship— worsened by disappearances and torture—exile, and self-censorship stymied cinematic production. The forceful institutionalization of neoliberal economic policies resulted in a widening economic gap that, coupled with the withdrawal of the welfare state, led to signiﬁcant decreases in the standard of living, a phenomenon referred to as “the lost decade,” during which, for example, Argentine cinematic production was drastically curtailed. The few quality productions include Mario Sábato’s El poder de las tinieblas (Power of Darkness, 1979), a highly metaphorical ﬁlm about ubiquitous fear. Piedra libre (Free for All, 1976) by the paradigmatic auteur Leopoldo Torre Nilsson was considered subversive and underwent signiﬁcant cuts prior to being released. Adolfo Aristarain’s industrial Tiempo de revancha (Time for Revenge, 1981), an allegory about the omnipresent power of the military juntas, centers on a worker who succeeds in resisting exploitation. The production of political ﬁlms resumed with the return of democracy.\n\nBook 1.indb 17\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n18\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nJuan José Jusid’s Asesinato en el Senado de la Nación (Murder in the Senate, 1984) critiques government corruption by alluding to a shady deal involving the sale of meat to Britain with the connivance of the maﬁa in 1935. María Luisa Bemberg’s melodramatic Camila (1984) portrays the tragic end of Camila O’Gorman during the 1840s dictatorship of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Luis Puenzo’s La historia oﬁcial (The Oﬃcial Story, 1985) tackles the thorny issue of the appropriation of the children of the disappeared and was awarded an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, the ﬁrst garnered by a Latin American country (Schumann, 36–45).12 The rampant neoliberalism of Carlos Saúl Menem’s administration (1989–1999) had a nefarious impact on Argentine cinema. Most of the ﬁlmic production was unabashedly commercial, but some ﬁlmmakers ensured international distribution by relying on co-productions and the cachet of foreign actors. The cast of Bemberg’s Yo, la peor de todas (I, the Worst of All, 1990), an Argentine-French venture on Mexican nun, author, and protofeminist Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1648–1695), included Assumpta Serna of Spain and Dominique Sanda of France. Lita Stantic’s Un muro de silencio (A Wall of Silence, 1993), which addresses the disappearance of the legendary ﬁlm producer’s partner by way of a complex structure of a play within a play, involves Argentina, Mexico, and Britain and depends on Vanessa Redgrave’s prestige. Martín Rejtman’s El rapado, a co-production involving Argentina and the Netherlands (1991, released in 1996), sports a minimalist aesthetics in the story of a youth who feels the need to steal a motorbike after his has been stolen. This ﬁlm exerted a powerful inﬂuence on a new generation of ﬁlmmakers (Maranghello, 221–256). Alejandro Agresti, an auteur with more than seventeen feature ﬁlms who has enjoyed success in Argentina and in the Netherlands, where he lived in the early 1990s, is another inﬂuential precursor of the new Argentine Cinema. Though Agresti has made an industrial blockbuster ﬁlm, his contribution lies in the episodic structure and the improvisational nature of his experimental black and white ﬁlms. Like Agresti, Esteban Sapir is another important precursor. Sapir’s black and white Picado ﬁno (1986), which follows the protagonist as he shirks his responsibility in the impregnation of his girlfriend, is groundbreaking in the use of intellectual montage to supersede dialogue. Argentina Despite policies intended to encourage national ﬁlm (such as legislating that a percentage of all screen time be devoted to nationally produced\n\nBook 1.indb 18\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nmaterials), few of the movies associated with the New Argentine Cinema, or the Independent Argentine Cinema, enjoyed oﬃcial subsidies. Due to economic diﬃculties, many of the ﬁlms were made in nonstandard formats such as 16mm, black and white, digital video, Beta, and Super VHS, and most were shot on location with nonprofessional actors (Bernardes, Lerer, and Wolf, 10). The stories tend to be representative of that generation because they are, for the most part, personal. Among the most salient features of the New Argentine Cinema is the slang used throughout the dialogue. Many of the ﬁlms are set in the city, depicting an urban space that becomes strange due to the inscription of social, cultural, or religious ghettoes or to the uncanny persistence of the past into present-day life. So do characters, locations, and forms of speech blur the limits between ﬁction and the documentary in the work of these directors (S. Wolf, “Aesthetics,” 31, 34–35). In sum, rather than unabashedly identifying with European-inﬂuenced culture as their modern antecessors had done, more recent ﬁlmmakers portray ethnic minorities and working-class people, projecting a more complex understanding of national identity in Argentina (Falicov, Cinematic Tango, 133). Brazil The importance of Embraﬁlme, a state enterprise involved in ﬁlm production and distribution, was decisive as of 1974. Coupled with legislation regarding screening quotas—movie theaters had to show Brazilian ﬁlms 133 days per year—this state agency ensured the ongoing development of Brazilian cinema. For the most part, the pornochanchadas, vapid erotic comedies of the 1970s that oﬀered a picture of a decadent bourgeoisie, were superseded by an interest in the popular toward mid-decade. Dos Santos was one of the various cultural agents to spearhead the renewed interest in popular culture, envisioned as the cultural expression of the people. Though the controversy over “popular” and “populist” has yet to be settled, Brazilian cinema succeeded in making accessible avant-garde ﬁlms (Johnson and Stam, 40–50). While the escapism aﬀorded by the pornochanchadas continued unabated in the 1980s, the decade also saw a series of movies focused on political violence and state repression. Most importantly, cinematic production was no longer restricted to metropolitan areas (São Paulo, Rio) but migrated toward Bahia, Pernambuco, Minas Gerais, and other places (Schumann, 116–117). In Brazil, a new audio-visual law promulgated in 1993 prompted a boom in ﬁlm production that became known as the “Retomada do Cinema\n\nBook 1.indb 19\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n20\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nBrasileiro,” the rebirth or boom of Brazilian cinema (Nagib, introduction to Cinema da Retomada, 13). The current echoes of emblematic Cinema Novo subjects and spaces such as the sertão reveals certain continuities in the concerns of Cinema da Retomada ﬁlmmakers.13 As contemporary ﬁlmmakers are more skeptical than their Cinema Novo predecessors with regard to the national-popular issue, they have resorted to allegorical representations of politics (Xavier, 41). Still other oblique venues have included love stories, generational conﬂicts, and murder mysteries. Most of the recent ﬁlms focus on the nation’s recurring fault lines: national history, the violence arising from the social class system, and interaction with the other—including foreigners (Oricchio, Cinemadenovo, 232). Cuba In Cuba the exploration of the ﬁrst decades after the revolution was, with a few exceptions, superseded by a crisis in representation that led back to traditional formats. Hasta cierto punto (To a Certain Point, 1983), Gutiérrez Alea’s attempted thesis ﬁlm, establishes a counterpoint with the profound ideological critique of Gómez’s De cierta manera. The 1980s closed with two formally rewarding self-reﬂexive ﬁlms: Juan Carlos Tabío’s quirky comedy ¡Plaﬀ ! O demasiado miedo a la vida (Too Afraid of Life, or Splat, 1988) parodies the allegories of the nation embodied by female characters, while Orlando Rojas’s Papeles secundarios (Supporting Roles, 1989) employs the performance of shifting identities ranging from sexual orientation to Afro-Cuban magic—all is reﬂected through the multiple connotations of a theater (Chanan, 436–437, 440–441). As perestroika destabilized the Cuban economy between 1989 and 1993,14 there were frequent blackouts and food shortages. Severe gasoline rationing brought about huge cuts in public transport, and bicycles were imported from China. The new constitution of 1992, which modiﬁed the concept of property, heralded economic recovery as the dollar was legalized, land ownership was transferred to agricultural cooperatives, and selfemployment became an option. While markets for agricultural produce and industrial and artisanal products became available, economic growth was stimulated by foreign investment, especially in tourism. Though the ICAIC kept its annual festival going, the end of state subsidies led to an exodus of personnel, and production ground to a halt. As economic conditions forced the ICAIC to pursue international co-productions, Cuban ﬁlmmakers learned that European investors were interested in low-budget\n\nBook 1.indb 20\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nﬁlms that oﬀered an exotic view of the island presented by poorly remunerated but highly qualiﬁed labor—technical support and actors (Chanan, 447–448, 479–480). As the quest for co-productions led to more personal narratives, a growing number of ﬁlms aﬀorded possibilities for social critique (Young, 26). Mexico Mexican cinema has been subject to a number of presidential interventions designed to revitalize its productivity, in apparent decline since the so-called golden age. The stop-and-go development of the cinematic industry has, from the early 1950s, witnessed the introduction of measures to “save” it with a new model for each sexenio, or six-year presidential term. These oscillate between complete liberalism on the one hand and state monopoly on the other. As observed in King, López, and Alvarado (222), one total eﬀect has been to drive the industry, on the whole, into further crisis. The eﬀorts of President Luis Echeverría Álvarez oﬀer a case in point: to oﬀset the loss of conﬁdence resulting from the massacre of Tlatelolco in 1968, Echeverría appointed his brother Rodolfo to the Banco Cinematográﬁco. Rodolfo, in turn, founded the Cinemateca Nacional de México, the state ﬁlm archive, and established a ﬁlm school. Both actions gradually increased the role of the state in key aspects of production and exhibition. These measures were dismantled in the José López Portillo (1976– 1982) administration, while the following regime of Miguel de Lamadrid saw state neglect and rampant commercialism. Lastly, under duress, that is, aware of the privatization of state enterprises as a condition for NAFTA, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988–1994) had Ignacio Durán, the head of Imcine, the Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía, buttress state funding by seeking private-sector investments (King, “Cinema,” 516). Such inconsistency of policies on ﬁlm production and distribution in Mexico is an all too common feature in other Latin American countries like Brazil and Argentina. The renaissance of Mexican cinema was heralded by the unexpected, almost blockbuster success of Alfonso Arau’s Como agua para chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate, 1991). Arau’s adaptation of Laura Esquivel’s homonymous novel (1989) oﬀers the drama of an ill-starred love story, the authenticity of Hispanic customs, local color, a mixture of well-known and nonprofessional actors, and most importantly, a magical realism that\n\nBook 1.indb 21\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n22\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nreinscribes Latin America as exotic, fulﬁlling Euro-American expectations. In line with the plot’s conservative ideology, the protagonist’s power remains circumscribed to the kitchen. Moreover, in accordance with the stereotype of the self-destructive heroine, her suicide restores conventional order. In sum, Arau’s mainstream ﬁlm underscores the qualities of contemporary Mexican cinematic production, insofar as the movie is light and the plot revolves around private conﬂict (Torrents, 225). Mexican directors debuting in the early 1990s achieved acclaim at home and abroad because they relied on proven Hollywood genres, such as action or horror movies, which ensured international cross-over. A generation of professionally trained ﬁlmmakers were graduates of the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográﬁca or Centro de Estudios Cinematográﬁcos, institutions that allowed for collaboration with seasoned directors. These directors were savvy in seeking international funds and co-productions. For instance, the success of Alfonso Cuarón’s Sólo con tu pareja (Love in the Time of Hysteria, 1991) and Y tu mamá también (2001) led to his Hollywood productions Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and the futuristic dystopia Children of Men (2006). Likewise, the warm reception of Guillermo del Toro’s horror movie Cronos (1993) was the stepping-stone for two other ﬁlms set in Spain, El espinazo del diablo (The Devil’s Backbone, 2001) and El laberinto del Fauno (Pan’s Labyrinth, 2006), the last of which garnered Oscar nominations. The boxoﬃce success of the three interwoven stories in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Amores perros (Love’s a Bitch, 2000) led to Hollywood invitations to produce 21 Grams (2003) and to repeat the formula of interwoven stories in Babel (2006). Iñárritu’s Biutiful (2010), set in Barcelona, also garnered Oscar nominations. Paraguay In Paraguay, Argentine co-productions from the late 1930s to the late '50s gave way to state propaganda in the '60s, as epitomized by Guillermo Vera’s Cerro Corá (1977), which focused on the War of the Triple Alliance (1867–1970) but was in fact political propaganda aimed at promoting longtime dictator General Alfredo Stroessner’s fascist version of history. Recent successes include Claudio MacDowell’s large-scale co-production The Call of the Oboe (Paraguay-Brazil, 1998), a ﬁction ﬁlm entirely shot in Paraguay; Etcheverry’s El portón de los sueños (The Gate of Dreams, 1998), documentary-ﬁction about the most important Paraguayan writer,\n\nBook 1.indb 22\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nAugusto Roa Bastos; and Galia Giménez’s María Escobar (2001), a ﬁlm based on a popular Paraguayan song (Etcheverry, 157–159). Thus, given the lack of a strong national cinematic tradition, each production is hailed as the one and only Paraguayan ﬁlm. In a context of an industrial tradition, Encina’s directorial sophistication thrives due to the support garnered at international venues and by adding production incentives to the advantages of transnational co-productions. Peru Conversely, in Peru, General Velasco Alvarado’s 1968 leftist coup d’état fostered a series of social reforms, including the 1973 law that fomented national ﬁlm production. But the considerable boom was cut short by the 1975 conservative coup d’état. Francisco Lombardi and Federico García began their proliﬁc careers in the late 1970s. Lombardi, who trained with Fernando Birri in the Santa Fe documentary ﬁlm school in Argentina in 1968, released his ﬁrst feature-length movie, Muerte al amanecer (Death at Dawn), in 1977. While García examined indigenous and historical topics, Lombardi achieved commercial success by exploring social violence (Schumann, 276–277). At present, Lombardi is the most successful director, with more than ten feature ﬁlms to his name along with an Oscar nomination for Ojos que no ven (What the Eye Doesn’t See, 2003) (Middents, 40–42). Josué Méndez denies the existence of a Peruvian cinematic tradition. His ﬁrst feature ﬁlm, Días de Santiago (2004), was an independent venture. Claudia Llosa’s Madeinusa (2006), completed with funds from the Sundance Festival, heralded the arrival of a new generation of ﬁlmmakers who beneﬁt from international programs. Her second feature ﬁlm, a Catalan co-production, La teta asustada (Milk of Sorrow, 2010), earned a Golden Bear award at the Berlin festival and was nominated for an Oscar in 2010. Llosa’s directorial production evidences the need for engaging in the international circuit of ﬁlm festivals, seeking production funding or international co-productions. Like Llosa, Méndez has become keenly aware of the pressures involved in submitting well-deﬁned scripts and keeping to the deadlines of the international ﬁlm-festival circuit. Indeed, while still making a social statement, Méndez’s second ﬁlm, Dioses (Gods, 2008), is not experimental.15\n\nBook 1.indb 23\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n24\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nHYPOTHESES OF ORIGINS AND AESTHETIC SIMILARITIES Despite the inherent ﬂaws of generalizations, this brief summary of cinematic traditions allows for positing the following hypotheses. Silent movies arrived almost on the heels of the initial French showings. As a veritable cottage industry of producing newsreels, shorts, and feature ﬁlms, initial cinematic production involved friends and relatives or members of the higher social classes, but Hollywood asserted its hegemonic power early, with devastating eﬀects for the nascent national industries. In the meantime, relatively isolated from Spanish America, Brazil turned aggressively to the European avant-garde, as the cinematic production of Cavalcânti, Peixoto, and Mauro attests. The arrival of sound oﬀered new opportunities to the national cinematic production: in Mexican rancheras, Argentine tango ﬁlms, and Brazilian musicals like the chanchadas epitomized by Carmen Miranda. However, with the excuse of implicit support of the Axis, the United States strangled production in Argentina and Peru, cutting at once their imports of virgin ﬁlm stock and turning to Mexico for its propaganda machine. By importing the international studio model, Mexico arrived at its “golden era.” With Cavalcânti in the vanguard, ﬁlm directors like Birri turned to documentary in the 1950s. By the mid-1950s, the general mode was industrial, with the few exceptions of auteurs such as the hermetic Leopoldo Torre Nilsson, the ethnographic documentaries of the Cuzco School, and the ﬁrst ﬁlms made by Latin American directors who had been inﬂuenced by neorealism during their sojourns in Rome. After he returned to Brazil, dos Santos’s ﬁlms initiated Cinema Novo. The political fervor of the 1960s revolutionized cinematic production. Following the Soviet example, the Cuban Revolution turned to ﬁlm for the reproduction of ideology. Documentaries were favored, but feature ﬁlms followed, and some mixed the two genres. Both the New Latin American Cinema and Cinema Novo were marked by a variety of aesthetic and political manifestos: while each reﬂects the sociohistoric conditions of its inception, the mid-1970s was a bleak period. The violent repression of dissent manifested in such atrocities as the massacre of Tlatelolco and the disappearance of thousands of dissenters as well as innocent victims in the Southern Cone and Brazil, which were in the grip of state terrorism. Filmmakers went into exile. Few continued to produce ﬁlms at the same rate. Rampant commercialism ensued. Some ﬁlmmakers became more elliptical.\n\nBook 1.indb 24\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nThe 1980s marked the arrival of democracy and the end of state censorship, but neoliberalism had been instituted across Latin America. Policies geared to foster domestic cinematic production were systematically ignored. Cuba experienced the Special Period, starved by the unintended consequences of perestroika. Thus, for slightly diﬀerent reasons and with widely divergent results, Latin American ﬁlmmakers were forced to seek international funding in the way of co-productions. Paradoxically, the 1990s saw a veritable boom in the creation of ﬁlm schools across the continent. The directors who graduated from these schools were soon made aware of the need for international investment, so they heavily relied on the international cycle of ﬁlm festivals. While their production diﬀers widely, the New Argentine Cinema and Cinema da Retomada share certain aesthetic and thematic features. Despite the examples in this text and a penchant for certain neorealist qualities, current ﬁlmmakers seem to favor the industrial Hollywood model in an investment that has led to a number of Oscar nominations and two actual awards, the last being Argentine Juan José Campanella’s El secreto de sus ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes) in 2010. Neorealist practices made a comeback in the 1990s New Argentine Cinema and Cinema da Retomada. All of the directors featured in the following chapters make a point of shooting on location. Most of them work with casts made up at least partly of nonprofessional actors. While these practices manifest the inﬂuence of documentaries on the New Latin American Cinema, especially under the aegis of the Cuban Revolution, they have been labeled “ﬁctual faction” and realismo sucio (dirty realism).16 Thus, a considerable number of directors—Reygadas, Sorín, Pérez Valdés, and Menis among them—work with nonprofessional actors who play roles similar to those of their actual lives. This is particularly evident in the neorealist focus on the child—deﬁned with a certain latitude. Thus, Vinícius de Oliveira, a shoe-shine boy, plays Josué in Salles’s Central do Brasil. Agustín Alcoba plays Santi in Oliveira Cézar’s Como pasan las horas, and Agustín Ponce plays Orestes in Extranjera. In this text I discuss ﬁlms as well whose directors rely on professional actors to play the roles of actors, as in Pérez Valdés’s Madrigal. While the overwhelming presence of professional actors is also evident in Paz Encina’s Hamaca paraguaya, Oliveira Cézar’s Extranjera and El recuento de los daños maintain a balanced mix of professional actors and extras. The inclusion of nonprofessional actors may be ironic. Such is the case of\n\nBook 1.indb 25\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n26\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nLourenço Mutarelli, the author of the novel O cheiro do ralo, in the role of the security agent and the extras who anchor the ﬁlm’s structure of repetition with variation by attempting to pawn their belongings in Dhalia’s homonymous ﬁlm. In the more industrial neonoir movies only a few extras are nonprofessional actors, as in the scenes of the museum, the brothel, and the casino in Fabián Bielinsky’s El aura or the street and nightclub scenes in Jorge Furtado’s O homem que copiava and Méndez’s Días de Santiago. Occasionally the distinction between professional and nonprofessional actors is hard to make because of the range of national cinematic traditions I have included here. In addition, these ﬁlms share a focus on contemporary life, as epitomized in Oliveira Cézar’s work, wherein the enactment of certain customs (rituals in Como pasan las horas), lifestyles (in Extranjera), and rash actions (El recuento de los daños) alludes to the pattern of recurrent lifestyles across time periods and geographical distance. To an extent, all of the movies address current social issues—the failure of the state, for example—with the caveat that in Latin America the topic may not be considered current but rather the status quo. Nonetheless, the context for El aura as well as Bielinsky’s previous ﬁlm, Nueve reinas (Nine Queens, 2000), is impunity, given the widespread corruption illustrated by the phrase “Todos roban” (Everyone steals). Sorín and Menis focus on the lack of opportunities for rural workers, worsened by the withdrawal of the welfare state. Salles explores the dire predicament of homeless children. Furtado’s protagonists experience a lack of opportunities, but like Bielinsky’s, they are ready to take calculated risks to beat the system. Rather than deﬁning his identity by way of consumerism, Dhalia’s protagonist takes advantage of the lack of opportunities, yet his interactions are tainted by commodiﬁcation, while Oliveira Cézar’s Como pasan las horas suggests that ﬁnancial constrictions would only allow for crammed living conditions if the characters lived in the city. The failure of the state becomes that of the community in Extranjera, for co-optation in the sacriﬁce purportedly planned to alleviate a long-lasting drought is a thin disguise to distract group members from becoming aware of their leader’s failing powers. The failure of the state is fully evident in El recuento de los daños, which harks back to the disappearance of dissenters and the appropriation of babies born in captivity during the period of Argentine state terrorism (1976–1982). While Reygadas points to rural poverty and underdevelopment in\n\nBook 1.indb 26\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\nJapón and Batalla en el cielo illustrates the gaping abyss between social classes in urban Mexico, Stellet licht focuses on the harsh living conditions and the lack of reliable medical attention in isolated rural Mennonite communities. The desperate living conditions of contemporary Cubans, given the ultimate failure of the state, that is, of the revolution, is at the center of Pérez Valdés’s ﬁlms. Días de Santiago addresses the failure of the state to reincorporate its veterans. Among other factors, ubiquitous post-traumatic syndrome has a domino eﬀect that inﬂuences the predicament of the soldier as well as of his relatives. Insofar as war results from the failure of the state to arrive at a diplomatic solution, the resulting trauma engulfs the nation, symbolized by the peasant couple in Hamaca paraguaya (2008).\n\nGILLES DELEUZE AND CINEMA As is evident in the English versions of Deleuze’s Cinema 1 and Cinema 2, his approach to ﬁlm is based on the fundamental categories of time, movement, and the interval. Actually, Deleuze was inspired by the similarity that Henri Bergson drew between movement and cinematographic illusion. In establishing diﬀerences between space and movement, Bergson posits that movement is present and space covered is past and inﬁnitely divisible. Movement, by contrast, cannot be divided without changing qualitatively as it is being divided. Developing these Bergsonian premises, Deleuze argues that two instants can be brought together to inﬁnity, but movement always occurs in the interval between them. Despite the subdivision of time, movement always occurs in a concrete qualitative duration. Cinematic technique has changed signiﬁcantly since Bergson’s time. Initially, the sections, or images, were made to pass consecutively through the apparatus on the basis of a uniform, invisible movement. As montage and the mobile camera emancipated movement from the viewpoint of projection, the shot would no longer be a spatial but a temporal category. The section would no longer be immobile but mobile (Cinema 1, 1, 3). Deleuze’s notion of the movement-image develops from Bergson’s third thesis on movement and change, which is based in turn on the rationale that movement is a translation in space that involves a qualitative change in the whole. Yet the whole is open because its nature is to change constantly, which is reﬂected in duration. While sets deﬁned as discernible objects are subject to movement, which modiﬁes both their respective positions and the duration or the whole, the whole in turn is a spiritual real-\n\nBook 1.indb 27\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n28\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nity that constantly changes according to its own relations. Therefore, one aspect of movement is what happens between objects or parts; another is that which expresses the duration or the whole. By changing qualitatively, duration is divided into objects. By gaining depth, objects are united in duration. Therefore, movement relates the objects between which it is established to the changing whole that it expresses, and vice versa. Though the objects are immobile, movement relates them to the duration of a whole that changes. Unlike instantaneous images—immobile sections of movement—movement-images are mobile sections of duration, while time-images include duration-images and change-images (8–11). As a system that includes sets, characters, and props, the frame is conceived as a dynamic construction, closely linked to the scene in D. W. Griﬃth’s iris method, which isolates a face prior to opening up to show the surroundings. The out-of-ﬁeld introduces the transpatial and the spiritual into the system through duration. For instance, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s method closes the image spatially. By reducing it to two dimensions, Dreyer allows for the introduction of the fourth dimension, time, and even of the ﬁfth, spirit. Conversely, Alfred Hitchcock’s frames include the maximum number of components in the image. Yet, as the components are open to a play of relations, the mental image becomes pure thought (11–13, 17–18). While cutting (decoupage) determines the shot, the shot determines the movement established between the parts of the set within the closed system, expressing in turn a change of the whole. Insofar as the shot relates movement to a whole that changes, the shot is the movement-image. Originally, the ﬁxed camera deﬁned the frame by a frontal point of view, that of the spectator. To this extent, the shot indicates “a slice of space” that varies from close-up to long shot. In the case of these immobile sections, movement remains attached to the elements that serve as its vehicle. Therefore, the whole is identical to the set, in that the movement goes through as it passes from one spatial shot/plane (plan) to another (22, 24). Encina’s experimental aesthetics greatly depends on the initial use of the ﬁxed camera, which is why Deleuze’s thoughts are so appropriate. Deleuzian Montage When Deleuze deﬁnes “montage” as the determination of the whole, he stresses the composition of movement-images that constitute an indirect image of time, within the organic montage of the American school, Soviet dialectic montage, the quantitative style of the prewar French school, and\n\nBook 1.indb 28\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n29\n\nthe intensive trend of German expressionism. While Bielinsky and Oliveira Cézar hint at German expressionism in their montage, the other three schools have proven to be the most inﬂuential in the ﬁlms discussed in this book. D. W. Griﬃth conceived the composition of movement-images as a great organic unity that included diﬀerentiated parts set as binary relationships that allowed for parallel alternate montage. The close-up endows the objective set with subjectivity by showing how the characters live their scenes. Finally, a conﬂict must arise, only to be overcome. In Griﬃth’s time, montage required the alternation of diﬀerentiated parts, of relative dimensions, or of convergent actions. Usually, the confrontation and restoration of peace would take the form of a duel or of the convergence of actions. Eisenstein’s dialectical method modiﬁes Griﬃth’s organic montage in that it replaces opposition with the notion of an internal motive as a force that divides the unity, leading to a new unity on another level. However, this unity may arise from the pathetic passage of the opposite into its contrary. In the case of a pathetic jump, such as from sadness to anger, from doubt to certainty, or from resignation to revolt, the power of the ﬁrst stage is transferred to the second. The transition generates an upsurge of a new quality. Yet, the pathetic jump involves a change in form. Eisenstein suggested a change of dimension, a transition from nature to man and a quality born from the transition by resorting to series of enlarging close-ups. In the French sublime school, montage is based on the interval, a variable and successive numerical unit that enters into metrical relationships with other factors. Where the interval deﬁnes the greatest relative quantity of movement, the whole becomes so immense that it confronts the imagination with its own limit (Cinema 1, 29–48). In sum, by putting the cinematographic image into a relationship with the whole, montage gives an indirect image of time. As an individual movement-image it is the variable present. In the whole of the ﬁlm, montage stands for the immensity of future and past, as the variable present could become interval, a qualitative leap, while the whole could become organic whole, dialectical totalization, measureless totality (55). Deleuzian Movement-Image and Its Variations Also important to the Latin American directors who inscribe and subvert the classic Hollywood model, as epitomized by the noir penchant of depicting the protagonist’s reasoning and evident in Bielinsky’s El aura,\n\nBook 1.indb 29\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n30\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nFurtado’s O homem que copiava, and Dhalia’s O cheiro do ralo, is the notion of the movement-image. Deleuze introduces the movement-image by reminding us that Bergson posits a state of things in constant change, with no center of reference, wherein image equals movement. Though the set is deﬁned as image, everything is indistinguishable from its actions and reactions, including human beings, viewed in terms of constantly renewed molecules and atoms. In this inﬁnite set, movement-image and ﬂowingmatter are one and the same. Furthermore, as a block of space-time, this plane of immanence includes the movement established between the parts of each system as well as between one system and another, which prevents them from being closed. Despite the interrelation of movement, it is possible to speak of images because perception and language allow us to distinguish bodies (nouns), qualities (adjectives), and actions (verbs). In order to arrive at these distinctions, movement is replaced with an idea of a place toward which it is directed, a persisting state, or a vehicle to carry it out, respectively. This process leads to the formation of action-images, aﬀection-images, and perception-images (Cinema 1, 57–58, 60). — The notion of the interval acquires especial signiﬁcance in the work of experimental Latin American auteurs such as Reygadas, whose ﬁlms call for active participation on the part of the audience in deciphering motivation and eliciting an aﬀective reaction. As everything impinges on everything else in this acentered universe, an interval—a gap between the action and the reaction—may appear at any point whatever. The interval is possible insofar as the plane of matter encompasses time. According to Bergson (in Deleuze, Cinema 1, 61), the interval deﬁnes a speciﬁc type of image, which receives actions in certain parts and executes reactions in others. This specialization, deﬁned as “receptive” or “sensorial,” exerts an eﬀect on the inﬂuencing images. If living beings consider external inﬂuences indiﬀerent, they let them through (62); however, the isolated ones become perceptions. After certain actions are isolated, they come to be anticipated. Yet, the interval allows for delayed reactions, which rather than simply prolonging the excitation become actions, that is, something unpredictable or new. Images provide the black screen in the luminous aspect of the plane of matter. Yet, when the image runs up against an obstacle that reﬂects it, the image becomes a perception; therefore, the living image complements\n\nBook 1.indb 30\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n31\n\nthe center of indetermination or black screen. In other words, there is a double system of images. First, individual variations are complemented by the multifaceted interaction of all images. In the second system all images vary for a single one, which receives the actions of the other images on one of its facets and reacts to them on another facet. According to Bergson (62), this double system explains the working of the brain, since it is only on this plane that a single interval of movements can be produced. In other words, the brain is an interval, a gap between an action and a reaction. Through a process of elimination, the total, objective perception, which is indistinguishable from the thing, becomes a subjective perception. Moreover, when the movement-image is related to a center of indetermination, it becomes perception-image. The process is the following: when the universe of movement-images is related to one of these special images that forms a center in it, the universe is organized to surround it. Thus, perception leads to action in that action is the delayed reaction of the center of indetermination (64). The passage from movement-image to action-image is the second material aspect of subjectivity. Thus, as perception relates movement to “bodies” (nouns), action relates movement to “acts” (verbs) (65). In addition to a perceptive and active facet, the interval has an inbetween, occupied by aﬀection. The aﬀection-image arises in the subject as center of indetermination, between a perception that is somewhat troubling and a hesitant action. The aﬀection-image may be a coincidence of subject and object or a self-reﬂexive perception. In sum, it associates movement with a “quality” as lived state (adjective) (66). Through montage, movement-images give way to perception-images, action-images, and aﬀection-images; nonetheless, no ﬁlm is entirely made up of one type. Deleuze’s concept of the action-image is based on the notion of mental image, or thirdness, posited by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914). Thirdness, which may be understood in terms of signiﬁcation, law, or relation, originates acts such as exchanging that involve the symbolic eﬀect of a law. Additionally, thirdness results in perceptions, which refer back to meaning, and it involves intellectual feelings of relations. Deleuze’s movement-image is epitomized by noir. For instance, Hitchcock’s ﬁlms become the exposition of a rationale (reasoning). Yet, rather than focusing on the whodunit, these movies explore the system of actions in which the action and its author are enmeshed (Cinema 1, 197, 200).17 The action-image may\n\nBook 1.indb 31\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n32\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nresult in an indirect reﬂexive relationship, which occurs when rather than giving way to a suitable action, a situation produces a ﬁctitious action that preﬁgures an upcoming action (181). The Close-Up Deleuze prioritizes the aﬀective power of the close-up, which he identiﬁes with the face. The eﬀect results from the juxtaposition of a face that is seen and a body that is hidden. A reﬂecting, immobile unit presents intensive expressive movements that contrast with a closer implied corporeality. Following the painting tradition that focuses either on the face as an outline or on dispersed features functioning metonymically, such as quivering lips, Deleuze contrasts the reﬂexive face, which reﬂects a quality such as admiration or wonder, with the intensive face, which expresses power, deﬁned in terms such as desire or the conﬂict between love and hate. The French philosopher concludes that a series of intensive faces allows for passing from one quality to another and thus carries out a qualitative leap. By contrast, a reﬂecting face, frozen in a speciﬁc thought, remains immutable and thus eternal (Cinema 1, 87–91). Aﬀective ﬁlms allow for a slippage that mimics the sliding of the signiﬁer, caught in the endless play of diﬀerence and deferral of diﬀérance. The event itself goes beyond its own causes, referring to other eﬀects, while their causes, in turn, fall aside. Rather than referring to the state of things, the aﬀect refers to the faces that reﬂect it, as Deleuze argues in referring to Dreyer’s La passion de Jeanne d’Arc (The Passion of Joan of Arc, 1928). This is above all an aﬀective ﬁlm, as the philosopher contends that despite the historical events, characters, and relationships, there is something that allows for the constant intersection of the two presents, articulated as the endless arrival of the one while the other is already established (106). In terms of technique, Deleuze emphasizes Dreyer’s practice of cutting close-ups, which alternate between cutting an image such as a toothless sneer into a face or having the frame cut a face horizontally, vertically, or obliquely or even cutting movements in their course. By isolating a face in a partly ﬁlled close-up, Dreyer introduces a virtual conjunction that precludes real human connection. Aﬀective cutting involves Dreyer’s signature ﬂowing close-ups, which may be deﬁned as a continuous movement from the close-up to the medium or full shot. Deleuze argues that by ﬂattening the third dimension, Dreyer connects the second dimension with the aﬀect as well as with the fourth dimension, time, and the ﬁfth dimension, spirit (106–107). Conversely, the out-of-ﬁeld also subverts everyday\n\nBook 1.indb 32\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n33\n\nnotions of space and time by generating the impression of a disturbing presence, situated as disturbingly close but still out of reach (17). Deleuze, Neorealism, and the Time-Image Endorsing Bazin, Deleuze argues that neorealism should not be deﬁned by its social content but by the representation of a type of dispersive reality, presented in blocks and linked with deliberately weak connections. Deleuze goes beyond the movement-image by suggesting that the goal of neorealism is to connect them to thought, not to extend perceptions into actions. Thus, neorealism is associated with a build-up of optical and, later, sound situations that are diﬀerent from those of traditional realism; they are not anchored in a setting that presupposes an action but rather in “any space whatever,” that is, in disconnected bits of space. Consequently, the protagonist is entranced with a vision instead of being engaged in an action. As the visual description replaces the motor action, the situation becomes suﬀused with indeterminacy, and whether it is imaginary or not becomes irrelevant (Cinema 2, 1–7). — According to Deleuze, a number of social, political, moral, and cultural factors brought about the crisis of the traditional cinematic image after World War II. He points to the crisis of the American Dream, the growing awareness of minorities, the overwhelming explosion of images in the world around us, the impact of cinematic productions, and the decadence of Hollywood and its genres. A new aesthetics, marked by the voyage form and the ensuing condemnation of plot, the dispersive situation, and deliberately weak links as well as the consciousness of clichés, appeared ﬁrst in Italian neorealism and subsequently in the French New Wave. Rather than focusing on causal relations, the new aesthetics that Deleuze engaged explored the situation itself, emphasizing the dispersive nature of reality (Cinema 1, 206, 210). As the ideological construction of the protagonist changed, the character became a kind of ﬂâneur vested in recording reality rather than reacting to it (Cinema 2, 3). This set of circumstances had an impact on all of the ﬁlms that comprise the corpus of this book, which share conventions dear to the documentary and neorealism such as shooting contemporary, true-to-life subjects on location, capturing language in the vernacular, and focusing on social critique. At the same time, the range of movies highlighted in this text allows for variations of other technical conventions, such as natural\n\nBook 1.indb 33\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n34\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nlighting, lengthy takes, and unobtrusive editing. While all of these ﬁlms demand active viewer involvement, certain conventions—respect for the continuity of time and space, a predominance of medium and long shots, for example—are more evident in noir ﬁlms.18 Most of the remaining ﬁlms stress the importance of an uncontrived, open-ended plot, and for this reason they favor the loose structure implied by a journey taken by protagonists depicted as seers rather than agents. As we shall see, these latter ﬁlms illustrate the possibilities opened by the Deleuzian time-image. Recollections and Dreams As an introduction to the diﬀerent types of time-images, we shall explore the nature of recollections and dreams. Bergson (in Deleuze, Cinema 2, 44) distinguishes between two types of recognition, namely, automatic and attentive recognition. In automatic or habitual recognition, perception extends itself into habitual movements. Through association of images we pass from one object to another along the same plane (synchronically). Conversely, attentive recognition focuses on some characteristic features of the object. As we identify diﬀerent features, the object passes through diﬀerent planes (diachronically) so that the sensory-motor image seems richer because it is the object itself, while the pure optical (and sound) image seems poorer because it is a description (44). The postwar image heralded a paradigm shift. To the extent that the sensory-motor image retains the features that interest us and its richness arises from the association with similar objects on the same plane, it is an agent of abstraction. Conversely, since the pure optical image is a description and the character may not be able to react to the situation, the minimal features retained by this image emphasize its particularity and the endless possibility of referring to others, which in turn underscores its richness (45). Furthermore, according to Bergson, the optical (and sound) image of attentive recognition calls up a recollection-image. Although the related terms diﬀer in nature, they refer to each other and ultimately slip into indeterminacy. Thus, a zone of recollections, dreams, or thoughts corresponds to a particular aspect of the thing as each circuit paradoxically obliterates and creates an object at the level of the same mental reality, memory, or spirit (46). In the process, the sensory-motor images and their extensions are superseded by circular links between pure optical and sound images, and images from time and thought, on coexisting planes (47).\n\nBook 1.indb 34\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n35\n\nTo determine the role of the virtual image Deleuze resorts to Bergson’s “recollection-images,” which are involved in automatic recognition in that they insert themselves between simulation and response, contributing to the adjustment of the motor mechanism by providing psychological causality. In sum, recollection-images allow for a new kind of subjectivity. Subjectivity emerges in the movement-image as soon as there is a gap between a received movement and an executed movement, that is, between a perception-image and an action-image. Aﬀection is a dimension of subjectivity because it belongs to the gap but without ﬁlling or fulﬁlling it. Conversely, the recollection-image ﬁlls the gap to the extent that it returns us to perception rather than extending into movement. Thus, subjectivity is no longer motor or material but temporal and spiritual (47). The relation of the actual image to recollection-images is evident in the ﬂashback, which may act as a closed circuit going from the present to the past, only to return to the present. Or it may react as a multiplicity of circuits, each of which goes through a zone of recollections and returns to an even deeper state of the present situation. Therefore, the ﬂashback can indicate psychological causality that, due to its similarity with sensorymotor determinism, conﬁrms the linear progression of narration (48). More importantly, by suggesting an inexplicable secret, the ﬂashback may fragment linearity by introducing forks that break causality (49). Thus, time’s forks provide ﬂashback with a necessity, and recollection-images with an authenticity, a weight of the past without which they would remain conventional (50). Dream sequences are not a common feature of Hollywood movies; au contraire, Soviet cinema, German expressionism, and the French school represented psychic phenomena to break away from the American limitations of the action-image. Dream images tend to be depicted by dissolves, superimpositions, complex camera movements, special eﬀects, or montage (55), to suggest an unhinging that resembles a dream, while the objects remain concrete (58). Yet breaking away from classical cinema, avant-garde directors like Federico Fellini (1920–1993) in 8½ (1963) disallow any transition between the representation of dreams and so-called reality. Images of Time Speaking about montage Deleuze notes that as a measure of movement, time includes two aspects: chronosigns and the interval. As a great circle or spiral, chronosigns draw together the set of movements in the universe.\n\nBook 1.indb 35\n\n11/29/12 10:23 AM\n\n36\n\nExperimental Latin American Cinema\n\nConversely, the interval indicates the smallest unit of movement or action. Thus, the bird that hovers, increasing its circle, illustrates time as a whole, and the beating of its wing represents a numerical unit of movement, the diminishing interval between two actions (Cinema 1, 32). The images presented by the cinema are surrounded with a world; that is, their circuits unite actual images with recollections, dream images, and world images. As the smallest unit, the crystal-image emerges from the Bergsonian coalescence between the actual and virtual images of an object (Cinema 2, 68). This is as if a real object reﬂected itself in a mirror image as a virtual object that engulfs the real, blending both images into one. This coalescence may be further described as if the image of the mirror came to life, even though the actual image resumed its place in the mirror, paradoxically pursuing the double movement of freedom and capture (68). This indiscernibility between the real and the imaginary and/ or the present and the past is evident in the crystal-image (69). While the actual image is the present, the virtual image, reﬂected on the mirror, constitutes its simultaneous past. Given the parallel process of perception and recollection, our lives mirror themselves in a virtual existence as they unravel in time (79). The crystal-image emerges from the most fundamental operation of time, for the present splits into two directions: one makes the present pass on, and the other preserves all the past. In sum, time consists of this split, and time is what we see in the crystal (81). In order to introduce the notion of sheets and peaks of time, Deleuze warns against confusing the past with the mental existence of recollection-images that actualize it. Following Bergson’s model of time as an inverted cone, Deleuze notes that "
