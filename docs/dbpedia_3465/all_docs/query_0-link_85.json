The fact that the process of editing this book has remained such a pleasure is due to the remarkable efforts of a large number of people. Our thanks must first go to Lucrecia Martel, not only for the dazzling, challenging and mysterious films that she has given to the world, but also for being such a thoughtful and generous interlocutor. We are very grateful to the editors of ReFocus: The International Directors Series, Robert Singer, Stefanie Van de Peer and Gary D. Rhodes, for their unwavering encouragement and helpful feedback since the earliest days of this project. At Edinburgh University Press, Gillian Leslie, Richard Strachan and Sam Johnson have all helped to make the publication process as smooth as possible, and we are very thankful for their efforts in these complicated times. Many people have assisted with obtaining copies of films, the acquisition of rights and the reproduction of images, among them Benjamín Domenech and Brenda Erdei at Rei Cine, Vania Catani at Bananeira Filmes, Sebastián A. Pérez at Lita Stantic Producciones, Michelle Petit de Meurville at ENERC, Mariana Amieva and Marília-Marie Goulart. We are very grateful to them all. Our thanks are also due to Mariana Casullo Amado, Liza Casullo Amado, Gerardo Yoel, Victoria Álvarez and Virginia Flôres.

Julia Kratje would like to thank Marina Etcheverrigaray and Ricardo Kratje. A book would of course be nothing without its authors, and the editors cannot thank them enough for their insights, patience and persistence as we have worked together to make this volume a reality.\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 15\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 16\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\nchapter\n\n1\n\nMetamorphosis and Persistence: An Introduction Natalia Christofoletti Barrenha, Julia Kratje and Paul R. Merchant\n\nT\n\nhe name ‘Lucrecia Martel’ has, over the course of a career spanning more than thirty years, found itself associated with a strangely consistent set of epithets. The Argentine film director and her work are described as ‘opaque’, ‘enigmatic’, ‘ambiguous’ and ‘beguilingly peculiar’ − indeed, all of these adjectives occur in just one article in Variety, published in 2020.1 Some of this language, particularly in its manifestations in the anglophone press, can be attributed to the exoticisation of a Latin American woman who has achieved the status of global auteur more often reserved for men hailing from the Global North. Yet there is no doubt that Martel’s body of work is in many senses unusual: alongside features that have won critical acclaim across the world are to be found short films, including one made for a clothing brand, and the art direction of a concert tour. An indication of Martel’s remarkable global status can be seen in a mural in Montevideo, Uruguay. The vast majority of neighbourhood cinemas in Uruguay, as in Argentina and elsewhere, have been demolished or converted into supermarkets, garages or churches, at the same time as a boom in internationally funded multiplexes and the removal of policies that encourage cultural diversity and protect cultural heritage. Yet in the heart of Montevideo can be found the Cinemateca Uruguaya, the last of the old cinemas on the city’s famed Avenida 18 de Julio to remain standing, thanks to its faithful audience. In April 2017, during the Tourism Week introduced by the secular state to coincide with the Christian Holy Week, and in the context of the 35th Festival Cinematográfico Internacional del Uruguay (Uruguay International Film Festival), the facade of this temple of cinema was renovated with a one-off mural, created by an\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 1\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n2\n\nb a r r e n h a , k r at j e a n d m e rc h a n t\n\nartistic collective. From left to right, gazing straight at the viewer, and holding a megaphone, a crow, a surrealist door and a photo camera respectively, the figures of Federico Fellini, Alfred Hitchcock, Luis Buñuel and Lucrecia Martel emerge from on high. As in religious prints, each has a halo, indicating their divine nature. Under the slogan ‘Festival empieza con Fe’ (‘Festival begins with Faith’),2 the profane devotion to cinema and its saints − the directors − was accompanied by prayers and commandments. ‘Oh Saint Lucrecia, patron of Argentine cinema and apostle of Latin American film, open your scripts to us, and let us enter your Swamp [‘Ciénaga’] so that we become soaked in reality’, intones a fragment that canonises Martel in the pantheon of universal filmmakers, with her cat-eye glasses and strikingly red nails. In addition to such popular expressions of admiration, Martel’s films have received critical acclaim, prestigious awards and significant scholarly attention, both in her native Argentina and among scholars of global cinema. Yet to date no one volume has set out to provide a comprehensive view of Martel’s work (whether in fiction, documentary or essayistic short film) and of the range of critical responses it can generate. The chapters in this collection are authored by some of the most prominent scholars of Martel’s films and by emergent voices, and offer a fresh set of perspectives (alongside two translations of landmark essays not previously available in English) that build on existing critical trends and suggest promising new avenues for research.\n\nFigure 1.1 Mural at the Cinemateca Uruguaya, in Montevideo: Fellini, Hitchcock, Buñuel and Martel. Photo by Mariana Amieva\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 2\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\nm e ta m o r p h o s i s a n d p e r s i s t e n c e\n\n3\n\na c a r e e r i n e va s i o n\n\nMartel was born in 1966 in Salta, a province on the border with Bolivia in the north-west of Argentina, about 1,500 km away from Buenos Aires. She was the second child among seven siblings and liked to stage Western films using her brothers and sisters as actors, while she operated a heavy camera that their father had bought to record his large family. Nobody had paid much attention to the machine, but Martel was curious about how it worked, read the user guide, as she liked to do with new tools, and went ahead with putting her freshly acquired knowledge into practice. As she has mentioned in several interviews,3 the filming experiences during her adolescence were fundamental for forming her gaze, even though she did not immediately realise it. The whole process of recording, understanding what was happening, and coming across things that were so different from what she was used to seeing on television began to interest her. The mundanity of domestic life, of chats between the mother, the children and the visitors, and the irrelevant facts of everyday existence drew Martel’s attention towards the off-screen world, the drift of the dialogues and the appearance of events that she thought she had not filmed but were there, on the edge of the frame. Despite having discovered something that fascinated her, she never imagined that her future would be related to it. Martel has remarked that her approach to the cinema as a possible career was the result of a misunderstanding:4 when she was a teenager, she followed the massive success of the Argentine blockbuster and Oscar nominee Camila (1984), directed by María Luisa Bemberg and produced by Lita Stantic, who used to appear on television, radio, everywhere, talking about the feature. She then registered the making of films as a form of women’s work, a universe inhabited and led by them. From a conventional middle-class, provincial home, where Catholicism was embraced and practised in non-orthodox ways, intertwined with popular beliefs, she studied in an ultraCatholic and elitist local school, chosen because it was the only place where she could learn Latin and Ancient Greek − a passion discovered through an uncle who was a priest. At the age of nineteen, after enrolling in different courses in different cities, she decided to go to Buenos Aires to study advertising. A new degree course at that time, it was taught only at a Catholic university, which made Martel, entirely disengaged from the Church at that moment, back out. She eventually began her studies in social communication at the University of Buenos Aires (another new course, launched after the dictatorship years that had badly harmed the press and its professionals) while also attending the Animation Film School at the Avellaneda Institute of Cinematographic Art. Shortly afterwards, she would join the very selective National School of Film Experimentation and Production (ENERC, in its Spanish acronym), maintained by the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts (INCAA).\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 3\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n4\n\nb a r r e n h a , k r at j e a n d m e rc h a n t\n\nWhen she arrived at ENERC, it had been hit by a lack of funds due to a severe economic crisis, and amidst the shortage of equipment, materials and staff, Martel and her colleagues improvised and experimented producing independent short films, learning by themselves and among themselves. The 56/El 56 (1988), 24th Floor/Piso 24 (1989) and Red Kisses/Besos rojos (1991) are among those collective exercises, copies of which are not now available. The first film signed by Martel as a writer and director was You Won’t Get Her, Bastard/No te la llevarás, maldito (1989), a two-minute university assignment with no dialogue about the revenge dreamt up by a boy against his mother’s boyfriend, in which she combines animation and live action via agile editing. It was followed by The Other/La otra (1989), a joyful documentary on the world of transvestites also developed during her period at ENERC. The song that Martel chose for the opening and closing sequences of The Other demonstrates, once again, her ability to grasp the sensitive fibres of popular culture and, like a puppet master, to make them dance among the dense layers of a film’s audiovisual weave. That song, Se dice de mí (‘They Say About Me’), is an endearing choice, one that evokes modes of feeling, thinking and acting that are deeply rooted in the collective imaginary of the Río de la Plata, across generations. Written in 1943, with lyrics by the Argentine Ivo Pelay and music by the Uruguayan Francisco Canaro, it was Tita Merello’s performance of the song in Mercado de abasto (Lucas Demare, 1955) that cemented its place in popular culture. Merello’s rustic timbre and rich contralto register, which brims with humour and determination, imbues the lyrics with rage and joyful abandon. ‘Se dicen muchas cosas, / mas si el bulto no interesa / ¿Por qué pierden la cabeza ocupándose de mí?’ (‘Many things are said, / but if the shape doesn’t matter / why do you lose your heads talking about me?’): this is the challenge that Merello daringly issues to her spectators (both diegetic and beyond the screen). This sensuous performance becomes part of The Other through Merello’s voice, to which a man playfully lip-syncs in a modest kitchen, without make-up, holding a mate gourd like a microphone. Martel’s short focuses on a small group of transvestites who recount their experiences, intercut with archive footage. The ten minutes of the film showcase a multitude of ways of inhabiting sex and gender, mixing artifice and nature, through pleasurable bodies that transgress binary distinctions between man and woman, masculine and feminine. ‘They may chatter, / they may talk / and whisper, and bray / but the ugliness God gave me / has been the envy of many women / and they won’t say I’ve fooled myself / because I’ve always been modest’, the song and the film conclude.5 ‘Yo soy así’ (‘That’s how I am’). Dead King/Rey Muerto (1995) was Martel’s first film produced in a more professional environment. Its script was selected in the first edition of Short Stories/Historias breves, a competition organised by INCAA to fund short films and nurture young filmmakers. Alongside Martel, Daniel Burman, Paula\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 4\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\nm e ta m o r p h o s i s a n d p e r s i s t e n c e\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.2 A scene from The Other, a short film directed by Martel during her studies at ENERC\n\nHernández and Ulises Rosell were among the awardees. The set of ten shorts was released in cinemas (something uncommon for the format), was critically acclaimed and drew the audience’s attention to this generation, becoming a landmark in the renewal of Argentine cinema in the mid-1990s that became known, at least by critics, as Nuevo Cine Argentino (New Argentine Cinema). New Argentine Cinema emerged driven by a series of factors, such as the creation of a law to promote and fund the audiovisual sector, the reactivation of a reserved screen quota in cinemas for Argentine films, the appearance and reopening of various film schools, and easier access to equipment due to exchange rate convertibility between the Argentine peso and the US dollar. These developments led to a rapid reactivation of the audiovisual sector, which became more dynamic than ever before. It is no surprise, then, that the formal characteristics of New Argentine Cinema are marked by the social and institutional upheavals that transformed the world of work and urban space in the 1990s, intensifying consumption, rendering audiovisual media and information networks omnipresent, and changing how sexuality was experienced. Yet the films also evince a desire to break with the traditions of industrial cinema, by eroding the boundary between documentary and fiction, involving new and non-professional actors, and using unconventional methods of financing and distribution. The films’ aesthetic characteristics, both by choice and by necessity, bear the marks of low-budget productions: hand-held cameras, for instance, or black and white footage. New Argentine Cinema films moreover eschew the large-scale political (and often metaphorical) narratives of directors like Eliseo Subiela or Luis Puenzo. Instead, the works of Pablo Trapero, Adrián Caetano, Martín\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 5\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n6\n\nb a r r e n h a , k r at j e a n d m e rc h a n t\n\nRejtman, Lisandro Alonso and others deal with marginal communities and small-scale, personal and unresolved narratives. The success of Dead King (which also travelled to several international film festivals) led Martel to work in television, where she was part of the team of the documentary series D.N.I. (1995) and the cutting-edge children’s show Magazine For Fai (1995–9), which was created by the Argentine musician, actor and entertainer Mex Urtizberea, and broadcast on Cablín, the first dedicated children’s television channel in Latin America. Set in the 1950s, Magazine For Fai has become an object of cult interest for adults. The programme imagines a world dominated by a corporation led by the pitiless Orwell For Fai. In this world, a cast of boys and girls between six and fifteen years old interact with Urtizberea on the basis of minimal script prompts, which then give way to improvisation games. While working in television, Martel also directed the documentaries Encarnación Ezcurra and The Outbuildings/Las dependencias, both part of Six Women/Seis mujeres, a six-episode series dedicated to exploring the life and work of six female Argentine personalities, broadcast in 1999. The series was produced by, among others, Lita Stantic, and was the first contact between the filmmaker and the legendary producer, thus leading to their partnership on The Swamp/La ciénaga (2001). Martel was having great difficulties getting financial support for The Swamp, an assembly of situations and characters inspired by family scenes and memories, provincial gossip and popular tales (elements that run through all her feature films). Stantic suggested sending the script to the Sundance Institute, which backed the project, opening up the path for other partners from Argentina, Europe and Japan. The Swamp premiered as part of the main competition at the 51st Berlin International Film Festival in February 2001 and won the Alfred Bauer Prize, which aimed to recognise ‘films that open up new perspectives in the field of cinematic art’, as described at the Berlinale website archives. In March, The Swamp was featured at the 16th Mar del Plata Film Festival, and from April, it was screened in Argentine movie theatres, reaching a national box office of about 130,000 viewers6 − not a phenomenon, but a significant figure for a debut filmmaker with such a demanding film. The prize at the Berlinale and international critical prestige made things easier for Martel in the journey to her second feature, The Holy Girl/La niña santa (2004). She was invited to the Cinéfondation residency, promoted by the Cannes Film Festival, and the Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar joined Stantic as a co-producer. The film received support from the prestigious Hubert Bals Fund, among other national and international institutions. The Holy Girl competed for the Palme d’Or at the 57th edition of Cannes, The New York Times included it amongst the ten best film releases in the United States that year, and it achieved 110,000 spectators in Argentina. Since then, Martel has\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 6\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\nm e ta m o r p h o s i s a n d p e r s i s t e n c e\n\n7\n\nbeen invited constantly to participate in film festival juries, deliver lectures and teach workshops worldwide. Her third feature, The Headless Woman/La mujer sin cabeza (2008), also opened in Cannes. The film had a cold critical reception during its press screening, a reaction largely disseminated through the media. This fact severely harmed its international distribution, and even in Argentina the film barely exceeded 30,000 viewers. Shortly thereafter, Martel would need to deal with another setback: the cancellation of her next project, an adaptation of the mythical sci-fi Argentine comic The Eternaut/El Eternauta (1957–9, written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and drawn by Francisco Solano López), due to a disagreement with the producers and rights-holders. After a while out of the spotlight, Martel started to receive substantial attention again. Although her work has never ceased to be prominent and steadily explored in academia, from 2010 onwards film festivals, film museums and cultural institutions at large began to request her presence. The Headless Woman was seen as unfairly misunderstood, and retrospectives of the frequently so-called Salta Trilogy popped up from Sarajevo to Harvard. In 2012, the renowned magazine Cinema Scope, celebrating its fiftieth issue, listed ‘The Best 50 Filmmakers Under 50’, and Martel was there, praised in an article signed by the distinguished Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Despite the continued excitement around her name, Martel would only release a new feature in 2017, at the 74th Venice International Film Festival: Zama, based on the homonymous novel by the Argentine writer Antonio Di Benedetto, published in 1956. Set in the late eighteenth century, it necessitated a more complex production structure that involved eight countries and several challenges throughout its process, especially regarding funding. Eventually, the film had a major enthusiastic critical reception internationally and enjoyed tremendous recognition in Argentina, where it was chosen to represent the country for the Goya and Oscar awards, gained almost 100,000 viewers, and was the most successful film at national ceremonies such as the Premios Sur and Cóndor de Plata. Zama represented a true film-event for both the cultural and cinematographic fields, giving rise to an engaging documentary filmed during the shoot (Light Years/Años luz, Manuel Abramovich, 2017), and a book that describes fascinating scenes and anecdotes about the film (The Monkey in the Whirlpool/El mono en el remolino, Selva Almada, 2017). Alongside these features, Martel has also directed several more recent short films. The documentary The City That Flees/La ciudad que huye (2006) was produced within the international initiative The Burgeoning City/La ciudad en ciernes.7 During 2006 and 2007, in different cities in Spain and Latin America, the project promoted seminars and exhibitions to draw attention to the right to the city and the relationship between urbanism and human rights. Martel’s\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 7\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n8\n\nb a r r e n h a , k r at j e a n d m e rc h a n t\n\nshort explores the phenomenon of gated communities in Buenos Aires, which for the filmmaker are remarkable and improbable. An on-screen anecdote confirms this: ‘Twenty years ago, scouting locations for a short film, we came across a gated community. What an absurd idea! This is not going to work, we thought.’ The incredulity in discovering, many years later, the extent to which such an idea has worked contaminates the film with amazement, reinforcing the illogic of these islands of wealth surrounded by poor suburbs. In an unstable shot, the opening scene depicts a private guard closing a gate to the crew, a situation that will be repeated more than once: gates, grids, guards, barbed wire, prohibitive signs, menacing voices. The City That Flees demonstrates the impossibility of making a film about a country (as the gated communities are called in Argentina, after the English term ‘country club’), while managing to capture the very essence of one. The camera is never allowed to enter: the barriers that obstruct people’s circulation also obstruct the film. The boundaries are rigid and non-negotiable (despite the attempts to ‘naturalise’ them with the inclusion of climbing plants or trees). Where there are no material borders, there are the security personnel, vigilant, as are the cameras. Maps, statistics and satellite images replace the lack of internal footage, so that the short adopts a quasi-scientific documentary mode that belies its highly political content. A narrator traces a brief history of this type of urbanisation: the loss of state interest in influencing the development of the city started in the dictatorship in the 1970s, deepened with the neoliberal mood of the 1990s, and resulted in the dismantling of the public transport network and the expansion of the highways. Together, these factors paved the way for real estate speculation and the privatisation of many sectors of life. These enclaves with golf courses and polo pitches, shopping malls and bilingual schools grew as fast as the social divide in Argentina at the end of the twentieth century. What The City That Flees keenly shows is that this gulf can be the width of a street, and as a result even more stark. The neighbours living across the road from the gated communities inhabit an entirely different landscape. When depicting this disparity, Martel splits the screen, and manages the rhythm of editing so that these differing images never appear at the same time, side by side. Despite the visible poverty outside the country, there is life, movement, colour and cheerful voices, in contrast to the nauseous travelling shot of the endless grey wall that surrounds the gated neighbourhood. Here, as in her other works, Martel displays a capacity to bend cinematic form in order to create a sense of what cannot be seen. Following The City That Flees, Martel directed a series of commissioned shorts that are still more unusual and unsettling. Fish/Pescados (2010) is a mesmerising and funny experiment involving chatty koi carp dreaming that they were once a car driving on a rainy night, which was made for Notodofilmfest (a Spanish online film festival). Martel collaborated with Argentine electro-folk musician Juana Molina to give voice to her characters. The eerie sensation that\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 8\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\nm e ta m o r p h o s i s a n d p e r s i s t e n c e\n\n9\n\nemanates from Fish is developed in Muta (2011), where Martel embraces the horror genre after having flirted with it in her previous features. Verging on science fiction, Muta is the second film in the ongoing Women’s Tales series, conceived by the Italian fashion company Miu Miu (part of the Prada conglomerate) in partnership with the Venice International Film Festival. Since 2011, the luxurious brand has invited both promising and established women filmmakers worldwide (Agnès Varda, Ava DuVernay, Hiam Abbas, Naomi Kawase and Mati Diop are among them) to create shorts in which the only condition is that the actors wear Miu Miu clothing. New Argirópolis/Nueva Argirópolis (2010) and Leagues/Leguas (2015) bring to the foreground the marginalisation of indigenous communities and the different ways in which they are often (and violently) disconnected from Argentine citizenship. The former belongs to the anthology 25 Looks, 200 Minutes/25 miradas, 200 minutos, for which the National Secretariat of Culture invited twenty-five filmmakers to produce shorts as part of the celebrations of the Bicentennial of the 1810 May Revolution (which ended effective Spanish rule in Argentina). The latter is part of the feature The Empty Classroom/El aula vacía, which explores the school dropout crisis across Latin America, and was the result of a collaborative effort by leading filmmakers from the region under the creative direction of Gael García Bernal. Over the course of her career, Martel has moved ever closer to the struggle of indigenous people in the north of Argentina, using her status as a renowned public figure in the region in order to be politically active alongside them. Since 2010, she has been working on the documentary Chocobar (working title), which explores the causes and consequences of the murder of indigenous leader Javier Chocobar in Tucumán in 2009. Although the images of his homicide circulated widely, the killers were convicted only in 2018, before being eventually released in 2020. In a few statements about the film publicised so far,8 Martel explains that she departs from the history of the Chocobar murder to reflect upon the construction of racist and oppressive discourses that allow crimes like this to continue in Argentina in particular and in Latin America in general. AI is another short commissioned by a film festival: it is the trailer for the 2019 Viennale. Here, Martel works with her well-known passion for YouTube, gathering and heavily manipulating footage found on the platform. The film is organised around a very brief excerpt from a popular and disturbing interview conducted in 1961 with a catatonic schizophrenic under treatment. The director reframes the image, keeping only a close-up of the interviewee, mutating him into a talking head, while blurring his face with a pixelated effect, which is commonly used to hide someone’s identity, as well as being a symbol of low-quality digital archives. Just one eye is left out of this intervention; a restless eye that seems trapped among those several small squares. The film’s succinct title leads the spectator to believe that they are watching some kind of artificial intelligence. This suspicion is bolstered by the disembodied, machinic voice and the subject’s\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 9\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n10\n\nb a r r e n h a , k r at j e a n d m e rc h a n t\n\naffirmation that ‘I am not completely like other people.’ However, the frightening and cryptic soundtrack in the background does not allow straightforward judgements. Glimpses of other videos suddenly assault the film: caressing hands, people playing the piano, famous ASMR sessions. As Ross McDonnell asks, would that be a dysfunction in the machine’s data set, or algorithmically generated hallucinations?9 Then, an inquisitive, insistent inquiry emerges: ‘What is it you are trying to do with your life?’ What human has never encountered this question hanging over their lives? To this very human affliction, we hear in reply another very human expression: the pursuit of a desire – ‘Play the piano for people.’ One cannot help thinking about Zama when watching AI. The phrase ‘What is it you are trying to do with your life?’ echoes from one film to the other. In the aforementioned article by McDonnell, Martel herself − always generous in providing insightful keys to delving into her work and world − gives a clue that could link Don Diego to AI’s mysterious character: ‘This particular futuristic monster of the short film has melancholy not for music, but for hands.’ Hands that Zama also lacks at the end of his journey. Martel has also been involved with projects in areas beyond cinema. In 2015, she directed the recording of the audio-short story collection Audio Library/ Audioteca, a project supported by the Argentine Ministry of Culture. Curated by the literary critic and screenwriter Graciela Speranza, the compilation gathered thirty short stories − which cross geographies and diverse generations of Argentine writers, from Sara Gallardo to Ricardo Piglia, from Hebe Uhart to César Aira, among others − narrated by thirty eminent actors. Released very discreetly, the anthology was available online for a brief period but published again on several platforms in 2020, when it garnered greater attention. In 2018, the filmmaker directed the music video for Julieta Laso’s song Fantasmas (‘Ghosts’), which was the flagship release from her album Martingala. Ghosts are a recurrent figure in Martel’s oeuvre: among their various manifestations, they move the tree branches on the side of the road in The Holy Girl, they live with Don Diego in a decrepit lodging in Zama, and they haunt both Vero and Aunt Lala in The Headless Woman. As in the films, in the music video she does not depict traditional ghosts but makes them present in a subtle way, a ghostly form of filming. The camera is not steady, but instead smoothly floats, while the ambience is old-fashioned and infused with a sort of smoke. Bathed in a faded light, Laso sings in the foreground, other women dance languidly around her, and shadows sporadically cross over their bodies. There are no direct cuts: instead, the images evolve through dozens of slow and gentle superpositions of the same situation. From the combination of these elements, Laso and the other characters acquire an ethereal nature as if they were spectres trapped in this glamorous decadent space. In 2019, Martel paired with another singer, the renowned Icelandic artist Björk, joining as the theatrical director of her concert Cornucopia, conceived from the album Utopia (2017). This ambitious sensory techno-acoustic spectacle,\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 10\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\nm e ta m o r p h o s i s a n d p e r s i s t e n c e\n\n11\n\nFigure 1.3 Lucrecia Martel with Daniel Giménez Cacho and Matheus Nachtergaele during the filming of Zama.

Indeed, the article in Variety with which we began suggests that a seemingly deliberate ambiguity and resistance to categorisation are two of the driving forces behind the vast attention that Martel’s work has received from film critics and scholars alike. It would be impossible to do justice to the full range of existing writing on Martel within the limitations of this format and in any case the authors of the chapters that follow are careful to acknowledge their debt to previous critical approaches, even as they suggest original and innovative readings. This volume nonetheless hopes to broaden and renew the conversation about this remarkable filmmaker, not least by drawing overdue attention to the formal\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 11\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n12\n\nb a r r e n h a , k r at j e a n d m e rc h a n t\n\ndiversity of her output, and at the same time identifying philosophical, political and aesthetic threads that run through her oeuvre. One such thread is a fascination with ‘limit points’ of all kinds: the limits of language, the limits of sensory perception, and the limits of empathy and affect. Rather than being viewed as an indicator of opacity, ambiguity or evasion, this insistent questioning of the limits of cinema might be seen as a liberating act. In this vein, in the following chapter, originally published in Spanish in 2004, Ana Amado reveals the way in which Martel’s first feature-length film frees its spectators from a temporality bound to the illusion of an unbroken chain of events. The temporal regime of The Swamp expresses itself through multiple durations and heterogeneous velocities; gestures, attitudes and postures that, as Amado demonstrates, are different for adults, with their dulled senses, to what they are for children and adolescents, who are animated by a sensorial potency. This is not an anecdotal point, tied to the plot, but rather a question of how narrative is affected by bodily presence, and how symptoms linked to traumatic and persistent historical processes, linking distinct generations, are exposed. In order to understand how Martel constructs a dramatic minimalism through shots that emphasise the act of precipitation, Amado offers a daring and pioneering reading of the poetics of sedentarism, which presents bodies that are static to the point of collapse. This approach stands in contrast to the poetics of nomadism in evidence in a series of contemporaneous films from Argentina. Amado notes, moreover, points of connection with women filmmakers who insist on showing, in detail, behaviours and rhythms that indicate a feminine subjectivity in crisis. The course of events and the characters’ pathways stray from the conventions of realism in an entropic movement, a whirlwind that takes us towards the interiors where conflicts implode. Remarking that Martel’s distrust of traditional film music and her own minimalist use of diegetic music in her films has led to a general inattentiveness to the musical content of the director’s films, Dianna C. Niebylski examines the fragments of the five cumbias and the folk song heard in The Swamp to argue that they provide additional layers of signification without reducing or compromising the indirectness and open-endedness that characterises Martel’s style. Positioned at the crossroads of film music theory and ethnomusicology, and focusing on the cumbia genre that became and is still synonymous with carnaval in Northern Argentina, the essay examines both the importance of rhythm and the ways in which the lyrics extend the film’s preoccupation with ethnic prejudice and with gender conflict. Additionally, the chapter also explores instances where the music fissures the image with political footnotes. Sound is indeed inevitable when watching a film, as Ana Forcinito states. In Martel’s work, especially in the shorts Fish, New Argirópolis and Muta, the disjunction between images and the modulation of voices, whispers and echoes creates an interweaving that gives body to that which cannot be seen, precisely\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 12\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\nm e ta m o r p h o s i s a n d p e r s i s t e n c e\n\n13\n\nbecause it points us towards what is invisible, or has been made invisible, and to the difficulty of seeing what is taken for granted. Yet this acoustic work does not remove the barriers of classism, racism, sexism or the dominant visual regime by amplifying the audible or by aiming for sonic transparency. Instead, as Forcinito persuasively argues, Martel’s cinema explores the difficulty of hearing or understanding clearly. These films do not claim to recover an archive of buried or forgotten collective memories in order to triumphantly display them. They do, however, perceive normative cultural and affective patterns, which are lost from view precisely because they have become part of daily life. These works generate discomfort in the face of the unknown, stemming from an encounter with marginal, almost unintelligible languages and resonances, and leading to confusion and to multisensorial experiences. It might be said, then, that Martel focuses neither on the clearly audible nor on deepest silence; she does not aim either to frame the visible or to evoke the order of the invisible. Her aesthetic and political preoccupations are not to be found at those extremes, but rather in the channels that flow between them: in multiple forms of silencing and rendering (in)visible. In other words, Martel’s cinema is characterised by unbalanced processes, tricks of light, infinite nuances, glissandi and mutations, which by pointing to the double-sided nature of perspective make clear its profound ambivalence. In this way, the limits and excesses of ordinary perception also reveal the restrictions associated with being human. Rather than definitive states, the spectator is presented with a series of metamorphoses, which always occur in the realm of the mundane and the routine; they are never supernatural. The opacity and technical virtuosity of Martel’s sounds and images not only break with synchronous and coherent representation; they show how far we ourselves are made up of incoherent and asynchronous experiences. An anti-Cartesian cinema, then? Probably, since it is never a question of evidence, or of clear and distinct perception. A cinema that is, nonetheless, rational? Perhaps, in that it shows a methodical suspicion of magical thinking and of the dictates of the senses, which are themselves far from innocent. Going against the grain of prefabricated interpretative frameworks, the cinema of Martel shakes up the litany of appearances. The monstrous is at the heart of Martel’s conception of fiction, as Mariana Souto and Mônica Campo observe. Think, for instance, of the characters: whether they are men, women, adolescents or children, it is not psychological or sociological difference that marks them out, but their ambiguous relationship to customs and morals. In Muta, for example, the creatures can be understood as figures in transformation between chameleonic and automatised states, both human and non-human, which create a sense of mystery and of estrangement. Unlike advertisements for women’s clothing, which aim to increase consumption, the short film Martel made for Miu Miu shows bodies shunning their wardrobe, their stilettos, their false eyelashes.\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 13\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n14\n\nb a r r e n h a , k r at j e a n d m e rc h a n t\n\nEmilio Bernini examines this experimental quality of Martel’s work, viewing it as an autotelic activity, freed from commercial imposition and the constraints of industrial parameters for certain audiovisual formats, such as television series or feature films. By undertaking a thorough review of historical avant-gardes and experimental cinema movements, Bernini finds an illuminating way to rethink the aesthetic radicalism of Dead King and You Won’t Get Her, Bastard, alongside Martel’s other short films. Martel’s is a politically committed mode of experimentation: committed to the project of undoing the received wisdom that organises daily family life in a world marked by racism and capitalism, overflowing with chauvinist pedagogy. In this vein, Gonzalo Aguilar argues that in The Holy Girl, Martel’s second feature, the apoyada, the act of pressing one’s body against another, acts as a rite of initiation that men try to impose on women, in order to reaffirm their sense of dominion. This bodily performance orders spaces according to relations of power and subordination. Women can be in public space on the condition that their bodies can be touched: Martel’s film turns this rule, and the subsequent scene of assault, into a mirror that reflects numerous conflicts. Aguilar explores the contradictory traits of masculinity that lie behind the structure of patriarchy, and shows how the gap between images, sounds, intentions, actions and reactions exposes the flaws in that same structure. In the final shot of The Holy Girl, the two friends swim alongside each other as they hum a song. This sisterly gesture reveals the potency of a feminine affectivity that takes flight in Cornucopia, Björk’s show. Alejandra Laera immerses herself in the futurist fantasies and the dense sensorial realisms that resulted from this collaboration, in order to propose a stimulating reading of the idea (and act) of bio-community. Cornucopia invites us to rethink the notion of utopia as a natural, sensorial phenomenon, a proposed transformation that is shaped by forms of ecological care and rooted in the inequality and exclusion suffered by indigenous communities. This should not be surprising: in Martel’s narratives, any approach to reality comes with a critical view of social dynamics. The upper- and middle-class families of the north-western Argentine province of Salta come under frequent scrutiny, bearing as they do the marks of the civic, military and ecclesiastical dictatorship. In Malena Verardi’s analysis, Martel’s third feature The Headless Woman pushes the notion of indeterminacy to an extreme, within a narrative that condenses class arrogance and impunity. At a distance from the suffocating reality that dulls the senses of the protagonist, the film gives body to the disturbing universe around her by placing, in each frame, filters and layers that separate the gaze from its object. At the same time, the process of erasing incriminating evidence is revealed by a lens that shows the details of habitual mechanisms of denial and complicity. Martel’s minimalism is in this sense something of a trick, in that her films do not exhibit a clear-cut reality, but rather a world shocked into definition by the spectres that inhabit it.\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 14\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\nm e ta m o r p h o s i s a n d p e r s i s t e n c e\n\n15\n\nThe insistent use of close-ups and tight frames means that the off-screen world, in Martel’s films, is full of sounds that cause physical and psychological distress for the characters, and are no more agreeable to the spectator. For Damyler Cunha, both in The Headless Woman and in Zama, these absent presences lead to an intensifying sense of vertigo in the face of an uncontrollable element like an accident, an illness or another’s decision. In Adriana Amante’s reading, Martel’s cinema is an act of thinking, played out in the time that such a process requires. For that same reason, it is an essayistic endeavour, a kind of writing that manifests both as materiality and as duration: it is the process of happening. It is cinema as fluctuation, as a mobile and everchanging form, distinct from hegemonic narratives that offer plots with a beginning, central crisis and dénouement. This perspective allows Amante to trace an unfamiliar route through Martel’s work, from the machine-like music of Fish and Muta to the (lack of) communication and (il)legible languages of New Argirópolis and Leagues, and the documentaries about Encarnación Ezcurra and Silvina Ocampo that Martel made in 1999. Throughout, Amante pays particular attention to the practice of eavesdropping or furtive listening, which becomes crucial in The Holy Girl. How to reconstruct a past scarred by conquest? How to bring to life the ghosts of a colony? How to give bodily form to fantastical gossip? These ethical and aesthetic questions lie behind Nora Catelli’s succinct and incisive reflections on Zama and on certain Spanish reactions to it, originally published in Spain in 2018. The novel by Antonio Di Benedetto, the writings of Félix de Azara, and Juan José Saer’s The Witness/El entenado are signposts that point Martel towards the imagining of lived experiences of the colonial past, the unsettling of official versions of history, and the weaving of a story made up of dreams, delays and acts of violence. Attempting a visual image of the past also implies considering the uses and potential meanings of the colour palette. For Deborah Martin, the tonalities of Zama challenge the subjective and corporeal boundaries of colonial white masculinity, and at the same time they create an enunciative position for a subaltern voice. Intense colour, typically associated with otherness (whether feminine, ‘oriental’, primitive or queer), is often devalued, or seen as superficial, secondary or cosmetic. Zama, conversely, presents tropical tableaux that, when combined with Martel’s soundscapes, create a reality that oscillates between the time of the colony, a time of travel and of waiting, and the polyvalent temporalities of indigenous cosmovisions. When filming from a position of privilege, aiming to represent the experience of an entirely distinct culture is an impossible endeavour, and one that is moreover linked to the Europeanising cultural projects that have marked the history of Latin America. This is not Martel’s aim or desire: her cinematic is more closely related to that found in horror film, whose mechanisms foment tension between what is shown and what is insinuated beyond the frame.\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 15\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n16\n\nb a r r e n h a , k r at j e a n d m e rc h a n t\n\nDavid Oubiña’s chapter offers an analysis of horror as the mark of a difference that has been repressed and that returns in an uncontrolled, disturbing and threatening form. This dynamic can be traced through Martel’s four features and several of her shorts, allowing Oubiña to position indecision as crucial to Martel’s way of seeing: the camera never loses its capacity to observe, even as it seems to become infected by the perplexity and confusion of the characters. This perspective, Oubiña suggests, determines a form of realism that is sometimes negligent, sometimes indolent, and sometimes stirs up trouble. Martel tells a story about a time when, while out walking with her nephew, they saw a man living on the street. Her nephew, astonished, began to ask who he was, why he was there, and what had happened to him. When she told him that the man lived on the street, her nephew immediately wanted to take him home, give him food: in short, to look after him. The boy’s immediate response to understanding the situation was a desire to act in the most obvious and humane manner. And yet these actions are (almost) never undertaken. This anecdote is telling: incomprehension in the face of an exploited and plundered world, a gaze that does not become accustomed to brutal social inequalities, and the ability to render strange the habitual forms of perceiving the world around us are some of the aesthetic and ethical pillars of Martel’s own practice. Each of these pillars is evidence in the interview that closes this volume, in which the director offers new ways of looking back over her work, and forwards to her new projects. notes 1. Lodge, G.

A one-way direction which the temporal convention takes from the human biographical story, nestled between birth and death, and by which time, in cooperation with space and point of view, is subjected to a normalisation and a standardisation of stories and images which are eminently desirable for captive viewers. This is particularly true in film, where space and point of view are literal concepts and require the mediation of movement and, particularly, of staging to ensure the fluidity of a malleable syntax, the illusion of seamless continuity. It is based on this summation of dependences, this indirect representation of temporality, on which Gilles Deleuze reflects as a matter of ‘emancipation’, of liberation of the image from time, and its indirect representation inasmuch as it depends on movement, space and staging to conquer a direct temporal representation. This, of course, does not entail doing away with movement, which is central to cinema, but transforming it into an abnormal movement, an ‘aberrant’ movement, as Deleuze describes it based on its effect of jamming fluidity, of transforming the link between present and past into a conflictive relation, of alluding to the real not as a mirror but as something full of tension and mystery. This ‘aberrant’ movement, translated by different alteration ranges, whether it be in spatial layouts, in the dissipation of narrative centres, due to unexpected connections or unpredictable directions, causes the idea of time to emerge directly, unshackled from all syntactic dependencies, and that independence turns it into a problem which is related not only to film, but also to philosophy. Deleuze’s ‘time-image’ is a conceptual distillation in which both fields flow together, film and philosophy, and which the author expands in multiple\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 18\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\ns p e e d s , g e n e r at i o n s a n d u t o p i a s\n\n19\n\npossibilities and variations.1 In a similar register, Georges Didi-Huberman’s ‘symptom-image’ extends the above notion, stressing the dysfunctional or paradoxical traits of images when they enable untargeted or discordant movements, to the point of turning time into a process, rather than a regulator of the story.2 The ‘symptom’ is that which becomes evident when the normal course of representation is assaulted by ‘counter-times’ capable of changing the chronological story. It should be mentioned, however, that this does not refer to a mere alteration of the linear succession of events. Narrating several characters and actions simultaneously by means of cross-cutting is now a commonplace and no less arbitrary operation, well on its way to becoming a new convention: in place of the debased narrative device of the flashback, there is an interrupted present. These ‘counter-times’ refer instead to a temporal regime of images more complex and impure than one attained merely through a simple artifice of staging procedures. Such complexity and impurity can be seen in a film like The Swamp/La ciénaga (2001), for instance, with a world which is still or facing extinction, segregated by a series of spatial and temporal collisions, among which stands out, in principle, the unprecedented equation between bodies and temporality. Deleuze places the body in the series of the time-image not only because it offers a glimpse, he says, of people’s inner self − a statement inevitably illustrated by Michelangelo Antonioni’s cinema − but for the synthesis of past experiences which can be established therein. His definitions portray the body as a surface of sorts on which the signs of a lived life are inscribed, a potential document which reveals the link between the past and the present, a virtual coexistence of times in gestures and telling everyday attitudes, almost instinctive, and a ‘before’ and ‘after’ of the body. Among Argentine films, The Swamp may be the one that enables us to perceive an exceptional sense of temporality, expressed precisely through attitudes and body postures, through the ritualised repetition of the most mundane and trivial actions; that is, through the direct theatricalisation of bodies, whose positions would appear themselves to determine the plot, which is subjected to the slow cadence of stillness and repetition, but also to other rhythms and speeds. It could be said that The Swamp entails a double speed, to the degree that each generation of protagonists (i.e. adults, and children and teenagers) gives its gestures and movements a different speed. Indeed, this effect of multiple durations, of heterogeneous times born from the combination of physical presence, spatial movements and positions, stands in stark contrast to contemporary policies of image, with their redundant exaltation of marginal or juvenile bodies with reckless, violent, inconsequential or hysterical gestures, with their doses of objection or conflict, but almost always as vehicles for ‘reality’ or sociology. The Swamp, instead, is among those movies which fully trust the power of bodies and gestures not as an anecdotal tether, but in their ability to shape\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 19\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n20\n\na na a m a d o\n\nthe shot (and to do that from impossible axes, as we shall see), or even to go through the shot and expose themselves as a ‘symptom’. If the in-vogue phenomenological Vulgate favours the body as the channel for experience, as the synthesis of an authenticity which is plausible in cinema, resorting to movement, to actions and sensations, those premises assume in Lucrecia Martel their best meaning, to the degree that the presence of the body affects the narrative, more than the mere visual. Rather than furnishing an iconic vision, bodies in The Swamp carry the very logic of representation, they instil into the tale their enigmatic, deviant side, and they disorient the units of film grammar which typically take any physical performance and its materiality for an indicator of realism. A digression is warranted here to rescue female filmmakers’ insistence on showing body attitudes as a sign of women’s states of mind. In their movies − perhaps not only in theirs, but they represent the majority in this trend − women are shown as revealing a subjectivity in crisis, in the search for their own individuality, their own temporality, together with specific ways of reacting against an era, with attitudes which almost inevitably manifest themselves in private, in the intimate exchange of encounters, which is not restricted to the domestic sphere. As the Latin American heiresses of Agnès Varda or Chantal Akerman − and also of Antonioni, it could be said − female characters are nomads traversing not only places but ages, situations, in films such as those by Mexican director María Novaro; Sandra Gugliotta, who set her urban migratory version in A Lucky Day/Un día de suerte (2002); Paula Hernández, in Inheritance/Herencia (2001), even though it did so as latency; Celina Murga, in Ana and the Others/ Ana y los otros (2003); Albertina Carri, in The Blonds/Los rubios (2003); and this list, surely incomplete, should not leave out Eduardo Milewicz’s Life According to Muriel/La vida según Muriel (1997), which pioneered geographic displacement fuelled by existential crisis. At the opposite pole of transhumance, The Swamp is sedentary, with characters reduced to a cloistered life and the repetition of domestic routines, in a fictional world outlined along strict coordinates. If, in narrative terms, family sagas show a tendency towards a horizontality laid out by the chain of actions and emotions, in this case, that progression of successive links is replaced by an entropic movement, a type of inward, imploding movement. With a ‘story’ that is imprecise or barely glimpsed in the transience of movements, of lateral actions, of the informative resource of a gesture or a posture, narration can only stem from those traits which are material, physical, but also psychic, which make up the miniature world of family societies. Martel adopts the meticulous lens of the anthropologist focused on all details, as if taking them from her memory to show them as symptoms together with the rhythm of sleep, latencies and crises. No hierarchy comes through among important or minuscule events, as if accepting the Benjaminian idea that the story (actually, history) is ultimately segregated by the slightest manifestations of existence.\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 20\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\ns p e e d s , g e n e r at i o n s a n d u t o p i a s\n\n21\n\nThis dramatic minimalism resorts for its construction to basic time and place data. There is a chronological time: the story takes place during the summer, during the days of carnival, a permanent off-camera reality in which that time of masks and liberation of the bodies takes place, available to a social class which is not that of the protagonists’ families: the poor. And, if the carnival dance is updated in images, the goal is not to show the confluence or harmonic coexistence which recent Argentine filmmaking constantly imagines for festive spaces, but the radical (and, this case, literal) clash, from which the upper-class boy emerges wounded, among characters from both sides of the social border. Martel focuses on the social matter which she seeks to describe, the middle class (including its codes of exclusion), and if she approaches subordinate bodies from the perspective and the desire of her teenage protagonist, she leaves them at the margins, alone with their rituals and smells. The field of the visible defines places: domestic interiors and nature, which vie to be the stages of that fabric of viscosity and survival made of the gestures and attitudes of men and women, of children and teenagers who circle the latency of a catastrophe to whose signs they appear impervious. The stillness, the inertia, the acute perception of an annulled time which these elements convey have, then, no other outlet than physical attraction, and therefore converge in the concept of precipitation: something appears to drag everything and everyone down. In The Swamp, the precipitation, the downfall, unfurls fictionally, inasmuch as all narrative procedures attempt to tie themselves to the law of gravity. And it also becomes an allegory of fiction, which flows out from the title of the film to the image of the mire which hopelessly sucks in humans and animals.\n\nFigure 2.1 The Swamp. © Lita Stantic Producciones\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 21\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n22\n\na na a m a d o\n\n‘We must always expect things to happen in conformity with the laws of gravity unless there is supernatural intervention’, wrote Simone Weil (a German philosopher and mystic who converted to Catholicism and is admired by Lucrecia Martel, according to an interview) in Gravity and Grace. Weil deploys in this book the multiple relationships between time and space, linking them to the high and the low, which from her perspective relate to heaven and earth. Analysing from this spatial and physical standpoint the interpersonal relationships and family conflicts in King Lear, for instance, Weil does not hesitate to label them a tragedy of gravity. In this line, Martel assumes in The Swamp that the transmission of unease (or of any other movement towards doom or salvation) has physical gravity as its inevitable law. And also that the rules of thermodynamics are functional as a means to translate the world − the world seen from the model of family relations, in this case as a human mechanism doomed to move down, rather than up. ‘If we think we gain this deliverance by means of our own energy, we will be like a cow pulling at a hobble and thus falling onto its knees’,3 says Simone Weil in one of her radiant images, in which she blends the immaterial with the laws of physics. In this equation of lightness − a lightness which, like Weil, Martel appears to associate with the light or grace of hope, faith in the miracle or mere belief − and heaviness, with its collapsing movement, The Swamp favours the latter with the pulley of bodies. The prominence granted to gestures, movements, body attitudes and the rhythm of their position in the shot, which turns the most trivial of positions into choreography, finally, with the symbolic power of a story that unfolds between two downfalls (that of a mother toppled by alcohol and that of a child who dies). From one downfall to the next, adults and children collapse onto the ground, or into puddles, or into deck chairs, beds and foul pools, or onto piercing objects which tear their flesh or maim them, as if the impossibility of being upright or always lying down was their true realisation or a revelation of sorts. The horizontal nature of the shot’s format is matched by a horizontal image field. By choosing this horizontal or tilted axis for the postures of bodies, Martel manages to pivot them outside of the vertical, dominant and sublimating condition (after all, the phallus, as a virtual object and imaginary basis for all representation, is designated in an erect position) and references them from sub-human fixations, near animal-like positions: a somewhat similar operation to the body regulations of Samuel Beckett, who challenges the privileges of verticality with characters who are always sitting or just lying down, a direct expression of tiredness. With her choice of a horizontal, tilted perspective, Martel attempts a pedagogy of perception of a world which has crumbled, or exploded, and can only be glimpsed in disconnected fragments: a perception which, in turn, places bodies and their positions not as an aesthetic liturgy, but as social and political testimonies of the present. Unlike the bodies from the\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 22\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\ns p e e d s , g e n e r at i o n s a n d u t o p i a s\n\n23\n\nLatin American films of the seventies, with vertical bodies which defy the law of gravity (though the exception of Glauber Rocha’s cinema should be pointed out, with characters who frequently have their trances and public and private conflicts down on the ground), Martel’s do not convey utopias, but pure defeat. This one possible interpretation of the relation between the body and the series of time I pointed out at the beginning, through the condensation it offers of before and after, that is, what remains in it from past experiences and what would appear to herald what is to come. The Swamp shows both directions, the traces of the past and the perception of the future in all attitudes of neglect and fatigue. And we can also see the order of time when they reveal the individual and the social they are made of and when they let time shine through in the space between two arrangements of bodies, in the interstice between them. I believe these reasons explain why bodies in The Swamp fail to be snared by the new mannerisms, among which the line of movement, the journey, the urban drifts, the pointless transits, to name but a few examples, would be the most noticeable. Rather, they stand out by the singular nature of their horizontality. The time-image can be born from this paradoxical relation, in which stillness is segregated by bodies and attitudes, while space is absent. All the characters of the various generations depicted in The Swamp are, one way or another, attentive to a premonition, to the despair of waiting, to a beyond which\n\nFigure 2.2 The Swamp. © Lita Stantic Producciones\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 23\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n24\n\na na a m a d o\n\ncan be geographic (travelling or not to Bolivia to buy school supplies) or heavenly (the apparitions of the Virgin seen by a young neighbour). If every event is related to an alien place, which works as the vessel for a vain expectation or something as shocking as a miracle or a belief, the problem is defined based on an outside point. The image centre is also a response to that other place which is ultimately the location for the point of view of an external observation, that of the narration, which only occasionally matches the internal view of Momi, a teenage character who, in the game of imperceptible oppositions between sleep and wakefulness, is the only one who identifies the details of a ‘problem’, or sees ‘too much’, even though she will ultimately accept her failure as a seer when attempting to see the material traces of a miracle. However, there are differences both subtle and significant which affect the cog-like repetition of elements and alter the passive organisation of those components: variations translated by the genealogical times which coexist in the present of the hills of Salta, which are expressed through two speeds or rhythms. On the one hand, we have the world of adults, ruled by alcohol’s unsteady movement. They do not stumble, but conquer a posture, that of alcoholics, which is associated with the cloister which heralds paralysis, as the route that takes the mother from room to room and ultimately to the circuit of her bed. Children and teenagers, on the other hand, take movement back. They play pretend and replicate the world of adults, they create their own world inside the larger world with the same elements, but with a different rhythm. Even though they adopt different combinations, lying in the mother’s bed, alone or hugging in twos and threes, they offer a different view of what happens on the ground or when lying down, they abruptly interrupt the lethargy of movement with an unexpected sense of speed and violence in the awkward movements of their races and chases. Temporality, held still and subjected to the law of gravity, is interrupted or ‘crossed’ by these ephemeral explosions in which time is expressed as speed, linked solely to the rhythms of childhood. Opposed to adults as a block of numbed perceptions (they would appear incapable of noticing falls, wounds on themselves and others, or even the rain against their skin), the bodies of children are astonishing at communicating, crossing as a loud and promiscuous entity the exterior spaces (the woods, the garden, the town streets, when they run from the water balloons: the apparitions of children energise the internal movement of shots), or disturbing the domestic stillness with unbridled gestures and shrill voices. In any event, in The Swamp, their vulnerable bodies are the only source of the unexpected and the disarray of the present. ‘A playing child invents the conditions of his knowledge and history’, claims Walter Benjamin.4 There is a state of experience in their relation to the world and things, situated between the tactile and olfactory power of children − which becomes a way to survive − different from the numb existence of adults.\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 24\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\ns p e e d s , g e n e r at i o n s a n d u t o p i a s\n\n25\n\nWhere the latter establish a radical divide with their environment (with children, family, friends and objects), children re-establish a relation to the world, to the outdoors, with peers, with the other. Theirs is a different type of spatial perception, which incorporates the idea of trajectory, a concept held by Paul Virilio as the ideal way of recovering the physical, psychic and cultural space lost to technological globalisation.5 The trajectivity put forward by Virilio as the unavoidable foundation for the relationship between subject and object is, in The Swamp, an idea insinuated − partially, perhaps as the single utopia − only in the generation of children and teenagers, but as an energy without direction, inherently uncontrollable and ultimately taken over by inertia. Between the two types of trajectories (downwards, subject to the law of gravity with the annulment of time, or in the horizontal nature of the sudden movement of children as a recovery of speed and space within the objective temporal coordinates required by the existence of the world and others), characters in The Swamp remain, however, trapped between the promise of life and a terrifying threat to this plenitude. Thus, the clash between the speed of children’s movements and the sluggishness of matter is won by the latter. Matter lumps together, like the fermented pool water, and obstructs itself in a pure accumulation of debris. And in that accumulation of materialities (in the matter of bodies and ruined things, in the games of children, in language habits, in decadent behaviours), something emerges which is like the prehistory of a culture, as if every person was, in his or her way, the trace or the remnant of that past. The past (which in The Swamp is, based on the above, a psychological indicator, rather than a dramatic one) resorts to language as well to be evoked and passed by the adults to the new generations. ‘Children are political prisoners’, said Deleuze, less optimistically than Benjamin as regards inheritances. Children, in this case, are prisoners of the aberrant version of transmission, an unfathomable magma of information about bonds and betrayals of others or of one’s own vocation, as a complement of a domestic system in which adult language is but a redundancy of contradicting orders or mandates, while children employ it in stories of horror, loss and despair. Until we reach the death of a child. Actually, the film as a whole advances based on the premonition of that death, even though the children themselves are the ones who make that death evident when toying with that enigma. They are the only ones who can portray corpses in a game, the only ones who ‘play dead’, who refuse to breathe, who attempt those paradoxical poetics of survival or simply an imaginary disintegration which assumes death as if it was real: they are always hovering near the risk of standing in the way of a bullet, of getting lost, of drowning in the stagnant water of a pool (these plot foreshadowing devices are what make that death plausible, turning its almost arbitrary cruelty into a dramatic ‘necessity’). Until a child effectively dies, an aspect which this fiction portrays as unavoidable in the troubled novel of the family.\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 25\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n26\n\na na a m a d o\n\nThe boy dies in silence, without language. There are no images or sound for his death: only a temporal gap in the flow of everyday repetitions, a fracture which remains off-screen (Martel’s chaining of shots works through an operation of subtraction: the interval between the action in a shot and the next makes any reaction impossible, or that reaction rebounds further into the plot, as in the short feature Dead King/Rey Muerto, 1995), and abruptly interrupts that repetition, perhaps to begin a new one, but set in the general decline of all belief and certainty. Pessimism and the cancellation of the idea of future is a recurring topic in contemporary Argentine cinema − and in global cinema, it could be said − produced, like The Swamp, during the turning point between centuries or to open a new one. However, I have tried so far to highlight Martel’s narrative choices, who even taking the family as a vantage point to analyse society, eludes the trap of psychologism and moral crisis so frequent in that trend, and proposes instead an approach which can be construed as an anthropological document: ages and generations, customs and attitudes of men, women, children, revealing heterogeneous modalities of time and of its rhythms (present, past and future, detention, repetition, speeds) as the formal key of a poetics and cipher of the private reproduction of collective trauma, with its indefinable dose of comedy and tragedy.

Niebylski\n\n‘No aspect of music is capable of being understood independently of the wider gamut of social and cultural processes . . . Yet, because of this, it is possible that there are aspects of social and cultural processes which are revealed uniquely through their musical articulation.’ John Shepherd and Peter Wicke1\n\nI\n\nnterviewed for the Argentine film journal Lumière in 2009 after the release of The Headless Woman/La mujer sin cabeza (2008), Lucrecia Martel observed that film audiences respond differently to (non-musical) sound than they do to music: [music] is like a net where the spectator rests, and [s]he remains there in some way, contained, prodded, scared, [yet] always supported by something. Instead, when the film works with sound, the spectator has to be mentally attuned in order to make sense of it all.2 In an earlier interview with Jason Wood for Talking Movies: Contemporary Directors in Interview, Martel noted her objections to conventional film music on the grounds that it ‘leads the viewer to anticipate and even prejudge what’s next’, whereas sound ‘only allows one to face what one is seeing at the moment’.3 Film music scholars agree. Theorising the effects of the ‘core musical lexicon’ most commonly heard in films intended for wide audiences, in her 1987 Unheard Melodies: Narrative Film Music, Claudia Gorbman observed that ‘music [. . .] anchors the image in meaning, throws a net around the floating\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 27\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n28\n\nd i a n na c . n i e b y l s k i\n\nvisual signifier, [and] assures the viewer of a safely channelled signified’.4 More recently, in Dreams of Difference, Songs of the Same: The Musical Moment in Film, Amy Herzog states that non-diegetic music ‘stabilises the image and secures meaning while remaining as unobtrusive as possible’.5 Martel’s refusal to use conventional film scoring puts her in a category of filmmakers that practise what Danijela Kulezik-Wilson calls an ‘aesthetics of reticence’, one defined by ‘restraint and a certain level of ambiguity [as] the basic conditions for allowing individuated responses to film’.6 Partly because of Martel’s comments on the subject of film music, partly because the music that is heard in her films is unrecognisable to most audiences, scholars have largely ignored, or dismissed as irrelevant, the music that forms a small but not insignificant part of her films’ soundtracks. This lack of interest in the musical content of the director’s sound design is especially noticeable in publications that address Martel’s greatly admired approach to sound design in the three films that have come to be known as the director’s ‘Salta Trilogy’ (The Swamp/La ciénaga [2001], The Holy Girl/La niña santa [2004] and The Headless Woman).7 To address this deaf spot in the considerable literature on Martel’s sound work, this chapter examines the pre-existent diegetic music in The Swamp, the much acclaimed first film in the trilogy. Added together and including the music heard in the final credits, the musical fragments account for only twelve minutes and thirty-seven seconds of the hour and forty minute film. Yet close attention to the five cumbias recorded for the film by two local Salta bands and the folk song sung by the famous folk singer Jorge Cafrune reveals that every aspect of the music − including but not limited to the choice of genres, song lyrics and rhythmic patterns − has been carefully conceived to add one or more layers of signification both to the particular scenes in which the music is heard and to the film’s narrative(s) in general.8 Locating my analysis at the crossroads of film music studies, musical semiotics and socio- and ethno- musicology, I propose to show that even some the shortest snippets of music fissure the image with sociocultural and/or political footnotes through which the wider issues of social conflict and political memory are articulated.9 At the same time, the frequent use of irony in these musical fragments ensures that music does nothing to reduce the film’s commitment to reticence and ambiguity. What the source music does not do, with one brief exception, is to tell the audience how to interpret the images or characters on the screen. In fact, Martel’s use of music is in many ways a primer for subverting mainstream cinema’s exploitation of the musical soundtrack for affect without dispensing with music altogether. Although The Swamp will be familiar to most readers of this book, a brief summary is in order. The film unfolds through a succession of loosely bound scenes that revolve primarily around the figures of two unhappy women and their troubled domestic situation. What little action there is takes place in a\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 28\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\ns o u n d i n g c l a s s , r ac e a n d g e n d e r\n\n29\n\nprovincial town in northern Argentina during carnival season, which in these provinces can last long enough time for a young woman who may have lost her virginity midway through the film to find out that she is pregnant. The film dialogue is scarce and discontinuous, yet it is from these fragments that viewers must piece together the characters’ relation to each other, the source of their dissatisfaction and bits of their history. Visual clues and snippets of conversation convey the entrenched ethnic prejudices of the provincial middle and upper classes and the ambivalent sexuality of adolescents. Easy to miss among ambient noises and sound effects, the source music heard at various points in the film extends the film’s treatment of these themes. the cumbias: sounding ethnic prejudice and c o m p l i c at i n g g e n d e r s t e r e o t y p e s\n\n‘Estos “indios” con su música, machaca que machaca no dejan dormir a nadie.’ (‘These “Indians” with their thumping music day and night, they don’t let anyone sleep.’) Tali, in The Swamp ‘To study the cumbia is to bring forth problems of race, gender and ethnicity, possibly in ways that no other cultural product in contemporary Argentina can reveal.’ Pablo Alabarces and Malvina Silba10 Almost the entirety of what takes place in The Swamp occurs during carnival season, yet this detail is only rarely seen as relevant in discussions of this film.11 In Argentina as elsewhere, the actual carnival holidays take place the weekend before Lent, but in Salta, as in the neighbouring province of Jujuy, festivities associated with carnaval retain much of their pre-Hispanic, pre-Catholic traditions, so that the festivities can start as early as January and extend until the day of the big celebration in late February or March. Luis Guantay, the Salta musician whose band Luis y sus Colombianos performs two of the cumbias in this film, explains that in Salta carnival festivities are inseparable from the outdoor carpas (large tents) and the carpera tradition exclusive to this province, a tradition that consists of setting up large outdoor tents where the area’s local population − and especially those who cannot afford to go to or are not welcome in dance halls − can gather to drink and dance during the extended carnival season. In an unpublished thesis on the carpas and origins of cumbia co-authored with Fatima Colombo, Luis’s son Javier Guantay observes that carpera music\n\n7432_Barrenha.indd 29\n\n14/03/22 10:56 AM\n\n30\n\nd i a n na c . n i e b y l s k i\n\nand dancing have been inseparable from cumbia since the 1960s.12 If the syllogism stands, for over half a century, in Salta carnaval means cumbia.13 Given this background, the cumbias and cumbia fragments heard in the film are as much a part of its sonic realism as the screeching sound of the metal chair legs being dragged around the cement that borders the pool in the film’s opening sequence. As diegetic music, sometimes blasting and sometimes barely audible, made to sound as though broadcast over the radio (mostly car, truck or transistor radios), cumbias are the spare musical accompaniment "
