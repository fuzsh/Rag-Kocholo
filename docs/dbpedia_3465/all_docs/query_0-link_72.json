Now in its 32nd year, the Festival, which took place online in 2020, is making a long-anticipated return to the big screen, cementing its reputation as one of the largest and long-running showcases of Latin American cinema in the United States, dedicated to presenting Latin America’s prolific and versatile talent during National Hispanic Heritage Month. This year’s wide-ranging selection of 49 films spans international festival favorites and award winners, local box-office hits and dynamic debuts from a new generation of Latin American filmmakers.\n\nThe Festival opens with Mexican director Alonso Ruizpalacios’ (GÜEROS, MUSEO) Berlin-debuted A COP MOVIE, an immersive, on-the-job and behind-the-scenes look at the life of two Mexico City cops, which confirms Ruizpalacios’ genius for creating unexpected, genre-bending cinema and won the Berlinale’s Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution earlier this year. The Festival closes with action-packed crime thriller LA SOGA 2, the highly anticipated sequel to 2009’s acclaimed LA SOGA and the directorial debut of Dominican-American writer and actor Manny Pérez (CROOKLYN, LA SOGA, WASHINGTON HEIGHTS), fresh from its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nOther Festival highlights include the U.S. premieres of several highly anticipated new works from up-and-coming and established Latin American auteurs, including Oscar®-nominated Peruvian filmmaker Claudia Llosa’s (ALOFT, THE MILK OF SORROW) haunting eco-thriller FEVER DREAM, based on the novel by acclaimed Argentine writer Samanta Schweblin and co-produced by Chile’s Pablo Larraín (EMA, JACKIE, THE CLUB and upcoming Princess Diana biopic SPENCER); 7 PRISONERS, Brazilian director Alexandre Moratto’s (SÓCRATES) powerful sophomore feature, produced by Fernando Meirelles (CITY OF GOD) and Ramin Bahrani (THE WHITE TIGER, MAN PUSH CART) and set in the murky underworld of human trafficking in São Paulo; Costa Rican-Swedish director Nathalie Álvarez Mesén’s buzzy, Cannes-premiered feature debut CLARA SOLA, an unconventional meditation on female empowerment about a 40-year-old healer (Costa Rican dancer Wendy Chinchilla Araya, in her debut role) in rural Costa Rica breaking free of a controlling mother; whip-smart Spanish comedy THE PEOPLE UPSTAIRS from award-winning writer/director Cesc Gay (TRUMAN), starring Javier Cámara (NARCOS) and Ana Griselda Siciliani, soon to be seen in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s LIMBO; and THE WHISPER OF SILENCE, directed by multi-award-winning Salvadoran producer Alfonso Quijada (MALACRIANZA, PABLO’S WORD), a powerful drama set in the coffee fields of El Salvador.\n\nThe Festival also features several recent favorites from the international festival circuit, including Salvadoran-Mexican documentarian Tatiana Huezo’s (TEMPESTAD) Cannes Prize-winning narrative debut PRAYERS FOR THE STOLEN, based on the bestselling novel by Jennifer Clement; THE OTHER TOM, the first U.S.-set feature by award-winning Mexican filmmaker Rodrigo Plá (DESIERTO ADENTRO, A MONSTER WITH A THOUSAND HEADS, THE ZONE), based on the novel by co-director/writer Laura Santullo; Swiss director Andreas Fontana’s gripping debut feature AZOR, set in the lofty world of high finance in Argentina during the 1970s; Belgian-Romanian documentarian Teodora Ana Mihai’s LA CIVIL, which won the Prize of Courage at this year’s Cannes Film Festival and stars Mexican actress Arcelia Ramírez (I CARRY YOU WITH ME); Argentine director Ana Katz’s (FLORIANÓPOLIS DREAM) charming sci-fi dramedy THE DOG WHO WOULDN’T BE QUIET; Brazilian filmmaker Iuli Gerbase’s eerily prescient Sundance-debuted sci-fi thriller THE PINK CLOUD; Leonardo Medel’s social media thriller LA VERÓNICA, starring Chilean actress Mariana Di Girólamo, breakout star of Pablo Larraín’s EMA; acclaimed Dominican filmmaker José María Cabral’s (WOODPECKERS, THE PROJECTIONIST) sharp period melodrama HOTEL COPPELIA; Guatemalan director Sergio Ramírez’s (DISTANCIA) ’90s-set coming-of-age tale 1991, produced and co-written by the Oscar®-shortlisted filmmaker Jayro Bustamante (LA LLORONA, IXCANUL); and Gijón-set dramedy EL PLANETA, a sharp satire about mother-daughter con artists, from multi-hyphenate Argentine writer, director and producer Amalia Ulman, who also stars in the lead role.\n\nDocumentary selections explore both the personal and the political, pushing the boundaries of the medium and confirming Latin America as a leader in the field. Besides Ruizpalacios’ genre-pushing A COP MOVIE, highlights include the U.S. premiere of NOTHING BUT THE SUN from Paraguayan documentarian Arami Ullón, whose 2014 film CLOUDY TIMES was Paraguay’s first-ever Oscar® submission; Mexican-American director Rodrigo Reyes’ (LUPE UNDER THE SUN, PURGATORIO) 499, a bold docu-hybrid exploring the brutal legacy of colonialism in contemporary Mexico; the U.S. premiere of Portuguese director Susana Nobre’s (ORDINARY TIME) playful and evocative docu-fiction hybrid JACK’S RIDE; and a special presentation of English-born Mexican director Trisha Ziff’s OAXACALIFORNIA: THE RETURN about a Fresno-based Mexican-American family who were the subject of British documentarian Sylvia Stevens’ 1995 documentary OAXACALIFORNIA.

The year is 2001, and Argentina is hitting the lowest point in its great depression. Retired soccer star Fermín (Ricardo Darín) runs a service station in a small rural town, but wants more for his sleepy community. When he and his neighbors make plans to launch a cooperative to convert some abandoned grain silos into a storage facility and pull their town out of decline, the unsuspecting investors are swindled out of their savings by an unscrupulous lawyer and bank manager. Mad as hell and unwilling to take it anymore, the motley crew joins forces to plan an elaborate Robin Hood-esque heist and take back what’s theirs. Timely, hilarious and suspenseful, HEROIC LOSERS is a spirited tale of working-class solidarity and collective revenge. The excellent supporting cast includes Luis Brandoni, Verónica Llinás, Daniel Aráoz, Carlos Belloso, Rita Cortese and Andrés Parra. (Note adapted from Toronto International Film Festival.) Winner, Best Iberoamerican Film, 2020 Goya Awards. Official Selection, 2019 San Sebastián and Toronto film festivals, 2020 Palm Springs International Film Festival. DIR/SCR Sebastián Borensztein, from the novel “La noche de la Usina” by Eduardo Sacheri; PROD Hugo Sigman, Ricardo Darín, Matías Mosteirin, Chino Darín, Federico Posternak, Leticia Cristi, Fernando Bovaira, Simón de Santiago,Axel Kuschevatzky. Argentina/Spain, 2019, color, 117 min. In Spanish with English subtitles. NOT RATED\n\nSpecial Presentation\n\nAZOR\n\nSwiss director Andreas Fontana crafts a gripping debut feature set in the privileged, lofty world of high finance in Argentina during the 1970s. Yvan De Wiel (Fabrizio Rongione, TWO DAYS, ONE NIGHT) is private banker with big ambitions and a stellar reputation. When a colleague mysteriously disappears while on assignment in Buenos Aires, De Wiel travels from Geneva to Argentina with his wife (Stéphanie Cléau, THE BLUE ROOM) to reassure his former colleague’s clients and disentangle any messes left behind. Once there, however, he finds himself unwillingly drawn into the mystery surrounding his predecessor’s disappearance, sinking ever deeper into a sinister inner circle that connects the country’s upper classes to the military junta’s ongoing “Dirty War.” A high-stakes thriller tracking the “Heart of Darkness”-esque journey of a morally compromised central protagonist, AZOR skillfully captures a highly specific milieu during a dark chapter of Argentina’s history. Official Selection, 2021 Berlin International Film Festival and New Directors/New Films. DIR/SCR Andreas Fontana; SCR Mariano Llinás; PROD Eugenia Mumenthaler, David Epiney. Argentina/Switzerland/France, 2021, color, 100 min. In English, Spanish and French with English subtitles. NOT RATED\n\nTHE DOG WHO WOULDN’T BE QUIET [EL PERRO QUE NO CALLA]\n\nIn Argentine director Ana Katz’s (FLORIANÓPOLIS DREAM) charming mumblecore sci-fi dramedy, 30-something designer Sebastián (played by the director’s brother, Daniel Katz) navigates a series of temporary jobs, all while dealing with a dog who ceaselessly howls every time he goes to work, much to the dismay of his neighbors. In a series of vignettes, each representing a jump forward in time, Sebastián transforms through a succession of short encounters, just as the world flirts with a possible — and strangely familiar — apocalypse. Striking a fine balance between empathetic drama, deadpan comedy and the slightly absurd, Katz creates “a mini masterwork” (The Guardian) with an uncannily recognizable view of the near future which evokes the not-so-distant past — and our ongoing present. Winner, VPRO Big Screen Award, 2021 Rotterdam International Film Festival; Winner, Special Jury Prize, 2021 Seattle International Film Festival. Official Selection, 2021 Sundance, Miami and Minneapolis St. Paul film festivals. DIR/SCR/PROD Ana Katz; SCR Gonzalo Delgado; PROD Laura Huberman, Pablo Ingercher, Ramiro Pavón. Argentina, 2021, color, 73 min. In Spanish with English subtitles. NOT RATED\n\nLONELY ROCK [PIEDRA SOLA]\n\nAlejandro Telémaco Tarraf’s visionary fable about Fidel, a native llama herder struggling to protect his livestock from an unseen puma in the Argentine Andes, has drawn comparisons to the work of Carlos Reygadas and Terrence Malick. Documentary-like early scenes establish the rhythm of working life for the highland community, which then give way to more dreamlike fantasy sequences after Fidel takes part in a traditional ceremony intended to placate the mysterious puma. The gorgeous widescreen lensing by cinematographer Alberto Balazs and the immersive sound design by Leonardo Cauteruccio take full advantage of the cinematic form, and demand to be experienced on the big screen. Winner, Special Mention, 2020 Reykjavik International Film Festival. Official Selection, 2020 Rotterdam and AFI FEST film festivals. DIR/SCR/PROD Alejandro Telémaco Tarraf; SCR Lucas Distéfano; PROD Alberto Balazs. Argentina/Mexico/Qatar/UK, 2020, color, 82 min. In Spanish and Quechua with English subtitles. NOT RATED\n\nISABELLA (2020)\n\nThe latest in Argentine filmmaker Matías Piñeiro’s (HERMIA & HELENA, THE PRINCESS OF FRANCE, VIOLA) series of films inspired by the women of Shakespeare’s comedies follows Mariel (María Villar, HERMIA & HELENA, LA FLOR, THE PRINCESS OF FRANCE, VIOLA), a young actress who dreams of playing the role of Isabella in a local theater troupe’s production of Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure.” When dire financial straits prevent her from preparing for the audition, she approaches her brother’s girlfriend, Luciana (Agustina Muñoz, HERMIA & HELENA, THE PRINCESS OF FRANCE, VIOLA) — also an actress — to enlist Luciana’s help in asking her brother for the money she needs to continue pursuing the role. Through their rich and layered performances, Muñoz and Villar demonstrate a profound intimacy formed over more than a decade of collaboration with Piñeiro. ISABELLA is a film about the ongoing battle between doubt and ambition that never discounts the possibility of a new beginning. (Note Adapted from Cinema Guild.) Winner, Encounters Award – Special Mention, 2020 Berlin International Film Festival; Winner, Best Actress (María Villar), 2020 Mar del Plata Film Festival.

When he picks up a mysterious passenger who is on his way to start a new job, an attack by a gang of thieves leaves the man almost dead and Julian fired by his boss. Desperate for answers — and cash — Julian assumes the passenger’s identity, hoping to take on the new job to which the man had been traveling. As the mystery unfolds, Julian finds himself embroiled in a scheme to assassinate a colonel planning a coup against the country’s socialist government. Rodrigo “Gory” Patiño and Luis Reneo’s high-octane and timely political thriller will have you on the edge of your seat. Official Selection, 2021 San Francisco Latino and Chicago Latino film festivals. DIR/SCR Rodrigo “Gory” Patiño, Luis Reneo; PROD Claudia Gaensel, Germán Monje. Bolivia, 2020, color, 90 min. In Spanish with English subtitles. NOT RATED\n\nBrazil\n\nTHE PINK CLOUD [A NUVEM ROSA]\n\nPicture a world in which everyone must stay inside for an indefinite period of time while a mysterious threat sweeps the globe. This is the world imagined by Brazilian filmmaker Iuli Gerbase in her feature debut THE PINK CLOUD, an eerily prescient sci-fi thriller, which was shot in 2019, an entire year before life started imitating art as the COVID-19 pandemic forced us all indoors. When a mysterious and lethally toxic pink cloud appears over an unnamed Brazilian city, interrupting a one-night stand between Giovana (Renata de Lélis) and Yago (Eduardo Mendonça) and forcing the world to shelter in place, the impromptu couple is forced to quarantine together in Giovana’s high-rise apartment. As days turn into weeks, weeks into months and months into years, the two settle in for the long haul. But while Yago becomes acclimated to their sealed-off existence, Giovana grows addicted to virtual reality and is increasingly desperate for connection to the outside world. An intimate and all-too-familiar study of life in quarantine, THE PINK CLOUD thoroughly — yet inadvertently — captures the mood of 2020 with surprisingly thrilling and emotive results. Winner, Grand Prix, 2021 Sofia International Film Festival. Official Selection, 2021 Sundance, Seattle and Miami film festivals. DIR/SCR Iuli Gerbase; PROD Patricia Barbieri. Brazil, 2021, color, 103 min. In Portuguese with English subtitles.

When Mateus and his six fellow workers discover that they have inadvertently walked into a trap, forced to work for no pay in exchange for the safety of their families, Mateus strikes a Faustian bargain with Luca that will draw him deep into the dangerous underground world of human trafficking and force him to walk the fine line between oppressed and oppressor. Official Selection, 2021 Venice and Toronto film festivals. DIR/SCR/PROD Alexandre Moratto; SCR Thayná Mantesso; PROD Ramin Bahrani, Fernando Meirelles, Andrea Barata Ribeiro.

NOT RATED\n\nKING CAR [CARRO REI]\n\nA spiritual predecessor to this year’s wild Cannes Palme d’Or winner TITANE, drawing on everything from CHRISTINE to CRASH to MAD MAX and last year’s BACURAU, Brazilian director Renata Pinheiro’s (LOVE, PLASTIC AND NOISE) KING CAR combines steel, roaring engines, sex, desire and killer (literally) Retrofuturist design to comment on Brazil’s toxic political situation, class-based inequality and the global threat of climate change. Uno (Luciano Pedro Jr.) is the son of a taxi company owner with an extraordinary connection with cars: he was born in a car, can talk to them and even befriends one that saved him from a traffic accident as a child. When the local authorities use ecological concerns as a thinly-veiled, money-grabbing excuse to ban from the streets all vehicles older than 15 years, Uno hears no end of complaints from the broken-down, abandoned old cars he calls friends, all while poverty and unemployment skyrocket in his community. Together with his mechanical genius of an uncle, Uno hatches a plan to convert the abandoned vehicles into powerful futuristic machines that will help him get back at the powers that be. Visually and narratively unique, KING CAR is must-see for genre fans and world cinema fans alike. Official Selection, 2021 Rotterdam, Bucheon, Fantasia and Fantastic Fest film festivals. DIR/SCR Renata Pinheiro; SCR Leo Pyrata; SCR/PROD Sergio Oliveira. Brazil, 2021, color, 97 min. In Portuguese with English subtitles. NOT RATED\n\nChile\n\nLA VERÓNICA\n\nMariana Di Girólamo (breakout star of Pablo Larraín’s EMA) gives a tour de force performance as the eponymous Verónica in Chilean director Leonardo Medel’s (COACH) chilling social media thriller. A model married to an international football star, Verónica Lara is a burgeoning social media influencer with a growing following, a beautiful new baby and a seemingly perfect life. But just as Verónica is vying for a big job as the new face of a high-profile cosmetics line, she learns that she’s the prime suspect in an investigation into the murder of her first daughter, who died in mysterious circumstances a decade earlier. Amid the pressure of the inquiry, Verónica’s daily efforts to maintain the illusion of perfection for her followers start to flounder, her marriage verges on breakdown and she begins to feel pangs of jealously toward Amanda, her newborn daughter.

Born aboard his father Antonio’s boat during a violent storm that took his mother’s life, Nahuel inherited an acute fear of anything to do with boats or the sea. Add that to dealing with local bullies and poor Nahuel just can’t seem to build up the courage to face his fears. But when he finds “El Levisterio,” a powerful book whose magic incantations can temporarily give him courage, Nahuel thinks his problems are solved. Little does he know that “El Levisterio” is also coveted by evil master sorcerer Kalku, who plans to use the book’s power to summon up a monstrous deep-sea terror that will destroy civilization. After his father is captured by Kalku, Nahuel must set off to rescue him alongside newfound companions Fresia, a Mapuche machi-in-training, and Ruende, a talking dog with a secret. In a land where dreams and reality are one and the same, where spells, magic and fantastic creatures lurk around every corner, Nahuel must summon every ounce of courage to battle with the forces of evil — and his own fears — in this beautifully animated feature debut from Chilean director and animator Germán Acuña.

But after years of being controlled by her mother without any agency of her own, Clara’s sexual desires are stirred by an unexpected attraction to her young niece’s (Ana Julia Porras Espinoza) kind-hearted new boyfriend (Daniel Castañeda Rincón). Clara begins to rebel — at first in subtle ways and then in ways that defy the expectations of her sleepy community and lead to explosive results. Costa Rican-Swedish director Nathalie Álvarez Mesén’s feature debut is a powerful — at times uncomfortable — meditation on female empowerment and the fine line between the physical and the mystical.

Luisa decides to help the young woman, giving Yuliana the safe space she needs to decide what to do — and ultimately helping her to conceal her condition from her unsuspecting parent.

When Leonardo loses his position in a local ballet company and is forced to eke out a living teaching salsa to tourists, he and Sara concoct a plan to seduce one of the students – a young Canadian-Iranian divorcée named Nasim (Aki Yaghoubi) — and get Leonardo a ticket out of Cuba via a bogus marriage. As Leonardo makes it to snowy Montreal with his new flame — who has her own demons to battle — a truly international love triangle unfolds against a beautiful backdrop of Cuban music, dance and spiritual traditions.

What starts as musical journey to fulfill a dream of performing in front of 3000 people in Los Angeles slowly turns into something far more complex, as the group are forced to undergo an arduous and uncertain process to secure visas, making the road to the concert an odyssey that gains a wider resonance as the women are caught between various cultural and political crosscurrents. With soul-stirring music and the larger-than-life personalities of the Vocal Vidas as our guides, SOY CUBANA is both a celebration of the human connections that transcend borders and a pressing look at the virulent relationship between the U.S. and Cuba at a time of ongoing uncertainty.

It was 2007 and the 34-year-old Salvadoran couldn’t have been happier or more prepared for the birth of her second child. But with only a few weeks to go, Vásquez was unexpectedly hit by the intense, crippling pain of a miscarriage, her desperate cries for help going unanswered before she lost consciousness. She awoke handcuffed to a hospital bed and charged with murdering her baby. Poor and unable to procure competent legal help, Vásquez was sentenced to 30 years in prison for aggravated homicide, another victim of a deeply patriarchal legal system. Leaving behind a preteen son and her impoverished yet determined parents, Vásquez quickly found her place among a group of 17 other women, all imprisoned on similar charges, all bringing global attention to an unjust, misogynistic culture in a unified voice. Together with a small army of advocates and attorneys, Vásquez won an early release in 2018, becoming a renowned international symbol of women’s rights — and a reminder of how easily the right to choose can be stripped away — all the while fighting for the release of “The Seventeen” left behind in prison.

Over the years, Josefina has quietly developed a rare and refined sense of smell that allows her to evaluate and appreciate coffee beans with quasi-scientific precision. When her unique gift is revealed to the owners of the farm on which she works, Josefina embarks on a journey from the coffee fields to become a professional coffee taster and sought-after expert in the industry. But as Josefina navigates her newfound success, she must also deal with problems at home, including the plight of her rebellious younger brother, who finds himself caught up in a crime gone wrong, and the unwanted attentions of a local thug who threatens to upend Josefina’s life just as she is poised to take the coffee world by storm.

It’s 1991 and Guatemala is in the midst of a bitter civil war, but for indigenous teens Daniel (Eduardo Cabrera) and Beto (Brandon Lopez), life is more about chasing girls, practicing their break-dancing moves and earning enough money cleaning the pools of the city’s elite to have fun on the weekends. That is, until the boys’ new classmate, Tony (Juan Jose Muralles) — a wealthy white bad boy expelled from his private school — becomes fast friends with Daniel when they bond over soccer. Quickly thrust into an alluring, privileged world of private clubs, money and girls, Daniel can’t believe his luck. But his new friendship has a dark side as he finds himself expected to tag along as Tony and his friends roam around the city with baseball bats, harassing and beating the indigenous kids of Daniel’s neighborhood for sport. Expected to deny his identity and betray his roots, Daniel finds the price of assimilation is much higher than he ever anticipated. Official Selection, 2021 Miami Film Festival.

In a rural mountain town besieged by violence, Ana and her two best friends are on the cusp of adolescence, having grown up together being taught by their mothers how best to flee and hide from being abducted or disappeared as pawns in local gang warfare. The trio create their own world, taking over abandoned houses, play-acting their impending adulthood and finding joy and magic amidst fear. But when one of the girls is kidnapped on the way to their hideout, the safe-guarded world the young women knew is plunged into uncertainty and anguish. Doubling as a condemnation of Mexico’s violent drug trade, this coming-of-age story manages to find moments of true beauty and resilience among the stark realism of its images.

NOT RATED\n\n499\n\nTo reflect on the 500-year anniversary of the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 2021, Mexican-American director Rodrigo Reyes (LUPE UNDER THE SUN, PURGATORIO) offers a bold, hybrid cinema experience exploring the brutal legacy of colonialism in contemporary Mexico. Through the eyes of a ghostly conquistador (Eduardo San Juan), the film recreates Hernán Cortez’s epic journey from the coasts of Veracruz to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, the site of contemporary Mexico City. As the anachronistic fictional character interacts with real-life victims of Mexico’s failed drug wars and indigenous communities in resistance, the filmmaker portrays the country’s current humanitarian crisis as part of a vicious and unfinished colonial project, still in motion, nearly 500 years later. Provocative, unique and strikingly cinematic, 499 mixes non-fictional and performative elements with elements of the road movie to show how past traumas continue to affect contemporary reality. While linking these seemingly disparate histories of violence, the film confirms Reyes as one of the most potent voices in American independent cinema. (Note adapted from Cinema Guild.)

But it’s soon clear that she’s fighting a losing battle with men who have no intention of returning her daughter. After the authorities fail to offer support in the search, Cielo decides to take matters into her own hands, collaborating with Lamarque (Jorge A.

Since the 1970s, Mateo Sobode Chiqueno, also Ayoreo, has been recording the stories, songs and experiences of the people within his community who experienced this brutal relocation. Through gentle conversations, Sobode Chiqueno records the memories and lived experiences of his community. As the population ages and people become more disassociated with their language and culture, Sobode Chiqueno’s work becomes ever more pressing as he attempts to preserve the fragments that are left, in hopes that from the memories, a resurgence will bloom.

With a hilariously twisted performance from Uruguayan horror pioneer Ricardo Islas (whose 2011 movie FRANKENSTEIN: DAY OF THE BEAST plays on screen as the film-within-the-film), THE LAST MATINEE will gross you out, make you laugh and make you think twice about your next midnight movie outing. Official Selection, 2020 Mar del Plata and Sitges film festivals, 2021 Cine Las Americas and Cleveland film festivals.

For Walsh and del Río, Carmen is no longer a smoldering femme fatale, but rather a bouncing embodiment of life force and libido, who finds her male counterpart in the bullfighter Escamillo (Victor McLaglen) and her nemesis in the dark romanticism of cavalry officer Don José (Don Alvarado). Despite the film’s success, no prints of the domestic version are known to exist. This MoMA restoration was painstakingly reconstructed from an export version preserved by the National Film Archive of the Czech Republic. (Note courtesy of MoMA.)

This year’s inaugural event was founded in the belief that silent motion pictures are a vital, beautiful and often powerful part of film history, with the goal to advocate for their presentation and preservation.

DIR Sylvia Stevens; SCR/PROD Trisha Ziff. U.S/UK, 1995, color, 108 min. In English and Spanish with English subtitles. NOT RATED\n\nFollowed by: OAXACALIFORNIA: THE RETURN [OAXACALIFORNIA: EL REGRESO]\n\nThis follow-up to OAXACALIFORNIA (1995) revisits the Mejía family 25 years later, this time exploring identity and shifting intergenerational mindsets in 21st-century America. Now spanning three generations, the family’s immigrant grandparents and their U.S. grandchildren naturally have different experiences and nuanced understandings about their ancestry and where they feel a sense of belonging. Where the older generation may have felt stuck between two worlds, ni de aquí ni de allá (neither here nor there), the grandchildren are comfortable identifying as having dual ancestry, de aquí y de allá (from here and there). Official Selection, 2021 Cine Las Americas. DIR/SCR/PROD Trisha Ziff; SCR/PROD Jorge Márquez; PROD Andrew Houchens, Isabel del Río. Mexico/U.S., 2021, color, 84 min.

NOT RATED\n\nTHE SAINT OF THE IMPOSSIBLE\n\nBased on the novel by award-winning Dutch writer Arnon Grunberg, Swiss director Marc Wilkins’ feature debut follows a trio of Peruvian immigrants in New York — Raffaella (Peruvian actress Magaly Solier, LINA FROM LIMA, THE MILK OF SORROW) and her two teenage sons, Tito and Paul (real-life brothers Adriano and Marcelo Durand) — as they navigate undocumented life in the big city. Things are looking hopeful for Raffaella after she meets a Swiss pulp fiction author (Simon Käser) who convinces her to start her own burrito business. But when her twin sons fall for a mysterious Croatian girl named Kristin (Tara Thaller) in their English class, and unwittingly become involved in some shady dealings — and eventually a murder — she must piece together their secret romantic life to find out what happened as deportation looms. A coming-of-age drama wrapped in a thriller, THE SAINT OF THE IMPOSSIBLE is a powerful and refreshingly honest deconstruction of the American Dream, which despite its heavy subject matter refuses to devolve into miserabilism or pity. Official Selection, 2020 São Paulo International Film Festival, 2021 Miami Film Festival. DIR/SCR Marc Wilkins; SCR Lani-Rain Feltham; PROD Joël Louis Jent. Switzerland, 2020, color, 90 min.

NOT RATED\n\nLATIN NOIR\n\nThis explosive blend of history, art and crime literature explores how a new generation of Latin American novelists found in noir fiction a unique way to confront their countries’ troubled pasts and presents. Greek documentarian and author Andreas Apostolidis travels to five Latin American cities to meet with famous crime novelists Leonardo Padura (Havana), Luis Sepulveda (Santiago), Paco Ignacio Taibo II (Mexico City), Santiago Roncagliolo (Lima) and Claudia Pineiro (Buenos Aires). Through their stories, a unique genre of flourishing literature is revealed, strikingly different from its North American or Nordic counterparts: it’s political, dark — and the crimes are often committed by the state itself. (Note adapted from Anemon Productions.) Official Selection, 2021 Miami Film Festival. DIR/SCR Andreas Apostolidis; PROD Rea Apostolidis, Yuri Averof, Estelle Robin You, Sergio Muñoz.

That is until a mysterious American gangster (Chris McGarry, BARRY, THE FOSTERS, LUCKY 7) asks him to do one last job — or risk losing everything he’s worked so hard to protect from his violent past. Faced with an impossible choice, Luisito is forced to fight for the love of his life while confronting his inner demons and the shadows of his past.

NOT RATED\n\nSpecial Presentation\n\nLA MANPLESA: AN UPRISING REMEMBERED\n\nQ&A with filmmaker Ellie Walton, producer Quique Avilés and poet Sami Miranda on Oct. 10\n\nOn May 5, 1991, people took to the streets of Washington, DC’s Mount Pleasant neighborhood to protest the police shooting of Daniel Gomez, a young man from El Salvador. Through testimony, song, poetry and street theatre, LA MANPLESA weaves together the collective memory of one of DC’s first barrios and dives into the roots of the 1991 rebellion. As people across the world take to the streets to demand an end to police brutality, the film honors the largely untold stories that have come before us and explores how artists prompt us to remember what we still must fight for.

NOT RATED\n\nTHE OTHER TOM [EL OTRO TOM]\n\nThe latest feature by award-winning Mexican filmmaker Rodrigo Plá (DESIERTO ADENTRO, A MONSTER WITH A THOUSAND HEADS, THE ZONE) is based on a novel by co-director/writer Laura Santullo and follows the journey of a single mother, blue-collar worker Elena (Julia Chávez), and her nine-year-old son Tom (Israel Rodríguez Bertorelli). Living by themselves in the U.S., they rely on a thin public safety net to make ends meet and their tight but fraught bond is pushed to the limit when Tom is hastily diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed psychiatric medication. When a near-fatal accident alerts Elena to the drug’s potential side-effects, she determines to stop giving her son the meds. But as Tom’s erratic behavior escalates, they’re faced with the painful possibility of him having to go into foster care. Elena’s difficulty in dealing with figures of authority — or recognizing the scarce signs of empathy they find along the way — compound Tom’s challenging attitude. But in the face of very few options, their trust in each other helps them find a way to reconnect and take on the uncertain road ahead. Within an atmosphere of subdued realism, the story portrays the dangers of unchecked medical diagnosis and pill pushing and presents a poignant take on the ways basic governmental systems fail the people who most depend on them. (Note adapted from Toronto International Film Festival.) Official Selection, 2021 Venice and Toronto film festivals. DIR/SCR/PROD Rodrigo Plá, Laura Santullo, from the novel by Santullo; PROD Gabriela Maldonado, Alejandro de Icaza. U.S./Mexico, 2021, color, 111 min. In English and Spanish with English subtitles. NOT RATED\n\nVenezuela\n\nFORTITUDE [LA FORTALEZA]\n\nCast out from his middle-class family in Caracas, the aging ne’er-do-well Roque (Jorge Roque Thielen) — alcoholic and dissolute, but still possessed by a daemon of energy — retreats to the Amazon jungle where he begins work on restoring an old tourist lodge. But an old acquaintance, Yoni (Yoni Naranjo) turns up, offering Roque work in his illegal gold mine run by Colombian guerillas. Roque abandons the lodge for the mine, putting himself and his dream of salvation in mortal danger. In a metafictional twist, the character of Roque and his personal struggles were based on filmmaker Jorge Thielen Armand’s own father, who Armand then cast to play the role. “A feverish voyage of discovery through the hinterland between madness and salvation.” –Wendy Ide, Screen International. Official Selection, 2020 Rotterdam and Busan film festivals, 2021 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.
