This was the second episode joined in the 3-ep. Movie-gestalt the Sci-Fi Channel broadcast on its Anime Saturday Block (without showing the rest). Japanese with English Subtitles. U.S. Manga DVD.\n\nTHE FIENDISH PLOT OF FU MANCHU (1980) 40TH ANNIVERSARY this month. Peter Sellers’ final picture. There seems to be a mixture of old hits, playing dual roles (as Fu and Dr. Nayland Smith), doing accents, performing with past costars like John Tomlinson, Steve Franken, Simon Williams, and Burt Kwouk. This was probably my first film of Helen Mirren that made an impression (I had a little memory of seeing parts of EXCALIBUR first, but not enough to picture her). I first saw the opening on one of the movie channels (c. 1990), and then saw the whole film on Comedy Central Spring 1992. Whatever one says about it, the opening credits are pretty Badarse. Amazon prime.\n\nBLACK PANTHER (2018) In view of the late Chadwick Boseman, I finally got around to seeing this Marvel film. I had seen CIVIL WARS in theaters, but I had lesser luck seeing BP (I did make an attempt- right after work. Unfortunately, I brought my book bag with me- often a cinema companion- and the rules against allowing such big apparel had just been installed. So there went my chance to see it). Amazon Prime.\n\nMonday 31\n\nSUMMER STOCK (1950) 70TH ANNIVERSARY One can see Judy Garland’s MGM career via her films with Gene Kelly. Their first- ME AND MY GAL- was her first adult-character film. Their second- THE PIRATE- was when her mental and physical problems were reaching its peak. And this ‘Pull up a Play in a Barn’ film was to be her last for MGM. With Eddie MacBracken, Phil Silvers, Gloria deHaven, Marjorie Main, and Hans Conreid. Warner DVD.\n\nTuesday 1\n\nMOBILE SUIT GUNDAM WING (1995) “The Fight for Independence” 25TH ANNIVERSARY Milliardo Peacecraft endorses peace, Wufei joins the Gundam captives, and Une’s mental problems finally come to a head. Japanese with English Subtitles. Bandai DVD.\n\nTHE SLAYERS (1995) “VICE! The One who was Left Behind.” 25TH ANNIVERSARY The gang look for Rezo’s Legacy. First mention of the Claire Bible, which will be a major plot point in the next series. Japanese with English Subtitles. Sculptor Software DVD.\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES (1985) “The Greek Interpreter” 35TH ANNIVERSARY Dr. Watson (and the viewer) meets Holmes’ older brother Mycroft (Charles Gray). I remember seeing this on A&E in the fall of 1992. I was surprised to hear someone refer to our protagonist by his first name! In my viewing of the Rathbone films, this show, MURDER BY DECREE, it’s always ‘Holmes’ but never ‘Sherlock.’ The following September, I would see Gray’s earlier turn as Mycroft in THE SEVEN PER-CENT SOLUTION (also on A&E). MPI Home Video DVD.\n\nWednesday 2\n\nDADDY LONG LEGS (1990) “Tutoring Kids is Hard Work” 30TH ANNIVERSARY. Judy finds the spoiled daughters of her employers a chore, until she realizes the kids’ behavior are crying out for their negligent parents’ attention. Japanese with English Subtitles. Bootleg DVD.\n\nIVANHOE (1997) “Episode Five” 200TH ANNIVERSARY Christopher Lee’s Templar Master puts Rebecca on trial. Parts of this episode was my first viewing of the serial in its premiere on A&E in 1997. Among the highlights that caught my eye were Lee’s EVIL Baptism of Isaac and the cameo of Sian Philips as Eleanor of Aquitaine (I was under an I, CLAUDIUS fanboyism). A&E Home Video DVD.\n\nTEA FOR TWO (1950) 70TH ANNIVERSARY In a matter of a week, we got two studio musicals about putting on a show with casts in unusual living conditions, compromises, and snarky sidekicks. While Judy made her last MGM vehicle, Doris Day makes her first star vehicle in this Crash of 1929 musical with Gordon MacRae, Gene Nelson, S. Z. Sakall, and Eve Arden (stealing the show with her snarks). Although I knew Billy deWolfe from THE PERILS OF PAULINE and this film, I never realized the connection to FROSTY THE SNOWMAN (1968) where he played Professor Finkle. I first saw a preview of this film from American Movie Classics’ 4th Annual Film Preservation Festival in 1996 (the theme was musicals, and probably the only time THE SOUND OF MUSIC was broadcast alongside the other Fox/Rodgers & Hammerstein films on the same channel). Then I saw the film on Turner Classic Movies in the next century. This is TCM Broadcast VHS recording (2014). Due to legal issues, one of the film credits has been digitally smudged.\n\n4 CLOWNS (1970) 50TH ANNIVERSARY this month. Robert Youngson’s final collection of Silent Comedy highlights Laurel and Hardy (their early solo shorts- among them several Chaplin Imitator Billy West shorts- and their silent Team films THE SECOND HUNDRED YEARS, PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP, SOUP TO NUTS, THEIR PURPLE MOMENT), Charley Chase (US, MOVIE NIGHT, WHAT PRICE GOOFY? LIMOUSINE BLUES, etc.), and Buster Keaton (SEVEN CHANCES). First saw this in the summer of 1991 on American Movie Classics. Viewed this on a foreign NTSC DVD under the title ‘4 POLHACOS.’ Cult Classics DVD.\n\nThursday 3\n\nTHE ROSE OF VERSAILLIES (1980) “Adieu, My Beloved Oscar!” 40TH ANNIVERSARY The finale episode. Oscar makes the ultimate sacrifice, and the French Revolution begins with its consequences to all (poor Marie Antoinette). Thus ends my Anniversary viewing of the series. I started late, but I got to the end on time. Japanese with English Subtitles. Right Stuf DVD.\n\nTENCHI MUYO TV (1995) “No Need for Karma” 25TH ANNIVERSARY The identity of the false Yosho is revealed- Kagato. This villain is an adaptation of the OVA’s Big Bad (who started much of the background story of the series). This time, instead of the mad scientist, he is an exiled old friend who has gone to the Dark Side. I bet the original viewers had a good idea of his identity, due to his voice actor and his OVA theme music. Japanese with English Subtitles. Pioneer DVD.\n\nWAY DOWN EAST (1920) 100TH ANNIVERSARY D.W. Griffith’s Melodrama of a used woman finding love, again starring Lillian Gish and Richard Barthlemess. Famous for its Ice Floe Rescue sequence, which I saw in several documentaries (LILLIAN GISH: THE ACTOR’S LIFE FOR ME (in 1990), D.W. GRIFFITH: FATHER OF FILM (in 1993), and HOLLYWOOD (in 1996)) long before I saw this film on TCM. Kino Lorber BluRay.\n\nFriday 4\n\nNARUTO SHIPPUDEN (2013) “The Izanami is Activated” English Dubbed. Viz Media DVD.\n\nSaturday 5\n\nPRIDE AND PREJUDICE (2005) 15TH ANNIVERSARY The first feature-film adaptation since the MGM film in 1940. Starring Matthew MacFadyen, Kiera Knightley, Rosamund Pike, Donald Sutherland (who once narrated a GREAT BOOKS docu about the book), Brenda Blethyn, Tom Hollander, and Judi Dench. I remember TV spots of the film showing Judi Dench’s Lady Catherine spitting her threats to the soundtrack of Howie Day’s “Collide” (which doesn’t appear in the film BTW). Eventually saw it on the Movie Channels the following year. Universal BluRay.\n\nEarliest film seen in August: THE PENALTY (1920)\n\nLatest film seen in August: BLACK PANTHER (2018)\n\nPost by Lebowskidoo 🦞 on\n\nRose Red (2002 TVM)\n\nRed Rose is a haunted gothic mansion in downtown Seattle where people disappear completely and other mysterious events occur. Stephen King was asked by Steven Spielberg to write the scariest haunted house movie ever, and this is the result. Too bad they never made it together.\n\nI love the characters in Stephen King stories, they are always well fleshed out, and here in the mini-series format, they get plenty of room to grow. I don't think this is the scariest haunted house movie ever, however. It's fairly good King, but not his best work, and pretty predictable. The majority of the characters have some kind of psychic power, but they might as well be regular people, for all that it plays a part in the story. I kept waiting for some major confrontation between the evil in the house and one of the psychics, but King was off in his own direction. Maybe that's more to do with my own expectations.\n\nIt's a bit slow at times but never what I would call boring. I love Stephen King and enjoyed this, but it doesn't seem like a story I would want to revisit again too soon. It has it's creepy moments but there should have been more. The cast are all very good, just wish some of them had been given more to do.\n\nI had gotten the DVD years ago, only now getting around to watching it.\n\nThe Stranger Beside Me (2003 TVM)\n\nA watered down TV-movie adaptation of Ann Rule's book. In a once in a lifetime coincidence, crime writer Ann Rule knew serial killer Ted Bundy before he was caught, and writes a version of the events as she saw them.\n\nIt skips many details, that Zac Efron movie looks more and more like the most definitive version produced so far. Billy Campbell does an alright job here, Barbara Hershey seems to have very little to do though. The movie is very rushed, but does offer a different perspective, but just barely.\n\nThe Deliberate Stranger (1986 TVM)\n\n\"I was looking for a kind soul, preferably a pretty one, to help me unload a sailboat from my car...\"\n\nThe first ever movie about Ted Bundy. Bundy was still alive when this mini-series premiered. Mark Harmon even considered meeting Bundy at one point, but changed his mind. Harmon is a nice mixture of creepy/charming, maybe more charming than creepy - love letters to the real Bundy only increased after this aired.\n\nThe movie was made before Bundy's execution, so it is missing that grand finale the other movies all have. It has a lot of information and a lot of time to let it spill out. Maybe too much, it drags a bit, here and there. It's a good thing it has Harmon in the lead, he's great at being cocky, charming and sinister.\n\nIt's also a little annoying that so many names and events have been changed or left out, by now we know some of these things and notice when they're gone or different. This is still a well done version of the story, but if you're really looking for a chilling version of this story with all the facts intact, nothing beats Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes. It's a gripping docu-series, and it will leave you reeling. Even the recent movie with Zac Efron, which some people didn't care for, has much more information than any other movie. Being the newest version has its advantages.\n\nStorm Warning (2007)\n\nAussie redneck maniac family terrorizes nice couple lost in the swamp. Starts off pretty average, but then becomes quite suspenseful and surprisingly downright gory, which I loved. The bad guys are very bad, so you do enjoy it when their creatively bloody deaths arrive.\n\nDie Hard (1988)\n\nMaybe teleadm and I think alike. I also watched the Die Hard series this week!\n\nWorst Christmas party ever! Best action movie of all time!\n\nThe action movie that all others aspire to be. Keeps building momentum with each passing second. Full of huge heart and hilarious one-liners. You'll laugh, you'll gasp!\n\nIt's little wonder Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman went supernova after this. Both are so perfectly in their elements. Willis was known as a rom-com kinda guy prior to this. Alan Rickman wasn't even known, let alone well known before Die Hard. This changed their careers permanently.\n\nI honestly haven't seen this in decades. I know it's hugely popular with the masses, but this is my first time rewatching it since the 90's. I've seen bits and pieces on TV over the years, but seeing the complete movie was such a joy. I know it's not Christmas, it's not even Labor Day, but it seemed like the perfect time to visit Nakatomi Plaza again.\n\n\"Happy trails, Hans.\"\n\nDie Hard 2 (1990)\n\n\"How can the same shit happen to the same guy twice?\"\n\nLightning never strikes twice, but they tried really hard with this sequel, and you do get flashes of lightning, and maybe a little thunder to go with it. It's a great action movie all on its own, and they more than acknowledge the fact that this is a sequel and have fun with it.\n\n\"Why does this keep happening to us?\"\n\nIt's Christmas again, and John McClane is waiting for his wife Holly's plane to land at Washington's Dulles Airport. Too bad terrorists assume control of the air traffic control system, forcing her plane and others to circle above, unable to land. McClane takes it upon himself to stop them.\n\n\"Oh, we are just up to our ass in terrorists again, John?\"\n\nAs far as sequels go, this is pretty great. Same scenario almost, but different enough as well. The stakes are higher, as they always are in sequels. Bruce Willis is in fine form as John McClane again, Bonnie Bedelia is back as Holly, they even found a way to bring back William Atherton as Dick Thornburg, the annoying reporter Holly punched in the face in the first movie. Also, Reginald VelJohnson gets one scene as Sgt. Al Powell.\n\nIt's a fun sequel, deserves to become a holiday tradition, just like the original movie. Nothing says Christmas like fighting terrorists!\n\n\"Just once, I'd like a regular, normal Christmas. Eggnog, a f**kin' Christmas tree, a little turkey. But, no. I gotta crawl around in this motherf**kin' tin can.\"\n\nDie Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)\n\nJohn McClane came roaring back with...well, a vengeance, in this third Die Hard!\n\nThis was my first Die Hard in a movie theater when it premiered, and what an experience. The pace of this movie is relentless and never lets up. We have a solid pairing in Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, squabbling non-stop, and a villain much like the one from the first, played by Jeremy Irons. Racing around New York City trying to stop bombs going off, this is some exciting stuff.\n\nA much grander, more original, less cookie-cutter sequel than Die Hard 2, the originality pays off. McClane was too comfortable, too happy in Die Hard 2, now he's an alcoholic with a hangover and his wife wants nothing to do with him. Sure doesn't hurt having original director, John McTiernan, back in the game either. The rare sequel that is equal to the original.\n\nLive Free or Die Hard (2007)\n\nAnother action-packed McClane adventure, full of carnage and one-liners, just what we've all come to love and expect from a Die Hard movie.\n\nIt's been twelve years since the last movie. McClane's daughter is all grown and mad at her dad. McClane has to protect a computer hacker from a cyber terrorist, Thomas Gabriel, who plans to attack the nation's infrastructure. McClane's daughter, Lucy, winds up on Gabriel's radar, and all Hell breaks loose.\n\nLots of exciting action, and the chemistry between Bruce Willis and Justin Long is a lot of fun. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is spirited as Lucy. Kevin Smith must have creamed his hockey jersey when he got cast in a Die Hard movie, he's a welcome presence too. Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q make great baddies, but they have to live free or die hard in the shadow of Alan Rickman, the most beloved Die Hard villain ever, and that's hard to overcome.\n\nOnly slightly weaker than other Die Hard sequels, but man, still impressed by that whole jet fighter/freeway sequence!\n\nA Good Day To Die Hard (2013)\n\nA Good Day To Die Hard is most definitely the weakest link in the Die Hard chain. It's not that it lacks action, it just lacks heart and imagination. A Die Hard movie should have action and a few laughs, but the stakes need to be high and we need to care about the people involved. What's weird is, this is the first Die Hard movie not based off of previous material, but was written specifically to be a Die Hard movie.\n\nJai Courtney as Jack McClane has no personality. It's not the actor's fault, it just isn't in the script. John McClane became an action movie icon because he was an immensely likeable everyman, overflowing with personality. Bruce Willis drops a few cool lines here, but it's not enough. The story is happening in Russia, no where near his usual stomping grounds, already making it seem like some random action movie and less like Die Hard. The story is not bad, it's just not very Die Hard-ish.\n\nI, like everyone on the planet, was very disappointed when I first saw this. It was lacking that special something each of the previous Die Hard movies had. There was no spark, it seemed hollow and forgettable. So forgettable, in fact, that I kind of enjoyed it this second time, since I'd forgotten what happened. I knew I wasn't going to love it, and parts of it surprised me this time. Almost every series has that one movie that tanks, and this is it for this series, but I had more fun with it this time. I'm a real movie slut that way. As a Die Hard movie, it's lacking. As an action movie, it ain't too bad.\n\nThe Story of Louis Pasteur (1936)\n\nA solid biographical telling of the story of Louis Pasteur, the French biologist, who saved us all from horrible early deaths because of his discoveries in vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization.\n\nPaul Muni, who is really better than I've ever seen him before, plays Pasteur as a determined and unrelenting investigator into microbes, intent on cracking this mystery of science. It's told in that classic cinema fashion, meant to inspire and uplift, while possibly skimming over a great many details.\n\nThe Foreigner (2017)\n\nA tense drama/martial arts action movie about seeking vengeance for a modern-day IRA bombing starring Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan, directed by Martin Campbell. What a hodge-podge this was, but it all works together to make for a great movie.\n\nJackie Chan has never been more serious, Pierce Brosnan has never seemed more Irish. Together, they make for an odd pairing, but one that works. The story moves forward at a rapid pace, twists are thrown at you and turns are taken.\n\nThe IRA are a fascinating subject, which this movie only skims the top of, it's more concerned with getting vengeance, as only Jackie Chan can. Pierce Brosnan is quite good too, one of his better roles of recent years. I have to admit, I wasn't too eager to see this, but Martin Campbell keeps this tight and taut, an action movie with grit.\n\nRiver Runs Red (2018)\n\nA young black man is shot dead for no reason by police. His father, a judge, wants justice.\n\nWhat a timely dramatic premise, this looked to be great from the outside, it starts off really great too. Then, it just slides downhill. The production looks a bit cheap. The story gets a bit too far-fetched. The ending is a downer.\n\nAlmost no one shows any real sympathy for the families at all, which seems a little unlikely. I know they want to isolate the character and drive them to do what they ultimately do, but it doesn't seem realistic.\n\nJohn Cusack, who appears for maybe a total of ten minutes overall, what are you doing in this movie? You'd be better off doing a sitcom than accepting tiny roles in lesser movies like this.\n\nRashomon (1950)\n\n\"We all want to forget something, so we tell stories. It's easier that way.\"\n\nDipping my toe into those foreign classics again. This was my first Akira Kurosawa movie, so please be gentle. The woodcutter's story was the most truthful because he took the baby home...or what?\n\nThis had to have blown a few brains out back in 1950, it still gives you a lot to consider. People are trash, but people are also beautiful, just depends what people you choose to associate with. The flashback storytelling technique was used to perfection, handing out the right information at the right time. It looks great too, in beautiful black and white.\n\nMachiko Kyô was very impressive in this, wow!\n\nSeptember Affair (1950)\n\nA classy, scenic romance starring Joan Fontaine and Joseph Cotten as two Americans who meet in Italy and fake their deaths so they can be together. It's a plot only old Hollywood can pull off. It's all played believably, however, and I bought into it completely.\n\nThe movie takes its time, you spend so much time with the characters site seeing in Italy that it seems only natural when they fall in love. Italy is practically a character itself in this movie.\n\nJoan Fontaine was a standout in this role, her expressions ring true. Loved seeing a young Jessica Tandy in this, she's adorable.\n\nZombie (1979) a.k.a. Zombi 2 and Zombie Flesh Eaters\n\nLucio Fulci's zombie masterpiece opens with an iconic scene of an abandoned yacht bobbing around in New York harbor. Then the action moves to the Caribbean where we are witness to the classic shark vs. zombie scene (HOW did they film that?) and an island overrun with zombies.\n\nFamous for that squirmtastic eyeball-gouging scene, which is remarkably well done for its time. Still makes me retch, but it's also an amazing moment of pure horror tension. I especially enjoyed it this time, showing it to someone who hadn't seen or even heard of this movie before.\n\nThe score is perfect for such a story, plodding along creepily, just like the zombies. The zombies are not shown much, which only adds to their horror mystique. The story is a bit slow at certain points, but the overall horror atmosphere kept me entertained. A definite must-see for any and all horror fans everywhere.\n\nCity of the Living Dead (1980) a.k.a. The Gates of Hell\n\n\"The city of the dead. The living dead. A cursed city where the gates of hell have been opened.\"\n\nA priest hangs himself, allowing the gates of Hell to open up. Of course, zombies take full advantage of the situation and treat the general public like midnight buffet on a Carnival cruise.\n\nThe story is muddled and secondary to the artsy-fartsy horror atmosphere created by Lucio Fulci, which is what makes it all so gripping. There's a memorable scene involving a drill and some poor guy's head that horror fans will love, and it looks fantastic, which is something else, considering the time period.\n\nI thought I'd seen this before at a sleepover when I was a teenager, turns out that it was City of the Walking Dead (1980) a.k.a. Nightmare City that I had seen. Similar titles and release dates. I hadn't seen this till now, I had an accidental Lucio Fulci double-bill.\n\nCity of the Walking Dead (1980) a.k.a. Invasion of the Atomic Zombies\n\n\"Don't get caught \"alive\"... you'd be better off dead!\"\n\nA plane full of ticked off zombies exposed to radiation go on a killing spree, running after people, using knives, guns and various other methods, including their teeth, in their quest to kill everyone in sight. Totally gonzo \"zombie\" movie, completely off the wall with tons of violence and breasts.\n\nThe zombies are very well-dressed but they appear to be caked in fecal matter, which is not a good look. It's delightfully violent and just plain crazy, this movie is a real hoot! Some of the acting is extremely overwrought. This is already a mini-cult favorite, but it deserves to be seen even more. It's not possible to take it seriously, but it does have some unique and impressive moments that make it stand out.\n\nI saw this movie years ago as a teenager at a sleepover. We rented this one based on the VHS box and stayed up all night watching horror movies of varying quality. It was called City of the Walking Dead when I saw it, which is why I got it confused with City of the Living Dead, which was also released in 1980 and is an Italian zombie movie as well.\n\nMost memorable moment: A zombie cuts a woman's bare breast off! Whoa! It's total trash, but it's entertaining trash.\n\nThe Giant Spider Invasion (1975)\n\n\" You ever see the movie Jaws? It makes that shark look like a goldfish!\"\n\nGigantic spiders attack a small rural community in Wisconsin. Cows get ripped apart, people are eaten alive. Giant spiders attend a little league baseball game. It's all pretty low-key, seemed like a forgotten TV-movie from the 70's, but it was an actual surprise money making box office theatrical release.\n\nIt really gets interesting once the spiders attack. I found the scenes of people being devoured by spiders to be a little disturbing, actually. The giant spider looks great, you can't tell that it was played by a Volkwagen Beetle in some scenes. Worth a look for horror and sci-fi fans.\n\nStarring Barbara Hale and Alan Hale, Jr. (no relation)\n\nHave a great movie week!\n\nPost by morrisondylanfan on\n\nHi all.thanks to Lebowskidoo 🦞 Lucio Fulci has become a star of the week,with (the first part of) my recent viewings:\n\nAuteurs in the 70's:\n\nFulci's The Four of the Apocalypse... (1975)10\n\nStorming onto the screen like a psychotic shaman, Tomas Milian gives a powerhouse performance as Chaco, who Milian has hiss at anyone who crosses his sight, and inflict brutality with unflinching ease. Leaving all the cast/crew stunned into silence by crying for real on-screen,Lynne Frederick gives a ethereal performance as \"Bunny\", thanks to Frederick sharply contrasting the rough macho thrills covering the screen with a delicate sensitivity that brings Bunny to being the spirit of the final fading apocalypse.\n\nImprovising grotesque exchanges with Tomas Milian, Michael J. Pollard steals every scene he is in as Clem, who Pollard has as a barking mad dog to Chaco's orders, whilst Fabio Testi and Harry Baird (in sadly his last ever credit,he got glaucoma which left him blind ) fire off a whip-smart rebellious sting in their performances as Stubby and Buddy,who they both hold with a soulfulness,that stands against the violence of Chaco.\n\nRevealed in Stephen Thrower's outstanding book Beyond Terror:The Films Of Lucio Fulci that he was hired by the producer after they had made Challenge to White Fang (1974), writer/directing auteur Lucio Fulci works for the first time with who was soon to be his regular cinematographer: Sergio Salvati.Both impressively show themselves to be in synch from the first shoot-out shot, by cracking the skyline of the Wild West into blazing hot white, which thrillingly agitates a eerie atmosphere of this Western being in the soulless apocalypse Fulci would fully enter in his Horror credits.\n\nRewriting the entire script, Fulci loads up his distinctive stylisation gunning from a sawn-off whip-pan behind a bullet, sliding straight in to a zoom-in between the eyes. Whilst not featuring his trademark eye gouging (pity!) Fulci stabs at the heroism of the West with bursts of red exploding across the screen, a brutal assault on Bunny by Chaco held in chillingly silent mid-shots, and close-ups digging deep into the outlaws wounds.\n\nWithin the brutality of the nihilism he paints, Fulci grows moments of beautifully composed tenderness gliding from long one-take panning shots bonding the group together,rising to the snow-covered isolated all-male town crane shots lowering to Bunny and Stubby's final embrace, as the four walk into the beyond.\n\nLarraz's ...And Give Us Our Daily Sex (1979)6\n\nDeparting from the country manor houses his works traditionally are set in, co-writer/(with Sergio Garrone) director Jose Ramon Larraz is joined by cinematographer Roberto Girometti,and continues to build upon his distinctive eye for sleaze, following Alfonso losing his innocence with a periscope that Larraz slips into peeping two-shots of Alfonso getting a glimpse of Veronica & Amiga (played with a eye-catching raunchiness by Barbara Rey and Laura Gemser) between the sheets,causing Alfonso to have sensual, surreal dreams (a major recurring theme in Larraz's credits.)Staying largely on the \"soft\" side, Larraz throws hard curve-balls with random insets spliced in,which try to steam things up,but are so out of place they come off as distracting.\n\nRevealing later he secretly got very close behind his parents backs with the maids who worked at the family home, the screenplay by Garrone and Larraz bake saucy laughs by going in a somewhat autobiographical direction, via Alfonso's stuffy parents being kept in the dark of his desire to get in the middle of bi nurses/friends Amiga and Veronica (trios being the major recurring motif in Larraz's works) for a private trio, as his family are busy eating their daily bread.\n\nSuzuki duo:\n\nA Tale of Sorrow (1977)8\n\nThe lone cinema release by him in a decade spent blacklisted by the industry, (he successfully sued Nikkatsu studio for wrongful dismissal) directing auteur Seijun Suzuki reveals he has not lost his swing from the surrealist disembodied golfing opening sequence. Expanding on a motif driven in Our Blood Will Not Forgive (1964-also reviewed), Suzuki spins the sports cars of the rich with Japanese New Wave stylisation, splashing back-screen projection in the chic open-tops,tracking a speeding car from long off in the distance wide-shots, which slam into a slow-motion of distorted screams.\n\nMaking it rather clear in the final shot his feelings about pushed into doing TV work, Suzuki gloriously takes his unique Pop-Art styling to a shimmering level of excess befitting the consumerism golfing society from the brash green pitch which Suzuki swings on with razor-sharp match-cuts, to the brightly coloured backdrops exposed in excellent long tracking shots by Suzuki dipping into the consumerism lining the walls. Picking up a club from the Manga by Ikki Kajiwara, Suzuki's regular collaborator Atsushi Yamatoya interestingly places this adaptation between their genre creations,and the oncoming epic surreal mood-pieces.\n\nYamatoya superbly shaves at the Sports genre in Reiko Kashiwagi's (played with a alluring flare by Yoko Shiraki) transformation from model to sporting pro, which Yamatoya hits with a hole in one into a violently excessive socialite society, where vapid TV shows play in the background as Kashiwagi becomes increasingly submissive to losing all that had made her stand out as a individual,who has now swung into a tale of sadness.\n\nThe Fang in the Hole (1979)10\n\nForced into having to accept the few scraps of offers to work on TV which came his way, and handed a bright lime coloured wall/backdrop which stays on screen for the majority of the film, director Seijun Suzuki fires a shot at the limitations of the TV Movie with a blistering opening sequence which rubs close to the stylisation of the Giallo genre, thanks to the brash red, overlapping bullet shot dissolves and manipulation of film speed that Suzuki drenches his murder set-piece in.\n\nMaking the hole backed by Kazuo Sugita's shimmering Ennio Morricone- inspired Jazzy score, Suzuki unveils a impressive inventiveness in emphasising the positives of the low budget, from the moving of set dressing as if it was on stage creating a theatrical, surrealist ambiance,to the long ghostly final panning shot,where the lone sound of rain is broken by demonic laughter.\n\nLoading up Togura's paranoia, Yoshio Harada gives a gloriously flashy turn as Shida, whilst Makoto Fujita grinds Togura down,with thick Film Noir loner, (a major type of recurring character in Suzuki's works) dread at having fired a shot into the unknown. Taking a bullet in a run time of 46 minutes,the screenplay by Atsushi Yamatoya & Takao Tsuchiya unload a compact Giallo mystery, powered by Togura's curiosity to unearth Shida's former riches,but a mistake which he can't stop slipping through his fingers, causing fangs of despair to be sunk into Togura.\n\nMore from the 70's!\n\nFist of Fury (1972)8\n\nKarate-chopping the wire work that dominated Kung-Fu cinema of the era, un- credited co-writer/fight choreographer and lead actor Bruce Lee performs a succession of blistering action set-pieces, striking in graceful wide-shots that allow Lee's fluid fighting moves to be fully displayed, zeroing in to slow-motion close-ups to Lee delivering the nunchucks knock out blow.\n\nAt odds with co-writer/ director Wei Lo for the whole of the production, Lee matches his actions with words in a magnetic performance, thanks to Lee hitting each aftermath of a battle with Zhen becoming increasingly engulfed by the thirst for revenge, that Lee's washes with a excellent balance of not glorifying Zhen's acts of revenge, whilst capturing the honer he holds in the high-kicking final freeze-frame.\n\nHigh-kicking into cinemas in a year which marked a decade since The Great Leap Forward had finally ended, the screenplay by Wei Lo places the film in another period of hardship the country had faced, The Century of Humiliation. Lo sets Zhen up against the hardship and humiliation from the racist and barbaric Japanese ruling Shanghai, who place in Zhen's hands a banner with \"The Sick Man of Asia\" on it, that Zhen gets his revenge on, by literally making them all eat their words,with his fists of fury.\n\nFemale Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song (1973)7\n\nTracking Nami making her final prison break after director of the first three Shun'ya Ito had left the series all wrapped up, co-writer/(with the returning Hiro Matsuda and Fumio Kônami) director Yasuharu Hasebe & cinematographer Hanjiro Nakazawa struggle to give the title a unique identity, instead taking a mix and match approach to what Ito had done across the trilogy, from the sleazy WIP mood of the first, to the ending tailing the surrealism of the second.\n\nWhilst this path does leave to some eye catching stylish sequences, (plus a cheeky opening song lifted from Branded to Kill (1967-also reviewed) and a great rumbling synch score from Hajime Kaburagi,they each crack with a atmosphere of being from past glories, rather than a fresh new beginning.\n\nAiming as the closer to Nami Matsushima tale, the writers disappointingly make clear the low on fuel status of this entry, by keeping Nami on the sidetracks for the majority of the film, with the writers emphasising the actions of Nami's old classmate, whose run-ins with the cops as he keeps Nami safely in hiding,leads to Nami being kept off screen,and to be given little involvement in the main plot. Entering walking towards the camera wearing \"that hat\" for the final time, and saying only a handful of lines in the whole film, Meiko Kaji gives a extremely expressive turn as Nami Matsushima,whose scars from the past three films are cast across her face by Kaji, who pulls at the tears,and the increasingly isolated state she is in,as Nami unleashes the final scorpion sting.\n\nSchoolgirl Report 1 (1970)8\n\nUndressed from the façade of being a educational documentary, director Ernst Hofbauer & cinematographer Klaus Werner neatly contrast the glossy frisky antics with half- real vox pops asking people on the street questions related to the next story (some of the answers of which get some strange glances from locals walking pass!)\n\nGoing on a school inspection, Hofbauer notes a saucy Comedy atmosphere, with the mischievous fit ladies, (all of whom are clearly adults) laughing at the moral high ground the church and teachers attempt to stand on, who Hofbauer brings down to earth with alluring close-ups of the ladies displaying their cheeky side. Adapting Gunther Hunold's novel in the loosest way possible (thankfully), the screenplay by Gunther Heller keeps every tale in the anthology moving at a playfully snappy pace, from a bus driver parking up too close to a eager lady, to one proudly saying she had seduced her step dad (this would become a recurring theme in the series!)as she uses his pen to write out a schoolgirl report.\n\nA Tale of Two Critters (1977)4\n\nReleased as the B-Movie to The Rescuers, writer/director Jack Speirs scratches a pleasant atmosphere, where the staged bonding between the animals is sweetened by Mayf Nutter's cheerful narration and Buddy Baker's jaunty score. Whilst a large amount of this \"Nature Documentary\" is clearly fake, (footage of a second bear appears to have been filmed in a completely different location!) Speirs still claws real moments of nature,swimming with zoom-ins towards a wolverine, bear cub and raccoon fighting with each other over nabbing a fish, as the two tails shake upstream."
