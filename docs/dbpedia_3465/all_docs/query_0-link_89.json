        "text": "TRIGGER WARNING: This essay discusses Cannibal Holocaust and something worse.\n\nMy journey into appreciating horror has had its ups and downs, from my first brush with the Friday the 13th franchise startled by Jason jumping out of the water, to watching the exhilarating chainsaw duel in Panos Cosmatos’ Mandy at the Hayden Orpheum, to being there when the 2018 Halloween direct sequel was in theatres - I haven’t seen everything the genre has to offer, I didn’t start out as a badass who’d buy a Blu-Ray of Martyrs and general admission Slayer tickets. I was a former wuss who avoided horror instead of becoming a friend of it, freaked out by Rail Chase at Sega World Sydney and hesitant to try anything too spooky. That changed of course, by the time I was in college I was seeking out banned exploitation movies like Caligula which I got an uncut copy of from EzyDVD Burwood when they still had a brick and mortar shop. I acquired Salo when it had been given an R-18+ certificate by the OFLC I despised, because they did not protect me well enough with their ratings advice when I needed them the most. More on that later. Then a little film called Cannibal Holocaust came to my attention, I’d seen the DVD stocked amongst the shelves at JB Hi-Fi where I bought most of my physical media, but until a now-cancelled filth elder I respected did a comedic review of the film I wasn’t game enough to touch it, let alone buy it for my personal collection of home video. The first time you watch a horror movie which is truly scary, there’s always the sense of dread of what could await you in the sections which film critics only hint at in their reviews for the sake of reducing risk of spoilers. Cannibal Holocaust shocks from the very title alone, it’s a film hard to defend due to its copious amounts of animal cruelty, because some absolute madman named Ruggero Deodato decided it was worth the risk of being pilloried for having made an alleged snuff film by blurring the lines of hyper-reality with graphic special effects and actual scenes of butchering a turtle to convince you that the rest of the violence is more than an “impaled” woman sitting on a bicycle seat with a piece of balsa wood in her mouth. I have at times gotten defensive when Cannibal Holocaust receives criticism for this unpleasant aspect baked into the celluloid of its being, and it’s hard for me to recommend Cannibal Holocaust as a work of cinematic genius when the process of its creation mutilated animals for entertainment. It’s also not the worst movie I’ve ever seen by a long-shot, but I’ll get to that.\n\nThe reasons why I continue to defend Cannibal Holocaust transcend simple edge-lord shock-jockery, but to really delve into why Cannibal Holocaust changed my life we have to get a bit autobiographical. See, back when I was stuck in the trenches of my Pathways Program where I did my HSC over a number of years instead of all at once, I had an elective called Society and Culture which kept me sane. It was not available to previous students who abandoned me to graduate up to college, and this class was one of the few respites from clinical depression I had during this dismal period in my life. It was my first taste of anthropology proper, and with the help of my aptly named teacher Mr. Champion I fell in love with the social sciences. I did my Personal Interest Project comparing “masculinity in the movies”, contrasting Hollywood in Fight Club to Bollywood in Shah Rukh Khan’s classic Devdas. Unsurprising results ensued, teenagers from Queensland who shall remain anonymous thought the more openly emotional Shah Rukh Khan was a bit “gay” compared to Brad Pitt when I did a focus group with them.. These kids disrespected Shah Rukh Khan, icon and sex symbol in Bollywood, because they didn’t know any better and I wasn’t allowed to judge their ignorance of Indian cinema’s premium grade hunks, and if I reminded them of this hotness I would have been accused by them of being homosexual myself. I was very young then and didn’t know what to do about Brad Pitt’s Tyler Durden being seen as a better role model than Shah Rukh Khan as a lower class Indian in love with a woman so much that he’s weeping over her. This focus group taught me a depressing lesson in Australian masculine ideals, and I suppose I should be grateful they provided their unfiltered opinions for the accuracy of my research.\n\nMr. Champion gave me good marks for my Personal Interest Project, and he was a companion when I had few of those to go around. I appreciated this education in concepts like globalisation and cultural relativism, one of my assignments was covering the otaku subculture when I was obsessed with anime and still blogged about it often. My homework on Speed Racer kept me occupied and gave me something to talk about with the other students, I recall doing an assignment on the Amish with Harrison Ford starring in Witness as a featured text of study. I still have the mini-DVD discs in my storage boxes which I can never reveal to anyone because of the terms and conditions of my focus group study and the ethics involved. Society and Culture was a winner in my books, and at the tail end of my high school career I couldn’t have asked for a better source of academic comfort food. As an autistic adult I was now learning about how men talk to other men about stuff, and how masculinity functioned, long before the toxic prefix complicated everything in my mind about who I was and what I could be. I still owned a fedora (which I later donated to Vinnie’s to get that relic of my Sensitive New Age Guy phase out of my house), and I grew past adolescence prior to Jordan Peterson ruining the discourse of manhood by attacking Marxist thought and belly-aching about BIPOC feminists having problems with white straight men.\n\nSociety and Culture remains a hazy melange of pleasant memories from my secret past as someone that could’ve majored in anthropology, but I majored in Photomedia (now Media Arts on my Sydney College of the Arts diploma) instead, because I wanted to be around creative people and artistic ideas. Mr. Champion moulded me into a student who was eager to learn about the world around me, and I miss him a lot, but one day I would find his cinematic equivalent in the performance of Debbie Does Dallas porn star Robert Kerman. The Kerminator, who appeared in Cannibal Holocaust, Cannibal Ferox and Eaten Alive (as well as a brief appearance in the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man film) exemplified all I had learned from Mr. Champion in my classes, a refusal to kowtow to racist imperialist thought, even if Mr. Champion didn’t have the porn-stache or a pipe like Professor Monroe did in Cannibal Holocaust the anti-imperialist ethos towards what we called “developing nations” instead of primitive was there. My autistic obsession with Robert Kerman’s Professor Monroe character wasn’t sexual in nature, I just saw a handsome guy who was wiser than the average American about places in the world that weren’t the United States. There was no fear that he was going to invade your country for oil in the name of freedom and liberty, he was just going to spill the straight facts about the situation. Every time I watch Cannibal Holocaust, he is the guiding light that leads me out of the darkness, and each viewing I can trust that Professor Monroe isn’t going to leave me behind.\n\nProfessor Monroe is a rare breed in Western media, he is neither Willard from Apocalypse Now who carries the “savagery” of the jungle with him after killing Col. Kurtz, nor is he the stereotyped grave robber that Indiana Jones is as the poster child for archaeology and the imperialist theft that comes with that brand of pulp adventurer’s profession. I love Indiana Jones, but he’s concerned with the stuff created by world cultures rather than the people affected by the actions of imperial powers plundering from developing nations who have no say in where these priceless treasures end up. In an era where we’re decolonising our approach to stolen artefacts with The Unfiltered History Tour and initiatives like it, Indy is the hero who feels like the old relic who should be in a museum whilst Professor Monroe has yet to reveal his message to a mainstream audience. The unfortunate animal cruelty contributes to Cannibal Holocaust being overlooked, and Robert Kerman disowned the film over these sequences. Most people will avoid or seek out the animal cruelty-free cut of Cannibal Holocaust, and it’s sad that Robert Kerman’s excellent performance as one of the film’s few likeable characters gets saddled with the baggage of this explicit content. Cannibal Holocaust is disturbing to sit through for a lot of reasons, such as the dissonant soundtrack by Riz Ortolani whose opening theme sounds like a dying dream almost, but Kerman isn’t one of them. He lends this movie a gentle, poignant soul it wouldn’t otherwise have, and for evidence of that see other cannibal cycle movies from the time like Cannibal Ferox where subtlety is thrown out the window like so many dismembered genitals. I was bummed out when Umberto Lenzi died, I liked his The Man From Deep River a lot, but for my money Cannibal Holocaust aims to a higher purpose and Lenzi’s Ferox revels in the mutilation of both animals and human characters for a rather hollow moral about violence breeding more violence tacked on at the end. Cannibal Holocaust bothers to follow through with its satirical point, Professor Monroe is distinct from his other appearances in Eaten Alive as a somewhat cranky jungle explorer for hire, and Cannibal Ferox as Lt. Rizzo. He’s more of an academic thrust into the bush by what we find out to be tragic circumstances. He’s likeable, even though he sometimes vomits at what he sees, and condemns the drug use of his tracker guide Chaco and a captured villager doing cocaine. This scene progresses to the on-screen killing of a coatimundi by one of the tracking party members using a switchblade, mutilated by the actor who murders it in a less than humane fashion. I’ve never seen the animal cruelty free version for myself, subjecting myself to the full strength experience has always been my preferred viewing because that’s how I first saw it and not having those scenes there feels weird to me. It’s upsetting, and it should be, however I once showed this movie to a female Fijian-Indian friend and she was more disturbed by the fake rape scenes than the genuine animal cruelty. I’m non-binary, a he/they and I’m still learning about the parts of me that are woman, and I’ve figured out most women are afraid of being raped more than they are of anything else in horror movies. It’s a legit concern, on a primal level I don’t yet understand, and when I get asked to accompany female friends to the ride home so they don’t get attacked I have to process the terror they feel about the mere possibilities of rape culture and its consequences. Meanwhile, Cannibal Holocaust’s animal cruelty is reminiscent of how people kill and cook dinner in some parts of the world and Westerners are quite removed from the process of meat ending up on their plates. Ruggero Deodato shouldn’t have filmed animals getting butchered on camera, maybe he was trying to save money on gore effects, maybe he was just an asshole, but you can not get away with doing something like that today. When Jackass Forever has approval from the Humane Association despite its bear and bee stunts, you really have to gain perspective and realise how low the bar is to not be a monster when you’re directing a movie for wide distribution.\n\nBesides the switchblade gift scene, one sequence in particular stuck with me in the cultural exchange department, Professor Monroe narrates the situation he’s in with the film canisters:\n\n“The Tree People would not let us bury the ghastly remains, they painted ochre, to drive away the evil spirits which the dead represented. Once again I ask myself what unspeakable crime could’ve called for such atrocious retribution. I know our lives are hanging by a thread, but I can’t turn back without at least trying to recover the footage that Alan Yates and the others paid for with their lives. I’m thinking of the enormous human and scientific interest this is going to contain. I must do something. Chaco and Miguel can’t possibly understand this, yet I must somehow gain the confidence of these savages. After all, they too have rules of conduct.”\n\nProfessor Monroe shoots a few rounds of ammunition at the sky, throwing his gun on the ground and lifting a cassette tape player like a boombox to the tribe he’s trying to negotiate with. He plays the recording of the tribe singing, and it gets a response by inviting them to dinner. Harold Monroe hesitates when he realises what’s on the menu, but part of that is due to the actor Robert Kerman being Jewish and biting on a piece of beef placed around the pork meat he was given by Ruggero Deodato to munch into. Like I said, this wasn’t the most ethical film shoot in the world, but at least Robert Kerman’s Jewishness was respected enough by the director to compromise on a prop food item. It’s interesting to note that a year prior in 1979, in the alternate ending to Apocalypse Now, John Milus intended to fire-bomb the Kurtz compound with the natives inside (which Francis Ford Coppola decided against to pursue his somewhat naive ending where war itself is meant to be interpreted as ending), but in Cannibal Holocaust released a year later in 1980… the natives aren’t shown to be subservient to whites nor are they shown as enemies to be slaughtered like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. They’re shown as cannibals, sure, but they are people with their own laws which they live by. Throughout the first half of this movie, it is clear that something has gone horribly wrong between the natives and the so-called civilised people who encountered them, and the suspense of finding that out drives the tension.\n\nThe second half of the film contains the bulk of the found footage gimmick, and Professor Monroe becomes less of an academic turned jungle explorer than the voice of reason and/or ethics in media. He tells a news interviewer what he had to do to get the film canisters out of the jungle. They thought that because he was capable of capturing the human voice, that he was capable of capturing their spirit, and that the Yanomomo tribe had no idea what a movie was yet understood the great and terrible power of the film canisters which unleashed what we discover to be abominable violence. The idea of there being an exchange rather than plundering these recordings from the tribe who held them hostage is reinforced again as Professor Monroe enters his second arc of the film where he pieces together the truth of the narrative which the editors of a sensational and borderline exploitative documentary distorts. Professor Monroe hesitates when he is offered the opportunity to host the program which killed the film crew who shot it, because at this point none of the footage has been viewed, and nobody has any idea about what horrors this criminal evidence contains. The TV executives recommend the film crew’s bereaved parents and wives be the judge about whether to air the footage, and to further shoot themselves in the foot, Professor Monroe is then shown one of their previous mondo documentaries called The Last Road To Hell, in which executions are staged by paid soldiers. This sequence of executions marks the point of no return for Yates and his crew, where their ethics are compromised by exploitation of their subject matter. Monroe reacts as you may expect to this material, dreading the worst from what he has yet to preview from the canisters salvaged from the jungle.\n\nCannibal Holocaust is a found-footage film in its structure, but it’s really a half-and-half use of this gimmick since we see footage that was not captured by the doomed director and his crew that gives the audience the idea “Maybe Alan Yates and company were not the most well-loved folks.” People who knew them don’t have much good to say about them, ranging from accusations that Alan Yates is a paranoid egomaniac who wanted blood to general dismissal of “My son was no good!”. Some are grief stricken, some seem to be glad they’re gone out of their lives, it’s nihilistic and rather sad when you think about it. When somebody dies, we all check Twitter for the digital Egyptian Weighing of the Heart ceremony that social media enables, and while some urge us all to have respect for the dead - this is often the time where mourning is interrupted by allegations of misconduct and myriad sins which death doesn’t always absolve. We saw this when Margaret Thatcher passed away and Britons responded with Ding Dong (The Witch Is Dead), and we’ll likely see it again when Henry Kissinger and Rupert Murdoch cark. I wouldn’t expect Ruggero Deodato to uphold the value of human life in his movies, however in his other film Cut and Run we get a much more sympathetic reaction to the death of a female character who’s been through the wringer. A simple “Did she suffer?” says so much in one line, and while Cannibal Holocaust isn’t going for that it does humanise the deceased cast a little before revealing the gut-punch of what has occurred. We get small morsels of details about their lives, how a wife thinks their husband was good in bed and not very bright, as well as whether she can get any bread out of this interview for her family. I like the scene with the nun talking about Faye while she tries to wrangle a class of children and a flute player wearing a beret is seen nearby, it’s some of the most compassionate treatment Faye receives in this movie.\n\nWell, there’s no turning back now, Cannibal Holocaust presents us with some of its worst flaws. Faye informs her cameraman that if she was in New York right now, she’d probably be out shopping, biting commentary on consumerism which is about to be reinforced by the film’s text. I’m not going to show you what happens to the animals in this segment, but I will describe it.\n\nThe turtle scene is among the more infamous sequences in the film, and I can’t blame people for being put off by it. It’s one of the most unappetising depictions of food preparation I’ve ever seen where they chop off the turtle’s head and play with its guts and assorted body parts before cooking the meat of this poor creature on a fire. The actress playing Faye Daniels, the female crew member, even sits near a log and vomits as the evil filmmakers tear this turtle apart, and I doubt she’s acting with that puke. The actors forced to commit these acts on camera were reportedly pissed that they were killing animals for real in a motion picture which would be accused of being a snuff film, and the animal cruelty aspect of the film warps reality enough for you to believe it. I then had to sit through the snakebite scene, where the guide Filipe is bitten by a snake (which is murdered with a machete) and has his leg amputated with what I presume is the same machete. The psychotic rationale behind this sequence has never sat right with me, as the amputation done wouldn’t help much against the venom spreading through the victim’s system. These idiots in the jungle film Faye while she’s trying to go to the toilet, and shoot a villager in the leg while they’re in the middle of eating delicious monkey brains.\n\nProfessor Monroe sits on a bench with a TV executive, chatting about the shocking footage:\n\nTV EXECUTIVE: Phew, I’m drained. You must admit it’s exceptional footage. I didn’t expect such impact, such authenticity!\n\nMONROE: I don’t know. I don’t think exceptional is the right word.\n\nTV EXECUTIVE: You don’t?\n\nMONROE: No. I mean, what’s exceptional about a primitive tribe of Yacumo being terrorised and forced into doing something they don’t normally do?\n\nTV EXECUTIVE: C’mon now Professor! Let’s be realistic! Who knows anything about the Yacumo civilisation? Today people want sensationalism. The more you rape their senses the happier they are!\n\nMONROE: Ah, yes, that’s typical Western thought. Civilised, isn’t it? That’s what Alan thought, and that’s why he’s dead. The Yacumo Indian is a primitive, and he has to be respected as such. Y’know did you ever think of the Yacumo point of view, that we might be the ones who are savages?\n\nTV EXECUTIVE: (Laughs) Well, I’ve never thought of it that way, but it’s an interesting idea.\n\nMONROE: Yes, let’s say things were reversed, right? And the Yacumo attacked your house, defiled everything you held holy. Y’know that pig that was killed? That was food for those people. Now, what if somebody came into your house in your country and took a little food you had in the refrigerator and threw it down the toilet? Would you behave in a civilised way?\n\n(Pause) Would you like people to make money off your misery?\n\nIt’'s a short dialogue scene, but it sets up the themes of Cannibal Holocaust so well, even if it is a bit on the nose. Robert Kerman portrays Monroe as an empathetic anthropologist (although his use of the word primitive isn’t the most progressive by today’s standards, it gets the point across for 1980 audiences watching this in the grindhouse theatres of 42nd Street. That’s what I like about horror movies, they address taboos right out in the open in ways few other genres can get away with. Robert Kerman lends his own humanity to this movie and the role he’s playing in it, in lesser hands this whole production could’ve been devoid of subtlety and poignancy. Ruggero Deodato is not the most sensitive artist out there, but I do think he pulled off something great in this movie.\n\nOkay, time to expunge some trauma by letting it bleed out of my pen. Cannibal Holocaust is not the worst film I have ever seen, nor is Jupiter Ascending or any number of box office bombs which have come out during my lifetime. I’m rather forgiving of bad movies as long as they don’t break me like the reigning champion of hurt did when my father found this… soul-scathing documentary on Islam to help me study for my Studies of Religion exams. This piece of shit started out on an ominous note, with ratings advice stating it would be disturbing to some viewers. Some viewers? Who wouldn’t be disturbed by this footage, Ed fucking Kemper? Anyway, I start watching this Islam documentary which is downright G-rated and covers helpful stuff which was on the exam like the five pillars that Muslims follow which I have since forgotten having data dumped this useful information due to HSC stress overclocking my brain. Nothing about this horrendous documentary seemed at all alarming or hinted that it would contain content which would scar me for life, until it swerved to footage of female genital mutilation. Even though it was subtitled, that little girl begging for her parents or the doctor not to cut her will haunt me until the day I die. It was a disgraceful lapse of documentary filmmaking which jettisoned its goal of making the viewer less afraid of Muslims by showing uncensored one of the most controversial practices associated with this world religion, and then it switched back to more innocuous facts about Islam. I was pissed the fuck off, and traumatised by this footage, a compassionate and sane father would’ve turned it off immediately and hugged me until the trembling stopped. This is not what my father did, he forced me to keep watching no matter what other nasty surprises were next. He did this because he thought he was helping, and maybe he was right because come exam time for HSC Studies of Religion comes this curve-ball question where you had to defend Islam against Richard Dawkins. I did not become an Islamophobe in the grand tradition of the New Atheist movement which had intimidated the clergy of my cathedral school enough to have a Jesus for Skeptics group set up to combat the godlessness of the time. I sat there, fuming at the gall of the question, and as if by automatic writing guided by the hand of Allah I aced the exam question when so many had their bell curve grades destroyed by it that I read about it in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. The whole HSC exam question situation reminds me a lot about how in the movie Slumdog Millionaire, each of the questions the main character gets right is tied into a traumatic event in his past which forces him to remember when the pressure and stakes are high. Slumdog Millionaire had a pretty messed up premise, Danny Boyle really pushed the envelope of mainstream cinema by showing scenes where little kids are blinded so they can become better beggars and I don’t think people realise how dark that movie got, it’s been a while but certain elements stuck with me long after the Oscar buzz died down and everyone collectively wiped it from memory. I can forgive Danny Boyle, those kids were just acting.\n\nAfter graduating high school, I thought I could put that unpleasantness behind me forever, until I caught a screening of Disney’s Wreck-It Ralph and all of a sudden the scene where Vanellope’s kart gets broken by Ralph triggers my PTSD of seeing and hearing that little Muslim girl getting her vagina cut (which is what Sarah Silverman’s crying sounded like to my ears). I have a Vanellope doll on my shelf because I relate to her disabled struggles, I’m very protective of her because she was the last plaything I bought from Toys R’ Us when it was still open. I chose to talk about my ‘Nam flashback i had in the Mandarin Center Hoyts cinema here instead of a critique of Wreck-it Ralph on its own because I refuse to inflict my trauma onto little kids who might enjoy analysis of Wreck-It Ralph without me being a stone cold bummer about how I’d use that movie to cry so I can prove to a federal judge I’m not a replicant. To be honest, Sgt. Calhoun’s arc in Wreck-It Ralph explained what was happening to me as I was triggered by Vanellope’s kart-breaking scene when I first saw it, prior to that I didn’t use think of myself of having a trigger for anything.\n\nI also didn’t really have the vocabulary to express my seething fury about this accursed, nameless documentary I was damaged by, until Cannibal Holocaust came along granting me a perfect movie-speech to reply to trash of this nature:\n\n“I’m not speaking as a scientist, but as a man on the street. This so-called documentary footage is offensive, it is dishonest, and above all, it is inhuman!”\n\nI realised then upon watching this what had overcome me when I faced down the barrel of my HSC examiner. I had Kerman Rage, and it burned unstoppable. My reaction to what had traumatised me was given a name and a face to identify with, which I often struggle with as an autistic person who sees in pictures but doesn’t have the right picture yet; but that picture had never been clearer than when I saw Professor Monroe laying the smackdown on these corrupt TV executives who wanted to air the found footage from Cannibal Holocaust. To me these villains represented the absurdity of the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification, and how the system failed to protect me from FGM footage which was not given a sufficient warning for. I was disgusted with the OFLC refusing a classification certificate for Fallout 3 in ye olden days before we had an R-18+ for video games due to some drug references in the power-ups, heaven forbid gamers shoot up into their fictional veins, meanwhile showing some poor helpless Muslim girl having a doctor mutilate her with no anaesthesia is appropriate for Australian broadcasting. I wanted to burn down the OFLC to cinders, I was so angry. I bore a grudge against the OFLC ever since, and continue to be outraged by their stupid decisions like briefly banning Disco Elysium of all bloody things (oh, because THAT’S what gamers need protection from?) when shit like that so-called documentary which was inflicted on my mind exists and aired on TV with no problem. Let me remind you, Shocking Asia, a mondo documentary of the sort Cannibal Holocaust is satirising, doesn’t drop the ball when discussing the process of male to female transition surgery, and that thing is a pretty racist product of its exploitation cinematic moment. The idea that the disreputable horror-adjacent filmmakers do a better job tackling taboo subjects than the respectable middle-brow Oscar bait crowd is not a new concept, but it’s worth considering. Point is, you have to be careful how you depict world cultures and religions in documentaries, and the way the documentary I saw on Islam while I was taking notes for my exams represented a major faith ain’t it, chief. Cannibal Holocaust is disturbing as all hell, but I would rather watch it than FGM footage any day of the week. What makes me furious is that Westerners pretend FGM isn’t done by white people as well as Somalia and Sierra Leone, preferring instead to whip up anti-immigrant sentiment by ignoring how Christians are up to this blight on humanity as well. I will likely never watch another documentary about FGM as long as I live, nor will I check out The Green Inferno directed by Eli Roth because there’s a subplot which revolves around FGM in it. There’s apparently a gatekeeping problem in the horror community, which is terrible because Cannibal Holocaust’s devoted fanbase are often stereotyped as edge-lord contrarians on TikTok where the Gen-Z kids are starting to sour on this movie as well as other extreme cinema offerings like A Serbian Film. I’m not trying to win a prize for bravery, I’m just trying to live my life, and I have my own limits when it comes to stuff I’m willing to watch even if that gets me dismissed as a horror fan because of that. Again, I haven’t seen everything out there, but I did go see Midsommar which prompted me to warn an ex-girlfriend of my brother’s not to watch it because it starts with a murder-suicide and this woman had a family member die by their own hand. I won’t name her for privacy’s sake but I’m just letting you know I’m courteous about people who have triggers about transgressive films.\n\nThere’s an unsettling rape scene where Faye objects to wasting film canisters on in the final section of Cannibal Holocaust’s found footage narrative, and although this would be upsetting unto itself, the presence of a villager hiding just out of sight of the white men in the bushes prompts us to remember this is an invasion of native territory, and evil done in the jungle will be punished by its own people. The villager lies in wait, just out of shot, it’s a very effective device. The continued abuse of indigenous villagers by Alan Yates and his film crew leads to perhaps the most notorious scene in the movie, with the impaled girl who they raped stuck through the mouth with a sharp wooden pike. When I first saw this scene, I assumed life could never imitate art, but reality has a way of depressing me. I can’t help seeing parallels between Alan Yates coming across a dead body he films and Logan Paul doing the same except in the Japanese Aokigahara forest instead of the Amazon. Much like Ruggero Deodato’s other film Cut and Run, in which a news broadcast shows a beheading live on broadcast, incidents like the Christchurch mosque shootings being live-streamed prove to us that it’s Deodato’s world, and we’re living in it. Cannibal Holocaust may have been the first found-footage gimmick film, but much of it was ahead of its time, predating the success of The Blair Witch Project by a decade. The final sequence where the film troupe of Alan Yates is butchered by cannibals is distressing in its realism due to the handheld guerrilla filmmaking techniques and obscuring certain details as we see characters dragged off to their doom in the distance. Poor Faye is gang-raped and beheaded, another member of the crew is castrated, all of this is scored to Riz Ortolani’s haunting compositions. We see Alan Yates’ demise up close, as his bloodied head hits the ground and the film reel ends.\n\nThe climax of Cannibal Holocaust is a sombre one, with the television executives ordering the grim material documenting the demise of the film crew burned, and Professor Monroe goes outside smoking his pipe, remarking “I wonder who the real cannibals are?”. To top off this bleak sit of a movie, the end credits inform us that the footage was somehow distributed to someone who bought it for $250,000 and the projectionist was given a two-month suspended sentence for illegal appropriation of film footage. I know that seems tacked on at the end, but it builds upon the snuff film reputation that this movie had to shake at the request of a federal judge. I’ve seen this movie dozens of times, and to an extent I’m desensitised to it for reasons I cited earlier, but I reckon Cannibal Holocaust holds up now because of our current media landscape chasing down lurid tabloid true crime stories for profit. In universe, nobody would have cared about the mondo documentary Alan Yates was making if he didn’t die a horrible death whilst making it, and the TV executives might have shelved it if it was just another boring nature picture. For years I have been thinking about Cannibal Holocaust and the impact it left on me, most notably the way it inspired the short film I made for my BVA graduation show at Sydney College of the Arts.\n\nOne afternoon I saw some footage on YouTube of a protest that was going down on Sydney University campus, and even though the video was pretty disturbing, something felt familiar about it which struck my creative imagination. I had to work fast, downloading the video and in the space of about twenty-four hours I made a mashup of Robert Kerman’s Cannibal Holocaust clip reacting to how the students were being dragged away by cops like how the filmmakers in Cannibal Holocaust were dragged to their doom. I consulted my film school educated brother about how to time the clips, and within a day I had the mashup completed. It didn’t go viral like I thought such a provocative piece of mashup agitprop would do, but when I exhibited it in front of my Sydney College of the Arts teachers it was much better received because it was advocating for university staff who were having their pay cut. One of my teachers even felt nostalgic about being beaten by cops at a protest way back when, which is messed up as anything adjacent to Cannibal Holocaust can be. It was thrilling to see parents with children stopping by my exhibit to see clips of Robert Kerman condemning police brutality inflicted on students my age, some of these gallery audiences had never seen or heard of Ruggero Deodato’s infamous film but were intrigued by what I was laying down about what happened. I put my mashup on Vimeo and left it alone, after I gradated I didn’t really think it would make any more impact. But I was wrong.\n\nI remember I was screaming, my brain overtaken by dopamine and almost getting high off it, straight up screaming “AHHHHHGHHHHH!” with joy over this exchange. Professor Monroe himself assessed the quality of my school project and gave me the equivalent of an A+. It was probably the proudest moment of my long and hard academic career, I jumped ship without pursuing honours because it was clear that the foundational rug of Sydney College of the Arts was about to be pulled from under the teachers and students working on the offshoot campus in Balmain, far away from the main campus where I graduated from a sandstone university making my parents proud. I’m not sure my parents would be proud of me seeing a male porn star as a role model, an anchor of my ethical bedrock, but they wouldn’t understand why I love the Kerminator. He passed away, I heard it after the fact when a horror host by the name of Doctor Wolfula said so in his own review of Cannibal Holocaust, and although it sounds selfish, I wish Robert Kerman could have stuck around long enough to see that success he wished me. I don’t see these dead people as gone due to my Taoist beliefs, but I do notice their absence in the world around us and part of me wishes some of my favourite celebrities managed to see my novels published or stuff like that. It’s why even though Kanye West is a problematic figure, I always take his maxim “give them the roses while they can smell them” to heart. We don’t know how long we’ve got on this planet, but whenever I watch movies with dead people in them, it’s easy to forget they aren’t alive. Robert Kerman was a man with the soul of a poet, trapped in ugly exploitation cannibal movies, I wish he could have diversified his roles more in prestigious projects that would’ve made him happier than the sleazy ghetto he was confined to. Although I never met the man in person, I’ll miss him, before Ruth Bader Ginsburg died I had no clue what the protocol is when a Jewish icon dies, but Twitter taught me to use the phrase “May his memory be a blessing” regarding Robert Kerman. I’m glad any work I ever did had an impact on somebody else’s life, in the end all we can do is try to make the world a better place while we’re still here and leave behind something decent for people to remember us by. It’s hard to defend Cannibal Holocaust on those grounds, but I can always vouch for Professor Monroe and the lessons he taught me in college."
