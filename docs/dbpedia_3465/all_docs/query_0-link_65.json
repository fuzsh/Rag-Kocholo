The National Park Service initiated extensive search efforts in the area. Due to a lack of clues and extreme winter conditions, the search entered limited continuous operations on March 11, 2019. Additional coordinated search efforts were conducted on multiple occasions during the summer and fall of 2019.\n\nName: Peter Jackson\n\nMissing from: Yosemite National Park\n\nDate Missing: September 17, 2016\n\nDescription: Jackson was 74 years old at the time he went missing.
