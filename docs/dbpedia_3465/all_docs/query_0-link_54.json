        "text": "Informed by Eastern philosophy and psychological theory, White’s work has been called “a magical act”\n\nUsing stylized gestures used as a mode of ritualistic format and screen performance, White’s modus operandi is often an exploration on the subject of relationships of power and repression; often drawing from historic or ancient stories re-contextualized into meditations on the world in which we live and the ramifications of inaction and stagnation. Studies at the Pennsylvania Academy’s painting program, influence an editing technique akin to “automatic” writing.\n\nESSAY FILMS — EXPERIMENTAL DOCUMENTARY\n\n2020\n\nGRANDMOTHER’S MIRROR – Work in Progress; TRT: 14.13; My uncle Buddy died, a few years after the flu epidemic, from whooping cough in 1924.

And so, with today’s new global COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve employed this footage, shot and gathered some ago, as a meditation on 2020.

Cinematic Form: 2 Versions: TRT 38.14 & 10 minutes\n\nCompositions from the cities of New York after 9/11 and Chaco Canyon. Chaco was once a major center of a thriving Indian culture from AD 850 to 1250, where, turquoise, a stone mythically born from the marriage between sky and earth, was traded extensively. The complexity of its community life, the high level of its social organization, and its far-reaching commerce created a cultural vision unlike any other seen before. David Stuart’s anthropological argument in ANASAZI AMERICA claims that today’s American society has similar patterns that existed in Chaco’s Anasazi community before its final collapse. TURQUOISE BEADS was inspired by one archaeologist’s tale: Upon excavating an abandoned kiva, turquoise beads were found scattered over the floor. Many kivas (circular underground chambers used by the community for ceremonial meetings) were burned as a way to “close” them when Chaco was abandoned in the thirteenth century. Because of the range and pattern of the scatter it was surmised that the beads had been assembled on a necklace strand and were popped apart during in a ritual of final departure. The layer of moving strands of rippling ‘beads’ throughout this film connect the two landscapes. These ‘beads’ originated as TV noise from a dying box television set, in my hotel room in Atlanta Georgia, where National Guard troops were being deployed to fight in Iraq.\n\n2008\n\nTHE FUTURE IS YOU; 9.17 minutes\n\nNew York City after the 9/11 disaster in monochrome; landscapes shifting between trees and streets.\n\n3 DAYS; TRT. 5.30 to 7.00 minutes\n\nThe same landscape shot over 3 days mimics grids and rows (calendar forms), as fuchsia flowers gestate and multiply….\n\nEARTH IS THE GARDEN; 4.58 minutes\n\nEnvironmental concerns: singing frogs stimulate their surroundings.\n\nCRACKED; 3.22 minutes; “Let’s GO!”, a second of fragmented tape locks a figure inside its horizontal roll.\n\nANOTHER TRIP; 2.41 minutes\n\nInterplay from inside and out of a motor trailer.\n\n11th HOUR; 2.40 minutes\n\nHorrific encounter: humans engulfed in Nature\n\nSTRIKING GOLD; 0.51 minutes\n\nHaiku: Spring walk through the woods.\n\nFOR SALLY; 2.37 minutes\n\nReal time/life- a beached ball has a way of changing things.\n\n2007\n\nSAILING to BYZANTIUM; 12.05 minutes; Sound: cassette tape of a family’s recited poems.\n\nVisuals: simultaneously in the two grand-mother lands at once; a Slovenian town square at sunset, and in Ireland rummaging through the other’s forgotten property.\n\nNO FIT PLACE (part 3 of Triptych); 2.14 minutes\n\nPortrait: with emotions of delight, fear & horror\n\nSUB ROSA (part 2 of Triptych); 3.53 minutes\n\nPortrait: the emotion: of joy\n\nTHE GROUND FROM UNDERNEATH (1 of Triptych); 2.18 minutes\n\nPortrait: the emotion of loss\n\n2006\n\nGOODBYE SKY GOODBYE EARTH; 4.40 minutes;\n\nIn the desert in real life: a sunset, a TV on the fritz in the desert, a Hi8 video camera breaking down- all taken advantage of to make this edited-in-the-camera piece, with added soundtrack and one obvious visual element.
