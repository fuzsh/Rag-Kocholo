        "text": "🏢 To transition to a fair, green, and inclusive economy, we must transform our built environment. Buildings account for nearly 40% of emissions and are the largest asset class globally, involving millions in construction and maintenance. 🤝 We foster collaboration among cities, industry, investors, workers, and residents to influence practices and policies. Our interventions support partners in showcasing urban development best practices that ensure affordability, reduce emissions, and create equitable spaces. 🌟 Our focus areas: · Building performance: Engaging with investors, developers, designers, and public authorities. · Whole Life Carbon Emissions: Emphasizing circularity and sufficiency. · Social impacts: Addressing labor rights and resident impacts. · European countries: Leveraging our networks to drive a just transition. 🔗 Join us in transforming buildings for a sustainable future.

A recent Knight Frank survey found 74% of UK investors use CRREM before purchasing assets, with over half requiring it for acquisition due diligence. 🌍 This success highlights the industry's commitment to sustainable investment.

Our Director of Industry Programmes Amol Mehra caught up with Fashion for Good's Managing Director Katrin Ley to dive into their renewed strategy, focusing on enabling the widespread adoption and scale of innovations and the four unlocks to driving fashion's transformation.

The conclusions: - Collaboration is critical to taking ideas from seed to scale - Joint commitments, financing and coordinated action across the value chain is required - For innovators it’s critical to focus on continuous impact and optimising R&D - Brands need to signal demand, make and honour commitments, set and embed KPIs throughout the organisation - Supportive policy and regulation, alongside an evolving capital stack that scales with innovators is vital. 🔗 Read more about our work in the fashion industry on our renewed website. https://lnkd.in/e7jwk9c5 #CircularFashion #NextGen"
