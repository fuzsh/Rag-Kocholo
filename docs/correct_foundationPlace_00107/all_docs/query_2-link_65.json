        "text": "Villiers de L’Isle-Adam, (1838-89), impoverished literary aristocrat, friend to Baudelaire, Mallarmé and Wagner, is widely considered, alongside Maupassant, to be the principle storyteller of his age. His tales, the Contes cruels, published in 1883, follow the French tradition of the Fantastic, offering variants on the ghost story and the supernatural escapade, charged with an ornate spiritualism, frequently icy in tone and savage in their irony. Black humour is often used as a critical device; Villiers’ perception was that, as readers, we are naturally more receptive to a critic who makes us laugh rather than one who attacks us.\n\nThis essay examines Elizabeth Inchbald’s treatment of French Revolutionary women and relationship to European drama in order to appreciate the implications of tragic writing for British women playwrights. Focusing on Inchbald’s connections to French culture and English theater in late 1792 and early 1793 elucidates the self‐censoring and generic conventions of her only tragedy, The Massacre. Events in France like the September Massacres unsettled Burkean notions of femininity and raised the possibility of female violence. This mixing of traditional gender characteristics resembles discourse about Inchbald’s dramas as neither tragic, comic, nor tragicomic. The genre of tragic farce describes Inchbald’s revisions of French sentimental comedy (comédie larmoyante) and experimentations with the evolving form of drama (drame). Inchbald’s adaptation of Gresset’s The Villain (Le Méchant) into a farce, Young Men and Old Women, demonstrates techniques applied to The Massacre and Every One Has His Fault. The paper concludes with a comparison of The Massacre to its source, Louis‐Sébastien Mercier’s drama, Jean Hennuyer, or the Bishop of Lizieux (1773), the first documentation of this once‐uncertain genealogy. This comparative analysis shows that Inchbald’s tragedy critiques the comic improbability that women stand to lose their femininity if they involve themselves in public issues."
