Altogether we sat down with:\n\nDuane Carter, Ed.D (Board Chair, Northwest Area Foundation)\n\nDan Chu (Executive Director, Sierra Club Foundation)\n\nErika Seth Davies (Chief Executive Officer, Rhia Ventures)\n\nTimothy O’Donnell, CAIA (Senior Vice President, Fund Evaluation Group, and financial advisor to Sierra Club Foundation)\n\nKatherine Pease (Managing Director, Pathstone)\n\nThe discussion was hosted by our friends at RBC Global Asset Management and you can access a full recording here: https://institutional.rbcgam.com/en/us/us/article/navigating-your-new-role/detail\n\nIn the video above we highlight some key takeaways from the webinar:\n\nInvestment committees sit in a powerful place to work on racial equity\n\nA non-profit fiduciary is obedient to the mission and to just systems.\n\nInvestment Policy Statements can reflect core foundation values.\n\nFoundations are important players for systems change\n\nYou are not alone!\n\nWe're here to support you in this work and look forward to learning with you as we reimagine foundation investing together."
