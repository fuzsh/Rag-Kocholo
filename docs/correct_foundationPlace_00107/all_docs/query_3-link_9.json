        "text": "The Council on Foundations is a nonprofit membership association that serves as a guide for philanthropies as they advance the greater good. Definitions of hate and extremism can be found on their website. Also, here is a definition from the Southern Poverty Law Center:\n\n“The Southern Poverty Law Center defines a hate group as an organization that – based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities – has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics. We do not list individuals as hate groups, only organizations.\n\nThe organizations on our hate group list vilify others because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity – prejudices that strike at the heart of our democratic values and fracture society along its most fragile fault lines.\"\n\nHatred is the opposite of charity. By caring about equity and opposing hate, we invest in a community where all people can embrace the full spectrum of their human rights, fostering empathy, respect and a more harmonious city.\n\nBy 2050, our country stands to realize an $8 trillion gain in gross domestic product by closing the U.S. racial equity gap. This involves eliminating disparities that hinder the potential and economic contributions of people. Beyond an increase in economic output, advancing racial equity can boost consumer spending and tax revenues, while reducing social services spending and health-related costs.\n\nIn around 25 years, when today’s children enter their prime working years, people of color will represent half the total population and workforce. Investing now in dismantling racist systems ensures a future workforce ready to excel in technology, arts, education, healthcare, business and governance."
