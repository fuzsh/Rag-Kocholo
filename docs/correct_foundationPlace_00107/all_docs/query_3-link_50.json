        "text": "Autumn has always been a favorite time of the year for me. In the northeast of the U.S., where I live, the fall equinox (one of the two times of the year when the days and nights are equal in duration) brings us crisp and cool evenings and this is the time when the hills where I live become aflame with color. The leaves of the trees turn the most beautiful shades of yellow, orange, and red as millions of these brilliant little flags signal the changing of the seasons. The summer’s agricultural bounty is filling barns, warehouses, and farmers markets, too. And for those of us who preserve our own garden’s produce, multitudes of colorful jars, bags, bowls and boxes fill pantries: a variety of fruits, beans, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, squash, and more. Not only that, favorite fall foods are on menus everywhere: roast turkey, cranberries, and pumpkin pies. In the more northerly areas of North America where winter brings cold and snow covers the earth for months on end, the fall season symbolizes the time of plenty in the celestial turnings. It’s the time of the year when the days become steadily shorter and nights become progressively longer with each rotation of the Earth. Fall is a time of returning darkness and cold, but it is also a time for holidays and celebrations: Halloween and Thanksgiving, and soon after, the joy of Christmastime follows. For much of my life, in the fall, my attention turned toward joyous celebrations of good food and more good things to come.\n\nHowever, as I have aged and continue my ongoing learning journey, this time of year has become, for me, not only a time for harvests and gratitude for good things, it is also a time when I focus my attention on a deeper understanding of history. Fall holidays include Labor Day, which is a remembrance of the war the common people waged in order to gain workers’ rights in the United States. Veterans’ Day, November 11, originates as Armistice Day to commemorate the “eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month” of 1918, which signaled the end of World War I. Today, when we observe Veterans’ Day, we recall and show respect for the service and sacrifice of all veterans of all wars. Columbus Day has recently taken on new meaning for me, as it has for many others in the U.S. This day, I also acknowledge Indigenous People’s Day. My personal learning journey includes acknowledging often-silenced historical events, many of which carry pain and suffering, even trauma for many, and I feel responsibility toward renewed commitments for healing and for justice.\n\nAt this time of year, I contemplate my ancestors’ journeys from their places of origin to new homes on these lands we now call America. I am filled with questions. Where did my ancestors come from? Why were they compelled to create a new way of life far away from the places of their ancestors? Why is a deep understanding of this knowledge removed from my family’s memory? What shall I do to restore a familial historical remembering? Indigenous Peoples’ Day as well as Native American Heritage Month in November bring additional questions to my mind. Who originally occupied the land I live on? Where are these Peoples now? What is their history and what are their contributions to U.S. culture? What is our shared history? What current issues are they facing today? For me, autumn is no longer just a season of celebrating good food, good things, and more good things to come; it’s also a season of discomfort, one in which I often feel unsettled.\n\nThe questions I have been asking myself began while taking some courses. That is, at almost fifty years old, I decided to go to college. Specifically, after an unusually tough day at work (one in which I was unable to successfully resolve a conflict) I decided to go to college to earn what I initially imagined as a degree in Peace Studies. The enforced helplessness in the conflict situation compelled me to search out and understand the underpinnings of conflict and social unrest, in addition to possible solutions.\n\nMy studies began with classes related to conflict resolution and those that would help me understand people’s attitudes and actions, that is, classes in each of the social sciences. I also signed up for courses related to social inequality, power, and privilege, and those dealing with peace and social change while expanding my inquiries into history, as well. My questions increased. Who were the people who labored to build U.S. wealth and national power and what were their everyday lives like? Why does the New York State educational system label and classify Native American studies as “Other World Civilizations” instead of American History? Why, in Western history, is there so much violence toward women? Why, in Western history, have women’s voices been too often silenced? My professors guided me with a growing understanding of social inequities and paths for change as well as the fact that we imperfect human beings, because of various cognitive biases, have problems with perception. That is, I began to realize that perhaps the world as I had always seen it is not all there is to see.\n\nFor this reason, I began to delve into searching out other ways of knowing and understanding our world. A class titled Indigenous Knowledge and Ways of Knowing turned out, to my surprise, to be a social science methodology class, one based on the writings of Bagele Chilisa, a Botswanan post-colonial research scholar. This class was based on her textbook, Indigenous Research Methodologies, which focuses on methods that differ from those in the Western academy. This is also the time I came across courses with an interesting word in their title: Survivance. That term survivance resonated with me and roused my interest in courses that I otherwise would not have considered in my degree plan. So, I added Native American Plants: Pathways, Prophesies, and Survivance as well as Native American Women: Cultural Transformation and Survivance. These three courses, in particular, helped me to see the world through a new-to-me and expanding cultural lens.\n\nI would like to expand a little about the notion of problems with perception. There is a term, centric, that describes a standpoint or orientation in worldviews. Ego-centric is a self-centered stance. Eco-centric is a nature or ecology centered paradigm. Euro-centric is based on European understandings while Afro-centric is based on African ways of knowing, and so on. Additionally, we can think of worldviews in terms of being Western in orientation (generally individualistic, hierarchical, and competitive ways) in contrast to a typical Indigenous orientation (generally more community-minded, and more egalitarian and cooperative ways). Orientation in regard to worldviews impacts how people approach social justice concerns. Often, in Western cultures, justice efforts are focused on deficits of people and people groups: how “we” can “help the poor” with our charitable efforts, for example. Indigenous research methods specialist, Bagele Chilisa, suggests that we can better shape greater degrees of social justice by moving away from a deficit-based orientation and moving, instead, toward reinforcing practices that are life sustaining. In this way, Afro-centric, Indigenous, and Eco-centric worldviews and responses to injustices often perceive beyond deficits and instead converge in their focus on that which sustains and enhances lives.\n\nOur attention is now focused on that which sustains and enhances life. So, I will write a bit about food. In the class titled Native American Plants: Pathways, Prophesies, and Survivance I engaged in botanical research of certain food plants in a cultural context. I think most folks living in the U.S. already know that maize (corn), beans, and squash are known as the Three Sisters in many (if not all) Native American cultures, and therefore, these foods originate with Native American stewardship of these plants. Surprising to me was to learn that Irish potatoes (Irish being part of my ethnic heritage) are actually plants that originated in the Americas! So, too, I learned, do Italian tomatoes, chili peppers, peanuts, and cacao from which chocolate is made have origins in the Americas, along with the basis of our traditional Thanksgiving meal in the U.S. – turkey, cranberries, and pumpkins. We refer to the spread of these food plants to Europe and the “Old World” (i.e., not only Europe but also the entire East) and that which was brought to the Americas from the “Old World” (e.g., coffee, bananas, wheat, rice, barley, cattle, sheep, swine) as the Columbian Exchange. This exchange that was created by an increasingly globalized economy also brought the international slave trade and the transfer of European diseases and death to the Peoples of the Americas in the form of smallpox, influenza, malaria, etc. Survivance is an expression that describes the ability to overcome and thrive even in the midst of such hardships.\n\nReading about this notion of survivance was an awakening for me. Rather than waiting for the powers that be to shape greater social justice, Survivance, as Anishinaabe writer and scholar Gerald Vizenor explains, involves (in part) people standing against injustices by making oppression-free spaces for creating and maintaining healthy (and by healthy, that means respectful, power-balanced, and reciprocal) relationships and more just and peaceful societies. Survivance, then, is the expression of empowerment in action, but not the sort of empowering based on charity or moving up a social hierarchy, but rather it is an empowerment that dismantles oppressive systems by creating a balance where power imbalances exist.\n\nThat sort of power can be explained by Haudenosaunee authors. In particular, Lina Sunseri and Patricia A. Monture,describe examples of survivance enacted by women as they strive to “Mother their Nations.” According to Sunseri in Sky Woman Lives On, Oneida/Haudenosaunee women are political leaders who stand against the dominant patriarchal notions of submissive women and motherhood and create a space free from the constraints of oppression to ensure, not only the healthy growth of their own children, but also the wellbeing of their entire communities and nations. Monture points out in Women’s Words: Power, Identity, and Indigenous Sovereignty that exclusions and power are often connected. That is, creating a system of labeling and classifying and the power to name can be political. She states that including Native oral Keepings as legitimate forms of knowledge as part of the predominant paradigm would require many to experience a shift in perspective, creating a discomforting cognitive dissonance for many. Therefore, in order to avoid any discomfort, deficit-theorizing about ‘legitimacy’ often serve as exclusionary tactics for the purpose of coercion and control. Sunseri holds that oral traditions are a form of legitimate knowledge and should be accepted in the dominant culture, including the Western Academy. Sunseri and Monture “Mother their Nations” by empowering themselves as well as their communities.\n\nThe notion of survivance, understood in this way, created a shift in my own worldview. This shift presents me with a sort of cultural and historical roadmap for paths to empowerment to which I can readily relate and embrace in my own life and circumstances.\n\nThe Haudenosaunee are the Peoples indigenous to the places where I have lived most of my life and are commonly referred to by the French term Iroquois. They are a peace confederacy of nations consisting of the original Five Nations: the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca who were later joined by the Tuscarora in the 1700s after they fled persecution in their southern homelands. The confederacy then also became known as the Six Nations. Often unacknowledged, the Haudenosaunee are a major influence on mainstream U.S. culture. That is, concepts of liberty, freedoms, rights, and social equality did not originate with Peoples who come from cultures that embraced a notion of the divine rights of kings. According to a publication of the National Museum of the American Indian titled Haudenosaunee Guide for Educators, the Haudenosaunee democratic government structure known as the Great Law of Peace “was known to some of the Founding Fathers and has been compared—in terms of designated authorities and balances of power—to the US. Constitution.” In fact, A 1988 concurrent resolution in the House of Representatives (331), was published\n\nTo acknowledge the contribution of the Iroquois Confederacy of nations to the development of the United States Constitution and to reaffirm the continuing government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States established in the Constitution.\n\nWhereas the original framers of the Constitution, including, most notably, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, are known to have greatly admired the concepts of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy\n\nWhereas the confederation of the original Thirteen Colonies into one republic was influenced by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy as were many of the democratic principles which were incorporated into the Constitution itself; . . .\n\nThe website of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy provides greater detail of this history.\n\nThe U.S. style of democracy differs from the Haudenosaunee in that the U.S. has a representative democracy (majority rule) whereas the Haudenosaunee traditional form of governance is a participatory democracy in which decision-making occurs through a consensus building effort. Moreover, the U.S. is a patriarchal society in which men often deny women equal rights while the Haudenosaunee Great Law of Peace provides a structure that ensures equal numbers in participation in leadership roles for males and females, ensuring greater sex/gender equity.\n\nTo recap, in contrast to the traditional cooperative and rather egalitarian social order of this land, Western societies are more competitive and hierarchical. The dominant discourse of the Western worldview – as explained by Barbara Alice Mann (Seneca of Ohio), in Iroquoian Women: The Gantowisas, involve metanarratives including those of sexism and conflict. In particular, dominant cultural narratives in the Western tradition explain the world as competitive individuals in conflict with one another within a hierarchical world order known as the Great Chain of Being. Alternative cultural narratives exist that shape a comparatively egalitarian worldview where individuals live together in community and are expected to maintain respectful, cooperative, and reciprocal relationships with all beings and where each individual’s needs are met in a rather power-balanced social order and within a power-balanced world. When Europeans came to the Americas, they brought with them their ideas about social hierarchy (which, incidentally, is not based on principles of equality). This ethos of competitiveness along with notions of hierarchy formed the foundational attitudes that justified, in their imaginations, the dehumanizing enslavement of some people and genocidal actions toward others, creating the system of oppression and inequality we know as racism. So too, did this belief in social hierarchy shape inequality between the sexes/genders, creating the oppressive system of inequality we name sexism.\n\nAfter some time of living in America, women of European heritage came to know and understand other ways of life that would inspire them to advocate for their own equal standing with the men who controlled their lives. Feminist scholar Sally Roesch Wagner explains throughout her book titled Sisters In Spirit: Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Influence on Early American Feminists that the women of European heritage witnessed the social standing and social power held by women of the gynocratic (women centered) nations of the Northeastern Woodlands. Wagner discusses the influence, at that time, of the Haudenosaunee women in particular. The women in these societies (collectively) owned the agricultural land and controlled the community resources, and they held political power, unlike European women, who were, for the most part, without rights, but instead were controlled by the males in their lives. Wagner explains that when women of European heritage (i.e., early feminist leaders such as Elizabeth Stanton, Matilda Gage, and Lucretia Mott) witnessed the freedoms and power that women in Haudenosaunee societies held, they began the Women’s Suffragette Movement in the U.S.\n\nNative Americans have had a major (yet often unacknowledged) influence on the newcomers to their land. However, for much of my life, I did not acknowledge this positive influence. Until recently, I was unaware. Today, and as we approach our national annual Thanksgiving holiday, I am filled with gratitude for the access to land, resources, and food, as well as for the cultural and societal influence that my Native American hosts contribute to my life.\n\nLet us consider, now, our leadership positions, as it pertains not only to caring enough to change the world in regard to social justice issues, but also the power of influence that is constructed in narratives and stories. In regard to the Haudenosaunee and other gynocratic nations of the Northeast Woodlands Peoples, they share various versions of an influential cosmology or origin story. Barbara Alice Mann (and others) speak and write about the Skywoman cosmology of the Peoples of the Northeast Woodlands as a narrative that shapes a rather egalitarian worldview and social order. That is, Skywoman and other gendered beings exist as complimentary forces and cooperated to co-create a beautiful, diverse, and a resilient natural environment in the context of a power-balanced world. The story cycle of this Skywoman tale differs in structure from the typical male dominated individualistic S/Hero’s journey, in which a prince charming, or a night-in-shining-armor, or other exceptional individual comes to the rescue, told in many cosmologies and other tales that originate in cultures with a typical Western worldview. Skywoman, in contrast, teaches about the collective hero, or rather, the power of the people.\n\nOther examples of an indigenous story cycle pattern with a collective hero exist. The traditional Sahaptin legend of The Aiyaiyesh Girl: Origin of the Basket is one such story. My understanding of this story is that a “lazy” girl had no skills, nor access to resources. However, when a group of community members chose to share knowledge and resources, the girl developed her unique talents to be able to offer her special gifts back to the community. This is a story about cooperation, reciprocity, and responsibility for various individuals within a community. Another example of an indigenous story that exemplifies a collective hero is the Haudenosaunee epic of the formation of their Peace Confederacy of Nations – presented on YouTube as the War of the American Indians Documentary on the History of the Iroquois. My understanding of this story is that an environment of social chaos and conflict allowed the evil Tadadaho to gain and maintain power over the people. When the people decided to stop fighting with one another and to cooperate instead, the Tadadaho had to accept a place for himself in the way the people had decided to go if he wished to continue to lead the people. Part of that acceptance included the people “combing the snakes from Tadadaho’s hair, (i.e. the people helped Tadahaho to develop “a good mind”). The responsibilities of that leadership position then included maintaining the Peoples’ peace agreement. These two stories avoid deficit-theorizing and pathologizing individuals, and instead, they look to the community and expanding into the environment (all my relations) for shaping desired social change.\n\nOften, the collective hero in an indigenous story cycle pattern strives to pull a wayward soul back into the folds of community. As explained by Dr. Menoukha Case, an expert in the fields of literature, but also as a co-author of Introduction to Feminist Thought and Action: #WTF and How Did We Get Here? #WhosThatFeminist #WhatsThatFeminism, a scholar in issues of race and gender (inclusive of indigenous worldviews), an alternative story cycle pattern that is prevalent in many Indigenous narratives and stories is based on a collective cultural hero rather than a single individual as the hero. We could think of such stories as a sort of political science – sharing knowledge about power dynamics and how to shape more just societies; and we can think of associated community actions as allied empowerment because they prevent power imbalances by shaping a more power-balanced social order overall. Stories, such as these, portray individuals and communities as having personal and collective agency, ingenuity, resilience, and the ability to thrive. Thus, stories can be a powerful component of social change; and stories that exemplify allied empowerment by way of a collective cultural hero can help us realize that our greatest power comes from cooperating with one another.\n\nSocial change, however, is often thought of as consisting of only two components. According to the Metta Center for Nonviolence, Mahatma Gandhi’s satyagraha movement used these two components to free India from the control of Great Britain. Michael Nagler of the Metta Center coined the terms “obstructive program” and “constructive program” to describe these two methods. On the one hand, obstructive program refers to blocking that which is unjust, such as actions of civil disobedience. On the other hand, constructive program refers to building more just systems and structures to replace those that folks are desiring to dismantle. Both components are necessary for implementing lasting change. Specifically, disruption of injustice is important; however, we need to have just systems and structures in place for people to turn to in order to meet their needs or else they will likely go back to what already exists as they move forward after any social disruption. Much like people turning to systems and structures that already exist after a social upheaval, people will continue to embrace what they currently know, that is, their thought patterns and worldview. Thus, the people will replicate much of what was before the onset of a social revolution unless they incorporate a third component of social change, and one that is likely the most challenging aspect, involving a paradigm shift.\n\nHowever, due to cognitive dissonance, or the uncomfortable feelings people experience when faced with information that contradicts what they currently know, many people often resist paradigm shifts. Moreover, bare facts alone are not especially effective at changing people’s hearts and minds. More effective strategies for overcoming cognitive dissonance include the use of stories. This is because stories allow people to temporarily engage in the lived experience of another – to try out new ways of thinking, feeling, and being – while knowing that they can return to life as they know it, if they so wish. In this way, stories can help people to expand their “experiences,” their worldview, and their cultural schemata (mental models) from which attitudes and actions do often follow.\n\nCultural schemata contain metanarratives, some good and some not so good. We can think of certain Western metanarratives, those including racism, sexism, and other systems of oppression and conflict, as some of the master’s tools, which civil rights activist Audre Lorde wrote about in an essay titled The Master’s Tools will Never Dismantle the Master’s House. Thomas King, award-winning and best-selling author and the first Indigenous person to deliver the prestigious CBC Massey Lectures offers us insight in his lecture series titled in The Truth About Stories: A Native Narrative for how to deal with such harmful metanarratives. His telling of how, in a witches’ conference, one witch, in particular, was responsible for bringing evil into the world. This happened by the telling of an evil story. What was King’s advice to diminish the evil? To privilege other stories!\n\nHowever, tales embodying more desirable cultural metanarratives are not the only sort of stories we should privilege if we desire social change. We can, as already mentioned, make space for often-silenced voices and welcome them into our lives to create a more inclusive common memory. Mark Charles, (Dutch and Navajo heritage) Independent candidate for U.S. president 2020, and co-author of a book about the Doctrine of Discovery titled Unsettling Truths explains the need for this notion of a common memory when he quotes a Dene elder named Georges Erasmus when he states, “Where common memory is lacking, where people do not share in the same past, there can be no real community. Where community is to be formed, common memory must be created.” The authors of Unsettling Truths state that they “aim to recover a common memory and shared understanding of where we have been and where we are going. As other nations have instituted truth and reconciliation commissions, so do the authors call our nation and churches to a truth-telling that will expose past injustices and open the door to conciliation and true community.” I believe that we, the people, do not need to wait for national leaders or churches to take action in these regards. We can choose to make spaces for silenced voices in the places and times that offer us the opportunity.\n\nIn this regard, I think about the oppressions within my own family history – land enclosures (enclosing commonly owned lands so that the English could use it to farm sheep and harvest wool and profits), the displacement of Peoples from their lands and their unique ways of life (language and culture), and the times of hunger and great suffering. In particular, there is the myth of the Irish potato famine in the U.S., which was actually an intentional act of genocide, and is referred to as the Great Hunger in Ireland. This is a time when the British took control of the land and agriculture in order to grow crops, including food crops for export, while at the same time denying the Irish people an adequate means of survival. It is a time when perhaps 10-15% of the people starved and a similar number emigrated to other countries. The trauma involved the displacement of my Peoples from their traditional homelands, the loss of traditional cultures and languages – in other words, the historical trauma of colonization, exploitation, genocide, cultural genocide, and migrations as well as the generational cycles of violence associated with such traumas when left unhealed. Generational trauma and associated cycles of violence due to unhealed trauma is prevalent in communities that have experienced traumagenic (trauma inducing) occurrences. These patterns of suffering are also known as historical trauma and they exist in my family as well as with other families and communities who have experienced great suffering.\n\nThe Roman Empire is perhaps responsible for the conquest of most of the European tribes – and Europeans experienced trauma due to conflict as well as having lost their cultural roots as they were assimilated into the Roman domination system. The trauma is deep for those of us whose cultural history includes centuries of ongoing conflict and warfare, displacement from homelands and protective communities, depravations due to conflict, weather pattern changes, plagues, forced labor, and so-called witch-hunts with associated drownings and burnings, and this cultural trauma has yet to be healed for many of us. This is evident in the cycles of violence that are connected to unhealed trauma – associated addictions, as well. Addictions are connected to substances as well as brain-chemical inducing behaviors, for sure, but also addictions are connected to accumulation beyond need – accumulation of goods, accumulation of wealth, and accumulation of power. To my way of thinking, white supremacy culture (i.e., racism) is the outcome of cultural genocide perpetrated by the domination systems of both the Roman Empire and certain religious organizations that supported imperialistic conquest and settler colonialism.\n\nIn short, know that the U.S. was founded on the violence and traumas related to colonial settler-ism, cruel exploitation of land and Peoples, land and resource theft, slavery, genocide, displacement of Peoples, forced assimilation and cultural genocide. We, the inhabitants within the boundaries of the U.S., are people suffering from a multitude of traumatic pasts including personal/familial/ethnic histories of movement – often traumatic displacement. Many of us are people who (generally speaking) have not yet put forth adequate effort in healing from the traumas of our past. Instead, we often deny or ignore this troubling history while repeating cycles of violence such that we are revisited with circumstances that further induce suffering and trauma – such as conditions that encourage ongoing social discord.\n\nI know of a practical framework for healing from our violent past. It is named Transforming Historical Harms, and it “represents an evolution of the Strategies for Trauma Awareness and Resilience (STAR) program (located at in the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding’s Practice and Training Institute) with application of trauma healing theory to a specific set of circumstances, namely, multigenerational harm at the personal and communal levels. . . The STAR program was developed in response to the events of September 11, 2001, by the faculty and staff of Eastern Mennonite University’s Center for Justice and Peacebuilding.” The publication, Transforming Historical Harms is presented by a racial justice organization titled Coming to the Table. They state that the “Transforming Historical Harms (THH) manual articulates a Framework for addressing the historical harms . . . present in societies around the world. The framework looks at historical injustices and their present manifestations through the lens of trauma and identifies the mechanisms for the transmission of historical trauma: legacies and aftermaths. These are the beliefs and structures responsible for transmitting trauma responses and traumagenic circumstances between generations. The framework then offers a comprehensive approach to transforming historical harms through Facing History; Making Connections; Healing Wounds; and Taking Action.” The THH approach to healing recognizes that trauma can occur for individuals and communities who experience trauma inducing circumstances whether as victims, as perpetrators, or as witnesses and this trauma can and does get passed to future generations if left unhealed. The THH framework includes the practices of facing history, making connections, healing wounds, and taking action, the implementation of which gives me hope for a better tomorrow.\n\nIn the U.S., generally speaking, however, there is a sort of national fog, as it pertains facing history, in regard to Indigenous Peoples. In general, people in the dominant culture do not have even a basic understanding of Indigenous issues. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at present, there are 574 federally recognized tribes(bands, nations, villages, etc.), with many others not yet federally recognized. A nation is a People who are united by place, culture, language, history, and common descent. Know that the United States is a nation of nations.\n\nNative American issues include but are not limited to:\n\nNation-to-Nation treaty agreements in regard to the Peoples, the land, water, and other resources.These are the questions I strive to answer: Do I know who are the original caretakers of the land on which I live? Do I know what treaties pertain to the lands on which I live as well as the details of my commitments, obligations, and responsibilities to the land the Peoples? Native Land Digital is a good beginning point for learning about place and the original Peoples who are the original stewards of a place.\n\nMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Children (MMIWC). TheNational Crime Information Center reports that in the year 2016 there were “5,712 missing American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls, though the US Department of Justice’s federal missing person database logged 116 cases.” There is inadequate awareness and action in the dominant culture in regard to MMIWC.\n\nNative Lives Matter. According to a 2017 CNN report titled The Forgotten Minority in Police Shootings, statistics indicate that Native Americans are killed in law enforcement actions at a higher rate than any other race or ethnicity, according to CDC data from 1999 to 2015. In many communities, Black Lives Matter and Native Lives Matter organizations are uniting.\n\nNative American boarding school assimilation efforts – and associated Missing Children. Brigadier General, Richard Henry Pratt, was the founder of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School at Carlisle, Pennsylvania and the architect of the Bureau of Indian Affair’s boarding school system, whose educational strategy (assimilationist at best and lethal at its worst) was to “Kill the Indian . . . and save the man,” the phrase Pratt used to describe his mission. The National Native American Boarding School Healing Commission summarizes, “The truth about the US Indian boarding school policy has largely been written out of the history books. There were more than 350 government-funded, and often church-run, Indian Boarding schools across the US in the 19th and 20th centuries. Indian children were forcibly abducted by government agents, sent to schools hundreds of miles away, and beaten, starved, or otherwise abused when they spoke their native languages.” In the U.S., the Indian boarding-school era lasted from 1860 to 1978. In Canada, there was a class action settlement in 2007 bringing about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that provided those directly or indirectly affected by the Indian Residential School system with the opportunity to share their stories and experience. Recently, at Kamloops Indian Residential School in B.C. Canada, the remains of 215 children were uncovered in unmarked graves. The issue of child abuse and death at Native American boarding school locations exists in the U.S. as well. Deb Haaland, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo, one of the federally recognized tribes, grandparents were stolen. On June 22, 2021, Haaland announced the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, “a comprehensive review of the troubled legacy of federal boarding school policies” for the purpose of investigating Native American boarding schools and identifying burial sites in the U.S. Those who made it through Native American Boarding schools are referred to as survivors rather than graduates.\n\nLanguage and cultural revitalization efforts. This issue is important to us all. Linguists such as David Crystal (Language Death) and David K. Harrison (When Languages Die: The Extinction of the World’s Languages and the Erosion of Human Knowledge) state that the number of the world’s languages is not easy to determine, but they estimate that there is currently approximately six thousand languages spoken on Earth. The world’s languages are repositories of both history and human knowledge, each language also offering insights into human cognition and expressing a unique worldview. Languages also contain cultural information about how to live in a particular place on Earth, with particular land features, particular plants and animals, and particular weather and climate patterns. Diversity of languages, they say, increase human beings’ collective resilience to survive. However, to language speakers, such as David Treuer, as explained in Language and Meaning, and Ojibwe Story, published on the American Public Media program titled On Being with Krista Tippett, languages also express people’s identity as part of a unique culture. To Native Americans and other colonized peoples, Truer explains, language loss, for many, represents an identity connected to oppression imposed from the dominant and hegemonic culture, whereas language revitalization represents a self-defined positive identity coming from within. Language loss, in this way, can be a personal health issue, being a psychological and emotional issue, as well. Much of Native American language loss is due to the Native American Boarding School assimilation agenda, but other forces such as globalization, technology, and certain power-dynamics are at play, too. Linguists estimate that we are on target to lose ninety percent of the world’s languages by the end of the 21st century if we do not adequately address the issue.\n\nRepresentation. Issues with representation are many, but one important aspect is in regard to stereotypes. The United Nations We are Indigenous Academic Impact statement titled Breaking Media Stereotypes with Indigenous Storytelling, states that “The United Nations Declaration on The Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms that “Indigenous peoples have the right to establish their own media in their own languages and to have access to all forms of non-indigenous media without discrimination. With the goal to dismantle media-based prejudice against Indigenous groups, Indigenous media professionals are working to ensure Indigenous cultural diversity is properly represented in the media and tells Indigenous stories in a way that is factual, dignified and ethical.” Indigenous Peoples often turn to the United Nations in order to have their human rights acknowledged.\n\nDue to assimilationist agendas perpetrated by the school system and others, we have a historical national public policy in the U.S. of silence in regard to the horrors of the Native American Boarding School forced assimilation strategy and other oppressive actions. I have come to realize that these issues are not simply Indigenous issues because they are interconnected with the actions of the people in the dominant culture. That is, we have a shared history as well as a shared present-day reality. Often unacknowledged, we also have shared responsibilities in treaty commitments and obligations as well as shared responsibility in healing historical harms.\n\nOngoing social issues originating from histories of imperialistic conquest and domination name some of the reasons I keep my attention turned to gaining a deepening understanding of history. Often uncovering connections of shared systemic oppression, I feel increasingly responsible to renew commitments for healing and for justice for self and others. This, to me, is the meaning of allyship: people standing together and working together in allied relationships to create oppressive free spaces in which we can collectively survive and thrive.\n\nBeing an ally to Indigenous communities can be different from what it means to be an ally to people in the Black community or other People of Color. The Two Row Wampum Renewal Campaign along with the Syracuse Cultural Workers publish a poster and postcards written by Dr. Jack Manno, Professor of Environmental Sciences at SUNY ESF (retired), with artwork by Josephine M. Cook, is titled How to be an Ally to Indigenous Peoples and it includes a list of attitudes and actions as ally work:\n\nIndigenous concerns and priorities will be different wherever we may travel. I recommend to everyone to search out how to be an ally to Indigenous Peoples in the region where they live. Another approach to Indigenous Allyship is offered by the National Congress of American Indians in Allies for Indian Country. I have come to understand, through practice, that engaging in allyship work as described reduces the discomfort I feel when acknowledging the place where I live and the people who have historically stewarded these lands. The relationships we have cultivated have helped me to acknowledge an unsettling history. I have also come to realize that it is respectful to know the customs of one’s host and to follow the customs of one’s host when and where appropriate.\n\nReturning to the topic of fall holidays, Mainstream U.S. American society, in general, makes light of historical trauma by perpetuating an inaccurate telling of history, a Thanksgiving myth. The myths is explained as Claire Bugos of the Smithsonian Magazine interviews historian David Silverman, in regard to his book “This Land is Their Land: The Wampanoag Indians, Plymouth Colony, and the Troubled History of Thanksgiving.” Silverman explains the myth and then shines light on often-silenced truths. One such truth is about colonial and imperial rhetoric, specifically, a rhetoric about land and people. Silverman explains, concerning King Philip’s War (the Great Narragansett War), that “Part of what King Philip’s War was about is Wampanoag people saying, ‘Enough, you’re not going to turn us into a landless, subjugated people.’” So Wampanoag concern was one of displacement. Thus, the colonial and imperial rhetoric revolves around the people who make other people landless and thus, subordinate to landowning masters. When I read this interview, I compared and contrasted the Wampanoag experience to my own cultural and ethnic history. I have come to realize that my people, instead of healing from their trauma of displacement, turned and re-enacted their trauma experiences on the Native Peoples of the Americas. This telling of history can help all of us to understand the ways in which multitudes of Peoples have been displaced and traumatized by colonial and imperial conquest. It can help us to better see and understand our similar experiences and shared history as well as what is unique to each individual and community.\n\nThis Thanksgiving Day I will follow a traditional Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving custom that was shared with me. An important aspect of traditional Haudenosaunee culture is the ever-present attitude of thanksgiving. This constant attitude of gratitude was cultivated by a Haudenosaunee oral tradition, the Ohénton Kariwatékwen, which translates to the language of England as “the words that come before all else” and is sometimes referred to as the Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address. This thanksgiving to the natural world, as it is sometimes referred, is spoken at all important gatherings, and, according to Barbara Alice Mann, it sets the stage for community consensus building about that which is truly important. Thus, the thanksgiving address begins, as told by John Stokes and Kanawahienton (David Benedict, Turtle Clan/Mohawk), “Today we have gathered and we see that the cycles of life continue. We have been given the duty to live in balance and harmony with all living things. So now, we bring our minds together as one as we give greetings and thanks to each other as People. Now our minds are one.” The words [of thanksgiving] that come before all else continues, in which the speaker offers thanks to the Creator for all of the People’s relations. A pattern of thanksgiving may follow with thanks to the Earth Mother who continually provides for her children, the life-giving Waters, and other beings who continue to follow their original instructions to provide to the whole: The Fish, the Plants, the Food Plants, the Medicinal Herbs, the Animals, the Trees, the Birds, the Four Winds, the Thunder Beings, the Sun, Grandmother Moon, the Stars, the Enlightened Teachers, and the Creator, as is presented in the Tree of Peace Society’s official publication of the Thanksgiving Address in the English language. Freida Jacques, Onondaga Clan Mother discusses the origin and use of the Thanksgiving Address in a short (linked) video produced by the New York State Department of Education in collaboration with the New York State Museum. As personally communicated by Mohawk Elder Sakokwenionkwas (Tom Porter), after each offering of gratitude, all present at the gathering are invited to acknowledge agreement to the statement “Now our minds are one.” Tom Porter has also reminded me that we were all indigenous once – that is, each of us originate from people who were/are connected to land, place, and our languages and cultures were/are shaped by the environments in which we live(d). Remember, the Haudenosaunee Peoples, whose worldview is shaped by the Skywoman origin story, have the oldest living democracy in the lands we now call the Americas and their form of governance is a participatory democracy in which the people govern themselves within the context of a consensus-building process. When I hear the words that come before all else Thanksgiving Address, I hear consensus building efforts in regard to caring for one another as human beings by caring for Mother Earth as well as caring for All our Relations and I am filled with compassion and hope for the future. The fall holidays, although now symbolizing for me an expanded historical and cultural understanding, still fill me with feelings of gratitude for good friends, good things, and hope for still more good to come. It remains my favorite time of year.\n\n————-\n\nNancy Babbitt and Just Desserts Blog, 2021.

I do not claim to be ‘objective’ or without bias in my research and analysis, but rather, I do have a specific aim in mind, based on my own personal history. My investigations into the meanings of power reside within the context of studies in peace and social justice. In particular, I began my venture into higher education as an older adult with the intent to get a degree in what I initially thought of as Peace Studies. I distinctly remember wanting to discover ‘the peace stories’ because to me, storytelling is the ideal medium with which to share and bridge differences. However, I quickly realized that to most folks (that is, the ones who were familiar with the discipline – because most people are not) those in academia generally conceive of Peace Studies as Peace and Conflict studies in the context of discord between nations. I promptly changed my direction to shape a degree in Social Justice because I had no intention to study conflict, and especially not disputes at an international level. For this reason, I spent a few psychologically and emotionally challenging years learning all about many forms of social injustice. My education has been focused, to a large extent, on analyzing inequality and injustice in order to gain a deeper understanding, but I had thus far, gained little knowledge concerning what I wanted to know most, methods of social change.\n\nI had concluded that I would not find social justice or peace on the paths that I had been walking, and for this reason, I shifted my intention. I decided that it was time for me to move my attention beyond deficit theorizing and toward ‘other ways of knowing’ in order to gain knowledge concerning paths to wellness, wholeness, justice, and peace. Therefore, although there are established ways in which scholars currently theorize about power (e.g. investigations into power relations, power dynamics, power dimensions, etc.), this particular inquiry reaches beyond standard academic literature review practices and into the realm of Native American storytelling as a source of literature on the topic of power. In particular, I focused on a few stories that exist within the Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, the designers of The Great Law of Peace. This is because I believe that paths to empowerment, social justice, and peace may be found within Haudenosaunee oral Keepings. That is to say, I think that I have found the ‘peace stories’ for which I initially set myself to ‘discover’.\n\nNative American Survivance: Walking a Path of Empowerment\n\nTheories of power developed around the mid-nineteenth century followed a pattern set in place by Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution (1859) that ranked different social organizations on a hierarchy (i.e. savagery to barbarism to civilization) in a way that also ranks the knowledge keeping systems and the theories on power developed within them. Thus, Sir Henry Maine’s Ancient Law (1861) and Lewis Morgan Henry’s Ancient Society (1877) each portray legitimate power as that which has ‘evolved’ from ‘primitive’ family and group-authorized positions of social status to what they considered to be a more ‘civilized’ legitimate exercise of power as determined by contract, law, and the state. Theories, such as these, set into motion an unfortunate ranking and privileging trend that continues to this day. Thus, privileged knowledge keeping systems and the theories that emanate from them continue privileging privilege while they simultaneously silence or marginalize alternate theories that can offer us solutions to the ongoing problem of increasing social inequality and resultant social conflicts.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation was to locate and examine historically silenced, marginalized and alternate theories of empowerment that are often overlooked in the Western academy. As part of this research I examined the literature of indigenous people, particularly focusing on Native American storytelling. Primary source materials included oral traditions as well as texts and academic journal articles authored by members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy of Nations, the designers of the Great Law of Peace. My research goal was to investigate ways of understanding the notion of power and empowerment that are distinct from those typically embraced by those who hold, as I do, a Western worldview. My aim is to articulate my unfolding understanding of paths to wellness, wholeness, justice, empowerment, and peace as expressed in oral Keepings as the first step in putting my new knowledge into practice.\n\nI based this research topic on my desire to better understand the cultural underpinnings or the ontology, epistemology, and axiology related to the meaning of power as expressed in the oral Keepings and which I believe might shape a rather cooperative and egalitarian worldview and peaceful way of life. My approach is that of a critical analysis of Native American oral Keepings combined with a reflective essay. I chose this method because my analysis and writing is a great deal more about my own interpretations of Native American oral traditions, along with my own transforming thought processes concerning power, powerlessness, and empowerment, than it is of anyone else’s views. In this way, I expect that my research will support the legitimacy of knowledge keeping systems and theories that have historically been marginalized and silenced as I incorporate them into my own expanding and transforming worldview.\n\nPowerlessness is a common social problem. According to Young (1988), powerlessness is relational: it is the manifestation of structural and systemic oppression, evidenced by inhibitions that constrain individual and/or group autonomy, mobility, respect, expression, and development of capacity. Powerlessness is a condition that is connected to individuals and groups of people who, for various reasons, lack the will and/or the resources necessary to improve their impoverished situations.\n\nWhen addressing the problems of powerlessness, people often seek to uncover disempowering causes as the first step toward alleviating peoples’ suffering. Sometimes, we think of powerlessness and empowerment in terms of internal processes, such as may be the case when considering addictions, the 12-step program’s self-surrender as a form of self-empowerment, as one such example (Medina, 2014). Other times, we may think about external causes and solutions, such as may be the case with ‘at risk’ youth (Reininger, et al. 2012). Furthermore, powerlessness may be the result of patterns previously established which have become systemic in nature, such as the ongoing problems of inequality related to the ‘-isms’ (e.g. racism, sexism, classism) (Guishard, 2009). Accordingly, we perceive that people increase their power, or become empowered, by one or a combination of internal, external, or systemic processes or changes.\n\nThis type of approach to issues of injustice often leads to theorizing about who is to blame and who is responsible to right the wrongs. However, I believe that deficit theorizing easily leads to a quagmire of inaction. This is because economic liabilities related to solutions lead to ‘passing the buck’ and shifting the blame. Consider the question that is posed by John McNutt (2011), “Is social work advocacy worth the cost?” Evidently, then, the ongoing problem of powerlessness may be rooted in a problem of perception. Indigenous Research Methods specialist, Bagele Chilisa, suggests that social justice can be achieved by moving away from a deficit-based orientation and moving instead, toward reinforcing practices that are life sustaining (2012, pp. 17-18).”\n\nConsider, then, how we use language, expressed as theories, in order to explain social phenomena. Often, theorists discuss the term ‘power’ in the context of social relationships where they recognize power as a social dynamic that encompasses an ability to influence people’s decision-making and actions. In Western cultures, the “prevailing perception of power in human relationships is adversarial, where some people use power over others in ways that serve the selected interests of those in power (Chinn & Falk-Rafael, 2015.).” Specifically, Western theories of power, as discussed above, name the structure of legitimate power as that determined by contract, law, and the state. This premise is not only theoretical, but also was a form of “political colonialism” (Chilisa, 2012, p. 9.) in that the classification system creates a hierarchy which simultaneously de-legitimizes non-Western ways of knowing and exercising power by relegating them to a position of ‘primitive’ or ‘less-than’.\n\nThink, also, how people use cosmologies in order to explain phenomena. A very simple anthropological definition of cosmology is “a set of beliefs that defines the universe or the cosmos (Spradley & McCurdy, 2011, p. 392.).” Cosmologies are stories that are passed on from one generation to the next as a sort of ritual, not unlike theatre or other performances, and they offer explanations for how the universe came to be. Now think how, according to what we commonly refer to as the Whorf hypothesis, language, or a particular way of using words, shapes one’s worldview and thus one’s perceptions concerning reality. That is to say, there is evidence that “people’s language predisposes them to focus on some things rather than others (Spradley & McCurdy, 2012, p. 49.).” Our cosmologies, then, shape our thoughts. Taking all of this into consideration, we can therefore conclude that we can understand cosmologies as community based performances that simultaneously shape and express particular worldviews while passing theories on the origin of the universe from one generation to the next. Cosmologies are a source of legitimate knowledge in that they inform us of the foundations of a particular society’s worldview – the ways in which they understand reality.\n\nNative American writers have helped me to understand how Western cosmologies shape Western thought and theory. In the Western worldview, Christianity dominates as an origin story. So too, does Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. Barbara Alice Mann (Seneca of Ohio) refers to the Western “metanarratives” of monotheism, sexism, and conflict (2011, pp. 61-62). Thus, Christianity’s Genesis story poses a single male creator along with hierarchical power structures in which God ordained man to name (label and classify) the world, subdue the earth and its creatures, and rule over women. The God versus Satan, Adam and Eve narrative imposes on people a good versus evil dichotomy along with the notion of ‘opposite’ sex/genders and sets the stage for thinking about separateness and social exclusion which lead to conflict. Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, likewise, poses what scholar of Native American Women’s Studies (2008), Stephanie A. Sellers (Shawnee), names a “hierarchy of existence” (pp. 19-21.) in which competition is an inevitable condition of being. In this origin story, at the bottom and of least importance are rocks and minerals, next in worth are the plants, and then the animals reside at the top and this is where man sits at the very apex (Sellers, 2008, p. 21.). These stories, together, become the dominant discourse (or overriding philosophy) of the Western worldview, and they introduce a hierarchy that serves to exclude and oppress based on in-group/out-group categories.\n\nUsing the theoretical foundation embedded in these cosmologies, other philosophers proposed subsequent theories built on social hierarchy. Johann Friedrich Blumenbach’s “race-based classifications of man” (RACE – History Early, n.d.) and Herbert Spencer’s eugenics movement-inspiring theory on Social Darwinism (RACE – History Eugenics, n.d.) are such examples. Thus, Western cosmologies and the theories that emanate from them normalize notions concerning ‘survival of the fittest’, separateness, individualism, hierarchy, competition, and practices such as resource and human exploitation along with social exclusions, which are devised in order to move one up the hierarchy, making inequality seem ‘natural’ in Western thought and theory.\n\nHowever, there exist cosmologies that shape very different ways of thinking about relationships. For example, many Native Americans of the Northeast Woodlands of North America embrace an alternate discourse based on different versions of the Skywoman cosmology. Barbara Alice Mann (Seneca of Ohio) explains that in the tradition of her ancestors, for example, Skywoman is one of multiple creators of the universe (Mann, 2006, p. 17.). In this understanding of creation, there is a gendered world where gender exists as complementary ‘twin’ forces that act as balanced pairs interacting with one another in order to maintain a cosmic balance (Mann, 2011, p. 90.). This story shapes an egalitarian worldview where individuals, males and females living together in community, are expected to maintain cooperative and reciprocal relationships with all beings, where each individuals’ needs are met in a power-balanced social order and a power-balanced world (Mann, 2011, p. 90.). The paradigm shaped by this particular Skywoman cosmology is one in which the notion of individuals only exist as members of a larger complex community, and they are expected to act within cooperative and reciprocal relationships that strive to maintain balance. The Skywoman paradigm shapes the traditional Haudenosaunee worldview.\n\nThe Haudenosaunee are a confederacy of gynocratic nations, indigenous to the Eastern Woodlands of North America. According to Mann (1997), oral Keepings indicate that the Nations of the confederacy, although at one time were engaged in constant conflict amongst themselves, now embrace The Great Law of Peace, the oral constitution of the first American democracy, which has endured now for over a thousand years. Wallace (1994) recorded that the Haudenosaunee Nations base their governmental structure on the oral teachings of a man named Deganawidah, and whom they refer to as the Peacemaker. According to various oral traditions, the Peacemaker came from the north and embarked upon and succeeded in his quest to unite five warring nations under the Great Tree of Peace as the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (Chief Oren Lyons, n.d., Mann, 2006, pp. 47-49, Porter, 2008, pp. 289-312.). The Haudenosaunee Confederacy consists today of the original five nations, commonly referred to as the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas, as well as the Tuscarora Nation, who later relocated to Haudenosaunee territory and joined the union as a response to European colonization and encroachment on their territory and the threatening of Tuscarora lives (Mann, 2011, p. 41.). According to Oren Lyons, Chief of the Onondaga Nation Council of Chiefs of the Six Nations, and Kay Olan (Mohawk) Traditional Storyteller, the Haudenosaunee still invite others to join their peacemaking efforts (Chief Oren Lyons, n.d.; ESC CDL Native American Awareness Day, n.d.).\n\nAn important aspect of traditional Haudenosaunee culture is the ever-present attitude of thanksgiving. This constant attitude of gratitude was cultivated by a Haudenosaunee oral tradition that translates as ‘Words before All Else’ and is sometimes referred to as the ‘Thanksgiving Address’ (Swamp et al., 1993). This thanksgiving to the natural world, as it is sometimes referred, is spoken at all important gatherings, and it sets the stage for community consensus building (Mann, 2011, p. 166.). Mohawk Spiritual Elder, Tom Porter explains that the Haudenosaunee social order was based on a matrilineal clan system, which defined family as well as lineage (Porter, 2008, p. 111-113). This notion of family extended beyond the limits of western notions of ‘traditional’ and ‘nuclear’ families to include all members of a person’s clan including those in other Nations (Porter, 1993, pp. 9-10). Family (relatedness) also included beings in what Westerners tend to think of as ‘the natural world’ (e.g. Sister Corn, Mother Earth, Older Brother Sun). Tom Porter explains that all beings are related as children of ‘Our Mother, the Earth’ (Porter, 1993, p. 11.). The clan system was the center of a sharing economy in which each individual in the community enjoyed, because of the reciprocal sharing, a great abundance where everything was “double, reinforced” so that there was more of everything (Porter, 2008, pp. 112-113.). However, European colonization of the Americas disrupted this social order where today various aspects of traditional Haudenosaunee culture remain, however now often in altered forms (Porter, 2008, p 113.). Nonetheless, the oral Keepings of the Haudenosaunee Nations are knowledge-keeping systems that contain information about not only the Haudenosaunee worldviews but also Haudenosaunee theories concerning power and paths to peace and social justice (Mann, 2011, p. 29-32.).\n\nHowever, the Western academy often ignores, marginalizes, or otherwise suppresses non-Western knowledge-keeping systems and ways of knowing. Indigenous research expert, Bagele Chilisa describes it this way, “local knowledge, languages, cultures, and value systems [that] cannot be converted into capital value in the global market . . . are thus excluded from the knowledge and information that circulate globally to make profits (2012, p. 75.).” Nevertheless, Native American scholars have begun to position their traditional form of literature, storytelling, as accepted and valid forms of knowledge in the Western academy. One example of such is the journal article Sky Woman Lives On: Contemporary Examples of Mothering the Nation by Lina Sunseri (2008). Sunseri (Oneida) describes the ‘Mothering the Nation’ responsibilities of Oneida/Haudenosaunee women as set forth in the Skywoman cosmology according to her family’s tradition. According to Sunseri (2008), Oneida/Haudenosaunee women are political leaders who stand against the dominant patriarchal notions of submissive women and motherhood and create a space free from the constraints of oppression to ensure not only the healthy growth of their own children, but also the wellbeing of their entire communities and nations. To the Western mind, legitimate knowledge is most often perceived to be that which an objective scientific methodology shows to be true, however other systems of knowledge, such as the teachings in Native American cosmologies and oral Keepings, as Sunseri demonstrates, are gaining credibility.\n\nAs already stated, those who hold a Western worldview perceive a world in which there is a hierarchy of existence. In the Western ontology, or meaning of existence, the world is understood in an objective way. That means that the world consists of different objects and beings and disconnected individuals. There is a focus on the “I/You relationship with its emphasis on the individual (Chilisa, 2012, pp. 20-21.)” Individuals are perceived to be in competition with one another for limited resources. Western epistemology states that knowledge and truth are determined in an objective manner by use of the scientific method. Dominant Western paradigms hold that “ knowledge is an individual entity: the researcher is an individual in search of knowledge, knowledge is something that is gained and therefore may be owned by an individual (Wilson, 2008, as cited by Chilisa, 2012, p. 21.).” The axiology or values in this paradigm can be seen by people’s actions – which, to a great extent, are expressed as the acquisition of things for the individual (Sellers, 2008, p. 26). Power, understood in this way, is essentially personal power (Sellers, 2008, p. 26.). In the Western worldview, power means to get more and get ahead, and move up the hierarchy, but in order to do so, people must resist thinking about who gets left behind in their dealings and exchanges.\n\nHowever, Haudenosaunee understandings of reality and truth differ a great deal from Western ideas. As already discussed, a traditional Haudenosaunee worldview is one that perceives a relational ontology or reality. Chilisa (2012) explains that among indigenous people, “people are beings with many relations and many connections. They have connections with the living and the nonliving, with land, with the earth, with animals, and with other beings. There is an emphasis on an I/We relationship (Chilisa, 2012, pp. 20-21).” These connections and the relatedness are evident in the cooperative effort of many related beings in the creation of the universe, as told in the version of the Skywoman cosmology that Mann and Porter describe (Mann, 2006, pp. 15-26; Mann, 2011, 1-3; Porter, 2008, pp. 40-90.). Epistemology or truth, in this way, is “lies within the human experience” and within the context of the people’s stories (Chilisa, 2012, p. 33.). That is, there is no dispute concerning whether or not the story could be proven true in an objective manner, but rather “knowledge is true if it can be turned into practice that empowers and transforms the lives of the people. . . . True knowledge in this context lies in the collective meaning making by the people that can inform individual and group action that improves the lives of the people (Chilisa, 2012, p. 36.).” Thus, the traditional Haudenosaunee relational Skywoman worldview that Mann and Porter describe shape notions of equality and justice that affords wellbeing to all members of the community. Traditional Haudenosaunee Axiology or values can be seen in people’s actions, such as the building and maintenance of power-balanced, cooperative, and reciprocal relationships in which sharing occurs.\n\nMann describes the Seneca of Ohio women’s Keepings of the Haudenosaunee Second Epoch of Time, which illustrates their version of the cooperative method in which the original Five Nations worked together in order to shape the power-balanced and reciprocal relationships of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. “The Second Epoch in global peace” concerns the coming of the Peacemaker and the Great Law of Peace, which led to the formation of the Haudenosaunee Peace Confederacy (Mann, 2008, p. 130.). This oral tradition, in its many versions, describes what some of the Haudenosaunee call “the dark times,” a period of constant turmoil, conflict, wars, and death (Porter, 2008, p. 274). According to Mann (2006), when the Peacemaker came, he used “The Wampum of Condolence,” along with Ayonwanthaand Jigonsaseh (Peace Queen) as an attempt to join together members of the warring nations into a peace agreement (pp. 56-57.). Mann described the peacemaking method as the “Corn Way” or the “Corn Cause of Peace” (Mann, 2008, p. 130.), which emphasized equality, sharing, and corn cropping for subsistence (Mann, 2006, p. 45.).” However, according to Mann, there was one powerful chief, Adodaroh, who she explained, was a shaman and he used evil powers to control the people (Mann, 2006, pp. 58-60). He stood in the way of unity because he would not agree to the terms of the peace agreement or the Great Law (Mann, 2008, p. 130.). Adodaroh’s evil powers eventually dissipated when all the other people joined in the peace action regardless of his threats. They used Jigonsaseh’s plan, “which featured a carrot as well as a medicine stick. The carrot was to be an offer to Adodaroh that he assume the position of first chairman of the men’s Grand Council of the League. The stick was to show Adodaroh just how far outside of consensus he really stood in opposing a peace that everyone else supported (Mann, 2008, p. 131.).” Thus, the people, in order to get Adodaroh to agree to peace, requested him to be their leader in maintaining the peace (Mann, 2006, p. 59-60.). This is the point in the story where Jigonsaseh combed the snakes from Adodaroh’s hair, symbolizing straightening out his tangled thoughts or his “moral and ethical derangement (Mann, 2008, p. 132.).” The power that Adoharoh previously held was considered ‘bad medicine’ (coercion and controlling others), whereas Jigonsaseh’s method was considered ‘good medicine’ in that it equalized power between the people and Adodaroh.\n\nAccording to Mann’s account then, central to the peace agreement was the Corn Way in which each nation agreed to produce extra and share resources during times of need and resolve any disagreements they had with one another using words and not war. The Keepings concerning the formation of the Peace Confederacy indicate that an environment of chaos and conflict allows power (control, coercion) to form, but when people join in unity and cooperate (eliminating chaos), balance is then achieved. It is interesting to realize that not even the evil Adodaroh was excluded from the newly formed peaceful community. Instead, the community restored him to health and wellness and placed him in the center to maintain the peace. I wonder if part of the teaching in this story is that, no one person was responsible and instead an entire community is equally responsible for creating and eliminating power imbalances. These Keepings of the Peacemaker and Adodaroh can be understood as lessons in political science, showing that when people agree to cooperate and create balance in relationships they are on the path to wellness, wholeness, justice, empowerment, and peace. Specifically, a constant striving to maintain balance in the cosmos eliminates concentrations of power, or inequality, and therefore is empowering to all.\n\nAnother example of perceptions of power as a negative force is contained in another discussion on traditional oral Keepings as a legitimate form of literature. Patricia Monture, in Women’s Words: Power, Identity, and Indigenous Sovereignty (2008), discusses the power that may be present in the action of labeling and classifying:\n\nIn educational institutions, in Canada and elsewhere, this exclusion of oratory as a tradition of value, has a particular consequence compounded by the way in which scholars of literature cling to their own cultural traditions. Those traditions that exclude oral literature are equally grounded in culture, despite the fact that the academy fails to acknowledge this fact. . . . Writing, then, for many Indigenous authors is often the act of naming both power and exclusion, as one rarely exists without the other (Monture, 2008).\n\nMonture points out that exclusions and power are often connected. Creating a system of labeling and classifying and the power to name can be political. She states that including Native oral Keepings as legitimate forms of knowledge as part of the dominant discourse would require many to experience an uncomfortable shift in perspective. Therefore, in order to avoid any discomfort, deficit-theorizing about ‘legitimacy’ often serve as exclusionary tactics for the purpose of coercion and control.\n\nHowever, Monture embraces her responsibilities to ‘Mother her Nation’, as does Sunsuri and Mann. They each practice Native American ‘survivance’ in standing against domination by creating an oppression-free space for the expression of their unique cultural heritage that teaches how to achieve healthy and balanced relationships and more just and peaceful societies. Native American survivance, then, is the expression of empowerment in action. In the examples above, this empowerment did not involve moving up a hierarchy, but rather dismantling the hierarchy by creating balance where power imbalances exist.\n\nIn conclusion, the Western worldview is based on origin stories that reinforce notions concerning ‘survival of the fittest’, competition, individualism, and hierarchy, which make social inequality seem ‘natural’ in Western thought and theory. Power is often perceived in the context of adversarial human relationships and one’s ability to influence another’s attitude and actions. Coercion and control can lead to an environment of conflict and chaos, which allows even greater concentrations of power to form. Personal power is often expressed as one’s ability to get more and get ahead. Theories on empowerment often focus on moving individuals to higher levels on the hierarchy. However, the hierarchy, by its sheer nature, creates inequality and positions of less-power. That is to say, the hierarchy, itself, creates situations where some groups and individuals lack what is necessary to improve their situations. Thus, powerlessness is a common and on-going social problem. Empowerment is often addressed through a process of deficit theorizing that, because of economic liabilities involved in social work, frequently leads to inaction.\n\nHowever, non-Western theories on power and empowerment can offer us solutions to the ongoing and interconnected problems of social inequality and social discord. Specifically, the oral Keepings of Native Americans are a rich source of ‘alternate’ social theories. The Skywoman origin stories discussed here reinforce notions of interconnectedness where individuals exist only in the context of a larger complex community. There is an expectation of responsibility toward one another, where people, in community, strive to maintain balance in cooperative and reciprocal relationships. These stories also shape perceptions of power imbalances as negative forces whereas perceptions of balance are viewed as positive and empowering. In this way, how the people in the stories discussed perceive power and the ways in which they respond to power are in themselves solutions to social inequality and powerlessness.\n\nReferences:\n\n“Chief Oren Lyons – The Roots of American Democracy | Bioneers.” (n.d.).

Part of my difficulty in expressing an analysis is in knowing that both race and gender are social constructs where boundary lines are often ambiguous. That is to say, the classifications of race, gender, and even social class, are shared symbols across cultures, but these symbols are not necessarily weighted by the same values and they do not necessarily represent the same meanings across cultures. In terms of mythological studies, those different meanings can be thought of as distinct cultural schemata or different discourses. For these reasons, socially constructed categories such as race and gender are relevant in people’s lives, but because of cultural distinctions the values and meanings associated with these categories may differ, making writing about cultural others within the context of socially constructed categories difficult.\n\nSita Sings the Blues is an animated picture that combines various cultural productions in order to portray the breakup of Paley’s own love relationship. Included in this mix are portions of the Hindu epic, The Ramayana of Valmiki, jazz-blues style musical tracks produced in the U.S. during the 1920s, and a Betty-Boop style characterization of the main characters in the Ramayana. So too, there is a representation of a working-class Jewish-American woman and her husband, who I presume are heterosexual because of their relationship, but perhaps not. Furthermore, there was no representation of children or the elderly in this animation, and neither were there any differently-abled individuals. Perhaps, I think, Paley might consider individuals who identify in these categories as not relevant to her own story.\n\nAs far as analyzing in the context of race and gender, I do not know how to make such a determination in the context of Paley’s production. Specifically, assigning a meaning for femininity and masculinity (gender) to the characters in Paley’s animation is complex. I could see where the female characters in Sita Sings the Blues were in contrast to one another. From my perspective, I see Sita’s clothing as revealing and the Jewish-American woman’s clothing as conservative, but that understanding is based on my own cultural schemata. So, does clothing style speak about gender? I do not know, because it could also speak about traditions dictated by weather and climate conditions. I also see that Sita is more submissive than the Jewish-American woman, but that is perhaps related to each individual’s degree of reliance on a man for an economic means of survival. Specifically, women in the U.S. often have the ability to support themselves, whereas life in other areas of the world where Hinduism is prevalent may have fewer employment options, and thus are dependent on their husbands. So, does the submission to a man reflect femininity and gender? I do not know. Perhaps it reflects a certain set of power dynamics in relation to a certain economic reality.\n\nFurthermore, I do not know which race these animated Hindu and/or Jewish individuals might be. This applies to the category Americans, also. Likewise, is jazz-blues music racial? I do not know. It has roots in communities of the enslaved African-Americans in early U.S. history but is not limited to the African-American community today. The racial quality of the Betty Boop character is interesting, too. The Betty Boop character is patterned after a white-skinned performer named Helen Kane who’s show style, in turn, is patterned after African-American singer Ester Jones (Baby Ester) performance style. So, is Betty Boop racial? I don’t know. Perhaps it is best to say that the symbols that Paley chose for her animated story represent the complexity of attempting to understand and explain racial and gender categories. For this reason, I choose to write by contextualizing in cultural and ethnic categories and that of male-female relations as I understand them, rather than assigning and discussing ambiguous racial categories or assigning gender meanings to a culture and individuals with whom I am not familiar.\n\nThus, feminist artist Nina Paley used the medium of a motion picture in order to explain the breakup of her own marriage in a production she named Sita Sings the Blues. Paley created the animation by superimposing popular 1920’s U.S. American jazz-blues musical tracks by singer Annette Hanshaw along with a flapper-era Betty Boop type characterization of the Hindu goddess Sita onto portions of the ancient Hindu epic, the Ramayana of Valmiki. In this way, Paley explains the contemporary plot of a working-class U.S. Jewish-American woman scorned by presenting the story’s main theme as the mythological story pattern of betrayal as she envisions it occurring in parallel events of various times and places past and present. That is to say, in the production of Sita Sings the BluesNina Paley interpreted various cultural productions and then she combined and reproduced them in a new work that is meaningful to her in the context of her own life and circumstances at that time, emerging as a cultural s/hero in the end.\n\nI can see that through the critical perspective of a feminist and producer of animated pictures, and in the aftermath of the breakup of her marriage, Paley saw instances of male domination and female oppression in portions of the Ramayana of Valmiki as well as in certain Hanshaw recordings, and she presented them as a theme of betrayal in order to create Sita Sings the Blues. From Paley’s perspective, she sees an example of spousal betrayal when Rama rejects his wife Sita because he questions her purity and virtue after the evil Ravana abducted and held her, attempting to seduce her. She supports this idea when she inserts Hanshaw’s track “You’re Mean to Me” to explain her take on the virtuous woman’s perspective of spousal rejection.\n\nInterestingly though, Paley included other perspectives on betrayal in her work. She showed that in purity cultures and from a male perspective, a wife’s chastity is necessary for a man’s own standing in his community. The fact that Sita spent time with another man without a chaperone placed her feminine virtue (chastity) in dispute. The need for an idealized perfect image for one’s own identity would be especially true for the leadership role of the God-king Rama, who symbolizes the ideal man in traditional Hindu culture. If the community perceived Rama’s wife as a less-than-virtuous, Rama’s own community standing and image as a virtuous leader would likewise be compromised.\n\nA third perspective is offered when a trio of shadow puppets discuss the perspective of the supposedly evil Ravana. Ravana, they say, was not portrayed as a typical villain in that he did not harm or force himself on the beautiful Sita, but rather he patiently waited for her acceptance of him. From this standpoint, whether Ravana can be perceived as good or evil is in dispute. Ravana can be seen as virtuous because he set a standard for ethical conduct in times of group conflict. We can further contextualize this idea by considering that abduction and rape is a common occurrence in ethnic and national conflicts (war). The role of Ravana in the Ramayana of Valmki is interesting in that it disrupts the good/evil dichotomy that is often present in Western s/hero’s journey story patterns.\n\nThus, Paley used her production to analyze and communicate about love relationships – hers and others. She did so by following a typically indigenous story cycle pattern, one that extends from a place of community. Furthermore, Paley’s portrayal of her personal s/hero’s journey avoided stereotyping individuals and cultures by pigeonholing them into good/bad us against-them-dichotomous categorizations. Instead, because her personal story transcends race, class, and national categories, so too, do the characters in her motion picture. She included different discourses (i.e. she included various class and ethnic/national as well as both male and female perspectives) into her production. Paley developed her own personal story within a context of a globalized vision of culture and then sent an animated representation of it back out to her larger world-wide community so that others could benefit from her particular contribution to the Ramayana story.\n\nOthers see strong feminist symbols in Sita, too. For example, in the article titled Sita in Valmiki Ramayana: A Feminist Archetype, author G.R.K. Murty suggests that contrary to popular Indian feminist sentiments that see Sita as an “overly-submissive wife who committed suicide for an ultimately untrusting husband” (citing Hirst and Lynn, 2004) we can perceive her as a feminist archetype instead. Thus, Murty proceeds to provide evidence, taken from the Ramayana epic, portraying Sita as an assertive “commander at ease” who speaks as the voice of dharma (the Hindu law governing individual conduct), optimistically debating against male chauvinism with endurance and self-respect (Murty). In this way, Sita stands in opposition to male control and domination but does so with feminine grace and charm. However, even as Murti embraces Sita as a positive feminist symbol, others argue a contrary point.\n\nFor example, self-professed common man and layman, Hetal M. Doshi, in Feminist Reading Of Indian Epics: Exploring Sita And Draupadi Through The Current Perceptioncontends that Sita may not have been the victim of a patriarchal society as is often argued by feminists. Doshi asserts that women, through three distinct phases of feminism, have already achieved equality with men. He suggests that Sita, a person of “delicate gender” insisted on going into the forest against the will of Rama, who did not appreciate this because he felt it was his “duty” to keep Sita out of the forest and therefore out of harm’s way (Doshi). This is an interesting idea, and likely a common idea amongst Indian men. That is, it seems that violence against women is so normalized in Indian society that men feel that they have an obligation to make special provisions in order to keep their wives safe, while at the very same time they perceive equality between the sexes.\n\nThe reality is that the prevalence of violence toward women in India is epidemic, in particular, sexual violence. A report by A. J. Plus in the online news outlet Aljazeera dated July 24, 2015, discusses the role of an organization titled The Red Brigade in bringing about a greater awareness of sexual violence toward women in India since the brutal attack, gang-rape, and murder of a 23-year old student from Delhi that occurred in 2012. Film producer David Hamilton and Indian-Canadian director Deepa Mehta are also bringing the violence against Indian women crisis to the national stage in their film production titled Water. Water focuses on the violence perpetrated on the widows of India during the 1930s. The film ends with a commentary informing the audience that the situation still exists with more than 23 million widows living in India as of the 2001 census. According to an October 24, 2014 article by Colin McNeil in the Canadian news source Metro News, the producers originally planned to film Water in the city of Varanasi, in Uttar Pradesh, but because of violent protests and death threats, Hamilton and Mehta decided to film the production in Sri Lanka instead. It seems that some Indian individuals did not wish to have the violence of Indian culture on display for the world to see and they used violence to solve that problem.\n\nInterestingly, Paley and others received similar threats for her more positive and balanced portrayal of Indian culture as present in Indian mythical tales. For instance, Kirk Semple of the New York Times reports on July 21, 2011 that community organizer Rohan A. Narine received death threats for attempting to “unify the young members of the Indian and Indo-Caribbean diaspora in southern Queens” (young Sikhs and Hindus) by bringing them together at a showing of Paley’s work so that individuals in “the two dominant religions” could “get to know each other” and network and “develop a political voice” (Narine). According to Narine, some of the messages he received were violent citing the film as abusive and insulting toward Hindu gods. Paley has received similar threats.\n\nPaley’s production, then, presents her personal betrayal mythical tale in a way that conforms with normative western notions of the s/hero’s journey tale. Specifically, a working-class white Jewish-American woman who was rejected by her husband after spending a period of time apart, emerged the s/hero in the end, a victorious goddess in love with herself. Interestingly, Paley also included an indigenous story cycle pattern in that her production; it is indigenous in that is it extends from a place of community, it is inclusive of many perspectives, and Paley avoids stereotyping as well as the good-versus-evil dichotomous s/hero’s journey that is common in the West. Paley’s complex story, as well as Sita’s, transcends race, class, and national categories as well as time. The ways in which others perceive these stories, however, are entirely dependent upon their unique schemata or worldview. Some see good in these stories, and some see bad, while others perceive balance of multiple perspectives or different discourses.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDoshi, Hetal M.1, hetaldoshi123@yahoo.com. “Feminist Reading Of Indian Epics: Exploring Sita And Draupadi Through The Current Perception.” IUP Journal Of English Studies8.4 (2013): 81-85.
