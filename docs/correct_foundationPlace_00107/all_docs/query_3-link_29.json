        "text": "The ACPA Foundation stands in solidarity with all who seek a more just and equitable world, starting with our college and university campuses and the Black Lives Matter movement. Institutional racism is real, and we support the ACPA members, particularly our Black colleagues, who have had their personal self-worth, professional advancement, or sense of wellbeing compromised because of oppressive systems and structures. As Trustees, we commit to the self-work and learning to ensure that we support our profession in a manner that reduces societal stratification. The ACPA Foundation is committed to raising funds that help ACPA provide the research, scholarship and professional development for college student educators everywhere, including continuing to dedicate resources to advance ACPA’s Strategic Imperative for Racial Justice and Decolonization. We will support ACPA’s commitment to increase higher and tertiary education practitioners and scholars’ knowledge about racial justice and to gain the skills necessary to assist students and colleagues to create more just systems– as our students are the racial justice leaders that will help us boldly transform higher education and the world.\n\nKeith Humphrey, ACPA Foundation President\n\nHeidi Levine, ACPA Foundation President-elect\n\nMelissa Jones, ACPA Foundation Vice President\n\nAlan Acosta, ACPA Foundation Treasurer\n\nJoe Cooper, ACPA Foundation Secretary\n\nOn behalf of the ACPA Foundation Board of Trustees\n\nCommission for Assessment and Evaluation Award Nominations Are Open!\n\nEvery year CAE recognizes dedicated assessment professionals with awards for...
