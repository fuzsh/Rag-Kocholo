        "text": "Our understanding of diversity\n\nWe recognise that there are many definitions of diversity. At Oak, we are committed to embracing diversity in all its forms (e.g., ethnicity, race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, tribe, caste, socio-economic status, age, among others) and respect different ideas, approaches, and views. We are committed to understanding and acting on diversity in many ways, including internally and within our grant-making strategies.\n\nOur commitment: internal operations\n\nWe are committed to recruiting a diverse roster of consultants and candidates for positions at Oak Foundation. We work to foster an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive. We celebrate each person for who they are and what they bring to their roles at Oak. We believe that great ideas can come from anyone at any level of the organisation. We believe that innovation, creativity, and growth take place best in an environment that promotes healthy debate and rewards divergent opinions. We value different learning and personality styles and are mindful of our power and biases within Oak and with our grantee partners.\n\nOur commitment: grant-making\n\nWe recognise that systemic barriers and discrimination have historically disadvantaged some communities, and we strive to address these inequities through our grant-making and partnerships. We commit to deepening our support to organisations and initiatives that promote equity and justice for all, especially those that are led by and serve communities that have been historically marginalised. This includes supporting intermediaries that represent a diversity of expertise and ideas and diversity of people and cultures. We also commit to supporting organisations and initiatives that empower individuals and communities, build resilience, and create more equitable and just systems and structures through our grant-making programmes and through our capacity building and organisational development support.\n\nWe strive to have grant-making strategies and approaches, and internal policies and practices that are based on the principles of equity and inclusion. This means identifying and removing barriers for our partners and staff, and providing support to those who need it most.\n\nOur commitment: learning practices"
