I share some insights for large product groups (for example, 500-1500 person, multisite) while working with customers (Xerox, Alcatel-Lucent, ...), as well as lessons from my co-author Bas Vodde, who has in-depth experience with big product groups and enterprise transformations (at Nokia Networks and NSN). I present concrete practices and tips related to adoption, structure, policy, requirements, contracts, architecture and design, offshore (including at Valtech, India) and multisite development, coordination, and planning multi-hundred-person product groups, and more.\n\nSpeakers\n\nCraig Larman\n\nManagement and Organizational-design Consultant, Craig Larman\n\nCraig Larman serves as a management consultant, with a focus on organizational redesign and systems thinking, for high-value-throughput enterprises. His emphasis is scaling agile and lean thinking to very large, multisite, and agile offshore development (often, embedded systems, telecommunications, or investment banking), and coaching executive teams to succeed with larger enterprise-level agile and lean methods adoption; these topics are the subject of his latest two books:\n\nScaling Lean & Agile Development: Thinking & Organizational Tools\n\nPractices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Successful Large, Multisite & Offshore Products with Large-Scale Scrum\n\nCraig has served as the lead coach of lean software development adoption at Xerox, and serves as a consultant for large-scale Scrum and enterprise agile adoption at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Alcatel-Lucent, UBS, Nokia Networks and Siemens Networks (now, NSN), Thomson Reuters, Statoil, Cisco-Tandberg, and at Schlumberger, among many other clients. Craig also serves as chief scientist at Valtech, a consulting, outsourcing, and skills transfer organization with divisions in many countries, with a division in Bangalore that applies agile methods to offshore development. In his role at Valtech, he created \"agile offshore development\" while living in India and China. His work focuses on product groups that involve a few hundred to a few thousand people, usually multisite.\n\nTime\n\n09:00 AM - 10:00 AM\n\nRoom\n\nGrand Ball Room\n\nStage\n\nKeynote\n\nLevel\n\nIntroductory\n\nSession Type\n\nTalk\n\nDirect Link\n\nhttps://betterconf.confengine.com/agileindia2013/index.html#session-2-info\n\n10:15\n\nManagement Conference Overview\n\nKeynote\n\nGrand Ball Room\n\n10:15 AM - 10:45 AM\n\nSpeakers\n\nNaresh Jain (@nashjain)\n\nTech-Startup Founder and Agile/Lean Evangelist, AgileFAQs\n\nGeek at heart, Naresh is a tech-startup founder, building two lean-startups in India.

Enterprise customers, however, tend to have more complex requirements and are unlikely to accept a basic product - especially via an RFP process, which is how most enterprises make purchasing decisions.

One problematic behavior humans have is that we are hardwired to instantly decide who we trust. And we generally aren't aware of these decisionsâit just happens. Linda Rising explains that this hardwired âtrust evaluationâ can get in the way of working well with others. Pairing, the daily stand-up, and close communication with the customer and others outside the team go a long way to overcome our instant evaluation of others. As Linda helps you gain a better understanding of this mechanism in your behavior and what agile processes can do to help, you are more likely to build better interpersonal relationships and create successful products.\n\nSpeakers\n\nLinda Rising (@RisingLinda)\n\nIndependent consultant, Linda Rising LLC\n\nLinda Rising has a Ph.D. from Arizona State University and a background that includes university teaching and industry work in a variety of domains.

When it came time to grow Obtiva in 2007, it was clear to me that we needed a two-pronged approach: we would hire the best people we could afford, and we would grow great developers through an apprenticeship program. In this talk, I will step through the evolution of this apprenticeship program, its progression from a team of 5, to consultancy of 50, to an engineering department of 500.\n\nSpeakers\n\nDave Hoover (@davehoover)\n\nLearning Facilitator, DevBootcamp\n\nDave Hoover enjoys developing software developers while developing software.

Agile provided such a radical shift for traditional waterfall processes. Yet as Agile has matured, it is redefining itself at a pace that rivals the whims of the fashion industry. This presentation presents not only the (somewhat obvious) shifts from waterfall to Agile, but the second and third generation of shifts within the Agile community itself. Basics such as automated unit tests are falling away (âDeployment is the new unit testâ). The overall message is to continue to question practices, and strive.\n\nSpeakers\n\nFred George (@fgeorge52)\n\nConsultant, Fred George Consulting\n\nFred George is a consultant with over 44 years experience in the industry including over twenty years doing object programming and over a dozen years doing Agile/XP.

How to tell which practices should be used together, which can be safely set aside to begin with? How to predict the consequences, good and bad, of changing your software development processes?\n\nThese questions often confront managers new to XP or Agile processes. It turns out that there is a methodical and rigorous way of dealing with them: arising from the discipline known as \"Systems Thinking\", the use of Diagrams of Effects or Causal Loop Diagrams to understand the dynamics of software projects has, by now, become a standard tool in effective XP/Agile coaching.\n\nThis session introduces the notation and the modeling activity, then offers participant a chance to consolidate their learning by actually practicing DOEs.\n\nSpeakers\n\nLaurent Bossavit (@Morendil)\n\nDirector, Institut Agile\n\nLaurent Bossavit still likes to code though no longer doing so full-time.

Karl Scotland introduces 5 leverage points from Kanban Thinking which can be used to intervene and achieve smooth flow, increased value, and improved potential. Karl shows how to design a Kanban System by studying the current context, creating a shared understanding of that reality, putting explicit limits in place, sensing the current capability, and continually learning to guide improvements. With these levers, you will be able to establish and evolve unique and relevant processes that will lead to greater success.\n\nSpeakers\n\nKarl Scotland (@kjscotland)\n\nLean and Agile Coach, Rally Software\n\nKarl Scotland is a versatile software practitioner with over 15 years of experience covering development, project management, team leadership, coaching and training.

What's the difference? Levers are employed to change someone else's behavior.Feedback is employed to improve your own performance. The distinction is subtle but critical.\n\nOne of the most basic tenants of Agile is to trust the insight of the people closest to the work. But, here's the dilemma... as Agile scales into the enterprise, organizations are demanding measurement. I have seen many presentations on measurement and they often start with a quote like this one from Lord Kelvin, \"[When] you know something about [something]; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.\" A measurement regime based upon this tenant is doomed to drive you to the \"dark side\". Rather, the introduction of measurement to the Agile domain requires that it complement and even amplify the qualitative insight of those closest to the work, NOT replace or counter it.\n\nThe above is just one example. This talk will walk you through the seven deadly \"sins\" to look out for when implementing an agile measurement regime, but it's not all fire and brimstone. We will leave you with a list of \"heavenly virtues\" or good practices to follow when implementing your measurement regime and we will present examples of companies that we have worked with and whose metrics regimes exhibit these virtues. This information should give you the means to bend your own execs towards risk evaluation rather than absolutes; toward measurement as an insight amplification and feedback mechanism rather than a club to beat people up; as something that your teams will seek out rather than something that they will dread.\n\nSpeakers\n\nSteve Wolfe\n\nDirector, Product Marketing, Rally Software\n\nSteve has over 20 years experience working on web services, desktop, and Unix software products in a variety of industries.

It's easy to see why. Software development's an expensive risky business. To deal with the risk, the players involved adopt a client-vendor model where those in the client role give requirements and those in the vendor role estimate time and effort and agree to build what's asked for. In this model we clearly separate responsibilities so that we know who's accountable when things go wrong. Although we know things rarely go as planned, and innovative ideas rarely spring from such a relationship, we continue to work in processes where treating our coworkers as outsourced vendors is considered \"best practice\" and risking everything on the ideas of a select few isn't regarded as risky.\n\nThis talk is about an alternative way of working.\n\nIn this talk Jeff explores companies beginning to adopt a style of working where everyone in the organization gets involved with identifying and solving problems. You'll hear examples from real companies describing their practices for learning first-hand about customers and users, practices for collaboratively designing solutions for the problems found in the real world, and approaches to learning if what we created really benefited anyone. This new style of work is a process cocktail combining the best of agile development, lean software development and lean startup, user-centered design, and collaborative design thinking. This style of work isn't the traditional client-vendor model where knowing who's to blame is the primary concern. It's a co-making style of work where everyone brings their skills and experience to the table and together takes ownership for making great things.\n\nSpeakers\n\nJeff Patton (@jeffpatton)\n\nCo-Founder, CoMakers\n\nJeff makes use of over 18 years experience with a wide variety of products from on-line aircraft parts ordering to electronic medical records to help organizations improve the way they work.

Lean Startups take a different approach and involve customers at every stage of product development. In this session, participants run a business based on the \"Lean Startup\" approach. The session starts off by playing a collaborative game that explores the marketplace. Participants organize themselves as self-organizing teams and try to run a profitable business by making \"widgets\". They sell the \"widgets\" to customer and during the course of game the teams learn what the customer wants (and is willing to pay for). The teams also track a few metrics to remain profitable. At the end of the game the facilitator debriefs with the participants on why Customer Validation is important.

Our customers were satisfied, but rarely were they delighted, enchanted, captivated by novel innovation or creative design. Our software looked like it was thought of one customer-driven feature at a time â which is more or less what happened. It became evident that conventional Agile/Scrum lacked the creative workflows to find the right product to build.\" So began the journey of one consulting firm from disciplined software development to disciplined creative innovation. These days the firm's customers aren't just satisfied, they are thrilled.\n\nThe defining characteristic of brilliant consumer products is the elegant combination of design and technology to create a product with a unified wholeness. It feels right. It works right. It makes sense. It's just what I wanted and I didn't know it until I saw it. In today's competitive environment, this sense of design is what makes products great and gives them staying power.\n\nThis talk is about returning the power of design to the people developing the product â it's about expecting our teams to grapple with the whole problem and engineer complete solutions.\n\nSpeakers\n\nMary Poppendieck (@mpoppendieck)\n\nFounder, Poppendieck LLC\n\nMary Poppendieck started her career as a process control programmer, moved on to manage the IT department of a manufacturing plant, and then ended up in product development, where she was both a product champion and department manager.\n\nMary considered retirement 1998, but instead found herself managing a government software project where she first encountered the word \"waterfall.\" When Mary compared her experience in successful software and product development to the prevailing opinions about how to manage software projects, she decided the time had come for a new paradigm. She wrote the award-winning book Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit in 2003 to explain how the lean principles from manufacturing offer a better approach to software development.\n\nOver the past several years, Mary has found retirement elusive as she lectures and teaches classes with her husband Tom. Based on their on-going learning, they wrote a second book, Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash in 2006, and a third, Leading Lean Software Development: Results are Not the Point in 2009.

Changes such as adopting agile methods are hard enough for a web application in a small company. Agile transformation in a big organization as ours is probably the most challenging and difficult changes for all, from top management to individual developers.\n\nAgile values and principles sound all good but they are in conflicts with traditional thinking and way of working that we are all familiar with. What can help drive agile transformation in a company - no matter big or small?\n\nWe know that we want to have agile mindset and we want to build the agile mindset. Where could we possibly start?\n\nThis session is an experience session as an agile coach in Ericsson, on how we have successfully focused on behaviors of different roles (from managers, scrum masters, support functions, product owners, teams to individuals) to help build the agile mindset.\n\nSpeakers\n\nEvelyn Tian (@TianEvelyn)\n\nAgile Head Coach, Ericsson R&D China\n\nEvelyn Tian has been working as an Agile Coach and is passionate about lean and agile transformation.

Larger engines have been asked for help, but hauling toys is beneath their dignity. So the little engine agrees to try, and as it chugs up the mountain saying to itself \"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can...\" readers wonder if it will get to the top. This little engine has the Lean Mindset. It welcomes challenge and is not afraid to fail. It's the kind of mindset that keeps athletes training for years in order to compete in the Olympics; that encourages musicians to practice for hours each day. Athletes and musicians know that if you do not make mistakes when you practice, you aren't improving.\n\nYet in our companies, we expect perfection; we have no systems that encourage people to stretch beyond the limits of success and learn through failure. We do not look for leaders who are still learning â we look instead for leaders who are done learning â and we deserve what we get.\n\nThe Lean Mindset brings a sense of adventure and experimentation and learning to our work. It encourages us to hire little engines that can rather than big engines that can't. It values improvement â which means we aren't yet perfect; it values exploration â rather than executing the wrong plan; it welcomes failure â because failure means we have raised our game to the next level.\n\nSpeakers\n\nMary Poppendieck (@mpoppendieck)\n\nFounder, Poppendieck LLC\n\nMary Poppendieck started her career as a process control programmer, moved on to manage the IT department of a manufacturing plant, and then ended up in product development, where she was both a product champion and department manager.\n\nMary considered retirement 1998, but instead found herself managing a government software project where she first encountered the word \"waterfall.\" When Mary compared her experience in successful software and product development to the prevailing opinions about how to manage software projects, she decided the time had come for a new paradigm. She wrote the award-winning book Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit in 2003 to explain how the lean principles from manufacturing offer a better approach to software development.\n\nOver the past several years, Mary has found retirement elusive as she lectures and teaches classes with her husband Tom. Based on their on-going learning, they wrote a second book, Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash in 2006, and a third, Leading Lean Software Development: Results are Not the Point in 2009. A popular writer and speaker, Mary continues to bring fresh perspectives to the world of software development.\n\nTime\n\n09:00 AM - 10:00 AM\n\nRoom\n\nGrand Ball Room\n\nStage\n\nKeynote\n\nLevel\n\nIntroductory\n\nSession Type\n\nTalk\n\nDirect Link\n\nhttps://betterconf.confengine.com/agileindia2013/index.html#session-29-info\n\n10:15\n\nPanel\n\nGrand Ball Room 1\n\n10:15 AM - 11:15 AM\n\nThe Agile movement has been a step forward in helping us undersand how to improve the way we build software build.

We do this by applying the same âtestâ conditions we apply to software, to the improvement process. This concept is already present in Lean problem solving techniques: A3 Thinking, which caters for significant problems at an organization level, and Kaizen, which is aimed more at individuals. This workshop adapts the experimental process for the agile team level, to create clear and testable retrospective goals, and follow through on evaluating the results.\n\nSpeakers\n\nCara Turner (@Cara_Faye)\n\nScrum Master and Coach, KRS Consulting\n\nI'm a scrum master and coach with a passion for creating positive working environments for complex adaptive systems.\n\nI place particular value on facilitation as a tool for harnessing the knowledge of teams and to direct meaningful and situationally relevant change, and ultimately find autonomy, mastery and purpose in our work.\n\nI'm committed to sharing agile knowledge via coaching and mentoring in the Cape Town agile community and as a member of the Scrum User Group South Africa (www.sugsa.org.za).\n\nThe software industry has been my home for 10 years, with a prior background in fine art and collaborative creative projects, which feed directly into my experience of software development.\n\nTime\n\n10:15 AM - 11:15 AM\n\nRoom\n\nGrand Ball Room 2\n\nStage\n\nCulture, People and Teams\n\nLevel\n\nPracticing\n\nSession Type\n\nWorkshop\n\nDirect Link\n\nhttps://betterconf.confengine.com/agileindia2013/index.html#session-32-info\n\nJupiter\n\n10:15 AM - 11:15 AM\n\nAgile has bred new ground for Tool vendors, Process Gurus, and other such specialists.

I will argue that determining value is not the responsibility of everyone - not just the \"product owner\" - and that in order to deliver value, the most important thing is to be able to measure it transparently, and to establish a fast feedback loop so we can quickly determine if what we're doing is in fact valuable. In this talk I will discuss several approaches to measuring value, how to maximize creating it, and how doing so affects the way teams work.\n\nSpeakers\n\nJez Humble (@jezhumble)\n\nPrincipal, ThoughtWorks\n\nJez Humble is a Principal at ThoughtWorks Studios, and co-author of the Jolt Award winning Continuous Delivery, published in Martin Fowlerâs Signature Series (Addison Wesley, 2010).

However there are several issues blocking them from moving ahead.\n\nOne key issue is the massive amount of time it takes for someone to certify that the new feature is indeed working as expected and also to assure that the rest of the features will continuing to work. In spite of this long waiting cycle, we still cannot assure that our software will not have any issues. In fact, many times our assumptions about the user's needs or behavior might itself be wrong. But this long testing cycle only helps us validate that our assumptions works as assumed.\n\nHow can we break out of this rut & get thin slices of our features in front of our users to validate our assumptions early?\n\nMost software organizations today suffer from what I call, the \"Inverted Testing Pyramid\" problem. They spend maximum time and effort manually checking software. Some invest in automation, but mostly building slow, complex, fragile end-to-end GUI test. Very little effort is spent on building a solid foundation of unit & acceptance tests.\n\nThis over-investment in end-to-end tests is a slippery slope. Once you start on this path, you end up investing even more time & effort on testing which gives you diminishing returns.\n\nIn this session Naresh Jain will explain the key misconceptions that has lead to the inverted testing pyramid approach being massively adopted, main drawbacks of this approach and how to turn your organization around to get the right testing pyramid.\n\nSpeakers\n\nNaresh Jain (@nashjain)\n\nTech-Startup Founder and Agile/Lean Evangelist, AgileFAQs\n\nGeek at heart, Naresh is a tech-startup founder, building two lean-startups in India.

Identifying a small bit of \"software to build\" as a user story seems easy enough, but agile teams everywhere struggle to really get the value out of them. User stories are simultaneously simple and sophisticated. They're full of paradox and contradiction. This talk is about that.\n\nIn this talk you'll see how user stories were built for conversation and how those conversations affect the details we write down. You'll learn why requiring more details in your stories don't help them get better. You'll learn how stories both shrink in size and grow in detail over time. You'll learn how stories can be \"done\" without software being finished. And finally, you'll learn how stories need to both be independent, and part of holistic story map describing your product. You'll leave with a deep understanding of why user stories are one of the best inventions of the agile community and how you can use them more effectively on your agile project.\n\nSpeakers\n\nJeff Patton (@jeffpatton)\n\nCo-Founder, CoMakers\n\nJeff makes use of over 18 years experience with a wide variety of products from on-line aircraft parts ordering to electronic medical records to help organizations improve the way they work.

It is unique because it is an engineering discipline that offers us a magical medium to express ideas that can come to life, in ways so different from the arts, music or written word. This duality of creativity and rigor creates such powerful and complex opposing forces that successful management of software projects is, perhaps, impossible. Agile software development has certainly prodded us to look in a promising direction, but I think we are still a long, long way from achieving that balance. In many cases, the way agile processes are implemented just increase this tension. To release some of that tension, takes an immense amount of courage and boldness from, both, the manager and the architect. In this talk, we will explore the duality and the interplay of the architect and the manager. Along the way, I will point out some agile landmarks that we need to stop and reconsider. I will also highlight some tweaks that I make to find my own balance. In doing so, I hope to scratch a little bit at the philosophical and quite literal question: \"Are we there yet?\".\n\nSpeakers\n\nAslam Khan (@aslamkhn)\n\nSoftware Developer, factor10\n\nAfter more than 20 years of developing software, I find that each time I learn something, it reveals is another mountain of things that I still don't know.

The faster you can learn from your customers the more effective your team can be in ensuring it is building the right thing. A core part of learning is done by listening to your customers and ensuring you are capturing customer feedback. The speaker will walk attendees through several tips for building, capturing and scaling feedback loops for software teams, using practical examples of what we've learned with software projects at Atlassian.

Many organizations feel that they can battle this problem by stiffening their resolve to have stricter and stricter requirements and process guiding development from inception to production. But that formula does not usually work. This session will demonstrate that better results can from some fundamental changes in management approaches to the problem. Drawing on W.

In fact, we surely wouldn't have survived without this trait. With this built-in biasÂ as a starting point, it's no wonder that software managers and teamsÂ almost always develop poor estimates. But that doesn't mean all is lost. We must simply accept that our estimates are optimistic guesses and continually re-evaluate as we go. Linda Rising has beenÂ part of many development projects where sincere, honest peopleÂ wanted to make the best estimates possible and used âscientificâ approaches to make it happen - and all for naught. In many projects,Â because re-estimation was regarded as an admission of failure, theÂ team spent too much time and endless meetings trying to \"get itÂ right.\" Offering examples from ordinary life - especially from the way people eat and drink - Linda demonstrates how hard it is for us to see our poor estimating skills and offers practical advice on living and working with the self-deception that is hardwired in all of us.\n\nSpeakers\n\nLinda Rising (@RisingLinda)\n\nIndependent consultant, Linda Rising LLC\n\nLinda Rising has a Ph.D. from Arizona State University and a background that includes university teaching and industry work in a variety of domains.

Of course, processes and tools make a difference ââ sometimes a very big difference ââ but what determines whether a process or tool is effective is related to the individuals and interactions. To best achieve agility you need to start with the current context and understand how people actually behave in response to their environment, their beliefs and one another. What actually motivates and demotivates people, developers and other technical roles in particular? What psychology and cognitive biases influence everyday work? What actually makes their work easier or harder? Does making \"business value\" the centrepiece of what they do actually motivate the people who ultimately produce such business value? Or is it more about the individuals and interactions?\n\nSpeakers\n\nKevlin Henney (@KevlinHenney)\n\nDirector, Curbralan\n\nKevlin is an independent consultant and trainer based in the UK.

When building such small teams or an organization ground-up, the leadership has enough flexibility to define DNA and org structure of the organization around agile values. However, a different set of process, organizational and cultural issues crop up when you try to transform and scale up agile development paradigm across a fairly large existing organization. There is enough theory and frameworks available to help such change management, but the real-world issues often act as a forcing function, and the leaders and practitioners need to find creative solutions to implement without compromising either the agile value or the organizational ethos. At Yahoo!, we recently decided to move the entire product organizaiton towards agile way. Given the nature of work we do, the cultural values we share, and the rather chequered history of agile we have at Yahoo!, this has been a great learning experience. In this talk, I will talk about how we went about this transformation, what kind of issues we faced, and how we created unique solutions to best address organizational priorities while still maintaining focus on agile values.\n\nSpeakers\n\nTathagat Varma (@tathagatvarma)\n\nSr. Director, Business Operations, Yahoo!

Faced with these constraints, many teams turn to ad-hoc development in an attempt to \"just get things done\". Pretty soon you have tons of technical debt, it takes ages to test, its impossible to get releases out, and the feedback cycle is bust. The good news is that its easy to setup a simple Kanban process that is extremely lightweight and perfect for startups.

Far more difficult are problems with a dozen or so variables that interact non-linearly. (For example the life sciences now trying to understanding aging or growth or, for software, trying to develop software that can actually support a changing client culture.)\n\nOn Agile projects we try to organically 'grow' software through iterations and develop robust software. However this is not easy on complex problems. We often find ourselves lacking the right kind of thought process and tools to be able to manage such project.\n\nThis presentation offers one partial approach to working on such problems. The talk is inspired by two unlikely bedfellows. On one hand are the musings of IDEO's Peter Coughlan on 'design experience.' On the other hand are the methodologies of the English philosopher J.G. Bennett on how to parse and analyze experience. Bennett's approach offers an interesting tool to look at interaction and conditionality among variables. In this presentation we would take Bennett's easiest unit of conditionality, the triad, and show all the (6)modes of permutation and how we find them in typical problems to solve in software.\n\nAutomatic Pilot - routinization of lower level tasks (i.e. travelocity for tickets)\n\nCreation - novel solutions with a 'lock and key' quality\n\nIdentity Fading into View - a incremental increase in skill (like the constructs in computer games)\n\nGravity Applies - handling industries based on regulations\n\nIntensification - using the computer to reach new levels of understanding as in certain economic modeling\n\nRelease into New Freedoms - how one platform can lead to another ie. how facebook led to new forms of marketing.\n\nThe participants will\n\n(a) gain a practical introduction to Bennett,\n\n(b) grasp the specifics of how variables interact, and\n\n(c) see how this offers them a new handle on end user culture and demands.\n\nSpeakers\n\nJenny Quillien\n\nProfessor of Management, New Mexico Highlands University\n\nDr. Jenny Quillien enjoys both French and American citizenship, a long standing academic and consulting career in both of her 'base' countries, and international experience in over 30 nations.

Similarly, for companies that manage outsourced application development and product maintenance work, the notion of delivery reliability and predictability is paramount from their customer's perspective, and hence leaves little scope for innovating service delivery processes. On the other hand, we do have examples of application of agile, lean and lean startup practices leading to highly successful innovation, especially in web-based startups.\n\nSo, is it a right hypothesis that agile kills innovation, or are there critical success factors that we could learn from? Is it possible to tailor agile methods to accelerate innovation in different domains?
