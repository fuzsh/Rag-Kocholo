        "text": "As a physician, scientist, and clinician, David’s life left an indelible mark not only on his family, but also on the lives he touched through his clinical practice and groundbreaking scientific research. His vision was guided by his principles: the needs of the patient come first, the integrity of the science, and the imperative to work toward meaningful change.\n\nHe built meaningful collaborations and partnerships and always focused forward on his vision of a single multi site cancer screening test. That vision lives on. Never one to focus on accolades, he valued the team it takes to accomplish goals, and always looked to the next challenge, the next opportunity to solve a problem to innovate and improve lives.\n\nWhile David devoted his life to medicine, his spirit found a home in nature. Always an adventurer, he shared his love for the world, his sense of wonder for all living things with his children and grandchildren, as well as the passionate admonishment that “if we do not take care of the environment, nothing else will matter”. That is the meaningful change Alder Branch focuses resources on and we carry him with us into the challenge.\n\nDavid lived and died with gratitude. He is deeply loved and missed.\n\nFew human activities sit more firmly at the intersection of environment, health, and community than the ways we grow, process, distribute, and consume food. The Alder Branch Foundation is committed to identifying and supporting non-profit organizations dedicated to building more just, inclusive, and sustainable food systems that nourish people, communities, and the Earth.\n\nWe are especially interested in supporting organizations who draw on diverse knowledges and perspectives to help chart viable pathways forward by serving as role models, teachers, community-builders, thought leaders, advocates, innovators, and motivators. We give priority to organizations whose models and/or practices can be adapted and adopted by others."
