        "text": "Three female, and feminist, academics become participant researchers to explore their working practices seeking to make visible the ways they work to wo(manage) the masculinist environment of the University. After reviewing the literature, the paper starts by considering what 'masculinist' means in this context, finding that it refers to both rigidity of structure positioned as 'impartial' and, paradoxically, processes that enable competition and the clear identification of winners and losers; a University regime compatible with neo-liberal governance. Such values are at odds with those promoted within Early Years Education where 'caring' and 'inclu-sion' are fundamental, embedded in a strong 'domestic' tradition. The paper examines the historical practice of transferring 'mothering' skills into the educational institution and considers current attitudes and behaviours in relation to this synergy. Analysing their own attitudes and practices through an innovative (and time-effective) methodology, AAA/I (Asynchronous Associative Auto/Inquiry), the participant researchers consider the ways in which, through collaboration, they ameliorate University processes and working conditions to support each other and their students. Findings are discussed in relation to masculinist traditions and competitiveness, collaboration and caring, and the creation of 'protective enclaves', feminised micro-contexts within the larger masculinist domain. Considering their actions in toto, the trio reflect on the extent that their actions promote, evade or hinder a move towards greater gender equality and admit to the personal costs of continually striving to change the working environment. Introduction This paper uses a gendered frame to examine how female academics can enhance their working conditions and the satisfaction of their female students by adopting collaborative, even collusive, 'ways of working'. The discussion is deliberately a gendered one because we are choosing to explore our ideas from a feminist position but also for practical reasons: we are all women, and for the most part our students are female too (but when male students enroll we do include them in our supportive practices). It sets out to consider how, as women, we manage our working lives, seeking successful careers within a profession where the 'ways of working' are commonly termed masculinist and men are promoted more often than women. 2 It was our intention to focus on the positive strategies we employ but, in response to feedback , we later discuss the cost of this positivity on our individual career progression and the choices that we have made. There is no intention to present a saccharine account, to artificially sweeten the discussion but nor do we want to position our university as a difficult place to work. From our reading and our academic networks we know that the challenges we face are not uncommon. The paper takes a narrative approach. It aims to blend the stories of three individuals with different career trajectories to find a 'common' voice. We have been colleagues for many years, co-teachers and co-researchers within the same university department and, more importantly , remain close friends despite working in an environment that is often considered to promote competition rather than the caring ethos we value. Part of our survival strategy includes developing novel ways of working like the research methodology that we describe within this paper, an approach that enabled us to share our reflections even though we were too busy to meet together face-to-face. The intention was to collect the relevant aspects of our 'life stories' and set them in context in order to weave a coherent 'life history' of our working practices. In doing this, we were following a tradition commonly used within educa"
